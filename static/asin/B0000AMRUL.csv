764895,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000AMRUL,A Customer,"[1, 3]","Summary:Four men, Dr. Henry Devilin (Thomas Jane), Joe 'Beaver' Clarenden (Jason Lee), Gary 'Jonesy' Jones (Damian Lewis), and Pete Walker (Timothy Olyphant), have become lifelong friends, in part as the result of an encounter they had with a mentally challenged boy their age when they were teenagers.  They saved Douglas 'Duddits' Cavell (old - Donnie Wahlberg; young - Andrew Robb) from the torments of some older boys and, as a result of their friendship, Duddits endowed them with special powers.The friends, as a tradition, head to a remote cabin in the late winter for a reprieve from their daily lives.  But their pleasant winter retreat quickly dissolves into chaos when an alien species, that uses humans as hosts, crash-lands a ship in the vicinity.  The four men eventually come head-to-head with the aliens, two quickly losing the battle.  But with the help of their gifts and eventually Duddits himself, the remaining two friends are able to assist the military personnel in charge of containing the invasion and stop one alien in particular from infecting the entire human race.I should note that there is a sub-plot involving Col. Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman) and Lt. Owen (Tom Sizemore), two of the military personnel, but it is peripheral to the main story.Comments:I wasn't really sure where the movie was going when it started and the time spent introducing the special gifts of all of the friends was a bit painstaking as the main storyline didn't get very far while this was taking place.  But once the aliens and the friends came into contact, the story picked up.  So, be prepared to wait a while for the story to develop.The story itself is decent, but there is obviously a lot missing from the movie that is likely included in the book (I haven't read the book, so I can't say; but I do own it and it's massive).  I'm thinking there is probably quite a bit of information concerning the back stories of the aliens and their previous invasion attempts as well as the development of Col. Curtis's insanity.  There is also probably a longer introduction to the special abilities of the friends.  All of these elements are only briefly addressed in the movie and giving them more depth would definitely have lent credibility to what was going on.  As it stands, the story is pretty coincidental and the characters are shallow.The acting is decent.  I was fairly impressed with Damian Lewis's ability to jump between personas and the rest of the cast was convincing, but there were to many characters and there wasn't really enough time to develop each one.  Also, it seems as though Thomas Jane's character is supposed to be the protagonist in the movie, but he doesn't get all of the screen time a protagonist is normally allotted.  I kept wondering who the hero was going to turn out to be.  so you know, it's him.Overall, the movie does kind of pull you in after a while as you want to see what happens with the aliens (though it isn't particularly surprising).  Also, be prepared for a somewhat predictable and anti-climactic ending; there aren't many surprises here, though two of the friends do end up dying. The DVD does also include a 'making of' featurette and an interview with Stephen King, both of which were informative.  Though I enjoyed the movie, it isn't really one that is going to stick with me.  It's definitely worth watching if you are into sci-fi or Stephen King, but don't be expecting something spectacular as it is really just a slightly above average movie.",3,eventually engaging; predictable ending,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,3509,"['Summary', 'Four', 'men', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Devilin', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Joe', ""'Beaver"", 'Clarenden', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Gary', ""'Jonesy"", 'Jones', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Pete', 'Walker', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'have', 'become', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'part', 'result', 'encounter', 'had', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'boy', 'age', 'when', 'were', 'teenagers', 'saved', 'Douglas', ""'Duddits"", 'Cavell', 'old', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'young', 'Andrew', 'Robb', 'torments', 'older', 'boys', 'result', 'friendship', 'Duddits', 'endowed', 'special', 'powers.The', 'friends', 'tradition', 'head', 'remote', 'cabin', 'late', 'winter', 'reprieve', 'daily', 'lives', 'pleasant', 'winter', 'retreat', 'quickly', 'chaos', 'when', 'alien', 'species', 'humans', 'hosts', 'crash-lands', 'ship', 'vicinity', 'four', 'men', 'eventually', 'come', 'head-to-head', 'aliens', 'two', 'quickly', 'losing', 'battle', 'help', 'gifts', 'eventually', 'remaining', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'able', 'assist', 'military', 'personnel', 'charge', 'containing', 'invasion', 'stop', 'one', 'alien', 'particular', 'infecting', 'entire', 'human', 'race.I', 'should', 'note', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Col.', 'Abraham', 'Curtis', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lt.', 'Owen', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'two', 'military', 'personnel', 'peripheral', 'main', 'story.Comments', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'started', 'time', 'spent', 'introducing', 'special', 'gifts', 'friends', 'was', 'bit', 'painstaking', 'main', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'far', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'once', 'aliens', 'friends', 'came', 'contact', 'story', 'picked', 'up', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'wait', 'while', 'story', 'develop.The', 'story', 'decent', 'obviously', 'lot', 'missing', 'movie', 'likely', 'included', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', 'own', 'massive', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'probably', 'quite', 'bit', 'information', 'concerning', 'back', 'stories', 'aliens', 'previous', 'invasion', 'attempts', 'as', 'well', 'development', 'Col.', 'Curtis', 'insanity', 'also', 'probably', 'longer', 'introduction', 'special', 'abilities', 'friends', 'elements', 'are', 'only', 'briefly', 'addressed', 'movie', 'giving', 'more', 'depth', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'lent', 'credibility', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'pretty', 'coincidental', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'was', 'fairly', 'impressed', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'ability', 'jump', 'personas', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'convincing', 'there', 'were', 'many', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'one', 'Also', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'protagonist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'screen', 'time', 'protagonist', 'normally', 'allotted', 'kept', 'wondering', 'who', 'hero', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'know', 'him.Overall', 'movie', 'kind', 'pull', 'while', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'aliens', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'surprising', 'Also', 'be', 'prepared', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'anti-climactic', 'ending', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises', 'here', 'two', 'friends', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'DVD', 'also', 'include', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'interview', 'Stephen', 'King', 'were', 'informative', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'one', 'going', 'stick', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'sci-fi', 'Stephen', 'King', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'something', 'spectacular', 'really', 'just', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'movie']",N/A

764911,A2ACHVOFMAIQ1K,B0000AMRUL,"Arthem ""arthem""","[9, 13]","I admit it.  I was actually intrigued by a Steven King movie for the first thirty minutes.  Now I'm intrigued by whatever psychosis is evidenced in my repeated viewings of King movies, despite their lousy history.  A few observations follow:1.  Stephen King is a flake, and brings his flakiness to his dialog.  I believe Dreamcatcher is probably the movie most faithful to the pecurliar idioms that he applies to his characters.  The little trivialities he throws in to make his characters' dialog lifelike makes me wince.  Hint to Stephen: The little girl in Sleepless in Seattle who speaks in acronyms is a clever addition.  Your thirtyish New Englanders speaking in acronyms is banal.2.  Stephen King's plots survive through about half of the book (or movie).  He creates sinister, ominous undertones that hint at apocolypse.  Then he's unable to pull it off.  Seeing John-Boy & Friends beating the giant spider to death in the ""It"" miniseries was pretty lousy.  Such ludicrous imagery is almost overcome by the final conflict sequence in Dreamcatcher.3.  Let's see... group of youngsters, bound together by childhood friendship, queer magic, bullies and physical maladies forget their ""golden days"" and grow up to be successful civilian nobodies, only to be drawn back together by mysterious forces and confronted by an evil that threatens mankind.  Only by recapturing their childhood innocence and magic can they ultimately defeat that evil.  OK, Steve, we've got it.  Think up a new plot.4.  The special effects were excellent in some cases, pathetic in others.  It wasn't until I saw the giant alien killer leech that I realized the full comedic potential of Dreamcatcher.5.  Why were Morgan Freeman & crew attacking the aliens with helicopters?  Why did the aliens just stand around and get shot?  Why do creatures who can master interstellar flight have no offensive weaponry?  How can a guy on a snowmobile, speaking in an english accent, escape a secure military perimeter by hijacking a truck (since most military folks have already seen this happen in First Blood)?6.

One year, the four gather in the woods to reminisce, and strange things begin to happen-- like all the animals begin to suddenly migrate, which is a strange sight to see. It's not every day you see a bear walking alongside rabbits and deer.

We are shown four friends in four locations, each demonstrating some psychic ability. The four guys get together in a deepwoods cabin for beers and laughs (as they have for the last twenty years). Then, two of them (Henry and Pete) leave on an excursion in the truck, while the other pair (Jonesy and Beav) go deerhunting around the cabin. A strange hunter wanders into camp, seeming dazed and injured. Now, up until this point all is well, tension and dread are building, and the mystery is intriguing. Jonesy brings the poor hunter into the cabin where he (the hunter) begins stinking up the place with acrid fart gas. To make matters worse, he waddles into the bathroom and gives birth to a 15 pound turd with teeth. Jonesy and Beav must now do battle with this sewer shark from beyond the stars! It's in the toilet bowl and it wants out! So, of course Jonesy and Beav split up, and the brown bass escapes. Beav is killed and Jonesy encounters an even bigger alien, who promptly enters Jonesy and possesses him. Meanwhile, Henry and Pete crash the truck trying to avoid a woman sitting in the middle of the road. It turns out that she too is ""pregnant"" with a poop monster! Henry leaves the woman with Pete and sets out to get help. Pete drinks about fifty beers, gets plastered, and blithers on to the woman. Unfortunately, Pete doesn't notice that she's fallen over dead and he just keeps talking to her. The impacted parasite she's been carrying around exits her posterior, tunnels through a snowbank, and attacks poor inebriated Pete. Pete fights valiantly, burning the creeping stink-log in the campfire. Back at the cabin, Henry finds the shredded remains of Beav and the hunter and a bizarre fungus growing on everything at an astounding rate. He burns the place to the ground. Enter Morgan Freeman as a crazy army colonel on a mission to eradicate the alien invaders by wiping out anyone who's come in contact with them. Tom Sizemore is the man who must stop Freeman.

Suddenly animals in the forest are running for their lives, and a hunter making strange sounds has come to their camp.  Rick McCarthy seems to be ill, but this guy and his belching is the least of their concerns.  A destiny is revealed, as Duddits link to the realization of an alien force is about to come true.  Snowy Mountains and psychological wars will be waged, and Morgan Freeman plays the captain of a specialized yet somewhat rogue military force that has overtaken the entire area.  There is a lot going on so pay attention, because you might miss the entire point.  The film doesn't do a great job of showing Duddits ultimate connection with everything, but it works okay.  Tom Sizemore also stars as Owen, a member of the military group who realizes that one of the captured hunters (played by Thomas Jane) seems to be able to read his mind, and also seems to be showing him that his commander is out of control.

At times it reminded me of Stand By Me, whereas the bond formed bewteen these boys is central to the story line.You witness several typical experiences of their youth, and much of it is told as flashback storytelling when they are older.  The storytelling takes place in a cabin in the mountains where the men retreat to once a year to keep the bond alive between them. During the flashback storytelling of their youth another character is introduced, i believe his name was Duddits, and he was the a retarded boy at school whom the boys had found being bullied by some of the school pranksters. They run off the pranksters and a friendship is formed between the boys and Duddits.During this particular retreat some event happens in the woods and strange things start to happen. As these guys start to deal with the crisis occuring, we are given more information in flasghback form of strange phenomena occuring in their youth.The guys soon find themselves dealing with a very strange situation and their connections developed throughout childhood becomes central to their struggle through the rest of the story.I thought the movie was very very good, has a subtle twist, and the usual Stephen King odd tone to it. Although its not Kings best,its a quality movie, and good story, and it does deliver all the things i look for from King. Several moments of graphic violence, certain inner demons each of the characters seems to be fighting, and the internal and external struggles are brought to conclusion by the event at hand, and are tied to things that happened in their youth.

First of all, the story's so haphazard and clumsily directed you just give up about a half-way into it. It ain't gonna get any better, and probably will get worse.

One character gets taken over by the aliens and speaks with a British accent so we know it's the alien talking, and we're treated to some illuminating highschool freshman symbolism of his trapped personality looking through a window on the events. Nice. The scene where Jason Lee is sitting on a toilet with a ""butt weasel"" trapped beneath should be frightening, but is just ridiculous. That scene is symptomatic of the whole thing: it goes on too long and is somehow trying for laughs. In lieu of a suspenseful story we get ooze and slime and gore. And more ooze 'n slime 'n gore.

764942,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000AMRUL,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","We've all seen Hollywood ruin some of Stephen King's most engrossing novels, but we can't blame Hollywood too much for this cinematic disaster.  Dreamcatcher is just a lousy story; it pains me to say it, as no one loves and respects Stephen King more than I do, but this has to be the worst story idea that ever came out of his usually brilliant mind.  I'm ashamed to say I have yet to read the actual novel, but it seems pretty clear to me that - assuming the novel actually tells a coherent story with King's usually impressive characterization - it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to transform it into a good movie.  The metaphors this film attempts to emulate die horrible deaths when removed from King's original pages, tempting the viewer to actually laugh at the way they are portrayed onscreen.  If you thought Herman's Head was silly (hey - I actually liked Herman's Head), wait until you how this film handles that whole mindspeak thing.  The harsh, regrettable truth is that Dreamcatcher is just a thoroughly ridiculous movie.We start out with four thirty-something, clearly weird buddies.  Each possesses some kind of gift, such as the ability to read others' minds.  I got the impression they were all some sort of test subjects in a black ops project during their youth.  I was quite wrong about that, as they actually owe their uncommon abilities to their friendship long ago with a mentally challenged young man named Duddits.  The guys all head out to a mountain cabin every winter to think about their good friend, yet none of them has apparently bothered to see or even speak to him in twenty years - uh, OK.  Back in the cabin, the guys have barely begun comparing their individual oddities and exchanging movie trivia when the snow starts to hit the fan.  It begins with a couple of stranded individuals turning up with a nasty rash, and then, before you can say ""I Duddits,"" our main characters find themselves smack dab in the middle of a mysterious military quarantine.  Soon, they're fighting for their lives against nasty, slimy worms with more teeth than they can possibly need.  The worms are actually aliens executing a master plan to take over the world, and - wouldn't you know it - Duddits seemingly tried to warn them about this twenty years ago.  When Mr. Gray shows up about an hour into the film, you can consider the shark thoroughly jumped; from there on out, the whole story is just laughable.Like others before me, I have to wonder why Morgan Freeman (the world's greatest living actor) signed on to this project.  It's not like he had never had a chance to play a sort-of bad guy before, so I can only assume that he didn't read the script before signing the contract.  Freeman is still good, of course (despite the odd fact that his eyebrows are huge for no apparent reason), as are his fellow actors, and I have no complaints about the special effects whatsoever (well, just one - while it's snowing pretty good out there in the woods, there's never any falling snow to be seen in aerial shots of helicopters flying overhead).  All of the wormy aliens look quite real, and there's a fair share of gore to be enjoyed on several occasions.  Dreamcatcher's overwhelming problem is its story.  For one thing, it never really tells us enough about that whole Duddits business - or about the aliens, who have apparently been visiting Earth for at least a quarter of a century.  And that thing with the toothpick?  Well, you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie.  And who drew up such a cumbersome alien invasion plan in the first place?  Any sentient being could have gotten the job done in about five minutes - with five tentacles tied behind his back, no less.  And, just to repeat myself, what is up with these guys never taking a couple of hours to visit Duddits after they grew up?  This is only the person who gave each of them extraordinary abilities, and they all go on and on about how much they love the guy, yet they'd rather drive up to a cabin in the woods every year and think about him than actually trouble themselves to visit or call.Here's the bottom line: Dreamcatcher is just a painfully ridiculous movie.",2,Plays like a really bad April Fool's joke,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,4192,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'ruin', 'Stephen', 'King', 'most', 'engrossing', 'novels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Hollywood', 'too', 'much', 'cinematic', 'disaster', 'Dreamcatcher', 'just', 'lousy', 'story', 'say', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'more', 'do', 'be', 'worst', 'story', 'idea', 'ever', 'came', 'usually', 'brilliant', 'mind', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'say', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'actual', 'novel', 'pretty', 'clear', 'assuming', 'novel', 'actually', 'coherent', 'story', 'King', 'usually', 'impressive', 'characterization', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'transform', 'good', 'movie', 'metaphors', 'film', 'emulate', 'die', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'when', 'removed', 'King', 'original', 'pages', 'tempting', 'viewer', 'actually', 'laugh', 'way', 'are', 'portrayed', 'onscreen', 'thought', 'Herman', 'Head', 'was', 'silly', 'hey', 'actually', 'liked', 'Herman', 'Head', 'wait', 'how', 'film', 'whole', 'mindspeak', 'thing', 'harsh', 'regrettable', 'truth', 'Dreamcatcher', 'just', 'thoroughly', 'ridiculous', 'movie.We', 'start', 'out', 'four', 'thirty-something', 'clearly', 'weird', 'buddies', 'kind', 'gift', 'such', 'ability', 'read', 'others', 'minds', 'got', 'impression', 'were', 'sort', 'test', 'subjects', 'black', 'ops', 'project', 'youth', 'was', 'quite', 'wrong', 'actually', 'owe', 'uncommon', 'abilities', 'friendship', 'long', 'ago', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Duddits', 'guys', 'head', 'out', 'mountain', 'cabin', 'winter', 'think', 'good', 'friend', 'yet', 'none', 'apparently', 'bothered', 'see', 'even', 'speak', 'twenty', 'years', 'uh', 'OK.', 'Back', 'cabin', 'guys', 'have', 'barely', 'begun', 'comparing', 'individual', 'oddities', 'exchanging', 'movie', 'trivia', 'when', 'snow', 'hit', 'fan', 'couple', 'stranded', 'individuals', 'turning', 'up', 'nasty', 'rash', 'then', 'can', 'say', 'Duddits', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'mysterious', 'military', 'quarantine', 'Soon', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'lives', 'nasty', 'slimy', 'worms', 'more', 'teeth', 'can', 'possibly', 'need', 'worms', 'are', 'actually', 'aliens', 'executing', 'master', 'plan', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'seemingly', 'tried', 'warn', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Gray', 'up', 'hour', 'film', 'can', 'consider', 'shark', 'thoroughly', 'jumped', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'laughable.Like', 'others', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'world', 'greatest', 'living', 'actor', 'signed', 'project', 'not', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'play', 'sort-of', 'bad', 'guy', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'script', 'signing', 'contract', 'Freeman', 'still', 'good', 'course', 'odd', 'fact', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'huge', 'apparent', 'reason', 'are', 'fellow', 'actors', 'have', 'complaints', 'special', 'effects', 'well', 'just', 'one', 'snowing', 'pretty', 'good', 'there', 'woods', 'never', 'falling', 'snow', 'be', 'seen', 'aerial', 'shots', 'helicopters', 'flying', 'overhead', 'wormy', 'look', 'quite', 'real', 'fair', 'share', 'gore', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'occasions', 'Dreamcatcher', 'overwhelming', 'problem', 'story', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'really', 'enough', 'whole', 'Duddits', 'business', 'aliens', 'who', 'have', 'apparently', 'been', 'visiting', 'Earth', 'least', 'quarter', 'century', 'thing', 'toothpick', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'see', 'movie', 'who', 'drew', 'up', 'such', 'cumbersome', 'alien', 'invasion', 'plan', 'first', 'place', 'sentient', 'being', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'job', 'done', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'five', 'tentacles', 'tied', 'back', 'less', 'just', 'repeat', 'what', 'up', 'guys', 'never', 'taking', 'couple', 'hours', 'visit', 'Duddits', 'grew', 'up', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'gave', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'guy', 'yet', ""'d"", 'rather', 'drive', 'up', 'cabin', 'woods', 'year', 'think', 'actually', 'trouble', 'visit', 'call.Here', 'bottom', 'line', 'Dreamcatcher', 'just', 'painfully', 'ridiculous', 'movie']",N/A
764943,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0000AMRUL,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[7, 10]","(NOTE: I highly recommend preparing yourself for ""Dreamcatchers"" by eating a hardy Mexican dinner of bean burritos and perhaps some chili relleno before watching the film. It will heighten your viewing experience.)Watching once-talented director Lawrence Kasdan's film adaptation of Stephen King's ""Dreamcatcher"" is like giving yourself a lobotomy. When the closing credits for ""Dreamcatcher"" rolled, I had three initial thoughts:1) Morgan Freeman must *really* have owed Kasdan a favor;2) ""Dreamcatcher"" is definitely *not* a chick flick;3) I actually lost IQ points while watching ""Dreamcatcher"";And that, for me, explains its perverse appeal---it's a kind of of manifestation of twisted alien evil genius. This movie may actually be Evil.So here's my advice: go grab this ugly abomination of a thing, plop it in the ol' hopper, watch the first 35 minutes, and then you're all done. If you rented it, take it back. If you bought it, burn it.But let's talk about ""Dreamcatcher"", which is based on Stephen King's novel (which, when I read it, seemed to positively scream out for a movie adaptation). I feel comfortable saying this: the movie is better than the book.The Plot, very quickly: four old friends get together at a remote cabin in the Maine backwoods for their annual reunion, basically to hunt, drink, get bleary-eyed from drinking, and tell fart jokes. They are: a used-car salesman, a suicidal psychiatrist, a college professor, and a novelist. They all share a deep-dark secret, something to do with the---ah---severely intellectually challenged Duddits(played by Donnie Wahlberg in a method acting appearance).It's not that deep or dark of a secret, and frankly it's really not all that interesting. Trust me, you won't care. Indeed, it was only when ""Dreamcatcher"" started to flash back to the friends' youth (all played by horrible, wooden child actors who scream out for instant obliteration) that I began to want to beat something to death with a stick.Anyway, two of the friends make a beer run into ""town"", while the other two go hunting in the spooky wintry woods surrounding the cabin.Jonesy (Damien Lewis) happens across a hunter, who introduces himself as Rick McCarthy (Eric Keenleyside in the role of a lifetime) and claims he's lost from his hunting party. Jonesy leads McCarthy back to the gang's cabin (called ""Hole in the Wall"", a name which has far deeper resonance as the flick progresses---you'll see). McCarthy is afflicted with reddish, suppurating flesh-wounds, a bloated stomach, and possibly gangrenous flatulence. Oh, and he needs to use the toilet. BAD. Fun ensues.Indeed, the next 30 minutes of the movie are so horrific, so awful, so hideous, so gory, and so glorious (if you're a sick evil twisted gorehound like me), that they almost excuse whatever nonsense comes afterwards.Basically: Rick McCarthy is about to serve as a handmaiden for one of the Galaxy's Deep Dark Secrets. I remember, years ago, that Alien 3 ran with the tagline ""This time, evil is in the most terrifying place of all."" Nope, I'm afraid they didn't get that right---but ""Dreamcatcher"" nails it right on the money. Evil *is* in the most terrifying place of all: right in the putooshta.Naturally, this being a flick based on the work of Stephen King, Evil gets out---and boy does it get out. Again, the filming of the sequence where Beaver Clarenden (Jason Lee, who comes and goes) and Jonesy confront King Toilet, is so repugnant, so horrid, so putrid, that I actually watched the infernal thing through my hands. It's so deranged that I feel forced to tip my hat to ""Dreamcatcher"", and give this scene alone, red in tooth and claw and posterior as it is, two whole stars.But that's as good as it gets. ""Dreamcatcher"" could have been a contender. It has top-drawer acting talent topped off with some competent unknowns. It has Kasdan at the helm. It goes off material by horror grandmaster King. It has monsters whose method of entry into the world alone makes you cringe. And that isolated cabin and those spooky woods---ah, what could have been.Anyway, the rest of the movie is a pretty conventional by-the-numbers alien infestation/contamination/military quarantine movie, and the film gets stupider by the second. Just watching the thing after the Last Stand at the OK Toilet scene will cost you brain cells.Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman are wasted on stock characters that are so wooden you wonder why Kasdan even bothered writing lines for them. I'm getting bored even writing about it. Just watch the first 35 minutes, quarantine the area, nuke the site from orbit, and *never* talk to strangers---to say nothing of letting them use your bathroom---when you're out alone in the spooky Maine woods.JSG",2,So this Alien and four Hunters go into a bar...,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,4726,"['NOTE', 'highly', 'recommend', 'preparing', 'Dreamcatchers', 'eating', 'hardy', 'Mexican',

Like all his books/movies, he takes an ordinary event and twists it to something original and supernatural.  This movie remains one of the more unique works filmed.  Its plot, which ties to one another smoothly, was written creatively.  The writers offer the audience many unexpected twists and turns that keep their eyes wide open anxiously awaiting for what will happen next.  Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Donnie Wahlberg, and many others act their roles wonderfully.  The special effects, especially the alien make-up and the design, were crafted realistic-looking, giving &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; the added scary effect.

But as I started watching it, I said this is like STAND BY ME meets ALIENS.  Should have been a clue since most of King's ideas are derivative from old Twilight Zones and 50s horror movies, that his time he rippled off himself and merged that with Aliens and came out with a ""New"" not so new idea.That said, I went in without reading King's book, so I judged the movie solely on the movie, so I don't have that colouring my reactions.  First off, I like King, but I do not like EVERYTHING he does.  So for me to REALLY like this movie tells you something...maybe hehehe.  This is not original. It's the Stand by Me Gang being nice and rescuing Dougie - ""Duddit"", from the school bullies who were torturing him.  The five of them remain close all their lives - and Duddit changes them so they can read each others thoughts and one can wiggle his finger and find missing things.Cut to a night when Duddit is going home and he walks into traffic and get hits.  Six months later, the fab four are at the ""hole in the wall"" their cabin in the hills.  It's snowing and something very stranger (not so strange if you saw John Hurt giving birth! in Alien) is happening to people in the small mountain community.From that point on, it's our pack of pals against the worm creatures and a crazed Morgan Freeman, head of para-military group from the government who has been fighting the alien invasion for last 20 years - Gee same time as Duddit and the Pals have been bonded.Nothing fresh, yet at the same time it's rather imaginative.  So if you liked Stand by Men, the Dark Half and Aliens, get out the blender and enjoy this wild ride!  It will keep you on the edge of the set.It works.

The scare tactics are obvious and clich&eacute;, awkward script equates to characters delivering awkward lines, and the plot gets sillier and sillier that I'm not sure if Lawrence Kasdan is simply toying with me or not.  He probably isn't, given his quite nature after the film's release, which makes the movie even more amusing.  It made me wish this film had more wacky moments spread out to abstain its boring serious nature.The story is about four buddies who can read minds, although one can also find directions by wigging his finger and the other can also manifest his own mind as a library; they acquired their abilities from a mentally-challenged kid named Duddits back when they were children, fending off bullies by threatening bullies to call their parents.  One of the buddies, Jonesy (Damian Lewis), got ran over by a car because he walking towards what he thought he saw the ghost of Duddits from across the street; he died, but then he didn't, and six months later he and his pals bunk in a cabin at Alaska for some reason.  Eventually, the buddies would be under great threats by a quarantined military unit led by an irrational Morgan Freeman, an extraterrestrial smoke that infected humans into crapping flesh-eating leeches, and a lead alien named Mr. Gray that can control a person's body and give it a Cockney accent.I could talk about just how stupid the characters acted for important dire situations, how the story elements draw a thin line between convenient and absurdity, how it made that stupid sharp 'woosh' effect whenever someone puts on their hoodie, and how insensitive to have a special kid be 'special' for an unironic reason, but the ideas of 'leeches coming out of a human's sphincter' and 'Cockney-accented alien' made me giggle.  If anyone plans on viewing ""Dreamcatcher"", don't see it for the sci-fi/horror element because that was a weak effort.  Watch it for its unintended goofiness, like people crying out for a guy named Beaver, seeingSeth Bullockget his crotch bitten by an alien leech, and Mr. Gray; Mr. Gray in possessed mode was a riot because of how silly he acted, not to mentioned made some of the most hilarious facial expressions I ever saw.

Jason Lee sounds embarrassed to be spouting his horrible dialogue, Tom Sizemore is just glad his role is a supporting character who dies before the end of the story, and Morgan Freeman is simply desperate for any role to take on such putrid filth.  Then there are the child actors who were cast because they look right for their parts regardless of the fact none of them can act at all.  This story is a supernatural-sci-fi-horror yarn about an alien invasion by worm-like creatures that gestate in the bowels of animals until it is time for them to lay eggs.  The scenario involves tainting the Boston water supply with alien parasites.  Okay, fine.  The alien craft that is shown at one point is huge and obviously technically superior to anything we measly humans could create so why hasn't the invasion succeeded?  Why not just crash a parasite-laden alien ship into Lake Michigan and begin with Chicago instead?  I suppose Boston is closer to Stephen King's home in Maine so the story should be close by.  The plot is plainly stupid.  I cannot believe the once great Lawrence Kasdan was at all involved in this film, let alone responsible for the screenplay, production, and direction.

I have been unimpressed by most of his recent (5-10 years) stuff. But the book was a pleasant way to kill some winter hours. The video was impressively true to the book. There are only two scenes I can think of that were missing from the movie, that were in the book (I'm sure there are more but I don't remember them): the approval of Duddits' mom from the get-go (in the movie we don't meet her until the end) and when Mr. Gray stops in a diner to eat for the first time in a human body (would have been a great scene).I think the movie was a good adaptation of a so-so/weird book.

764961,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0000AMRUL,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","There are some Stephen King books that should never be adapted. Sure, we got a movie where an evil car kills people, or a girl kills people through telekinesis, or a mist filled with killer bugs who kill people, or Jack Nicholson... does exactly what his evil smile promises he'd do. Odd premises, but they work.But a story where flatulence, burping and aliens that spawn from your rectum are major plot points? Uh... no.And yet that movie exists: &#34;Dreamcatcher,&#34; a gross, befuddling sci-fi tale based on a book written when its author was on so many painkillers that he probably thought he could fly. It's an unsettling yet bizarrely unsatisfying story that mishmashes King tropes, '90s conspiracy tropes, and a spectacularly underused cast of brilliant actors giving weird, weird performances. And yes, that includes the furry aliens masquerading as Morgan Freeman's eyebrows.Old friends Jonesy (Damian Lewis), Beaver (Jason Lee), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Henry (Thomas Jane) all acquired telepathy as children, after saving a mentally-disabled kid named Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg). They now use their telepathy in the most OBVIOUS WAYS EVER in their mundane jobs... except Timothy. He uses it to pull girls.Eventually they decide to have a boys-club weekend at a snowy cabin, but their fun is interrupted by a pair of people whom they find in the wilderness... who are farting and belching. A lot. This is actually significant. They also have red marks on their skin, which are also afflicting the local animals. Then they excrete lamprey-like monsters with razor-sharp teeth -- and one of the aliens (who seems to be British) decides to possess Jonesy.Meanwhile, the area has been quarantined by Curtis (Morgan Freeman and a pair of mutated dust bunnies), a crazy military guy who disposes of alien invasions and likes to shoot his own men. With Jonesy's body is possessed by perkily malevolent Mr. Grey, who plans to conquer the planet with butt-invading spawn, his surviving friends must team up with a rogue soldier to save the planet. Also, Duddits is involved.King sold the rights to &#34;Dreamcatcher&#34; for a dollar, and I can see why: this plot really feels like it was written by someone hopped up on powerful drugs. The story feels like it was mashed together out of two or three vaguely-related ones, with no logical direction for any of them to go. Stripping off the military subplot might have actually made this movie better, since it would have reduced the running time and eliminated a lot of the filleresque material.Even better: we have a long list of Kingsian tropes, like magical mentally-disabled kids, psychic powers, wacky aliens and mysterious &#34;X-Filesian&#34; government agencies. At times, it feels like a parody of a King movie.But I'm not letting Lawrence Kasdan off the hook; his writing and direction are almost as bizarre as the plotting. The dialogue is elliptical, rambling and almost code-like (&#34;I've heard some mighty burps in my time, but that's the blue ribbon baby&#34;) and sometimes has running gags or exposition that go on FOREVER (Timothy talking about priapism).And not only is the movie bloated and overcrammed with subplots, but Kasdan does some things that are... just inexplicable. For instance, there is a whoosh sound effect whenever Jonesy/Grey pulls up his hood. Why? No reason. For another, there is an utterly baffling scene where Jonesy PHONES one of his friends... by using the phone in his memory warehouse. Oh yes, the memory warehouse -- aka the memory centers of Jonesy's brain -- is treated as an actual structure under his conscious control. Again, powerful drugs.One peculiar thing about this movie is how awful the performances are, even though almost everyone in it is a respected, excellent actor -- Freeman, Lewis, Lee, Jane, and so on. All their performances are mesmerizingly WEIRD and slightly off-kilter. It feels almost as if the actors were all kidnapped from their homes, woke up on the set with no idea what they're doing, decided to just run with it... and then discovered that the movie was about poop lampreys.Lewis is particularly odd. Oh, he gives the same peculiar confused performance as the other cast members... but then Jonesy gets possessed by Mr. Grey. He starts acting like a really camp, completely psychotic Malcolm McDowell. It's like Lewis realized what a wretched movie he was, and decided to just have fun with it.&#34;Dreamcatcher&#34; is... a mesmerizing movie. While it utterly fails in almost every way -- acting, directing, writing -- the result is so utterly, bafflingly STRANGE that it's impossible to stop watching.",1,Out in the woods alone,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,4641,"['are', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'adapted', 'Sure', 'got', 'movie', 'where', 'evil', 'car', 'kills', 'people', 'girl', 'kills', 'people', 'telekinesis', 'mist', 'filled', 'killer', 'bugs', 'who', 'kill', 'people', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'exactly', 'what', 'evil', 'smile', ""'d"", 'do', 'Odd', 'work.But', 'story', 'where', 'flatulence', 'burping', 'spawn', 'rectum', 'are', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'Uh', 'no.And', 'yet', 'movie', 'exists', '34', 'Dreamcatcher', '34', 'gross', 'befuddling', 'sci-fi', 'tale', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'when', 'author', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'painkillers', 'probably', 'thought', 'could', 'fly', 'unsettling', 'yet', 'bizarrely', 'unsatisfying', 'story', 'King', 'tropes', 'conspiracy', 'tropes', 'spectacularly', 'underused', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'giving', 'weird', 'weird', 'performances', 'yes', 'furry', 'masquerading', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'eyebrows.Old', 'friends', 'Jonesy', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Beaver', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Pete', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'acquired', 'telepathy', 'children', 'saving', 'mentally-disabled', 'kid', 'named', 'Duddits', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'now', 'use', 'telepathy', 'most', 'OBVIOUS', 'WAYS', 'EVER', 'mundane', 'jobs', 'Timothy', 'pull', 'girls.Eventually', 'decide', 'have', 'boys-club', 'weekend', 'snowy', 'cabin', 'fun', 'interrupted', 'pair', 'people', 'whom', 'find', 'wilderness', 'who', 'are', 'farting', 'belching', 'lot', 'actually', 'significant', 'also', 'have', 'red', 'marks', 'skin', 'are', 'also', 'afflicting', 'local', 'animals', 'Then', 'excrete', 'lamprey-like', 'monsters', 'razor-sharp', 'teeth', 'one', 'aliens', 'who', 'be', 'British', 'possess', 'Jonesy.Meanwhile', 'area', 'been', 'quarantined', 'Curtis', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'pair', 'mutated', 'dust', 'bunnies', 'crazy', 'military', 'guy', 'who', 'alien', 'invasions', 'likes', 'shoot', 'own', 'men', 'Jonesy', 'body', 'possessed', 'perkily', 'malevolent', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'who', 'conquer', 'planet', 'butt-invading', 'spawn', 'surviving', 'friends', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'rogue', 'soldier', 'save', 'planet', 'Also', 'Duddits', 'involved.King', 'sold', 'rights', '34', 'Dreamcatcher', '34', 'dollar', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'plot', 'really', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'hopped', 'up', 'powerful', 'drugs', 'story', 'feels', 'was', 'mashed', 'together', 'two', 'three', 'vaguely-related', 'ones', 'logical', 'direction', 'go', 'Stripping', 'off', 'military', 'subplot', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'reduced', 'running', 'time', 'eliminated', 'lot', 'filleresque', 'material.Even', 'better', 'have', 'long', 'list', 'Kingsian', 'tropes', 'magical', 'mentally-disabled', 'kids', 'psychic', 'powers', 'wacky', 'aliens', 'mysterious', '34', 'X-Filesian', '34', 'government', 'agencies', 'times', 'parody', 'King', 'movie.But', ""'m"", 'not', 'letting', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'hook', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'bizarre', 'plotting', 'dialogue', 'elliptical', 'rambling', 'almost', 'code-like', '34', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'mighty', 'burps', 'time', 'blue', 'ribbon', 'baby', '34', 'sometimes', 'running', 'gags', 'exposition', 'go', 'FOREVER', 'Timothy', 'talking', 'priapism', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'bloated', 'overcrammed', 'subplots', 'Kasdan', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'inexplicable', 'instance', 'whoosh', 'sound', 'effect', 'whenever', 'Jonesy/Grey', 'up', 'hood', 'Why', 'reason', 'utterly', 'baffling', 'scene', 'where', 'Jonesy', 'PHONES', 'one', 'friends', 'using', 'phone', 'memory', 'warehouse', 'Oh', 'yes', 'memory', 'warehouse', 'memory', 'centers', 'Jonesy', 'brain', 'treated', 'actual', 'structure', 'conscious', 'control', 'Again', 'powerful', 'drugs.One', 'peculiar', 'thing', 'movie', 'how', 'awful', 'performances', 'are', 'even', 'almost', 'everyone', 'respected', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Freeman', 'Lewis', 'Lee', 'Jane', 'so', 'performances', 'are', 'mesmerizingly', 'WEIRD', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'almost', 'actors', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'homes', 'woke', 'up', 'set', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'decided', 'just', 'run', 'then', 'discovered', 'movie', 'was', 'poop', 'lampreys.Lewis', 'particularly', 'odd', 'Oh', 'same', 'peculiar', 'confused', 'performance', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'then', 'Jonesy', 'possessed', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'acting', 'really', 'camp', 'completely', 'psychotic', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Lewis', 'realized', 'what', 'wretched', 'movie', 'was', 'decided', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'it.', '34', 'Dreamcatcher', '34', 'mesmerizing', 'movie', 'utterly', 'almost', 'way', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'result', 'so', 'utterly', 'bafflingly', 'STRANGE', 'impossible', 'stop', 'watching']",N/A
764962,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0000AMRUL,Einsatz,"[0, 2]","In unequal parts, this movie is an abbreviated coming of age story, a cabin in the woods tale of horror, aliens on the loose (everyone run screaming), and bringing up the rear a crazy military internment camp scenario that may or may not include mass extermination.  If that sounds like an unworkable premise for one film to manage or maintain for 134 minutes, then you would be correct.  Dreamcatcher is just that, a cartwheeling monstrosity that is consistently out of control.  It&#8217;s an ill-fated hodgepodge of several genres, none of which is dealt with long enough to prove a successful meld.  Worse.  At any given time, the story is abruptly reset to any given time; it jumps around obnoxiously just as something starts to produce a germ of interest.  20 years, 6 months, it makes no difference to this story; it will go where the writers drag us.  Ultimately, it lacks focus and a judicious editing job.  Muddled is the kindest term I can think of to apply to this unfortunate mess.  And then there&#8217;s the acting.  For the most part, everyone does quite well with the roles they got stuck with.  With the exception of Damian Lewis as Gary &#8220;Jonesy&#8221; Jones, part time American, part time British servant serving the alien Mr. Grey.  I don&#8217;t mind that Lewis utilized his own accent; it&#8217;s just that by doing so he conjured up a contradictory aspect of the menacing aliens.  These formidable aliens are depicted as toothy, slimy, stalk-like beings in their natural form.  Why would they then go all wild eyed, resorting to that aching clich&eacute; of villainy, a perpetual goofy smile, when they&#8217;ve taken up residence in a human?  Why would aliens affect a British accent and the persona of a lunatic?  The results weren&#8217;t scary they were absurdly ludicrous, worthy of a cringe or two.  It was bad choices that doomed this production, and not a little hubris on Stephen King&#8217;s part, caught bragging during a bonus feature that he dared to take this story somewhere stories normally didn&#8217;t venture: the bathroom.

764964,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B0000AMRUL,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[3, 4]","Well, ok - I can't. But before I start, I'll try to just review the film on its own merits. The ride is suspenseful in many places, the computer-generated visuals are very, very good, and the plot is sufficiently complex enough to keep most folks entertained. The trouble is, they had to hack so much of the plot in order to keep the movie to a reasonable time period, we've lost so very much in the translation. Doh, I'm talking about the book already. Ok, back up.As the film opens, 4 life-long friends all phone each other in short periods of time, each one sensing that something's amiss, and they're all thinking of their childhood friend, a Down's Syndrome boy named Douglas (&quot;Duddits&quot; &quot;Dudds&quot; as they all call him.) One such phone call interrupts a suicide attempt by a friend, and another call issues a warning to a different friend. &quot;Be careful,&quot; says Beaver to Jonesy. &quot;Of what?&quot; Jonesy inquires. &quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Beav responds. Moments later, Jonesy is hit by a car, and gravely injured.The film picks up 6 months later, at a hunting lodge in the woods where they have gathered for the last 20 years. A huge, beautiful dreamcatcher hangs in the living room, and is a symbol representing the five friends and their special bond. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn how the four boys met Duddits and became his best friends, and how he imbued them with special gifts. The flashbacks are very similar to &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; as King notes in the interview, and Jonsey's injury mirrors King's own after he was hit by a van while walking.Back to the story, as two of the friends (Pete and Henry)leave the lodge to go pick up beer, things being to go horribly awry. Jonesy nearly shoots a man who claims to have been lost and wandering in the woods overnight, and takes him in to give him shelter and food. The man's stomach is enormous, and he has the worst case of gas ever recorded. Pete and Henry nearly run over a woman sitting in the road, and flip their truck many times as it leaves the snowy road. Pete breaks his leg in the process, and Henry must go for help alone.Things go downhill for the men from there. The hunter and the woman are both infected with alien larvae, which burst out in a most unpleasant manner, and are armed with razor-sharp teeth and a grasping, sharp tail. Jonesy becomes infected with the alien &quot;birus,&quot; a reddish dust-like substance which is how the alien race procreates. As all of this is happening, we begin to meet the military personnel stationed in the area. As it happens, a huge mothership crashed nearby the cabin, and the whole area is under quarrantine.I can't go into any more of the plot without revealing far too much, so I'll go back to the book. The ending is suspenseful, though not as suspenseful as the book's. Further, the screenplay writers sacrifice far too much in the translation from book to film - the magic of the journey is almost entirely lost. The first 20 minutes are quite true to the original text, and then everything takes a big left turn, and in my opinion, not in a good way at all. Duddits isn't just a special boy, he's got an entirely other purpose that had nothing to do with the original story. We don't hear much of the internal dialogue between Jonesy and Mr. Gray, the alien possessing his mind and body. Several key elements have been eliminated or changed, and it all comes down to this - the story is much more shallow and compact, and in the end, it feels like we've missed a lot of the story. Turns out, we have! While most of the basics are true to the book, the details are gone, and the stuff they did change is just...ick. Doesn't work, at least not for me.I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoyed the movie, as it will give SO much more detail and back-story, and is minus the incredibly hokey ending &quot;plot twist.&quot; The book is magical, the movie is mediocre. Entertaining, interesting, and surprising ... just not &quot;WOWSERS.&quot; Make sense?As for the movie, it's not something I'm likely to watch again, but I did enjoy it for the most part. The DVD extras are good - there's an interview with Stephen King, some behind-the-scenes footage, some deleted scenes (with alternate ending) and a very funny outtake involving Henry and Duddits, in which Donnie Wahlberg (Dudds) breaks character after Thomas Jayne (Henry) goes off-script and interrogates him in a ridiculously funny way during an urgent moment. I wish there had been more outtakes like that. :-)I suspect this is another case of a brilliant King story hacked to death to make it &quot;fit&quot; into preconceived notions of what people want to see, and in the process of doing that, they gutted the story so badly that we don't come to care for the characters very much.

There are a lot of problems, especially around the lot being motivated primarily by characters being appallingly stupid.  Some unclear plot points could have been developed better in place of long, drawn-out scenes of characters making obviously extremely bad choices in improbable ways.I could rant for awhile about the characters juggling the idiot ball and how doubly-absurd it was, given the unique talents they exhibit at all other times.  But it stood out mainly because everything else was done so very well.  I actually liked the characters, some of the concrete representations of very abstract ideas were great, the special effects (which are not something I generally get excited over) were actually really, really good.  Some parts were a bit predictable, but not in a really annoying way, except where it was someone being predictably stupid/misguided to the point you want to reach through the screen and smack them.MINIMALLY SPOILER-Y WARNINGS:I'd say it's definitely worthwhile, although it definitely has some gore and grossout parts.  They weren't as bad/explicit as I was expecting, and there was very little &#34;suddenly jumping out of the dark&#34; type horror.  If you can't stand parasites/infections/etc you probably don't want to see this, however.

So when this film was being advertised I was all excited about it. I had really enjoyed the book and this film would have two of my favorite actors in it, Jason Lee and of course Morgan Freeman. So I waited for it to come out, I was living in Maryland at the time and a friend of mine up there was really wanting to see it as well. So when it was first released we went to check it out. After it was over we walked out a little disappointed, she more than I but it was ok.The film follows a group of friends who have some extraordinary abilities, abilities given to them by a childhood friend named Duddits. Every year they meet up to go on a hunting trip but this may be the last year they are able to do so. Duddits may have always been more than what he seemed and was preparing them for something coming, something involving a Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey himself may very well be from a different planet, but then again others may be as well.This movie had great production value and was backed by a studio so going in a really thought that they were going to do it right. Add in that the writers and director had worked on previous King features like ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and the excellent ""Misery"". Then of course there was the cast, all of them names that have been recognized as some of the best you could get. Then of course there is the fact that it is based on a Stephen King book. All of that together should have in my opinion equaled something classic.Of course I am sure you can tell that I didn't think it reached that level, and I can tell you exactly why. That reason is the military/alien invasion portions of the film, for some reason I felt they were not done properly. Don't get me wrong I thought Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore were really good her. In fact I loved seeing Freeman as a villain and Tom was really really good here. Still even with that and the effects looking good it just didn't feel right.What I can tell you that was done right was the ""It"" style of the group of friends. Meaning the present as adults and flashbacks as kids were excellent. I don't know maybe it is because I like the dynamic amongst the friends or just felt that this half of the story was the strongest. Speaking of that I must say that the group as kids are excellent and are very believable in the roles, much like the ones on ""It"". Also as adults I enjoyed everyone here; Jason Lee was the comedic relief which made sense. I liked his little Beaverisims and the toothpick thing of course, which comes into play during one of my favorite scenes. That of course is the bathroom scene, great moment. Then we have Thomas Jane, Tim Olyphant, and the deuce performance of Damian Lewis as the other members of the group. Each one of them bring something great to the film and all four are a part of my favorite side of the story. Also Duddits as an adult is the excellent Donnie Wahlberg who once again does a great job.I think I didn't like the invasion and military side of the film because it didn't feel as big or epic here in the film. Same can be said with the ending we get in the film; I won't ruin it but read the book first. Over all I thought the movie was good and half of it was strong while the other just wasn't there. The DVD comes with some behind the scenes stuff among other features; I just wish it would have had a commentary.

764967,AY12DBB0U420B,B0000AMRUL,Gary Peterson,"[2, 4]","Last night I watched ""Dreamcatcher."" It was a dreadful movie and I could hardly wait for it to end. Just look at the numbers it got in the Amazon rankings. One star is the greatest category, by far! Well, that would be my feeling except that the movie is rather well done and the photography is splendid. Same with a lot of the individual scenes. It's a movie that has received a lot of care. It's definitely not a cheapie B movie that was completed in a month. I'm going to give it a two, even through I feel  that's rather generous.Sorry, but I'm a scientist by training and that's the way I think about everything. I've always had trouble enjoying most science fiction and fantasy movies in that I just automatically recognize them to be drivel. There are exceptions. For example, some high-action movies are fun to watch, not for the story but for the action and animations.  I greatly enjoy Star Trek things. Sure, they're drivel, but they're droll tongue-in-cheek stuff that can be fine entertainment. Well, ""Dreamcatcher"" isn't. How else can I put it? It's a bunch of nonsense strung together into a horror movie. Is it scary? Yes, in places. Who wouldn't jump when a slime-covered snake-like creature jumps out and attempts to latch on? Well, there's a lot of stuff like this in the movie and I suppose an audience would scream. But I watched it in my living room and I just rolled my eyes in disbelief. The story has to do with the discovery of these space aliens in rural New England and the attempt to quarantine and destroy them. Yaawwwnnnn! Sorry, it's a long movie and I get bored even thinking about it. To make the story even more difficult to comprehend, there's a lot of bouncing around from the present to various times in the past. Groan. When you're already bored to tears, this just makes a difficult-to-understand movie even more so. Who knows?

I don't understand what the director and writers and producers were thinking when they penned that.  ""Hmm, we obviously can't use the King ending--it's heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time and actually wraps up the story in a manner that makes sense.  We can't have that.""  I hope SK got a big paycheck to look the other way because they really took a d*mp on his work.I do believe part of the problem is that SK's dialogue often doesn't transfer well to the big screen.  Verbatim tidbits that I remember from the novel coming out of the actor's mouths often fell flat.I give two stars for the things the movie does well.  The gestating weasel and subsequent bathroom scene was very well done.  The cabin as it gets covered with spores is also great.  Actually, most of the first act material is pretty decent (aside from the casting), plus the library/office stuff inside the main character's head.  If you haven't read the book, your chances of enjoyment are much greater, and I could possibly see this as a decent monster/action time passer.

764976,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B0000AMRUL,H. Jin,"[6, 8]","Someone at my local movie group suggested this movie be re-titled ""Earth Versus the Arse-Monsters"". The idea was that such a stupid title would give the movie an appropriate cheesy B-grade air, allowing us to enjoy it on a so-bad-it's-almost-good basis. A movie called 'Dreamcatcher' based on a novel by someone the calibre of Stephen King just makes it all seem too serious.I think the big problem with this movie is that it's full of ideas that don't translate that well to the screen. For example, the ""memory warehouse"" works alot better as an abstact thought from a book. Seeing them depict an actual warehouse filled with physical memories that the character searches through comes across as silly instead of mysterious. Likewise, the concept of aliens breeding inside people's intestines could be horrific or disturbing, but actually seeing people exploding blood and flatulence from their backsides is just corny.It doesn't help that there were some very strange artistic decisions made here. Why the toothpick on the floor? Why the gun-telephone?? Why does Jonesy talk like a demented English butler when possessed?? What's with the eyebrows? There are just too many of these unintentionally funny moments that distract us. Likewise, the random gore, the often cheesy dialogue, and the cliched characterisation are more suited to a teen slasher flick than the supposedly serious movie this tries to be.To me, it appears the filmakers were uncertain whether to remain loyal to King's deeper, intellectual story or just go for a straight thriller/horror flick. In the end 'Dreamcatcher' doesn't really do either. It's too unintentionally silly and corny to take seriously, but too po-faced and self-conscious to be enjoyed as a mindless popcorn slasher. The fact that it can't appeal to either audience is obviously why it flopped. Perhaps it might have been better in a different format, but I feel 'Dreamcatcher' is one of those books that just doesn't work on the big screen.

The novel was long, subtle, full of details and developments. The film is too short, too simple and onesided, lacking too many details. We do not understand the deep political problem behind these military special forces that try to take over the US and are defeated by their very American prisoners just before these could be executed by those special forces, because all that is missing in the film. Here what we guess are the regular armed forces come in and wipe out the nest of fascistic soldiers. Sorry folks, the film does not believe in democracy and the right to rebel against the invader, even and especially if this invader is from inside. Was it not politically correct in 2003 to imagine some fascistic armed forces could take over the government of the USA ? Then the fact that the leader, the  boss , of these special military forces that are ready to kill Americans to save THEIR America, is black takes a very regrettable taste, flavor and perfume. In one word it stinks. The film is replacing the magic of the words and the entertwining levels of consciousness in the characters and among the characters with special effects but special effects will never be multifarious enough to embody the whole forest of imagination. We are reduced to a couple of trees, at best, if not only half a dozen of shrubs that are nothing but dwarf-trees. The rest then is unclear and in this shortened and simplified version it appears to be a paranoid approach of non-human life from outside earth dressed in the garb of worms with plenty of teeth, E.T.s with two big yellow eyes and other aliens laying eggs by the dozen if not the thousand, in other words gibberish 3-D robotized animated plastic models of common and standard visions of what monsters could look like. It is in many ways regrettable because the book, which is not one of the best by Stephen King, is a lot more interesting and even gripping and thrilling. Why on earth does Stephen King need to sell the rights of his books and short stories to people who do not have the intellectual, imaginarial and financial means to make great films out of them ?

You're shown in gory, explicit detail how the alien emerges from human into our world. And oh, yeahhhh, it comes with sound effects, too. Somehow, the script jumps to a childhood sequence where our fab five use their extrasensory powers and discover a missing girl. &quot;Jonesy&quot; is the appalling, &quot;cute&quot; little misfit that only a mother--or in this case--our fab four could love. He was so smart-assy neurotic that I could understand why the bullies wanted to beat the hell out of him. And Morgan Freeman! What an embarassment! It looks like he walked through his scenes to just collect that multi-million dollar paycheck. He has one expression that looks carved on his face: Pissed-Off! While watching this endless junk I kept thinking of its $80-100 million dollar price tag. And then I thought of the great cult horror films that were made for peanuts: &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; ($32,000 budget) &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; ($74,000); &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; ($65,000)&quot;Halloween&quot; ($55,000).

Then it quickly turns into sci-fi/horror film when it would've worked better if it  was more like Starman. I mean Damian Lewis, Jason Lee, Thomas Jane, Timothy Olyphant are all charming in their roles and it would've been better if you had all 4 of them together through-out the movie. Instead their characters scatter apart early in the movie and is only one scene of them all together as grown-ups.They have a sweet relationship with a retarded kid. He gives them all the power to read minds and to use their fingers to locate stuff by just...twirling their fingers. I think the retarded kid was supposed to be an alien or something. The script throws so much in one movie it's hard to follow it all. Would've worked better as a mini-series on ABC possibly.The friends come across people who have bad gas and their stomachs are bulging out. The reaction on the friends faces as these people let go a few is funny. Timothy Olyphant's expressions are best. I liked him the most in this movie and sadly they don't do as much with his character as they could've. After seeing him in (Scream 2 and Go) I've been a fan of his and his potential of being a big star is wasted here. As they could've done so much more with him.Anyway they find people with bad gas and turns out they have aliens inside them who exit through their behinds. So yes the movie falls apart there. It's a shame because the film has times when it's fascinating and if they kept those 4 friends together through the whole movie it would've been a lot better. Cut out the aliens and throw in a plot with 4 friends trying to save the world from anything but aliens who live in buttocks and it would've been good.Oh yeah the leader alien inhabbits Damian Lewis and makes him talk with this John Cleese like english accent....I know scary. On top of that Morgan Freeman is actually bad in a movie. He plays this crazy general who is just laughable and hard to take serious. He's much better at playing a sweet warm-hearted guy than he is as a bad guy and I hope he learned from his mistake with Dreamcatcher.

Also the relationship between Mr. Grey and dudditts needed to be given a whole lot more as well...the movie kept hinting at a relationship between the two..and you never really know...even when it ends really what it was.  I won't say anymore on that point to save the movie for those that haven't seen it.I however did think the premise/story was very good, one of the best parts in the movie for me atleast was when the animals all started running away...that was just freaky.  Grizzlies, stag deer, rabbits, squirells, all kind of wildlife running away, and you had no clue about why.I Do think this movie should have been longer, and maybe it should have even been a made for tv miniseries, to give it enough time to flesh out everything, and make you actually care about the friends and whats going on.In my opinion, they should take everyone that made &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; and put them on each and every new Stephen King movie that comes out, they in my opinion have done the best Job thus far.This might sound like a negative review, but it's far from that...it is a decent movie, i just wanted more of what was already there, though it's good for what it is...though nothing spectacular.

But in my reality this movie beats Signs in sophistication, plot & excitement. I found Dreamcatcher to have a multi-layered plot line compared to Signs which was one dimensional. The eel like snakes were great additions to the special effects world of Hollywood. Plus the alien with the big head was really scary. I did think mid-way through the movie ""oh no not another Alien movie"". I did expect it to be a copy. But I was overly pleasantly surprised. Plus it was ironic &  tongue in cheek how Morgan Freeman referred to the aliens as Ripley's (from the Alien franchise four movie saga by 20th Century Fox). This movie made me realise & be scared of WHAT IF aliens did invade this way. They certainly posed more of a threat compared to Signs. Plus you could see the whole army of them. Which leads me to my favourite scene where the five brigade helicopters attack the aliens spaceships (for a moment I suspect the aliens could be friendly after all - great dialogue there by the writers!). In this spellbinding scene there were brilliant Independence Day ID4 like special effects; complete with brooding atmosphere. I love how the aliens tried to use the radio to communicate to us humans ""we are a peaceful race"" (through using innocent children voices), but were not in reality. Contrary to what some amazon reviewers have said, I found the childhood flashbacks to be very boring. Other bad points about the movie was some of the dialogue said by Morgan Freeman was incomprehensible. Can't wait for the DVD release to clear that up with subtitles & closed captioning. But the conspiracy theory I'll eat up any day (ala X Files - yummy!). Overall Dreamcatcher offers more than what it's modest trailer offers, which makes the movie seem less worthy & exciting.

This is no exception, but it does manage better than most.The movie follows two main stories.  One concerns the military and their efforts to fight off alien invasion (they have been at it at least 25 years).  The other concerns a group of four friends who each has paranormal powers.One of the four is injured in an accident when he thinks he sees an old friend.

764996,AFRZL05D54MPM,B0000AMRUL,JWolf,"[1, 1]","OVERVIEW:  Based on Stephen King's 2001 science-fiction/horror novel, ""Dreamcatcher,"" the 2003 film adaptation comes to us from director Lawrence Kasdan; Kasdan is also credited to have co-written the screenplay alongside the famed screenwriter, William Goldman.  ""Dreamcatcher"" centers around the adult versions of four friends who, during their childhood, befriended a mentally handicapped boy fondly nicknamed ""Duddits.""  Perhaps as a `thank you' for their friendship, each of the four boys acquires telepathic abilities--a gift they each utilize differently in adulthood.  Amidst the friends' annual reunion in Maine, an attack of parasitic aliens reveals the true meaning of Duddits's ""gift.""Despite having been adapted from a popular book and featuring a likeable cast, the film's release garnered mostly negative reviews; ""Dreamcatcher"" holds a 30% rating from Rotten Tomatoes.  Personally, I find that movie's first few scenes to be highly captivating; the cast and writing does a phenomenal job of creating intrigue about the characters and their other-worldly situation while still retaining an element of mystery--something key to keep audiences watching.  The ""problem"" with the film occurs along the build-up to the climax--an issue which I attribute to the need to alternative structuring between novel and film.  In addition, it seems fair to say that the ""suspense-element"" of the story was highly untapped by the screenplay; there are many areas where the filmmakers could have utilizes symbolism and twists, yet ultimately failed to do so.  All-in-all, I don't necessarily regret purchasing this DVD as it succeeds in telling a dynamic story; what I would warn about is that, while I think it's a good movie to see, it likely isn't one to add to a collection in anticipation of multiple views.  Unless you're dead-set on having the DVD on-hand, I recommend renting the movie before deciding to purchase--that is, unless the price to purchase actually ends up being cheaper than that of renting, of course.STARRING ROLES:  Damian Lewis as Gary ""Jonesy"" Jones, Jason Lee as Joe ""Beaver"" Clarendon, Donnie Wahlberg as Douglas ""Duddits"" Cavell, Thomas Jane as Henry Devlin, Timothy Olyphant as Pete Moore, Morgan Freeman as Colonel Abraham Curtis, Tom Sizemore as Owen Underhill, Rosemary Dunsmore as Roberta Cavell, Michael O'Neill as General Matheson, Eric Keenleyside as Rick McCarthy, Campbell Lane as Old Man Gosselin, C.

The boys quickly befriend Douglas--who earns the fondly-used nickname ""Duddits"" from his difficulty pronouncing his first name.  Shortly thereafter, the four young boys develop telepathic skills which they come to refer to as ""the line"".[Fast-Forward To Adulthood]  Jonesy, while trekking the sidewalk, has a vision of Duddits being on the opposite side of the street and calling for Jonesy to come to him.  When Jonesy instinctively crosses, a car strikes his body, leaving him severely injured.  Despite the bodily trauma, Jonesy somehow heals well-enough to join his friends (just 6 months later) for their annual reunion hunting trip in Maine.While venturing through the snowy forest, Jonesy encounters a wanderer by the name of Rick McCarthy; seeing that the man is both lost as dangerously ill, Beaver and Jonesy allow Rick use of their cabin to warm up and rest.  The mysterious wanderer suffers an incredibly bloody death with inside the cabin's bathroom.  Beaver discovers that Rick's death was caused by a large parasitic worm; while attempting to trap the creature, Beaver is also killed by the razor-sharp claw/teeth of the worm.  The parasite then sets its sights on Jonesy--who barely manages to escape, but only to come face-to-face with Mr. Grey, an alien who seizes Jonesy's body.On the road, Pete and Henry catch sight of a woman (who was presumably part of Rick's camp) just in time to avoid hitting her.  Having wrecked the vehicle, Henry sets off on foot in search of help.  Left behind to look after the stranded woman, Pete comes under attack by the parasite escaping the lost woman's body.  Even though he manages to evade the worm, Pete is soon captured, and later killed, by Mr. Grey/Jonesy.  Whatever control the real Jonesy retains on his body is used through ""the line"" to Henry, warning him of the treacherous situation.  When Henry reaches the cabin (which is still inhabited by the worm that killed Beaver), he decides to burn it and, thus, prevent the parasite from spawning.In the meantime, military helicopters have been flying overhead to alert any residents that the area has been placed under quarantine.  Colonel Abraham Curtis, the man in charge of the anti-alien containment mission, dispatches Owen Underhill on an airstrike against the extra-terrestrials' camp.  Amid the strike, the aliens attempt to use a form of telepathy similar to that which is used in ""the line"" to control the pilots.  Owen suffers numerous casualties in defeating the aliens, but ultimately returns to the base where he rendezvous with Henry.  Henry pleads with Curtis to warn the Army of serious nature of the situation; Curtis, after placing a tracker on Owen, flees the area via helicopter.Jonesy, existing in somewhat of an `out-of-body' form, discovers the reason for the accident which occurred earlier in the year, rendering him crippled; his body was possessed by Mr. Grey on purpose.  Mr. Grey needs to access Jonesy's knowledge of Duddits--the only person capable of preventing the impending alien infestation.  Knowing that Duddits plays some role in this series of events, Henry leads Owen to the Cavell's home to retrieve him.  Duddits exposes Mr. Grey's plan to release the parasitic larvae into the Quabbin Reservoir where they will spawn and find human hosts.Just as Owen, Henry, and Duddits reach the reservoir to head-off Mr. Grey, Curtis's helicopter resurfaces in an attack on the three men.  Though Owen is triumphant in shooting Curtis down, he receives mortal wounds.  The last line of defense between Earth and Mr. Grey is revealed with Duddits exposes himself as a fellow alien... but is he there to help, or has his presence only served to lead up to a successful alien invasion?",3,"Good Story, But Too Many Missed Opportunities",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,6808,"['OVERVIEW', 'Based', 'Stephen', 'King', '2001', 'science-fiction/horror', 'novel',

Excited to see what how the movie brought the book to life, I was so completely disappointed by this mutilation of a film that I almost walked out in utter disgust.Basic plot is four childhood friends have another, ""special"" friend, Duddits (special in that he's both retarded and absurdly gifted, as Stephen King does so well).  As adults the boys use these friendships to combat an alien invasion that comes to earth.  We have the additional military element trying to contain the invasion, complete with possibly insane general at the helm.The book had great intertwining plot twists, woven together as only King can.  I can only surmise that the movie suffered from massive editing, or that King was still on pain meds from being hit by that car and thus delusional as the screenplay was written.  I know things sometimes change when adapted to the screen, but to change entire endings (not to give it away, but the whole Duddits ending was unbelievably ridiculous) drives me up the wall, particularly when that change turns a great pleasure read into some Hollywood-ized, special effect, big-budget alien mess.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[12, 20]","While I found this movie to be mildly entertaining, it most certainly doesn't live up to the expectations one has when it comes to a Stephen King movie adaptation.  Granted, the CGI visualizations provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and the cast bring this movie up from a one or two star performance, thematically, it's a dismal failure compared to what it could have been.  I would venture to say that it would be difficult to determine whether it was the screenplay or the directing that failed this movie or a combination of both.As mentioned above, the performance by leading actors, Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Donnie Wahlberg and others held this movie up despite the screenplay.  Of note is the performance by Damian Lewis of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; fame, who performs spectacularly.The Premise:As youths, four best of buddies stumble across a seemingly mentally challenged youngster who is being harassed by some older kids.  They save him from his plight and as they grow up together, he imparts upon them some rather unusual abilities.  Twenty years later, these same four buddies are still best of friends, but they've grown away from their other friend, Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg).They make for the woods and their annual dear hunting trip only to discover some strange people who appear to be suffering from something rather strange.  As they soon discover, these same people give birth to aliens.  Enter Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore as the military who are trying to contain these aliens.  The connection between Duddits and the four friends soon comes into play.What follows from there is, not the best of movies but not the absolutely worst of movies either.  This one runs pretty much right down the middle of the road; you can take it or leave it.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- The original ending plus four other deleted scenes- 3 DocumentariesDream Writer:  An interview with Stephen KingDream Weavers:  The visual Effects of DreamcatcherDream Makers:  A journey through production- Teaser trailer",3,Dreamcatcher - Not as good as it could've been!,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,2040,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'most', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'one', 'when', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Granted', 'CGI', 'visualizations', 'provided', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'amp', 'Magic', 'ILM', 'cast', 'bring', 'movie', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'performance', 'thematically', 'dismal', 'failure', 'compared', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'determine', 'was', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'failed', 'movie', 'combination', 'both.As', 'mentioned', 'performance', 'leading', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'others', 'held', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'note', 'performance', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'quot', 'fame', 'who', 'spectacularly.The', 'Premise', 'youths', 'four', 'best', 'buddies', 'stumble', 'seemingly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'youngster', 'who', 'being', 'harassed', 'older', 'kids', 'save', 'plight', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'rather', 'unusual', 'abilities', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'four', 'buddies', 'are', 'still', 'best', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'away', 'other', 'friend', 'Duddits', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', '.They', 'make', 'woods', 'annual', 'dear', 'hunting', 'trip', 'only', 'discover', 'strange', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'suffering', 'something', 'rather', 'strange', 'soon', 'discover', 'same', 'people', 'give', 'birth', 'aliens', 'Enter', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'military', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'contain', 'aliens', 'connection', 'Duddits', 'four', 'friends', 'soon', 'play.What', 'not', 'best', 'movies', 'not', 'absolutely', 'worst', 'movies', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'middle', 'road', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'original', 'ending', 'four', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes-', '3', 'DocumentariesDream', 'Writer', 'interview', 'Stephen', 'KingDream', 'Weavers', 'visual', 'Effects', 'DreamcatcherDream', 'Makers', 'journey', 'production-', 'Teaser', 'trailer']",N/A

This movie was a bit confusing when I saw it but when I bought it and watched it again, it came together in the end (although I preferred the ORIGINAL ending myself).  Stephen King recently got in an accident with a car and that car accident in the beginning of the movie, portains to that (or so he claims).  The dreamcatcher in the movie portains to four friends and their special friend Duddits.  They were walking down to an old abandond Tractor Supply shop to look at a picture, when they found a shirt and a lunchbox.  They found Duddits and found 3 teenagers picking on him.  They scared them off and later in the movie, Duddits give them a special &quot;ability&quot;.  They have the ability to &quot;know things&quot; and one even had the ability to form a web, which looks like a dreamcatcher, that can &quot;find things&quot;.  A few of them diem but, they use their abilities to fight off a supernatural creature.  It takes over the body of Jonsie (Damian Lewis) and he tries to enter his &quot;memory warehouse&quot;.  Also, if you are a fan of Morgan Freeman, you might hate him in this movie...he plays an alien hunter.  The movie has an all-star cast: Morgan Freeman (SE7EN, Bruce Almighty), Thomas Jane (Deep Blue Sea), Jason Lee (Enemy Of The State, Dogma), Damian Lewis (Band Of Brothers), Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down, Enemy Of The State), &amp; Donnie Wahlberg (Band Of Brothers).

765020,ASDX2TSSGLY7F,B0000AMRUL,"Matthew Williams ""willhomes""","[1, 2]","Expecting anything good from this movie was a mistake seeing how the novel was a hodge-podge of themes previously developed in King's better work. You'd have to say at this point that he is recycling characters and issues in order to make his fans happy. And there is nothing wrong with that. Certainly, a lot of the themes that are King favorites - childhood bonds, alcoholism, lost innocence, and standing up to fear - are worthwhile. His focus on what is common to most of us is why his work is so popular. He writes about regular people living in locales of little interest to literary snobs. No wonder he's never attained the reputation he deserves. You can read King with the goal of learning about Middle America and come away much the better.That said, two talented and experienced filmmakers decided to ignore the few positive aspects of the novel. Instead we get &quot;special effects&quot; the equivalent of something you might see on the FX channel or an average Star Trek: TNG episode.  It shows how little faith Hollywood has in making movies that celebrate humanism, because that is what is best about King. He can be sentimental and cloying but his heart is always in the right place. Freeman never convices as the maniacal, homicidal Curtis, and Kasdan has absolutely no touch for horror. Horror being of course not slimy dung-weasels but the implications of genocide, or the fear of a bully, or the realization that life's best moments are fleeting, and that friendship doesn't always last.

Some movies, you can sit through, enjoy a few moments, and generally feel okay about spending the 5 or 6 bucks to see it. Not so much for (generally good) director Lawrence Kasdan's sloppy, horribly written (by William Goldman, the guy who bashed ""Gangs of New York"" but made a movie that makes ""Gangs"" look like ""Citizen Kane"") adaptation of hack writer Stephen King's novel. It's not even that the acting is so bad, or other technical elements of it fail. The plot is so diffuse and preposterous, first of all, and the movie mainains absolutely no focus whatsoever. The group of guys and the Morgan Freeman-as-the-jerk-army-guy subplot don't mix well, and then Donnie Wahlberg as the grown-up Duddits is perhaps the saddest display of ""look at how far my career has gone downhill"" I've ever seen. I think the main problem with the film is the way that Goldman adapted it for the screen, so I won't lambast Kasdan too much for it. Nonetheless, it's an abominably horrible film, and he should be ashamed to say he directed ""The Big Chill"" AND this. Not to mention the actors that show promise but end up playing evil twins with British accents and get mauled in the crotch by a giant slug-thing. Is it really as bad as it sounds? YES, and more.

Maybe I watched a different movie than our other critics; maybe I was in an extremely good mood, or maybe I don't have taste anymore??  Anyway, I found DREAMCATCHER to deliver just what I wanted:  superb, eerie direction by Lawrence Kasdan; a commendable script translation by Kasdan and William Goldman; some beautifully filmed snow scenes; eerie and stunning special effects; and some wonderfully nuanced performances.  I will admit Morgan Freeman's eyebrows were a little too &quot;there&quot;, and he was more wooden than I would have expected.  Maybe playing a villain isn't in his forte anymore.  I also enjoyed the score by the dependable James Newton Howard.  Translating such a mammoth novel into a movie is never easy and though it may seem the movie is a little too long, I still found myself engrossed.  In fact, the scene in the bathroom with Jason Lee desperately trying to get a clean toothpick and the subsequent results is one of the tensest scenes I've encountered since &quot;Aliens&quot;.

765026,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0000AMRUL,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 1]","As Stephen King progresses in his writing career, he has taken some interesting turns.  Movies like The Shawshank Redemption show that King can write about more than horror, and that he can also bring horror to the mundane.  In Dreamcatcher, King decides to add his name to the list of military science fiction authors. But the movie doesn't start out that way.Instead, Dreamcatcher has strong parallels to ""Stand By Me"" and ""It"".  Four men, each with their own personalities and quirks, become fast friends: Joe ""Beaver"" Clarenden (Jason Lee), Gary ""Jonesy"" Jones (Damian Lewis), Dr. Henry Devlin (Thomas Jane), and Pete Moore (Timothy Olyphant).  These four are typical screw-ups, all bound by a dark secret. And that secret is that they once saved Donnie Wahlberg--I mean Douglas ""Duddits"" Cavell--a mentally deficient young man who has alien powers.  Somehow, he transfers those powers to our four unlikely heroes.Years later, these four lovable lugs continue an old tradition: visiting a cabin to go hunting.  Along the way they discover other traumatized hunters with a dire need for some toilet paper and a magazine.  Just don't interrupt them...What ensues from that point on is a form of taboo-breaking insanity: aliens in the toilet.  These strange eel-like creatures enter your mouth, gestate in your stomach and leave from the other end, killing the host.  Then things get really nasty.Unlike most King stories, where nobody but the protagonists know what's going on, the entire government is at war with these things.  Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman), a cold-hearted colonel, leads Project Blueboy.  He is determined to kill every last alien, including their hosts and the surrounding landscape.  Curtis bosses around the more compassionate Lt. Owen Underhill (Tom Sizemore), who just might be our four boys' only chance at survival.Complicating matters is the fact that Jonesy has been taken over by ""Mister Gray,"" one of the aliens.  Unlike the other hosts, Mr. Gray has more advanced plans for poor Jonesy.  Thus we witness a battle of the minds, as we see the internal struggle of Jonesy in his room of mental secrets.  This struggle is acted out--look ma, no special effects!-through Lewis' acting alone, switching from proper British accent to Terrified Normal Guy.  Which is funny, given that Lewis is a Brit, so the ""normal"" guy is not his usual self.The puppetry and CGI effects are impressive, but often take away the terror of the final conflict.  After all, it's hard to be afraid of what amounts to a giant mouth with legs when you've just seen them running screaming for their lives from 30 Tomahawk missiles. The ""weasels"" should not be underestimated.  You'll never want to use the bathroom again. Or for a little while anyway.The acting is not as good.  Freeman looks like he wishes he were somewhere else.  Lee is funny as usual.  Lewis gets the acting workout of his life.  Sizemore tries, but at one point his gun turns into a telephone, so you can't expect too much.  Wahlberg is pretty awful as the ""slow"" guy, but he's also bald, so that makes it better.The two styles of films clash pretty strongly: from buddy/horror flick to science fiction war.  Though the transition is jarring, sci-fi fans probably won't have nearly as difficult a time making the transition as much as horror fans.  And Stephen King fans have undoubtedly flushed their DVDs down the toilet.New Kids on the Block fans should definitely see it.

The tension and suspense fit the mood of the movie, with an attempted suicide, a car accident, and some haunted childhood flashbacks. You kinda want to know about these guys and their mysterious past. The part with Jason Lee on the toilet was inventive and exciting, and you feel like you will be in a great ride of a movie.Then the horror begins, the horror being how terrible and unwatchable this movie turns into. It's just so crappy a plot and the acting is so dumb. Morgan Freeman looks so bored and just a waste of supreme talent. Jonesy talking to himself in a British accent is just laughable, and I actually cringed when it happened, almost embarrassed for the actor (who is a pretty decent actor outside this movie).If only the movie continued on from the potential beginning, this would have been a decent watchable horror thriller.

While the monsters were very well digitally constructed,there was simply too much of them to leave any room for suspense, tension or imagination.I think Kasdan tried to compensate the digital overdose with the beautiful scenery of the woods and the snow, shot from different angles, but it was a case of too little too lateAnother point that baffled me is the fact that the main evil alien has an inexplicably English accent!!??!It was totally unnecessary and devoid of any cheeky humour as probably intended.And, this is by far Morgan Freeman's worst role. His character was so cliched and way over the top: I really cringed at some of the scenes we was in!Dreamcatcher was King's first novel after his accident, and as he admits in an interview, there was a lot of the physical and psychological effects he endured as a result in it,which is not a bad thing in itself since he is one of the greatest authors of our time, but nevertheless it does in places reflect how tired and affected he was by his ordeal.But let me stress that the main problem with the film is not the book itself,(which, although I have yet to read,I have no doubt that it is much better) but with its adaptation to the screen, the script, and direction!I personally have enjoyed a lot of King's adaptations, especially (with the exception of Kubrick's Shining) his non horror stories, most notably Shawshank Redemption, Dolores Clairborne, Stand By Me, and Apt Pupil.But having said that,I have always appreciated his genuis gift for story telling, character study and development in all his books.If,like me, you too share this appreciation then you should avoid Dreamcatcher at all costs, and just forget the names King, Kasdan, Freeman or Goldman attached to it, for given the nothing but short of masterpiece expected from such talents, to be given such awfulness is quite unforgivable.",1,Save Your Time and Money...,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,2862,"['say', 'heavy', 'heart', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'am', 'fan', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'ever', 'impressed', 'greatly', 'masterpiece', 'impressive', 'debut', 'Body', 'Heat.But', 'Dreamcatcher', 'was', 'actually', 'awful', 'First', 'was', 'scary', 'exciting', 'watching', 'cricket', 'instead', 'get', 'scene', 'scene', 'digital', 'special', 'effects', 'while', 'become', 'so', 'tiresome', 'watch.The', 'film', 'looks', 'Alien', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Signs', 'even', 'Men', 'Black', 'assortment', 'earlier', 'King', 'adaptations', 'really', 'having', 'identity', 'character', 'own', 'coherence', 'matter.King', 'themes', 'do', 'occur', 'yet', 'again', 'abundance', 'kids/grown-ups', 'powers/gifts', 'was', 'so', 'sporadically', 'treated', 'became', 'quite', 'insignificant', 'whole', 'plot.The', 'Dreamcatcher', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'greater', 'significance', 'catching', 'nightmares..', 'was', 'too', 'just', ""'passing"", ""gimmick'.The"", 'monsters', 'aliens', 'got', 'biggest', 'crunch', 'script', 'where', 'main', 'problem', 'monsters', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'digitally', 'constructed', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'leave', 'room', 'suspense', 'tension', 'imagination.I', 'think', 'Kasdan', 'tried', 'compensate', 'digital', 'overdose', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'woods', 'snow', 'shot', 'different', 'angles', 'was', 'case', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'lateAnother', 'point', 'baffled', 'fact', 'main', 'evil', 'alien', 'inexplicably', 'English', 'accent', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'devoid', 'cheeky', 'humour', 'probably', 'intended.And', 'far', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'worst', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'cliched', 'way', 'top', 'really', 'cringed', 'scenes', 'was', 'Dreamcatcher', 'was', 'King', 'first', 'novel', 'accident', 'interview', 'was', 'lot', 'physical', 'psychological', 'effects', 'endured', 'result', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'greatest', 'authors', 'time', 'nevertheless', 'places', 'reflect', 'how', 'tired', 'affected', 'was', 'ordeal.But', 'let', 'stress', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'not', 'book', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'have', 'doubt', 'much', 'better', 'adaptation', 'screen', 'script', 'direction', 'personally', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'King', 'adaptations', 'especially', 'exception', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'non', 'horror', 'stories', 'most', 'notably', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Apt', 'Pupil.But', 'having', 'said', 'have', 'always', 'appreciated', 'genuis', 'gift', 'story', 'telling', 'character', 'study', 'development', 'books.If', 'too', 'share', 'appreciation', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'Dreamcatcher', 'costs', 'just', 'forget', 'names', 'King', 'Kasdan', 'Freeman', 'Goldman', 'attached', 'given', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'expected', 'such', 'talents', 'be', 'given', 'such', 'awfulness', 'quite', 'unforgivable']",N/A

So badly acted to the point that I began to wonder if the acting was deliberately cheesy.And why are the Maine accents in these Stephen King movies always so exaggerated?? Maine is beautiful , but I think the mention of Maine and Massachusetts in this film was a little much, yes we get it, we know the locale, yeah it is cool to be filming a Stephen king novel, blah blah.Some of the phrases, delivered in moments of suprise or fright, obviously lifted right out of the book, just seemed so acted and unnatural. (And who really talks like this anyway, except in a King novel)We start the story with 4 young friends who come to the rescue of a ""challenged"" boy. One of these kids decides it will soothe the boy to start singing ""Blue Bayou"" (caution: cringe worthy scene).Then we see the boys all grown up and in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Alien encounters ensue. The aliens invade the victims body, then cause intestinal discomfort, exiting through the bowels. If you haven't turned off the film by now due to a wretched scene of an  obese man passing gas, and then depositing the alien into the toilet, then you really do have nothing better to do.Enter into the picture Morgan Freeman, wearing 2 bunny rabbits where his eyebrows should be, to save the day.The scenery in the film saves the film from being a total failure. Set in a winter snowstorm, the nature shots are incredible. I am sure they are digitally created however, but it was still good photography and good  special effects.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 1]","Considering the roasting that Dreamcatcher received upon it's release, I went into this film with very low expectations, and while the film isn't as bad as it is reputed to be, it is far from being the best Stephen King adaptation.  The story revolves around four life long friends (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, Timothy Olyphant) who share a special gift that was handed down to them by a seemingly mentally challenged friend (Donnie Wahlberg) whom they had saved as children.  When the four go on their usual trip to a snowy cabin in Maine, they become enthralled in the middle of an alien invasion while the military makes a strike against them.  Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore also star as military officials; Freeman's character has a few ulterior motives, while Sizemore is just looking to do the right thing.  Director/co-screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan and co-screenwriter William Goldman, as good as they are, had a tough time adapting King's epic novel into a 136 minute film, and while their screenplay misses quite a bit, I think all together they did a decent job.  The special effects are nicely done, and there are some surprisingly good blood and gore effects to be had for horror afficiandos.  Despite it's advantages (the great cast, director, effects, etc.), Dreamcatcher misses quite a bit thanks to quite a number of plot holes, loose ends, and a terrible ending that is nothing like King's book (the alternate ending included on the DVD is much better).  Despite all that, Dreamcatcher is best enjoyed with low expectations, and it is a solid B-horror movie with A-level features.",3,"It's not terrible, but it's not that good either",1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,1608,"['Considering', 'roasting', 'Dreamcatcher', 'received', 'release', 'went', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'reputed', 'be', 'far', 'being', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'story', 'four', 'life', 'long', 'friends', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'who', 'share', 'special', 'gift', 'was', 'handed', 'down', 'seemingly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'friend', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'whom', 'had', 'saved', 'children', 'When', 'four', 'go', 'usual', 'trip', 'snowy', 'cabin', 'Maine', 'become', 'enthralled', 'middle', 'alien', 'invasion', 'military', 'strike', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'also', 'star', 'military', 'officials', 'Freeman', 'character', 'few', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'Sizemore', 'just', 'looking', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Director/co-screenwriter', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'co-screenwriter', 'William', 'Goldman', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'adapting', 'King', 'epic', 'novel', '136', 'minute', 'film', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'bit', 'think', 'together', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'blood', 'gore', 'effects', 'be', 'had', 'horror', 'afficiandos', 'advantages', 'great', 'cast', 'director', 'effects', 'etc', 'Dreamcatcher', 'quite', 'bit', 'thanks', 'quite', 'number', 'plot', 'holes', 'loose', 'ends', 'terrible', 'ending', 'nothing', 'King', 'book', 'alternate', 'ending', 'included', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'Dreamcatcher', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'low', 'expectations', 'solid', 'B-horror', 'movie', 'A-level', 'features']",N/A

Dreamcatcher will stand the test of time. Many people will hate this movie because it does not stay on target of the genre type that its poster suggests. Dreamcatcher is also one of the most faithful reproductions of a Steven King novel to date.Dreamcatcher is actually better than what it should have been. King in writing Dreamcatcher actually managed to give us a different take on the alien mind while at the same time inserting plenty of ""been there before, bought the T-Shirt sci-fi elements"". King decided to focus on the following points for his novel. These are also translated onto the screen.- Alien induced telepathy.- A human mind with some thinking alien qualities.- Aliens who infect to spread.- A long term alien agenda in human form.Dreamcatcher plays out on certain fronts with stereotypical characters for mainstream audiences but also contains elements that are purely original in design and execution. This film is weird, and some will hate that, but if you like to see an alternative take on an already beaten-to-death theme then you will love Dreamcatcher. If you are not a sci-fi fan and Dreamcatcher is one of the only sci-fi movies you have seen recently then you will probably be bored by it and not like it at all.In short if you want to watch a standard King movie that is very good then watch Stand By Me or The Shawshank Redemption. If you want to see a movie about things from outer space with lots of action then watch Aliens or Independence Day... but if you want to see a film which takes the Alien genre and plays with it to produce something with very original themes on an ""out there"" bend then take Dreamcatcher for your trip. It is certainly better than most direct-to-video sci-fi releases and is damn bit more experimental than most Hollywood mainstream flicks.The scene with the alien groups in the snow is totally warped and extremely memorable.

That's generally the problem with film adaptations of King.  He tells really sprawling stories most of the time.  That's great if you've got a 1000 page novel to flesh out all your ideas.  It doesn't usually work cramming into a 2 hour movie.  The best King adaptations have been tight, simple stories (Carrie, The Shining, Stand By Me, Misery), or given the room to breathe in a miniseries (The Stand, It, Desolation).The casting and acting is impeccable throughout.  With Lawrence Kasdan directing, and William Goldman writing, you'd expect the script and pace to be equally impeccable, you'd be wrong. There are times that the script takes jumps that simply make no sense, there are times it is flat-out silly.  And Kasdan stated in the DVD interview that he had never directed an ""effects"" movie, unfortunately, it shows.Up to about the 1 hour mark, it is some of the best adaptation of King ever.  Intensely personal and genuine and just pitch-perfect. After that, brilliant moments mixed with a lot of confusion and muddle.  It feels like it jumps into a completely different movie, with different cast, pacing, plot.I rec. the movie based on it's very real strengths, but caution that it also has very real flaws, and will leave you dissatisfied at the end. I really wish it had been given mini-series treatment (but then you wouldn't have Kasdan, Goldman, Freeman, Oliphaunt et al.)

The second is, ""How on earth did he convince Morgan Freeman to waste however much of his life it took to film this mess?""Even adaptation magician William Goldman, who's been responsible for some of the best scripts in the business, couldn't save what was, arguably, Stephen King's worst novel. Its plot: four friends (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, and Timothy Olyphant) have been coming to the same cabin in the woods since their school days twenty years before. This year, however, is different-- the woods around them have been taken over by parasitic aliens being hunted down by Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman) and his trusty sidekick Underhill (Tom Sizemore). The guys, of course, are right in the middle of it all.The problem with the film adaptation of it is that it never coheres; where King does manage, on occasion, to make the Mars Attacks!, The Big Chill, and Bill storylines work together at least some of the time, the film version seems like two different movies spliced together at random, perhaps by a sentient grapefruit. It's so silly in planes it may lead to another unwritten law of Hollywood filmmaking: never introduce a dysfunctional alcoholic trying to work out his problems in a monster movie. It leads to scenes like... well, a dysfunctional alcoholic trying to work out his problems while being stalked by a monster. (Wait, didn't Gary Brandner do this in The Howling...?)The oddest thing in the entire film, however, is the presence of Morgan Freeman. First, he's top-billed. Which kind of makes sense when you look back at the names of the four actual leads (those not recognizing more than two will be forgiven), even though his part in the film is actually quite small. More, he's woefully miscast. A number of people have said it was good seeing that he actually can play a bad guy; guess they missed his better performances in the similarly dismal Nurse Betty and only slightly more worthwhile Hard Rain. (We could make a case for Freeman-as-villain, as well, in both Se7en and Unforgiven, in which, really, there were no good guys; while that would likely be a far more interesting discussion, it would get us away from the point, which is bashing Dreamcatcher. Sorry to distract you.) Anyone can play a villain. And Morgan Freeman has shown that he can play a villain well in a few movies. He does not do so here. I've seen a lot of Morgan Freeman performances, and I'll admit to not having thought about this for terribly long, but I can't think of a worse performance I've seen from him.Of course, one could well blame Freeman's performance, and those of the rest of the actors, on a dud script. William Goldman does not often turn in duds, which leads us to wonder how long the original cut of this film actually was. Overzealous editing could, in fact, turn something coherent and borderline-worthwhile into an unwatchable mess.

765062,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0000AMRUL,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 9]","Four friends gather in a winter wilderness lodge where they will hash over old times, compare their idiosyncrasies and somehow save the world from a race of voracious worm aliens.  As boys, the four befriended an apparently mentally-challenged boy known to them as ""Duddits"" - in true Stephen King style, Duddits isn't all he seems, and he rewards his new friends with newfound powers - one guy can find whatever is lost...by anybody, another has a perfect memory (and can visualize it as a warehouse - remember that warehouse at the end of ""Raiders""?), and so on.  As adults they plan a weekend away in a forest cabin, chew the fat and compare notes about their powers.  Their weekend reverie is cut short when it becomes clear that their stretch of woodland has become a battleground between the aforementioned body-snatching aliens and a covert military force that's been fighting off otherworldly aliens for years.  Because the aliens here can control men's minds or even incubate within them, the ET-patrol sometimes finds itself drawing a bead on innocent human beings - and with these soldiers led with murderous efficiency by Morgan Freeman, ""sometimes"" becomes ""every other hour"".  With nowhere to turn, our heroes soon find themselves using their powers against the alien beasties and the evil soldiers.This was just an incredibly horrible movie.  On the surface, it's probably diverting.  You have to look a bit deeper if you want to get the ""so bad it's fun"" effect.  I know that HG Welles's invaders made it all the way from Mars without stopping to invent the wheel, but the worms of ""Dreamcatcher"" made it across the galaxy without the benefit of opposable thumbs (and happily for the US military, did us the favor of arriving on terra-firma, rather than anywhere on the 2/3rds of Earth covered by water, or otherwise beyond the reach of a decent military).  The plot gives the aliens the power to shape-shift - though they conceptually shift as well, with the script unable to decide if the aliens need to hatch from eggs or incubate in human beings, or whether they need to have any shape at all since they can assume anybody else's, and though denizens of a distant planet, are familiar enough with ours to understand the evil of the British accent.  Because the aliens' intentions are unclear, the plot remains similarly vague, and never gives the leads a plot to follow.  Left to their own devices, our leads act with utter stupidity (witness one of the characters, having trapped an alien in the toilet, reach desperately for...a toothpick?).  The biggest problem is that ""Dreamcatcher"" has something like a 2+ hour running time and nothing to fill it with but a pastiche of old sci-fi & horror stories and Stephen King plot ideas (the group of special friends from ""It"" & ""Stand By Me""; aliens from ""Tommyknockers""; the evil & covert shock troops seem like a paramilitary wing of ""The Shop"", the covert & evil government agency that's appeared in varying degrees in different King books) which are already a pastiche of sci-fi & horror stories.  The movie isn't a very tight fit for its shriveled plot.  Early on, you watch waiting for something to happen, and it doesn't; by the middle of the movie (by which time, the plot has apparently lost sight...of everything), you watch and wonder why things happen, or give up hope of anything happening - like the movie becoming a compelling and reasonably original story.  Instead, ""Dreamcatcher"" remains consistently unwatchable, and never really all that scary.",2,Dreamcatcher - as good as it could be...unfortunately,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,3530,"['Four', 'friends', 'gather', 'winter', 'wilderness', 'lodge', 'where', 'will', 'hash', 'old', 'times', 'compare', 'idiosyncrasies', 'somehow', 'save', 'world', 'race', 'voracious', 'worm', 'aliens', 'boys', 'four', 'befriended', 'apparently', 'mentally-challenged', 'boy', 'known', 'Duddits', 'true', 'Stephen', 'King', 'style', 'Duddits', ""n't"", 'all', 'new', 'friends', 'newfound', 'powers', 'one', 'guy', 'can', 'find', 'lost', 'anybody', 'perfect', 'memory', 'can', 'visualize', 'warehouse', 'remember', 'warehouse', 'end', 'Raiders', 'so', 'adults', 'plan', 'weekend', 'away', 'forest', 'cabin', 'chew', 'fat', 'compare', 'notes', 'powers', 'weekend', 'reverie', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'clear', 'stretch', 'woodland', 'become', 'battleground', 'aforementioned', 'body-snatching', 'aliens', 'covert', 'military', 'force', 'been', 'fighting', 'off', 'otherworldly', 'years', 'aliens', 'here', 'can', 'control', 'men', 'minds', 'even', 'incubate', 'ET-patrol', 'sometimes', 'drawing', 'bead', 'innocent', 'human', 'beings', 'soldiers', 'led', 'murderous', 'efficiency', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sometimes', 'other', 'hour', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'heroes', 'soon', 'find', 'using', 'powers', 'alien', 'beasties', 'evil', 'soldiers.This', 'was', 'just', 'incredibly', 'horrible', 'movie', 'surface', 'probably', 'diverting', 'have', 'look', 'bit', 'deeper', 'want', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'fun', 'effect', 'know', 'HG', 'Welles', 'invaders', 'made', 'way', 'Mars', 'stopping', 'invent', 'wheel', 'worms', 'Dreamcatcher', 'made', 'galaxy', 'benefit', 'opposable', 'thumbs', 'happily', 'US', 'military', 'did', 'favor', 'arriving', 'terra-firma', 'rather', 'anywhere', '2/3rds', 'Earth', 'covered', 'water', 'otherwise', 'reach', 'decent', 'military', 'plot', 'aliens', 'power', 'shape-shift', 'conceptually', 'shift', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'unable', 'decide', 'aliens', 'need', 'hatch', 'eggs', 'incubate', 'human', 'beings', 'need', 'have', 'shape', 'can', 'assume', 'anybody', 'else', 'denizens', 'distant', 'planet', 'are', 'familiar', 'enough', 'ours', 'understand', 'evil', 'British', 'accent', 'aliens', 'intentions', 'are', 'unclear', 'plot', 'similarly', 'vague', 'never', 'leads', 'plot', 'follow', 'Left', 'own', 'devices', 'leads', 'act', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'witness', 'one', 'characters', 'having', 'trapped', 'alien', 'toilet', 'reach', 'desperately', 'toothpick', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Dreamcatcher', 'something', '2+', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'nothing', 'fill', 'pastiche', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'stories', 'Stephen', 'King', 'plot', 'ideas', 'group', 'special', 'friends', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Tommyknockers', 'evil', 'covert', 'shock', 'troops', 'seem', 'paramilitary', 'wing', 'Shop', 'covert', 'evil', 'government', 'agency', 'appeared', 'varying', 'degrees', 'different', 'King', 'books', 'are', 'already', 'pastiche', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'stories', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'tight', 'fit', 'shriveled', 'plot', 'Early', 'watch', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', ""n't"", 'middle', 'movie', 'time', 'plot', 'apparently', 'lost', 'sight', 'everything', 'watch', 'wonder', 'why', 'things', 'happen', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'anything', 'happening', 'movie', 'becoming', 'compelling', 'reasonably', 'original', 'story', 'Instead', 'Dreamcatcher', 'consistently', 'unwatchable', 'never', 'really', 'scary']",N/A

On an annual camping trip in the woods of Northern Maine, the men stumble upon a lost hunter, who is infected with an alien &quot;byrum&quot; which gestates inside him before being born in a graphic and bloody moment in the first third of the film.At this point, the story begins to become disjointed.  In the original novel, the alien lifeform was a bacteria, using host bodies to survive by taking control of them, implanting their own minds in the mind of their hosts.  One of the key elements of the book was that the alien lifeform was symbiotic, and genuinely needed human life to function.In the movie, the aliens are a monstrous collage of teeth and oozing worm, though monstrous and hideous, also largely unbelievable, especially when this &quot;worm&quot; emerges time and again from its host body, standing far larger than the man it has been hiding in.  This, amongst the many other obvious flaws in this film detract from what could still be an intensely frightening story.To its credit, it has some beautiful special-effects, created for the film by Industrial Light and Magic, a veteran effects warehouse known for producing the effects on such films as Star Wars and Jurassic Park.  The acting, too, is not a complete wash.  Morgan Freeman, a veteran actor of the stage and screen, takes on the role of a soldier with a vandetta against these alien invaders.  His character is unbelievable, as is most the film, but Freeman delivers a great performance despite the limitations of this script.I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing this film...as films of this genre go, I have definitely seen much worse, but for those who have taken the time to read the original novel, be warned that this film is a far cry from the nightmare Stephen King painted for us when he released this novel, a complicated depection of friendships and relationships faced with a horrific possibility of alien invasion.  It should be viewed with that realization that Lawrence Kasdan (who directed this film) was admittedly looking to do &quot;an (special) effects&quot; film.

Now I personally was not blown away by the book but it was a good read none the less.  Without reading the book you have no idea why Jonesey is in the room looking out the window or what the purpose is of him gathering boxes.  They left out Mr Gray's love of bacon.  There was so much that was left out or just plain ignored.  The football player trying to make Duddits eat the item at the beginning of the movie, they don't cover his death.  They completly changed the ending.  The ending to the movie was very badly done.  There was so much that was changed that it completely ruined the movie.  On a final note, the Scooby Doo references and catch phrases just do not come across with the same passion and meaning as they did in the book.

765068,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B0000AMRUL,S. Harris,"[0, 1]","Dreamcatcher was slammed by the critics, so I was expecting the movie to be an ordeal, and almost put off watching it altogether. But I had read the King book, so I figured I could fill in the gaps. Well, it was ok, and worth a Friday night watch. Kasdan is a good director, so I suspect critics were expecting a Kubrick like A-film treatment. (Though I think Kubrick's Shining is overrated, or perhaps better- wrecked by Nicholson's hammy performance.)  But the Shining is one of best of King's books. Dreamcatcher is not.  It's a middle of the pack effort by King, with, admittedly, a hodge-podge of borrowings  from other sci-fi &amp; horror movies and stories.  Still, if you liked It, with its circle of friends reuniting to face horror, you should be ok with Dreamcatcher (the novel).The first half of the movie is well done, pretty much following the novel. But about two thirds of the way through, I realized a lot of ground was going to have to be covered if the movie intended to continue following the novel. Actually, the ground did get covered, but in a very hurried way. And I was not crazy about the changed ending -- though I could live with it. This is a story that probably should of been given a tv mini-series, so that the characters could indeed unfold.  And, more critically, that the figure of Duddits (a retarded boy) could establish his importance. To some extent, I can see why Kasdan altered the ending, and thus Duddets, since it allowed more for a short telling of the story.  But by doing so Kasdan undercut one of most attractive elements of the story. The Duddets of the novel, with his love for Scooby Doo, is charming, and the kind of character King really does well. Duddets brings out the humanity of the novel's main characters. The Duddets of the movie exists more as an outline. The deep love the four friends in the movie feel for Duddets is not developed in a way that makes him necessarily central to the story.  Moreover, his love of Scooby Doo, etc., for the most part doesn't make much sense, given his newly director imposed alien genes.",3,Not all that bad,1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,2083,"['Dreamcatcher', 'was', 'slammed', 'critics', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'ordeal', 'almost', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'altogether', 'had', 'read', 'King', 'book', 'figured', 'could', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Well', 'was', 'ok', 'Friday', 'night', 'watch', 'Kasdan', 'good', 'director', 'suspect', 'critics', 'were', 'expecting', 'Kubrick', 'A-film', 'treatment', 'think', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'overrated', 'perhaps', 'better-', 'wrecked', 'Nicholson', 'hammy', 'performance', 'Shining', 'one', 'best', 'King', 'books', 'Dreamcatcher', 'not', 'middle', 'pack', 'effort', 'King', 'admittedly', 'hodge-podge', 'borrowings', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'amp', 'horror', 'movies', 'stories', 'Still', 'liked', 'circle', 'friends', 'reuniting', 'face', 'horror', 'should', 'be', 'ok', 'Dreamcatcher', 'novel', '.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'pretty', 'much', 'following', 'novel', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'realized', 'lot', 'ground', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'covered', 'movie', 'intended', 'continue', 'following', 'novel', 'Actually', 'ground', 'did', 'get', 'covered', 'very', 'hurried', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'crazy', 'changed', 'ending', 'could', 'live', 'story', 'probably', 'should', 'been', 'given', 'tv', 'mini-series', 'characters', 'could', 'indeed', 'unfold', 'more', 'critically', 'figure', 'Duddits', 'retarded', 'boy', 'could', 'establish', 'importance', 'extent', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Kasdan', 'altered', 'ending', 'thus', 'Duddets', 'allowed', 'more', 'short', 'telling', 'story', 'doing', 'so', 'Kasdan', 'undercut', 'one', 'most', 'attractive', 'elements', 'story', 'Duddets', 'novel', 'love', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'charming', 'kind', 'character', 'King', 'really', 'well', 'Duddets', 'out', 'humanity', 'novel', 'main', 'characters', 'Duddets', 'movie', 'more', 'outline', 'deep', 'four', 'friends', 'movie', 'feel', 'Duddets', 'not', 'developed', 'way', 'necessarily', 'central', 'story', 'Moreover', 'love', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'etc.', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'given', 'newly', 'director', 'imposed', 'alien', 'genes']",N/A

Taking on Dreamcatcher is rather ambitious because it attempts to cram an 800+ page novel into a movie just over two hours.  Not to mention that so much of the book takes place in people's thoughts and minds.King's Dreamcatcher was an interesting take on the old alien invasion story, but with a little Stand By Me thrown into the mix.  It wasn't King's best book, but it was a very good one.  It involves four men, who as kids befriended a boy with Down Syndrome.  As a result of their friendship with the boy, Duddits, he passes on his telepathic powers to his four new friends, creating a bond that lasts a lifetime.  This bond comes into play when the four guys are on their annual hunting trip and they find themselves in the middle of an alien invasion.  The invasion is only part of them problem coz the evil military is keeping the area under a quarantine and plans to kill off all those infected by the aliens(in the form of a red fungus called ""Ripley Fungus"").  Some folks are infected with eel-like alien parasites that incubate in their bellies and give them some rancid farts(kinda like some friends of mine)  The military destroys the invaders early on, but one alien has taken possession of one of the protagonists and has a plan to infect the water supply.Dreamcatcher wasn't a bad movie, but it might have fared better as a miniseries.  Most of the important plot points from the book are in the movie, but in order to fit them all in, the movie moves at a fast pace, leaving little time for much character development.  Once we get to the last act of the movie, Stephen King is pretty much given the boot and the screenwriters take control.  This bugged me coz everything seemed rather accurate up to that point.  Oh well.The casting was okay.  In the book, Henry is supposed to be more of a skinny, nerdy type, and Thomas Jayne just doesn't seem too much like a psychologist.  Tom Sizemore was a great choice for Underhill as was Jason lee for Beaver.  Morgan Freeman is the crazy Colonel leading the quarantine, but he seems a little more mellow and toned down than his character was supposed to be.  It probably would have been much better to get an actor who had Down Syndrome to play Duddits rather than Donnie Wahlberg.  I mean, come on!The movie wasn't too bad.  Not great or nearly as good as it could have been, but a harmless time killer.

765074,AL277B4AQCWBG,B0000AMRUL,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 3]","""Dreamcatcher"" is approximately what you'd get if you crossed ""Starship Troopers"" with ""Stand By Me"" and told it with all the narrative complexity of a fart joke.  Four friends, bound since childhood by a psychic connection forged when they rescued a retarded companion from grade-school bullies (I'm not kidding), are now disgruntled thirtysomethings enjoying their annual weekend hunting trip in the Maine woods when along comes a bunch of cavity-invading aliens and a maverick paramilitary outfit to spoil their day.  Caught between the over-zealous quarantiners (played with unintentional ""Catch 22""-like comedy by Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore) and an all-consuming alien fungus, our friends start to get picked off one by one.  But will their retarded pal - who may or may not be an alien - be able to save them and the planet in time?  Do we even need to ask?  Movies adapted from Stephen King's stories fall into two categories: brilliant or utterly appalling.  The brilliant ones - ""The Shining"", ""Misery"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Apt Pupil"" and ""Stand By Me"" - all succeed because they ditch most of the grossness and emphasise something which King's stories are often quite good at but for which they're rarely admired:  character.  I'm assured by its readers that this novel is one of King's most complex, thematically and structurally.  It shows.  As with Scott Hicks' stunningly slight ""Hearts In Atlantis"", you get the feeling that most of the important bits have been left out.  Condensing 900-odd pages into 120 minutes is probably impossible, even with veteran screenwriter William Goldman at the keys.  Maybe it would have worked better as a mini-series.  Ironically, ""Dreamcatcher"" is both too small AND too big.  The themes it wants to play with - male friendship, child psychology, the victory of the weak over the strong - demand an intimate scale.  But the sci-fi element demands a big budget, and in Hollywood a big budget dictates a big audience, and a big audience requires a one-size-fits-all movie.  The risk is that one size fits nobody, as it clearly does here.  To be fair, there are some inspired moments, like when Kasdan literalises the metaphor of ""the memory warehouse"" and has Jonesy (Damian Lewis, slumming it here) running around a Borgesian library, and there's an alien invader which looks for all the world like a nightmarish Freudian fusion of male and female genitalia - with teeth.  (But maybe that says more about me...)  The best thing about this film is John Seale's cinematography, which is typically marvellous - it's so good it looks out of place.  This is a disappointing film, not only for its inherent flaws, but because of the talent that's been squandered on it.

All? Not the audience.The aliens are wormlike creatures that reside in intestines (a theme used i dont know how many times in the past) and which come out- preferably- from toilet...bowls to attack their victims. As for the humans in the film, most of them act like they've been part of a massive lobotomy experiment.Wait. Does this sound funny? Apologies if it does because no, it's not even funny.This film can take on some of the worst b-movies out there and still come out on the losing side. It's not funny, it's not suspenful, it's not anything really.I havent read the book, but i'd really like to know what Stephen King thinks of his material being butchered systematically like that because as more experienced movie buffs know this is not the first time.As for some reviews saying that this is a &quot;slick&quot; version of an X-file episode, well, I'd say that people who claim that are definately not fans of the classic TV series. Any episode of the X-Files, even the not so good ones, is light years ahead in quality from this cinematic disaster.I was lucky enough to see it for free, and even so, I only could endure it for about an hour.

765079,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B0000AMRUL,the masked reviewer,"[4, 5]","From what we've heard, quite a bit of Stephen King's DREAMCATCHER was lost in the translation from the page to the screen; but not having read it, we were free to enjoy the movie as a creature feature involving, among other things, slimy, toothy worms that issue forth, in a crescendo of blood and gas, from their victims' recta. There hasn't been this much tension generated in an `Aliens Have Come To Take Our Planet' movie since HOWARD THE DUCK! (Although we had to wonder what director Lawrence Kasdan - who made such high-toned dramas as THE BIG CHILL and THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST - was thinking about as he set up the scene with the alien in the toilet.)Get ready for Bad Movie delirium as four friends (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, and Timothy Olyphant) head up to a remote cabin in snowy Derry, Maine, as they've done every year for the last twenty years. The area, it so happens, is under paramilitary quarantine; rogue commander Morgan Freeman is trying to isolate and destroy a vicious race of galactic visitors, though decades of E.T. hunting have left him a few pennies short of a dollar. This is a heartening return to villainy for Freeman - let's not forget his breakthrough role as a heartless pimp in 1987's STREET SMART. But 1987 was a long time ago, and Freeman, working against dozens of noble past performances, just seems more irritable than usual.The four guys have telepathic gifts, passed on to them by Donnie Wahlberg, a mentally challenged kid they once saved from bullies. (Don't ask). Sometimes these gifts manifest themselves in interesting forms, as when Damian Lewis ""calls"" Thomas Jane on a handgun borrowed from ambivalent soldier Tom Sizemore. In what immediately became one of our all-time favorite mainstream forays into the surreal, the gun actually rings, and Jane chats away into it. And if you want first-class deadpan comedic genius, check out Sizemore's blandly inflected response after the call is done: ""Give me back my gun.""We also enjoyed Jason Lee's nervous-tic characterization as Beaver, who scoops peanut butter out of the jar with his finger and is never without a toothpick between his teeth; while sitting on that toilet lid to keep the alien confined, Lee must reach perilously to the floor for one of the few spilled toothpicks not floating in anal gore. Call us crude - but you just have to LOVE a scene of suspense built around fallen toothpicks and a toilet monster.It all eventually collapses under a barrage of exposition. Perhaps King's book explains why the alien who takes over Lewis's body is known as Mr. Gray and speaks like John Cleese, or what happens to all the alien-infected people quarantined in Derry, or why the recesses of Lewis's mind look like an overstuffed library archive (complete with X-rated fantasies filed by year).Adaptations of Stephen King novels are often more MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE than CARRIE - but despite King's convoluted original, what's most insane about this awesomely cack-handed crazy salad, is that seasoned screenwriters like William Goldman (MISERY) and Kasdan are responsible. In fact, the more we think about this loud, confusing, cheesily enjoyable movie, the more we have to read King's book. (Just please don't tell us it doesn't have any toilet monsters.)",5,DREAMCATCHER is anything but SSDD!,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,3267,"['what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'bit', 'Stephen', 'King', 'DREAMCATCHER', 'was', 'lost', 'translation', 'page', 'screen', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'were', 'free', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'creature', 'feature', 'involving', 'other', 'things', 'slimy', 'toothy', 'worms', 'issue', 'forth', 'crescendo', 'blood', 'gas', 'victims', 'recta', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'tension', 'generated', 'Aliens', 'Have', 'Come', 'Take', 'Planet', 'movie', 'HOWARD', 'THE', 'DUCK', 'had', 'wonder', 'what', 'director', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'who', 'made', 'such', 'high-toned', 'dramas', 'THE', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'THE', 'ACCIDENTAL', 'TOURIST', 'was', 'thinking', 'about', 'set', 'up', 'scene', 'alien', 'toilet', 'Get', 'ready', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'delirium', 'four', 'friends', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'head', 'up', 'remote', 'cabin', 'snowy', 'Derry', 'Maine', ""'ve"", 'done', 'year', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'area', 'so', 'paramilitary', 'quarantine', 'commander', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'trying', 'isolate', 'destroy', 'vicious', 'race', 'galactic', 'visitors', 'decades', 'E.T', 'hunting', 'have', 'left', 'few', 'pennies', 'short', 'dollar', 'heartening', 'return', 'villainy', 'Freeman', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'heartless', 'pimp', '1987', 'STREET', 'SMART', '1987', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Freeman', 'working', 'dozens', 'noble', 'past', 'performances', 'just', 'more', 'irritable', 'usual.The', 'four', 'guys', 'have', 'telepathic', 'gifts', 'passed', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'kid', 'once', 'saved', 'bullies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Sometimes', 'gifts', 'manifest', 'interesting', 'forms', 'when', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'calls', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'handgun', 'borrowed', 'ambivalent', 'soldier', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'what', 'immediately', 'became', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'mainstream', 'forays', 'surreal', 'gun', 'actually', 'rings', 'Jane', 'chats', 'away', 'want', 'first-class', 'deadpan', 'comedic', 'genius', 'check', 'out', 'Sizemore', 'blandly', 'inflected', 'response', 'call', 'done', 'Give', 'back', 'gun', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'nervous-tic', 'characterization', 'Beaver', 'who', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jar', 'finger', 'never', 'toothpick', 'teeth', 'sitting', 'toilet', 'lid', 'keep', 'alien', 'confined', 'Lee', 'must', 'reach', 'perilously', 'floor', 'one', 'few', 'spilled', 'toothpicks', 'not', 'floating', 'anal', 'gore', 'Call', 'crude', 'just', 'have', 'LOVE', 'scene', 'suspense', 'built', 'fallen', 'toothpicks', 'toilet', 'monster.It', 'eventually', 'barrage', 'exposition', 'Perhaps', 'King', 'book', 'why', 'alien', 'who', 'Lewis', 'body', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Gray', 'speaks', 'John', 'Cleese', 'what', 'all', 'alien-infected', 'people', 'quarantined', 'Derry', 'why', 'recesses', 'Lewis', 'mind', 'look', 'overstuffed', 'library', 'archive', 'complete', 'X-rated', 'fantasies', 'filed', 'year', '.Adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'MAXIMUM', 'OVERDRIVE', 'CARRIE', 'King', 'convoluted', 'original', 'what', 'most', 'insane', 'awesomely', 'cack-handed', 'crazy', 'salad', 'seasoned', 'screenwriters', 'William', 'Goldman', 'MISERY', 'Kasdan', 'are', 'responsible', 'fact', 'more', 'think', 'loud', 'confusing', 'cheesily', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'more', 'have', 'read', 'King', 'book', 'Just', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""n't"", 'have', 'toilet', 'monsters']",N/A

The production looks great, and the film's plot and dialogue reek of Stephen King.  If you have ever read a King novel, you know what I mean. However, the film felt rushed, and there was just way too much information and story packed into 2 hours and 10 minutes of film. The movie does have some rather neat moments - the bathroom scene with Damian Lewis &amp; Jason Lee, the animal migration out of the woods, and a wonderfully evil performance by Morgan Freeman. The book itself was not one of King's best, but it did touch more on the relationships of the four leads and &quot;Duddits.&quot; The movie did show a good amount of this, but in most scenes it was just two characters together, not all four.  The movie version left me a little confused because of all the things that were left out. I realize that the producers couldn't have made a 6 hour movie out of this, but what they chose to leave out was important to the story. The creature effects were rather hokey too. The &quot;weasels&quot; looked cartoonish, as did the big aliens. I think that they were to CGI, and not at all believable.

765083,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B0000AMRUL,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 3]","Director:  Lawrence KasdanCast:  Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, Timothy Olyphant, Tom Sizemore, Donnie Wahlberg.Running Time:  136 minutesRated R for violence, science-fiction gore, and language.The first third of ""Dreamcatcher"" is worth the time. Four childhood friends make their annual trip to a hunting cabin, weird things happen, and, before you know it, you're smack-dab in the world of Stephen King, at his most darkly comical and gaily grotesque. It's flatulent, bloody fun on the page, and screen adapter William Goldman had no problem translating this hideous orgy of gas and guts from novel to screenplay form. As the screenplay proceeds, it strays from the book to the point where the film becomes a Hollywood embarrassment of epic proportions.  The ""Dreamcatcher"" novel also fell apart in its second half, but what kept you reading the book was the mind games going on in the lead character, Jonesy's (Damian Lewis) head. Jonesy's brain and body has been taken hostage by an alien named, Mr. Gray. In the novel, Jonesy notices Gray becoming tempted by the trappings of humanity and uses that to his advantage. It's fun to watch the alien craving various human indulgences, more and more, with each passing minute. This aspect of the novel is completely removed from the film, leaving us with nothing more than Damian Lewis, playing both Jonesy and Mr. Gray, making silly faces, and putting on goofy accents, as he goes between the two characters.The second act of the film, one taking place in a concentration camp for American citizens whom may or may not be contaminated with an alien virus, is nothing more than a shadow of what is shown in the book. Even the shoddiest of cliff note ""authors"" would be embarrassed to condense a novel down to this elementary a form.  In the book, the head of the camp, Colonel Abraham Kurtz, played in the film by Morgan Freeman, was a nasty man, so over the edge that he was frightening, from his first appearance to his last. In the movie, we're made aware of the fact that he has lost it, but almost exclusively through exposition, rather than action. Seeing these innocent civilians locked up like animals was disturbing in the novel, and would make for an extremely tense mid-section of this movie, if this movie dared to have any tension.  In King's ""Dreamcatcher"", the people locked in the camps join together, with help from the telepathic Dr. Henry Devlin, in the film played by Thomas Jane, and start a massive uprising against the guards. At the same time, Devlin is working on Colonel Kurtz's more conscientious subordinates, both through words, and the power that he, along with Jonesy, Beaver and Pete, was given by a mysterious fifth friend, Duddits. In the movie, the uprising never occurs, and it feels as though each of the concentration camp scenes were put into the film to pad it out, while giving a plum role to Morgan Freeman.  If you're a fan of horror, you will enjoy the first hour of the film. The bathroom sequence is a near-masterpiece, and, for that alone, director Lawrence Kasdan should be commended. Kasdan also handles the flashback scenes, featuring the four main characters as children, adequately enough to get my thumb working its way toward the ""up"" direction. Finally, during those few times Kasdan does take us into Jonesy's brain, he does so in an incredibly interesting, oftentimes humorous, manner.There was a lot of money and time put into Dreamcatcher, and it shows on the screen. Steve Johnson's work on the puppet versions of the ""poop weasels"" is extremely effective, and shows, once again, that anything CG can do, human hands can do better. The CG isn't the best I've seen, but it's significantly less cartoony than either of the last two ""Star Wars"" prequels, and does the job nicely, even though I would have enjoyed the effects far more, if CG wasn't a part of them. The cinematography by John Seale (""The English Patient"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", ""Witness"") is gorgeous, but not noteworthy enough to make the Director of Photography the star of the film, like Caleb Deschanel's work did for him in the recent semi-stinker, ""The Hunted"".  It's hard to say what director Lawrence Kasdan was aiming for. The early scenes indicate a more subtle, atmospheric approach, but that's out the window less than an hour in.  As a gory slime-fest with hostile alien creatures, the movie's almost a total bore, the story switching back-and-forth between different characters and never developing momentum for any of these individual plot strands, not even when they eventually converge. You might also be a little miffed by the lack of man vs. monster action; these aliens prefer a sneakier approach to taking over the world.  If anything, ""Dreamcatcher"" is a good reminder that creature flicks work best when they maintain a stark simplicity rather than veering off on more ""ambitious"" tangents like this movie attempts. There are number of wonderful monster movies set in secluded locations, films like ""Tremors"", ""Pitch Black"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". I highly suggest you check all of those out instead.  Not one of Stephen King's better books and certainly not one of his better adaptations.",2,Dreamcatcher  (2003),1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,5222,"['Director', 'Lawrence', 'KasdanCast', 'Morgan',

It tells the story of four childhood friends who have now grown up.  An experience from their childhood gave them special powers, most notably mindreading, which they don't understand how they got them.  The four friends go on a camping/hunting/fishing trip one weekend, and things start to get ugly.  They quickly discover something is seriously wrong, and find out that an alien have landed and are planning to take over the world.  Soon enough, the army gets involved.  This is an entertaining movie with a very good cast, but it is very uneven.  It seems like it might be a pyschological thriller, but it turns into a bloody sci-fi movie with ravenous aliens.  Either way, this is a good movie that deserves at least one watch if nothing else.Dreamcatcher does boast an impressive cast that helps the movie out when the story suffers.  Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, and Timothy Olyphant are all very good as the four childhood friends who find themselves in the midst of an alien invasion.  Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore are also very good as part of the secret military operation brought in to eliminate the aliens.  Donnie Wahlberg also makes a brief appearance as a mentally challenged man who was befriended by the four friends as kids.  His role is very small, but essential to the story.

765100,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000AMRUL,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 2]","Originally called Cancer, Stephen King's novel Dreamcatcher was written during his recovery time after being struck by a van and nearly killed. It, no doubt, provided many of the ideas in this strange combination of Stand by Me, Alien and It. The film works best when the four central characters share screen time both as children and adults. Kasdan is an actor's director and his work with the talented actors here is marvelous. Although the acting of the children playing Henry, Jonesy, Beaver and Pete is accomplished, it isn't quite as well developed as could be due to the limited screen time in the movie.Henry (Thomas Jane), Jonesy (Damien Lewis), Beaver (Jason Lee) and Pete (Timothy Olyphant)are bonded by friendship and two major incidents in their lives; the first is when they save a mentally challenged child named Duddits from being abused by older boys. Duddits isn't an ordinary mentally challenged child. He has the gift to read minds and other psychic abilities. He shares some of this gift with his new found friends. They quintet use their abilities to help save a missing mentally handicapped girl who is a neighbor of one of the boys. That's when they discover their unearthly gifts bestowed upon them by their new friend.Twenty years later the quartet aren't coping very well with their lives and much of it has to do with their gifts. Jonesy is nearly killed in a car accident while Henry almost committs suicide because of his inability to cope with the strange ability to see into other's minds. Their gift both unites and isolates them from others (a common theme in King's novels and stories). At their annual retreat to their hunting cabin one of the men discovers a lost hunter and and brings him back to the cabin. That turns out to be a terrible mistake. From here the film shifts to an alien invasion film.At an two hours and 14 minutes Dreamcatcher moves along in fits and starts. While it never gets boring, the pacing is a bit uneven although I can't think of any other way to tell the complete story without shifting from past to present as well as Kasdan and co-writer William Goldman do. Dreamcatcher manages to be faithful to the novel and I actually enjoyed it better than the novel. Why? Well I honestly didn't like King's novel all that much to begin with. It had three interesting intersecting plots but it seemed too familiar. The film, on the other hand, moves at a pretty good pace so that familarity isn't as big an issue. As Kasdan accurately points out any film of a novel is a reduction of the book. The adaption is occasionally more successful because it distills that essence and retains the important part of the book. With Dreamcatcher Kasdan and Goldman are very successful at capturing the better parts of King's book. Unfortunately, the tone of the film and focus shift so frequently that it doesn't quite build the way it should (neither did the novel). King's strength as a writer are his characters. While the characters do suffer a bit in comparison to the film Kasdan and Goldman manage to capture the best elements from King's book.The acting by most of the ensemble is truly impressive. Particularly outstanding is British actor Damien Lewis as Jonesy. He has the most complex and difficult character in the film to play and he pulls it. It's an impressive effort overall and, if it isn't 100% successful all the time, neither was King's novel. A warning for viewers is that the film is quite gory at times and the action is way too intense even for preteens (hence the R rating). The violence is, at times, graphic although Kasdan doesn't go over the top as someone else might. Morgan Freeman underplays the military ops commander Kurtz. It's a wise approach and bring an element of credibility to the role; Kurtz is insane and Freeman's deft touch and quiet understated approach makes the character even scarier.The DVD transfer is very good which is surprising given that the film takes place so much in the snow. These sequences could have been visually drab and uninteresting but due to Kasdan, production designer Jon Hutman and DP John Seale, they are not.The sound is particularly good on this DVD highlighting James Newton Howard's unusual score.There aren't a huge amount of extras but what they do have here are interesting. There's a number of scenes cut from the film that do little to advance the plot but add shades of character. There's the original ending of the film which is less impressive but has a fine, quiet and touching coda. There's also an outtake that is very funny particularly as the actors ad lib but stay in character.The interview with King doesn't reveal all that much. It'll provide a bit of background on the genesis of the novel and King's reaction to the film. There's also two short featurettes on the process of making the film and the visual effects.Although Dreamcatcher isn't in the same class as Kasdan's best films (nor King's best novels or Goldman's best adaptions), all three turn in an entertaining thrill ride. It's at least worth a rental for King fans.",3,"Odd combo of Stand by Me, It  and War of the Worlds",1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,5069,"['Originally', 'called', 'Cancer', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel',
