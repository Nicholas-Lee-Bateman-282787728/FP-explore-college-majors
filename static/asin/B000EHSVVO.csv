He was young when he played the part of this combat soldier in this movie.  I know years later he played in other war movies like Battle of the Bulge and Midway.,4,Combat War Movie,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,222,"['was', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Immortal', 'Sergeant', 'was', 'young', 'when', 'played', 'part', 'combat', 'soldier', 'movie', 'know', 'years', 'later', 'played', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Midway']",Immortal Sergeant
973720,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000EHSVVO,C. O. DeRiemer,"[44, 46]","""You know, if anything happens to me you're in command,"" says Sergeant Kelly (Thomas Mitchell) to Corporal Colin Spence (Henry Fonda). They're lost in the Libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car, almost no water and a busted compass. Sergeant Kelly started out with Corporal Spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol. Three German fighters changed things. Now there's only Sergeant Kelly, Spence and four others.""Nothing's going to happen to you, sergeant,"" Spence says. ""I mean, it can't.""""It won't, lad, if I can help it. Still, if I stop a packet it's up to you to get this patrol back...and that's not an easy job.""""But I'm no leader,"" Spence says. ""I haven't had the experience to take up a command like this with other men's lives depending on me. I can carry out orders but I can't give them. I'm just a civilian with a couple of chevrons on my sleeve.""The Immortal Sergeant tells us the story of Colin Spence, a small-town reporter from Canada in England, who is shy and not really able to accomplish the things he wants. Please note that while elements of the plot are discussed, the key elements are all described on the DVD case. It's obvious Valentine (Maureen O'Hara) loves him but he just can't seem to recognize the signals. Just before he enlists, she and Colin meet an old friend of Colin's at a party. Benedict (Reginald Gardner) is now a famous war correspondent. ""Good old Colin. I tell you this lad has a head on his shoulders,"" says Benedict to Valentine. ""I'm afraid he's a little bit too self-effacing for the times, though. You know, like the good old democracies. Nice, but a little bit too civilized for his own good, eh Colin?"" Benedict smoothly moves in on Valentine and Colin can only look on.Spence keeps remembering Valentine while he and the rest of the patrol struggle through the desert. Now on foot, the sergeant leads the men in an attack on an isolated German armored car. They hope to find water and perhaps even capture the car and drive back to their own lines. The sergeant is clear about what they must do. ""This war, like every other war, is going to be won by men on their feet with guns in their hands. And don't you forget it,"" he tells them. But the car is destroyed in the attack, the cans of German water with it, and two more men in the patrol die. The sergeant is one of them. Colin Spence has no choice but to take command now. And slowly, as he faces the reality of the situation, he becomes more forceful and more resourceful. The three other men, one a little reluctantly, accept his leadership. He knows he doesn't have the answers. He relies on his memory of Sergeant Kelly and his memory of Valentine to keep him moving forward. At the climax, he leads a desperate attack on an oasis guarded by three times the number of Germans. It is an attack which is bravely led and fought.Back in a Cairo hospital, Colin Spence sums it up. ""I had to come all the way out here to meet a tough sergeant named Kelly who was born in a slum and educated in an army camp before I was fit for a woman like Valentine. He's dead now but he taught me one thing...if I ever want Valentine or anything else worthwhile in life I've got to fight for it. That's not a bad thing for a man to find out...or for a nation, either, for that matter...to fight.""This is an appealing war-time movie with little of the bravado and obvious emotional string-pulling of most war movies. Thomas Mitchell gives a fine performance and Maureen O'Hara would be any man's dream of the woman waiting back home. What takes this movie out-of-the-ordinary is Henry Fonda. Did any major Hollywood star, before or after, combine so effectively almost naive honesty, decency and acting skill. We sympathize with Colin Spence's shyness; we sympathize with Spence's nervousness at the idea of being in charge if his sergeant is killed; we see and approve of Spence's taking on the responsibility of leading the remaining men of the patrol; and we come to admire his dedication to do the right thing, to fight against the odds for a good cause. The Immortal Sergeant is a film that with time sort of slipped between the cracks. DVD has brought it back and it's worth seeing.The DVD transfer is just fine. There are no significant extras.",4,"An engaging wartime movie about a decent man, played by Henry Fonda, who learns to fight for a good cause",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,4293,"['know', 'anything', ""'re"", 'command', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Corporal', 'Colin', 'Spence', 'Henry', 'Fonda', ""'re"", 'lost', 'Libyan', 'desert', 'only', 'three', 'gallons', 'petrol', 'left', 'remaining', 'armored', 'car', 'almost', 'water', 'busted', 'compass', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'started', 'out', 'Corporal', 'Spence', 'twelve', 'other', 'men', 'routine', 'patrol', 'Three', 'German', 'fighters', 'changed', 'things', 'Now', 'only', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'Spence', 'four', 'others', 'Nothing', 'going', 'happen', 'sergeant', 'Spence', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'lad', 'can', 'help', 'Still', 'stop', 'packet', 'up', 'get', 'patrol', 'back', 'not', 'easy', 'job', ""'m"", 'leader', 'Spence', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'experience', 'take', 'up', 'command', 'other', 'men', 'lives', 'depending', 'can', 'carry', 'out', 'orders', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', ""'m"", 'just', 'civilian', 'couple', 'chevrons', 'sleeve', 'Immortal', 'Sergeant', 'story', 'Colin', 'Spence', 'small-town', 'reporter', 'Canada', 'England', 'who', 'shy', 'not', 'really', 'able', 'accomplish', 'things', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussed', 'key', 'elements', 'are', 'described', 'DVD', 'case', 'obvious', 'Valentine', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'recognize', 'signals', 'Just', 'Colin', 'meet', 'old', 'friend', 'Colin', 'party', 'Benedict', 'Reginald', 'Gardner', 'now', 'famous', 'war', 'correspondent', 'Good', 'old', 'Colin', 'tell', 'lad', 'head', 'shoulders', 'Benedict', 'Valentine', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'self-effacing', 'times', 'though', 'know', 'good', 'old', 'democracies', 'Nice', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'civilized', 'own', 'good', 'eh', 'Colin', 'Benedict', 'smoothly', 'Valentine', 'Colin', 'can', 'only', 'look', 'on.Spence', 'keeps', 'remembering', 'Valentine', 'rest', 'patrol', 'struggle', 'desert', 'Now', 'foot', 'sergeant', 'men', 'attack', 'isolated', 'German', 'armored', 'car', 'hope', 'find', 'water', 'perhaps', 'even', 'capture', 'car', 'drive', 'back', 'own', 'lines', 'sergeant', 'clear', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'war', 'other', 'war', 'going', 'be', 'won', 'men', 'feet', 'guns', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'car', 'destroyed', 'attack', 'cans', 'German', 'water', 'two', 'more', 'men', 'patrol', 'die', 'sergeant', 'one', 'Colin', 'Spence', 'choice', 'take', 'command', 'now', 'slowly', 'reality', 'situation', 'more', 'forceful', 'more', 'resourceful', 'three', 'other', 'men', 'one', 'little', 'reluctantly', 'accept', 'leadership', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'memory', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'memory', 'Valentine', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'climax', 'desperate', 'attack', 'oasis', 'guarded', 'three', 'times', 'number', 'Germans', 'attack', 'bravely', 'led', 'fought.Back', 'Cairo', 'hospital', 'Colin', 'Spence', 'sums', 'up', 'had', 'come', 'way', 'here', 'meet', 'tough', 'sergeant', 'named', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'slum', 'educated', 'army', 'camp', 'was', 'fit', 'woman', 'Valentine', 'dead', 'now', 'taught', 'one', 'thing', 'ever', 'want', 'Valentine', 'anything', 'else', 'worthwhile', 'life', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fight', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'man', 'find', 'out', 'nation', 'either', 'matter', 'fight', 'appealing', 'war-time', 'movie', 'little', 'bravado', 'obvious', 'emotional', 'string-pulling', 'most', 'war', 'movies', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'fine', 'performance', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'would', 'be', 'man', 'dream', 'woman', 'waiting', 'back', 'home', 'What', 'movie', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Did', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'combine', 'so', 'effectively', 'almost', 'naive', 'honesty', 'decency', 'acting', 'skill', 'sympathize', 'Colin', 'Spence', 'shyness', 'sympathize', 'Spence', 'nervousness', 'idea', 'being', 'charge', 'sergeant', 'killed', 'see', 'approve', 'Spence', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'leading', 'remaining', 'men', 'patrol', 'come', 'admire', 'dedication', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'fight', 'odds', 'good', 'cause', 'Immortal', 'Sergeant', 'film', 'time', 'sort', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'worth', 'seeing.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'significant', 'extras']",Immortal Sergeant
