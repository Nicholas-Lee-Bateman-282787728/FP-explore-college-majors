I was on edge, biting my fingernails. Holt Boggs gives a stunning performance as Truman Fisher; a mobster who tries to track down a crazed killer messing up their game. Though the mob has their own share of cruel hombres, the man they're hunting is 'off the charts'. Though the movie is a serious thriller and not for the squeamish, it does have comic moments that come at the right time, never nibbling the edge off the tension.What tops off Holt Bogg's performance was his expressive eyes. We know he's a killer too, but we see the humanity and the anguish in his manner and expressions. I've seen this overdone, but Boggs nails it perfectly. Had he been born in a earlier era he would've been a hit in the Silent Film industry; Boggs can show us all with his eyes. There were great scenes played by supporting actors as well, and the movie was well-written with a seamless, non-sagging feel to the dialogue.The Prodigy is a must watch for action/thriller lovers, and I know we'll be seeing Holt Bogg's in more leading roles.",5,Excellent!,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1127,"['short', 'list', 'films', 'can', 'keep', 'past', 'bedtime', 'one', 'accomplished', 'was', 'edge', 'biting', 'fingernails', 'Holt', 'Boggs', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Truman', 'Fisher', 'mobster', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'crazed', 'killer', 'messing', 'up', 'game', 'mob', 'own', 'share', 'cruel', 'hombres', 'man', ""'re"", 'hunting', 'charts', 'movie', 'serious', 'thriller', 'not', 'squeamish', 'have', 'comic', 'moments', 'come', 'right', 'time', 'never', 'nibbling', 'edge', 'tension.What', 'Holt', 'Bogg', 'performance', 'was', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'know', 'killer', 'too', 'see', 'humanity', 'anguish', 'manner', 'expressions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'overdone', 'Boggs', 'perfectly', 'Had', 'been', 'born', 'earlier', 'era', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hit', 'Silent', 'Film', 'industry', 'Boggs', 'can', 'show', 'eyes', 'were', 'great', 'scenes', 'played', 'supporting', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'well-written', 'seamless', 'non-sagging', 'feel', 'dialogue.The', 'Prodigy', 'must', 'watch', 'action/thriller', 'lovers', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'Holt', 'Bogg', 'more', 'leading', 'roles']",The Prodigy
1078502,A1RW8HSQ5XGIKK,B000R2PNTO,"David Alianiello ""Armadillo""","[20, 22]","Picked this movie up at a rental place on a whim; the concept sounded intriguing-crazy, lone-wolf assassin finds his potential replacement in the form of a lower-tier mob enforcer, and puts him through hell to see if he is worthy. Knowing it was a low budget independent production and fearing the worst, I was extremely pleased at the overall look of the film: acting, production values, special effects, music were all topnotch. And the story was tight and tense from beginning to end. But the thing that really stood out for me was the hand-to-hand combat scenes: brutal, fast and vicious streetfighting like you'd see in real life, not like in the ""movies.""

Instead, I watched a disturbing, yet riveting film about a consumate hitman searching for someone to follow in his footsteps. The ghost-like assassin tests the man he has chosen as replacement. Unknowing and unwilling, the replacement tries desperately to foil him and protect his love-interest and friends. The assassin kills them all to ""free"" the ""prodigy"" of the things that would hold him back from his destiny.There are no silly car chases or unrealistic shootouts. It is the tale of a sadistic, yet cerebral killer playing a deadly game with another human being to make the younger man worthy of becoming his replacement.This was certainly *not* my kind of movie.
