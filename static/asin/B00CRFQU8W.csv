The acting is superb and I especially like the fact there is a Canadian playing the oldest son.The shipping was faster than expected so that was definitely a pleasant surprise!!!!",5,"There is intrigue, suspense, lust, romance, murder, power mongering and so much more in this  superb mini-series.",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,565,"['Watched', 'most', 'series', 'TV', 'wanted', 'own', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'leisure', 'very', 'deep', 'subject', 'Vatican', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'when', 'necessary', 'completely', 'understand', 'all.Was', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'understand', 'accents', 'owning', 'can', 'watch', 'subtitles.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'fact', 'Canadian', 'playing', 'oldest', 'son.The', 'shipping', 'was', 'faster', 'expected', 'so', 'was', 'definitely', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",N/A

1650303,A2CISZ4JLKQRJA,B00CRFQU8W,C. Richard,"[0, 0]","There are two versions of the Borgia story that have come out recently - the one here by Showtime and the other by Canal +. They are different in many ways, but both are very good.The actors portraying the same characters in the different series interpret them quite differently. Jeremy Irons is a more believable Pope than the Canal + guy. But, La Bella in the Canal + version is a more believable papal mistress. Other such comparisons could be made.In many ways, the Canal+ version seemed to bring viewers more into the story than the other. Canal + gave a deeper experience is one way of putting it.But, that being said, each version is good and entertaining in itself. I'd recommend watching one then the other.Given that it is hard to separate fact from fiction in the history of the Borgias, I don't think it too productive to get into which series is more historically accurate - beyond major events which I'll leave to other reviewers to discuss. I watched more for entertainment than for a history lesson.The Borgias had a reputation for being ruthless and calculating among other less &#34;worthy&#34; traits. There is lots of that on display in both series. But, to be fair to them, were they just caught up in the times they lived in? I tend to think they were not really much worse than many of the people around them. The times were pretty unsettled.I recommend watching both versions.

I didn't like any of the Characters in the series.  I didn't see any good people that were fighting the good fight.The only one to come close to a hero was the Cardinal who had monkey to taste his food to ensure his food wasn't poison and he wasn't portrayed as likable. And the Monk who walked around preaching against the Debauchery of the Borgias was portrayed as a Mad Man.

There are some funny parts and some things that are far more taboo now than they were back then.  But this series has about as much basis in reality as a tabloid does.  I did some research and the real Borgia Pope had about 8 or 9 children, at least.  But, Lucrezia, Cesare, and Juan were his 3 favorites and they were by the same woman, Vanozza.  Aside from that and some other things like the fact that Cesare was a lot like his father and Juan was a wastrel, there isn't a lot fact in this series.After the first season it appears that the writers didn't know where to go with it so they focused, primarily, on the evolution of Lucrezia.  She was one of the, if not the most well known of her siblings and she had the most potential for character development and growth.  They also focused on the relationship between Lucrezia, her various lovers, loves, and suitors, as well as her family.  They also focused on the characters who had the most potential for controversy, like Juan's self-destructive behavior and Cesare becoming more like his father in some ways, but with different personal ambitions.  In other ways Cesare doesn't allow himself to become like his father.  That is because he has seen how many enemies being like his father will and have gained him.Overall, this is a GREAT SERIES WORTH WATCHING!  I DO NOT RECCOMMEND IT TO CHILDREN!  There is some minor graphic nudity and sexually explicit scenes.  There is also a LOT of graphic VIOLENCE.",5,Great Fictional Series Based on an Actual Family,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1536,"['Overall', 'great', 'series', 'plot', 'lines', 'acting', 'are', 'fabulous', 'are', 'funny', 'parts', 'things', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'taboo', 'now', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'basis', 'reality', 'tabloid', 'did', 'research', 'real', 'Borgia', 'Pope', 'had', '8', '9', 'children', 'least', 'Lucrezia', 'Cesare', 'Juan', 'were', '3', 'favorites', 'were', 'same', 'woman', 'Vanozza', 'Aside', 'other', 'things', 'fact', 'Cesare', 'was', 'lot', 'father', 'Juan', 'was', 'wastrel', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fact', 'series.After', 'first', 'season', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'focused', 'primarily', 'evolution', 'Lucrezia', 'was', 'one', 'not', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'siblings', 'had', 'most', 'potential', 'character', 'development', 'growth', 'also', 'focused', 'relationship', 'Lucrezia', 'various', 'lovers', 'loves', 'suitors', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'also', 'focused', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'potential', 'controversy', 'Juan', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'Cesare', 'becoming', 'more', 'father', 'ways', 'different', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'other', 'ways', 'Cesare', ""n't"", 'allow', 'become', 'father', 'seen', 'how', 'many', 'enemies', 'being', 'father', 'will', 'have', 'gained', 'him.Overall', 'GREAT', 'SERIES', 'WORTH', 'WATCHING', 'DO', 'NOT', 'RECCOMMEND', 'IT', 'TO', 'CHILDREN', 'minor', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'also', 'LOT', 'graphic', 'VIOLENCE']",N/A
