In it, I expressed my hope that Criterion would give this lovely movie the presentation it deserves.  Well, they've done it.  It's not been released yet and I suppose I should wait until my Criterion copy arrives, but they've done right by every movie they've released, so I don't expect to be let down.And, really, if you haven't seen this movie, you're missing something wonderful.  And truly sweet.-------------------------------------------------------------Earlier Review:So, call it 3.5 stars.  'Life Is Sweet' is one of my favorite movies but this is a rather poor DVD print (struck from VHS, it seems) .  Still, it's a small improvement over my cassette copy.  At least now I can stop worrying about the old VCR eating the tape every time I watch it.It's a shame that a movie this great doesn't get the presentation it deserves.  Hello, Criterion?

313171,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6302451930,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[12, 12]","In the early '90s when LIFE IS SWEET was released, the film made the top 10 lists of film critics everywhere, including Siskel and Ebert, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle.  So why hasn't this film made it to DVD??LIFE IS SWEET is the story of a set of twin teenage girls played by Claire Skinner and Jane Horrocks.  You'll recognize Claire and Jane if you're a BBC/PBS fan. Claire played a chef-in-training on 'Chef' and a lady cop on 'Second Sight'. Jane Horrocks is LITTLE VOICE and I believe she played 'Bubbles' in 'Absolutely Fabulous'.  Alison Steadman plays the mother in LIFE IS SWEET and she played Mrs. Bennett in 'Pride and Prejudice' (the most recent version with Colin Firth).Claire and Jane play their parts so well it is hard to believe they aren't real identical twins--even though they play very different characters. The first time I saw this film I thought the same girl was playing both roles (as did Hayey Mills in the 'Parent Trap'). The supporting cast includes many familiar faces including Jim Broadbent, whom I first noticed in 'Widow's Peake' though he also starred in the Gilbert and Sullivan film Mike Leigh produced a few years ago.LIFE IS SWEET is a story of teenage angst in an English working class family. One of the twins, Nicola (played by Jane Horrocks), has a problem with food. She starves herself when others are around and then gorges and purges in private (anorexia nervosa?). When Nicola and her boyfriend have sex she insists they do it with chocolate. Nicola dreams of taking her life beyond the narrow working-class world she inhabits. The other twin, played by Claire Skinner works as a plumber. She appears to be a practical and level-headed youngster, the kind most desired in traditional homes.Mike Leigh's best films, including LIFE IS SWEET, are stories about working-class youngsters coming of age (SECRETS AND LIES, CAREER GIRLS, MEANTIME).  These tales involve the arrival of the protagonist at a new level of awareness and personal resolution following a period of less than enthusiastic participation in a &quot;hostile&quot; world. In the end, Nicola finds her place in the world she inhabits and that life is sweet.",5,A top 10 classic....,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,2237,"['early', 'when', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'SWEET', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'made', 'top', '10', 'lists', 'film', 'critics', 'everywhere', 'including', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Times', 'Washington', 'Post', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'film', 'made', 'DVD', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'SWEET', 'story', 'set', 'twin', 'teenage', 'girls', 'played', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'Claire', 'Jane', ""'re"", 'BBC/PBS', 'fan', 'Claire', 'played', 'chef-in-training', ""'Chef"", 'lady', 'cop', ""'Second"", 'Sight', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'LITTLE', 'VOICE', 'believe', 'played', ""'Bubbles"", ""'Absolutely"", 'Fabulous', 'Alison', 'Steadman', 'mother', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'SWEET', 'played', 'Mrs.', 'Bennett', ""'Pride"", 'Prejudice', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'Colin', 'Firth', '.Claire', 'Jane', 'play', 'parts', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'identical', 'twins', 'even', 'play', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'thought', 'same', 'girl', 'was', 'playing', 'roles', 'did', 'Hayey', 'Mills', ""'Parent"", 'Trap', 'supporting', 'cast', 'many', 'familiar', 'including', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'whom', 'first', 'noticed', ""'Widow"", 'Peake', 'also', 'starred', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'film', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'produced', 'few', 'years', 'ago.LIFE', 'IS', 'SWEET', 'story', 'teenage', 'angst', 'English', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'One', 'twins', 'Nicola', 'played', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'problem', 'food', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'around', 'then', 'gorges', 'purges', 'private', 'anorexia', 'nervosa', 'When', 'Nicola', 'boyfriend', 'have', 'sex', 'do', 'chocolate', 'Nicola', 'dreams', 'taking', 'life', 'narrow', 'working-class', 'world', 'other', 'twin', 'played', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'plumber', 'be', 'practical', 'level-headed', 'youngster', 'kind', 'most', 'desired', 'traditional', 'homes.Mike', 'Leigh', 'best', 'films', 'including', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'SWEET', 'are', 'stories', 'working-class', 'youngsters', 'coming', 'age', 'SECRETS', 'AND', 'LIES', 'CAREER', 'GIRLS', 'MEANTIME', 'tales', 'involve', 'arrival', 'protagonist', 'new', 'level', 'awareness', 'personal', 'resolution', 'following', 'period', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'participation', 'quot', 'hostile', 'quot', 'world', 'end', 'Nicola', 'place', 'world', 'life', 'sweet']",N/A
313172,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,6302451930,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[2, 2]","I initially became familiar with Mike Leigh's work with ""Naked"" in 2006. Being an avid fan of Criterion I still remember purchasing Naked out of sheer curiosity with absolutely zero expectations. Upon my first viewing, I was blown away and ever since then, Mike Leigh has always been on my radar. Personally, I feel that his craftsmanship is poignant and superb when he is carefully orchestrating his characters. When a director puts so much effort and creativity into his characters like Mike Leigh does, Life is Sweet.Life is Sweet indeed, and even sweeter in North London where a working class family struggles financially, emotionally and mentally too. Despite their struggles, a strong and even more powerful sense of happiness and hope hang over this dysfunctional family.Andy, the father, is a senior chef in a large catering facility who hates his job but never lets this hatred obstruct his newly found passion for reinvigorating a shabby fast-food van. Wendy, the mother, who is outspokenly against this newly found passion respects her husbands ambitions. Their two identical twin daughters, Nicola and Natalie are a pair to be remembered. Their personalities and attitudes are different as night and day and their interaction is especially memorable. Every family has a slightly awkward but highly lovable friend and that is Aubrey. Aubrey, whose struggles are similar and yet different at the same time plans to open a Parisian-themed restaurant in London.Upon viewing this film, I couldn't help but to draw a strikingly similarity to an American television sitcom that I happened to love which was ""Married with Children""; two poor working class families that struggle everyday but simply manage to make the best in their social unit. They accept their struggles and live to fight another day.I feel that Mike Leigh has always one memorable and touching scene in his films. In Life is Sweet, Nicola and her mother have one of the most emotionally charged confrontations. In summary, Wendy frustratingly expresses the deep love that she and the rest of the family has for her. Nicola's alarming shield of bitterness and reclusive behavior is weakened and completely broken down. Ultimately, she becomes naked and breaks down sobbing.Behind this scene, is the conversation between Nicola and her boyfriend who is played by the brilliant David Thewlis nonetheless. He challenges her mental intellect and makes the claim that she is simply incapable of having any sort of an adult relationship. These two scenes are so important because they lead one into the other. Nicola's boyfriend drives her alarmingly antisocial behavior into another extreme which attracts the mother's attention and inevitably brings about a confrontational argument.",5,Mike Leigh Fulfills His Trademark: Brilliantly Crafted Characters,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2752,"['initially', 'became', 'familiar', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'work', 'Naked', '2006', 'Being', 'avid', 'fan', 'Criterion', 'still', 'remember', 'purchasing', 'Naked', 'sheer', 'curiosity', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'expectations', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'ever', 'then', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'always', 'been', 'radar', 'Personally', 'feel', 'craftsmanship', 'poignant', 'superb', 'when', 'carefully', 'orchestrating', 'characters', 'When', 'director', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'creativity', 'characters', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Life', 'Sweet.Life', 'Sweet', 'indeed', 'even', 'sweeter', 'North', 'London', 'where', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'financially', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'too', 'struggles', 'strong', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'sense', 'happiness', 'hope', 'hang', 'dysfunctional', 'family.Andy', 'father', 'senior', 'chef', 'large', 'catering', 'facility', 'who', 'job', 'never', 'hatred', 'obstruct', 'newly', 'found', 'passion', 'reinvigorating', 'shabby', 'fast-food', 'van', 'Wendy', 'mother', 'who', 'outspokenly', 'newly', 'found', 'passion', 'husbands', 'ambitions', 'two', 'identical', 'twin', 'daughters', 'Nicola', 'Natalie', 'are', 'pair', 'be', 'remembered', 'personalities', 'attitudes', 'are', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'interaction', 'especially', 'memorable', 'family', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'highly', 'lovable', 'friend', 'Aubrey', 'Aubrey', 'struggles', 'are', 'similar', 'yet', 'different', 'same', 'time', 'plans', 'open', 'Parisian-themed', 'restaurant', 'London.Upon', 'viewing', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'draw', 'strikingly', 'similarity', 'American', 'television', 'sitcom', 'happened', 'love', 'was', 'Married', 'Children', 'two', 'poor', 'working', 'class', 'families', 'struggle', 'everyday', 'simply', 'manage', 'make', 'best', 'social', 'unit', 'accept', 'struggles', 'live', 'fight', 'day.I', 'feel', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'always', 'one', 'memorable', 'touching', 'scene', 'films', 'Life', 'Sweet', 'Nicola', 'mother', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'confrontations', 'summary', 'Wendy', 'frustratingly', 'deep', 'love', 'rest', 'family', 'Nicola', 'alarming', 'shield', 'bitterness', 'reclusive', 'behavior', 'weakened', 'completely', 'broken', 'down', 'Ultimately', 'naked', 'breaks', 'down', 'sobbing.Behind', 'scene', 'conversation', 'Nicola', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'played', 'brilliant', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'nonetheless', 'mental', 'intellect', 'claim', 'simply', 'incapable', 'having', 'sort', 'adult', 'relationship', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'lead', 'one', 'other', 'Nicola', 'boyfriend', 'alarmingly', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'extreme', 'mother', 'attention', 'inevitably', 'brings', 'confrontational', 'argument']",N/A

Andy, the father, works as a supervisor for a large kitchen and he hates his job.  Andy is a dreamer that often does not get things done, but always starts countless new tasks as he has aspirations to start something new.  The mother, Wendy, works as a clerk in a small boutique that sells children's clothing and she teaches physical education in an elementary school.  Through a friend of the family she gets a night job as a waitress in a French gourmet restaurant in order to help the friend to get back on his feet.Wendy and Andy do what they can to make life tolerable and enjoyable.  They make the most of the ups and laugh at the downs.  Together Andy and Wendy have raised a pair of twins that are now twenty-something, Natalie and Nicola.  The positive Natalie is a hard working plumber who has inherited her hard working attitude from her mother, and she acquired her father's visionary skills as she aspires to go to the United States.  Nicole is the opposite of Natalie as she is exceedingly pessimistic, introspective, bulimic, nervous, depressed, and unemployed.Wendy and Andy's daughters, friends, and self-imposed friends brings them joy and misery.  Together they display an intriguing resilience to deal with the issues that trouble them through a positive, loving, and sometimes joking attitude.  Their knowledge of life is great as they do not worry over things they cannot control, but they are fully aware that they can control their own feelings towards life whether it is good or bad.  Natalie and Nicole become an allegorical example for the good and bad times as they are opposites, and the parents embrace both.Life is Sweet brings ""life"" to the audience through the family that experiences both ups and downs.  Mike Leigh's creative direction brings the cast together to rehearse before establishing the script.  These rehearsals often contain improvisation and suggestions from the cast which results in a unique cinematic experience with characters offering great depth.  Leigh truly displays skill and ambition to work in a team atmosphere in order to bring out the absolute best from each individual.  The outcome from the teamwork is an excellent cinematic experience as it feels both genuine and it offers some valuable lessons to the audience.",5,Mike Leigh Embraces the Roller Coaster of Life...,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,2393,"['story', 'family', 'outskirts', 'London', 'where', 'try', 'make', 'most', 'life', 'Andy', 'father', 'supervisor', 'large', 'kitchen', 'job', 'Andy', 'dreamer', 'often', 'not', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'always', 'countless', 'new', 'tasks', 'aspirations', 'start', 'something', 'new', 'mother', 'Wendy', 'clerk', 'small', 'boutique', 'children', 'clothing', 'physical', 'education', 'elementary', 'school', 'friend', 'family', 'night', 'job', 'waitress', 'French', 'gourmet', 'restaurant', 'order', 'help', 'friend', 'get', 'back', 'feet.Wendy', 'Andy', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'tolerable', 'enjoyable', 'make', 'most', 'ups', 'laugh', 'downs', 'Together', 'Andy', 'Wendy', 'have', 'raised', 'pair', 'twins', 'are', 'now', 'twenty-something', 'Natalie', 'Nicola', 'positive', 'Natalie', 'hard', 'working', 'plumber', 'who', 'inherited', 'hard', 'working', 'attitude', 'mother', 'acquired', 'father', 'visionary', 'skills', 'go', 'United', 'States', 'Nicole', 'opposite', 'Natalie', 'exceedingly', 'pessimistic', 'introspective', 'bulimic', 'nervous', 'depressed', 'unemployed.Wendy', 'Andy', 'daughters', 'friends', 'self-imposed', 'friends', 'joy', 'misery', 'Together', 'display', 'intriguing', 'resilience', 'deal', 'issues', 'trouble', 'positive', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'joking', 'attitude', 'knowledge', 'life', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'can', 'control', 'own', 'feelings', 'life', 'good', 'bad', 'Natalie', 'Nicole', 'become', 'allegorical', 'example', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'are', 'opposites', 'parents', 'embrace', 'both.Life', 'Sweet', 'life', 'audience', 'family', 'ups', 'downs', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'creative', 'direction', 'cast', 'together', 'rehearse', 'establishing', 'script', 'rehearsals', 'often', 'contain', 'improvisation', 'suggestions', 'cast', 'results', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'characters', 'offering', 'great', 'depth', 'Leigh', 'truly', 'skill', 'ambition', 'work', 'team', 'atmosphere', 'order', 'bring', 'out', 'absolute', 'best', 'individual', 'outcome', 'teamwork', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'genuine', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'audience']",N/A

Since then it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time, on a list that includes LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GOODFELLAS, REAR WINDOW and AMADEUS.Having said that, I will concede that this is not a film for everyone. Those who like mainstream Hollywood fare and consider Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock two of the greatest comic actresses of their generation probably won't like this movie. If, on the other hand, you like little independent films that are smart and different and truthful and absolutely one-of-a-kind, this may be right up your alley.It's offbeat. Absurd. At times even a little weird. And for all of those reasons it stands out for me as one of the truest depictions of family life I've ever seen on film, because most families are offbeat, absurd and at times even a little weird.The writing is superb -- you won't find many films with a finer ear for dialogue -- and the acting, in particular by Jane Horrocks, Alison Steadman and a very young David Thewlis, is mesmerizing.This film began my infatuation with the films of Mike Leigh, which continued a couple years later with the amazing NAKED, followed by SECRETS AND LIES, CAREER GIRLS, TOPSY TURVY, ALL OR NOTHING, VERA DRAKE, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY and most recently, ANOTHER YEAR.This is a film I've always come back to at least once a year, and each time I've been blown away by how wonderful it is -- but until April 2011, it was not available on DVD, except in Region 2 (Europe). And so for years I had to content myself with watching it on VHS! On a cathode-ray-tube television set! As soon as the Region 1 version became available on Amazon, I snatched it up immediately. I wish the transfer had been a bit better, although there's something about the roughness of the print that actually makes a film like this better.I've probably talked it up too much. It's never good to go into any film with too high expectations. At the end of the day, it's a little, low-budget independent film, but one that's full of some very big gifts for the discerning moviegoer.

313179,A2VXQL36IFQGKZ,6302451930,RALPH PETERS,"[17, 18]","Director/writer Mike Leigh's working methods are, by now, legendary.  He customarily gathers his hand-chosen cast well before filming begins to flesh out characters on their own based on his outline of events and then  encourages improvisation to allow the performer to inhabit the character,  rather than a stock, lifeless portrayal.  The actors aren't the only ones  to benefit from this theatre-like approach to filmmaking; Leigh's core  audiences eagerly await each entry to his already estimable canon with  great anticipation.  While SECRETS AND LIES is more dramatic and TOPSY  TURVY more cinematic, for me LIFE IS SWEET is the most memorable of his  films.  Perhaps its the sweet, world-weary musical score from the wonderful  Rachel Portman.  Or the concentration on just a few days in the lives of a  working-class British family and their small circle of friends.  Not to  mention the miraculous performances of Jane Horrocks as the anguished  Nicola--half of a twin sister set (the sublimely droll Claire Skinner is  her offset) and the triumphant, life-affirming work of Alison Steadman  (Leigh's real-life spouse) as Wendy, the earth-mother with seemingly  limitless patience.  Since this film, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Spall, David  Thewlis, and Stephen Rea have gone on to great successes in films like  ENCHANTED APRIL, THE CRYING GAME, NAKED, SHOOTING THE PAST, BULLETS OVER  BROADWAY, and TOPSY-TURVY, establishing themselves as invaluable players in  modern cinema, whether in lead or supporting roles.LIFE IS SWEET may  seem to not &quot;go anywhere&quot; in modern terms, but look closely and  the delightful, profoundly moving rewards will suprise you and no doubt  lead to repeated viewings, even if just to enjoy Ms Steadman's infectious  laugh.

I can see why he enjoys the reputation he has.  However, it should be fair to warn American viewers  that the sound quality is very poor in this film and, coupled with the  thick working-class accents of the characters, leads to much confusion  about what, exactly, is going on.  The film gains strength as it reaches  the midway point (the scene with the &quot;restaurant to which nobody  comes&quot; is funny and poignant), and it seems a shame that the film ends  just as you seem to be getting a fix on the characters.

The cast are are all off the English A list of players and then some as we meet Anne Horrocks and Timothy Spall in their earlier roles of a disfunction family of 4 plus friends and early peek at David Thewlis (two of these are fraternal twins as opposite as it ever gets).  I will nor spoil or soil the oddities forthcoming.There's not a sane bugger in whole bunch as the story unfolds and subtlely draws you in before you realize you are hooked. Kooky runs abundant as potty mouth and epervessant co-exist in the same family when the thread of love undefined sews a sweater of laughter and uncanny into a much misaligned family very comfortable in their own insults to, from, and aimed dead center toward each other with repetition (including all their close cohorts as friends).This corny and awesome film will eat it's way into your heart and subconscious. Witness Jim Broarbent, Allison Steadman (whose laughter tinklesover the top of entiire show) Anne Horrocks, Timothy Spalls, Claire Skinner, Stephen Rea, and David Thewlis in one of the most off beat comedies let loose on a public awaiting and unexpecting, this love letter of crooked but sincere hearts all sung to a beautiful musical score by Rachel Portman.

313182,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6302451930,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Not too long ago, I watched ""Another Year."" and I liked it a bit better than ""Life is Sweet,"" though that might just be because the characters in ""Another Year"" are closer to my age.  On its own terms, ""Life is Sweet"" is an absorbing movie.  Watching a Mike Leigh movie is a bit like reading Chekov or Alice Munro -- the aim of the artist is to reveal, and he or she is more interested in getting out what is to be revealed than in making the story fit a kind of preconceived plot-structure.  If you don't like that kind of thing, you might complain that the story or movie seems to just stop rather than end, but by that time we should know whatever it is the moviemaker or writer wants us to see about the characters.  And so it is here -- by the end, no problems are solved.  Andy (Jim Broadbent) still has the dilapidated fast-food van (and, with a broken leg, what is he going to do with it?), his daughter Nicola (Jane Horrocks) has not been cured of her bulimia, his friend Aubrey (Timothy Spall) has destroyed the interior of his French restaurant after a disappointing opening day, during which Andy's wife, Wendy (Alison Steadman) has been prepared to act as a waitress . . . but we have seen the characters interacting, and we have a sense of their distinctiveness and also a sense of their tenacity.This is Margaret Thatcher's Britain (c. 1990), and Wendy and Andy both work.  They married in their late teens, had twin girls, and are now around 40 and obviously wondering what lies in store for them.  Andy, who works as a chef in a corporate kitchen (and seems to be a person of authority there) buys the van from a dodgy friend (Stephen Rea) with no very clear idea of what he might do with it.  He seems to have an idea that it might be a way of his becoming independent.  He doesn't seem interested in working in his house or yard, but he isn't lazy -- he does his job and seems to do it well, even though it isn't all that satisfying.  Wendy, who works in a children's clothing store and seems to run an exercise class for kids, teases Andy pretty mildly about his hankering for more than he currently has, just as she doesn't shoot down in flames Aubrey's very odd ideas about a French restaurant.  Nor does she come down hard on her bulimic daughter -- in fact, she rather surprisingly, for most of the movie, leaves her to her own devices, without being indifferent or unkind.So . . . is she a kind of enabler? Is the movie a study in co-dependency?  no -- because Wendy in fact doesn't spend all her time catering to them.  She tries to help Aubrey out of the goodness of her heart because she seems to sense what his effort to open a restaurant means to him.  At the same time, she knows a disaster when she sees one and can walk away from it.  It would be truer to say that she is willing to let people go as far as they can in pursuit of whatever dreams and aspirations they might have.  The bulimic Nicola, for much of the movie, is permitted to play the role she has cast herself in, as a politically engaged, hard-edged critic of the world around her.  Only when that role can't be sustained and Nicola has an emotional collapse does Wendy step in and tell her daughter the truth -- that she wears t-shirts with slogans and mouths off about the state of things but never actually DOES anything.  In fact, we never see Nicola leave the house at all.  The remarkable thing about this scene is that Wendy is telling Nicola what she (Nicola) knows about herself and doing so in a way that reveals that Nicola's behavior has not alienated her family from her.  Wendy reminds Nicola -- and late in the movie we hear this for the first time -- that the family had to take her to hospital in a bulimic coma and that she nearly died.  What we, the audience, realize when we hear that is that nonetheless Wendy and Andy have given Nicola her space -- they have treated her as they would treat a normal person and not hovered over her anxiously.In a Hollywood version of this story, there would be hugs all round and general affirmation.  Not so here -- it's gentler, but it's matter-of-fact.  Wendy isn't going to let Nicola's life dominate hers.  A little earlier, Nicola's boyfriend (David Thewlis), who visits her in the house when the rest of her family are at work and reluctantly accedes to her desire to have him lick melted chocolate from her naked chest, finally calls a halt -- he in effect challenges her to be the intelligent person that, on some level, she is.  When he refuses to go upstairs for another chocolate session, she tells him to leave and goes into her emotional collapse.  The boyfriend, of course, has told Nicola a truth that she knows about herself, just as her mother does a little later.  And although Nicola says nothing much, we sense that she realizes two things -- that she is being told the truth, and that, in telling the truth, people like her mother and her boyfriend are manifesting a concern for her well-being without infantilizing her.  So the final scene in the movie is the right kind of ending for this kind of movie -- Nicola is sitting in the garden with her twin sister Natalie (Claire Skinner), who is poised, controlled, and gainfully employed as a plumber, when Natalie tells her that she has heard Nicola gorging and purging in the next room: she knows what she's doing.  Nicola is surprised that Natalie hasn't told her mother about this reversion to the behavior that almost killed her and asks her why she hasn't ratted her out.  Natalie just says, ""I think you should be the one to tell her.""  In other words, here is another person talking as if Natalie is in fact responsible for her own life.And that's it.  Will Nicola make an effort?  She's more at ease in that final scene, though not totally comfortable, but she isn't the twitchy mess we've seen earlier.  That's as upbeat as it gets, consistent with the realistic portrayal of the problems up to that point.  The acting throughout has been fine, but at the end, Steadman, Horrocks, Skinner, and even Thewlis do remarkable jobs in scenes that one might be tempted to chew the scenery in.  To their credit, they keep us in the company of people we can take as real.",5,Mike Leigh -- the Chekov of British cinema?,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,6197,"['Not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'watched',

Since then, I think I have been able to see Leigh for what he is: An incredibly gifted storyteller. I no longer feel the need to search his movies for some overblown message or statement, but rather just allow myself to enter into the lives of the intriguing characters he presents to us, walk with them on their journey, and learn with them as they learn about themselves.Life is Sweet is generally lighter fare than, say, his much later Secrets and Lies or All or Nothing, but it is no less compelling. The main characters are well-sketched, their humorous idiosyncracies never quite overstepping the mark into caricature (apart from some of the supporting characters, perhaps), and given enough depth and complexity to avoid the impression that Leigh is patronizing towards them (in a way that a lesser storyteller, such as Willy Russell, often appears).Life is Sweet is very funny, very warm, but also very human and poignant, with a few moments of grittiness. The ensemble of actors, including Jim Broadbent, Alison Steadman and (a very young) Timothy Spall deliver superb performances.
