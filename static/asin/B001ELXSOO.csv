The film shows the ugly truth of drug addition. The Kung Fu Master who thinks his casual use of Opium is harmless. Soon learns the folly of his actions. As he first looses some of his student to the drug and then himself. In the end he tries to redeem himself, fight off the druglords that control it, and honor his fallen students.",5,Addiction can get you Killed!,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,409,"['true', 'Shaw', 'Brother', 'Classic', 'Great', 'fighting', 'Sceens', 'real', 'drama', 'too', 'film', 'ugly', 'truth', 'drug', 'addition', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Master', 'who', 'casual', 'use', 'Opium', 'harmless', 'Soon', 'folly', 'actions', 'student', 'drug', 'then', 'end', 'redeem', 'fight', 'off', 'druglords', 'control', 'honor', 'fallen', 'students']",Opium and Kung Fu Master

I'd never heard of this movie until I read the review on bluray.com and since the price was so reasonable on Amazon, I decided to buy it.The plot is predictable and laughingly melodramatic - my wife and I sat there cracking up at the cheesy acting - but the fight scenes are very well executed. And there are plenty of fight scenes, starting up at the slightest provocation.The picture quality in blu ray is excellent, especially considering the age of the movie. Sound quality is okay, about as good as you can expect. The sound effects of things like swords clinking against each other are pretty repetitive, just the same effect used over and over no matter what part of the swords hit each other.If you want a good martial arts action flick and aren't looking for something deep, plus you want good picture quality, this movie would be a good choice.",4,Entertaining,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1008,"['are', 'looking', 'lot', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'well', 'choreographed', 'worth', 'spending', 'money', 'get', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', 'blu', 'ray', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'read', 'review', 'bluray.com', 'price', 'was', 'so', 'reasonable', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'buy', 'it.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'laughingly', 'melodramatic', 'wife', 'sat', 'there', 'cracking', 'up', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'are', 'plenty', 'fight', 'scenes', 'starting', 'up', 'slightest', 'provocation.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'excellent', 'especially', 'considering', 'age', 'movie', 'Sound', 'quality', 'okay', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'expect', 'sound', 'effects', 'things', 'swords', 'clinking', 'other', 'are', 'pretty', 'repetitive', 'just', 'same', 'effect', 'used', 'matter', 'what', 'part', 'swords', 'hit', 'other.If', 'want', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'flick', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'something', 'deep', 'want', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice']",Opium and Kung Fu Master

The transfer does have a few grain issues but overall it looks really good.To me this was just not one of the better of the Shaw Brothers movies.It deals with the Opium issues that China went thru during the western invasion.  However, I just did not feel for the characters. I also thought there was not enough KF action.Ti Lung always gives a good performance, however, this is not one of his better movies.",3,It was decent,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,492,"['Ti', 'Lung', 'Shaw', 'brother', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'transfer', 'have', 'few', 'grain', 'issues', 'overall', 'really', 'good.To', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'movies.It', 'deals', 'Opium', 'issues', 'China', 'went', 'thru', 'western', 'invasion', 'However', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'characters', 'also', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'KF', 'action.Ti', 'Lung', 'always', 'good', 'performance', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'movies']",Opium and Kung Fu Master
