1650679,A17Y465UXZOJE3,B00CSCKL0C,Stickman,"[11, 14]","Note: There are 2 versions of this movie. One is a single DVD, Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure and the other is this 5 DVD set, Monumental: Restoring America As The Land of Liberty. The 5 DVD set contains the movie (disk 5) and 4 additional disks of additional information plus a book. Both are recommened, but I recommend this one because you get a lot for your money.Kirk Cameron is to be congratulated on a great job with this movie. The movie is a little like a mystery and the ending is way better than expected. A lot of people are going to hate this movie. Not because its a bad movie, but because it's such a very good movie. Facts are a stubborn thing. They don't go away just because you don't like them. Watch it America. Learn who you are, and your lost history. I also recommend Runaway Slave to go with this. Completely different movie, but another gem of independent movie making about America.I read the negative comments (1 star) on the single disk DVD for this movie and they are just comical. It's really like most did not watch the movie because they make claims that are easily shown to be untrue. Just watch the DVDs and decide for yourself.",5,Shoud be nominated for an Oscar. Well done movie on a very important issue.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1184,"['Note', 'are', '2', 'versions', 'movie', 'One', 'single', 'DVD', 'Monumental', 'Search', 'America', 'National', 'Treasure', 'other', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'Monumental', 'Restoring', 'America', 'Land', 'Liberty', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'movie', 'disk', '5', '4', 'additional', 'disks', 'additional', 'information', 'book', 'are', 'recommened', 'recommend', 'one', 'get', 'lot', 'money.Kirk', 'Cameron', 'be', 'congratulated', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'movie', 'little', 'mystery', 'ending', 'way', 'better', 'expected', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'such', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Facts', 'are', 'stubborn', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Watch', 'America', 'Learn', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'history', 'also', 'recommend', 'Runaway', 'Slave', 'go', 'Completely', 'different', 'movie', 'gem', 'independent', 'movie', 'making', 'America.I', 'read', 'negative', 'comments', '1', 'star', 'single', 'disk', 'DVD', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'comical', 'really', 'like', 'most', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'claims', 'are', 'easily', 'shown', 'be', 'untrue', 'Just', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'decide']",Monumental: Restoring America As The Land of Liberty
