Animation style itself was detailed and very colorful. There were a few interesting twists and the relationships between the various team members were enjoyable to see (unrequited love, friendship, etc)Bad points:English dub: the voice actors shouted most of their lines. They weren't ""acting"" them. They traded volume for emotion. It does come with Japanese language/English sub setting though, so not too much of a drawback.Some of the episodes seemed to be kind of unorganized. The plot itself is original, but the plot elements (what happened episode-to-episode) were not (for example; two people who argue a lot switching bodies, de-aging, turning into an animal, etc). It also became increasingly repititious (every single episode, Nina would get in some kind of trouble, the boys would rescue her, we might meet a new team, we see a rather overused piece of animation showing their powers - it was pretty much the same thing every episode - just with slightly different problems).I both liked and disliked the ending. (Trying not to give anything away, sorry if I do) The pearl twist was interesting. What I don't like is that she doesn't choose. It's great that they can all be together, but still disappointing. I understand why they did that, but still don't like it.Overall: it's a cute watch for say a rainy day, definitely for girls, and there will be quite a few who would appreciate this - there are some cute romance type scenes and cute boys. Maybe not for anime lovers.If you do buy it, I recommend watching it in Japanese - it really does improve it.",3,Cute but disappointing.,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,1724,"['are', 'lot', 'girls', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'them.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'good', 'points', 'first', 'rather', 'cute', 'funny', 'moments', 'Animation', 'style', 'was', 'detailed', 'very', 'colorful', 'were', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'relationships', 'various', 'team', 'members', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'unrequited', 'love', 'friendship', 'etc', 'Bad', 'points', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'actors', 'shouted', 'most', 'lines', 'were', ""n't"", 'acting', 'traded', 'volume', 'emotion', 'come', 'Japanese', 'language/English', 'sub', 'setting', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'drawback.Some', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'be', 'kind', 'unorganized', 'plot', 'original', 'plot', 'elements', 'what', 'happened', 'episode-to-episode', 'were', 'not', 'example', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'argue', 'lot', 'switching', 'bodies', 'de-aging', 'turning', 'animal', 'etc', 'also', 'became', 'increasingly', 'repititious', 'single', 'episode', 'Nina', 'would', 'get', 'kind', 'trouble', 'boys', 'would', 'rescue', 'might', 'meet', 'new', 'team', 'see', 'rather', 'overused', 'piece', 'animation', 'showing', 'powers', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'episode', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'problems', '.I', 'liked', 'disliked', 'ending', 'Trying', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'sorry', 'do', 'pearl', 'twist', 'was', 'interesting', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'choose', 'great', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'still', 'disappointing', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.Overall', 'cute', 'watch', 'say', 'rainy', 'day', 'definitely', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'few', 'who', 'would', 'appreciate', 'are', 'cute', 'romance', 'type', 'scenes', 'cute', 'boys', 'Maybe', 'not', 'anime', 'lovers.If', 'do', 'buy', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'really', 'improve']",Save Me!

She soon gets her wish times two, but trouble came with it. Two boys, Zero and Ichii, are sorcerers from another world. They are taking part in a highly competitive test with a lot at stake. The test is taken in pairs and many sorcerers are participating, but only one team can pass. And the only way to pass is to find the small Crystal Pearl that was dropped on Earth. However, Nina mistaking the Crystal Pearl for a piece of candy, ate it! Desperate to win, the sorcerer teams will go to any lengths to get the Crystal Pearl even if it means harming Nina. Zero and Ichii take it upon themselves to keep Nina and the Crystal Pearl safe until time runs out on the test. Though they have magical powers of there own, it won't be easy fighting off so many other teams with their own magic.This is an adorable and cute anime. The story is a bit unorganized at times and repetitive. It's also fast-paced, sometimes too fast, but exciting with lots of magical battles. There is lots of humor and it's creative and fun. The characters are unique and lovable and keep things interesting. There is even a little romance. The artwork is very colorful and the voices are more high-pitched and cute sounding. It's an enjoyable anime to watch.
