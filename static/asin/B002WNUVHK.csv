He was by far the best of the group.  He still tells a lot of ""fat"" jokes, but he was funny nonetheless.  Arnez J. should retire, he was the pits.  I got a few laughs from Earthquake.

D.L. doesn't disappoint as host! Arnez J and Melanie Comarcho do a decent job but Earthquake and Lavell absolutely murder the stage!! I've watched this 3 times since purchasing!

I was disappointed by Arnez J.  He's usually very funny, but this routine was weak.  He tells these stories that aren't funny at all, and then he told that same recycled joke about his brother Rodney. He needs some new material. Interestingly enough, I've never considered DL funny but he was really funny on this.  The female told some funny jokes but her delivery was wack.  It was like she was reading a que card or something.  I watched about 3 minutes of Earthquake, got sick of hearing the ""f"" and ""b"" words so i skipped through the rest of his, so I don't know how funny he was. Lavelle was the star of this one!  He was soooooooo funny.  His joke about McDonalds salads was hilarious.I liked the other one better than this.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","I'm always hesitant to rent (or purchase) comedy DVDs (or see live comedians) who I'm not 100% positive will be funny because it's usually a downer. In this case, everybody was. Lavell Crawford kept making these crazy faces that made me think he IS the guy he doesn't want to see on the news. I've never been able to get into Melanie Comarcho. The handicapped jokes from Arnez J. got old way before this DVD came out, in addition to that crazy walk he does. I just cannot get into his skits, but I tried. Him constantly laughing and making these wavery voice made it worse; it's like he thought he was FAR funnier than the entire audience. That's cool to do when you can deliver, but if you can't, it looks weird. I usually think Earthquake is cool, but I don't even remember one joke he told so that tells you how much of an impact he left. I got SO tired of the comedians talking directly to Shaq. Yes, we know he's in the audience, but could we hear about something else and let him (and me) enjoy the show? I'm 50/50 on D.L. Hughley. I know this has nothing to do with nothing, but I think he's cute and incredibly nice in person so I play favorites immediately. (Just being honest.) But he started off slow, too. When he came back out and talked about black dog owners, I FINALLY cracked a smile. But that shouldn't be the only time I smile through the whole DVD. I never laughed once. I'm hoping the other DVD with Kevin Hart and Cedric the Entertainer is better.",1,Smiled once the entire time,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,1469,"[""'m"", 'always', 'hesitant', 'rent', 'purchase', 'comedy', 'DVDs', 'see', 'live', 'comedians', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', '100', '%', 'positive', 'will', 'be', 'funny', 'usually', 'downer', 'case', 'everybody', 'was', 'Lavell', 'Crawford', 'kept', 'making', 'crazy', 'made', 'think', 'guy', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'news', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'Melanie', 'Comarcho', 'handicapped', 'jokes', 'Arnez', 'J.', 'got', 'old', 'way', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'addition', 'crazy', 'walk', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'skits', 'tried', 'Him', 'constantly', 'laughing', 'making', 'wavery', 'voice', 'made', 'worse', 'thought', 'was', 'FAR', 'funnier', 'entire', 'audience', 'cool', 'do', 'when', 'can', 'deliver', 'ca', ""n't"", 'weird', 'usually', 'think', 'Earthquake', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'one', 'joke', 'told', 'so', 'tells', 'how', 'much', 'impact', 'left', 'got', 'SO', 'tired', 'comedians', 'talking', 'directly', 'Shaq', 'Yes', 'know', 'audience', 'could', 'hear', 'something', 'else', 'let', 'enjoy', 'show', ""'m"", '50/50', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'know', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'think', 'cute', 'incredibly', 'nice', 'person', 'so', 'play', 'favorites', 'immediately', 'Just', 'being', 'honest', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'too', 'When', 'came', 'back', 'out', 'talked', 'black', 'dog', 'owners', 'FINALLY', 'cracked', 'smile', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'time', 'smile', 'whole', 'DVD', 'never', 'laughed', 'once', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'other', 'DVD', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'better']",Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam - Live From South Beach
