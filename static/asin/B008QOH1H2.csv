It realistically depicts the beauty of endearing childhood love, the frailty of humanity and the corrupting power of the affluent over the poor, who pay the ultimate price. I believe this still goes on to this date all over the universe as we speak and that is the sad realty this movie clearly shows, in my opinion.",5,A good movie about endearing love in a sad situation,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,492,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'beginning', 'till', 'end', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'story', 'interesting', 'regardless', 'how', 'realistically', 'beauty', 'endearing', 'childhood', 'love', 'frailty', 'humanity', 'corrupting', 'power', 'affluent', 'poor', 'who', 'pay', 'ultimate', 'price', 'believe', 'still', 'date', 'universe', 'speak', 'sad', 'realty', 'movie', 'clearly', 'opinion']",Tokyo Playboy Club

1574316,A27L60JENYODDV,B008QOH1H2,Harvey Woodmeadow,"[2, 4]","The friend of a nightclub owner seeks refuge with him. The nightclub owner is trying to keep things together, between his expenses, dealing with the local mob, less-than-loyal employees, and now his newly-arrived friend who has an anger-management problem and a fundamental lack of self-preservation. Suffice to say, he's got his hands full.I'll second the motion to compare this to Tarantino's work.I would disagree with the idea that this is a comedy of any sort, even a ""dark"" one. And while there were a few places where it was funny, they are more along the lines of Pulp Fiction ""such a surprise instance of a random misfortune"" funny (e.g. when in P.F. they accidentally shot the guy in the car), rather than ""ha ha"" funny.There's definitely influence from Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, etc. here. ""Gritty"" is a good word to describe this story about a day (or a few) gone bad in the lives of some ex-small-time-gangsters. The raw-but-credible violence, with real characters and relationships, is a page right out of Tarantino's book (well, the one he uses for movies like that, as opposed to e.g. Kill Bill).The movie fails to fully explain at least one relationship (is she his sister? his estranged-but-still-resident girlfriend?), and ends with at least a couple of loose ends. But these aren't really a problem; if anything, they fit with the jagged edge of reality that the movie is portraying.There's less than ten or fifteen seconds of laughs tops in this movie, but it's well worth watching for the story and presentation.",4,Tarantino does Tokyo,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1538,"['friend', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'refuge', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'together', 'expenses', 'dealing', 'local', 'mob', 'less-than-loyal', 'employees', 'now', 'newly-arrived', 'friend', 'who', 'anger-management', 'problem', 'fundamental', 'lack', 'self-preservation', 'Suffice', 'say', 'got', 'hands', 'full.I', ""'ll"", 'second', 'motion', 'compare', 'Tarantino', 'work.I', 'would', 'disagree', 'idea', 'comedy', 'sort', 'even', 'dark', 'one', 'were', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'funny', 'are', 'more', 'lines', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'such', 'surprise', 'instance', 'random', 'misfortune', 'funny', 'e.g', 'when', 'P.F', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'guy', 'car', 'rather', 'ha', 'ha', 'definitely', 'influence', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'etc', 'here', 'Gritty', 'good', 'word', 'describe', 'story', 'day', 'few', 'gone', 'bad', 'lives', 'ex-small-time-gangsters', 'raw-but-credible', 'violence', 'real', 'characters', 'relationships', 'page', 'right', 'Tarantino', 'book', 'well', 'one', 'movies', 'opposed', 'e.g', 'Kill', 'Bill', '.The', 'movie', 'fails', 'fully', 'explain', 'least', 'one', 'relationship', 'sister', 'estranged-but-still-resident', 'girlfriend', 'least', 'couple', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'problem', 'anything', 'fit', 'jagged', 'edge', 'reality', 'movie', 'less', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'laughs', 'tops', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'presentation']",Tokyo Playboy Club
