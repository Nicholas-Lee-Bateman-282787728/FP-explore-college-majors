No attempts have been made to clean up the picture so it is snowy in places and the sound quality is not that great.  Some nice interviews here including commentary by Frank Oz but in many places I found it boring and I LOVE Jim Henson and all that he accomplished.  Unless you are a super diehard fan watch Labyrinth or The Muppet Show instead.,3,Not Bad but Not the Best,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,390,"['old', 'special', 'done', 'television', 'attempts', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'clean', 'up', 'picture', 'snowy', 'places', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'nice', 'interviews', 'here', 'including', 'commentary', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'many', 'places', 'found', 'boring', 'LOVE', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'accomplished', 'are', 'super', 'diehard', 'fan', 'watch', 'Labyrinth', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'instead']",N/A

It was nice to see interviews with Jim Henson and the gang. Unfortunately, this documentary is way too short at around 50 minutes. It skims over Henson's Sam and Friends show (which was on for 8 years), barely mentions Dark Crystal, and doesn't even cover Labyrinth. The documentary was obviously made during the 1980s and aired during an hour-long segment of TV.However, now more than ever it's crucial that somebody go back and make a fitting tribute to Henson, covering his work in greater depth. The art of puppetry for film is dying out. There are a few signs of revival, such as renewed interest in Fraggle Rock and the new Muppets movie, but generally CG is taking over. In a few years, it will be impossible for people to understand why we loved the Muppets so much as kids.As the only documentary I've seen thus far, Henson's Place is good for what it does, but hopefully not the final word.",4,"great biopic, but not enough",1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1011,"['Muppet', 'fans', 'nice', 'little', 'biopic', 'Henson', 'life', 'achievements', 'Muppets', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'interviews', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'gang', 'Unfortunately', 'documentary', 'way', 'too', 'short', '50', 'minutes', 'Henson', 'Sam', 'Friends', 'show', 'was', '8', 'years', 'barely', 'mentions', 'Dark', 'Crystal', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'Labyrinth', 'documentary', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', '1980s', 'aired', 'hour-long', 'segment', 'TV.However', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'crucial', 'somebody', 'go', 'back', 'make', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Henson', 'covering', 'work', 'greater', 'depth', 'art', 'puppetry', 'film', 'dying', 'out', 'are', 'few', 'signs', 'revival', 'such', 'renewed', 'interest', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'new', 'Muppets', 'movie', 'generally', 'CG', 'taking', 'over', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'impossible', 'people', 'understand', 'why', 'loved', 'Muppets', 'so', 'much', 'kids.As', 'only', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'Henson', 'Place', 'good', 'what', 'hopefully', 'not', 'final', 'word']",N/A

Since if you are from a generation which remembers Jim Henson's work and how influential it was, then this DVD will satisfy those memories. There is so much I could write about Henson's work and we all know how important it was to so many people around the world that this release could have offered more as he was one of the great figures in American culture who showed the world that imaginative ideas can shape the world for the better and that more than anything is Henson's legacy, the power of the rebellious imagination in the face of oppressive convention. As with the newest Sesame Street DVD, 40 Years of Sunny Days,which holds interviews with Jim Henson, this DVD presents us similarly with early footage showing the mans genius at work, it reminded me that it wasn't only his creative eye which gave Henson's work distinction but how he saw the world, he truly believed that nothing was impossible and he saw that we are essentially all the same, one big family and his worlds showed this, always affirming that belief and we were, as an audience part of his vision for a better world and it was more full filling and more rewarding an idea than the political structures which surrounded us as children at that time. He was at heart an artist, a positive thinker and this shaped his success and so possibilities did open up for him, however it was hard work! If you are a devoted Henson follower then I don't need to convince you to buy this DVD but if you are part of a generation who missed him, well do buy it because it is a phenomenal echo which will give you an insight into that world of film and television, the best of what was achieved is there in Henson's story and I can assure you it is all true and there is much more to tell making his story inspiring for anyone who has a growing imagination.",5,Thank you Jim Henson,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1952,"['could', 'write', 'review', 'everything', 'DVD', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'are', 'generation', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'work', 'how', 'influential', 'was', 'then', 'DVD', 'will', 'satisfy', 'memories', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'write', 'Henson', 'work', 'know', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'release', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'more', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'figures', 'American', 'culture', 'who', 'showed', 'world', 'imaginative', 'ideas', 'can', 'shape', 'world', 'better', 'more', 'anything', 'Henson', 'legacy', 'power', 'rebellious', 'imagination', 'face', 'oppressive', 'convention', 'newest', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'DVD', '40', 'Years', 'Sunny', 'Days', 'interviews', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'DVD', 'similarly', 'early', 'footage', 'showing', 'mans', 'genius', 'work', 'reminded', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'creative', 'eye', 'gave', 'Henson', 'work', 'distinction', 'how', 'saw', 'world', 'truly', 'believed', 'nothing', 'was', 'impossible', 'saw', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'one', 'big', 'family', 'worlds', 'showed', 'always', 'affirming', 'belief', 'were', 'audience', 'part', 'vision', 'better', 'world', 'was', 'more', 'full', 'filling', 'more', 'rewarding', 'idea', 'political', 'structures', 'surrounded', 'children', 'time', 'was', 'heart', 'artist', 'positive', 'thinker', 'shaped', 'success', 'so', 'possibilities', 'did', 'open', 'up', 'however', 'was', 'hard', 'work', 'are', 'devoted', 'Henson', 'follower', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'convince', 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'part', 'generation', 'who', 'missed', 'well', 'do', 'buy', 'phenomenal', 'echo', 'will', 'give', 'insight', 'world', 'film', 'television', 'best', 'what', 'was', 'achieved', 'there', 'Henson', 'story', 'can', 'assure', 'true', 'much', 'more', 'tell', 'making', 'story', 'inspiring', 'anyone', 'who', 'growing', 'imagination']",N/A
1353758,A34VV0DDR0OFE5,B003LR5BCQ,K. Rowley,"[33, 33]","This video is a documentary from around 1985. It profiles Jim Henson and some of the people that worked for him. Since the film was made in the mid-80s, it covers his work with Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, and Fraggle Rock - plus, a little bit of the early muppet movies and Dark Crystal. Keep in mind that the documentary is only about an hour long, so it doesn't go into a lot of depth. The thing that I think makes this such a great documentary are the personal interviews with Jim Henson, Jane Henson, Frank Oz and Lord Grade. If you are a Jim Henson fan and don't already have this in your collection you will probably want a copy.The video is full-frame (1.33:1, not widescreen) and has both English/Spanish subtitles. The only extra is a 30 minute feature on the 1985/86 ""Amphibian"", a year book that was produced highlighting all the people and departments of the Henson companies around the world. The first 7 minutes is an introduction by Michael Frith - who was the ""Faculty Advisor"" for the book's creation. The rest of the feature is a non-interactive video slide show of the pages of the book. There are a number of trailers for some new Lionsgate films on the dvd too - then animated film ""Alpha and Omega"" looks interesting.",5,Excellent Documentary,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1243,"['video', 'documentary', '1985', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'people', 'worked', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'mid-80s', 'work', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'plus', 'little', 'bit', 'early', 'muppet', 'movies', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Keep', 'mind', 'documentary', 'only', 'hour', 'long', ""n't"", 'go', 'lot', 'depth', 'thing', 'think', 'such', 'great', 'documentary', 'are', 'personal', 'interviews', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Jane', 'Henson', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Lord', 'Grade', 'are', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'collection', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'copy.The', 'video', 'full-frame', '1.33:1', 'not', 'widescreen', 'English/Spanish', 'subtitles', 'only', 'extra', '30', 'minute', 'feature', '1985/86', 'Amphibian', 'year', 'book', 'was', 'produced', 'highlighting', 'people', 'departments', 'Henson', 'companies', 'world', 'first', '7', 'minutes', 'introduction', 'Michael', 'Frith', 'who', 'was', 'Faculty', 'Advisor', 'book', 'creation', 'rest', 'feature', 'non-interactive', 'video', 'slide', 'show', 'pages', 'book', 'are', 'number', 'trailers', 'new', 'Lionsgate', 'films', 'dvd', 'too', 'then', 'animated', 'film', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'interesting']",N/A
