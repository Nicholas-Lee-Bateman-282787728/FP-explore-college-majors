We had never heard of this movie but decided to give it a chance.  Am I ever glad we did.  We both enjoyed it.  I wanted to see it again but unfortunately we attended the last showing in our area.  I have been monitoring the internet to find out when it was coming out.  I can hardly wait to see it again and have recommended it to several people.  It is not ""glossy"" but very sweet and moving.  No special effects, just a nice character driven movie about very ""human"" human beings.  Really enoyed it.",5,Very engaging movie,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,605,"['adult', 'son', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'do', 'one', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'last', 'year', 'December', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'Am', 'ever', 'glad', 'did', 'enjoyed', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'unfortunately', 'attended', 'last', 'showing', 'area', 'have', 'been', 'monitoring', 'internet', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'have', 'recommended', 'several', 'people', 'not', 'glossy', 'very', 'sweet', 'moving', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'nice', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'very', 'human', 'human', 'beings', 'Really', 'enoyed']",Noelle

It is one of the best films I have seen in 2008, and one of the best Christmas themed movie I've ever viewed.  The story is well-written, convincingly acted, and beautifully shot.  Best of all, it makes profound points about forgiveness, community, restoration, the preciousness of life, and the grace of God.Watching this film for me was like eating a delicious home-cooked meal after weeks of fast food.  The contrast between this truly creative story and its portrayal of interesting and complex human characters and the predictable and derivative films of the Hollywood system was bracing.  It was encouraging simply to be reminded that creative and thoughtful people of integrity can produce quality works of art.  Kudos to all the folks involved with ""Noelle.""  It was a great Christmas present to me and my wife.",5,Excellent film,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,878,"['was', 'definitely', 'caught', 'surprise', 'film', 'Noelle', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', '2008', 'one', 'best', 'Christmas', 'themed', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'viewed', 'story', 'well-written', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Best', 'profound', 'points', 'forgiveness', 'community', 'restoration', 'preciousness', 'life', 'grace', 'God.Watching', 'film', 'was', 'eating', 'delicious', 'home-cooked', 'meal', 'weeks', 'fast', 'food', 'contrast', 'truly', 'creative', 'story', 'portrayal', 'interesting', 'complex', 'human', 'characters', 'predictable', 'derivative', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'was', 'bracing', 'was', 'encouraging', 'simply', 'be', 'reminded', 'creative', 'thoughtful', 'people', 'integrity', 'can', 'produce', 'quality', 'works', 'art', 'Kudos', 'folks', 'involved', 'Noelle', 'was', 'great', 'Christmas', 'present', 'wife']",Noelle
1181224,A3DABNO1HS997Q,B001DHXT8O,J. kingman,"[0, 0]","I stumbled across this film quite by accident, and was so pleased with this quiet, calm story. In the midst of loud, tasteless, and fast-paced Christmas movies that we are assaulted with every holiday season, this film stands out.  It's a story of redemption, the search for an authentic life, and making difficult choices. There is also the budding of a very special romance as well. The music is haunting and beautiful. The transitional scenes where there is no dialogue are so charming and carry much meaning.There is just a tad bit of stiff acting by a couple of secondary characters, but don't let that sway you if you get the chance to see this film. It's part of my holiday collection and I watch it along with my other favorites every Christmas season. There is also a nice local, small-town feel to it (filmed on Cape Cod, MA).",4,Nice Christmas Movie,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,836,"['stumbled', 'film', 'quite', 'accident', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'quiet', 'calm', 'story', 'midst', 'loud', 'tasteless', 'fast-paced', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'are', 'assaulted', 'holiday', 'season', 'film', 'out', 'story', 'redemption', 'search', 'authentic', 'life', 'making', 'difficult', 'choices', 'also', 'budding', 'very', 'special', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'transitional', 'scenes', 'where', 'dialogue', 'are', 'so', 'charming', 'carry', 'much', 'just', 'tad', 'bit', 'stiff', 'acting', 'couple', 'secondary', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'sway', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'part', 'holiday', 'collection', 'watch', 'other', 'favorites', 'Christmas', 'season', 'also', 'nice', 'local', 'small-town', 'feel', 'filmed', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'MA']",Noelle

Although the weird storyline keeps your interest, it is a very different kind of Christmas movie.  It is sombre and the joy that is present in most holiday flicks is absent from this film.  I can see that my opinion differs from many of the posters here, but I want to caution people who have similar values to me.  I'm not Catholic, but to me it wasn't very respectful of the priesthood & I could see how someone who was Roman Catholic could be very offended by this movie.  I just assumed that because there was romance involved that it was a story about an Anglican priest.  I'm afraid not.  A story about priests with tons of skeletons in the closet just isn't for me at all.  Don't get me wrong, there is a message there, although a loose one that is more about 2nd chances & also that someone should go into ministry for the right reasons.  However, there appear to be no consequences for the inappropriateness of certain characters' behaviour and at the end, for at least one character, it is like the story never happened. The one swear is presented without sound, but hey we can all lipread that!  The acting was very stiff and poor, and the storyline was slow and dragged.  Please give me a more lighthearted film for Christmas time!  Unfortunately this film is rather expensive and really, in my opinion, not worth the money.",2,"Questionable Content, Didn't Enjoy",1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,1473,"['someone', 'who', 'Christian', 'family', 'values', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'found', 'movie', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'bland', 'somewhat', 'offensive', 'weird', 'storyline', 'interest', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'sombre', 'joy', 'present', 'most', 'holiday', 'flicks', 'absent', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'opinion', 'differs', 'many', 'posters', 'here', 'want', 'caution', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'similar', 'values', ""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'respectful', 'priesthood', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'offended', 'movie', 'just', 'assumed', 'was', 'romance', 'involved', 'was', 'story', 'Anglican', 'priest', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'not', 'A', 'story', 'priests', 'tons', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'just', ""n't"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'message', 'there', 'loose', 'one', 'more', '2nd', 'chances', 'also', 'someone', 'should', 'go', 'ministry', 'right', 'reasons', 'However', 'appear', 'be', 'consequences', 'inappropriateness', 'certain', 'characters', 'behaviour', 'end', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'story', 'never', 'happened', 'one', 'swear', 'presented', 'sound', 'can', 'lipread', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'stiff', 'poor', 'storyline', 'was', 'slow', 'dragged', 'Please', 'give', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'film', 'Christmas', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'rather', 'expensive', 'really', 'opinion', 'not', 'money']",Noelle

1181227,A32LHZK66OSRHK,B001DHXT8O,Picky Movie Buff,"[6, 12]","Added Comment 12-27-2009: The Amazon product description lists the format as ""widescreen"". Further down the aspect ratio is shown as 1.33:1, which is full screen format and incorrect. The actual format is WideScreen only. The original pre-release Amazon description only gave the aspect ratio of 1.33:1 which is Full Screen format. That is why I wrote my original comments below. As I said in the original comments the movie itself is excellent. If you like arthouse and independent movies you will most likely enjoy it. I still feel it is an Excellent picture.Original Comment: First the good news. At last this movie is coming out on dvd. The bad news is the powers that be have decided to milk fan anticipation by first releasing it in FULL SCREEN. Considering this release is a FS version it is rather expensive. At some point in the future it will no doubt be re-issued as a WIDE SCREEN version at an even more hefty price markup.The movie itself is quite enjoyable and my star rating is only three because it is not WIDE SCREEN. If it were a WS version I would most likely give it a four or five stars. The movie itself is excellent.So can you wait for the wide screen version or do you give in and get this FULL SCREEN version. Of course when the WS version is finally issued many will get it too and spend double the cost.The producers of Noelle now join the infamous ranks of the producers of Matilda, Kindergarten Cop, etc. who in the finest tradition of marketing will do there very best to sell you two or three copies of the same movie. Some might consider it a form of milking the fatted cow.So can you wait or will you give in to the darkside? If you decide to get it please do check the web for other versions. Do this and you will know the benefits of the astute shopper.I am waiting. I may get this FULL SCREEN version in say six months when the price comes down. But my top dollar is reserved for a proper WIDE SCREEN copy of this excellent movie.",3,Is This All There Is????,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,1966,"['Added', 'Comment', '12-27-2009', 'Amazon', 'product', 'description', 'format', 'widescreen', 'Further', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'shown', '1.33:1', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'incorrect', 'actual', 'format', 'WideScreen', 'only', 'original', 'pre-release', 'Amazon', 'description', 'only', 'gave', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'Full', 'Screen', 'format', 'why', 'wrote', 'original', 'comments', 'below', 'said', 'original', 'comments', 'movie', 'excellent', 'like', 'arthouse', 'independent', 'movies', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'still', 'feel', 'Excellent', 'picture.Original', 'Comment', 'First', 'good', 'news', 'last', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'bad', 'news', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'decided', 'milk', 'fan', 'anticipation', 'first', 'releasing', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'Considering', 'release', 'FS', 'version', 'rather', 'expensive', 'point', 'future', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 're-issued', 'WIDE', 'SCREEN', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'hefty', 'price', 'markup.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'star', 'rating', 'only', 'three', 'not', 'WIDE', 'SCREEN', 'were', 'WS', 'version', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'movie', 'excellent.So', 'can', 'wait', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'do', 'give', 'get', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'version', 'course', 'when', 'WS', 'version', 'finally', 'issued', 'many', 'will', 'get', 'too', 'spend', 'double', 'cost.The', 'producers', 'Noelle', 'now', 'infamous', 'ranks', 'producers', 'Matilda', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'etc', 'who', 'finest', 'tradition', 'marketing', 'will', 'do', 'there', 'very', 'best', 'sell', 'two', 'three', 'copies', 'same', 'movie', 'might', 'consider', 'form', 'milking', 'fatted', 'cow.So', 'can', 'wait', 'will', 'give', 'darkside', 'decide', 'get', 'please', 'do', 'check', 'web', 'other', 'versions', 'Do', 'will', 'know', 'benefits', 'astute', 'shopper.I', 'am', 'waiting', 'may', 'get', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'version', 'say', 'six', 'months', 'when', 'price', 'down', 'top', 'dollar', 'reserved', 'proper', 'WIDE', 'SCREEN', 'copy', 'excellent', 'movie']",Noelle
1181228,AAS7VH7K9XSYZ,B001DHXT8O,"Ronald Steury ""Doc Ron""","[3, 3]","My wife and I have watched this little, unknown but remarkable film three times this Christmas season. Each time it gets better. There is some remarkably deft writing in the script (listen carefully to the banter between the pub owner, Dermott,  and Father Jonathan Keene). Some plot points are not immediately evident on first viewing (why did Father Keene, when preparing communion, suddenly realize he needed to go to Marjorie?) and the humor and appreciation of the excellent musical score grow with each viewing. An adult with a Christian background can appreciate this film on so many levels but even those whose faith may not be so evident should be able to embrace the lessons of love and forgiveness that permeate this film.For this film to be written, directed, and acted out by the (seemingly) entire Wall family is even more remarkable. Surely it was shot on a very tight budget but one would hardly know that considering the cinematography and the musical scoring. My one complaint is the acting of some of the lessor roles which seemed pretty stiff (or was that just being Cape Coders?) and, while I loved Sean Patrick Brennan's Father Joyce, his monotone delivery of many of his lines was distracting. Hence the deduction of one star as it was almost, but not completely, perfect. (Yes, I am a harsh judge.)We have viewed this film with adults and even teens and all are at rapt attention during the showing. We were concerned that it might be too ""talky"" for teens but instead it stimulated a robust discussion of many issues presented. (A fun activity is for each person viewing the film for the first time to indicate when they have finally ""figured out"" who the mesmerizing little girl on the DVD cover represents.) I do feel sadness that this will be seen by so few, apparently due to its limited distribution. Please don't miss the opportunity to view it yourself this holiday or anytime you wish to be charmed and reminded that we can all be forgiven from our past transgressions.",4,Don't Overlook This Christmas Gem,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2002,"['wife', 'have', 'watched', 'little', 'unknown', 'remarkable', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'Christmas', 'season', 'time', 'better', 'remarkably', 'deft', 'writing', 'script', 'listen', 'carefully', 'banter', 'pub', 'owner', 'Dermott', 'Father', 'Jonathan', 'Keene', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'not', 'immediately', 'evident', 'first', 'viewing', 'why', 'did', 'Father', 'Keene', 'when', 'preparing', 'communion', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'needed', 'go', 'Marjorie', 'humor', 'appreciation', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'grow', 'viewing', 'adult', 'Christian', 'background', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'even', 'faith', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'evident', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'embrace', 'lessons', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'permeate', 'film.For', 'film', 'be', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'out', 'seemingly', 'entire', 'Wall', 'family', 'even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'Surely', 'was', 'shot', 'very', 'tight', 'budget', 'one', 'would', 'hardly', 'know', 'considering', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'scoring', 'one', 'complaint', 'acting', 'lessor', 'roles', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'Cape', 'Coders', 'loved', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Brennan', 'Father', 'Joyce', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'many', 'lines', 'was', 'distracting', 'Hence', 'deduction', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'almost', 'not', 'completely', 'perfect', 'Yes', 'am', 'harsh', 'judge', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'adults', 'even', 'teens', 'are', 'rapt', 'attention', 'showing', 'were', 'concerned', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'talky', 'teens', 'instead', 'stimulated', 'robust', 'discussion', 'many', 'issues', 'presented', 'fun', 'activity', 'person', 'viewing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'indicate', 'when', 'have', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'mesmerizing', 'little', 'girl', 'DVD', 'cover', 'do', 'feel', 'sadness', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'so', 'few', 'apparently', 'due', 'limited', 'distribution', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'opportunity', 'view', 'holiday', 'anytime', 'wish', 'be', 'charmed', 'reminded', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'past', 'transgressions']",Noelle
