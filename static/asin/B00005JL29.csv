593956,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JL29,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Summary:Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) is a tough-nosed detective who also happens to have been the intended victim of a botched murder by her first husband.  When two young men, Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) & Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt (II)), who grew up with silver spoons and are both very smart, decide to commit a murder just to see if they can get away with it, Cassie and her new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), are called upon to crack the case.  Richard and Justin have designed the case so it will appear that Richard's drug dealer, Ray (Chris Penn), was the one responsible.  All of the evidence falls perfectly into place, but Cassie just doesn't believe the evidence and pushes after the young men until she is caught up in the seduction that lead to the crime in the first place.My Comments:I'm going to have to admit that the story actually seemed plausible and followed a logical pattern.  Even the twists and turns that I didn't predict made sense in retrospect.  That's a pretty good achievement for an action/psycho thriller.  As for the acting, I actually thought that Sandra Bullock was the weakest character, but that may just be because I didn't find her portrayal of a woman that had been mentally and physically abused by a previous husband to be convincing.  I particularly enjoyed the performances of the two young men, Ryan Gosling & Michael Pitt.  The casting seemed to fit the roles perfectly....  They made it pretty obvious in the gymnasium when the detectives first interviewed Richard that the ring was going to play an important part in the story later on, but the role it ultimately played didn't really matter all that much.  The only other major criticism I have is that the pacing was a bit slow.  It could be that the pacing was slow because they were really trying to push the background story of Cassie dealing with her psychological problems resulting from the abuse of her first husband.  But it wasn't a particularly compelling sub-story and slowed the movie.Overall, the movie could have been better, but was entertaining enough to keep my attention throughout (though I should admit that I was riding an exercise bike for about 40 minutes of the movie).  With the ever-increasing prevalence of youth violence, characters like Richard and Justin probably aren't too far-fetched in modern day America.  It may be a sad statement that I can watch a movie like this and believe that something like it could take place, or perhaps, as Michael Moore might say, that is exactly what the 'Culture of Fear' in the U.S. wants me to believe.  Either way, the movie is an interesting thought exploration.  If you enjoy psycho-thrillers, then you'll want to see this one, but don't expect too much.",3,"OK movie, just a little unconvincing.",1050796800,"04 20, 2003",2003,2746,"['Summary', 'Cassie', 'Mayweather', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'tough-nosed', 'detective', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'victim', 'botched', 'murder', 'first', 'husband', 'When', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Richard', 'Haywood', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Justin', 'Pendleton', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'II', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'silver', 'spoons', 'are', 'very', 'smart', 'decide', 'commit', 'murder', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'Cassie', 'new', 'partner', 'Sam', 'Kennedy', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'are', 'called', 'crack', 'case', 'Richard', 'Justin', 'have', 'designed', 'case', 'will', 'appear', 'Richard', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Ray', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'was', 'one', 'responsible', 'evidence', 'perfectly', 'place', 'Cassie', 'just', ""n't"", 'believe', 'evidence', 'pushes', 'young', 'men', 'caught', 'up', 'seduction', 'lead', 'crime', 'first', 'place.My', 'Comments', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'admit', 'story', 'actually', 'seemed', 'plausible', 'followed', 'logical', 'pattern', 'Even', 'twists', 'did', ""n't"", 'predict', 'made', 'sense', 'retrospect', 'pretty', 'good', 'achievement', 'action/psycho', 'thriller', 'acting', 'actually', 'thought', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'weakest', 'character', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'had', 'been', 'mentally', 'physically', 'abused', 'previous', 'husband', 'be', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'casting', 'seemed', 'fit', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'made', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'gymnasium', 'when', 'detectives', 'first', 'interviewed', 'Richard', 'ring', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'later', 'role', 'ultimately', 'played', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'criticism', 'have', 'pacing', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'could', 'be', 'pacing', 'was', 'slow', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'push', 'background', 'story', 'Cassie', 'dealing', 'psychological', 'problems', 'resulting', 'abuse', 'first', 'husband', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'compelling', 'sub-story', 'slowed', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'should', 'admit', 'was', 'riding', 'exercise', 'bike', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'ever-increasing', 'prevalence', 'youth', 'violence', 'characters', 'Richard', 'Justin', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'far-fetched', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'may', 'be', 'sad', 'statement', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'believe', 'something', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'perhaps', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'might', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', ""'Culture"", 'Fear', 'U.S.', 'believe', 'way', 'movie', 'interesting', 'thought', 'exploration', 'enjoy', 'psycho-thrillers', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much']",Murder by Numbers

I wasn't expecting much from this movie before I watched it, the previews for it made this movie seem drab and less than thrilling but I was pleasantly surprised how actually good this movie is. First of all, Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in, you could tell Gosling was on his way to bigger and better things. He is amazing as the creepy and high-school bored Richard. Bullock pulls off another solid preformance, I have been a huge fan of Bullock since While You Were Sleeping, she has great charisma in every movie she appears in.

593958,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JL29,Alex Udvary,"[0, 1]","Barbet Schroeder's ""Murder By Numbers"" a movie which I assume is trying to update the Leopold and Loeb murders does have it's moments. It does try to create something original. And, who knows, if I had not seen the Alfred Hitchcock film ""Rope"", years ago, would I have enjoyed this movie? Probably not.Sandra Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather. A once married woman, whom after a bad marriaged, which landed her husband in jail, has since become a cop. And know must track down what police believe to be a serial killer, who, for the moment seems to have  committed the perfect crime. It was this part of the film I enjoyed. But, the writer of the film had something else up his sleeve. A very bad sub-plot concerning Bullock and her husband. I won't give it all away, but, it explains how bad the marriage was, why Bullock became a cop, and, why her husband has went to jail and the reason for her not going to testify against him. But this sub-plot sometimes takes away time from the, what I felt was the MAIN story-line to the film. The murder committed by these two young boys; Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). Seeing the way these two guys think and their actions was far more interesting to me then seeing Sandra Bullock over coming some old demmons in her closet. Could the sub-plot of work with a film like this? Maybe, but it would have to be handled in a much better way. There have been movies about cops who have old secrets in the closet and go on with a murder case. This year's ""Insomnia"" is a film that comes to mind. But in this film, the sub-plot concerning Bullock just throws the film off focus. The two stories do not coincide with each other. And because of that the film does not have the impact the director thought it would.But still the film does have it's moments. This my pick for Bullock's best acting performance since, well, it's her best performance. There seemed to be something there between Ben Chaplin, who plays a rookie cop helping Bullock on the case, and Bullock. Gosling and Pitt did a nice job with their roles as well. And some parts did add a nice level of suspense. But, everything this film does has been handled much better in the past. Watch Hitchcock's ""Rope"" and see. The film is worth looking at if your a Bullock fan, but, by looking at the numbers this film grossed, I wouldn't say there are many. The film fell short of 20 million dollars to make any profit. ** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Although Bullock gives a very good perforamnce and the film does have some originality to it, it's sub-plot takes the film off track.

They appear to be at first very borderline and intriguing.  But the producer's put so little development into their characters we don't see very much of that internal motication.  We are presented with this codependant relationship that the killers have yet we are never told why they need each other or why this dependancy exists.  The police officer Sandra Bullock has many demons of her own and what made her go into police work.  I think the movie may have tried to take on too many plots and it ended up not developing either one of them very well.  The acting is good but the storyline falls behind.  I think the movie should have concentrated more on the killers and backed off the cop character.  I think this is a case where the movie casted too big an actor(Bullock) for a part that shouldn't have played as big a part in the movie.

593962,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JL29,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I am a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, but truth be told I enjoy my Bullock in those stellar romantic comedies she made her own.  That isn't to say that I can't rally behind `Sandra Bullock-Serious Actress' but I have my preferences and they are mine to have.  That said, I enjoyed `Murder by Numbers' for what it was, but it never became something overly memorable for me.  Sandra does a decent enough job of getting inside her character, but her niche definitely lays within the romantic comedy and so there are times when this performance seems a tad forced.  This isn't to say that Sandra can't pull off dramatic; just watch her performance in `Crash' and you'll see that she has the chops to pull off a well written character, but `Murder by Numbers' doesn't offer her anything more than a walking clich&eacute; to embody.The film focuses on a disturbing murder of a young woman and the detective who tracks down the two boys who committed the crime.  Sandra plays that said detective; Cassie Mayweather.  Cassie has her own issues (when I mentioned clich&eacute;s I was talking about her back-story; very been there done that) and these issues make this case all the more pertinent to her.  The two boys who committed this crime; Richard and Justin; have a fun time stringing the detectives along with planted clues to lead them down the wrong path, all the while laughing in the face of destiny.Sadly, these two young killers are also nothing more than a collective sum of movie villain clich&eacute;s.  Richard is the sarcastic and witty popular kid who bosses Justin around with confidence and a false sense of loyalty while Justin is the stark opposite; shy and introverted and obviously harboring some sort of attraction towards Richard, most likely due to Richard's apparent dominance.A major highlight to the film, and something that helps elevate it to `worth checking out' territory, is Ryan Gosling's dynamic performance.  Gosling has grown into one of our finest young actors as of late, and his performance here is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his abilities.  What he does with Richard is phenomenal, taking an overly clich&eacute;d and familiar character and infusing so much originality and style that he becomes a character belonging only to Gosling.  Sure, this same type of character has been attempted plenty of times before, but rarely this well.As far as the remaining performances are concerned, they pale in comparison.  Bullock does turn in some nice moments but this is far from her comfort zone and it shows.  I commend her for branching out a bit but this is not her usual greatness.  Ben Chaplin is really here to fill space and add to Mayweather's personal life.  He is decent but forgettable.  Michael Pitt, an actor who I can take or leave (I thought he was decent in `The Dreamers' but nothing special), is really pitiful here.  He falls into his characters clich&eacute;s full throttle and doesn't seem able to rise above them.  He seems to play to his odd appearance too much, relying on his `little boy face' too much in order to relay his characters feelings.  It doesn't work so well for him.  When he attempts `brooding' it looks more like a young child who is pouting.In the end I can say that `Murder by Numbers' is a decent thriller.  What helps is the fact that the plot is interesting and the script is in parts very smart.  It's a nice play on the `cat and mouse' type crime genre and, as I mentioned, Gosling really does make the most of what he's given.  It's not perfect and it may never warrant repeat viewings but if you haven't seen it then you won't be wasting any time if you do.  It is satisfying in what it's here for.  It's just a shame the characters are a little too `paint by numbers'.I couldn't resist.",3,"It's a little `paint by numbers', but Gosling's performance makes it worth your time...",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,3778,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'enjoy', 'Bullock', 'stellar', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'made', 'own', ""n't"", 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rally', 'Sandra', 'Bullock-Serious', 'Actress', 'have', 'preferences', 'are', 'mine', 'have', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'what', 'was', 'never', 'became', 'something', 'overly', 'memorable', 'Sandra', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'getting', 'character', 'niche', 'definitely', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'performance', 'tad', 'forced', ""n't"", 'say', 'Sandra', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'dramatic', 'just', 'watch', 'performance', 'Crash', ""'ll"", 'see', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'written', 'character', 'Murder', 'Numbers', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'more', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'embody.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'disturbing', 'murder', 'young', 'woman', 'detective', 'who', 'down', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'Sandra', 'said', 'detective', 'Cassie', 'Mayweather', 'Cassie', 'own', 'issues', 'when', 'mentioned', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'talking', 'back-story', 'very', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'issues', 'make', 'case', 'more', 'pertinent', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'Richard', 'Justin', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'stringing', 'detectives', 'planted', 'clues', 'lead', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'while', 'laughing', 'face', 'destiny.Sadly', 'two', 'young', 'killers', 'are', 'also', 'nothing', 'more', 'collective', 'sum', 'movie', 'villain', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Richard', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'popular', 'kid', 'who', 'Justin', 'confidence', 'false', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'Justin', 'stark', 'opposite', 'introverted', 'obviously', 'harboring', 'sort', 'attraction', 'towards', 'Richard', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'Richard', 'apparent', 'dominance.A', 'major', 'highlight', 'film', 'something', 'elevate', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'territory', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'Gosling', 'grown', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'actors', 'late', 'performance', 'here', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'when', 'abilities', 'What', 'Richard', 'phenomenal', 'taking', 'overly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'familiar', 'character', 'infusing', 'so', 'much', 'originality', 'style', 'character', 'belonging', 'only', 'Gosling', 'Sure', 'same', 'type', 'character', 'been', 'attempted', 'plenty', 'times', 'rarely', 'well.As', 'far', 'remaining', 'performances', 'are', 'concerned', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Bullock', 'turn', 'nice', 'moments', 'far', 'comfort', 'zone', 'commend', 'branching', 'out', 'bit', 'not', 'usual', 'greatness', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'really', 'here', 'fill', 'space', 'add', 'Mayweather', 'personal', 'life', 'decent', 'forgettable', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'Dreamers', 'nothing', 'special', 'really', 'pitiful', 'here', 'characters', 'clich', 'eacute', 'full', 'throttle', ""n't"", 'seem', 'able', 'rise', 'play', 'odd', 'appearance', 'too', 'much', 'relying', 'little', 'boy', 'face', 'too', 'much', 'order', 'relay', 'characters', 'feelings', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'When', 'brooding', 'more', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'pouting.In', 'end', 'can', 'say', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'decent', 'thriller', 'What', 'fact', 'plot', 'interesting', 'script', 'parts', 'very', 'smart', 'nice', 'play', 'cat', 'mouse', 'type', 'crime', 'genre', 'mentioned', 'Gosling', 'really', 'make', 'most', 'what', 'given', 'not', 'perfect', 'may', 'never', 'warrant', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'do', 'satisfying', 'what', 'here', 'just', 'shame', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'paint', ""numbers'.I"", 'could', ""n't"", 'resist']",Murder by Numbers

Playing the characters of Richard and Justin, two troubled teens of opposite social circles, the psychopathic duo philosophize the justification of a short but effective serial killer career.  Sandra Bullock as the investigating detective almost takes a backseat to the dynamics of Gosling and Pitt who attempt to counter forensic techniques with shrewd and evil methods.Watching the characters of the suave and arrogant Richard together with the introverted yet brilliant Justin scheming against investigating authorities makes the film all worthwhile.  One almost wants to see how far the pair can proceed with their evil doings in this combat of minds against the police.  But just like  any true serial killer's ""M.O"", we want them to be caught, and here is where the themes collide to make the story interesting.Sandra Bullock's character is also one of interest, as she plays a former victim-turned-detective with a masochistic preference for relationships.  Ben Chaplin gives some balance as her partner, in more than one way, but again it's high schoolers Richard and Justin who make the film move.

The scene where each of the cops takes one of the two suspects into a room and then tells them stories about what the other suspect is saying is a classic demonstration of the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" problem. It is a problem where both suspects benefit if neither cooperates yet for each their best option is to betray the other, for neither can really trust the other.Two sociopathic, rich and bored high school students, one good looking and popular and the other brilliant and reserved, get together and develop a plan to make their lives more interesting. By carefully researching crime scene investigative tactics and meticulously establishing false clues, they randomly capture and murder a woman in an attempt to commit the perfect crime.Sandra Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a brilliant but mixed up homicide detective. At first, the clues all lead to a janitor at the high school, but Cassie's intuition tells her that it is not that simple. Over the objections of her superiors, she continues to investigate the murder and she uncovers some significant clues regarding the boys' guilt.Cassie appears incapable of expressing any emotional attachments; she seduces her male partner, yet all but boots him out of her bed afterward.  Later, she tries to do so again but it is clear to the partner that she is simply using him; he makes it clear that he wants no part of her body.In addition to the game theory reference, the behavior of the boys is reminiscent of the classic ""Crime and Punishment"" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The theories that the boys use to justify the torture and murder of  a woman that they do not know and frame an innocent man are disturbing and given some of the events on high school and college campuses, perhaps all too common.The performances of the main characters are excellent, especially Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as the two very disturbed, yet rational and extremely intelligent teenagers. You feel sorry for them while being revolted by their actions.

I really feel she has more to offer, and this showed a depth of emotion that most of her films over the last 5 years don't show.  So...one of those stars is specifically for that.  In fact, all of the acting was well done.The movie itself...really only deserves 3.  As with the other reviews, I'll reiterate.  2 High School (we assume 18 yo) Seniors commit a murder, for the sake of proving they can create a forensically misleading case for the police who come to investigate the crime.  Those two lucky homicide investigators are Cassy/Sandra Bullock (with her dark victim-paralleled skeletons), and Sam/Ben Chaplin (a veteran cop, but Cassy's new partner).  And, while Sam follows the 'planted' crime scene leads to a textbook perpetrator...Cassy's personal obsessions cause her to be skeptical and objective toward other possibilities.There were two main problems with this movie.  First...the continuity was confusing.  You are faced with the reality of Cassy's demons WAY too late in the movie.  Subsequently, you spend just enough time in her dream sequences to be frustrated at ""just what the heck am I supposed to be getting out of this?""The other problem, essentially, was the end of the movie.  Where we find out some disappointing truths, and watch a [painfully] predictably bad ending.I will admit that the special effects on the ending, and throughout the movie really, were well done.  Details like activity outside of windows in apartment scenes, etc. were all done rather well.One final note...is that there was this recurring homosexual overtone in the movie.  It was never developed, only implied...and then ambiguously ignored when creating dissention between the 2 antoganists.

It just plugged along at an excrutiatingly slow pace. Sandra Bullock delivers a pretty good performance of a woman trying to face the demons of her past and coming to grips with that past. That was the best storyline of the movie. The rest of it was pretty unmoving. To me, I enjoy a thriller more when the killers remain obscure to the end. It's just more suspense in not knowing. This movie did have suspense in keeping us in the dark about who really committed the murder. However, watching detectives follow constantly-plotting high schoolers around was just downright boring at times. Also, I felt that the rich kid might have been gay.

The film follows Cassie (Bullock) and her new partner Sam (Chaplin) as they investigate the murder of a middle aged woman whose body was left in a ditch.  Their investigation brings them to two high school teens, popular Richard (Gosling) whom Cassie dislikes right off bat, and outcast Justin (Michael Pitt) who doesn't seem to be the killing kind.  These two boys cleverly mask over their murder, leaving clues to incriminate others and covering their tracks so well it's almost impossible to prove they had anything to do with it, but Cassie knows, and she'll find a way to prove it.  As I said, it's not perfect, but Gosling, who is by far one of our finest working actors, brings so much reality to his performance that the film is elevated higher than it would have been without him and makes this a worthwhile watch.",4,Better because of Gosling!,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,956,"['Murder', 'Numbers', 'far', 'perfect', 'thanks', 'yet', 'electric', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'also', 'far', 'horrible', 'film', 'Cassie', 'Bullock', 'new', 'partner', 'Sam', 'Chaplin', 'investigate', 'murder', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'body', 'was', 'left', 'ditch', 'investigation', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'teens', 'popular', 'Richard', 'Gosling', 'whom', 'Cassie', 'dislikes', 'right', 'bat', 'outcast', 'Justin', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'killing', 'kind', 'two', 'boys', 'cleverly', 'mask', 'over', 'murder', 'leaving', 'clues', 'incriminate', 'others', 'covering', 'tracks', 'so', 'well', 'almost', 'impossible', 'prove', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'Cassie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'way', 'prove', 'said', 'not', 'perfect', 'Gosling', 'who', 'far', 'one', 'finest', 'working', 'actors', 'so', 'much', 'reality', 'performance', 'film', 'elevated', 'higher', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",Murder by Numbers

The murderers are intelligent and bored high school students and their characters never really evolve past this reality.

She is cynical as well as spiteful - and subjects men to humiliation. Her latest muse is her rookie partner Ben Chaplin in a thankless role.Murder by Numbers is essentially Bullock's star vehicle to feature her as a serious actress. She is tough and spare but when her trauma becomes too overwrought and grossly indulged, it butchers the movie to become a melodrama. Director Barbet Schroeder is at his best when deftly constructing the thriller part - closing in on a perfect murder scheme masterminded by a pair of high-school seniors. Cassie engages into a cat-and-mouse game to examine their strangled victim dumped in a river, ward off their deliberately set-up ruse and fence off their advances. The killing seems random but Cassie suspects it to be planned.Inspired by the 1924 case of Leopold and Loeb which is the source of Hitchcock's Rope, Murder by Numbers is a why-dun-it hence the suspense is left to the grisly atmosphere imbued by Schroeder. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt pitch their acting skills to a visceral mode, charging their performance with homo-erotic tension. Gosling is the arrogant Congressman's son with scornful virulence; Pitt is the reclusive nerd who is overshadowed by the cool kid Gosling. The boys' Nietzchean dance of death is eerie and morbid - and Schroeder of Reversal of Fortune paints the deranged with darkness.Murder by Numbers is thus a promising thriller only let down by the unfocused story-line when it wanders to Cassie's abused past.

593982,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JL29,D. Litton,"[10, 15]","""Murder by Numbers"" belongs in that special category of thrillers in which the characters take precedence over the actual plot itself. The story line follows certain rules while breaking others, but in the end, it is the deep examinations of the people who populate the scenario that wins our utmost attention.The film reminds me immensely of the early 1900's murder trial of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, two bright, astute boys who, for no clear reason, decided to murder a young boy in cold blood. Here, the action centers around an event that is very much the same in its calculation and detached feel. We are introduced to high school teenagers Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling), the rich and cocky aristocrat, and Justin (Michael Pitt), the loner who spends his time diffusing the workings of the law, from forensics to detective skills.No sooner do we find out that these two completely opposite people are friends, than we learn that they have been planning a murder during the course of their friendship. We sense a feeling of hesitation eminating from Justin, as Richard placates him about his constant need for planning without any payoff. From such a scene, we are to gather that Justin is the brains while his partner is the brawn.But it goes much deeper than first expected. There is a murder, that which we do not see, but discover as a crime scene is examined. There are various clues that, we gather, were left behind intentionally, from a strand of human hair to a carpet fabric from an unknown source. Later, we find that this ties in with their master plan of alluding the authorities to other sources and suspects.Once things pick up after hard-hitting detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) takes on the case and begins questioning the two troubled youths, the film stops at various points to examine small glimpses of the two boys interacting with one another. Each boy feels he is being masterminded by the other, though it certainly appears as if Richard is having more of the fun. There are even hints at a possible homosexual relationship between the two: in one particular scene, after Justin becomes involved with a female classmate, Richard confronts him. Is he anxious about whether or not his partner in crime revealed any possible information, or is there a slight jealousy in his furor?It's these examinations and poignant moments of feeling that make ""Murder by Numbers"" better than it would have been had it followed the regular cat-and-mouse formula for the genre. The plot itself does tend to sway into predictability, and even the film's opening sequence sets us up for later events to come, but director Barbet Schroeder manages to keep things moving at a fluid pace, introducing new evidence for Cassie to divulge, despite her insistant boss, who believes she is overdoing her work, and her partner, Sam (Ben Chaplin), who feels she holds a grudge after he cracks the case. Or so he thinks.But Cassie refuses to let go of her belief in the two boys' guilt. Under Sandra Bullock's convincing performance, she makes an otherwise routine subplot involving a past trauma that ties her emotions to present events believable. Chaplin's character isn't given much to do during the film except provide emotional support for Bullock; on that, he succeeds admirably.It is Gosling and Pitt who steal the show, however, bringing us into the complex, morbidly intriguing nature of their friendship so that we have a somewhat faded picture of their psyche. I like that fact that some elements of their friendship are left to suggestion through friendly gestures and embraces; it incites us to think about what motivates them. Does Justin do it to satisfy Ryan's lust for action? Why do these two souls choose to interact, even as their crime tears them apart emotionally?

This hollowness is due in part to being spoiled (Gosling's character is rich and used to getting what he wants) as well as having no goals to aspire to.  Since they've become numb to their feelings and lack purpose in life, planning and committing murder is their way of feeling alive again and giving their lives some purpose.Sandra Bullock plays the detective investigating the murder they commit.  She's tough talking like the all-male squad she works with, except she also has strong defense mechanisms that prevent her from bonding with any of them.  One of those defense mechanisms include having sex with these guys and then coldly tossing them aside afterwards.  Flashbacks into her past, though, reveal why she erected these defense mechanisms in the first place.I found it fitting for her to live in a houseboat because the houseboat represents her life...detached from others and unsteady.The acting in this movie is good, but not excellent.  Although Bullock is mostly convincing in her role, there were times when it appeared like she was trying not to laugh (in a seriuos scene), so I found that distracting.  Ben Chaplin, who plays her partner, gave a good performance, especially in how hurt he looks when she rejects him.  And I thought Pitt and Gosling gave good performances as well.  I especially liked their decision to play these characters as possibly homosexual.The story is interesting, but what bothered me about the story was the inconsistency of the shy guy's character.  It was unclear to me if this guy had a conscience and was just manipulated by a smooth talker...of if he was a sociopath without a conscience.

593988,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JL29,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 4]","This is an interesting detective flick that could have been much better.  The story is a contemporary twist on the standard crime drama where the diabolical murderers try to outsmart the wily detective.  The contemporary twist is that the murderers are two high school students who are brilliant but bored so they decide to plan the perfect murder and play a cat and mouse game with the police.Therein lies the flaw.  It is plausible that high school students could go on a killing spree because they are angry, frustrated or alienated (we have unfortunately seen too much of this phenomenon), but boredom doesn't produce this level of calculated evil.  Also, when teens like this snap, the result is messy, not cold and calculated at depicted here.Director Barbet Schroeder (Single White Female) presents these kids as normal high school students who simply decided that their brand of mischief would be murder.  It might have been more believable if they showed some sociopathic tendencies, but other than the murder, they seem like regular kids.  The union of two kids who are so different, the intropsective loner Justin (Michael Pitt) and the popular rich kid Richard (Ryan Gosling), also fails to resonate.  They supposedly met when Justin was tutoring Richard, which is utterly implausible given the fact that Richard is portrayed as being extremely bright himself.  Also, these types of kids generally have a natural disdain for one another in real life.The script also bogs down with unnecessary plot elements like Cassie's (Sandra Bullock) mysterious past and a relationship with her partner.  This is an attempt to develop Cassie in a way that has little bearing on the main storyline, and the subplot klunks annoyingly away like a square wheel.The gathering of forensic evidence and the deductive reasoning that follows is fascinating along with the boys manipulation of the evidence to point the detectives in the wrong direction.  Cassie's intuitive approach to the evidence is also well scripted.The acting by the boys is well done, with both creating believable characters.  Pitt is moody, sensitive and introspective and renders a tortured character that tries to appear far more confident than he really is.  Gosling gives Richard a cocky bravado that reminded me of James Caan.  He creates a character that is manipulative and cunning.Sandra Bullock is a terrific actress, but she seems out of place in this role.  Part of the problem is that her character is given too much excess baggage with which to to deal.  She plays Cassie far too tentatively considering this is a female characters that other cops call &quot;the hyena&quot;.  She seems intimidated by confrontations.  She is completely dominated in the confrontation with the teenage Richard, but she is also weak in scenes with her boss and her partner.  She is much better in the subplot regarding her anguish over her past and the uneasy relationship she has with her partner.  Unfortunately, this is the most irrelevant component of the script.This film has some interesting elements, but the pieces fail to come together.  Bullock's middling performance along with an unbelievable story reduce this film to mediocrity.

Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt play manipulator and victim, respectively.  Gosling is so good in this movie, you are disturbed yet awed by the fact that an innocent-looking guy like Gosling can entice, humiliate, and commit someone to murder.  This movie is so psychological; there are many different nuances that are so fun to pick out.  You can be repulsed by what the boys have done, and by the scenes that show their violence, but you can't help getting drawn into their world and feeling sorry for at least Michael Pitt's character when they face the consequences of their actions.As for Sandra Bullock's portrayl of emotionally damaged Cassie Mayweather - I thought she did an excellent job.  Sandra is America's Sweetheart, and yet she plays Cassie so perfectly - with her subtle humor and aggressive personality.  One of the reasons the movie is so well done is because it can at once make you chuckle, cringe, gasp, or cheer, and make you feel a thousand other emotions you won't be able to put your finger on.  The people who gave this movie bad reviews did not look into the movie deep enough, and could not appreciate the psychological elements that give the movie its power.

593998,A1WIZ78S4T2AP2,B00005JL29,J.D.,"[9, 12]","Before the summer of 2002, many thrillers were released promising thrills and chills. Such titles as ""Panic Room"" and ""Frailty"" talked the talk and walked the walk, but Barbet Schroeder's ""Murder by Numbers"" will fail to scare you at all.Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin are local detectives trying to figure out a case in which a dead woman's body shows up out of nowhere in the middle of the forest. ""Murder by Numbers"" - as quickly as it intrigues you - drops you off for a marathon. We learn that the murder has been done by two high school students; Richard (Bryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Richard is the rich, cool kid that seems to be the murderer while Justin is the goth punk who is the brains behind the murder...or so we think. This is where Bullock and Chaplin comes in. Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, called the ""Hyena"" (for her strong will and manly attitde) and Ben Chaplin plays the green Sam Kennedy, Mayweather's latest partner in a string of partners. Apparently Mayweather goes through partners like water.As the movie progresses (slowly) we learn more and more about the dynamic child killer duo and more especially Mayweather (Bullock). She is more of a manly character, as she seduces and then pulls away Kennedy (Chaplin). ""Murder By Numbers"" then loses its pull by long, strained flashbacks and plans. Somewhere, Mayweather and Kennedy come in, and things start to develop.""Murder By Numbers"" is nowhere near the caliber of thrillers of 2002. While Bullock pulls her load, Chaplin blandly wavers through the film. The suprise performance is that of Gosling, who weasels and sweet-talks his way throughout the entire movie until he meets his fate. His counterpart, Pitt, looks like someone who wore too much gel on the set and constantly sweats -not a good thing. Schroeder, acclaimed international producer, does not perform well at all here behind the camera. His shots are simple and look more like something out of ""Law and Order"". The editing job is poor as well. For example, in one shot, Justin walks in a hallway when it is light outside, and as he walks into his room, it is dark.""Murder By Numbers"" is saved only by Bullock's performance as she comes to bear on who she really is. The film itself is slow and lags through the majority of the feature.",2,Not a Thriller,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,2295,"['summer', '2002', 'many', 'thrillers', 'were', 'released', 'promising', 'thrills', 'chills', 'Such', 'titles', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Frailty', 'talked', 'talk', 'walked', 'walk', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'will', 'fail', 'scare', 'all.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'are', 'local', 'detectives', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'case', 'dead', 'woman', 'body', 'up', 'nowhere', 'middle', 'forest', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'as', 'quickly', 'drops', 'off', 'marathon', 'learn', 'murder', 'been', 'done', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Richard', 'Bryan', 'Gosling', 'Justin', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Richard', 'rich', 'cool', 'kid', 'be', 'murderer', 'Justin', 'goth', 'punk', 'who', 'brains', 'murder', 'think', 'where', 'Bullock', 'Chaplin', 'Bullock', 'Cassie', 'Mayweather', 'called', 'Hyena', 'strong', 'will', 'manly', 'attitde', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'green', 'Sam', 'Kennedy', 'Mayweather', 'latest', 'partner', 'string', 'partners', 'Apparently', 'Mayweather', 'partners', 'water.As', 'movie', 'slowly', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'dynamic', 'child', 'killer', 'duo', 'more', 'especially', 'Mayweather', 'Bullock', 'more', 'manly', 'character', 'then', 'away', 'Kennedy', 'Chaplin', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'then', 'pull', 'long', 'strained', 'flashbacks', 'plans', 'Somewhere', 'Mayweather', 'Kennedy', 'come', 'things', 'start', 'develop', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'nowhere', 'caliber', 'thrillers', '2002', 'Bullock', 'load', 'Chaplin', 'blandly', 'film', 'suprise', 'performance', 'Gosling', 'who', 'weasels', 'sweet-talks', 'way', 'entire', 'movie', 'fate', 'counterpart', 'Pitt', 'someone', 'who', 'wore', 'too', 'much', 'gel', 'set', 'constantly', 'sweats', '-not', 'good', 'thing', 'Schroeder', 'acclaimed', 'international', 'producer', 'not', 'perform', 'well', 'here', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'simple', 'look', 'more', 'something', 'Law', 'Order', 'editing', 'job', 'poor', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'one', 'shot', 'Justin', 'hallway', 'when', 'light', 'outside', 'room', 'dark', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'saved', 'only', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'bear', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'slow', 'majority', 'feature']",Murder by Numbers

She hands in a commanding performance as Cassie Mayweather, a homicide investigator who is looking into the murder of a young woman. The character is strong, with a few expections. There is too much backstory involved, and by the time it all comes together you'll wonder why it took so long for them to develop this part of the story. We spend most of the movie watching her, wondering what her past is, and it's very anti-climatic when she finally spills the beans on her past. Her partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin) is also a very bland character, however he shines in a few scenes especially during the interrogation near the end of the movie. Ryan Gosling plays Richard, the rich kid who is ""free"" and Michael Pitt plays Justin, the smart kid who is not ""free"" but longs to be. The plot however is well written, and well paced so viewers can piece together what's happening without fault. Just when you think there are no more twists and turns, it goes to show you wrong once again when you least expect it.

That's the lesson of MURDER BY NUMBERS.Homicide Detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) is investigating the murder of a young woman whose body was found in the woods replete with tantalizing clues: yellow carpet fibers, the hair of a baboon, and a dollop of vomit. And then there's the victim's one finger that's missing - severed, apparently. Almost from the first, the audience knows that the perps are Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt), two creepy, clever, and bored teenaged boys (See? What did I tell ya!) with way too much time on their hands and too little parental oversight. Most males their age, with hormones sloshing over, just want to score with the babes. These two would rather commit the perfect murder because ... Well, just because, that's all.To me, MURDER BY NUMBERS has the tempo and feel of a made-for-TV movie. Perhaps it's too contrived. (Ok, ok. Most big screen thriller plots ARE contrived. But this one suggests some rookie screenwriter tried too hard.) Richard and Justin are obviously two sick puppies, and that's cool. But then we have Cassie. Sandra Bullock usually plays a character that a fella would love to take to the prom and then home to visit Mom for milk and warm cookies. Maybe you'd still like to take Cassie home, but Mom had better be a head doctor. Mayweather is hauling some heavy psychological baggage - something to do with the scars just peeking over the top of her top.  Cassie has been seeing the police shrink, and it was hard for me to imagine any law enforcement agency entrusting such a maimed personality with a gun and handcuffs. Moreover, her new partner, Det. Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin) is so bland as to be just short of invisible as an interesting character. And I was never convinced that Richard and Justin posed any sort of threat to Cassie personally, so tension was lacking. Yawn.I'm giving MURDER BY NUMBERS three stars solely for the reason that I think SB is generally hot, and my eyeballs are still seared with the image of her character prancing out of her make-over session in MISS CONGENIALITY.

It wasn't an especially excellent movie, but I was impressed by an actress then not previously too familiar to me, Sandra Bullock. She seemed like a sweet and disarming actress with a proverbial ""girl-next-door"" image. Wow, how things change. Her more recent films have increasingly turned into vanity projects of the like of TWO IF BY SEA, FORCES OF NATURE, 28 DAYS, MISS CONGENIALITY and now MURDER BY NUMBERS. This latter one is supposed to be a murder mystery, but that element really gets mostly smothered by the film's being a heavy handed angst-trip for Bullock's character. We're supposed to cheer her on as a shrewd detective, despite some erratic behavior that includes what would be called serious heavy-handed sexual harrassment of her partner if the genders were reversed. In any event, she's portrayed as the only one who knows what's going on, stuck in a workplace full of stereotypical dumb males, all clueless to what's happening right under their proverbial noses.

J Nary,"[1, 3]","When I say controversial director I mean a director with a unique and creative flair for developing subject matter to be seen in a new and exciting way. Sometimes the material he works with can be sobering but different in its style and process. This movie is definately a hollywood style movie but because of the direction by this interesting director it becomes more than. I liked the interaction between the characters. The movie took on more depth because the director caught the realness of the characters. I am not sure how to express this but I could identify with the characters. The two young actors who are trying to find amusement because life has become to boring and staid and needs some livening up want to commit a perfect murder, outwitting the police. I think the boredom that places the subject of murder into motion between the two teens brings excitement in their lives, excitement also be channeled into sexual energy or vice versa. The boys seemed to be drawn to each other in a sexual way. The energy between them feels sexual and really stimulates the viewer. This is what I mean about realness. The fact that two boys are drawn to one another usually doesn't catch me but in this movie it did! Also Bullock's character has a way of sparking up an overdone profile. The character she is portraying is an abused woman not dealing with her abuse and channeling her rage into work as a police woman and possible alcoholic. You know Bullock has took on roles that have to do with recovery, remember 28 days. I think she uses her talent to gain positive growth, maybe, maybe not. All this is, is a thought. Anyways, there are some cliches, the falling off the cliff, the ending where everything has to be spelled out, I hate that. I am sure some like. It bothers me when a point has to be driven, I like a more subtle approach. Again, Bullock has a way of delivering her lines that refreshes me and adds to the realness of the movie. I also like the fact they used some new faces or faces that have been out there but not used in many big hollywood takes, such as Michael Pitt and Ben Chaplin. The other actor that plays the part of the manipulative teen, not Justin, I thought also did a good job. His coolness stayed pretty constant and when he did break down, you could see the coolness struggling to keep composure. He was able to pull this off, which wins my praise. Someone said all he could do was raise his eyebrows and show an attitude, but I differ in that opinion. Anyways, Bullock still has a nice girl quality but the way she puts out her lines draw you and convince you her character is real. Chaplin's character is trying to remain detached, trying to be professional but slowly his character begins to melt. I wish he had more to his role but he did a good job with what he had. Well, I liked this movie and recommend it. It is not super unique but it has its moments, and the actors do a good job catching you up in the story.

His best film though, is still ""Reversal of Fortune,"" which falls in between the cracks of his filmography yet still manages to be his most cogent, satiric and intelligent film to date.""Murder by the Numbers"" stars Sandra Bullock as the hard as nails and sexually voracious Cassie Mayweather, a homicide detective with an edgy past, assigned to solve a muder case that might involve two high school students: the sinister and edgy Ryan Gosling (late of ""The Believer"") and the sensitive and smarmy Michael Pitt (late of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch).In fact, even though both Bullock and Ben Chaplin acquit themselves well in their roles, it is Gosling and Pitt that literally steal the show. Gosling and Pitt's scenes together bristle with sexual energy bordering on the homoerotic and their connection is palpable due to the very extraordinary nature of their relationship which I can only describe as one very much like that of Arthur Penn's version of Bonnie and Clyde with all the psychological tics in place; which is not to say that Bullock does not have her own demons to work through...because she does. It's just that the boy's demons are a hell of a lot more interesting.Schroeder holds the whole enterprise together as well as he can but he obviously has more of an affinity to and interest in the Gosling/Pitt relationship than he does to the Bullock/Chaplin one.

594021,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JL29,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[8, 11]","Murder by Numbers is a neat concept. What if people who know all about murders decide to commit a murder? Pretty cool, huh?And what if they were high school students?Alright, that seems strange. It actually makes it creepier -- the high school students are definitely Columbine types, the kind who have somehow strayed so far from society (and yet right under our noses) that they are no longer capable of empathy. In the case of Murder by Numbers, the two main characters -- in a relationship with mildly homosexual undertones -- decide to prove they are truly free by intentionally committing murder.It sounds better in the movie than in print.The woman assigned to this case is Cassie Mayweather, played by Sandra Bullock. Let me state my bias up front: I really like Sandra Bullock. Her button-nosed cuteness allows me to forgive her when she makes crappy movies like Miss Congeniality. She had me at The Net.But you've got to be realistic even about the actors you like. And Sandra's just out of her league here.Like Jet Li in The One, this is a complex plot that requires a range of acting abilities that Sandra simply doesn't possess. She's supposed to be a woman with a dark past, a near-death murder victim, a survivor of physical abuse, a licentious woman who sleeps with her partners at a whim. This is not Sandra. And usually, Sandra plays movies around her own carefully cultivated movie personality.In short, this movie requires actual acting.She can't do it. Not for lack of trying. But Sandra comes off as cutesy flirtatious when she's supposed to be a maneater. She comes off as an agitated socialite with a headache rather than a down and dirty cop who was nearly stabbed to death. She's much more victim than survivor.And of course, what Sandra does best is play the victim. She survives, but she's not a SURVIVOR.The ending has a twist. It's not a great twist. The movie is creepy, but not fast enough to pull it off. The actors who play the high school students are disturbing, but they are not so competent to make it genuinely horrifying.Slow. Plodding. Not genuinely real enough characters to make us worry about them or believe their plight.

The whole thing is pretty much blown by the ""cop side"" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film.

594033,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JL29,Reviewer,"[7, 11]","An individual with a disturbed mind and a convoluted philosophy that incorporates crime, personal freedom and autonomy is a ticking time bomb; add to this a bored sociopath with too much time on his hands, and the two working in concert makes a potent combination that must necessarily at some point result in a blatant disregard for the laws of man as well as the laws of nature.  And it is just such a scenario that is visited by director Barbet Schroeder in his taut thriller, ""Murder by Numbers,"" a psychological crime/drama over which the shadow of Hitchcock looms large.  To the discerning viewer, it's evident early on that this film is going to probe a bit deeper than the a typical offering of the genre, and happily it's not an empty promise, but one which Schroeder fulfills entirely.  It's absorbing stuff, and the route he takes for the journey makes this a thoroughly satisfying and thought provoking cinematic experience.The story revolves around a pair of high school seniors, Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt), two polar opposites living in an upscale seaside city in Northern California, who for their own sundry reasons concoct in theory a ""perfect crime,"" or more specifically, the perfect murder.  And when the body of a young woman is found in a nearby woods, it falls to veteran detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and her partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), to investigate and sort it all out.  The evidence seems to lead in one direction, but certain circumstances and Cassie's instincts come into play, indicating otherwise.  Eventually, the question is, are Richard and Justin involved?  Which is precisely what Cassie-- who is currently dealing with some personal issues-- and Ben have to determine.  All they know for sure is that a woman who should still be walking around isn't; and they have to know why.  And soon.The screenplay for this film is clever and extremely well written by Tony Gayton, and he goes to a number of sources to create a rather astute and insightful commentary on the human condition, including man's inherent capacity for good and evil.  Reminiscent of the infamous Leopold/Loeb ""thrill killing"" murder case of the 1920s, Gayton's story evokes a philosophical sense of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment,"" and references 19th Century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's ""Lettre du Voyant,"" the famous manifesto in which the visionary poet discusses the goal of the ""voyant,"" the poet who must practice the ""deranging of the senses"" to attain a transcendental state, which he calls the ""unknown.""  Or, as Justin, especially, sees it, ""freedom.""  It's an intelligent treatment of a concept almost too terrifying to even contemplate-- the cold blooded murder of an innocent victim chosen at random, and for nothing more than the singular purpose of the experience.  And it's disconcerting to say the least when you consider the fact that there ""are"" people like this walking around loose in a world we must share with them.The extraordinary thing about this film is that Schroeder was able to translate Gayton's ideas so succinctly and successfully to the screen.  This material could easily have been rendered in a dry and academic way that would have been tedious, or it could have gone the other way, losing the sagacious aspects entirely in what would have been an ill-advised attempt to capture the attention of those less inclined to embrace an offering demanding of some deliberation.  It created a dangerous line to tread between the possibilities, either/or to which a director of lesser integrity would easily have succumbed.  Schroeder, however, obviously had a firm grasp of Gayton's intent, recognizing from the beginning where the heart and soul of the story lay, and it is that which he proceeded to present in his film.With every film she makes, Sandra Bullock proves herself increasingly worthy of respect and regard as an actor and as an artist.  She can be America's Sweetheart (Lucy, ""While You Were Sleeping""), the not-quite-the-girl-next-door type (Sarah, ""Forces of Nature""), a savvy FBI agent (Gracie, ""Miss Congeniality""), or a very real person with very real personal issues who just happens to be an accomplished professional in her field, as she portrays here as Cassie.  With every role, Bullock continues to grow as an actor; here, she refuses to trade on her natural charisma and proven, personal qualities to play what could have been just a variation of another ""cop.""  Instead, she creates a character who is obviously conflicted, but who deals with it in her own way in her own time, which adds the kind of personal mystery to Cassie that makes her at once sympathetic and interesting.  It's a convincing, introspective performance that shows yet another side of Bullock, and it's arguably one of her best.Ben Chaplin does an excellent job, as well, with his portrayal of Sam.  It's a very subtle performance in which he captures the very essence of the mundane realism of everyday life.  Sam is a normal guy who is there to do a job, and Chaplin presents him in terms that are credible and convincing, which in turn lends even more credibility to the overall film.  It's a very understated performance that makes this part and his character entirely effective.Finally, what really closes the deal for the success of this film are the performances of Gosling and Pitt.  Gosling finds the perfect note in his pretentious, arrogant attitude and self-indulgent personality.  And Pitt affects an eerily unsettling demeanor that will haunt you long after the film has ended.  Together, they are even more effective than Stockwell and Dillman were as the killers Judd and Artie, in the similar 1959 film,  ""Compulsion.""  This story is intrinsically closer to the truth than many will be willing to admit, and because of that, ""Murder by Numbers"" will never achieve the acclaim or stature it deserves; nonetheless, this is riveting drama that is definitely going to make you think and reflect a bit.",5,Well Crafted and Delivered,1033603200,"10 3, 2002",2002,6015,"['individual', 'disturbed', 'mind', 'convoluted',

Being a survivor herself she's relentless when it comes to tracking down men who prey on vulnerable women. Two such men, Jason (Michael Pitt) and Richard (Ryan Gosling), are attempting to pull off the perfect murder.

When the body of a female washes ashore Cassie begins her investigation and it doesn't take long for her to cross paths with the two young men. Pretty much all the plot ""twists"" are predictable but there is one last minute surprise that proves effective. Bullock doesn't look or act too good here.

594035,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JL29,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","The best reason to see this movie now, several years after it came out, is to enjoy an early role from Ryan Gosling.  In many ways, his performance as one of two empty, misguided teenage boys who commit murder just to see if they can do it got him the initial attention that later led to success in UNITED STATES OF LELAND, THE NOTEBOOK, HALF NELSONHalf Nelson, FRACTURE, etc.  He is very good, in a way that reminds me of early performances from Ed Norton.  His mannerisms weren't so familiar yet...he seemed fresh and alive.  When he's on screen...the movie pops and you can't take your eyes off him.Michael Pitt, as the other killer, is a creepy presence as well...but he's a more predictable character...just kinda morose and an obvious outsider.  He has no charisma (nor should he) and Gosling's character just stomps all over him.  One could argue that Gosling isn't playing the movie at the same level as the rest of the cast...he's up on a different plane...and therefore he's really upstaging his fellow actors.  But honestly, if it weren't for his out-there intensity...the movie would be a waste of time.So, the criminals are mostly fun to watch.  We enjoy seeing how they put it all together, and how the start to fall apart as the cops move in.  That's fine.  But on the other side, we have the ""good guys"" primarily represented by Sandra Bullock.  We're to believe she's this damaged soul, driven to take reckless shortcuts and driven to sleep with (and dispose of) all her male partners.  It's possible that a more feral actress, or a more skillful one, could have pulled off this rather ridiculous character.  But Bullock flounders.  Her relationship with her fellow cops consists mostly of her tossing off insults and innuendos...followed by unconvincing scenes of seduction.  When she tries to rub Ben Chaplin's groin with her sock covered foot in an effort to arouse him...it was cringe-inducing...because Bullock looked so totally uninterested.  Obviously, her character has been badly wounded in the past, and we can understand that her relationships with others might be spotty...but mostly she comes across as unlikeable and UNSYMPATHETIC.  That's the big problem...we don't feel for her...we just dislike her.The plot itself is fairly straightforward...and frankly, it wasn't really too hard to get these two ""perfect criminals.""  It's the cat-and-mouse aspect we're most supposed to enjoy, as Gosling and Bullock play with each other.  Gosling holds up his end of the act quite admirably...Bullock not so much.It's an okay movie, and if you're a Gosling fan, it's a must see.

594036,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JL29,Roland E. Zwick,"[15, 15]","""Murder By Numbers"" is merely the latest version of the old Leopold and Loeb story, wherein two amoral youths plan and execute a cold-blooded murder for the sheer intellectual challenge of seeing if they can get away with it.  Alfred Hitchcock had a go at the tale back in the 1940's in a film called ""Rope,"" and now it appears to be Barbet Schroeder's turn this time around.  Aided by writer Tony Gayton, Schroeder focuses on Richard and Justin, two high school buddies living in a bucolic seaside community in Northern California, who commit murder in order to prove Justin's thesis that the courage to carry through with a crime is the ultimate form of human freedom.  Anyone who has read ""Crime and Punishment"" will know immediately that this is not a particularly original philosophical position and, in fact, the film even makes some heavy-handed allusions to that famous novel in the fact that one of the characters in the movie keeps referring to Justin, the mastermind of the plot, as ""Napoleon"" (Napoleon serves as the inspiration for the novel's main character, Raskolnikov).  Richard is the pretty little rich boy, popular in school for both his good looks and his attitude of cool detachment, while Justin is the nerdy intellectual, dismissed by most of his peers as creepily eccentric, who has made an exhaustive study of just how to ""get away with murder"" by circumventing all the forensic techniques used in modern crime scene investigation.""Murder By Numbers"" is definitely at its best when it is focusing on the two youths and the strange relationship between them - and clearly at its worst when it is viewing matters from the opposite perspective, that of the criminal investigating team led by Cassie Mayweather, played by Sandra Bullock.  Cassis seems to come equipped with all the standard baggage common to lead female characters who happen to be working in a predominantly ugly (i.e. male-dominated) profession.  The brusque demeanor with which she confronts most of her colleagues has earned her the affectionate nicknames ""Hyena"" and ""Scorpion"" (the former because hyenas apparently have a pseudo-penis and the latter for more obviously symbolic reasons).  Not only is this beautiful young woman (as always) unattached (why are such attractive people in movies never in relationships?), but she drives men away by her refusal to let any of them get truly near to her.  The filmmakers have tried to apply some psychological depth to her character by having her suffering from the effects of a traumatic event in her past, but this whole aspect seems strangely unconvincing and tacked on - and rather distracting when what we really want to be doing is following the much more interesting drama taking place between the two boys.Although Bullock is never less than competent in the lead role, the scene-stealers turn out to be Ryan Gosling as Richard and, most especially, Michael Pitt as Justin.  These two fine actors command our attention every time they appear on the screen and lift this rather routine script to the level of high drama more frequently than it surely deserves.  Pitt, in particular, beautifully underplays the role of the social outcast, a boy so intellectually brilliant that he cannot connect with the flesh-and-blood people around him.  Yet, the single finest aspect of the screenplay is that it does not portray Pitt as a hopelessly twisted maniac.

But then 'While you were sleeping' and 'Hope floats' were thoroughly cliched and made me wonder if she was just a one-film wonder.  Well, she did prove me otherwise in 'Murder by numbers'.If you thought from the title or the trailer that this film is about a serial killer, you are wrong (I did that same mistake too!).  This film is about the perfect crime or what the killer(s) think will be a perfect crime.  As is the case with all killers, they do one simple mistake and that is enough for Casey (the cop played by Sandra Bullock) and her partner Sam to solve the case.Even though there is no actual suspense in the film, I will not spoil the plot by telling who the killers are.  The director does not attempt to hide the identity of the killers, it is fairly clear who the killers are right from the first or second scene.  In spite of this, the film continues to gather momentum, with Sandra Bullock and her partner doing their detective work meticulously.  Where the film lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for it in the tight story-line and the excellent acting by all the actors.Sandra Bullock is very convincing as the troubled cop who has a checkered history of her own and that comes to light as the film progresses.  Ben Chaplin, who plays Bullock's partner Sam is good too, but the best acting in the film comes from the two young men played by Ryan Gosling (who plays Richard) and Michael Pitt (who plays Justin).  Gosling is nothing less than brilliant in his portrayal and his future as an actor sure looks bright.The film drags a bit towards the end, with the climax being a bit cliched.

Sandra Bullock stars as Casey Mayweather, modern cinema's cockeyed idea of a heroine.  She is stoic, selfish--though, of course, we're to believe that's really just because she's emotionally vulnerable--hard-drinking and sexually aggressive.  In short, she behaves like the stereotype of a man until half way through the film when she gets to develop actual human feelings, and the only reason we should care about anything she does seems to be her looks.  Bullock chooses to show these qualities mostly by talking deeper and slower than usual and not smiling unless she's doing something mean-spirited or self-satisfying.  Oh, and to be particularly gritty, she keeps her hair in a ponytail.  The actual story seems to take about an hour too long to tell.  Two creepy and smarmy but privileged high schoolers in California (once more shown by Hollywood as a racial undiverse state, desite reality) decide to kill a woman for the thrill and challenge.  Mayweather chases them.  It's nothing you haven't seen before in one form or another, just not as good; at the very least, Columbo dished out better versions of the same idea every week.  Minor diversions in the story, such as Mayweather's seducing her partner, generally make her character seem like a pig rather than a rebel, and the fact that she survived an abusive relationship that apparently motivates her interest in the case only seems tacked on.  Even a scene where one of the killers comes on to her and she injures him while half-heartedly thwarting his advances is particularly odd.  She's more invested in the killer's welfare--a wormy guy whose power over people is baffling--at that moment than she was after sleeping with her befuddled partner, who seems to be falling for her.

The script seems more interested in establishing Sandra Bullock's likable, quirky and oversexed homicide detective Cassie Mayweather, but ultimately does very little with her except tack on a backstory resolution which is only tangentially related to the case.

I didn't find the boys menacing or Sandra Bullock believable as a hard-bitten cop.  Their acting was good, and if the time spent on Bullock's clunky back-story had been devoted to more in-depth characterizations of the boys, the movie might have succeeded.  Bullock had too much baggage to carry, and the boys didn't have enough.The story is very loosely based on the Chicago Leopold & Loeb murders in the '20's.  Two overly bright boys with too much time and money on their hands plan the ""perfect"" murder.  Justin (Michael Pitt) is shown as enjoying the planning and theory, but procrastinates on the execution. He is a dreamy intellectual boy who is compelling with his androgynous looks. Richard (Ryan Gosling) appears to be the man of action--doesn't care about the whys and wherefores, just wants the thrill. Gosling wears Richard's #1 Popular Boy personality like a second skin.  The difficulty is in imagining how these two polar opposites ever got together at all. Sandra Bullock (Cassie) is the detective in charge whose personality is supposedly so abrasive; she is called ""The Hyena"" behind her back.  She may be sexually dismissive, intuitive, hyper-energized, but a Hyena, she is not.  She backs down from confrontations right and left.  Her partner, Ben Chaplin, was one big cipher to me.  He had a pained demeanor throughout. He didn't act; he was acted upon.The pace was good, and the film was entertaining.  Miss Bullock put a lot of effort into her role, but I couldn't help but think how a Stockard Channing or a Sigourney Weaver would have made her role a tour de force. 3-1/2 stars.-sweetmolly-Amazon[.com] Reviewer",4,"Sandra, Michael and Ryan Came Out To Play----",1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,1733,"['-cops', 'felons', 'sunny', 'day.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'immersed', 'sort', 'reality', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'boys', 'menacing', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'believable', 'hard-bitten', 'cop', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'spent', 'Bullock', 'clunky', 'back-story', 'had', 'been', 'devoted', 'more', 'in-depth', 'characterizations', 'boys', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'succeeded', 'Bullock', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'baggage', 'carry', 'boys', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough.The', 'story', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Chicago', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'murders', ""'20"", 'Two', 'overly', 'bright', 'boys', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'hands', 'plan', 'perfect', 'murder', 'Justin', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'shown', 'enjoying', 'planning', 'theory', 'execution', 'dreamy', 'intellectual', 'boy', 'who', 'compelling', 'androgynous', 'looks', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'be', 'man', 'action', ""n't"", 'care', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'just', 'thrill', 'Gosling', 'Richard', '1', 'Popular', 'Boy', 'personality', 'second', 'skin', 'difficulty', 'imagining', 'how', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'ever', 'got', 'together', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Cassie', 'detective', 'charge', 'personality', 'supposedly', 'so', 'abrasive', 'called', 'Hyena', 'back', 'may', 'be', 'sexually', 'dismissive', 'intuitive', 'hyper-energized', 'Hyena', 'not', 'down', 'confrontations', 'right', 'left', 'Her', 'partner', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'cipher', 'had', 'pained', 'demeanor', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'acted', 'upon.The', 'pace', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'Miss', 'Bullock', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'role', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'role', 'tour', 'force', '3-1/2', 'stars.-sweetmolly-Amazon', '[', '.com', ']', 'Reviewer']",Murder by Numbers

594053,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JL29,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","Sandra Bullock is cast against type as homicide detective Cassie Mayweather, who has to face two unpleasant facts of reality.One of them is, as you soon realise in the opening scenes, the investigation of her new case leading to the pair of suspects who turned out affluent high school kids in a peaceful seaside town.  We are introduced, from the beginning, to the culprits, a la ""Columbo"" style.  These two kids Richard and Justine, without particular reasons, kill one of the residents of the town, and leaves the evidence, which they know would fit the description of the criminal that now-familiar FBI profiling would make.  There is an inevitable ""fall guy"" they prepare, and the investigation in fact leads to that conclusion.But Cassie only is not convinced.  Her instinct as a detective tells her that THEY did it.  But how can she make others in the police believe when everything fits in clean?  And Cassie has another enemy to face, long buried in her memory, but now coming back again.  And that has something to do with her past.The murder case here is, as many pointed out, loosely based on ""Loeb-Leopold"" case, the real murder which happened in 1924.  But you may forget the fact (unless you want to see more films inspired by the case, like ""Rope"" by Hitchcock, for instance).  You should remember that it is directed by Barbet Schroeder, whose style is seen in thrillers like ""Single White Female.""  He is good at creating sinister, brooding atomosphere, but the storytelling is often not smooth, or often, clumsy.  That same trait can be seen again here, but this case his slow narrative works, because the film attempts to reveal the psycological aspects of the murder, especially those about the rich, spoiled  kids.  He should be praised for not making them simple monsters, trying to set up the plausible characters in them, and two young actors Michael Pitt (no relation to Brad) and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast.Maybe I am wrong, but it is Sandra Bullock who has some problem.  It is not that she is not good; she is good as a troubled investigator Cassie.  But, it seems that the script demands too much from this leading character, who, as I told, must encounter a couple of hideous facts of life face to face.  When the flashback scenes come on screen, I thought ""Oh, no, please,"" because what they are trying to imply is too obvious from the first ten minutes.  The script attempts to be thrilling, intelligent, and multi-layered, but about the last one, it went too far, I am afraid.The film shows convincingly detailed forensic techiniques, and the ever-changing relations between the high-school students are always believable (but one love interest, and slight homosexual nuance are both underdeveloped).  My verdict is only three stars, but that's because I prefer Hitchcock, and that's all.  The film is titled ""Murder by Numbers,"" but it manages to be called ""By the Number"" ... perhaps barely.",3,"Bit Unpleasant, & Too Stretched, But Still Has Good Moments",1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,2933,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'cast', 'type', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Cassie', 'Mayweather', 'who', 'face', 'two', 'unpleasant', 'facts', 'reality.One', 'soon', 'realise', 'opening', 'scenes', 'investigation', 'new', 'case', 'leading', 'pair', 'suspects', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'affluent', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'peaceful', 'seaside', 'town', 'are', 'introduced', 'beginning', 'culprits', 'la', 'Columbo', 'style', 'two', 'kids', 'Richard', 'Justine', 'particular', 'reasons', 'kill', 'one', 'residents', 'town', 'evidence', 'know', 'would', 'fit', 'description', 'criminal', 'now-familiar', 'FBI', 'profiling', 'would', 'make', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'guy', 'prepare', 'investigation', 'fact', 'conclusion.But', 'Cassie', 'only', 'not', 'convinced', 'instinct', 'detective', 'THEY', 'did', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'others', 'police', 'believe', 'when', 'everything', 'fits', 'clean', 'Cassie', 'enemy', 'face', 'long', 'buried', 'memory', 'now', 'coming', 'back', 'again', 'something', 'do', 'past.The', 'murder', 'case', 'here', 'many', 'pointed', 'out', 'loosely', 'based', 'Loeb-Leopold', 'case', 'real', 'murder', 'happened', '1924', 'may', 'forget', 'fact', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'inspired', 'case', 'Rope', 'Hitchcock', 'instance', 'should', 'remember', 'directed', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'style', 'seen', 'thrillers', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'good', 'creating', 'sinister', 'brooding', 'atomosphere', 'storytelling', 'often', 'not', 'smooth', 'often', 'clumsy', 'same', 'trait', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'here', 'case', 'slow', 'narrative', 'works', 'film', 'attempts', 'reveal', 'psycological', 'aspects', 'murder', 'especially', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'not', 'making', 'simple', 'monsters', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'plausible', 'characters', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'relation', 'Brad', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast.Maybe', 'am', 'wrong', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'problem', 'not', 'not', 'good', 'good', 'troubled', 'investigator', 'Cassie', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'leading', 'character', 'who', 'told', 'must', 'encounter', 'couple', 'hideous', 'facts', 'life', 'face', 'face', 'When', 'flashback', 'come', 'screen', 'thought', 'Oh', 'please', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'imply', 'too', 'obvious', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'script', 'attempts', 'be', 'thrilling', 'intelligent', 'multi-layered', 'last', 'one', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'am', 'afraid.The', 'film', 'shows', 'convincingly', 'detailed', 'forensic', 'techiniques', 'ever-changing', 'relations', 'high-school', 'students', 'are', 'always', 'believable', 'one', 'love', 'interest', 'slight', 'homosexual', 'nuance', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'verdict', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'prefer', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'titled', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'be', 'called', 'Number', 'perhaps', 'barely']",Murder by Numbers

The plot is good and kudos go for the teenage actors, as they were great.Ryan Gosling,( Remember The Titans) did an outstanding job as the leader and bully of the two teens. While Michael Pitt (Hedweg And The Angry Inch), and Bully, played the submissive know-it-all-geek. They are in their senior year , and they plot to murder someone as the ultimate part of being. Which brings to mind the Loeb, Leopold murder movie, (Compulsion).The script bounces around enough to keep you interested. And the twists and turns are really not that predictable, no matter what other reviewers say. The two teens have a pseudo-homosexual relationship and you can see Ryans fondness for Michael in the way he holds Michael close to him after raging at him. Michael is mesmerized by Ryan, but does not return the fondness. One gets the feeling that something had happened earlier in their childhood, as Michael tells the girl he is going out with, ""I wish I had met you first""Ben Chaplin, (Thin Red Line, and Birthday Girl) has the potential to be a great actor, and why he does not get a good place on this billing roster is puzziling to me. He has the looks, but needs to get out of his shell and do something really crazy like, (Urbania, or The World And Time Enough,  Bird Cage), something zany!! He is way to serious.Sandra Bullock (Miss Congenialty, 28 Days), also needs to break the mold she has put herself in, you can anticipate her every move and facial expression....she is good in this film but, predictable.There are no perfect films, one can always expect to find some flaws and this film is no exception.
