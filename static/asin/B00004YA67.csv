559037,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00004YA67,Alex Udvary,"[3, 7]","A group of college students; Derrick Webb (James Marsden), Cathy Jones (Lena Headey), and Travis ( Norman Reedus) decide to do a college project about gossip. They decide to create a rumor about Naomi Preston (Kate Hudson, if I read one more time someone mention she's Goldi Hawn's daughter I'll scream! We should all know this by now!) and her at the time boyfriend Beau Edson (Joshua Jackson), claiming the both of them had sex durning a party. So, now with their &quot;story&quot;, they make sure they're able to spread it at school. We are then able to see just how gossip &quot;works&quot;. We hear people make up things by adding things to the story they weren't told! I myself I'm not someone who likes to gossip, so the whole idea of the movie was very interesting. I was really caught in the movie. I enjoyed watching the characters, and thought everyone gave a good performance. I must admit though, I was able to preict the ending, but, I won't spoil it for anyone else. If it wasn't for the fact I was able to see the ending coming, I might of given this a higher rating. I think this movie will be able to entertain a lot of people. The screenplay by Gregory Poirier and Theresa Rebeck is intriguing. It was, I thought, a very original story, that had a lot going for it. Teens will enjoy the movie more I think, because, I think it's aimed at them more (the young cast and characters, the setting on a college campus).

Are most people willing to tell a half-truth or a lie now and then? Is it OK to mislead people to get free drinks or be admired or impress their friends or spice up a news story? Does that make them bad people? Where do these people draw the line and feel they have to tell the truth? This movie has some fabulously rich and beautiful people which may not make it seem very &#34;realistic&#34; to some. The casting is really good. You aren't necessarily supposed to like hardly any of these characters, and how you feel about them may change dramatically as you watch the film. If character development doesn't mean anything to you, then skip this film.

The film, about some sleazy and wholly unbelievable goings-on at a college, is shot like an advertisement, and has a lot of gorgeous actors and actresses (Kate Hudson, the lovely Lena Headey -it's a pity she's not more famous) and the ending is unconvincing, but if you accept the whole artificiality of the concept, you will enjoy it as much as I did.",3,Enjoyable Trash,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,456,"['Gossip', 'far', 'masterpiece', 'good', 'trashy', 'fun', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'film', 'sleazy', 'wholly', 'unbelievable', 'goings-on', 'college', 'shot', 'advertisement', 'lot', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'lovely', 'Lena', 'Headey', '-it', 'pity', 'not', 'more', 'famous', 'ending', 'unconvincing', 'accept', 'whole', 'artificiality', 'concept', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A
559040,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004YA67,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","This is one of those films that really misses the point it was trying to make, if it was even really `trying' to make a point in the first place.  I was really excited about this film (probably all for the wrong reasons) but it came out shortly after the brilliantly crafted `Cruel Intentions' (yes, I said brilliant, and I still heartily believe it) and so the whole `rich youth committing dastardly deeds' formula was in, and I was interested.  The problem with `Gossip' is that it doesn't really get anything right.I mean, it's not even `trashy' fun.The film revolves around three college students (Cathy, Derrick and Travis) who decide to plant and track a rumor for a journalism class.  They decide to pick on Naomi and Beau, the beautiful couple (Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson are pretty darn beautiful) but it's obvious, at least as far as Derrick is concerned, that this is far from just a class project.The obviousness of this movie is kind of annoying.For me, what strikes me as so tragic, is that this film doesn't really know how to make anything work.  As far as the whole `seductive teen melodrama' thing goes, this film is just far too dark to understand how to make that aspect appealing.  As far as the whole `poignant life lessons learned' thing goes, this film is far too preposterous to make that work.  I mean, this was a prime opportunity to really deliver a punch.  The idea behind the destructive powers of gossip, especially in this setting, could have been truly remarkably astute, but instead this plays out like a soap opera, with obvious clich&eacute;s, overworked performances, and ludicrousness around every corner.And yes, the ending is just...well, don't get me started.I don't even consider the acting to be a saving grace here.  Hudson has some nice scenes (although it's no comparison to her Oscar nominated performance this very same year for `Almost Famous') but nothing truly remarkable.  Lena Headey is just kind of, well, she's decent.  James Marsden destroys this whole film with his ridiculously obvious sinister portrayal of Derrick.  I mean, this performance may be one of the worst of the decade.  This movie tarnished him forever in my book, and I've actually kind of liked him in other things, but whenever I think of him I think of THIS movie and THIS performance and I get kind of, well, irritated.I don't see ANY reason to watch this movie, unless you want a headache or you are having trouble sleeping and want something that will bore you to sleep.I'm done.",1,From my lips to your ears...,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2511,"['one', 'films', 'really', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'was', 'even', 'really', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'film', 'probably', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'came', 'out', 'shortly', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'yes', 'said', 'brilliant', 'still', 'heartily', 'believe', 'so', 'whole', 'rich', 'youth', 'committing', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'formula', 'was', 'was', 'interested', 'problem', 'Gossip', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'anything', 'right.I', 'mean', 'not', 'even', 'trashy', 'fun.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'three', 'college', 'students', 'Cathy', 'Derrick', 'Travis', 'who', 'decide', 'plant', 'track', 'rumor', 'journalism', 'class', 'decide', 'pick', 'Naomi', 'Beau', 'beautiful', 'couple', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'beautiful', 'obvious', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Derrick', 'concerned', 'far', 'just', 'class', 'project.The', 'obviousness', 'movie', 'kind', 'annoying.For', 'what', 'so', 'tragic', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'anything', 'work', 'As', 'far', 'whole', 'seductive', 'teen', 'melodrama', 'thing', 'film', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'understand', 'how', 'make', 'aspect', 'appealing', 'As', 'far', 'whole', 'poignant', 'life', 'lessons', 'learned', 'thing', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'preposterous', 'make', 'work', 'mean', 'was', 'prime', 'opportunity', 'really', 'deliver', 'punch', 'idea', 'destructive', 'powers', 'gossip', 'especially', 'setting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'remarkably', 'astute', 'instead', 'out', 'soap', 'opera', 'obvious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'overworked', 'performances', 'ludicrousness', 'around', 'corner.And', 'yes', 'ending', 'just', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'acting', 'be', 'saving', 'grace', 'here', 'Hudson', 'nice', 'scenes', 'comparison', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'nothing', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'just', 'kind', 'well', 'decent', 'James', 'Marsden', 'whole', 'film', 'ridiculously', 'obvious', 'sinister', 'portrayal', 'Derrick', 'mean', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'decade', 'movie', 'tarnished', 'forever', 'book', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'kind', 'liked', 'other', 'things', 'whenever', 'think', 'think', 'THIS', 'movie', 'THIS', 'performance', 'get', 'kind', 'well', 'irritated.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ANY', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'headache', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'want', 'something', 'will', 'bore', 'sleep.I', ""'m"", 'done']",N/A

It's about what happens when you spread rumors involving rape and murder, however the execution of the writing and storytelling leaves me scratching my head and wondering how anybody thought such a concept was good enough to actually release to movie theaters across the country.My biggest complaint is that none of the characters were interesting enough. Actually, there's more of an issue here than simply ""not interesting enough"".  It's like every single actor and actress in this film was totally wrong for the part, so their role came across as either awkward or boring.  I found myself caring about absolutely nobody, or anything they had to say.  The poor writing was probably mostly responsible for this, however.I suppose the ending is decent which is why I'm going to be nice and give Gossip 2 stars instead of 1, but other than the ending, the storytelling, lack of suspense, and lack of interesting direction really was a major distraction for me, and it's plainly obvious Gossip would flop right from the unbelievable nature of the characters in the beginning of the movie with everyone hitting on each other at a nightclub and acting like it's perfectly normal to act this way.

The opening scenes are like Dante's circles of hell rather than scenes of a cool place.Second, fans of Marsden will hate this movie.  Marsden plays a bad guy in this.  A lot of films recently have a main character who is obnoxious for 85 minutes, then miraculously turns into a good guy.  In this movie, the bad buy remains bad throughout.  This fact accounts for virtually all of the bad reviews below.  Fans wanted Marsden to turn into a good guy.  He doesn't.  That does not mean the ending is wrong.For grownups who are not fans, this movie is worth seeing.  The main character is the Lena Headey character, who is quite sympathetic.  I would have given the movie 4 stars except for one scene in which she gives herself to the Marsden character.  This was not only repulsive but seemed out of character.  Luckily, only the beginning is shown before the scene cuts.  If you can stomach this scene or fast-forward over it, you'll have a four-star movie.  (The other scene in which the girl throws up when she tries to have sex with the Marsden character seemed much more appropriate.)This is a movie about people's beliefs and what happens when people form opinions based on hearsay rather than on evidence.  In this case, the hearsay is gossip.  In other cases, it's radio and TV talk shows, or magazine and newspaper articles.  Relying on the fact that other people have reached the same conclusion is a poor substitute for evidence.In this story, the victims turn and avenge themselves on the perpetrator.  If you prefer to see the bad guys triumph, then this movie is not for you.

Though we're supposed to be convinced that everything is covered by Derek's trust fund.They're college students (Freshmen even.) but old enough to drink. Derek has a full bar and the three go to clubs and bars more than twice in the movie. Derek seems to have a thing with saying ""Let's all just have a drink.""The three decide to spread a rumor for a class and track it's progress and how much it's changed when they hear about it again. The rumor itself was, at a party all three and many other students attended; a rich girl named Naomi has sex with her date Beau in a bedroom upstairs. Naomi is supposed to be a sweet and celibate girl and as it turns out, she can't remember a thing anyway from the party.Accusations, bad versions of the rumor and fights ensue because of this. Which leads to Jones starting to feel bad, especially because it was her idea to start a rumor for class. But the rumor itself was thought up by Derek. Travis...does all the work it seems. He's the artistic and loyal one of the three.Travis is the only one we see recording any facts for the assignment from endlessly making graphics that show these events happening and putting them on his wall (Derek: ""What are you going to do, turn in your room?"") to recording students' thoughts, while Jones fights for 'the truth' behind events that take place or have taken place and while Derek revels in his lifestyle, bar and popularity with women.There's many plotholes in this movie and you'll either be annoyed or draw your own conclusions. Norman Reedus (Travis) is really the most experienced and talented actor in this movie and it's too bad he did get a small part even if he did play it well. And I find it amusing that he was referred to also as a young new actor when he has done a good ten movies before this one and was 29/30 when filming 'Gossip'. (Even though he can still easily pass for mid twenties.) James Marsden was impressive to a degree as was Edward James Olmos, everyone else while attractive, I was only impressed by on a mediocre level.The DVD was good for the special features including the full club scene with Poe singing ""My Lips Are Sealed"" and Tonic's video for the movie only including 'Travis' and clips from the movie.The alternate ending on the DVD makes much more sense than the one they chose. The ending left us bored, questioning and frustrated because the movie was good and intriguing (Albeit not very realistic.) but the ending was a let down.

I can forgive her for being in such an awful movie.The 3 initial main characters are a spoiled pompous ""trust fund"" baby (James Mardsen), a ""freaky artist type"" and a somewhat awkward goody two-shoes girl just trying to have some fun. The stereo types represented are pathetic, at best.  All 3 live in an NYC loft that not even the real actors could afford, let alone college students! The three do everything together at first. (they all even have the same classes).  For their journalism class project they decide to start a rumor about Kate Hudson (who plays a stereotypical prude) and her boyfriend having sex at a party.  The rumor spreads like wildfire and soon no one (including Kate) knows what the truth is.  The rest of the movie is the repercussions of the rumor.The plot is completely implausible.

Eventually, I did sit down and watch it, a little disappointed with the plot itself,James Marsden's acting sure did fix it up a whole lot.  That was without a doubt the highlight of this film.The plot itself was a little above marginal...kind of following in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; footsteps.  A little iffy here and there, and it trys in certain aspects to become a little bit artsy.  The drama in it is also okay, nothing extravagant.  Although, with all of the other teen films out nowadays(&quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, &quot;I know what you did last summer&quot;, and &quot;She's All That&quot;) this is much much better than those.  With those being far far too pointless and unimaginable, this is a little bit more believable.  Yet, it could have been a little more spread out, and the ending was a little too &quot;Saved By the Bell&quot;-ish, the alternate ending was, in my eyes, far superior(only on the D.V.D.).The only reasons I gave this four stars, which normally would have received a three, was Marsden's performance.  He didn't really get a chance to shine in &quot;X-MEN&quot; but he lit up the screen quite marvelously.  I'm convinced that with the right roles, he's the world's next Brad Pitt.  He's above the stupid teen flick actors such as Freddie Prinze, who could be a bit better if he expanded more.  That's why I think it's important that Marsden chooses the right roles in the future and not become another Mark Paul Gossaler(or however you spell it), or even Freddie Prinze.  He did do a good job signing for the &quot;X-MEN&quot; seqeuls, so he's on his way to stardom.  I'll be looking for more films with him in the future.  This is by far his best acting known to me, better than &quot;Cyclops&quot; in &quot;X-MEN&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot; in &quot;Disturbing Behavior&quot;.

The premise is quite good - three college roommates attending a communications class decide to start a malicious false rumour just to see how far and fast it spreads - and how much embellishment it will accumulate. When the victim of the rumour starts believing in it herself the situation turns ugly.However, the execution of the premise together with the ""surprise"" ending is somewhat flawed and problematic. I do like the pace of the film - it is well-directed and in the general the acting is uniformly strong.Cathy Jones (Lena Headey), Derrick Webb (James Marsden) and Travis (Norman Reedus) are three roommates that seem to have little in common with each other but are close friends nevertheless. Cathy is bright, studious and has a secret crush on independently rich, handsome and natural born liar Derrick. Travis is a poor art student who likes creating photo montages (I wonder how he can afford that fancy digital film scanning and editing equipment and those industrial grade design printers!). They share lodgings in Derrick's ultra chic apartment loft and occasionally attend communication lectures given by the supercilious Professor Goodwin (Eric Bogosian) - when they are not drinking or hanging out in nightclubs.One day, they decide to start a rumour that rich girl Naomi Preston (Kate Hudson) slept with Beau Edson (Joshua Jackson) in a bedroom atop a nightclub (How many nightclubs do you know that have upstairs bedrooms? With three projectors displaying pictures on the walls?). As Naomi has a reputation for being chaste, the rumour spreads like wildfire. Problem is: Naomi had passed out at the time and when the rumour reaches her ears, she thinks she must have been raped and decides to press charges.Cathy feels really guilty and wants to confess - but once a rumour has started it's not that easy to quash. Then we discover that at least one of the main characters has a dark past and is not quite the nice but harmlessly mischievous person that we are initially led to believe ... As I've mentioned before, the film features a ""twist"" ending that may surprise you, unless of course you have a warped mind like mine and you saw it coming ages ago.Personally, I found the ending unsatisfying and inconsistent with the rest of the film - even though it did occur to me about halfway through the film. It doesn't sit well with the psychological profile and motivation of some of the characters, and significantly dilutes the original premise that malicious gossip can be really harmful.

559056,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00004YA67,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","I got this movie for 2 reasons.  I loved Kate Hudson as Penny Lane in Almost Famous & have enjoyed watching James Marsden this season on Ally McBeal singing old Sinatra tunes like ""Ain't That A Kick In the Head?""  The film wasn't perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I really like the sense of community you get between the three leads.  Norman Reedus' performance as the somewhat maladjusted but brilliant artist Travis was superbly understated.  Marsden didn't sing Sinatra, but he did a good job at the conceited & charming Derrick Webb.  I think the false note for me was how easily he turned on his friends when he seemed to invest so much emotional energy in them.  I would have liked to have seen the emotional cost.  I didn't believe that Derrick would be as big of a liar as he turned out to be.  Lena Headey was quite elegant as the earthy Ms. Jones.  Kate Hudson seemed wasted in the movie, usually appearing as the rich aloof Ms. Popularity.  Her scene with Jones made her seem approachable and real.  I didn't ever get the sense of hurt from her rape which should have been somewhere in the movie.  I still lament the fact that Sharon Lawrence got shot on NYPD Blue & wish she was still married to Sipowitz; so was sad she wasn't better used in this film.  She added a great reality to her few scenes and showed what a fine actress she is.  The sets were kind of like Miami Vice updated.  The wealthy kids I knew in college were more into grunge, but the film is visually appealing.  I liked Eric Bogosian's brief role as the professor and would have liked a higher profile as the movie climaxed.  Edward James Olmos shows good depth for as small of a part as he played.  Joshua Jackson did a good job of making out with Kate Hudson.  And finally, I liked this film because it was about something.  The idea of how words can be hurtful has a universality that can be adapted in each generation.

Director Davis Guggenheim doesn't help by using self-conscious camerawork, giving rich James Marsden a designer apartment, and laughable excuses for lectures by Eric Bogosian.Hudson is as beautiful as her character is said to be, is seen lieing langerously on her bed in long shoot, and is the only person to express honest emotions. Poor Lena Headey suffers from being a Winona clone with bad teeth, Norman Reedus is the Bill Gates-style geek via James Dean, and Marsden's constant pacing seems to be him running away from his pretty boy woman-hater's obvious latent homosexuality.

559067,AS3UXYC6G4XN8,B00004YA67,"RootlessAgrarian ""cine-curmudgeon""","[15, 18]","I'm surprised that reviews of this tidy little work are so mixed.  It's a reliable enough recipe:  take 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and mix with 'House of Games,' but lighten it up with a dash of glitz, a fetching fantasy of idealized college life, and no major downer at the end :-)The young actors are pretty and some are talented, and the dialogue is not bad -- some of it is actually rather good.  The sets are a bit much, imho -- one wonders just how plush Derek's trust fund is, after seeing the &quot;undergrad apartment&quot; which few dotcom lottery winners could afford to keep up.  There's a relentless  prettiness to most of the backdrops even when they're  trying to look noir, but that can be forgiven in a film which is really more stage play than cinema.  The cinematography is mostly effortless and unobtrusive;  there are a couple of arty little touches, but it's not self-indulgent.Supporting cast do their jobs reliably;  the brief scene in a high school admin office (where &quot;Jones&quot; is pursuing her investigation) is nicely played all the way into the far background of the shot.  Some of the young extras definitely seem to be trolling for work (it's just amazing how pretty everyone is in this universe!) but it's all in good fun.Marsden does very well with the Ripleyesque protagonist. His Marvel Comics good looks and alarming glibness are quite convincing;  I loathed &quot;Derek&quot; after only a few minutes, and enjoyed Marsden's enjoyment of the role.  Actually I should confess, I watched the film only because I like Edward James Olmos and never miss a chance to see him even in a small part; but was pleasantly surprised -- enjoyed it far more than I expected to.One thing I appreciated about the script was a minor surprise value.  Not Derek's true nature -- it's evident from the git-go, so no surprises there;  and we know that poor, bewildered Jones will indeed figure it out given time (if nasty Derek doesn't push her down a staircase first, of course). The surprise I rather liked was that the film  threatens for a moment to turn into another  poor-little-falsely-accused-fellow saga,  a sort of Dinesh D'Souza flavoured backlash tract on the wickedness of ruining young men's lives by actually taking rape seriously.  Just as one is saying Oh Gawd, spare us -- it lightly skips away from the brink of disaster and delivers a far more palatable (and imho useful) message.  It may be rather slickly wrapped, and admittedly unoriginal; but the basic lesson (that liars and users are despicable no matter how handsome/rich/cool they are) is one the human race can always do with.One thing that amused me considerably was the fluency, the articulate command of language which these &quot;college students&quot; converse and declaim.  I work at a University, and the undergraduates with whom I come in daily contact seem to have vocabularies of less than 800 words, including a fairly rich, repetitive admixture of the short one that starts with F.  I would very much like to think that films like this could revive an interest in being articulate, witty, and intelligent-sounding among undergraduate and high-school age people;  I've become a bit weary of the fashion for sounding and acting illiterate and stupid.Well, end of rant :-)  I think this is a well-crafted, undemanding, fresh and shiny little work that may entertain people even a few years from now.  It has a peculiar style and sparkle which oddly enough remind me of films of the late 30's and early 40's. I'd recommend it.Someone should compile a good list of films about compulsive liars and charming sociopaths -- 'All About Eve' comes to mind, 'Ripley' of course, and 'Deathtrap' -- I think 'Gossip' would be worthy of inclusion.  Timothy Dalton in 'Framed' would make the list, with an honourable mention for his youthful effort as the sinister young King of France in 'The Lion in Winter'.",4,high-quality genre fare,980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,3905,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'tidy', 'little', 'work', 'are', 'so', 'mixed', 'reliable', 'enough', 'recipe', 'take', ""'The"", 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'mix', ""'House"", 'Games', 'lighten', 'up', 'dash', 'glitz', 'fetching', 'fantasy', 'idealized', 'college', 'life', 'major', 'downer', 'end', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'are', 'talented', 'dialogue', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'sets', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'imho', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'plush', 'Derek', 'trust', 'fund', 'seeing', 'quot', 'undergrad', 'apartment', 'quot', 'few', 'dotcom', 'lottery', 'winners', 'could', 'afford', 'keep', 'up', 'relentless', 'prettiness', 'most', 'backdrops', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'look', 'noir', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'cinema', 'cinematography', 'mostly', 'effortless', 'unobtrusive', 'are', 'couple', 'arty', 'little', 'touches', 'not', 'self-indulgent.Supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'jobs', 'reliably', 'brief', 'scene', 'high', 'school', 'admin', 'office', 'where', 'quot', 'Jones', 'quot', 'pursuing', 'investigation', 'nicely', 'played', 'way', 'far', 'background', 'shot', 'young', 'extras', 'definitely', 'seem', 'be', 'trolling', 'work', 'just', 'amazing', 'how', 'pretty', 'everyone', 'universe', 'good', 'fun.Marsden', 'very', 'well', 'Ripleyesque', 'protagonist', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'good', 'looks', 'alarming', 'glibness', 'are', 'quite', 'convincing', 'loathed', 'quot', 'Derek', 'quot', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'enjoyed', 'Marsden', 'enjoyment', 'role', 'Actually', 'should', 'confess', 'watched', 'film', 'only', 'like', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'never', 'miss', 'chance', 'see', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'more', 'expected', 'to.One', 'thing', 'appreciated', 'script', 'was', 'minor', 'surprise', 'value', 'Not', 'Derek', 'true', 'nature', 'evident', 'git-go', 'surprises', 'there', 'know', 'poor', 'bewildered', 'Jones', 'will', 'indeed', 'figure', 'out', 'given', 'time', 'nasty', 'Derek', ""n't"", 'push', 'down', 'staircase', 'first', 'course', 'surprise', 'rather', 'liked', 'was', 'film', 'moment', 'turn', 'poor-little-falsely-accused-fellow', 'saga', 'sort', 'Dinesh', ""D'Souza"", 'flavoured', 'backlash', 'tract', 'wickedness', 'ruining', 'young', 'men', 'lives', 'actually', 'taking', 'rape', 'seriously', 'Just', 'one', 'saying', 'Oh', 'Gawd', 'spare', 'lightly', 'away', 'brink', 'disaster', 'delivers', 'far', 'more', 'palatable', 'imho', 'useful', 'message', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'slickly', 'wrapped', 'admittedly', 'unoriginal', 'basic', 'lesson', 'liars', 'users', 'are', 'despicable', 'matter', 'how', 'handsome/rich/cool', 'are', 'one', 'human', 'race', 'can', 'always', 'do', 'with.One', 'thing', 'amused', 'considerably', 'was', 'fluency', 'articulate', 'command', 'language', 'quot', 'college', 'students', 'quot', 'converse', 'declaim', 'work', 'University', 'undergraduates', 'whom', 'come', 'daily', 'contact', 'seem', 'have', 'vocabularies', 'less', '800', 'words', 'including', 'fairly', 'rich', 'repetitive', 'admixture', 'short', 'one', 'F.', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'think', 'films', 'could', 'revive', 'interest', 'being', 'articulate', 'witty', 'intelligent-sounding', 'undergraduate', 'high-school', 'age', 'people', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bit', 'weary', 'fashion', 'sounding', 'acting', 'illiterate', 'stupid.Well', 'end', 'rant', 'think', 'well-crafted', 'undemanding', 'fresh', 'shiny', 'little', 'work', 'may', 'entertain', 'people', 'even', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'peculiar', 'style', 'sparkle', 'oddly', 'enough', 'remind', 'films', 'late', '30', 'early', '40', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'it.Someone', 'should', 'compile', 'good', 'list', 'films', 'compulsive', 'liars', 'charming', 'sociopaths', ""'All"", 'Eve', 'mind', ""'Ripley"", 'course', ""'Deathtrap"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', ""'Framed"", 'would', 'make', 'list', 'honourable', 'mention', 'youthful', 'effort', 'sinister', 'young', 'King', 'France', ""'The"", 'Lion', 'Winter']",N/A

The movie is a bit of a thriller and teen angst drama about the negative consequences of gossip and the evil it can produce. Set in a college, three roomates decide to spread a vicious rumor about a rich girl (Kate Hudson) who gets drunk at a club party. The rumor is that she was date raped by her date. This results in dangerous problems for many of the characters as slowly the truth is developed. The movie may lack some substance as it attempts to be a serious drama about the evil nature of gossip. Like other reviewers have claimed, it's a bit of an intense and dark soap opera in which good looking people set out to harm others. In this case, it's a lot like Cruel Intentions which was in itself a modern take on the French series ""Dangerous Liasions"".The movie is very dark. Some of the mystery is vague as we don't know what to believe is true and what is just gossip. Eventually we discover that James Marsden's character Derek Webb is the real villain and the cause of all the trouble. He had been the high school boyfriend of Kate Hudson's character ""the poor little rich girl"" as he described her. He raped her and again at the party. His lying and scheming comes to an end as he is caught red-handed in confession at the end of the film. The movie is a pretty adult film and not to be seen by too young an audience. I believe there is enough R rated material here to indicate that is intended to be viewed by a mature audience- violence, (...)and language. The college classroom scenes are by far what most attracted me to the story. It is proof that people do love gossip and rumor, as our society does today, but it dehumanizes and corrupts. The battle of the (...)discussion is also quite interesting. But the movie's heart lies in the fact that Derek Webb is a young man we know all too well exists out there and may be getting away with crimes. I hope this movie opens people's eyes about gossip and about lies and how to value the truth which is the greatest human gift of all.",5,Gossip Gone Too Far: A Thriller,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,2175,"['2000', 'film', 'Gossip', 'was', 'not', 'mainstream', 'even', 'much', 'publicized', 'stars', 'attractive', 'young', 'people-', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'movie', 'bit', 'thriller', 'teen', 'angst', 'drama', 'negative', 'consequences', 'gossip', 'evil', 'can', 'produce', 'Set', 'college', 'three', 'roomates', 'decide', 'spread', 'vicious', 'rumor', 'rich', 'girl', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'drunk', 'club', 'party', 'rumor', 'was', 'date', 'raped', 'date', 'results', 'dangerous', 'problems', 'many', 'characters', 'slowly', 'truth', 'developed', 'movie', 'may', 'lack', 'substance', 'be', 'serious', 'drama', 'evil', 'nature', 'gossip', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'claimed', 'bit', 'intense', 'dark', 'soap', 'opera', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'set', 'out', 'harm', 'others', 'case', 'lot', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'was', 'modern', 'take', 'French', 'series', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', '.The', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'mystery', 'vague', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'true', 'what', 'just', 'gossip', 'Eventually', 'discover', 'James', 'Marsden', 'character', 'Derek', 'Webb', 'real', 'villain', 'cause', 'trouble', 'had', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'described', 'raped', 'again', 'party', 'lying', 'scheming', 'end', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'confession', 'end', 'film', 'movie', 'pretty', 'adult', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'too', 'young', 'audience', 'believe', 'enough', 'R', 'rated', 'material', 'here', 'indicate', 'intended', 'be', 'viewed', 'mature', 'audience-', 'violence', 'language', 'college', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'far', 'what', 'most', 'attracted', 'story', 'proof', 'people', 'do', 'love', 'gossip', 'rumor', 'society', 'today', 'corrupts', 'battle', 'discussion', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting', 'movie', 'heart', 'fact', 'Derek', 'Webb', 'young', 'man', 'know', 'too', 'well', 'out', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'away', 'crimes', 'hope', 'movie', 'people', 'eyes', 'gossip', 'lies', 'how', 'value', 'truth', 'greatest', 'human', 'gift']",N/A

In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat ""hero"" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed.",2,plot holes,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2790,"['first', 'hour', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'fact', 'enthralling', 'interesting', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'fact', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'violated', 'boyfriend', 'unconscious', 'According', 'rumor', 'rumor', 'being', 'school', 'experiment', 'conducted', 'three', 'roommates', 'was', 'however', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'However', 'young', 'woman', 'quick', 'think', 'been', 'raped', 'Why', 'attempt', 'physical', 'exam', 'unexplained', 'especially', 'young', 'woman', 'involved', 'reputation', 'being', 'professional', 'virgin', 'however', 'out', ""n't"", 'why', 'movie', 'longer', '30', 'minutes', 'Fortunately', ""'re"", 'not', 'dealing', 'unwanted', 'pregnancies', 'either', ""n't"", 'turn', 'soap', 'opera', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'dreamboat', 'hero', 'who', 'dreams', 'up', 'rumor', 'being', 'raped', 'who', 'unlikeable', 'traits', 'true', 'three', 'roommates', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'being', 'insufferably', 'full', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'turn', 'lead', 'character', 'story', ""'re"", 'following', 'female', 'roommate', 'had', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'basically', 'introduction', 'audience', 'characters', 'out', ""'dreamboat"", 'young', 'woman', 'victim', 'have', 'history', 'together', 'issues', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'everyone', 'else', 'way', 'entire', 'student', 'body', 'faculty', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'sucked', 'story', 'mutual', 'thirst', 'truth', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'truth', 'mind', 'vengeance', 'not', 'justice', 'vengeance', 'when', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'variety', ""n't"", 'fun', 'audience', 'just', 'distasteful', 'other', 'words', 'man', 'woman', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shut', 'up', 'together', 'room', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'left', 'rest', 'alone', 'So', 'brilliant', 'first', 'half-hour', 'btw', 'how', 'roommate', 'penniless', 'art', 'student', 'have', 'dollars', 'tech', 'equipment', 'degenerate', 'constantly', 'weaving', 'pattern', 'lies', 'deceptions', 'more', 'pointless', 'clever', 'merely', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'A', 'basically', 'good', 'premise', 'ruined', 'are', 'fan', 'stars', 'involved', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'viewing', 'only', 'once', 'film', 'whole', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'vile', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Perhaps', 'ultimate', 'message', 'film', 'dangers', 'spreading', 'GOSSIP', 'case', 'deliberate', 'lies', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'also', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'sick', 'stomach', 'almost', 'recommend', 'watch', 'first', '30-45', 'min', 'then', 'quit', 'midway', 'anyone', 'will', 'watch', 'way', 'thru', 'least', 'once', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'where', 'headed']",N/A
559075,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B00004YA67,the masked reviewer,"[1, 1]","It doesn't really matter who sleeps with whom in this sub-MELROSE PLACE college fantasy, GOSSIP is ludicrous trash, but it has style. Beautiful faces, beautiful clothes, deluxe interiors and lots of breaking glass - while its story makes no sense whatsoever. It'd be a perfect movie to watch while sloppy drunk or in between bong hits. Imagine a hysterically overwrought episode of FELICITY crossed with the hit-and-run Gen-X angst thriller BODY SHOTS and you more or less have the measure of this loopy Bad Movie delight about what happens when poisonous rumors take on a life of their own.It begins in a college journalism class, where a super-hip professor (professional ranteuse Eric Bogosian) is lecturing on the blurring of news and entertainment. Assigned to write a paper on the topic, three super-cool students - Lena Headey, James Marsden and Norman Reedus - decide to go the prof one better. They devise a project: They're going to start a virulent rumor and plot its spread through the student body. Headey comes up with the idea, but Marsden supplies the buzz -- he catches a glimpse of super-snotty, vociferously chaste fellow student Kate Hudson in a drunken swoon in the arms of her boyfriend, (Joshua Jackson). Marsden proposes that they concoct a story that Hudson was seen doing the nasty with Jackson, run it up the flagpole and see who salutes. To the trio's smug delight, everyone does, embellishing and spinning bizarre variations on the original. But within 24 hours the story has mutated into sordid accusations of date rape, Hudson is filing charges and Headey is having second thoughts about their little jaw-wagging joyride.Art-directed within an inch of its chichi life (does it come as any surprise that executive producer Joel Schumacher originally conceived it as a project for himself?), GOSSIP is so thoroughly preposterous on every level that the only way to enjoy it is to throw logic to the wind and groove on Marsden's cheekbones and the shelter-porn appeal of his super-swanky loft.Marsden is a rich-kid college student who's apparently paying the freight for his two best pals to room in his enormous duplex loft. We're in an unnamed city somewhere on the Eastern seaboard; a few clues are dropped to suggest it might be Manhattan. (Like almost every American movie in Hollywood's neo-cheapskate era, Gossip was actually filmed in Canada.) If so, one could guess Marsden's dad is the supreme potentate of an oil-exporting nation. Nobody in New York -- at least, nobody below about Marla Maples' level - lives in an apartment like this. (Marsden's inverted-funnel teakettle looks like it cost more than all the furniture in our early-'80s college household put together.)With his big, angular head and perennial sneer, Marsden is the poor man's Matt Damon while Headey's English-rose complexion, shaggy do and thrift-store queen costumes suggests Helena Bonham Carter (in her FIGHT CLUB trash-bag mode). Headey and Marsden are clearly in the film as design elements, and the camera lingers on them in long, honey-dipped closeups, serving as counterpoint to all the converted industrial interiors, flickering video screens and rain-swept city streets. The only reason to be interested in Marsden and Headey's will-they-or-won't-they dance is a desire to see one or both of them shirtless -  but all of this goes down as smoothly as that third cosmopolitan. ( It's not like you give a fig about any of the characters).One can only guess that Bogosian thought he could sneak a fat paycheck here, as a sanctimonious professor who delivers homilies about the difference between gossip and news, without the hipster fans of his solo-performance incarnation noticing. Joshua Jackson's role as Hudson's accused rapist could have been filled by anyone. Maybe Jackson caught a cab across Toronto from the set of THE SKULLS (another campus thriller that makes GOSSIP look like the second coming of VERTIGO). All we can say about the spectacle of worthy actors like Sharon Lawrence and Edward James Olmos playing tiny roles in this guilty-pleasure tripe is: Yikes.Maybe one of them got to keep Marden's teakettle.",5,Pretty People get Pretty Nasty in this Pretty Trashy Bad Movie We LOVE!,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,4140,"[""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'who', 'whom', 'sub-MELROSE', 'PLACE', 'college', 'fantasy', 'GOSSIP', 'ludicrous', 'trash', 'style', 'Beautiful', 'beautiful', 'clothes', 'deluxe', 'interiors', 'lots', 'breaking', 'glass', 'story', 'sense', 'whatsoever', ""'d"", 'be', 'perfect', 'movie', 'watch', 'sloppy', 'drunk', 'bong', 'hits', 'Imagine', 'hysterically', 'overwrought', 'episode', 'FELICITY', 'crossed', 'hit-and-run', 'Gen-X', 'angst', 'thriller', 'BODY', 'SHOTS', 'more', 'less', 'have', 'measure', 'loopy', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'delight', 'what', 'when', 'poisonous', 'rumors', 'take', 'life', 'own.It', 'college', 'journalism', 'class', 'where', 'super-hip', 'professor', 'professional', 'ranteuse', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'lecturing', 'blurring', 'news', 'entertainment', 'Assigned', 'write', 'paper', 'topic', 'three', 'super-cool', 'students', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'decide', 'go', 'prof', 'one', 'better', 'devise', 'project', ""'re"", 'going', 'start', 'virulent', 'rumor', 'plot', 'spread', 'student', 'body', 'Headey', 'up', 'idea', 'Marsden', 'buzz', 'glimpse', 'super-snotty', 'vociferously', 'chaste', 'fellow', 'student', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'drunken', 'swoon', 'arms', 'boyfriend', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Marsden', 'concoct', 'story', 'Hudson', 'was', 'seen', 'doing', 'nasty', 'Jackson', 'run', 'up', 'flagpole', 'see', 'who', 'trio', 'smug', 'delight', 'everyone', 'embellishing', 'spinning', 'bizarre', 'variations', 'original', '24', 'hours', 'story', 'mutated', 'sordid', 'accusations', 'date', 'rape', 'Hudson', 'filing', 'charges', 'Headey', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'little', 'jaw-wagging', 'joyride.Art-directed', 'inch', 'chichi', 'life', 'come', 'surprise', 'executive', 'producer', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'originally', 'conceived', 'project', 'GOSSIP', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'preposterous', 'level', 'only', 'way', 'enjoy', 'throw', 'logic', 'wind', 'groove', 'Marsden', 'cheekbones', 'shelter-porn', 'appeal', 'super-swanky', 'loft.Marsden', 'rich-kid', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'apparently', 'paying', 'freight', 'two', 'best', 'pals', 'room', 'enormous', 'duplex', 'loft', ""'re"", 'unnamed', 'city', 'somewhere', 'Eastern', 'seaboard', 'few', 'clues', 'are', 'dropped', 'suggest', 'might', 'be', 'Manhattan', 'almost', 'American', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'neo-cheapskate', 'era', 'Gossip', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'so', 'one', 'could', 'guess', 'Marsden', 'dad', 'supreme', 'potentate', 'oil-exporting', 'nation', 'Nobody', 'New', 'York', 'least', 'nobody', 'Marla', 'Maples', 'level', 'lives', 'apartment', 'Marsden', 'inverted-funnel', 'teakettle', 'looks', 'cost', 'more', 'furniture', ""early-'80s"", 'college', 'household', 'put', 'together', 'big', 'angular', 'head', 'perennial', 'sneer', 'Marsden', 'poor', 'man', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Headey', 'English-rose', 'complexion', 'shaggy', 'do', 'thrift-store', 'queen', 'costumes', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'trash-bag', 'mode', 'Headey', 'Marsden', 'are', 'clearly', 'film', 'design', 'elements', 'camera', 'long', 'honey-dipped', 'closeups', 'serving', 'counterpoint', 'converted', 'industrial', 'interiors', 'flickering', 'video', 'screens', 'rain-swept', 'city', 'streets', 'only', 'reason', 'be', 'interested', 'Marsden', 'Headey', ""will-they-or-won't-they"", 'dance', 'desire', 'see', 'one', 'shirtless', 'down', 'as', 'smoothly', 'third', 'cosmopolitan', 'not', 'give', 'fig', 'characters', '.One', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Bogosian', 'thought', 'could', 'sneak', 'fat', 'paycheck', 'here', 'sanctimonious', 'professor', 'who', 'homilies', 'difference', 'gossip', 'news', 'hipster', 'fans', 'solo-performance', 'incarnation', 'noticing', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'role', 'Hudson', 'accused', 'rapist', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'anyone', 'Maybe', 'Jackson', 'caught', 'cab', 'Toronto', 'set', 'THE', 'SKULLS', 'campus', 'thriller', 'GOSSIP', 'look', 'second', 'coming', 'VERTIGO', 'can', 'say', 'spectacle', 'worthy', 'actors', 'Sharon', 'Lawrence', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'playing', 'tiny', 'roles', 'guilty-pleasure', 'tripe', 'Yikes.Maybe', 'one', 'got', 'keep', 'Marden', 'teakettle']",N/A
