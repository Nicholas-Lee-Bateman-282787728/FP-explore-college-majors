But in London's West End, where she originated many of the roles in Andrew Lloyd Webber's productions, she's a huge star. When a lot of ALW's shows transferred to the US, Paige stayed on and an American actress took over the role. Think Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Sunset Boulevard. She is probably best known in the US from appearing in Chess and Cats.Its been 40 years since she first stepped on a West End stage - a last-minute fill-in for a lead role in Hair. And to celebrate those 40 years she presented a concert - not in London, but at the State Theater in Sidney, Australia. The 1- hour long show consists of more than her hits. For some reason she sings ""Tomorrow"" from Annie, a show she didn't appear in, and later ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miz, the role she turned down to take a role in Chess instead! There is also some ""special material"" written for her about her vertically challenged frame (she's admittedly short) and the oddball song """"Shoot The Breeze"" which was written by her friends Dustin Hoffman and Bette Midler (yes, they write songs). The ""Hits"" are here too - songs from Sweeney Todd, Evita, Piaf, Chess, Sunset Boulevard.  And she still sounds great after 40 years.The bonuses on the DVD include one outtake (""Grow Young"") and a 33-minute interview. The interview is not all talk. Paige usually repeats a story you heard during the concert and parts of the concert performance as blended into the interview so its fairly repetitive.Paige fans - and I know there are many of them - will want this DVD for their collection. Theater fans in the US will enjoy hearing her perform her versions of songs sung by others on Broadway and hearing what the original lead actress sounded like when the shows premiered in London.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"The official title is ""Elaine Page: Celebrating 40 Years on Stage""",1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1883,"['Elaine', 'Paige', 'name', 'not', 'household', 'word', 'US', 'played', 'many', 'roles', 'Broadway', 'London', 'West', 'End', 'where', 'originated', 'many', 'roles', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'productions', 'huge', 'star', 'When', 'lot', 'ALW', 'shows', 'transferred', 'US', 'Paige', 'stayed', 'American', 'actress', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'Think', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Evita', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'US', 'appearing', 'Chess', 'Cats.Its', 'been', '40', 'years', 'first', 'stepped', 'West', 'End', 'stage', 'last-minute', 'fill-in', 'lead', 'role', 'Hair', 'celebrate', '40', 'years', 'presented', 'concert', 'not', 'London', 'State', 'Theater', 'Sidney', 'Australia', '1-', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'more', 'hits', 'reason', 'Tomorrow', 'Annie', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'later', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'Les', 'Miz', 'role', 'turned', 'down', 'take', 'role', 'Chess', 'instead', 'also', 'special', 'material', 'written', 'vertically', 'challenged', 'frame', 'admittedly', 'short', 'oddball', 'song', 'Shoot', 'Breeze', 'was', 'written', 'friends', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'yes', 'write', 'songs', 'Hits', 'are', 'here', 'too', 'songs', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Evita', 'Piaf', 'Chess', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'still', 'great', '40', 'years.The', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'include', 'one', 'outtake', 'Grow', 'Young', '33-minute', 'interview', 'interview', 'not', 'talk', 'Paige', 'usually', 'story', 'heard', 'concert', 'parts', 'concert', 'performance', 'blended', 'interview', 'fairly', 'repetitive.Paige', 'fans', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'will', 'want', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Theater', 'fans', 'US', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'perform', 'versions', 'songs', 'sung', 'others', 'Broadway', 'hearing', 'what', 'original', 'lead', 'actress', 'sounded', 'when', 'shows', 'premiered', 'London.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Elaine Paige Live

She is always true to the lyrics of whatever she is singing. The song is always more important to Ms Paige than whether she proves to us or not that she can belt.  This is so important and many singers miss this mark.She has been a ""star"" for forty years and the professionalism she has gained over those years is evident.Everything she sings, she knocks out of the ballpark and, frankly, once she sings it, a song belongs to her.She is every bit as good an actress (if not better) as she is a singer.
