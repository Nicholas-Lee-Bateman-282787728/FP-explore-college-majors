But what started like a crude and laughable grotesque suddenly turned into a serious and emotional drama.  I believe it's done not without Ingmar Berman's influence, as it deals with Bergman's favorite themes - love, sex and death, but for the former it's more graphic that the master would ever go for.  However, in our times these scenes don't show as shocking at all, although one can only imagine what an upheaval they must have caused back in seventies.  I would recommend this film to serious viewers only, it's definitely not about light entertainment but rather about profound issues of artistic expression, love and death.  I also think that in its graphical approach it is very North European, and comes in a sharp contrast with Italian cinema, for example.",4,Unexpectedly good,1008979200,"12 22, 2001",2001,874,"['bought', 'film', 'mostly', 'scandalous', 'reputation', 'could', 'form', 'personal', 'opinion', 'what', 'started', 'crude', 'laughable', 'grotesque', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'serious', 'emotional', 'drama', 'believe', 'done', 'not', 'Ingmar', 'Berman', 'influence', 'Bergman', 'favorite', 'themes', 'love', 'sex', 'death', 'former', 'more', 'graphic', 'master', 'would', 'ever', 'go', 'However', 'times', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'shocking', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'upheaval', 'must', 'have', 'caused', 'back', 'seventies', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'serious', 'viewers', 'only', 'definitely', 'not', 'light', 'entertainment', 'rather', 'profound', 'issues', 'artistic', 'expression', 'love', 'death', 'also', 'think', 'graphical', 'approach', 'very', 'North', 'European', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'example']",Turkish Delight

The sculptor accepts no boundaries for his appetites and takes an impish delight in upsetting the norm, but his love and kindness are boundless as well. His young bride is alternately captivated and rebellious, as his consuming passions leave no room for other plans, and sudden blackouts leave her confused and angry. The film, more than anything else, is about an uncompromising man who will not bow to fate, propriety, or to maudlin sentimentality but still loves more faithfully than most. Verhoeven does an excellent job defining the artist's moods and the loving relationship in flashbacks and with a singular angry fantasy that brackets much of the story.

There was a scene in it where Rutger Hauer says he's better than Jesus ( in the bedroom ) but come the second half of the movie, the film is ultra depressing and you'd have to have a heart made of stone not to be a little emotional. The thing is is that it feels so real what's going on that it's hard remembering that it's only a film. For weeks I couldn't get this out of my head and even now I'm a little reluctant to put it back in because the film although I haven't seen it since I bought it but there are parts in the film I can remember too well. When Erik ( Hauer ) brings home another girl that was prime for the bed there's the statue of Olga ( the amazingly beautiful Monique Van de Ven ) and for a split second Hauer thinks he sees Olga in the flesh until the girl turns the light on and sees that it was just the statue. It's enough to turn off Erik's passion for sex in an instant. It's truly chilling when you see it again ( OK I admit I tried watching it again but just couldn't after I saw that scene )The love that Erik has for Olga is beyond intense. He's so obsessed that he cannot bear to see her with another man. And like Erik this is the sort of film that transcends that message across to the viewer. Some relationships that have broken up can still have the "" we can still be friends "" and can happily go on but for the others they may not want to go through the pain again knowing the things they know. It's my opinion that in some respects this movie could also leave you ending up one or the other",5,Thoroughly depressing,1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,1647,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'start', 'made', '..do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'did', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'better', 'Jesus', 'bedroom', 'come', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'film', 'ultra', 'depressing', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'heart', 'made', 'stone', 'not', 'be', 'little', 'emotional', 'thing', 'so', 'real', 'what', 'going', 'hard', 'remembering', 'only', 'film', 'weeks', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'head', 'even', 'now', ""'m"", 'little', 'reluctant', 'put', 'back', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'bought', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'too', 'well', 'When', 'Erik', 'Hauer', 'home', 'girl', 'was', 'prime', 'bed', 'statue', 'Olga', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'Monique', 'Van', 'Ven', 'split', 'second', 'Hauer', 'Olga', 'flesh', 'girl', 'light', 'sees', 'was', 'just', 'statue', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'Erik', 'passion', 'sex', 'instant', 'truly', 'chilling', 'when', 'see', 'again', 'OK', 'admit', 'tried', 'watching', 'again', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'saw', 'scene', 'love', 'Erik', 'Olga', 'intense', 'so', 'obsessed', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'see', 'man', 'Erik', 'sort', 'film', 'message', 'viewer', 'relationships', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'friends', 'can', 'happily', 'go', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'pain', 'again', 'knowing', 'things', 'know', 'opinion', 'respects', 'movie', 'could', 'also', 'leave', 'ending', 'up', 'one', 'other']",Turkish Delight
486163,A2BPDFR58H9575,6305973075,Galina,"[6, 6]","Few days ago, I watched the documentary ""Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession"" (2004) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100, 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary, I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well, I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch, very erotic - in the raw, brutal, twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching ""Z Channel..."" I was happy to instantly recognize ""Turks fruit"" (1973) aka ""Turkish Delight"" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix, the movie was available; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well - Verhoeven's early film is as naturalistic, earthy, brutal, erotic, humorous, poetic, poignant, and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker, ""Turkish Delight"" stars young, hot, very sexy (and I mean it - VERY SEXY) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga, child-like yet as sensual as Eric was, ""the light of his life, the fire of his loins"". The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a ""75% masterpiece"".There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven (of his Dutch period, especially). Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work, fiery temperament, and aggressive movie-making. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him: ""The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..."" ""The Turkish Delight"" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality, more than one disgusting and revolting scenes (but they had to be in the movie) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers.

Booker,"[1, 1]","Of all Verhoeven's Dutch films before he came to America and made such classics as Robocop, Basic Instinct, and Total Recall, this film is among my favorite of his along with Katie Tippel and The Fourth Man.Turkish Delight is an ambiguous title for this film since the film can be best described as the bittersweet dream of a rebelious sculptor's discovery of perfection in a young vivacious redhead (Monique van de ven) and inevitable discovery that not all things are what they seem to be on the surface. The initial scenes of the film are brutal, culminating in a horrible crime, then in flashback, we are taken through the events that lead up to the crime so as to understand its motivation and ultimately its perpetrator.This is a very entertaining film and an excellent primer for those unfamiliar with foreign films. Very funny at times, though often raunchy, and, as common in Verhoeven's Dutch film offerings, there are no special efforts to cover up male and female private areas.

486166,A3K5IMGDCDBCNF,6305973075,"""lecorel@hotmail.com""","[5, 5]","Wow! When Paul Verhoeven is on, he is really on. This film has one of those openings. Fantastic, sucks you right in, and then you find out what the film is really about. From what has been previously written about this film, suprisingly, it was not what I expected. In a film that opens with extreme violence and sex (Verhoeven staples) it quickly evolves into an interesting and insightful character study on love and death.Eric (Rutger Hauer) is a sculpter who lives impulsively and freely until one day, on one of his impulsive adventures, he meets Olga (Monique van de Ven). It takes Eric about a minute to ""convince"" Olga that he loves her and their meeting ends with a bang, literally (I don't want to give too much away). There relationship goes through the normal ups and downs, oh, and there's plenty of ""affection"" in the relationship. The film takes some unexpected twists and turns and there are several bizarre scenes involving Olga's mother (she was great) and her family which culminate in an unusual (if not unpredictable) ending.This film scores on many levels. The acting, the story, and the cinematography are all top notch. Rutger Hauer's character is especially engaging (I love how he molds trash into art) and he turns in one of the best performances of his career. What really sets Turkish Delight apart from other films though is Verhoeven's willingness to go to the extreme. The graphicness of his films (i.e. violence, sex) is something he has fought the censors and the critics on his whole career. But with good reason, it makes his films more interesting and it sets them apart from conventional cinema. He wants to show it all, and while some of his American films may have been graphic or risque, they are tame compared to Turkish Delight. He held nothing back as a filmmaker on this one.I can understand why this film ruffled some feathers when it was released in 1973. Somewhere around this time Pauline Kael was writing her famous article for the New Yorker exclaiming Last Tango in Paris as a revolutionary film and Turkish Delight would certainly fall into the same catagory as it. However I think it is even more provocative (in terms of the sex scenes) than Last Tango.

486169,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305973075,Reviewer,"[11, 16]","There are many ways in which love and passion can be manifested in a relationship, but if it is to prevail, it is essential that both sides complement one another, physically, emotionally and psychologically; the feelings borne on the wings of romance must above all else be mutual and deeply instilled on both sides.  When they are not, the end result must necessarily be estrangement; it is a law-- not of man, but of nature.  In ""Turkish Delight,"" director Paul Verhoeven dissects a relationship born of passion, examines the ramifications of the attitudes and actions of the individuals involved-- as well as the couple they become-- and offers the results to his audience for consideration.  Is it, though, a story of love and passion?  Yes.  But it comes via a route more analogous to the sensibilities of David Cronenberg than Ang Lee; it is decidedly more Craven than Capra.  So don't come to this film expecting tender moments; instead, prepare yourself for an offering that is provocative, that is sexually explicit, and finally, graphic in it's more violent moments.  This is a film for neither the fainthearted nor the modest, but for the discerning viewer only.In the first few minutes of this film, we are introduced to Eric Vonk (Rutger Hauer), an artist with a passion for his work, but even more so for experiences that lean more toward the wanton and carnal in aspect.  We instantly become voyeurs as he proceeds to overindulge in a series of lusty encounters, an extreme display of irresponsible debauchery that cannot but impel a most unpropitious and subjective first impression on behalf of the viewer, who is forced to bear witness to a man of obvious and insatiable appetites and a tentative moral code.  Or so it would seem, initially.As the story unfolds, however, we begin to understand Eric and what it is that compels him thus; and it begins with a photograph of a beautiful young woman named Olga (Monique van de Ven), the woman with whom Eric once shared his life, love, passion and, yes, his lust.  It is obvious from the outset that she is no longer with him, which evokes the question that has to be asked:  ""Why?""  And from that inauspicious beginning, a picture emerges that may not be pretty, and is, in fact, fairly disconcerting.  By the end of the film, though, all questions pertaining to Eric Vonk and the mysterious Olga have been answered.  The screen grows dark then; but the images to which the viewer has just been made privy are ones that are going to remain in the mind's eye for some time afterwards.Working from a screenplay by Gerard Soeteman (adapted from the novel by Jan Wolkers), Verhoeven establishes himself as the antithesis of Nora Ephron, presenting his ""love"" story in terms that are decidedly raw and primitive.  Though he does manage to establish the fact that Eric does have deep love for Olga, it is lust that seemingly dominates the picture, and though there is a dramatic twist to the story, it all comes across more like a twisted fairy tale than anything else.  Verhoeven uses violence to express the same sentiments Ephron, for example, does through compassion and empathy.  But that is his style.  It's his prerogative; it's his turf; it's his film.  And Verhoeven as much as says to his audience that if you don't like it, you can leave.  It's not as if he doesn't have respect for his viewer, though; rather, it seems as if it's something he simply has not considered.If you can get past the baggage with which Verhoeven inexplicably saddles his own film, there is an interesting, if not riveting, story to be found.  But, like Cronenberg's affinity for slime and things that ooze, Verhoeven apparently cannot escape his affinity for violence, even when it works to his detriment.  In the case of this film, it results in certain scenes that are too avant-garde to be effective within the context of the overall film.  These are scenes in which Eric is hallucinating or day dreaming about particular aspects of his relationship with Olga.  They are abrupt insertions into the narrative that simply do not mesh with the flow of the film.  The seam left by the weave, as it were, is just too apparent.  Beyond the shock value (which is minimum), it just doesn't work.On the positive side, Verhoeven does extract worthy performances from his stars, Hauer and van de Ven.  Hauer, in his feature film debut (and at this point some eight years away from his American film debut in ""Nighthawks"") displays a natural ability in front of the camera and seems comfortably uninhibited, which enables him to use his rugged good looks to the best advantage.  Eric is a complex character of single minded intent, which Hauer conveys quite ably in his performance.  Van de Ven also makes her motion picture debut here, and beyond her obvious beauty there is a definite indication of the talent that would soon bring her international acclaim (though her star has yet to rise above the American landscape).  Her portrayal of Olga is convincing, and her myriad charms are neither misplaced nor misused by Verhoeven here.  And commendably, she manages to transcend the mere use of her physical attributes and create a memorable character with a truly affecting performance.The supporting cast includes Tonny Huurdeman (Moeder), Wim van den Brink (Vader) and Dolf de Vries (Paul).  This film is definitely not for everyone; it fails as entertainment, but succeeds as an examination of the extremes to which we, as humans, are susceptible.  ""Turkish Delight,"" then, will be received in any number of different ways.  Some will be shocked and appalled by what they see on the screen; others will be offended.  And still others will understand that what is depicted here is a very real reflection of things that go on in a very real world, as interpreted by Paul Verhoeven.",3,"A ""Verhoeven"" Expression of
