They both brought life to a woman that many of us new only as a celebrity.  This is the best movie on a real person's life that helps you connect with the real person.  If you are interested on her life as a child up to the time of her death then this movie is for you.

Well, first  of all, she lived until she was 63, she divorced Mel Ferrer, got remarried  and divorced, and &quot;shacked up&quot; with another man for the final 13  years of her life.  She struggled to have a child.  Her 2nd husband was  unfaithful.  She had little contact with her father.  She didn't do much of  the singing in &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  She suffered during the 2nd World  War.  This movie, if it was REALLY telling the TRUE  Audrey Hepburn story,  would have chronicled all this in greater detail.  Yes, Hepburn was a great  actress who became a cherished icon.  Yes, she was a fine human being whose  tireless work for UNICEF brought her much praise and attention to the  forgotten children of this world, but she was a human being too with  struggles not unlike what we &quot;mere mortals&quot; have to endure.

The thought of anyone trying to portray Audrey seemed wrong to me... even the beautiful Ms. Hewitt.  I gave it a shot, though, and was pleasantly surprised.Hewitt pulled of the part as well as anyone possibly could and that's a  huge compliment considering her subject.  She looked stunning in the roll.  I'll admit that her accent wasn't dead on, but it passed well.  If nothing  else, she captured the fun that was attributed to Audrey.Quite a few  people have critisized the movie and her roll.  I honestly feel that the  reason for this is because they're so used to watching Audrey that they  expect that someone portraying her can be as charming, elegant, and  beautiful as Audrey herself.

There are many actresses that hold some of her qualities, but never all of them. Certainly not Jennifer Love  Hewitt.Speaking of the ""leading lady"", it's a sad tale about how she won  the role of Audrey in this film. You see, the young actress fancies herself  to be an Audrey for the ages, but even she knows it's not true, so she  bought the rights to the movie, produced it and cast herself as Audrey. She  is no Audrey Hepburn.Where Audrey always was always so unsure of her  looks, Hewitt takes the `character' and makes her devoid of that emotion.  Other qualities of Audrey lack as well. Hewitt should stick with those TV  series for FOX; although they'll still fail, they won't be as bad as this  movie.Another alteration for Hewitt's casting was the  flashback-from-Breakfast-At-Tiffany's situation. That stunt painted over  some of her finest work, including the fabulous `Wait Until Dark' and  tosses it into a small paragraph at the end.You may think I am being a  harsh judge, but worse criticisms have been uttered. Audrey Hepburn, quite  possibly the greatest actress to ever work in Hollywood, should never be  handled with such, for lack of a btter word, stupidity.

Lively,"[4, 5]","I wondered when I watched this movie why anyone who had the reckless incomprehensible desire to produce a biopic on Audrey Hepburn would have cast Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role.  Then I saw that she was the producer.If I were trying to be ugly, I'd say that Ms. Hewitt's portrayal amounts to a cheap knockoff of the completely unique Audrey, but that's not really true.  It was more like one of those expensive Hollywood star dolls put out by The Franklin Mint. The clothes and pose are close but the indefinable essence is missing particularly from the face, which is vacant and doll-like bearing little resemblance to the real thing.This movie had one of Audrey Hepburn's swains say something like, ""Just let us look at you.""  And it was true that Audrey Hepburn was something to look at, but the most vital part of her considerable charm was the fact that she was looking back, engaged, interested, fearless, which is why she did well as characters with questing spirits like Holly Golightly, and like Sister Luke and even Princess Ann.  She made you feel the absolute need she had to connect with the world and other people.Ms. Hewitt would have done well to try and capture that essence rather than busy herself with copying the Hepburn mannerisms and accent rather poorly.  The one time she comes close to the spirit that was Audrey Hepburn is in the scene where an older actress is trying to help her line readings for the part of Gigi on Broadway.  For one brief, all too brief moment you felt the character's eagerness to learn, her satisfaction and joy at having mastered something difficult.  And I thought, ""Yes, it could have happened like that.""I don't know who directed Ms. Hewitt, but she was not well served.

The daughter of a baroness, Hepburn's family is reduced to refugee status by the end of WWII, her father missing and presumed dead.  Though living below their station, the Hepburn's are generally sunny about their existence.  Audrey makes friends easily, but is a failure as a ballerina.  She can't sing or dance, and when she gets her first major gig as Gigi, she can't even act.  By then, the script settles on Hepburn's charm as her greatest asset.  Never having seen Hepburn act, Collette is nevertheless sold on her stage presence.  Actors and directors fawn over her, none knowing of her insecurities or a desire for a future involving a stable family life.  Though her star rises further, Hepburn struggles to find that sense of security - eluding her in various misfired or purposelessly sabotaged romances (including one with James Hansen, heir to a fortune and founder of Hansen PLC; also William Holden from ""Sabrina"").  She turns typically to her mother, who happily enough is a supportive parent - aren't parents normally saddled with the blame in these biopics?  Famous names and faces cross Audrey's path, but the story makes her the center of attention everywhere - it seems that there's nobody who can resist her charm.  The story climaxes with the ""Hollywood Ending"" final scene of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", hinting to us that Hepburn finally found her emotional center.  (The story doesn't go as far as having an older Hepburn star as the elderly Maid Marian, mourning with Sean Connery over their lost love; nor must we endure Love Hewitt grappling in the dark with Alan Arkin from ""Wait until dark"".)Love Hewitt manages to sound a lot like Hepburn, but her likeness seems as plagued as those of the other celebrity stand-ins.  The makers of this biopic seem painfully aware of how delicate the likenesses are, and they do little to shake up their characters for fear of threatening the resemblance too much.  Hewitt's mannerisms seem unconsciously jerky - unlike Hepburn's grace.  It's not quite a cutting bio; though perhaps Hepburn doesn't deserve that treatment, a better tribute may just be to kick back with one of her movies.  My favorite?

I have to say setting aside Hewitt's unfortunate attempt at Hepburn's accent and less than realistic acting, the film at least delved into lesser known areas of her life such as her early hopes of being a ballerina, her time during the war, and her very early career.  Yes, the film stops at ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" arguable her most famous role, leaving my favorites untouched (My Fair Lady most notably).  However, it does show how she was inspired to start working with humanitarian efforts, eventually leaving acting to work tirelessly with UNICEF.[I would have to say, Emmy Rossum (the actress who portrayed Audrey from 12 - 16) was by far a better actress than JLH.  I saw her in Day After Tommorrow and it took me a while to figure out where I had seen her before and then realized it was from this movie.

I would guess if you enjoy mainstream romance then you'd enjoy this story, because it has a bit of everything... and of course regardless of whether romance was in the movie there would still be a story there.Those who are really specific about every detail of Audrey Hepburn's life will probably be disappointed. Die-hard Hepburn fans will probably walk away with more to dislike than to like. Although, I personally think Hepburn was a fairly good actress, I would have to personally say that Jennifer Love Hewitt sparkled as Hepburn more than I ever personally felt concerning the real Hepburn herself. I think what Hewitt and Hepburn really share in common is that they are both very adorable women. They both sparkled in their own way.I don't personally agree with others who say they didn't look anything alike. I don't think they had huge resemblances but I do think they do resemble each other in less obvious ways. After seeing Hewitt in the film, I didn't think her acting was bad at all (as said by other reviewers)--personally after seeing the film, I felt that if she took more adult roles her talent would be much better appreciated.I think that Hewitt may receive some harsh reviews because a lot of people are simply used to seeing her in less mature movies, but I think if she were to portray more adult roles as in this film, she would eventually earn the respect she deserves. I think many teen movies underplay her talent to be honest.Other reviewers have said Natalie Portman would've been a better choice. I'm not sure I agree. Natalie Portman is talented and I can see resemblances to Hepburn, but I think Hewitt has a magic and charm that Portman doesn't have quite the same way.Hewitt comes alive beyond the film and you really believe she's Hepburn. However, die-hard fans may not be convinced that she is, but those who are less critical will probably enjoy the film and enjoy her portrayal.I think they did make the right choice to cast Jennifer Love Hewitt. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the type of person that you can look at and really tell she's alive and she just has an energy that bounces off the walls. I think they casted her as Audrey because she had the same energy and magic that Audrey has (inner magnetism). I believe they saw that.I don't think you have to look exactly like Audrey to pretend to be her. Other reviewers have questioned why she was casted because she didn't look like Audrey, but clearly there are countless movies in which actors/actresses didn't look exactly like the real people, but they were casted as the character for other reasons and perhaps they resembled the character at least a little. I think reviewers are having trouble with this simply because Audrey Hepburn was famous.""Erin Brockovich"" is a good example. Julia Roberts didn't look anything like ""Erin Brockovich,"" but she was cast as her. And Diane Lane who plays Frances Mayes in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" doesn't look a thing like the real writer (Frances Mayes). Looks don't mean believability. It doesn't mean just because an actor/actress looks like that person they should be casted to play that part. It helps but it's not always enough. It also doesn't mean because the person looks like that real person you'll necessarily believe they are that person, and it doesn't mean because they don't look like that person that you'll believe they aren't that person. That's why it's called acting. A large portion of it is a matter of illusion.I personally think Jennifer Love Hewitt created a very good illusion as Audrey Hepburn.",5,"Hey, it's entertainment!",1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,3762,"['movie', 'intimate', 'portrayal', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'life', 'may', 'appeal', 'more', 'who', 'enjoy', 'fiction', 'rather', 'who', 'are', 'highly', 'critical', 'concerning', 'exact', 'details', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'life', 'would', 'guess', 'enjoy', 'mainstream', 'romance', 'then', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'bit', 'everything', 'course', 'regardless', 'romance', 'was', 'movie', 'there', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'story', 'there.Those', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'specific', 'detail', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'life', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Die-hard', 'Hepburn', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'walk', 'away', 'more', 'dislike', 'like', 'personally', 'think', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'personally', 'say', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'sparkled', 'Hepburn', 'more', 'ever', 'personally', 'felt', 'concerning', 'real', 'Hepburn', 'think', 'what', 'Hewitt', 'Hepburn', 'really', 'share', 'common', 'are', 'very', 'adorable', 'women', 'sparkled', 'own', 'way.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'alike', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'huge', 'resemblances', 'do', 'think', 'do', 'resemble', 'other', 'less', 'obvious', 'ways', 'seeing', 'Hewitt', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'said', 'other', 'reviewers', 'personally', 'seeing', 'film', 'felt', 'took', 'more', 'adult', 'talent', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'appreciated.I', 'think', 'Hewitt', 'may', 'receive', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'simply', 'used', 'seeing', 'less', 'mature', 'movies', 'think', 'were', 'portray', 'more', 'adult', 'roles', 'film', 'would', 'eventually', 'earn', 'respect', 'think', 'many', 'teen', 'movies', 'underplay', 'talent', 'be', 'honest.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'choice', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'talented', 'can', 'see', 'resemblances', 'Hepburn', 'think', 'Hewitt', 'magic', 'charm', 'Portman', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'way.Hewitt', 'alive', 'film', 'really', 'believe', 'Hepburn', 'However', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'convinced', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'critical', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'enjoy', 'portrayal.I', 'think', 'did', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'type', 'person', 'can', 'look', 'really', 'tell', 'alive', 'just', 'energy', 'walls', 'think', 'casted', 'Audrey', 'had', 'same', 'energy', 'magic', 'Audrey', 'inner', 'magnetism', 'believe', 'saw', 'that.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'look', 'exactly', 'Audrey', 'pretend', 'be', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'questioned', 'why', 'was', 'casted', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Audrey', 'clearly', 'are', 'countless', 'movies', 'actors/actresses', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'exactly', 'real', 'people', 'were', 'casted', 'character', 'other', 'reasons', 'perhaps', 'resembled', 'character', 'least', 'little', 'think', 'reviewers', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'simply', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'famous', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'good', 'example', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'was', 'cast', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', ""n't"", 'look', 'thing', 'real', 'writer', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'Looks', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'believability', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'actor/actress', 'looks', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'casted', 'play', 'part', 'not', 'always', 'enough', 'also', ""n't"", 'mean', 'person', 'real', 'person', ""'ll"", 'necessarily', 'believe', 'are', 'person', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'person', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'person', 'why', 'called', 'acting', 'large', 'portion', 'matter', 'illusion.I', 'personally', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'created', 'very', 'good', 'illusion', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn']",The Audrey Hepburn Story VHS

Jennifer Love Hewitt, who plays Miss Hepburn, resembles her somewhat, yet I do believe her acting could've been a bit better. The main thing I do not like about this film biography is that it doesn't contain ALL of Miss Hepburn's life. It starts with her on the set of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) and then goes back and forth through her past and up through her early life, her beginning years in show business, and her breakthrough as a Hollywood mega-star. However, the film doesn't go passed 1961. At the end, the film is still set on the ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" set in 1961, and doesn't even show her later life, her social activism, and her death. It does, however, mention her films after 1961 and her death, but this it! THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!!!!! The feature spends WAY TOO MUCH TIME (in my opinion) on her early life. Don't get me wrong, it is interesting about Hepburn's early life, but her Hollywood limelight career is MORE INTERESTING and MORE BELIEVABLE!!!! If you are a HUGH Hepburn fan, I suggest you search for bigger and better Biographies on her, but if you are just interested in learner more about her, I believe this could be a good piece of Hepburn-inspired to see.",3,"Is it up-to Audrey's standards?

Or she just isn't that bright. It is sure to be the greatest mistake of her career. It is noticeable how much effort she puts into portraying Audrey, but she does it void of emotion. And as if Audrey Hepburn was only a paperdoll. Not a woman with a real story to tell.Audrey Hepburn was admired for much more than her looks and talents. She was a woman who suffered and survived many things! She was courageous, intelligent, generous, the list goes on and on! Hewitt's performance reflects NONE of this. It takes more than doe eyes.Hewitt needs to stick to fluffy teen movies and Neutrogena commercials until she matures as an actress. I did not find her looks or mannerisms to reflect Audrey's very much, but more because Hewitt was obviously trying so hard, it did not seem to come natural at all. Maybe if she wasn't such an obvious wanna-be and had relaxed, she would have done a better job?Many people say, well *who* could have portrayed Audrey and my answer is (I am sure I will get flamed for saying this), I would have much rather seen Julia Ormond in this role. I know she wasn't supposed to be portraying AUDREY HEPBURN in her role as Sabrina (the remake with Harrison Ford), and  at the time her performance was so reminiscent of Audrey that it irritated me - BUT after seeing THIS horrible &quot;movie&quot; with JLH it made me appreciate Julia Ormond so much much more! I think she would have done a splendid job. Ormond really captures Audrey Hepburns softness and warmth of character and heart. Also, I agree with the previous review that suggested Natalie Portman. Perhaps Natalie Portman as a young Audrey Hepburn and Julia Ormond as a mature Audrey Hepburn? Can we please reshoot this film?Jennifer Love Hewitt showed us her stuggle which was a distraction to the story. Poorly produced and researched as well - you miss out on so much. You are much better off buying the A&amp;E Biography tape (much better than the Hollywood Collection, Audrey Remembered) and reading Alexander Walker's biography on Audrey Hepburn.It would have been refreshing and enjoyable to see a story based on Audrey Hepburns life, not documentary style and maybe some day we will. However, this movie is not worth the buy and not worth the watch, unless you are curious to see just how bad a job Hewitt did. I'm really not trying to just slam JLH, I happened to like her on Party of Five.",1,sickening attempt to capture the soul of a true film icon,977184000,"12 19, 2000",2000,2519,"['Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'certainly', 'lot', 'courage', 'take', 'role', 'had', 'know', 'would', 'bring', 'more', 'criticism', 'acclaim', 'just', ""n't"", 'bright', 'sure', 'be', 'greatest', 'mistake', 'career', 'noticeable', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'portraying', 'Audrey', 'void', 'emotion', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'only', 'paperdoll', 'Not', 'woman', 'real', 'story', 'tell.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'admired', 'much', 'more', 'looks', 'talents', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'suffered', 'survived', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'courageous', 'intelligent', 'generous', 'list', 'Hewitt', 'performance', 'NONE', 'more', 'doe', 'eyes.Hewitt', 'needs', 'stick', 'fluffy', 'teen', 'movies', 'Neutrogena', 'commercials', 'actress', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'reflect', 'Audrey', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'Hewitt', 'was', 'obviously', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'come', 'natural', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'obvious', 'wanna-be', 'had', 'relaxed', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'well', '*who*', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Audrey', 'answer', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'get', 'flamed', 'saying', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'role', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'AUDREY', 'HEPBURN', 'role', 'Sabrina', 'remake', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'time', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'Audrey', 'irritated', 'BUT', 'seeing', 'THIS', 'horrible', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'JLH', 'made', 'appreciate', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'so', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'splendid', 'job', 'Ormond', 'really', 'Audrey', 'Hepburns', 'softness', 'warmth', 'character', 'heart', 'Also', 'agree', 'previous', 'review', 'suggested', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Perhaps', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'young', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'mature', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Can', 'please', 'reshoot', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'showed', 'stuggle', 'was', 'distraction', 'story', 'Poorly', 'produced', 'researched', 'as', 'well', 'miss', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'Biography', 'tape', 'much', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'Collection', 'Audrey', 'Remembered', 'reading', 'Alexander', 'Walker', 'biography', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'refreshing', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'story', 'based', 'Audrey', 'Hepburns', 'life', 'not', 'documentary', 'style', 'maybe', 'day', 'will', 'However', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'buy', 'not', 'watch', 'are', 'curious', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'job', 'Hewitt', 'did', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'trying', 'just', 'slam', 'JLH', 'happened', 'like', 'Party', 'Five']",The Audrey Hepburn Story VHS
549808,A3TPRIFSQVXY5H,B00004STRA,"William Neely ""Will""","[1, 3]","In my opinion, this is one of the best films of 2000. It is about the life of Audrey Hepburn...that is the only way to describe the premise! It takes place during the making of ""Breakfast at Tiffani's,"" and builds itself up be showing flashbacks of Audrey's life. The movie is amazing quality...and everything about it is enjoyable. You do not have to be an Audrey Hepburn fan to enjoy this movie! It is just a film that can be enjoyed by anyone. The acting in this film is wonderful, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt. She does an amazing job here, and I am a huge fan of hers. The other actresses that play young Audrey are great as well. The actress that plays Audrey's mom is one of the best (she also played Rose's mom in Titanic). Eric McCormack (from Will and Grace) also appears here, and does a fine job. This film has many different elements to it that make it what it is. You go through the happy moments with Audrey, and it makes you happy, but then there are the sad moments that make you sad! If you are an Audrey fan, please go into this with an open mind, and you will like it! You can not expect to see Audrey because if you do, you will not enjoy this film.
