Unfortunately for the average American moviegoer, this is a flick too loaded with subtleties and hidden clues to appeal to someone who's used to more explosions, shootouts, and decisive final confrontations. You must pay close attention to every line of dialogue in order to keep up, and in this the average viewer is going to lose interest. Which is a pity, as you are kept guessing throughout --it's presented in such a way as to enable you to see the point of view of almost every character. Snipes and Connery work extremely well off each other, Harvey Keitel plods through his usual role, Cary Tagawa shines as the unfortunate fall guy stuck between East and West, Tia Carrere proves that she's MUCH more than mere 'Wayne's World' eye candy, and the film's few deviations from the novel do not detract from the suspense --they actually help to keep the plot moving.Don't believe the reviews --this movie is most emphatically NOT racist Japan-bashing; in fact such a reaction is even anticipated within the narrative. An excellent treatise on the mindset of the Japanese corporate and how ill-equipped American culture/politics is in dealing with it. Not overly violent, but there is a considerable amount of sensuality and a disturbing murder scene that, of necessity, is replayed over and over throughout the film --definitely not for children.",5,The thinking man's action flick,1013817600,"02 16, 2002",2002,1434,"['Michael', 'Crichton', 'RISING', 'SUN', 'movie', 'book', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'Unfortunately', 'average', 'American', 'moviegoer', 'flick', 'too', 'loaded', 'subtleties', 'hidden', 'clues', 'appeal', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'more', 'explosions', 'shootouts', 'decisive', 'final', 'confrontations', 'must', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'line', 'dialogue', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'average', 'viewer', 'going', 'lose', 'interest', 'Which', 'pity', 'are', 'kept', 'guessing', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'enable', 'see', 'point', 'view', 'almost', 'character', 'Snipes', 'Connery', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'other', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'plods', 'usual', 'role', 'Cary', 'Tagawa', 'shines', 'unfortunate', 'fall', 'guy', 'stuck', 'East', 'West', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'MUCH', 'more', 'mere', ""'Wayne"", 'World', 'eye', 'candy', 'film', 'few', 'deviations', 'novel', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'suspense', 'actually', 'help', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reviews', 'movie', 'most', 'emphatically', 'NOT', 'racist', 'Japan-bashing', 'fact', 'reaction', 'even', 'anticipated', 'narrative', 'excellent', 'treatise', 'mindset', 'Japanese', 'corporate', 'how', 'ill-equipped', 'American', 'culture/politics', 'dealing', 'Not', 'overly', 'violent', 'considerable', 'amount', 'sensuality', 'disturbing', 'murder', 'scene', 'necessity', 'replayed', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'children']",N/A
346809,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,6302945089,Andy Orrock,"[10, 11]","Like Michael Crichton's book on which this movie is based, ""Rising Sun"" hasn't aged well.  That has nothing to do with the artistic effort itself, but is due rather to the reality of the post-bubble stupor of Japan over the last 12+ years vs. the hegemonic, ruthless superpower depicted in both book and film.  Despite this disparity, ""Sun"" is worth seeing if for no other reason than to appreciate director Philip Kaufman's ability to stamp his own imprint on Crichton's tale.As noted elsewhere on this page, Crichton and Kaufman had a famous falling out over Kaufman's efforts to bring ""Sun"" to the screen.  In the recently re-released novel of ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" Louis Menard wrote an introduction discussing John Frankenheimer's movie adaptation of that novel.  Noting the criticism that Richard Condon's book seemed to read like a movie, he pointed out that current fiction masters like Michael Crichton ""all but provide camera angles"" in their works.That may be true, but I credit Kaufman for bringing a lot of creativity and vision into the translation from print to screen.  And it happens right from the start - it's a brilliant beginning to the film...you think you've stumbled into a Western, then via a very measured transition and pull-back, you release you're deep into a scene of Japanese sub-culture with tortured karaoke in a small watering hole.That's great movie-making.  Philip Kaufman wrote or adapted for the screen such classics as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'The Right Stuff' and 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  This guy knows movies and how to stage a story.  Crichton's criticism makes Kaufman's work all the more intriguing.  Each work stands on its own merits.  Even fans of the book can appreciate a movie that surpasses a simple shot-by-shot, by-the-numbers approach.",4,Philip Kaufman's interesting take on Crichton's work,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,1801,"['Michael', 'Crichton', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'Rising', 'Sun', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'nothing', 'do', 'artistic', 'effort', 'due', 'rather', 'reality', 'post-bubble', 'stupor', 'Japan', 'last', '12+', 'years', 'hegemonic', 'ruthless', 'superpower', 'depicted', 'book', 'film', 'disparity', 'Sun', 'worth', 'seeing', 'other', 'reason', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'ability', 'stamp', 'own', 'imprint', 'Crichton', 'tale.As', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'page', 'Crichton', 'Kaufman', 'had', 'famous', 'falling', 'out', 'Kaufman', 'efforts', 'bring', 'Sun', 'screen', 'recently', 're-released', 'novel', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Louis', 'Menard', 'wrote', 'introduction', 'discussing', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Noting', 'criticism', 'Richard', 'Condon', 'book', 'seemed', 'read', 'movie', 'pointed', 'out', 'current', 'fiction', 'masters', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'provide', 'camera', 'angles', 'works.That', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'credit', 'Kaufman', 'bringing', 'lot', 'creativity', 'vision', 'translation', 'print', 'screen', 'right', 'start', 'brilliant', 'beginning', 'film', 'think', ""'ve"", 'stumbled', 'Western', 'then', 'very', 'measured', 'transition', 'pull-back', 'release', ""'re"", 'deep', 'scene', 'Japanese', 'sub-culture', 'tortured', 'karaoke', 'small', 'watering', 'hole.That', 'great', 'movie-making', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'wrote', 'adapted', 'screen', 'such', 'classics', ""'Raiders"", 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'guy', 'movies', 'how', 'stage', 'story', 'Crichton', 'criticism', 'Kaufman', 'work', 'more', 'intriguing', 'work', 'own', 'merits', 'Even', 'fans', 'book', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'simple', 'shot-by-shot', 'by-the-numbers', 'approach']",N/A

Seems incredible given that this was one of the biggest releases of 1993. The book was a HUGE success. That's because in the annals of filmdom there might not be a more egregious example of miscasting than in this film.Turning the legendary LAPD detective John Connor into an Scottsman is beyond ridiculous. It neuters any of the American-Japanese relationship that is essential to the story, undermines the significance of his character, and cripples the plot.Even more puzzling is the decision to make ""Kohai"" a black man. Crichton was apparently furious about this.  Snipes has almost no knowledge whatsoever of Japanese people, nor does he care to. How he could ever be considered a special emmissary for the police department makes ZERO sense. He is supposed to be called in to make the Japanese feel more at ease? It's just silly. Really silly.And then we get to the utterly convoulted plot. It is generous to say that Rising Sun makes way too many left turns, spontaneously divulges new information, and presents us characters that are riddled with inconsistencies. The first 2/3rds of the film centers around Eddie Sakamura's character, yet he just comes across as a cheesy stereotype with no compelling attributes.Then why 3 stars? Because Rising Sun is also a unique film in that it belongs to no one genre and hits some dramatic notes unlike any other film. I think Kauffman is at times a brilliant director, and my suspicion is that he was trying to purposefully create a self-concious pop-thriller. As a result, his directoral touch is very fun to watch at times, none more than at the final climax which I think is chillingly effective.Rising Sun.

Sir Sean's police officer character (in semi-retirement) is called into the case to help out police officer Snipes;  his character is the expert on Japanese culture. There are many illusions created by one party or another as the investigation is vigorously pursued, pursued, however, with official reluctance to anger the business people. Connery gives a polished, controlling performance, Snipes a rather less effective one, natural given the experience differential that existed at that point in each's career. The  supporting cast does quite a good job in providing examples of the contrasting cultural ways. While not first rate, the picture should provide a gratifying couple of hours for most general viewers.It is over 20 years since I read the book so that it is not possible for me to comment on the relationship of movie to the original source.

It's story begins with the news that Senator Morton will vote against the sale of Micro-Con to Nakamoto which effectively ends their negotiations with the company, Micro-Con, and allows them to look into another offer. Somebody is determined to change the Senator's mind by way of a blackmail scheme. Who was involved? Tanaka, the head of Security was running the office at the time of the party. Cheryl Austin, the murdered woman, was undoubtedly involved. She choose a place for sex with the Morton under a camera. Richmond was informed by Mr. N's aide at the party and killed her after she had finished. Who could have informed the aide but Tanaka. Wasn't somebody using the gizmo for close-ups? When Eddie left the party he went upstairs to check on the Senator and Cheryl. When he spotted them on the board room table under the camera did he conclude that Cheryl and Tanaka were double-crossing him? Eddie thought that he had the Senator in his pocket but the disc would surely change his vote the other way. Was it Tanaka's bad luck that Eddie appeared? Did he leave the party or go downstairs to the Security office to recover the tape? Was N's aide or Richmond aware of these developments? Was Cheryl's murder planned by them? Who was holding the original disc? And who really made the copy? And why was Connor given the Golf Club membership? Was he on the take? Webb Smith believed so. Or was it gratitude for his discretion on something that had gotten out of control? Connor could have done things and asked questions to the embarassment of many people and firms. Didn't Eddie plead with Connor not to arrest him and promise him the disc at the other party? There's far more to Rising Sun than a murder. I never cared for Wesley Snipes but I do in this film. He really did a fine job but was overshadowed by Sean Connery and a really fine cast. Both characters develop through the film. Phillip Kaufmann is a fine director.

In spite of the fact the novel's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant Japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between Eastern and Western worlds around a lot of issues, the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal, transforming it into an interesting film, whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures, with Sean Connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations.

Well, I never read the book, and I still highly enjoy this movie, so much I watch it again occasionally and have done for many years now. I keep seeing reviews around of people saying this and that aren't the same and the killer in this compared to the books is different... well, yeah, you would probably expect that wouldn't you? If you have a #1 book seller, then why would you keep it the same for a movie adaption? Why have an audience sitting there knowing who the guilty one is? So please you people complaining about that, get a clue that it was intentional and wasn't going to be done as the book word for word... for a movie you need pace, and audiences don't have the patience for a 3 page insight into what a character is thinking while looking at an old toilet seat cover they own and the memories that come flooding back when they stare at it for 15 minutes having a flashback.The movies plot is about a Japanese corporation in talks with an American company regarding technology, however a murder takes place in the Japanese owned building in L.A. Enter Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes playing the investigators, with Sean knowing endless information to explain to Wesley during the whole movie about how the Japanese negotiate and think. I don't get why so many people call it racist? It's just a bunch of BS to give them an excuse to lash out the fact that they have no rational reasons to why they didn't like this film, the film is not racist and doesn't PO any Japanese people who watch it... if they all broke out in Kung Fu and ate Sushi, you would have a real claim to the stupid reasons they didn't like the movie, but it is not like that, and at the time in 1994, it was showing upcoming technology that was happening.The whole movie can be summed up as a ""Who done it"" with Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes playing modern Columbo roles.

As with thoseother movies at the time, this one  introduces to the American generalpublic, concepts such as the Toyota method, keiretsu (cartels offirms),  Just in Time supply, yakuza (underground gangs), Kaizenefficiency, etc.This movie's glamor hinges on the above aspect, tying it with thethe protectionist ( legitimate) fears at the time, that America'smanufacturing base had been beat at their own game by multiple risingpowers in Asia (  the Sun rises first in the East /  Asia but a rising economicwealth ...) and with the mergers and acquisitions crazes on Wall St. seeking tocapitalize on international stock market deals and on the  increasedtrans-national trade.Here, Sean Connery  plays a seasoned retired detective from thepolice, joined by Wesley Snipes  - an active officer in theLAPD- with a mandate to investigate the mysterious death of a youngsex trade worker or geisha of sorts to the board room executives,such as the character played by  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, etc.Harvey Keitel has a very light role in this picture, albeit doingit well, and having visibly chosen this picture in line with his target audience andpreferences:  this one  is a hard-hitting,  testosterone filled story, often showing ashallow, one-dimensional  and  one-track-minded characters.Tia Carrere is thrown in for good measure to bring some balance tothis movie, as does Snipes, but together they struggle bringingwarmth to the characters or having the audience blend into thosepersonas and making them mater. She is presented (again, as with ALL the other women)as an object of desire.The action scenes are par for the course for what one has come to expect,for a Hollywood picture at the time, although adequate.The drama, suspense and mystery is average or less.In sum, this movie suffers from its origins which is a book that appears to haveattained success from spinning a fad into a story, but that was light on substance.",2,Rides on the fad (at the time) of Japan's proven cultural and economic model success,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2108,"['Rising', 'Sun', '1993', 'written', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'riding', 'thefad', 'time', 'Japan', 'cultural', 'economic', 'model', 'success', 'Gung', 'Ho', '1986', 'Black', 'Rain', '1989', 'thoseother', 'movies', 'time', 'one', 'American', 'generalpublic', 'concepts', 'such', 'Toyota', 'method', 'keiretsu', 'cartels', 'offirms', 'Just', 'Time', 'supply', 'yakuza', 'underground', 'gangs', 'Kaizenefficiency', 'movie', 'glamor', 'hinges', 'above', 'aspect', 'tying', 'thethe', 'protectionist', 'legitimate', 'fears', 'time', ""America'smanufacturing"", 'base', 'had', 'been', 'beat', 'own', 'game', 'multiple', 'risingpowers', 'Asia', 'Sun', 'rises', 'first', 'East', '/', 'Asia', 'rising', 'economicwealth', 'mergers', 'acquisitions', 'crazes', 'Wall', 'St.', 'seeking', 'tocapitalize', 'international', 'stock', 'market', 'deals', 'increasedtrans-national', 'trade.Here', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'seasoned', 'retired', 'detective', 'thepolice', 'joined', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'active', 'officer', 'theLAPD-', 'mandate', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'death', 'youngsex', 'trade', 'worker', 'geisha', 'sorts', 'board', 'room', 'executives', 'such', 'character', 'played', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'etc.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'very', 'light', 'role', 'picture', 'doingit', 'well', 'having', 'visibly', 'chosen', 'picture', 'line', 'target', 'audience', 'andpreferences', 'one', 'hard-hitting', 'testosterone', 'filled', 'story', 'often', 'showing', 'ashallow', 'one-dimensional', 'one-track-minded', 'characters.Tia', 'Carrere', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'bring', 'balance', 'tothis', 'movie', 'Snipes', 'together', 'struggle', 'bringingwarmth', 'characters', 'having', 'audience', 'blend', 'thosepersonas', 'making', 'mater', 'presented', 'again', 'other', 'women', 'object', 'desire.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'par', 'course', 'what', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'picture', 'time', 'adequate.The', 'drama', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'average', 'less.In', 'sum', 'movie', 'origins', 'book', 'haveattained', 'success', 'spinning', 'fad', 'story', 'was', 'light', 'substance']",N/A

Unfortunately the film decides to throw a lot more into the mix ruining the overall quality of the film and leaving one a little confused. Since the victim was American and her body was discovered on the boardroom table in a Japanese high rise the film is full of racial tension. At times  there's  a strong anti-Japanese stance regarding American companies sacrificing power and security to partner with the Japanese yet the Connor character's sole purpose is to try to educate the American detective in the ways of Japanese culture and he is constantly  praising  their customs. It's interesting to note that the original screenwriters, which included  Michael Crichton, walked off the picture since they were displeased with Kaufman's handling of it. This resulted in David Mamet coming in as a script doctor and doing an uncredited rewrite of the script. Knowing this it's fun to watch the film and try to spot what parts are his contribution. A dead giveaway is when Web's superior officer Graham (Harvey Keitel) starts referring to him as ""Baby"", a favorite Mamet term of endearment. As Web and Connor try to further their investigation they're  met with resistance from the Japanese who refuse to provide witnesses or evidence essential to the case. Both men are also branded dirty cops who can't be trusted. The reason for these allegations are told in elaborate and confusing flashbacks. There are major continuity gaps particularly with the Graham character. In one scene he is shown to be guilty yet he shows up in the next scene interrogating a witness along with the cops who know of his guilt. Another confusing element was that one character is believed to be dead, we see someone die, and then we find out that that person really didn't die. That doesn't mean that he won't actually die for real later on in movie. There are  subplots involving technology and how the surveillance tapes have been tampered with, there is a sleazy senator (Ray Wise) who is too  eager to partner with the Japanese as opposed to his Washington constituents who are hesitant. Connery and Snipes are an odd pairing and there is a lot of humor in that idea alone. They are fun to watch for most of the film but at a certain point Connery's philosophizing and ""tutoring"" of the Snipes character gets boring and condescending. There are some very strong performances from the  supporting cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Tia Carrere, the excellent Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Mako. The film is well made and very stylish and it kept me involved and entertained even past the two hour mark but if director Kaufman would have trimmed the excesses and focused more on the murder investigation Rising Sun could have been a great crime thriller rather than a decent but failed one.",3,Good thriller that could have worked much better,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,3024,"['Philip', 'Kaufman', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'best', 'when', 'murder', 'high', 'priced', 'American', 'call', 'girl', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'detective', 'Web', 'Smith', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'liaison', 'John', 'Connor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'throw', 'lot', 'more', 'mix', 'ruining', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'leaving', 'one', 'little', 'confused', 'victim', 'was', 'American', 'body', 'was', 'discovered', 'boardroom', 'table', 'Japanese', 'high', 'rise', 'film', 'full', 'racial', 'tension', 'times', 'strong', 'anti-Japanese', 'stance', 'regarding', 'American', 'companies', 'sacrificing', 'power', 'security', 'partner', 'Japanese', 'yet', 'Connor', 'character', 'sole', 'purpose', 'try', 'educate', 'American', 'detective', 'ways', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'constantly', 'praising', 'customs', 'interesting', 'note', 'original', 'screenwriters', 'included', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'walked', 'off', 'picture', 'were', 'displeased', 'Kaufman', 'handling', 'resulted', 'David', 'Mamet', 'coming', 'script', 'doctor', 'doing', 'uncredited', 'rewrite', 'script', 'Knowing', 'fun', 'watch', 'film', 'try', 'spot', 'what', 'parts', 'are', 'contribution', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'when', 'Web', 'superior', 'officer', 'Graham', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'referring', 'Baby', 'favorite', 'Mamet', 'term', 'endearment', 'Web', 'Connor', 'try', 'further', 'investigation', ""'re"", 'met', 'resistance', 'Japanese', 'who', 'refuse', 'provide', 'witnesses', 'evidence', 'essential', 'case', 'men', 'are', 'also', 'branded', 'dirty', 'cops', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'reason', 'allegations', 'are', 'told', 'elaborate', 'confusing', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'major', 'continuity', 'gaps', 'particularly', 'Graham', 'character', 'one', 'scene', 'shown', 'be', 'guilty', 'yet', 'up', 'next', 'scene', 'interrogating', 'witness', 'cops', 'who', 'know', 'guilt', 'confusing', 'element', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'see', 'someone', 'die', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'person', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'actually', 'die', 'real', 'later', 'movie', 'are', 'subplots', 'involving', 'technology', 'how', 'surveillance', 'tapes', 'have', 'been', 'tampered', 'sleazy', 'senator', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'who', 'too', 'eager', 'partner', 'Japanese', 'opposed', 'Washington', 'constituents', 'who', 'are', 'hesitant', 'Connery', 'Snipes', 'are', 'odd', 'pairing', 'lot', 'humor', 'idea', 'alone', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'film', 'certain', 'point', 'Connery', 'philosophizing', 'tutoring', 'Snipes', 'character', 'boring', 'condescending', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'excellent', 'Cary', 'Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'Mako', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'stylish', 'kept', 'involved', 'entertained', 'even', 'two', 'hour', 'mark', 'director', 'Kaufman', 'would', 'have', 'trimmed', 'excesses', 'focused', 'more', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'crime', 'thriller', 'rather', 'decent', 'failed', 'one']",N/A
346840,A1FC39ADY163L,6302945089,Robert Payne,"[6, 19]","Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, Philip Kaufman's ""Rising Sun"" (1993) is premised on the idea that Asian people are taking over the United States and doing so by having white people murdered. And the story is told not from an Asian point of view, but from the perspective of two non-Asian L.A.P.D. detectives (Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes) trying to solve such a murder. Given the paucity of prominent Asian people in the U.S. media, this premise is unduly alarmist. Hollywood still needs to do more to acknowledge Asian people as a positive, integral presence in the United States -- rather than as predatory aliens who get ahead at the expense of others. As was publicized when the film was released in 1993, the movie changed the murderer's ethnicity from Japanese (in the novel) to non-Japanese, but this is merely cosmetic because the white female murder victim is still deliberately killed to further the business interests of the Japanese. In other words, the murderer is still acting on behalf of the Japanese corporation. Moreover, the film's epilogue leaves the murderer's identity in doubt. So, the film version of ""Rising Sun"" tries to have it both ways.I've grown very tired of listening to all of the excuses made for ""Rising Sun"": how it's not racist, how the non-Asian characters are just as bad as the Asian characters. This is nonsense. The film clearly capitalizes on the (presumably non-Asian) viewer's fears and misunderstandings of Asian people. All of the bad guys in the movie are either (1) Japanese, (2) working for the Japanese, or (3) blackmailed by the Japanese. So, the Japanese are presented as being the cause of all the villainy in the story. Although some non-Asian characters are given moral frailties, those personality flaws are presented as part of their overall humanity. By contrast, the Japanese antagonists are kept at a distance, so we are encouraged to see their character flaws as inherent in their ethnicity.And in an effort to add ""balance"" to the story, ""Rising Sun"" attempts to show two ""positive"" Japanese characters, but they're just stock figures: the Asian supporting character who proves how ""good"" he is by sacrificing his life so that the non-Asian lead characters can live (message: Asian life isn't as valuable as non-Asian life), and the half-Japanese/half-black female love interest who all but renounces her Asian culture and takes a non-Asian boyfriend. In light of all this, I believe that the filmmakers cast African American actor Wesley Snipes in the movie (his character was ostensibly white in the book) primarily to shield themselves from charges of racism. After all, at the time the film was made, the L.A.P.D. unit that the Snipes character worked for had no black officers -- in fact, it was primarily Asian American. Given its problematic premise, the only way the film could have added balance would have been to make one of the two lead detectives either Japanese or Japanese American.This is the best way to sum up how objectionable ""Rising Sun"" is: Just imagine what the film would be like if the Japanese characters were instead Jewish. When Jewish people are misrepresented as getting ahead in non-Jewish society by having Gentiles murdered, Jewish communities throughout the world have a name for that: they call it ""blood libel."" The myth of Jewish people ritualistically and systematically murdering non-Jews has helped to subjugate and oppress Jewish people in the Western world for centuries. In other words, blood libel has been a strong instrument of anti-Semitism. And we all know what enormities anti-Semitism can lead to. ""Rising Sun"" is just another paranoid blood-libel fantasy, only it substitutes the Japanese into the position of scapegoat historically occupied by the Jews.So, my question for the fans of ""Rising Sun"" is this: If it is anti-Semitic to blood-libel Jewish people -- and I agree that it is -- why isn't it racist to blood-libel Asian people?",1,Anti-Asian Blood Libel,1025049600,"06 26, 2002",2002,3960,"['Based', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'Rising', 'Sun', '1993', 'premised', 'idea', 'Asian', 'people', 'are', 'taking', 'over', 'United', 'States', 'doing', 'so', 'having', 'white', 'people', 'murdered', 'story', 'told', 'not', 'Asian', 'point', 'view', 'perspective', 'two', 'non-Asian', 'L.A.P.D', 'detectives', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'Given', 'paucity', 'prominent', 'Asian', 'people', 'U.S.', 'media', 'premise', 'unduly', 'alarmist', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'do', 'more', 'acknowledge', 'Asian', 'people', 'positive', 'integral', 'presence', 'United', 'States', 'rather', 'predatory', 'aliens', 'who', 'get', 'ahead', 'expense', 'others', 'was', 'publicized', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1993', 'movie', 'changed', 'murderer', 'ethnicity', 'Japanese', 'novel', 'non-Japanese', 'merely', 'cosmetic', 'white', 'female', 'murder', 'victim', 'still', 'deliberately', 'killed', 'further', 'business', 'interests', 'Japanese', 'other', 'words', 'murderer', 'still', 'acting', 'behalf', 'Japanese', 'corporation', 'Moreover', 'film', 'epilogue', 'murderer', 'identity', 'doubt', 'So', 'film', 'version', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'tries', 'have', 'ways.I', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'very', 'tired', 'listening', 'excuses', 'made', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'how', 'not', 'racist', 'how', 'non-Asian', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Asian', 'characters', 'nonsense', 'film', 'clearly', 'presumably', 'non-Asian', 'viewer', 'fears', 'misunderstandings', 'Asian', 'people', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'are', '1', 'Japanese', '2', 'working', 'Japanese', '3', 'blackmailed', 'Japanese', 'So', 'Japanese', 'are', 'presented', 'being', 'cause', 'villainy', 'story', 'non-Asian', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'moral', 'frailties', 'personality', 'flaws', 'are', 'presented', 'part', 'overall', 'humanity', 'contrast', 'Japanese', 'antagonists', 'are', 'kept', 'distance', 'are', 'encouraged', 'see', 'character', 'flaws', 'inherent', 'ethnicity.And', 'effort', 'add', 'balance', 'story', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'attempts', 'show', 'two', 'positive', 'Japanese', 'characters', ""'re"", 'just', 'stock', 'figures', 'Asian', 'supporting', 'character', 'who', 'how', 'good', 'sacrificing', 'life', 'so', 'non-Asian', 'lead', 'characters', 'can', 'live', 'message', 'Asian', 'life', ""n't"", 'as', 'valuable', 'non-Asian', 'life', 'half-Japanese/half-black', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'Asian', 'culture', 'non-Asian', 'boyfriend', 'light', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'African', 'American', 'actor', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'movie', 'character', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'white', 'book', 'primarily', 'shield', 'charges', 'racism', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'L.A.P.D', 'unit', 'Snipes', 'character', 'worked', 'had', 'black', 'officers', 'fact', 'was', 'primarily', 'Asian', 'American', 'Given', 'problematic', 'premise', 'only', 'way', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'balance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'one', 'two', 'lead', 'detectives', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'American.This', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'how', 'objectionable', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'Just', 'imagine', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'were', 'instead', 'Jewish', 'When', 'Jewish', 'people', 'are', 'misrepresented', 'getting', 'ahead', 'non-Jewish', 'society', 'having', 'Gentiles', 'murdered', 'Jewish', 'communities', 'world', 'have', 'name', 'call', 'blood', 'libel', 'myth', 'Jewish', 'people', 'ritualistically', 'systematically', 'murdering', 'non-Jews', 'helped', 'subjugate', 'oppress', 'Jewish', 'people', 'Western', 'world', 'centuries', 'other', 'words', 'blood', 'libel', 'been', 'strong', 'instrument', 'anti-Semitism', 'know', 'what', 'anti-Semitism', 'can', 'lead', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'just', 'paranoid', 'blood-libel', 'fantasy', 'only', 'Japanese', 'position', 'scapegoat', 'historically', 'occupied', 'Jews.So', 'question', 'fans', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'anti-Semitic', 'blood-libel', 'Jewish', 'people', 'agree', 'why', ""n't"", 'racist', 'blood-libel', 'Asian', 'people']",N/A

346843,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6302945089,Shashank Tripathi,"[5, 12]","For one thing, the movie is a pale adaptation of a fairly decent book into an intended ""thriller"" tinged with pseudo-racial slurs. Sadly, these clueless bromides about a Japan of yore are probably all mistaken. For instance, we are made to believe that all Japanese ""keiretsu"" companies have  a barrage of video cameras and monitor their employees 24 hours; a ""sempai"" (boss) and ""kohai"" (subordinate) have only one unilateral way of dealing with each other; a man who has lived in Japan for 18 years somehow just has to know a mysteriously effective form of aikido that only requires the use of 2 fingers to knock a man unconscious in a second; and oh, he has to have a Japanese wife (who btw does not look Japanese at all, and this is explained by the fruitcake theorem that one of her parents was black); etc etc...ad infinitum ad nauseum.But as though the cultural glitches were not misplaced enough, the acting in this plotless movie is torrid too. Sean Connery scrambles to come off as an expert in all things Japan, but his Japanese is nearly incomprehensible. Minor nits about Japan are excruciatingly explained every minute of the movie bogging down the pace of a thriller beyond any semblance of thrill.But above all, the central event -- a much-ado-about-nothing strangling of a girl during a business conference -- is pretty much left hanging in mid-air. Why was it done? We do find out after wading through an hour and a half of farcical Japan-Culture-Versus-US-Culture morass about WHO did it (and this was anything but a surprise) but WHY it was done is still a mystery to be addressed in a part 2 that we can only hope never sees the light of the day.In a nutshell, a suspense movie without any suspense, stereotypical misgivings about Japan (the country does admittedly have its quirks but not so bird-brained), a plethora of ill-timed and abysmal attempts at humor without inducing any real laughs, the tired cliche of a black-cop/white-cop combo that start out with mutual chagrin but end up with a deep reciprocal esteem, and a Wesley Snipes perpetually dressed in a flourescent orange shirt.With a Jackie Chan + Chris Rock/Tucker combo a flaky adaptation such as this could have meant some entertainment, but Rising Sun ends up being a painfully ordinary affair and a tragic squandering of a great cast over what was quite an alright novel. If you really must see the Japan of 90s, you'd learn a lot more by reading the book, or by watching ""Black Rain"" (Michael Douglas)  or ""Mr. Baseball"" (Tom Selleck).

When will most reviewers stop writing book report summaries of the plot and their opinions of the acting.  If I am interested in buying a blu ray DVD it is because I have already seen the movie and liked it and may already have it on a Standard DVD and want to know of the quality of the BD transfer.I bought this Blu Ray disc on an impulse for $6.00 as I had recalled that it was a pretty decent film.  Bloated a touch and even a corny line or so, but I liked the film.The video transfer is really quite good with details even in the many dark scenes.  Color resolution is excellent.The audio is a DTSHD 5.1 transfer that sounded clear and precise though there was very little directionality for the discreet channels to play with.  I believe that this may be due to the fact that audio is often given the short hairs when it comes to the budget.  Yes, it is clean but they cheaper out with the actual editing.There are no extras other than commentary and a few advertisements for other films.  I buy a DVD for the movie and anything that may be related to it.  I hate ads for other films.  Where are all the wonderful extras we were promised when Blu Ray first came out to the public?I wouldn't pay top dollar for  this Blu Ray release but, on sale for a good price, go for it.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",3,Rising Sun on Blu Ray,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1720,"['When', 'will', 'Amazon', 'ever', 'separate', 'reviews', 'BluRay', 'discs', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'DVDs', 'When', 'will', 'most', 'reviewers', 'stop', 'writing', 'book', 'report', 'summaries', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'am', 'interested', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', 'DVD', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'liked', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'want', 'know', 'quality', 'BD', 'transfer.I', 'bought', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'impulse', '6.00', 'had', 'recalled', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'Bloated', 'touch', 'even', 'corny', 'line', 'so', 'liked', 'film.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'details', 'even', 'many', 'dark', 'scenes', 'Color', 'resolution', 'excellent.The', 'audio', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'transfer', 'sounded', 'clear', 'precise', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'directionality', 'discreet', 'channels', 'play', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'audio', 'often', 'given', 'short', 'hairs', 'when', 'budget', 'Yes', 'clean', 'cheaper', 'out', 'actual', 'are', 'extras', 'other', 'commentary', 'few', 'advertisements', 'other', 'films', 'buy', 'DVD', 'movie', 'anything', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'hate', 'ads', 'other', 'films', 'Where', 'are', 'wonderful', 'extras', 'were', 'promised', 'when', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'public', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'top', 'dollar', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'sale', 'good', 'price', 'go', 'it.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

I have read most of Michael C.'s books, but thought I'd short cut this one and just see the movie.  I found myself very pleasantly surprised, even though the movie apparently was a very loose translation.In terms of accuracy to Japanese culture, the movie does an admirable job of capturing 1980s Japan, as well as American paranoia surrounding it.  If you accept the characters bias as irony, the movie does very well - at least as solid as Lost in Translation in capturing truth amongst the stereotypes.The plot was interesting as well.  There were enough twists and turns to keep one interested, and it's hard to figure out ""Whoodunit?"" until the last 20 minutes of the movie.  Even with that, there's still some lingering uncertainty at the end.  It's a movie that actually makes you think.In the end I enjoyed the movie, an am convinced I need to read the book as well.

346847,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302945089,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Rising Sun is a textbook example of how to take a sure-fire, can't lose property and cock it up completely. It's not just a matter of the producers controversially changing the nationality of the killer that makes Rising Sun such a appointment: where Michael Crichton's novel weaved a multi-stranded web, turning issues into clues and bombarding the reader with information and clues to keep you guessing, director Philip Kaufman simplifies and makes it all patently predictable. Subplots are poorly handled, often either never followed through or simply forgotten, and you don't even care that much about who done it, or why.Of course, there is a difference between what makes a good book and what makes a good film, but before the rot set in Crichton didn't just write novels that read well, he wrote novels that play - turning one of his books into a film should be more a matter of editing than adapting. Yet, extraordinarily, the producers have either dropped or diluted everything that made the novel such a huge bestseller.Crichton's strength was always his ability to put over big issue in a pulp format, but while Kaufman does tidy up his typically messy ending, hedrops most of the issues, patronisingly soft-pedalling the novel's economic/political debate, leaving just the pulp. It's rather like making The Third Man and ditching all that guff about cuckoo clocks and black marketeering, and getting rid of Orson for good measure. It may now be a gaijin who kills the girl, but it's Kaufman who kills the movie.Kaufman has shown he can take mainstream material and imbue it with a greater significance and still turn out a terrific picture with Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Right Stuff (and let's not forget, he was one of the creators of Indiana Jones), but perhaps he'd just spent too long making art movies in the interim. Here there's a snobbery to his direction, a contempt for his material that shines through in almost every frame - he thinks he's better than this, but still comes out looking like an amateur.Where Crichton's novel was not the racist tract many claimed at the time (Crichton's criticism wass aimed directly at America's short-sighted business/political strategy), Kaufman's film comes perilously close to being just that. The xenophobia of the scene where Snipes sets some homeboys on the Japanese who are following him is an uncomfortable and tasteless exercise in ethnic stereotyping that doesn't belong in this movie.The most astonishing lapse is in the appallingly acted and staged scene where Snipes is interrogated by his superiors. While this provides the novel with an effective framing device, only a complete idiot would include the American PR man for the Japanese corporation implicated in the conspiracy and a muckraking reporter among those present. Kaufman does. Not only is he hopeless at staging action, but scenes such as the suicide are handled with an ineptitude bordering on the infantile while some of the sexual overtones are feeble beyond belief - hey, don't forget that close-up of the next door neighbour's crotch so we know what Wesley's thinking, Phil! If anything, the absolute stinker of an epilogue is even worse, coming on like the warm wrap-up to a 70s cop show and spelling out Connery and Carrere's relationship just in case we're too thick to work it out for ourselves.Much blame for this must attach itself to executive producer Sean Connery. Too many years of being denied his due as an actor and still, one suspects, trying to overcompensate for his years in Bondage have left him a sucker for a 'quality' director and a name writer, often with disastrous consequences (cf. A Good Man in Africa). Yet if Kaufman kills the movie, Connery gives it the kiss of life. Connery is never less than watchable, and he's certainly one of the few things worth watching here, whether barking Japanese in a Scottish accent or deliberately losing at golf. It's one of the best displays of pure star quality energising a moribund picture you're likely to see.Wesley Snipes is wildly miscast in a role that didn't just have Andy Garcia's name on it but his address and a photo of his wife and kids as well. Instead we get a another of his typically one-note aggressiveone-size-fits all performances. Supporting performances are dubious at best, with Mako, Carey-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Stan Egi faring best, countered by Ray Wise and Kevin Anderson, both even phonier than their roles.When Rising Sun concentrates on the plot mechanics, such as the manipulation of an incriminating recording of the murder, it's fine, but what should have been great is merely an average potboiler distinguished by Connery's presence. Rupert Murdoch, who took a strong personal interest in the picture, said that if they got it wrong they deserved a sound kick in the a**. If you happen to run into him, you might want to take him up on that.",2,One of Crichton's best novels becomes a below-par thriller,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,4891,"['Rising', 'Sun', 'textbook',
