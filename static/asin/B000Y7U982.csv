1116061,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000Y7U982,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 14]","(2.5 *'s) There's no doubt there's something familiar about Joshua (Jacob Kogan).  In opening scenes we see him at the piano performing songs for his Uncle Ned (Dallas Roberts) his mother, Abby (Vera Farmiga), and his father, Brad (Sam Rockwell).  His mother holds their newborn daughter in her arms as his uncle encourages him while he plays.  The family is happy about the new addition, but like many families, they try to give special attention to the first born, who is nine and practicing for a school recital.  We soon realize in the absent monotone in Joshua's voice that something is indeed wrong.  At different points in the film, he asks his parents separately if they love him.The film basically goes forward in chronological order.  Captions show the development of the baby: (e.g. ...31 days, 47 days..., etc.), and we see that the infant is more demanding than most.  At one point, the baby has cried for five days straight, and Abby is under medication.  Much of the movie tries to find a solution for the unraveling mother and a baby that no one seems to have a handle on.  Just around the corner during the late night awakenings is Joshua, who startles mother, dad, and audience.  Dad is losing footing at work where his boss, Chester, is seeing everything fall apart.  It doesn't help Brad that a series of crises send him home when the prospects at work seem so bleak.To demonstrate Joshua's familiarity, in one scene he is staring vacantly just outside the doorway.  In the other room his parents are trying to calm their little one as if she had a colic.  The whole scene had an uncanny resemblance toThe Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)when the mother is making a long-distance call. Then, at a piano reception in the living room, Joshua lets out some bodily fluids on the floor.  Perhaps not the same fluids as a similar scene, but fluids just the same, and both movies suggest there's more than nerves working in the young child's life.At one point at the breakfast table, Joshua announces that someone has died in their house.  The parents are incredulous, but not yet alarmed by this peculiar statement.  Flashing forward, there's a scene with a discovery about Joshua's drawings, and in both cases it's more than a little reminiscent ofThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series).  He's even attending a private school and wearing a suit and tie at the table.The filmmakers seemed to center their movie around a theme and used elements of other movies as its primary plot thrust.  Brad shows some genuine affection for his first born son.  He's a loving and caring father, but in one scene at work he's telling an ethnic joke that has all but been outlawed nowadays.  The development is startling--too deliberate to be a deleted scene.  Also, the family is mixed:  Abby is Jewish and Brad is Christian.  As a subplot, Brad's mother, Hazel (Celia Watson, playing a minor variation of her role in 'Junebug') is a born-again Christian.  She takes Joshua to a revival prayer service without either parent's permission.  Much like 'All in the Family' when Archie baptizes little Joey without their parents' consent, Brad and Abby are upset, having arranged to allow the child's faith to be nurtured their own way.There are four points I admire about 'Joshua'.  One is that despite the dead ringer elements of other movies (and here I must includeThe Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andThe Good Sonto the list) the movie managed to instill a sense of suspense.  Also, the acting is either genuine to genuinely good.  Vera Farmiga is perhaps the best in the show, reaffirming what she's been able to do in the past.  Jacob Kogan is no Hailey Joel Osment or Abigail Breslin, but he's mostly a believable child actor nonetheless.  The supporting cast, including Rockwell and Weston, keep it real throughout.  Thirdly, there are so many more developments that take place that I haven't mentioned.  There are other scenes that definitely keep one's interest.  The other asset is that the resolution is totally unpredictable.If the film hadn't been so derivative, I would have given the movie three and a half stars.  Nowadays it is seldom that you find any film that doesn't have some elements from other movies, but these resemblances were so uncanny, it separated the difference between a film that borrows and one that's cut-and-paste*.(*Leonard Maltin uses the term ""cookie cutter,"" which is basically the same concept here.)",2,Familiar Prodigy,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,4460,"['2.5', '*', 'doubt', 'something', 'familiar', 'Joshua', 'Jacob', 'Kogan', 'opening', 'scenes', 'see', 'piano', 'performing', 'songs', 'Uncle', 'Ned', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'mother', 'Abby', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'father', 'Brad', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'mother', 'newborn', 'daughter', 'arms', 'uncle', 'family', 'happy', 'new', 'addition', 'many', 'families', 'try', 'give', 'special', 'attention', 'first', 'born', 'who', 'nine', 'practicing', 'school', 'recital', 'soon', 'realize', 'absent', 'monotone', 'Joshua', 'voice', 'something', 'indeed', 'wrong', 'different', 'points', 'film', 'parents', 'separately', 'love', 'him.The', 'film', 'basically', 'forward', 'chronological', 'order', 'Captions', 'show', 'development', 'baby', 'e.g', '31', 'days', '47', 'days', 'etc', 'see', 'infant', 'more', 'demanding', 'most', 'one', 'point', 'baby', 'cried', 'five', 'days', 'straight', 'Abby', 'medication', 'Much', 'movie', 'find', 'solution', 'unraveling', 'mother', 'baby', 'one', 'have', 'handle', 'Just', 'corner', 'late', 'night', 'awakenings', 'Joshua', 'who', 'mother', 'dad', 'audience', 'Dad', 'losing', 'footing', 'work', 'where', 'boss', 'Chester', 'seeing', 'everything', 'fall', 'apart', ""n't"", 'help', 'Brad', 'series', 'crises', 'send', 'home', 'when', 'prospects', 'work', 'seem', 'so', 'bleak.To', 'demonstrate', 'Joshua', 'familiarity', 'one', 'scene', 'staring', 'vacantly', 'just', 'doorway', 'other', 'room', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'calm', 'little', 'one', 'had', 'colic', 'whole', 'scene', 'had', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'toThe', 'Exorcist', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition', 'when', 'mother', 'making', 'long-distance', 'call', 'Then', 'piano', 'reception', 'living', 'room', 'Joshua', 'out', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'floor', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'same', 'fluids', 'similar', 'scene', 'fluids', 'just', 'same', 'movies', 'suggest', 'more', 'nerves', 'working', 'young', 'child', 'life.At', 'one', 'point', 'breakfast', 'table', 'Joshua', 'someone', 'died', 'house', 'parents', 'are', 'incredulous', 'not', 'yet', 'alarmed', 'peculiar', 'statement', 'Flashing', 'forward', 'scene', 'discovery', 'Joshua', 'drawings', 'cases', 'more', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'ofThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', 'even', 'attending', 'private', 'school', 'wearing', 'suit', 'tie', 'table.The', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'center', 'movie', 'theme', 'used', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'primary', 'plot', 'thrust', 'Brad', 'genuine', 'affection', 'first', 'born', 'son', 'loving', 'caring', 'father', 'one', 'scene', 'work', 'telling', 'ethnic', 'joke', 'been', 'outlawed', 'nowadays', 'development', 'startling', 'too', 'deliberate', 'be', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Also', 'family', 'mixed', 'Abby', 'Jewish', 'Brad', 'Christian', 'subplot', 'Brad', 'mother', 'Hazel', 'Celia', 'Watson', 'playing', 'minor', 'variation', 'role', ""'Junebug"", 'born-again', 'Christian', 'Joshua', 'revival', 'prayer', 'service', 'parent', 'permission', 'Much', ""'All"", 'Family', 'when', 'Archie', 'little', 'Joey', 'parents', 'consent', 'Brad', 'Abby', 'are', 'upset', 'having', 'arranged', 'allow', 'child', 'faith', 'be', 'nurtured', 'own', 'are', 'four', 'points', 'admire', ""'Joshua"", 'One', 'dead', 'ringer', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'here', 'must', 'includeThe', 'Omen', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'andThe', 'Good', 'Sonto', 'list', 'movie', 'managed', 'instill', 'sense', 'suspense', 'Also', 'acting', 'genuine', 'genuinely', 'good', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'perhaps', 'best', 'show', 'reaffirming', 'what', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'past', 'Jacob', 'Kogan', 'Hailey', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'mostly', 'believable', 'child', 'actor', 'nonetheless', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Rockwell', 'Weston', 'keep', 'real', 'Thirdly', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'developments', 'take', 'place', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'keep', 'one', 'interest', 'other', 'asset', 'resolution', 'totally', 'unpredictable.If', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'derivative', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'Nowadays', 'seldom', 'find', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'resemblances', 'were', 'so', 'uncanny', 'separated', 'difference', 'film', 'one', 'cut-and-paste*', '*Leonard', 'Maltin', 'term', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'basically', 'same', 'concept', 'here']",Joshua

You never see the kid do anything wrong - you just know there's something wrong with him personally.  He asks odd questions and stares blankly at the perfectly awkward times.  His mother (Vera Farmiga) was apparently a mess with sever post-partum depression after she had him and clearly never quite recovered since the new baby brings her fears back to surface full storm.  The boy is a bit of a prodigy (which is bizzare enough to most of us), but he's not even cheerful or braggadocious about it as most Amadeus types would be.  He's just blank. He's a sociopath with a genius I.Q. at the age of 9 or 10.,and you get the feeling that this kid is not acting. Brilliant!!The father (Sam Rockwell) tries to be good..just to constantly do the right thing for everyone.  This is thwarted by the little boy who seems jealous of the baby...or maybe it's that he's just bad. I couldn't tell until the end.  I just knew that the boy who played this part (who's surprisingly handsome by now) is the creepiest kid I've ever watched on screen WITHOUT having to make ""evil eyes"" or ""evil little boy faces"".

1116065,A27ZLV4D9EE0V4,B000Y7U982,Baby Doll,"[1, 3]","I really wanted to like this movie but it is hard to ignore all the flaws. There were far too many holes in the plot. There were mention of ghosts and Egyptian Gods when clearly the movie was gonna lead to neither. It was like the director or writer or whoever was trying to keep us guessing about the origin of the boy's behavior and they just didn't pull it off. The parents just seemed to lack good ole common sense. At the end there were so many unanswered questions. The story comes off as incomplete. I'm not gonna go into too much detail. I was just disappointed.I believe the movie could've been way better had the story been filled out more. A lot just didn't make sense, for example when the dad tells the uncle he suspects something is wrong with Joshua. The uncle laughs and tells the dad he's the one who needs help when just days before he had admitted very casually that his family has a history of mental illness. Or how the dad could've proven his point with a very strong piece of evidence he found but he never uses it. I think Vera Famiga is a great actress but her character was left to just go crazy. That's it.There is a lot of yelling and raging in the movie and a huge over reaction to a child attending a Christian meeting when the parents had stated earlier his preference of religion was his choice. Especially since one parent is supposedly Christian. It just doesn't make sense. Another example, one day the dad is looking at a female co-worker and pornography because he supposedly isn't getting enough affection at home then when he gets his affection he is later seen flirting it up with this same girl while leaving his clearly unstable wife at home with his 2 kids. Or when the social worker leaves Joshua in the care of his father though she suspects abuse. It's character actions like this that just lead to a lot of confusion.One minute you think you know where the movie's going then it flip flops. I believe had the movie been thought through more and had left some things out and had explained all character actions it would've been far better. I recently came across a film similar to this called We Need To Talk About Kevin.

The first half is total nonstop disappointment involving such a ridiculously slow-moving pace that the film is almost a chore to watch.However the movie does a fantastic job making viewers wonder who really *is* the bad person- the mother who doesn't care about/flat out ignores her older son Joshua after the birth of her baby daughter, dislikes and disapproves when the grandmother comes over and tries to change the family's religious beliefs therefore making Joshua change his outlook on life, and just doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on that all important thing called motherhood.  An unfit/uncaring mother basically.Or is Joshua (the son) the bad person?  He's the one who seems really cold-hearted and unaware of his actions.  He seems willing to learn just as frequently as he does disagreeing and going against his parents wishes whenever he can despite how much the mother and father try to stop it from happening.The movie does a pretty good job during the second half making us wonder if Joshua really is responsible for the horrible things that seem to happen whenever he's around therefore leading us to conclude that the boy has mental issues, however the first hour and 10 minutes is so flat out *boring* with hardly any suspense or excitement whatsoever that the movie honestly can't be saved.  What happens during the first half you're probably wondering?  The boy learns piano, tries to adapt to a world with a new sibling, and goes out to museums with his grandmother learning about religion (actually, more like teaching his grandmother about religion).  Nothing really enticing occurs during this lengthy period of time so it feels like useless storytelling.I think what bothers me the most is the mother.  She does absolutely nothing to convince me she's mature or responsible enough to handle taking care of a child, let alone a children and a baby.  The father... well, it's best not to spoil his involvement with Joshua.  It's surprising to say the least.  I'm referring to the final 10 minutes.

The basic gist of the movie is a tried-and-true mantra: little kids can be extremely creepy.  Just like other movies with this schematic (Children of the Corn, 6th Sense), we are led to believe that the little ones we love just might be evil.  There are no monsters or devils or cool special effects in this movie.  In fact, there isn't really any elusion to anything paranormal, which makes this even creepier.  Basically, it's just about a really bad (and smart) kid who attempts to ruin everybody's life.  I thought that the ending really lacked any type of closure, and the boy's character would have been better with a little building of anger instead of the good-one-day-bad-the-next development.

NOT!  It is an incredibly slow paced movie and the characters just aren't very interesting including the disturbed boy.  The Good Son was a way better movie about an evil boy.  It is supposed to keep you guessing who actually is the bad person but I never seriously cared and fell asleep in the middle somewhere then awoke more towards the end.  I love the actress who stars in Bates Motel which is fantastic but here even though she's great she can't save an awful film.

There is a lot of suspense and moments of horror when you realize the horrible things that young Joshua is doing.  You never really see him doing things because it is all suggested.  It is left up to you to connect the dots but it is pretty obvious who is being the evil actions.  The child who played Joshua fit the role too. He is a normal looking kid but through his actions he begins to look creepier and creepier.  Its good that they did not make him up to look like a weirdo kid because it would be too over-the-top and obvious.  I will not spoil the plot but the intensity of the film really grabs you as things begin to fall apart in Joshua's home.

Although it attempts to be intellectual and psychological, it is just slow and disjointed.  Kudos to Ratliff for wanting to make an unconventional horror film, but I do not think it was successful.Random vomiting, sudden mood swings and anger from all of the characters, and bizarre details made this movie feel incomplete, not haunting.  Why show Brad at work?  Why include ghosts?  Why reveal some of Joshua's bad nature, but then attempt to make it an ambiguous film where you are supposed to guess?  Why have the characters discover some truth, only to not use it to their advantage against Joshua?  Why would a child psychologist leave an abused child under sole supervision of the abuser?In its attempt to be smart, it was sloppy.

Rossi,"[3, 7]","Taking on the task of creating a movie about a sociopathic kid with a mom going through post partum depression after said mom gives birth to his sister is certainly a daunting one at least, and yet Joshua shines nonetheless. The whole way through we are treated to a mystery of sorts: What is UP with this KID?! It fans across all psychological and horror movie types in it's presentation to keep you wondering whether the kid is possessed, demonic or just plain psychotic, or maybe the kid is really ok and there is something else going on. I really enjoy being led on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't blatantly blast me in the face with all that's really happening. In other words, I enjoy being tested rather than force fed. That this movie is of the independent genre also is commendable. Watch the movie more than once to catch the clues of Joshua learning the weaknesses of those around him and deviously orchestrating situations that couldn't possibly be believed to come from a boy so well mannered and cerebral. Those who ""just didn't get"" this movie were probably looking for jack in the box, seat of the pants zapping horror and if that is what you really want, look elsewhere because this is another of the few thinking person thrillers that filmmakers like Hitchcock would have loved. Acting was far above the norm even for this type of movie; you really get what these characters are going through with the fantastic REAL performances.

Indeed, the title character bears more than a passing resemblance, and a few scenes are staged as neat little hommages to the ""evil demonic child"" school of filmmaking.But the demon here is no supernatural creation.  He evolves before your very eyes in the person of a nine year old boy, who may have the roots of a personality disorder....or may be responding to the birth of a new child in the family and to postpartum depression suffered by his mother.  Whatever the reason, Joshua moves through (and ultimately, just moves) a story which stumbles a few times but more often than not leads the viewer down an unexpected path....and into a building dread which grows steadily throughout the film to a climax you're not likely to forget--on several levels, actually.  Prepare to have several of your fears played upon to great effect--even if you didn't think you were particularly afraid of them.  You may well find yourself saying aloud as you realize it: ""but....all of this actually happens....""No big-name cast here, but by and large the acting is quite capable (the actor who portrays Joshua is especially riveting and incredibly subtle for a child), the writing might well have inspired jealousy from Alfred Hitchcock, and the camera is almost a character in the film itself, sliding around corners and down claustrophobic corridors in such a way that you half expect it to look over its shoulder at times.  The use of music at several points is extremely effective--it's worth sitting through the credits to let the story's final chill running down your spine sink in properly.Come prepared to pay attention--and to encounter a few scenes that seem a bit uncertain.

So the question is: is he really evil or just jealous and needs attention!!!The mother (Abby) is the worst a child can have! she constantly cries and cries and then screams and then throw things at the husband! She doesn't pay attention to the way her son speaks, the books he reads or even the way he dresses himself. But she's only concerns about him NOT going to church! If I had a son, I would encourage him to act his own age and I won't ignore it! if that's not enough of her, she left a videotape of herself (which Joshua will find later) where she was yelling and crying while taking care of Joshua when he was a baby...who would ever videotape himself crying and leave it in the house...that's stupid and disgusting... is that to make her child feel unwanted and abused?!! This is the mother, FAILURE and PAIN IN THE A**The husband on the other hand, is nothing but a pervert child...he will go down on his wife expecting sex while she looks sick like a dog. He will run down the street barefoot and cry hysterically over his dead dog but wouldn't give a rat A** when his mother is murdered! And wait, when Abby called his mother F****** B**** and kicked her out twice, he was sitting there watching his mother getting humiliated. Ok, this is Joshua's father, some disgusting ungrown man!!!The grandma (Abby mother in law) played the country lady and concerned Christian mother, who will come over to take care of her son's family when Abby cut her foot and yes she will take care of everyone including Abby ( who would later kick her out). but again she is another bad influence on the child, she will teach him the negative/violent side of the religion but not love or compassion.The social worker is just another awkward part of the movie, she will assume that the child is getting abused because of his drawing, and the father is the abuser, yet she will still leave the child with his abusing father.Joshua is the brilliant, smart and articulate boy but his character is just not convincing...Themovie wanted to demonstrate the child as Evil...But sorry, the child WAS NOT BORN EVIL...he only started acting out after his sister birth so all he needs is just attention. The boy was playing soccer before, he wasn't interesting in ""evil ancient Egyptian books"" before, he wasn't killing people before...it all happened after his sister birth...So, in my opinion, he is NOT evil, or sociopath...he's more like a victim of his dysfunctional family.

It is mystifying that an above-average genre film would put forth such a weak effort in closing--the mother's milk of horror movies.The story is based on Joshua, a quiet, solemn prodigy who reads college-level books, plays the piano like a pro and spends a bit too much time with animals and his colicky infant sister. Throughout the course of the film, the family dog, guinea pig and a God-fearing, sexagenarian grandmother. Bad luck seems to follow Joshua.

This movie (hilariously described as ""Hitchcockian"") has no idea what it wants to do--except be scary, which director/writer George Ratliff and co-writer David Gilbert pursue with all the fumbling gusto of screaming teenage fans waiting in line for a pop concert.The story--what little there is--centers around the parents of Joshua, a supposedly brilliant nine-year-old devil-child, and how everything basically goes to hell once Joshua's baby sister is born.  OK, stop.  Let's take this one step at a time.How do we know that Joshua is brilliant?  Um... because he talks about what he learned in school and wears his shirts buttoned all the way up to the top.How do we know he's evil?  Well, because he looks hard at things and doesn't blink.But more importantly, WHY is he evil?  In other words, why is he trying to drive his poor parents nuts?  Well... the filmmakers would like us to believe that it's because he's jealous of the attention his baby sister gets.One problem: his parents are clearly making a strong effort to shower him with attention, affection, and encouragement, so the emotional catalyst just isn't there.  Nor do we have any real clue as to whether Joshua is inherently sadistic, or just acting out of desperation.Likewise, the various ""twists"" aren't really twists at all, since this movie ends pretty much exactly the way you think it would--but, oddly, in a much less plausible way.About three-fourths of the way through this stumbling, seemingly made-for-TV film, the filmmakers try to trick us by implying that someone/something else is the villain--as though the audience were just that stupid!  But they take this too far, meaning the villain COULDN'T be the villain after all!  In other words, the filmmakers contradict themselves.Spoiler warning: there's no way Joshua could be at fault for everything that happened, since it's never addressed if/how he could have tampered with his mom's medication (what, does he have a secret chemistry lab somewhere that he also uses to poison animals?), nor is it addressed what he was doing to make his sister cry all the time.  If he was just wandering into her room all the time and shaking her awake, wouldn't the parents eventually catch him?  Why would she keep crying in the afternoons?  And come to think of it, what parents keep their crying newborn in a separate room down the hall?This movie also asks us to make some huge leaps of faith, like: 1) no one else saw Joshua push a certain character down the stairs of a crowded public place and kill her... in the middle of the afternoon! 2) that the father, upon discovering a very disturbing home movie filmed by his son, showed it to... absolutely no one! 3) that child psychologists see a child scribble a scary picture and IMMEDIATELY conclude that a child has definitely been abused (hey, I drew scary pictures, too; I just thought they were cool!), and finally, 4) that a nine-year-old boy sitting at a piano and singing a god-awful adult contemporary song is scary... well, actually, that IS pretty horrifying!",1,About as Scary as a Grapefruit!!,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,3211,"['think', 'Joshua', 'horror', 'movie', 'suggest', 'always', 'carry', 'spare', 'pair', 'trousers', 'case', 'accidentally', 'look', 'down', 'see', 'own', 'shadow', 'movie', 'hilariously', 'described', 'Hitchcockian', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'be', 'scary', 'director/writer', 'George', 'Ratliff', 'co-writer', 'David', 'Gilbert', 'pursue', 'fumbling', 'gusto', 'screaming', 'teenage', 'fans', 'waiting', 'line', 'pop', 'concert.The', 'story', 'what', 'little', 'centers', 'parents', 'Joshua', 'supposedly', 'brilliant', 'nine-year-old', 'devil-child', 'how', 'everything', 'basically', 'hell', 'once', 'Joshua', 'baby', 'sister', 'born', 'OK', 'stop', 'Let', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'time.How', 'do', 'know', 'Joshua', 'brilliant', 'Um', 'what', 'learned', 'school', 'shirts', 'buttoned', 'way', 'top.How', 'do', 'know', 'evil', 'Well', 'hard', 'things', ""n't"", 'blink.But', 'more', 'importantly', 'WHY', 'evil', 'other', 'words', 'why', 'trying', 'drive', 'poor', 'parents', 'nuts', 'Well', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'jealous', 'attention', 'baby', 'sister', 'gets.One', 'problem', 'parents', 'are', 'clearly', 'making', 'strong', 'effort', 'shower', 'attention', 'affection', 'encouragement', 'emotional', 'catalyst', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'do', 'have', 'real', 'clue', 'Joshua', 'inherently', 'sadistic', 'just', 'acting', 'desperation.Likewise', 'various', 'twists', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'twists', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'way', 'think', 'would', 'oddly', 'much', 'less', 'plausible', 'three-fourths', 'way', 'stumbling', 'seemingly', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'trick', 'implying', 'someone/something', 'else', 'villain', 'audience', 'were', 'just', 'stupid', 'take', 'too', 'far', 'meaning', 'villain', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'be', 'villain', 'other', 'words', 'filmmakers', 'contradict', 'themselves.Spoiler', 'warning', 'way', 'Joshua', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'everything', 'happened', 'never', 'addressed', 'if/how', 'could', 'have', 'tampered', 'mom', 'medication', 'what', 'have', 'secret', 'chemistry', 'lab', 'somewhere', 'also', 'poison', 'animals', 'addressed', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'make', 'sister', 'cry', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'wandering', 'room', 'time', 'shaking', 'awake', 'would', ""n't"", 'parents', 'eventually', 'catch', 'Why', 'would', 'keep', 'crying', 'afternoons', 'come', 'think', 'what', 'keep', 'crying', 'newborn', 'separate', 'room', 'hall', 'movie', 'also', 'make', 'huge', 'leaps', 'faith', '1', 'one', 'else', 'saw', 'Joshua', 'push', 'certain', 'character', 'down', 'stairs', 'crowded', 'public', 'place', 'kill', 'middle', 'afternoon', '2', 'father', 'discovering', 'very', 'disturbing', 'home', 'movie', 'filmed', 'son', 'showed', 'absolutely', 'one', '3', 'child', 'psychologists', 'see', 'child', 'scribble', 'scary', 'picture', 'IMMEDIATELY', 'conclude', 'child', 'definitely', 'been', 'abused', 'hey', 'drew', 'scary', 'pictures', 'too', 'just', 'thought', 'were', 'cool', 'finally', '4', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'sitting', 'piano', 'singing', 'god-awful', 'adult', 'contemporary', 'song', 'scary', 'well', 'actually', 'IS', 'pretty', 'horrifying']",Joshua

Shortly after Lily arrives home, a dark side of prodigy son Joshua slowly begins to reveal itself.A couple of Manhattan yuppies are expecting their second child.  Their first child doesn't react to well to the presence of baby sister - in fact he goes Damien on the entire family.Brad Cairn (Sam Rockwell) is a young stockbroker and seems to be in the money since the family lives in a nice Manhattan apartment.  His wife Abby (Vera Farmiga) is expecting their second child and give birth to a little girl.  The Cairn's already have a son named Joshua (Jacob Kogan).He appears to be an extremely intelligent and attends a private school where he wears a blazer and a tie as a uniform.  He also plays piano with his favorite Ned (Dallas Roberts).  His mother is not having a good time with the birth of child number two and seems to be having postpartum depression.  Brad is busy trying to get some big deals at work so he doesn't seem to notice at first that Joshua is acting strangely to the arrival of his little sister.  In fact, he seems to be making some sort of devious plans for baby sister and also using mom's depression to his advantage (and even accentuates it).Suddenly dad begins to have to handle mom's increasing insanity and starts notice that Joshua has plans that he's working on behind the scenes - and they're not plans that will have a happy ending.Joshua definitely brings to mind another demonic lad - Damien from Omen (with a pinch of Rosemary's Baby thrown in for good measure).  In fact, the cover basically screams that.  However this naughty boy doesn't have an evil, supernatural entity that fathered him.  What we do have is an intelligent boy but he's also cunning and appears to be without conscious.Young Jacob Kogan does a decent job at portraying the role, but the adults also have been well cast as well.  Sam Rockwell is more know for his comedic roles but he does well as the harried father who has to deal with his wife's depression and then learns that his young son is plotting something devious.Vera Farmiga is also good, but has to lose her mind and this can be a bit grating, as we want her to come out of her funk.  What doesn't really jibe is the reason behind his devilish ways.  It doesn't really have the payoff that we might expect, but in a child's size view of the world it might make perfect sense.If you're looking for a good horror film, this isn't it.

While I adore a good psychological thriller, I did not find Joshua to have an original, mind-bending plot as much as it seemed to be a frankenstein movie that took bits and pieces from other similar films. It's not awful it's just not great. The slow pace will frustrate those who enjoy the quick-moving thriller so popular today. That didn't bother me. But I never felt like it paid off in the end. As an actress, I like Vera Farmega, however in this role, her character's irrational behavior was more irritating than interesting. They hint at her mental state but we never really find out if her issues were merely post-partum or something more? Was Joshua a true sociopath, born without empathy?

Soon to join their family is little Lilly, whose birth would seem to strengthen the family, but instead it brings up feelings in little Joshua.  Or rather, it brings up the LACK of feelings in this singularly creepy child.JOSHUA isn't quite a horror movie...nothing supernatural happens.  What it does, however, is create a situation in which the post-partum depression (bordering on psychosis) of the mother collides with the sociopathic nature of her intelligent but emotionless son.Joshua is obsessed with ancient Egyptian culture, particularly the methods they had for embalming and preserving their dead.  Joshua is also prone to making odd remarks out of the blue, such as ""You don't have to love me, dad.  There's no law.""  Joshua IS loved, especially by his dad...but he can't feel it, nor can he share it.  He imitates the actions of others, in an effort to fit in.  One early creepy scene has Joshua performing at a school piano recital.  We've seen him play in several earlier scenes, and we know he's brilliant.  But on stage, he imitates the horrible efforts of his peers, and plays a horrible version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" instead of Bartok.We might think that he's simply jealous of his new sister...but he appears to be jealous of other people having emotions.  As his schemes begin to be furthered, his mother unravels and his perplexed father becomes more and more stressed about not keeping his family together.Farmiga, a very interesting looking actress, is not given much to do beyond going steadily nuts.  Rockwell, on the other hand, plays a highly successful man who also appears to be a decent husband and doting father.  A flawed but very good guy.  An appeaser.  But when the truth of who, or what, his son is sinks in...Rockwell has some unusual reactions.  In fact, his actions in the final scenes of the film don't seem to flow from the character we knew before.  He makes a huge leap in understanding his troubling kid, but then does various ridiculous things with that knowledge.JOSHUA is a slow-paced film...just barely interesting enough to keep watching in the early going.  As it becomes more clear what Joshua is, the film picks up...just in time to run into the unconvincing personality change in the father's character.  The film rushes to an ending, and while the final scene is effective...the ultimate feeling I was left with was ""eh, that didn't quite work.""Rockwell is very good as the father...it is the script that betrays him.  Also, the film takes some needless digs at evangelical Christianity, in the depiction of Rockwell's mother as a kook.So, while the film has its creepy moments and a good performance...it is a 60 minute story stretched over 106 minutes...thus slowed to a crawl and peppered with lazy writing.

Brad has a well-paying job, they live in a comfortable city apartment, and they have a 9-year-old son, Joshua [Jacob Kogan] who is also a gifted pianist. There is also a new baby, Lily who seems like a perfect child, quiet and lovable, but this seemingly perfect family portrait slowly unravels into a nightmarish horror as the family is plunged into one crisis after another.It appears that harmless little Joshua, of the quiet and unassuming character, is not so benign after all. In fact, far from it - Lily's birth seems to be the catalyst that brings forth his psychopathic behavior [arguably simmering within him all along]. At first, the problems seem to have ordinary reasons - Abby seems unable to cope with the demands of motherhood [understandable given her history of depression and PPD], dad Brad seems to be the quintessential good guy, a supportive husband and dad trying to balance the demands of work and family, but the audience is never kept in the dark as to the sinister force behind the family's problems.The acting was surprisingly good given that the main actors are not really well-known.  Brad Cairn [as played by Sam Rockwell] makes a convincing husband and father and is the proverbial good guy in a bad situation. Vera Farmiga is also believable as Abby Cairn, whose misery at being unable to cope with a fussy infant and the demands of being a wife and mother added to her battle with depression is very convincing indeed - except that you tend to wonder - why does she refuse to seek help [no nanny, housekeeper, or even family rule?]. This does stretch the credulity level a bit, but still works on-screen. There is a supportive brother Ned [Dallas Roberts] who is well-liked by all, yes, even by Joshua. Too bad he doesn't appear in too many scenes. There is the zealous Christian grandmother [Celia Weston] and of course Joshua himself, played ably by Jacob Kogan. His Joshua is well-groomed at all times [nary a hair out of place],and projects a quiet sort of malevolence that permeates the scenes he appears in, and even when he isn't there, the score and sets add to the sinister atmosphere.For fans of psychological horror, Joshua is very much reminiscent of classics like The Bad Seed [remember Rhoda?], and The Other, even The Good Son, and if you haven't seen those movies, you might want to check them out. All of them are highly atmospheric and thought-provoking. As for Joshua, it is a well-paced psychological thriller that is worth a few squirms, at least!",4,A squirm-inducing psychological thriller,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,2665,"['Joshua', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'young', 'family', 'comprising', 'Brad', 'Abby', 'Cairn', '[', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', ']', 'who', 'seem', 'lead', 'charmed', 'life', 'Brad', 'well-paying', 'job', 'live', 'comfortable', 'city', 'apartment', 'have', '9-year-old', 'son', 'Joshua', '[', 'Jacob', 'Kogan', ']', 'who', 'also', 'gifted', 'pianist', 'also', 'new', 'baby', 'Lily', 'who', 'perfect', 'child', 'quiet', 'lovable', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'family', 'portrait', 'slowly', 'unravels', 'nightmarish', 'horror', 'family', 'plunged', 'one', 'crisis', 'another.It', 'harmless', 'little', 'Joshua', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'character', 'not', 'so', 'benign', 'fact', 'far', 'Lily', 'birth', 'be', 'catalyst', 'forth', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', '[', 'arguably', 'simmering', ']', 'first', 'problems', 'seem', 'have', 'ordinary', 'reasons', 'Abby', 'unable', 'cope', 'demands', 'motherhood', '[', 'understandable', 'given', 'history', 'depression', 'PPD', ']', 'dad', 'Brad', 'be', 'quintessential', 'good', 'guy', 'supportive', 'husband', 'dad', 'trying', 'balance', 'demands', 'work', 'family', 'audience', 'never', 'kept', 'dark', 'sinister', 'force', 'family', 'problems.The', 'acting', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'given', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'well-known', 'Brad', 'Cairn', '[', 'played', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', ']', 'convincing', 'husband', 'father', 'proverbial', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'situation', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'also', 'believable', 'Abby', 'Cairn', 'misery', 'being', 'unable', 'cope', 'fussy', 'infant', 'demands', 'being', 'wife', 'mother', 'added', 'battle', 'depression', 'very', 'convincing', 'indeed', 'tend', 'wonder', 'why', 'refuse', 'seek', 'help', '[', 'nanny', 'housekeeper', 'even', 'family', 'rule', ']', 'stretch', 'credulity', 'level', 'bit', 'still', 'on-screen', 'supportive', 'brother', 'Ned', '[', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', ']', 'who', 'well-liked', 'yes', 'even', 'Joshua', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'appear', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'zealous', 'Christian', 'grandmother', '[', 'Celia', 'Weston', ']', 'course', 'Joshua', 'played', 'ably', 'Jacob', 'Kogan', 'Joshua', 'well-groomed', 'times', '[', 'nary', 'hair', 'place', ']', 'projects', 'quiet', 'sort', 'malevolence', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'there', 'score', 'sets', 'add', 'sinister', 'atmosphere.For', 'fans', 'psychological', 'horror', 'Joshua', 'very', 'much', 'reminiscent', 'classics', 'Bad', 'Seed', '[', 'remember', 'Rhoda', ']', 'Other', 'even', 'Good', 'Son', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'thought-provoking', 'Joshua', 'well-paced', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'few', 'squirms', 'least']",Joshua
