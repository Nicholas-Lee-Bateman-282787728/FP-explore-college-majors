323410,A1TMAVN4CEM8U8,6302616271,"Gunner ""The GUNNER""","[6, 7]","C. Columbus: The Discovery  DVDThis movie is probably the most historically accurate film that I've seen, so far, on Christopher Columbus.  Contrary to what you might have been taught in elementary school the intelligentsia did not think the world was flat.  They thought the world was round and was approximately 25,000 miles in circumference at the equator.  Columbus thought the circumference at the equator was more like 18,000 miles.  (25,000 is correct)  Since Marco Polo had traveled by land to Cathay(China) going East for about 12,000 miles, all he would have to do was sail West for 6,000 miles and voila he'd arrive in the Indies.  Well, he was wrong, but got lucky and hit the New World instead.  I think it is pretty arrogant to say that Columbus ""discovered"" the New World.  One would think the Indios did that.Anyhow it is a good movie.  Tom Selleck plays the King of Aragon, Marlon Brando gives a credible performance as the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada.Warning some bare breast of the native females, but tastefully done.Recommended for students that want a historically accurate version of the discovery of the New world.

I know some other reviewers think this is a &#34;cheesy&#34; movie with acting that is not so good, but I disagree.  The filmmakers and writers did their research and it is one of the most accurate portrayals of Christopher Columbus and his desire to sail &#34;across the ocean sea&#34;.  It starts with the troubles he had getting someone to believe in him and his ideas and then continues with the first voyage and landing in the &#34;new world&#34;.  I don't want to say any more for fear of giving away the story entirely.  I realize it does contain some images of naked Amerindians, but it is usable with classes if you stop the movie when they first land.

Ok, many of them are right. But we have to be also stupid?.The performances are terrible. I am not going to talk about Marlon Brando because many people have done it already. But from an historic point of view this is a crime. Who wrote this?Columbus was not an idealistic. Like any man of his time (Renaissance) fame and fortune were the great objects for a man's life. He wanted to be famous. For him this enterprise was bussiness. That is why he went to Portugal, because Portuguese were at the time the most advanced in nautical enterprises. But once rejected he went to Castilla. This was an enterprise made by Castilla not Spain. Aragon was more interested in the Mediterranea, that is why Fernado showed no interest.And of course, The Inquisition.Yes, probably Torquemada had the torture multimedia room, right by his office.Please. What do you think  a Gran Inquisidor was?. The man did not need to be before the poor prisioners while they were being torturated. He was more busy with politics and advising Isabel.No this is not a good film, it is a nightmare. And from the didactic point of view is a great mistake.
