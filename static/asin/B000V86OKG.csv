1099580,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B000V86OKG,Adam,"[10, 16]","I just finished watching the highly enjoyable 2nd season of Dexter.  Like the first season, it's a highly entertaining, clever, original show with good writing and some very good characters.  The first part of this review focuses on the series, and the second part focuses on season 2 in particular.I won't go too much into the story as 200 people have already done that, but Dexter is a Miami cop (a lab nerd, really, he analyzes blood spatters) who moonlights as a serial killer. The twist is, he only murders ""bad"" people (most of whom he finds via his job working in homocide). The series explores how Dexter, who feels very little emotion, blends in with society and ""fakes"" being human, with some interesting and sometimes comical results.Aside from the aspect of the show incorporating Dexter's struggle to fit in with society, I completely disagree with all the reviews that claim Dexter provides a view ""inside the mind of a serial killer"". Please - Dexter is fiction in the truest since of the word, the series isn't realistic, which is fine with me because as far as I can tell it isn't trying to be realistic. If you want to get ""inside the mind"" of a killer, you shouldn't be looking to fiction (instead watch any of the number of true crime shows on channels such as A&E;, or watch HBO's excellent interviews of The Iceman, which are available on DVD via Amazon or a good rental store/website). But you are truly doing yourself a great disservice if you are fooling yourself into thinking this fictitious story represents the mind of a killer - real serial killers really are monsters, and Dexter has more in common with Batman than most real world serial killers.  This paragraph wasn't meant to detract from the show, as I don't think it's creators are trying to realistically portray a serial killer, but rather to address what I think are some misleading reviews.Rather, the gist of this story is a tale, or rather a question, of morality: is Dexter good or evil? Sure, he's a bloodthirsty serial killer who brutally hacks his victims apart, and he takes enjoyment in it. But his victims are people that the world is better off without, and whom the criminal justice system has failed to get off the streets. And, while he may be emotionally detached, when he's not hacking people up he's an all around pretty decent guy (good brother, good boyfriend, good son, good employee, good ""father figure"" to his girlfriend's kids ...), and he lives by a strict, if bizarre, ethical code, which is more than we can say for most of us.If you have a somewhat dark sense of humor and an open mind (no this isn't a straight up comedy, but there are a number of comical elements), then definately check Dexter out. I think this is a very entertaining series, one of the best currently on television and certainly worth watching if you can deal with a little gore and a somewhat disturbing subject matter.  This definately brings Showtime onto my radar screen, as Dexter rivals many of the excellent series found on HBO.*******************Season 2 specifically:I'm not going to go into too much detail on the story, as several reviewers have already done so (and some have IMO given away far too much of the story, thanks for the spoilers, guys).But in Season 2, the focus at the Miami PD is the search for Dexter himself - that's right, some of his victims have been, err, discovered, and the search is on for a serial killer even more deadly than The Ice Truck Killer.  Dexter, naturally, views the investigation from the inside, with some interesting results.  On his personal life, Dexter developes hugely as a person - by the end of the series, he almost seems human.Overall, Dexter is a very good show and Season 2 is just as good as Season 1, though the introduction of a new love interest gets old fast, and adds an almost soap-opera like aspect of the show that I didn't really like.  But if you enjoyed Season 1, definately continue the series into it's second season.  I'll be looking forward to a third season.",4,Delightfully Dark Tale of Morality - Four and a Half Stars,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,4026,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'highly', 'enjoyable', '2nd', 'season', 'Dexter', 'first', 'season', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'clever', 'original', 'show', 'good', 'writing', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'first', 'part', 'review', 'series', 'second', 'part', 'season', '2', 'particular.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'story', '200', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'Dexter', 'Miami', 'cop', 'lab', 'nerd', 'really', 'blood', 'spatters', 'who', 'moonlights', 'serial', 'killer', 'twist', 'only', 'bad', 'people', 'most', 'whom', 'job', 'working', 'homocide', 'series', 'how', 'Dexter', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'society', 'fakes', 'being', 'human', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'comical', 'results.Aside', 'aspect', 'show', 'incorporating', 'Dexter', 'struggle', 'fit', 'society', 'completely', 'disagree', 'reviews', 'claim', 'Dexter', 'view', 'mind', 'serial', 'killer', 'Please', 'Dexter', 'fiction', 'truest', 'word', 'series', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'fine', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'realistic', 'want', 'get', 'mind', 'killer', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'looking', 'fiction', 'instead', 'watch', 'number', 'true', 'crime', 'shows', 'channels', 'such', 'A', 'E', 'watch', 'HBO', 'excellent', 'interviews', 'Iceman', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'good', 'rental', 'store/website', 'are', 'truly', 'doing', 'great', 'disservice', 'are', 'fooling', 'thinking', 'fictitious', 'story', 'mind', 'killer', 'real', 'serial', 'killers', 'really', 'are', 'monsters', 'Dexter', 'more', 'common', 'Batman', 'most', 'real', 'world', 'serial', 'killers', 'paragraph', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'detract', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'creators', 'are', 'trying', 'realistically', 'portray', 'serial', 'killer', 'rather', 'address', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'misleading', 'reviews.Rather', 'gist', 'story', 'tale', 'rather', 'question', 'morality', 'Dexter', 'good', 'evil', 'Sure', 'bloodthirsty', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'brutally', 'victims', 'apart', 'enjoyment', 'victims', 'are', 'people', 'world', 'better', 'whom', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'failed', 'get', 'off', 'streets', 'may', 'be', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'when', 'not', 'hacking', 'people', 'pretty', 'decent', 'guy', 'good', 'brother', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'good', 'son', 'good', 'employee', 'good', 'father', 'figure', 'girlfriend', 'kids', 'strict', 'bizarre', 'ethical', 'code', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'us.If', 'have', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'open', 'mind', ""n't"", 'straight', 'up', 'comedy', 'are', 'number', 'comical', 'elements', 'then', 'definately', 'check', 'Dexter', 'think', 'very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'currently', 'television', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'can', 'deal', 'little', 'gore', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'definately', 'Showtime', 'radar', 'screen', 'Dexter', 'many', 'excellent', 'series', 'found', 'HBO', '*******************Season', '2', 'specifically', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'story', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'have', 'IMO', 'given', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'thanks', 'spoilers', 'guys', '.But', 'Season', '2', 'focus', 'Miami', 'PD', 'search', 'Dexter', 'right', 'victims', 'have', 'been', 'err', 'discovered', 'search', 'serial', 'killer', 'even', 'more', 'deadly', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'Dexter', 'naturally', 'investigation', 'inside', 'interesting', 'results', 'personal', 'life', 'Dexter', 'hugely', 'person', 'end', 'series', 'almost', 'human.Overall', 'Dexter', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Season', '1', 'introduction', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'old', 'fast', 'almost', 'soap-opera', 'aspect', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1', 'definately', 'continue', 'series', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'third', 'season']",Dexter: Season 2

(I haven't watched 'Mad Men' yet, and it's only other competition in my mind is 'Pushing Daisies', which is a very different show.) With it's hilariously black sense of humor, this is essentially a dark comedy masquerading as a drama. Sure, there are a couple-too-many coincidences on occasion, especially towards the end of the season. But they are minor in comparison to the overall plotline, writing, and especially acting. I feel that I've gotten to know each of these characters, and their depth makes them seem completely real. And especially Michael Hall as the title character, who can go from charming to chilling within a frame. The character of Lila, introduced for this season, had some interesting moments early on, but I do feel like she hung around for too long. But on the other hand, the ongoing chase to catch the Bay Harbor Butcher, and the FBI involvement, worked great as an overall plot arc. And although it was maybe tied up a little too neatly, I still bought into it for the most part.",4,Probably the best shows on TV right now!,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1098,"[""'The"", 'Wire', 'now', 'retired', 'think', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'moment', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Men', 'yet', 'only', 'other', 'competition', 'mind', ""'Pushing"", 'Daisies', 'very', 'different', 'show', 'hilariously', 'black', 'sense', 'humor', 'essentially', 'dark', 'comedy', 'masquerading', 'drama', 'Sure', 'are', 'couple-too-many', 'coincidences', 'occasion', 'especially', 'end', 'season', 'are', 'minor', 'comparison', 'overall', 'plotline', 'writing', 'especially', 'acting', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'know', 'characters', 'depth', 'seem', 'completely', 'real', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'charming', 'chilling', 'frame', 'character', 'Lila', 'introduced', 'season', 'had', 'interesting', 'moments', 'early', 'do', 'feel', 'hung', 'around', 'too', 'long', 'other', 'hand', 'ongoing', 'chase', 'catch', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'FBI', 'involvement', 'worked', 'great', 'overall', 'plot', 'arc', 'was', 'maybe', 'tied', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'still', 'bought', 'most', 'part']",Dexter: Season 2
1099584,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B000V86OKG,Alcee Arobin,"[13, 14]","My opinion of Dexter's second season may be skewed by the fact that I began watching it almost as soon as I had finished Season One.  While the first season kept me on edge and in constant anticipation of what would come next, this season left me much less inspired.  Some of the story arcs felt wooden and not nearly as creative or engaging as the original twelve episodes.  I worried that the absence of the Ice Truck Killer plot might negatively affect this season, and unfortunately I found this to be the case.  Not to mention many of the scenarios stretch the imagination a bit too far.I can see from other Amazon reviews that I'm in the minority opinion on this.  To each their own, right?  It's funny how people can respond so differently to things like films and books and television series.While I didn't particularly enjoy this season of Dexter, I still find it to be a very crafty show that, even when it's not that good, is impossible to look away from.  While I was hoping for a more commanding follow-up to the amazing first season, Dexter is still one of the better programs on television.

Michael C. Hall is dynamic as Dexter a blood spatter analysis, who moonlights at night as a serial killer. Season 2 begins with the aftermath of the Ice Truck killer, who Dexter discovers in season 1, is his brother Brain. Dexter is riddled with grief over having to kill his brother, to save his sister Debra, who was dating Brain. We find Debra finding her way back emotionally, after having lived through her boyfriend Brain's attempt to murder her. Deb is a emotionally devastated until FBI special agent Lundy, enters her life and helps her to restore peace, strength, and sanity back to her life. Doak's is still Dexter's Achilles  heel and arch enemy. Rita finds strength following her ex-husband Paul's tragic end while behind bars. Rita fed up with the bad choices she consistently makes with the men she dates, gives Dexter an ultimatum- ""get help for your addiction, or you can't be apart of my life."" Dexter relents and begins attending recovery meetings where he meets a women by the name of Lila, who seems to get him and see him for who is really is.LaGuerta, finds herself demoted for the Ice Truck killings, and vows to take back her position as head chief, and she succeeds.

1099588,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B000V86OKG,Anthony Hand,"[56, 73]","After a blistering first series, I felt that much of the second series of ""Dexter"" was a bit of a letdown. The basic premise of the series, which I am not going into here, is very solid and allows the viewer to be concerned about the central character (which in itself creates the weird scenario of rooting for very dubious guy indeed), but before long we are introduced to the very irritating character of Lyla Turney. This is where the interesting central premise of the show gets eclipsed somewhat by a cheap soap-opera-like ""which girl will Dexter end up with"" type narrative that is, quite frankly boring.The main fault of season 2 is that the producers have seen fit to add in some Hollywood sex (in the first season he couldn't really do it), some soap-opera plot devices and have chosen to give Dexter more human emotions. This is a bad move, as by humanising Dexter too much, it tends to make him less interesting. The charm of the Dexter series is that the viewer becomes attached to a guy who is essentially a nutter (albeit with a somewhat justifiable moral code). But as this gets eroded, I felt that that my interest was being eroded too. To a point where there was considerable time between my viewing of episode 7 and episode 8. In contrast, I watched the first series in two sittings. There were times in season 2 that was just waiting for Dexter to kill someone...anyone.I do recommend the second season though, don't get me wrong. It has a good central story, mostly good acting and returns with all the strong characters from the first season and develops them somewhat further. The only problem with the secondary characters is with Debra's unrealistic relationship with her new boyfriend. It's ok, but I felt her character could have been developed in a much better way, especially after her experiences in the first series. Again, the result is very soap-opera and made me tune out to a degree.The best character (other than Dexter) is James Doakes and he returns in the second season too in one of the more interesting subplots of the series that has a great conclusion.The bottom line is that Dexter Season 2 is just not as good as the utterly brilliant season 1 (which was simply the best thing on TV for a long, long time).But for about 8 episodes, I felt myself continually losing interest rapidly. However,  by episode 9 or so, I was hooked again and the season builds to a great finale. So much so, that I cannot wait for season 3.What I would like to see in season 3 is a little more ambiguity from Dexter, certainly I want to see more of his serial killer exploits...and a little more blood'n'gore for good measure.",3,Darkly dreaming Dexter getting a little duller.,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,2647,"['blistering', 'first', 'series', 'felt', 'much', 'second', 'series', 'Dexter', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'basic', 'premise', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'here', 'very', 'solid', 'viewer', 'be', 'concerned', 'central', 'character', 'weird', 'scenario', 'rooting', 'very', 'dubious', 'guy', 'indeed', 'long', 'are', 'introduced', 'very', 'irritating', 'character', 'Lyla', 'Turney', 'where', 'interesting', 'central', 'premise', 'show', 'eclipsed', 'somewhat', 'cheap', 'soap-opera-like', 'girl', 'will', 'Dexter', 'end', 'up', 'type', 'narrative', 'quite', 'frankly', 'boring.The', 'main', 'fault', 'season', '2', 'producers', 'have', 'seen', 'fit', 'add', 'Hollywood', 'sex', 'first', 'season', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'soap-opera', 'plot', 'devices', 'have', 'chosen', 'give', 'Dexter', 'more', 'human', 'emotions', 'bad', 'move', 'humanising', 'Dexter', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'less', 'interesting', 'charm', 'Dexter', 'series', 'viewer', 'attached', 'guy', 'who', 'essentially', 'nutter', 'somewhat', 'justifiable', 'moral', 'code', 'eroded', 'felt', 'interest', 'was', 'being', 'eroded', 'too', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'considerable', 'time', 'viewing', 'episode', '7', '8', 'contrast', 'watched', 'first', 'series', 'two', 'sittings', 'were', 'times', 'season', '2', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'Dexter', 'kill', 'someone', 'anyone.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'second', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'central', 'story', 'mostly', 'good', 'acting', 'returns', 'strong', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'somewhat', 'further', 'only', 'problem', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Debra', 'unrealistic', 'relationship', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'ok', 'felt', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'especially', 'experiences', 'first', 'series', 'Again', 'result', 'very', 'soap-opera', 'made', 'tune', 'out', 'degree.The', 'best', 'character', 'other', 'Dexter', 'James', 'Doakes', 'second', 'season', 'too', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'subplots', 'series', 'great', 'conclusion.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Dexter', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'season', '1', 'was', 'simply', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'long', 'long', 'time', '.But', '8', 'episodes', 'felt', 'continually', 'losing', 'interest', 'rapidly', 'However', 'episode', '9', 'so', 'was', 'hooked', 'again', 'season', 'great', 'finale', 'So', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', '3.What', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'season', '3', 'little', 'more', 'ambiguity', 'Dexter', 'certainly', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'serial', 'killer', 'exploits', 'little', 'more', 'blood', ""n'gore"", 'good', 'measure']",Dexter: Season 2

Michael C. Hall, in particular, gave such a bravura performance that we could even forgive dead spots in casting such as actress Jennifer Carpenter (who plays Dexter's sister, Debra, and who I find singularly unappealing...)Anyway, Season Two was a major letdown, and while I had to see how it all came out, it was bit of a chore to watch all the way through. Having created a brilliant premise, and met with great critical acclaim, the show's producers seem to have been at a loss for how to keep all the plates spinning in the air, and this season had a slight shark-jumping feel to it.  More importantly, week after week, the writing felt uneven, picking up momentum and losing it again without establishing a consistent rhythm -- if we the audience were a fish that was being reeled in, these folks kept giving us too much slack.  Also, what is it with the lame female actresses on this show? Brit export Jaime Murray did the impossible: she was even more annoying and less appealing than Jennifer Carpenter!  Wow.  And, jeez, I hate to say it because I think he's a great actor, but it almost felt like Michael Hall was coasting on this one... The brilliant actor-within-an-actor-within-an-actor kachina doll performance of Season One gave way to an almost one-note characterization this time around.This is certainly worth checking out, but all in all, it was quite surprising to see how abruptly the tone of the show shifted from one season to the next: hopefully Season Three will get things back on track.

1099601,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B000V86OKG,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","Dexter certainly created a rather large pop cultural wave in its first season on Showtime, and for good reason.  Here was a series with a central protagonist who was a self described monster trying to lead a normal life.  Dexter Morgan is a serial killer who follows a code set forth by his foster father:  only kill those who deserve to die and never get caught.  That very idea stirred up a great deal of confict among viewers who were no doubt repulsed by his grizzly murders but still found themselves rooting for him to succeed not only in his vigilante murders but in his personal life as well.  That very conflict was part of what made season one such a riveting and fascinatiing experience.So how do you follow that up?  The second season could have been a mere rehash of the first.  Dexter continues to take out the trash and struggle to put up an effective front to those around him.  Instead, the show's creative team decided to let Dexter dive deep into his own heart of darkness.  Season two is largely about Dexter's inner conflicts as he questions the code of Harry, his relationship with Rita and the very impulses that drive him to carry out his heinous murders.This season takes a little bit longer to get rolling that the first season did.  The early episodes follow Dexter as he enters rehab (an action that he takes to cover his tracks regarding the death of Rita's ex in season one) and meets Lila, a sympathetic recovering addict who instantly identifies with Dexter's ""dark passenger"".  He also must find a way to elude Sgt. Dokes who is convinced that he has a deep secret and is relentlessly tailiing him.  These plot points can seem a bit far fetched at first (particularly the rehab stint), but be patient.  They all dovetail nicely into the season's larger story arc involving the hunt for The Bay Harbor Butcher--aka Dexter, whose victims unexpectedly begin surfacing from their watery graves.I won't say much more about the plot lest I reveal any secrets.  Needless to say, everything works together superbly to deliver a season that is wickedly entertaining as well as morally ambiguous.  Dexter finds himself reevaluating the flawless image he had previously held of his foster father, embracing the darkness that feeds his blood lust, struggling to justify his actions and contemplating the weight that would be lifted if he were free of the mask he wears.  What answers does he find?  Only that there may be no answers.  Life is complicated like that....even for a serial killer.",4,The Dark Passenger,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2514,"['Dexter', 'certainly', 'created', 'rather', 'large', 'pop', 'cultural', 'wave', 'first', 'season', 'Showtime', 'good', 'reason', 'Here', 'was', 'series', 'central', 'protagonist', 'who', 'was', 'self', 'described', 'monster', 'trying', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'code', 'set', 'forth', 'foster', 'father', 'only', 'kill', 'who', 'deserve', 'die', 'never', 'get', 'caught', 'very', 'idea', 'stirred', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'confict', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'doubt', 'repulsed', 'grizzly', 'murders', 'still', 'found', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'not', 'only', 'vigilante', 'murders', 'personal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'conflict', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'season', 'one', 'riveting', 'fascinatiing', 'experience.So', 'how', 'do', 'follow', 'up', 'second', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mere', 'rehash', 'first', 'Dexter', 'take', 'out', 'trash', 'struggle', 'put', 'up', 'effective', 'front', 'Instead', 'show', 'creative', 'team', 'decided', 'let', 'Dexter', 'dive', 'deep', 'own', 'heart', 'darkness', 'Season', 'two', 'largely', 'Dexter', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'questions', 'code', 'Harry', 'relationship', 'Rita', 'very', 'drive', 'carry', 'out', 'heinous', 'murders.This', 'season', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'get', 'rolling', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'early', 'episodes', 'follow', 'Dexter', 'rehab', 'action', 'cover', 'tracks', 'regarding', 'death', 'Rita', 'ex', 'season', 'one', 'Lila', 'sympathetic', 'recovering', 'addict', 'who', 'instantly', 'Dexter', 'dark', 'passenger', 'also', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'elude', 'Sgt', 'Dokes', 'who', 'convinced', 'deep', 'secret', 'relentlessly', 'tailiing', 'points', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'first', 'particularly', 'rehab', 'stint', 'be', 'patient', 'dovetail', 'nicely', 'season', 'larger', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'hunt', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'aka', 'Dexter', 'victims', 'unexpectedly', 'begin', 'surfacing', 'watery', 'graves.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'lest', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'Needless', 'say', 'everything', 'together', 'superbly', 'deliver', 'season', 'wickedly', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'Dexter', 'reevaluating', 'flawless', 'image', 'had', 'previously', 'held', 'foster', 'father', 'embracing', 'darkness', 'blood', 'lust', 'struggling', 'justify', 'actions', 'contemplating', 'weight', 'would', 'be', 'lifted', 'were', 'free', 'mask', 'What', 'find', 'Only', 'may', 'be', 'answers', 'Life', 'complicated', '.even', 'serial', 'killer']",Dexter: Season 2

But then, no serial killers I've ever come across are as loveable as Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall).  After the astounding, hard to beat first season, Dexter continues to make an impression on viewers by not going through the typical ""sophomore slump.""  Season two is every bit as good as the first, perhaps even better.After wrapping up the story of the Ice Truck Killer at the end of season one, the second season opens with a shocking discovery:  an underwater graveyard containing dozens of dismembered bodies buried in large, black trash bags.  For those already familiar with Dexter, you know what this means.  The hunter has become the hunted, and Dexter has to evade the able detective work of his friends at the Miami police department, friends that include his sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter).  To complicate matters for our unorthodox hero, serial killer experts are sent from the FBI to help the Miami police track down the so-called Bay Harbor Butcher, and Dexter continues to be harassed by Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Over the course of the season, Dexter works feverishly to stay ahead of his pursuers in what turns out to be a rather clever and crafty ""cat and cat"" game.In addition to the complications of his ""professional"" life, Dexter's personal life is also thrown into turmoil.  His sometimes erratic behavior causes his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz), to become worried, and Dexter is able to get around telling her the truth about himself by telling her he struggles with drug addiction.  This prompts Rita to insist that Dexter enter a 12-step recovery program if he wants to keep their relationship going, not knowing, of course, that doing so would bring Lila (Jaime Murray) into both their lives.The love triangle that ensues serves as the vehicle for the immense amount of character development that takes place in this second season and is what makes this season as good, if not better, than the first.  In the first season, the audience is constantly reminded that Dexte is a cold, unfeeling man and enjoys being with Rita because she's every bit as damaged as he is, and therefore cannot see him for who he really is.  Lila, however, can see right through Dexter and is able to draw out Dexter's deeply buried emotions and help him cultivate them.  Along the way he discovers new information about who he is, where he came from, and reaches the unsettling truth that his adoptive father, Harry (James Remar), might not deserve the pedestal that Dexter has placed him atop of.This all works together to provide a memorable season with a complex, rather unexpected conclusion.  Dexter is a wonderful show that is absolutely worth checking out.  With so much puerile trash out there today, an intelligent and creative show such as this is truly refreshing.Video/AudioThe blu-ray set is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in 1080p.  The picture quality is excellent, and the blu-ray version really makes the bright and vibrant colors of Miami sizzle on the screen.  The audio is also done very well, presented in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD.

Season 2 brings the incredible Jaime Murray (formerly of the unequaled BBC Heist series ""Hustle"") to mix things up. Like all truly epic TV shows, the cast is the reason we watch. Michael C. Hall was made to play this role as is the truly under-appreciated Jennifer Carpenter as his sister. I've loved Julie Benz since ""Angel"" and marvel at how she has found a niche as the ex-wife of and abuser and heroin addict.The best second tier character is David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista. Before he turned to acting full-time, he was a real NYC police officer. I believe every word he says. This season, we are also treated to the arrival of Keith Carradine for 11 episodes. I'll tell you, they really added the right ingredients and stirred the soup just right.The other highlighted character this season is Erik King as Sergeant James Doakes. Last season, he was the only one that suspected there was something ""off"" with Dexter Morgan. By the end of the last episode in season one, Sgt. Doakes starts tailing Dexter.Others have written of the plot. I praise the actors, writers, producers and all involved who had the vision to bring a series to TV where the hero is a serial killer and we root for him with all our hearts.

The TV series is based on a novel titled ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" by Jeff Lindsay and was adapted into television by Executive Producer James Manos Jr. (""The Shield"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Apollo 11', etc.).For ""DEXTER: THE SECOND SEASON"" (which aired on Showtime back in Fall/Winter 2007), the Blu-ray splits all 12 episodes into three discs.  Here is a brief synopsis minus spoilers:DISC 1:* EPISODE 13 - IT'S ALIVE! - After the events of the first season, Dexter goes after a dangerous murderer named Little Chino.

The series is actually quite colorful and a variety of colors utilized for its palette.Outdoor scenes are really nice and vibrant.  Warm colors showcasing that the series takes place in Miami.The  Blacks are a nice and clean black showing no major compression artificats.  Color pallets showcase reds and amber colors come out vibrantly and for a television series, picture quality is very nice. Of course, when it comes to ""Dexter - The Second Season"", you will see more attention to blacks, blues, reds and amber hues.  The colors fits just right with the dark nature of the series.If there is one thing that many television series suffer is a lot of noise during low-light scenes and there are some scenes on ""DEXTER"" that exhibit high-level noise.  ""DEXTER - The Second Season"" does feature a good amount of digital noise during those scenes (for example, in the final episode where Dexter is racing back in his car to the lakehouse, the noise surrounding the outdoor scene gets a bit ugly but fortunately those scenes are very short)  and that is due to the original source.Again, many television series tends to get a lot of noise during low light scenes and by no means does it detract.  The picture quality for ""DEXTER- The Second Season"" on HD is actually quite nice.While watching the series, I didn't detect any scratches, dust, white speckles or any major compression artifacts.  In a way, I was happy to see four episodes per disc instead of trying to put all 12 episodes on to two discs.  Thus giving more space for each episode.  Overall, I felt the picture quality was very good, not great but very good.As for audio, ""DEXTER - The Second Season"" is presented in English and Spanish Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The series is of course more dialogue and thus more front channel driven.  The dialogue is quite crisp and clear and there is very good utilization of crowd ambiance and also rear surround usage.  I also detected several scenes that key into the low frequencies for the subwoofer which was nice to hear.Music is utilized well in creating a sense of doom or fear.  Audio quality for this television series was good.  It's not a series that utilizes a whole lot of action but with clear dialogue and a musical score that really sets up the scenes quite well, I was pretty satisfied with the soundtrack.  The final episode of ""DEXTER"" is where you will find a good utilization of sound with explosions and burning flames.As for subtitles, ""DEXTER - The Second Season"" features English SDH subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""DEXTER - The Second Series"" is actually quite interesting as a few of the special features included on this Blu-ray disc are only for those who have  BD-Live enabled Blu-ray players.With most consumers purchasing budget priced Blu-ray players (that are not BD-Live enabled) at this time, to not include any major special features on the disc was bad planning.  There is no reason why a popular show such as ""DEXTER"" doesn't have a commentary or any special feature but only a remote control  game.  So, that was a bit disappointing.But if you do own a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player, well the good news is that you can access several Showtime features.  Included on this disc are:* Dexter: Tools of the Trade - A video game utilizing your Blu-ray remote control.* * The first 2 episodes of ""UNITED STATES OF TARA"" - For those with BD-Live enabled.* * ""Blood Fountains"" Featurette - For those with BD-Live enabled.* * Dark Defender Series - For those with BD-Live enabled.* * Podcasts - For those with BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""DEXTER"" really shined in its second season.  Where many popular shows that gain critical acclaim during their first year and then faced sophomore slumps, ""DEXTER"" was a series that actually gained more critical praise for its second year.In 2007, where many shows were shortened due to the WGA strike, ""DEXTER"" was fortunately completed and had its full 12-episode run on Showtime.I personally felt that ""DEXTER"" was much better with its second season compared to the original first season and definitely featured a more in depth, well-written plot and good utilization of all characters who did a great job with their characters.  And Michael C. Hall definitely gave a magnificent performance.But what is more interesting is how the second series really explores the psyche of Dexter and how his relationship with Rita and eventually his turbulent relationship with Lila becomes a threat.  Most of all, how Doakes and Lundy start to set him off on a path of paranoia and the impact his family or memories of his family have an impact on him.  Season 2 gives us an even greater opportunity to see things through Dexter's mind.""DEXTER - THE SECOND SEASON"" looks very good on Blu-ray and absolutely sounds great with its Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 audio track but where the Blu-ray suffers is in the extras department.  Why they chose to focus on BD-Live extras  and not include any commentary, featurettes, interviews, etc. is actually surprising and what could have been a magnificent release, gets docked a grade/point especially since many people who are taking advantage of Blu-ray are buying players that are budget friendly and are not BD-Live enabled.  That is the primary disappointment with this Blu-ray release.Despite the lack of any special features, I still give a thumbs up to ""DEXTER - The Second Season"".  ""DEXTER"" is an enjoyable, dark, compelling, well-written and well-acted series.  The second season takes the series to new heights and from episode 13 to the final episode 24, ""DEXTER"" was like a wild ride that refused to end quietly and ended quite literally with a bang.Granted, because of the subject matter of the show, this is not a type of show that is going to attract many viewers.  Watching a serial killer who gains pleasure over his victims by taping them to a gurney, knocks them out with a chemical but once they wake up, Dexter goes for the kill and makes sure they feel the pain.  And all the while he's doing it, with a smile in his face with enjoyment.  It is a sadistic series but its smartly written.  But it makes you wonder how many seasons of ""DEXTER"" can their be and how much longer can he get away with it?If you enjoyed the first season and have it on Blu-ray, there is no reason not to own the second season.  For those who have never seen the first season, the beginning episode (Episode 13) sets up the first season quite nicely.Overall, ""DEXTER - The Second Season"" is highly recommended!  But knocking down a star for the decision of going only BD-Live for special features!",4,"Blu-ray: Looks great, sounds great but I'm surprised with the direction they went for special features...BD-Live only???",1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,9496,"['2006', 'American', 'premium', 'channel', 'Showtime', 'unveiled', 'latest', 'television', 'series', 'DEXTER', 'TV', 'series', 'based',

But they do and in spades too whether it's Dexter's ""alleged drug addiction"", the sponsor that is supposed to be helping him said addiction.  But she really has MANY issues going on with her which will made clear through the season.  I will just say the woman gives Glenn Close (Fatal Attraction) a good name.  Also Dexter is having issues with his girlfriend and a prolonged stay by her mother (JoBeth Williams) only conpounds the problems between them.Also one of his coworkers is on to him and late night murderous dealings and basically lets him know it every occasion whether by stalking him or just being the all around jerk that Doakes is throughout the show.  Along Lt. LaGuerta who's lost her job and is undercover (literally) trying to get it back by any means necessary.  Dex's sister Deb is having her own issues still reeling from her having the Ice Truck Killer as her steady boyfriend.  She finally finds someone and starts second guessing things and all that.  Another player comes in as well from the FBI, Agent Lundy who's task is to be bring in the new serial killer that no one knows is right under their noses.There are so many things going on in this season that its hard to believe that everything will get resolved but just look out for the last 2 or 3 episodes of this season to see how it does just that.  I won't say anymore other than, if your thinking about getting into the show start off at Season 1 and believe me.  By the time you get the second season of this show.  You will know others already know about Dexter.  It's a well done show, with an excellent cast and storylines as well.I can't wait until season 3 rolls around on dvd.",5,as good as the first season,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",2008,1792,"['way', 'debut', 'season', 'ended', 'might', 'think', 'people', 'charge', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'top', 'do', 'spades', 'too', 'Dexter', 'alleged', 'drug', 'addiction', 'sponsor', 'supposed', 'be', 'helping', 'said', 'addiction', 'really', 'MANY', 'issues', 'going', 'will', 'made', 'clear', 'season', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'woman', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'good', 'name', 'Also', 'Dexter', 'having', 'issues', 'girlfriend', 'prolonged', 'stay', 'mother', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'only', 'problems', 'them.Also', 'one', 'coworkers', 'late', 'night', 'murderous', 'dealings', 'basically', 'know', 'occasion', 'stalking', 'just', 'being', 'jerk', 'Doakes', 'show', 'Lt.', 'LaGuerta', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'undercover', 'literally', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'means', 'necessary', 'Dex', 'sister', 'Deb', 'having', 'own', 'issues', 'still', 'reeling', 'having', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'steady', 'boyfriend', 'finally', 'someone', 'second', 'guessing', 'things', 'player', 'as', 'well', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'who', 'task', 'be', 'bring', 'new', 'serial', 'killer', 'one', 'right', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'season', 'hard', 'believe', 'everything', 'will', 'get', 'resolved', 'just', 'look', 'out', 'last', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'season', 'see', 'how', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'other', 'thinking', 'getting', 'show', 'start', 'off', 'Season', '1', 'believe', 'time', 'get', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'will', 'know', 'others', 'already', 'know', 'Dexter', 'well', 'done', 'show', 'excellent', 'cast', 'storylines', 'well.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '3', 'rolls', 'dvd']",Dexter: Season 2

Dexter's new girlfriend, Lila, turns out to be quite the hand full as his relationship with her puts more and more snags into his life.One of the things that really makes this series interesting is the internal monologues that we hear as Dexter comments on life as he goes about his daily life. Often these thoughts are ironic commentaries about the world he is living in as he tries to assimilate into a world of people who seem so different from himself. Given his early childhood trauma of seeing his mother butchered he has suppressed his emotions in order to cope. As a result he goes about through life as a detached observer of life, and the people around him. It is his curse and his advantage over others. He can perhaps see people and situations more clearly than others given that his reason isn't clouded by the feelings, or the norms, that people passively accept or are guided by.

Despite the reviews this is not a 5 star show, although I mostly enjoyed it none the less.I like the overall concept and idea of the show, but sometimes it feels like a like 70's or 80's sitcom or a soap opera.The special effects aren't that impressive to me, as the blood and bodies often aren't as convincing as they should be.The acting is not great for most of the characters and the dialogue is too often painfully cheesy or bad. I feel like I'm watching a show about high schoolers, rather then police officers. I don't mind it necessarily, but nudity and in particular foul language, often feel tacked on or forced into the scene, because I guess they feel, hey this is on Showtime, so why not.The police procedures, and behavior in the show is lacking sometimes in realism, but I'm guessing many viewers don't realize that.Also, the ease with which Dexter obtains his victims and does his setup and procedures, all without ever getting witnessed or caught, is a bit of a stretch.All that said, this is an enjoyable show if you like a dark drama. Dexter is a serial killer vigilante, in the truest sense. Unlike most vigilantes, he kills for the fun of it, and the vigilante angle, is part of a warped code instilled in him by his police officer father, to vent his perversions into a more productive outlet. Dexter is a sick man, with severe emotional deficiencies, though for the most part he hides it well.I enjoyed season 2 more then season 1. The packaging is decent for both. I hear season 3, which I haven't seen yet, gets to be even more of a soap opera, which may not be a good thing.

I went ahead a pre-ordered it to lock in the price and any discounts that may follow.I did a lengthy review of S1, so I won't do the same for this one. I will give major props to the writers and the actors for not falling into that sophomore slump that plagues so many shows. The acting was tight, the plots believable (I mean come on, we ARE talking about a serial killer) and the character development continued.  I'm not sure why people (not necessarily on Amazon) are so opposed to Dex developing as a character. He's experienced a lot over the last couple of seasons and lots of things he believed at his core were challenged by new information and new things he discovered about himself.  I think it would be outlandish to believe that this show could be so successful if viewers couldn't empathize with Dex. If he just went around killing people every episode with nothing to balance that out, I doubt people would stay interested.  Plus, by his own words, his relationship with Deb, Rita and the kids, and his bonds at the station keep him from falling into total darkness. The writers do a great job of proving that point.Also, people keep stressing that Dexter is ""emotionless."" Well, I'm no expert, but I can recognize rage when I see it, so he's not emotionless. Harry conditioned him to believe he was.  That's what I find so interesting about this show. The code of Harry is crumbling around him and he can't process what he feels or how he reacts.The only thing about the season that I could have done w/o was the infamous British Invasion. She got on my nerves.  Her character (and the acting) stunk it up w/the exaggerated accent, the over the top nakedness, and her overall presence. So annoying the way she slithered into every single area of his life, and she was a plot device, but she served her purpose in helping Dexter realize some things about himself.  So on that front, she was necessary.Dexter's ending monologue has me geared up for Season 3.BTW, the point has been made that the writers took Season 2 into their own creative hands, so while Season 1 was pretty faithful to the first book, Season 2 doesn't continue to the second novel.  I have read this in interviews and in podcasts.

Michael C Hall's acting is excellent, perhaps due to the twists and turns that the story is taking.  He has become his character much more deeply - as have most of the other characters.  Hall's work though is particularly mesmerizing.  There are also a number of important new characters this season which help shape the ever tense events that go down helping raise my impression of ""Dexter"" on the whole from solid 4 star material in the first season to genuine 5 star work in the second.

You don't get more anti-hero than Dexter Morgan, by day an unassuming blood spatter analyst on Miami Metro Police's forensics team and by night a notorious serial killer dubbed by the media as the Bay Harbor Butcher. That's right, after years of Dexter's being so very careful with his kills, his chickens have still come home to roost. Imagine his shock when his dumped garbage bags full of hacked-up body parts are found just off the coast of Miami, riling up the media, throwing Miami Metro PD in chaos, especially when evidence surfaces suggesting that the Butcher may be a cop in their department. To quote Dexter: ""For such a neat monster, I'm making an awfully big mess.""Season Two conveys a whiff of Kevin Costner'sNo Way Outand Denzel Washington'sOut of Time, as Dexter finds himself furiously racing against time, what with his colleagues getting ever closer to uncovering the Bay Harbor Butcher's true identity. Still, to demonstrate again how thought-provoking this show is, when the police's digging around unearths that the Butcher seems only to have slain other murderers, one headline from the print media reads: ""Bay Harbor Butcher: Friend or Foe?"" We see Dexter, after reading that, stand a little bit taller.Not that the recent past is neglected. The harrowing Ice Truck Killer case isn't yet so distant in the rear view mirror. Dexter is haunted by having had to kill the Ice Truck Killer who, as you know, was his long-lost brother. Dexter's cop sister Debra (an appealingly awkward Jennifer Carpenter) is a wreck. She's still coping with having been duped and captured and almost killed by the Ice Truck Killer who, as you know, was her fiance. Let's face it, Debra's radar for sensing serial killers is sort of suspect.Dexter has always been meticulous about blending in, about preserving his ""Dark Passenger."" He adheres to the Code of Harry, rules of survival taught him by his foster father, him what originally set him on this dark road. To hide his true nature, Dexter Morgan maintains a cloak of normality, fakes emotions he doesn't feel, adopts behavior that pushes him unobstrusively to the background. Except that enough of Dexter's secret life had leaked into his ""cover"" that he finds himself having to confess to his girlfriend Rita that, yes, he is an addict. She assumes a drug addiction and convinces him to attend Narcotics Anoymous. But we all know it's an even darker dependency that he clings to, and it's really interesting watching Dexter try to 12-step his way to recovery, especially when he lands a beautiful NA sponsor (played by Jaime Murray, marvelous) determined to reach the ""real"" Dexter. As ever, only the combustible Sgt. Doakes suspects that there's something off with the resident blood spatter analyst. And in this season's final few episodes, the highly charged interactions between Erik King (""Doakes"") and Michael C. Hall become utterly compelling.I think I'm in love with Deb Morgan as played by Jennifer Carpenter. Deb wears her emotions on her sleeve, is brash and bull-headed and fidgety and so potty-mouthed that Richard Pryor just ran off to fetch a bar of soap. She spends the first half of Season Two traumatized from her time with the Ice Truck Killer. Carpenter oozes attitude and wounded vulnerability and she's so very likable. And anyone could see it coming, that Deb would latch onto Keith Carradine's grounded FBI agent.Michael C. Hall's complex and uncannily sympathetic performance obviously anchors the show, and you can pin phrases such as ""darkly funny"" and ""a deliciously wicked turn"" to what he brings. His frequently amusing voice-over narration sheds a light on how his mind works. We take in his pointed commentary on society and its many vagaries. We observe Dexter's growth as a character. We see him evolve beyond the Code of Harry. Which doesn't mean he stops chopping up those what deserve to get chopped up. What's that credo? Some whatsis about having the serenity to accept the things one cannot change? And, ultimately, after the season-long bout of second-guessing, what's Dexter Morgan if not serene? It's the show itself that's morally ambivalent, leaving its audience conflicted and yet absolutely engrossed. Addicted, even.",5,"""I'm the helpful handyman.

The season opens with Dexter uncharacteristically mourning his last victim--Rudy aka Brian aka the Ice Truck Killer aka his brother.  Dexter's sis, Debra, is coping with PTSD due to narrowly escaping being murdered by the Ice Truck Killer, her erstwhile fiancee.  Despite these pesky emotions, things are looking up:  Debra's not dead, and Dexter finds himself growing closer to Rita and her kids, giving lie to his own self-assessment that he's incapable of either feeling anything or caring about anyone.  But when treasure divers stumble on Dexter's body dumping site, any attempt at normalcy rapidly unravels as he finds himself on the task force in charge of investigating these heinous crimes by a monster dubbed 'The Bay Harbor Butcher'.  Dexter will need all of his carefully-honed skills and unshakable cool to throw his fellow brothers (and sister) in blue off his tail, but obscuring the evidence and hindering the investigation becomes increasingly risky with both Sgt. Doakes and FBI Special Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine) hot on his trail. Meeting a sultry and mysterious beauty (Jamie Murray) who just may be his female number jeopardizes Dexter's relationship with Rita, but Dexter recognizes a kindred spirit who understands the heady freedom in being bad.  Season One was pretty dark, but Season Two has Dexter plumbing even darker places in his twisted past as he fights for his very life.  Michael C. Hall adds layer upon layer of depth to a character he brought to unforgettable life last season.  This Dexter is both more emotional and less teddy-bearishly likeable than when we first met him, but still we root for him to succeed.  Here's hoping that Dexter will elude detection for many moons to come so we can continue to see more and more of his brilliant creator at work.",4,The Dark Knight Returns,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,1915,"['Miami', 'heat', 'up', 'several', 'notches', 'sophomore', 'season', 'murderously', 'offbeat', 'series', 'season', 'Dexter', 'uncharacteristically', 'mourning', 'last', 'victim', 'Rudy', 'aka', 'Brian', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'aka', 'brother', 'Dexter', 'sis', 'Debra', 'coping', 'PTSD', 'due', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'being', 'murdered', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'erstwhile', 'fiancee', 'pesky', 'emotions', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'Debra', 'not', 'dead', 'Dexter', 'growing', 'closer', 'Rita', 'kids', 'giving', 'lie', 'own', 'self-assessment', 'incapable', 'feeling', 'anything', 'caring', 'anyone', 'when', 'treasure', 'divers', 'stumble', 'Dexter', 'body', 'dumping', 'site', 'attempt', 'normalcy', 'rapidly', 'unravels', 'task', 'force', 'charge', 'investigating', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'monster', 'dubbed', ""'The"", 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'Dexter', 'will', 'need', 'carefully-honed', 'skills', 'unshakable', 'cool', 'throw', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'sister', 'blue', 'tail', 'obscuring', 'evidence', 'hindering', 'investigation', 'increasingly', 'risky', 'Sgt', 'Doakes', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'hot', 'trail', 'Meeting', 'sultry', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'Jamie', 'Murray', 'who', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'female', 'number', 'Dexter', 'relationship', 'Rita', 'Dexter', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'who', 'heady', 'freedom', 'being', 'bad', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'pretty', 'dark', 'Season', 'Two', 'Dexter', 'plumbing', 'even', 'darker', 'places', 'twisted', 'past', 'very', 'life', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'layer', 'layer', 'depth', 'character', 'brought', 'unforgettable', 'life', 'last', 'season', 'Dexter', 'more', 'emotional', 'less', 'teddy-bearishly', 'likeable', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'still', 'root', 'succeed', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Dexter', 'will', 'elude', 'detection', 'many', 'moons', 'come', 'can', 'continue', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'brilliant', 'creator', 'work']",Dexter: Season 2

The Ice Truck murder case has been solved and Dexter's sister Debra is trying to rebuild her life. It's not easy falling in love with a serial killer and having no idea that your brother is also a serial killer.We go deeper into Dexter's mind and personality as he tries to live a ""normal"" life and keep his urge to kill under control. Things aren't easy for Dexter as he begins to remember more about his very early years and as be begins to place doubt in his adoptive father's intentions. A new woman enters Dexters' life in the form of Lila, the gorgeous but sinister mystery woman played wonderfully by Jaime Murray. Lila is trouble for Dexter and everyone around him, but he falls for her web of deceipt and his own secrets are in jeopardy.Also added to the cast is Keith Carradine as Frank Lunday. A new serial killer has been discovered in Miami and Lunday's team is called in to take over the investigation. Carradine is an under appreciated actor who shines in this role. It's always good to see him. Just as Lila and Dexter form a bond, Debra and Lunday form their own connection.Things get hot and sticky in Miami and secrets, desires and mystery cloud the skies.Sergeant Doakes knows Dexter has a secret. He trails Dexter looking for that key that will unlock the mystery. Dexter begins to run scared as Doakes slowly begins to peel away at the mystery. To make things work, Lunday's team is getting close to discovering who the latest serial killer is. DEXTER is amazingly well-written and keeps viewers on the edges of their seats. Somehow Dexter has luck on his side and fate always intervenes in his favor. It's fun and amazing to see the constant twists in the plot just as Dexter knows he is about to be discovered (but isn't).Lila becomes his new girlfriend. She is his solemate, or so she thinks. She manipulates Dexter and everyone in her path. She really adds some spice to the mix. You just have to watch Season 2 to follow the amazing plot develop.

But... That would be too simple. First his girl friend is a weak woman who has been made afraid of her own shadow by her very mother who invades her home after her own personal crisis, that of an uninspired school teacher who ends up hating the system she has served all her life because it cannot change when she is aging, when she becomes unable to stand young children and their disorganized way of discovering the world, life and knowledge. That mother is a bloodsucker for her own daughter and grandchildren. That leads to Dexter being careless and evoking his addiction, to death and killing of course, but his girl friend understands drugs, because of her own first husband, and she pushes him into some Narcotics Anonymous where he is absolutely vampirized by a British uncatchable praying manta that only wants to suck her men dry or dead or destroyed. That will lead to the worst dramatic events ever in this season. But that you will have to discover all by yourself like big boys and big girls. But the black sergeant of his department at the Miami Metropolitan PD is becoming more than suspicious. he tails him, he corners him, he provokes him, though he himself is not clean, with a couple of shootings that are at least suspicious, and the last one is frankly clear as plain morning sunshine. That leads to a conflict and that conflict will lead to the major bloody meat of this season. But once again, go and discover it by yourself and don't beg like puppies. It is great. The worst part for him is his inner voice that is telling him crazy things, and yet so sensible now he has bled his brother to death in front of his own eyes and with his own hands. This season is based on the idea that even Dexter can change. He sure can change. He has great difficulties killing for a while, drops one case, who is blind and can't recognize him, and fails with another case to finally succeed but out of, I my by sheer, luck more than real art. He starts doubting himself, and he is brought to thinking that his father actually committed suicide because he discovered that the monster he had trained was a real monster and not only some kind of dreamer. That leads to his own desire to end all that. But his carnivorous vampire friend of a British girl convinces him of something else, that he can actually become addicted to what she is addicted to, a minor addiction in his case, sex, and he does. But very fast he realizes she is only sucking his marrow out of his bones. But he can't get rid of her because she is destroying everything and everyone around him, including the children of his girl friend. She is an arsonist and she manages with  that great art of casting fire when necessary to capture his attention, then to liberate him of a great danger, but to make him afraid more than ever, and finally to prove him that if she cannot eat him slice by slice at her own speed and leisure she will spoil the meat for no one else to be able to approach it any more, and a few other people close to him will be toasted dry and brittle at the same time. The third problem is the FBI. It is a real problem with the first special agent who is FBI all right but careful and patient, and he falls in temporary love with Dexter's sister. But the second one, the first one's own boss, wants fast results at any cost and they satisfy themselves with the Bay Harbor Butcher the arsonist is serving them on a charred platter. That's good luck for Dexter. His worst perils and hazards turn out to be good charms. So his psychological dissolution is countered and reversed into some more positive conviction that there is a god for the serial killers of his code and that he has to go on, after getting rid of the British arsonist somewhere under the Eiffel Tower in Paris, of all possible places. So can he change? And the second season after many hesitations ends up with the same ideology as before: he cannot change, not because he was educated as a monster, but because deep in himself he has a divine soul that dictates his attitude and his action. He gets independent, free from his father because he is able to climb a few ladder rungs towards a more justified killing style and mode. He becomes some kind of archangel Michael or Gabriel who is killing the dragons of evil in the ailing heart of our society. In other words he is another Lestat de Lioncourt, a vampire by profession, and Anne Rice's darling creature and creation. The serial killer the social cereal that provides society with the fiber, the bran it needs to evacuate its clogged intestines. He is the purge of evil, in one word he is the future. And he has a future for sure. Third season coming soon. And will there be a fourth season soon too? A shame the DVD's bonuses did not include interviews of the important people on this series: Michael C. Hall for one and the director for another who has chosen the cool and slow style of a voice-over to tell us the story. There would be a lot to say about that schizophrenic means. But who is schizophrenic?

Dexter's sister Debra, his girlfriend Rita, and newcomer Lila, an English woman he meets in a 12-step program and who becomes his sponsor for Season Two--all match that description.In Season One Dexter tells us over and over he is emotionally dead, but as the season progresses, Dexter truly develops feelings for Rita and her two children. In Season Two he no longer denies his feelings, making it clear how much Rita means to him. However, Lila's presence and declaration that she understands him moves Dexter off-kilter.Throw into the boiling pot the discovery of all Dexter's plastic bags of body parts hidden at the edge of the ocean's currents and the viewer has an explosive combination that keeps him/her on the edge for all of the second season.But I neglect to include Special Agent Lundy, who has come to Miami to solve the serial killer case after the plastic bag discovery. He always gets his man and in one scene in particular, I could not imagine how Dexter would escape being identified. But remember? I have an imagination problem. I was wrong. Lundy (wonderfully played by Keith Carradine) also plays a pivotal role in a sub-plot. Nah, I'm not saying.As the season nears the end, I am astonished to think that the program will end the way it seems to be heading. However, by season's end all loose ends are tied, and concludes, better than first season, with a promise of even better things to come in the third season.I've described the bones of Second Season, but not the flesh. Season Two is about relationships: lovers, friends, lust, love, co-workers. It is also about character development. I did not care for Dexter's sister Debra in the first season, but her character development made me become quite fond of her in the second. Lila's character becomes more and more annoying as the season progressea, but I did not like her to begin with.Sometimes the tension is thick enough to cut and once I actually screamed out loud! I scared both me and my cats! In one episode when Dexter drags a torso from one of his victims into the police department with Debra nipping at his heels, I kept thinking, How will Dexter get out of this?Michael C. Hall is brilliant as Dexter.",5,A bloody good show!,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,2569,"['Even', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Dexter', 'First', 'Season', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'fact', ""'m"", 'going', 'need', 'imagination-stretching', 'exercises', 'people', 'Dexter-The', 'Second', 'Season', 'give', 'just', 'BETTER', 'second', 'season', 'observation', 'Whoever', 'casting', 'definitely', 'eye', 'borderline', 'anorexic', 'women', 'small', 'breasts', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Debra', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'newcomer', 'Lila', 'English', 'woman', '12-step', 'program', 'who', 'sponsor', 'Season', 'Two', 'match', 'description.In', 'Season', 'One', 'Dexter', 'emotionally', 'dead', 'season', 'Dexter', 'truly', 'feelings', 'Rita', 'two', 'children', 'Season', 'Two', 'no', 'longer', 'feelings', 'making', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'Rita', 'However', 'Lila', 'presence', 'declaration', 'moves', 'Dexter', 'off-kilter.Throw', 'boiling', 'pot', 'discovery', 'Dexter', 'plastic', 'bags', 'body', 'parts', 'hidden', 'edge', 'ocean', 'currents', 'viewer', 'explosive', 'combination', 'him/her', 'edge', 'second', 'season.But', 'neglect', 'include', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'who', 'come', 'Miami', 'solve', 'serial', 'killer', 'case', 'plastic', 'bag', 'discovery', 'always', 'man', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'Dexter', 'would', 'escape', 'being', 'identified', 'remember', 'have', 'imagination', 'problem', 'was', 'wrong', 'Lundy', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'also', 'pivotal', 'role', 'sub-plot', 'Nah', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying.As', 'season', 'end', 'am', 'astonished', 'think', 'program', 'will', 'end', 'way', 'be', 'heading', 'However', 'season', 'end', 'all', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'concludes', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'promise', 'even', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'third', 'season.I', ""'ve"", 'described', 'bones', 'Second', 'Season', 'not', 'flesh', 'Season', 'Two', 'relationships', 'lovers', 'friends', 'lust', 'love', 'co-workers', 'also', 'about', 'character', 'development', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Debra', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'development', 'made', 'become', 'quite', 'fond', 'second', 'Lila', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'annoying', 'season', 'progressea', 'did', 'not', 'begin', 'tension', 'thick', 'enough', 'cut', 'once', 'actually', 'screamed', 'out', 'loud', 'scared', 'cats', 'one', 'episode', 'when', 'Dexter', 'torso', 'one', 'victims', 'police', 'department', 'Debra', 'nipping', 'heels', 'kept', 'thinking', 'How', 'will', 'Dexter', 'get', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'brilliant', 'Dexter']",Dexter: Season 2
1099664,AX329NHW6B7BA,B000V86OKG,"Judy Smith ""judylynnsbooks""","[1, 1]","This show just gets better and better. Dexter is sweating bullets thru most of the second season because they have discovered all the bodies he has cut up and dumped in the ocean. The FBI has put together a task force to find the killer (Dexter) and it's a game of cat and mouse for most of shows. Keith Carradine is in most of the shows and although Dexter thinks he suspects him, the FBI agent just likes his opinions. Yes, that is the way it is with Dexter. Just when he thinks he is suspected, he finds the people mostly just respect him and want to know what he thinks. In other words, he always escapes punishment just when you think he is going to get caught. His love life is picking up speed too but then Rita thinks he has been cheating on her and dumps him. He starts an affair then with a sociopath and the tension rides high for the entire season. No matter what he does, we his fans are making excuses for any bad behavior on his part. He kills the serial killers because the courts can't convict them or find them. He doesn't cheat on his girlfriend until after she has broken up with him (he's silly enough to think when she says it's over that it's really over) and that is when he sleeps with the sociopath. Deb, his sister sets him straight. See what I mean...we should be hoping this serial killer gets caught...instead I am making excuses for him at every turn just like his girlfriend and foster sister Deb. Yes, there is something about Dexter that makes you want to turn him into a good guy, but if that happened, what would the show be about! The show has its humorous moments and it's just great!

What better way to explain his odd behavior to co-workers and to Rita than pretending to be a recovering drug addict.Of course, this predictably puts a strain on his relationship with Rita, especially after she discovers his ""sponsor"" is the sympathetic, oddly attractive and enigmatic British lass, Lila.Dexter eventually enters into a sexual relationship with Lila, which he soon regrets when she begins displaying psychopathic behavior and a flair for pyrotechnics.We also see Dexter and Doakes playing cat-and-mouse games with each other, with each having the upper hand at various points during the course of the season.Meanwhile, Deb works out her Daddy issues with FBI Special Agent Lundy, all the while unaware that step-brother Dex is the Bay Harbor Butcher everyone is scrambling to locate and apprehend.While Angel and Masuka provide some of the comic relief, Lt. Laguerta continues to be more than just a thorn in  Deb's side. We are shocked to learn what lengths Laguerta will go to in order to get her job back and are touched by her loyalty to Doakes when he comes under suspicion.Overall, I didn't find Season 2 as riveting as Season 1, but I still enjoyed every minute of it. The acting continues to be superb, though I wish Rita wasn't always coming off as such a wet noodle. Michael C. Hall is amazing to watch, especially during the scenes when he feels as though his world is spiralling out of control.I am eager to see what the producers have in store for Dexter in the third season.",4,"Not As Compelling as Season 1, But Well Worth Your Time",1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1920,"['*NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', '*Just', 'when', 'seemed', 'calm', 'Dexter', 'eventual', 'disposal', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'Season', '1', 'finale', 'past', 'crimes', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'scuba', 'divers', 'accidentally', 'stumble', 'underwater', 'graveyard', 'victims.Season', '2', 'finds', 'Dexter', 'scrutiny', 'when', 'FBI', 'called', 'help', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'deal', 'capture', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'explain', 'odd', 'behavior', 'co-workers', 'Rita', 'pretending', 'be', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict.Of', 'course', 'predictably', 'strain', 'relationship', 'Rita', 'especially', 'sponsor', 'sympathetic', 'oddly', 'attractive', 'enigmatic', 'British', 'lass', 'Lila.Dexter', 'eventually', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Lila', 'soon', 'regrets', 'when', 'displaying', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', 'flair', 'pyrotechnics.We', 'also', 'see', 'Dexter', 'Doakes', 'playing', 'cat-and-mouse', 'games', 'other', 'having', 'upper', 'hand', 'various', 'points', 'course', 'season.Meanwhile', 'Deb', 'out', 'Daddy', 'issues', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'while', 'unaware', 'step-brother', 'Dex', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'everyone', 'scrambling', 'locate', 'apprehend.While', 'Angel', 'Masuka', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'Lt.', 'Laguerta', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'thorn', 'Deb', 'side', 'are', 'shocked', 'learn', 'what', 'lengths', 'Laguerta', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'are', 'touched', 'loyalty', 'Doakes', 'when', 'suspicion.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'riveting', 'Season', '1', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'acting', 'be', 'superb', 'wish', 'Rita', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'coming', 'off', 'such', 'wet', 'noodle', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'amazing', 'watch', 'especially', 'scenes', 'when', 'world', 'spiralling', 'control.I', 'am', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'producers', 'have', 'store', 'Dexter', 'third', 'season']",Dexter: Season 2

1099670,A356RFKNIG043B,B000V86OKG,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","4.3 starsI found Dexter's second season much less compelling than the first, mainly due to the insertion of some soap-operaish relationship plots, and much less of the Dexter voiceovers and ideas that made the first season so amazing.Lila is a good character and was a highlight; I'd rather have seen Dexter stay with her, as Rita just becomes too schizy and annoying after a while here, and her mother grates so hard that it was almost no fun to watch her (but a pleasure to see her go!). I kept longing for more of Dexter's thoughts and perspective, and less side stories from the other characters. To me everything here that isn't Dexter is pretty much standard cop show melodrama, and those actors just don't grab me at all compared to Hall.But Hall remains so good that he makes this very worth watching. He is so inside this character it's almost eerie; in fact it is, which is why this works. I'd be quite happy to watch nothing but Hall, all show every show. The guy is a master at work here, and it's his genius that makes this show happen. The other actors have their moments, but none ever come close to reaching Hall's (constant) heights.Of the whole season, epsiode 3 stands out due to the exceptional writing of Melissa Rosenberg. ""An Inconvenient Lie"" features some of the very best dialogue and interior monologues in any season of this show; the opening scenes are supremely sharp and intelligent. I don't know if this show is written by committee or singly by episode, but if this is mainly the work of Melissa, then well done, ma'am. It's easily the highlight of this season, and one of the best shows in the entire series.There are some very poor plot choices in season two, though {spoilers}: no way does hyper-careful Dexter tell Rita the truth about his framing her boyfriend, no way. It involves her in it and breaks his almighty code. Ditto for leaving Doakes alone in that flimsy cage; the guy's gonna get out, period. And methodical uncaught Dexter leaves his murder hideout cabin location on his GPS? Come on. Lazy plotting like that just to make other events easier to assimilate is weak writing, something that season one was free of.But Hall remains the towering presence in season two.It's a treat to watch him make Dexter come to life, and death, so believably.",4,"Hall is still killer, but scripts are slipping",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2294,"['4.3', 'starsI', 'found', 'Dexter', 'second', 'season', 'much', 'less', 'compelling', 'first', 'mainly', 'due', 'insertion', 'soap-operaish', 'relationship', 'plots', 'much', 'less', 'Dexter', 'voiceovers', 'ideas', 'made', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'amazing.Lila', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'highlight', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Dexter', 'stay', 'Rita', 'just', 'becomes', 'too', 'schizy', 'annoying', 'while', 'here', 'mother', 'grates', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'almost', 'fun', 'watch', 'pleasure', 'see', 'go', 'kept', 'longing', 'more', 'Dexter', 'thoughts', 'perspective', 'less', 'side', 'stories', 'other', 'characters', 'everything', 'here', ""n't"", 'Dexter', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'cop', 'show', 'melodrama', 'actors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'grab', 'compared', 'Hall.But', 'Hall', 'so', 'good', 'very', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'inside', 'character', 'almost', 'eerie', 'fact', 'why', ""'d"", 'be', 'quite', 'happy', 'watch', 'nothing', 'Hall', 'show', 'show', 'guy', 'master', 'work', 'here', 'genius', 'show', 'happen', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'moments', 'none', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'reaching', 'Hall', 'constant', 'heights.Of', 'whole', 'season', 'epsiode', '3', 'stands', 'out', 'due', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'Melissa', 'Rosenberg', 'Inconvenient', 'Lie', 'very', 'best', 'dialogue', 'interior', 'monologues', 'season', 'show', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'supremely', 'sharp', 'intelligent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'written', 'committee', 'singly', 'episode', 'mainly', 'work', 'Melissa', 'then', 'well', 'done', ""ma'am"", 'easily', 'highlight', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'entire', 'series.There', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'plot', 'choices', 'season', 'two', 'spoilers', 'way', 'hyper-careful', 'Dexter', 'tell', 'Rita', 'truth', 'framing', 'boyfriend', 'way', 'breaks', 'almighty', 'code', 'Ditto', 'leaving', 'Doakes', 'alone', 'flimsy', 'cage', 'guy', 'gon', 'get', 'out', 'period', 'methodical', 'uncaught', 'Dexter', 'murder', 'hideout', 'cabin', 'location', 'GPS', 'Come', 'Lazy', 'plotting', 'just', 'make', 'other', 'events', 'easier', 'assimilate', 'weak', 'writing', 'something', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'free', 'Hall', 'towering', 'presence', 'season', 'two.It', 'treat', 'watch', 'make', 'Dexter', 'come', 'life', 'death', 'so', 'believably']",Dexter: Season 2

Braun,"[47, 59]","first, the second season does not follow the order of the books: season 2 begins where most cliffhangers end: Dexter's victims get hauled up out of the water. Dexter's sister becomes a stronger character, following the character as she appears in the book series. Given alla that, this is a crown jewel of cable TV writing: their writers are so over-the-top that they continually seem to write the next episode better than the last: no kidding; a singular reason to get Showtime.The incidental music of both seasons are on CD with a few tracks on itunes as exclusives: get them.Enter a lady who is clear from the first glance serious trouble and this is a spectacular edge-of-your-seat season worth watching again and again (and btw, that'd help just to take in the small stuff that gest missed on one viewing; particularly the Doakes/Dex showdown). And Dex will do something unthinkable: he chuckles. Wanna guess why? Here's a clue: Dex begins to become more human, despite his insistence that he's not quite human. Harry's Law gets an upheaval.Now for the BOOK fans, Doakes meets some cruel cutting time in Dexter's 2nd book. In the TV series, Doakes, well, gives Dex a problem: whack a great cop who refuses to back down or surrender to him: what do YOU think Dex would do?Kudos to a killer (sorry) cast for a job very, very well done.  While the CBS edited version is still looming in the near future, ya gotta wonder how they'll work around Doakes's profanity, profuse bloodletting and pieces of weekly corpses.

1099681,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000V86OKG,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","DEXTER is a series on Showtime that is about to start its fourth season. Fortunately those who have never been exposed to DEXTER now have the opportunity. You're one of those few? Then let me inform you as season two arrives on blu-ray disc.DEXTER stars Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan, a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. If anyone knows anything at all about forensics, especially blood splatters, it's Dexter. Partly because he's been educated in that field. And also because he happens to be a serial killer.But Dexter is no normal serial killer. Having shown homicidal tendencies when he was young, his police officer foster father Harry (James Remar) trained him how to murder and get away with it. Harry's rules are what have guided Dexter as he selects criminals who get off on technicalities, only the worst of the worst, to eliminate.Season one introduced us to Dexter and his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), another police officer as well as the rest of the department members. Officer Angel Batista (David Zayas) is a solid friend to Dexter while Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) seems to know something just isn't right. Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) tries to keep tabs on things but by seasons end was dropped from head of her squad to officer once again due to police politics.The series doesn't just dwell on Dexter's proclivity for killing people, it revolves around each member of the squad, how they interact and what's going on in their lives as well. But we also get to meet Dexter's girlfriend Rita (Julie Bienz) and her family as well, the perfect cover for Dexter, a man without emotion as he reminds us during numerous voice overs that give us a glimpse as to who he is.Fans spent season one with Dexter as he tried to find another serial killer that kept leaving clues specifically for him. Season two finds Dexter trying to find himself. Problems from the first season find him faking addiction and being forced by Rita to go to a 12 step program. It is there that he meets Lila (Jaime Murray) who becomes his sponsor. But there is more to Lila than we know.As season 2 opens the underwater burial ground that Dexter uses to dispose of his victims is accidentally discovered. This leads to the unearthing of over 18 victims and a major manhunt for what is termed the Bay Harbor Butcher. As large a case as this becomes, the FBI is called in led by the special agent who handles serial killers, Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine).As with the first season, the story jumps around to different stories involving each character with Dexter at the center. Lila becomes a bit more than Dexter's sponsor which pulls apart his relationship with Rita and her family. But that had more problems with the appearance of Rita's mother (JoBeth Williams) who has issues of her own. And Doakes begins to suspect there is more to Dexter than ever going so far as to tail him.Office romances come round this season in the most unlikely of places. Obvious choices for these are passed over. And the emotions that Dexter swears don't exist within him seem to rear their ugly heads more often this season than the first. Perhaps it is Dexter's refusal to believe he has any feelings that demonstrates the biggest case of denial in the series.Will Dexter get caught? Will Lila disrupt what Dexter and Rita have? Will Dexter's sister find romance with the right man? Will Angel and his wife get back together? Will Doakes ease up on Dexter or discover his secret? And along the road to recovery via the 12 step program, will Dexter give up his life of murderous justice?The series is brilliant. Sure I know, it sounds odd to say that about a show that turns a serial killer into the greatest anti-hero of all time. But that's what makes it so great. While watching you find yourself rooting for Dexter only to sit back later and realize he's a killer.The show is not only one of the wittiest written dramas seen in ages, it offers a heavy dose of dark comedy as well. Off hand remarks Dexter makes or thinks, set ups with charters who don't realize what Dexter is and coincidences that make for some hairy moments are found throughout.By the last two episodes of this season I was clawing at the remote, restraining myself from fast forwarding just to find out the results of all the threads running throughout the story. I'm glad I remained patient and watched them without fast forward. It left me with a satisfied feeling that few shows offer. And dying to see season 3 and season 4.I can't begin to praise this series more than I already have. And my admiration for the show and it's stars grows with each new season I watch. I'm dying to find out what happens in season three enough that I may have to take lunch for several weeks so I can go out and buy it! It's a good enough series that, dare I say this....I might be inclined to order Showtime just to watch it.Does the blu-ray help here? Honestly I can't say one way or the other, having watched season 1 on regular DVD. Beads of sweat on brows in the hot Miami heat glisten more, Dexter's stubble almost offers individual hairs and facial flaws are more obvious on people. Perhaps the best thing it offers is the cleanest picture to be found and that's worth something.Dexter is not for everyone. But for those with the same off kilter sense of humor I have or who want to see a good whodunit, this will meet your criteria. And at the same time it might just give you a laugh or two. Sure you might feel just a touch of guilt laughing about a serial killer. But after all, it's only a TV show. At least we can hope",5,INSIDE THE MONSTER THAT IS...,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,5608,"['DEXTER', 'series', 'Showtime', 'start', 'fourth', 'season', 'Fortunately', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been',

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","I've already mentioned my tenuous link to the Dexter crew in my review of Season One, so I'll just skip to why I love this show so much: because it's fearless.This season takes many of the established tropes that make Dexter's life (Michael C. Hall) as a vigilante/serial killer plausible and tosses them out the window.  Everything that was a minor annoyance in the first season is amped up to 11. Dexter's dumping ground for corpses, a quaint little spot in the ocean that nobody ever noticed, gets noticed.  Officer Doakes (Erik King), who was openly hostile to Dexter, becomes a very real threat.  Harry's Code, which keeps Dexter on the mostly-straight and somewhat-narrow path, comes into question. LaGuerta (Lauren Velez) stoops to new lows to get her old job back.  And Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), who was always annoying to begin with, moves in with him to become even more annoying.The show doesn't forget its past.  Debra is traumatized by the fact that she almost married a serial killer; the characters regularly forget the incident and stumble over apologies as they make insensitive remarks. Dexter greatly misses his serial-killer brother, the only person who understood him.  Until he finds a new soul mate: Lila (Jaime Murray).Lila seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way (or the right way, if you like brunettes).  She's gorgeous in a goth fashion, completely uninhibited, and madly in love with the Dexter she doesn't see. She's also a complete loon.  All these attributes make her a perfect fit for Dexter...except Dexter is very much a family man, a killer who would never harm children, who despite his violent excesses surrounds himself with the trappings of family.  Lila throws in sharp relief what vestiges of Dexter's personality are decent, and as such she's a perfect foil for season 2.The other breakout character is Doakes.  Once Doakes unearths Dexter's past, the two come to an understanding.  Throughout the season are philosophical arguments that detail each man's past in a game of one-upmanship.  Who is worse: the special ops soldier who murders people he's ordered to kill, or the vigilante who uses free will to determine whom he executes? We don't get a clear answer, only more questions.There are some entertaining nods to the field of serial killer investigation.  Don Foster (Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous) gets a shout-out...and is soundly, brutally mocked for his language analysis, sorry Don. So does Bob Ressler (Whoever Fights Monsters) in the form of Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine). An awkward but believable subplot develops between Lundy and Debra, just further exemplifying that none of Dexter's heroes are one-dimensional, but fully developed and all too humanly flawed.We tore through this season on our Netflix list, clearing out our queue to ensure we could watch all the DVDs back to back.

Emery,"[0, 0]","The show itself is amazingly enjoyable and I recommend the series to everyone.However...I own all the seasons on DVD and this one FORCES you to sit through a near minute long Showtime ad BEFORE EACH EPISODE! You can not skip passed it, and choosing the ""play all"" option will not stop it either.I realize that Showtime wants to pimp its other programs, and entice you to suscribe to thier channel, it IS a business afterall. The problem I have with this way of doing it is that:A. It's the exact same ad every time and it's just various actors from the promoted series' shown on screen as music plays and the show titles are displayed. No scenes from the promoted shows to give a ""taste"" of why you might like that series, nor even an explaination of what the individual shows are about. In other words it's like a bad music video. I am truly at a loss as to why they thought making it so uninformative AND unskippable was a wise marketing tactic?B. Since you have to wait for the ad to finish before watching the episodes, it might weaken the enjoyment people have for this season; a season they paid to watch!If that was all that I felt displeased about, I might have given it 4 stars. There is another gripe that I have though. And it is this...Some of the ""bonus"" features stated on the packaging can ONLY be played by putting the disk into your computer's DVD drive. While this is not an uncommon thing, it IS misleading to not state it on the packaging. Plus, you are required to use additional software to view them! So how is this a ""bonus"" when it's not technically on the disk in the first place? I would have been much more pleased if they had simply stated on the packaging something like: ""Insert Disk 4 into your computer's DVD-ROM and get access to the following Bonus Features.""

His antagonist, Sgt Doakes, gets off, then back on Dexter's case. It will begin a showdown of significance. We learn more about some of the characters, including Dexter's foster dad, and his sister Deb gets to have (another) romance. Not a serial killer this time.Dexter also develops a new relationship with a woman who has an affinity for things dark and dangerous. Is she his soulmate? The consequences of this relationship ripple into the lives of Dexter's loved ones, including Rita and her kids.Keith Carradine comes into the cast as an FBI expert on serial killers, one with a bit of a zen vibe.

The second season of Showtime's Dexter not only improves on an excellent debut season, but blows it out of the water.  As the second season opens, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) has some problems.  Doakes (Erik King) knows something is suspicious with him and is keeping on his trail, making Dexter's ritual of killing bad people even harder than ever to get away with.  Making matters worse is the discovery of Dexter's dumping spot in the ocean, which leads to Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine) coming on the scene.  Not to mention that Dexter's relationship with Rita (Julie Benz) is very much on the rocks, especially when he meets a woman named Lila (Jamie Murray) who is much more akin to Dexter's persona.  In the meantime, Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) has become a changed person since her experience with the Ice Truck Killer, and when revelations about their father Harry's (James Remar) past come to light, Dexter begins to question everything there is about himself, including the code that Harry instilled in him.  Loaded with some inventive twists and turns, the second season of Dexter is some of the absolute best premium TV you will ever see, and certainly the best thing to ever grace Showtime.

If you haven't already met Dexter Morgan (played by Michael C. Hall), he's a Miami police forensic expert - he specialises in blood spatter - with a taste for murder all of his own. By twist of tale, Dexter's past comes back to haunt him this season and Dexter the hunter becomes Dexter the hunted. This takes the excitement and suspense up to new heights.Dexter is still coming to terms with the season one's shock ending and initially finds (to his horror) that his killing skills are not what they used to be. And as if he didn't have enough worries, Sergeant Doakes (played by the lovely Erik King), the only one around who senses that Dexter is not all that he seems, is still very much on his case. Add to that the fact that his sister Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter), who is still recovering from her own trauma from season one, is asked to join the FBI manhunt for him. The team is being led by Special Agent Lundy (played by Keith Carradine) and this is a development, Dexter remarks sardonically, that ""makes for an awkward family dynamic"".Also very interesting to see this season, is the relationship between just-demoted Lt. Maria Laguerta (played by the brilliant Lauren Velez) and the new Lieutenant parachuted in over her head to take over her shift command, Lt. Esme Pasquale (played by Judith Scott). The cracks in Dexter's seemingly perfect relationship with girlfriend Rita (played by Julie Benz) that began to appear in season one, also begin to get wider this season so look out for Jaime Murray, fresh off her stint on BBC's drama ""Hustle"", playing the sexy, free-spirited Lila.There's much more but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Twists and turns abound and each episode seems to bring a new shock for the viewer to take in. The humour is dark but it is hysterically funny - a shock in itself, considering the over-arching subject matter. Unless you're someone who gets squeamish easily (most of the violence is implied rather than shown but there's still violence and there's still plenty of blood) this is a definite must-see.

I thought the first season was excellent but this one just about surpassed it.  The twists and turns, and not to mention unpredictable directions of the characters growth just made it for very irresistible entertainment.I loved Michael C. Hall's portrayal of Dexter.  He is so completely different than the character he portrayed in ""Six Feet Under"", hard to believe that such different characters were played by the same actor.  And this season they deepen his relationship with his sister (Jennifer Carpenter) and Rita (Julie Benz), both of whom I found much more appealing than the way they are portrayed in the book (I know some people are annoyed by both women).  And also Lauren Valez's character is also much more sympathetic on the show than in the (first) book.  David Zayas and C.S. Lee are a hoot.  But best of all Erik King is a great nemesis for Dexter, hounding him and matching every move our beloved Dexter makes.This season starts off with the discovery by treasure hunters of Dexter's lair and all the bodies that he has sliced up come to surface.  Soon the FBI (led by Keith Carradine) is involved in the investigation, and everyone is looking for the Bay Harbor Butcher, including Dexter himself.  In the home front little sis is recovering from her traumatic attack that closed season I, while Dexter's relation with Rita leads him to seek a recovery program for his ""addiction"".  It is during the recovery program that Dexter will also meet the mysterious Lila who will become his ""sponsor"".  The plot threads are all laid in place and soon they intertwine for one explosive finale as everything and everyone seems to zero in on the Bay Harbor Butcher.Most everything about this show was great but I had a couple observations.  The first one was that I was annoyed by the way the character of Lila was played (or directed), she seemed to have stepped out of Ruth Rendell's more bizarre psycho novels into Dexter's Miami.  She just stuck out like a sore thumb, even if she served to further the plot.  Another one was the sex on the show.  For those easily offended you have been forwarned.  (Read the reviews from HBO's ""True Blood"").And finally as much as I loved this show I had two serious objections: (1) This thing did not have any subtitles English or any other language.  C'mon how am I supposed to recommend this to my hearing impaired friends?  Sheesh!  I will just have to warn them to stay away from any SHOWTIME DVD since they seem to be so cheap...and continuing on cheap...(2) The lack of any features in the bonus section.  The boxes promise this and that, blah blah blah, and basically there is almost nothing.  Totally cheap presentation.

1099713,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000V86OKG,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[6, 10]","LAST SEASON ON DEXTER:Just to bring you up to speed, you really must catch last season, but for those who insist on jumping to S2, a recap:  We meet Dexter Morgan, affable man-about-sin city (Miami).  A professional analyst for Miami homicide detectives, Dexter moonlights as a not-so-mild mannered serial killer himself.  His victims are criminals themselves - murderers who have slipped through the fingers of sloppy detectives and prosecutors.  While Dex brings a rarified sense of justice to both of his occupations, we are also told that Dexter's homicidal tendencies are more instinct than vindictive - Dex is driven to kill, and Miami's stock of untouchable murderers keeps him at saw's length from the rest of us.  No one suspects that Dex is responsible for a one-man murder wave - Dexter is well able to hide the evidence that a serial killer is on the loose (at least in S1).  Even the women in his life - his angelic girlfriend Rita, and his potty-mouthed sister Deborah - are fooled.  Only Harry Morgan, his loving, adoptive father, understands what Dexter is capable of.  A decorated detective, Captain Morgan schooled Dexter in the ways of uncatchable killers - creating ""The Code of Harry"".  However, Dexter soon finds himself competing with a horrific serial killer who uses flash-freezing to reduce his victims to broken shapes looking like broken dolls.  Dubbed ""The Ice Truck Killer"", the mystery man not only eludes the police, but soon homes in on Dexter - our hero's secret is not well kept.  Far from feeling terrified, Dexter welcomes the homicidal companionship, and homes in on ITK not so much to apprehend him as to better understand himself.TONIGHT ON DEXTER:""It's going to happen again"", Dexter narrates, much as he did in the last season's premier.  Only now, things have changed.  Unlike other shows that build up the pressure, then end with some closure, the opener manages to pick up where last season's finale left off.  Both Dexter and Deb are emotionally scarred in learning ITK's true identity.  Worse, in pursuing ITK alone, Dexter has attracted the attentions of Detective=Sergeant Doakes, an Army Special Forces Vet with his own killer instincts.  Openly hostile to Dexter, Doakes now has a reason to hunt him down.  And worst of all, Scuba divers in Bay Harbour locate an undersea graveyard - we know it as Dexter's dumping ground, but for everybody else, it's both the sign of a serial killer even worse than ITK and an SOS to federal authorities that Dexter can't end-run.  Dexter struggles to navigate both Feds and Doakes but, finally getting the chance for blood, finds he can't quite...rise to the occasion.  Things are also tricky with Rita, who suspects Dexter of railroading her ex-con husband back to jail on a parole violation.  There's also the romantic entanglements of Lila, a dark-minded artist who latches onto Dexter and proclaims him her soul-mate.  Already realizing doubts about Harry's honesty, and beginning to question ""The Code of Harry"", Dexter reaches into the depths of his bloodlust, and wonders if perhaps he can't find another way.  Season 2 has its share of great surprises, with many scenes that are as funny as they are insightful about our homicidal hero.""Dexter"" continues to be an awesome show.  Hardly perfect, you can appreciate what works instead of what doesn't.  Some plot threads don't come together, others are rushed together for closure.  But this is a great show for its characters - many who were just sidekick material last Season get the front-stage treatment here (except for Masuka - though, there's still Season 3).  Besides Doakes and Maria Laguerta, we still have Deb (don't make her angry, you wouldn't like her when she's angry; also, don't try to outrun her either), and Rita comes into her own as a force to be reckoned with as well.  The script tosses in Jaime Murray as the hot/scary Lila, and Keith Carradine as FBI Spec. Agent Lundy, the man sent in by the feds to nab ""The Bay Harbor Butcher"".  Billed by some of the Miami detectives as a rock-star of serial-killer hunters, Lundy comes off more like a really helpful and popular HS Teacher...who manages to latch onto Dexter's trail and Deb's heart.  With so many great moments, it's hard to pin down one of them - many of which are funny, twerrifying and heartbreaking at the same time.  In one critical sense, season 2 outstrips the first: Dexter is the only serial killer to fear (even if the rest of Miami begins to cheer more than fear, once they've discovered BHB's predilection for other murderers rather than innocent Floridians).  Now the sole monster, Dexter must confront his own demons and question the identity that has made him a killer.",4,"""You Have Reached Your Destination""",1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,4707,"['LAST', 'SEASON', 'ON', 'DEXTER', 'Just', 'bring', 'up', 'speed', 'really', 'must', 'catch', 'last', 'season', 'who', 'insist', 'jumping', 'S2', 'recap', 'meet', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'affable', 'man-about-sin', 'city', 'Miami', 'professional', 'analyst', 'Miami', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'Dexter', 'moonlights', 'not-so-mild', 'mannered', 'serial', 'killer', 'victims', 'are', 'criminals', 'murderers', 'who', 'have', 'slipped', 'fingers', 'sloppy', 'detectives', 'prosecutors', 'Dex', 'rarified', 'sense', 'justice', 'occupations', 'are', 'also', 'told', 'Dexter', 'homicidal', 'tendencies', 'are', 'more', 'instinct', 'vindictive', 'Dex', 'driven', 'kill', 'Miami', 'stock', 'untouchable', 'murderers', 'keeps', 'saw', 'length', 'rest', 'one', 'Dex', 'responsible', 'one-man', 'murder', 'wave', 'Dexter', 'well', 'able', 'hide', 'evidence', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'least', 'S1', 'Even', 'women', 'life', 'angelic', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'potty-mouthed', 'sister', 'Deborah', 'are', 'fooled', 'Only', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'loving', 'adoptive', 'father', 'what', 'Dexter', 'capable', 'decorated', 'detective', 'Captain', 'Morgan', 'schooled', 'Dexter', 'ways', 'uncatchable', 'killers', 'creating', 'Code', 'Harry', 'However', 'Dexter', 'soon', 'competing', 'horrific', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'flash-freezing', 'reduce', 'victims', 'broken', 'shapes', 'looking', 'broken', 'dolls', 'Dubbed', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'mystery', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'police', 'soon', 'homes', 'Dexter', 'hero', 'secret', 'not', 'well', 'kept', 'Far', 'feeling', 'terrified', 'Dexter', 'homicidal', 'companionship', 'homes', 'ITK', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'apprehend', 'better', 'understand', 'himself.TONIGHT', 'ON', 'DEXTER', 'going', 'happen', 'again', 'Dexter', 'much', 'did', 'last', 'season', 'premier', 'Only', 'now', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'other', 'shows', 'build', 'up', 'pressure', 'then', 'end', 'closure', 'opener', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'season', 'finale', 'left', 'off', 'Dexter', 'Deb', 'are', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'learning', 'ITK', 'true', 'identity', 'Worse', 'pursuing', 'ITK', 'alone', 'Dexter', 'attracted', 'attentions', 'Detective=Sergeant', 'Doakes', 'Army', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Vet', 'own', 'killer', 'instincts', 'Openly', 'hostile', 'Dexter', 'Doakes', 'now', 'reason', 'hunt', 'down', 'worst', 'Scuba', 'divers', 'Bay', 'Harbour', 'locate', 'undersea', 'graveyard', 'know', 'Dexter', 'dumping', 'ground', 'everybody', 'else', 'sign', 'serial', 'killer', 'even', 'worse', 'ITK', 'SOS', 'federal', 'authorities', 'Dexter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end-run', 'Dexter', 'navigate', 'Feds', 'Doakes', 'finally', 'getting', 'chance', 'blood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rise', 'occasion', 'Things', 'are', 'also', 'tricky', 'Rita', 'who', 'Dexter', 'railroading', 'ex-con', 'husband', 'back', 'jail', 'parole', 'violation', 'also', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'Lila', 'dark-minded', 'artist', 'who', 'Dexter', 'soul-mate', 'Already', 'realizing', 'doubts', 'Harry', 'honesty', 'beginning', 'question', 'Code', 'Harry', 'Dexter', 'depths', 'bloodlust', 'wonders', 'perhaps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'Season', '2', 'share', 'great', 'surprises', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'funny', 'are', 'insightful', 'homicidal', 'hero', 'Dexter', 'be', 'awesome', 'show', 'Hardly', 'perfect', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'instead', 'what', ""n't"", 'plot', 'threads', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'others', 'are', 'rushed', 'together', 'closure', 'great', 'show', 'characters', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'sidekick', 'material', 'last', 'Season', 'get', 'front-stage', 'treatment', 'here', 'Masuka', 'though', 'still', 'Season', '3', 'Doakes', 'Maria', 'Laguerta', 'still', 'have', 'Deb', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'angry', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'angry', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'outrun', 'either', 'Rita', 'own', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'Jaime', 'Murray', 'hot/scary', 'Lila', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'FBI', 'Spec', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'man', 'sent', 'feds', 'nab', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'Billed', 'Miami', 'detectives', 'rock-star', 'serial-killer', 'hunters', 'Lundy', 'off', 'more', 'really', 'helpful', 'popular', 'HS', 'Teacher', 'who', 'latch', 'Dexter', 'trail', 'Deb', 'heart', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'one', 'many', 'are', 'funny', 'twerrifying', 'heartbreaking', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'critical', 'sense', 'season', '2', 'first', 'Dexter', 'only', 'serial', 'killer', 'fear', 'even', 'rest', 'Miami', 'cheer', 'more', 'fear', 'once', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'BHB', 'predilection', 'other', 'murderers', 'rather', 'innocent', 'Floridians', 'Now', 'sole', 'monster', 'Dexter', 'must', 'confront', 'own', 'demons', 'question', 'identity', 'made', 'killer']",Dexter: Season 2

I send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and I never watched Dexter until the first two seasons came out on DVD? What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the series in like two weeks versus like 12 weeks per regular season. I think that we even watched three episodes in one night. Alas, season 3 started this week, and now it's one episode of Dexter one week at a time.So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO'sSix Feet Underfame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this ""stuff"" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.Add this bloody-good show to your cart.Season 1is just as good as season 2, so I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from the beginning.Buy both seasons, and get your Tivo going on season 3!",5,A Different Kind of CSI,1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,1697,"['Color', 'stupid', 'send', 'money', 'cable', 'company', 'subscribing', 'Showtime', 'never', 'watched', 'Dexter', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'out', 'Only', 'absolute', 'best', 'show', 'TV.How', 'good', 'Let', 'put', 'way', ""'m"", 'actually', 'glad', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'wife', 'were', 'able', 'watch', 'series', 'two', 'weeks', 'versus', '12', 'weeks', 'regular', 'season', 'think', 'even', 'watched', 'three', 'episodes', 'one', 'night', 'Alas', 'season', '3', 'started', 'week', 'now', 'one', 'episode', 'Dexter', 'one', 'week', 'time.So', 'certainly', 'one', 'good', 'things', 'Dexter', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'wait', '12', 'weeks', 'see', 'season', 'start', 'finish', 'certainly', 'best', 'thing', 'series', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'is.Dexter', 'played', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', ""HBO'sSix"", 'Feet', 'Underfame', 'blood', 'spatter', 'analyst', 'Miami', 'Homicide', 'job', 'help', 'solve', 'murders', 'also', 'moonlight', 'serial', 'killer', 'side', 'note', 'last', 'part.The', 'acting', 'show', 'terrific', 'thrills', 'twists', 'are', 'plentiful', 'Combine', 'nature', 'Dexter', 'professional', 'life', 'favorite', 'pass-time', 'can', 'bet', 'carotid', 'artery', 'plenty', 'blood', 'show', 'too', 'rest', 'assured', 'show', ""n't"", 'just', 'killing', 'Relationships', 'family', 'inner', 'working', 'homicide', 'squad', 'stuff', 'also', 'packed', 'neatly', 'Dexter', 'series', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time.Add', 'bloody-good', 'show', 'cart.Season', '1is', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'season', '2', 'so', ""'d"", 'strongly', 'urge', 'newcomers', 'start', 'beginning.Buy', 'seasons', 'get', 'Tivo', 'going', 'season', '3']",Dexter: Season 2

Dexter's development of more 3 dimensional morality, and through this, a much more realistic character, made me enjoy him and the show just as much. Yeah he has more ambivalence (for a while) in this season.  But in the end, as was clear, but less convincingly so, in Season 1, he is not a true psychopath.And I love the often slapstick, sick-humor (e.g. between Deb and Lila, and of course, from Dex's sex-obsessed lab boss), which alternates with subtle understated very funny lines and and actions by Dex, Doakes, Lila(e.g. her hilarious paintings and sculptures), sister Deb, and...just about everyone.I differ with some reviewers who say the love interests in this Season so strain our credulity, that they become one of the flaws that make Season II not as good as Season I.  I tend to believe they are just as believable (or unbelievable) as the romantic tangles of  Season I...if we can believe Rita can possibly still let loser ex-hubby Paul through her front door, and that Deb can lose her usual right-on instincts about who's a BS artist vs. who's a legit guy, in her choice of lover in Season 1, surely we can believe Dex's and Angel's being led by their proverbial ""male DNA"" to hang with (and over) ""vampire"" girl in Season II!Some reviewers also think the lower numbers of vigilante executions by Dex in this season are another mark of its lower status compared with Season I. But while Dexter is diverted by several potential big threats to his cover, and thus away from keeping up his vigilante ""count"", those missions he does complete in Season II are developed more, with resulting greater heights of ""dealing out justice"" than those in Season I.  And each of the two grand finale, long-time coming, executions that complete Dex's quest in both I and II,deliver an equally satisfying punch in my mind!  Well, both seasons are great...and worth your time if like me, you come to love Dex, and to want to stroke his sexy boyish face, and root for him to find his way to a less tortured life!So Judge (or suspend judgment) for yourself, and watch this very satisfying ""dark comedy""",5,"Less vigilante satisfaction, more 3 D human Dexter",1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,2175,"['Dexter', 'Season', 'II', 'was', 'just', 'satisfying', 'super', 'cool', 'Season', '1', 'Dexter', 'development', 'more', '3', 'dimensional', 'morality', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'character', 'made', 'enjoy', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Yeah', 'more', 'ambivalence', 'while', 'season', 'end', 'was', 'clear', 'less', 'convincingly', 'so', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'true', 'psychopath.And', 'love', 'often', 'slapstick', 'sick-humor', 'e.g', 'Deb', 'Lila', 'course', 'Dex', 'sex-obsessed', 'lab', 'boss', 'subtle', 'understated', 'very', 'funny', 'lines', 'actions', 'Dex', 'Doakes', 'Lila', 'e.g', 'hilarious', 'paintings', 'sculptures', 'sister', 'Deb', 'just', 'everyone.I', 'differ', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'love', 'interests', 'Season', 'so', 'strain', 'credulity', 'become', 'one', 'flaws', 'make', 'Season', 'II', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Season', 'I.', 'tend', 'believe', 'are', 'just', 'believable', 'unbelievable', 'romantic', 'tangles', 'Season', 'can', 'believe', 'Rita', 'can', 'possibly', 'still', 'let', 'loser', 'ex-hubby', 'Paul', 'front', 'door', 'Deb', 'can', 'lose', 'usual', 'right-on', 'instincts', 'who', 'BS', 'artist', 'vs.', 'who', 'legit', 'guy', 'choice', 'lover', 'Season', '1', 'surely', 'can', 'believe', 'Dex', 'Angel', 'being', 'led', 'proverbial', 'male', 'DNA', 'hang', 'over', 'vampire', 'girl', 'Season', 'II', 'reviewers', 'also', 'think', 'lower', 'numbers', 'vigilante', 'executions', 'Dex', 'season', 'are', 'mark', 'lower', 'status', 'compared', 'Season', 'Dexter', 'diverted', 'several', 'potential', 'big', 'threats', 'cover', 'thus', 'away', 'keeping', 'up', 'vigilante', 'count', 'missions', 'complete', 'Season', 'II', 'are', 'developed', 'more', 'resulting', 'greater', 'heights', 'dealing', 'out', 'justice', 'Season', 'two', 'grand', 'finale', 'long-time', 'coming', 'executions', 'complete', 'Dex', 'quest', 'II', 'deliver', 'equally', 'satisfying', 'punch', 'mind', 'Well', 'seasons', 'are', 'great', 'time', 'come', 'love', 'Dex', 'want', 'stroke', 'sexy', 'boyish', 'face', 'root', 'find', 'way', 'less', 'tortured', 'life', 'So', 'Judge', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'yourself', 'watch', 'very', 'satisfying', 'dark', 'comedy']",Dexter: Season 2

Following on from where the last series left off this still has Dexter killing off those murderers who have gotten away with their crimes, but where as in the first series the underlying story was the Ice Truck Killer, in this series it is the hunt for Dexter himself (dubbed the Bay Harbour Butcher) that keeps us engrossed and on the edge of our seats. There is so much tension from this story alone that after watching a couple of episodes you will want to keep watching and watching 'just one more episode' until you reach the end of the series. I could not stop watching this until I reached the shattering conclusion and this is as good as, if not better than, the first series. My reservations about the initial series, I.e. the poor acting from both the actors playing Deb and Doakes, is not an issue this time round and they both play their parts perfectly. My only gripe this time is the character called Lila, who's sounds like she has a terrible 'put on' British accent despite this being her actual accent, and it drives me mad whenever she is on the screen. There are so many twists and turns that you are kept guessing throughout about how various storylines will unfold and each plot avenue is eventually tied up expertly and leaves you satisfied. It is hard to mention each plot aspect without spoiling the ending, but believe me this is well worth watching if you are a fan of the first series and it will leave you desperately awaiting the third. There is a 5th disc of extras which include cast interviews, stills from the series, trivia, features on the title music, Harry's Code, Dexter's Knives and more besides. These really add to the overall package and give a deeper insight into the series. Overall this has more great acting, storylines and intrigue that the series' are becoming renowned for and makes for captivating and addictive viewing.

However, the images of chopped up bodies made this a show that I will have to pass on and deleted from my unbox player to make sure young children don't see it accidently.

Hall on Six Feet Under when it ended...and I am SO glad I did! It has become the most addictive series I have ever watched on television...period! I watched the first season at a one or two episode pace till the season was done...but the second season was so different and edge of your seat thrilling, that I had to finish it as soon as possible! I love how the writers make you LOVE and empathize with a serial killer.You want him to succeed and get away with everything he does. I was sad to see a major character killed off for plot's sake at the end...but understand how it was necessary to lead to the final act of murder that Dexter needed to commit to tie up this season perfectly. Now my question is HOW on earth will the third season keep up the wonderful momentum and in what direction will they take Dexter now?I can't wait to see...but will probably have to until the third season is available for purchase...and then it will be a marathon viewing!",5,Dexter is the new drug of choice,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,1128,"['What', 'amazing', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'subscribe', 'Showtime', 'purchased', 'first', 'season', 'whim', 'based', 'partly', 'reviews', 'partly', 'missed', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Six', 'Feet', 'when', 'ended', 'am', 'SO', 'glad', 'did', 'become', 'most', 'addictive', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'television', 'period', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'episode', 'pace', 'season', 'was', 'done', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrilling', 'had', 'finish', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'love', 'how', 'writers', 'make', 'LOVE', 'empathize', 'serial', 'killer.You', 'want', 'succeed', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'major', 'character', 'killed', 'off', 'plot', 'sake', 'end', 'understand', 'how', 'was', 'necessary', 'lead', 'final', 'act', 'murder', 'Dexter', 'needed', 'commit', 'tie', 'up', 'season', 'perfectly', 'Now', 'question', 'HOW', 'earth', 'will', 'third', 'season', 'keep', 'wonderful', 'momentum', 'what', 'direction', 'will', 'take', 'Dexter', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'third', 'season', 'available', 'purchase', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'marathon', 'viewing']",Dexter: Season 2

1099730,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B000V86OKG,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[0, 0]","When I first heard about Dexter, I had no idea what to make of it. A show about a killer who works with the police killing killers for killing? That people liked? Sounded like a complete Hot Topic crowd pleaser. Then, I watched season one. And season two. Twice. Suffice it to say, Dexter is now my favorite non-Supernatural show on television, and possibly one of the greatest shows in recent memory.No small order when you look at other recent mega-hits.The show centers around the titular Dexter Morgan, played brilliantly by Michael C. Hall. The first season found Dexter tracking (and ultimately killing) the infamous Ice Truck Killer, so what happens from there? Thankfully, rather than approach a Killer of the Year type progression, the creators instead decided to evolve Dexter in season 2. The season begins with someone locating Dexter's dumping ground, putting the whole country into panic over finding the ""Bay Harbor Butcher."" The FBI dispatches an agent named Lundy (who is the L to Dexter's Kira) and the game is on.Unlike the first season, season 2 is a lot more cerebral in nature and we're treated to Dexter learning more about who he is, and why he does what he does. This is in no small part thanks to one of his new acquaintances, Lila, a former meth addict from England. Lila helps Dexter understand the dark within him, and watching his facial expressions and actions as he begins to realize he can control his own destiny and make his own rules shows why Michael C. Hall is one of the top actors on television today.Despite the fantastic, timeless performance of Hall and his supporting cast, the true star of Dexter is the writing. It's rare to see this much writing talent on a TV show, let alone this much talent remaining this consistent. I would argue that in recent television, only the middle portions of The Office come close in terms of writing, but unlike that show Dexter grows more gripping and entertaining as the seasons progress.It's easy to tell when watching the show that the entire cast-from top to bottom-cares greatly about delivering a perfect product, which is something you sadly don't see too often these days. From no cliff-hangers to constant grittiness and realism in lieu of product placement and nods to other properties, Dexter is a show for people who like television, a good story, or seeing fantastic acting. If there's one downside to this season two release, it's that the studio doesn't quite show as much enthusiasm as the crew. Rather than features fans care about, we're left instead with episodes from other Showtime originals (two of which are from the second seasons of shows, making them pointless for non-fans). It's a travesty we don't have many of the features fans asked for, but don't let that keep you from getting the set, because the show itself more than makes up for it.For those who watched engrossed as Dexter tracked down the Ice Truck Killer in season one, purchasing season two is a no-brainer. It's better in every way, and shows that there's really no predicting how great this series will turn out. For those who haven't watched Dexter yet, do yourself a favor: ignore any hesitancies, and go buy seasons one and two so you can catch up before season three starts later this month.Years from now, people will be comparing Dexter to other classic shows like The Wire, The Sopranos, and 24.

It's a highly addictive show, and I couldn't wait for Season 2.I heard some people saying it wasn't as good as the first one, and I MUST disagree with them. Dexter just gets better and better. For one thing, it was different from Lindsey'sbooks, which is SO much better than following the series with each novel. It takes Dexter in a different direction, opening up new worlds and experiences for the characters, allowing us to get a different aspect on some of the characters. And I stayed up late, losing much sleep, because I wanted to see what happened next. And with the season finale, it didn't leave with any rediculous cliffhanger for the next season...unlike the finale forTrue Blood, which left a cliffhanger that works fine between episodes, but just SUCKS when having to wait another year!!Now, to explain why I gave this GREAT SHOW 3 stars:I'm VERY upset with Showtime's features on this show. There were NO deleted scenes, NO behind the scenes footage, NO commentary at at!! Only a few of the actor's bios and a handful of pics. There was plenty of room for it, but Showtime just felt it necessary to promote its other shows instead. For a sneak peak atSeason 3, you have to buy another series of Showtime programming (forget which one since I was so annoyed!!) to get the first episode. And for any other ""extras"" on Dexter, visit the Showtime website. I did this anyhow (before watching the series) and found a few flash-games.

1099736,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B000V86OKG,Todd Bartholomew,"[0, 0]","While Season One of ""Dexter"" ended in a seemingly neat tidy bundle there were unanswered questions: would Dexter kill again, would the secret of Dexter's past come to light, were Dexter's victims about to start coming to the surface?  Having dispatched the Ice Truck Killer, it would seem Dexter had found some peace, but instead he's as troubled as ever.  Worse still, his nemesis Detective Doakes (played with icy intensity by Erik King) will give him no quarter.  Dexter's problems start surfacing quite quickly and quite literally as the season begins and his problems only compound from there.  The FBI arrives to complicate matters, Dexter's problems with Rita and her ex-husband come to a head, and it seems even Dexter's sister Deb may be turning on him.  The ever-present Detective Doakes looms large and there's a twist: Dexter is in Narcotics Anonymous but he isn't an addict. Or is he?  It's hard to describe much of the season without giving away plot lines and spoiling the stunning season finale.  As before, has Dexter escaped his past cleanly?  Has he left a clue behind that will expose him? Has he continued to commit the perfect crimes or has he slipped up?  Will he kill again?""Dexter"" clearly falls in to the category of public fascination with vigilantism and revenge, whether it's the ""Death Wish"" series with Charles Bronson or subway killer Bernard Goetz.  In many respects ""Dexter"" pays homage to the psychological thrillers of Hitchock and Poe as it does to the pulp fiction of the 1950s and the ""Dirty Harry"" series.  In the process we come to question our own sense of right and wrong, of vengeance and forgiveness.  Are we really like Dexter or are we truly all that different?  ""Dexter"" has probably one of the best ensemble casts on television and the writing is first rate.  While not ostensibly a gore-fest, ""Dexter"" can be a tad more graphic or violent than some viewers would like.  I've found it to be riveting and compelling viewing for its profoundly revelatory exploration of our deeper darker emotions and beliefs; a journey that may ultimately be more disturbing but also cathartic and revealing.",5,Questioning the nature of good and evil continues,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,2139,"['Season', 'One', 'Dexter', 'ended', 'seemingly', 'neat', 'tidy', 'bundle', 'were', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'would', 'Dexter', 'kill', 'again', 'would', 'secret', 'Dexter', 'past', 'come', 'light', 'were', 'Dexter', 'victims', 'start', 'coming', 'surface', 'Having', 'dispatched', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'would', 'seem', 'Dexter', 'had', 'found', 'peace', 'instead', 'as', 'troubled', 'ever', 'Worse', 'still', 'nemesis', 'Detective', 'Doakes', 'played', 'icy', 'intensity', 'Erik', 'King', 'will', 'give', 'quarter', 'Dexter', 'problems', 'start', 'surfacing', 'quite', 'quickly', 'quite', 'literally', 'season', 'problems', 'only', 'compound', 'there', 'FBI', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Dexter', 'problems', 'Rita', 'ex-husband', 'come', 'head', 'even', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Deb', 'may', 'be', 'turning', 'ever-present', 'Detective', 'Doakes', 'large', 'twist', 'Dexter', 'Narcotics', 'Anonymous', ""n't"", 'addict', 'hard', 'describe', 'much', 'season', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'lines', 'spoiling', 'stunning', 'season', 'finale', 'before', 'Dexter', 'escaped', 'past', 'cleanly', 'left', 'clue', 'will', 'expose', 'continued', 'commit', 'perfect', 'crimes', 'slipped', 'up', 'Will', 'kill', 'again', 'Dexter', 'clearly', 'category', 'public', 'fascination', 'vigilantism', 'revenge', 'Death', 'Wish', 'series', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'subway', 'killer', 'Bernard', 'Goetz', 'many', 'respects', 'Dexter', 'homage', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'Hitchock', 'Poe', 'pulp', 'fiction', '1950s', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'series', 'process', 'come', 'question', 'own', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'vengeance', 'forgiveness', 'Are', 'really', 'Dexter', 'are', 'truly', 'different', 'Dexter', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'television', 'writing', 'first', 'rate', 'not', 'ostensibly', 'gore-fest', 'Dexter', 'can', 'be', 'tad', 'more', 'graphic', 'violent', 'viewers', 'would', 'like', ""'ve"", 'found', 'be', 'riveting', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'profoundly', 'revelatory', 'exploration', 'deeper', 'darker', 'emotions', 'beliefs', 'journey', 'may', 'ultimately', 'be', 'more', 'disturbing', 'also', 'cathartic', 'revealing']",Dexter: Season 2

This makes Dexter feel cornered, but not as cornered as the things that dealing with Rita's ex make him feel. she insists on a 12-step program and he finally goes, meeting a force called Lila in the process. Lila makes Dexter a promise that she will heal him, too, and he hopes everything he hears is true. along with that are troubles that involve Doakes, the man who killed his mother, control, and a sister that is climbing the ladder as she works toward that detective badge.In the second season, Dexter picks up where it left off and adds in quite a few twists and turns that I didn't expect. The Rita's-ex situation has some ripples that I didn't see coming, and those ripples has some negative impacts and some positives that pay off big time. There is also the thing with the Bay Harbor Butcher case that cause so many conflicts in Dexter's life, and that lead to something that I didn't see coming. As with everything else in the series, the acting is great and the character development keeps on keeping on, making things all-the-more beautiful when it comes to the show. Also added to this is the exploration of Deb and the way that she gets over what took place last season, making things interesting - to say the least. Adding to all of this is the way that the killings are done in such artistic fashion, plus the fact that we find out more about Harry and about Dexter's past - namely his mother. This brings up some serious question in Dexter's mind and it starts something that is a big odd - seeing Harry as some type of mixed conscience/ reminder of what Harry was in Dexter's life, bringing so many things to the surface. Personally I love seeing Keith Carradine come in and play special Agent Lundy, and i love the way that the BHB case develops. It has its turns and it has its near scrapes, and it has Dexter wondering about everything in his life. If anything, it makes him feel all-the-more real.If you missed Season 1, go back and catch it. If you loved the first Season, rush out and see this without regret. Just bring enough supplies to keep you going through all of the episodes because, like all good things, you won't want to leave the television without knowing what will happen to Dexter and the people that surround him. This is a first-rate program, enjoyable to the core, and warrants more than one viewing just to catch the various killroom set-ups, the plot twists and the hidden pieces, and everything else that season 1 showed us Dexter could be.

1099740,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000V86OKG,trebe,"[1, 1]","The second season of Dexter, Showtime's crime drama about a Miami serial killer, explores new territory and continues to be very compelling and interesting, though perhaps not particularly realistic.  What follows assumes some familiarity with events in season one.  If you don't mind some major spoilers, from the first two seasons, free to continue.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) was traumatized as a child by seeing his mother murdered, and then chopped to pieces by a chainsaw.  He was adopted by Harry Morgan (James Remar), a cop who discovered the boy sitting a pool of his mother's blood.  When Harry discovered that Dexter had an abnormal desire to kill, he channeled those homicidal urges, so that Dexter would only take the lives of criminals who ""deserved"" to die.  Dexter, who is employed as a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, ceremoniously kills his victims, and then cuts up the bodies before disposing of them at sea.Season One concluded with the death of Dexter's brother Brian, who also had a similar propensity for homicide, and nearly murdered Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter).  Season Two picks up about a month later, where a traumatized Debra has moved into Dexter's apartment.  The stuff hits the fan, when the submerged remains of Dexter's many executions are discovered, and FBI agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine) is brought in to head a special task force investigating the ""Bay Harbor Killer"".Season Two finds Dexter Morgan off balance and under pressure, facing all kinds of crisis, with members of his own department closing in on him.  Dexter's relationship with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) reaches a critical point, when Rita's ex-husband is killed in prison.  Believing that Dexter is a drug addict, Rita insists that he get into a treatment program, where Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) becomes his sponsor.  She's an eccentric and totally unrealistic character, who is magnetically drawn to Dexter, and seems to have some insight into his dark nature.Dexter discovers more about the relationship between his mother and Harry, and the man who murdered his mother, but his biggest problem is Detective James Doakes (Erik King) who won't give up trying to discover what Dexter's secret is.  When he does, it creates a moral crisis that Dexter struggles to find an answer to.The dark brooding character from Season One becomes more ""human"" as Dexter becomes closer to Rita and her children.  With family matters placing more demands on his time, and his involvement with the psycho bitch that is Lila, Dexter has almost no time even try and save his own skin.  Torn between two women, he's losing control of his life and taking big risks, leaving a dead body unattended for days, and then Doakes a prisoner in a cage.It would be hard to top the twistedness of the ""ice truck killer"" from season one, but the writers come close, with the master manipulator Lila Tournay, and her warped possessive selfishness.  The reality factor isn't high, and some of the characters and storylines are starting to become predictable, but Dexter remains a very entertaining program, with skillful writing that somehow leads you to care about a murderer.  The acting remains top draw, as Michael C. Hall is pressed into bringing more to the role of Dexter than just a cold-hearted killer.  The whole cast is excellent, with Keith Carradine, Jaime Murray (Warehouse 13), and Erik King, perhaps shining a little brighter.  As with the first season, the most disappointing thing about the DVD set is the lack of substantial and topical bonus material.For most of the second season, Dexter is on the defensive trying to survive.  It's a tense and dangerous situation, that gets to be a strain after a while, that frankly isn't as much fun as the first season.  It's like Dexter is being drained of energy, and it's a real relief to see it come to a decisive close at the end.  This sets the stage for Dexter to resume the offensive in Season Three, and get back to doing what he does best.  Break out the tape, plastic wrap, and knife set.",4,scrambling on the defensive...,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,4080,"['second', 'season', 'Dexter', 'Showtime', 'crime', 'drama', 'Miami', 'serial', 'killer', 'new', 'territory', 'be', 'very', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'though', 'perhaps', 'not', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'What', 'familiarity', 'events', 'season', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'major', 'spoilers', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'free', 'continue.Dexter', 'Morgan', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'was', 'traumatized', 'child', 'seeing', 'mother', 'murdered', 'then', 'chopped', 'pieces', 'chainsaw', 'was', 'adopted', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Remar', 'cop', 'who', 'discovered', 'boy', 'sitting', 'pool', 'mother', 'blood', 'When', 'Harry', 'discovered', 'Dexter', 'had', 'abnormal', 'desire', 'kill', 'channeled', 'homicidal', 'urges', 'Dexter', 'would', 'only', 'take', 'lives', 'criminals', 'who', 'deserved', 'die', 'Dexter', 'who', 'employed', 'blood', 'spatter', 'expert', 'Miami', 'police', 'ceremoniously', 'victims', 'then', 'up', 'bodies', 'disposing', 'sea.Season', 'One', 'concluded', 'death', 'Dexter', 'brother', 'Brian', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'similar', 'propensity', 'homicide', 'nearly', 'murdered', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Debra', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Season', 'Two', 'up', 'month', 'later', 'where', 'traumatized', 'Debra', 'moved', 'Dexter', 'apartment', 'stuff', 'fan', 'when', 'submerged', 'Dexter', 'many', 'executions', 'are', 'discovered', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Frank', 'Lundy', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'brought', 'head', 'special', 'task', 'force', 'investigating', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Killer', '.Season', 'Two', 'finds', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'balance', 'pressure', 'facing', 'kinds', 'crisis', 'members', 'own', 'department', 'closing', 'Dexter', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Rita', 'Bennett', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'critical', 'point', 'when', 'Rita', 'ex-husband', 'killed', 'prison', 'Believing', 'Dexter', 'drug', 'addict', 'Rita', 'get', 'treatment', 'program', 'where', 'Lila', 'Tournay', 'Jaime', 'Murray', 'sponsor', 'eccentric', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'character', 'who', 'magnetically', 'drawn', 'Dexter', 'have', 'insight', 'dark', 'nature.Dexter', 'discovers', 'more', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Harry', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'mother', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Detective', 'James', 'Doakes', 'Erik', 'King', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'discover', 'what', 'Dexter', 'secret', 'When', 'moral', 'crisis', 'Dexter', 'find', 'answer', 'to.The', 'dark', 'brooding', 'character', 'Season', 'One', 'more', 'human', 'Dexter', 'closer', 'Rita', 'children', 'family', 'matters', 'placing', 'more', 'demands', 'time', 'involvement', 'psycho', 'bitch', 'Lila', 'Dexter', 'almost', 'time', 'even', 'try', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'Torn', 'two', 'women', 'losing', 'control', 'life', 'taking', 'big', 'risks', 'leaving', 'dead', 'body', 'unattended', 'days', 'then', 'prisoner', 'cage.It', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'top', 'twistedness', 'ice', 'truck', 'killer', 'season', 'one', 'writers', 'come', 'close', 'master', 'manipulator', 'Lila', 'Tournay', 'warped', 'possessive', 'selfishness', 'reality', 'factor', ""n't"", 'high', 'characters', 'storylines', 'are', 'starting', 'become', 'predictable', 'Dexter', 'very', 'entertaining', 'program', 'skillful', 'writing', 'somehow', 'care', 'murderer', 'acting', 'top', 'draw', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'pressed', 'bringing', 'more', 'role', 'Dexter', 'just', 'cold-hearted', 'killer', 'whole', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Jaime', 'Murray', 'Warehouse', '13', 'Erik', 'King', 'perhaps', 'shining', 'little', 'brighter', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'lack', 'substantial', 'topical', 'bonus', 'most', 'second', 'season', 'Dexter', 'defensive', 'trying', 'survive', 'tense', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'be', 'strain', 'while', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'season', 'Dexter', 'being', 'drained', 'energy', 'real', 'relief', 'see', 'come', 'decisive', 'close', 'end', 'stage', 'Dexter', 'resume', 'offensive', 'Season', 'Three', 'get', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'Break', 'out', 'tape', 'plastic', 'wrap', 'knife', 'set']",Dexter: Season 2

However, there is a new antagonist, in the form of a very annoying British woman who calls herself Lila; Dexter meets her while faking a drug addiction in a 12 step program.  Also, we lose a major character and source of conflict, and others end up taking credit and getting promotions because they think he was the killer they had sought (you'll see what I mean when you watch).

The voting system here is about voting those reviews that helped you make a deicsion to buy something NOT if you agree or disagree...that said...on with the show).Dexter Morgan the vigilante serial killer who finds his impulse to kill channeled into ""good"" (killing the bad guys that get away)is one step away from Batman--both are disturbed and decide to deal out justice their own way and both just are striving for a normal life that eludes him something that is alluded to in a couple of episodes of the second season.The second season finds Dexter at odds with his own instincts. His relationship with Rita appears on the rocks and Doakes is still trailing Dexter trying to figure out what is ""wrong"" with him. When an FBI agent (Keith Carradine)takes an interest in his handiwork complicating his world. There's more challenges facing Dexter than ever during the second season as he stumbles towards his own strange sense of humanity.The show which is shot in Digital HD looks surprisingly good. Colors pop capturing the bright overripe look of Miami. Audio sounds good as well.The extras are a bit slimmer here--we get two episodes of the fine Showtime show ""Brotherhood"", text biographies, a photo gallery. There's also online access to a pair of episodes for ""The Tudors"" (2nd season) and ""Californification"". Unfortunately, we don't get any featurettes this time around nor any commentary tracks for the series but, hey, it's the quality of the shows and season that matter more than anything else. The extras are disappointing and considering you are paying for this it would be nice if they included something more substanial next time.I'd suggest to Showtime that NEXT time they include a featurette perhaps on a real FBI agent that hunts serial killers, perhaps an interview with the author of the original novel (Darkly Dreaming Dexter)focusing on the departure the show has taken from the novels or even a featurette with the actors discussing what attracted them to the roles in the first place.The show is a fascinating glimpse into the fractured psyche of Dexter, his sister and friends.

1099746,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000V86OKG,Wesley Mullins,"[63, 70]","Miami blood-spatter analyst and moonlighting serial killer Dexter Morgan spent the first season of Showtime's groundbreaking drama helping his police department track the Ice Truck Killer, a man who turned out to be the brother Dexter never knew.  In Season Two, he helps hunt someone even closer...himself.  When his Glad-bag graveyard is discovered at the bottom of the ocean, all of Miami buzzes about the Bay Harbor Butcher, the nocturnal crime fighter who litters the sea with body parts of bad guys.The search for the Bay Harbor Butcher (and the ensuing cat and mouse game between Dexter and his colleagues) provides the overarching glue for Season Two.  The middle episodes of the season feature the slippery Dexter trying to wiggle his way out of the grasp of the investigation, lead by new character FBI Special Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine), a professional everyman as unassuming as he is brilliant.  Lundy's dedication and focus rival Dexter's and present a challenge for our hero even greater than his ""game"" with the Ice Truck Killer.  Lundy's ritual and disciplined life of cucumber sandwich lunches and Chopin interludes clears his mind, giving him almost clairvoyance into the heart of his target.The second principle plot centers on Dexter's new love interest, Lila.  Early in the season, Dexter is able to explain away his erratic behavior to Doakes and Rita by pretending to be a recovering drug addict.  His relationship with his sultry and insightful sponsor sparks tension between Dexter and his girlfriend and forces Dexter into chambers of his mind that have been closed for decades.  In the arms of a troubled figure with a past nearly as dark as his own, Dexter feels understood for the first time.Dexter's ""improvements"" in rehab, coupled with the relentless investigation of him by Doakes causes a reduction in body count for Season Two.  Just as Season One established the winning formula of building a 12 episode serial plot accentuated with weekly self contained subplots with payoffs, Season Two also has small stories to keep the viewers entertained as the search for the Butcher continues.  The difference between Seasons One and Two is that these small plots don't always involve Dexter killing someone.  Season One almost had a reality-tv consistency with Dexter ""voting someone off the island"" each week.  But sometimes Season Two episode plots are about his relationships with Rita, Lila or Doakes.This is part of the more human Dexter presented in Season Two.  His conscience gets to him a few times; he underestimates one of his victim's strength and then walks into a trap; he routinely gets outsmarted by Lundy; and he's unable to control his feelings toward Rita and her kids.  He's come a long way from the unemotional science project of the first season.  The extra dimensions to his character and a season-long plot that amazingly trumps the edge-of-your-seat plight of Season One's Ice Truck Killer are only two reasons why the series has improved since its sublime debut season and now fills the void left by The Sopranos as television's finest hour.",5,No Sophomore Slump for America's Favorite Serial Killer,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,3098,"['Miami', 'blood-spatter', 'analyst', 'moonlighting', 'serial', 'killer', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'spent', 'first', 'season', 'Showtime', 'groundbreaking', 'drama', 'helping', 'police', 'department', 'track', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'brother', 'Dexter', 'never', 'knew', 'Season', 'Two', 'hunt', 'someone', 'even', 'closer', 'When', 'Glad-bag', 'graveyard', 'discovered', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'Miami', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'nocturnal', 'crime', 'fighter', 'who', 'sea', 'body', 'parts', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'search', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'ensuing', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Dexter', 'colleagues', 'overarching', 'glue', 'Season', 'Two', 'middle', 'episodes', 'season', 'feature', 'slippery', 'Dexter', 'trying', 'wiggle', 'way', 'grasp', 'investigation', 'lead', 'new', 'character', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lundy', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'professional', 'everyman', 'as', 'unassuming', 'brilliant', 'Lundy', 'dedication', 'focus', 'rival', 'Dexter', 'present', 'challenge', 'hero', 'even', 'greater', 'game', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'Lundy', 'ritual', 'disciplined', 'life', 'cucumber', 'sandwich', 'lunches', 'Chopin', 'mind', 'giving', 'almost', 'clairvoyance', 'heart', 'target.The', 'second', 'principle', 'plot', 'centers', 'Dexter', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Lila', 'Early', 'season', 'Dexter', 'able', 'explain', 'away', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'Doakes', 'Rita', 'pretending', 'be', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'relationship', 'sultry', 'insightful', 'sponsor', 'tension', 'Dexter', 'girlfriend', 'forces', 'Dexter', 'chambers', 'mind', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'decades', 'arms', 'troubled', 'figure', 'past', 'nearly', 'as', 'dark', 'own', 'Dexter', 'understood', 'first', 'time.Dexter', 'improvements', 'rehab', 'coupled', 'relentless', 'investigation', 'Doakes', 'reduction', 'body', 'count', 'Season', 'Two', 'Just', 'Season', 'One', 'established', 'winning', 'formula', 'building', '12', 'episode', 'serial', 'plot', 'accentuated', 'weekly', 'self', 'contained', 'subplots', 'payoffs', 'Season', 'Two', 'also', 'small', 'stories', 'keep', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'search', 'Butcher', 'difference', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'small', 'plots', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'involve', 'Dexter', 'killing', 'someone', 'Season', 'One', 'almost', 'had', 'reality-tv', 'consistency', 'Dexter', 'voting', 'someone', 'island', 'week', 'sometimes', 'Season', 'Two', 'episode', 'plots', 'are', 'relationships', 'Rita', 'Lila', 'Doakes.This', 'part', 'more', 'human', 'Dexter', 'presented', 'Season', 'Two', 'conscience', 'few', 'times', 'one', 'victim', 'strength', 'then', 'walks', 'trap', 'routinely', 'outsmarted', 'Lundy', 'unable', 'control', 'feelings', 'Rita', 'kids', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'unemotional', 'science', 'project', 'first', 'season', 'extra', 'dimensions', 'character', 'season-long', 'plot', 'amazingly', 'trumps', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'plight', 'Season', 'One', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'series', 'improved', 'sublime', 'debut', 'season', 'now', 'void', 'left', 'Sopranos', 'television', 'finest', 'hour']",Dexter: Season 2
1099747,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000V86OKG,Westley,"[2, 2]","The second season of ""Dexter"" is arguably even stronger than the first.  In particular, it avoids the three main debits of the debut season by (1) making Deb a much stronger character, (2) including fewer flashbacks with Dexter's father, and (3) avoiding a melodramatic season ending.  The season focuses mostly on Dexter's attempts to avoid capture.  Unfortunately for him, the remains of his victims have been found, and he's been dubbed the Bay Harbor Butcher (a sobriquet he hates).  The FBI is asked to assist the Miami police in the investigation, and Sergeant Doakes becomes even more suspicious of our favorite serial killer.  Everyone seems to be nipping at Dexter's heels.  Plus, in an amusing sideplot, he's having problems with Rita which leads him to start attending NA(!) and picking up a sponsor, the very creepy and overly sexual Lila (Jaime Murray).As in Season 1, the plots and situations are not always wholly believable and rely on quite a bit of luck.  However, the writing continues to be very strong, and the characters really gel together in this season.  The series continues to use its dark humor very effectively, especially as things spin out of control for Dexter.  I especially loved the brewing hatred between Deb and Lila.  Season 1 was a bit of a slow burner for me; it took me awhile to get into the series.  In contrast, Season 2 starts off exceedingly strong and remains of high quality.

Jen,"[0, 0]","I will be including major spoilers for season 1, so if you haven't watched it yet, please come back after you've seen it and have become an adamant fan. ;)With that out of the way, season 2 begins shortly after Dexter has dispensed his brand of justice to his elder brother Brian, and caught the unwavering attention of Sergeant James Doakes, an experienced African American cop who sees through Dexter's carefully crafted veneer. As a result, Dexter has kept his addiction in check for over a month. While the novel has Dexter lounging around at home, watching TV to bore Doakes out of his personal stakeouts, the series has him go bowling. For hours on end, with the rest of the Miami homicide team. This allows the side characters to get more limelight (although I would have loved to see Hall bring his monumental acting talents to show us his rendition of Dexter as a slob), which is, all in all, the right choice for a TV show. There is already plenty of inner monologue, and too much more would run a considerable risk of boring the viewer.The cliffhanger at the first episode's conclusion reveals Dexter's handiwork being discovered by divers not far offshore. Having never felt truly alive, the fear of capture and execute sets Dexter's heart pumping, and catapults us into the primary plot for this season - Dexter's efforts to keep the FBI off his trail while juggling his addiction and keeping Doakes at a comfortable distance. Subplots include Dexter digging into his and Harry's past (gleaning uncomfortable revelations concerning his biological mother and Harry), confessing an ""addiction"" to Rita (though the exact nature was obviously kept secret), and his sister Debra's paranoid nature following her treatment at the hands of the Ice Truck Killer and subsequent romantic entanglements.Maria is reinstated as Lieutenant early in season 2 (wouldn't want to lose a fan favourite, now would we?). She plays a major role in the Bay Harbor Butcher's investigation and is perhaps the most emotionally damaged individual by its conclusion.Evil personalities dispatched by Dexter this season include: a heartless and seductive car salesman, the moustachioed gang enforcer Little Chino, and one character that shares a deep bond with Dexter and how he became what he is today.",5,Retains Focus on Dexter Without Losing its Edge,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2285,"['will', 'be', 'including', 'major', 'spoilers', 'season', '1', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'please', 'come', 'back', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'become', 'adamant', 'fan', 'way', 'season', '2', 'begins', 'shortly', 'Dexter', 'dispensed', 'brand', 'justice', 'elder', 'brother', 'Brian', 'caught', 'unwavering', 'attention', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'Doakes', 'experienced', 'African', 'American', 'cop', 'who', 'Dexter', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'veneer', 'result', 'Dexter', 'kept', 'addiction', 'check', 'month', 'novel', 'Dexter', 'lounging', 'around', 'home', 'watching', 'TV', 'bore', 'Doakes', 'personal', 'stakeouts', 'series', 'go', 'bowling', 'hours', 'end', 'rest', 'Miami', 'homicide', 'team', 'side', 'characters', 'get', 'more', 'limelight', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Hall', 'bring', 'monumental', 'acting', 'talents', 'show', 'rendition', 'Dexter', 'slob', 'right', 'choice', 'TV', 'show', 'already', 'plenty', 'inner', 'monologue', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'run', 'considerable', 'risk', 'boring', 'viewer.The', 'cliffhanger', 'first', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'Dexter', 'handiwork', 'being', 'discovered', 'divers', 'not', 'far', 'offshore', 'Having', 'never', 'felt', 'truly', 'alive', 'fear', 'capture', 'execute', 'sets', 'Dexter', 'heart', 'pumping', 'catapults', 'primary', 'plot', 'season', 'Dexter', 'efforts', 'keep', 'FBI', 'trail', 'juggling', 'addiction', 'keeping', 'Doakes', 'comfortable', 'distance', 'Subplots', 'include', 'Dexter', 'digging', 'Harry', 'past', 'gleaning', 'uncomfortable', 'revelations', 'concerning', 'biological', 'mother', 'Harry', 'confessing', 'addiction', 'Rita', 'exact', 'nature', 'was', 'obviously', 'kept', 'secret', 'sister', 'Debra', 'paranoid', 'nature', 'following', 'treatment', 'hands', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'subsequent', 'romantic', 'entanglements.Maria', 'reinstated', 'Lieutenant', 'early', 'season', '2', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'fan', 'favourite', 'now', 'would', 'major', 'role', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'investigation', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'individual', 'conclusion.Evil', 'personalities', 'dispatched', 'Dexter', 'season', 'include', 'heartless', 'seductive', 'car', 'salesman', 'moustachioed', 'gang', 'enforcer', 'Little', 'Chino', 'one', 'character', 'shares', 'deep', 'bond', 'Dexter', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'today']",Dexter: Season 2
