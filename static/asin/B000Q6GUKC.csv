1073928,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B000Q6GUKC,Alric the Red,"[2, 2]","I haven't subscribed to Showtime in years, so I came to this party late.  I bought the first season on a recommendation, and while I liked it a good  bit, it seemed all a bit transparent.  It was too self-consciously quirky for it to get a hook deep in.  Characters are given droll dialogue that skims personalities, leaving out anything that couldn't be exploited for oddness.  It's the standard juxtaposition of relaxed hipness against the staid pettiness of self-righteousness, an in-your-face mockery of mainstream values already gainsaid by the basic naughtier truth.  Sometimes the stories went out of their way to find the most shocking scenario, skidding to a stop just short of offending anybody who might mount an effective complaint, even daring to show a nearly prepubescent girl locked in a lesbian puppy-love embrace.  This could be mistaken by the easily titillated for avant-garde television.  It doesn't seem so out-there to me, but is instead just plain fun to watch.  So by season's end, I concluded that the series was likable and entertaining, but unremarkable.  It finished with Nancy's business plan fully detailed, down to a division of labor.  Without a cliffhanger finale it felt complete and I didn't hurry to find out what happened next.  When I noticed this economically pricedComplete Second Seasonon Blu-ray, there was no reason not to follow Nancy's further adventures as TVs most enterprising MILF.The second season maintained the brisk pace of the first, the dialogue still distinguished by the skippy style.  Like in the first season, the tension we're supposed to feel in Nancy's conflict over her familial obligations as a role model and her illegal role-busting activities is never a convincing source of drama or comedy for me, and my attention wanders until we get back to the good stuff.  Other than that, the series has definitely improved, has become darker.  A few hair-raising elements were added, events that make you a little nervous for Nancy.  She's compromised in nearly every episode, in some situations that are dangerous, some which are resolved in humorous ways; in others, not so humorous.  And the season finale has one humdinger of a cliffhanger.  I'm happily hooked now, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the third season.As for the Blu-ray itself, I'm got a few reservations about the picture quality.  Oh, it's sharp enough alright.  But some textures are lost during particular lighting conditions, especially during closeups under a bright light or in the slanted light of a setting sun.  The skin tones became oversaturated in a garish yellowish hue.  The picture would shift suddenly as the light reached a threshold, jumping to a hotter palette, the complexions bleached in a yellow-to-white glare.  It's not unacceptable, but it was noticeable if you're overly sensitive to such things.  I shrugged it off because pleasing saturation levels were the norm, with everything sharply outlined with window-clear clarity.  However, beyond its slickness and its clean air, this series doesn't have a unique visual style, making hi-def inessential to the enjoyment of it.  Maybe next time I'll settle for the SD edition.Unless the Blu-ray edition is cheaper, as it was this time out.______________________________________________________",4,"The Season Turns Darker, and Better",1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,3296,"['have', ""n't"", 'subscribed', 'Showtime', 'years', 'came', 'party', 'late', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'recommendation', 'liked', 'good', 'bit', 'seemed', 'bit', 'transparent', 'was', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'quirky', 'get', 'hook', 'deep', 'Characters', 'are', 'given', 'droll', 'dialogue', 'personalities', 'leaving', 'out', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'exploited', 'oddness', 'standard', 'juxtaposition', 'relaxed', 'hipness', 'staid', 'pettiness', 'self-righteousness', 'in-your-face', 'mockery', 'mainstream', 'values', 'already', 'gainsaid', 'basic', 'naughtier', 'truth', 'Sometimes', 'stories', 'went', 'way', 'find', 'most', 'shocking', 'scenario', 'skidding', 'stop', 'just', 'short', 'offending', 'anybody', 'who', 'might', 'mount', 'effective', 'complaint', 'even', 'daring', 'show', 'nearly', 'prepubescent', 'girl', 'locked', 'lesbian', 'puppy-love', 'embrace', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken', 'easily', 'titillated', 'avant-garde', 'television', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'out-there', 'instead', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'So', 'season', 'end', 'concluded', 'series', 'was', 'likable', 'entertaining', 'unremarkable', 'finished', 'Nancy', 'business', 'plan', 'fully', 'detailed', 'down', 'division', 'labor', 'cliffhanger', 'finale', 'felt', 'complete', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurry', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'When', 'noticed', 'economically', 'pricedComplete', 'Second', 'Seasonon', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'reason', 'not', 'follow', 'Nancy', 'further', 'adventures', 'TVs', 'most', 'enterprising', 'MILF.The', 'second', 'season', 'maintained', 'brisk', 'pace', 'first', 'dialogue', 'still', 'distinguished', 'skippy', 'style', 'first', 'season', 'tension', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'Nancy', 'conflict', 'familial', 'obligations', 'role', 'model', 'illegal', 'role-busting', 'activities', 'never', 'convincing', 'source', 'drama', 'comedy', 'attention', 'wanders', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'stuff', 'Other', 'series', 'definitely', 'improved', 'become', 'darker', 'few', 'hair-raising', 'elements', 'were', 'added', 'events', 'make', 'little', 'nervous', 'Nancy', 'compromised', 'nearly', 'episode', 'situations', 'are', 'dangerous', 'are', 'resolved', 'humorous', 'ways', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'humorous', 'season', 'finale', 'one', 'humdinger', 'cliffhanger', ""'m"", 'happily', 'hooked', 'now', ""'m"", 'eagerly', 'looking', 'forward', 'third', 'season.As', 'Blu-ray', ""'m"", 'got', 'few', 'reservations', 'picture', 'quality', 'Oh', 'sharp', 'enough', 'alright', 'textures', 'are', 'lost', 'particular', 'lighting', 'conditions', 'especially', 'closeups', 'bright', 'light', 'slanted', 'light', 'setting', 'sun', 'skin', 'tones', 'became', 'oversaturated', 'garish', 'yellowish', 'hue', 'picture', 'would', 'shift', 'suddenly', 'light', 'reached', 'threshold', 'jumping', 'hotter', 'palette', 'complexions', 'bleached', 'yellow-to-white', 'glare', 'not', 'unacceptable', 'was', 'noticeable', ""'re"", 'overly', 'sensitive', 'such', 'things', 'shrugged', 'off', 'pleasing', 'saturation', 'levels', 'were', 'norm', 'everything', 'sharply', 'outlined', 'window-clear', 'clarity', 'However', 'slickness', 'clean', 'air', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', 'making', 'hi-def', 'inessential', 'enjoyment', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'SD', 'edition.Unless', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'cheaper', 'was', 'time', 'out.______________________________________________________']",N/A

The first part of the series resolves Season 1s cliffhanger ending in which Nancy ends up dating a DEA agent.  The middle sets up a number of new complications, stemming from her connection to the DEA and from new business aquaintances.  The end brings all of the many threads together in one giant mess and then fixes it with a deus ex machina that is actually believable.  It also leaves us hanging once again and does it in style.  As Nancy's complications increase, so does the drama, but the humor goes through the roof!The writing is even better than the 1st season, with tons of memorable lines and hilarious visual moments.  Season 2 is also a lot sexier.  Nearly every character hooks up in some way, even Shane, in a kinda creepy way.  Silas' and Andy's relationships are just freakin' hilarious.  Lots of bad guys get what they deserve.  Celia raises bitchiness to new heights (even some drug dealers are impressed).  Doug pulls pranks on an epic scale and sings.  Nancy gets naked and starts to play rough (socially and in business).  I don't want to spoil it, but it's outstanding.This DVD set is great, too.  The extras are well done and interesting.  You get 7 commentaries, a lot of ""Little Boxes,"" some featurettes, and even Huskaroos! commercials.  The music is critical since Season 3 ditches the much-loved theme song altogether.

1073935,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000Q6GUKC,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[24, 47]","One of the worst kept secrets in the entire world may be that the American suburbs are fueled by one very green plant. And who can blame them really seeing as how these neighborhoods function as basically totalitarian police states that thrive off of petty feuds, boredom, racism and exclusivity. Not that this show has any interest in ripping open the belly of the beast and leaving the entrails around for us to feed on, rather it is a surprisingly sweet show that actually idealizes many of the bizarre habits of the suburbanites. And there in lies the magic of the show, it is not about dealing drugs but rather about nothing more than this set of quirky characters. We hang out with generally likeable, downright relatable characters (who all happen to be narcissists) as they engage in the emptiness that is their lives. The dialogue is witty and filled with aggrandizing monologues that were probably a dream for the writers and were certainly a treat for me. Like ""The Sopranos"" it is an alternate, criminal take on the American Dream. And really, how did you earn your money? Was nobody stepped on, exploited, killed, or maimed, directly or indirectly, because of your quest for a high standard of living? I certainly can't say that.The basic story arch this season deals with Nancy's (Mary-Louise Parker) decision to date a DEA agent named Peter (Martin Donovan). The overtly obvious set up actually produces some real results because the writers envision the characters as real people with real emotions. Lust begets love which begets betrayal which begets vengeance. Of course he would really use his governmental tools to eavesdrop on her; we're only taken aback by it because TV characters aren't supposed to be that smart. As the season progresses you realize that there was actually a big picture in place all along and that the writers weren't just sitting around baked for the first half. But after seeing how good things get in the end you look back on the first five episodes and feel as though they were squandered. I also loved the way that the personal interests infringed upon the business interests. All the characters make bad decisions, but they make these bad decisions in the name of a greater good and that is what keeps things interesting.Mary-Louise Parker, after all these years, is truly more radiant than ever. She also turns in a strong yet underwhelming performance. Nancy is the soul of the show and Parker plays her up as the most likeable drug kingpin you could ever imagine. The show does little politicking for the legalization of pot but it is clear that that is where they stand. We can say free market all we want but isn't Nancy chasing the Armenians out of town the same as the pharmaceutical companies pushing for the illegalization of drugs that actually work? I will admit that the show never rises above the level of fun diversion. The episodes fly by (which is a good thing) but good luck placing this show into a specific genre. Comedy? Probably....but how many comedies do you know involve the elements that are found here? And the season ending cliffhanger shows that while their may be laughs for us the ticket holders in the future things in Agrestic are not looking all that humorous.",3,Lots of Fun But Not Much Else,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,3242,"['One', 'worst', 'kept', 'secrets', 'entire', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'American', 'suburbs', 'are', 'fueled', 'one', 'very', 'green', 'plant', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'really', 'seeing', 'how', 'neighborhoods', 'function', 'basically', 'totalitarian', 'police', 'states', 'thrive', 'petty', 'feuds', 'boredom', 'racism', 'exclusivity', 'Not', 'show', 'interest', 'ripping', 'open', 'belly', 'beast', 'leaving', 'entrails', 'feed', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'show', 'actually', 'many', 'bizarre', 'habits', 'suburbanites', 'there', 'magic', 'show', 'not', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'rather', 'nothing', 'more', 'set', 'quirky', 'characters', 'hang', 'out', 'generally', 'likeable', 'downright', 'relatable', 'characters', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'narcissists', 'engage', 'emptiness', 'lives', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'filled', 'aggrandizing', 'monologues', 'were', 'probably', 'dream', 'writers', 'were', 'certainly', 'treat', 'Sopranos', 'alternate', 'criminal', 'take', 'American', 'Dream', 'really', 'how', 'did', 'earn', 'money', 'Was', 'nobody', 'stepped', 'exploited', 'killed', 'maimed', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'quest', 'high', 'standard', 'living', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'that.The', 'basic', 'story', 'arch', 'season', 'Nancy', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'decision', 'date', 'DEA', 'agent', 'named', 'Peter', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'overtly', 'obvious', 'set', 'up', 'actually', 'real', 'results', 'writers', 'envision', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'emotions', 'Lust', 'begets', 'love', 'begets', 'betrayal', 'vengeance', 'course', 'would', 'really', 'use', 'governmental', 'tools', 'eavesdrop', ""'re"", 'only', 'taken', 'aback', 'TV', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'smart', 'season', 'realize', 'was', 'actually', 'big', 'picture', 'place', 'along', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'baked', 'first', 'half', 'seeing', 'how', 'good', 'things', 'get', 'end', 'look', 'back', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'feel', 'were', 'squandered', 'also', 'loved', 'way', 'personal', 'interests', 'infringed', 'business', 'interests', 'characters', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'name', 'greater', 'good', 'what', 'things', 'interesting.Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'years', 'truly', 'more', 'radiant', 'ever', 'also', 'strong', 'yet', 'underwhelming', 'performance', 'Nancy', 'soul', 'show', 'Parker', 'up', 'most', 'likeable', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'show', 'little', 'politicking', 'legalization', 'pot', 'clear', 'where', 'stand', 'can', 'say', 'free', 'market', 'want', ""n't"", 'Nancy', 'chasing', 'Armenians', 'town', 'same', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'pushing', 'illegalization', 'drugs', 'actually', 'work', 'will', 'admit', 'show', 'never', 'level', 'fun', 'diversion', 'episodes', 'fly', 'good', 'thing', 'good', 'luck', 'placing', 'show', 'specific', 'genre', 'Comedy', 'Probably', '.but', 'how', 'many', 'comedies', 'do', 'know', 'involve', 'elements', 'are', 'found', 'here', 'season', 'ending', 'cliffhanger', 'shows', 'may', 'be', 'laughs', 'ticket', 'holders', 'future', 'things', 'Agrestic', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'humorous']",N/A

1073941,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B000Q6GUKC,Harkanwar Anand,"[1, 2]","Not many of my friends have watched Weeds. Entourage, Seinfeld, 24, Lost, Prison Break, Extras seem like more familiar options but many people haven't even seen enough of those. One thing that I noticed about Weeds is that it has the most adorable soundtrack. You never know what they're going to come up with so I have a nice time using the newest app for my blackberry, Shazam.Nancy Botwin (?) from weeds is a character with many flaws. She is not the best actress and she is easy to like sometimes but she is easier to dislike and find downright stupid. Conrad is a good character and the children plus brother in law are funny but sometimes you will find that too much time is spent on these characters making you feel that the show doesn't know whether to be young or old or mixed or how to be. This could be one reason the show is average if anyone's being honest.Celia Hodes has a rather annoying character. And Doug Wilson is a bit like an annoying wasp. Conrad's family is wierd and I like the portrayal of a black family.

Using this; as a way of dealing with her emotional collapse, in return for providing for the family by dealing marijuana to neighbours and spacey school-kids. Nancy is played with perfect pokerfaced-untelling-drug-seller mum by Mary-Louise Parker, ex-West Wing star who talks on a less political and more social tasks of day to day life. She is groomed for any social eventuality. Alongside the mum of two is youngest Shane (Alexander Gould) who played the voice of Nemo in `Finding Nemo' who is less stutter and more into the wild flights of fancy. Older bro Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is eager to get his school life on the OC-type list by doing anything or anyone possible.Yes, selling drugs makes good TV? Weeds outshines the morally ambiguous judgement on drugs.  Some of the people who do drugs are good, some are bad. But it's the person we judge, not the substance.While it seems a bit Desperate Housewives, it's got a lot more going for it.

1073948,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000Q6GUKC,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[2, 5]","Another great season of ""Weeds"", as fully satisfying as season one.  Every episode features laughs, sexiness, good drama, and unexpected twists and turns.  And you also get a bigger dose of fun this time out, as season two gives you twelve great episodes instead of season one's ten.Other Amazon reviews mention specific example after specific example of why this is such a great season of television, so I won't repeat those examples here, instead adding one additional observation that I haven't yet seen mentioned in any detail in these reviews, namely how excellently the breast cancer storyline is handled.More specifically, what was so refreshing about the ""Celia gets breast cancer"" plotline is how much wasn't endlessly discussed.  A lesser TV series or TV movie would show an attractive woman getting breast cancer and then, following her surgery, we'd be certain to see the woman agonizing about her desirability, doubting her femininity, etc., etc.  However, in ""Weeds"", sexy, desirable Celia Hodes discovers she has breast cancer, promptly get surgery, and within two episodes is out there being the same sexy, desirable Celia Hodes we saw before.  She even enters into a hot affair with Councilman Doug, and he doesn't display any problems with her recent cancer surgery, either.  The topic never comes up.I just found this ""non treatment"" treatment of the issue very refreshing.  By not making Celia show even the smallest concern about her desirability post-surgery, instead showing her going full bore back to her previous hedonistic pursuits, the show delivered a strong message, clearly communicating that a woman's true allure revolves around so much more than the current state of her bosom.  In other words, by not making an overt statement on the issue, the show made a powerful statement on the issue.And typical of the sly, playfully intelligent ""Weeds"", this powerful, positive statement is delivered by showing a selfish, hedonistic woman go on being selfish and hedonistic post-hospital stay.  It has to be the first time in television history where blatantly irresponsibile behavior is used to deliver an inspirational message.  And you just gotta love that.And you just gotta love ""Weeds"".

Nancy's oldest son Silas was getting serious about his deaf girlfriend and having the sex to prove it, her younger son was acting out by making terrorist video tapes and shooting at renegade mountain lions, and her (ex?) brother-in-law had decided to go to rabbinical school to escape the war in Iraq. Oh yeah. And Nancy had just learned that her new boyfriend was a DEA agent. OOPS!The second season picked up with all that action, and more. Nancy and her partner-in-crime Conrad decided to start growing pot instead of just dealing it, Nancy marries her DEA agent boyfriend, and little miss MILF finally realizes that she may have gotten in over her head. You think?Weeds may not be the best show on television, but it's certainly one of the most entertaining. The suburban community of Agrestic, California is hilarious with its uptight residents who have no idea about their town's dirty little secret. The supporting cast, including Nancy's crooked CPA and city councilman Doug, her best friend and cancer survivor Celia, and her former dealer Heylia Turner James only serve to enhance an already great cast of characters.

Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've see these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.  In short, the show preaches to the choir who thinks the world would be better if everyone was a little higher, and the show only rarely entertains the possibility that maybe that's not really true either.",3,An ultra-cynical expos&eacute; of suburban life,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2721,"['Little', 'Children', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Weeds', 'planned', 'community', 'forgotten', 'circle', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'Suburban', 'life', 'really', ""n't"", 'gated', 'paradise', 'brochures', 'housing', 'committee', 'promise', 'rather', 'cesspool', 'petty', 'people', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'nothing', 'do', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'see', 'kinds', 'shows', 'movies', 'What', 'unique', 'Weeds', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'Even', 'children', 'show', 'come', 'off', 'selfish', 'demons', 'who', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'wise', 'ironic', 'respective', 'ages', 'cast', 'superb', 'things', 'do', 'say', 'make', 'alternately', 'cringe', 'laugh', 'open', 'mouth', 'wide', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'end', 'episode', 'generally', 'feature', 'very', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'dirty', 'folk', 'pop', 'song', 'audio', 'metaphor', 'entire', 'episode', 'enjoy', 'show', 'attempt', 'tell', 'quirky', 'increasingly', 'unrealistic', 'tale', 'must', 'be', 'tremendous', 'challenge', 'writers.On', 'other', 'hand', 'show', ""n't"", 'evolve', 'much', 'further', 'writer', 'delight', 'So', 'much', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'stream', 'creative', 'new', 'curse', 'words', 'phrases', 'start', 'off', 'shocking', 'funny', 'veneer', 'wears', 'thin', 'when', 'realize', 'just', 'device', 'divide', 'attention', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'happening', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'same', 'selfish', 'mold', 'how', 'Family', 'Guy', 'same', 'device', 'nearly', 'episode', 'Something', 'happens', 'Peter', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'time', 'when', '[', 'fill', 'blank', ']', 'show', 'randomize', 'plot', 'barely', 'relevant', 'flashback', 'Again', 'funny', 'while', 'old', 'fast.I', 'should', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'put', 'off', 'Weed', 'liberal', 'politics', 'tend', 'sympathize', 'probably', 'most', 'consistent', 'biased', 'part', 'show', 'something', 'essential', 'missing', 'discussions', 'race', 'immigration', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'single', 'motherhood', 'suburban', 'life', 'religion', 'draft', 'dodging', 'so', 'end', 'have', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'show', 'selfish', 'show', 'characters', 'gate', 'off', 'views', 'dissenters', 'conservatives', 'religious', 'way', 'extremism', 'Just', 'fundamentalism', 'irony', 'black/white', 'morality', 'humanity', 'material', 'secularism', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'self-discipline', 'short', 'show', 'choir', 'who', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'everyone', 'was', 'little', 'higher', 'show', 'only', 'rarely', 'possibility', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'either']",N/A

But when it comes down to this, the best way to talk about the second season ofWeedsisn't marijuana puns, it's the simple truth.  This is a strong season of what was already a damn good show.  The writers pretty much took everything that worked about the first season and made it better.  They took risks, which in itself is a special thing in television, and each of those risks paid off in the end.The status quo of the show changes, because Nancy graduates from small time dealer to a big wig grower/supplier, which leads to tension between her and... well, pretty much everyone.  The show manages to keep a healthy balance of drama and comedy while juggling the many on-going arcs of the series.

I kept watching just for M.L. Parker and loved the final episode of Season #1.For you harder to please folks, like myself, you can believe the hype. The 4 and 5 star reviews are now much closer to what this series deserves. I'm sure all the lovers of Season #1, would like to give Season #2, 10 stars out of five (if they were allowed to).Season 2, is simply filled with better plots (both dramatic and comedic), crisper dialogue, and much better pacing! Now the 30 minute episodes go by so fast, I was always left wanting more and was rarely (if ever) bored (it's good to finally be in the majority)! I think, of the 12 episodes of Season 2, I LOVED 11 and thought the other one was still very good.I even loved the way they had different singers and or music styles for the opening theme song, ""Little Boxes"", in each episode. A very nice touch.The DVD extras will also supposedly include a ""Little Boxes"" musical montage as well as 7 commentaries, a gag reel, 4 featurettes, Huskaroo commercials and a ""Jammin' Nation"" Extended Performance.So, even if you were less than impressed with Season #1, do yourself a favor and at least rent or download two episodes of Season 2 and see if you agree.

I'm a couple episodes into Season 2, and I just love how they challenge attitudes around race, sex, cannabis and much more.  A recent episode featured a pot expo, with scenes that featured the wonderful journal ""Cannabis Culture.""But the flattering portrayal of the Israeli soldier is kind of disturbing.  Imagine if during the Apartheid regime, there was a show on tv that lovingly portrayed a South African soldier.  On top of that, the Israeli soldier character has a line where she says her brother was killed by a Hamas suicide bomber in a pizza parlor.  In the context of the reality of 3 or 4 times as many Palestinian civilians being killed than Israeli civilians, I think the pizza parlor anecdote (one that right-wing radio hosts repeat over and over again) is morally unfortunate.

1073981,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000Q6GUKC,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Showtime's ""Weeds"" offers a stellar second season as a follow-up to its hilarious opening salvo.  The second season of every good series is a treat as the actors get more comfortable with their characters and the writers get to explore some of the better ideas they couldn't squeeze into the first season (plus, by virtue of being picked up for another run, the writers feel a little more free to push the envelope).  But nothing has gotten tired or stale, and the writers generally haven't written themselves into a corner.That description holds true for most of Season Two of the Battle for Agrestic.  On the one side we have our heroine, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), emerging marijuana entrepreneur.  She's still trying to keep her dysfunctional family together while dealing with her beloved husband's early demise, but at the end of Season One she was pulling it together.  She even found her rebound relationship with the sensitive, dryly funny Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan).  But in the Season One cliffhanger par excellence, she learns the hard way that he's a DEA agent.  Not only that, but in Season Two we learn that Peter's more than a little familiar with the drug heirarchy in Agrestic, although this clever guy is able to sidestep Nancy's chosen career rather neatly.At least, for a while.Season Two is essentially Season One again, only more so.  Conrad (Romany Malco) continues to pine for both Nancy and the freedom to grow truly divine weeed.  Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) remains the Queen Bee of Agrestic and takes on Doug (Kevin Nealon, still awesome) for his cherished city council seat.  Nancy's kids and brother-in-law remain screwed up - comically so.  And through it all Nancy soldiers on with the blithe knowledge that things have to work out for her, 'cause she's got nowhere else to go.My only problem with Season Two is that one character does a dramatic u-turn during the season, and the change is not true to the character.  I don't want to give anything away, but this change smacks of writers realizing a looming problem with where the show needed to go, and so this character is suddenly transformed . . . with dire consequences.Still, this is a minor complaint for a season that builds to a Mexican stand-off in the finale that would have made Sergio Leone proud.

Fortunately, the second season of ""Weeds"" pulls it off successfully by being funny but also keeping to the original theme.  As the season opens, Nancy decides to end her relationship with Peter when she discovers that he is a DEA agent; he seems oblivious to the fact that she's a drug dealer, but this relationship will continue to haunt her throughout the season.  Another character, Celia, undergoes a transformation after she has a minor car accident and decides to run for city council to unseat the pot-smoking Doug.  The other major plot involves Nancy and Conrad going into business together.Season 2 of ""Weeds"" is as good as season 1, with the addition of more scares for Nancy.  It turns out that selling drugs in the suburbs isn't as safe or clean as she envisioned.  These changes help make the series more believable; however, the show starts to go slightly off the rails toward the end of the season, as more and more forces press on Nancy.  The season ends in an exciting cliffhanger, which is funny although out of character for the series.On the down side, the most annoying character, Nancy's brother-in-law Andy, continues to get too much screen time, including an annoying draft-dodging subplot.  I'm sure his pot-fueled irresponsibility appeals to some viewers, but I find him irritating and unfunny.
