141275,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,0792838505,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[3, 4]","A wonderful, thinking man's, neo-traditional Western. Burt excels as the lawdog made of granite. He doesn't bend, he doesn't trade.  He wavers for a brief moment, but the inexorable workings of the patterns of his life pull him back into line. The flickers that pass over his tired face are a masterful demonstration of cinema acting. Beautiful, intricate script to chew on. It's stuffed with strong dialogue, full of meat. Superb, relentless pacing. Stunning shoot-outs. Like a game of chess, there are rules. But it doesn't matter how good you are; you've got to have the killer instinct if you're going to win.  What are the issues?  If you tried to buy the man above Maddox, who would that be?  ""There is no easy comfort from God"" says the preacher. ""From the hardness comes forth purity"" is his funeral message. Maddox doesn't need to see from where he stands --- he's the sword of Gideon. And life catches up with everyone in the end. The land was won with guns, and the defeated native Americans ride past in stoic silence. Finally, after watching this implacable story several times, I managed to figure out who shot the old man in Bannock. That killing was NOT an accident. There are enough hints in the early part, and the ending brings it all together with a truly satisfying closure. This is one of the finest of the Western genre, as good as High Noon, and far better than most.",5,You buy the man above him,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1391,"['wonderful', 'thinking', 'man', 'neo-traditional', 'Western', 'Burt', 'lawdog', 'made', 'granite', ""n't"", 'bend', ""n't"", 'trade', 'brief', 'moment', 'inexorable', 'workings', 'patterns', 'life', 'pull', 'back', 'line', 'flickers', 'pass', 'tired', 'face', 'are', 'masterful', 'demonstration', 'cinema', 'acting', 'Beautiful', 'intricate', 'script', 'chew', 'stuffed', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'full', 'meat', 'Superb', 'relentless', 'pacing', 'Stunning', 'shoot-outs', 'game', 'chess', 'are', 'rules', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'are', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'killer', 'instinct', ""'re"", 'going', 'win', 'What', 'are', 'issues', 'tried', 'buy', 'man', 'Maddox', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'comfort', 'God', 'preacher', 'hardness', 'forth', 'purity', 'funeral', 'message', 'Maddox', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'where', 'sword', 'Gideon', 'life', 'catches', 'up', 'everyone', 'end', 'land', 'was', 'won', 'guns', 'defeated', 'native', 'Americans', 'ride', 'stoic', 'silence', 'Finally', 'watching', 'implacable', 'story', 'several', 'times', 'managed', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'shot', 'old', 'man', 'Bannock', 'killing', 'was', 'NOT', 'accident', 'are', 'enough', 'hints', 'early', 'part', 'ending', 'brings', 'together', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'closure', 'one', 'finest', 'Western', 'genre', 'as', 'good', 'High', 'Noon', 'far', 'better', 'most']",N/A

141277,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,0792838505,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","With the recent death of British filmmaker Michael Winner (1/21/13), I decided to go back and revisit several of his movies (which I have done on many occasions) and the one that always makes the biggest impression is LAWMAN. When I first saw it on the big screen back in 1971, I was impressed with the big name cast (Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan), the number of TV regulars (Ralph Waite, J.D. Cannon, Albert Salmi) and absolutely stunned by the finale. Now many years later I'm still impressed but somewhat saddened by Gerald Wilson's screenplay especially now with Congress constantly at an impasse and the rampart gun violence that is everywhere around us. It seems that we have gone backwards since 1971 not forward. As that statement implies, and as you can read in other reviews, LAWMAN is no mere Western. It's a morality play about the inability to compromise and its inevitable consequences.Burt Lanaster, one of Hollywood's most unabashed liberals, was immediately drawn to the script of a no-nonsense marshal who never deviates from the letter of the law no matter what the cost. In the beginning we admire his refusal to be corrupted by bribes and his determination to bring in the lawbreakers who shot up his town. By the end we hate him. His unwillingness to yield or compromise has cost the lives of many men including some who weren't guilty. Of course cattleman Lee J. Cobb & his men could have willingly gone with Lancaster knowing that they would have gotten off with a slap on the wrist but he too is unwilling to compromise thus setting the stage for the tragic conclusion. Although tame by today's standards, the violent finale remains unsettling for its implications which are left up to the viewer.Director Winner, who would go on to make the highly controversial DEATH WISH with Charles Bronson, had the ability early in his career to make movies that were thought provoking as well as entertaining (THE JOKERS, THE NIGHTCOMERS, CHATO'S LAND). The runaway success of DEATH WISH essentially ended his career as a ""serious"" filmmaker as all the studios wanted was more of the same. When THE SENTINEL, a 1977 horror film that is now highly regarded flopped, his Hollywood days were numbered and he went back to England where he made a series of interesting films (DIRTY WEEKEND, A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL, APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH) that failed to make any kind of impact. He retired from films in 1998 after PARTING SHOTS and became a successful restaurant critic. Look him up on imdb and then check out his films. His ability to entertain first and then leave food for thought afterwards makes his movies a worthwhile experience.",4,One of Michael Winner's Finest.,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2660,"['recent', 'death', 'British', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Winner', '1/21/13', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'revisit', 'several', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'occasions', 'one', 'always', 'biggest', 'impression', 'LAWMAN', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'back', '1971', 'was', 'impressed', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'number', 'TV', 'regulars', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'J.D', 'Cannon', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'absolutely', 'stunned', 'finale', 'Now', 'many', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'still', 'impressed', 'somewhat', 'saddened', 'Gerald', 'Wilson', 'screenplay', 'especially', 'now', 'Congress', 'constantly', 'impasse', 'rampart', 'gun', 'violence', 'everywhere', 'have', 'gone', 'backwards', '1971', 'not', 'forward', 'statement', 'implies', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'LAWMAN', 'mere', 'Western', 'morality', 'play', 'inability', 'compromise', 'inevitable', 'consequences.Burt', 'Lanaster', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'unabashed', 'liberals', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'script', 'no-nonsense', 'marshal', 'who', 'never', 'letter', 'law', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'beginning', 'admire', 'refusal', 'be', 'corrupted', 'bribes', 'determination', 'bring', 'lawbreakers', 'who', 'shot', 'up', 'town', 'end', 'hate', 'unwillingness', 'yield', 'compromise', 'cost', 'lives', 'many', 'men', 'including', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'guilty', 'course', 'cattleman', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'men', 'could', 'have', 'willingly', 'gone', 'Lancaster', 'knowing', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'slap', 'wrist', 'too', 'unwilling', 'compromise', 'thus', 'setting', 'stage', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'violent', 'finale', 'unsettling', 'implications', 'are', 'left', 'up', 'viewer.Director', 'Winner', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'highly', 'controversial', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'had', 'ability', 'early', 'career', 'make', 'movies', 'were', 'thought', 'provoking', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'THE', 'JOKERS', 'THE', 'NIGHTCOMERS', 'CHATO', 'LAND', 'runaway', 'success', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'essentially', 'ended', 'career', 'serious', 'filmmaker', 'studios', 'wanted', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'When', 'SENTINEL', '1977', 'horror', 'film', 'now', 'highly', 'regarded', 'flopped', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'were', 'numbered', 'went', 'back', 'England', 'where', 'made', 'series', 'interesting', 'films', 'DIRTY', 'WEEKEND', 'A', 'CHORUS', 'OF', 'DISAPPROVAL', 'APPOINTMENT', 'WITH', 'DEATH', 'failed', 'make', 'kind', 'impact', 'retired', 'films', '1998', 'PARTING', 'SHOTS', 'became', 'successful', 'restaurant', 'critic', 'Look', 'up', 'imdb', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'films', 'ability', 'entertain', 'first', 'then', 'leave', 'food', 'thought', 'afterwards', 'movies', 'worthwhile', 'experience']",N/A
141278,ACBFF25XJC2T7,0792838505,Choice Critic,"[0, 0]","This is a truly great western of that genre's late period. It was made two years after ""The Wild Bunch"", the western by Sam Peckinpah that introduced a graphic level of violence previously unseen and unacceptable in the genre.  The tinny, haunting music played throughout, on the other hand, presages the musical scores of Clint Eastwood's late-'70's spaghetti westerns directed by Sergio Leone.The cast is a showcase of stars of that time and also stars-to-be.  Believe it or not, that is Wilford Brimley that Sheriff Jared Maddox (Burt Lancaster) brings into the town of Sabbath at the opening of the movie.  A future huge star's acting job in this movie is to lay slumped over dead on a horse.  Ralph Waite (of Pa Walton fame), Richard Jordan, Robert Duvall, all appear as young actores on their way up playing cowhands for the inimitable Lee J. Cobb.  Cobb plays a wealthy rancher named Vince Branson.Cobb, along with Lancaster, Sheree North, and Robert Ryan are the main characters who carry this outstanding tale, with strong support from the younger supporting players.. Cobb's Branson has the misfortune of leading his men on a shoot-em-up lark of Lancaster's town, Bannock, while he is away.

Maddox ambles into the town of Sabbath in search of seven cowboys lead by a cattle baron, brilliantly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb. They had shot up his town, killing an innocent bystander in a drunken celebration on the return trip of a cattle drive.  Maddox aims to bring the men responsible to trial.The plot is a familiar one, reminiscent of Eastwood's Hang 'Em High and also of the Ox Bow Incident.  The flick is madespecial by the psychological make up of Lancaster as the merciless Maddox who manages to gun down all of the men he pursued.  He even shoots the unarmed paramour of his ex- flame Sheree North in the back, muddling the usual clear division between good and evil seen in older westerns.

141285,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792838505,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 3]","When you think of great cowboy stars, Burt Lancaster's name doesn't immediately come to mind. Burt Lancaster was nominated for an Oscar in 1953 for ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) and would be nominated 3 more times and win for ""Elmer Gantry"" (1960). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 5 times, starting in 1956 (""The Rainmaker"") and including ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962) and ""Atlantic City"" (1980). Lancaster started in films at the age of 32 in ""The Killers"" (1946) and was an instant success. His memorable films prior to ""Devil's Disciple"" included ""Jim Thorpe"" (1951), ""The Crimson Pirate"" (1952), ""Come Back Little Sheba"" (1952), ""Vera Cruz"" (1954), ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957) and ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958). He appears as #19 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.But dig a little more deeply and you'll find Lancaster in some of the very best westerns ever made - ""Vera Cruz"" (1954) opposite Gary Cooper with a final man-on-man gunfight that remains a classic, ""Gunfight at OK Corral"" (1957) with Kirk Douglas, ""The Professionals"" (1966) with Lee Marvin and Robert Ryan, and the marvelous ""Valdez is Coming"" (1971).In this film Lancaster plays a sheriff from a small town who is tracking down the men responsible for killing a local during a shoot `em up celebration. He finds them in a neighboring town ruled by a land baron (Lee J Cobb) who  along with his men was involved in the shooting.Robert Ryan (1909-1973) plays the sheriff who must try to negotiate with the town, with Cobb, and with Lancaster. Ryan made nearly 100 films between 1940 and 1973. In his early years he often played a villain especially in film noir dramas (""Crossfire"", ""Act of Violence"") then transitioned into the tough guy with a good heart role (""On Dangerous Ground"").  My personal favorite Ryan role is Deke Thornton in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).Lee J. Cobb (1911-76) plays the land baron who was involved in the killing. Cobb was one of the finest actors of the mid 20th century. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""On the Waterfront"", ""The Brothers Karamazov""), twice for a Golden Globe (""Come Blow Your Horn"", ""12 Angry Men"") and three times for an Emmy (""Death of a Salesman"", ""Playhouse 90"", ""Studio One""). Cobb was a victim of the HUAC red scare in the 50s and became an informer, which is interesting given that in 1954 his role in ""On the Waterfront"" was as the victim of an informer (played by Marlon Brando).Robert Duvall (1931) plays one of the hunted men.  Duvall loves playing southerners and in westerns. He was nominated 6 times for an Oscar, winning once for ""Tender Mercies"" (1983). He won a BAFTA as the helicopter officer in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and an Emmy for his work on ""Broken Trail"" (2006).Richard Jordan (1937-93) is best known for his role as Joseph Armagh in the TV series ""Captains and the Kings"" (1976) for which he received an Emmy and a Golden Globe nomination. Jordan plays a cowboy who is fast with a gun. Jordan made his film debut in another Lancaster film the same year - ""Valdez is Coming"".Sheree North (1932-2005) is probably best known as Seinfeld's mom, or as the woman who was going to replace Marilyn Monroe because she was a blonde and had the same measurements. But I like to think of her as the ""Queen of the B-girls"" for all the times she played the fallen woman in films like this and ""The Shootist"" (1976). North was very active on TV where she had recurring roles in several series, and was nominated twice for an Emmy (""Marcus Welby"", ""Archie Bunker's Place"").Director Michael Winner (1935) is best known from his Charles Bronson films, starting with Chato's Land (1972) and ""The Mechanic"" (1972) and extending through several ""Death Wish"" (1974, 1982, 1985) films. This was his first western and his first American film, having made films in the U.K. for several years.The film is lovingly photographed by Robert Paynter (1928-2010), a long time collaborator of Michael Winner who worked together on 10 films. Apart from Winner, Paynter shot such films as ""Little Shop of Horrors"" (1986), ""European Vacation"" (1985), ""Superman 2"" (1983) and several Michael Jackson videos.The film belong to the ""hunt `em down"" genres in which a man, usually a sheriff, hunts down the men who have committed a terrible crime, usually murder and/or rape. Similar films include ""Hang em High"" (1968) in which Clint Eastwood hunts down the men who tried to hang him, ""The Bravados"" (1958) in which Gregory Peck who hunts the men who killed his wife, and ""The Searchers"" (1956) in which the Duke hunts down the Indians who killed his brother and family and kidnapped his niece.This genre requires several things: (1) the evil doers need to reflect different gradients of guilt, (2) they need be killed in as many different ways as possible, (3) the avenger must encounter opposition, both of a moral and a physical nature, and (4) along the way the avenger should be changed by the process.  ""The Lawman"" gives us all of these conventions, especially in the end.This is a better than average western with some good performances from some very good actors.",4,Burt Lancaster in another good

141287,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792838505,Erik North,"[11, 11]","One of the most underappreciated westerns ever made, LAWMAN stars Burt Lancaster as a hard-bitten, taciturn lawman from the town of Bannock who rides seemingly for a hundred miles to the town of Sabbath to take in a group of cowboys who, in a drunken shooting spree, had shot up his town and killed an old man.But his appearance in Sabbath causes considerable hostility among the townsfolk, because they owe their livelihoods to that same bunch, led by Lee J. Cobb, and are unwilling to give it up.  Lancaster, unsurprisingly, is unmoved.  Therein hangs this solid, almost psychological, sagebrush saga.Lancaster, as usual, is brilliant in his role of an efficient, cold-blooded lawman, and Cobb is equally special as the leader of the group of cowboys being sought.  This is not your typical good guys/bad guys saga: what happened in Bannock was a tragic accident, and Lancaster may be pushing his authority a bit too far.  Robert Ryan, always one of the better and more overlooked actors in Hollywood, gives one of his greatest performances as Sabbath's aging, pragmatic marshal.Probably Michael Winner's best film as a director, LAWMAN was shot on location in central Mexico and has some stark photography by British cameraman Robert Paynter, giving it a look not out of place in a Sam Peckinpah or Sergio Leone film.

It had a stellar cast, excellent script, and beautiful music and cinematography.Burt Lancaster plays Jered Maddox, an aging lawman from Bannock, a cow town in the late 1880's.  Robert Ryan plays Cotton Ryan, a former great marshal who settles in Sabbath to enjoy his remaining years in peace and quiet.Lee J. Cobb is Vincent Bronson the richest man in town.  Bronson is not your typical cattle baron.  He has a heart and the land holds many memories for him--both good and bad.  The townspeople like him.The conflict revolves around Bronson's men who shot up Bannock on a cattle drive.  Unfortunately, a citizen is killed in the drunken ruckus, a tragic accident.  Marshal Maddox comes to Sabbath on May 13, 1887 to bring Bronson's men back to Bannock to stand trial.The conversations between Maddox and Cotton Ryan are well written and reflective of the times and the lives of the late 1880's.  You have two aging lawmen discussing the past and its glories while the future looked bleak and the end of the road.In essence Maddox says a lawman is ""a killer of men"".  He proves that fact over and over again.  Of course, the women had a different name for him--""widow maker"".An old flame of Maddox appears from ten years ago.  Laura is married to one of the men Maddox has come to arrest.Maddox takes a special interest in Crowe Wheelwright played by Richard Jordan in his film debut.  Perhaps, Maddox sees himself in the young Crowe, and Crowe needs Maddox's approval and acceptance.The ending with the gunfight is not a typical western.  It has overtones of the human drama of what make men what they are.

Bert Lancaster has been a lawman for twenty years, dedicated to the principle that he must obey the law; he will treat people kindly, but only so far as the law allows. He has killed many men in bringing justice to the old west, and is known as the ""widow maker."" It is 1887. While he is out of town catching a thief, a group of cowhands, under the leadership of a very rich landowner, Lee J. Cobb, ride into town to celebrate, drink too much, and shoot up the town. By accident, one of their shots kills an old man. Accident or not, Lancaster is determined to follow the law and go after them, even if it means that more people will die.He rides to the town run by Cobb and gives Cobb and his men one day to surrender. Otherwise he will come for them. Cobb does not want to surrender his men. He emphasizes that the killing was an accident. He tells Lancaster he is willing to pay a fine for the damages his men did to the town. He says he will also set up a fund for the dead man's family. Lancaster refuses. Cobb and his men must follow the law, they must be tried by a jury, and a judge must decide their fate. This is ironic and a tragedy since everyone knows that the town judge would settle the matter as Cobb wants and that Cobb is essentially a very good man. But as far as Lancaster is concerned, he must follow the law.Cobb waivers, but he has a foreman who is like a brother to him, who is a hot head. He rushes into town and ""calls Lancaster out,"" and Lancaster kills him in a fair fight. Now Cobb is enraged and so are his men, and they vow to kill Lancaster. Thus, this film shows what can happen if people are overzealous and have misplaced emotions and are unable to pause and think. Viewers watching will find out what happens to Cobb and his men, one of whom is his son.

This one is fantastic and one of my favorite DVDs.  I have seen Lawman  numerous times because of the excellent story line and good acting of Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan and Lee J. Cobb.  This is a story about an ethical and honest lawman who is determined  to bring the men to justice who killed an old man while shooting up a town in a drunkin rage.  Burt Lancaster plays Jered Maddox, a rugged uncompromising lawman from the town the old man was killed at, and he rides into a town just about owned by Vincent Bronson (Lee J. Cobb).  The drunk cowboys involved all work for Lee J. Cob .  Robert Ryan plays a burned out but  honest sheriff who actually works for Lee J. Cobb.  He delivers the tough message from lawman Maddox.Once the message is delivered to Bronson, that lawman Maddox is going to take those men with him back with him or shoot them where they stand.  The conflict, drama and test of wills now begins.  There are also some great performances by other actors in this film.  The entire town is against Maddox but he is firm and remains determined to do his job as a law man.  This is excellent American rugged individualism  at its best.

141297,A30TK6U7DNS82R,0792838505,Kevin Killian,"[7, 9]","LAWMAN is one of the best Westerns made in 1971.  Burt Lancaster looks a little chubby, but no more so than John Wayne around this time. there must have been some high calorie vittles served up in Dodge City.  Robert Ryan plays a character whose name is actually ""Ryan,"" Cotton Ryan, so when the other characters talk to him, they're always saying, ""Ryan?"" and when he answers ""Yes,"" it's kind of strange.  Robert Ryan looks terrific here.  It's hard to believe such a vital force in the US cinema would soon be gone.  Lee J. Cobb is also in the movie, and his head is as bald as a turkey egg, I had never realized what an imposing head Cobb has but he uses it in almost every scene, to emphasize his evil ways and his belief that any man can be bought.  If that isn't acting chops enough, the movie also features Robert Duvall, looking young and suave.For the love interest, Sheree North plays ""Laura,"" the former girlfriend of Lancaster's character.  Lancaster gives her until noon to deliver her husband to him on a silver platter as it were.  Naturally Laura is torn between the husband she's grown fond of and her embery passion for Lancaster.  Sheree North, once a Hollywood It Girl and Fox's replacement for Marilyn Monroe (should Monroe turn ugly) looks worn and frazzled, from living on the frontier ekeing out existence on a farm.

The Barney-like character played by Ryan sees the big picture and is pragmatic and compromising.  He's wants peace and quiet in the town even if it means overlooking the letter of the law sometimes.  But he is weak.Lancaster is the strong one, but with no concern for peace and quiet.  He's myopically focused on executing the letter of the law without any regard for the surrounding circumstances.That said the movie is full of moral questions and I think most are portrayed very well.  Maddox is a good man, with many faults, as are the other characters.  It really makes you think about the imperfections of the world we live in and how applying the ""rules"" in a very strict manner doesn't always make sense.  Maddox is unwilling to make any sort of compromise until it is too late.  Still, you see his resignation & compromise at the end as a maturation and humility of his character that is endearing & human.Of course that lasts only a brief moment as the final shootout looms and he snaps back into his executioner role even gunning down the cowardly Hurd Price in the back as he flees.  That is the most morally vexing moment of the film for me.  It was completely unnecessary, but in the heat of the battle maybe Maddox just blew it.  You're left wondering.Anyway, the cinematography I found to be very good.  Lee J. Cobb as Bronson does a great job reflecting on his difficult, costly rise to power and giving credit to those he's defeated along the way.  He has no stomach at his age for further violence but when Maddox justifiably guns down his lifelong partner he feels he has no choice but to fight to the end.The role of Duvall as Vernon Adams sort of plays out the theme of the movie in a miniature subplot.  He feels he has done nothing wrong and just wants to be left alone.  He is willing to shoot Maddox in the back to make hime go away.  He is a villain (though a somewhat passive one), but you can sympathize with the predicament he's in.  Ultimately his pride and poor decisions get him shot.The heroic Maddox makes as many mistakes as the bad guys in this one.  I don't think it's moral relativism to say Maddox could have sought justice in a less violent way.  But killing, admittedly, is what he is best at, and that's how he gets the job done.

However, he still has the marvelous acting qualities that make his work stand out.The direction, on the other hand, his a bit hit and miss for me. While the mood and atmosphere created by Winner are almost perfect, his &quot;Bad 70s TV Action-Zoom Cam&quot; gets in the way, with the camera zipping everywhere but where it ought to be. Much of this film called for more subtle camera motion, and the abuse of the zoom lens effect permanently marks the film as a product of its time.On the plus side, the aging gunfighters depicted by Lancaster, Cobb, and Ryan, the feeling of changing times, and the sense of a closing chapter in the history of the West are all spot on. It called to mind moments in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; or another Lancaster film, &quot;The Professionals&quot;, in which the day of the gunfighter has all but ended, leaving the few remaining with a stuggle to find their place.Ryan and Cobb are equally good here, but Ryan probably gets the edge. His character shows the gunfighter coming to terms with modern times by giving in and becoming part of them. Cobb depicts the will to change if only events would allow it. Lancaster is the embodiment of justice in the Old West, and change is resisted.Familliar faces pop up here and there, with Ralph Waite (Pa on &quot;The Waltons&quot;) and John Hillerman (Higgins of &quot;Magnum, PI&quot;) both in minor supporting roles. Waite plays one of the bad guys (in muttonchops!), while Hillerman is a citizen in the background. Hillerman's western accent is British instead, which is probably why he got only two lines in this one.A good, solid western, set in a stark evaporating frontier town  just before 1900, the film is a keeper. The ending is a bit out of place and not particularly satisfying, but it is not rediculous. If you can sit through an hour and forty minutes of the Action Zoom Cam, you will find another wonderful Lancaster film waiting for you.",4,Lancaster still has it...,1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,1992,"['1971', 'film', 'Lancaster', 'bit', 'prime', 'However', 'still', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'qualities', 'make', 'work', 'stand', 'out.The', 'direction', 'other', 'hand', 'bit', 'hit', 'miss', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'Winner', 'are', 'almost', 'perfect', 'quot', 'Bad', '70s', 'TV', 'Action-Zoom', 'Cam', 'quot', 'way', 'camera', 'zipping', 'everywhere', 'where', 'ought', 'be', 'Much', 'film', 'called', 'more', 'subtle', 'camera', 'motion', 'abuse', 'zoom', 'effect', 'permanently', 'film', 'product', 'time.On', 'plus', 'side', 'aging', 'gunfighters', 'depicted', 'Lancaster', 'Cobb', 'Ryan', 'feeling', 'changing', 'times', 'sense', 'closing', 'chapter', 'history', 'West', 'are', 'spot', 'called', 'mind', 'moments', 'quot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'quot', 'Lancaster', 'film', 'quot', 'Professionals', 'quot', 'day', 'gunfighter', 'ended', 'leaving', 'few', 'remaining', 'stuggle', 'find', 'place.Ryan', 'Cobb', 'are', 'equally', 'good', 'here', 'Ryan', 'probably', 'edge', 'character', 'gunfighter', 'coming', 'terms', 'modern', 'times', 'giving', 'becoming', 'part', 'Cobb', 'will', 'change', 'only', 'events', 'would', 'allow', 'Lancaster', 'embodiment', 'justice', 'Old', 'West', 'change', 'resisted.Familliar', 'pop', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Pa', 'quot', 'Waltons', 'quot', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'Higgins', 'quot', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'quot', 'minor', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Waite', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'muttonchops', 'Hillerman', 'citizen', 'background', 'Hillerman', 'western', 'accent', 'British', 'instead', 'probably', 'why', 'got', 'only', 'two', 'lines', 'one.A', 'good', 'solid', 'western', 'set', 'stark', 'evaporating', 'frontier', 'town', 'just', '1900', 'film', 'keeper', 'ending', 'bit', 'place', 'not', 'particularly', 'satisfying', 'not', 'rediculous', 'can', 'sit', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'Action', 'Zoom', 'Cam', 'will', 'find', 'wonderful', 'Lancaster', 'film', 'waiting']",N/A

That is the beginning and the end of the discussion.This is a fascinating film. What makes it so is the reaction everyone has to such an unbending, uncompromising man. The townspeople are not behind Lancaster because the men he wants to take in all work for a very important town leader that has done much to support and help the town grow. The town boss, played with complexity by Lee J. Cobb, admits his men did wrong, but wants to &quot;negotiate&quot; a kind of deal with Lancaster.Lancaster is not a negotiator. He is a killer with a star on his chest.This is the other interesting aspect of this film: as the Lancaster character tells an idealistic cowboy, &quot;a lawman is a man-killer. That is his business.&quot;All in all, a tough, lean Western with an unusually hard edge. Lancaster's ice-blue eyes dominate the film, with great performances throughout by, notably, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Ryan (as an aging gunfighter looking for an easy slide), and Robert Duvall.

Maybe those cowboys he takes down one by one really symbolize directors who had run afoul of him. This film, like Eastwood's Unforgiven, is made full in the knowledge that it may be the Star's last go around in a familiar genre. And it does not disappoint.It is almost an inverse tale of the later Unforgiven from the start in a scene of debauched cowpokes running a bit too wild in town. All the impending mayhem is launched from this initial act and cannot be stopped. But this is the lawman's side of the story, even though he too is a killer. Lancaster is the &quot;official&quot; hired gun trying to set things back to right, but his hunted men refuse for various reasons to be held accountable. This is not a good guy/bad guy conflict as we soon see with the terrific performance by Lee J. Cobb as the head rancher who doesn't like to be pushed around. It is also one of the first times I saw Richard Jordan and he gives a real human touch to the oft stereotypical young gunfighter role. Throw in Robert Duvall, Albert Salmi, and a half-dozen other good character actors and you've got an amazing depth of talent in a relatively little known film. But it is Burt Lancaster who is in charge here and he was never more like a prowling leopard with his trademark graceful moves and quick, efficient violence. There is some discussion about whether Lancaster should have shot the last man, but I think it was the ultimate statement of his character: weary of the miscreants he deals with, he is no longer the lawman, but an avenging angel. He is committing to action what could be remembered as Lancaster's signature catchphrase, &quot;See you in Hell!&quot;The ending may leave you wanting or satisfied, but it is consistent for a man who has alienated all around him. He has done his job and is damned for it. Lawman, like the title, is  quintessential Western lore, exploring an area that had been dealt with before, but never better.

Maddox wants justice, and the cattleman doesn't want to give his men up for what he sees as an accident and a misunderstanding. Bloodshed ensues.This was one of Lancaster's last Westerns, and in each of his Westerns, he maintained either one of two personas. He was either playing a serious, sober, by-the-book lawman or soldier, or he was playing a crazy, devil-may-care adventurer who may or may not have morals or scruples. He was definitely playing the latter in Lawman. His character is earnest and thoughtful, but has no gray area when comes to the law.

141313,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0792838505,Trevor Willsmer,"[12, 15]","If nothing else, Lawman proves that there is such a thing as a script so good that not even Michael Winner could screw it up, although having an excellent cast doesn't hurt. Burt Lancaster is the lawman of the title, determined to bring in several cattlemen (Robert Duvall among them) only to find that the local boss Lee J. Cobb owns the town and its once famous, now cowardly world-weary sheriff Robert Ryan, who all but steals the film. Curiously, Ryan far preferred this film to The Wild Bunch, though that may be down to Winner's deference to his stars compared with the thoroughly miserable time he had working with Peckinpah (there's another Peckinpah connection in composer Jerry Fielding, who contributes a good, brooding score). Joseph Wiseman, Richard Jordan, Albert Salmi and Sheree North are also thrown into the mix, and surprisingly all of them have well defined characters in what becomes an increasingly complex morality play about the void between what's legal and what's practical as Lancaster begins to realize that his strict adherence to the letter of the law has left him with nothing else in his life.At times Gerald Wilson's script is perhaps a tad overwritten - everyone gets their big scene explaining their worldview, with no-one truly bad, merely weak - but it's a forgivable weakness. Winner's not quite as overly reliant on crash zooms as usual, though his characteristic laziness does manifest itself in one scene that has characters ride up to Cobb's house in darkness and come into the room in daylight, but for someone like Winner that's almost verging on the competent by his standards. Sadly MGM/UA's Region 1 DVD is a stinker of a transfer, looking like it was shot through a dirty window.

Burt Lancaster is a marshal rounding up cowhands who shot up his town and accidentally killed a citizen. He's so insistent on following ""the rules"" that he's unwilling to consider a reasonable compromise, such as letting Lee J Cobb bribe the judge. (As Lancaster admits, he's not a hanging judge, and the hands would probably get off with a fine, bribe or no bribe.)The only person with common sense is the sheriff, Robert Ryan, who's under Cobb's thumb, with no power to do the right thing. Once Cobb's business partner threatens Lancaster and is killed, the possibility of a sensible solution evaporates, and the body count mounts. The ending is brutal and heartbreaking; have a Kleenex or two handy.""Lawman"" is thematically similar to ""Unforgiven"", with everyone working toward their own misguided idea of justice. The script -- a model of saying a lot with few words -- generally avoids pompous declamations and finds ways of freshening clich&eacute;s. (I particularly liked the euphemism for ""pissed his pants"" -- ""wet between the legs"".)The transfer is from a good theatrical print. Other than the reel-change marks, there's only an occasional speck or scratch. Colors are muted in a plausible ""old-West"" way, but blood sometimes looks like red paint.

141316,A1DZSBTVCJ883,0792838505,W. Walker,"[2, 2]","Almost everything succeeds wonderfully about this forgotten melodramatic western classic.There's plenty of gunplay, with several classic 'High Noon'-type showdowns, unexpected twists, great casting, especially Bert Lancaster, and excellent cinematography. But, the main reason it should be considered among the best westerns is that it's basically a message melodrama, dramatizing questions about the wisdom and justice of some aspects of legal justice systems. True, if yu need occasional humor and satisfying romantic dalliances to balance the heavy stuff, this film may not be for you. How does Lancaster find the location and names of a gang of transient cowboys who accidentally killed an old man in shooting up his town? Presumably, this is why it took months before he shows up in a distant frontier town to confront the accused. We also wonder how he found and recognized the first victim of his quest, whose body he brings with him to this distant town. But, these and other unresolved details are minor faults in an overall compelling drama.Even at age 58, Lancaster brings an almost maniacal intensity to his characterization of the ideal incorruptible western lawman, who bends not a twig in fulfilling his duty of apprehending the accused. Be they notorious scoundrels or among the most respected or politically powerful members of the community, he expected them all to answer equally for their alleged legal transgressions. No extra-legal mediation, nor under the table  payoffs, no lawman cowed by the local power elite. This is the only way he can live with himself, he says. Maybe, but we wonder by his actions and words if he may also be part pathological killer junkie, hiding behind a badge. Or, possibly, as he claims, he has become trigger-happy as a necessity in staying alive in his profession.The most ironic aspect of this story is that Lancaster, in trying to legally apprehend a whole gang of accused, in effect, is extracting vigilante justice for an accidental murder. In fact, he initiates a chain of violence that far surpasses the instigatng murder. This is still a relevant potential problem in today's law enforcement world(Think high speed chases, for example.)It's interesting to compare Lancaster's gunslinger character in 'Vera Cruz' vs. in the present film, as they are basically very similar and yet quite different. In 'Vera Cruz', Lancaster's character is a grasping, trigger-happy, braggart soldier of fortune. Gary Cooper's character tries to reform his excesses, but fails, thus he is marked for death. In the present film, Lancaster's character takes on some of Cooper's character in 'Vera Cruz'. He is fianlly convinced(by an old flame) to end the violence his sense of duty has precipitated. But the remaining accused and the kin of one killed accused won't let him change. He must endure their collective showdown(with some essential help from a Doc Holiday-like character). Thus, he again ends the story an unchanged man(Is this good or bad?). The ending may also represent a lament that society often won't allow those who beget even one violent act a chance to redeem themselves. They are marked for life as a potentially violent or criminal person, an often self-fulfilling prophesy.",5,still the fastest gun in the west!,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,3238,"['Almost', 'everything', 'wonderfully', 'forgotten', 'melodramatic', 'western', 'plenty', 'gunplay', 'several', 'classic', ""Noon'-type"", 'showdowns', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'great', 'casting', 'especially', 'Bert', 'Lancaster', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'main', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'best', 'westerns', 'basically', 'message', 'melodrama', 'dramatizing', 'questions', 'wisdom', 'justice', 'aspects', 'legal', 'justice', 'systems', 'True', 'yu', 'need', 'occasional', 'humor', 'satisfying', 'romantic', 'dalliances', 'balance', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'How', 'Lancaster', 'find', 'location', 'names', 'gang', 'transient', 'cowboys', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'old', 'man', 'shooting', 'up', 'town', 'Presumably', 'why', 'took', 'months', 'up', 'distant', 'frontier', 'town', 'confront', 'accused', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'found', 'recognized', 'first', 'victim', 'quest', 'body', 'distant', 'town', 'other', 'unresolved', 'details', 'are', 'minor', 'faults', 'overall', 'compelling', 'drama.Even', 'age', '58', 'Lancaster', 'almost', 'maniacal', 'intensity', 'characterization', 'ideal', 'incorruptible', 'western', 'lawman', 'who', 'not', 'twig', 'fulfilling', 'duty', 'apprehending', 'accused', 'notorious', 'scoundrels', 'most', 'respected', 'politically', 'powerful', 'members', 'community', 'expected', 'answer', 'equally', 'alleged', 'legal', 'transgressions', 'extra-legal', 'mediation', 'table', 'payoffs', 'lawman', 'cowed', 'local', 'power', 'elite', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'live', 'Maybe', 'wonder', 'actions', 'words', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'part', 'pathological', 'killer', 'junkie', 'hiding', 'badge', 'possibly', 'become', 'trigger-happy', 'necessity', 'staying', 'alive', 'profession.The', 'most', 'ironic', 'aspect', 'story', 'Lancaster', 'trying', 'legally', 'apprehend', 'whole', 'gang', 'accused', 'effect', 'extracting', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'accidental', 'murder', 'fact', 'chain', 'violence', 'far', 'instigatng', 'murder', 'still', 'relevant', 'potential', 'problem', 'today', 'law', 'enforcement', 'world', 'Think', 'high', 'speed', 'chases', 'example', 'interesting', 'compare', 'Lancaster', 'gunslinger', 'character', ""'Vera"", 'Cruz', 'vs.', 'present', 'film', 'are', 'basically', 'very', 'similar', 'yet', 'quite', 'different', ""'Vera"", 'Cruz', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'grasping', 'trigger-happy', 'braggart', 'soldier', 'fortune', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'character', 'tries', 'reform', 'excesses', 'fails', 'thus', 'marked', 'death', 'present', 'film', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'Cooper', 'character', ""'Vera"", 'Cruz', 'fianlly', 'convinced', 'old', 'flame', 'end', 'violence', 'sense', 'duty', 'precipitated', 'remaining', 'accused', 'kin', 'one', 'killed', 'accused', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'change', 'must', 'endure', 'collective', 'showdown', 'essential', 'help', 'Doc', 'Holiday-like', 'character', 'Thus', 'again', 'story', 'unchanged', 'man', 'good', 'bad', 'ending', 'may', 'also', 'represent', 'lament', 'society', 'often', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'who', 'beget', 'even', 'one', 'violent', 'act', 'chance', 'redeem', 'are', 'marked', 'life', 'potentially', 'violent', 'criminal', 'person', 'often', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophesy']",N/A
