599147,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLF1,A Customer,"[5, 15]","Summary:Sydney A. Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a college student and the daughter of two secret agents, one good - her father, Jonathan 'Jack' Donahue Bristow (Victor Garber) - and one bad - her mother, Laura Bristow (Lena Olin).  With her past so heavily associated with spying, it only makes sense for the leader of the top secret organization, SD-6, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), to recruit her to work for him.  The problem is that Arvin initially tells Sydney that his organization is a branch of the CIA, but it doesn't take long for Sydney, with the help of her father, to figure out that SD-6 isn't the CIA.When she realizes this she then goes to the CIA with the intent of bringing SD-6 down.  She is assigned a handler, Michael C. Vaughn (Michael Vartan), who gives her counter missions for each of her missions she is assigned to by SD-6.  So Sydney, like her father, Jack, becomes a double agent - working for both the CIA and SD-6.In all of this it is slowly revealed that Sydney's mother, Laura, who supposedly died when Sydney was a child, didn't actually die.  As it turns out, Laura is actually one of the leaders of the 'evil' organization that opposes both the CIA and SD-6.  Eventually Sydney is going to have to find her mother and face her.My Comments:I have to admit that the idea for the show is a pretty cool one - a college student who flies to exotic locations on a weekly basis to perform secret missions for a top secret organization.  It sounds like it would be a lot of fun.Also impressive is the production of the series.  There are a lot of locations and the scope of the series is often more of a feature film than a television series with Sydney having to travel all around the world.But there are some problems.  First, the story isn't really great.  There are an awful lot of coincidences and people are continuously doing things that no one would do in real life.  For instance, Sydney tells her fianc&eacute; once they become engaged that she is working for a secret organization, SD-6.  SD-6 finds out about this and has him killed.  Sydney is upset, but she goes back to work for them and, what's more, they let her come back.  Sure, I understand that they tried to explain all of this by Sydney becoming a double agent for the CIA and also giving SD-6 something that they really wanted in order for her to come back, but it was pretty far-fetched and very unrealistic.  There is also the whole rip-off of 'The Prophecy' from some ancient philosopher, who is really just a combination of Nostradamus and Leonardo DaVinci.  It's pretty silly and ends up giving the show the aura of a strung out and loosely concocted X-Files episode with all sorts of mystical conspiracy theories.Also, with most TV shows there is at least some effort to create deeper story lines for the characters.  This show doesn't actually have any of those because Sydney's deeper story is her search for her mother, which just happens to be the same thing she is doing as an agent for the two organizations.  What you see is about all there is in this series.  So, I haven't been too impressed with the story.The episodes are also really, really repetitive, with only an occasional exception.  Essentially what you have is some inane mission that is just an excuse to dress up Jennifer Garner in some very sexy clothing and then watch her kick people.  I have to admit that whoever is in charge of Jennifer's wardrobe and wigs is doing a great job of coming up with new outfits, but maybe she should occasionally just go like most secret agents do - looking like herself.  But, of course, this never happens.  Ironically, her partner in all of this, Agent Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), never dresses up.  He's always wearing either technical gear or a tuxedo or suit - he's your standard James Bond like character.As for the acting... It really isn't that bad.  Sadly, the weakest link in all of this is probably the star - Jennifer Garner.  I can't say I'm really surprised that her performance is only mediocre on her good days considering her absolutely pathetic performance in Daredevil.  But what I have noticed is that they try to keep her dialogue to a minimum.  Now, whether or not this is intentional or just a side effect of the format of the show, I don't really know.  But the effect it has is to turn Jennifer Garner into a sexy actress that only has to kick people (see above, the apart about the 'inane missions') but never really has to talk to anyone.  Considering that she doesn't do a great job of delivering her lines, I can't really blame the director's and writer's on this - it would really ruin the show if we had to listen to Jennifer Garner the whole time.The rest of the cast is actually okay.  Of course I can't help but notice that Michael Vartan, like Jennifer Garner, is just a bit too good-looking to be a CIA agent; with his looks he should be a model, which he probably was before he became an actor.  But his performances, which are generally rather short sequences, aren't too bad.  Also pretty good is Sydney's father, Victor Garber, who I think is probably the best actor on the show.Overall, the series is probably fairly interesting to some people, but I have found it to be rather shallow.  There isn't much depth to the plots, most of the plot reversals are rather clich&eacute;, and the primary focus seems to be on Jennifer Garner's ability to dress sexily and kick people (I think I like that phraseology).  The box set of the first season actually comes with quite a few extra features, which makes owning this a good investment if you've liked the show.  If you haven't, well, then you'll obviously not be interested in what they have to offer as most of the special features revolve around how cool Jennifer Garner is for doing her own stunts.  I'd recommend this for Jennifer Garner fans, but that's about it.",3,"Decent series, pretty good box set",1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,5867,"['Summary', 'Sydney', 'A.', 'Bristow', 'Jennifer',

599148,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B00005JLF1,Alcee Arobin,"[2, 2]","Back in 2001 when ALIAS first premiered, I remember watching the pilot episode on ABC on a Sunday night.  It was incredibly entertaining, and I was greatly intrigued.  It was so different from anything that had been shown on TV at the time.  ABC had went on a publicity craze with the show, running 30 second clips for months in advance; not to mention ALIAS was essentially the first TV show to act as a marketing device (notice the constant presence of the Nokia phones, and in Season Two the love affair with the Ford Focus).  Anyway, I'm always looking for one show that I can make plans to watch, something that can be ""my show.""  At the time, I had decided that ALIAS would receive this notable honor.  But, as is always the case, by the next week I was busy and I'd already forgotten.  Long story short, earlier this year when ALIAS entered syndication, I caught a 1 AM episode and remembered why I'd been so excited about the show to begin with.  So, I went out and bought ALIAS Season One.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.The first season of ALIAS is truly phenomenal.  It's a master at employing those wonderful, old-school cliffhanger endings.  I'll avoid repeating the basic story arc, as you can read that in any of the other reviews.  Just let me join the rest of the Amazon review crew in saying that this really is one of the best shows on television.  It's smart, suspenseful, and sleek.  How addicted did I become to this show?  Buy the end of Season One, I was practically going through withdrawals.  For Christmas I picked up Seasons 2, 3 and 4.  Right now I'm on Episode 18 of Season Two.  I must admit, it's not quite as good as the original season.  The first half was absolutely dismal.  But, somewhere around Episode 10, it reverts to the old Season One edge-of-your-seat style.  Yet unfortunately, ALIAS (after having its old time slot rearranged) has recently been canceled after five seasons.  The only good thing is that ABC will allow the show to finish out its five year, 110 episode career as opposed to just blindly yanking it from the winter lineup.  It's a classy move considering ALIAS really was the first series to put ABC back on the map in an era pre Desperate Housewives/Lost/Grey's Anatomy/Commander in Chief, when NBC and Friends ruled the airwaves (and my how the times change).  Bottom line:  ALIAS Season One is a great buy and if you do become addicted like the rest of us, at least you'll know you won't be getting caught up in a show that never got to complete itself.  And here's a BIG tip if you're like myself and are new to the ALIAS franchise and will be watching it play out on DVD:  don't read or watch anything even remotely related to ALIAS.  It's a show that over the years has been chop-full of surprises and twists.

Much like the similar 24, Alias loved to take its audience through each week's episode at a breakneck pace only to leave you cliff-hangered until the next episode.  Watching the show on DVD is the way to go, as it allows you to slam back four to five episodes at a clip.As you likely know by now, Jennifer Garner is Sydney Bristow, a college co-ed looking for some direction in life.  She is nothing short of amazed when she is recruited to a super-secret branch of the CIA.  Or is she ?  We quickly discover that Syd is actually working for the bad guys.  But in the best cloak and dagger tradition, she works her way deeper into the organization to make the world safer.  Working with the real CIA, she takes on missions for the evil SD6, keeping tabs on the bad guys and working in a concurrent ""counter mission"".The cast of characters is top drawer.  Ron Rifkin plays the evil Arvin Sloane, while Carl Lumbly is the likeable and loyal Marcus Dixon.  One of the true standouts is Kevin Weisman, SD-6's resident gadget guru(think ""Q"" only quirkier).

She is an operative for a super-secret black ops division of the CIA called SD-6.  Or is she?  She was sworn to secrecy about the agency, but when she told her new fianc&eacute; about SD-6, he was killed by SD-6 security officers.  Sydney then learned two things; the first is that her father, Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is a senior officer of SD-6, and that she is not part of the CIA.  SD-6 is part of a group called the Alliance of 12, which is an enemy of the United States.  There are SD cells across the globe, and their goal is to destroy the U.S. and its allies and become ever more powerful.  So Syd goes to Langley to join the real CIA and become a double agent inside SD-6.  Finally, she realizes that Jack is another CIA double who has infiltrated SD-6.  And that's all in the pilot episode.  As the season goes on, Sydney reports her missions to her CIA handler, Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), who gives her counter-missions.  Many of these missions pit Sydney against the K-Directorate, a modern version of the KGB.  However, things begin to get complicated when a man named Milo Rambaldi, a sixteenth century prophet, comes into the picture.  Rambaldi has unfinished work, and he left artifacts all over the world so that someone in the future would.  Soon, a new organization emerges, led by the mysterious The Man, whose identity could mean trouble for Sydney, Jack, and Vaughn.This is an amazing show with twists and turns that rival those of 24, which I believe to be the greatest show in history.  The stories are great, the acting is, for the most part, superb, and the cliffhangers definitely fulfill their purpose.

Sydney Bristow, a special agent/grad student who uncovers that she works for an enemy of the government - rather than for the government itself - when her fiance is killed, is a layered, fascinating, funny, friendly and emotional heroine that you'll enjoy getting to know. Oh, and she's an AMAZING superspy capable of daring stunts, amazing disguises and narrow escapes. She masters languages, reads lips, breaks down complicated ancient codes in her head AND she kicks serious butt.Every episode of ALIAS is layered both in deep emotional issues and international intrigue and suspense. It's incredibly well-written, terribly complicated, well-made by J.J. Abrams and very well-acted by the ensemble cast, headlined by Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan and the superb Victor Garber.The highlight of the first season is watching Syd seriously try to function in her double life without getting caught by her friends Will and Francie or, worse, by SD-6, the horrible, villainous organization that she's working for and working against at the same time.And the first season, as great and compelling as it is, is just the cliffhanger-filled opening act for the dazzling, twisted second season.Try these DVDs if you've ever, ever even considered trying ALIAS but haven't yet.

After the show I was hooked.  Alias takes all of the best elements of the spy/action genre and turns them into an appealing brew.  Exotic locales, over-the-top action and costumes, hair-raising torture, cool gadgets and a nail biting cliff-hanger at the end of just about every episode insure your waiting with baited breath until the next episode.For neophyte fans like myself, the season 1 DVD set is invaluable to knowing the entire story of Sydney's adventures up until this season (many of the current episodes contain hints at events from earlier episodes).There are some notable flaws to the show mixed in with the great moments.  Michael Vartan seems to always look like a whipped puppy, the ""Snowman"" sub-plot seemed to be something the writers tacked on so Jennifer Garner could have sex with someone and Ms. Garner cries way too much for a trained spy.

Being a big fan of the series of course I loved rewatching the episodes, seeing the beginnings of the season and the developments of the Sydney Bristow character.

The ongoing plot stays crisp adding many twists and turns until you finally hit the finally, which is a very good reflection and completion of the initial premiere episode.So what makes every DVD special is the bonus material. Alias Season one offers a nice range of extra's on the last disc of this six disc set. The outtakes (gag reel) and production notebooks are fun to watch and very informative and the stunt special is definitely a must see for all fans.

The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files.  It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman.  But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency.  However, problems arise when her fianc&eacute; is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all...  In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent.  Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work.  Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...Below is a list of episodes included on the Alias (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Truth Be Told)Episode 2 (So It Begins)Episode 3 (Parity)Episode 4 (A Broken Heart)Episode 5 (Doppelganger)Episode 6 (Reckoning)Episode 7 (Color-Blind)Episode 8 (Time Will Tell)Episode 9 (Mea Culpa)Episode 10 (Spirit)Episode 11 (The Confession)Episode 12 (The Box: Part 1)Episode 13 (The Box: Part 2)Episode 14 (The Coup)Episode 15 (Page 47)Episode 16 (The Prophecy)Episode 17 (Q & A)Episode 18 (Masquerade)Episode 19 (Snowman)Episode 20 (The Solution)Episode 21 (Rendezvous)Episode 22 (Almost Thirty Years)The DVD Report",5,One of the best TV shows of the past several years...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,1905,"['Premiering', 'September', '2001', 'Alias', 'built', 'steady', 'loyal', 'following', 'television', 'viewers', 'show', 'fast', 'pace', 'action', 'sequences', '24', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'backdrop', 'X-Files', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'show', 'character', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'true', 'strength', 'Alias', 'most', 'successful', 'TV', 'shows', 'unique', 'creative', 'writers', 'who', 'manage', 'always', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'star', '13', 'Going', 'Thirty', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Anne', 'Bristow', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'American', 'woman', 'recruited', 'work', 'government', 'super', 'secret', 'SD-6', 'agency', 'However', 'problems', 'arise', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'murdered', 'agency', 'ultimately', 'SD-6', 'not', 'legitimate', 'government', 'organization', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Sydney', 'CIA', 'deploy', 'double', 'agent', 'Meanwhile', 'Sydney', 'estranged', 'father', 'Jack', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'result', 'work', 'Together', 'manage', 'eliminate', 'SD-6', 'now', 'work', 'full-time', 'CIA', 'where', ""'re"", 'accompanied', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'Marshall', 'Flinkman', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Alias', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'Episode', '2', 'Episode', '3', 'Parity', 'Episode', '4', 'A', 'Broken', 'Heart', 'Episode', '5', 'Doppelganger', 'Episode', '6', 'Reckoning', 'Episode', '7', 'Color-Blind', 'Episode', '8', 'Time', 'Will', 'Tell', 'Episode', '9', 'Mea', 'Culpa', 'Episode', '10', 'Spirit', 'Episode', '11', 'Confession', 'Episode', '12', 'Box', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '13', 'Box', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '14', 'Coup', 'Episode', '15', 'Page', '47', 'Episode', '16', 'Prophecy', 'Episode', '17', 'Q', 'A', 'Episode', '18', 'Masquerade', 'Episode', '19', 'Snowman', 'Episode', '20', 'Solution', 'Episode', '21', 'Rendezvous', 'Episode', '22', 'Almost', 'Thirty', 'Years', 'DVD', 'Report']",Alias - The Complete First Season

For all the impossible plot lines and unbelievable characters, ALIAS is just a great show for mindless escapism and entertainment.  If you can suspend disbelief, you might find that this show is for you.  Just a short survey of some of the unlikely characters in this show:Jack Bristow was married to a Russian spy who used him for an information source in the CIA.  He spent a year in jail under suspicion for being a spy himself.  Yet, Jack is a trusted double agent? He works with his daughter at the CIA and SD6?  Give me a break.Sydney Bristow is the lead in the series.  She is a college student turned secret agent.  Despite looking like head stuck on a stick figure, she is somehow able to perform almost superhuman feats of strength, athleticism, and agility.  Likewise, she is a super smart, hyper aware double agent, who never gets caught despite the fact that she wears her heart on her sleeve and is willing to break any protocol for a friend or relative.Marshal Flinkman (sp) is the tech-guy who works at SD6 and later at the CIA. He is, to this reviewer anyway, the most believable character on the show.  Despite being used primarily for comic relief and creating from scratch impossible devices, he is the only person who carries the quite confidence and energy that I would expect a real intelligence expert to have.This review could go on and on just talking about all the weird, interesting, and unlikely characters.  Sydney's mother, the evil head of SD-6, Michael Vaughn, Sydney's partner at SD-6, and more - including the cool bald guy from LOST and JAG.  However, rest assured, it is entertaining.Finally, while the show itself is a bizarre labyrinth of betrayal, plot twists, and surprise endings; it is just fun to watch.

Now she's a double agent whose mission is to bring SD-6 down before someone else gets hurt and the only other agent she can trust is none other than her estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber). Alias is a surprisingly good drama of the action variety full of tight-knit plots and clever twists. There's time for important character development between the action scenes, and several additional plots (both romantically and professionally) flesh out the time outside SD-6. One of the finest things about the show is how well we get to know and understand the motivations of all the characters -- not merely Sydney. This is very important when it comes to the villain, Slone (Ron Rifkin), a man so corrupt he ordered Sydney's boyfriend killed but who endures a chilling turn of the tables when his own wife is targeted by the Alliance.This thinking mans show requires a great deal of emotional commitment. The episodes build on one another, often leaving off in terrifying cliffhangers. Don't start the series unless you're prepared to devote some time to finishing it. Add into the plot the attentions of Sydney's best friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper), a reporter with the local newspaper who thinks there's something amiss with Danny's death, and a number of side plots involving everything from romantic relationships to rat-infested apartments and you have a truly complex series with a surprising amount of heart. Even minor characters you learn to care about. The villain of the piece is surprisingly empathetic; as much as you hate and fear the man, you also abhor the thought of seeing him tortured. There's also a nice piece of romantic tension involving Sydney's handler at the CIA, a good looking agent by the name of Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan).The show is not perfect but the first season is surprisingly decent. Unfortunate amounts of language creep into most of the dialogue (along with some unsavory comments like ""screw you,"" and ""bite me,"" and a** gets a regular workout), but the TV14 rating comes from violence (major hand-to-hand combat, as well as some shootouts, dead bodies, and explosions) more than anything else. In the first episode we discover this isn't a sugar-coated glimpse into espionage when terrorists extract Sydney's molar after she refuses them information. Scenes of violent combat aren't what stuck with me after the closing credits -- it was the implications of gory torture sessions. Mouths pried open and teeth drills humming, hot-tipped needles being driven into hands, necks, and arms. One agent, knowing he won't be able to get free in time to turn off an access code with his fingerprint, has his partner cut off his finger and take it with him to the keypad.The series is an all out exploration of hand to hand combat. People are struck in the back of the head, hit with tranquilizer darts, pummeled to the ground, kicked in the face, thrown against walls, injected with needles, and tortured. Characters get bloody after being beat up (many scenes are painful to watch due to the absolute devastation of their faces) and bloody corpses are often seen laying around in background shots. By far the most intense scenes of violence come from agents forced to keep their cover by abusing someone else. A man's arm is broken under the pretense of getting information. Characters are tied to chairs and threatened with torture devices -- hot needles, a lack of pain medication, and other heartless methods. The violence is so extreme viewers should be warned that its realism, while never overly graphic (we don't see the finger cut off or the arm broken, but instead hear it) is not for the faint of heart.Only three of the 22 episodes have anything sexual in them. The first episode is by far the worst, primarily through the power of suggestion. Sydney and Danny are obviously in a sexual relationship outside the sanctity of marriage. He lays on top of her on the couch and kisses her bare stomach, talking about how one day they're going to have lots of beautiful children. Uneasy about the lies between them, Sydney takes him into the bathroom and tells him to get undressed. They both climb into the shower (no nudity) but not for a romantic fling; she wants to tell him about SD-6 without being overheard. It's also implied most (if not all) of the main characters have a cavalier attitude about sex. Sydney's best friends are all either living with someone or casually involved elsewhere. (She knocks on Arvin's door one evening to find a coworker lounging in the background wearing his shirt; he wakes up beside her in a later scene.)Sydney also falls prey to a passionate moment with a former lover while on a mission for SD-6. They kiss passionately and partially undress each other before the show ends; the following episode opens with them curled up together under the covers, just in time to make a daring escape. Sexual tension permeates a few of the action scenes, the most notable two being in the 3rd and 7th episodes. In a narrative we see what is apparently a sexual tryst between an ex-agent and a terrorist; his back moving in and out of camera range and a long hand playing with the chain around his neck (on which is the key the woman needs for her assignment). Later in the series Sydney enters a sleazy bar undercover and flirts with the owner while scantily clad girls sway in the background behind glass (and also overhead). When she's caught trying to escape the owner licks her face. Some of her costume choices are immodest, with short skirts, cleavage-bearing tops, and skintight gowns. She also appears in a bikini on occasion. If all this content were in one film only, I would never recommend the movie in question. But since it's spread out over roughly nine hours of entertainment, it becomes less of a problem.The best thing about Alias is watching the relationship between father and daughter mature. Is Jack a good or bad guy? Each show reveals a little more of his character, first showing his cold utter lack of regard for his daughter and slowly bleeding into a true bond built on trust through trial and error. Jack Bristow is one of the most complicated of the show's characters. He's nothing short of fascinating and Victor Garber does an excellent job of portraying him. Some of his actions are positively barbaric and yet we learn to take his side as along with Sydney we slowly uncover the truth. The second element I liked was the fact her grief seems real. Too many shows replace the lost romantic lead early on and fail to portray a realistic grieving period. Sydney lives through amazing and dangerous situations but doesn't go home feeling good about herself. She cries for lost comrades, resists the romantic advances of the two men in her life, and remains faithful to Danny's memory.The bad thing about Alias is  the brutal implied violence, mildly crude language, and one element which concerns me: an agent rationalizing bad behavior. A figure we grow to respect and even like is also uncommonly brutal when faced with decisions. He breaks rules at the CIA, imposes cruel torture methods to gain information, and kills one of his informants at point-blank range. This sends mixed signals to young people searching for heroes in our corrupt society. But for mature action fans willing to devote brain time to the complex plots, Alias is an excellent alternative to 007.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,7939,"['Nominated', '11',

That I was...Here's the scoop.  Sydney Bristow, played incredibly by Jennifer Garner, is a super spy for a subsidiary of the CIA.  Her cover is a banker at an establishment called 'Credit Dauphine'.  She must hide her identity from her best friends Will and Francie, but also her boyfriend turned fiance...  That is until she told him her identity that he got killed, and the attacks turned on her, when she learned that SD-6 is actually the enemy, and she's been working with them the whole time thinking she was doing good for the world.  Now she's a double-agent working for the CIA, along with a man she barely knows, her very own father (Victor Garber).I'd love to give you more summary, but what fun would that be?  You all deserve to be on the edge of your living room couches with wide eyes and dropped jaws.  Be prepared.The show stars Jennifer Garner (Sydney Bristow), Victor Garber (Jack Bristow, Syd's father), Ron Rifkin (the vindictive Arvin Sloane, head of SD-6), and Michael Vartan (Michael Vaughn, her CIA handler, and possible love interest?).  Enjoy twists, turns, excitement, lies, and entanglement as both sides fight to come ahead, as you watch and wait for the season's incredible cliff-hanger ending.Recommended for anybody over the age of 13 with a need for excitement in their TV shows so you can get away from cheesy sitcoms and unrealistic reality TV.

599188,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JLF1,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Why such a cautionary title if it's 5 stars? Because this'll hook its teeth in you except instead of resisting you'll like it so maybe it's like your loved one play-biting? I don't know but this is quite an addicting series. Sharp-writing, intriguing plots are what await you and just like shows like Lost or 24, they're extremely big guilty pleasures where you come back week after week and what's nice about DVD is you can see it on your time without stupid sports pre-empts(I'm looking at you Fox).Sydney Bristow is a graduate student who wants to be a teacher and she has normal friends: Will, a reporter and Francine, a caterer. She has a normal career too but that's what she wants them to think: she's actually an agent working for SD-6, a cover branch of the CIA. Turns out that's not the case as SD-6 is actually the bad guys so she decides one thing: bring them down by being a double agent cooperating with the real CIA. But how does one conduct top secret business under the very nose of powerful government officials? That's the fun of it.In fact, the show is quite fun. Like 24, the show deals with espionage and classified stuff but unlike 24, Alias has gadgetry and gismos that Jack Bauer would probably break in 5 seconds beating a guy with. The show has an ultra-cool look to it and the show knows it and shows every opportunity it can while 24 is a bit more gritty and realistic(despite the show's 24 hour premise). Both are still well-written shows and they become quick guilty pleasures. In many ways one of the show's flaws is actually positive if you consider your viewing schedule. Alias is so layered in its writing that missing one episode you'd literally be lost so DVD helps, but then again it'll probably make you watch all the episodes in big marathons if you don't have much of a social life(like me).One problem that I always personally had a problem with dealing with spy shows such as this is the amount of information mentioned. Characters, minor and major, are mentioned often and at one point you're like ""wait, that was....oh that was that guy, right"". It's a bit too layered but that's alright since most of it isn't all that important and the ones that are get center stage. The characters are quite well cast and no problems with any of them. There's even such guest spots such as Roger Moore(who of course played another famous spy), Amy Irving, even Quentin Tarantino of all people. Also Saw fans will recognize Tobin Bell a.k.a Jigsaw.What'll probably become the bane of your existence in regards to this series is the idea of the cliffhanger. It of course refers to leaving a big shocking moment right when the show ends and Alias is chockful of them. Even non 2-parters get ""to be continued"" like endings and the show ends with a big one although a disadvantage of getting into a show late is that other people blab it, assuming you've watched it already. Some are too busy so when the finale's big shock comes in, I already heard it but it was still cool, just not ""holy crap!"".If you're looking for a guilty pleasure show it's easy to recommend Alias. If you're easily sucked into this kind of stuff stay away from Alias because I'm willing to bet if you're into Alias by the time Disc 1 ends, you should already be considering Season 2.",5,Watch at your own risk,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,3285,"['Why', 'cautionary', 'title', '5', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'hook', 'teeth', 'instead', 'resisting', ""'ll"", 'like', 'so', 'maybe', 'loved', 'one', 'play-biting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'addicting', 'series', 'Sharp-writing', 'intriguing', 'plots', 'are', 'what', 'just', 'shows', 'Lost', '24', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'big', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'where', 'come', 'back', 'week', 'week', 'what', 'nice', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'time', 'stupid', 'sports', 'pre-empts', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Fox', '.Sydney', 'Bristow', 'graduate', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'teacher', 'normal', 'friends', 'Will', 'reporter', 'Francine', 'caterer', 'normal', 'career', 'too', 'what', 'think', 'actually', 'agent', 'working', 'SD-6', 'cover', 'branch', 'CIA', 'out', 'not', 'case', 'SD-6', 'actually', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'thing', 'bring', 'down', 'being', 'double', 'agent', 'cooperating', 'real', 'CIA', 'how', 'one', 'conduct', 'top', 'secret', 'business', 'very', 'nose', 'powerful', 'government', 'officials', 'fun', 'it.In', 'fact', 'show', 'quite', 'fun', '24', 'show', 'espionage', 'classified', 'stuff', '24', 'Alias', 'gadgetry', 'gismos', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'would', 'probably', 'break', '5', 'seconds', 'beating', 'guy', 'show', 'ultra-cool', 'look', 'show', 'opportunity', 'can', '24', 'bit', 'more', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'show', '24', 'hour', 'premise', 'are', 'still', 'well-written', 'shows', 'become', 'quick', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'show', 'flaws', 'actually', 'positive', 'consider', 'viewing', 'schedule', 'Alias', 'so', 'layered', 'writing', 'missing', 'one', 'episode', ""'d"", 'literally', 'be', 'lost', 'so', 'DVD', 'then', 'again', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'make', 'watch', 'episodes', 'big', 'marathons', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'social', 'life', '.One', 'problem', 'always', 'personally', 'had', 'problem', 'dealing', 'spy', 'shows', 'such', 'amount', 'information', 'mentioned', 'Characters', 'minor', 'major', 'are', 'mentioned', 'often', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'wait', 'was', '.oh', 'was', 'guy', 'right', 'bit', 'too', 'layered', 'alright', 'most', ""n't"", 'important', 'ones', 'are', 'get', 'center', 'stage', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'cast', 'problems', 'even', 'such', 'guest', 'spots', 'such', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'who', 'course', 'played', 'famous', 'spy', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'even', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'people', 'Also', 'Saw', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Jigsaw.What', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'become', 'bane', 'existence', 'regards', 'series', 'idea', 'cliffhanger', 'course', 'refers', 'leaving', 'big', 'shocking', 'moment', 'right', 'when', 'show', 'Alias', 'chockful', 'Even', 'non', '2-parters', 'get', 'be', 'continued', 'endings', 'show', 'big', 'one', 'disadvantage', 'getting', 'show', 'late', 'other', 'people', 'assuming', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'already', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'so', 'when', 'finale', 'big', 'shock', 'already', 'heard', 'was', 'still', 'cool', 'just', 'not', 'holy', 'crap', ""'re"", 'looking', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'easy', 'recommend', 'Alias', ""'re"", 'easily', 'sucked', 'kind', 'stuff', 'stay', 'away', 'Alias', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', ""'re"", 'Alias', 'time', 'Disc', '1', 'ends', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'considering', 'Season', '2']",Alias - The Complete First Season

Although the series is very 21st Century, creator J.J. Abrams packs 'Alias' with lots of old school quality, making this one modern action show that multiple generations can enjoy. This series is a must for any fans of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, or TV series like 'The Man from UNCLE' or 'The Avengers.'Jennifer Garner is at the very center of 'Alias.' Playing double agent Sydney Bristow, Garner's given the task of donning a bewildering array of costumes, wigs, and accents. Although Garner's described as an overnight sensation, she'd been working steadily in smaller roles for years prior to her breakthrough in 'Alias,' and she shines particularly well when given the chance to interact with her excellent supporting cast. There's her steadfast partner Dixon (Carl Lumbly), brainy techie Marshall (Kevin Weisman, perhaps the sweetest eccentric since Radar O'Reilly), and CIA liason Vaughn (Michael Vartan). It's two old pros, however, who attract the most attention. Victor Garber plays Sydney's emotionally distant father, and Ron Rifkin plays the enigmatically evil Sloane - the chief villain of the series. You may not recognize either Garber's or Rifkin's names but you have seen these fine character actors at work in TV and movies for years.Most of the writing is very good in this season, and Buena Vista generously packed this box set with extras. I don't think anyone would reasonably expect this series to reflect the real-life workings of the CIA, so enjoy it as escapist espionage with light touches of science fiction. As good as this season is, though, it's nothing compared to the heights the series would reach in the second season.",4,Begin your Alias obsession here!,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,1780,"[""'Alias'is"", 'effective', 'hybrid', ""'Mission"", 'Impossible', 'better', 'night-time', 'soap', 'operas', ""'Dallas"", 'Crest', 'series', 'very', '21st', 'Century', 'creator', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'lots', 'old', 'school', 'quality', 'making', 'one', 'modern', 'action', 'show', 'multiple', 'generations', 'can', 'enjoy', 'series', 'must', 'fans', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'James', 'Bond', 'novels', 'TV', 'series', ""'The"", 'Man', 'UNCLE', 'Avengers', ""'Jennifer"", 'Garner', 'very', 'center', ""'Alias"", 'Playing', 'double', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Garner', 'given', 'task', 'donning', 'bewildering', 'array', 'costumes', 'wigs', 'accents', 'Garner', 'described', 'overnight', 'sensation', ""'d"", 'been', 'working', 'steadily', 'smaller', 'roles', 'years', 'prior', 'breakthrough', ""'Alias"", 'particularly', 'well', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'interact', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'steadfast', 'partner', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'brainy', 'techie', 'Marshall', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'perhaps', 'sweetest', 'eccentric', 'Radar', ""O'Reilly"", 'CIA', 'liason', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'however', 'who', 'attract', 'most', 'attention', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Sydney', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'enigmatically', 'evil', 'Sloane', 'chief', 'villain', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'Garber', 'Rifkin', 'names', 'have', 'seen', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'work', 'TV', 'movies', 'years.Most', 'writing', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'generously', 'packed', 'box', 'set', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'series', 'reflect', 'real-life', 'workings', 'CIA', 'so', 'enjoy', 'escapist', 'espionage', 'light', 'touches', 'science', 'fiction', 'As', 'good', 'season', 'though', 'nothing', 'compared', 'heights', 'series', 'would', 'reach', 'second', 'season']",Alias - The Complete First Season

JJ Abrams (Star Trek 2009) did an excellent job molding Sydney (Jennifer Garner) character into the perfect spy and a deadly adversary when needed but also a spy that considers ""collateral damage"" as well.  This is a more real scenario than the press often reports, because these people are also real people dealing with unique problems.  As a villain Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is cold as ice and twice as treacherous.  This is good TV as a matter of fact; this show elevated our normal spy show to a new level.  Characters you can relate to and real world problems taken right out of today's headlines.  The actors were great, the limited budget was used very well to compensate for the special effects used and JJ brought it all together for five seasons with Ms Garner's help of course.

599202,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00005JLF1,D. Knouse,"[1, 2]","To be completely positive from the onset I would like to write that this show is very entertaining, although a substantial suspension of disbelief must be maintained throughout if any of this show is to be taken seriously.  The acting is top-notch, the action is fun even though secret agent Sydney Bristow does have an easy time of disarming her enemies with lightning-quick kickboxing techniques (anyone with a passing interest in firearms would know she would have been shot long before her round-house kick landed); yet the most surprising aspect of this show is the cinematography.  I was constantly impressed with the professional level, movie-quality in fact, of the photography.  The lighting is lush and carefully planned, and many of the tracking shots make for some of the most breathtaking action sequences I've seen in a long time.  Jennifer Garner is the central, strong-willed yet patriotic catalyst for this story which is a potent mixture of ""La Femme Nikita"" and James Bond films with a splash of the ""X-files"" thrown in for some supernatural flavor.  That, and Jennifer Garner is a fine actress.  The rest of the cast is solid, as is the dialogue.  The dialogue is so well-written that I have to point out that the plotting is actually very predictable, at least in Season 1.  I remember countless plot-twists that I saw coming from a proverbial mile away.  I would hear all this good dialogue, see some excellent action sequences, experience some of the best acting on television, only then to be let down by either predictability, or worse, convenience for the sake of pushing the story forward.  On the back of the box for ""Alias: The Complete First Season"" it reads, ""This edge-of-your-seat collection with its heart-pounding action of unpredictable plot twists will have you gasping for air and begging for Season 2!""  By episode 11, entitled ""The Confession,"" I was starting to get a little frustrated and concerned that the writing was suffering from creative burnout.  Sydney is tortured three different times in the first 11 shows, and it was becoming ridiculous that so many of the bad-guy henchmen could be duped into thinking she is wandering through restricted areas looking for the bathroom.  But then...who shows up in episode 12 and 13, a two-parter entitled ""The Box,"" none other than the director of ""Pulp Fiction"" Quentin Tarantino.  The show gets a much-needed shot in the arm with his high energy and quirky diabolical humor.  It sounded time and again like he wrote his own dialogue for these episodes, because the writing took a giant leap skyward.  Besides, showing him and his tight band of rogue mercenaries infiltrate DS-6 to the song ""Dragula"" by Rob Zombie was easily one of the brightest highlights of the season.  The writing after that two-part show got much, much better.  There were a few more predictable plot-twists that followed, but for the most part they were forgivable (e.g. a CIA extraction that is an obvious homage to the James Bond film ""Thunderball"").  All in all, this was certainly worth my money; and after hearing that Season 2 is even better that the first season I quickly obtained a mint copy with hope and very few reservations.  This is a fun show to watch.  There is drama, action, good dialogue, professional-level photography, and with the final cliffhanger a sense that this show has a brilliant future in Season 2.

The result is a series in which one can immediately spot the film-tv historical sources for everything going on ( the last episode included in this first season makes sure to get in the famous scene with Dustin Hoffman and, was it Laurence Olivier, not a bad influence). Despite its being a pastiche of the past, Alias does have the verve, thepanache, to keep one watching in mindless thrall to each 45 minute episode. Quite helpful, I would say a vital element, is the soap opera component with its continuing saga of whether a little girl who lost her Mom can grow up to find love, happiness and fulfillment as an action hero. The stunts while repetitive are a credit to the people who plan and carry them out, the plot line of each episode, while repetitive, do sufficiently carry forward the soap opera to maintain ones interest.

Few shows (especially action series) are able to move at such a fast pace, yet retain a truly human element throughout.

In this first season, she has to keep her affiliation with the CIA a secret from both her friends and with her coworkers at SD6, while finding out about the details of her mother's death, and her father's role in both the CIA *and* SD6.The DVD set is presented in widescreen, with some documentaries, a gag reel, a few deleted scenes, and a handful of commentaries (the best of which being the cast commentary for the season finale). Aided by good writing and direction and a few well-placed instances of &quot;stunt&quot; casting (Patricia Wettig, Roger Moore, and a delicious turn by Quentin Tarantino), Alias is not to be missed, and this DVD set should be a joy for fans (even if the special features are a tad too sparse).",5,A great first season,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1373,"['Alias', 'simply', 'put', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'currently', 'TV', 'Few', 'shows', 'especially', 'action', 'series', 'are', 'able', 'move', 'fast', 'pace', 'yet', 'retain', 'truly', 'human', 'element', 'mark', 'good', 'show', 'ability', 'keep', 'viewer', 'begging', 'more', 'Alias', 'master', 'Act', 'and/or', 'episode', 'ending', 'capable', 'making', 'groan', 'simply', 'have', 'wait', 'conclusion.Jennifer', 'Garner', 'superb', 'cast', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'double', 'agent', 'CIA', 'who', 'recently', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'SD6', 'thought', 'was', 'secret', 'unit', 'CIA', 'really', 'part', 'shadowy', 'organization', 'known', 'Alliance', 'first', 'season', 'keep', 'affiliation', 'CIA', 'secret', 'friends', 'coworkers', 'SD6', 'finding', 'out', 'details', 'mother', 'death', 'father', 'role', 'CIA', '*and*', 'SD6.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'documentaries', 'gag', 'reel', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'handful', 'commentaries', 'best', 'being', 'cast', 'commentary', 'season', 'finale', 'Aided', 'good', 'writing', 'direction', 'few', 'well-placed', 'instances', 'quot', 'stunt', 'quot', 'casting', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'delicious', 'turn', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Alias', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'DVD', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'joy', 'fans', 'even', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'tad', 'too', 'sparse']",Alias - The Complete First Season

But when she's in the middle of a mission Sydney's got cool that James Bond can't match (OK, maybe the Timothy Dalton Bond could keep up).The ABC network has helped the series considerably with liberal deviation from the accepted hour show format.  This began with an uninterrupted showing of the pilot when the series debuted: 66 minutes without commercial or other interruption, a nearly unheard-of occurrence in American TV.  The following 21 episodes fit the standard 45 minutes of content for an &quot;hour&quot; show, but many ran for 15 or more minutes before the credits and first commercial break (in sharp contrast to the 2-3 minute convention before first ad break).The star and special effects crew of &quot;Alias&quot; are constantly pushing the envelope.  Jennifer Garner had minimal action show work under her belt when she started on the series.  Garner could run and dance, but was keen to learn more.  It soon became apparent to the writers and stunt crew that she was adept at memorizing: not just scripts, but also stunt choreography and foreign language phonetics.  The foreign languages in &quot;Alias&quot; are much more compelling than the usual cheat of English with some phony foreign accent.  Garner has since studied kickboxing and wire stunts, and actually looks forward to jumping off 100' buildings as a regular part of her job.&quot;Alias&quot; is in many ways a very flawed show.  The flaws do not keep it from being remarkably entertaining.  There's lots of impossible spy gadgetry, but the Bond movies have made us come to expect that.  No real spy agency would keep on an agent as prone to emotional collapse as Sydney Bristow, yet both SD-6 and the CIA consider her a valuable asset.  The whole prophetic 15th century Milo Rambaldi technology schtick is WAY out there.  And many of the effects over-reach.  One particularly egregious example is the oft-shown exploding car sequence.  The hood pops off and the car pitches up while fire lights it from below/behind.  Since you can see through the engine compartment it's glaringly apparent that this stunt car did not, in fact, actually have an engine in it as it rolled down the road.&quot;Alias&quot; show honchos have hedged their bets by going with known quantities where possible.  Series creator J.J. Abrams worked with star Garner on &quot;Felicity&quot;, and has known Greg Grunberg (a &quot;Felicity&quot; regular) since childhood.  Kevin Weisman played a recurring role on &quot;Felicity&quot;.  (Amanda Foreman, another &quot;Felicity&quot; regular, shows up in seasons two and three.)  Executive producer Ken Olin appears in a small recurring role, and his wife and &quot;thirtysomething&quot; costar Patricia Wettig also plays a recurring character on &quot;Alias&quot;.In the first season notable guest stars include Gina Torres, Quentin Tarantino, Angus Scrimm, Amy Irving, Lindsay Crouse, Terry O'Quinn, and Peter Berg.&quot;Alias&quot; is written as a continuous story arc and few episodes end without leaving the viewer eager to see what comes next.  The first season has plot threads involving Sydney's graduate school studies, her secret agent work for SD-6, her double agent work for the CIA, clueless best friends Will and Francie, the thaw in her relationship with her distant father, the mysterious Alliance, the prophetic works of Milo Rambaldi, and the growing question of what happened to her mother.As Sydney's view of her mother changes, so does the casting.  The character is played in the first season by Arabella Holzbog (in old photos), Natasha Pavlovich (in grainy surveillance footage), and April Webster in a quick backlit scene.  The character gains major importance in the second season when played by Lena Olin.It's not surprising that the show's producers and writers spend considerable time worrying about ways to bring viewers up to speed if they've missed or forgotten plot points.  There's a lot going on in &quot;Alias&quot;, and you don't want to blink sometimes for fear of being thrown off the roller-coaster.The DVD first season collection of &quot;Alias&quot; is unremarkable for its packaging and extra content.  This is mostly a good thing.  The effort went into excellent video and audio transfer, and the menus are less annoying than most.  Extra content is largely what they had lying around in the editing room: a few deleted scenes, and the ABC promo spots for a few episodes.  Audio commentary was added in three of the 22 episodes, including the first and last.",5,Best show now on American TV,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,4846,"['quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'great', 'show',

599228,A1KALWSKK12C18,B00005JLF1,"Iron Giant ""Iron Giant""","[4, 8]","Firstly, I have never seen this show before.  I saw in on Amazon for under $20 and I need a show.  I need a show with enough action to keep my attention on the tredmill every night, and preferably enough of a female element to interest my wife, so we have a show to watch together.  Alias meets both criteria, but only just barely.All my reviews are spoiler free, so I won't ruin the plot by giving it away, but seriously, 1/2 of all the episodes involve secret agent Sydney Bristow dressing up in a slinky outfit with a sexy hairdo to infiltrate a swanky party always being thrown in the same building as a secret base for her to break into and steal some item or artifact.  Apparently bad guys are quite fond of swanky parties and also can't get away from the ""office"" long enough to really enjoy them, so why not throw a party at the secret bad guy base?  Perfect!  Well maybe not.  Sure, I can appreciate Jennifer Garners mid driff and long sexy legs as much as the next guy, but after a while it feels like I'm watching a game of ""dress up"" when every other episode involves her dolling up in a new sexy dress.Mixed in with the action are ""daddy issues"", ""mommy issues"", friend issues, romance, long discussions worthy of daytime drama and a good dose of crying and hand wringing over Sydneys life foibles.  Fortunatly, my wife enjoys those parts too, so it gives us something to enjoy together, Alias has become ""our show"".There is too much violence and torture for my tastes.  Some things the bad guys (and some of the ""good guys"") do is just too graphic for the both of us.We bought the whole series and will watch it all eventually, but the main plot line is starting to feel too much like ""Lost"", which is a show I despise.  ""Lost"" is a snipe hunt.  After watching ""Lost"" for years, it has become clear that there is no underlying plot, its just a bunch of crap the writer thinks up over coffee that day.  If you remember Lost, there was a point where the story starting going off from reality (People stranded on an island trying to survive) to fantasy (smoke monsters, dead people flash backs, mystical powers, etc).  The first half of Alias season one is quasi reality (a female secret agent) and 1/2 way through gets mystical (500 year old prophesies, machines created by an ancient mystic prophet named Rambaldi who keeps coming up for reasons that are, by the end of Season 1, not at all explained) and part of it starts to feel silly.Overall the writing is passable.  There are a couple good scenes and a couple good plot twists.  In fact there are many plot twists, but most of them are blindingly obvious.  A lot of the time I can't tell if the writers are being serious or tounge-in-cheek as well.  One time they need to disarm some C4 plastic explosives.  It is ""hidden"" in a maintenance closet in big boxes with ""C4"" written all over it.  One character says, ""well I can tell its C4, because it has ""C4"" written all over it.""  Also, working in Network Admin (as I do) is a liability for enjoying some of the show, because I know that things don't work the way the writers think they do.  Wireless Modems don't steal data off hard disks just by putting them 4 inches away from a mainframe, for example...  Unfortunatly, there is quite a bit of this sillyness, but thats a common problem.In the end, each episode got me interested enough to watch the next, so its certainly worth the under $20 price, but I have no doubt that the whole underlying ""Rambaldi"" plot will not pan out to my satisfaction...",3,"Take a good look at the cover, because thats what the show is mostly about",1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,3521,"['Firstly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'saw', 'Amazon', '20', 'need', 'show', 'need', 'show', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'attention', 'tredmill', 'night', 'preferably', 'enough', 'female', 'element', 'interest', 'wife', 'have', 'show', 'watch', 'together', 'Alias', 'criteria', 'only', 'just', 'barely.All', 'reviews', 'are', 'spoiler', 'free', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'plot', 'giving', 'away', 'seriously', '1/2', 'episodes', 'involve', 'secret', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'dressing', 'up', 'slinky', 'outfit', 'sexy', 'hairdo', 'infiltrate', 'swanky', 'party', 'always', 'being', 'thrown', 'same', 'building', 'secret', 'base', 'break', 'steal', 'item', 'artifact', 'Apparently', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'quite', 'fond', 'swanky', 'parties', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'office', 'long', 'enough', 'really', 'enjoy', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'throw', 'party', 'secret', 'bad', 'guy', 'base', 'Perfect', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'Sure', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Jennifer', 'Garners', 'driff', 'long', 'sexy', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'while', ""'m"", 'watching', 'game', 'dress', 'up', 'when', 'other', 'episode', 'dolling', 'up', 'new', 'sexy', 'dress.Mixed', 'action', 'are', 'daddy', 'issues', 'mommy', 'issues', 'friend', 'issues', 'romance', 'long', 'discussions', 'worthy', 'daytime', 'drama', 'good', 'dose', 'crying', 'hand', 'wringing', 'Sydneys', 'life', 'foibles', 'Fortunatly', 'wife', 'parts', 'too', 'something', 'enjoy', 'together', 'Alias', 'become', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'torture', 'tastes', 'things', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'just', 'too', 'graphic', 'us.We', 'bought', 'whole', 'series', 'will', 'watch', 'eventually', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'starting', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'Lost', 'show', 'despise', 'Lost', 'snipe', 'hunt', 'watching', 'Lost', 'years', 'become', 'clear', 'underlying', 'plot', 'just', 'bunch', 'crap', 'writer', 'up', 'coffee', 'day', 'remember', 'Lost', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'story', 'starting', 'going', 'reality', 'People', 'stranded', 'island', 'trying', 'survive', 'fantasy', 'smoke', 'monsters', 'dead', 'people', 'flash', 'backs', 'mystical', 'powers', 'etc', 'first', 'half', 'Alias', 'season', 'one', 'quasi', 'reality', 'female', 'secret', 'agent', '1/2', 'way', 'mystical', '500', 'year', 'old', 'prophesies', 'machines', 'created', 'ancient', 'mystic', 'prophet', 'named', 'Rambaldi', 'who', 'coming', 'up', 'reasons', 'are', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'explained', 'part', 'feel', 'writing', 'passable', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'scenes', 'couple', 'good', 'plot', 'twists', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'most', 'are', 'blindingly', 'obvious', 'lot', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'writers', 'are', 'being', 'serious', 'tounge-in-cheek', 'well', 'One', 'time', 'need', 'disarm', 'C4', 'plastic', 'explosives', 'hidden', 'maintenance', 'closet', 'big', 'boxes', 'C4', 'written', 'One', 'character', 'well', 'can', 'tell', 'C4', 'C4', 'written', 'Also', 'working', 'Network', 'Admin', 'do', 'liability', 'enjoying', 'show', 'know', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'writers', 'think', 'do', 'Wireless', 'Modems', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'data', 'off', 'hard', 'disks', 'just', 'putting', '4', 'inches', 'away', 'mainframe', 'example', 'Unfortunatly', 'quite', 'bit', 'sillyness', 'common', 'problem.In', 'end', 'episode', 'got', 'interested', 'enough', 'watch', 'next', 'certainly', '20', 'price', 'have', 'doubt', 'whole', 'underlying', 'Rambaldi', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'pan', 'satisfaction']",Alias - The Complete First Season

599231,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B00005JLF1,James Duckett,"[3, 5]","I'm becomming a fan of the type of show that is a long-running storyline.  Shows like Taken, The 4400, Lost, and my new favorite, 24.  It is hard to pick up these types of shows during their runs (like you could with Friends or Seinfield) but, thank goodness for DVD show releases, I could start this series from the beginning.  So, if you like those shows then you'll probably like this one.  It is a wattered-down version of 24 though it is slowly becomming more like Lost with a certain sci-fi twist they've thrown in there.Jennifer Garner plays Sydney Bristow, a field unit in SD-6, an offshoot of the CIA.  She is told to tell nobody about SD-6 but when she tells her fiance, he is killed and she learns many truths.Such as the fact that SD-6 is not part of the CIA, but part of ""The Alliance"", the agency she thought she was trying to destroy.  Also, that her Father, who she thought sold airplane parts, is also part of SD-6 and knows that it doesn't operate out of Langley.So Sydney goes to the CIA and becomes a double agent.  Many other plot twists come throughout the episodes as everybody in her life seems to be affected by her decisions.  I just finished the first season and there seems to be a lot of questions that need to be answered.  I'll most definately be headed out to pick up the second season to see where things are taken.The amazing thing about Sydney is that she must lead three lives, which often do not coincide with each other.  First is the life of working for SD-6, who she can't tell anybody (not even family) about.  Then there is her work with the CIA which, again, family and friends can't know about and especially her friends at SD-6.  She is also a college student and everybody from that life (roommates and friends) assumes she works at a bank.  Keeping these three things in order can get pretty entertaining at times.But I'm not completely sold on this yet.  I'm just running out of options to follow, unfortunately.  This starts off with the double-agent story which I thought was interesting.  But mid-way through the plot thickens as they pick up the trail of a 15th century inventory/architect that turns out to be a prophet prophesying events to happen during this time (think of him as a cross between DaVinci and Nostredomas).  And Sydney appears to be a great deal of that prophecy.  So the storyline has turned a bit Fantasy/Sci-Fi-ish.  While I generally like those types of stories, it isn't exactly what I was looking for in this story line.  So I'll give it another season and see if I want to continue on to the end from there (watching 5 seasons is a LOT of time commitment).But I'd say that if you like what you've heard so far then go out and pick this up.

599233,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JLF1,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[0, 0]","Even at a young age, JJ Abrams had brilliant sensibilities showing his skill as a future filmmaker. Before the release of John Carpenter's Escape from New York Abrams father, Gerald W Abrams (nominated for the miniseries Nuremberg and Family of Spies), took him to see a rough cut of the film as young JJ was a Carpenter fan. After the film Gerald suggested cutting out the original opening sequence of the flick, while a 15-year-old JJ suggested that Carpenter make it clearer that the character of Maggie dies at the end. (Sorry if I spoiled the end, I haven't personally seen the flick at the time of this writing, so I spoiled it for myself by knowing this bit of trivia.) Carpenter followed both suggestions to the letter.Since then Abrams has made major waves in the entertainment industry with movies such as Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek as well as TV series such as Lost and Fringe. While he may have also created Felicity, it could be said that Alias was the jumping off point for a lot of the advancement he has made in his career. Interesting for a show that started off as an in-joke from Felicity. ABC was so impressed with Alias that they requested Abrams to help develop a serialized show that would mirror Survivor and Cast Away, which would become zeitgeist known as Lost. A big name star was also impressed with the show and requested him to take over directorial duties for a major franchise. That star was Tom Cruise, and the film he went on to direct was Mission Impossible 3 which also became the biggest budget feature film ever directed by a first time filmmaker.Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) works for SD-6, a black ops organization she was fooled into believing was a part of the CIA. But when her fianc&eacute; Danny (Edward Atterton) is murdered because she told him the truth about her secret life, she learns from an unlikely source that SD-6 is not a member of the CIA: her somewhat estranged father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber). Driven by her anger toward the organization over the death of Danny and the fact that she's been lied to for years, she goes to the CIA to work as double agent to take down SD-6 and its nefarious boss Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) with the help of her CIA handler Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan). Meanwhile, Sydney's friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) who works as a reporter suspects more behind the death of Danny and seeks to find out the truth, but may put himself and his friends in harm's way by doing so.I have to be honest and say that I'm not a Jennifer Garner fan. I don't find her attractive the way many others do, and in the select few films I've chosen to view that featured her didn't really demonstrate her ability as a very capable actress. For that reason it took me a while to finally decide to give this show a try. The end result surprised me. It turns out that Abrams knows how to effectively use her and she pulls off a very competent performance in dramatic action. It also helps that she's surrounded by immense talent with the brilliant Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, and Bradley Cooper to play off. Everyone does their part admirably, often showing a talent for portraying characters with hidden agendas with undercurrents that must stay just beneath the surface.Here JJ Abrams crafts a drama that hits many notes throughout one full season. It could have been easy for this spy series to get mired in gadgets and especially in the fantastical Sci-Fi mythology of the series. Abrams and his writers walk a fine line though, keeping the action ramped up and grounding the series in the characters and their relationships. Alias is really the story of relationships in the midst of hidden secrets. Sydney must hide her true career from her friends and her ties to the CIA from SD-6, Sloane must hide the truth of SD-6's affiliations (or lack thereof) with the CIA from his employees, and Will must hide his investigation of Danny's murder from Sydney. In a subplot we even find out that Sydney's friend's fianc&eacute; is hiding an affair, further demonstrating the season's views of reconciling relationships while having to remain covert about the truth.The premiere season of Alias is one of those rare premiere seasons that is perfection. I almost wish that I had the opportunity to catch this when it first aired, but at the same time I'm glad I don't have to wait till the next week to know what's going to happen next. Throughout season 1 of Alias there are many instances where episodes end on major cliffhangers, something that ABC became frustrated with during season 2 and ordered to be rectified halfway through the season. I highly recommend that you give this a try, it's highly enjoyable, filled with action, and character development and drama to keep you invested in the lives of these characters.4.5/5Be sure to check

She then is thrown into a chair and tied to it (i forget exactly w/ what, but that doesn't matter) and looks franticly at the door. It opens....and a professor walks out. oh, it was just a flash forward. Welcome to the exciting world of alias. Who is Sydney Bristow exactly? She's a college student recruited by a ""secret branch"" of the CIA called SD-6. She was sworn not to tell anyone but she told her fiance, resulting in his death. Then she learned that SD-6 was not part of the CIA but in fact, part of a terrorist cell group called The Alliance. She then goes to the real CIA and becomes a double agent, where she learns that her father is also a double agent within SD-6. She then resumes working with Sd-6. And that was only the first episode! (in a very brief sypnosis)  So for the next and final 21 eps. of season 1 she continues working w/ the CIA and her handler, Michael Vaughn, while lying to SD-6 and her friends, Will Tippin and Francie Calfo. Over the season Will begins to investigate Danny's death, which results in an interesting storyline.  Arvin Sloane, sydney's boss at SD-6 claims to love sydney as a daughter which makes her sick, but she is friends w/ his wife Emily, who knows something that will end in a cliffhanger (duh duh duh-season finale)  Another important plotline throughout Alias is Milo Rambaldi, a 15th century ""prophet"" who sydney is sent to collect artifacts of his left around the world, in hidden places. Sydney is sent on a mission to find a rambaldi artifact with (in secret) vaughn, which also results in a (duh duh duh) finale cliffhanger!

Martin ""ffej26""","[5, 6]","I never tuned into the show on tv even thought it's going into it's 4th season this year, but based on critical response I checked out season 1, and I got hooked instanstly, and wish I had watched it years ago when it first debuted. Holding the show together is the beautiful and talented Jennifer Garner. I've seen her in a few things recently (13 Going on 30, Daredevil) and I enjoyed her, but I finally realized she is one of the best actresses in television today. She is one of the rare actresses who can do it all. Comedy, Action, Drama and make it seem so effortless. She is so charming and likable. The storylines are compelling and intense and I couldn't wait to see what happened next after each episode. I was hooked instantly after watching the exciting first episode. The are so many twists and surprises, and a lot of the CIA mumbo jumbo gets confusing, but in the end it's well worth it. Every cast member is brilliant in his/her role. Besides Garner, Victor Garber is perfectly intense as Sydneys father. You never know if he's good and bad because Garber plays him so well. Bradley Coooper and Michael Vartan are also brilliant. If you have never seen Alias like me a few weeks ago, then you must check this show out.

599244,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00005JLF1,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[4, 12]","If you've ever watched a James Bond movie and said to yourself: ""This flick is good an all, but it would REALLY be better if Bond was a girl, if he wore a bunch of wigs, if instead of killing his enemies he'd just beat them up so they could come back after him, and ESPECIALLY if he cried all the time,"" then Alias is the program for you!Watching Alias just makes me realize how much I love the series ""24,"" because all the things Alias does wrong, 24 does right.  Both series debuted at the same time, with 24 the critical and ratings champ and Alias dubbed ""24 for teenagers.""  I still think that's funny, mostly because it's sort of true.  I've found that generally one is a fan of one series more than the other; rarely will you find someone who claims to like both shows equally.  It really comes down to a matter of taste in what you look for in your action programming.Alias is sort of like a better-budgeted, WB-type, teenager-oriented show, i.e. ""Smallville"" and ""Buffy.""  Because, like those shows, Alias is a series afraid to take risks, one which instead chooses to string viewers along with empty threats and promises, only very occasionally delivering to its full potential.  This is why I consider 24 a better program; as any 24 fan well knows, that program is never afraid to take a risk.  You see, much like a comic book, death is rarely final in Alias, with characters previously considered dead returning to raise more mischief.  Villains are allowed to escape freely while our hero weeps uncontrollably.  Romantic tension arises and continues unchecked between what are supposed to be hard-bitten, world-weary spies.  Agents are able to go out on perilous missions and survive with nothing more than a wig and a stunt-doubled high-kick.  Yep, it's ""24 for teenagers,"" all right.Season 1 is often considered the best yet of Alias, and I'll agree, though I found the first half of Season 3 to be more entertaining (probably because it was in some ways similar to the grimmer and tougher 24).  Melodrama is thick this first time out, but nowhere near the levels it would later reach.  The pace is also quicker in most episodes, which basically are constructed like a video game (basic outline for every episode: our hero Sydney receives her mission, gets a countermission from the CIA, goes out, gets in a fight, comes home, cries).  There's also more of a sense of fun this first season, something that was lost as the series progressed.Most know the plot by now, but just for posterity: Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a super-agent for secret agency SD-6, which is controlled by the steely Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin, always a highlight).  After revealing her true profession to her fianc&eacute;e, Syd is horrified to discover that Sloane has him killed, as SD-6 protocol demands the death of any non-agent who discovers the agency's existence.  Soon Syd also discovers that SD-6 in fact has nothing to do with the US Government; instead, it's another arm of the evil Alliance organization, Bond's SPECTRE nemeses in everything but name.  She's shocked yet again to learn that her father (scene-stealing Victor Garber as Jack Bristow, probably the only character in this series who could survive in the world of 24) is also a member of SD-6, as well as a counter-agent who truly works for the CIA.  Syd continues the family tradition of counter-spying and also begins to covertly work for the CIA, where she provides intel to and receives counter-missions from the hawk-nosed and pinch-faced Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan, fresh from ""Never Been Kissed""), who soon develops non-espionage-related feelings toward her, and vice versa.That's mostly the gist of Season 1: Syd receiving missions from SD-6 and the CIA, secretly transmitting data back to Vaughn, and maintaining her cover.  Soon however a secondary plot emerges, one that is at first engaging, but in later seasons becomes frustrating: the Rimbaldi riddle.  Sloane is enamored with this Renaissance-era inventor who created several devices which were centuries ahead of their time, and sends Syd on multiple missions to locate and retrieve many of these contraptions.  So even if spy stuff isn't your bag, there are some Indiana Jones-type hijinks as well.  Some ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" garbage, too, as Sydney unfortunately (for the intelligent viewer) discovers that she might be connected to a ""prophecy"" Rimbaldi devised.  Don't worry though, as this ridiculous element isn't really brought to the fore until the lame-brained second half of Season 3.Unlike 24, Alias follows more of a compact structure, with only a few multiple-part episodes.  Usually plots are wrapped up in one episode, with minor subplots carrying over.  This means that the series has a frustrating knack for recapping what's been going on every few episodes, which is especially irritating when viewing on DVD.  There are also several episodes which serve as nothing more than an obvious gambit to gain new viewers, similar to those ""flashback episodes"" sitcoms like ""Family Ties"" would throw at you every few seasons.  But whereas those shows would resort to this only after having been on the air for a few years, Alias does it a mere handful of episodes in.Much is made of the pilot episode, and it probably is one of the very best episodes in the show's history.  Paying tribute to ""Run Lola Run"" and the more recent Bond flicks, this extra-long episode looks and feels like a compact, well-done film.  The two-parter with Quentin Tarantino as rogue SD-6 agent McKenna Cole, later in the season, is also enjoyable.  A ""Die Hard"" tribute (the terrorists pull up to SD-6 headquarters in a van bearing the name ""McTiernan Air Conditioning,"" referencing that film's director), this story is harmed only by the fact that Syd has nothing to do in it; she spends the majority of the first part just trying to gain access to an elevator shaft.  Better yet is another two-parter, toward the end of the season, in which Syd encounters a former boyfriend, who's also an SD-6 agent.  However this story is also ruined, as it's totally obvious who the guy really is.Anyway, Alias is a fun show with a strong cast, good production values, and at least for this season, solid writing.  It does drive me crazy how Sydney is able to get along on her missions by just punching out her enemies ""Buffy""-style, but if ""Charlie's Angels"" is your thing, you won't mind.  It's just that the occasional melodrama, goofy Rimbaldi junk, and incessant crying drags the show down.",4,The Crying Spy and her tear-filled adventures,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,6520,"[""'ve"",

599245,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLF1,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","""Alias"" is one of those television programs that I had no interest in watching when it first aired, but as there has been good buzz about the show I was able to give it a chance on DVD.  It's a good thing that I did because right from the first episode I was sucked into the story and each episode left me wanting to know the explanation for what just happened and what was going to happen next.Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is an agent for SD-6.  When she was recruited to SD-6 she was led to believe that it was a covert branch of the CIA.  Except for those at the highest levels of SD-6, all the agents believe that they are working for the CIA.  They are all wrong.  When Sydney told her fianc&eacute; that she worked as a spy for SD-6, they had him killed.  It was only then that she learned that SD-6 was the very enemy she thought she was fighting against.  She went directly to the CIA and now she works as a double agent to help bring down SD-6.  If this sounds a bit complicated, just remember that we learn all of this in the first episode of the series.  It gets even more complicated from there.Sydney also learns that her father (Victor Garber), whom she has never been close to, is not only a member of SD-6 but also a double agent with the CIA.  Sydney is still given missions from Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), but her CIA Handler Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) gives her the CIA's counter-mission for her true objective.  So, Sydney is working both sides on her missions, but is also trying to keep the fact that she is working against SD-6 from her partner Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), who believes that SD-6 is part of the CIA and is one of the good guys.  These missions gradually build the greater story arc of the season/series with something called the Rimbaldi artifact.  These artifacts are amazingly advanced and prescient for something designed and created over 500 years ago.  The major world powers (both official like CIA and the underworld like SD-6, K-Directorate) are looking for these artifacts because of the incredible potential to shift the balance of power one way or another.While this is happening, Sydney's friend, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper), a newspaper reporter, is investigating the death of Sydney's fianc&eacute;.  Since just learning about SD-6 was enough to get the fianc&eacute; killed we know that Will is treading into dangerous waters.  This storyline often takes a back seat, but it is interesting to see what he will be able to uncover and how this may affect his relationship with Sydney.At many times this can be a confusing show because you are not quite sure how everything connects to the larger picture, but it is easy to stay interested in the show for that very reason: you want to know how it all comes out in the end.  To make matters worse, the ending of nearly episode is such a cliffhanger that even when I think I have watched my last episode of the day I just have to watch one more to find out how the cliffhanger is resolved.  It is the mark of good television that keeps me coming back for more.  I would put this show with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as a show that is really good but is not quite as serious as something like ""The Sopranos"" or ""The West Wing"".  It deals with serious subjects and has action and adventure, but it doesn't fit neatly into a genre.  All in all, I think this is an excellent show and I look forward to watching season two.",5,"an excellent, but complicated program",1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3428,"['Alias', 'one', 'television', 'programs', 'had', 'interest', 'watching', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'been', 'good', 'buzz', 'show', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'chance', 'DVD', 'good', 'thing', 'did', 'because', 'right', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'sucked', 'story', 'episode', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'explanation', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next.Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'agent', 'SD-6', 'When', 'was', 'recruited', 'SD-6', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'covert', 'branch', 'CIA', 'highest', 'levels', 'SD-6', 'agents', 'believe', 'are', 'working', 'CIA', 'are', 'wrong', 'When', 'Sydney', 'told', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'worked', 'spy', 'SD-6', 'had', 'killed', 'was', 'only', 'then', 'learned', 'SD-6', 'was', 'very', 'enemy', 'thought', 'was', 'fighting', 'went', 'directly', 'CIA', 'now', 'double', 'agent', 'help', 'bring', 'down', 'SD-6', 'bit', 'complicated', 'just', 'remember', 'learn', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'there.Sydney', 'also', 'father', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'whom', 'never', 'been', 'close', 'not', 'only', 'member', 'SD-6', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'CIA', 'Sydney', 'still', 'given', 'missions', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'CIA', 'Handler', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'CIA', 'counter-mission', 'true', 'objective', 'So', 'Sydney', 'working', 'sides', 'missions', 'also', 'trying', 'keep', 'fact', 'working', 'SD-6', 'partner', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'who', 'SD-6', 'part', 'CIA', 'one', 'good', 'guys', 'missions', 'gradually', 'build', 'greater', 'story', 'arc', 'season/series', 'something', 'called', 'Rimbaldi', 'artifact', 'artifacts', 'are', 'amazingly', 'advanced', 'prescient', 'something', 'designed', 'created', '500', 'years', 'ago', 'major', 'world', 'powers', 'official', 'CIA', 'underworld', 'SD-6', 'K-Directorate', 'are', 'looking', 'artifacts', 'incredible', 'potential', 'shift', 'balance', 'power', 'one', 'way', 'another.While', 'happening', 'Sydney', 'friend', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'investigating', 'death', 'Sydney', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'just', 'learning', 'SD-6', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'killed', 'know', 'Will', 'treading', 'dangerous', 'waters', 'storyline', 'often', 'back', 'seat', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'uncover', 'how', 'may', 'affect', 'relationship', 'Sydney.At', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'everything', 'larger', 'picture', 'easy', 'stay', 'interested', 'show', 'very', 'reason', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'end', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'ending', 'nearly', 'episode', 'such', 'cliffhanger', 'even', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'episode', 'day', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'cliffhanger', 'resolved', 'mark', 'good', 'television', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'would', 'put', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'show', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'serious', 'something', 'Sopranos', 'West', 'Wing', 'serious', 'subjects', 'action', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'fit', 'neatly', 'genre', 'think', 'excellent', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'season', 'two']",Alias - The Complete First Season

The Fox network had their real-time powerhouse ""24"", and ABC premiered the female driven spy drama ""Alias"".  Reviews for both shows were spectacular, ""24"" took off with audiences immediately, ""Alias"" built up more of a cult following that continued to grow each week.  Even though ""Alias"" wasn't pulling down the numbers that ""24"" was in the ratings, it was strong enough for ABC to know that they had a hit on their hands.""Alias"" focuses on a young, sexy female spy named Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) who was essentially drafted into the spy world during college.  Sydney believes she is working for a special black-ops branch of the CIA, known as SD-6.  What Sydney doesn't know is that her and everyone she works with really are working for the very people they thought they were fighting, and that the head of SD-6, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is a former member of the CIA who became a traitor to his country and now focuses on assembling a device that was designed by an inventor named Milo Rambaldi several centuries prior to now.  Sydney soon becomes a double-agent working for the CIA and attempting to bring down SD-6 with the help of her double-agent father, Jack (Victor Garber) and CIA agent Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan).""Alias"" is one of those shows that missing one week can sometimes lead to total confusion when watching the next week's episode, which is what makes Tivo or these DVD season box sets so awesome.  Full of twists and turns that will keep your head spinning, ""Alias"" is an entertaining thrill ride that never lets up from the opening sequence of the first episode until the cliffhanger for the season finale.  Series creator J.J. Abrams has assembled a superb team of writers and directors to brilliantly craft this series into the spy thriller masterpiece that it is today.

599255,A1403J18C3KRAC,B00005JLF1,Justin F.,"[2, 2]","Put simply: no one had ever seen a show like Alias when it began airing in 2001. The full-act teasers, the serial nature of the show despite being on network television, the constant use of one episode's final scene as a sort of teaser for the next that led to endless cliff-hangers, and nearly all the unique elements of story and production that have come to be synonymous with Abrams (or particularly the more commercially successful Lost that used so many of the exact format ideas) were not only pioneered but mastered by season 1 of Alias. It's a real tribute to the show as a whole for me that this is only my personal third favorite season of the show yet for me it was an easy 5-star rating and a season of television I would urge anyone to watch without hesitation. I consider this a truly GREAT season of TV, amazingly I just liked the next two of the show even more. However, I warn you to be sure you have plenty of time on your hands for the next few days before you watch the pilot because you will not want to quit running through the episodes once you get started.Season 1 wastes no time in getting started with the major story lines of the show yet somehow you quickly identify with the supporting characters and find yourself attached to their development as well. Will's investigations into SD6, the murder of Danny, etc. comprise some of the great moments of the season I believe. The balance between action and mythology on one hand and daily life, supporting character, etc. on the other was perhaps better achieved in this season- season 2 did this nicely as well though- than any other I've seen on television and if you're looking to find a fun, intense show that still lets you identify with the people you're watching then I think the first two seasons of Alias will be among the best you could ever hope to find.",5,A Unique Achievement for its Time,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1841,"['Put', 'simply', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'show', 'Alias', 'when', 'began', 'airing', '2001', 'full-act', 'teasers', 'serial', 'nature', 'show', 'being', 'network', 'television', 'constant', 'use', 'one', 'episode', 'final', 'scene', 'sort', 'teaser', 'next', 'led', 'endless', 'cliff-hangers', 'nearly', 'unique', 'elements', 'story', 'production', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'synonymous', 'Abrams', 'particularly', 'more', 'commercially', 'successful', 'Lost', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'exact', 'format', 'ideas', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'pioneered', 'mastered', 'season', '1', 'Alias', 'real', 'tribute', 'show', 'whole', 'only', 'personal', 'third', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'yet', 'was', 'easy', '5-star', 'rating', 'season', 'television', 'would', 'urge', 'anyone', 'watch', 'hesitation', 'consider', 'truly', 'GREAT', 'season', 'TV', 'amazingly', 'just', 'liked', 'next', 'two', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'However', 'warn', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'plenty', 'time', 'hands', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'watch', 'pilot', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'quit', 'running', 'episodes', 'once', 'get', 'started.Season', '1', 'time', 'getting', 'started', 'major', 'story', 'lines', 'show', 'yet', 'somehow', 'quickly', 'identify', 'supporting', 'characters', 'find', 'attached', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'Will', 'investigations', 'SD6', 'murder', 'Danny', 'etc', 'comprise', 'great', 'moments', 'season', 'believe', 'balance', 'action', 'mythology', 'one', 'hand', 'daily', 'life', 'supporting', 'character', 'etc', 'other', 'was', 'perhaps', 'better', 'achieved', 'season-', 'season', '2', 'did', 'nicely', 'well', 'though-', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', ""'re"", 'looking', 'find', 'fun', 'intense', 'show', 'still', 'identify', 'people', ""'re"", 'watching', 'then', 'think', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Alias', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'find']",Alias - The Complete First Season

Rambaldi is surrounded in mystery. Sydney and Dixon go on many missions to discover more about Rambaldi. But, Rambaldi is not the only thing in this season. SD-6 sells weapons to terroist groups.

599271,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLF1,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","Winston Churchill once said the Soviet Union was &quot;a mystery wrapped in an enigma,&quot; which is a good description of &quot;Alias: The Complete First Season.&quot;  The initial premise is that Agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is working for SD-6 (Section Disparue 6, as in the one that disappeared), which she believes to be part of the CIA.  Instead it turns out that she is working for the very people she thinks she has been fighting against.  After you get past the point in the first season when Sydney understands what is going on, the opening narration each week explains the situation and the cast of characters.  That is necessary because anyone who skipped an episode in the first season was going to be missing one or more pieces of the puzzle and be even more in the dark than they would otherwise.  Fortunately, when you have the entire first season on DVD that is not a problem.  You can even go back and try to piece together what is happening and try to connect the dots.For those television viewers who have been looking for something more challenging that regular dramatic fare, &quot;Alias&quot; could well constitute an overdose.  The only thing really comparable on television is &quot;24,&quot; but &quot;Alias&quot; has more gadgets, better action sequences, and a whole lot better costumes (both quantitatively and qualitatively).  Beyond Churchill the other relevant quote would be with regards to tangled webs of deception, because this show gets really complicated.  Did Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) work for the KGB as an assassin?  Is Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) Sydney's real father?  Is jouaanlist Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) going to discover the truth about Syndey's &quot;real&quot; job?  Is Sydney going to tell Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly) that they are not working for CIA before he figures out that she is a double-agent?  When is Sydney's handler CIA Agent Michael C. Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally going to make a move on her?  Will Sydney ever finish her degree?  And what is up with Sydney's mom?  Yes, things get a bit over the top with the whole Rambaldi bit and who knows if we will ever figure out the significant of the number 47 for the Pope's architect, but just hang on and enjoy the ride.Not being able to follow all the action is not a problem because it becomes clear early on that we are not supposed to be able to do so, and after a while you become satisifed with being only a half-step behind Sydney.  I have only touched upon a few of the plotlines running rampant during season one, and that is without taking into account all the missions to exotic places around the world as Sydney gets in deeper and deeper.  My only really criticism is that Jennifer Garner cries a lot for a super spy, which seems especially strange since Daddy Dearest is wound so tight and mom has been out of the picture, so to speak, for a long time.  However, Garber's minimalist style (Look!  His right nostril flared!  Jack is really ticked off now!) is one of the true joys of the show which has an impressive cast where the likes of Amy Irving and Patricia Wettig have small but pivotal roles.These six DVDs contain all 22 episodes from the first season, with all of the episodes being letterboxed and the transfers enhanced for 16 x 9 television sets.  Audio commentary is provided for four episodes: &quot;Truth be Told&quot; (The Pilot) by J.J. Abrams &amp; Jennifer Garner, &quot;So It Begins&quot; by Michael Bonvillain, Sarah Caplan &amp; Ken Olin, &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; by John Eisendrath, Alex Kurtzman-Counter &amp; Roberto Orci, and &quot;Almost Thirty Years&quot; by Jennifer Garner, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, Bradley Cooper, Carl Lumbly, Ron Rifkin, Merrin Dungey, &amp; Kevin Weisman. All four commentary tracks are above average, but the pilot track is the most informative in terms of providing insight into the show's origins and the way the visual style evolved.  All the other bonus material appears on the last disc, where there is a featurette narrated by series creator J.J. Abrams, one on stunts, six deleted scenes, television spots, and a gag reel.  Season Two has just become available on DVD as well, so those who want to catch up to what is happening can now be more than half way there.",5,Sydney Bristow becomes a double agent in a dangerous game,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,4266,"['Winston', 'Churchill', 'once', 'said', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'quot', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'enigma', 'quot', 'good', 'description', 'quot', 'Alias', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season.', 'quot', 'initial', 'premise', 'Agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'working', 'SD-6', 'Section', 'Disparue', '6', 'one', 'disappeared', 'be', 'part', 'CIA', 'Instead', 'out', 'working', 'very', 'people', 'been', 'fighting', 'get', 'point', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'Sydney', 'what', 'going', 'opening', 'narration', 'week', 'situation', 'cast', 'characters', 'necessary', 'anyone', 'who', 'skipped', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'missing', 'one', 'more', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'dark', 'would', 'otherwise', 'Fortunately', 'when', 'have', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'not', 'problem', 'can', 'even', 'go', 'back', 'try', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happening', 'try', 'connect', 'dots.For', 'television', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'challenging', 'regular', 'dramatic', 'fare', 'quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'could', 'well', 'constitute', 'overdose', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'comparable', 'television', 'quot', '24', 'quot', 'quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'more', 'gadgets', 'better', 'action', 'sequences', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'costumes', 'quantitatively', 'qualitatively', 'Beyond', 'Churchill', 'other', 'relevant', 'quote', 'would', 'be', 'regards', 'tangled', 'webs', 'deception', 'show', 'really', 'complicated', 'Did', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'work', 'KGB', 'assassin', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Sydney', 'real', 'father', 'jouaanlist', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'going', 'discover', 'truth', 'Syndey', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'job', 'Sydney', 'going', 'tell', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'are', 'not', 'working', 'CIA', 'out', 'double-agent', 'When', 'Sydney', 'handler', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'finally', 'going', 'make', 'move', 'Will', 'Sydney', 'ever', 'finish', 'degree', 'what', 'up', 'Sydney', 'mom', 'Yes', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'top', 'whole', 'Rambaldi', 'bit', 'who', 'will', 'ever', 'figure', 'out', 'significant', 'number', '47', 'Pope', 'architect', 'just', 'hang', 'enjoy', 'ride.Not', 'being', 'able', 'follow', 'action', 'not', 'problem', 'clear', 'early', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'while', 'become', 'satisifed', 'being', 'only', 'half-step', 'Sydney', 'have', 'only', 'touched', 'few', 'plotlines', 'running', 'rampant', 'season', 'one', 'taking', 'account', 'missions', 'exotic', 'places', 'world', 'Sydney', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'only', 'really', 'criticism', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'lot', 'super', 'spy', 'especially', 'strange', 'Daddy', 'Dearest', 'wound', 'so', 'tight', 'mom', 'been', 'picture', 'so', 'speak', 'long', 'time', 'However', 'Garber', 'minimalist', 'style', 'Look', 'right', 'nostril', 'flared', 'Jack', 'really', 'ticked', 'off', 'now', 'one', 'true', 'joys', 'show', 'impressive', 'cast', 'where', 'likes', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'have', 'small', 'pivotal', 'roles.These', 'six', 'DVDs', 'contain', '22', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'being', 'letterboxed', 'transfers', 'enhanced', '16', 'x', '9', 'television', 'sets', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'four', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Truth', 'be', 'Told', 'quot', 'Pilot', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'amp', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'quot', 'Begins', 'quot', 'Michael', 'Bonvillain', 'Sarah', 'Caplan', 'amp', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'quot', 'Q', 'amp', 'A', 'quot', 'John', 'Eisendrath', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman-Counter', 'amp', 'Roberto', 'Orci', 'quot', 'Almost', 'Thirty', 'Years', 'quot', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Merrin', 'Dungey', 'amp', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'four', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'pilot', 'track', 'most', 'informative', 'terms', 'providing', 'insight', 'show', 'origins', 'way', 'visual', 'style', 'evolved', 'other', 'bonus', 'material', 'last', 'disc', 'where', 'featurette', 'narrated', 'series', 'creator', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'one', 'stunts', 'six', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'television', 'spots', 'gag', 'reel', 'Season', 'Two', 'just', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'want', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'happening', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'more', 'half', 'way', 'there']",Alias - The Complete First Season

So I deliberately abstained from watching the series while it was on, and then got the DVD set out afterwards. Not only does this make it easier to watch them properly, but it also means you can have marathon watching episodes. Instead of wasting time with commercials and waiting a week, you can zip through a whole batch of them at once.I love female lead characters, I love James Bond style action and I love quick-paced, intelligent plot. Alias provides a lot of that. I also love medieval / renaissance style mystery tie-ins and that of course is in here as well. Sydney is a college student and in short order both she and her father are double agents. They really work for the CIA, but they're infiltrating the evil SD-6. Sydney's fiance is slain because of her indiscretion. She has a romance building with her CIA handler. Who can she trust? Who's on her side?I also love the way they make it ""appear"" to be all over the world. I wish of course that they had a budget to actually go places - I would much rather see a scene in Honk Kong vs what LA thinks Hong Kong looks like. They can only do what they can do, of course. I like how she dresses up and down, blue hair and red hair, showing that all sorts of shapes and styles can look nice.So, on to the issues. First, I'll comment that they aren't huge issues. I avidly watched the whole series through and enjoyed it. Still, there were definitely issues that were jarring during the process.First, I realize Sydney is supposed to be a ""young adult"" and even though she's a genius mentally, the isn't fully emotionally mature. Still, some of the things she does for plot related reasons are completely inane. She's a trained spy but she *conveniently* forgets protocol and rationale when the plot needs it to happen. She's an incredibly skilled fighter who can shoot, kick box, kung fu and pick up any random weapon with incredible skill - but when the plot requires it, a cheezy security guard can take her out. Surely the plot could have a *reasonable* reason for these things to happen.I really enjoyed Sydney's African-American best friend and the ups and downs that go through that storyline. On the other hand, Sydney's male reporter friend drove me insane a lot of the time. I realize reporters need to be investigative. They need to be diligent and dogged. This guy's rapid-fire method of harassing people wouldn't have gotten him many stories! That being said, I do think he changed a lot, for the better, as the series progressed.Something that really struck me as odd is that Sydney often goes into missions for SD-6 - with SD-6 monitoring her every move - but she's actively, VERBALLY talking via a hidden mike to her CIA contact the entire time. Even if the signal was scrambled, SD-6 would detect it. But they wouldn't have to! All the SD-6 watchers would take one look at her face and know exactly what she was saying, just by reading her lips.I don't want to give away the storyline, of course. It's a soap opera of twists and turns, of characters disappearing and reappearing. It's a great watch-through and great to keep to replay and watch the subtle movements and clues. There are a ton of non-verbal signals being given here that you only pick up on the second or third watching.I do want to warn on the DVD that there is a super-cool commentary with the entire cast of the final episode - and it is really funny - but it gives a TON of spoilers!! Surely the actors could have done their commentary without mentioning things from season 2 or 3. If you are watching this for the first time, I really recommend NOT watching that commentary and waiting until you're done with season 3 to go back and watch it. Otherwise some things will be ruined for you.Well recommended.",5,Well Worth Watching and Owning,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3899,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', '24', 'series', '24', 'Alias', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'way', 'could', 'schedule', 'life', 'weekly', 'episodes', 'So', 'deliberately', 'abstained', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'then', 'got', 'DVD', 'set', 'out', 'afterwards', 'Not', 'only', 'make', 'easier', 'watch', 'properly', 'also', 'can', 'have', 'marathon', 'watching', 'episodes', 'Instead', 'wasting', 'time', 'commercials', 'waiting', 'week', 'can', 'zip', 'whole', 'batch', 'once.I', 'love', 'female', 'lead', 'characters', 'love', 'James', 'Bond', 'style', 'action', 'love', 'quick-paced', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'Alias', 'lot', 'also', 'love', 'medieval', '/', 'renaissance', 'style', 'mystery', 'tie-ins', 'course', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Sydney', 'college', 'student', 'short', 'order', 'father', 'are', 'double', 'agents', 'really', 'work', 'CIA', ""'re"", 'infiltrating', 'evil', 'SD-6', 'Sydney', 'fiance', 'slain', 'indiscretion', 'romance', 'building', 'CIA', 'handler', 'Who', 'can', 'trust', 'Who', 'side', 'also', 'love', 'way', 'make', 'appear', 'be', 'world', 'wish', 'course', 'had', 'budget', 'actually', 'go', 'places', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'scene', 'Honk', 'Kong', 'vs', 'what', 'LA', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'course', 'how', 'up', 'down', 'blue', 'hair', 'red', 'hair', 'showing', 'sorts', 'shapes', 'styles', 'can', 'look', 'nice.So', 'issues', 'First', ""'ll"", 'comment', 'are', ""n't"", 'huge', 'issues', 'avidly', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'Still', 'were', 'definitely', 'issues', 'were', 'jarring', 'process.First', 'realize', 'Sydney', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'adult', 'even', 'genius', 'mentally', ""n't"", 'fully', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'Still', 'things', 'plot', 'related', 'reasons', 'are', 'completely', 'inane', 'trained', 'spy', '*conveniently*', 'forgets', 'protocol', 'rationale', 'when', 'plot', 'happen', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'who', 'can', 'shoot', 'kick', 'box', 'kung', 'fu', 'pick', 'up', 'random', 'weapon', 'incredible', 'skill', 'when', 'plot', 'cheezy', 'security', 'guard', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'Surely', 'plot', 'could', 'have', '*reasonable*', 'reason', 'things', 'happen.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Sydney', 'African-American', 'best', 'friend', 'ups', 'downs', 'go', 'storyline', 'other', 'hand', 'Sydney', 'male', 'reporter', 'friend', 'drove', 'insane', 'lot', 'time', 'realize', 'reporters', 'need', 'be', 'investigative', 'need', 'be', 'diligent', 'dogged', 'guy', 'rapid-fire', 'method', 'harassing', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'many', 'stories', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'changed', 'lot', 'better', 'series', 'progressed.Something', 'really', 'struck', 'odd', 'Sydney', 'often', 'missions', 'SD-6', 'SD-6', 'monitoring', 'move', 'actively', 'VERBALLY', 'talking', 'hidden', 'mike', 'CIA', 'contact', 'entire', 'time', 'Even', 'signal', 'was', 'scrambled', 'SD-6', 'would', 'detect', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'SD-6', 'watchers', 'would', 'take', 'one', 'look', 'face', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'just', 'reading', 'lips.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'storyline', 'course', 'soap', 'opera', 'twists', 'turns', 'characters', 'disappearing', 'reappearing', 'great', 'watch-through', 'great', 'keep', 'replay', 'watch', 'subtle', 'movements', 'clues', 'are', 'ton', 'non-verbal', 'signals', 'being', 'given', 'here', 'only', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'third', 'watching.I', 'do', 'want', 'warn', 'DVD', 'super-cool', 'commentary', 'entire', 'cast', 'final', 'episode', 'really', 'funny', 'TON', 'spoilers', 'Surely', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'commentary', 'mentioning', 'things', 'season', '2', '3', 'are', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'recommend', 'NOT', 'watching', 'commentary', 'waiting', ""'re"", 'done', 'season', '3', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'you.Well', 'recommended']",Alias - The Complete First Season
599277,A2ZY5IX8MDRJY7,B00005JLF1,Lloyd J. Peasley,"[1, 1]","Approximately three-parts ludicrous in my most considered estimate, but as ludicrous is now the new plausible I guess it's only pedants like me who trouble ourselves over questions like how agents, after a mere year or so of training, are fluent in just about every language under the sun, have acquired martial-arts skills that would put Olympic medallists to shame, possess computer skills that enable them to hack into the most sophisticated databases in a matter of seconds, etc, etc. However, the good news is that once you learn to relax and accept these as mere conventions of TVLand then it becomes relatively easy to accept supermodel lookalikes as not only secret agents but able to maintain their alluring looks despite almost daily being tortured, beaten, and kick-boxed into near-submission. And, to be fair, Jennifer Garner is probably marginally less unbelievable than Uma Thurman in this kind of role; the martial arts sequences actually look quite believable in a technicolour kind of way. And I think concentrating on martial arts as the kickass method of choice rather than boring old guns is a real aesthetic positive.You'd expect such implausibilities would be played at least only half-seriously but the makers of this series deliver it almost completely straight - unless they're being extremely subtle in their satirical intent. At first, I thought they'd misjudged their tone but as the series developed I found the stolid insistence that these things could Really Happen became more and more convincing. About midway through Disc Three, I admit, I was starting to flag. There was far too much time devoted to Sydney's private life and I found this soppy and dull. I was craving some bite and pizzazz and luckily Quentin Tarantino rode to the rescue. His guest-star role in a double-episode about half-way through (with what sounds like his own improvised dialogue - sans the customary obscenities for Network TV consumption) simply ignited the whole series and from then on it rode the momentum to a resounding climax on Disc Six.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[4, 4]","You would not expect a daring, fresh show like Alias to be produced and sustained for so long by one of the three major networks.  Radical shows like FOX's Dark Angel and CBS's Wolf Lake were quickly cancelled.  I don't know how this show wound up on the same schedule as the usual safe, clunky, family fare, but I'm glad it did.Watching Alias is absolutely addictive.  It is like being trapped on a rollercoaster where once you think you will be able to disembark, the ride starts up again.  And each ride has new twists, turns, and tunnels.  Every aspect of this show is excellent.  And as good as the writing, the hypnotic throbbing score, the sets, photography, and characters are, the vehicle could not be carried without its star, Jennifer Garner.Garner's athletic ability, intelligence, vulnerability, and sweetness make her character Sydney Bristow a TV legend.  Her angst-filled relationship with her father is what sets this series apart from any other.  Usually the only deep relationship a woman in a series is allowed to have is a romantic one.  Why they haven't done an Alias, the Movie is beyond me.

Big fan of the Buffy the Vampire series and anything deep thought provoking, but not to over my head flicks, books, and video games.  I've always like Jennifer Garner.  Unfortunately, the very first movie I ever saw her in was some really dorky 13 year old movie but I had the foresight to not hold it against her.  That movie was pretty darn bad but I could see that she was the type of actress that had potential and was enjoyable to watch on screen.  Next came Juno and Elecktra and I was really impressed with her performance there so I thought I wouldn't hold it against her that she married Ben Aflack.So I bought the first season on Amazon, read that the director was the same director of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and pushed play.  This sucked me in at the pilot and I could see what all the buzz is about.  This series plays out like a live action, of course scaled down and edited version of Tomb Raider meets, Mission Impossible.  I would be hard pressed to say anything bad about this, . . so far, . .

There is her secret job, but it's not a problem working for SD-6, is it?When she makes the mistake of telling her fianc&eacute;e, however, she learns the truth.  SD-6 is not part of the US Government but really deals in organized crime.  Now, she must join the CIA as a double agent to try to take down the people who have been lying to her for six years.But life is not that simple.  She now must work closely with her father, someone she hardly knows and doesn't trust.  She must fight her attraction to her CIA handler.  And a friend is investigating a story that gets him closer to finding out her secret and putting his life in danger.I absolutely love this show.  There are multiple stories going on all the time, but the writers keep all the balls going believably, balancing action with the stories of what's happening with her friends and giving us very real characters.  And you can't miss a moment.  All the actors are top notch, keeping what could be an over-the-top concept real.  Extra kudos must go to star Jennifer Garner who makes Sydney real as an action hero with a very vulnerable side.When I got this set, I intended to watch just a few minutes and then dig it out when I'd have the time to really enjoy it.  Didn't happen.  Even though I'd seen every episode here twice, I got pulled right back into the story.  Of course, the cliffhangers at the end of every episode certainly help.This set is any collectors dream.  It contains the pilot and the rest of the first season, and the episodes, presented in surround sound and widescreen, look and sound incredible.  Each episode is broken down into several chapters, mostly around commercials breaks, although they aren't listed anywhere.  There are four audio commentaries with various members of the cast and crew.  Especially fun was the commentary on the finale featuring the entire cast.  Since the commentaries were recorded as season two drew to a close, they provide some interesting insight into both seasons and helped me understand a little more about their choices this last year.  Also included are a few deleted scenes, bloopers from the season, looks at the stunts and the filming of the pilot, and more.  About my only complaint with the set was that no where did they tell you where to find these special features.  While most are on disc six, I had to put each disc in to make sure I wasn't missing anything.I can't recommend this series highly enough.

While Jennifer Garner is certainly the heart and soul of the show, the supporting cast deserves their bows as well. Plus, creator J.J. Abrams has made the show fun for all. It's a roller coaster ride which switches from Sydney (Garner) chatting with friends (and lying about her profession), to Bond-like stunts.Victor Garber as Sydney's double agent father gives a stunning performance every time he hits the screen.

599295,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JLF1,Mitch Weaver,"[2, 2]","Sydney Bristow ( Jennifer Gardner) works for what she thinks is a group of the CIA known as SD-6. Then when her fiance is murdered for her telling him about it, she learns that SD-6 is not part of the CIA, and that it is actually a terrorist agency that works against the United States. Sydney then contacts the real CIA to become a double agent to help bring SD-6 down. The hard thing for Sydney is not to expose SD-6 for what it truly is to the rest of the SD-6 operatives. Everyone is still under the assumption that SD-6 is part of the CIA. Thrown into the mix is her father ( Victor Garber) who is also a double agent working for the CIA, her mission handler who gives her counter missions and who she must fight romantic feelings for Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), her SD-6 partner Marcus Dixon ( Carl Lumbly), and her two best friends who she must lie to - Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and Francie ( Merrin Dungey). Worst of all, there is Marvin Sloan (Ron Rifkin).  He was like a second father to Sydney; he recruited her into SD-6; he is the man who Sydney despises the most; and most importantly, he is the man who runs SD-6...Alias is a sleek, sexy, and action packed spy thriller that is guaranteed to turn you into an instant fan. The missions themselves provide for endless action, numerous close calls, and awesome fight sequenes. I also like how the show goes all over the world with the missions. With each mission, comes a new disguise for Sydney, and she looks good no matter what she dresses in! The acting is top notch. Not only is Jennifer Gardner extremely sexy, but she also provides for great acting and fighting scenes. Victor Garber is amazing s Sydney's dad. He is cold, calculating, and always looks out for himself. Ron Rifkin is amazing as Arvin Sloan, because even though he will make you despise him, he can also be extremely charming and likeable. Michael Vartan is great as Michael Vaughn. The sexual chemistry between him and Sydney is outstanding, and watching them fight their feelings for each other is even better. I must say though, one of the funniest and underrated characters on the show is Marshall the tech guy played by Kevin Weisman. Each week we get to see him demonstrate a new invention. The way that he does it will make you laugh.Alias is the most exciting and action packed show that is on right now. The acting and different missions both seperate Alias from the rest. I was absolutely thrilled that Alias was put out on DVD.

599313,A1VR77XNWXHGQ9,B00005JLF1,qmechanic,"[1, 1]","I watched Alias this summer in 2011 and I couldn't believe this show was made in 2001.Alias Season 1 has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.  I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this show since I'm not big on the spy genre.  On the surface, Alias seems like an action show with a female lead in sexy outfits, but it is much more than that.  It is a tour de force of tight writing, sharp dialogue, outstanding acting, and creative vision.  Alias is the story of Sydney Bristow -- the girl next door, straight-A student type who happens to sign up for spy work, out of patriotic inspiration and boredom.  Most spies and action heroes are cold, calculating personalities, so this was a refreshing concept.  The show works for me because as absurd as the plot twists become, I believe in Sydney Bristow.  Her character is always grounded and she is easy to relate to, because she is sensitive and wears her heart on her sleeve.  This is J.J. Abram's trademark -- the drama that is both realistic and absurd at the same time.  Sydney does crazy spy work and juggles both a double-life and double-agent job, but she comes home to hang out with her friends who know nothing about her spy life, and she struggles with her relationships with her father and her paternalistic boss.  As weird as the espionage world gets, we can always relate to hating your boss, trying to get along with parents, and managing work-life balance.  It's hard to find compelling 20-something female leading roles in Hollywood, which makes me appreciate Sydney Bristow on a personal level.The show further innovates by mixing different genres: espionage, mystery/thriller, and a little soapy drama.  I love cross-genre shows because there is more variety, less chance of falling into cliches, and the audience doesn't quite know what to expect.  The action sequences, camera work, and costumes are film quality.  You will have fun watching Sydney execute her missions.  I'm not a connoisseur of spy shows, but I was entertained by the different wigs/dresses, car chases, and parachuting.I really enjoyed the writing and fast-paced plotting.  Not many words are wasted.  The action sequences are cut extremely tight.  Unlike other spy shows, there isn't much mission preparation or debriefing shown; we just see Sydney stealing item X and then we're back in Los Angeles.  One moment Sydney is in spy headquarters and then she's having beer at her apartment with her best buddies.  Yet the show takes the time to explore Sydney's emotional reactions, which keeps the show grounded in reality.The big selling point for me is Jennifer Garner's performance.  She is naturally charismatic and has probably the world's best smile, making Sydney probably the most likable spy in cinematic history.  (It seems like every male character on the show is in love with Sydney -- a joke, but not far from the truth.)  Garner clearly put 100% effort into her acting.  Watch her face when she runs -- it's clear that both Garner and Sydney take their job seriously.  Sydney Bristow is an extremely demanding role (Sydney is in almost every scene, stunt sequences, foreign languages, dramatic acting) and Garner does everything very well.  The rest of the cast is absolutely stellar.  I don't know how many TV shows have ever had a cast this good.  There are two critically acclaimed Broadway actors (Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin) and Michael Vartan, Bradley Cooper, and Merrin Dungey have all gone on to great careers (in particular Cooper has become a huge star).  Kevin Weisman is funny and charming as the comic relief, and Carl Lumbly, as Sydney's partner, lends gravity and presence to the show.  Every single cast member is fantastic and my only complaint is that I wish Vartan and Dungey's characters could have been written better.  The superb acting is what really makes the show work.  In the hands of lesser actors, the show would have become campy.If you've read this far, you should buy this series now!  I'll leave you with the words of a TV critic:""Alias isn't a perfect series, by any means. But I do think it's the most important show of the past ten years that's been completely swept under the rug. ...

599323,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JLF1,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[5, 6]","Don't get me wrong -- ""Felicity"" was a decent show and definitely had its good points, but nothing I saw in that show would lead me to believe that J.J. Abrams, the creative mind behind both ""Felicity"" and ""Alias"" and now a new show called ""Lost,"" would be capable of this sort of work.Well, consider my opinions revised. This first season of ""Alias"" represents some of the best television I've seen in quite some time. I'd heard of it, of course, and when I picked it up my wife and I started watching it late one Saturday night. We were both hooked, and I mean immediately. We stayed up watching the next episodes until we literally couldn't keep our eyes open any longer, and then we did the same the next night, and the next, until the season was done. Then we started on season two. I'm here to tell you that ""Alias"" is the crack cocaine of episodic television -- it's that addictive.And with good reason... the story of Sydney Bristow, who at the beginning of the show appears to be just a struggling (possibly daydreaming) college student, then walks into a building and becomes a secret agent for a special ops division of the government, and THEN learns that even that part of her life is a falsehood (and we're still in the first episode here, folks) is positively gripping.Jennifer Garner brings an astonishingly adept quality to her character. On the one hand Sydney has the sensitivity and the emotions we might expect of a young woman in college, but she also has a harder edge to her, an intelligence and a confidence which she brings to her work convincingly and unerringly. Garner balances both aspects of this role very well, and we get to see some of that balance almost every episode. The other actors surrounding her, such as Ron Rifkin and Victor Garber, bring their considerable talents to the table as well, and the combination is utterly believable. I find myself really enjoying Garber's acting in particular, and admiring his stoic, straightforward, no-bull attitude even though I know it's all an act (in more ways than one).In terms of the episodes themselves, it should be evident almost right away that these are not stand-alone stories. Abrams is telling a broad story in ""Alias,"" one which we follow from one episode to another, to the point that if a viewer were to miss a few they would get quickly lost. Almost every episode in this first season is of a consistent quality that makes them all delightful to watch. Other than a couple episodes near the end of the first season, in which they seemed to stumble and lose their way a little, the writers and directors of this show keep it interesting through every episode. Even the brief lapse near the end is made up for by a bang-up season finale which will leave you clamoring for season two.I would be remiss if I didn't mention my favorite part of the first season of ""Alias"" -- the two-part episode called ""The Box."" Though involving many elements from the preceding story, ""The Box"" is about as close to a stand-alone story as you get in ""Alias,"" as most of the major story elements of its two episodes are self-contained, with some story threads making their way in and out of it -- not necessarily the same threads, of course. Apart from featuring a prominent ""guest"" role for Quentin Tarantino (in which he proves yet again that he's not a great actor, but the show doesn't suffer for it), ""The Box"" is notable because its of good enough quality as it was made to hold its own against almost any big-budget blockbuster action film showing up on the silver screen, and in fact ""The Box"" comes out ahead of most action films in many ways. From the intelligence and complexity of the story to the high standard of production, these two episodes stood out for me in almost every way.As a whole, the first season of ""Alias"" is everything you've probably heard it is. It's a complex, intelligent, high-octane thrill-ride of a story, and it's utterly addictive.

599325,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLF1,Robert Moore,"[17, 19]","As my review title indications, this fast-paced series comes across as a stylish blend of a James Bond spy flick, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER girl-powered heroine, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE capers, and PERILS OF PAULINE cliffhangers.  The latter is not peripheral to the series:  like old style film serials, almost every episode of Season One ends with a shock.  I have only recently discovered the series on DVD, which I believe is merciful.  Had I been watching it on TV as it first came out, I would have found the week-in, week-out cliffhanging endings to be exasperating.  The show is brilliant at breaking the action at precisely the most thrilling instant each week.  I know this:  if I had been watching this on TV, I would definitely have tuned in the next week.  As it is, I immediately pop in the next DVD just to see what happened next.  Like both MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and I SPY, the show features locales from all over the world, though obviously most of the scenes consist of a single remote shot to establish the country, with the rest of the scene most likely shot on a backlot or in a studio.  Nonetheless, even this gives the show a very cosmopolitan, exotic feel.I'm one of those who thinks that the best thing that ever happened to TV is the long story arc TV show that was popularized by THE X-FILES, and carried on by such shows as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE.  The one way that TV surpasses cinema is in its ability to tell a long, carefully detailed story in a lovingly nuanced and unrushed manner.  ALIAS has a host of storylines, but it isn't forced to develop any of them all at once.  One week might find a small development in Sydney's ongoing attempt to work as a double agent in SD6, a larger development in Will's investigation into the death of Sydney's fiance in the first episode, and a tiny bit on some non-espionage friendship.  Movies have to rush such things, or at most present the illusion of not having to rush.  TV can truly take its time, and the overall effect in the best shows can be exhilarating.Everything about this show clicks.  It is visually as slick as anything that has ever been on TV.  The writing is absolutely brilliant.  The cast is rock solid, and features some great acting on the part of several performers.  Among my favorite are Victor Garber as Sydney's father, Kevin as Marshall J. Flinkman (basically SD6's equivalent of Q), and Ron Rifkin as Sloane.  But the heart of the show is Jennifer Garner as double agent Sydney Bristow.  Sydney is idealistic, brilliant, and enormously competent, but also haunted and conflicted by her family background and tragic events in her life.  I love the contrast between her professional competence and her emotional fragility.  A lesser actress wouldn't be able to sell that combination, but she makes it the key to her personality.It is difficult to overpraise the writing on the show.  Even compared to shows like BUFFY it has almost completely avoided the episodic approach to television.  In fact, the episodes spill over into each other to such a degree that it is almost as if the entire season were a single story, except for the way it spills over as well.  Not every storyline gets equal attention, but overall the balance they achieve is astonishing.  Some reviewers decry the show as derivative, but I find the particular combination of familiar elements to be quite unique.  Other shows do some of the things that ALIAS does, but not all of them.",5,James Bond meets Buffy meets Perils of Pauline,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,3469,"['review', 'title', 'indications', 'fast-paced', 'series', 'stylish', 'blend', 'James', 'Bond', 'spy', 'flick', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'girl-powered', 'heroine', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'capers', 'PERILS', 'OF', 'PAULINE', 'cliffhangers', 'latter', 'not', 'peripheral', 'series', 'old', 'style', 'film', 'serials', 'almost', 'episode', 'Season', 'One', 'shock', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'series', 'DVD', 'believe', 'merciful', 'Had', 'been', 'watching', 'TV', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'week-in', 'week-out', 'cliffhanging', 'endings', 'be', 'exasperating', 'show', 'brilliant', 'breaking', 'action', 'precisely', 'most', 'thrilling', 'instant', 'week', 'know', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'TV', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'tuned', 'next', 'week', 'immediately', 'pop', 'next', 'DVD', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'SPY', 'show', 'locales', 'world', 'though', 'obviously', 'most', 'scenes', 'consist', 'single', 'remote', 'shot', 'establish', 'country', 'rest', 'scene', 'most', 'likely', 'shot', 'backlot', 'studio', 'Nonetheless', 'even', 'show', 'very', 'cosmopolitan', 'exotic', 'feel.I', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'TV', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'popularized', 'X-FILES', 'carried', 'such', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'FARSCAPE', 'one', 'way', 'TV', 'surpasses', 'cinema', 'ability', 'tell', 'long', 'carefully', 'detailed', 'story', 'lovingly', 'nuanced', 'unrushed', 'manner', 'ALIAS', 'host', 'storylines', ""n't"", 'forced', 'develop', 'once', 'One', 'week', 'might', 'find', 'small', 'development', 'Sydney', 'ongoing', 'attempt', 'work', 'double', 'agent', 'SD6', 'larger', 'development', 'Will', 'investigation', 'death', 'Sydney', 'fiance', 'first', 'episode', 'tiny', 'bit', 'non-espionage', 'friendship', 'Movies', 'have', 'rush', 'such', 'things', 'most', 'present', 'illusion', 'not', 'having', 'rush', 'TV', 'can', 'truly', 'take', 'time', 'overall', 'effect', 'best', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'exhilarating.Everything', 'show', 'visually', 'as', 'slick', 'anything', 'ever', 'been', 'TV', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'rock', 'solid', 'great', 'acting', 'part', 'several', 'performers', 'favorite', 'are', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Sydney', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Marshall', 'J.', 'Flinkman', 'basically', 'SD6', 'equivalent', 'Q', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Sloane', 'heart', 'show', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'double', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Sydney', 'idealistic', 'brilliant', 'enormously', 'competent', 'also', 'haunted', 'conflicted', 'family', 'background', 'tragic', 'events', 'life', 'love', 'contrast', 'professional', 'competence', 'emotional', 'fragility', 'lesser', 'actress', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'combination', 'key', 'personality.It', 'difficult', 'overpraise', 'writing', 'show', 'Even', 'compared', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'almost', 'completely', 'avoided', 'episodic', 'approach', 'television', 'fact', 'episodes', 'spill', 'other', 'degree', 'almost', 'entire', 'season', 'were', 'single', 'story', 'way', 'over', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'storyline', 'equal', 'attention', 'balance', 'achieve', 'astonishing', 'reviewers', 'decry', 'show', 'derivative', 'find', 'particular', 'combination', 'familiar', 'elements', 'be', 'quite', 'unique', 'Other', 'shows', 'do', 'things', 'ALIAS', 'not']",Alias - The Complete First Season

599327,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JLF1,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT:Sydney Bristow is a grad student living in LA and working part time at Credit Dauphine.  Ahh, but there's more - CD is actually a front for SD-6, a black-ops arm of the CIA, and Syd is one of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, bravely conducting missions around the world.  Ahh, but it's not over yet - SD-6 really has no connection to the CIA.  In fact, SD-6 is actually one of a number of semi-autonomous departments of a large, clandestine and thoroughly criminal enterprise known as ""The Alliance"".  Syd learns this from her father shortly after finding her fianc&eacute;e murdered and herself marked for death in the first episode of this show.  Jack Bristow, a man with seemingly no connection to SD-6 prior to that moment, is himself a double-agent - working for the real CIA against SD-6 from the inside.  Soon Syd is following in the footsteps of her father, a man she hardly knows.  Put under the supervision of a CIA handler named Vaughn, Syd's workload doubles - carrying out CIA counter-missions during SD-6 operations.  As Season 1 progresses, we learn more of the hierarchy of The Alliance, of the conflicting loyalties of Sydney, and that of the other mercenary organizations with whom The Alliance periodically competes and wars against.Though shadowy espionage highlights the action, the show tosses in some interesting and unexpected touches.  Early on, we find that SD-6 and its competitors have taken an interest in an obscure renaissance-era inventor named Rambaldi - a man whose notes seem to predict digital computing and cellphones centuries ahead of their time.  With subtle hints that suggest just how devastating all this cloakNdagger can get, ""Alias"" bridges the gap between espionage and sci-fi as the Bond movies had without going in the camp direction.Never forgetting that Syd is the star of the show, the scripts also dwell on her homelife, on her roommate Francie and on the reporter Will Tippin.  Tippin's unrequited love for Sydney will draw him into investigating her fiancee's murder - a move which will bring him face to face with SD-6.I SAT THROUGH EACH EPISODE DESPITE:I Got into this show because of JJ Abrams, also the man behind ""Lost"", but ""Alias"" is the anti-""Lost"" in many ways.  Few of the characters manage to be credible and absorbing at the same time.  The stories practically grind to a halt when returning us to Syd's apartment - are everyday people that annoyingly boring?  Virtually all of the main characters are cyborgs, including Sydney (except when she has to have an emotional moment).  Many of the missions are repetitive - go somewhere, find something, clobber some baddies using Matrix-like choreography, show off some great costuming, use some near-magic gadgetry to get past secure spaces and get out.  So many critical items are stolen from offices secured by biometric devices that it's incredible that anybody still relied on them half-way through the first season.  The show gets undue mileage from unnecessary famous guest stars - Roger Moore as one of the Alliance bigwigs and Quentin Tarantino as a former SD-6 operative who turns traitor.I IGNORED THE FLAWS BECAUSE:Despite the show's repeated cheats, ""Alias"" is still loads of fun.  The actors bond in ways that their characters' bios wouldn't suggest.  The scripts intriguingly weave the show's many subplots through each episode - Tippen will have to face SD-6, but how will it look from the outside?  Syd's best friend in SD-6 is co-Agent Dixon, a really noble guy but still a loyal SD-6 agent - will Syd have to kill him when he begins to uncover clues to her identity as a double-agent?  And just where is all this Rambaldi stuff going anyway?At its worst, ""Alias"" is breezy and unmemorable, but more often that that, it's absorbing fun.",4,Fun,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3787,"['YOU', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'grad', 'student', 'living', 'LA', 'working', 'part', 'time', 'Credit', 'Dauphine', 'Ahh', 'more', 'CD', 'actually', 'front', 'SD-6', 'black-ops', 'arm', 'CIA', 'Syd', 'one', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'bravely', 'conducting', 'missions', 'world', 'Ahh', 'not', 'over', 'yet', 'SD-6', 'really', 'connection', 'CIA', 'fact', 'SD-6', 'actually', 'one', 'number', 'semi-autonomous', 'departments', 'large', 'clandestine', 'thoroughly', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'known', 'Alliance', 'Syd', 'father', 'shortly', 'finding', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'murdered', 'marked', 'death', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'man', 'seemingly', 'connection', 'SD-6', 'prior', 'moment', 'double-agent', 'working', 'real', 'CIA', 'SD-6', 'inside', 'Soon', 'Syd', 'following', 'footsteps', 'father', 'man', 'hardly', 'Put', 'supervision', 'CIA', 'handler', 'named', 'Vaughn', 'Syd', 'workload', 'carrying', 'out', 'CIA', 'counter-missions', 'SD-6', 'operations', 'Season', '1', 'progresses', 'learn', 'more', 'hierarchy', 'Alliance', 'conflicting', 'loyalties', 'Sydney', 'other', 'mercenary', 'organizations', 'whom', 'Alliance', 'periodically', 'wars', 'shadowy', 'espionage', 'highlights', 'action', 'show', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'touches', 'Early', 'find', 'SD-6', 'competitors', 'have', 'taken', 'interest', 'obscure', 'renaissance-era', 'inventor', 'named', 'Rambaldi', 'man', 'notes', 'seem', 'predict', 'digital', 'computing', 'cellphones', 'centuries', 'ahead', 'time', 'subtle', 'hints', 'suggest', 'just', 'how', 'devastating', 'cloakNdagger', 'can', 'get', 'Alias', 'gap', 'espionage', 'sci-fi', 'Bond', 'movies', 'had', 'going', 'camp', 'direction.Never', 'forgetting', 'Syd', 'star', 'show', 'scripts', 'also', 'dwell', 'homelife', 'roommate', 'Francie', 'reporter', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Tippin', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Sydney', 'will', 'draw', 'investigating', 'fiancee', 'murder', 'move', 'will', 'bring', 'face', 'face', 'SD-6.I', 'SAT', 'THROUGH', 'EACH', 'EPISODE', 'DESPITE', 'Got', 'show', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'also', 'man', 'Lost', 'Alias', 'anti-', 'Lost', 'many', 'ways', 'Few', 'characters', 'manage', 'be', 'credible', 'absorbing', 'same', 'time', 'stories', 'practically', 'grind', 'halt', 'when', 'returning', 'Syd', 'apartment', 'are', 'everyday', 'people', 'annoyingly', 'boring', 'Virtually', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'cyborgs', 'including', 'Sydney', 'when', 'have', 'emotional', 'moment', 'Many', 'missions', 'are', 'repetitive', 'go', 'somewhere', 'find', 'something', 'clobber', 'baddies', 'using', 'Matrix-like', 'choreography', 'show', 'off', 'great', 'costuming', 'use', 'near-magic', 'gadgetry', 'get', 'past', 'secure', 'spaces', 'get', 'out', 'So', 'many', 'critical', 'items', 'are', 'stolen', 'offices', 'secured', 'biometric', 'devices', 'incredible', 'anybody', 'still', 'relied', 'half-way', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'undue', 'mileage', 'unnecessary', 'famous', 'guest', 'stars', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'one', 'Alliance', 'bigwigs', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'former', 'SD-6', 'operative', 'who', 'traitor.I', 'IGNORED', 'THE', 'FLAWS', 'BECAUSE', 'show', 'repeated', 'cheats', 'Alias', 'still', 'loads', 'fun', 'actors', 'bond', 'ways', 'characters', 'bios', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'scripts', 'intriguingly', 'weave', 'show', 'many', 'subplots', 'episode', 'Tippen', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'SD-6', 'how', 'will', 'look', 'outside', 'Syd', 'best', 'friend', 'SD-6', 'co-Agent', 'Dixon', 'really', 'noble', 'guy', 'still', 'loyal', 'SD-6', 'agent', 'will', 'Syd', 'have', 'kill', 'when', 'uncover', 'clues', 'identity', 'double-agent', 'just', 'where', 'Rambaldi', 'stuff', 'going', 'anyway', 'worst', 'Alias', 'breezy', 'unmemorable', 'more', 'often', 'absorbing', 'fun']",Alias - The Complete First Season

Kind of like a Mission Impossible/Girl from UNCLE mix-up, Sydney gets involved in a covert operation known as SD-6.  After they assassinate her boyfriend to keep their location and existence secret, she decides to become a double-agent and work for the CIA, to bring down SD-6 and then ""get the hell out"" of the spy business.Except that SD-6 is quite an octopus with nuclear bomb sales to foreign lands and a ruthless director.  They don't yet suspect that Sydney (played admirably by Jennifer Gardner) is a double agent and give her all kinds of interesting assignments.So far we have the usual socially-inept guy who gives the low-down on secret devices such as a sonic disrupter pen or a walkie-talkie necklace, brings back memories of Mission Impossible and the old James Bond movies.  She also has an evil agent competitor who seems to out-wit and be one step ahead of her at every turn.As I understand it, Alias later morphed into a science fiction show which I'd like to see that transformation.Meantime, season one looks pretty fresh and exciting.  The cliffhanger endings keep you wanting more and the staccato music brings back memories of Lalo Shafrin's Mission Impossible.The downside is that Sydney's escape of some impossible situations seems a bit too pat to me. And when she does escape, how does she get back to the USA in record time?  Some plot holes such as this take away from the overall excitement of the show.Recommended.Other TV Series:Alias - The Complete First SeasonAlias: The Complete Second SeasonOther Jennifer Garner Appearances:Elektra (Widescreen Edition)Daredevil (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)",4,First Season Hooks You In -- Spy Thriller!,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1709,"['Alias', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'stories', 'really', 'rock', 'Kind', 'Mission', 'Impossible/Girl', 'UNCLE', 'mix-up', 'Sydney', 'involved', 'covert', 'operation', 'known', 'SD-6', 'assassinate', 'boyfriend', 'keep', 'location', 'existence', 'secret', 'become', 'double-agent', 'work', 'CIA', 'bring', 'down', 'SD-6', 'then', 'get', 'hell', 'out', 'spy', 'SD-6', 'quite', 'octopus', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'sales', 'foreign', 'lands', 'ruthless', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'suspect', 'Sydney', 'played', 'admirably', 'Jennifer', 'Gardner', 'double', 'agent', 'give', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'assignments.So', 'far', 'have', 'usual', 'socially-inept', 'guy', 'who', 'low-down', 'secret', 'devices', 'such', 'sonic', 'disrupter', 'pen', 'walkie-talkie', 'necklace', 'back', 'memories', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'old', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'also', 'evil', 'agent', 'competitor', 'who', 'out-wit', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'turn.As', 'understand', 'Alias', 'later', 'morphed', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'transformation.Meantime', 'season', 'one', 'pretty', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'cliffhanger', 'keep', 'wanting', 'more', 'staccato', 'music', 'back', 'memories', 'Lalo', 'Shafrin', 'Mission', 'Impossible.The', 'downside', 'Sydney', 'escape', 'impossible', 'situations', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'when', 'escape', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'USA', 'record', 'time', 'plot', 'holes', 'such', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'excitement', 'show.Recommended.Other', 'TV', 'Series', 'Alias', 'Complete', 'First', 'SeasonAlias', 'Complete', 'Second', 'SeasonOther', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Appearances', 'Elektra', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Daredevil', 'Two-Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",Alias - The Complete First Season

599336,A3G8M1XWGVW9XX,B00005JLF1,"shelley de lange ""avid reader""","[0, 0]","This show does what the most addictive shows do: it takes two genres and mixes them together, has serial story lines that take many shows to resolve so you always want to know how things are going to resolve, and it is excellently cast with supurb actors. The characters are written as complex people, no one is totally bad or good, or always smart or always dumb.Not only is this show a spy thriller, it is also a family drama. there isn't just one spy, there's an entire rather dysfunctional family of spies! This really amps up the tension, humor, and other emotions, so much more so than the usual ""lone gunman"" type spy thriller, because everyone impacts everyone else, and they all have so much more to lose. After all, who's going to cry if James Bond dies? When he gets hurt, the only one who cares is his physician.J.J. Abrams doesn't stop there - he also presents the show in a unique way. He isn't afraid to mess with linear time and gives us glimpses of Sydney in future peril cut in amidst a calm present, so we're left wondering how she got into trouble, why, and dreading it. We still worry about whether she'll get out of trouble, even though we know she must, because we care for her so much! He lets each show begin with a long segment before breaking in with the opening theme and credits. The pacing is really amazing. The audience never gets too comfortable, something major - or two or three or four major things - will happen each show, guaranteed.The musical score is brilliant, increasing the tension with drumbeats that sound like doom ticking closer and closer, or the adrenaline surging our heart rate to danger levels. They also use many classical songs from the past and the best of the present to heighten poignancy and sadness.ABC cannily offers a Website that explains the complex structure of the storyline, which includes conspiracies galore and strange artifacts from an ancient genius. This is one show that does not underestimate the intelligence of its audience and is obviously geared to give us as much fun, thrills and impact as possible.The traditional frills of the genre are there in abundance - the spy toys which never get used twice, introduced by the lovable geek Marshall, great fight scenes, capers in exotic locations. We're also treated to great love stories, and every kind at that - forbidden love, unrequited love, betrayed love, you name it!I am so looking forward to owning this collection, and every season at that!",5,Why This Show is So Addictive!,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,2474,"['show', 'what', 'most', 'addictive', 'shows', 'do', 'two', 'genres', 'mixes', 'together', 'serial', 'story', 'lines', 'take', 'many', 'shows', 'resolve', 'so', 'always', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'resolve', 'excellently', 'cast', 'supurb', 'actors', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'complex', 'people', 'one', 'totally', 'bad', 'good', 'always', 'smart', 'always', 'dumb.Not', 'only', 'show', 'spy', 'thriller', 'also', 'family', 'drama', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'spy', 'entire', 'rather', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'spies', 'really', 'up', 'tension', 'humor', 'other', 'emotions', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'usual', 'lone', 'gunman', 'type', 'spy', 'thriller', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'lose', 'who', 'going', 'cry', 'James', 'Bond', 'dies', 'When', 'hurt', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'physician.J.J', 'Abrams', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'also', 'show', 'unique', 'way', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'mess', 'linear', 'time', 'glimpses', 'Sydney', 'future', 'peril', 'cut', 'amidst', 'calm', 'present', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'got', 'trouble', 'why', 'dreading', 'still', 'worry', ""'ll"", 'get', 'trouble', 'even', 'know', 'must', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'long', 'segment', 'breaking', 'opening', 'theme', 'credits', 'pacing', 'really', 'amazing', 'audience', 'never', 'too', 'comfortable', 'something', 'major', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'major', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'show', 'guaranteed.The', 'musical', 'score', 'brilliant', 'increasing', 'tension', 'drumbeats', 'sound', 'doom', 'ticking', 'closer', 'closer', 'adrenaline', 'surging', 'heart', 'rate', 'danger', 'levels', 'also', 'use', 'many', 'classical', 'songs', 'past', 'best', 'present', 'heighten', 'poignancy', 'sadness.ABC', 'cannily', 'Website', 'complex', 'structure', 'storyline', 'conspiracies', 'galore', 'strange', 'artifacts', 'ancient', 'genius', 'one', 'show', 'not', 'underestimate', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'obviously', 'geared', 'give', 'much', 'fun', 'thrills', 'impact', 'possible.The', 'traditional', 'frills', 'genre', 'are', 'there', 'abundance', 'spy', 'never', 'get', 'used', 'twice', 'introduced', 'lovable', 'geek', 'Marshall', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'capers', 'exotic', 'locations', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'great', 'love', 'stories', 'kind', 'forbidden', 'love', 'unrequited', 'love', 'betrayed', 'love', 'name', 'am', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'owning', 'collection', 'season']",Alias - The Complete First Season

When the show airs, I'm either watching another show, or I'm about to fall asleep being I wake up so early to go to the gym in the morning.  My brother and some of my friends told me if I enjoy 24, I will love Alias.  I happened to find Season 1 of Alias on the shelves of my local library, and decided to borrow it.  I'm glad I did, and I've just placed my order for Alias seasons 1 - 3 on DVD.  This is a show I will HAVE to own!!!  This show has it all.  I love the multiple plots, the action, the stunts, and the costumes Jennifer gets to wear.  I was so into the show I spent the whole weekend watching Season 1 on DVD.  I started Friday and did not finish until Sunday afternoon.  That's right I spent a whole weekend watching all of season 1 on DVD.  I had my very own Alias viewing marathon, and loved every second of it.Season 1 finds Sydney a graduate student recruited into an organization she thought was a government agency, called SD-6.  Sydney makes the horrible mistake of telling her new fianc&eacute; she is part of this organization, and he is killed.  When she finds out SD-6 is responsible for the murder, she also finds out that SD-6 is actually a counter government agency.  Sydney approaches the CIA, and becomes a double agent.  As a double agent she will go on missions for sSD-6 but will pass the information to her CIA handler Vaughn.  In addition to dealing with her fianc&eacute;'s murder, Sydney is having to deal with the fact that her father is also a double agent, and their strained relationship.  She is also trying to keep her professional life a secret from her friends Will a reporter, and Francie.  They think she works for a bank and has to travel a lot.  If they only knew.  She also has to keep her secret from her friend, and fellow agent Dixon.  That's so hard for her because they have a close relationship, and she hates deceiving him.  Sydney will not be satisfied until she has revenge on Sloan and SD-6 is gone forever.I was riveted to my seat waiting to see what would happen next.  There are times you will hold your breath because you have no idea how a situation will turn out.  There were times I've jumped out of my seat screaming when certain things take place.  There are some violent scenes, but they are actually pivotal to the story which is rare.  This show is so exciting; you can't help but get hooked.  The way season 1 ends, you will rush out getting your hands on Season 2 !!!

I have seen alot of action television shows and the reason i enjoyed this more than anything else is that it gets you away for an hour much like some of the movies do at the theatre for two i feel almost as if i have watched a motion picture after one of these episodes. The acting is so much better than anything i have seen now i look at these other shows and can't help noticing the poor acting going on. The entire cast is perfect and jennifer garner should win every emmy award until the show ends with the acting she has done on this show UNBELIEVABE not to mention the fantastic acting by the rest of the cast WOW.  give this show a beyond perfect score it deserves more than the maximum five stars allowed if you have not seen it this dvd is perfect each episode is presented in anamorphic widescreen ( those who have widescreen tv's will be in heavan) and fantastic 5.1 surround sound along with some fantastic special features including a great gag reel and a very cool look into season two. So i urge you who have not seen this show rent or better yet buy this season now you will be on the edge of your seat from the moment it starts.

But then, after recently getting into 24 and becoming oh so addicted, I went online and decided to see  what reviews were given for Alias. I never knew the show was emmy nominated so I thought I'd give it a chance and checked out volume 1 at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised.The acting is really good, the action ain't bad, and the plots are really gripping.  I'd have to say this show is pretty much a cross between James Bond and the O.C.  You got all the fancy gadgets, action, and sex appeal of the James Bond movies along with the drama of the O.C. with Sydney and her friends/family.  Even though the action can sometimes seem a little off, I still think it's a really cool show and, in my opinion, is suitable for the entire family.  I don't wanna compare this to 24 like many have, so I'll just say: give it a chance before you dismiss it like I did. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. The first few episodes have a little too much drama with the friends and family, but then the suspense really picks up later on, so don't give up after just a few episodes.  Oh, and it's also worth the fifty bucks. You can watch it again years later when it's faded from your memory andthe cable/sattelite goes out.

599363,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLF1,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[10, 11]","Always action packed and entertaining, the first season of Alias, like a lot of television shows, was hampered a bit by having to set up its premise and characters. All of this paid off with the second season but the first season is exceptional with a number of strong episodes. Sydney (the wonderful Jennifer Garner) discovers that, while she thought she was working for the CIA, she was, in fact, working for the bad guys in an organization called SD-6. Sydney finds out the hard way when her fiance is brutally murdered at the orders of Sloan ( the oily Ron Rifkin) her boss at SD-6. She discovers all of this from her father ( the exceptional Victor Garber). She had assumed her father was working for a company that makes airplane parts but he's an agent for SD-6 and there's more; he's a double agent spying on the organization for the CIA.The plot twists like a modern rollercoaster. Sydney eventually agrees to become a double agent for the CIA as well to eventually get Sloan and SD-6 for the bad things they've done. Unfortunately, most of the people including her partner (the superb Carl Lumley)believe they're working for the good guys which creates quite a bit of conflict for Sydney.Creator J. J. Abrams has created an unusual blend of The Prisoner, Mission: Impossible, The X-Files and Felicity. What's amazing is that the series works despite drawing on these varied sources. The writing is, for the most part, first class and the acting in his spy opera is exceptional. If some of the performances are a bit over-the-top, keep in mind it works within the genre and the format of the show.The first six episodes are exceptional but when the series gets bogged down in the Rimbaldi Prophecy late in the season, the show loses some of its focus. Abrams tries a bit too hard to build up a mythology much like The X-Files by using this McGuffin to drive the stories. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit too much of a focus during the last part of season one. It's not bad, just a bit much to swallow.The story arc of the first season will be, for the most part, resolved by the middle of season two allowing for fresh, interesting vistas to keep fans interested. One other unusual attribute of the series is the stunt casting. During season one and two we see a number of exceptional guest stars including Christian Slater, Rutger Hauer, Amy Irving and Ethan Hawke. The casting works because the actors play characters that lend themselves for instant identification and to their strengths.The DVD transfer are quite good with some compression issues but nothing noteable. The sound is exceptional. There are a number of cool extras including the gag reel for the season and three featurettes plus commentary on a number of key episodes. My only complaint is that Touchstone doesn't have a chapter menu within individual episodes. If you forget to activate your memory on your DVD player and have to stop playing it, you'll have to skip around a bit. It wouldn't have been that big a deal to provide the additional chapter selections on the disc (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a great example of this).While the kudos for the show is much deserved, the second season is really where the series pays off. I'd still recommend renting or purchasing the first season in order to follow the story arcs set up for season two (and later season three).",3,3 1/2 STARS FOR ALIAS FIRST SEASON,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,3353,"['Always', 'action', 'packed', 'entertaining', 'first', 'season', 'Alias', 'lot', 'television', 'shows', 'was', 'hampered', 'bit', 'having', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'characters', 'paid', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'exceptional', 'number', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Sydney', 'wonderful', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'thought', 'was', 'working', 'CIA', 'was', 'fact', 'working', 'bad', 'guys', 'organization', 'called', 'SD-6', 'Sydney', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'when', 'fiance', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'orders', 'Sloan', 'oily', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'boss', 'SD-6', 'father', 'exceptional', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'had', 'assumed', 'father', 'was', 'working', 'company', 'airplane', 'parts', 'agent', 'SD-6', 'more', 'double', 'agent', 'spying', 'organization', 'CIA.The', 'plot', 'twists', 'modern', 'rollercoaster', 'Sydney', 'eventually', 'become', 'double', 'agent', 'CIA', 'as', 'well', 'eventually', 'get', 'Sloan', 'SD-6', 'bad', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'partner', 'superb', 'Carl', 'Lumley', 'believe', ""'re"", 'working', 'good', 'guys', 'quite', 'bit', 'conflict', 'Sydney.Creator', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'created', 'unusual', 'blend', 'Prisoner', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'X-Files', 'Felicity', 'What', 'amazing', 'series', 'drawing', 'varied', 'sources', 'writing', 'most', 'part', 'first', 'class', 'acting', 'spy', 'opera', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'are', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'keep', 'mind', 'genre', 'format', 'show.The', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'exceptional', 'when', 'series', 'bogged', 'down', 'Rimbaldi', 'Prophecy', 'late', 'season', 'show', 'focus', 'Abrams', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'build', 'up', 'mythology', 'much', 'X-Files', 'using', 'McGuffin', 'drive', 'stories', 'Unfortunately', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'last', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'bit', 'much', 'swallow.The', 'story', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'resolved', 'middle', 'season', 'two', 'allowing', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'vistas', 'keep', 'fans', 'interested', 'One', 'other', 'unusual', 'attribute', 'series', 'stunt', 'casting', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'see', 'number', 'exceptional', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'casting', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', 'lend', 'instant', 'identification', 'strengths.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'compression', 'issues', 'nothing', 'noteable', 'sound', 'exceptional', 'are', 'number', 'cool', 'extras', 'including', 'gag', 'reel', 'season', 'three', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'number', 'key', 'episodes', 'only', 'complaint', 'Touchstone', ""n't"", 'have', 'chapter', 'menu', 'individual', 'episodes', 'forget', 'activate', 'memory', 'DVD', 'player', 'have', 'stop', 'playing', ""'ll"", 'have', 'skip', 'around', 'bit', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'big', 'deal', 'provide', 'additional', 'chapter', 'selections', 'disc', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'great', 'example', 'kudos', 'show', 'much', 'deserved', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'where', 'series', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'first', 'season', 'order', 'follow', 'story', 'arcs', 'set', 'up', 'season', 'two', 'later', 'season', 'three']",Alias - The Complete First Season

Wheres the continuity!?The only reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because Season 2 is so much better!",4,Spies rock!,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,582,"['stumbled', 'Alias', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'show', 'watch', 'DVD', 'such', 'low', 'quality', 'television', 'days', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'Season', 'One', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'get', 'hooked', 'so', 'did', 'two', 'sisters', 'Now', 'three', 'are', 'obsessed', 'show', 'cliffhangers', 'almost', 'episode.However', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'box', 'change', 'so', 'much', 'season', 'continuity', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'Season', '2', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Alias - The Complete First Season
