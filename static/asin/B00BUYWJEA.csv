If you loved the first 2 seasons then you'll definitly love this one, and this is definitly a must buy when it gets released. I'm not gonna put any spoilers in my review, but Shameless continues to be a brilliantly written show and Shameless season 3 has plenty of drama, laughs, and top notch storylines. The acting from the whole cast is outstanding. There's not a bad actor in the bunch. You know how great William H Macy and Emmy Rossum are. It doesn't even need to be said at this point, but there are 2 other standouts this season imo. Jeremy Allen White as Lip and Noel Fisher as Mickey Milkovich. Noel Fisher finally becomes a regular this season and I couldn't be more happy. He completely transformers into Mickey Milkovich, and even if his content up to this point is less than most of the others he steals every scene he's in. For example, during the season finale he gets maybe 2 minutes of screentime overall, but those 2 minutes may be my favorite part of the whole finale.Some people can talk about the show's ""Shameless"" content, but this show also has more heart and soul in one episode than most shows have in their whole run. It's truly a special show. So everyone buy this on release date or pre order it now!

William Macy has always turned in stellar performances in all the movies and shows I have seen him in.  In season 3 he continues to play the most 'shameless' character you will ever meet and most of the time you will find him totally disgusting and yet you cannot turn the show off.  The other characters, Fiona, Lip, Ethan, etc. are also portrayed by an excellent cast.  If you liked seasons 1 and 2, you will throughly enjoy season 3.",5,Shameless conducts continues,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,557,"['had', 'previously', 'purchased', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'waiting', 'great', 'anticipation', 'season', '3', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'William', 'Macy', 'always', 'turned', 'stellar', 'performances', 'movies', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'season', '3', 'play', 'most', ""'shameless"", 'character', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'most', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'totally', 'disgusting', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'show', 'off', 'other', 'characters', 'Fiona', 'Lip', 'Ethan', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'cast', 'liked', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'will', 'throughly', 'enjoy', 'season', '3']",Shameless:  Season 3
