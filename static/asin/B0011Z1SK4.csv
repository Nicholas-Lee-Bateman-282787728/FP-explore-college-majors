The routine takes into consideration how the body does and does NOT bend/flex for some of us who are not a size 4 or 6.  It is nonetheless demanding in that the participant is challenged to be very deliberate in taking on poses.,4,Great for those of us with a little extra padding,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,315,"['really', 'enjoy', 'dvd', 'provided', 'nice', 'alternative', 'practicing', 'Pilates', 'routine', 'consideration', 'how', 'body', 'NOT', 'bend/flex', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'size', '4', '6', 'nonetheless', 'demanding', 'participant', 'challenged', 'be', 'very', 'deliberate', 'taking', 'poses']","Look Great, Feel Great: ""Plus Size Pilates"""

1133409,A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT,B0011Z1SK4,"Linda R. Hendrex ""Rubicon""","[50, 53]","This is supposed to be for plus sized women, but I find that it is too advanced for me.  The lady in the video is plus sized, but she is very strong.  I can't do what she does without straining my back.  I can't do these workouts every day or else I will get injured, so I alternate them with other things.The lady who is demonstrating the exercises is plus sized, but not obese.  She has a relatively flat belly that does not get in the way of the exercises and so if you have a large belly there is really no practical suggestions as to how one might adjust to allow for that.  PILATES HAS SEVERAL POSITIONS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A LARGE BELLY THAT GETS IN THE WAY.  THE EXERCISES ON THIS VIDEO DO NOT ADJUST FOR THAT AND DO NOT SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE POSITIONS.  The woman who demonstrates the exerses is also very strong and fit - so this is really standard Pilates with a larger than average woman demonstrating.  There is nothing in particular in the choreography itself to address the issues of truly overweight, injured, out of shape or otherwise physically challenged people.  If you buy this expecting to find a pre-beginner starting place for exercise then you might be disappointed and discouraged.  There are two fitness levels demonstrated and even the easiest level is a challenge for me.I checked it out of my local library before purchasing so I could determine if it is usable to me and I suggest you do the same.  It is a stretch, but if I am careful I can use it under the direction of a professional pilates teacher.  Please do not try this before hiring a qualified pilates instructor for at least 10 lessons.  It is very VERY difficult for a physically challenged person to find a beginning exercise routine that will not threaten to injure an already out of shape body and this one has the potential to do more harm than good.  THIS VIDEO IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED AN EXCEEDINGLY ELEMENTARY STARTING PLACE, NOR IS IT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO START OUT WITH NO PROFESSIONAL HELP.The advantage is that the video contains 3 complete workouts that are only 15 minutes long and are therefore good for people who are busy.  If you have time and are fit enough, you can do all three, but if you are not fit or are pressed for time, you can choose only one at a time, HOPEFULLY WITH QUALIFIED HELP.I give it only 3 stars because their definition of plus sized is too small for me and it did not address my particular problems.",3,A Little Above My Level,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2484,"['supposed', 'be', 'plus', 'sized', 'women', 'find', 'too', 'advanced', 'lady', 'video', 'sized', 'very', 'strong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'straining', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'workouts', 'day', 'else', 'will', 'get', 'injured', 'alternate', 'other', 'things.The', 'lady', 'who', 'demonstrating', 'exercises', 'plus', 'sized', 'not', 'obese', 'relatively', 'flat', 'belly', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'exercises', 'so', 'have', 'large', 'belly', 'really', 'practical', 'suggestions', 'how', 'one', 'might', 'adjust', 'allow', 'PILATES', 'HAS', 'SEVERAL', 'POSITIONS', 'THAT', 'ARE', 'PHYSICALLY', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'FOR', 'SOMEONE', 'WHO', 'A', 'LARGE', 'BELLY', 'THAT', 'GETS', 'IN', 'THE', 'WAY', 'THE', 'EXERCISES', 'ON', 'THIS', 'VIDEO', 'DO', 'NOT', 'ADJUST', 'FOR', 'THAT', 'AND', 'DO', 'NOT', 'SUGGEST', 'ALTERNATIVE', 'POSITIONS', 'woman', 'who', 'exerses', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'fit', 'so', 'really', 'standard', 'Pilates', 'larger', 'average', 'woman', 'demonstrating', 'nothing', 'particular', 'choreography', 'address', 'issues', 'truly', 'overweight', 'injured', 'shape', 'otherwise', 'physically', 'challenged', 'people', 'buy', 'expecting', 'find', 'pre-beginner', 'starting', 'place', 'exercise', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'discouraged', 'are', 'two', 'fitness', 'levels', 'demonstrated', 'even', 'easiest', 'level', 'challenge', 'me.I', 'checked', 'local', 'library', 'purchasing', 'so', 'could', 'determine', 'usable', 'suggest', 'do', 'same', 'stretch', 'am', 'careful', 'can', 'use', 'direction', 'professional', 'pilates', 'teacher', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'hiring', 'qualified', 'pilates', 'instructor', 'least', '10', 'lessons', 'very', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'physically', 'challenged', 'person', 'find', 'beginning', 'exercise', 'routine', 'will', 'not', 'threaten', 'injure', 'already', 'shape', 'body', 'one', 'potential', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'THIS', 'VIDEO', 'IS', 'NOT', 'MEANT', 'FOR', 'PEOPLE', 'WHO', 'NEED', 'AN', 'EXCEEDINGLY', 'ELEMENTARY', 'STARTING', 'PLACE', 'NOR', 'IT', 'GOOD', 'FOR', 'PEOPLE', 'WHO', 'ARE', 'TRYING', 'TO', 'START', 'OUT', 'WITH', 'NO', 'PROFESSIONAL', 'HELP.The', 'advantage', 'video', '3', 'complete', 'workouts', 'are', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'therefore', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'have', 'time', 'are', 'fit', 'enough', 'can', 'do', 'three', 'are', 'not', 'fit', 'are', 'pressed', 'time', 'can', 'choose', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'HOPEFULLY', 'WITH', 'QUALIFIED', 'HELP.I', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'definition', 'sized', 'too', 'small', 'did', 'not', 'address', 'particular', 'problems']","Look Great, Feel Great: ""Plus Size Pilates"""
