I previewed it at home prior to showing it at our Church's womens fellowship, both times I was encouraged.  When I showed the DVD the women in our group were totally engrossed in it, noone wanted me to turn it off and it has already been making the rounds as everyone is borrowing it from me.  This was the most honest discussion I have heard from Christian Women about their struggles.  It was encouraging to those of us who struggle to hold on to our virtue.  As a single mother trying to live my faith daily I was disappointed that our point of view was not discussed, to often Christians with children and living single are overlooked in books and movies about living single and saved.  However despite that one issue this was one of the best investments I have made in my DVD collection.  The frank talk and bearing of souls will help all who are open to it.

The Pastor showed it to all the single women and men of the church and truly, it was an amazing experience.  Even life altering.  SOULMATE seeks to peel back the layers of dishonesty that shroud many single Christian women and gives you a peek into their real thoughts and desires for a husband.  I found the dvd to be filled with practical solutions and each of the participants who speak, with particular mention of actress/comedian Sherri Shepard, entralled me and taught me things I never knew about myself.  There are also very uncomfortable statistics that will open your eyes to the truth of our world and, hopefully, inspire you to act differently and seek God.HOWEVER, there is one caveat that stops me from giving this dvd a full 5 stars.  SOULMATE is geared toward two groups of Christian women: single-no-kids, and married.  For those who are single WITH Children, there is precious little to guide you.  Single mothers deal with many of the same issues that married women do, except that they do it completely alone, with no help.  That isn't addressed.  But it should be.  Particularly as the statistics given state that 70% of all African-American children are born into single parent households.  It would be helpful if they'd acknowledge that with more information, in much the way Feona Huff of Solo Mommy Magazine does.  In any case, the dvd is still a must have and perfect to share with your friends who don't realize that, in searching for a husband, they are searching for something seemingly more elusive than the Loch Ness Monster.",4,"With One Caveat, This Is A Must Have!",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,1634,"['was', 'introduced', 'SOULMATE', 'dvd', 'past', 'Wednesday', 'bible', 'study', 'Pastor', 'showed', 'single', 'women', 'men', 'church', 'truly', 'was', 'amazing', 'experience', 'Even', 'life', 'altering', 'SOULMATE', 'peel', 'back', 'layers', 'dishonesty', 'shroud', 'many', 'single', 'Christian', 'women', 'peek', 'real', 'thoughts', 'desires', 'husband', 'found', 'dvd', 'be', 'filled', 'practical', 'solutions', 'participants', 'who', 'speak', 'particular', 'mention', 'actress/comedian', 'Sherri', 'Shepard', 'entralled', 'taught', 'things', 'never', 'knew', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'statistics', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'truth', 'world', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'act', 'differently', 'seek', 'God.HOWEVER', 'one', 'caveat', 'giving', 'dvd', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'SOULMATE', 'geared', 'two', 'groups', 'Christian', 'women', 'single-no-kids', 'married', 'who', 'are', 'single', 'WITH', 'Children', 'precious', 'little', 'guide', 'Single', 'mothers', 'deal', 'many', 'same', 'issues', 'married', 'women', 'do', 'do', 'completely', 'alone', 'help', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'should', 'be', 'Particularly', 'statistics', 'given', 'state', '70', '%', 'African-American', 'children', 'are', 'born', 'single', 'parent', 'households', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', ""'d"", 'acknowledge', 'more', 'information', 'much', 'way', 'Feona', 'Huff', 'Solo', 'Mommy', 'Magazine', 'case', 'dvd', 'still', 'must', 'have', 'perfect', 'share', 'friends', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'searching', 'husband', 'are', 'searching', 'something', 'seemingly', 'more', 'elusive', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster']",Soulmate

I bought this DVD knowing it wasn't a movie but based on the five star reviews I expected it to be more. The frankness from each woman may help others but I've seen that when a woman is determined, desperate, and willing to settle even the lessons learned in this DVD will not be remembered. The truth of the matter is that most of the woman who shared don't seem to realize that if they were totally surrendered to Jesus Christ, Living for Him alone, and everything is about intimacy with Him, they would be complete in Him. Being complete comes from only HIM alone, and that completeness causes you to lack NOTHING!!!!! I shook my head in agreement with everything that Bishop Ulmer said; others said words of wisdom also, but he saved the day and caused me to give this DVD three stars. I've prayed for the Lord to guide me to single women I can lend this DVD too. I believe GOD can use it for HIS glory.
