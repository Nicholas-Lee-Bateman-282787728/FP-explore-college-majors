1670006,A84UG66LK8JD9,B00F1W1S1M,Amazon Customer,"[5, 8]","So Dream Theater's Luna Park concert film has finally arrived.Mostly, it's as good as we all hoped. The band sounds great, and James LaBrie is absolutely on fire. Overall, the show is tighter if not more scripted than before - the band play to a click track while vocal harmonies are piped in to a poorly miming John Petrucci. Some will find this offensive, but really, it's for the best. Whereas James often sounded weak and thin as the sole singer on choruses of previous releases, here none of the songs feel incomplete compared to their studio components.The main feature contains almost all of the songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events, while the rest of the ADTOE songs are included as bonus features. This makes Live at Luna Park a unique and worthy installment in a series of concert films from a band who already have so many, though I can't help but feeling like there was some missed opportunity, too. ""The Root of All Evil"", ""The Test That Stumped Them All"", ""War Inside My Head"", and other songs on one or more previous DVDs are present, while other songs which have never gotten good DVD treatment are left unplayed.In what appears to be an anomaly, the Beunos Aires crowd is disappointing, and buried in the mix anyway. They can barely be heard, and they are not energetic, anyway.In another dumbfounding move, the ""wealth of extras"" promised with the first delay has also not panned-out. There's a barebones documentary here, as well as some behind the scenes stuff, but really there isn't much here you wouldn't find on a typical concert film.But overall, the main feature is what counts, and I'm happy to say that it's up there with Score and Budokan.",4,"Thrilling concert, but where are the extras?",1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,1668,"['So', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'Luna', 'Park', 'concert', 'film', 'finally', 'arrived.Mostly', 'as', 'good', 'hoped', 'band', 'great', 'James', 'LaBrie', 'absolutely', 'fire', 'Overall', 'show', 'tighter', 'not', 'more', 'scripted', 'band', 'play', 'click', 'track', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'are', 'piped', 'poorly', 'miming', 'John', 'Petrucci', 'will', 'find', 'offensive', 'really', 'best', 'Whereas', 'James', 'often', 'sounded', 'weak', 'thin', 'sole', 'singer', 'choruses', 'previous', 'releases', 'here', 'none', 'songs', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'compared', 'studio', 'components.The', 'main', 'feature', 'almost', 'songs', 'A', 'Dramatic', 'Turn', 'Events', 'rest', 'ADTOE', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'bonus', 'features', 'Live', 'Luna', 'Park', 'unique', 'worthy', 'installment', 'series', 'concert', 'films', 'band', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'too', 'Root', 'All', 'Evil', 'Test', 'Stumped', 'Them', 'All', 'War', 'Inside', 'My', 'Head', 'other', 'songs', 'one', 'more', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'are', 'present', 'other', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'good', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'are', 'left', 'unplayed.In', 'what', 'be', 'anomaly', 'Beunos', 'Aires', 'crowd', 'disappointing', 'buried', 'mix', 'anyway', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'heard', 'are', 'not', 'energetic', 'anyway.In', 'dumbfounding', 'move', 'wealth', 'extras', 'promised', 'first', 'delay', 'also', 'not', 'panned-out', 'barebones', 'documentary', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'typical', 'concert', 'film.But', 'overall', 'main', 'feature', 'what', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'up', 'there', 'Score', 'Budokan']",N/A

There have been some complaints about the sound mix.  I'll admit, it could have been better.  Not much on the low end and not as good as Budokan, but length of the footage makes up for it.  The bonus songs are also mixed in DTS-HD 5.1 and 2.0 which is nice.  I wish they had just mixed those songs into the main concert, but a minor gripe.  Video looks awesome.  It does bounce around a lot, but it's about impossible to find a concert that doesn't do that.  I would have easily paid another $5 for a better audio mix, but for the price, this is excellent.

They are not as exciting as they were in previous years and I am not quite sure why? They have a drummer in Mike Mangini that other bands would salivate for. They have the talent and ability to play and write whatever they want. They are all familiar with direction and where each other is going. So what gives?The loss of Mike Portnoy has meant 2 things.1. The spontaneous nature of the band has been lost with regards to set list's being different every night. Dream Theater in 2013 rarely deviates from the same show every night.2. The music risks seem absent.I am one of the few who believes it was time for Portnoy to walk on and someone else come in. Mike had obviously completed what he wanted to with the band and go play with 34 other bands. His personality of ADD/OCD is just too much to keep up with and it apparently didn't fit in with the other guys any longer or to his liking. The situation seems better off. The band now has 2 Grammy nominations since he has left, both records have been Top 10 records for DT on Billboard. They seem more at ease.BUT.This DVD is pretty BORING. I don't see anything that is over excited or crazy about this crowd as they advertised. It seems pretty standard to me. The musicianship is top notch and Mangini puts on one of the best solos I have seen in my life. But it comes up short this round. I eagerly await the new tour and hope they film this one as they should be more comfortable to explore and improvise more with Mike having been in the band almost 5 years by the time the tour hits the states.",3,Good But Lacks Excitement and Energy,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1600,"['Here', 'problem', 'Dream', 'Theater', '2013', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'were', 'previous', 'years', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'have', 'drummer', 'Mike', 'Mangini', 'other', 'bands', 'would', 'salivate', 'have', 'talent', 'ability', 'play', 'write', 'want', 'are', 'familiar', 'direction', 'where', 'other', 'going', 'So', 'what', 'loss', 'Mike', 'Portnoy', 'meant', '2', 'things.1', 'spontaneous', 'nature', 'band', 'been', 'lost', 'regards', 'set', 'list', 'being', 'different', 'night', 'Dream', 'Theater', '2013', 'rarely', 'same', 'show', 'night.2', 'music', 'seem', 'absent.I', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'was', 'time', 'Portnoy', 'walk', 'someone', 'else', 'come', 'Mike', 'had', 'obviously', 'completed', 'what', 'wanted', 'band', 'go', 'play', '34', 'other', 'bands', 'personality', 'ADD/OCD', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'keep', 'up', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'guys', 'longer', 'liking', 'situation', 'better', 'off', 'band', 'now', '2', 'Grammy', 'nominations', 'left', 'records', 'have', 'been', 'Top', '10', 'records', 'DT', 'Billboard', 'seem', 'more', 'ease.BUT.This', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'BORING', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'over', 'excited', 'crazy', 'crowd', 'advertised', 'pretty', 'standard', 'musicianship', 'top', 'notch', 'Mangini', 'one', 'best', 'solos', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'up', 'short', 'round', 'eagerly', 'await', 'new', 'tour', 'hope', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'explore', 'improvise', 'more', 'Mike', 'having', 'been', 'band', 'almost', '5', 'years', 'time', 'tour', 'states']",N/A

They always bring a musical majesty to their concerts that leave you blown away and always add something new to their music when they play live. So anytime they put out a live DVD/CD, it is always worthwhile to get this and enjoy what they do when they transform their songs to live versions.Live at Luna Park does a great job at bringing the concert to you on DVD and CD. For those that haven't had an opportunity to see them live, then this is the next best thing as this gives you a great selection of their music and shows off the musical prowess of each band member.

1670021,A2YOKNWS7PE0FL,B00F1W1S1M,"Kramer Drummer ""SmartListener""","[0, 3]","Not much to say about the performances, these musicians are masters of their instruments. Too bad they didn't hire people that are masters of their mixing boards and mastering projects. This seems to have been happening a lot lately, with RUSH and also Dream Theater, where the digital driven environment have been causing a great disservice to the **quality** of the audio productions of late.The mix on this production offers a sound that is thin, has no spacial depth. Part of the problem in my opinion has to do with the choice of instruments - for example, listen to the DT recordings when Rudess was still using Kurzweil keyboards instead of Korg. His sounds were more refined, 'professional' so to speak. Same goes for the drums, where everything changed. I think this is a change for the better when it comes to the drummer, Mangini is vastly superior. But his equipment is sub-par, cymbals are low quality (I wish Mike used Paiste cymbals) and his Pearl drums just don't have the same 'body' TAMA has.Add to that a mixing work that doesn't take into account dynamics and correct use of the frequency ranges produced by the instruments, and you get a thin-sounding, light, medium-frequency heavy mix that just doesn't translate correctly what this band is doing on stage (or in the studio recently). I don't know if the recording equipment in Argentina was appropriate or not, or if the sound has been captured wrong, but this work leaves a lot to be desired.The camera work doesn't bother me much, although I have seen better. Sometimes the musician shown is not the one doing the heavy work at the moment, so some passages where it would be interesting to see ""how in hell did he do that"", aren't shown.So my conclusion is yes, it's worth it to have it in the collection. But the sound quality will leave you sad.

I tried to be supportive of their new choice of musician but Portnoy is greatly missed.  That drum machine... I mean robot... I mean Mike Mangini is nothing more than a drummer reproducing sounds.  Portnoy would accent something different during every show.  If I wanted to hear the record, i would listen to it.  It's great they can replicate complex rhythms and flurry of notes but the soul is missing.  It's certainly amazing they can jerk off on there instruments, that's why I first fell in love with them, so no need to get into that.Next, The mix.  What happened?  Sure, I'm a guitarist but that's not all I listen to DT for.  It's the collective of musicians that makes the band.  Where is John Myung?!  No really, you won't be able to hear him, or even see him since he only has about 5 minutes of screen time in 3 hours.  I'm just glad other reviewers have made the same comment.Lastly, the actual film it self.  Let's just say if I were a squirrel the editing would have been amazing, but since i have an attention span it's too fast and scattered.  This is Dream Theater, not Green Day where it needs to be flashy or you'd be bored to death.  And because it is DT most fans would like to watch each musician a bit closer and for longer, especially during their respective solos or parts.  This concert is another example of Portnoy's great talent.  He was excellent in the editing process as he painstaking made sure every cut coincided with a musical theme going on.For the points that are decent.  The band, tight as ever.  The JP12, yum.  The songs from there back catalogue.  With great performances of ""Spirit Carries On"" and ""War Inside My Head/Test That Stumped"" as they loosened up a bit to play those.Definitely watch it if a fan or new comer.

Live At Budokon is a favorite amongst many, and the Blu-Ray reissue is a must-own. Chaos In Motion was often criticized for it's boot-leg picture quality, but the sound quality was the best, and it was a great document of the band's Chaos In Motion tour. For Live In Luna Park, there's a certain divide amongst fans: ones that love everything on it, and ones disappointed with the sound quality. I'm one of those that love it for what it is, and it sounds awesome. I'm not a sound engineer or musician, but I've heard enough recordings, and my ears can hear certain elements in the music. All I can say is try both audio tracks. I never really find the DTS track to my liking for concerts, I usually go with stereo. As far as the tracklisting: like other Dream Theater concerts, it's expansive. For this one, it's not quite career-spanning as they don't cover every album, but it's long enough that you won't really care enough to be bothered by that. Everything on the Blu-Ray disc totals at about 300 minutes, while the main concert alone is about 2 hours and 40 minutes, and that doesn't include the six bonus songs.

Saw them play at Jaxx bar in Springfield, VA to a couple hundred people, and then again for SFAM tour, which was fantastic. Anyway, suffice to say, I've seen the band grow and I've been able to appreciate all the style changes. I like DT....a lot! So why not 5 stars? Like I said, us fans can be picky! Bottom line, this one doesn't stack up to Budokan, either visually or sonically. I'm going to rate Score better too. In fact, I even liked Metropolis 2000 better, even though it's SD, 4:3 and stereo only. What??? Does that mean this is a bad Blu-ray? Not at all, but it's missing something. The picture is HD, had sweeping camera work, but it felt static and dry. The sound is a problem too. The surround mix is really bad. For me the best sound combination was to choose the stereo track and then process it through my receiver's THX Cinema mode, which made for a much better sound stage. Even then, the bass and keys were really low in the mix. HINT: Don't let Petrucci mix the sound! LaBrie's vocals are often spotty live, as I feel he pushes himself too hard live. And that's the case here a few times, but overall his performance was good. I can't say that Mangini's interpretations of Portnoy's work was spectacular, but it was fine. He really shined on the songs he recorded on though and his solo was amazing! Everyone one else was great too, which is no surprise. A couple other things about the release that bother me are that 6 of the songs are in the bonus section and they were clearly part of the show, so I'm not sure why they weren't just included in the main program. Also, you can't play all of the bonus songs together, you have to choose each track individually. OK, that being said, this is a good show overall, despite my criticisms and probably belongs in any DT fan's collection.

First thing that strikes me when I put the Blu-Ray on was the crystal clear picture quality. The sound is also clear, but the mix could have been better for John Myung and Jordan Rudess instruments, who are buried in the mix. Let say that the camera don't focus very often on John Myung. The surround mix is mostly for ambiance and for the James Labrie's vocals.The set list contains many songs from ""A Dramatic Turn of Events"", that is not one of my favorites CD of the band. Those songs have been spread out in the main feature with 2 hours and forty minutes and as a bonus of 6 more songs. Usually I don't enjoy a drum solo, even those of Neil Peart, but here, I found that Mangini did something that captivate me, go figure what it is! James Labrie's vocals are clear and strong and he was very generous and emotional on his compliments about Jordan and John Petrucci, when it was time to both of them to do their solos. Again John Myung was left out as it is in many bands, who want hear a bass solo?I am pretty sure that plenty will enjoy this DVD, especially if you enjoy most of the Dream Theater's CDS, including the latest one, but to me, I think that the band is starting to repeat themselves. The similarity of some song structures in their latest CDs is too obvious that you could think that their best day are something from the past.

John P was overpowering and Jordy and John M were sometimes almost inaudible with Mike's mix coming in on the weak side.

None.  Mike was the right choice for the band when M. Portnoy opted out of the band. He's missed as a member of the band, but the band with M. Mangini still rocks and plays brillinatly with their brand of Progressive Metal.This is my third DT video and I have to say that the band has brought it to the stage each time.  This crowd truly loved the band and DT loved them back.  All 5 members did what they do best...play.Don't hesitate if you're hesitating to buy this. This is a band still getting better as writers and as musicians and as performers.",5,Dream Theater getting better,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,678,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'out', 'addressing', 'elephant', 'room', 'Mike', 'Portnoy', 'gone', 'Mike', 'Mangini', 'kit', 'Difference', 'None', 'Mike', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'band', 'when', 'M.', 'Portnoy', 'opted', 'band', 'missed', 'member', 'band', 'band', 'M.', 'Mangini', 'still', 'brillinatly', 'brand', 'Progressive', 'Metal.This', 'third', 'DT', 'video', 'have', 'say', 'band', 'brought', 'stage', 'time', 'crowd', 'truly', 'loved', 'band', 'DT', 'loved', 'back', '5', 'members', 'did', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'play.Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', ""'re"", 'hesitating', 'buy', 'band', 'still', 'getting', 'better', 'writers', 'musicians', 'performers']",N/A
