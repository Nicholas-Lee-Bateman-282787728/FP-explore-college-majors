I do not agree that you can get any practical benefit by shortening routine; you need to do it in a daily basis, the best way I can describe is after a while, you will feel that if you skip a day's practice, you will physically feel bad, I think the benefit for me personally is I start to develop deep breathing habit, and I am more relaxed now compare with before the practice.9/1/2012I think I get it now after a year's practice, it really boil down to breathing and how you really not aware of yourself doing it. Every gesture you practice does have a start and ending position, how to totally merge the movement with your breathing in the exercise is the hardest thing to learn, I started by breathing heavily and ending up with rushing through the practice, I am calmer now, also with practice, I have more control of the Qi. I am not saying I become an expert in this, I just realize there is more you need to practice and you really need to focus more onto your inner self when you are doing it.2/22/2012I am still doing it... the benefit I get from continue doing is I feel relaxed after each practice. I also feel my body lighter after each practice.9/11/2013Still practice it, I can now close my eyes and focus on the smoothness of the movement and breath accordingly, the benefits I get from practicing is immediate. Although it took me more than a year to realize this.1/9/2014I can say without any reservations after almost two years, this is a good DVD, and it helps me a lot both physically and mentally. Still doing it and highly recommended.",5,Great way to excercise your mind,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2497,"['practice', 'surface', 'very', 'simple', 'extremely', 'easy', 'learn', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'real', 'benefit', 'practice', 'least', 'point', 'can', 'remember', 'how', 'breathe', 'exercise', 'other', 'words', 'remember', 'exercise', 'can', 'forget', 'how', 'do', 'concentrate', 'breathing', 'then', 'real', 'benefit', 'starts.I', 'consider', 'still', 'early', 'learner', 'stage', 'bought', 'sound', 'recorder', 'recorded', 'Lee', 'instructions', 'carry', 'when', 'practice', 'AM-PM', 'work', 'out', 'remember', 'routines', 'also', 'concentrate', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'here', 'Qi', 'breathing', 'exercise.I', 'find', 'DVD', 'easy', 'understand', 'practical', 'first', 'step', 'self-enlightenment', 'self-help', 'health.Very', 'good', 'introduction', 'practical', 'excersie', 'guidance', 'Qi', 'workout.7/5/2012I', 'started', 'feel', 'benefits', 'continue', 'practice', 'almost', 'year', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'can', 'get', 'practical', 'benefit', 'shortening', 'routine', 'need', 'do', 'daily', 'basis', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'while', 'will', 'feel', 'skip', 'day', 'practice', 'will', 'physically', 'feel', 'bad', 'think', 'benefit', 'personally', 'start', 'develop', 'deep', 'breathing', 'habit', 'am', 'more', 'relaxed', 'now', 'compare', 'practice.9/1/2012I', 'think', 'get', 'now', 'year', 'practice', 'really', 'boil', 'down', 'breathing', 'how', 'really', 'not', 'aware', 'doing', 'gesture', 'practice', 'have', 'start', 'ending', 'position', 'how', 'totally', 'merge', 'movement', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'hardest', 'thing', 'learn', 'started', 'breathing', 'heavily', 'ending', 'up', 'rushing', 'practice', 'am', 'calmer', 'now', 'also', 'practice', 'have', 'more', 'control', 'Qi', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'become', 'expert', 'just', 'realize', 'more', 'need', 'practice', 'really', 'need', 'focus', 'more', 'inner', 'self', 'when', 'are', 'doing', 'it.2/22/2012I', 'am', 'still', 'doing', 'benefit', 'get', 'continue', 'doing', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'practice', 'also', 'feel', 'body', 'lighter', 'practice.9/11/2013Still', 'practice', 'can', 'now', 'close', 'eyes', 'focus', 'smoothness', 'movement', 'breath', 'accordingly', 'benefits', 'get', 'practicing', 'immediate', 'took', 'more', 'year', 'realize', 'this.1/9/2014I', 'can', 'say', 'reservations', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'good', 'DVD', 'lot', 'physically', 'mentally', 'Still', 'doing', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1348068,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B003KO1JR6,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[9, 11]","NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review and more.In this DVD, instructor Lee Holden offers two 40-minute Qi Gong practices intended for use in the morning and in the evening.  The exercises in these workouts are designed to release qi (energy) in the body and thus to produce both increased energy and decreased stress.The Main Menu of the DVD offers the options of Play All -- AM Workout -- PM Workout -- Behind the Scenes.  For both workouts, Holden is featured alone in an indoor studio, exercising barefoot and teaching via voiceover.  Sometimes Holden provides names for the exercise, with the names appearing on screen, sometimes not.  No props are necessary for these workouts, which I have described in greater detail below.AM WORKOUT (42 minutes)In his Introduction, Holden states that the purpose of this all-standing practice is to start the day with energy as well as to calm the mind.  He also notes that the exercises include build a calm foundation and increase power and strength in the lower body.  Holden begins with about 7-8 minutes of focus on the breath; this section includes Knocking on the Doors of Heaven.  The first flowing stretch is Moon Over Lake; continued flowing stretches center more on the lower body.  Holden also incorporates self-massage, first by rubbing and tapping the palms and later by incorporating larger areas of the body.  Other flowing movements include Fountain and Fireworks.  This practice ends with Embracing the Tree, Centering, and gently rocking and swaying to feel the qi throughout the body.PM WORKOUT (41.5 minutes)In his short Introduction to this practice, Holden explains that this routine is intended to help end the day free from stress and to prepare the body for sleep.  To do this, the practice starts with deep breathing, moves into deeper stretches, and then continues with mindful flowing movements.  As promised, Holden starts the routine with deep breaths and spinal breathing, allowing this breathwork to move through the entire body.  Water Waves continues the gentle opening, but then Holden begins the stretching with Dog Wagging the Body (a side stretch), neck circles, and wrist circles.  He performs both massage and tapping on the hamstrings and calves from a standing forward bend position and then rises up for a long sequence of neck stretches.  At this point, Holden moves into more flowing movements to gather qi, starting with a series of wave flows and continuing with several variations of swimming dragon.  After shaking out the body, Holden performs another flow with sounding (""haa"") and then continues the upper body qi flows, ending with Pushing the Clouds, Baby Bird Learning to Fly, and Pulling Down the Sky.  He concludes with one additional sounding move (""hee"") to foster a good night's sleep and then ends the practice with Centering and Bamboo in the Wind.I have previously used some of the Qi Gong workouts in Holden's ""Exercise to Heal"" collection, but I found him a bit more difficult to follow in these practices.  Although he mirror cues, his cuing was not always in sync with his on screen demonstration.  Furthermore, I would have appreciated more detail about how to perform some of the movements--instead, I frequently found myself straining to look at the screen in a vain attempt to copy the unfamiliar exercises.  Finally, although I liked the idea of having practices designed for morning and night, the 40-minute length seemed too long for this purpose.  I did prefer the PM practice, as I found the more intense stretches in the first half of that routine to be more relaxing.This DVD might work best for those who are pre-existing Lee Holden fans and/or those who use Qi Gong for their primary source of exercise.  I believe that others might be somewhat disappointed for the reasons I have noted above.",3,"Practices feel a bit long as morning/evening routines, but Holden fans may enjoy the longer length",1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,3940,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online', 'Reviews', 'please', 'see', 'site', 'more', 'detailed', 'version', 'review', 'more.In', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Lee', 'Holden', 'two', '40-minute', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'practices', 'intended', 'use', 'morning', 'evening', 'exercises', 'workouts', 'are', 'designed', 'release', 'qi', 'energy', 'body', 'thus', 'produce', 'increased', 'energy', 'decreased', 'stress.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'options', 'Play', 'All', 'AM', 'Workout', 'PM', 'Workout', 'Scenes', 'workouts', 'Holden', 'featured', 'alone', 'indoor', 'studio', 'exercising', 'barefoot', 'teaching', 'voiceover', 'Sometimes', 'Holden', 'names', 'exercise', 'names', 'appearing', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'not', 'props', 'are', 'necessary', 'workouts', 'have', 'described', 'greater', 'detail', 'below.AM', 'WORKOUT', '42', 'minutes', 'Introduction', 'Holden', 'purpose', 'all-standing', 'practice', 'start', 'day', 'energy', 'as', 'well', 'calm', 'mind', 'also', 'exercises', 'include', 'build', 'calm', 'foundation', 'increase', 'power', 'strength', 'lower', 'body', 'Holden', '7-8', 'minutes', 'focus', 'breath', 'section', 'Knocking', 'Doors', 'Heaven', 'first', 'flowing', 'stretch', 'Moon', 'Over', 'Lake', 'continued', 'flowing', 'stretches', 'center', 'more', 'lower', 'body', 'Holden', 'also', 'self-massage', 'first', 'rubbing', 'tapping', 'palms', 'later', 'incorporating', 'larger', 'areas', 'body', 'Other', 'flowing', 'movements', 'include', 'Fountain', 'Fireworks', 'practice', 'Embracing', 'Tree', 'Centering', 'gently', 'rocking', 'swaying', 'feel', 'qi', 'body.PM', 'WORKOUT', '41.5', 'minutes', 'short', 'Introduction', 'practice', 'Holden', 'routine', 'intended', 'help', 'end', 'day', 'free', 'stress', 'prepare', 'body', 'sleep', 'do', 'practice', 'deep', 'breathing', 'moves', 'deeper', 'stretches', 'then', 'mindful', 'flowing', 'movements', 'promised', 'Holden', 'routine', 'deep', 'breaths', 'spinal', 'breathing', 'allowing', 'breathwork', 'move', 'entire', 'body', 'Water', 'gentle', 'opening', 'then', 'Holden', 'stretching', 'Dog', 'Wagging', 'Body', 'side', 'stretch', 'neck', 'circles', 'wrist', 'circles', 'massage', 'tapping', 'hamstrings', 'calves', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'position', 'then', 'up', 'long', 'sequence', 'neck', 'stretches', 'point', 'Holden', 'more', 'flowing', 'movements', 'gather', 'qi', 'starting', 'series', 'wave', 'flows', 'continuing', 'several', 'variations', 'swimming', 'dragon', 'shaking', 'out', 'body', 'Holden', 'flow', 'sounding', 'haa', 'then', 'upper', 'body', 'qi', 'ending', 'Pushing', 'Clouds', 'Baby', 'Bird', 'Learning', 'Fly', 'Pulling', 'Down', 'Sky', 'one', 'additional', 'sounding', 'move', 'hee', 'foster', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'then', 'practice', 'Centering', 'Bamboo', 'Wind.I', 'have', 'previously', 'used', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'workouts', 'Holden', 'Exercise', 'Heal', 'collection', 'found', 'bit', 'more', 'difficult', 'follow', 'practices', 'cues', 'cuing', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'sync', 'screen', 'demonstration', 'Furthermore', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'more', 'detail', 'how', 'perform', 'movements', 'instead', 'frequently', 'found', 'straining', 'look', 'screen', 'vain', 'attempt', 'copy', 'unfamiliar', 'exercises', 'Finally', 'liked', 'idea', 'having', 'practices', 'designed', 'morning', 'night', '40-minute', 'length', 'seemed', 'too', 'long', 'purpose', 'did', 'prefer', 'PM', 'practice', 'found', 'more', 'intense', 'stretches', 'first', 'half', 'routine', 'be', 'more', 'relaxing.This', 'DVD', 'might', 'work', 'best', 'who', 'are', 'pre-existing', 'Lee', 'Holden', 'fans', 'and/or', 'who', 'use', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'primary', 'source', 'exercise', 'believe', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'reasons', 'have', 'noted']",N/A

If you want to move and build Qi, increase mobility and flexibility and improve the quality of your life then  this is for you.
