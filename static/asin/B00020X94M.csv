820766,A28ZDT16XR5DPC,B00020X94M,Alan92RTTT,"[9, 10]","For Christmas I wanted to get my wife some videos on how to knit. She's always said she wanted to get better. I purchased this video in a Amazon pair with Loriknits: Beyond Purl.My wife watched this video last night. I'm not a knitter so my review is based on my wife's comments (she's not a computer person so she's never do this herself).The video is broken into several segments the first two are instructional and the rest basically fluff.The first two segments are instructional. Each runs about 10 minutes long. The first looked like they setup a camera in the teacher's basement. The sound was not clear and video quality was what I'd expect from a home video. The instruction was ok but even I could see it was very basic. The second segment was better good sound quality and clear video. Again it was a very basic instruction and a rehash of the material from the first segment.  This was the best segment of the video. If this teacher did a full DVD it would probably be a worthwhile purchase.The rest of this video is filled with topics like learning how to yard is dyed, start a knitting group, the ZEN of knitting. This material is not instructional at all. It's the kind of material I'd expect to find in a documentary about the knitting community. It's not what I'd expect from a DVD on ""how to knit"".My wife was very disappointed with this purchase and I'm disappointed that she was unable to enjoy her Christmas gift.She's going to watch Beyond Purl this weekend. I hope that goes better.",1,Its too bad I can not give 0 stars.,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1505,"['Christmas', 'wanted', 'get', 'wife', 'videos', 'how', 'knit', 'always', 'said', 'wanted', 'get', 'better', 'purchased', 'video', 'Amazon', 'pair', 'Loriknits', 'Beyond', 'Purl.My', 'wife', 'watched', 'video', 'last', 'night', ""'m"", 'not', 'knitter', 'review', 'based', 'wife', 'comments', 'not', 'computer', 'person', 'never', 'do', 'herself', '.The', 'video', 'broken', 'several', 'segments', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'instructional', 'rest', 'basically', 'fluff.The', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'are', 'instructional', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'first', 'looked', 'setup', 'camera', 'teacher', 'basement', 'sound', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'home', 'video', 'instruction', 'was', 'ok', 'even', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'basic', 'second', 'segment', 'was', 'better', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'clear', 'video', 'Again', 'was', 'very', 'basic', 'instruction', 'rehash', 'material', 'first', 'segment', 'was', 'best', 'segment', 'video', 'teacher', 'did', 'full', 'DVD', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'purchase.The', 'rest', 'video', 'filled', 'topics', 'learning', 'how', 'yard', 'dyed', 'start', 'knitting', 'group', 'ZEN', 'knitting', 'material', 'not', 'instructional', 'kind', 'material', ""'d"", 'expect', 'find', 'documentary', 'knitting', 'community', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'DVD', 'how', 'knit', '.My', 'wife', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'unable', 'enjoy', 'Christmas', 'gift.She', 'going', 'watch', 'Beyond', 'Purl', 'weekend', 'hope', 'better']",The Art of Knitting: Stitches * Colors * Fashion

I had no idea how packed with information and ideas ""Art of Knitting"" is.The first five minutes paid for the effort. And I had no idea that it would go on for hours and hours. You need to have plenty of coffee ready and forget about doing any thing else the day you start to watch this DVD.It is organized like an animated magazine with articles and sub-articles to those. Each is well titled and gives further reading or viewing references. Like a magazine not everyone will be interested in every section; yet you can always fine something and much is serendipity.Not everything is physically knitting yet they go trough all types of knitting forms. There is a quick section on the difference in holding thread as in American vs. Continental. If you ever watch any Agatha Christy miss Marple movies with Joan Hickson then you get a good dose of Continental or European knitting methods.Everyone knows that the process of knitting is just mechanical; you can do most while watching TV or holding a conversation. But what to knit, what looks good, and what works well as clothing, accessories or art is an other matter. We even get a crash course in color psychology.If I covered everything on this DVD it would take a book. And this is just one of a series.It is safe to say this is one of the best investments you could make.The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting",5,I had no idea!,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,1463,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'thought', 'might', 'see', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'different', 'angle', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'packed', 'information', 'ideas', 'Art', 'Knitting', 'is.The', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'paid', 'effort', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'go', 'hours', 'hours', 'need', 'have', 'plenty', 'coffee', 'ready', 'forget', 'doing', 'thing', 'else', 'day', 'start', 'watch', 'DVD.It', 'organized', 'animated', 'magazine', 'articles', 'sub-articles', 'well', 'titled', 'further', 'reading', 'viewing', 'references', 'magazine', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'section', 'can', 'always', 'fine', 'something', 'much', 'serendipity.Not', 'everything', 'physically', 'knitting', 'yet', 'go', 'types', 'knitting', 'forms', 'quick', 'section', 'difference', 'holding', 'thread', 'American', 'Continental', 'ever', 'watch', 'Agatha', 'Christy', 'miss', 'Marple', 'movies', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'then', 'get', 'good', 'dose', 'Continental', 'European', 'knitting', 'methods.Everyone', 'process', 'knitting', 'just', 'mechanical', 'can', 'do', 'most', 'watching', 'TV', 'holding', 'conversation', 'what', 'knit', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'well', 'clothing', 'accessories', 'art', 'other', 'matter', 'even', 'get', 'crash', 'course', 'color', 'psychology.If', 'covered', 'everything', 'DVD', 'would', 'take', 'book', 'just', 'one', 'series.It', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'investments', 'could', 'make.The', 'Complete', 'Beginner', 'Guide', 'Knitting']",The Art of Knitting: Stitches * Colors * Fashion

A few minutes after popping in the DVD I was on my way to knitting my first hat.  The Knitting Library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection  to knit by was wonderful.  This DVD is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike.  If you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then I would highly reccmmend this DVD because the knitting lessons with Jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor.
