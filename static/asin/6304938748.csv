440654,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304938748,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","Sure, `Krippendorf's Tribe' is fun, to an extent, but it's not really as funny as it could be and in the end it is not really as enjoyable as it could be.  I found some pleasure in it, but it was limited and for the most part it relied on a more slapstick approach to its humor to get laughs, and I prefer a more intellectual approach (I know, this is not an intellectual movie but still, it could have been a little smarter).The film tells the story of anthropologist Professor James Krippendorf who had received a grant, along with his wife, to find an unknown tribe out in New Guinea.  When his wife died unexpectedly James crashed emotionally and exhausted the money from the grant doing absolutely nothing productive and so, in fear that he'll be sent to prison for abusing the terms of the grant he creates a fictitious tribe.  His one little (or not so little) lie spirals out of control and creates a worldwide phenomenon (especially since the tribe is unlike anything anyone has ever heard of) and he finds himself documenting footage of this tribe with his children in his very backyard.  An overzealous Professor, Veronica, causes more complications in James keeping his lie a secret, and his eldest daughter's disgust for what her father has been reduced to also starts to weight heavy on James' decisions.The problem with `Krippendorf's Tribe' lies in a few areas.  First, the concept, while promising, is not executed as well as it could have been.  It's not believable.  Sure, it's an outlandish comedy that doesn't have to be probable, but it still should be believable.  The fact that no one recognized that the tribe's people were being played by Krippendorf and his children is ridiculous since the makeup didn't hide anything really.  The fact that Veronica recognized herself on the video but the rest of the known world did not is also ridiculous.  I know that it seems like a little thing to pick at, but it really reduces the entire films legitimacy.  You want to be able to believe that someone could pull this off, but instead all it proves is that the people around Krippendorf were really, really stupid.The film also makes it a point to go as far as they can (within the boundaries of its rating) to keep the jokes off-color, which is a shame since it shows the films lack of depth.  It's not smart enough to come up with anything but the expected toilet humor.The acting is decent.  Richard Dreyfuss pulls his comedy off better than in `What About Bob?' but there is no Bill Murray to elevate the films mediocrity.  Jenna Elfman is not a good actress and she kind of just floats here, playing a ditzy admirer as best she can.  Really, the only highlight to the film is Lily Tomlin who is always funny, even when her material is not.  She kept me entertained, and she was really the only reason I watched the entire film.  The film can thank Tomlin for aiding it to a two star (high D) and not a one star rating.",2,This tribe is a little too predictable...,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2941,"['Sure', 'Krippendorf', 'Tribe', 'fun', 'extent', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'funny', 'could', 'be', 'end', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'pleasure', 'was', 'limited', 'most', 'part', 'relied', 'more', 'slapstick', 'approach', 'humor', 'get', 'laughs', 'prefer', 'more', 'intellectual', 'approach', 'know', 'not', 'intellectual', 'movie', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'smarter', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'anthropologist', 'Professor', 'James', 'Krippendorf', 'who', 'had', 'received', 'grant', 'wife', 'find', 'unknown', 'tribe', 'out', 'New', 'Guinea', 'When', 'wife', 'died', 'unexpectedly', 'James', 'crashed', 'emotionally', 'exhausted', 'money', 'grant', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'productive', 'so', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'abusing', 'terms', 'grant', 'fictitious', 'tribe', 'one', 'little', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'lie', 'spirals', 'control', 'worldwide', 'phenomenon', 'especially', 'tribe', 'anything', 'anyone', 'ever', 'heard', 'documenting', 'footage', 'tribe', 'children', 'very', 'backyard', 'overzealous', 'Professor', 'Veronica', 'more', 'complications', 'James', 'keeping', 'lie', 'secret', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'disgust', 'what', 'father', 'been', 'reduced', 'also', 'weight', 'heavy', 'James', 'decisions.The', 'problem', 'Krippendorf', 'Tribe', 'lies', 'few', 'areas', 'First', 'concept', 'promising', 'not', 'executed', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'believable', 'Sure', 'outlandish', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'probable', 'still', 'should', 'be', 'believable', 'fact', 'one', 'recognized', 'tribe', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'played', 'Krippendorf', 'children', 'ridiculous', 'makeup', 'did', ""n't"", 'hide', 'anything', 'really', 'fact', 'Veronica', 'recognized', 'video', 'rest', 'known', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'know', 'little', 'thing', 'pick', 'really', 'entire', 'films', 'legitimacy', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'believe', 'someone', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'instead', 'people', 'Krippendorf', 'were', 'really', 'really', 'stupid.The', 'film', 'also', 'point', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'boundaries', 'rating', 'keep', 'jokes', 'off-color', 'shame', 'films', 'lack', 'depth', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'expected', 'toilet', 'humor.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'comedy', 'better', 'What', 'Bob', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'elevate', 'films', 'mediocrity', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'kind', 'just', 'floats', 'here', 'playing', 'ditzy', 'admirer', 'can', 'Really', 'only', 'highlight', 'film', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'who', 'always', 'funny', 'even', 'when', 'material', 'not', 'kept', 'entertained', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'thank', 'Tomlin', 'aiding', 'two', 'star', 'high', 'D', 'not', 'one', 'star', 'rating']",Krippendorf's Tribe VHS

Down in depression he ends up using the universities grant money for his own personal use. Faced with either confessing and going to jail, or going on with his fairy tale tribe. He chooses to go on with his made up tribe the Shelmikedmu. Using his own 3 kids and back yard for filming. He comes up with the most unique tribe ever seen before. Also with the help of his over anxious colleague Veronica Macelli(Jenna Elfman) who wont leave him alone. He ends up going deeper and deeper into his fairytale tribe, and trying to keep up with his lie. They end up taking the tribe national. But there is one of his colleagues Ruth Allen that just isn't swallowing all this Shelmikedmu stuff. So she decides to go to New Guinea and prove that it's all a scam. Even Krippendorf goes so far he ends up going in person and on national tv as the Cheif Utta Baji.This movie is very well put together, and just so ridiculous you got to laugh.

However, the borderline between fantasy and reality needed to be recognized by the producers.  Despite, faking eyecatching ""Shelmikedmu"" rituals to gain national recognition is clever.  Such scenes lead the audience to a surprising conclusion.  Lily Tomlin plays the funny role that viewers either love or hate.  Some of Jenna Elfman's lines were underreacted, but when she shines, she shines bright.  Notice rising star Gregory Smith, the middle child.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE (1998) is best described in one sentence: a washed-up anthropology professor invents a New Guinea tribe in order not to be prosecuted for stealing grant money. If that sounds like a thrill of a comedy, then I say go for it.Richard Dreyfus as Prof. Krippendorf made what hay he could; Jenna Elfman as his partner in crime, Veronica, is quite funny. The film has its hilarious moments, yet I recall when I saw this new. We found it irritating and stupid. Perhaps that was the point - I really don't know. All I know is the thing has become a 2nd-banana favorite for some weird reason.Maybe it's Dreyfus; maybe it's because it is one of the few films that has anthropology at its roots. Lily Tomlin as Krippendorf's mortal enemy Professor Ruth Allen is quite brilliant, though she is oddly cut out of most of the film's action. This was one of the last films in which Tomlin had a chance to really shine - and the same goes for Dreyfus. David Ogden Stiers plays Henry Spivey, head cheese of a Discovery-like channel about anthropology and he actually shines in the few minutes of screen time he gets here.There is a story and it is a touching one; there is comedy both cheap and sophisticated (I counted about 18 anthropology jokes which could have served the purpose, and which this film totally missed). The cast is far from stellar even with Dreyfus, Tomlin and Stiers at the helm.

The depiction of native New Guinean tribes is utterly fake, silly and Hollywoodized and, frankly, treats native peoples in an offensively stupid manner.  The contrived comedic situations are almost never funny.  I chuckled once or twice, but most of the time stared in disbelief at the poor taste and childishness of it all.  This in spite of the fact that it has two very skilled actors.  Which proves a timeless truth -- actors and their agents are almost always terrible judges of both scripts and directing.  Unless you suffer from the same flaw, you will not enjoy this movie.",1,One of the 10 worst movies ever made.,1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,960,"['premise', 'movie', 'involving', 'hairbrained', 'anthropology', 'professor', 'lusty', 'grad', 'student', 'misappropriated', 'grant', 'funds', 'completely', 'invented', 'tribe', 'New', 'Guineans', 'clever', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'pardon', 'what', ""'m"", 'say', 'up', 'good', 'idea', 'screen', 'plot', 'directing', 'completely', 'implausible', 'start', 'finish', 'depiction', 'native', 'New', 'Guinean', 'tribes', 'utterly', 'fake', 'silly', 'Hollywoodized', 'frankly', 'treats', 'native', 'peoples', 'offensively', 'stupid', 'manner', 'contrived', 'comedic', 'situations', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'funny', 'chuckled', 'once', 'twice', 'most', 'time', 'stared', 'disbelief', 'poor', 'taste', 'childishness', 'spite', 'fact', 'two', 'very', 'skilled', 'actors', 'Which', 'timeless', 'truth', 'actors', 'agents', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'terrible', 'judges', 'scripts', 'directing', 'suffer', 'same', 'flaw', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Krippendorf's Tribe VHS
