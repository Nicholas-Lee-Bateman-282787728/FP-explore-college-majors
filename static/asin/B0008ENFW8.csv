A theater doing ""Cyrano"" is a bit more of a challenge than I would be willing to face in my personal life, but if offers plenty of surprises for a guy who always seems to read like he is reading. There is such a difference between the printed word and what goes on on stage, and hardly anyone can believe than an outsider to the whole culture of theater will pick it all up by opening night. Sean Austin and Patty Duke were the only names I recognized at the beginning. By the end of the film, I was only sure of 7 characters' names for the cast list, but by going back to the beginning of the story, it was easy to fill in my number 8, a boss at work who prizes team efforts.Our society pays people to work, but it is not very clear about what is going to happen to those who quit to take part in things that happen in their hearts. At some point, another job might come along, but the chaos that is possible for people who really don't know what to expect probably deserves to be a much larger part of our culture, because that seems to be the direction we keep heading in spite of any attempts to smooth things out.",4,worth seeing,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,1186,"['enjoyed', 'contrast', 'corporate', 'life', 'entertainment', 'values', 'theater', 'doing', 'Cyrano', 'bit', 'more', 'challenge', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'face', 'personal', 'life', 'offers', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'read', 'reading', 'such', 'difference', 'printed', 'word', 'what', 'stage', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'can', 'believe', 'outsider', 'whole', 'culture', 'theater', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'opening', 'night', 'Sean', 'Austin', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'were', 'only', 'names', 'recognized', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'sure', '7', 'characters', 'names', 'cast', 'list', 'going', 'back', 'beginning', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'fill', 'number', '8', 'boss', 'work', 'who', 'team', 'efforts.Our', 'society', 'people', 'work', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'who', 'quit', 'take', 'part', 'things', 'happen', 'hearts', 'point', 'job', 'might', 'come', 'along', 'chaos', 'possible', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'probably', 'be', 'much', 'larger', 'part', 'culture', 'be', 'direction', 'keep', 'heading', 'spite', 'attempts', 'smooth', 'things', 'out']",Bigger Than the Sky VHS

898486,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0008ENFW8,Grady Harp,"[15, 15]","BIGGER THAN THE SKY has the feel of an Indie that was made out of a lot of love and commitment from all concerned.  That's a good thing, but at the beginning of this little film the viewer  questions whether or not the actors can make the story fly - and if you actually want to take the trip with them. But stick it out because a sound film well made rewards the hesitation. It is a 'little man finds his way' tale that makes good sense and provides good entertainment.Peter Rooker (Marcus Thomas) is in a depressed slump after his girlfriend has dumped him.  He is a 'cellophane man' computer artist, living the solitary life, noticed by no one, longing for a feeling of belonging.  The place is Portland, Oregon.  Peter notes the posting of auditions for a Portland Community Theater production of 'Cyrano de Bergerac' and slowly decides to attempt a moment of belonging by auditioning for the play: if he could just land a small part at least he'd belong.At the auditions he meets the warmly friendly theatrical group: Michael (John Corbett) who is a fine actor with no sense of future, Grace (Amy Smart) a pretty young sprite and competent trouper, director Edwina (Clare Higgins) who is a true theater person preferring to unmask the real Cyrano rather than hide him behind the infamous nose, sassy costumer Mrs. Keene (Patty Duke), and theater founder and advisor Kippy (Alan Corduner) who has retired from the theater due to his progressive cancer.To everyone's surprise, especially Peter's, Peter lands the title role of Cyrano while Michael becomes Christian and Grace becomes Roxanne.  Edwina's faith in the audition honesty of Peter has bolstered her own commitment to her dreams and she works with the cast to mold this very inexperienced (read lousy) actor into the tough role of Cyrano.  Peter finds joy in the camaraderie of the actors, and for the first time in his life he becomes a social person.  As the play is rehearsed Peter and Michael and Grace become a misguided trio - Peter does not understand the promiscuous life of the actors - and when Peter loses his job because of his increased involvement in the theater, he is informed that Edwina is forced to replace him with a seasoned actor Ken Zorbell (Sean Astin) at the 13th hour.As good comedies go there are unexpected turns of events at every level of the remaining time until the opening night and the ending results in the personal growth of each of the actors and company.  There are some well-drawn performances from John Corbett, Amy Smart, Clare Higgins, Patty Duke (in two roles), Alan Corduner, and ultimately Marcus Taylor (he is so convincingly an untrained actor at the beginning of the film that the audience will think he is wholly without talent!).  Director Al Corley keeps the community theater magic alive and Rodney Patrick Vaccaro's script is sparkled by incidental quotes from Rostand's play. And to sum up the final product of the film in Cyrano's word, it has 'panache'.  Not a great film, but a warm little story that examines the lonely lives of people who need the stage of a community theater to find themselves.

898488,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0008ENFW8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","""Bigger Than The Sky"" is a small, relatively inconsequential film about a regular guy discovering himself in the community theater milieu.  A slight comedy, a slight romance, and an even slighter drama--this film is almost too nice for its own good.  But with some colorful performances, this pleasant little endeavor seems to be a labor of love for those involved.  And it's in this spirit that you actually get caught up in this ""Sky.""There is a real innocence, a sweetness almost, about ""Bigger than The Sky.""  Portland, as portrayed here, has a small town quaintness that I question.  Marcus Thomas, in the lead, layers on the ""aw-shucks"" earnestness a bit much for my taste--but overall turns in a competent performance.  I'd have preferred more texture in his character, though, I don't feel that we see too much beyond the surface.  He needed to be developed a little further to create more of an impact with this tale.  We never hear his backstory or learn anything about his broken relationship that triggers this radical new life.  He even, at one point, leaves his job--but it's never mentioned again and I was interested in the repercussions to this.The other cast members are appealing.  John Corbett is playful and interesting as Portland's premiere community theater actor.  Amy Smart, often better than she is given credit for, is a realistic romantic interest for both guys.  Patty Duke, Claire Higgins, and Alan Corduner are all believable and add much charm to the story.  Only Sean Astin seems out of place.  In a blustery performance (I get it, he is insufferable), toning things down would have enhanced the film immeasurably.Overall, ""Bigger"" was a pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed it as is--but with some tweaking, it could have been quite a treat.  It's a fun diversion, however.  If you have an interest in theater, especially, you should check this out.  I'd rate it at about 3 1/2 stars which I'm rounding down because it would have been easy with this crew to make a much more substantial film.

898490,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0008ENFW8,Lee Armstrong,"[10, 14]","Actor Al Corley directed this film about community theatre.  Corley produced ""Drowning Mona"" with Bette Midler & Danny DeVito.  Marcus Thomas who stars here as Peter Rooker played Midler's son in that film.  Even though Thomas has acted in other films such as the street hustler in ""Noel"" with Susan Sarandon, his inexperience is SO convincing that you fully expect this to be his first film.  The community theatre is producing ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and the director Edwina wants to get to the ""inner Cyrano"" and decides to produce it without a nose.  Edwina is played by Clare Higgins who starred in a couple horror flicks in the 80s (""Hellraiser"" & ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"") as well as in ""Stage Beauties"" with Billy Crudup.  She believes in Rooker until his inexperience seems to make him unable to produce a good performance.  John Corbett who shined in TV's ""Northern Exposure"" and as the romantic lead in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" plays Michael, the semi-professional local theatre star whose Bohemian lifestyle leaves him living for the theatre.  Amy Smart who shined in ""Scotland PA,"" the tragicomedy adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" and also played with Ashton Kutcher in ""Butterfly Effect"" and with Owen Wilson & Ben Stiller in ""Starsky & Hutch"" does a great job as the local ingenue Grace who plays Roxanne in the local Cyrano production.  Both Michael & Peter fall for Grace and vie for her affections.  Michael lives with the former artistic director of the theatre named Kippy who now is dying of cancer.  Kippy is played by Alan Corduner who was in ""DeLovely"" & ""Vera Drake"" in 2004 and seems to have pearls of wisdom before he dies.  His memorial where his ashes are scattered in the theatre is an unusual moment.  Greg Germann who was Fish on the Ally McBeal TV show plays Peter's boss and is less than understanding about Peter's newfound interest in theatre.  Oscar winner Patty Duke (""The Miracle Worker"" from 1962) plays two roles, Mrs. Keene the stage manager who is a retiring spinsterish woman and Earline who is the flashy push-up bra costumer.  It's a fun dual role.  Her real-life son Sean Astin who assumed legendary status as Samwise Gamgee in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy plays Ken Zorbell, the know-it-all actor who replaces Peter.  When Duke locks Astin in the closet thus assuring Peter's opening night understudy performance, it's a rare mother-son scene.  I enjoyed this show.  It's a sweet domestic comedy with a great ensemble cast.  It gives a great sense of how theatre people revel in the magic of performance.

898493,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0008ENFW8,rsoonsa,"[1, 1]","While discussing this earnestly contrived comedic melodrama that he scripts and in part produces, Michigan playwright Rodney Vaccaro states that the scenario results from a reaction to the ""9-11"" occurrences, and that his intention here is to create a romantic detailing of events that will provide a storyline antithetical to the violence that marbles our lives, while including his fondness for community based non-professional theatre as apt background for the narrative.  Peter Rucker (Marcus Thomas), a graphic designer with a marked personality deficit, is attempting to reconstitute his life after his girl friend has left him, doing so primarily through reading of self-help books, but is additionally attracted by a community theatre near to his place of employment that is advertising its auditions for Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, and since Peter's freshly imposed solitude has resulted in a surfeit of free time during his evenings, he determines to try out for a small part in the classic play.  Although totally lacking stage experience, or even middling innate Thespic ability, the play's director has ""seen something"" in him and Peter is unaccountably selected, not simply as a member of the cast, but as Cyrano, the lead!  Another member of the cast, Mike Degan (John Corbett), a very much experienced player, designates himself as Peter's mentor both during and between rehearsals; however, when Rucker begins to dally with Degan's former lover Grace (Amy Smart), the play's Roxanne, partly due to Mike's urging, the latter begins to resent his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, weakening their bond, and this, in addition to unforeseen difficulties in mounting the production, must be rectified before the looming opening night performance.  Unfortunately, the film itself has troubles as well, and they are but seldom solved.  First-time director Al Corley permits the action to meander, with fifth-billed Thomas, fresh-faced but largely unskilled, a less than engaging Peter Rucker who is, near the film's end, abruptly replaced by first-billed Corbett as linchpin of the story, ratified by his ongoing connections with all of the other principals.  Although Peter is found to be completely inadequate as the featured performer, he quaintly is called upon to save the production after a newly appointed Cyrano becomes unavailable, an unconvincing gambit for one who, in reality, is only suitable for tech support or as a supernumerary.  In spite of these factors that weaken the piece's credibility it, ostensibly shot in Portland, Oregon, provides a pleasing quality of fellowship evidenced within its small community theatre group, and it treats of many standard stage related elements, both technical and non.  The film's most striking sequence is a splendidly realised ending that obviously was in the van of Vaccaro's creative impulses here, its preceding scenes for the most part subsequently crafted.  Originally named CAUGHT IN THE ACT, the production had to relinquish that title as it had been allocated elsewhere.  Although its box office take was low, a genuine affection for theatre is communicated throughout, and there is some rewarding conceptualization within Vaccaro's often literate screenplay, such as when the play's director, played by Clare Higgins, insists upon eschewing the work's customary emphasis upon Cyrano's proboscis in favour of an examination of his marrow.  Even though Corbett is given a misguided rant in one scene against the plays of Shakespeare, he handily wins acting honours.  Other meritable turns are to be enjoyed from the perfectly cast Higgins and her countryman Allan Corduner, who is given free rein. Patty Duke enjoys herself in a dual role, and Smart, who as an actress is an attractive young blonde, also enjoys herself.  In sum, then, this is a blemished but yet pleasing tribute to all community theatre associations that, in words from Rostand, ""work without one thought of gain or fame.""",3,Largely Implausible Account Of One Who Chose To Dare.,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,3962,"['discussing', 'earnestly', 'contrived', 'comedic', 'melodrama', 'part', 'produces', 'Michigan', 'playwright', 'Rodney', 'Vaccaro', 'scenario', 'results', 'reaction', '9-11', 'occurrences', 'intention', 'here', 'create', 'romantic', 'detailing', 'events', 'will', 'provide', 'storyline', 'antithetical', 'violence', 'lives', 'including', 'fondness', 'community', 'based', 'non-professional', 'theatre', 'apt', 'background', 'narrative', 'Peter', 'Rucker', 'Marcus', 'Thomas', 'graphic', 'designer', 'marked', 'personality', 'deficit', 'attempting', 'reconstitute', 'life', 'girl', 'friend', 'left', 'doing', 'so', 'primarily', 'reading', 'self-help', 'books', 'additionally', 'attracted', 'community', 'theatre', 'place', 'employment', 'advertising', 'auditions', 'Edmond', 'Rostand', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'Peter', 'freshly', 'imposed', 'solitude', 'resulted', 'surfeit', 'free', 'time', 'evenings', 'try', 'out', 'small', 'part', 'classic', 'play', 'totally', 'lacking', 'stage', 'experience', 'even', 'middling', 'innate', 'Thespic', 'ability', 'play', 'director', 'seen', 'something', 'Peter', 'unaccountably', 'selected', 'not', 'simply', 'member', 'cast', 'Cyrano', 'lead', 'member', 'cast', 'Mike', 'Degan', 'John', 'Corbett', 'very', 'much', 'experienced', 'player', 'Peter', 'mentor', 'rehearsals', 'however', 'when', 'Rucker', 'dally', 'Degan', 'former', 'lover', 'Grace', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'play', 'Roxanne', 'partly', 'due', 'Mike', 'urging', 'latter', 'begins', 'resent', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'weakening', 'bond', 'addition', 'unforeseen', 'difficulties', 'mounting', 'production', 'must', 'be', 'rectified', 'looming', 'opening', 'night', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'troubles', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'seldom', 'solved', 'First-time', 'director', 'Al', 'Corley', 'action', 'meander', 'fifth-billed', 'Thomas', 'fresh-faced', 'largely', 'unskilled', 'less', 'engaging', 'Peter', 'Rucker', 'who', 'film', 'end', 'abruptly', 'replaced', 'first-billed', 'Corbett', 'linchpin', 'story', 'ratified', 'ongoing', 'connections', 'other', 'principals', 'Peter', 'found', 'be', 'completely', 'inadequate', 'featured', 'performer', 'quaintly', 'called', 'save', 'production', 'newly', 'appointed', 'Cyrano', 'unavailable', 'unconvincing', 'gambit', 'one', 'who', 'reality', 'only', 'suitable', 'tech', 'support', 'supernumerary', 'spite', 'factors', 'weaken', 'piece', 'credibility', 'ostensibly', 'shot', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'pleasing', 'quality', 'fellowship', 'evidenced', 'small', 'community', 'theatre', 'group', 'many', 'standard', 'stage', 'related', 'elements', 'technical', 'non', 'film', 'most', 'striking', 'sequence', 'splendidly', 'realised', 'ending', 'obviously', 'was', 'van', 'Vaccaro', 'creative', 'impulses', 'here', 'preceding', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'subsequently', 'crafted', 'Originally', 'named', 'CAUGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'ACT', 'production', 'had', 'relinquish', 'title', 'had', 'been', 'allocated', 'elsewhere', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'was', 'low', 'genuine', 'affection', 'theatre', 'communicated', 'rewarding', 'conceptualization', 'Vaccaro', 'often', 'literate', 'screenplay', 'such', 'when', 'play', 'director', 'played', 'Clare', 'Higgins', 'eschewing', 'work', 'customary', 'emphasis', 'Cyrano', 'proboscis', 'favour', 'examination', 'marrow', 'Even', 'Corbett', 'given', 'misguided', 'rant', 'one', 'scene', 'plays', 'Shakespeare', 'handily', 'acting', 'honours', 'Other', 'meritable', 'turns', 'are', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Higgins', 'countryman', 'Allan', 'Corduner', 'who', 'given', 'free', 'rein', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'dual', 'role', 'Smart', 'who', 'actress', 'attractive', 'young', 'blonde', 'also', 'sum', 'then', 'blemished', 'yet', 'pleasing', 'tribute', 'community', 'theatre', 'associations', 'words', 'Rostand', 'work', 'one', 'thought', 'gain', 'fame']",Bigger Than the Sky VHS

I don't think Corley has ever been involved in theatre or been around theatre people! His over-the-top depiction of theatre people as airheaded, jobless, friendly, whimsical and constantly dramatic was an ignorant assumption made with no real study of community thespians. The script was anything but amusing but thought itself to be outrageously funny. The actors were dreadfully self-aware and awfully unlikable. I'm sad to see talented actors such as Patty Duke and Sean Astin stoop so low. And John Corbett, I believe, could really do well if he stopped picking such horid films. The whole deal with Cyrano not having the nose was not artistic but stupid. Along with not studying up on community theatre, I believe Corley also forgot to actually READ the beautiful Cyrano script and remember all the witty lines to do with having a large nose and that the ENTIRE PREMISE of the play revolves around his nose!I could go on much more but will restrain myself and sum up to say that this movie probably goes on the top ten worst films I've ever seen!The story is simple and simply done.
