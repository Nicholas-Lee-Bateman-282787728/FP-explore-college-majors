If the Canyon were a true story, I would say we have some nominees. The movie was very frustrating to watch because every time I started to feel sympathy for the characters, they would go do something idiotic to make their own situation even worse. Just a few examples:* The one tool they have left, they bury in a shallow grave.* With caves and other potential shelter everywhere, let's set up camp in an open field.* Nobody seems interested in finding water (distilling it from plants or whatever), despite nearly dying of thirst.* At one point the wife makes a smart move and comes up with some food. Her dying husband refuses to eat it and asks for gum instead.I give three stars because the movie does have some nice visuals, and the actors were rather good in their roles.

The disasters are kept to a few, which is good because that sort of thing can be overdone. No landslides, flash floods, indian attacks, quicksand, or going totally mad. Nice level of distress. The few disasters were however terrible but sort of predictable and some people may groan.I suggest suspending disbelief, because it is worth it to keep watching and focus on the tensions between the newlyweds and the scenery.The""making of"" special feature discovering the canyon was pretty nice because they took their movie seriously and mentioned issues working with the wolves and so on and we don't often see this in special features.

Zwick,"[2, 2]","*Possible spoilers****1/2Newlyweds Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahavski) stumble into the honeymoon-from-hell when they innocently and foolishly allow a grizzled old cowpoke to talk them into taking an unauthorized mule-trip into the heart of the Grand Canyon.  When Henry (Will Patton), the guide, is bitten by a rattlesnake, the couple is left to fend for themselves in this unfamiliar and brutally hostile terrain with little or no survival skills to help get them through the experience.Based on a number of recent movie going experiences (""127 Hours,"" ""Gerry"" and ""Open Water"" ), there seems to be a real genre developing here - which, for lack of a better term, we'll call the cocky-outdoorsman-gets-his-ever-lovin'-butt-kicked-by-Mother-Nature scenario.  Like those other films, ""The Canyon"" really makes us empathize with the plight the citified couple is going through, offering cringe-inducing scene after cringe-inducing scene of their often ham-handed attempts at staying alive.  Also, like those previous works, this movie explores the themes of how easy it is to find ourselves without warning at the mercy of an uncaring and capricious Fate; of how quickly stupid decisions made in the heat of the moment can lead to long-term, disastrous consequences; of how ill-equipped modern Man is at grappling against the forces of an impersonal Nature; and of how indomitable the human spirit can be in even the most dire and hopeless of circumstances.Replete with an ""ironic"" ending that will have you throwing things at the screen in frustration and dismay (think of it as the ultimate anti-deus ex machina), ""The Canyon,"" which was written by Steve Allrich and directed by Richard Harrah, makes for gripping and grueling, if not always, edifying or uplifting viewing.  It will also make you think twice before ignoring signs posted at national parks.

1276102,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002LBKE02,trebe,"[4, 6]","The Canyon (2008) is an adventure set in the Grand Canyon, where a newly married couple looking for adventure, have a completely unexpected experience.  While the cast gives good performances, and the film features some picturesque cinematography, the story has some major credibility issues that make for semi-interesting, though exasperating viewing.Newlyweds Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahovski), have eloped and come to the Grand Canyon looking to take a mule trail ride down to the bottom.  Failing to procure in advance the necessary permits, it appears that the couple is out of luck, when they run into a grizzled character named Henry (Will Patton), who offers to guide them on a tour of the canyon.The couple agrees, and head down with Henry into the canyon, the next day.  It is a good time, and at the bottom, Henry leads them to see some beautiful rock formations.  On the way to see some additional sights, a terrible accident occurs, and Henry is left in grave condition.  Suddenly, the group is down to one mule, and has no food, and very little water.  Things go from bad to worse, as the unprepared couple, is soon on their own.  Misfortune strikes again, and Lori has to rise to the occasion, and make some very hard choices.The Canyon deals with some provocative issues.  It is about facing a challenge, and doing what needs to be done.  When it comes to realism and authenticity, there are some major issues.  Nick and Lori are two of the least prepared hikers you could ever find.  They are in an environment that is hot and dry, and don't have headwear, sunglasses, food, water, snacks (except gum).  They must have some great sunscreen, because after four days in the sun, their skin doesn't look fried.  The survivors supposedly have nothing to drink for days, yet are always wet with sweat, traveling during the heat of the day.  When they lose their mules during the accident, it doesn't look like they try very hard to get them back.  Considering the animals were carrying their food and supplies, you would think they would have tried much, much harder.  Burying a valuable knife, is just another example, of how completely clueless these people are.The geography doesn't seem to match the situation, as the primary locations used in the film are not in the real Grand Canyon.  If you can't get the scenery right, tying the story to a specific location may not be a good idea.  It gets rather irritating, when the film repeatedly features a generic panoramic shot of the Grand Canyon, and then cuts into a location that looks nothing like the formation that was just shown.  They are supposed to be at the bottom of Grand Canyon, so that means views at a low elevation, with high rocky slopes around.  Yet there are scenes where they are clearly at some elevation, well clear of any canyon walls.  The Colorado river runs through the Grand Canyon, but there isn't a sign of it in the entire movie.The logical thing, would be to try and find a place to climb up out of the canyon.  Lori has a cell phone (whoo-hoo), which would probably get better reception, if they would move to higher ground.  Instead the couple apparently spend all their time, wandering at the bottom of the canyon.  When they finally do try to get to elevation, they make some really foolish decisions, which prove to be extremely costly, and painful.Given the script they have to work with, the cast really do the best they can.  Their strong performances, help make up for the problematic writing and production.  Will Patton is really likeable as the eccentric, been everywhere, done everything guide, Henry.  Eion Bailey is believable as the headstrong Nick, a nice guy in a situation that is totally beyond him.  Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck) gives an earnest performance, as her character faces life threatening situations.  After having previously displayed absolutely no knowledge of the wilderness, first aid or survival skills, Lori almost magically becomes competent in these areas.  It is quite an amazing transformation, but there is even more, as she survives being attacked by wolves, miraculously escaping without any serious injury.  Unfortunately, these fight scenes are not well executed.Those not bothered by the film's flaws, may find this an interesting drama.  For others, the ineptness of the characters, and general issues with reality, may interfere with the enjoyment of the film.  To their credit, the producers do not weasel out and cheat at the ending.  There isn't a lot of intelligent behavior in this film, and when it comes to dealing with nature, there often is a high price for stupidity.",2,a traumatic trip through the canyon . . .,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,4651,"['Canyon', '2008', 'adventure', 'set', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'where', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'looking', 'adventure', 'have', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'experience', 'cast', 'good', 'performances', 'film', 'picturesque', 'cinematography', 'story', 'major', 'credibility', 'issues', 'make', 'semi-interesting', 'exasperating', 'viewing.Newlyweds', 'Nick', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'Lori', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'have', 'eloped', 'come', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'looking', 'take', 'mule', 'trail', 'ride', 'down', 'bottom', 'Failing', 'procure', 'advance', 'necessary', 'permits', 'couple', 'luck', 'when', 'run', 'grizzled', 'character', 'named', 'Henry', 'Will', 'Patton', 'who', 'guide', 'tour', 'canyon.The', 'couple', 'agrees', 'head', 'down', 'Henry', 'canyon', 'next', 'day', 'good', 'time', 'bottom', 'Henry', 'see', 'beautiful', 'rock', 'formations', 'way', 'see', 'additional', 'sights', 'terrible', 'accident', 'occurs', 'Henry', 'left', 'grave', 'condition', 'Suddenly', 'group', 'down', 'one', 'mule', 'food', 'very', 'little', 'water', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'unprepared', 'couple', 'soon', 'own', 'Misfortune', 'strikes', 'again', 'Lori', 'rise', 'occasion', 'make', 'very', 'hard', 'choices.The', 'Canyon', 'deals', 'provocative', 'issues', 'facing', 'challenge', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'When', 'realism', 'authenticity', 'are', 'major', 'issues', 'Nick', 'Lori', 'are', 'two', 'least', 'prepared', 'hikers', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'are', 'environment', 'hot', 'dry', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'headwear', 'sunglasses', 'food', 'water', 'snacks', 'gum', 'must', 'have', 'great', 'sunscreen', 'four', 'days', 'sun', 'skin', ""n't"", 'look', 'fried', 'survivors', 'supposedly', 'have', 'nothing', 'drink', 'days', 'are', 'always', 'wet', 'sweat', 'traveling', 'heat', 'day', 'When', 'lose', 'mules', 'accident', ""n't"", 'look', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'back', 'Considering', 'animals', 'were', 'carrying', 'food', 'supplies', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'much', 'much', 'harder', 'Burying', 'valuable', 'knife', 'just', 'example', 'how', 'completely', 'clueless', 'people', 'are.The', 'geography', ""n't"", 'seem', 'match', 'situation', 'primary', 'locations', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'scenery', 'right', 'tying', 'story', 'specific', 'location', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'rather', 'irritating', 'when', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'generic', 'panoramic', 'shot', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'then', 'cuts', 'location', 'nothing', 'formation', 'was', 'just', 'shown', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'bottom', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'views', 'low', 'elevation', 'high', 'rocky', 'slopes', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'clearly', 'elevation', 'well', 'clear', 'canyon', 'walls', 'Colorado', 'river', 'Grand', 'Canyon', ""n't"", 'sign', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'logical', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'try', 'find', 'place', 'climb', 'up', 'canyon', 'Lori', 'cell', 'phone', 'whoo-hoo', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'better', 'reception', 'would', 'move', 'higher', 'ground', 'Instead', 'couple', 'apparently', 'spend', 'time', 'wandering', 'bottom', 'canyon', 'When', 'finally', 'do', 'try', 'get', 'elevation', 'make', 'really', 'foolish', 'decisions', 'prove', 'be', 'extremely', 'costly', 'painful.Given', 'script', 'have', 'work', 'cast', 'really', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'Their', 'strong', 'performances', 'help', 'make', 'up', 'problematic', 'writing', 'production', 'Will', 'Patton', 'really', 'likeable', 'eccentric', 'been', 'everywhere', 'done', 'everything', 'guide', 'Henry', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'believable', 'headstrong', 'Nick', 'nice', 'guy', 'situation', 'totally', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'Chuck', 'earnest', 'performance', 'character', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'having', 'previously', 'displayed', 'absolutely', 'knowledge', 'wilderness', 'first', 'aid', 'survival', 'skills', 'Lori', 'almost', 'magically', 'becomes', 'competent', 'areas', 'quite', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'even', 'more', 'being', 'attacked', 'wolves', 'miraculously', 'escaping', 'serious', 'injury', 'Unfortunately', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'executed.Those', 'not', 'bothered', 'film', 'flaws', 'may', 'find', 'interesting', 'drama', 'others', 'ineptness', 'characters', 'general', 'issues', 'reality', 'may', 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'credit', 'producers', 'do', 'not', 'weasel', 'out', 'cheat', 'ending', ""n't"", 'lot', 'intelligent', 'behavior', 'film', 'when', 'dealing', 'nature', 'often', 'high', 'price', 'stupidity']",N/A
1276103,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002LBKE02,Z Hayes,"[22, 24]","In ""Open Water"" (2003),  a pair of scuba divers (who were also a couple) got stranded in the middle of the ocean and found themselves imperiled by a school of sharks. Well, in ""The Canyon"", we have a newly-married couple stranded somewhere in the Grand Canyon and hunted by wolves. It's basically a survival-type drama with some twists, but on the whole is quite formulaic. What makes this watchable (though more as a rental and not a purchase) is the acting, which I thought was quite alright, considering this is a low-budget indie flick. The story centers around Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahovski) who are a pair of newly-weds and eager for adventure (well, Nick mainly) - Nick's idea of a perfect honeymoon is to explore the deepest recesses of the canyon via muleback. Unfortunately, Nick did not have the foresight to apply for a permit for their excursion and the pair decide to take on the proffered services of a grizzled old guide Henry (Will Patton).Will Patton makes the initial part of this movie quite watchable with his dry humor and vast knowledge of the canyon - he really is quite a hoot to watch in his role as guide. Unfortunately, his role is rather shortlived, and it is left to Nick and Lori to carry the rest of the movie through as the stranded pair are forced to rely on their wits to stay alive and make it out of the canyon, even as tragedy and danger stalk them in the form of a pack of determined wolves. Eion Bailey's Nick is quite average in his role as the smart ass new husband who uses his persuasive skills in getting Lori to agree to his adventure - a plan that seems doomed from the beginning considering his lack of planning and foresight.His character as such is hard to empathize with. Lori as portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski has more of a screen presence and manages to convey a wider range of emotions convincingly and had me rooting for her all through the movie. The highlight of this movie is actually the gorgeous cinematography of the canyon - simply breathtaking. On the whole, this is basically a been-there-done-that sort of survival drama, and I'd recommend it as a rental at best.",3,"Formulaic, with some credible acting",1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,2145,"['Open', 'Water', '2003', 'pair', 'scuba', 'divers', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'couple', 'got', 'stranded', 'middle', 'ocean', 'found', 'imperiled', 'school', 'sharks', 'Well', 'Canyon', 'have', 'newly-married', 'couple', 'stranded', 'somewhere', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'hunted', 'wolves', 'basically', 'survival-type', 'drama', 'twists', 'whole', 'quite', 'formulaic', 'What', 'watchable', 'though', 'more', 'rental', 'not', 'purchase', 'acting', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'alright', 'considering', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'flick', 'story', 'centers', 'Nick', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'Lori', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'who', 'are', 'pair', 'newly-weds', 'eager', 'adventure', 'well', 'Nick', 'mainly', 'Nick', 'idea', 'perfect', 'honeymoon', 'explore', 'deepest', 'recesses', 'canyon', 'muleback', 'Unfortunately', 'Nick', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'foresight', 'apply', 'permit', 'excursion', 'pair', 'decide', 'take', 'proffered', 'services', 'grizzled', 'old', 'guide', 'Henry', 'Will', 'Patton', '.Will', 'Patton', 'initial', 'part', 'movie', 'quite', 'watchable', 'dry', 'humor', 'vast', 'knowledge', 'canyon', 'really', 'quite', 'hoot', 'watch', 'role', 'guide', 'Unfortunately', 'role', 'rather', 'shortlived', 'left', 'Nick', 'Lori', 'carry', 'rest', 'movie', 'stranded', 'pair', 'are', 'forced', 'rely', 'wits', 'stay', 'alive', 'make', 'canyon', 'even', 'tragedy', 'danger', 'stalk', 'form', 'pack', 'determined', 'wolves', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'Nick', 'quite', 'average', 'role', 'smart', 'ass', 'new', 'husband', 'who', 'persuasive', 'skills', 'getting', 'Lori', 'agree', 'adventure', 'plan', 'doomed', 'beginning', 'considering', 'lack', 'planning', 'foresight.His', 'character', 'such', 'hard', 'empathize', 'Lori', 'portrayed', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'more', 'screen', 'presence', 'manages', 'convey', 'wider', 'range', 'emotions', 'convincingly', 'had', 'rooting', 'movie', 'highlight', 'movie', 'actually', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'canyon', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'whole', 'basically', 'been-there-done-that', 'sort', 'survival', 'drama', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rental', 'best']",N/A
