151272,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792844688,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","`Honeymoon in Vegas' is pretty much the comedic equivalent to `An Indecent Proposal', which is sad because `An Indecent Proposal' is a much better drama than `Honeymoon in Vegas' is a comedy.  I'm really not a fan of Nicholas Cage, not in the least.  I enjoyed him twice that I can recall (in `Adaptation' and `Matchstick Men') but aside from those two fluke performances I'm always left cold by his horrid line reading.  In fact I'm willing to say that his spastic performance in this comedy could very well be his worst ever.  He happens to be one of those actor's who thinks if he screams his lines they'll grab a hint of hilarity, but they don't and he comes off ridiculous, especially when paired next to Sarah Jessica Parker and James Caan who work with what little they're given with much greater success than Cage.In the film Cage plays Jack Singer, a man afraid to commit.  He travels to Vegas with his girlfriend Betsy, played by Parker, to finally tie the knot but before he can he finds himself in a high stakes poker game with a mobster named Tommy Korman.  Tommy, who has his eye on Betsy, ends up taking Jack for $65,000, money that Jack doesn't have, but in turn offers him a resolution.  If Jack will lend Tommy his fianc&eacute; for the weekend then his debt will be erased.  Betsy reluctantly agrees only to find out that her weekend will not be spent in Vegas but in Hawaii with Tommy and his family (son and daughter-in-law and his new granddaughter).  It's in this tropical paradise that Tommy begins to woo Betsy for himself while Jack frantically tries to find her and win her back.Parts of this film are funny, in particular the `Flying Elvis's' at the end of the film are delightful, but almost every scene involving Cage is dreadful.  Sarah Jessica Parker does a nice job of playing the fed up girlfriend who can't make up her mind who or what she believes, but it's Caan who steals the show in my opinion.  He's always been a great actor, and not much has changed since his glory days.  He's still on top of his game and acts circles around the rest of the cast.Sadly, he still isn't enough to save this film from generic boredom.  The jokes are mildly funny at that and the plot is so predictable it's annoying.  The ending especially was so bland I was just waiting for them to do something, anything, to make it pop.  Sadly, that pop never came.  Instead we are just left with a lukewarm taste in our mouths and a mixed bag of feelings in regards to the experience we just endured.  Is it worth watching?  Eh, maybe.  Is it worth watching a second time?  I would answer `no', but this is me and you are you.  I wouldn't recommend this film, but Cage may be your cup of tea and if he is then by all means, watch and make up your own mind.  Just know that if you're expecting `Adaptation' levels of hilarity you will be sorely disappointed since that Cage is not present in this mess.",2,"Sadly, not really all that funny...",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2913,"['Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'pretty', 'much', 'comedic', 'equivalent', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'sad', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'much', 'better', 'drama', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'not', 'least', 'enjoyed', 'twice', 'can', 'recall', 'Adaptation', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'aside', 'two', 'fluke', 'performances', ""'m"", 'always', 'left', 'cold', 'horrid', 'line', 'reading', 'fact', ""'m"", 'willing', 'say', 'spastic', 'performance', 'comedy', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'worst', 'ever', 'be', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'grab', 'hint', 'hilarity', 'do', ""n't"", 'off', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'when', 'paired', 'next', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'work', 'what', 'little', ""'re"", 'given', 'much', 'greater', 'success', 'Cage.In', 'film', 'Cage', 'Jack', 'Singer', 'man', 'afraid', 'commit', 'Vegas', 'girlfriend', 'Betsy', 'played', 'Parker', 'finally', 'tie', 'knot', 'can', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'mobster', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Korman', 'Tommy', 'who', 'eye', 'Betsy', 'up', 'taking', 'Jack', '65,000', 'money', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'have', 'turn', 'offers', 'resolution', 'Jack', 'will', 'lend', 'Tommy', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'weekend', 'then', 'debt', 'will', 'be', 'erased', 'Betsy', 'reluctantly', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'weekend', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'spent', 'Vegas', 'Hawaii', 'Tommy', 'family', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'new', 'granddaughter', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'Tommy', 'woo', 'Betsy', 'Jack', 'frantically', 'find', 'win', 'back.Parts', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'particular', 'Flying', 'Elvis', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'delightful', 'almost', 'scene', 'involving', 'Cage', 'dreadful', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'fed', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'who', 'what', 'Caan', 'who', 'show', 'opinion', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'glory', 'days', 'still', 'top', 'game', 'circles', 'rest', 'cast.Sadly', 'still', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'generic', 'boredom', 'jokes', 'are', 'mildly', 'funny', 'plot', 'so', 'predictable', 'annoying', 'ending', 'especially', 'was', 'so', 'bland', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'make', 'pop', 'Sadly', 'pop', 'never', 'came', 'Instead', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'lukewarm', 'taste', 'mouths', 'mixed', 'bag', 'feelings', 'regards', 'experience', 'just', 'endured', 'watching', 'Eh', 'maybe', 'worth', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'answer', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'Cage', 'may', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Just', 'know', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Adaptation', 'levels', 'hilarity', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Cage', 'not', 'present', 'mess']",N/A

The best part of the film is always the sight of the Flying Elvises. Another funny part is when the Mike Tyson guy was describing how he was doing his wife which got Jack Singer all insane.

A relatively early film in the careers of both Nicholas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker, Honeymoon In Vegas should have been early indicator to audiences everywhere that these two would become Hollywood mainstays. Along with celebrated industry veteran James Caan (who plays a surprisingly similar role on the present TV show Las Vegas), the three combine to create an interesting, if not extremely hilarious, storyline which adds a new twist to the traditional conflict of the love triangle...Jack Singer (Nicholas Cage) is forever haunted by a deathbed promise he made to his mother, giving his word that he would never get married. But the promise threatens to end his relationship with long-time girlfriend and true love Betsy (Sarah Jessica Parker). So Jack proposes and the couple decides to race off to Las Vegas and get married. However, their trip to Vegas is soon interrupted when Jack is set up in a poker game by professional gambler Tommy Korman (James Caan).With a single hand of poker, Jack loses $65,000 to Korman who promises to forgive the debt in exchange for a single weekend with his fianc&eacute;e Betsy. Initially outraged at the setup, Jack sees the proposed solution as a way out of the debt, so he convinces Betsy to go along with the idea. But Jack soon becomes horribly jealous and changes his mind. When he goes to find Betsy, he's forced to fight against Korman and his minions who have arranged to keep Jack away permanently. Now, Jack must get to Betsy any way he can and tell her how much he loves her before Korman convinces her she's marrying the wrong man, and that the right man is no other than Korman himself...One of James Caan's best performances, the character of Tommy Korman comes off as a somewhat likeable guy even though he plays the role of antagonist to our hero. The best characters are those that are multi-dimensional, and the director creates a great environment which allows the various cast members to act out the emotions of their characters. Put together, these diverse characters interact in exciting and interesting ways, making Honeymoon In Vegas a fun and enjoyable film.Featuring several Hollywood icons, Honeymoon In Vegas is a character-driven romantic comedy capable of holding its own with any film in its genre. Although it never experienced the widespread commercial success of some of its contemporaries, the film nevertheless maintains a high level of entertainment value. If you haven't seen Honeymoon In Vegas, then I highly recommend it. It's worth the time.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 2]","From the filmmaker who wrote ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""The Freshman"" comes a romantic comedy titled ""Honeymoon in Vegas"".Written and directed by Andrew Bergman, the film would star Nicolas Cage (""Moonstruck"", ""Peggy Sue Got Marrie"", ""The Cotton Club""), Sarah Jessica Parker (""Sex and the City"", ""Square Pegs"", ""Ed Wood"") and James Caan (""The Godfather"", ""Elf"", ""Misery"").The film revolves around Jack Singer (played by Nicolas Cage), his dying mother wanted him to promise on thing...that is to never get married.For Jack, he is shocked that his mother request such a thing but because it was his mom's dying wish, he came to accept it.That is until he met Betsy (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), his girlfriend and a woman that is everything he wanted.  A woman he would love...but as their love was strong, both noticed they were starting to become disconnected.That is because Betsy does not want to be a girlfriend but wants to become his wife and if he is unwilling to do be her husband, she won't stay in the relationship.Knowing that he would be breaking his mom's promise, Jack knows that Betsy is perfect for him and so, out of nowhere, he tells her that they will be going to Vegas to get married.The two stay at Bally's Hotel and enjoy their time together.  But watching them is a professional gambler named Tommy Korman (played by James Caan).  When he sees Betsy, he sees his late wife and now, wants to marry her.So, Tommy concocts a plan to get Jack involved in a crooked Poker game in order for him to get close to Betsy and remove Jack from the picture.The plan works and Jack loses $65,000.  With no money to pay for it, Korman tells him that he will erase the debt if Jack allows him to spend one weekend with Betsy.Disheveled and upset, Jack explains to Betsy what happened and Betsy is shocked that Jack would make her into someone's whore.  He tries to tell her that all he requests is a weekend and not anything sexual.  And knowing that she and Jack do not have money to pay back the debt, the two agree and Betsy would spend time with Tommy for the weekend.For Jack it begins to eat him up of what he has done to Betsy but to his shock, he finds out that Betsy is no longer in Vegas.  Tommy has taken Betsy to Hawaii and now, Tommy will do what he can to keep Betsy with him and keep Jack away from her.Can Jack reunite with Betsy?  Or will she end up marrying the wealthy Tommy Korman?VIDEO:""Honeymoon in Vegas"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 1:85:1).  Many people who are familiar with my reviews know that I have a sort of disdain towards how films from the mid '80s to the early '90s have looked on Blu-ray.  I have this feeling that a lot of film made economic decisions to use certain types of film and in HD, unfortunately these films tend to look soft, fuzzy and literally look their age.  While some films do look good, so far, many films continue to have this uneven picture quality and unfortunately, ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" is the same.Moments where the film looks very good (ie. outdoor scenes, especially with Sarah Jessica Parker in the pool or when everyone is in Hawaii) but at times, soft and not vibrant at all.  So, it's a mix-up of good and not-so-good and where noise tends to show itself at times.But still, I've not owned the VHS and DVD versions of the film but if you are a fan of the film, I would expect that this version is probably the best version on video to date.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Honeymoon in Vegas"" is presented in English 2.0 Surround DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish and French monaural.  Dialogue and Elvis music is clear as it comes from the front channels.  It's pretty much a basic lossless stereo soundtrack but one thing that the film is known for (especially its original soundtrack) is its music.  But overall, dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Honeymoon in Vegas"" comes with its original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:""Honeymoon in Vegas"" is your average romantic comedy that has its fair share of laughs but a year later, a film with similar concept titled ""Indecent Proposal"" would one-up this comedy and have it fade to movie obscurity.I vaguely remember this film and its hard to believe that both Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker were in a film together.While Nicolas Cage was known for romantic comedies in the '80s and '90s, Sarah Jessica Parker was known in the '80s for ""Square Pegs"" and eventually started to be in several films as a main lead actress but things obviously went uphill for the actress when she was the lead for ""Sex and the City"".  But her role in ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" had its hilarious moments when she would scream at Jack for making her a ""whore"".  But once she leaves Jack to spend time with Korman, I just felt that the comedy that I was enjoying between both she and Jack, was done.If there was one actor who did probably save this film from being terrible is James Caan as his performance was quite solid.  He was the no-nonsense hustler but at the same time, he was able to provide a few laughs during the film.  While the late Pat Morita, also did a wonderful job in the film whenever he was able to receive some screen time.As for the film ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" was OK.  As mentioned earlier, ""Indecent Proposal"" took a similar premise and did it much, much better.  Granted, one is a drama and the ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" is a comedy but I was not exactly loving it.  And I'm also not the type to enjoy Elvis impersonators and there are plenty of it in this film.  There are just too many moments where the storyline seemed unbelievably forced and kitschy.As for the Blu-ray release, it has no special features but the trailer and the PQ is uneven but if you really enjoyed the film, there is no doubt that this will be the better version on video to own for the time being.Overall, for me this title is a mere rental but if you really enjoyed this film back in 1992, then definitely give this Blu-ray a chance.",3,"It's not the greatest romantic comedy, nor is it the worst.

Even the portrayal of Caan, who plays a manipulative gambler, is pretty even-handed and neutral. I like Caan and Cage as actors, and this is probably the only time they've worked together, so perhaps the film is somewhat noteworthy for that, and Parker is easy to look at, too.

151295,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792844688,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Writer/director Andrew Bergman offers a humorous take on romance and the consequences of procrastinating when it comes to commitment, in ""Honeymoon In Vegas,"" a comedy of love, loyalty, longing and an airplane filled with skydiving Elvis impersonators.  Nicolas Cage stars as Jack Singer, a guy in love but hampered by a promise he may or may not have made to his mother, Bea (Anne Bancroft), on her deathbed, which causes him to drag his heels on the path to the altar.  When he finally manages a breakthrough, he spirits his girl, Betsy (Sarah Jessica Parker), off to Las Vegas with the intention of tying the knot once and for all.  But before the plan can come to fruition, enter professional gambler (and widower) Tommy Korman (James Caan), who spots Betsy in the lobby of a hotel.  what follows involves something of a twist in plot, but suffice to say, Jack is about to face a personal baptism by fire.  And Betsy may be the flame, but Korman is the flint.  It's an amusing comedy that never gets too deep beneath the surface or purports to be anything but what it is, though the plot does dip in to a bit of a gray area, morally speaking.  The performances are good all around, though nothing here is anything approaching a stretch for any of the principals involved.  Cage conveys the angst of his situation with aplomb, and employs that hang-dog look he does so well to great effect while his emotions implode.  Parker looks fetching and makes a credible character of Betsy, but even though the action revolves around her there is not a whole lot for her to sink her teeth into with this part.  But to her credit she handles what she is given to work with convincingly enough.  Caan looks every bit the part of Korman; in fact, to put this part over he had little more to do than show up.  Even at that, there are times when he takes it just a trifle over the top.  The supporting cast includes Pat Morita (Mahi Mahi), Johnny Williams (Johnny Sandwich), Seymour Cassel (Tony Cataracts) and Peter Boyle, who creates one of the more memorable scenes in the movie, as Chief Orman.  With ""Honeymoon In Vegas,"" Bergman has put together a film that, while not entirely memorable, is good for some laughs (the highlight of which is when Jack must of necessity interact with the flying Elvis impersonators).  In the end, with some popcorn and a little imagination, for Cage fans especially, this movie will make for a satisfying evenings entertainment.",3,Some Laughs In &quot;Vegas&quot;,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,2454,"['Writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Bergman', 'humorous', 'take', 'romance', 'consequences', 'procrastinating', 'when', 'commitment', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'comedy', 'love', 'loyalty', 'longing', 'airplane', 'filled', 'skydiving', 'Elvis', 'impersonators', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Jack', 'Singer', 'guy', 'love', 'hampered', 'promise', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'mother', 'Bea', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'deathbed', 'drag', 'heels', 'path', 'altar', 'When', 'finally', 'breakthrough', 'girl', 'Betsy', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'off', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'intention', 'tying', 'knot', 'once', 'plan', 'can', 'come', 'fruition', 'enter', 'professional', 'gambler', 'widower', 'Tommy', 'Korman', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'spots', 'Betsy', 'lobby', 'hotel', 'what', 'something', 'twist', 'plot', 'suffice', 'say', 'Jack', 'face', 'personal', 'baptism', 'fire', 'Betsy', 'may', 'be', 'flame', 'Korman', 'flint', 'amusing', 'comedy', 'never', 'too', 'deep', 'surface', 'purports', 'be', 'anything', 'what', 'plot', 'dip', 'bit', 'gray', 'area', 'morally', 'speaking', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'nothing', 'here', 'anything', 'approaching', 'stretch', 'principals', 'involved', 'Cage', 'conveys', 'angst', 'situation', 'aplomb', 'hang-dog', 'look', 'so', 'well', 'great', 'effect', 'emotions', 'implode', 'Parker', 'fetching', 'credible', 'character', 'Betsy', 'even', 'action', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'sink', 'teeth', 'part', 'credit', 'what', 'given', 'work', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'Caan', 'bit', 'part', 'Korman', 'fact', 'put', 'part', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'Even', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'just', 'trifle', 'top', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Mahi', 'Mahi', 'Johnny', 'Williams', 'Johnny', 'Sandwich', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Tony', 'Cataracts', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Chief', 'Orman', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'Bergman', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'memorable', 'good', 'laughs', 'highlight', 'when', 'Jack', 'must', 'necessity', 'interact', 'flying', 'Elvis', 'impersonators', 'end', 'popcorn', 'little', 'imagination', 'Cage', 'fans', 'especially', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'satisfying', 'evenings', 'entertainment']",N/A
