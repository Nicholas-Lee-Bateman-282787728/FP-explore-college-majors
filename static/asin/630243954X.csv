312669,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,630243954X,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","WE'RE NOT MARRIED is a 1952 Twentieth Century-Fox black-and-white comedy about five couples who find they were not legally married due to a foul-up two and a half years earlier on the part of a bumbling Justice of the Peace (played by perennial cinematic screwup Victor Moore).  The most elaborate sequence, the first, involves radio comic Fred Allen and Ginger Rogers who host a popular a.m. radio show called ""Breakfast With the Glad Gladwyns,"" a very broad satire of ""breakfast with"" programs popular at the time, most notably ""Breakfast With Dorothy (Kilgallen, the columnist) and Dick"" (Kollmar, her actor husband).  Unlike the real thing, the Gladwyns' love-fest is a gaffe all the way: the couple actually hate each other and ""breakfast"" takes place inside a broadcasting studio with stunt people on hand to mimic the sounds of pouring coffee, a small child, and a singing canary.  The fun of this sequence lies in its utter cynicism toward marriage, celebrity, and the ethics of a radio show that constantly plugs products as though such chatter were a part of normal breakfast conversation.  (Off-mike, Ginger Rogers' character refers to a sponsoring brand of coffee as ""laundry juice"" and the other products are just as cockeyed).  Few actors played sarcasm as well as Ginger Rogers but in Fred Allen she may have found her match.The second sequence -- and shortest in the movie -- stars Marilyn Monroe as a contestant for the ""Mrs. Mississippi"" beauty-queen title and David Wayne as her spouse, who stays home with the baby while she is away.  The fatal letter announcing that their marriage was a non-event comes while she is off on a publicity tour.  The two play off each other very well, but the sequence may draw outrage from those who were misled by the deliberately misleading DVD cover box, which makes the movie appear to be Marilyn's affair entirely.  In reality Monroe is billed fourth in the movie, and she appears on-screen for less than ten minutes.  The third sequence stars Eve Arden and Paul Douglas as a couple who married out of New York's Caf&eacute; Society whirl, then moved to Manhasset, Long Island where things got dull very quickly.  (The chief event one evening is the arrival of the latest Book-of-the-Month.)  The fourth sequence stars Louis Calhern as a Texas oil millionaire who is tricked by his luxury-loving wife (Zsa Zsa Gabor) into a divorce.  The sequence is charming in its own way, though somewhat foreordained; Calhern and Gabor got the lowest billing in the movie when it was first released.The fifth and second-longest sequence stars Eddie Bracken and Mitzi Gaynor as a soldier and wife.  She learns she is pregnant just as he learns that they have no legal marriage, as he is enroute to the front and away from her.  A bright and fast-paced comedy of errors emerges, despite the fact that the script will not let anyone use the words ""illegitimate"" or ""pregnant.""  Lee Marvin has an uncredited role as ""Pinky,"" an Army buddy who helps explain the situation to Bracken's top Sergeant.  To end the movie, a very quick montage sequence lets us in on how the various couples resolve the situation.  All in all, WE'RE NOT MARRIED is a well-played chapter comedy, with good performances from stars and supporting players, including Jane Darwell as the J.P.'s long-suffering wife and Paul Stewart as a loathsome divorce lawyer.  Aside from the consumer fraud of letting purchasers think this is a ""Marilyn Monroe picture,"" the chief regret here is probably that the story of a sixth couple, rural folk played by Walter Brennan and Hope Emerson, was cut for length, even though the resulting feature runs only 87 minutes. (That sequence still exists; why wasn't it re-incorporated into the DVD release?) It is also a shame that the DVD has no significant bells-and-whistles such as Commentary or star biographies, just trailers and a little MM publicity.Imdb ratings comparisons:WE'RE NOT MARRIED:  -  6.4LOVE NEST:  -  6.2MONKEY BUSINESS:  -  7.0",4,"A MINIMUM OF MARILYN, THOUGH A FUN MOVIE OVERALL",1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,3993,"['WE', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'MARRIED', '1952', 'Twentieth', 'Century-Fox', 'black-and-white', 'comedy', 'five', 'couples', 'who', 'find', 'were', 'not', 'legally', 'married', 'due', 'foul-up', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'earlier', 'part', 'bumbling', 'Justice', 'Peace', 'played', 'perennial', 'cinematic', 'screwup', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'most', 'elaborate', 'sequence', 'first', 'radio', 'comic', 'Fred', 'Allen', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'who', 'host', 'popular', 'a.m.', 'radio', 'show', 'called', 'Breakfast', 'Glad', 'Gladwyns', 'very', 'broad', 'satire', 'breakfast', 'programs', 'popular', 'time', 'most', 'notably', 'Breakfast', 'Dorothy', 'Kilgallen', 'columnist', 'Dick', 'Kollmar', 'actor', 'husband', 'real', 'thing', 'Gladwyns', 'love-fest', 'gaffe', 'way', 'couple', 'actually', 'hate', 'other', 'breakfast', 'place', 'broadcasting', 'studio', 'stunt', 'people', 'hand', 'mimic', 'sounds', 'pouring', 'coffee', 'small', 'child', 'singing', 'canary', 'fun', 'sequence', 'utter', 'cynicism', 'marriage', 'celebrity', 'ethics', 'radio', 'show', 'constantly', 'products', 'such', 'chatter', 'were', 'part', 'normal', 'breakfast', 'conversation', 'Off-mike', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'character', 'refers', 'sponsoring', 'brand', 'coffee', 'laundry', 'juice', 'other', 'products', 'are', 'just', 'cockeyed', 'Few', 'actors', 'played', 'sarcasm', 'as', 'well', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Fred', 'Allen', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'match.The', 'second', 'sequence', 'shortest', 'movie', 'stars', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'contestant', 'Mrs.', 'Mississippi', 'beauty-queen', 'title', 'David', 'Wayne', 'spouse', 'who', 'home', 'baby', 'away', 'fatal', 'letter', 'announcing', 'marriage', 'was', 'non-event', 'off', 'publicity', 'tour', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'sequence', 'may', 'draw', 'outrage', 'who', 'were', 'misled', 'deliberately', 'misleading', 'DVD', 'cover', 'box', 'movie', 'appear', 'be', 'Marilyn', 'affair', 'entirely', 'reality', 'Monroe', 'billed', 'fourth', 'movie', 'on-screen', 'less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'third', 'sequence', 'stars', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'couple', 'who', 'married', 'New', 'York', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Society', 'whirl', 'then', 'moved', 'Manhasset', 'Long', 'Island', 'where', 'things', 'got', 'dull', 'very', 'quickly', 'chief', 'event', 'one', 'evening', 'arrival', 'latest', 'Book-of-the-Month', 'fourth', 'sequence', 'stars', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'Texas', 'oil', 'millionaire', 'who', 'tricked', 'luxury-loving', 'wife', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'divorce', 'sequence', 'charming', 'own', 'way', 'somewhat', 'foreordained', 'Calhern', 'Gabor', 'got', 'lowest', 'billing', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.The', 'fifth', 'second-longest', 'sequence', 'stars', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'soldier', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'just', 'have', 'legal', 'marriage', 'enroute', 'front', 'away', 'bright', 'fast-paced', 'comedy', 'errors', 'emerges', 'fact', 'script', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'use', 'words', 'illegitimate', 'pregnant', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'uncredited', 'role', 'Pinky', 'Army', 'buddy', 'who', 'explain', 'situation', 'Bracken', 'top', 'Sergeant', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'quick', 'montage', 'sequence', 'how', 'various', 'couples', 'resolve', 'situation', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'MARRIED', 'well-played', 'chapter', 'comedy', 'good', 'performances', 'stars', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'J.P.', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Paul', 'Stewart', 'loathsome', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'Aside', 'consumer', 'fraud', 'letting', 'purchasers', 'think', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'picture', 'chief', 'regret', 'here', 'probably', 'story', 'sixth', 'couple', 'rural', 'folk', 'played', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Hope', 'Emerson', 'was', 'cut', 'length', 'even', 'resulting', 'feature', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'sequence', 'still', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 're-incorporated', 'DVD', 'release', 'also', 'shame', 'DVD', 'significant', 'bells-and-whistles', 'such', 'Commentary', 'star', 'biographies', 'just', 'trailers', 'little', 'MM', 'publicity.Imdb', 'ratings', 'comparisons', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'MARRIED', '6.4LOVE', 'NEST', '6.2MONKEY', 'BUSINESS', '7.0']",We're Not Married VHS
312670,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,630243954X,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 0]","Monroe's early work examined20th century fox has has brought there early Monroe movies, and they have markedted them,as worthy at a look simply because she is in them. All of these movies have merits/demerits for other reasons,and this may be the slightest of them and her scenes in this one exceedingly vapid in which she is used to little effect. To be honest in these films,no one assumed she would be the big female star in which later stars would later be modelled. The bonus features bear out what is said since they mostly deal with Monroe who barely appears in the film,and she adorns the cover in living color. I should say briefly stars from this era who were able to master their material,often were not given much credit. Male stars and female. So was the field of comedy. She was very adroit and mastered the field of comedy,knowing what to do with the material,body movements so her roles became sensual engaging and funny...this type of acting was underestimated, but if we watch comedies today we realize comedy is a venue of entertainment hard to pull off. She very often mastered her material...the seven year itch was a case in point and some like it hot. We cant imagine those films with anyone else...neither can I. To watch her ina role make it hard for others to follow in he rshoesThis film,which seems like an old joke on radio,fred allen and all and with a variety of stars rather than a star,is passable. I think the material would have been better served to have some material with the pastor and less with theleering police/soldiers which is the movie at its worse. You get the idea in these scenes the writers are looking for fillers. One of the better parts of the film is when victor moore(great character actor in comedy) imagines himself in many fantasies of love with many females to escape from the boredome of marriage. Probably the best part of the film,and elevates it in many ways but this is brief and the movie would have been better served concentrating here. Of these small roles she plays in these fox movies,this is probably her least successful in a batheing suit in scene which married men in fron appear more as jokes than father's but they are that. Scenes like these bring down this movie,making it campy,and she would later detest some of the work she was given,and perhaps some of the boors in holywood too who surrounded her.",3,interesting vignette on couples not really married,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,2379,"['Monroe', 'early', 'work', 'examined20th', 'century', 'fox', 'brought', 'there', 'early', 'Monroe', 'movies', 'have', 'markedted', 'worthy', 'look', 'simply', 'movies', 'have', 'merits/demerits', 'other', 'reasons', 'may', 'be', 'slightest', 'scenes', 'one', 'exceedingly', 'vapid', 'used', 'little', 'effect', 'be', 'honest', 'films', 'one', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'female', 'star', 'later', 'stars', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'modelled', 'bonus', 'features', 'bear', 'out', 'what', 'said', 'mostly', 'deal', 'Monroe', 'who', 'barely', 'film', 'cover', 'living', 'color', 'should', 'say', 'briefly', 'stars', 'era', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'master', 'material', 'often', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'credit', 'Male', 'stars', 'female', 'was', 'field', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'adroit', 'mastered', 'field', 'comedy', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'material', 'body', 'movements', 'roles', 'became', 'sensual', 'engaging', 'funny', 'type', 'acting', 'was', 'underestimated', 'watch', 'comedies', 'today', 'realize', 'comedy', 'venue', 'entertainment', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'often', 'mastered', 'material', 'seven', 'year', 'itch', 'was', 'case', 'point', 'hot', 'cant', 'imagine', 'films', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'watch', 'ina', 'role', 'make', 'hard', 'others', 'follow', 'film', 'old', 'joke', 'radio', 'fred', 'allen', 'variety', 'stars', 'rather', 'star', 'passable', 'think', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'have', 'material', 'pastor', 'less', 'theleering', 'police/soldiers', 'movie', 'worse', 'get', 'idea', 'scenes', 'writers', 'are', 'looking', 'fillers', 'One', 'better', 'parts', 'film', 'when', 'victor', 'moore', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'comedy', 'many', 'fantasies', 'love', 'many', 'females', 'escape', 'boredome', 'marriage', 'Probably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'brief', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'concentrating', 'here', 'small', 'roles', 'fox', 'movies', 'probably', 'least', 'successful', 'batheing', 'suit', 'scene', 'married', 'men', 'fron', 'appear', 'more', 'jokes', 'father', 'are', 'Scenes', 'bring', 'down', 'movie', 'making', 'campy', 'would', 'later', 'detest', 'work', 'was', 'given', 'perhaps', 'boors', 'holywood', 'too', 'who', 'surrounded']",We're Not Married VHS
312671,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,630243954X,Classic Movie watcher,"[2, 2]","The invalid marriage license must be a hot topic in those years. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" by Alfred Hitchcock dealt with a similar theme. Even to this day, given the option of remarrying or going on separate ways, a couple will find the idea both exciting and terrifying.This movie is more interesting and romantic than I thought.The rich and successful radio show hosts Ginger Rogers-Fred Allen pair was the first non-compatible couple who would have seized this opportunity to break up. Their marriage had nothing to hang on to except that both their careers were at stake. Marilyn Monroe pair was the one who would fall apart because her prospect was so glamorous that as a beauty queen she'd better remain single than be a married mother. The ironic couple was the super rich Freddie Melrose who really loved his wife Zsa Zsa Gabor. This was the funniest of all. Witness the face-off of the husband and wife-lawyer team. The wheel of the fortune was really spinning fast.The story ended with such a romantic note. With or without a license, it is this sense of crisis that gives the couple a rare opportunity to reflect upon the relationship and make the most of it.

312672,A2P49WD75WHAG5,630243954X,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[32, 34]","""In one week, he laid six time bombs. ... He jumped the gun.  The appointment was for 1 January.  This clown began marrying people before he had the authority!""  That's what the attorney general tells the Governor Bush (!!!) of (I presume Louisiana), as the story opens in Gretna Green.  That clown is Judge Melvin Bush (Victor Moore), a doddering but well-meaning old man.  His daughter-in-law, the governor's wife, proposes that they write the couples of the mistake and let them take it from there.The first couple, Steve and Ramona Gladwyn (Fred Allen and Ginger Rogers) have the funniest moments of all five.  However, two and a half years after their marriage, they live in a totally hostile atmosphere, and they don't need help from that thunderstorm outside in the opening waking up segment.  Avoiding each other, slamming doors, not saying a word--imagine what this couple think about each other.  They are hosts of a radio breakfast program that mentions products of their latest sponsors.  As Steve puts it, we're ""having a bit of good, clean, nauseating fun over the bacon in eggs in the morning.""  We actually get a sample of their show, the Glad Gladwyns, and it's funny:  ""I did what so many society women do these days.  I went to Madame Yvonne's Hairdo Heaven  Madame Yvonne uses the Sensational Hairdresser.  It contains that new mystery ingredient... chicken fat!""The second involves Jefferson and Annabelle Norris (David Wayne and Marilyn Monroe) of Senatobia, Mississippi.  Mrs. Norris has just won the Mrs. Mississippi beauty pageant, and I would definitely have voted for her.  While she's out winning contests, her husband is stuck feeding the baby and doing the kitchenwork.  However, Annabelle's agent has bigger plans, to expand this to the national level, which means more stay-at-home for the increasingly disgruntled Jefferson.  That is, until he opens the letter.  It's interesting to see the view of house-husbands in the 1950's compared to today.Couple number three are Hector and Katherine Woodruff (Paul Douglas and Eve Arden).  Despite the judge describing them as talkative, ""yakkety yak yak"", it's quite the opposite.  Their situation is similar to that of the Gladwins, except that they get along slightly better.  Thing is, there's an air of boredom.  There's hardly anything to talk about and Hector seems to remember the days when he used to party, to the displeasure of his wife.Frederick and Eve Melrose (Louis Calhern and Zsa Zsa Gabor)--ah yes, that couple.  Mr. Melrose, an oil tycoon is pleasantly surprised when his wife suggests she meet him at his usual hotel where he retires to when conducting business in New Orleans, and she particularly asks, ""don't forget to register for me.""  What follows is a show of deceit, until the letter shows up.  It's the registration form showing 5 June 1951, which if I do the math, reveals that the first marriage by the judge was done Christmas Eve 1948.Wilson and Patricia Fisher (Eddie Bracken and Mitzi Gaynor) have a trying time.  Wilson, called up for the Asiatic-Pacific Theatre, presumably Korea, is not only shocked to know his wife is pregnant, but he has already gotten the letter, and he is being shipped overseas.  His sergeant is totally unsympathetic to the problem, saying that he should try not to get shot.  The view of 50's morality of illegitimacy is interesting when seen from today's eyes.There is one goof that is seen only once.  When Mr. Norris gets the letter, we see that there is just his name, city and state--no street address.  Either Senatobia is small enough that the mailman knows everyone by name, or he is telepathic.  And one wonders if all the letters were like that.An interesting collection of five stories, with all performers doing their best, but notable for a young and still very beautiful Marilyn Monroe.  Victor Moore would later be a plumber in The Seven Year Itch, also with MM, and this is the second of four films David Wayne appeared in with MM.  Ginger Rogers would appear with MM in Monkey Business.",5,"""...to inform you that you are not legally married.""",1062201600,"08 30, 2003",2003,4040,"['one', 'week', 'laid', 'six', 'time', 'bombs', 'jumped', 'gun', 'appointment', 'was', '1', 'January', 'clown', 'began', 'marrying', 'people', 'had', 'authority', 'what', 'attorney', 'general', 'Governor', 'Bush', 'presume', 'Louisiana', 'story', 'Gretna', 'Green', 'clown', 'Judge', 'Melvin', 'Bush', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'doddering', 'well-meaning', 'old', 'man', 'daughter-in-law', 'governor', 'wife', 'write', 'couples', 'mistake', 'let', 'take', 'there.The', 'first', 'couple', 'Steve', 'Ramona', 'Gladwyn', 'Fred', 'Allen', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'have', 'funniest', 'moments', 'five', 'However', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'marriage', 'live', 'totally', 'hostile', 'atmosphere', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', 'thunderstorm', 'opening', 'waking', 'up', 'segment', 'Avoiding', 'other', 'slamming', 'doors', 'not', 'saying', 'word', 'imagine', 'what', 'couple', 'think', 'other', 'are', 'hosts', 'radio', 'breakfast', 'program', 'mentions', 'products', 'latest', 'sponsors', 'Steve', ""'re"", 'having', 'bit', 'good', 'clean', 'nauseating', 'fun', 'bacon', 'eggs', 'morning', 'actually', 'get', 'sample', 'show', 'Glad', 'Gladwyns', 'funny', 'did', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'society', 'women', 'do', 'days', 'went', 'Madame', 'Yvonne', 'Hairdo', 'Heaven', 'Madame', 'Yvonne', 'Sensational', 'Hairdresser', 'new', 'mystery', 'ingredient', 'chicken', 'fat', 'second', 'Jefferson', 'Annabelle', 'Norris', 'David', 'Wayne', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Senatobia', 'Mississippi', 'Mrs.', 'Norris', 'just', 'won', 'Mrs.', 'Mississippi', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'voted', 'out', 'winning', 'contests', 'husband', 'stuck', 'feeding', 'baby', 'doing', 'kitchenwork', 'However', 'Annabelle', 'agent', 'bigger', 'plans', 'expand', 'national', 'level', 'more', 'stay-at-home', 'increasingly', 'disgruntled', 'Jefferson', 'letter', 'interesting', 'see', 'view', 'house-husbands', '1950', 'compared', 'today.Couple', 'number', 'three', 'are', 'Hector', 'Katherine', 'Woodruff', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'judge', 'describing', 'talkative', 'yakkety', 'yak', 'yak', 'quite', 'opposite', 'situation', 'similar', 'Gladwins', 'get', 'along', 'slightly', 'better', 'Thing', 'air', 'boredom', 'hardly', 'anything', 'talk', 'Hector', 'remember', 'days', 'when', 'used', 'party', 'displeasure', 'wife.Frederick', 'Eve', 'Melrose', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'ah', 'yes', 'couple', 'Mr.', 'Melrose', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'wife', 'meet', 'usual', 'hotel', 'where', 'when', 'conducting', 'business', 'New', 'Orleans', 'particularly', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'register', 'What', 'show', 'deceit', 'letter', 'up', 'registration', 'form', 'showing', '5', 'June', '1951', 'do', 'math', 'reveals', 'first', 'marriage', 'judge', 'was', 'done', 'Christmas', 'Eve', '1948.Wilson', 'Patricia', 'Fisher', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'have', 'trying', 'time', 'Wilson', 'called', 'up', 'Asiatic-Pacific', 'Theatre', 'presumably', 'Korea', 'not', 'only', 'shocked', 'know', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'already', 'gotten', 'letter', 'being', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'sergeant', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'problem', 'saying', 'should', 'try', 'not', 'get', 'shot', 'view', '50', 'morality', 'illegitimacy', 'interesting', 'when', 'seen', 'today', 'eyes.There', 'one', 'goof', 'seen', 'only', 'once', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Norris', 'letter', 'see', 'just', 'name', 'city', 'state', 'street', 'address', 'Senatobia', 'small', 'enough', 'mailman', 'everyone', 'name', 'telepathic', 'one', 'wonders', 'letters', 'were', 'that.An', 'interesting', 'collection', 'five', 'stories', 'performers', 'doing', 'best', 'notable', 'young', 'still', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'plumber', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'also', 'MM', 'second', 'four', 'films', 'David', 'Wayne', 'appeared', 'MM', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'would', 'appear', 'MM', 'Monkey', 'Business']",We're Not Married VHS
312673,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,630243954X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 8]","We're Not Married is a star-studded comedy from 1952 that helped catapult Marilyn Monroe to stardom.  Ginger Rogers gets top billing, but the spotlight is shared by just about everyone in this terrific cast.  The premise of the movie centers around a rather scatterbrained, newly appointed (by his nephew the governor) justice of the peace who marries a number of couples immediately after receiving his formal letter on Christmas Eve.  Unfortunately, his appointment was not official until January 1, meaning that over two years later several couples from many walks of life suddenly discover that they are not legally married.  The reaction of each couple to this news is, to say the least, quite varied.  Ginger Rogers and Fred Allen play a popular morning show husband and wife team who get paid to sound like the happiest couple on earth, yet they no longer even speak to each other off the air; they treat the news at first as a miracle come true.  Marilyn Monroe plays a beauty contestant who has to give up her newly-won crown of Mrs. Mississippi, much to the delight of her exceedingly domesticated husband (David Wayne).  The Woodruffs (Paul Douglas and Eve Arden) are perhaps the most typical married couple, conversing about only the most mundane topics when they speak at all, and the husband cannot help but entertain thoughts of painting the town red once again with a different woman on his arm each night.  The news arrives in the form of divine justice for wealthy businessman Freddie Melrose (Louis Calhern), whose gold-digging wife (Zsa Zsa Gabor) is planning on taking him for everything he's worth in divorce court.  The most memorable couple by far have to be the Fishers, though.  Willie Fisher (Eddie Bracken) is hit with two tons of bricks just as he is shipping out with his military unit: he and his wife are not legally married, and his beloved Patty (Mitzi Gaynor) is pregnant.  The links he goes to in order to make sure his child will not be born out of legal wedlock are quite touching and make for a most satisfying, uplifting ending.We're Not Married is a comedy that succeeds exceedingly well.  The acting is superb all the way around, and some real truths about marriage are to be found within and among the laughter the film generates.  Although Marilyn Monroe does not have one of the more significant roles in the film, her performance was impressive enough to land her face on the cover of Life magazine alongside a caption referring to her as the new talk of Hollywood.  1952 was the real breakout year for Marilyn, and this deeply amusing film has a lot to do with that fact.

What follows after they learn this shocking news forms the premise of the comedy 'We're Not Married'.The plot offers potential, but the delivery is uneven and the various stories told swing from very touching (Eve Arden/Paul Douglas) to hackneyed (Ginger Rogers/Fred Allen). The best segment, and the one they saved for last, is Eddie Bracken and Mitzi Gaynor as a young soldier and his newly unwed mother-to-be; you almost wish the entire movie was about them and their travails to re-hitch the knot.Unfortunately, too much time is spent with the very first couple and ""star"" of this ensemble cast, Ginger Rogers. That forced imbalance undercuts the subsequent stories. Not the least of which is how unappealing her segment's co-star, Fred Allen, is in this particular role. I have nothing against the actor, but he was clearly miscast. Much too old, too crotchety, too fickle to ever have the audience believe Ginger's character would ever consent to a union, even for money.And a paring down of the couples from five to three would've strengthened the film considerably.Clearly, because this was filmed in 1952, the choices made are not nearly as dramatic or unusual as one would expect or hope for today almost a half-century later. Still, on balance, I would say this is pretty decent and enjoyable - if only for the clever concept.A couple of footnotes: Look for an uncredited bit part played by a young actor named Lee Marvin. And despite the prominent featured image of Marilyn Monroe on the DVD cover artwork, remember that she plays a small role in a large ensemble cast and her 'not married' scene was one of the shorter stories.",3,Uneven But Reasonably Enjoyable,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,1736,"['Suppose', 'five', 'couples', 'learn', '2-1/2', 'years', 'marriage', 'union', 'legally', 'invalid', 'What', 'learn', 'shocking', 'news', 'premise', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'Not', ""Married'.The"", 'plot', 'potential', 'delivery', 'uneven', 'various', 'stories', 'told', 'swing', 'very', 'touching', 'Eve', 'Arden/Paul', 'Douglas', 'hackneyed', 'Ginger', 'Rogers/Fred', 'Allen', 'best', 'segment', 'one', 'saved', 'last', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'young', 'soldier', 'newly', 'unwed', 'mother-to-be', 'almost', 'wish', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'travails', 're-hitch', 'knot.Unfortunately', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'very', 'first', 'couple', 'star', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'forced', 'imbalance', 'subsequent', 'stories', 'Not', 'least', 'how', 'unappealing', 'segment', 'co-star', 'Fred', 'Allen', 'particular', 'role', 'have', 'nothing', 'actor', 'was', 'clearly', 'miscast', 'Much', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'crotchety', 'too', 'fickle', 'ever', 'have', 'audience', 'believe', 'Ginger', 'character', 'would', 'ever', 'consent', 'union', 'even', 'money.And', 'paring', 'couples', 'five', 'three', 'would', ""'ve"", 'strengthened', 'film', 'considerably.Clearly', 'was', 'filmed', '1952', 'choices', 'made', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'dramatic', 'unusual', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'hope', 'today', 'almost', 'half-century', 'later', 'Still', 'balance', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'decent', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'clever', 'concept.A', 'couple', 'footnotes', 'Look', 'uncredited', 'bit', 'part', 'played', 'young', 'actor', 'named', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'prominent', 'featured', 'image', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'DVD', 'cover', 'artwork', 'remember', 'small', 'role', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', ""'not"", 'married', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'shorter', 'stories']",We're Not Married VHS
