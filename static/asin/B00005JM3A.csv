612167,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00005JM3A,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 2]","Honestly this has to be one of the most unique shows after to be a hit on American TV. The theme tells it all: a guy named Sam Beckett is leaping into different people during his lifetime by an unknown force and driven to change history for the better with his only guide being a lusty hologram of his frient and colleague Al who only Sam can see and hear. So he keeps going hoping his next leap will be the leap home. Well here we start the adventures of Sam Beckett:Indiana farm boy,MIT graduate and general wunderkind with a swiss cheesed memory. Every week the man is literally someone else. First he's an airforce pilot,than a baseball player-all in the same episode. Before you know it he's a disipated English lit professor destined to avoid the charms of a festishist more or less. Since Quantum Leap was such an enlightened and progressive show there are episodes even this early in the game such as ""The Color Of Truth"" in which Sam,a white man (my man Scott Bakula) leaps into a black chauffer in the mid 50's south in a veryDriving Miss Daisystyle sendup. The great part of that is how Al,himself a huge participant in the civil rights movement helps Sam to step into the shoes of a black man in that place and time. It's episodes like this that offer an atypical ""put yourself in their shoes"" scenrio. Also the episode showcases that often ignored fact about African Americans-the fact they're as willing,if sometimes not more so than others, a helping hand to those they call friend. A great message for those with strong misconceptions of black people especially in the late 80's/early 90's. This DVD is only eight episodes long and as withNorthern Exposuremuch of the original music used has been replaced. But it's great to see all the episodes of one of a handfull of TV series I really genuinely loved and anyone who never saw this before should rent it. If they do they'll get caught up in these great stories,great messages and great characters of one of the most unique sci fi shows ever.",5,Leaping Within Your Lifetime,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2010,"['Honestly', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'shows', 'be', 'hit', 'American', 'TV', 'theme', 'guy', 'named', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'leaping', 'different', 'people', 'lifetime', 'unknown', 'force', 'driven', 'change', 'history', 'better', 'only', 'guide', 'being', 'lusty', 'hologram', 'frient', 'colleague', 'Al', 'who', 'only', 'Sam', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'going', 'hoping', 'next', 'leap', 'will', 'be', 'leap', 'home', 'Well', 'here', 'start', 'adventures', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'Indiana', 'farm', 'boy', 'MIT', 'graduate', 'general', 'wunderkind', 'swiss', 'cheesed', 'memory', 'week', 'man', 'literally', 'someone', 'else', 'First', 'airforce', 'pilot', 'baseball', 'player-all', 'same', 'episode', 'know', 'disipated', 'English', 'lit', 'professor', 'destined', 'avoid', 'charms', 'festishist', 'more', 'less', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'was', 'such', 'enlightened', 'progressive', 'show', 'are', 'episodes', 'even', 'early', 'game', 'such', 'Color', 'Truth', 'Sam', 'white', 'man', 'man', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'black', 'chauffer', 'mid', '50', 'south', 'veryDriving', 'Miss', 'Daisystyle', 'sendup', 'great', 'part', 'how', 'Al', 'huge', 'participant', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'Sam', 'step', 'shoes', 'black', 'man', 'place', 'time', 'episodes', 'offer', 'atypical', 'put', 'shoes', 'scenrio', 'Also', 'episode', 'often', 'ignored', 'fact', 'African', 'Americans-the', 'fact', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sometimes', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'others', 'helping', 'hand', 'call', 'friend', 'great', 'message', 'strong', 'misconceptions', 'black', 'people', 'especially', 'late', ""80's/early"", '90', 'DVD', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'long', 'withNorthern', 'Exposuremuch', 'original', 'music', 'used', 'been', 'replaced', 'great', 'see', 'episodes', 'one', 'handfull', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'genuinely', 'loved', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'before', 'should', 'rent', 'do', ""'ll"", 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'great', 'stories', 'great', 'messages', 'great', 'characters', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'sci', 'fi', 'ever']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

Although the show borrows from a concept employed in other realms, such as Highway To Heaven (with its theme of a mysterious force interceding to transform a single life), it adds a unique twist by utilizing elements of science fiction. Created by Donald P. Bellisario (creator of Magnum, P.I., JAG, and countless other hit shows), Quantum Leap developed a loyal cult following, making its short network run all the more difficult to understand...Quantum Leap stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Samuel ""Sam"" Beckett, a cutting-edge experimental researcher in the field of physics. Developing a theory that an individual can travel throughout the span of his life, Beckett builds the Quantum Leap Accelerator and uses himself as the test subject. But rather than traveling within his own lifetime, Beckett finds himself mysteriously transported into the lives of various individuals, each of whom faces a problem Beckett must rectify (thus changing history for the better). When he does, he can make his next ""quantum leap"" (which he hopes will restore him to his pre-experiment self). Aiding Beckett on his various missions is Rear Admiral Albert ""Al"" Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), one of the quantum leap experiment observers who periodically appears as a hologram in order to communicate with Beckett. With each new episode, Beckett finds himself in a new body, facing new circumstances, with a new mission he must decipher and complete if he ever hopes to return home...The Quantum Leap (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the series premiere ""Genesis"" in which the audience first learns of Project Quantum Leap (PQL) and witnesses Dr. Beckett's leap into the particle accelerator. Beckett is transported into the body of an Air Force test pilot and a minor league baseball player, learning from Al's hologram what he must do with each man's life. The episode ends with Beckett transported into the body of a school teacher right in the middle of class... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Star-Crossed"" in which Sam prevents a college co-ed from ruining her life while giving her professor a second chance at making his marriage work, and ""The Color of Truth"" in which Sam is transported into the life of a black chauffeur in 1955, where he faces the virulent affects of discrimination and racism...Below is a list of episodes included on the Quantum Leap (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Genesis: Part 1 - September 13, 1956)Episode 2 (Genesis: Part 2 - September 13, 1956)Episode 3 (Star-Crossed - June 15, 1972)Episode 4 (The Right Hand of God - October 24, 1974)Episode 5 (How the Tess was Won - August 5, 1956)Episode 6 (Double Identity - November 8, 1965)Episode 7 (The Color of Truth - August 8, 1955)Episode 8 (Kamikazi Kid - June 6, 1961)Episode 9 (Play It Again Seymour - April 14, 1953)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating series...,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,2983,"['short', 'run', 'March', '1989', 'May', '1993', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'dramatic', 'series', 'television', 'history', 'show', 'concept', 'employed', 'other', 'realms', 'such', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'theme', 'mysterious', 'force', 'interceding', 'transform', 'single', 'life', 'unique', 'twist', 'utilizing', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'Created', 'Donald', 'P.', 'Bellisario', 'creator', 'Magnum', 'P.I.', 'JAG', 'countless', 'other', 'hit', 'shows', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'developed', 'loyal', 'cult', 'following', 'making', 'short', 'network', 'run', 'more', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'cutting-edge', 'experimental', 'researcher', 'field', 'physics', 'Developing', 'theory', 'individual', 'can', 'travel', 'span', 'life', 'Beckett', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Accelerator', 'test', 'subject', 'rather', 'traveling', 'own', 'lifetime', 'Beckett', 'mysteriously', 'transported', 'lives', 'various', 'individuals', 'whom', 'problem', 'Beckett', 'must', 'rectify', 'thus', 'changing', 'history', 'better', 'When', 'can', 'make', 'next', 'quantum', 'leap', 'will', 'restore', 'pre-experiment', 'self', 'Aiding', 'Beckett', 'various', 'missions', 'Rear', 'Admiral', 'Albert', 'Al', 'Calavicci', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'one', 'quantum', 'leap', 'experiment', 'observers', 'who', 'periodically', 'hologram', 'order', 'communicate', 'Beckett', 'new', 'episode', 'Beckett', 'new', 'body', 'facing', 'new', 'circumstances', 'new', 'mission', 'must', 'decipher', 'complete', 'ever', 'return', 'home', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'action-packed', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'Genesis', 'audience', 'first', 'learns', 'Project', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'PQL', 'Dr.', 'Beckett', 'leap', 'particle', 'accelerator', 'Beckett', 'transported', 'body', 'Air', 'Force', 'test', 'pilot', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'learning', 'Al', 'hologram', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'man', 'life', 'episode', 'Beckett', 'transported', 'body', 'school', 'teacher', 'right', 'middle', 'class', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Star-Crossed', 'Sam', 'college', 'co-ed', 'ruining', 'life', 'giving', 'professor', 'second', 'chance', 'making', 'marriage', 'work', 'Color', 'Truth', 'Sam', 'transported', 'life', 'black', 'chauffeur', '1955', 'where', 'virulent', 'affects', 'discrimination', 'racism', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Genesis', 'Part', '1', 'September', '13', '1956', 'Episode', '2', 'Genesis', 'Part', '2', 'September', '13', '1956', 'Episode', '3', 'Star-Crossed', 'June', '15', '1972', 'Episode', '4', 'Right', 'Hand', 'God', 'October', '24', '1974', 'Episode', '5', 'How', 'Tess', 'was', 'Won', 'August', '5', '1956', 'Episode', '6', 'Double', 'Identity', 'November', '8', '1965', 'Episode', '7', 'Color', 'Truth', 'August', '8', '1955', 'Episode', '8', 'Kamikazi', 'Kid', 'June', '6', '1961', 'Episode', '9', 'Play', 'Again', 'Seymour', 'April', '14', '1953', 'DVD', 'Report']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

They have the re-run in the SciFi Channel. You may want to watch it in the SciFi Channel and see if you like the show first.  In a nutshell, Quantum Leap is about a guy trapped in a time travalling sciense experiment. He leaps from one timeline to another timeline. He has no control on where or when he will traval to. When he is in another timeline, he becomes someone else in someone else's body. Of course, when he is somewhere else in someone's body, there will be a different kind of stories in every single show.Time travalling stories, IMHO, are all about the same thing.  Whether it is The Time Machine, Back to the Future, or Lost In Space, it is all about... well... you know what. Quantum Leap is almost about the same but with a little variation.What makes this DVD set five stars, beside it has a good story, is the picture quality. It is very sharp with very good color reproduction.  If you have the Star Trek Next Generation or the Sex in the City set, you know how crappy fuzzy these two dvd sets are.On the other hand, sound quality is not as good as the picture quality but it is at least loud enough.

Leaping in time and changing events could be disastrous as any science fiction fan knows.  That this series does this cavalierly as the way in which each time jump is concluded makes me think that the writers did not think this through very well.  I also find it interesting that he never leaps forward in time only back.  I understand that the &#34;time space continuum&#34; theory is not universal among sci-fi programs but the logic of it is clear.

Stories are lightweight but make good use of the difference in time between the now of the series (already beginning to fade into the ""past"") and the past.

The stories do often have that bit of mildly serious sentiment to give it ""heart"" but usually not intrusive or too 'gooey'. Best of all are the two stars: Scott Bakula, as the hero and victim of the erratic plunges into unplanned time periods for which he is quite unfitted, is appealing if sometime overly gawky (a role characteristic not his acting).

Missing since the late '90s, it seems we're about to get re-introduced to Quantum Leap.This Vonnegut-esque series is about a research physicist go gets ""unstuck"" in time, and randomly ""leaps"" into the lives of other people.  (Well, it may not be ""random"", but that's open to interpretation).  In any case, he remains in his new body until he rights a wrong in that person's life.What happens to the person Dr. Beckett replaces isn't always clear.  Later in the series we find that they go to a ""waiting room"" from Dr. Beckett's time, but even then the rules can get a little flexible.No matter  - the tableaux of events spanning the life of a later 20th century/ early 21st century physicist and rennaissance man lead to a number of compelling episodes. At various times, Dr. Beckett leaps into the life of a deaf man, an African-American, a condemned murderer, a person with Down's syndrome, and in one surprise episode, Lee Harvey Oswald.  Late in the series we learn there is an ""evil"" leaper, sent to make life miserable for those she ""leaps"" into.Joining Scott Bakula as Dr. Beckett is Dean Stockwell, a wonderfully underrated performer in a role that proves much deeper than most anticipated.I'm looking forward to this DVD, and hope for lots of extra features to bring this series to life.",5,A Season 1 DVD - Good News,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1352,"['Possibly', 'last', 'really', 'engaging', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'series', 'Missing', 'late', ""'90s"", ""'re"", 'get', 're-introduced', 'Quantum', 'Leap.This', 'Vonnegut-esque', 'series', 'research', 'physicist', 'go', 'unstuck', 'time', 'randomly', 'leaps', 'lives', 'other', 'people', 'Well', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'random', 'open', 'interpretation', 'case', 'new', 'body', 'rights', 'wrong', 'person', 'life.What', 'person', 'Dr.', 'Beckett', 'replaces', ""n't"", 'always', 'clear', 'Later', 'series', 'find', 'go', 'waiting', 'room', 'Dr.', 'Beckett', 'time', 'even', 'then', 'rules', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'flexible.No', 'matter', 'tableaux', 'events', 'spanning', 'life', 'later', '20th', 'century/', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'physicist', 'rennaissance', 'man', 'lead', 'number', 'compelling', 'episodes', 'various', 'times', 'Dr.', 'Beckett', 'life', 'deaf', 'man', 'African-American', 'condemned', 'murderer', 'person', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'one', 'surprise', 'episode', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'Late', 'series', 'learn', 'evil', 'leaper', 'sent', 'make', 'life', 'miserable', 'leaps', 'into.Joining', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Dr.', 'Beckett', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'wonderfully', 'underrated', 'performer', 'role', 'much', 'deeper', 'most', 'anticipated.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'hope', 'lots', 'extra', 'features', 'bring', 'series', 'life']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

Now, when loads of TV shows are coming to DVD, Universal finally wises up to the potential dollars and gives us what we want.I loved Quantum Leap, it was my fave show when I was a kid. Every Tuesday on BBC2 at 9pm, that was my fave time of week. I never cared much for the X-Files or any other Sci-Fi show coz Quantum Leap was the best. Is there anyone out there who didn't cry at the end of the (alarmingly downbeat) last episode?This box set includes the first nine episodes (that's a whole season by the way). The episodes are...1 and 2. Genesis-September 13, 1956-Sam's first leaps into an Air Force test pilot and a baseball player. The emotional ending alone is probably what sold the show.3. Star-Crossed-June 15, 1972-Sam leaps into a sugar-daddy college professor and meets his future wife as a student. This episode is particularly annoying thanks to the casting of an overweight 40-something as a teenager.4. The Right Hand of God-October 24, 1974-Sam leaps into a boxer fighting for prize-money to fund the building of a new church.5. How the Tess Was Won-August 5, 1956-Sam becomes a vet who tries to marry a pretty cowgirl.6. Double Identity-November 8, 1965-Sam leaps into a Mafia hitman and a mafia Don, while trying to avoid a contract on his head.7. The Color of Truth-August 8, 1955-Sam leaps into the body of a black private driver who kicks of the civil rights movement in the deep south.8. Camikazi Kid-June 6, 1961-Sam leaps into a boy racer who must stop his big sister from marrying a wife beating drunk.9. Play It Again, Seymour-April 14, 1953-Sam becomes a private eye who is involved in a murder/betrayal plot.The shows are presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally shot. The prints are fine looking with nice color detail and little in the way of dirt or scratches. The sound is plain old Dolby Stereo but is still more than adequate considering the show's simple sound design. Extras are made up of a couple of featurettes and Scott Bakula/Dean Stockwell introductions to each individual episode.With Season 2 out already it appears that Universal know there is still money to be made from Quantum Leap so one hopes the remaining box sets won't be too far behind.

As a result, he finds himself leaping through time, trapped in other people's bodies with his own memory playing tricks on him.  He must find a way to change their lives for the better so he can leap out.  Along the way, he gets a chance to reconnect with his day (via phone) and help a future former girlfriend.  The only person he has to help him along is a hologram from his own time.  And Al (Dean Stockwell) isn't always as much help as Sam would like.I must admit that, while I like the series, I've only seen maybe a dozen episodes over the years.  Anytime I do catch a rerun, seems like it's one I've already seen.  As a result, all the episodes in this set were new to me.  Of course, that isn't saying much.Season 1 was a mid-season replacement show.  As a result, this season is only the pilot plus seven regular episodes.  As with most shows, it uses this time to find the characters and polish the storylines.  A few of the trademarks of the series aren't there as of yet.  For example, it's on the last couple episodes that end with Sam's classic ""Oh boy!""  Still, we've got some entertaining stories here, stories that don't always go where you think they will.  I especially enjoy some of the references to real history that Sam accidentally gets involved in, such as Watergate.  These episodes also feature guest spots from Terri Hatcher and Jason Priestly before they became famous.Two episodes stand out from this set.  ""The Color of Truth"" sends Sam into the body of a black man in the south just before the Civil Rights movement starts.  His unintended actions create quite a stir in the small town, and it highlights the evils of segregation with only minimal preaching.The second one is just plain fun.  ""Play it Again, Seymour"" finds Sam in the body of a PI.  It spoofs noir in an entertaining mystery.  I also enjoyed it because it guest starred Claudia Christian in her days before Babylon 5, one of my all time favorite shows.This is a three-disc set, which gives more then enough room for the nine hours of material.  The picture is the original full frame, and the sound is mono.  There is some dust occasionally in the picture, most noticeably when stock footage is used, but overall, it's sharp.  Extras include a short documentary on the creation of the series and an introduction for each episode by series star Scott Bakula.  Honestly, the biggest complaint is the price.  It seems little steep for a set this short, especially considering what the full seasons of this show are going for.Over all, fans of this show will be pleased to have it.

612219,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JM3A,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 8]","You will find yourself repeating this phrase, an ad-lib by Scott Bakula that became the trademark of the show, a lot. It's already managed to worm its way into my everyday conversation, without me even realising.I never really knew much Quantum Leap. I never watched it when it was originally on TV, but I was only 5 when it first appeared. I borrowed this from my boyfriend, to make a small difference to watching Friends & Lois & Clark constantly!It did get off to a shaky start, with the pilot episode, I felt like there should still be a lot more explaining to do, but it's to keep you watching isn't it? Little snippets of information are revealed throughout the series, just to keep you watching, without revealing it all in the first series. It's a shockingly short first season, but had it been known that it would take off so well, then they probably would have made it to the more standard length of a TV season, around 20+ episodes.Scott Bakula (Sam) & Dean Stockwell (Al) make a great comedy team, and bounce perfectly off each other. Al is the women obsessed, cigar smoking, weird dressing hologram, who walks through things and thinks everything else around him is a hologram. Sam is the man who's quite literally lost touch and forgotten about everything in his own time, and is now bouncing around in his lifetime, trying to get back to his own time and his own body. He's quite the goody two shoes to Al's leering over the women. There are many different people he leaps into, including a boxer, an English professor, a Humphrey Bogart lookalike, a black man in the 50s, and many others. What was my favourite? I'm not sure. I quite liked Sam leaping into the black man. It was interesting to see a period of time when everything was so segregated. Sam also manages to run into some stars of the future: in one of the earlier episodes, he runs into a young Buddy Holly, and influences him to change the name of a song he's improvising to ""Peggy Sue""; he runs into Michael Jackson in a bathroom, and ""shows"" him how to moonwalk; and also in the last episode, he meets a young Woody Allen. The latter was a reference that went completely over my head, as did a lot in that episode. All the references to Humphrey Bogart and all the old detectives were lost on me.Many TV series these days have the all too familiar guest stars, but Quantum Leap manages to steer away from this. That was always a problem with Friends, it's like lets recognise the famous face this episode. The only faces I managed to recognised were a very longhaired Teri Hatcher, Jason Priestley, and Joey's dad from Friends.I'm not too sure how this show is going to last the five series it did, but my boyfriend does have them all on DVD, and I've already borrowed the second season, so we'll see how it pans out. He's refusing to reveal the ending, so I guess I'll have to keep watching, so I'm very curious. The show will ultimately always be about leaping about, but judging by the ending, Sam will leap into a woman, which will make it slightly different, and hopefully, the show will keep changing, just to keep it fresh and new.I can't wait to see the next season! And even moreso if Scott keeps appearing topless as much as he did in this! What, was it written into his contract that he HAD to appear topless? If you've got it flaunt it.

I started watching QL when I was about 15, in its 2nd season. Of course, I caught up quickly and have all of them personally taped on VHS. DVD is of course --- MUCH BETTER!!!The best thing about this DVD is that the first season comes UNEDITED! It includes the ORIGINAL opening narration voiced by Sam (Bakula) and the ORIGINAL theme song played over the ORIGINAL opening film footage!!!! Also, each episode includes a short episode introduction by Bakula, which you can choose to turn on or off.The icing on the cake is the short documentary with Bakula, Stockwell and Bellasario overviewing the first season and how it all got started. It's a great compliment to the episodes.Apparently there are &quot;hidden messages&quot; on the discs, but I have yet to see them. I didn't get a chance to watch everything last night.

612224,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JM3A,Mitch Weaver,"[9, 9]","Doctor Sam Beckett ( Scott Bakula) has created an accelerator chamber that allows a person to travel in time or ""leap"" back and forth within the confines of their own lifetime. Unfortunately, the people funding the project are not convinced that it works. So in order to prove that the accelerator works, Sam leaps prematurely before the system is fully operational. He is lept back in time, and his soul is forced into another person's body. Sam's only link to his own time is his best friend and fellow co-worker Al Calavicci ( Dean Stockwell) who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. In order to move on, Sam must put something right that went wrong in the person's life that he lept into. From that moment on, Sam leaps from life to life, hoping each time that his next leap, will be the leap home.Quantum Leap is without a doubt my favorite television show of all time. The show featured an extremely original perspective on time travel. I love the fact that even though Sam's soul or essence if you will, would leap from life to life, he would always assume the physical characteristics of the person that he would leap into. One of the best parts of each episode, would be seeing the reflection of the person in the mirror. Each episode also showcased extremely realistic set designs as well. Each time period that Sam lept into was recreated very effectively. Quantum Leap also managed to keep you in suspense, despite the fact you always knew that Sam would save the day. However, the show could not have succeeded without Scott Bakula or Dean Stockwell. They were so great together on screen, that they could literally pass for best friends in real life. They had the best on screen chemistry of any two actors that I have ever seen.It has been officially confirmed. The nine episode first season of Quantum Leap is coming to DVD on June 8, 2004. This is something that many fans of the show have been waiting for, including myself. If there was ever a show that deserved to be on DVD it is Quantum Leap.  While it is yet to be seen what the extras will be, the show is worth owning just for the episodes themselves.",5,Quantum Leap is the best TV show ever,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2155,"['Doctor', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'created', 'accelerator', 'chamber', 'person', 'travel', 'time', 'leap', 'back', 'forth', 'confines', 'own', 'lifetime', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'funding', 'project', 'are', 'not', 'convinced', 'So', 'order', 'prove', 'accelerator', 'Sam', 'prematurely', 'system', 'fully', 'operational', 'lept', 'back', 'time', 'soul', 'forced', 'person', 'body', 'Sam', 'only', 'own', 'time', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'Al', 'Calavicci', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'form', 'hologram', 'only', 'Sam', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'order', 'move', 'Sam', 'must', 'put', 'something', 'right', 'went', 'wrong', 'person', 'life', 'lept', 'moment', 'Sam', 'life', 'life', 'hoping', 'time', 'next', 'leap', 'will', 'be', 'leap', 'home.Quantum', 'Leap', 'doubt', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'time', 'show', 'featured', 'extremely', 'original', 'perspective', 'time', 'travel', 'love', 'fact', 'even', 'Sam', 'soul', 'essence', 'will', 'would', 'leap', 'life', 'life', 'would', 'always', 'assume', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'person', 'would', 'leap', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'reflection', 'person', 'mirror', 'episode', 'also', 'showcased', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'set', 'designs', 'well', 'time', 'period', 'Sam', 'lept', 'was', 'recreated', 'very', 'effectively', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'also', 'managed', 'keep', 'suspense', 'fact', 'always', 'knew', 'Sam', 'would', 'save', 'day', 'However', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'succeeded', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'were', 'so', 'great', 'together', 'screen', 'could', 'literally', 'pass', 'best', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'best', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.It', 'been', 'officially', 'confirmed', 'nine', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'coming', 'DVD', 'June', '8', '2004', 'something', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'including', 'was', 'ever', 'show', 'deserved', 'be', 'DVD', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'yet', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'extras', 'will', 'be', 'show', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'episodes']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

The first season, though short (only nine episodes, since it was a mid-season replacement), introduced us quite eloquently to a wonderful, but too short-lived series (it should have gone on for a few more seasons).The quality with DVD's is unquestioned. The only problem with this one is pricing. You're paying the same price you would for a full 22/24 episode season. The three star rating has nothing to do with the series itself.  It?s just the valve of episodes ?to-pricing that brought it down in my estimation.  For the series itself, it?s easily a five star show.  My recommendation would be to wait before buying this. The price is bound to come down before too long. The first season does have some of the most outstanding episode, and after just the first episode, the viewer fully understands what the series is all about.Quantum Leap itself was one of the most innovative and outstanding series of all time the quality of the acting, and especially the writing, was top notch from the get-go. This series will not disappoint, and you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it.This series should have been released on DVD a long time ago.

612227,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JM3A,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[20, 22]","One of the most critically-acclaimed and beloved sci-fi dramas of all-time, Quantum Leap (which aired on NBC for 5 seasons from 1989 - 1993) launches anew with the DVD release of its 9 episode first season.THE STORYQuantum Physicist, super genius and all-around good old boy, Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula, lately of Star Trek: Enterprise) spear heads a time travel project and ""leaps back"" in time helping put right small events in people's past that went wrong.  Helping out Sam on his leaps is his friend and observer Al (Dean Stockwell) and the projects Super Computer Ziggy.  In the meantime Sam continues to leap throughout time helping others always hoping that his next leap will be the leap home.ABOUT SEASON ONE:Season One, as is expected, introduces us to the basic premise of the show and all the characters.  We meet Sam and experience along with him all the little intricacies and problems time travel and leaping into other people's lives brings (not knowing people's names or where to go or what to do).  We also learn a great deal about the characters of Sam Beckett and Al Calavicci.THE EPISODES AND DISCSHere are the 9 episodes of Season One.Disc 1Episode 1:  ""Genesis"" - Jump starting the project without approval, Sam leaps into the Quantum Accelerator and wakes up as someone else, not remembering who or what he is and finds out that he's an Air Force test pilot trying to break Mach 3 - and he doesn't know how to fly!!!Episode 2:  ""Star-Crossed"" - Sam leaps into a literature professor and has to juggle an affair the Prof is having with an obsessed student, her jealous wrestler boyfriend AND an opportunity to have an influence on the brilliant young physics major who would one day leave Sam waiting at the altar.Disc 2Episode 3:  ""The Right Hand of God"" - Sam leaps into a young boxer who's scheduled to fight for the State Heavyweight championship and an opportunity to win prize money to help a group of nuns build a church as well as start up a donut shop for the boxer and his girlfriend.Episode 4:  ""How The Tess Was Won"" - Sam leaps into a Texas veterinarian and must ""out cowboy"" a strong-headed woman who will only marry a man who can best her.Episode 5:  ""Double Identity"" - Sam leaps into a Mafia hit-man who's having an affair with the Don's girlfriend.  Oh boy...Disc 3Episode 6:  ""The Color of Truth"" - Sam leaps into a Black chauffeur in the Deep South BEFORE the Civil Rights movement starts and must deal with the prejudice of the townsfolk as Sam does some ""illegal"" activities only meant for White people.Episode 7:  ""Camikazi Kid"" - Sam leaps into a teenage hot rod racer in the 50's who must convince his sister to NOT marry her boyfriend who's destined to grow up into an abusive alcoholic.Episode 8:  ""Play It Again Seymour"" - Sam leaps into a gumshoe detective (who looks an awful lot like Humphrey Bogart) and must solve a murder mystery before times up especially since in the original history HIS character winds up as a victim.  Tons of Casablanca and gumshoe jokes abound.THE EXTRAS1. Each Episode contains a brief introduction by series star Scott Bakula detailing some unique fact about the episode.  You can choose to turn intros ""on"" or ""off.""2. ""A Kiss With History:  Remembering Quantum Leap"" -  located on Disc 1 is a 20-minute featurette featuring commentary by series' leads Scott Bakula, Dean Stockwell and producer Donald Bellisario discussing how the show came about and going over some of the events of Season One.THE VERDICTFor 5 seasons fans everywhere thrilled week in and week out as Sam leaped through time helping people put events in there lives that went wrong right.  With a thrilling combination of action, suspense, adventure, a little romance and a TON of moral self-checks (and tackling some sticky issues) ""Quantum Leap"" grew into a favorite with a strong fan-base of Loyal Leapers.  Take a Leap into the Quantum Accelerator and go along with Sam for a ride through time and reminisce (or find out for the first time) what all the excitements about.Highest Recommendation",5,Oh Boy!!!!,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,4051,"['One', 'most', 'critically-acclaimed', 'beloved', 'sci-fi', 'dramas', 'all-time', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'aired', 'NBC', '5', 'seasons', '1989', '1993', 'anew', 'DVD', 'release', '9', 'episode', 'first', 'season.THE', 'STORYQuantum', 'Physicist', 'super', 'genius', 'all-around', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'lately', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'spear', 'time', 'travel', 'project', 'leaps', 'back', 'time', 'helping', 'put', 'right', 'small', 'events', 'people', 'past', 'went', 'wrong', 'Helping', 'out', 'Sam', 'leaps', 'friend', 'observer', 'Al', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'projects', 'Super', 'Computer', 'Ziggy', 'meantime', 'Sam', 'leap', 'time', 'helping', 'others', 'always', 'hoping', 'next', 'leap', 'will', 'be', 'leap', 'home.ABOUT', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'Season', 'One', 'expected', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'characters', 'meet', 'Sam', 'experience', 'along', 'little', 'intricacies', 'problems', 'time', 'travel', 'leaping', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'brings', 'not', 'knowing', 'people', 'names', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'do', 'also', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'characters', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'Al', 'Calavicci.THE', 'EPISODES', 'AND', 'DISCSHere', 'are', '9', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One.Disc', '1Episode', '1', 'Genesis', 'Jump', 'starting', 'project', 'approval', 'Sam', 'Quantum', 'Accelerator', 'up', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'remembering', 'who', 'what', 'out', 'Air', 'Force', 'test', 'pilot', 'trying', 'break', 'Mach', '3', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'fly', 'Episode', '2', 'Star-Crossed', 'Sam', 'literature', 'professor', 'juggle', 'affair', 'Prof', 'having', 'obsessed', 'student', 'jealous', 'wrestler', 'boyfriend', 'opportunity', 'have', 'influence', 'brilliant', 'young', 'physics', 'major', 'who', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'leave', 'Sam', 'waiting', 'altar.Disc', '2Episode', '3', 'Right', 'Hand', 'God', 'Sam', 'young', 'boxer', 'who', 'scheduled', 'fight', 'State', 'Heavyweight', 'championship', 'opportunity', 'win', 'prize', 'money', 'help', 'group', 'nuns', 'build', 'church', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'donut', 'shop', 'boxer', 'girlfriend.Episode', '4', 'How', 'Tess', 'Was', 'Won', 'Sam', 'Texas', 'veterinarian', 'must', 'out', 'cowboy', 'strong-headed', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'only', 'marry', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'best', 'her.Episode', '5', 'Double', 'Identity', 'Sam', 'Mafia', 'hit-man', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'Don', 'girlfriend', 'Oh', 'boy', 'Disc', '3Episode', '6', 'Color', 'Truth', 'Sam', 'Black', 'chauffeur', 'Deep', 'South', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'starts', 'must', 'deal', 'prejudice', 'townsfolk', 'Sam', 'illegal', 'activities', 'only', 'meant', 'White', 'people.Episode', '7', 'Camikazi', 'Kid', 'Sam', 'teenage', 'hot', 'rod', 'racer', '50', 'who', 'must', 'convince', 'sister', 'NOT', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'destined', 'grow', 'up', 'abusive', 'alcoholic.Episode', '8', 'Play', 'Again', 'Seymour', 'Sam', 'gumshoe', 'detective', 'who', 'awful', 'lot', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'must', 'solve', 'murder', 'mystery', 'times', 'up', 'especially', 'original', 'history', 'HIS', 'character', 'up', 'victim', 'Tons', 'Casablanca', 'gumshoe', 'jokes', 'EXTRAS1', 'Episode', 'brief', 'introduction', 'series', 'star', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'detailing', 'unique', 'fact', 'episode', 'can', 'choose', 'turn', 'intros', 'off.', '2', 'Kiss', 'History', 'Remembering', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'located', 'Disc', '1', '20-minute', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'commentary', 'series', 'leads', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'producer', 'Donald', 'Bellisario', 'discussing', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'about', 'going', 'events', 'Season', 'One.THE', 'VERDICTFor', '5', 'seasons', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'thrilled', 'week', 'week', 'out', 'Sam', 'leaped', 'time', 'helping', 'people', 'put', 'events', 'went', 'wrong', 'right', 'thrilling', 'combination', 'action', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'little', 'romance', 'TON', 'moral', 'self-checks', 'tackling', 'sticky', 'issues', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'grew', 'favorite', 'strong', 'fan-base', 'Loyal', 'Leapers', 'Take', 'Leap', 'Quantum', 'Accelerator', 'go', 'along', 'Sam', 'ride', 'time', 'reminisce', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'excitements', 'about.Highest', 'Recommendation']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season
612228,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B00005JM3A,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[2, 6]","This review is for the show as a whole, all five seasons. Quantum Leap has a wonderful time travel premise, supported by terrific acting and the endearing main characters of Sam Beckett and his holographic friend Al. The different situations and eras each week that Sam leaps into, often hold the viewer's interest due to their diversity. The real compelling force here, however, is the multi-talented Scott Bakula. His range as a good athlete, tuneful singer, and arresting actor is potent enough to have given this show a 5 star rating.The problem is, some of the more socially significant and moving themes (mostly related to racism, many to the Vietnam war, and some to sexism) are interspersed with silly, stupid, ""throw-away"" episodes. My bigger problem relates to the excessive violence in at least one-third of the episodes. I think the tension could have been sustained without all that blood and gore.Season 5 really falls apart, both in the shoddiness of the presumed science and in the failure of the writers to tie up loose ends (probably because it wasn't clear whether or not the series would continue). The uneven plots, the illogical premises, and the gore all bring down the rating to 3 stars.Nevertheless, this is a show worth watching, if for no other reason than Bakula's stunning acting.",3,"Falters somewhat, but interesting premise and Scott Bakula is FABULOUS",1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1309,"['review', 'show', 'whole', 'five', 'seasons', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'wonderful', 'time', 'travel', 'premise', 'supported', 'terrific', 'acting', 'endearing', 'main', 'characters', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'holographic', 'friend', 'Al', 'different', 'situations', 'eras', 'week', 'Sam', 'often', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'due', 'diversity', 'real', 'compelling', 'force', 'here', 'however', 'multi-talented', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'range', 'good', 'athlete', 'tuneful', 'singer', 'arresting', 'actor', 'potent', 'enough', 'have', 'given', 'show', '5', 'star', 'rating.The', 'problem', 'more', 'socially', 'significant', 'moving', 'themes', 'mostly', 'related', 'racism', 'many', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'sexism', 'are', 'interspersed', 'silly', 'stupid', 'throw-away', 'episodes', 'bigger', 'problem', 'excessive', 'violence', 'least', 'one-third', 'episodes', 'think', 'tension', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sustained', 'blood', 'gore.Season', '5', 'really', 'falls', 'apart', 'shoddiness', 'presumed', 'science', 'failure', 'writers', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'not', 'series', 'would', 'continue', 'uneven', 'plots', 'illogical', 'premises', 'gore', 'bring', 'down', 'rating', '3', 'stars.Nevertheless', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'reason', 'Bakula', 'stunning', 'acting']",Quantum Leap: The Complete First Season

In some ways it has worked out better because many historic facets woven into the narrative, and plenty of humour, makes more sense now.The brilliance of the Quantum Leap story concept hasn't been lost during the decades following the first season as it is wonderful to watch, and can take a viewer to a place where changing the past is reality.Nicholas R.W.

It's unfortunate that season one was a short 8-episode season, but that's not the fault of the people who put this disk collection together.  The only other problem I had was that when they try to cram as many episodes as possible on as few disks as possible, my dvd player doesn't always read them perfectly.  There are occassional skips or parts where the action stops for about 30 seconds before resuming.  This doesn't happen with other DVDs I own, so I am lead to believe it's due to so much info placed onto each disk.I've read some reviews that complained about them removing some of the original songs from certain episodes.  I didn't actually take note of that, probably because I wasn't aware of what the original songs were that were playing in the background on the jukebox in this or that episode.  To a die-hard fan who knows these bits of info, I can understand how that is kind of a cheap thing for the producers of this disk set to do.Overall I still think it's a worthwhile buy for any fan of the show.

I found one of them just before they went out of print and got it for $5.  Even though I could have turned it over for a 2000% profit, that disk has remained in my collection and been spun fairly regularly for several years.  That's how much I love this show!I missed Quantum Leap when it first ran and later discovered it when it was rerun on the Sci-Fi channel.  I actually reworked my work schedule so that I could be home on Thursday mornings and early afternoons to catch the marathons they would run every week.There is no substitute for good writing and Quantum Leap had some of the best around.  Science Fiction, and other genre type shows are generally looked down upon by ""serious"" minded folks.  My wife is a Trek nut and often boasts about the new frontier of television that show explored.  The first inter-racial kiss, comments on social issues including racism, the Cold War and a variety of other political hot spots were dramatized, but cloaked in a tasty little sci-fi treat that made everything a little easier to swallow.  Quantum Leap did away with the sugar coating and just forced us to look at the issues in our recent past.Through Sam we viewers were able to experience life as an elderly black man in the South just before Martin Luther King Jr rose to prominence, we spent time as a (very) attractive woman working in an office at the dawn of the feminist movement, walked through the jungles of Vietnam and even met God, or at least some one like him in a bar trapped in time.The chemistry shared between Bakula and Stockwell was amazing.  From the first episode it was apparent that these two characters loved and respected one another.  There was a history there unknown to the viewer and we needed to know more.Long and short of it, Quantum Leap was my favorite show of all time until Buffy the Vampire Slayer came around.

When I was in my 5th year of gradeschool the series finale aired. Ever since, I have been using every chance I get to catch an episode on some friends' cable (as I sadly don't have my own). This DVD is a godsend! Along with The Wonder Years, MacGyver and Star Trek: The Next Generation, Quantum Leap is one of those shows I grew up with and will always remember with fondness. And ever since I discovered the music and story of The Beatles, The Wonder Years and Quantum Leap have given me an even greater nostalgia.Years after I had seen it, when I discovered The Beatles, I remembered this particular episode: Sam had traveled back in time to the late 1960's, Vietnam hotpot, he was himself at a younger age! In the show, his sister was a Beatles fan and he told her that The Beatles would break up in 1970 but that John Lennon would go on to have a great solo career. Then, he took out a guitar and proceeded to play and sing &quot;Imagine&quot;. I was a very young child when I saw this, with no real idea of who The Beatles or John Lennon were, and still I remember this episode!Quantum Leap was a fantastic and progressive show, everything looked so real and the stories were very compelling! Sam traveled through many segments of time, became involved in famous or simple situations, had run-ins with some life-changing legends of the time and always helped to change many peoples' life for the best! It was a great show and probably expressed a dream many of us have had: taking a trip through history and possibly changing the outcome of certain situations!

I'm not sure if the series was detoured by rights issues or not but I'm happy something other than the pilot (which was released on DVD 5 years ago) is finally available. ""Quantum Leap"" chronicles the adventures of scientist Sam Beckett. Sam discovers a unique loophole in the laws of physics that lets him travel back in time but only within his life time. The device he uses with the input of Ziggy his intelligent computer allows him to assume the shape and look of individuals from the time he's in. They're transported back to a waiting room where they evidently will have no memory of being replaced.Trouble occurs on Sam's first attempt. He becomes stranded in the past appearing as a test pilot. Al a friend of Sam's who is also working on the project appears to help him through his predicament as a hologram visible only to Sam. The other problem is that Sam's memory gets turned into a maze of Swiss cheese by the transport. He can't recall who he is or how he got there. Al has to coach Sam and help him through the charade of being someone else until they can get him back. Unfortunately, Ziggy isn't able to get him back although Ziggy does figure out that Sam continues to hop through the time line to set things right that have gone wrong and that, ultimately, one of them will lead him home.An imaginative, well written show ""Quantum Leap"" managed to stay alive for 5 years. Bellisaro's imaginative concept, like that of  Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" allowed him to focus on the characters of the show. The format also allowed Bellisaro to tackle a number of difficult themes on television without seeming to be preachy. The top flight direction and acting makes the show believable. Bakula's stage training made him a natural to play Sam who has to ""inhabit"" all these different characters while, essentially, remaining the same one. While the optical effects haven't always aged the best, the show was really about the dramatic conflict at the core of each episode and what Sam has to accomplish.""Quantum Leap"" receives a very nice transfer courtesy of Universal's in house company. The images are sharp, crisp and the colors alive. The series was originally mastered in 2.0 stereo sound when it was originally aired and the sound here is true to the original specs of the series. There's an occasion where you might see dirt, hair or scratches but usually that's in situations where the film uses stock footage.Few extras but they are noteworthy. We get a short featurette featuring star Bakula and the gifted Dean Stockwell as well as creator/writer/producer Bellisario. Their insights into what made the series connect with their core audience are interesting and getting the background on the series from Bellisario provides insight into the creative process that helped this series make it to the air. We also get brief introductions to the 8 episodes included here. The series was originally a mid-season replacement and, as such, there wasn't a full slate of episodes produced during the first season. We also get a trivia game that isn't bad particularly for hardcore fans of the series.No commentary on any of the episodes but that might have been useful for the pilot. I'd love to hear what Bellisario, Bakula and Stockwell think 15 years later.A great series receives so-so treatment on DVD. Lord knows what Universal was thinking when they priced this three disc set. Considering the few extras, there's no justifying the expense of this on DVD. On the other hand, fans will be happy to finally have this on DVD after having to endure reruns that were frequently edited to include more commercials. Hopefully Universal will price the next set (which consists of a full season of episodes) at a comparable price but I doubt it.
