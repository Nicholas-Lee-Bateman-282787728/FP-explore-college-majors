1129344,A2GK7QG6O5OKZ4,B001139ZGA,Alan clayton,"[1, 1]","Four Loren movies on one disc, because Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow is a portmanteau film, comprising three tales, the first the most successful and blessed with a marvellously confident and knowing performance by Loren. This coloured and letterboxed film is from the populist rather than serious side of director De Sica's work, and the print quality is quite good although the disc is not anamorphic. A three + star film in a 4 star copy. Two Women is a  five star film in a 1 star (at best) copy. Possibly the high-point of Loren's career, and one of De Sica's finest, a half way decent print seems impossible to obtain with English subtitles, and even the Medusa restoration (La Ciociara), which seems very fine but is without subtitles, seems withdrawn from circulation. Originally distributed by MGM, this print has lost that logo and is a very long way removed from the original circulated prints, although like the original UK release, it is dubbed, though Loren does dub herself' albeit with imperfect lip-synch. Enthusiasts may wish to explore the colour remake which again had an older Loren in the same role, and which fills in most of the narrative gaps in the original film.",3,An awkward pairing,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1189,"['Four', 'Loren', 'movies', 'one', 'disc', 'Yesterday', 'Today', 'Tomorrow', 'portmanteau', 'film', 'comprising', 'three', 'tales', 'first', 'most', 'successful', 'blessed', 'marvellously', 'confident', 'knowing', 'performance', 'Loren', 'coloured', 'letterboxed', 'film', 'populist', 'rather', 'serious', 'side', 'director', 'De', 'Sica', 'work', 'print', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'disc', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'three', '+', 'star', 'film', '4', 'star', 'copy', 'Two', 'Women', 'five', 'star', 'film', '1', 'star', 'best', 'copy', 'Possibly', 'high-point', 'Loren', 'career', 'one', 'De', 'Sica', 'finest', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'print', 'impossible', 'obtain', 'English', 'subtitles', 'even', 'Medusa', 'restoration', 'La', 'Ciociara', 'very', 'fine', 'subtitles', 'withdrawn', 'circulation', 'Originally', 'distributed', 'MGM', 'print', 'lost', 'logo', 'very', 'long', 'way', 'removed', 'original', 'circulated', 'prints', 'original', 'UK', 'release', 'dubbed', 'Loren', 'dub', 'imperfect', 'lip-synch', 'Enthusiasts', 'may', 'wish', 'explore', 'colour', 'remake', 'again', 'had', 'older', 'Loren', 'same', 'role', 'most', 'narrative', 'gaps', 'original', 'film']",N/A
1129345,A281387UUS2IN5,B001139ZGA,Beantown Jim,"[1, 1]","Sophia Loren was arguably the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen.  She also was a fine actress.  Most sexy starlets have only a limited range whereas Sophia could be the trophy wife, the housewife, the starlet, the harlot.  She could love, hate, the full gamut.  But, always, all men, and some women, would go back to that incredible visage and that figure.The DVD contains a poor print of Two Women, a film you must see, though you would never want to see it again.  It is riveting as it tells the story of two women 'thrown to the troops' during a war.  We get a small snapshot look into the face of the refugee.The other film is Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow. The print is adequate, not great.  In the film, Sophia has 3 roles.  First she is a welfare mom in Italy pumping out babies to keep on the government dole and out of jail.  Poor Marcello Mastroanni is the overworked husband.  If family life with Sophia is something you can dream about (like me), then the film is not only funny but pretty darn hot too.The next film is much more lightweight: Sophia is a kept woman who entertains clients such as Marcello.  This is the film where she does a striptease for him (and us.)  That really is all this part of the film offers, but that's plenty.The final part of the film (Y,T&T;) is a powerful portrayal of the life of a modern woman.  Sophia has flashbacks to her life as harlot, mother, etc.  We see her full range of acting emotion and it is memorable.",5,It's Sophia!,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,1482,"['Sophia', 'Loren', 'was', 'arguably', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'also', 'was', 'fine', 'actress', 'Most', 'sexy', 'starlets', 'have', 'only', 'limited', 'range', 'whereas', 'Sophia', 'could', 'be', 'trophy', 'wife', 'housewife', 'starlet', 'harlot', 'could', 'love', 'hate', 'full', 'gamut', 'always', 'men', 'women', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'incredible', 'visage', 'figure.The', 'DVD', 'poor', 'print', 'Two', 'Women', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'riveting', 'story', 'two', 'women', ""'thrown"", 'troops', 'war', 'get', 'small', 'snapshot', 'look', 'face', 'refugee.The', 'other', 'film', 'Yesterday', 'Today', 'Tomorrow', 'print', 'adequate', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'Sophia', '3', 'roles', 'First', 'welfare', 'mom', 'Italy', 'pumping', 'out', 'babies', 'keep', 'government', 'dole', 'jail', 'Poor', 'Marcello', 'Mastroanni', 'overworked', 'husband', 'family', 'life', 'Sophia', 'something', 'can', 'dream', 'then', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'pretty', 'darn', 'hot', 'too.The', 'next', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'lightweight', 'Sophia', 'kept', 'woman', 'who', 'clients', 'such', 'Marcello', 'film', 'where', 'striptease', 'really', 'part', 'film', 'offers', 'plenty.The', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'Y', 'T', 'T', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'life', 'modern', 'woman', 'Sophia', 'flashbacks', 'life', 'harlot', 'mother', 'etc', 'see', 'full', 'range', 'acting', 'emotion', 'memorable']",N/A

I don't know what's worse the audio (can it be called audio?) or the video. It's like 5th or 6th generation VHS; not worth a thin dime. The movie is streamable online and I cannot imagine it being worse. It is a highly cynical thing, to manufacture and sell any film in this condition.

1129347,A3L9WR7LGB4ZZV,B001139ZGA,KSArnold,"[0, 0]",I got this fairly cheap so I figured it was worth a try.  Two women is a very good drama set it war torn Italy.  I had seen it many years ago on tv but did not remember it too well.  Sophia is very good in it.  She is still pretty even when dirty from being on the road.  The other movie I did not care much for although Sophia is prettier in it.  She does a bit of a strip in it but it is very tame.,4,Who doesn't like Sophia Loren?,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,400,"['got', 'fairly', 'cheap', 'so', 'figured', 'was', 'worth', 'try', 'Two', 'women', 'very', 'good', 'drama', 'set', 'war', 'torn', 'Italy', 'had', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'tv', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'too', 'well', 'Sophia', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'pretty', 'even', 'when', 'dirty', 'being', 'road', 'other', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'Sophia', 'prettier', 'bit', 'strip', 'very', 'tame']",N/A

Her acting is more powerful than most Actresses can do these days.  In real life Ms. Loren had lived through the horrors of war,  and she had to reopen many of those terrible memories to do this film.  And she did.  This is a movie you will never forget!Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow was another great movie.  not as powerful as Two Women,  but great in it's own way.  Sophia and Marcello had magic chemistry between them,  and this film really shone with it.  Ms. Loren showed to the world that she can do many different scenes,  like humor which is hard for anyone to do.  And her Strip Tease act was hot.
