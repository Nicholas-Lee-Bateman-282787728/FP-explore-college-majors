961713,A3CTNILCZ3U2LG,B000CRR3GA,"Barry Hampe ""Author: 'Making Documentary Film...","[5, 5]","Director Mel Stuart has given us a wonderfully observed year in the life of a fifth grade class. Their teacher, Rafe Esquith, has challenged the students to pursue excellence in whatever they do. And one of the many ways they do this is by learning and staging one of Shakespeare's plays. In this year it is ""Hamlet."" But this is not a ""Hey, kids, let's put on a show"" story. It's an exploration of what happens when a teacher is willing to challenge his students (and works hard to do so) and the students accept the challenge. And it all takes place in a public school in a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles.What makes this film special is that it is not a journalist report, heavy on interviews and narration. It is a behavioral documentary that lets us experience the lives of the children. It's terrific.",5,"In the pursuit of excellence, wonderful things can happen",1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,808,"['Director', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'given', 'wonderfully', 'observed', 'year', 'life', 'fifth', 'grade', 'class', 'teacher', 'Rafe', 'Esquith', 'challenged', 'students', 'pursue', 'excellence', 'do', 'one', 'many', 'ways', 'do', 'learning', 'staging', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'year', 'Hamlet', 'not', 'Hey', 'kids', 'let', 'put', 'show', 'story', 'exploration', 'what', 'when', 'teacher', 'willing', 'challenge', 'students', 'hard', 'do', 'so', 'students', 'accept', 'challenge', 'place', 'public', 'school', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'Los', 'Angeles.What', 'film', 'special', 'not', 'journalist', 'report', 'heavy', 'interviews', 'narration', 'behavioral', 'documentary', 'experience', 'lives', 'children', 'terrific']",The Hobart Shakespeareans

Surkan,"[1, 1]","The truly inspirational aspect of this film and the teacher it presents is not that it is a cookie cutter mold for all teachers to follow, but that it demonstrates how teachers can bring their individual passions to bear in a classroom to ultimately achieve much more than high test scores. More impressive to me than the fact that this teacher achieves unabridged Shakespeare productions with 5th graders is that he helps his students learn to be self-disciplined, hard-working individuals, motivated from within, rather than without. This is his greatest achievement in my eyes. I have seen him in person, along with his students, and was impressed by their mutual authenticity. He is very candid with respect to his own shortcomings and his opinions of things around them, which may offend some. He is understandably proud of his achievements as a teacher, and does not try to propose that all teachers copy him. For those that are interested in understanding and learning from what he does, he is happy to share.",5,Educating the broader child...,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1016,"['truly', 'inspirational', 'aspect', 'film', 'teacher', 'not', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'mold', 'teachers', 'follow', 'how', 'teachers', 'can', 'bring', 'individual', 'passions', 'bear', 'classroom', 'ultimately', 'achieve', 'much', 'more', 'high', 'test', 'scores', 'More', 'impressive', 'fact', 'teacher', 'unabridged', 'Shakespeare', 'productions', '5th', 'graders', 'students', 'learn', 'be', 'self-disciplined', 'hard-working', 'individuals', 'motivated', 'rather', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'eyes', 'have', 'seen', 'person', 'students', 'was', 'impressed', 'mutual', 'authenticity', 'very', 'candid', 'respect', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'opinions', 'things', 'may', 'offend', 'understandably', 'proud', 'achievements', 'teacher', 'not', 'try', 'propose', 'teachers', 'copy', 'are', 'interested', 'understanding', 'learning', 'what', 'happy', 'share']",The Hobart Shakespeareans

961716,AJBFQP2JXBX6Q,B000CRR3GA,John Bonavia,"[7, 7]","If only we had more teachers like this truly dedicated man. He has rejected many offers of a ""better"" position to stay in his same role at the Hobart school teaching 9- and 10-year-olds from a poor district in LA. In the year that was filmed, the kids work up and put on a performance of Hamlet - and these are kids who, when Rafe visited their families, he found that no-one even knew who Shakespeare was! The kids comment how at the beginning of the project they could not understand a word. He worked tirelessly to bring them along to the point where Sir Ian McKellen, visiting, says that they all clearly understand everything they are saying ""which is not the case with all Shakespeare actors!""But the play is really a peg on which to hang Rafe's overarching philosophy, which is one of challenge, of opening minds - trips to Washington and UCLA to light the spark of ambition, for instance. In fact, Hamlet itself does not occupy that much of the time of the film. More attention is paid to Rafe's focus on teaching the children to believe in themselves, to respect each other, to work hard. Yet he is realistic: a possibly surprising moment is when he acknowledges that yes, some children will be left behind and there is not much to be done about it. He knows his class will contain three groups: those will readily ""get it,""  those who may or may not decide to join in, and those who he just won't be able to reach. His hope is to shift many of the second group into the first. Then, with that majority, the tone of the classroom will discourage the ""non-participants"" from making trouble.The documentary focuses strongly on the positive. I'm sure there were disheartening scenes that could have been included. But the result is a really  heartwarming story, wonderful to watch...and the children are adorable. Think where they come from - and next time someone talks dismissively about ""inner-city kids,"" remember this film.",5,"Inspiring,  moving",1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,1934,"['only', 'had', 'more', 'teachers', 'truly', 'dedicated', 'man', 'rejected', 'many', 'offers', 'better', 'position', 'stay', 'same', 'role', 'Hobart', 'school', 'teaching', '9-', '10-year-olds', 'poor', 'district', 'LA', 'year', 'was', 'filmed', 'kids', 'work', 'up', 'put', 'performance', 'Hamlet', 'are', 'kids', 'who', 'when', 'Rafe', 'visited', 'families', 'found', 'no-one', 'even', 'knew', 'who', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'kids', 'comment', 'how', 'beginning', 'project', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'word', 'worked', 'tirelessly', 'bring', 'along', 'point', 'where', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'visiting', 'clearly', 'understand', 'everything', 'are', 'saying', 'not', 'case', 'Shakespeare', 'actors', 'play', 'really', 'peg', 'hang', 'Rafe', 'overarching', 'philosophy', 'one', 'challenge', 'opening', 'minds', 'trips', 'Washington', 'UCLA', 'light', 'spark', 'ambition', 'instance', 'fact', 'Hamlet', 'not', 'occupy', 'much', 'time', 'film', 'More', 'attention', 'paid', 'Rafe', 'focus', 'teaching', 'children', 'believe', 'respect', 'other', 'work', 'hard', 'realistic', 'possibly', 'surprising', 'moment', 'when', 'yes', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'done', 'class', 'will', 'contain', 'three', 'groups', 'will', 'readily', 'get', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'decide', 'join', 'who', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'hope', 'shift', 'many', 'second', 'group', 'first', 'Then', 'majority', 'tone', 'classroom', 'will', 'discourage', 'non-participants', 'making', 'trouble.The', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'strongly', 'positive', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'disheartening', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'result', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'children', 'are', 'adorable', 'Think', 'where', 'come', 'next', 'time', 'someone', 'talks', 'dismissively', 'inner-city', 'kids', 'remember', 'film']",The Hobart Shakespeareans

He admits that he failed in his first years of teaching, watching as his former students failed in middle school.But somehow he recreated his teaching method and, in the process, has inspired countless children, gotten actors like Ian McKellan and Michael York to visit his classroom (!) and taught children who'd had teachers give up on them that they were not doomed to failure.

I was excited to find out that there was also a documentary out on him and his teaching methods and determination entitled ""The Hobart Shakespeareans.""  Upon seeing his teaching style up close, I continue to be awed by this teacher who works 12+ hour days with students from racially mixed backgrounds in an inner city neighborhood.  Yet his work pays off-his students typically score in the best 5% of students taking the SATs, and get accepted at both Ivy league and other colleges all over thw world.  Rafe's students get to attend national monuments and tours of college campuses due to funds from his private, non-profit organization ""Hobart Shakespeareans.""  At the end of every school year, his students put together a Shakespearean play in which they act, do sets for, music for, etc.  It is a moving documentary of the work of the most highly decorated teacher in the history of teaching.  It was wonderful to see what his students can do in and out of the classroom, and to see what Rafe seems to really be like.  I am in awe of this man, and boy do I wish I had his energy.My only fault with this documentary is that I wish the entire production of ""Hamlet"" by the HObart Shakespeareans had been shown as an option on the special features of this DVD.  I would have really liked to have seen the entire play that the kids worked so hard on. The clips do not do it justice.

He cares enormously about the value of each child and goes to great length to help them to develop intellectually, socially and morally.  He gives 110%, at least, of his energy and attention to the kids.  No wonder that so many of the graduates of Hobart Elementary have gone on to succeed in Ivy League schools and elsewhere.

He sometimes works 4 jobs simultaneously to underwrite extracurricular class activities.During filming a class through an entire academic year, the school is locked down from violence in the neighborhood. Rafe reassures the children they will not be allowed to walk home alone until the school is confident the children can be safe. Rafe turns to the camera sadly commenting on how calmly the children accept the news; violence and drugs are so familiar in their lives they resignedly keep themselves occupied until the lockdown terminates.Rafe establishes a Saturday Academy after children graduate from 5th grade to middle school bullying, peer pressure and academic discouragement, so middle schoolers may revisit the friendly atmosphere which celebrates their aspirations toward excellence.The last day of 5th grade Rafe responds to tears of farewell by enthusing about this as the start of exciting future moments. 5th grade is a single moment beginning a life of meaning based on courtesy and dedicated hard work. The other moments to come he helps them to see as even more challenging and rewarding to their honest striving, humiliry and compassion.Rafe nurtures effort, curiosity, questioning and caring among children of immigrant visa holders.

Paul Nurse Nobel Prize winning geneticist, President of Rockefeller University was rejected for a green card because of his birth certificate. Rafe helps these English as a second language children become Americans, appreciating hard won freedom and rewards for personal discipline.The documentary follows a class none of whom speak English at home. Hobart Asian and Hispanic 5th graders are exposed to the hush of a university library by Rafe who asks: who would like to study in a place like this someday? The children are in awe. He confides: YOU can get here, but there are no shortcuts, only hard work.When children try to share test answers, he speaks confidentially, respecting their privacy, pointing out that they only shortchange themselves by attempting shortcuts. He role models courteous adult conversation. Rafe projects an attitude of faith in their capacity to discover solutions to problems through restraint, hard work and individual reflectionDhamma Brothers.Esquith's classroom economy is based on earning [fake] money for attending class each day, paying for seats closer to the front of the room, paying a $50 penalty for not doing homework, bidding at auction for a Gibson guitar at the end of the year. Rafe: if I don't come to work, I don't get paid. Math is real.The children play music at Gettysburg, as background for Shakespeare's Hamlet, experience American culture through Halloween and Christmas parties at Rafe's home where the children share, cooperate, clean up after themselves, receive book gift certificates as their sole Christmas gifts, playing the equitable American game baseball.The children learn skepticism, challenge authority using scientific thinking (Huck decides to turn Jim in, the correct thing to do, right?), make decisions balancing options, engage in shared inquiry and moral deliberation, work hard to learn (classroom discipline is being prohibited from participating in class learning), critical thinking based onJunior Great Books Discussion Program for Elementary & High School Students: Series Five Complete Set of 5 Books (Crane, Virgil, Gogol, Sutcliff, Euripides, Bennett, Blake, Melville, Bunyan, Moliere, Twaine +).Scientific thinking slowly improves the mind through continuous questioning, testing, assessment of results and revision of successive approximations. Rafe Esquith provides the children an ethical foundation for respecting themselves and others, honest intellectual inquiry and effortful pursuit of making a difference. He role models integrity, honesty, dignity, compassion: I've told them Hobart Elementary is where possibility happens, if I were to leave then I'd be a hypcrite. Esquith rejects offers to teach elsewhere.Rafe also understands that you cannot reach every child: 1/3 will ""get it"", 1/3 will be unsure, 1/3 will resist and try to disrupt the classroom. Your job is to move the 1/3 who are unsure toward those who are enthusiastic, so the disruptive third will be less likely to prevent the other 2/3 from learning.5 stars highly recommended documentary

Nemeth,"[11, 12]","In this enormously entertaining and moving DVD, Rafe Esquith emerges as a remarkable teacher, the rare sort who combines the ability to amuse students with the will to hold them to the highest standards. His fifth grade class at Hobart Elementrary is shown as mostly eager to rise to the challenges he poses. Such a two-way educational street leads to magical results. These include not only reading the very books (e.g. ""Huck Finn,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,""etc.) most students don't encounter until high school, but even putting on a Shakespeare play each year. Not surprisingly, as we learn toward the end of the DVD, many of his students in later years go on to the finest colleges and universities.",5,"Where There's A Will, There's A Way",1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,702,"['enormously', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'DVD', 'Rafe', 'Esquith', 'remarkable', 'teacher', 'rare', 'sort', 'who', 'ability', 'amuse', 'students', 'will', 'hold', 'highest', 'standards', 'fifth', 'grade', 'class', 'Hobart', 'Elementrary', 'shown', 'mostly', 'eager', 'rise', 'challenges', 'Such', 'two-way', 'educational', 'street', 'leads', 'magical', 'results', 'include', 'not', 'only', 'reading', 'very', 'books', 'e.g', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'etc', 'most', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'encounter', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'putting', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'year', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'learn', 'end', 'DVD', 'many', 'students', 'later', 'years', 'go', 'finest', 'colleges', 'universities']",The Hobart Shakespeareans

I find the Bard' a bit hard to get into, but am facinated by the work attributed to him, and his tale.This documentary from a great Elementary School Teacher, getting 'Shakespeare' across to these young kids is super powerful.THREE other awsome related matters(1)  Tavis Smile & Cornell West visited China a couple of times, a couple of years ago, they went to some schools where the lower classes attend school, ANDTHEN VISITED THE PLACES WHERE THOSE KIDS LIVED. Words simply can't describe how special those 20 minutes or so of video show a world the we in the US couldn't imagine in our WILDEST DREAMS.(2)  Study the REAL story of who was 'ACTUALLY' William Shakespeare, the playwrite. HINT: Absolutely NO WAY, was it the guy that all the academics and everyone claims. That guy, William Shakespeare 'on-Stratford had a very public life, and did pretty well for himself, but his parents, wife, and children were all illiterate. AND IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE, there is no known correspondence between himself and ANYBODY ELSE.  The only known things every written by his own hand, are 6 indecipherable signatures, and most of them don't even look like signatures. Who really wrote those plays?  Amazing theories, but none of them are close to certain.(3)  PBS Special from 10 years ago, about democracy in China: Election for Class monitor/president in a Chinese Elementary School, which had never had such an election before, or ever even imagined such a thing.  A 1-hour slice of life that is a joy to watch.",5,"Riveting & Amazing, I saw this on PBS about 4 years ago, and it brought tears to my eyes, and still does after repeated viewings",1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,1599,"['other', 'things', 'have', 'Calif-Teaching-Credential', 'taught', 'briefly', 'San', 'Diego', 'LA', 'find', 'Bard', 'bit', 'hard', 'get', 'am', 'facinated', 'work', 'attributed', 'tale.This', 'documentary', 'great', 'Elementary', 'School', 'Teacher', 'getting', ""'Shakespeare"", 'young', 'kids', 'super', 'powerful.THREE', 'other', 'awsome', 'related', 'matters', '1', 'Tavis', 'Smile', 'Cornell', 'West', 'visited', 'China', 'couple', 'times', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'went', 'schools', 'where', 'lower', 'classes', 'attend', 'school', 'ANDTHEN', 'VISITED', 'THE', 'PLACES', 'WHERE', 'THOSE', 'KIDS', 'LIVED', 'Words', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'how', 'special', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'video', 'show', 'world', 'US', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'WILDEST', 'DREAMS', '2', 'Study', 'REAL', 'story', 'who', 'was', ""'ACTUALLY"", 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'playwrite', 'HINT', 'Absolutely', 'WAY', 'was', 'guy', 'academics', 'everyone', 'claims', 'guy', 'William', 'Shakespeare', ""'on-Stratford"", 'had', 'very', 'public', 'life', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'parents', 'wife', 'children', 'were', 'illiterate', 'IN', 'HIS', 'ENTIRE', 'LIFE', 'known', 'correspondence', 'ANYBODY', 'ELSE', 'only', 'known', 'things', 'written', 'own', 'hand', 'are', '6', 'indecipherable', 'signatures', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'signatures', 'Who', 'really', 'wrote', 'plays', 'Amazing', 'theories', 'none', 'are', 'close', 'certain', '3', 'PBS', 'Special', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'about', 'democracy', 'China', 'Election', 'Class', 'monitor/president', 'Chinese', 'Elementary', 'School', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'such', 'election', 'ever', 'even', 'imagined', 'thing', '1-hour', 'slice', 'life', 'joy', 'watch']",The Hobart Shakespeareans
