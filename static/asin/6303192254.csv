(What movie has ever followed a book accurately?)  Someone please tell me.  John Wayne plays his part well, and Geraldine Page is OK, but if anything, Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker might have been the most true-to-life performance of the film.As a huge John Wayne fan, I automatically have to rank this movie higher than it probably deserves.  I mean, who does westerns better than the Duke?  Nobody.  It's just too bad the western didn't hang around longer.  I don't suppose it's coincedence that when the Duke died, for all intents and purposes so did the western.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; are really the only two exceptions.In short, if you're a John Wayne fan, this movie is for you.  If you're not, I really don't think you'd like it.  For the Duke it's worth seeing (hey, isn't any movie with the Duke in it?), but other than him, no.",3,The Duke has done better,1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,978,"['am', 'avid', 'fan', 'Louis', 'LaMour', 'writing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'inaccuracy', 'book', 'What', 'movie', 'ever', 'followed', 'book', 'accurately', 'Someone', 'please', 'tell', 'John', 'Wayne', 'part', 'well', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'OK', 'anything', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Buffalo', 'Baker', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'true-to-life', 'performance', 'film.As', 'huge', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'automatically', 'have', 'rank', 'movie', 'higher', 'probably', 'mean', 'who', 'westerns', 'better', 'Duke', 'Nobody', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'western', 'did', ""n't"", 'hang', 'around', 'longer', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'coincedence', 'when', 'Duke', 'died', 'intents', 'purposes', 'so', 'did', 'western', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'exceptions.In', 'short', ""'re"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'Duke', 'worth', 'seeing', 'hey', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Duke', 'other']",Hondo VHS
362226,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303192254,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Hondo, 1953 filmA lone man approaches a water hole. Johnny warns his Mom. The man says he is a dispatch rider who lost his horse. Can he buy another one? The Apaches are restless. Hondo Lane will look at the two horses. [Would there be curtains in this lonely house?] His dog Sam is independent. Most people need someone. [Was that a stunt double?] Honda chose the wilder horse. Johnny learns to not pet a strange dog. Hondo shoes Mrs. Lowe's horses. He advises her to leave with her son, the Apaches are angry because the Whites broke the treaty. Hondo speaks about sensations, like smelling. Night falls, the wind rises. Hondo will sleep inside. He warns against an unloaded pistol in the house. [This dates this film!]He saddles up the next morning to leave. Hondo talks about his deceased wife. Is character more important than looks? [Usually.] Later Mrs. Lowe finds Apaches in her yard. Her boy is brave, like an Apache boy. The Apaches don their war paint. Hondo arrives at a town. He tells them C troop isn't returning. There is a disagreement in the tavern, ""his name is Lowe"". [Stirrups on an Indian horse?] Mrs. Lowe is offered a choice of husbands, her boy needs a father. Hondo returns to the Lowe ranch. He is followed by two white men, who are attacked by Apaches. Hondo continues to ride until he too is attacked by Apaches. Shots are fired, men fall. Hondo escapes but is pursued and captured! Is he a cougar or a coyote? Hondo will be tortured to death. But a photograph causes a change in plans. There is a duel with knives. [Was this movie originally made in 3D?] Hondo does not lose. The planting rains fall. Hondo is returned to Mrs Lowe (as her husband). The Apaches also return Sam.When Hondo recovers he offers advice on fishing. Can he teach Johnny to swim? Yes. [Don't try this at home, real life is not a movie.] Vittorio arrives to warn them about a battle. ""I love you"" says Mrs. Lowe to Hondo. A cavalry troop arrives to stay the night. [Is that lieutenant a relative?] They will escort the settlers to safety the next day. One men tells about finding two bodies and admires Hondo's new rifle. [A Winchester `73.] The cavalry troop continues on their mission, they follow orders. [What can settlers raise in this desert land?] Mrs. Lowe learns about Ed's death. She tells Hondo about Ed. The cavalry are retreating, they were beaten in a battle with Vittorio's Apaches. Vittorio was killed, his assurance of safety is no longer valid. The Apaches attack, the cavalry and settlers form a circle. One wagon breaks out successfully. Shots are fired, men fall. Hondo acquires another horse from a man who no longer needs it. The Apaches halt to select a new leader, this lets the cavalry and settlers escape. General Crook will arrive next month with a large force to pacify the Apaches. Hondo and Mrs. Lowe will move to southern California.This is an interesting movie for its treatment of native Americans. While still shown as an enemy, there is an attempt to humanize them and explain their actions. The classic Westerns often showed how a big landowner wanted to oppress homesteaders. There is no mention of any land grab in this movie, or the reason for the war on the Apaches. Was if over mineral rights or land? Or to protect friendly Indians? Any good history book will tell you more than fictional entertainment.

362230,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6303192254,Andre Dursin,"[4, 5]","Action-packed John Wayne western receives a Blu-Ray release that debuts, for the first time on home video, a proper widescreen presentation of ""Hondo.""Wayne plays a half-Indian Cavalry rider named Hondo who finds himself playing guardian angel to a frontierswoman (Geraldine Page, who garnered an Oscar nomination here in her first film role) whose husband has left her and their young son alone to fend for themselves in the New Mexico desert, where warring Apaches roam the landscape. Wayne favorite John Edward Grant adapted a Louis L'Amour story for this effective western, efficiently directed by John Farrow, with Ward Bond, Michael Pate and James Arness appearing in supporting roles.Out of circulation for many years, ""Hondo"" was originally shot in 3-D but hasn't reportedly been screened in its native format in years. While it's disappointing that Paramount's Blu-Ray edition isn't in 3-D, ""Hondo"" nevertheless makes an impressive debut in high-definition despite highly varied elements. When the image is at its best, the transfer is spectacular, offering strong colors and fine grain. There are stretches of the picture, however, where the image is notably blurry and seemingly processed with noise reduction, likely a response to opticals and/or damaged source materials. That said, despite its occasional visual discrepancies, the image is exceptionally good on balance. The audio, meanwhile, is much less distinguished, being presented in either a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD track that sounds too airy and lacks power, or a superior 2.0 Dolby TrueHD mono track that enhances the dialogue. The score, credited to Emil Newman and Hugo Friedhofer, comes off well, but there's a thinness to the dialogue that makes the 5.1 track in particular quite unappealing.A variety of insightful features are carried over from Paramount's prior DVD Special Edition, with an introduction from Leonard Maltin, commentary with Maltin and fellow Wayne experts, multiple featurettes and an HD trailer included.

I read somewhere that it had been released for DVD not to long ago. A very good movie that I really enjoyed. But then, no one tops ""The Duke""! I couldn't believe that I had never seen the movie before, altho the title was familiar to me. So I bought it and thoroughly enjoyed it. A typical John Wayne movie, full of action, some romance, adventure and some sadness. Also shows that the Indians were just as human as the White Establishment, of that time. I am so glad that I bought it and added it to my, not only collection of good Western movies, but my John Wayne collection as well. ""The Special Features"" was good on this DVD also. The little boy in this movie, tells of his (Lee Aaker) experience of working on this movie with John Wayne. Also, is very detailed of how the Apache people were treated when Geronimo surrendered. It is heartbreaking to know how the Native American Indians were and are treated, even today. The Apache and The Lakota Sioux tribes were the ones who fought so valiantly to keep their land and way of life, only to be demorialized by the white people who wanted to exterminate them. Change their whole lives because the white people wanted them to be what ""they"" thought they should be. It makes me quite Happy today to see that the Native American Tribes are relearning their own language and customs once again.

Her young son, Johnny, likes Hondo at once when he stops at their remote ranch to get some water and a horse after loosing his running from Apaches. Mrs. Lowe finds this hard to understand, because her family has always gotten along with the Apaches.Vittorio, the Apache warrior who shows up next, explains that the whites have violated the treaty, and threatens Mrs. Lowe. But Johnnie, only six, stands up to them bravely, and Vittorio makes him a blood brother, calls him Small Warrior, and agrees to protect him and Mrs. Lowe.How Hondo meets and eventually kills Mr. Lowe, helps the cavalry hold off the Apaches, and wins the heart of Angie, is a nice story but not all that unusual.

362237,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6303192254,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[3, 3]","At first glance, John Wayne's 1953 western, ""Hondo"", bears a remarkable similarity to another 1953 release, George Stevens' classic, ""Shane"". Both films open with an iconic stranger appearing out of the wilderness, spotted first by a young, impressionable boy. Both title characters arrive at homesteads in need of an 'extra pair of hands', and form unspoken bonds with the women of the households. Both Hondo and Shane have survival skills the families desperately need, even as the families fill a void in their own lives. But while Stevens' filmmoves at a slow, deliberate pace, meticulously creating a near-mythic vision, ""Hondo"" director John Farrow, working from a script by longtime Wayne scribe James Edward Grant (from Louis L'Amour story), cuts the exposition down to basics, giving the film a much leaner 'look', with a climax (actually directed by John Ford, as Farrow had scheduling problems with another film) that is so fast-paced that it can leave a viewer in 'midair', expecting more. As a result, ""Hondo"" isn't held in as high esteem as ""Shane"", but is certainly a rewarding, entertaining experience, with one of Wayne's best pre-""Searchers"" performances, and Geraldine Page earning an Oscar nomination in her film debut.Filmed in the broiling summer heat of Mexico, utilizing massive,cumbersome dual cameras to create 3-D (which both Wayne and Warner studio head Jack Warner felt was the wave of the future, but would be pass&eacute; by the film's release), the production was grueling, yet formed lasting friendships. Australian Michael Pate, playing the key role of historic Chiricahua Apache Chief, Vittorio, was stunned to find Wayne, during a dangerous riding sequence, running along, off-camera, to protect him if he fell (Wayne, impressed by the actor, would cast him, ten years later, as another Indian chief in ""McLintock!""). Several of Wayne's 'Stock Company' (Ward Bond, Paul Fix, James Arness, and Chuck Roberson) have roles (Bond's bearded, crusty 'Buffalo Baker' is a standout). John Ford, between films, vacationed in Mexico to visit Wayne and Bond, and was recruited (unbilled), to help direct.The only discordant note on the set was stage actress Page. Wayne had hoped to get Katharine Hepburn for the role of Angie Lowe, but the liberal actress wasn't comfortable working with the politically conservative Wayne at that time (during the ""Witch Hunt"" for suspected Communists in the film industry), and passed on the project (as would her long-time love, Spencer Tracy, in ""The High and the Mighty"", Wayne's next production).It would be 22 years before Hepburn and Wayne would finally team up together (in ""Rooster Cogburn""). Geraldine Page, picked by Farrow for her fresh, 'natural' look, carried her stage training and 'attitude' into the filming, which did little to endear her to the cast, and Wayne felt little chemistry between them (although her performance would be the most honored, by the film industry).With colorful characterizations, a chaste romance, plenty of action, and little of the obvious '3-D' gimmicks (only noticeable in the titles sequence, and two Indian fight scenes), ""Hondo"" was a HUGE hit when released, and has endured as one of John Wayne's most popular westerns.Best of the Special Edition DVD 'extras' is a wonderful ""Making of"" documentary, with comments by Pate and the film's juvenile lead, Lee Aaker; brief bios of writer Grant, and Ward Bond; and a revealing, VERY balanced Apache overview of both the film and the REAL Chiricahua Chief Vittorio.With nearly pristine image and sound quality, the ""Special Edition"" certainly lives up to expectations!",4,"Loner Wayne, Great Cast, in Rewarding Western...",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,3623,"['first', 'glance', 'John', 'Wayne', '1953', 'western', 'Hondo', 'remarkable', 'similarity', '1953', 'release', 'George', 'Stevens', 'classic', 'Shane', 'films', 'open', 'iconic', 'stranger', 'appearing', 'wilderness', 'spotted', 'first', 'young', 'impressionable', 'boy', 'title', 'characters', 'arrive', 'homesteads', 'need', ""'extra"", 'pair', 'hands', 'form', 'unspoken', 'bonds', 'women', 'households', 'Hondo', 'Shane', 'have', 'survival', 'skills', 'families', 'desperately', 'need', 'even', 'families', 'fill', 'void', 'own', 'lives', 'Stevens', 'filmmoves', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'meticulously', 'creating', 'near-mythic', 'vision', 'Hondo', 'director', 'John', 'Farrow', 'working', 'script', 'longtime', 'Wayne', 'scribe', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'story', 'exposition', 'down', 'basics', 'giving', 'film', 'much', 'leaner', ""'look"", 'climax', 'actually', 'directed', 'John', 'Ford', 'Farrow', 'had', 'scheduling', 'problems', 'film', 'so', 'fast-paced', 'can', 'leave', 'viewer', ""'midair"", 'expecting', 'more', 'result', 'Hondo', ""n't"", 'held', 'as', 'high', 'esteem', 'Shane', 'certainly', 'rewarding', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'one', 'Wayne', 'best', 'pre-', 'Searchers', 'performances', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'debut.Filmed', 'broiling', 'summer', 'heat', 'Mexico', 'utilizing', 'massive', 'cumbersome', 'dual', 'cameras', 'create', '3-D', 'Wayne', 'Warner', 'studio', 'head', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'felt', 'was', 'wave', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'pass', 'eacute', 'film', 'release', 'production', 'was', 'grueling', 'yet', 'formed', 'lasting', 'friendships', 'Australian', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'playing', 'key', 'role', 'historic', 'Chiricahua', 'Apache', 'Chief', 'Vittorio', 'was', 'stunned', 'find', 'Wayne', 'dangerous', 'riding', 'sequence', 'running', 'along', 'off-camera', 'protect', 'fell', 'Wayne', 'impressed', 'actor', 'would', 'cast', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Indian', 'chief', 'McLintock', 'Several', 'Wayne', ""'Stock"", 'Company', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'James', 'Arness', 'Chuck', 'Roberson', 'have', 'roles', 'Bond', 'bearded', 'crusty', 'Baker', 'standout', 'John', 'Ford', 'films', 'vacationed', 'Mexico', 'visit', 'Wayne', 'Bond', 'was', 'recruited', 'unbilled', 'help', 'direct.The', 'only', 'discordant', 'note', 'set', 'was', 'stage', 'actress', 'Page', 'Wayne', 'had', 'hoped', 'get', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'role', 'Angie', 'Lowe', 'liberal', 'actress', 'was', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'working', 'politically', 'conservative', 'Wayne', 'time', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'suspected', 'Communists', 'film', 'industry', 'passed', 'project', 'would', 'long-time', 'love', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'High', 'Mighty', 'Wayne', 'next', 'production', '.It', 'would', 'be', '22', 'years', 'Hepburn', 'Wayne', 'would', 'finally', 'team', 'up', 'together', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'picked', 'Farrow', 'fresh', ""'natural"", 'look', 'carried', 'stage', 'training', ""'attitude"", 'filming', 'did', 'little', 'endear', 'cast', 'Wayne', 'felt', 'little', 'chemistry', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'honored', 'film', 'industry', 'colorful', 'characterizations', 'chaste', 'romance', 'plenty', 'action', 'little', 'obvious', '3-D', 'gimmicks', 'only', 'noticeable', 'titles', 'sequence', 'two', 'Indian', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Hondo', 'was', 'HUGE', 'hit', 'when', 'released', 'endured', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'most', 'popular', 'westerns.Best', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'Making', 'documentary', 'comments', 'Pate', 'film', 'juvenile', 'lead', 'Lee', 'Aaker', 'brief', 'bios', 'writer', 'Grant', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'revealing', 'VERY', 'balanced', 'Apache', 'overview', 'film', 'REAL', 'Chiricahua', 'Chief', 'Vittorio.With', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'Special', 'Edition', 'certainly', 'up', 'expectations']",Hondo VHS

I wish this great one was available on DVD (When I wrote this it wasn't). I caught it on TV this weekend during a John Wayne marathon of movies. The acting, sets, directing, scenery, and music all stand out on this one. Many critics think ""The Searchers"" is great but although I think it is a wonderfully shot movie I don't think the interaction is as believable as ""Hondo"". The cast here does a wonderful job of making me believe what is happening and that I'm with them in that time period. John Furrow must have worked hard directing to get such results.The attitude towards Indians is much more appropriate as well. The camera work is excellent. Especially good with wide scenic shots and close-ups of the actors. The directing as I said before is excellent, and the scope of acting in this movie is some of the best I have seen in a John Wayne movie or any Western for that matter. Geraldine Page is great as the Duke's love interest. She does a magnificent job portraying a pioneer woman. Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and the rest the cast do a fine job supporting. I hope you get the opportunity to see it. I'm sure you will agree it is a top notch Western and it should be on DVD.As an addendum I want to thank the studio for finally releasing a wonderful quality DVD with several extras.

362247,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6303192254,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 1]","This is one of the best western movies of all time. It is based on the story of Hondo Lane by Louis L'Amour, which gives it a solid background from which to make a movie. The characters are the combination of quirky, spunky and noble that is a L'Amour trademark. John Wayne plays the title role of Hondo Lane, a man that is half Native American and lived for years with the Apaches.Geraldine Page plays a woman with a young boy living on an isolated ranch in the desert Southwest in Apache territory. The movie opens with Hondo Lane walking up to her place carrying a rifle and a bag. He lost his horse in an encounter with some Apaches and needs a mount in order to report to the local Army base. He befriends the woman's son and does some work on the ranch before borrowing a horse and leaving.The whites have violated the treaty they have with the Apaches so they are now on the warpath, killing settlers and preparing for a showdown with the U. S. Army. The chief of the Apaches is depicted as an honorable man, becoming a blood brother to the boy and promising to allow them to stay on the ranch in peace.There is a great deal of action and some romance in this movie but the strongest feature is how the situation and the Apaches are depicted. It is made clear that the whites broke the treaty that caused the Apaches to go to war and the Apaches are presented as being very honorable and noble in their own way. Hondo openly talks about how they are far more honest in their dealings with others than whites and given how so many westerns depicted the Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages, this is a breath of realism.Future veteran westerns stars Ward Bond and James Arness play supporting roles, so we see a glimpse of the future of television as well.

362250,AX8SWWB9837TA,6303192254,Chris Peters,"[5, 6]","This movie was much better than I expected, in that it has some real human beings dealing with some genuinely touching issues, mainly about honesty.  Hondo is primarily a character study, focusing on John Wayne, Geraldine Page, and an Apache war chief, and their bizarre triangle of friendship and honor during the Indian wars.  Hondo is one of the Duke's most macho roles - he's tougher and more unbending than I've ever seen him before.  Countering this is Page's terrible performance in a typically sexist role for a 1950's western (""A woman should know how to cook,"" booms the Duke like a commandment).  As their love grows, they argue about honesty... Wayne in typical Duke-ish fashion refuses to tell even a white lie.  Yet, in the end, 3 lies are told, one to save Wayne's life, one to save their love, and another to prevent Page's son from growing up with the true knowledge of his scoundrel father (which we today know is a bad idea).  Still, Hondo's unbending honesty also saves their lives from the Apaches, so we are left with a well-rounded, *adult* view of honesty that still holds its relevance today.I'm not sure why people complain about ""realism"" in these old movies - the Duke shoes his own horses right on film, no detail missed, as if he'd been doing it for years.  You'd never see that from an actor today!  The Apache indians are all played by Apache indians (including the leading roles) and their characters are all faithful to history.  Perhaps our modern ""notion"" of realism has changed.  The film has that washed-out nostalgic look in its coloring, but that was due to the technology of the time.  Of course, bad actors from the 1950's all seem to perform with the same annoying pace and vocal style, but I'm sure our modern equivallents will become apparent in 50 years, too.

362253,AUHG8KSHI529U,6303192254,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","This had been among one of the least seen of Wayne's best films because it had been locked away for a decade and a half.  I remember the ""Married With Children"" episode when Al wanted to catch a rare showing of this movie and, of course, his desires were thwarted.  Now you can see it any time you wish on this really good DVD.  The extras provide a good commentary on the film, some shorts on the making of the film and on Ward Bond.The film has a couple of really different aspects to it.  The most famous is that it was made in 3D, which was a big fad the year it was made.  This version of 3D was more sophisticated than the red-green glasses we get every now and again today, but I have never experienced this technology and have no idea what it is like.  For this film, very few people have seen it in 3D because it was only shown that way for the first week or two it was in very limited release.  The rest of the world saw it as it is presented on this DVD, in beautifully presented 2D.  One of the reasons this 3D film still works so well in 2D is that despite all the problems of filming in 3D (and they are explained in the extras), Farrow and Wayne only have a couple of concessions to the usually 3D gimmickry (the titles, the knife fight coming right at the camera, an arrow being shot, and maybe a couple of others).  Most of the time the extras explain that they used 3D to add depth to the shots which still work well when flattened.The other odd part of Hondo is casting Geraldine Page as the female lead.  She isn't particularly beautiful and in some way this makes her more believable.  We learn some things about her from the other cast members that add to the strangeness.  Apparently, she went to great lengths to stay in character including not bathing or brushing her teeth.  She was also very liberal and appalled by the conservative views of John Wayne and Ward Bond.  All this aside, what gets on the screen is very good and quite convincing.  That she was nominated for an Oscar(tm) for this role does seem a bit odd today, but not completely crazy.The story is set in Apache lands when the whites have yet again broken a treaty and the Indians are pushing back.  Hondo (Wayne) walks into Angie Lowe's (Page) ranch where she lives alone with her son, Johnny (Lee Aaker).  She won't leave her ranch even though the Army is evacuating all whites living in the Apache lands because too many are being killed.  She claims her husband will return soon, but Hondo is suspicious.  In return for a horse, Hondo does many domestic chores that need doing around the ranch.  One of the more famous scenes is his teaching Johnny how to swim and then finds out Angie can't swim either.  He and Angie quickly develop a strong affection, but she is married after all so he leaves and heads into town to report to the military.  He meets Angie's husband in the local saloon and learns that he is not what Angie portrayed him to be.  In fact, he has betrayed and abandoned her and is an all around bad individual.  Wayne's friend, Ward Bond, also has a very good role in the film as Buffalo Baker.I won't bother explaining how the plot develops, but there is a lot of interesting action with surprisingly sensitive plot developments.  The Indians are presented very sensitively for 1953 and we sympathize with them (except when they are after Hondo).  Their chief, Vittorio, is played quite convincingly by the Australian actor, Michael Pate.  The key action sequences at the end were, we learn from the extras, directed by John Ford and they are quite good.  This is a very good Waynestern and you should see it.  And if you have seen it recently, well, find an excuse to enjoy it again!Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,You can now enjoy one of the least known of Wayne's best films,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,3741,"['had', 'been', 'one', 'least', 'seen', 'Wayne', 'best', 'films', 'had', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'decade', 'half', 'remember', 'Married', 'Children', 'episode', 'when', 'Al', 'wanted', 'catch', 'rare', 'showing', 'movie', 'course', 'desires', 'were', 'thwarted', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'time', 'wish', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'extras', 'provide', 'good', 'commentary', 'film', 'shorts', 'making', 'film', 'Ward', 'Bond.The', 'film', 'couple', 'really', 'different', 'aspects', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'made', '3D', 'was', 'big', 'fad', 'year', 'was', 'made', 'version', '3D', 'was', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'red-green', 'glasses', 'get', 'now', 'again', 'today', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'technology', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'seen', '3D', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'way', 'first', 'week', 'two', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'rest', 'world', 'saw', 'presented', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'presented', '2D', 'One', 'reasons', '3D', 'film', 'still', 'so', 'well', '2D', 'problems', 'filming', '3D', 'are', 'explained', 'extras', 'Farrow', 'Wayne', 'only', 'have', 'couple', 'concessions', 'usually', '3D', 'gimmickry', 'titles', 'knife', 'fight', 'coming', 'right', 'camera', 'arrow', 'being', 'shot', 'maybe', 'couple', 'others', 'Most', 'time', 'extras', 'explain', 'used', '3D', 'add', 'depth', 'shots', 'still', 'work', 'well', 'when', 'flattened.The', 'other', 'odd', 'part', 'Hondo', 'casting', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'female', 'lead', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'way', 'more', 'believable', 'learn', 'things', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'add', 'strangeness', 'Apparently', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'stay', 'character', 'including', 'not', 'bathing', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'liberal', 'appalled', 'conservative', 'views', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'aside', 'what', 'screen', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'convincing', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'tm', 'role', 'seem', 'bit', 'odd', 'today', 'not', 'completely', 'crazy.The', 'story', 'set', 'Apache', 'lands', 'when', 'whites', 'have', 'yet', 'again', 'broken', 'treaty', 'Indians', 'are', 'pushing', 'back', 'Hondo', 'Wayne', 'Angie', 'Lowe', 'Page', 'ranch', 'where', 'alone', 'son', 'Johnny', 'Lee', 'Aaker', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'ranch', 'even', 'Army', 'evacuating', 'whites', 'living', 'Apache', 'lands', 'because', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'husband', 'will', 'return', 'soon', 'Hondo', 'suspicious', 'return', 'horse', 'Hondo', 'many', 'domestic', 'chores', 'need', 'doing', 'ranch', 'One', 'more', 'famous', 'scenes', 'teaching', 'Johnny', 'how', 'swim', 'then', 'out', 'Angie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', 'either', 'Angie', 'quickly', 'develop', 'strong', 'affection', 'married', 'so', 'heads', 'town', 'report', 'military', 'Angie', 'husband', 'local', 'saloon', 'not', 'what', 'Angie', 'portrayed', 'be', 'fact', 'betrayed', 'abandoned', 'bad', 'individual', 'Wayne', 'friend', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'film', 'Buffalo', 'Baker.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'explaining', 'how', 'plot', 'lot', 'interesting', 'action', 'surprisingly', 'sensitive', 'plot', 'developments', 'Indians', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'sensitively', '1953', 'sympathize', 'when', 'are', 'Hondo', 'chief', 'Vittorio', 'played', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'key', 'action', 'sequences', 'end', 'were', 'learn', 'extras', 'directed', 'John', 'Ford', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'Waynestern', 'should', 'see', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'well', 'find', 'excuse', 'enjoy', 'again', 'Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Hondo VHS

362260,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303192254,Dr. James Gardner,"[7, 10]","""Hondo"" is a 1953 3-D western. Westerns were extremely popular at the time, and 3-D was the studio's answer to the challenge of TV. The ""golden era"" of 3-D started with Bwana Devil in 1952 and ""House of Wax"" followed. Even Disney produced a 3-D cartoon (""Melody"") and the first 3-D western was released by Columbia (""Fort Ti""). 3-D faded as quickly as it began, and Hondo was also released in the 2-D version. You'll notice, when watching the film, that many of the scenes cater to the 3-D experience, including being stabbed by a knife and stuck with a lance.Hondo stars John Wayne with Geraldine Page, Ward Bond, Michael Pate, James Arness, and Paul Fix.Wayne was a major box office draw at the time, having appeared in such hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""They Were Expendable"" (1944), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), and ""Flying Leathernecks"" (1951). He was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949). ""Hondo"" was Wayne's 135th film.""Hondo"" was made at a time that Wayne was feeling his oats as an actor and a producer. He formed Batjac in 1952 and ""Big Jim McLain"" was his first film, made with Warners. Hondo followed shortly thereafter, and among Batjac's Wayne films were ""Cahill"" (1973), ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), ""The Green Berets"" (1968),  ""McQ"" (1974) and the only really good Batjac film, ""The Alamo"" (1960). Batjac also did the 1967 TV series ""Hondo"" in which Michael Pate resurrected his role as Chief Vittorio, and Batjac made several non-Wayne films like ""Cast a Giant Shadow"" (1966) with Wayne's buddy Kirk Douglas and ""Seven Men From Now"" (1956) with his friend and occasional co-star Gail Russell. ""Seven Men"" was originally intended for Wayne, but he was too busy and substituted Randolph Scott: together with Budd Boetticher, Scott made a whole slew of memorable B westerns in the 50s.Hondo comes at a time when artistically Wayne was at his peak. Some of his finest films were made at  this time, including ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), and ""The Searchers"" (1956).Geraldine Page made her screen debut in this film. She had been a popular stage actress, famous for working in ""the method"" and trained by Lee Strasberg. Just prior to making Hondo she appeared with James Dean on Broadway. For her work she would receive an Oscar nomination as ""Best Supporting Actress"", the only nomination the film would earn.Ward Bond plays a scout and long time friend of Wayne. Bond was a football player at USC with Wayne, and together they appeared in nearly a dozen films including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""3 Godfathers"" (1948), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Without Wayne, Bond was also a staple in John Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared (along with James Arness). Bond was in more  Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.James Arness was Marshall Dillon on TV's ""Gunsmoke"" from 1955 to 1975 and subsequently has returned every so often for various Gunsmoke TV movies. Before he put on the star for Dodge City, Arness was a film actor, appearing most notably as the monster in ""The Thing"" (1951). He got his big break from John Wayne who cast him in four films in the early 50s. In fact, the original role as Marshall Dillon was offered to Wayne who turned it down and suggested Arness.Paul Fix is best remembered as the Marshall in the TV series ""The Rifleman"" (1958 - 63), but he made more than 100 films and appeared on hundreds of TV shows. Fix was a teaching coach for the young Wayne and Wayne included him in 26 of his films, including ""Big Jim McCain"" (1952), ""Island in the Sky"" (1953), ""High and the Mighty"" (1954), ""The Sea Chase"" (1955), ""El Dorado"" (1966), and ""Cahill"" (1973).Michael Pate appears as an Indian chief. Born in Australia, Pate was a busy actor who made more than 50 films. His role as an Indian in Hondo was his first entry into this character, but it soon followed with many more such roles, including a spot on the TV series made in the 60s. Later in his career Pate was very busy in TV, appeared in more than 300 shows, often as a villain.Lee Aaker plays Page's son. Aaker is best remembered as Rusty from the TV show ""Rin Tin Tin"" (1954 - 9). At the time of ""Hondo"" he was a busy child actor with roles in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952), ""High Noon"" (1952), ""Atomic City"" (1952), and ""A Lion is in the Streets"" (1953). After his TV series he had trouble getting adult roles and retired from acting.John Farrow directs. Farrow was the father of actress Mia Farrow with Margaret O'Sullivan (Jane from the Tarzan films). Farrow was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning for ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956) and nominated for ""Wake Island"" (1942). Farrow worked with Wayne again in 1955 on ""The Sea Chase""The film will not disappoint John Wayne fans, and in fact it is one of his more romantic roles with lots of passionate kissing, a rare event in most Wayne films, especially in Wayne westerns.

The film itself rates a solid 4 or maybe even a 5. This film was released in late 1953, it was shot in 3-D but was shown in general release flat as the 3-D craze had run it's course. (Cinemascope was in.) This film's original aspect ratio is approximatly 1.37 to 1 despite Blu-ray.com's erroneous claim that it is 1.85 to 1.  I have both the 2005 DVD as well as this Blu-ray edition. The DVD edition is in its proper (non widescreen) form and believe me the cropping of the picture in the Blu-ray edition (top and bottom) is painfully obvious. I suppose Paramount wanted it to ""fit"" your 1.78 to 1 flat screen T.V. minus the black bars on the sides.  Well and good, but for all you folks who just have the Blu-ray edition, you are not seeing the ENTIRE film.  It puzzles me why Paramount would go to the trouble of doing a 4K scan only to block out a portion of the picture.

In all the westerns that have ever been made this one holds a special place for alot of western fans. the cast isn't really that special though its solid no one will make u go i didn't know they were in that, but if you are a fan of westerns this is a must haveThe AudioYou get 2 mixes on this disc a 5.1 surround sound mix and the standard mono. THe 5.1 is acceptible after all this movie was made in 1953. The gun shots are loud and clear no noise at all. The mono is unbearable its very quiet and there some noise in it.The VideoUnfourtanly this movie is made in full screen i beleive that is because at the time screens weren't 16x 9 so it was made that way if i am wrong i apologize it gives it that saturday western feel which ads to the feel of nostalgia. Its a good transfer not perfect it has soem grain and shows its age seems they rushed it just to get it on dvd. It clear for 90% though so acceptable for a 10 movie.

362275,A276M3NSIY9B82,6303192254,Harry Brewer,"[0, 0]","For 1953 Hondo was a brutal portrayal of the West. Hondo was based on a Louis L'Amour novel, in fact, it was the first novel that L'Amour had published & was also his first property to be transformed to the silver screen. The film was directed by John Farrow (father of Mia) & shot in Mexico. The screenplay was written by James Edward Grant, Wayne's favorite screenwriter.Hondo is a Western much in the classic vein but with an added realism that was unusual for 1953. In the opening scene we see Hondo (John Wayne) walking toward the camera, rifle in one hand, scabbard & saddlebags in the other hand. Near him is the dog, Sam, basically a wild dog who is in the company of Hondo. He happens on a ranch that has only Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) & her son Johnny (Lee Aker). Hondo is a scout for the cavalry & is returning to to report on the state of the Apaches who are preparing for war. Hondo stays around the ranch for a short period fixing up things for her. It's obvious to Hondo that Mrs. Lowe's husband hasn't been around for a long time. She continually lies about her husband but Hondo, straigt forward & honest, tells her she's lying. Later, Hondo meets Ed Lowe (Leo Gordon) & they take an immediate disliking to one another. Later Hondo kills Lowe in self-defense. This complicates things because Hondo & Mrs. Lowe end up falling in love.All of this is set against the backdrop of an Apache uprising & the Lowe ranch is in the middle of it. She has been on peaceful terms with them but Hondo warns her it's time for her & her son to leave. She chooses to stay. The Apache chief Vittorio (Michael Pate) is a significant role in the movie. He befriends Johnny renaming him Small Warrior. Vittorio wants Mrs. Lowe to pick one of the Apache warriors for a husband so that Johnny can be taught the Apache way. The movie features Ward Bond as Buffalo Baker, a scout like Hondo. James Arness has a small role as Lennie, another scout whom Hondo doesn't like. It all leads to the inevitable cowboy & Indian showdown.Some of this was shot in 3D but it's a very minuscule part. The movie has an introduction by Leonard Maltin who also appears in the rest of the special features. There's a feature entitled The Making of Hondo that features interviews with Michael Pate, Lee Aaker & western historian Frank Thompson.

I'm no western movie expert, as evidenced by the fact that I rank Hondo just below The Searchers in John Wayne's western canon. Some of the exchanges between Wayne and Paige are the most memorable ever to appear in cowboy cinema, and Sam the dog stands as one of the more memorable devices ever used to delineate his owner's character. That said, the film was compromised during shooting by the unfortunate 3-D process, which results in one shot being razor sharp and the next being out of focus, alternating throughout. It makes Hondo a bigger challenge to bring to Blu than How The West Was Won turned out to be, and, unfortunately, they blew it.There was never going to be any cure for blurred 3-D compositions, but having just viewed the Blu-Ray, I don't think this film really was composed for widescreen. It may have been composed in such a way that widescreen projection was possible, but seen in that aspect ratio the compositions are obviously crowded and cramped. The lost vertical information in this case includes necessary head room and landscape that feels 'missing', and figures cut off distractingly around elbow height, leading to a claustrophobic experience. Westerns are often the best argument in favour of widescreen presentation, restoring the grandeur of landscape vistas lost in pan and scan vhs transfers, but in this instance the top and bottom information we have lost to the imposition of a matte letterbox is absolutely as destructive. Those who continue to take issue with the Weary Professor's opinion on this matter should get out their old fullscreen dvds and simply have a look: I don't think there's any doubt that what we've been given here is a badly compromised Blu-ray that cries out for a replacement edition. The proof is that THE COMPOSITIONS LOOK BAD in widescreen, and look right in full frame. And given the amount of space available on a Blu-Ray, there's no excuse for the fullscreen print not having been made available on the same disc. We've lost picture, but not only that, by zooming the image we've lost resolution, the latter being something this movie really can't afford.In short, you aren't alone Professor. This release is a screw-up, and a bad one. I love widescreen, but this new trend toward shoehorning everything into widescreen just to fit our new TVs is every bit as destructive as the old practice of shearing the periphery of prints in order to get them to fit our old TVs. The fact is, in this case, rather than cutting out the grandeur of the vista, they've crowded the sky out over John Wayne's head. The effect is the same: to shrink the wide open spaces, and it really hurts the experience here. The framing is so tight that if the letterbox were any narrower the disc would go from disappointing to unwatchable.",3,"5 star movie, compromised Blu-Ray",1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2813,"['Weary', 'Professor', 'right', ""'m"", 'western', 'movie', 'expert', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'rank', 'Hondo', 'just', 'Searchers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'western', 'canon', 'exchanges', 'Wayne', 'Paige', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'ever', 'appear', 'cowboy', 'cinema', 'Sam', 'dog', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'devices', 'ever', 'used', 'delineate', 'owner', 'character', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'compromised', 'shooting', 'unfortunate', '3-D', 'process', 'results', 'one', 'shot', 'being', 'razor', 'sharp', 'next', 'being', 'focus', 'alternating', 'Hondo', 'bigger', 'challenge', 'bring', 'Blu', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'unfortunately', 'blew', 'it.There', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'cure', 'blurred', '3-D', 'compositions', 'having', 'just', 'viewed', 'Blu-Ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'composed', 'widescreen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'such', 'way', 'widescreen', 'projection', 'was', 'possible', 'seen', 'aspect', 'compositions', 'are', 'obviously', 'crowded', 'cramped', 'lost', 'vertical', 'information', 'case', 'necessary', 'head', 'room', 'landscape', ""'missing"", 'figures', 'cut', 'off', 'distractingly', 'elbow', 'height', 'leading', 'claustrophobic', 'experience', 'Westerns', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'argument', 'favour', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'restoring', 'grandeur', 'landscape', 'vistas', 'lost', 'pan', 'scan', 'vhs', 'transfers', 'instance', 'top', 'bottom', 'information', 'have', 'lost', 'imposition', 'matte', 'letterbox', 'absolutely', 'destructive', 'who', 'continue', 'take', 'issue', 'Weary', 'Professor', 'opinion', 'matter', 'should', 'get', 'out', 'old', 'fullscreen', 'dvds', 'simply', 'have', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'doubt', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'here', 'badly', 'compromised', 'Blu-ray', 'out', 'replacement', 'edition', 'proof', 'THE', 'COMPOSITIONS', 'LOOK', 'BAD', 'widescreen', 'look', 'right', 'full', 'frame', 'given', 'amount', 'space', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'excuse', 'fullscreen', 'print', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'available', 'same', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'zooming', 'image', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'resolution', 'latter', 'being', 'something', 'movie', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford.In', 'short', 'are', ""n't"", 'alone', 'Professor', 'release', 'screw-up', 'bad', 'one', 'love', 'widescreen', 'new', 'trend', 'shoehorning', 'everything', 'widescreen', 'just', 'fit', 'new', 'TVs', 'bit', 'as', 'destructive', 'old', 'practice', 'shearing', 'periphery', 'prints', 'order', 'get', 'fit', 'old', 'TVs', 'fact', 'case', 'rather', 'cutting', 'out', 'grandeur', 'vista', ""'ve"", 'crowded', 'sky', 'out', 'John', 'Wayne', 'head', 'effect', 'same', 'shrink', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'really', 'experience', 'here', 'framing', 'so', 'tight', 'letterbox', 'were', 'narrower', 'disc', 'would', 'go', 'disappointing', 'unwatchable']",Hondo VHS

Cavalryman Hondo Lane (John Wayne), himself part Apache, has a working relationship with one of the Apache chiefs. He alludes to the fact that the US government had broken a treaty with the Apaches.Hondo gets to know a solitary-living pioneer woman, Angie Lowe, and her six year-old son Johnny. The absence of her husband leads to problems, such as an Apache chief wanting to take her as his wife. At one point, the six year-old shoots an Apache in defense of his mother. The plot unfolds in more ways than one, as Hondo and Angie develop feelings for each other, and Hondo has to acknowledge what he knows about her husband's death. For her part, she has to realize the fact that the Apaches will soon kill her if she does not flee, and deal with the fact that her husband had been a lout and cheat, and how her little son is to remember his father. Dying an honorable death is paramount in that culture.There are several savage battles shown between the Apaches and the settlers. Only the death an Apache leader will cause the Apache warriors to disperse.WARNING: Some of the scenes are quite violent, even by the standard of westerns, which may upset sensitive viewers.

362282,AKON7YTSYRU2Y,6303192254,"J. Conrad Guest ""J. Conrad Guest""","[3, 4]","Thirty years after his death, John Wayne remains an enigma. Many books have been written about him, none of which I've read, and so I know little of his personal life other than he has been both praised for embodying traditional American ideals and reviled for his archconservative bigotry.Yet he remains today perhaps this country's biggest movie star. Today's actors - Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, Jack Nicholson - are more accomplished actors with greater range; while from Wayne's era, Clark Gable was more handsome, James Cagney more talented, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda more eclectic. But for sheer screen charisma, I can't think of another actor from any era who brings more to the screen. Whenever Wayne is onscreen the viewer is simply compelled to watch him. Often described as ruggedly handsome, his face isn't particularly expressive. Some of his mannerisms, particularly his walk and some of his posturing, one suspects are contrived, yet a generation of men in the 40s and 50s aspired to be just like him. Heck, I knew some women in the 60s who patterned themselves after the Duke.In Hondo, based on a Louis L'Amour novel and directed by John Farrow, Wayne plays a half-breed Apache. His sidekick is Sam, a dog as surly as Hondo. Hondo befriends Angie Lowe, a New Mexican farmwoman and mother of a young son whose husband deserts her for extended periods of time. Geraldine Page is well-cast as the ""handsome"" Angie, and was nominated for an Oscar for her first starring role, despite a performance that can best be described as wooden. Character actor Ward Bond and a young James Arness ably lend support.Setting aside the rather clich&eacute; depiction of the Apache and several historical inaccuracies, Hondo can perhaps best be described as a morality play, a study of the power of lies and when, or if, it is beneficial to tell one. Hondo laments the lies the white man tells the Apache and tells Angie that the Apache language contains no word for ""lie."" Page's soliloquy on the subject of lies - those she endured at the tongue of her husband as well as those she told herself - near the end of the movie is a telling moment. Although delivered somewhat mechanically, the words speak for themselves.Not ranked in the top ten best all time westerns or even one of Wayne's best films, it is still recommended viewing.",4,A Fine Additon to the John Wayne Legacy,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2349,"['Thirty', 'years', 'death', 'John', 'Wayne', 'enigma', 'Many', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'none', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'know', 'little', 'personal', 'life', 'other', 'been', 'praised', 'embodying', 'traditional', 'American', 'ideals', 'reviled', 'archconservative', 'bigotry.Yet', 'today', 'perhaps', 'country', 'biggest', 'movie', 'star', 'Today', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'greater', 'range', 'Wayne', 'era', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'was', 'more', 'handsome', 'James', 'Cagney', 'more', 'talented', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'more', 'eclectic', 'sheer', 'screen', 'charisma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'era', 'who', 'more', 'screen', 'Whenever', 'Wayne', 'onscreen', 'viewer', 'simply', 'compelled', 'watch', 'Often', 'described', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'face', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'expressive', 'mannerisms', 'particularly', 'walk', 'posturing', 'one', 'suspects', 'are', 'contrived', 'yet', 'generation', 'men', '40s', '50s', 'aspired', 'be', 'just', 'Heck', 'knew', 'women', '60s', 'who', 'patterned', 'Duke.In', 'Hondo', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'directed', 'John', 'Farrow', 'Wayne', 'half-breed', 'Apache', 'sidekick', 'Sam', 'dog', 'as', 'surly', 'Hondo', 'Hondo', 'Angie', 'Lowe', 'New', 'Mexican', 'farmwoman', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'husband', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'well-cast', 'handsome', 'Angie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'performance', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'wooden', 'Character', 'actor', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'young', 'James', 'Arness', 'ably', 'lend', 'support.Setting', 'aside', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'depiction', 'Apache', 'several', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Hondo', 'can', 'perhaps', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'morality', 'play', 'study', 'power', 'lies', 'when', 'beneficial', 'tell', 'one', 'lies', 'white', 'man', 'Apache', 'tells', 'Angie', 'Apache', 'language', 'word', 'lie', 'Page', 'soliloquy', 'subject', 'lies', 'endured', 'tongue', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'told', 'end', 'movie', 'telling', 'moment', 'delivered', 'somewhat', 'mechanically', 'words', 'speak', 'themselves.Not', 'ranked', 'top', 'ten', 'best', 'time', 'even', 'one', 'Wayne', 'best', 'films', 'still', 'recommended', 'viewing']",Hondo VHS

It is a good western starring the leading light of the genre, John Wayne.Wayne plays the part of Hondo Lane who is first seen carrying dispatches for the cavalry in Arizona. His horse has been shot out from under him by Apaches and he wanders into a farmstead inhabited a woman and her young son. She is justifiably worried about the strange man and tries to maintain the fiction that her husband will be back at any time. Hondo sees through this but his direct, forthright and honest character makes an impression on her. It out that her husband has been gone for quite a while and she has no idea if or when he will return.After Wayne leaves, the woman, played by Geraldine Page, is visited by the Apache leader Victorio. He is impressed by the bravery of her young son and has no personal animosity against the woman but warns her that she cannot stay without a husband to care for her and the son. He tries to set her up with some of his warriors but she manages to resist for a little while. Still, he warns her that her husband must return soon or she will be provided with a new husband.Wayne, in the meantime, delivers his dispatches and the news is grim. The Apache are ready to rise. He gives the warning and then has a few run-ins with Page's absentee husband. They do not get along. Eventually, it is up to Wayne to save the day for the cavalry, the homesteader, Arizona and goodness and decency. It's a bit pat but it is fun.The Indians are treated respectfully in this western.

He first shows up at the ranch of Mrs. Angie Lowe after getting away from Apache attackers. This takes place in the ending days of the ""Indian round-up"" years, when only a few bands of Apache were left. Hondo takes a liking to Angie and her young son, but soon heads out to deliver the message.In the meantime, the Apache have always been fond of Mrs. Lowe and had a good relationship with her - and the chief takes a personal interest in her son. He tries to convince Angie to choose a new husband from amongst his braves. She insists that her husband will be back soon to stay on the remote ranch with her.Hondo runs into the wayward husband in a bar, only learning his name after punching him out. In an attempt to get the husband back to his wife, Hondo takes the man's horse and says that Mr. Lowe can retrieve it at the ranch. Angry, Lowe pays a guy to go with him after Hondo. Apaches attack and kill the paid bodyguard, and Hondo shoots an Apache to save Lowe's life. Lowe repays Hondo by attempting to shoot him in the back. Hondo is forced to kill him. He takes Lowe's tintype of Lowe's son to bring back to the mom.Along the way, the Apaches find Hondo and are about to torture him to death when the Apache chief recognizes the tintype. Hondo still has to fight - and triumph over - the brother of the Apache he killed. The Apache chief brings Hondo back to Mrs. Lowe, who claims Hondo as her husband in order to get him in away from the Apaches. Hondo tries several times to tell Angie what happened, but each time she doesn't want to hear it. She does end up hearing the truth from someone else, but when Hondo then attempts to tell the boy, Angie refuses to let him do it. She scolds Hondo that his need for the truth is so great that he'd damage the boy's sense of well being and security to achieve it.The movie is a rather complex story, based almost exactly on the story by Louis L'Amour. John Wayne loved the story so much that he specifically hired a favorite script writer to adapt it into a movie for him. It was filmed to be watched in 3D, so there are several scenes with knives poking at the screen and people standing in the foreground. You might think this would make the movie look cheesy, but really you're normally lost in the storyline or the gorgeous landscapes.This movie came out in 1953 and for an era that saw many ""slaughter the Indians"" movies, it's pretty impressive in its even handedness. Angie likes the Apaches and has been friends with them since childhood. Hondo is a half Indian, and had an Apache wife while he lived with them for 5 years. You get treated to many scenes with Apaches speaking in their native Apache tongue. Hondo makes it pretty clear that the only reason that the Apache are rising up are that the US government has been actively deceiving them and betraying them. He explains that the Apache are very much against lying, and that he is the same way.Compared to many other westerns, this does a reasonably good job of showing shades of grey, not just 'Good' and 'Bad'. The Apaches were pushed into the war, but they're prepared to kill an innocent woman who has lived on this land from birth. The settlers are sometimes obnoxious about their desire to get rid of the ""natives"". In the end, Hondo says that he imagines this will be the end of the Apache way of life, and that it's a shame.",5,Great Balance for its time,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,3445,"['John', 'Wayne', 'Hondo', 'Lane', 'half-Indian', 'message', 'carrier', 'gunslinger', 'New', 'Mexico', 'first', 'up', 'ranch', 'Mrs.', 'Angie', 'Lowe', 'getting', 'away', 'Apache', 'attackers', 'place', 'ending', 'days', 'Indian', 'round-up', 'years', 'when', 'only', 'few', 'bands', 'Apache', 'were', 'left', 'Hondo', 'liking', 'Angie', 'young', 'son', 'soon', 'heads', 'out', 'deliver', 'message.In', 'meantime', 'Apache', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fond', 'Mrs.', 'Lowe', 'had', 'good', 'relationship', 'chief', 'personal', 'interest', 'son', 'convince', 'Angie', 'choose', 'new', 'husband', 'braves', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'soon', 'stay', 'remote', 'ranch', 'her.Hondo', 'runs', 'wayward', 'husband', 'bar', 'only', 'learning', 'name', 'punching', 'out', 'attempt', 'get', 'husband', 'back', 'wife', 'Hondo', 'man', 'horse', 'Mr.', 'Lowe', 'can', 'retrieve', 'ranch', 'Angry', 'Lowe', 'guy', 'go', 'Hondo', 'Apaches', 'attack', 'kill', 'paid', 'bodyguard', 'Hondo', 'shoots', 'Apache', 'save', 'Lowe', 'life', 'Lowe', 'Hondo', 'attempting', 'shoot', 'back', 'Hondo', 'forced', 'kill', 'Lowe', 'tintype', 'Lowe', 'son', 'bring', 'back', 'mom.Along', 'way', 'Apaches', 'find', 'Hondo', 'are', 'torture', 'death', 'when', 'Apache', 'chief', 'tintype', 'Hondo', 'still', 'fight', 'triumph', 'brother', 'Apache', 'killed', 'Apache', 'chief', 'brings', 'Hondo', 'back', 'Mrs.', 'Lowe', 'who', 'Hondo', 'husband', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'Apaches', 'Hondo', 'several', 'times', 'tell', 'Angie', 'what', 'happened', 'time', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'end', 'up', 'hearing', 'truth', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'Hondo', 'then', 'tell', 'boy', 'Angie', 'let', 'do', 'scolds', 'Hondo', 'need', 'truth', 'so', 'great', ""'d"", 'damage', 'boy', 'sense', 'well', 'being', 'security', 'achieve', 'it.The', 'movie', 'rather', 'complex', 'story', 'based', 'almost', 'exactly', 'story', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'loved', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'specifically', 'hired', 'favorite', 'script', 'writer', 'adapt', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'be', 'watched', '3D', 'so', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'knives', 'poking', 'screen', 'people', 'standing', 'foreground', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'cheesy', 'really', ""'re"", 'normally', 'lost', 'storyline', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes.This', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1953', 'era', 'saw', 'many', 'slaughter', 'Indians', 'movies', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'even', 'handedness', 'Angie', 'Apaches', 'been', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Hondo', 'half', 'Indian', 'had', 'Apache', 'wife', 'lived', '5', 'years', 'get', 'treated', 'many', 'scenes', 'Apaches', 'speaking', 'native', 'Apache', 'tongue', 'Hondo', 'pretty', 'clear', 'only', 'reason', 'Apache', 'are', 'rising', 'up', 'are', 'US', 'government', 'been', 'actively', 'deceiving', 'betraying', 'Apache', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'lying', 'same', 'way.Compared', 'many', 'other', 'westerns', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'shades', 'grey', 'not', 'just', ""'Good"", ""'Bad"", 'Apaches', 'were', 'pushed', 'war', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'kill', 'innocent', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'land', 'birth', 'settlers', 'are', 'sometimes', 'obnoxious', 'desire', 'get', 'rid', 'natives', 'end', 'Hondo', 'will', 'be', 'end', 'Apache', 'way', 'life', 'shame']",Hondo VHS

To an non-John Wayne fan and you haven't seen this movie, you will be very pleasantly surprise. It proves to be a finely crafted film, well directed, scripted and fill with interesting characters. John Farrow directed this film and he did a good job. The movie was based on Louis L'Amour novel and having read the book, I thought the movie did great justice to it.John Wayne played his role well although most people will never believed him to be ""half-Indian"". His support of Indians' position proves to be quite enlightening considering when this movie was made. Wayne managed to bring out his character with skills which often belied many critics who only believed that Wayne can only be Wayne. Geraldine Page is perfect as Wayne's love interest. She's supposed to be ""homely"" looking and I supposed she had to ""downgrade"" her looks to play the part. The movie proves to be well supported by a good cast such as Ward Bond, James Arness and Michael Pate.The movie initially came in 3-D effect and the VHS tape I owned is in that effect. So everytime I played the movie, I have to put on those silly 3D glasses which create some eyestrain after a while. Good thing the movie is only 84 minutes long. The 3D effects isn't that bad but I thought the movie could have gone without it.

This Batjac production had been a collector's dream for a long time. Years ago I bought a VHS tape that did not satisfy me, but this DVD has got all it takes.In Hondo, John Wayne plays a cavalry dispatch rider who helps a lonely woman (Geraldine Chaplin) and her son (Lee Aaker) through an Indian uprising. Not a run-of-the-mill, cowboy versus Indians, this western shows a sympathetic view towards the Apaches who are gradually losing their way of life as the white men settle in the Southwest.Wayne's character, Hondo, who is part Indian is caught in a crossfire when he has to defend the woman and her small boy in a conflict between Victorio's Apaches and the Cavalry.Hondo is based on a novel by Louis Lamour and written by James Edward Grant. Director John Farrow had to quit his directorial assignment due to another engagement, so John Ford finished the movie unaccredited.This DVD is loaded with extras, such as interviews, trailers, commentaries, the making of Hondo in the Camargo, Mexico, desert. In one of the extras John Wayne's son explains how they cleaned each frame of the movie prior to transferring it to DVD.Watching it you will get to know some facets of John Wayne's personality that better explain why he stayed in the saddle so long and how he could fill the silver screen the way he did.",5,At last!,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,1453,"['HONDO.One', 'better', 'John', 'Wayne', 'according', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'TIMES', 'THE', 'WESTERN', 'MOVIE', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'Batjac', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'collector', 'dream', 'long', 'time', 'Years', 'bought', 'VHS', 'tape', 'did', 'not', 'satisfy', 'DVD', 'got', 'Hondo', 'John', 'Wayne', 'cavalry', 'dispatch', 'rider', 'who', 'lonely', 'woman', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'son', 'Lee', 'Aaker', 'Indian', 'uprising', 'Not', 'run-of-the-mill', 'cowboy', 'versus', 'Indians', 'western', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Apaches', 'who', 'are', 'gradually', 'losing', 'way', 'life', 'white', 'men', 'settle', 'Southwest.Wayne', 'character', 'Hondo', 'who', 'part', 'Indian', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'when', 'defend', 'woman', 'small', 'boy', 'conflict', 'Victorio', 'Apaches', 'Cavalry.Hondo', 'based', 'novel', 'Louis', 'Lamour', 'written', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'Director', 'John', 'Farrow', 'had', 'quit', 'directorial', 'assignment', 'due', 'engagement', 'John', 'Ford', 'finished', 'movie', 'unaccredited.This', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'extras', 'such', 'interviews', 'trailers', 'commentaries', 'making', 'Hondo', 'Camargo', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'one', 'extras', 'John', 'Wayne', 'son', 'how', 'cleaned', 'frame', 'movie', 'prior', 'transferring', 'DVD.Watching', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'facets', 'John', 'Wayne', 'personality', 'better', 'explain', 'why', 'stayed', 'saddle', 'so', 'long', 'how', 'could', 'fill', 'silver', 'screen', 'way', 'did']",Hondo VHS

362308,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6303192254,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","How can anybody resist a western in which John Wayne's character says such a thing to a lady (and, even more important, a married one)? I certainly couldn't. I liked almost everything in this great western, which, all John Wayne's big fan as I am, I discovered only recently.The story happens in the time of Apache Wars, but history is very much mistreated in this film, so it is not possible to say anything more precise. A half-Indian civilian scout (and a renowned gunfighter) working for US Cavalry, Hondo Lane (John Wayne) is dispatched with a message and after losing his horse is forced to travel alone on foot through Indian territory. There, to his surprise, he discovers an isolated little farm, in which lives a woman, Mrs Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six years old son, who seem to be left alone by the overwise extremely aggressive and cruel Apaches commanded by Vittorio. This film describes a surprisingly complex romance which will ultimately develop between Hondo Lane and this mysterious married woman, when in the same time all around rages a murderous, merciless war...The dialogs are the greatest treasure of this film. John Wayne's rough and tough as nails character delivers pearl after pearl, in principle very seriously but in fact with tons of humour. Geraldine Page plays magistrally a very civilised and gentle woman suffering in an extremely unhappy marriage and inexorably attracted by the forbidden fruit personalized by the taciturn and straight speaking ""barbarian"" who used to live long years amongst ""savages"" and even was married to an Indian woman - and who is widely known for having killed many men in gunfights (and knifefights)...Dialogs between John Wayne and his best friend, another civilian scout named Buffalo, are also great. Even better are exchanges between Mrs Lane and Indian chief Vittorio, who tries to marry her to one of his braves, as he hates to see a ""good woman wasted"" by living without a man...The weaker thing in this film is the portraying of the Apache and the violence made to history.This film being an adaptaion of a bestselling western novel, the Apache are portrayed here with all the cliches necesseary to this kind of works - they always capture alive people who killed many of them and then they always give them a chance to fight for their lives, and therefore a chance to kill even more of them... Although being essentially warlike early neolithic farmers in transition from nomadic paleolithic hunters-gatherers (and therefore very behind their times), the XIX century Apache were certainly not stupid - in fact they were very pragmatic people and in time of war any captured white settler or soldier would never receive any second chance, but would be slowly tortured to death, for the amusement of braves... And a single white woman found on their territory would be simply gang raped and then tortured to death, or, if she was really lucky, taken away as slave/concubine - but certainly never left in peace...It is also good to remind that the real famous Chiricauha Apache chief was called Victorio (and not Vittorio) and his real fate was to die in a fight against Mexican Army (very different from what happens in the film). Also, general Crook cited all the time in this film was in reality nowhere near Apache territory in times of Victorio War (1879-80) - in real history American commander who fought Victorio was general Sheridan. Finally, the character of Vittorio in the film is almost a kind of a white knight - when in reality he ruthlessly slaughtered dozens of American and Mexican civilians and he earned a particularly nightmarish reputation with the infamous Alma massacre...But those weaker points notwithstanding, watching this film and especially the wonderful interactions between John Wayne's and Geraldine Page's characters was such a pleasure, that I simply can not give to this western less than five stars.

It was made in 3D in 1953 before movies were made in wide screen. I was really looking forward to the blu-ray release. Unfortunately, they letterboxed a movie that was not made in wide screen. They simply cut the bottom and top of the picture off. If you have seen the film as it was meant to be seen you can tell. Starting in 1956 the studios told their dirctors that if they were going to shoot a film in standard 1.33 to 1 ration that their movies would be cropped in the theaters and to shoot their films accordingly. This lead to a number of films having some dead space at the top or bottom of the film. manyd films such as ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and ""The Devil at 4 O'Clock"" were filmed that way. Hondo was made before this practice was started. For me this is unforgivable and I will be returning my blu-ray.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","There's a lot of Western packed into this relatively short, 83 minute movie...there are absolutely no wasted scenes; no wasted frames for that matter. Starring a still slender, athletic and young looking John Wayne (he was 47 at the time) and relative unknown, Geraldine Page, in only her second film and first of several Academy Award nominated performances. This was among the first of the &#34;revisionist&#34; Westerns, where an attempt was made to tell the real story of the pioneer West, warts and all: realism versus romanticism, stronger roles for women, and a more sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans. You will find all of that in this film and you will find the Duke in one of his best performances as the part-Indian &#34;breed&#34;, Hondo Lane, who has spent part of his life w/the Apaches and is torn between his life as a white man and his life as an Indian. Page is the quintessential strong frontier woman, who has been abandoned by her weak husband in the midst of Indian territory, with a young son, but perseveres through it all. Page in this film looks like what most pioneer women probably looked like after living a hard life on the frontier; but Wayne's character is strongly attracted to her and there is great on-screen chemistry between them. The Indians (in this case Mescalero Apaches) are portrayed in a refreshingly realistic manner and while the chief, Vittorio, is played by Australian actor, Michael Pate, it is a convincing portrayal and Pate actually looks the part. In addition to Pate, look for some superb support acting from Ward Bond and James Arness. This DVD also has some great special features you'll want to watch involving the making of &#34;Hondo&#34;, and informational films on the Apaches, Ward Bond and screenwriter, James Edward Grant. A classic Western from an era (the 50s) when many were made...don't miss this one if you like John Wayne and the Western genre. -",5,Action packed John Wayne Western!,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1923,"['lot', 'Western', 'packed', 'relatively', 'short', '83', 'minute', 'movie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wasted', 'scenes', 'wasted', 'frames', 'matter', 'Starring', 'still', 'slender', 'athletic', 'young', 'looking', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', '47', 'time', 'relative', 'unknown', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'several', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'performances', 'was', 'first', '34', 'revisionist', '34', 'Westerns', 'where', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'pioneer', 'West', 'warts', 'realism', 'romanticism', 'stronger', 'roles', 'women', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Native', 'Americans', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'Duke', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'part-Indian', '34', 'breed', '34', 'Hondo', 'Lane', 'who', 'spent', 'part', 'life', 'w/the', 'Apaches', 'torn', 'life', 'white', 'man', 'life', 'Indian', 'Page', 'quintessential', 'strong', 'frontier', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'weak', 'husband', 'midst', 'Indian', 'territory', 'young', 'son', 'Page', 'film', 'what', 'most', 'pioneer', 'women', 'probably', 'looked', 'living', 'hard', 'life', 'frontier', 'Wayne', 'character', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Indians', 'case', 'Mescalero', 'Apaches', 'are', 'portrayed', 'refreshingly', 'realistic', 'manner', 'chief', 'Vittorio', 'played', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'Pate', 'actually', 'part', 'addition', 'Pate', 'look', 'superb', 'support', 'acting', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'James', 'Arness', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'special', 'features', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'involving', 'making', '34', 'Hondo', '34', 'informational', 'films', 'Apaches', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'A', 'classic', 'Western', 'era', '50s', 'when', 'many', 'were', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'like', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'genre']",Hondo VHS

I do feel they should have released both versions Blu-Ray certainly has the room for it and I am sure they already had a usable print of the film they could have used so I don't understand the decision not to include both. However, I already own the DVD of this great movie and I found the Blu-Ray to be well worth the purchase the picture in comparison to the DVD in my opinion it looks amazing, and I thought the DVD already looked pretty good. Again for me the upgrade in picture and sound on Blu-Ray was well worth it to me. I know some of the picture is missing and for some they can't get past that, but with this being the 1:85 ratio I didn't really notice. To me I really notice the picture loss the most going from a movie shot with an aspect ratio of 2:35 being shown in Pan n Scan and it would drive me crazy and bug me so I do get it. And if I did a side by comparison with 2 screens running each version yes I could probably tell the difference, but for me with Hondo I honestly couldn't tell what I was missing so for me it didn't distract or take away the enjoyment of the movie.  I know some folks disagree, but this is just my opinion and 2cents:) For me Hondo rates a 5 star for not only being a great movie, but for also a great Blu-Ray release. Bob""I stand corrected I just read several reviews and one by Gretchen Wayne clearly states Hondo was originally shot in 1:85."" This explains why I didn't notice any loss of information, and I still disagree with those who think the picture looks crowded, blurred and out of focus due to quote stretching. I think the picture and the sound look amazing a clear upgrade from the DVD. Yes, it's not perfect, but for a movie shot in the 50's it looks really good! It still amazes me how they can take a movie as old as Hondo and restore it to the point of looking almost as good or better than when it was originally released. I know my opinion is just one of many, but it's mine nevertheless and maybe it will help someone with their purchasing decision.

362329,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,6303192254,Robert E. Nylund,"[11, 11]","It was altogether appropriate that John Wayne should make a film in the briefly popular stereoscopic process that Hollywood adopted in the early 1950's to compete with television...and it's all the more appropriate that the one 3-D film he made was a western.  Of course, the popularity of 3-D only lasted about a year and by the time this film was released (in late 1953) it was only shown in 3-D in a few theaters; most people saw it in conventional 35 milimeter.Anyone who has seen surviving 3-D prints of such films, including this writer, can attest to their incredible visual impact, particularly the ones that didn't rely on the usual gimmicks of throwing or pointing things at the cameras. ""Hondo"" has a few instances of pointing knives or guns at the cameras, but the film generally avoids the gimmicks that may have contributed to the demise of the 3-D fad.  Of course, there were always those who complained about having to wear special glasses to watch 3-D movies.Overall, this is very impressive production throughout.  It is tightly paced and has numerous exciting scenes, along with more tender and even humorous moments.  Based on a Louis L'Amour story, adapted by John Wayne's longtime friend James Edward Grant, this is one of the more intriguing westerns that Wayne made.  Director John Farrow, actress Mia Farrow's father, was able to keep things moving during the film's 83 minutes.One of the more remarkable aspects is that the film is more sympathetic toward Native Americans than in most films of the time, perhaps because John Wayne's character is admittedly part Apache.  One is intrigued and even amused to discover that the Indian chief is played by an Australian actor, Michael Pate, but makeup and his effective acting make his portrayal effective and believable.  Pate is among the living actors interviewed for ""The Making of Hondo,"" one of the special features included on this DVD.  He recalls the decision to cast him as the chief and his own amazement that it worked.Filmed mostly in the the state of Chihuahua in Mexico, the color photography is vivid and impressive.  One marvels at the fact that Warner Brothers was using the bulky, cumbersome stereoscopic cameras, which often had to be hand-carried by several men from location to location.John Wayne produced the film through the company that he named Batjac, enjoying a good business arrangement with the legendary Jack Warner.  Leonard Maltin, known for his books on Hollywood and regular appearances on ""Entertainment Tonight,"" notes in his excellent introduction that Warner believed that ALL movies should be made in 3-D.  Given the periodic return of films in 3-D and the realistic effects of such productions, this writer has often thought that it would be a good idea to continue making films with the stereoscopic process.The film features appearances by two of John Wayne's closest friends, Ward Bond and James Arness.  John Wayne and Ward Bond played football at the University of Southern California and were discovered by director John Ford, who gave them part-time jobs during his productions and sometimes used them in bit parts.  (Ford even directed a few of the scenes in ""Hondo"" because Farrow had to return to Hollywood to work another film.)  There is a special tribute on the DVD to Bond, who became known to millions of Americans as the beloved wagonmaster on NBC's ""Wagon Train"" in the late 1950's.  Bond died suddenly in late 1960 from a heart attack, after appearing in hundreds of motion pictures.  He was often a crusty, rough character who, nevertheless, could be loveable and entertaining.James Arness also worked with John Wayne in ""Island in the Sky"" and when Arness debuted on CBS television series ""Gunsmoke,"" Wayne introduced the very first episode in 1955.  This came after Wayne had declined an invitation from CBS to star on the show.  They remained friends for many years.Long unavailable, ""Hondo"" remains a thoroughly entertaining and exciting film and it has never looked or sounded better than in this digitally restored version.",5,John Wayne's 3-D Western,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,4062,"['was', 'altogether', 'appropriate', 'John', 'Wayne', 'should', 'make', 'film', 'briefly', 'popular', 'stereoscopic', 'process', 'Hollywood', 'adopted', 'early', '1950', 'compete', 'television', 'more', 'appropriate', 'one', '3-D', 'film', 'made', 'was', 'western', 'course', 'popularity', '3-D', 'only', 'lasted', 'year', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'late', '1953', 'was', 'only', 'shown', '3-D', 'few', 'theaters', 'most', 'people', 'saw', 'conventional', '35', 'milimeter.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'surviving', '3-D', 'prints', 'such', 'films', 'including', 'writer', 'can', 'attest', 'incredible', 'visual', 'impact', 'particularly', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'usual', 'gimmicks', 'throwing', 'pointing', 'things', 'cameras', 'Hondo', 'few', 'instances', 'pointing', 'knives', 'guns', 'cameras', 'film', 'generally', 'gimmicks', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'demise', '3-D', 'fad', 'course', 'were', 'always', 'who', 'complained', 'having', 'wear', 'special', 'glasses', 'watch', '3-D', 'movies.Overall', 'very', 'impressive', 'production', 'tightly', 'paced', 'numerous', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'more', 'tender', 'even', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'story', 'adapted', 'John', 'Wayne', 'longtime', 'friend', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'one', 'more', 'intriguing', 'westerns', 'Wayne', 'made', 'Director', 'John', 'Farrow', 'actress', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'father', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'film', '83', 'minutes.One', 'more', 'remarkable', 'aspects', 'film', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Native', 'Americans', 'most', 'films', 'time', 'perhaps', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'admittedly', 'part', 'Apache', 'One', 'intrigued', 'even', 'amused', 'discover', 'Indian', 'chief', 'played', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'makeup', 'effective', 'acting', 'make', 'portrayal', 'effective', 'believable', 'Pate', 'living', 'actors', 'interviewed', 'Making', 'Hondo', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'decision', 'cast', 'chief', 'own', 'amazement', 'worked.Filmed', 'mostly', 'state', 'Chihuahua', 'Mexico', 'color', 'photography', 'vivid', 'impressive', 'One', 'marvels', 'fact', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'using', 'bulky', 'cumbersome', 'stereoscopic', 'cameras', 'often', 'had', 'be', 'hand-carried', 'several', 'men', 'location', 'location.John', 'Wayne', 'produced', 'film', 'company', 'named', 'Batjac', 'enjoying', 'good', 'business', 'arrangement', 'legendary', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'known', 'books', 'Hollywood', 'regular', 'appearances', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'Warner', 'believed', 'ALL', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'made', '3-D', 'Given', 'periodic', 'return', 'films', '3-D', 'realistic', 'effects', 'such', 'productions', 'writer', 'often', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'continue', 'making', 'films', 'stereoscopic', 'process.The', 'film', 'features', 'appearances', 'two', 'John', 'Wayne', 'closest', 'friends', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'James', 'Arness', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'played', 'football', 'University', 'Southern', 'California', 'were', 'discovered', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'who', 'gave', 'part-time', 'jobs', 'productions', 'sometimes', 'used', 'bit', 'parts', 'Ford', 'even', 'directed', 'few', 'scenes', 'Hondo', 'Farrow', 'had', 'return', 'Hollywood', 'work', 'film', 'special', 'tribute', 'DVD', 'Bond', 'who', 'became', 'known', 'millions', 'Americans', 'beloved', 'wagonmaster', 'NBC', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'late', '1950', 'Bond', 'died', 'suddenly', 'late', '1960', 'heart', 'attack', 'appearing', 'hundreds', 'motion', 'pictures', 'was', 'often', 'crusty', 'rough', 'character', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'could', 'be', 'loveable', 'Arness', 'also', 'worked', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Island', 'Sky', 'when', 'Arness', 'debuted', 'CBS', 'television', 'series', 'Gunsmoke', 'Wayne', 'introduced', 'very', 'first', 'episode', '1955', 'came', 'Wayne', 'had', 'declined', 'invitation', 'CBS', 'star', 'show', 'remained', 'friends', 'many', 'years.Long', 'unavailable', 'Hondo', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'sounded', 'better', 'digitally', 'restored', 'version']",Hondo VHS

Besides vintage production footage there's an amiable, fact-laden commentary from fan and critic Leonard Maltin.This solid adaptation of the Louis L'Amour short story ""The Gift of the Cochise,"" was given the Wayne touch with a screenplay by James Edward Grant, who was a master of the laconic dialogue that Wayne made his trademark.  (L'Amour expanded his short story into a novel.  It became a bestseller and he became a household name.)The story, reminiscent of Shane, stars Wayne as the titular hero, a bitter half-breed cavalry scout, a loner whose sympathies lie more with the Indians than the White man whose only friend is a mean spirited dog.  That is until he falls into an uneasy friendship with a lonely New Mexico farmwoman (Geraldine Page in her film debut) whose husband disappears for long periods and whose son is a blood brother to the local Apache chief.",4,ICONIC WAYNE,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,1117,"['One', 'John', 'Wayne', 'most-loved', 'films', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', '1953', 'HONDO', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Paramount', 'sharp-looking', 'transfer', 'shot', 'majestic', 'locations', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', '3-D', 'loaded', 'extras', 'vintage', 'production', 'footage', 'amiable', 'fact-laden', 'commentary', 'fan', 'critic', 'Leonard', 'Maltin.This', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'short', 'story', 'Gift', 'Cochise', 'was', 'given', 'Wayne', 'touch', 'screenplay', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'who', 'was', 'master', 'laconic', 'dialogue', 'Wayne', 'made', 'trademark', ""L'Amour"", 'expanded', 'short', 'story', 'novel', 'became', 'bestseller', 'became', 'household', 'name', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'Shane', 'Wayne', 'titular', 'hero', 'bitter', 'half-breed', 'cavalry', 'scout', 'loner', 'sympathies', 'lie', 'more', 'Indians', 'White', 'man', 'only', 'friend', 'mean', 'spirited', 'dog', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'lonely', 'New', 'Mexico', 'farmwoman', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'film', 'debut', 'husband', 'long', 'periods', 'son', 'blood', 'brother', 'local', 'Apache', 'chief']",Hondo VHS

It was a big deal, and being a kid who loved Westerns, I begged my dad to take me to 7-11 where they were selling the 3D glasses. Well, the big night came and I loved Hondo! After that, I didn't see it again until its recent release on Blu-ray. This is a great Wayne film! I had forgotten much of the movie in the twenty-plus years since I had seen it, so it was basically like watching it for the first time. The picture looks great, and the sound is better than it had been in past home video editions (I saw two or three minutes of it on DVD once, and the sound was not so great).As for the film itself, the story moves along at a brisk pace and is never boring. There are shoot-outs, chases, plenty of suspense, and even a knife fight! Even though I just bought and watched my Blu-ray a few weeks ago, I already want to see this film again!The movie is very clean and is suitable for almost all ages (I have no problem with my seven year old son watching it). As a bonus we get an introduction by the always wonderful Leonard Maltin.

362353,A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9,6303192254,"Wayne Engle ""Wayne Engle""","[6, 6]","If you've seen ""The Searchers,"" then John Wayne's portrayal of Hondo Lane will remind you in some ways of Ethan Edwards, the angry, ""racist"" lead character in his later, better-known movie.But they're different -- ""Hondo"" gives its own spin on life in the Old West, unlike the latter movie of Wayne's. Ethan Edwards of ""The Searchers"" is an enraged, hating man; Hondo Lane is calmer, more observant of life in general, given to wise, laconic comments about how to survive as a loner in the West to Geraldine Page's well-meaning but often flighty ranch wife, who is ultimately his love interest in the film.Ethan Edwards knew the Indians and their ways, and hated them. Hondo Lane knows the Indians and their ways -- he is candid about being part-Indian himself -- and makes no secret of his respect for them. As a result, the Apaches who menace the settlers and fight the Cavalry in ""Hondo"" are portrayed more sympathetically, and with more nuances, than Edwards' despised Comanches. On the other hand, ""Hondo"" tends to idealize the Indians as ""noble savages"" -- Hondo Lane claims in a couple of scenes that the Apaches never lie. In ""The Searchers,"" one might say, the Comanches are at least portrayed as more human and flawed.Edwards had no pets that we are made aware of -- but Hondo has Sam. That is, Sam consents to travel with him. The fiercely independent, don't-pet-me-or-I'll-bite-you dog, who forages for his own food (I don't need no humans to feed me!), tags along with Hondo, once drowning an Indian who had tried to kill his human friend. The film resists the temptation to have Hondo grieve or sentimentalize when Sam is speared and killed later by another Indian. This seems harsh on first viewing -- but wait. Hondo has made it clear that he is an unsentimental, practical loner who takes care of himself. Sam was the same way. Now Sam is gone, and Hondo doubtless hurt for him in his innermost soul. But we are shown no manifestation of it. Somehow, that's the way it should be in this Western.The action sequences in ""Hondo"" are even better than those in the later, longer ""The Searchers."" Wayne appears to have done a lot of -- but not all of -- his own stunts in ""Hondo."" But he was three years younger than when he made ""The Searchers"".Last but not least there is Ward Bond, playing Hondo's long-time trail pal. Bond portrayed only one part -- if you've seen one movie with him, you've seen all his roles -- but he played it superbly. Also, look for a very young James Arness in a small but key speaking role; a year or two later he would rocket to TV fame as Matt Dillon in ""Gunsmoke."" Wayne reportedly helped him to land the plum role.""Hondo"" is an exceptional Western which never got the attention it deserved because the same year, Alan Ladd made ""Shane."" Here's your chance to see it for the first time, 56 years after it was made.

362357,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,6303192254,William R. Hancock,"[2, 2]","""Do what you want to do"" was cavalry scout Hondo Lane's philosophy of life for dealing with people. Lane (John Wayne)held to the notion that showing was better than telling where human interactions were involved, and that lessons learned first hand tended to stay with you longer than did advice given.Hence he'd give up telling a boy (Lee Aaker...later ""Corporal Rusty"" to tv's Rin Tin Tin) not to try petting a feral dog and let him ""do what he wanted to do"". He did, and he got bit. And learned his lesson. Lane figured if you did what you wanted, you'd either end up right or wrong. If you ended up right, good for you. If you came up wrong you took the consequences, learned the lesson (hopefully), and wouldn't make the same kind of mistake again. A bit of a spin on Nietsche's ""That which does not kill you makes you strong"" philosophy.A tough philosophy, but one that would serve one well in the1880s desert southwest during the violent Apache wars.This film is one I have long adored, but haven't seen in many years until this new DVD release from Paramount. I remember when I saw it first, where I saw it first, and under what circumstances. Saw it as a first grader when it came out in '53. My dad picked me up from school on his day off and took me to an afternoon matinee at the Plaza Theatre in Greenville, SC. I ate this movie up and, despite some of the info given out by Leonard Maltin and others on this new disc to the effect that the 3D version only showed in NY and LA and maybe one or two other big cities, I know for a FACT that I SAW it in 3D here in Joanne Woodward's home town because I was chattering forDAYS about arrows and spears flying out at you from the screen,and about horses almost trampling you....and weird little green and red plastic glasses you had to wear to see it. Sorry Mr. Maltin, I love you as a movie critic and I know you have good sources on your film histories...but you're just WRONG about THIS one!Great film this, 3D OR 2d. Great performances,great cinematography, great stunt work, great story, great dialog, and...beyond just performances...great CHEMISTRY between the principles. This is one of the best Duke westerns; right up there with Red River, the Searchers, Rio Bravo, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Shootist. As a six-year-old at it's release I carried away from it two burning images: a steely-eyed Hondo walking slowly up to an apprehensive Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page)and son at the beginning of the film, and the fatal spearing of Sam the dog by Rudy Acosta's evil Chirachaua sub-chief later on in the movie.Was glad that Acosta ""got his"" at the end, but was sorry that Vittorio(Michael Pate) died. Didn't Pate play a cowboy vampire in some B-grade horror movie? I'd swear I could put his face to such a thing. Also find it interesting that the Hondo Lane character was deemed so popular in the 1950s that Warner Brothers re-worked him a little bit and put him forth (albeit a lot less hard-edged) a few years later as ""Bronco Layne""...with a ""y"" added...in the person of actor Ty Hardin (who looked a bit like PATRICK Wayne). And then in the 60s ABC did a straight (but short-lived) series version of Hondo starring Ralph Taeger. Okay...but NOT the Duke.Glad to recommend ""Hondo""...the DUKE'S Hondo...to any and all fans of the western genre.",5,"""Do what you want to do"".",1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,3322,"['Do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'was', 'cavalry', 'scout', 'Hondo', 'Lane', 'philosophy', 'life', 'dealing', 'people', 'Lane', 'John', 'Wayne', 'held', 'notion', 'showing', 'was', 'better', 'telling', 'where', 'human', 'interactions', 'were', 'involved', 'lessons', 'learned', 'first', 'hand', 'tended', 'stay', 'longer', 'did', 'advice', 'given.Hence', ""'d"", 'give', 'up', 'telling', 'boy', 'Lee', 'Aaker', 'later', 'Corporal', 'Rusty', 'tv', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'not', 'try', 'petting', 'feral', 'dog', 'let', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'did', 'got', 'bit', 'learned', 'lesson', 'Lane', 'figured', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', ""'d"", 'either', 'end', 'up', 'right', 'wrong', 'ended', 'up', 'right', 'good', 'came', 'up', 'wrong', 'took', 'consequences', 'learned', 'lesson', 'hopefully', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'kind', 'mistake', 'again', 'bit', 'spin', 'Nietsche', 'not', 'kill', 'strong', 'philosophy.A', 'tough', 'philosophy', 'one', 'would', 'serve', 'one', 'well', 'the1880s', 'desert', 'southwest', 'violent', 'Apache', 'wars.This', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'long', 'adored', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'Paramount', 'remember', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'where', 'saw', 'first', 'what', 'circumstances', 'Saw', 'first', 'grader', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'53"", 'dad', 'picked', 'up', 'school', 'day', 'took', 'afternoon', 'matinee', 'Plaza', 'Theatre', 'Greenville', 'SC', 'ate', 'movie', 'up', 'info', 'given', 'out', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'others', 'new', 'disc', 'effect', '3D', 'version', 'only', 'showed', 'NY', 'LA', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'big', 'cities', 'know', 'FACT', 'SAW', '3D', 'here', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'home', 'town', 'was', 'chattering', 'forDAYS', 'arrows', 'spears', 'flying', 'out', 'screen', 'horses', 'almost', 'trampling', '.and', 'weird', 'little', 'green', 'red', 'plastic', 'glasses', 'had', 'wear', 'see', 'Sorry', 'Mr.', 'Maltin', 'love', 'movie', 'critic', 'know', 'have', 'good', 'sources', 'film', 'histories', ""'re"", 'just', 'WRONG', 'THIS', 'one', 'Great', 'film', '3D', '2d', 'Great', 'performances', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', 'stunt', 'work', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'dialog', 'just', 'performances', 'great', 'CHEMISTRY', 'principles', 'one', 'best', 'Duke', 'right', 'there', 'Red', 'River', 'Searchers', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'Shootist', 'six-year-old', 'release', 'carried', 'away', 'two', 'burning', 'images', 'steely-eyed', 'Hondo', 'walking', 'slowly', 'up', 'apprehensive', 'Angie', 'Lowe', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'son', 'beginning', 'film', 'fatal', 'spearing', 'Sam', 'dog', 'Rudy', 'Acosta', 'evil', 'Chirachaua', 'sub-chief', 'later', 'movie.Was', 'glad', 'Acosta', 'got', 'end', 'was', 'sorry', 'Vittorio', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'died', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Pate', 'play', 'cowboy', 'vampire', 'B-grade', 'horror', 'movie', ""'d"", 'swear', 'could', 'put', 'face', 'thing', 'Also', 'find', 'interesting', 'Hondo', 'Lane', 'character', 'was', 'deemed', 'so', 'popular', '1950s', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 're-worked', 'little', 'bit', 'put', 'forth', 'lot', 'less', 'hard-edged', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Bronco', 'Layne', 'y', 'added', 'person', 'actor', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'who', 'looked', 'bit', 'PATRICK', 'Wayne', 'then', '60s', 'ABC', 'did', 'straight', 'short-lived', 'series', 'version', 'Hondo', 'starring', 'Ralph', 'Taeger', 'Okay', 'NOT', 'Duke.Glad', 'recommend', 'Hondo', 'DUKE', 'Hondo', 'fans', 'western', 'genre']",Hondo VHS

362360,AP3B615GM191G,6303192254,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","For the first 20-30 minutes, &#34;Hondo&#34; seems like it just might transcend the &#34;typical Duke western&#34; label.  Some SPOILERS AHEAD: The title character (played by Wayne) wanders out of the dusty plains and into a homestead run by Angie (Geraldine Page) and son Johnny (Lee Aaker).  After helping Angie with some work, Hondo quickly discovers that her husband has deserted her.  Riding back to the U.S. Calvary regiment that he sometimes scouts for, Hondo gets into a barroom fistfight with a local scoundrel...a scoundrel who turns out to be Angie's &#34;lost&#34; husband!At this point in the film, I thought it had real potential to be a great western tale.  A lot of interesting pieces were established that could have been built upon.  Unfortunately, from that point onward it becomes stock cowboys vs. Indians fare.  Director John Farrow tries to weave a subplot about the white men and the Indians co-existing with each other, but everything we see/feel onscreen says otherwise.At the end of the film, after a group of Cavalry men have fought off a warring band of Indians, Hondo makes the following quote: &#34;It is the end of a way of life.  A good way.&#34;  This after an entire movie of killing more Indians than anyone else on screen.  Now, I realize that movies (and especially westerns like this one) were made for different reasons and even different audiences than today and should be partially judged as such.  However, in today's Hollywood, that type of empty moralizing is inexcusable.  History, then, is not kind to a film like &#34;Hondo&#34;.Overall, &#34;Hondo&#34; is a decidedly average (or maybe even a bit below) western.  I give it three stars because the Duke gives a good performance and the setup did hold my interest for a time.  In the wide view, though, I think the only reason this movie gets as much &#34;press&#34; as it does is because it became quite rare before coming out on DVD.
