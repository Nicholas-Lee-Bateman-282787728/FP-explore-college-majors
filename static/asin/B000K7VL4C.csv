He talked (joked) about suicide, mass murder, having suicide on television, and other ""family friendly"" topics and to some this was more depressing than funny. Well if it's depressing, there's only one reason for it. As he points out we're the only creatures on this planet who do this sort of stuff. Animals can be territorial but for them, at the end of the day, it's about survival (i.e. finding a home, food, defense, etc,). Humans are the only creatures that do this stuff because we can.Using that as a spring board, he catapults into his usual arguments of humans being completely hopeless because we've turned this great country of ours that was beautiful when we found it, actually we stole it, but anyway. We took this country and as turned it into ""a coast to coast shopping mall."" We seem, acording to him, to take anything we're handed now and not complain, not seeing how badly we're being screwed as long as we can keep buying stuff we don't need (That's why your here at Amazon right? :) ).

1032734,A27QKI9K6RKFIT,B000K7VL4C,"CARLOS ROMERO ""&#34;natural cinephile&#34;""","[0, 0]","Let me start-off by saying, George Carlin is possibly the greatest American comedian of all-time! He's definitely my favorite among many notable ones (Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, etc.). In ""Life is Worth Losing"" from 2005, his facetious and hard-hitting wit is on full display for everyone to marvel and laugh uncontrollably in agreement with. I'm not one to be shocked by Mr. Carlin's observations and routine: in this very harsh, but truly realistic examination of the American-cultural landscape (especially since I'm in total agreement with what he has to say, and was left in profound admiration of his brutal honesty, and brilliance that cuts right through all the BS). George Carlin was not one to back-away/be scared-off by controversy (the censors and P.C. people), to speak his mind as freely as he wished. And thank God for that! For here, he gives us one of his most significant and unforgettable moments in his 50 year career, where he tells us exactly what ""the owners"" of this country really think of us! And believe me, I know most of you will still be in denial about this very sad fact (if you are old enough to remember/see what has transpired here in the U.S. in the past 35 years, and from what I myself have seen and experienced too), but I can tell you it's all so very true! George Carlin of course, was more than just a comedian: I prefer to think of him as the last breed of a no-holds-barred American essayist, par-excellence. His routine here is so funny and hysterical, that it will be remembered as a true classic in his entire repertoire. I've seen it so many times, and now I finally get to own it. I highly recommend it, and if you're a George Carlin fan, I'm sure you don't need much encouragement anyway!

1032737,A2D758L9F0TC6I,B000K7VL4C,DoctorJoeE,"[0, 0]","Why is it that great American humorists tend, almost inevitably, to gravitate toward the dark and the morbid and the bitter in the final stages of their lives?  Mark Twain is the prototype example (if you've forgotten, find a copy of ""Letters from the Earth""), but there are a multitude of others: Russell Baker, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank Sullivan...Groucho...even Will Rogers was dabbling in the early stages at the time of his tragically premature demise.  Why?  Maybe some of them begin to take themselves too seriously; but I think most simply grow tired of the relentless pressure to be hilarious every single time.  Occasionally you see evidence of this, right in their work:  In ""I'll Take Manhattan"", a fat old lady walks up to Woody Allen -- another prototype example -- and says, ""My husband and I love your films; especially the early funny ones!""So I suppose it's not surprising that George Carlin, who will surely be remembered as one of the greatest of great American humorists, followed this same dark path in the twilight of his long career.  The trend is evident from the beginning of the HBO specials, and reaches a climax in this macabre offering.  Is it over the top?  Of course -- but what Carlin material, from ""AM and FM"" on, wasn't?  Is it disturbing?  Yes -- but George always enjoyed disturbing his audiences, prodding them into a bit of independent contemplation.  Is it his best stuff?  No -- he sounds too much like a bitter old man, as he sometimes did during the last few years -- but like just about everything else he wrote, it's freaking brilliant -- and that's why it gets 5 stars, and an unreserved recommendation from me.Like most Carlin material, this is not for small children, or for self-righteous Fox News Channel devotees.",5,Dark Brilliant Humor,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,1812,"['Why', 'great', 'American', 'humorists', 'tend', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'gravitate', 'dark', 'morbid', 'bitter', 'final', 'stages', 'lives', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'prototype', 'example', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'find', 'copy', 'Letters', 'Earth', 'are', 'multitude', 'others', 'Russell', 'Baker', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'James', 'Thurber', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'Frank', 'Sullivan', 'Groucho', 'even', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'was', 'dabbling', 'early', 'stages', 'time', 'tragically', 'premature', 'demise', 'Why', 'Maybe', 'begin', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'think', 'most', 'simply', 'grow', 'tired', 'relentless', 'pressure', 'be', 'hilarious', 'single', 'time', 'Occasionally', 'see', 'evidence', 'right', 'work', ""'ll"", 'Take', 'Manhattan', 'fat', 'old', 'lady', 'up', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'prototype', 'example', 'husband', 'love', 'films', 'especially', 'early', 'funny', 'ones', 'So', 'suppose', 'not', 'surprising', 'George', 'Carlin', 'who', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'greatest', 'great', 'American', 'humorists', 'followed', 'same', 'dark', 'path', 'twilight', 'long', 'career', 'trend', 'evident', 'beginning', 'HBO', 'specials', 'climax', 'macabre', 'offering', 'top', 'course', 'what', 'Carlin', 'material', 'AM', 'FM', 'was', ""n't"", 'disturbing', 'Yes', 'George', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'disturbing', 'audiences', 'prodding', 'bit', 'independent', 'contemplation', 'best', 'stuff', 'too', 'much', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'sometimes', 'did', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'wrote', 'freaking', 'brilliant', 'why', '5', 'stars', 'unreserved', 'recommendation', 'me.Like', 'most', 'Carlin', 'material', 'not', 'small', 'children', 'self-righteous', 'Fox', 'News', 'Channel', 'devotees']",George Carlin - Life Is Worth Losing

N,"[8, 10]","Out of all the Carlin specials I've recently seen with the ""All My Stuff"" boxset, I can safely say ""Life is Worth Losing"" is a centerpiece of George Carlin's catalog despite not being at the forefront of his performances. Prior to purchasing ""All My Stuff,"" I had previously purchased the mp3 album of this show, and really, despite knowing/hearing all the material beforehand and considering it was pretty far from being my favorite outing by the comedian, the video recording of this show really caught me off guard in an unexpected way.At the beginning of the show, Carlin announces his 341 days of sobriety, and that fact that 2006 will be his 50th year in show business. This shows in his appearance (his face is much, much fuller) and he doesn't really bounce around the stage as much as before. The man looks tired, and the four years between this show and 2001's Complaints and Grievances where obviously not kind to him. You just can't decipher this kind of stuff (as much) in the audio recording, and it adds to the darker nature of this material. Again, George has always been dark, but this is really dark, and as such isn't the Carlin album I listen to for a good, solid Chuckle. This is the Carlin album I listen to when I want to read between the lines and sense the pain that is present within the artist. In the end, this is a show that he had to do, to recuperate and move forward with his normal brand of comedy, which he did with 2008's ""It's Bad For You.""Appropriately titled, ""Life is Worth Losing"" is an undeniably poignant performance of Carlin's, it's just far from being the most accessible. It's the last show I'd recommend to fans to watch, it won't become a staple for the right reasons but it should be seen regardless.

He can't simply tell the truth as he sees it, even if it's not always funny?I think George more than earned the right to give us a dead-on rant like this. He made us laugh for over forty years. So at the end of his life he ain't allowed to call it precisely as he sees it...and as it truly is? Damn right he's got the right. He earned it. Plus, there is endless truth here. Too bad for those who can only handle jokey jokes. And hell, there are plenty of laughs, but they're aimed at those who dig Monty Python or Bill Hicks more than Andrew Dice Clay or Joan Rivers.For those who appreciate a rare shaft of truthlight cutting through the cloud cover of 21st century bs, it doesn't get much more direct and correct than this.Rest in peace, George.

It's basically a critique on modern America and how misguided we all are. Consumerism has taken over our lives. If you really listen to it, it is amazing how he puts it all together. I cannot imagine how long it took him to organize it all. It is brilliant. But this is not light-hearted comedy in the least. Be prepared.

He pokes fun at everything from people who commit suicide to how much he enjoys watching natural disasters kill hundreds of thousands of people...and always wishes thing get even worse for them.I dearly loved George and wil definately miss him. He was getting old here and this may have been his last concert.  He had gained weight in this performance and he slips up several times.  I once heard him say he comes up with all this stuff while taking vicodine and drinking wine and that he was wired during almost every one of his performances.

It's too dark and nowhere near funny enough. The opening routine consisting of a monologue made from 21st Century popular culture phrases is thoughtful but not very funny, and goes on waaaay too long. Unfortunately, the same can be said for the rest of the show. I've no problem with dark humour - Carlin's People Who Should Be Killed routine on his last HBO show was hilarious. But here,the lack of laugh-out loud moments just makes his misanthropic material deeply depressing. At one point Carlin even does an Assassination routine about how it's always the good people who get murdered that's practically a word for word copy of a routine the late Bill Hicks did 13 years ago! What's going on here George?!But probably the saddest thing here is hearing Carlin stumble trying to memorize his material - I appreciate his advanced age, but too many times he loses momentum by mumbling ""er...."" mid routine, something his razor sharp brain hardly ever did before whenever performing.I'll always love George's previous work, and hope he releases at least one more DVD/CD that's the thoughtful and FUNNY George of old.

1032755,A208I29OP8ZIRP,B000K7VL4C,"William J. Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[4, 19]","My God. Is this really George Carlin? THE George Carlin? The one I grew up with who was so funny? Whose humor was cutting edge and bitingly spot on? What I'm seeing nowadays is an old, bitter man who ceaselessly attacks everything about America and, well... just about everything else.Like so many others who have reviewed this, and other, George Carlin performances, I am a huge fan who has become disenchanted with his most recent stuff. I can only believe that those who have rated his newest albums so highly are people who either have never heard his earlier material or have and yet somehow think a man who is ranting and raving onstage about everything he hates is funnier than the clever, witty, genuinely funny man that Carlin once was.I am saddened at what he has evolved/devolved into these days. He doesn't seem to realize that he has become, in many ways, the same type of person he sanctimoniously rails against. For instance, he consistently insults religion as a bunch of sheep being brainwashed by fire and brimstone preachers, and yet he, himself, does the exact same thing. He is preaching to his new disciples about the evils of man, America and any institution he despises which, sadly, appears to be just about all of them. That's fire and brimstone of a different, yet disturbingly similar, type. I find it hypocritical.Anyone who grew up in the '70s and '80s with George Carlin knows what a genuinely hilarious and clever guy he is/was. He made me laugh out loud with each new album. I have seen him live six times and his shows were always fresh and funny. I'm truly sorry to say that he has lost whatever it was that made him great. Each new performance nowadays seems to be filled with more and more bitterness and vitriol. I guess there are people who like that kind of thing. I'm not one of them. George Carlin jumped the shark years ago. I fervently hope this is his last album because I want to remember the George Carlin that made him the best comedian of his time. Unfortunately, that time is past.Carlin was always on the cutting edge of comedy, and no one who grew up loving the man's humor can be called a prude, so anyone attempting to call people like me who believe he is a shadow of his former greatness a prude or 'out of touch' doesn't get it. He was ALWAYS controversial. It's just that he also used to be very funny; something he is occasionally now, but not consistently. The only thing consistent about his comedy now is his constant negativity about everything.I used to be able to recite, word for word, his greatest routines, from his AM and FM album to his Playin' With Your Head album, that's how big a fan I am. That's why this new, bitter old man disappoints me so. The younger generation, who is growing up with increasingly more shock entertainment, from radio to TV to movies, may think George Carlin is great. If so, good for them. I'm glad they enjoy his new brand of humor and more power to them. I daresay that those of us who don't like it are those who are familiar with his older material and know that his recent stuff is very inferior to it.Peace.",2,PLEASE let this be his last concert!,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3112,"['God', 'really', 'George', 'Carlin', 'THE', 'George', 'Carlin', 'one', 'grew', 'up', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'Whose', 'humor', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'bitingly', 'spot', 'What', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'nowadays', 'old', 'bitter', 'man', 'who', 'ceaselessly', 'everything', 'America', 'well', 'just', 'everything', 'else.Like', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'other', 'George', 'Carlin', 'performances', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'who', 'become', 'disenchanted', 'most', 'recent', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'believe', 'who', 'have', 'rated', 'newest', 'albums', 'so', 'highly', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'earlier', 'material', 'have', 'yet', 'somehow', 'think', 'man', 'who', 'ranting', 'raving', 'onstage', 'everything', 'funnier', 'clever', 'witty', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'man', 'Carlin', 'once', 'was.I', 'am', 'saddened', 'what', 'evolved/devolved', 'days', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'become', 'many', 'ways', 'same', 'type', 'person', 'sanctimoniously', 'instance', 'consistently', 'religion', 'bunch', 'sheep', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'preachers', 'yet', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'preaching', 'new', 'disciples', 'evils', 'man', 'America', 'institution', 'sadly', 'be', 'just', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'different', 'yet', 'disturbingly', 'similar', 'type', 'find', 'hypocritical.Anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'George', 'Carlin', 'what', 'genuinely', 'hilarious', 'clever', 'guy', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'new', 'album', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'six', 'times', 'shows', 'were', 'always', 'fresh', 'funny', ""'m"", 'truly', 'sorry', 'say', 'lost', 'was', 'made', 'great', 'new', 'performance', 'nowadays', 'be', 'filled', 'more', 'more', 'bitterness', 'vitriol', 'guess', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'kind', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'George', 'Carlin', 'jumped', 'shark', 'years', 'ago', 'fervently', 'hope', 'last', 'album', 'want', 'remember', 'George', 'Carlin', 'made', 'best', 'comedian', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'past.Carlin', 'was', 'always', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comedy', 'one', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'man', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'prude', 'anyone', 'attempting', 'call', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'shadow', 'former', 'greatness', 'prude', ""'out"", 'touch', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'ALWAYS', 'controversial', 'just', 'also', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'something', 'occasionally', 'now', 'not', 'consistently', 'only', 'thing', 'consistent', 'comedy', 'now', 'constant', 'negativity', 'everything.I', 'used', 'be', 'able', 'recite', 'word', 'word', 'greatest', 'routines', 'AM', 'FM', 'album', 'Playin', 'Head', 'album', 'how', 'big', 'fan', 'am', 'why', 'new', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'so', 'younger', 'generation', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'increasingly', 'more', 'shock', 'entertainment', 'radio', 'TV', 'movies', 'may', 'think', 'George', 'Carlin', 'great', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'enjoy', 'new', 'brand', 'humor', 'more', 'power', 'daresay', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'older', 'material', 'know', 'recent', 'stuff', 'very', 'inferior', 'it.Peace']",George Carlin - Life Is Worth Losing
