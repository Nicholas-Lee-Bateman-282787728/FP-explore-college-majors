The characters were likable and for the most part well portrayed. Having grown up in a water phobic family, it was easy for me to identify with some of the feelings of the characters getting into that swimming pool.  Obviously a metaphor about life, it is a triumph for anyone who jumps in and manages the water, whether treading or doing laps, an accomplishment that many too soon lose sight of in their attempts to be the biggest and and the best.",4,Enjoyable,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,550,"['Big', 'Bad', 'Swim', 'slice', 'life', 'movie', 'touched', 'places', 'made', 'others', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'water', 'phobic', 'family', 'was', 'easy', 'identify', 'feelings', 'characters', 'getting', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Obviously', 'metaphor', 'life', 'triumph', 'anyone', 'who', 'water', 'treading', 'doing', 'laps', 'accomplishment', 'many', 'too', 'soon', 'lose', 'sight', 'attempts', 'be', 'biggest', 'best']",N/A

As someone who has always been terrified of water and failed a few swim classes, and as someone who's taken (and taught) quite a few adult ed classes, I was able to relate to the film.The director picks up the mood of the class...uneasy camaraderie and surprising friendships. We see the characters growing and changing through their whole lives as they engage in the class. Tbere's a lot of truth here: as people get stronger physically, they get stronger emotionally. I've seen this happen at the gym.I don't agree with the reviewer who objected to incomplete story lines, such as the angry man who leaves or the mom who never returns to class. These incidents make the film real. You get students like those in just about every class.Spoiler alert:I was surprised at the outcome.

1071771,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000PKG6GM,D. S. Thurlow,"[8, 8]","The premise for 2006's ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an adult swim class at a pool in Connecticut, at which a young instructor tries to help the members of the class overcome their respective fears of the water.  Away from the pool, the camera will follow the instructor and two of the students as they work through personal challenges, the resolution of which ultimately loop back through the class.The movie portrays a very human-scale story.  There are no car chases, murders, or extraordinary events, just people working through disappointments, divorces, deadend jobs, and second chances.  Jeff Branson is the swimming instructor, an earnest young man trying to deal with a significant disappointment, the nature of which is not immediately revealed.  His heart is in the right place, and we cannot help but root for his success.  Paget Brewster plays a high school teacher going through a painful divorce and trying to restart her life.  A chance friendship made at the class leads to new possibilities she is alternatively eager and reluctant to embrace.  Jess Weixler plays a casino card dealer and hardened part-time stripper looking for an upside to her life, who finds that sometimes, you just have to ask.The approach is generally humorous, although we are allowed to share the anxiety of the students over their fear of the water and other challenges in their lives.  The plot device of having a couple of students present part of the story as a film documentary is only a partial success.  However, tight direction and the deliberate, naturalistic pacing of the story carry the day.""The Big Bad Swim"" is very highly recommended as an entertaining and different indie film, a comedy-drama presented on a very human scale.",5,A Story on a very human scale....,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1726,"['premise', '2006', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Swim', 'adult', 'swim', 'class', 'pool', 'Connecticut', 'young', 'instructor', 'tries', 'help', 'members', 'class', 'overcome', 'respective', 'fears', 'water', 'Away', 'pool', 'camera', 'will', 'follow', 'instructor', 'two', 'students', 'work', 'personal', 'challenges', 'resolution', 'ultimately', 'loop', 'back', 'class.The', 'movie', 'very', 'human-scale', 'story', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'murders', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'just', 'people', 'working', 'disappointments', 'divorces', 'deadend', 'jobs', 'second', 'chances', 'Jeff', 'Branson', 'swimming', 'instructor', 'earnest', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'deal', 'significant', 'disappointment', 'nature', 'not', 'immediately', 'revealed', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'success', 'Paget', 'Brewster', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'going', 'painful', 'divorce', 'trying', 'restart', 'life', 'chance', 'friendship', 'made', 'class', 'new', 'possibilities', 'alternatively', 'eager', 'reluctant', 'embrace', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'casino', 'card', 'dealer', 'hardened', 'part-time', 'stripper', 'looking', 'upside', 'life', 'who', 'sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'ask.The', 'approach', 'generally', 'humorous', 'are', 'allowed', 'share', 'anxiety', 'students', 'fear', 'water', 'other', 'challenges', 'lives', 'plot', 'device', 'having', 'couple', 'students', 'present', 'part', 'story', 'film', 'documentary', 'only', 'partial', 'success', 'However', 'tight', 'direction', 'deliberate', 'naturalistic', 'pacing', 'story', 'carry', 'day', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Swim', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'different', 'indie', 'film', 'comedy-drama', 'presented', 'very', 'human', 'scale']",N/A

This is a nifty Indy gem.This is a slice of lifer revolving around a mixed group of people all taking an after hours swimming class at the local community center. Some are desperately afraid of the water. Others just want to learn to swim. The story centers mostly on just a few of them and their lives. The rest we meet in varying degrees as they add a bit of texture to the story.This is mostly about small victories but not entirely. The swim instructor is on meds and seeing a shrink. (They explain this but some degenerate mishandled the DVD so I couldn't get that scene). He needs to get back on the horse. One of the women is a teacher and losing her husband to an affair. Another girl is both a blackjack dealer in a casino and a stripper at a bar. She seems to be looking for a true love. And on and on.This movie has a bit of quirkiness to it but not a lot. You just like seeing these people and learning about them. Other than Todd Sussman, I knew none of the names in the cast but I did recognize some of the faces. All did a decent job but the lead three did a very good job. This is a true Indy film. No razzle dazzle. Just a good script and good acting.It might be more of a three and a half stars than the four I gave it but it's good enough that I wanted to ""round up."" The script needed a bit of tightening up. Some things go unresolved. What about Jordan's Brother's friend Ricky and his crush on her. This is brought up a couple of times in the movie but dropped. What of the affair Sussman's wife is having. Dropped. Not all things in life are resolved but these are simply ignored. These are small quibbles compared to the overall quality of the film.

1071773,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000PKG6GM,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 3]","Not being one to jump into the water, so to speak, for unknwon properties, I suprised myself when I purchased this little unknown film on recommendation from Amazon. They recommended it to me because I am a recreational swimmer and have bought swim gear through Amazon.""The Big Bad Swim"" is a typical modern dramedy about a group of adults taking an adult swim class at a local health club. The obvious sexual nature of the film is downplayed with relationships being the primary theme of the movie. The cast is a group of actors with mainly TV credits to their names.The main characters are the swim coach, a 29-year-old man (Jeff Branson) struggling to find his identity, and a couple of the women in the class who just happen to be the two best-looking female members of the cast (Paget Brewster and Jess Weixler), both with excellent swimsuit bodies. Weixler is a part-time stripper, as well, just to show that even though the sexual imagery is downplayed, it is still apparent throughout the movie.In summary, ""The Big Bad Swim"" is a fairly slow-moving ensemble relationship film where some of the main characters pair off and become better friends. The swim class and swim scenes themselves have little to do with the plot (as it is, which is thin.) The swim class is merely the entry point for everyone in the movie as well as the viewer's entrance into their lives.While others have fawned over the writing and character portrayals, my litmus test for a movie, regardless of how good I feel about it when I watch, is what I remember about it the next morning. In this case, I remembered almost nothing. None of the characters are particularly charming or memorable and I neither suspended disbelief nor empathized with any of the characters long enough to bond with them. There just isn't much to this movie even though it won awards at a number of film festivals you never heard of.The main advantage of ""The Big Bad Swim"" is its price -- as little as $2 from certain Amazon vendors.

It doesn't beat you over the head and there's no violence or nudity - though there is sex (but it's tasteful and - again- done without nudity). This is definitely an independent film without a big budget, starring a group of actors you've never hear of and directed by a Director who is making his first film. (As we learn in the requisite ""making of"" documentary, two of the lead actors weren't signed until three DAYS before shooting began. And from start to finish the production took less than six months until release!I said ""lead actors"" above but this is really an ensemble piece. Of course, a few get more screen time than others.The plot has to do with a group of seven or eight adults who take an night school Adult Ed swim class in Old Lyme, CT to calm their fears of water. But they all have SOME other fears, which surface as the story is told. Even the swim instructor has his own demons.The script is not perfect - characters there in the beginning leave without much explanation (notable the Indian man who curses a lot in the first 15 minutes, and the mother of young girl who doesn't return for the second lesson.)I don't know the history of the careers for any of the actors but I would not call any of them ""Hollywood attractive"". It's not that we want beautiful people all the time but even the ""stripper"" (who really doesn't strip.. she gives lap dances while wearing a skimpy outfit) isn't what your would call ""downright sexy"".I gave this film four stars rather than five because it's not Academy Award quality. But the four stars should encourage you to see it once if you like ""small independent films"". It doesn't dumb itself down and you probably won't know what will happen next. The strongest characters will draw you in (while a lecherous high school principal will make you cringe when he has to read his lines off the top of his desk rather than really acting.).Give it a chance.
