581277,A2SAVTYOEBSNPF,B00005BIG4,"Alyce In Wonderland ""The Looking Glass""","[0, 0]","I had to spend about 15 minutes watching a portion of each routine to see what they included.  There is no explanation on the DVD, the cover, or even the Current/ QuickFix web site.  With 9 routines, I had assumed that at least 3 of them would be cardio.  However, they are all toning.The exercises are very effective.  The instructors are fine. (Other than Minna's wild 80's hair... Holy cow!)  The pace is slow enough to make each movement count.  All in all, this is a terrific toning DVD.  You just need to swap it with your cardio DVDs to get a complete workout.These are a couple of cardio DVDs I enjoy:Quickfix - Total Cardio KickDon't buy this expecting real kickboxing instruction... not even close.  But it is a fun and effective cardio workout, based on the same 10- minute routine idea.  This DVD has 3 10- minute cardio/ lite toning workouts, one concentrating on the core, another for legs and hips, and another for arms.  It also includes a 4th bonus 10- minute cardio kickboxing routine.  You can do the whole DVD or choose your own combo.This DVD is good for everyone.  They are sure to include an instructor who demonstrates easier versions of the exercises throughout the workouts.Kathy Smith - Kickboxing WorkoutThis one has some good kickboxing instruction, taught by a real champion kickboxer.  Still, it is intended as a cardio and toning workout... not a training routine for real kickboxing technique.  It's fun and allows you some options in choosing your routine.  It'll get you sweating.  Not a good choice for people who are not already working out regularly.",4,EXCELLENT Toning!  No cardio/ fat burning routines.

I usually combine this with another workout such as walking, biking or yoga.  This is the reason I give it 4 out of 5.  The workout isn't ""complete"".  You still really need to add on some cardio, back and calf exercises to make it complete.  I had a baby a year ago and this had been the best for helping dropping that ""baby weight"".  My other workouts didn't do it as well as this one.  I really like the instructors.  They are enthusiastic and make you want to keep going.  They aren't obnoxious like some other instructors.  I also love the variety in these workouts.  You get three choices per target area.  You can combine these in so many different ways, you can never get bored! You can do as much or as little as you choose. The abs workout is exceptional.  Julie works those abs in so many different ways.  You'll never get sick of it--there are no endless crunches here!

581280,A2R4LM60ZHIDIF,B00005BIG4,Amber Dowd,"[200, 202]","I switched to the Quick Fix Total Mix workout DVD after having a disappointing affair with the NYC Ballet Workout DVD.  Quick Fix offers a lot more:  faster, more vibrant exercises that get your heart rate and motivation moving, clearer descriptions of the exercises and what each individual exercise will do for your body from the instructors, and the option to create your own customized workout that will fit your particular needs and schedule demands.The three sections - abs, buns, and arms/legs offer three different workout routines each, and each routine is only 10 minutes long.  There is even a small clock at the bottom of your screen so you can see where you're at in the workout.  Very helpful and motivating.The instructors can be a tad annoying at times (&quot;okay, you're doing great!&quot;), but when I'm really focused on the exercise, it doesn't bother me as much.  The abs instructor is particularly good at verbally walking you through an exercise in full detail before flinging you into something that might be too complex for you to try with minimal instruction.  The instructors also stress safety during the routines by using chairs to keep your balance and showing how to safely do exercises with weights so your back doesn't get strained.  You'll need a pair of 3 to 8 pound dumbbells for the arms and arms/legs combo routines and a kitchen chair to help you through some of the buns routines.After the first 30 minute workout, my thighs ached in that nice I've-just-done-something-good-for-my-body way.  An hour workout, however, offered a bit more of a muscular aching that bordered on too much, so remember to pace yourself.  The exercises seem really simple, but at the end of the day, you really feel it.One of the legs/arms combo routines is a bit much for me at this point in my journey to a healthier body.  It's a little too challenging because it involves squats and hammer curls simultaneously, along with other leg and arm combos, and I haven't built up the strength or stamina yet to make it through that one without having to pause, but I've found a very complementary trio of exercises that seem custom-created for me, and before I know it, the workout is over, I've worked up a good, healthy sweat, and I'm ready to hit the shower.Highly recommended for those who are pressed for time but want to get the most out of short spurts of exercise.  I recommend doing it daily...even if it's only ten minutes worth of abs exercises.  Perhaps we won't all have the &quot;six pack abs&quot; that the instructors have at the end of the day, but the calories you burn and the isolated exercises that work particular muscle groups really offer a nice wake-up call to your day.My only criticisms would be the custom workout option only offers up to three variations of exercise routines.  Some days I'd like a more rigorous and lengthier workout, and you have to pause at the end of the first completed 30 minutes and choose which exercise routines you want for your additional 10, 20, or 30 minutes, which can be a motivation killer.  Other than that and the flaunting of Minna's tanned jugs as she leads you in arm curls, it's a great workout, and each day I look forward to the challenges it offers.",4,A Fast and Effective Workout that Fits Your Schedule!,1013558400,"02 13, 2002",2002,3234,"['switched', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'Total', 'Mix', 'DVD', 'having', 'disappointing', 'affair', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'lot', 'more', 'faster', 'more', 'vibrant', 'exercises', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'motivation', 'moving', 'clearer', 'descriptions', 'exercises', 'what', 'individual', 'exercise', 'will', 'do', 'body', 'instructors', 'option', 'create', 'own', 'customized', 'workout', 'will', 'fit', 'particular', 'needs', 'schedule', 'demands.The', 'three', 'sections', 'abs', 'buns', 'arms/legs', 'offer', 'three', 'different', 'workout', 'routines', 'routine', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'even', 'small', 'clock', 'bottom', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'where', ""'re"", 'workout', 'Very', 'helpful', 'motivating.The', 'instructors', 'can', 'be', 'tad', 'annoying', 'times', 'quot', ""'re"", 'doing', 'great', 'quot', 'when', ""'m"", 'really', 'focused', 'exercise', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'abs', 'instructor', 'particularly', 'good', 'verbally', 'walking', 'exercise', 'full', 'detail', 'flinging', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'complex', 'try', 'minimal', 'instruction', 'instructors', 'also', 'stress', 'safety', 'routines', 'using', 'chairs', 'keep', 'balance', 'showing', 'how', 'safely', 'do', 'exercises', 'weights', 'so', 'back', ""n't"", 'get', 'strained', ""'ll"", 'need', 'pair', '3', '8', 'pound', 'dumbbells', 'arms', 'arms/legs', 'combo', 'routines', 'kitchen', 'chair', 'help', 'buns', 'routines.After', 'first', '30', 'minute', 'workout', 'thighs', 'ached', 'nice', ""I've-just-done-something-good-for-my-body"", 'way', 'hour', 'workout', 'however', 'offered', 'bit', 'more', 'muscular', 'aching', 'bordered', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'remember', 'pace', 'exercises', 'seem', 'really', 'simple', 'end', 'day', 'really', 'feel', 'it.One', 'legs/arms', 'combo', 'routines', 'bit', 'much', 'point', 'journey', 'healthier', 'body', 'little', 'too', 'challenging', 'squats', 'hammer', 'curls', 'simultaneously', 'other', 'leg', 'arm', 'combos', 'have', ""n't"", 'built', 'up', 'strength', 'stamina', 'yet', 'make', 'one', 'having', 'pause', ""'ve"", 'found', 'very', 'complementary', 'trio', 'exercises', 'seem', 'custom-created', 'know', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'up', 'good', 'healthy', 'sweat', ""'m"", 'ready', 'hit', 'shower.Highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'pressed', 'time', 'want', 'get', 'most', 'short', 'spurts', 'exercise', 'recommend', 'doing', 'daily', 'even', 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'abs', 'exercises', 'Perhaps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'quot', 'six', 'pack', 'abs', 'quot', 'instructors', 'have', 'end', 'day', 'calories', 'burn', 'isolated', 'exercises', 'work', 'particular', 'muscle', 'groups', 'really', 'offer', 'nice', 'wake-up', 'call', 'day.My', 'only', 'criticisms', 'would', 'be', 'custom', 'workout', 'option', 'only', 'up', 'three', 'variations', 'exercise', 'routines', 'days', ""'d"", 'like', 'more', 'rigorous', 'lengthier', 'workout', 'have', 'pause', 'end', 'first', 'completed', '30', 'minutes', 'choose', 'exercise', 'routines', 'want', 'additional', '10', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'can', 'be', 'motivation', 'killer', 'Other', 'flaunting', 'Minna', 'tanned', 'jugs', 'arm', 'curls', 'great', 'workout', 'day', 'look', 'forward', 'challenges']",TotalMix - The Complete Total Body Workout System
581281,A26KYDJOAGI05S,B00005BIG4,Audiaa,"[2, 2]","This is the best toning workout that I have tried.  The fact that you can choose which segments to do and how many, make it a very versatile workout.  I like to use one of the glutes or legs segments as a warm up before running, and then I do an abs segment afterwards.The abs segments are difficult enough that I can still feel them even after repeating them for a few weeks.  Each segment has completely different exercises that work all of the major abdominal muscle groups.  The instructor explains the exercises well enough that I could do them all easily the first time through, but not so extensively that I get bored sitting through the instructions when repeating the workouts.  The middle section has some positions that I find awkward, but not too difficult. Cycling through the three workouts keeps me from getting bored.The glutes and legs segments are great for warming up the legs, and they are good for toning as well.  I didn't find them that difficult, but I could still feel the results.  One of the glutes segments is done on the floor with a combination of pelvic tilts and dog style leg lifts.  The arms segment is too short for weight training, but it's good for beginners, and the arms and legs combo starts to get my heart rate up.Because each segment is so short, I find it hard to make excuses not to get a quick abs workout in before going to bed.

581292,A39HF3KKWW4FZP,B00005BIG4,isu94,"[11, 12]","I'd been doing the same at-home workout routine for a year and got sick of it. I wanted something new, fresh and flexible. This is definitely a flexible workout! The DVD has 3 ab workouts, 3 buns workouts and 3 arm/leg workouts. You can mix and match, do as much as you want, and the best part is they are all only 10 minutes each. EVERYBODY has 10 minutes somewhere in the day! Even doing 3 workouts in a row didn't seem like 30 minutes--it went by so fast! But if I need to spread them out I can. I like the style and presentation of the women, too. They're not overly perky or annoying, at least not to me.I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:1. They really need to stretch more before the workouts. Even if they did a 2-minute stretch before each workout, and THEN started the clock counting down 10 minutes, that would be great. Stretching is so critical, especially when you're working with weights. So I end up doing a lot of my own stretching before and after.2. There are really only 2 arm workouts instead of 3, because the second arm/leg workout is just legs. They should have had 3 arm workouts, then added a legs segment with 3 workouts for just legs. It would have given the user that much more flexibility and choice.I'm not slamming it though, it's a very good workout and I definitely feel it when I'm done. You don't have to do the same exact thing everyday so it keeps boredom away (hey, that rhymed!) There is no cardio though, so if you're looking for a good sweat, this isn't the DVD you should buy.

QuickFix is a life-saver for people like me.The DVD is very well-chaptered, allowing you to choose among nine 10-minute workouts:  three abs workouts, three buns workouts, one legs/arms, one legs, and one arms.  The Customize function lets you pick one to three of these nine workouts in any order.  It's quick and easy to add more after your first three have finished, if you want.  I regularly schedule myself for three, and find I've done four or five before I realize it.The workouts, themselves, are varied and interesting.  The count-down timer is great, and the instructors (whom you'll recognize from other DVDs) are entertaining and give good instruction.  I'd call myself an intermediate exerciser (long-time FIRM user), and I can't do all three of any one type of exercise -- that is, all three abs or all three buns.  It's even challenging to do buns followed by legs, since they're similar exercises in each.  I'd like more arm and chest work, although I suppose heavier weights could be used to make up the deficiency.One drawback to these workouts is there isn't really any cool-down and virtually no stretching.  They make the point that &quot;flexibility is as important as strength&quot;, but that's pretty much it.  It's easy enough to add some stretching afterwards, though, so it's not that big a deal.Overall, I highly recommend this DVD for those who crave variety, as well as for anyone who likes the option of doing 10 minutes of exercise, or more as time allows.",5,"Great concept, great variety, fun to do",1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,1607,"['rarely', 'find', 'exercise', 'fun', 'usually', 'think', 'tolerated', 'necessity', 'endure', 'long', 'often', 'can', 'QuickFix', 'life-saver', 'people', 'me.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'well-chaptered', 'allowing', 'choose', 'nine', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'three', 'abs', 'workouts', 'three', 'buns', 'workouts', 'one', 'legs/arms', 'one', 'legs', 'one', 'arms', 'Customize', 'function', 'pick', 'one', 'three', 'nine', 'workouts', 'order', 'quick', 'easy', 'add', 'more', 'first', 'three', 'have', 'finished', 'want', 'regularly', 'schedule', 'three', 'find', ""'ve"", 'done', 'four', 'five', 'realize', 'it.The', 'workouts', 'are', 'varied', 'interesting', 'count-down', 'timer', 'great', 'instructors', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'entertaining', 'give', 'good', 'instruction', ""'d"", 'call', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'long-time', 'FIRM', 'user', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'three', 'one', 'type', 'exercise', 'three', 'abs', 'three', 'buns', 'even', 'challenging', 'do', 'buns', 'followed', 'legs', ""'re"", 'similar', 'exercises', ""'d"", 'like', 'more', 'arm', 'chest', 'work', 'suppose', 'heavier', 'weights', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'make', 'up', 'deficiency.One', 'drawback', 'workouts', ""n't"", 'really', 'cool-down', 'virtually', 'stretching', 'make', 'point', 'quot', 'flexibility', 'as', 'important', 'strength', 'quot', 'pretty', 'much', 'easy', 'enough', 'add', 'stretching', 'afterwards', 'though', 'not', 'big', 'deal.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'who', 'crave', 'variety', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'option', 'doing', '10', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'more', 'time']",TotalMix - The Complete Total Body Workout System

This workout is especially great because it is very flexible.  I like to do different body parts on different days and some days I just DO NOT want to do abs.  This dvd lets you choose nine different ten minute segments in any order, up to three per routine.  The weight exercises (legs/arms, legs, and arms) are my favorites.  Weight training is great for women because weight-bearing exercises are critical for building and maintaining bone density.  You don't have to beef out, either.  I use one set of 1.5 lb weights for days when I just don't think I've got much in me and I use three pound weights when I'm feeling more energetic.  Doesn't sound like much, but I want bone density, not bulging muscles.  Anyways, the ability to create a routine that tones the body parts I want to work on is the best feature of the dvd.If you're wanting to get ready for swimsuit season, or if you're wanting to tone up for that striptease dvd you just bought, try this:  do cardio (carmen elctra's striptease disc 2, for instance, or jane fonda's old stuff) five days a week (for about 45 minutes a day, mind).  Then do weight-lifting for three days a week.  I actually do the weights for five days, but less will be effective as well.Muscle mass burns calories more efficiently than fatty mass.  That basically means that even when you're doing nothing, those nice, well-trained muscles keep burning calories.  Not really fair, is it?This is a great dvd.  For some reason, the market for aerobics, weight-training, etc., is very large, but the number of products out there that are any good is very small.  TotalMix is awesome, motivating, and broken into ten minute segments if you're like me and stressed out with no time to spare and kids who try to crawl under you while you're doing crunches.Have fun with this one!",5,I love this workout dvd,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,1911,"['Minna', 'Julie', 'Nancy', 'are', 'friends', 'Not', 'really', 'cheer', 'keep', 'motivated', 'workout', 'especially', 'great', 'very', 'flexible', 'like', 'do', 'different', 'body', 'parts', 'different', 'days', 'days', 'just', 'DO', 'NOT', 'want', 'do', 'abs', 'dvd', 'choose', 'nine', 'different', 'ten', 'minute', 'segments', 'order', 'up', 'three', 'routine', 'weight', 'exercises', 'legs/arms', 'legs', 'arms', 'are', 'favorites', 'Weight', 'training', 'great', 'women', 'weight-bearing', 'exercises', 'are', 'critical', 'building', 'maintaining', 'bone', 'density', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'beef', 'out', 'either', 'use', 'one', 'set', '1.5', 'lb', 'weights', 'days', 'when', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'much', 'use', 'three', 'pound', 'weights', 'when', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'more', 'energetic', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'want', 'bone', 'density', 'not', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'Anyways', 'ability', 'create', 'routine', 'body', 'parts', 'want', 'work', 'best', 'feature', 'dvd.If', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'get', 'ready', 'swimsuit', 'season', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'tone', 'up', 'striptease', 'dvd', 'just', 'bought', 'try', 'do', 'cardio', 'carmen', 'elctra', 'striptease', 'disc', '2', 'instance', 'jane', 'fonda', 'old', 'stuff', 'five', 'days', 'week', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'day', 'mind', 'Then', 'do', 'weight-lifting', 'three', 'days', 'week', 'actually', 'do', 'weights', 'five', 'days', 'less', 'will', 'be', 'effective', 'well.Muscle', 'mass', 'calories', 'more', 'efficiently', 'fatty', 'mass', 'basically', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'nothing', 'nice', 'well-trained', 'muscles', 'keep', 'burning', 'calories', 'Not', 'really', 'fair', 'great', 'dvd', 'reason', 'market', 'aerobics', 'weight-training', 'etc.', 'very', 'large', 'number', 'products', 'are', 'good', 'very', 'small', 'TotalMix', 'awesome', 'motivating', 'broken', 'ten', 'minute', 'segments', ""'re"", 'stressed', 'out', 'time', 'spare', 'kids', 'who', 'try', 'crawl', ""'re"", 'doing', 'crunches.Have', 'fun', 'one']",TotalMix - The Complete Total Body Workout System
