What you get is no better than the When It Was A Game Triple Play Collection pack. In fact, if you have the 3-pack TPCollection, you have the best version of this. I was thinking of giving mine away. Not now! The Blu ray version could have included a nice 30 -50 page booklet or something worth while. But, nothing. Just one disc and this is suppose to be the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition? Pretty darn weak if you ask me. The TPCollection included a nice box that included all the three cases and discs. This includes a sleeve case but nothing spectacular. I'm a little disappointed here. The video quality is of no difference what so ever. I have a 60"" Sony Bravia 1080p LED LCD. This is the best of the best out there. Every other Blu ray disc looks amazing on this. But this is not a true blu ray disc. At least the quality isn't. That's for sure. Save your money if you have the TPCollection. And if you can get your hands on that, go for it!

580181,A2X2EMB1PLDD9B,B00005B32G,John Cannon,"[27, 27]","Released prior to Ken Burns' wonderful documentary, 'BASEBALL,' this 3-part series offers a priceless collection of color 8mm home movies depicting images of everything to do with major league baseball.  You get the superstars, the forgotten, the ballparks - there's a little bit of everything.  We see an aged Cy Young and a retired Babe Ruth with a young Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle.  The beautiful original musical score sets an attitude of reverence for the entire film.  There are interviews with several former players detailing life in the 'big leagues,' and all the reflections are heard amidst the original color film.  For those of us in our forties and younger, our mindset of life in America during the first half of the twentieth century exists primarily in black and white images - this series alters all of that.  It was fascinating for me to see the original colors of the uniforms and panned sequences of stadiums long since gone.  All in all, this is a superlative effort by individuals who truly cared about what they were doing.  This is a 'must own' for long time baseball fans.

You can buy or rent them individually but I recommend watching all three. The entire series consists of 8mm and 16mm clips shot entirely by fans and players. Almost all are in color and none are done by professional photographers. The quality is amazing considering the sources -clear, sharp pictures. There are special features on Roberto Clemente, Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and others. This is for those of us who remember or want to know about when players lived in our neighborhoods, shopped at our stores and had second jobs during the off season to make ends meet. Dick Raddatz recalls making $6,000 pitching for the Red Sox during the season and $11,000 during the off season as a furniture mover. We lived for several years next door to Camilo Pascual, the great pitcher for the Senators and Twins. We would play catch in the back yard and my sisters would babysit his children. Jim Kaat shopped at my (future) in-laws corner grocery store and lived down the block. They were real heroes to all of us and they were regular people, too. This series starts in the 30's (they really did have color film) and ends in 1970 with the advent of free agency, which arguably changed the game forever, whatever you might think of its validity. This is nothing but three hours of fun and nostalgia. If you're a baseball fan, it would be hard to recommend anything else that would be as much just plain fun. None of us can turn back the clock but for three hours you can relive those years when baseball was just a game.

580185,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005B32G,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[50, 52]","""When It Was A Game"" was a labor of love, and when it was first televised on HBO the eyes of baseball fans were riveted and amazed.  All 3 of these projects consist of ""home movies"" (usually shot in 8 mm), often shot by the players themselves.  But almost all of these films are in vivid color - and to see the names that haunt Cooperstown in lifelike tones is an almost religious experience.  It would be similar if it were possible to see color footage from the Civil War or the Constitutional Convention.  Okay - I'm stretching it a little, but not by much.  Baseball fans have always had a little historian in them, and although you'd be hard-pressed to find, for example, the sports fanatic who could tell you how many touchdown passes Unitas threw or how many points Wilt Chamberlain wound up with, even casual baseball fans knew numbers like 61 (the number of Home Runs Roger Maris hit in 1961), 56 (the number of consecutive games Joe DiMaggio hit safely in during the summer of 1941), 714 (Babe Ruth's lifetime home run total) and zero (the number of Brooklyn Dodgers who got on base during Don Larsen's perfect game of 1956.)  If you took only the ""named events"" of the New York Giants at the famed Polo Grounds you could start with ""the shot heard 'round the world"" (Bobby Thompson's home run off Ralph Branca winning the 1951 National League pennant) and ""the catch"" (Willie Mays' amazing over-the-shoulder catch of Vic Wertz' 475 foot drive to deep center field, saving the game and inspiring the Giants to win the 1954 World Series.)For fans who like their baseball heroic, ""When It Was A Game"" brings their heroes to full-color life.Appropriate music and reverent narration add to the historic but vibrant qualities of the works.  ""When It Was A Game"" was eye-catching when it debuted, and so popular that it spawned a sequel that was more or less more of the same.  The third volume may be the most interesting of all (especially if you're old enough to remember watching baseball from the 1960s on), but it also adds the historical context that the innovative National League completely dominated the old boy network of the American League because of their willingness to sign Black players like Willie Mays and Hank Aaron and Latinos like Roberto Clemente.  The NL won 19 out of 20 All-Star Games starting in 1962, and this little documentary doesn't mind saying that it was the narrow-mindedness of the American League that allowed Morgan, Stargell, Banks, Gibson, Marichal and McCovey to join Mays, Clemente and Aaron on teams that regularly trounced the other, whiter, league.Like Ken Burns' ""Baseball"", this set is a video love-song to baseball.",5,Priceless Footage Honors the National Pastime,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,2667,"['When', 'Was', 'Game', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'televised', 'HBO', 'eyes', 'baseball', 'fans', 'were', 'riveted', 'amazed', '3', 'projects', 'consist', 'home', 'movies', 'usually', 'shot', '8', 'mm', 'often', 'shot', 'players', 'almost', 'films', 'are', 'vivid', 'color', 'see', 'names', 'haunt', 'Cooperstown', 'lifelike', 'tones', 'almost', 'religious', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'were', 'possible', 'see', 'color', 'footage', 'Civil', 'War', 'Constitutional', 'Convention', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'stretching', 'little', 'not', 'much', 'Baseball', 'fans', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'little', 'historian', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'example', 'sports', 'fanatic', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'touchdown', 'passes', 'Unitas', 'threw', 'how', 'many', 'points', 'Wilt', 'Chamberlain', 'wound', 'up', 'even', 'casual', 'baseball', 'fans', 'knew', 'numbers', '61', 'number', 'Home', 'Runs', 'Roger', 'Maris', 'hit', '1961', '56', 'number', 'consecutive', 'games', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'hit', 'safely', 'summer', '1941', '714', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'lifetime', 'home', 'run', 'total', 'zero', 'number', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'who', 'got', 'base', 'Don', 'Larsen', 'perfect', 'game', '1956', 'took', 'only', 'named', 'events', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'famed', 'Polo', 'Grounds', 'could', 'start', 'shot', 'heard', 'world', 'Bobby', 'Thompson', 'home', 'run', 'off', 'Ralph', 'Branca', 'winning', '1951', 'National', 'League', 'pennant', 'catch', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'amazing', 'over-the-shoulder', 'catch', 'Vic', 'Wertz', '475', 'foot', 'drive', 'deep', 'center', 'field', 'saving', 'game', 'inspiring', 'Giants', 'win', '1954', 'World', 'Series', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'baseball', 'heroic', 'When', 'Was', 'Game', 'heroes', 'full-color', 'life.Appropriate', 'music', 'reverent', 'narration', 'add', 'historic', 'vibrant', 'qualities', 'works', 'When', 'Was', 'Game', 'was', 'eye-catching', 'when', 'debuted', 'so', 'popular', 'spawned', 'sequel', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'more', 'same', 'third', 'volume', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'especially', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'watching', 'baseball', '1960s', 'also', 'historical', 'context', 'innovative', 'National', 'League', 'completely', 'dominated', 'old', 'boy', 'network', 'American', 'League', 'willingness', 'sign', 'Black', 'players', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'Hank', 'Aaron', 'Latinos', 'Roberto', 'Clemente', 'NL', 'won', '19', '20', 'All-Star', 'Games', 'starting', '1962', 'little', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'mind', 'saying', 'was', 'narrow-mindedness', 'American', 'League', 'allowed', 'Morgan', 'Stargell', 'Banks', 'Gibson', 'Marichal', 'McCovey', 'join', 'Mays', 'Clemente', 'Aaron', 'teams', 'regularly', 'trounced', 'other', 'whiter', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Baseball', 'set', 'video', 'love-song', 'baseball']",N/A

When you get tired of hearing about multi-millionaire players and steroid abusers, just pop in one of these discs and be carried back to a time in baseball's history ""when it was a game,"" back when they did not play to become rich but because of pure and unadulterated love of the game.",5,The Best Baseball Documentary this side of Ken Burns,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,617,"['review', 'standard', 'DVD', 'only', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'baseball', 'especially', 'history', 'baseball', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'set', 'delightful', 'commentary', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'other', 'voices', 'are', 'wonderful', 'shots', 'many', 'old-time', 'players', 'many', 'taken', 'home', 'movie', 'cameras', 'operated', 'ball', 'players', 'When', 'get', 'tired', 'hearing', 'multi-millionaire', 'players', 'steroid', 'abusers', 'just', 'pop', 'one', 'discs', 'be', 'carried', 'back', 'time', 'baseball', 'history', 'when', 'was', 'game', 'back', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'become', 'rich', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'love', 'game']",N/A
