Realistic? No, not at all. A good family film? Yes. When I was younger I loved watching Air Bud, especially the first one right here. This film is about a young boy who lost his father to an accident that needs a friend. Then a dog shows up. Soon he discovers that he can play basketball! And so the movie continues!This is a great family film to watch. I still do enjoy watching some of the Air Buds. One thing is for sure. If you watch one Air Bud, you gotta watch them all!

434972,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304765215,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","A fantastic family film that won hearts in 1997 makes its return to DVD nearly 12 years later for a special edition release.The film was a tremendous success in the box office which cost $3 million to make and made $24 million and instantly became a hit with canine fans everywhere and help spawn four more additional Air-bud films and three ""Buddies"" films (five puppies considered to be the offspring of Air Bud).With the release of ""Space Buddies"" in 2009, what best reacquaint movie viewers with the film that help start it all.VIDEO & AUDIO:For a 1997 film, the picture quality is pretty good.  I don't recall seeing any aging, excessive grain or any video fragmenting.  Overall, for a film that is 12-years-old, picture quality still remains pretty good.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital and the film is strictly a dialogue-based film and music.  So, this is not a film to expect your side or rear channels being used but overall, dialogue and music is clear.SPECIAL FEATURES:The main special feature is a ""Dog-U-Commentary With the Buddies"" featuring the puppies in the recent Buddies films featuring Bud-dha B-Dawg, Mudbud, Budderball and Rosebud.Also, the DVD comes in a cardboard case that holds a metal necklace/dog tag that has ""Buddy"" imprinted on it.JUDGMENT CALL:Personally, I think the release of ""AIR BUD"" on DVD is great timing.With the release of ""Space Buddies"" and the movie's references to their father aka ""Buddy"", it's a heartwarming and enjoyable family film for the children. Of course, unlike the buddies which uses current technology and features the puppies talking, ""AIR BUD"" does not feature a dog that talks.  Mainly a dog that can play basketball.I had no problems with the film.  It was entertaining and enjoyable and for those looking for a family film, especially if your children are acquainted with the ""Buddies"", then this film is perfect.With that being said, I wished there was a featurette included on the DVD that showcased how they film the basketball scenes with the dog or behind-the-scenes making of.  But the point of the release was to show the correlation of the new Buddies films with ""AIR BUD"", the film that started it all.  And children will enjoy the commentary featuring the ""Buddies"" golden retriever puppies as they watch their father and comment on the film.Overall, ""AIR BUD"" is a fun film for the whole family.  Parents do not have to worry about their children being scared.  I watched the film along with my six-year-old and he absolutely loved it.So, if your child has enjoyed the popular ""Buddies"" films, definitely share with them the film that help start it all.  ""AIR BUD"" is an enjoyable and heartwarming film for the whole family!",5,A heartwarming and enjoyable family film for the whole family!,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,2716,"['fantastic', 'family', 'film', 'won', 'hearts', '1997', 'return', 'DVD', 'nearly', '12', 'years', 'later', 'special', 'edition', 'release.The', 'film', 'was', 'tremendous', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'cost', '3', 'million', 'make', 'made', '24', 'million', 'instantly', 'became', 'hit', 'canine', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'help', 'spawn', 'four', 'more', 'additional', 'Air-bud', 'films', 'three', 'Buddies', 'films', 'five', 'puppies', 'considered', 'be', 'offspring', 'Air', 'Bud', 'release', 'Space', 'Buddies', '2009', 'what', 'best', 'reacquaint', 'movie', 'viewers', 'film', 'help', 'start', 'all.VIDEO', 'AUDIO', '1997', 'film', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'aging', 'excessive', 'grain', 'video', 'fragmenting', 'Overall', 'film', '12-years-old', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'pretty', 'good.As', 'audio', 'audio', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'film', 'strictly', 'dialogue-based', 'film', 'music', 'So', 'not', 'film', 'expect', 'side', 'rear', 'channels', 'being', 'used', 'overall', 'dialogue', 'music', 'clear.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'main', 'special', 'feature', 'Dog-U-Commentary', 'Buddies', 'featuring', 'puppies', 'recent', 'Buddies', 'films', 'featuring', 'Bud-dha', 'B-Dawg', 'Mudbud', 'Budderball', 'Rosebud.Also', 'DVD', 'cardboard', 'case', 'metal', 'necklace/dog', 'tag', 'Buddy', 'imprinted', 'it.JUDGMENT', 'CALL', 'Personally', 'think', 'release', 'AIR', 'BUD', 'DVD', 'great', 'release', 'Space', 'Buddies', 'movie', 'references', 'father', 'Buddy', 'heartwarming', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'film', 'children', 'course', 'buddies', 'current', 'technology', 'puppies', 'talking', 'AIR', 'BUD', 'not', 'feature', 'dog', 'talks', 'Mainly', 'dog', 'can', 'play', 'basketball.I', 'had', 'problems', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'looking', 'family', 'film', 'especially', 'children', 'are', 'acquainted', 'Buddies', 'then', 'film', 'perfect.With', 'being', 'said', 'wished', 'was', 'featurette', 'included', 'DVD', 'showcased', 'how', 'film', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'dog', 'behind-the-scenes', 'making', 'point', 'release', 'was', 'show', 'correlation', 'new', 'Buddies', 'films', 'AIR', 'BUD', 'film', 'started', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'Buddies', 'golden', 'retriever', 'puppies', 'watch', 'father', 'comment', 'film.Overall', 'AIR', 'BUD', 'fun', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'Parents', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'children', 'being', 'scared', 'watched', 'film', 'six-year-old', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'it.So', 'child', 'enjoyed', 'popular', 'Buddies', 'films', 'definitely', 'share', 'film', 'help', 'start', 'AIR', 'BUD', 'enjoyable', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

This first film does not seem to anticipate the others, so it is somewhat less light, emphasizing the boy's back story and the emergence of Buddy as a basketball star, which is based on fact. What is probably not quite as factual are the Ugly Dachshund-style scenes of comical destruction -- you know, paint and wall paper and like that -- that gave Dean Jones and Suzanne Pleshette so much wacky trouble.It would have been nice if the script had refrained from so many of the words that many parents wish were not so prevalent in family films. Interestingly, the more current films are not so rich in such language. Perhaps, back in 1997, Air Bud was still scripted in response to the success of The Bad News Bears and similar films. This isn't that kind of film, though. Lots of people really talk that way, including many kids, but not all of them do, and it would be nice to raise the bar in a film like this.My son sure liked Air Bud, so it looks like we'll probably be looking at the sequels soon.",3,"Likable boy and his dog and their sports victory movie, could have used a little less ""language""",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,1366,"['reissue', 'first', 'Air', 'Bud', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Buddy', 'dog', 'tag', 'audio', 'commentary', 'voices', 'Air', 'Buddies', 'parents', 'provide', 'kid-friendly', 'comments.Air', 'Bud', 'spawned', 'several', 'sequels', 'as', 'well', 'Air', 'Buddies', 'series', 'again', 'proving', 'how', 'dogs', 'deliver', 'goods', 'audiences', 'corporate', 'accountants', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'anticipate', 'others', 'somewhat', 'less', 'light', 'emphasizing', 'boy', 'back', 'story', 'emergence', 'Buddy', 'basketball', 'star', 'based', 'fact', 'What', 'probably', 'not', 'quite', 'factual', 'are', 'Ugly', 'Dachshund-style', 'scenes', 'comical', 'destruction', 'know', 'paint', 'wall', 'paper', 'gave', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'so', 'much', 'wacky', 'trouble.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'script', 'had', 'refrained', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'many', 'parents', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'prevalent', 'family', 'films', 'Interestingly', 'more', 'current', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'rich', 'such', 'language', 'Perhaps', 'back', '1997', 'Air', 'Bud', 'was', 'still', 'scripted', 'response', 'success', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'similar', 'films', ""n't"", 'kind', 'film', 'though', 'Lots', 'people', 'really', 'talk', 'way', 'including', 'many', 'kids', 'not', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'raise', 'bar', 'film', 'this.My', 'son', 'sure', 'liked', 'Air', 'Bud', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'looking', 'sequels', 'soon']",N/A

Amazon does not mention this at all. If Best Buy knows then Amazon should too. Amazon may want to unload their supply of full screen copies on unsuspecting buyers. If you want the widescreen version it is being re-issued on March 3, 2009.Lately Amazon has not been offering pre-orders for some in demand dvds soon to be re-issued. If they show something as out of print I suggest you check online for any coming new versions before you buy from the Amazon Marketplace sellers.Best Buy lists the up coming re-issue of Air Bud at $19.95, but I think the price will comedown in several months.
