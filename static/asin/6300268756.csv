Alan King does a great job as a manipulative executive who's used to getting his way, whatever it takes. Myrna Loy is excellent as his long-suffering secretary. The fight scene between McGraw & King in Bergdorf's is not to be missed!",4,Lots of fun,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,412,"['Ali', 'McGraw', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'romp', 'modern', 'version', 'screwball', 'comedies', '30s', '40s', 'Alan', 'King', 'great', 'job', 'manipulative', 'executive', 'who', 'used', 'getting', 'way', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'excellent', 'long-suffering', 'secretary', 'fight', 'scene', 'McGraw', 'King', 'Bergdorf', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Just Tell Me What You Want VHS

For a goodly part of ""Just Tell Me Want You Want"" I thought ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was funnier and this flick only slightly more raucous than ""The Pawnbroker"".  Bear in mind that the principals here on the surface are not nice people.  They are cynical, ruthless, mercenary and cold-blooded.  I was ready to dismiss it as a heartless exercise.  One, however, has to allow the deliberate pacing of the film and script to appreciate what Lumet and scenarist Jay Presson Allen are trying to say here.  This is brilliant hybrid of dark and screwball comic sensibilities.  Yes these are essentially mean and unsympathetic people.  That said they are allegedly human beings and they need love even if it comes as some sort of financial negotiation or merger.  The cast here is uniformly terrific.  Alan King, better known as a stand-up comic and TV emcee, was born to play Max Herschel a man amasses fortunes and collects mistresses the way kids collect baseball cards. I've never been impressed with Ali MacGraw as an actress but as Herschel's primary mistress she's given a part with a little grist she runs with it.  It's remarkable how sparks fly when she goes toe-to-toe with King whether they be romantic or mercantile.  Myrna Loy shines as Herschel's seen-it-all secretary whose as adept at picking up his cleaning as well as organizing his love life.  In less profane times, Loy and William Powell used to sparkle with this kind of material.  I remember when this film came out in the Spring of 1980 it had a blink and you missed it theatrical run.  It was promoted as some kind of routine wacky romantic comedy ergo the poster art of MacGraw whacking a prone King with her purse.  The studios didn't know what to do with tricky material like this but ambitious viewers should appreciate it.",5,Lumet's Battle of the Sexes a Knockout,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,1842,"['Sidney', 'Lumet', 'not', 'director', 'known', 'comedies', 'goodly', 'part', 'Just', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Want', 'Want', 'thought', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'was', 'funnier', 'flick', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'raucous', 'Pawnbroker', 'Bear', 'mind', 'principals', 'here', 'surface', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'people', 'are', 'cynical', 'ruthless', 'mercenary', 'cold-blooded', 'was', 'ready', 'dismiss', 'heartless', 'exercise', 'One', 'however', 'allow', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'film', 'script', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Lumet', 'scenarist', 'Jay', 'Presson', 'Allen', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'here', 'brilliant', 'hybrid', 'dark', 'screwball', 'comic', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'essentially', 'mean', 'unsympathetic', 'people', 'said', 'are', 'allegedly', 'human', 'beings', 'need', 'love', 'even', 'sort', 'financial', 'negotiation', 'merger', 'cast', 'here', 'uniformly', 'terrific', 'Alan', 'King', 'better', 'known', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'TV', 'emcee', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Max', 'Herschel', 'man', 'fortunes', 'collects', 'way', 'kids', 'collect', 'baseball', 'cards', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'impressed', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'actress', 'Herschel', 'primary', 'mistress', 'given', 'part', 'little', 'grist', 'remarkable', 'how', 'sparks', 'fly', 'when', 'toe-to-toe', 'King', 'be', 'romantic', 'mercantile', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'shines', 'Herschel', 'seen-it-all', 'secretary', 'adept', 'picking', 'up', 'cleaning', 'as', 'well', 'organizing', 'love', 'life', 'less', 'profane', 'times', 'Loy', 'William', 'Powell', 'used', 'sparkle', 'kind', 'material', 'remember', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Spring', '1980', 'had', 'blink', 'missed', 'theatrical', 'run', 'was', 'promoted', 'kind', 'routine', 'wacky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'poster', 'art', 'MacGraw', 'whacking', 'prone', 'King', 'purse', 'studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'tricky', 'material', 'ambitious', 'viewers', 'should', 'appreciate']",Just Tell Me What You Want VHS
232824,A21R2TYH4Y9I0L,6300268756,"Gypsychick ""gypsychick""","[31, 31]","An admitted fan of obscure titles, this film is one that sits proudly on my shelf and just about everyone asks &quot;What's this about?&quot; It's about life. The plot revolves around a selfish and wealthy man with a wife, and a secretary and a mistress who alternately wants and then rebuffs just about everyone. Alan King is drop dead great in the most solid performance of his career as Max the high rolling lover of long suffering mistress Bones Burton (Ali McGraw). He wants her, he doesn't want her, he doesn't know what he wants. But he definitely doesn't want anyone else to have her, especially playwright Peter Weller. Let the battle of the sexes begin once again and Max is a man who never loses anything. The very rich are not at all that different than you and I, but their problems unfold a bit differently when set against the backdrop of designer clothes and jewels, are juggled by assistants and buffers, and are played out in fabulous penthouses and mansions. Somehow it seems a bit more hilarious. A good solid screenplay and an even, funny film under the direction of Sidney Lumet. It is worth buying and seeing more than once. Look for Myrna Loy who is wonderful as Max's secretary.",5,Just Give Me What I Want,997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,1203,"['admitted', 'fan', 'obscure', 'titles', 'film', 'one', 'proudly', 'shelf', 'just', 'everyone', 'quot', 'What', 'quot', 'life', 'plot', 'around', 'selfish', 'wealthy', 'man', 'wife', 'secretary', 'mistress', 'who', 'alternately', 'then', 'rebuffs', 'just', 'everyone', 'Alan', 'King', 'drop', 'dead', 'great', 'most', 'solid', 'performance', 'career', 'Max', 'high', 'rolling', 'lover', 'long', 'suffering', 'mistress', 'Bones', 'Burton', 'Ali', 'McGraw', ""n't"", 'want', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'especially', 'playwright', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Let', 'battle', 'sexes', 'begin', 'once', 'again', 'Max', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'anything', 'very', 'rich', 'are', 'not', 'different', 'problems', 'unfold', 'bit', 'differently', 'when', 'set', 'backdrop', 'designer', 'clothes', 'jewels', 'are', 'juggled', 'assistants', 'buffers', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'fabulous', 'penthouses', 'mansions', 'Somehow', 'bit', 'more', 'hilarious', 'good', 'solid', 'screenplay', 'even', 'funny', 'film', 'direction', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'worth', 'buying', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'Look', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'who', 'wonderful', 'Max', 'secretary']",Just Tell Me What You Want VHS

The movie was hilarious.  It is about a tycoon (Max) with a alcoholic wife (Connie), mistress (Bones) and a protective secretary (Stella) and how Max's agressive, manipulative and vindictive personality affects all.  Anyone who watches this movie will never forget the hilarious scene where Bones (McGraw) attacks Max (King) at Bergdorf's.The review below is unchanged but I am happy to inform everyone that Warner Archives released this movie.  It is burned on demand.******************************************************************You could classify this movie as the comedic version of Wall Street.  Gordon Gecko - ""Greed is good""Max Hershel - ""You don't get poor by taking.""It was wonderful to see Myrna Loy as Stella the protective and sensible secretary. Also who could forget Ali McGraw as Bones the intelligent and ambitious mistress caught up in Max's (Alan King's) selfish, crazy and hectic world.  Dina Merrill as Connie was classy as usual.  I have been a fan of Keenan Wynn since Finian's Rainbow and he was wonderful as Max's old rival Seymour Berger.  Also, a very young Peter Weller as Bones's love interest Steven Routledge in his second big screen appearance.I cherish my video of this movie and hope that Warner Bros. releases this movie on DVD before my VHS copy deteriorates.",5,Just Tell Me What You Want - Revised Review,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,1402,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'early', '80', 'became', 'instant', 'Alan', 'King', 'fan', 'purchased', 'immediately', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'tycoon', 'Max', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'Connie', 'mistress', 'Bones', 'protective', 'secretary', 'Stella', 'how', 'Max', 'agressive', 'manipulative', 'vindictive', 'personality', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'Bones', 'McGraw', 'Max', 'King', ""Bergdorf's.The"", 'review', 'below', 'unchanged', 'am', 'happy', 'inform', 'everyone', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'released', 'movie', 'burned', 'demand', '******************************************************************You', 'could', 'classify', 'movie', 'comedic', 'version', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Gordon', 'Gecko', 'Greed', 'good', 'Max', 'Hershel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'poor', 'taking', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Stella', 'protective', 'sensible', 'secretary', 'Also', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Bones', 'intelligent', 'ambitious', 'mistress', 'caught', 'up', 'Max', 'Alan', 'King', 'selfish', 'crazy', 'hectic', 'world', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'Connie', 'was', 'classy', 'usual', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Max', 'old', 'rival', 'Seymour', 'Berger', 'Also', 'very', 'young', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Bones', 'love', 'interest', 'Steven', 'Routledge', 'second', 'big', 'screen', 'appearance.I', 'cherish', 'video', 'movie', 'hope', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'movie', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'copy', 'deteriorates']",Just Tell Me What You Want VHS
