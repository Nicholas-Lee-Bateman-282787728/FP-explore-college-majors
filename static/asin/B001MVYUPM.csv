1217747,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001MVYUPM,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 7]","When we first see Jan Dite he is an older man being released from a Czech communist prison. In a bit of gentle humor we learn how fortunate he is. An amnesty has set him free, after he only served 14 years and seven months of a 15-year sentence. His crime? That and other things we'll learn in this picaresque, softly ironic, slightly sarcastic comedy of Nazis and Communists, of getting along and of knowing when to move on. I Served the King of England is a marvelous movie by Jiri Menzel, the Czech director who gave us Closely Watched Trains 40 years earlier. While elements of the plot are discussed, there aren't any serious spoilers.Jan Dite is a young man with all the innocence and practical self-interest of a hungry puppy. He is played by Ivan Barney, short, slim, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a face that, one person said, resembles a mix of, when young, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Roman Polanski and Derek Jacobi. One thing for sure, he's a fine actor. We meet the young man while he's selling sausages at a Czechoslovakia train station in the Thirties. Already he has developed techniques to increase his profit, but he's so earnest, so shy and sly, and so open about it all that we can't help encouraging him. When he realizes even the wealthy will get down on their knees to scrabble after a few coins, he knows he can do just as well as they do. His determination to be a millionaire takes hold. In his climb to success we're with him as he becomes a drinks server and table cleaner in a beer hall, a young man of all duties in a plush resort hotel for the very rich, and a waiter in the dining room of the Hotel Paris, the most beautiful hotel in Prague. Along the way we track his encounters with the arrogant, the wealthy, the helpful and a number of gorgeous prostitutes who service the elderly men who have money. There are voluptuous meals that include oysters, small birds, snails and naked girls, and Jan serves them all. He develops a talent for gracefully dancing around tables holding trays filled with full plates high above his head...and for decorating the naked tummies of lovely women with flowers, or currency, or even the left-over delicacies of a dinner. Roasted pineapple rings were never put to better use.Then the director takes Jan and us into Hitler's takeover of Czechoslovakia, a marriage to a Sudeten lass who is so dedicated to the cause she gazes passionately at a photo of Hitler while poor Jan tries mightily to help make a baby. We visit Jan at work during the war, a wonderful vacation spot run by Himmler where naked Aryan young ladies gambol in the nude, waiting for scientifically selected studly soldiers to impregnate them so that there will be more perfect little blond babies for the Reich. The place soon will be used as a rehabilitation center for soldiers back from the Eastern front with missing limbs. Jan is there, serving and watching them all.But thanks to many valuable stamps taken from the empty homes of Polish Jews by his wife, who left to serve at the front, eventually Jan has his dream come true...he becomes a millionaire after the war, and one who, no less, now owns that plush resort hotel. Jan's basic innocence doesn't prepare him for Communism. At least Jan succeeds in one thing, achieving the company of other millionaires.I Served the King of England is satire, but gently served and with an appealing person in the young Jan Dite (and Dite means ""child"" in Czech), Picaresque it is, with imaginings of fast footwork, delighted sex, unexpected adventures, innocent opportunism and a funny and delightful score. Much like Closely Watched Trains, there are times when the reality of some of the situations is not amusing. I Served the King of England is that rare movie, a thing to thoroughly enjoy, with some deftly planted barbs so sharp you scarcely feel them.For something akin to the spirit of the music score, not exactly but with that love for old-style swing, go to YouTube, type in Ondrej Havelka and then click to play the video short ""Me To Tady Nebavi."" Havelka is a contemporary bandleader and singer (and tap dancer) who recreates Czech swing using the appearance of old fashioned style film clips.

1217749,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B001MVYUPM,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","... not Life in General, though that too is mugsy enough. I mean the foolish compulsion we 'readers' have, to compare films with the books they're based on. But in this case, the only reason I sought out this old film was to match it with the novel of the same title by Bohumil Hrabal, one of the great writers of the 20th C. Hrabal was also the author of ""Closely Watched Trains"", a novel made into an Oscar-winning film in 1967. It's a mystery to me why, with the publicity generated by two successful film adaptations of his novels, Bohumil Hrabal hasn't become more widely known and read in the English-reading world.The novel ""I Served the King of England"" is Hrabal's most extroverted, least forthrightly autobiographical. The picaresque amatory exploits of its hero, the busboy-to-millionaire Diti, are far raunchier and more explicit in words than in cinematography; in fact, little Diti is by no means the charming underdog in the book that he is in the film. He's a darker soul, a sly simpleton in the tradition of picaresque literature, cynical and malevolent in the tradition of  dwarves and midgets in Germanic/Slavic folk tales. The film gives us a Diti closer in nature to Charlie Chaplin in 'The Little Tramp', still sly but essentially gentle. There's a lot of Chaplin in director Jiri Menzel's cinematic realization of the novel, including explicit 'silent era' camerawork and direct allusions to Chaplin's 'Little Dictator'. The Diti of the film survives his raucous career as a 'servitor' of the vices of the Rich in pre-WW2 Prague, survives his incongruous marriage to a Hitler-worshiping Sudeten-German Czech woman of his own physical stature, survives the War in the most bizarre fashion, survives the fifteen years sentence he's given by the post-war Czech communists ... so far cleaving to the novel closely enough ... but then undergoes a metamorphosis into a sadder-but-wiser appealing humane old man. Both Ditis, of the novel and of the film, are essentially 'observers' of human folly, but the Diti of the film is less embittered and perhaps more forgiving, there in his mirror-lined hermitage.The promo for the film implies that it's an erotic comedy, and some previous reviewers seem to have considered it so. Yes, there's some nudity, some 'artistic' camerawork revealing nubile breasts, but the overall sexual content is more kinky than erotic. Sexual lust is the most ludicrous of human appetites, more absurd than the lust for food, money, power, and Idealism, all of which are depicted as follies in the film and in the novel. Idealism, represented by Diti's wife's ardent Nazism, is the worst appetite of all, the most destructive and irrational. This is a 'pretty good' food movie, incidentally. The images of the banquets served in Diti's luxury hotels are much more appetizing than the sordid nudes, although the grotesque faces of the all-hungry plutocrats at the banquets are enough to spoil the feast.""I Served the King of England"" was a novel about history, the specific history of Czechoslovakia in the pre- and post-war decades. The character Diti was metaphoric of his country, little Czechia, married by love and hate to Germany. The reprisals of the Sudenten Germans against the Czechs, then the Czechs against their Germanic countrymen, and the mutual reprisals of rich against poor, poor against rich, are all elements of prime importance in the novel, as they are in all of Bohumil Hrabal's writings. Humans are chiefly fun-loving boors and victims of their own swinishness in Hrabal's worldview. Much of this comes across in the film, but I strongly suspect that many American viewers will have difficulty fitting the story into its historical context. ""Readers"" will have the advantage of knowing that Hrabal himself was married to a Sudeten-German Czech whose family had sided with Hitler and lost its wealth thereby. ""Readers"" will also know that Hrabal didn't thrive under Communism; his more forthrightly autobiographical novels depict his economic troubles, his sternly disapproved Bohemianism, and the difficulties he had with censorship. Even so, the tangential depiction of communism in the film is mild in its satire.Whatever its relation to the novel, the film is a thoughtful comic caper, not quick-paced enough to have the viewer writhing and guffawing, but deliciously absurd throughout.",5,It's a Mug's Game ...,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,4354,"['not', 'Life', 'General', 'too', 'mugsy', 'enough', 'mean', 'foolish', 'compulsion', ""'readers"", 'have', 'compare', 'films', 'books', ""'re"", 'based', 'case', 'only', 'reason', 'sought', 'out', 'old', 'film', 'was', 'match', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Bohumil', 'Hrabal', 'one', 'great', 'writers', '20th', 'C.', 'Hrabal', 'was', 'also', 'author', 'Closely', 'Watched', 'Trains', 'novel', 'made', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', '1967', 'mystery', 'why', 'publicity', 'generated', 'two', 'successful', 'film', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'Bohumil', 'Hrabal', ""n't"", 'become', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'read', 'English-reading', 'world.The', 'novel', 'Served', 'King', 'England', 'Hrabal', 'most', 'extroverted', 'least', 'forthrightly', 'autobiographical', 'picaresque', 'amatory', 'exploits', 'hero', 'busboy-to-millionaire', 'Diti', 'are', 'far', 'raunchier', 'more', 'explicit', 'words', 'cinematography', 'fact', 'little', 'Diti', 'charming', 'underdog', 'book', 'film', 'darker', 'soul', 'sly', 'simpleton', 'tradition', 'picaresque', 'literature', 'cynical', 'malevolent', 'tradition', 'dwarves', 'midgets', 'Germanic/Slavic', 'folk', 'tales', 'film', 'Diti', 'closer', 'nature', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', ""'The"", 'Little', 'Tramp', 'still', 'sly', 'essentially', 'gentle', 'lot', 'Chaplin', 'director', 'Jiri', 'Menzel', 'cinematic', 'realization', 'novel', 'including', 'explicit', ""'silent"", 'era', 'camerawork', 'direct', 'allusions', 'Chaplin', ""'Little"", 'Dictator', 'Diti', 'film', 'raucous', 'career', ""'servitor"", 'vices', 'Rich', 'pre-WW2', 'Prague', 'incongruous', 'marriage', 'Hitler-worshiping', 'Sudeten-German', 'Czech', 'woman', 'own', 'physical', 'stature', 'War', 'most', 'bizarre', 'fashion', 'fifteen', 'years', 'sentence', 'given', 'post-war', 'Czech', 'communists', 'so', 'far', 'cleaving', 'novel', 'closely', 'enough', 'then', 'metamorphosis', 'sadder-but-wiser', 'appealing', 'humane', 'old', 'man', 'Ditis', 'novel', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', ""'observers"", 'human', 'folly', 'Diti', 'film', 'less', 'embittered', 'perhaps', 'more', 'forgiving', 'mirror-lined', 'hermitage.The', 'promo', 'film', 'erotic', 'comedy', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'considered', 'so', 'Yes', 'nudity', ""'artistic"", 'camerawork', 'revealing', 'nubile', 'breasts', 'overall', 'sexual', 'content', 'more', 'kinky', 'erotic', 'Sexual', 'lust', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'human', 'appetites', 'more', 'absurd', 'lust', 'food', 'money', 'power', 'Idealism', 'are', 'depicted', 'follies', 'film', 'novel', 'Idealism', 'represented', 'Diti', 'wife', 'ardent', 'Nazism', 'worst', 'appetite', 'most', 'destructive', 'irrational', ""'pretty"", 'good', 'food', 'movie', 'incidentally', 'images', 'banquets', 'served', 'Diti', 'luxury', 'hotels', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'appetizing', 'sordid', 'nudes', 'grotesque', 'all-hungry', 'plutocrats', 'banquets', 'are', 'enough', 'spoil', 'feast', 'Served', 'King', 'England', 'was', 'novel', 'history', 'specific', 'history', 'Czechoslovakia', 'pre-', 'post-war', 'decades', 'character', 'Diti', 'was', 'metaphoric', 'country', 'little', 'Czechia', 'married', 'love', 'hate', 'Germany', 'reprisals', 'Sudenten', 'Germans', 'Czechs', 'then', 'Czechs', 'Germanic', 'countrymen', 'mutual', 'reprisals', 'rich', 'poor', 'poor', 'rich', 'are', 'elements', 'prime', 'importance', 'novel', 'are', 'Bohumil', 'Hrabal', 'writings', 'Humans', 'are', 'chiefly', 'fun-loving', 'boors', 'victims', 'own', 'swinishness', 'Hrabal', 'worldview', 'Much', 'film', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'many', 'American', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'difficulty', 'fitting', 'story', 'historical', 'context', 'Readers', 'will', 'have', 'advantage', 'knowing', 'Hrabal', 'was', 'married', 'Sudeten-German', 'Czech', 'family', 'had', 'sided', 'Hitler', 'lost', 'wealth', 'thereby', 'Readers', 'will', 'also', 'know', 'Hrabal', 'did', ""n't"", 'thrive', 'Communism', 'more', 'forthrightly', 'autobiographical', 'novels', 'depict', 'economic', 'troubles', 'sternly', 'disapproved', 'Bohemianism', 'difficulties', 'had', 'censorship', 'Even', 'so', 'tangential', 'depiction', 'communism', 'film', 'mild', 'satire.Whatever', 'relation', 'novel', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'comic', 'caper', 'not', 'quick-paced', 'enough', 'have', 'viewer', 'writhing', 'guffawing', 'deliciously', 'absurd']",N/A

1217751,A30TW9R3R0NODW,B001MVYUPM,Mark Kittell,"[4, 7]","While ""I Served The King Of England"" often seems to be a Chaplinesque exercise in physical comedy, it has a serious message to convey. The film is narrated by an old man just released from prison in Communist-era Czechoslovakia, recalling his life  in the 1930s and 40s.  Jan Dite, who as a younger man (Ivan Barnev) has gone about life untroubled by moral conscience, but  is too apolitical to be of danger to anyone but himself. Dite wants nothing more in life than to be rich and have the attention of beautiful women, both goals seemingly complicated by his diminutive stature which renders him the object of derision when not ignored by his workplace colleagues. Dite, however, is aided in life by pure dumb luck; he happens to be drinking a cup of tea when a Czech general motions for it, and the general just plops a stack of large bills in his hand, which enables Dite to move on to a better station in life. Later, when he tries to give the maitre d at the Hotel Paris (Martin Huba) a hint to lower himself to receive a medal from the tiny Emperor of Ethiopia, the emperor puts it around  Dite's neck  instead. Beautiful women also seem to land in his lap for no explicable reason, other than decorating their naked bodies with whatever turns them on (money, flowers).The first half of the movie ends with Dite preening in front of a mirror while a Nazi speaker, presumably Hitler, is shouting from a radio about the imminent demise of the Czech state. To Dite, it is just noise, and he turns  the radio dial to a music station. We are then subtly introduced to Lise, in  classic Chaplinesque fashion. Lise, played by Julia Jenstch, better known to American audiences as the anti-Nazi student in ""Sophie Scholl,"" is seen on a sidewalk with three other young Sudeten Germans showing off their traditional German garb and new Hitler salutes. Dite ignores them as a group of rough Czech men approaches; as Dite walks past a mirror, we briefly see a scuffle between the Czechs and the young Germans. Dite is then seen watching two girls in a shop window display playing with their clothes; they notice him and react shyly. One of the girls looks at Dite, and he looks at her; is something happening here? Before something can, Dite observes three of the German youths running past him, while Lise is  being handled roughly by the Czech men. He run to them to save her, but his efforts are as comically useless as befitting a featherweight such as he.Lise is left bemoaning her fate at the hands of ""inferior"" Czechs, and it is at this point the film takes on a tragicomic aspect. Although Lise is a convinced Nazi, Jentsch plays her as a person with a need to find some kind of reason to feel good about herself in a country where Germans are the despised minority. She, like Dite, has no consciousness of the moral or ethical consequences of  her beliefs or actions. Unlike Dite, Lise is blindly fanatical in her beliefs and whose devotion to the Fuhrer is uncomfortably close to lust, while Dite has no ideology beyond his own needs and desires.  Lise clearly believes herself ""superior"" to Dite (she is seen deliberately walking on ledge to lord above him as if to make this very point). But after Lise does some ""soul-searching"" on the question of Dite's  ""inferior"" Czech blood which would pollute her own pure Aryan blood, she decides that Dite's blond hair and blue eyes must mean that he has Aryan blood, and bizarrely convinces herself that Germans always wanted to mix their blood with Slavs--even while ""subhuman"" Slavs are being killed by the tens of millions in Russia. At their wedding, Dite is clearly uncomfortable about his ""duty"" to help populate the world with young Aryans, so much so that he feels obliged to comb his hair and grow a mustache to make himself resemble Lise's hero, Hitler.Lise's appearance at the Hotel Paris causes Dite to lose his job, where the only individual in the film who can be even mildly be defined in heroic, principled terms--the maitre d--takes a stand against the Nazis, for which he is later taken away by the Gestapo after the Nazis take-over  (barely after the ink on the Munich Agreement was dry). Dite, meanwhile, is fascinated by Lise's fanatical belief in ""liberating"" the Germans wherever they may be found, unmindful of what steps that would entail. Lise goes off to war after failing to produce an Aryan offspring, but not before she finds Dite new employment at a brothel he used to work for, now converted into an SS-run brothel designed to ""scientifically"" create biologically pure Aryans.  This may sound like serious business, and it is, but it is played so tongue-in-cheek that we are made to laugh at the stupidity of it all.Once the war starts going badly for the Germans, Dite's luck seems to be going badly as well, until Lise returns with a suitcase full of valuable stamps. She has stolen them from the homes of Polish Jews, but she acknowledges no moral qualms or even interest when Dite inquires about the Jews' current disposition. Soon afterwards, the brothel is seen burning after an Allied bombing run, and Lise is killed by collapsing beams after ""rescuing"" her stamp collection. Dite uses the stamps to buy the brothel after the war, and finally realize his dream to be a millionaire, until the new Communist leaders of Czechoslovakia decide that $15 million buys him 15 years in prison.""I Served The King Of England"" is a social and cultural morality tale of the kind of subtleness only seen in political satires in this country. Dite sees everything as gray when the times call for black and white judgments against right-wing fascism (much like today). Sex and nudity is also handled in  social and cultural terms. To American audiences where ""language"" and ""drug references"" can bring a film an ""R"" rating,  and  TV-turned ""film star"" Barbie Dolls refuse to do nudity, the abundant nudity in the film may at first blush seem gratuitous, but the bevy of completely nude blond, blue-eyed Aryan women at the SS brothel seem more bemusing in their unabashed and arrogant unawareness.In the end, this is a film that reminds us that European cinema has not abandoned the lessons learned by American cinema in the 1960s and 70s. Today, confronting hard truths about ourselves is anathema in this country, regardless of the medium.",5,The consequences of amorality,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,6314,"['Served', 'King', 'England',

1217753,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001MVYUPM,mirasreviews,"[19, 20]","""I Served the King of England"" is directed and adapted for the screen by Jiri Menzel, from the novel by Bohumil Hrabal that follows the tumultuous political environment of the mid-20th century in Czechoslovakia through the experiences of an ambitious young waiter. Released after serving 15 years in prison, Jan Dite (Oldrich Kaiser) recalls his life before he lost his freedom as he toils laying gravel for mountain roads. The younger Jan (Ivan Barnev) only ever aspired to one thing: He wanted to be a millionaire, to live the life of luxury and pleasure that his clients enjoyed. He moved from a pub to progressively more luxurious places of employment with increasingly wealthier clientele, finally ending up at Prague's most beautiful hotel, Hotel Paris, an idyll that was interrupted when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.Like so many films from Eastern Europe, this one offers a sweeping perspective on the rapid social and political changes that afflicted its country from the 1930s to 1950s, from normalcy through the rise and fall of fascism and on to communism. But instead of characters who are victims of overwhelming political forces, we have Jan Dite, a single-minded, politically indifferent -if not actually oblivious- waiter. Jan wants money, women, and the finer things in life. And he cheerfully pursues them, too simple-minded to care about much else, but observant enough to notice that people all want those things no matter what else changes. His life is a satire of human ambition, comic even when it is tragic, with an ironic view of the devastation and turmoil surrounding World War II as it is seen through the eyes of someone who is just along for the ride.The DVD (Sony 2009): The film is in Czech with optional English or French subtitles. But when German is spoken in the film, it isn't consistently subtitled.

If I'd known that it was made by the same man who did ""Closely Watched Trains"" I would have been prepared for something wonderful.  I think this film is equally as good, maybe even better than ""Closely Watched Trains"" and that's saying a lot.On one level it's very funny in a European understated way (not a thigh slapper).  The two actors who play the main character at different times in his life are both wonderful.The story involves a ""small man"" from a ""small village"" whose name translates to ""child.""  Like a lot of small men, he aspires to greatness and following his inclinations he manages to work himself up from selling hotdogs at the train station to a becoming a multi-millionaire owner of a deluxe hotel.  This is all done agains the backdrop of the entrance of Hitler's forces into Czechoslovakia, the war, then the retreat of the Germans and the takeover of the Communists.The historical events are shown but only as they affect the man's life.  It's his story. (As one who hasn't lived through such times I can only wonder at the choices people had to make.)  Our hero ignores the political scene and is focused only on ""normal things"": his success and the pleasure he has found with the ladies.  Along the way he falls in love with a German girl and doesn't have any scruples about marrying her.If this makes him sound unsympathetic, the writing and the brilliant actor who plays the young fellow endear him to the viewer.  He's a regular person and does what most regular people do---stumbles along.  His unconcious innocence is finally shattered when his wife loses her life by rushing into the burning hotel to rescue the valuable stamps she has taken from the homes of deported Jews.  His pixie cutenss suddenly changes to the bearing of a mature man.  There's a wonderful line that says something like ""you become human when your life has become derailed.""The scenes of the mature man show how he has mellowed and reconciled himself to his past and to himself.  There are a lot of repeated elements in the film--the use of mirrors, crashing dishes, throwing things in the air--that add to the richness of the story.I wish I could give the film more than five stars and I hope that word spreads so that more people can enjoy it.",5,Becoming human ..,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,2335,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', ""'d"", 'known', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'Closely', 'Watched', 'Trains', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'something', 'wonderful', 'think', 'film', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'Closely', 'Watched', 'Trains', 'saying', 'lot.On', 'one', 'level', 'very', 'funny', 'European', 'understated', 'way', 'not', 'thigh', 'slapper', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'main', 'character', 'different', 'times', 'life', 'are', 'wonderful.The', 'story', 'small', 'man', 'small', 'village', 'name', 'child', 'lot', 'small', 'men', 'greatness', 'following', 'inclinations', 'work', 'up', 'selling', 'hotdogs', 'train', 'station', 'becoming', 'multi-millionaire', 'owner', 'deluxe', 'hotel', 'done', 'backdrop', 'entrance', 'Hitler', 'forces', 'Czechoslovakia', 'war', 'then', 'retreat', 'Germans', 'takeover', 'Communists.The', 'historical', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'only', 'affect', 'man', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'lived', 'such', 'times', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'choices', 'people', 'had', 'make', 'hero', 'political', 'scene', 'focused', 'only', 'normal', 'things', 'success', 'pleasure', 'found', 'ladies', 'way', 'love', 'German', 'girl', ""n't"", 'have', 'scruples', 'marrying', 'her.If', 'sound', 'unsympathetic', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'who', 'young', 'fellow', 'endear', 'viewer', 'regular', 'person', 'what', 'most', 'regular', 'people', 'do', '-stumbles', 'along', 'unconcious', 'innocence', 'finally', 'shattered', 'when', 'wife', 'life', 'rushing', 'burning', 'hotel', 'rescue', 'valuable', 'stamps', 'taken', 'homes', 'deported', 'Jews', 'pixie', 'cutenss', 'suddenly', 'bearing', 'mature', 'man', 'wonderful', 'line', 'something', 'become', 'human', 'when', 'life', 'become', 'derailed', 'scenes', 'mature', 'man', 'show', 'how', 'mellowed', 'reconciled', 'past', 'are', 'lot', 'repeated', 'elements', 'film', 'use', 'mirrors', 'crashing', 'dishes', 'throwing', 'things', 'air', 'add', 'richness', 'story.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'five', 'stars', 'hope', 'word', 'spreads', 'so', 'more', 'people', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

'I Served the King of England' opens as a light, whimsical comedy featuring the antics of a diminutive and ambitious young waiter who wants nothing more than to make money.  Ivan Barnev's peformance in the lead role is akin to Roberto Benigni's in 'Life is Beautiful,' the wonderful physicality of his humor and pratfalls, facial expressions, and comedic timing make for hilarious and touching viewing.  The story is told back and forth from the perspective of an older, wiser Dite (played by Oldrich Kaiser) who is jailed by communists for the crime of being a millionaire, serving one year for each of the millions he made.  The path Dite took to earn those millions is as surreal as European history itself, a history hijacked by a little Austrian corporal and a Georgian street thug.  That surreal history slowly seeps into the film as Dite stumbles into a Nazi eugenics program, or his wife fervently stares at a portrait of Hitler as he makes love to her (and the wife herself briefly transmogrifies into the aforementioned diktator.)The countryformerlyknownas Czechoslovakia is dismembered by German manuevers, British flipflopping before Churchill, and is finally devoured by that insatiable swatiska beast, yet Dite blithely continues onward, adopting a certain part to his hair, and growing a small square moustache.  He collects all of the mirrors discarded by a local village, because the people believe that when they look into them, the Germans come.  Sure enough, the mirror over Dite's marital bed begins to catch reflections of herr Hitler.  Later in the film Dite sits before a dozen mirrors and literally reflects on his life, and each individual mirror holds its own tale of a younger Dite.Every aspect of 'King of England' is that of a mature and accomplished filmmaker who won his first Academy back in 1966.  There has been some criticism of the casual portrayal of prostitution in the film, but these are opinions made through an American filter.  Many Eastern European countries had to make do with the bare necessities provided by the Germans and Russians for decades, so that sex as a trade for dinner became a sensible transaction.If you are the type of person who idealizes foreign films, and finds them more complicated and subtle, the humor darker and sweeter, then 'I Served the King of England' will go right into your pantheon alongside 'Europa Europa', 'Life is Beautiful', or 'The Time of the Gypsies.'There have been some complaints about the subtitles, but due to the playful nature of the film, I'm not sure that this wasn't deliberate.  A character, such as Dite's wife, will speak for several seconds in German without translation, but his response to her, or the situation itself, or even occasional pauses in subtitling ensure that everything is eventually told.  It may be that a modicum of thought by the viewer is required, and that puts some people off, and yes, you will even have to turn off your CellBerry and pay achtung!",5,"Slapstick, Swastikas, and Sex",1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,3115,"['Here', 'stunning', 'Czech', 'sleeper', 'loaded', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'may', 'take', 'several', 'viewings', 'pick', 'up', 'details', 'crammed', 'shot', 'Served', 'King', 'England', 'opens', 'light', 'whimsical', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'antics', 'diminutive', 'ambitious', 'young', 'waiter', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'make', 'money', 'Ivan', 'Barnev', 'peformance', 'lead', 'role', 'akin', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', ""'Life"", 'Beautiful', 'wonderful', 'physicality', 'humor', 'pratfalls', 'facial', 'expressions', 'comedic', 'timing', 'make', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'viewing', 'story', 'told', 'back', 'forth', 'perspective', 'older', 'wiser', 'Dite', 'played', 'Oldrich', 'Kaiser', 'who', 'jailed', 'communists', 'crime', 'being', 'millionaire', 'serving', 'one', 'year', 'millions', 'made', 'path', 'Dite', 'took', 'earn', 'millions', 'as', 'surreal', 'European', 'history', 'history', 'hijacked', 'little', 'Austrian', 'corporal', 'Georgian', 'street', 'thug', 'surreal', 'history', 'slowly', 'film', 'Dite', 'Nazi', 'eugenics', 'program', 'wife', 'fervently', 'portrait', 'Hitler', 'love', 'wife', 'briefly', 'transmogrifies', 'aforementioned', 'diktator', 'countryformerlyknownas', 'Czechoslovakia', 'dismembered', 'German', 'manuevers', 'British', 'flipflopping', 'Churchill', 'finally', 'devoured', 'insatiable', 'swatiska', 'beast', 'yet', 'Dite', 'blithely', 'onward', 'adopting', 'certain', 'part', 'hair', 'growing', 'small', 'square', 'moustache', 'mirrors', 'discarded', 'local', 'village', 'people', 'believe', 'when', 'look', 'Germans', 'come', 'Sure', 'enough', 'mirror', 'Dite', 'marital', 'bed', 'catch', 'reflections', 'herr', 'Hitler', 'Later', 'film', 'Dite', 'dozen', 'mirrors', 'literally', 'life', 'individual', 'mirror', 'own', 'tale', 'younger', 'Dite.Every', 'aspect', ""'King"", 'England', 'mature', 'accomplished', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'won', 'first', 'Academy', 'back', '1966', 'been', 'criticism', 'casual', 'portrayal', 'prostitution', 'film', 'are', 'opinions', 'made', 'American', 'filter', 'Many', 'Eastern', 'European', 'countries', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'bare', 'necessities', 'provided', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'decades', 'sex', 'trade', 'dinner', 'became', 'sensible', 'transaction.If', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'foreign', 'films', 'more', 'complicated', 'subtle', 'humor', 'darker', 'sweeter', 'then', 'Served', 'King', 'England', 'will', 'go', 'right', 'pantheon', ""'Europa"", 'Europa', 'Beautiful', 'Time', 'Gypsies', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'subtitles', 'due', 'playful', 'nature', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'deliberate', 'character', 'such', 'Dite', 'wife', 'will', 'speak', 'several', 'seconds', 'German', 'translation', 'response', 'situation', 'even', 'occasional', 'pauses', 'subtitling', 'ensure', 'everything', 'eventually', 'told', 'may', 'be', 'modicum', 'thought', 'viewer', 'required', 'people', 'yes', 'will', 'even', 'have', 'turn', 'off', 'CellBerry', 'pay', 'achtung']",N/A

Jan Dite (Ivan Barnev) dreams of becoming a millionaire.  This short-of-stature but ambitious Czech works his way into a prewar luxury spa, where his marriage to a Hitler-loving fraulein provides him with the opportunity to make his fondest wish come true.When we first encounter Jan, he is being released from a Czechoslovakian prison during the Communist era and exiled to a remote part of the country where his recollections of the past form the basis of the story.  Though Jan is not astute politically, he is extremely proficient at bettering his economic situation.  By listening in on conversations, he's able to polish his manners and kiss up to those who can advance his prospects.  From a modest country pub he moves on to an elegant Prague restaurant and then to a lush spa frequented by Nazi offspring.I was reminded of ""Forrest Gump"" as I watched this film, though it's not a comedy.  The central characters of both achieve success and move from one adventure to the next unwittingly.  They sort of let life take them where it will, Forrest because he is mentally challenged, Jan because he perceives personal advancement over political forces.

1217759,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001MVYUPM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[13, 14]","""I Served the King of England"" is a real surprise. In Los Angeles theaters for half a second, I can't imagine this little Czech fable enjoyed a long theatrical run anywhere else. It's a shame. ""King of England"" is a delightful, fantastical little film directed by Jiri Menzel, the director behind ""Closely Watched Trains"", winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 1966.The film opens with Jan Dite (Oldrich Kaiser) being released from prison and assigned to work in the forest, along with other cultural subversives. As he goes about refurbishing the run down cabin where he has been assigned to live, he remembers back to his early years, the years when all he wanted was to be a millionaire and own a posh, grand hotel. As we follow Jan (Ivan Barnev), he slowly works his way up from assistant waiter at a bar where intellectuals meet (and a prostitute entices him to her place of business introducing him to the pleasures of the flesh) to a fancy hotel in the country that caters to the whims of very rich men. He works his way up to the most grand and beautiful hotel in Prague. After he becomes the head waiter, World War II breaks out and Jan falls in love with a young German woman. Throughout these moments, the film follows Jan's rise from one job, each more important than the last, and also follows his sexual education from his initial meetings with a prostitute to his various affairs with different women.I know, it sounds pretty pedestrian, like a million other films you have seen. Which is maybe the reason I didn't rush to the theaters to see it during it's theatrical release. But I was wrong. Very wrong. ""I Served the King of England"" is designed to look like a living fairy tale, even when World War II enters the film. Every scene has a slightly fantastical element or feel. But unlike ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"", the darker elements fit into this story smoothly, like the darker, scarier bits of a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Jan literally floats his way through situations, always observing, trying to learn something that might help him later. Because he seldom speaks, Jan's antics could be modeled on Chaplin's.When the Communists release him from prison, he moves to the country and meets another couple who are also outcasts and serving time in odd jobs. The couple, an older man and a younger woman (who Jan quickly determines was imprisoned because she is a nymphomaniac) are looking for trees to make into musical instruments. Jan and the couple become friends and Jan begins to lust after the younger woman. She realizes this and begins tormenting him, teasing him with flirtatious looks. But both are so good-natured about it, they both suspect nothing will ever happen and are just having fun with the process.""I Served the King of England"" is a rare find.
