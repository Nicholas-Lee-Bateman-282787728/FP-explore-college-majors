Krohn,"[1, 4]","What in God's name was wrong with this movie??In the past few years, I've become a connoisseur of lesbian-themed movies.I've watched close to 100 of them.They've ranged from borderline pathetic to so moving I couldn't stop crying for minutes after the end!I've seen lesbian flicks with LOTS of nudity and sex, and ones with maybe a 10 second glimpse at the lover's bedroom activities!!I've seen them end tragically, and ones that made me smile joyously giddily!!And I'm a 68 year old heterosexual male!!The Guest House is one of the very BEST lesbian movies I've ever seen.I read some of the most critical reviews, and I can't understand why you were so harsh to this erotic romantic and insightful flick.It reminds me somewhat of the two movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.Except that instead of taking place in one day, it happens over a full weekend.And instead of a boy-girl combo, you have a girl-girl!!They spend the weekend getting to know each other....at first playfully, drinking wine when underage, carousing about town.After having sex, they find that the connecting of bodies---very attractive bodies, I might add!---connects their hearts as well.Love.....and falling in love....is something so very hard to explain.Sometimes, you have to just let it fall (sic!) upon you....have to let IT direct you down new paths.In The Guest House, despite a surprising revelation that threatens their relationship, things end well.(Sorry if I've revealed too much!!)Watch this movie....while snuggling with your lover....and best friend.",5,"Jeez, critics, get a life!",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,1544,"['What', 'God', 'name', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'become', 'connoisseur', 'lesbian-themed', 'movies.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'close', '100', 'them.They', ""'ve"", 'ranged', 'borderline', 'pathetic', 'so', 'moving', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'crying', 'minutes', 'end', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lesbian', 'flicks', 'LOTS', 'nudity', 'sex', 'ones', 'maybe', '10', 'second', 'glimpse', 'lover', 'bedroom', 'activities', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'end', 'tragically', 'ones', 'made', 'smile', 'joyously', 'giddily', ""'m"", '68', 'year', 'old', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'Guest', 'House', 'one', 'very', 'BEST', 'lesbian', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.I', 'read', 'most', 'critical', 'reviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'harsh', 'erotic', 'romantic', 'insightful', 'flick.It', 'somewhat', 'two', 'movies', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset.Except', 'instead', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'full', 'weekend.And', 'instead', 'boy-girl', 'combo', 'have', 'girl-girl', 'spend', 'weekend', 'getting', 'know', 'other', '.at', 'first', 'playfully', 'drinking', 'wine', 'when', 'underage', 'carousing', 'town.After', 'having', 'sex', 'find', 'connecting', 'bodies', '-very', 'attractive', 'bodies', 'might', 'add', 'hearts', 'well.Love', '..and', 'falling', 'love', '.is', 'something', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'explain.Sometimes', 'have', 'just', 'let', 'fall', 'sic', '.have', 'let', 'IT', 'direct', 'down', 'new', 'paths.In', 'Guest', 'House', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'relationship', 'things', 'end', 'well', 'Sorry', ""'ve"", 'revealed', 'too', 'much', 'Watch', 'movie', '.while', 'snuggling', 'lover', '.and', 'best', 'friend']",The Guest House

When you get to know the character's lives in any movie it can be nice to see their past, their present/future thoughts, to a limit, but there was just so much that it became too much.I felt very sleepy watching this movie and was bored. There was not much conflict or drama until towards the end, everything was mostly niceties (Rachel's ex boyfriend's dramas cut the niceties part out sometimes of course) and I didn't feel the characters' connection. The story suggested that within one weekend with somebody you can know you love them, it took on a very heavy friendship and love, but I was glad that their 'love' took some time to flourish and wasn't just immediate after Amy entered the house. It seemed like a lot of laughing and jokes, flirting with one another while they asked their 20 questions which got annoying to watch. I did like the sentimental aspect about Rachel's mother dying and thought the part where she was singing about her mother could have been very lovely if the movie had have had a different storyline.I did not enjoy this movie.

1546719,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B0085E44W8,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 5]","Love stories - heterosexual or homosexual -, I find, are difficult to review. Many a time they only involve the love story between two people, and an eternal factor (e.g. another lover, a crime, etc.) usually is needed to spice it up. On occasion, too, nudity can be the savior of the movie for some. You have to be an incredible romantic to love these films. And I have to say that, after watching ""The Guest House,"" I felt quite surprised. This movie takes a passionate and sincere approach to real love, the one that is hard to forget.Rachel (Ruth Reynolds) is young California woman who we meet at the beginning of the film, just as she is breaking up from her annoying boyfriend, and arriving home one morning just as her father Frank (Tom McCafferty) is going to work. The two of them live alone, because Rachel's mother died recently. Frank, who loves her deeply, is disappointed that she spent the night out and grounds her for the weekend. That same weekend, however, Frank's new employee, Amy (Madeline Merritt), is arriving from Iowa, and would be staying at the family's guest house, until she can live on her own. In addition, Frank is spending a couple of days on a business trip. This means, of course, that the two ladies would have some time for bonding, with Rachel taking Amy for a ride to Hollywood and other parts of Los Angeles. And yes, with little time and as expected, the friendship evolves into something very special, but with quite a dramatic ending.""The Guest House"" is a small, sensual, and honest low-budget film that quite captures your attention. The story has some interesting twists and turns that keeps the drama alive. This movie is, definitely, another triumph for Wolfe Video, one of the few remaining independent films distributors still in the battle, which truly needs our support.

The love scenes you can tell they were acting & not really in to it at all. The Girl's dad is a womanizer uses women to get what he wants & they are to be sex toys to him nothing more. So right there was a HUGE turn off in the movie. The protagonist IF she can really play the piano she's good at it but needs voice lessons as she can't project her voice when she sings and she's not really that good of a singer ether. Next let's talk about the cut scans...They were regular straight cuts with the fade out right were a commercial would be if this was on TV. At the end all you saw was the golden gate no time frame about how long it had been since the LAST scene. Now the Ex boy friend let's talk about that he just walks right in to her back yard what BULL. Obviously this must be a low budget film with the pot use & the cuts that have no meaning at all except to get to the next part the editors cut WAY too soon or someone did as there was more substance needed before the fade out cut.

By the end of the weekend, they have fallen in love, but how much do they really know about each other and what secrets maybe hiding beneath the surface.Director Michael Baumgarten has created a thoughtful love story built on the premise of chance meeting between two young women and the impact that this encounter has on their lives.Ruth Reynolds and Madeline Merritt convincingly portray the relationship between Rachel and Amy as they discover the ability to open up a secret part of each other that has been kept hidden away from others.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",4,Teen angst...,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1295,"['18', 'year-old', 'Goth', 'bad', 'girl', 'Rachel', 'Ruth', 'Reynolds', 'affluent', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wealthy', 'father', 'Tom', 'McCafferty', 'once', 'aspiring', 'songwriter', 'Rachel', 'abandoned', 'music', 'mother', 'recent', 'death', 'father', 'deals', 'wife', 'death', 'own', 'way', 'Rachel', 'leaving', 'fend', 'When', 'father', 'new', 'employee', 'Amy', 'Madeline', 'Merritt', 'stay', 'guesthouse', 'few', 'days', 'however', 'things', 'begin', 'looking', 'up', 'Rachel.With', 'Rachel', 'father', 'away', 'weekend', 'girls', 'are', 'free', 'share', 'hopes', 'most', 'hidden', 'desires', 'several', 'sexy', 'encounters', 'girls', 'explore', 'strong', 'attractions', 'are', 'feeling', 'other', 'end', 'weekend', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'other', 'what', 'secrets', 'maybe', 'hiding', 'surface.Director', 'Michael', 'Baumgarten', 'created', 'thoughtful', 'love', 'story', 'built', 'premise', 'chance', 'meeting', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'impact', 'encounter', 'lives.Ruth', 'Reynolds', 'Madeline', 'Merritt', 'convincingly', 'relationship', 'Rachel', 'Amy', 'discover', 'ability', 'open', 'up', 'secret', 'part', 'other', 'been', 'kept', 'hidden', 'away', 'others.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",The Guest House

The storyline is actually not that bad if only it had been presented and directed with a little more style.  The plot has sort of a Victorian tragedy / romantic chick-flick / Jane Austen thing going on but the directing is just plain bad (sucks terribly, in fact) and the acting is understandably nervous and amateurish due essentially to novice performers being poorly directed. A director need some talent and patience to properly encourage novice actors, and this one didn't.  So the whole thing unfortunately presents as a drawn-out porno intended for a semi-sophisticated audience.In all fairness though, I do thing that Ruth Reynolds shows a great deal of promise - all she needs is some better coaching, some better directing, and a decent break.  Hopefully for her, someone in the upper-end of the biz might notice that fact and give her a real chance to prove herself.  I could see her in something with a lot more vitality - like a cop drama or sci-fi.  She might even be great in the right sort of sit-com as she appears to be quick-witted and capable of fast and intelligible verbal delivery.I give the film a 3 1/2 for storyline and Ms. Reynolds' efforts to make a bad and poorly directed film at least somewhat bearable for the audience.  So be open-minded and give Ruth Reynolds a break, and just take a look. Maybe you'll see something shine through in an otherwise disappointing attempt at cinema.

The acting in this movie was bad from the beginning. But my partner and I kept watching hoping that at least if the plot stunk, there might be some sex scenes that would make the movie have some entertainment value for us. There was a lot of flirting, some kissing and some undressing, but sex scenes were collages of images of women in underwear. Seemed PG-rated if you ask me. The plot was contrived and hokey, like a porno movie. But at least with a porno movie you get some payoff in the form of hot sex scenes. This movie was a big plot bore with no payoff. If it had a decent plot and acting, I could have gotten into it even with the PG-rated sex scenes, but it didn't have that going for it.In summary, whenever my partner and I hear this movie's name now we groan and talk about how bad it was!
