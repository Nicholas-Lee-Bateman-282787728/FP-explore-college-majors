105842,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,0790736896,Ace-of-Stars,"[1, 1]","*Waiter! There's a ""Bat"" in my ""Supe""!""The Batman-Superman Movie"" is actually a 3-part episode from the Superman animated television series.The episode's title, ""World's Finest,"" comes from the DC Comics publication of the same name, which was a comic book series which regularly teamed-up DC's flagship characters -- Metropolis' ""Man of Tomorrow"" and Gotham City's ""Dark Knight Detective.""However, unlike the comic book version of ""World's Finest,"" where DC's two top dogs were all chummy buddy-buddies, this animated feature more closely reflects the relationship they were reassigned with as part of DC's ""post-Crisis"" reconstruction (""FanBoys"" of the genre know of what I speak). Here we have a Batman and Superman as polar opposites: Wayne/Batman perceives his space orphan counterpart as too much of a strictly by-the-numbers rulebook-following Boy Scout; Kent/Superman disapproves of the cowled outsider's heavy-handed vigilante tactics. Yet, they are more or less forced to set their disagreements with each other aside and form an uneasy temporary ""partnership"" when the Bat reveals that his arch-nemisis, The Joker, has arrived in Metropolis to form something of an alliance of his own with Superman's #1 foe, Lex Luthor.The Joker is hurting for cash, and is not having very good results filling his coffers via the usual illegally acquired means, so he breaks with ""tradition,"" so to speak, and offers to ""sell his services,"" as it were, to someone whom he knows has lots and lots of cash on hand -- Lex Luthor. And what he has to sell Luthor is definately something Luthor wants to buy... the death of Superman! (What else?)But even more so than our two costumed dancing partners, Luthor and Joker are extreme opposites, and their business arrangement is set on even less stable ground: Luthor is calm, methodical and patient, whereas Joker is hyper, manic and impulsive... not to mention deranged. Soon, the Joker is becoming an even bigger pain for Luthor than Superman and he eventually regrets having ever entered into any sort of a deal with the clown-faced lunatic.A romantic subplot between Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent's journalism  colleague Lois Lane acts as filler.Initially, while waiting for the order it was part of to be processed, I was having second thoughts and seriously considered removing this title from the shipment, since I was completely unfamiliar with BOTH animated series this ""movie"" is based on, and I really did not think it would be anything worth getting excited about. Luckily, however, I procrastinated just long enough to miss the ""changed-my-mind"" deadline, because once I actually had the chance to view it could I appreciate just how special this story (and very likely the animated series this story was selected from) truly was.Not only was ""Bat Soup"" (as I affectionately call it) a good ride in and of itself (though the animation isn't exactly what one would call sophisticated by any means), but it also got me stoked in anticipation of seeing the Joker's return to face the two 'Batmen' of the 'old' AND the 'new' eras in the ""Batman Beyond"" OAV.* * *",4,In ''Finest'' Form!,1020729600,"05 7, 2002",2002,3107,"['*Waiter', 'Bat', 'Supe', 'Batman-Superman', 'Movie', 'actually', '3-part', 'episode', 'Superman', 'animated', 'television', 'series.The', 'episode', 'title', 'World', 'Finest', 'DC', 'Comics', 'publication', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'regularly', 'teamed-up', 'DC', 'flagship', 'characters', 'Metropolis', 'Man', 'Tomorrow', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Detective', 'However', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'World', 'Finest', 'where', 'DC', 'two', 'top', 'dogs', 'were', 'chummy', 'buddy-buddies', 'animated', 'feature', 'more', 'closely', 'relationship', 'were', 'reassigned', 'part', 'DC', 'post-Crisis', 'reconstruction', 'FanBoys', 'genre', 'know', 'what', 'speak', 'Here', 'have', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Wayne/Batman', 'space', 'orphan', 'counterpart', 'too', 'much', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'rulebook-following', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Kent/Superman', 'cowled', 'outsider', 'heavy-handed', 'vigilante', 'tactics', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'forced', 'set', 'disagreements', 'other', 'aside', 'form', 'uneasy', 'temporary', 'partnership', 'when', 'Bat', 'reveals', 'arch-nemisis', 'Joker', 'arrived', 'Metropolis', 'form', 'something', 'alliance', 'own', 'Superman', '1', 'foe', 'Lex', 'Luthor.The', 'Joker', 'hurting', 'cash', 'not', 'having', 'very', 'good', 'results', 'filling', 'coffers', 'usual', 'illegally', 'acquired', 'means', 'tradition', 'so', 'speak', 'sell', 'services', 'were', 'someone', 'whom', 'lots', 'lots', 'cash', 'hand', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'what', 'sell', 'Luthor', 'definately', 'something', 'Luthor', 'buy', 'death', 'Superman', 'What', 'else', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'two', 'costumed', 'dancing', 'partners', 'Luthor', 'Joker', 'are', 'extreme', 'opposites', 'business', 'arrangement', 'set', 'even', 'less', 'stable', 'ground', 'Luthor', 'calm', 'methodical', 'patient', 'whereas', 'Joker', 'hyper', 'manic', 'impulsive', 'not', 'mention', 'deranged', 'Soon', 'Joker', 'becoming', 'even', 'bigger', 'pain', 'Luthor', 'Superman', 'eventually', 'having', 'ever', 'entered', 'sort', 'deal', 'clown-faced', 'lunatic.A', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'journalism', 'colleague', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'filler.Initially', 'waiting', 'order', 'was', 'part', 'be', 'processed', 'was', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'seriously', 'considered', 'removing', 'title', 'shipment', 'was', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'BOTH', 'animated', 'series', 'movie', 'based', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'worth', 'getting', 'excited', 'Luckily', 'however', 'procrastinated', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'miss', 'changed-my-mind', 'deadline', 'once', 'actually', 'had', 'chance', 'view', 'could', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'special', 'story', 'very', 'likely', 'animated', 'series', 'story', 'was', 'selected', 'truly', 'was.Not', 'only', 'was', 'Bat', 'Soup', 'affectionately', 'call', 'good', 'ride', 'animation', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'sophisticated', 'means', 'also', 'got', 'stoked', 'anticipation', 'seeing', 'Joker', 'return', 'face', 'two', ""'Batmen"", ""'old"", ""'new"", 'eras', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'OAV', '*', '*', '*']",N/A

Seeing as to how they'd be starring in a movie together, you'd think I'd be giving this movie a five-star rating. While I desperately wanted to give it such a rating, this animated film just didn't excite me as much as any of the others I've seen of the DC Universe. In this tale, Joker and Harley steal the Laughing Dragon(which turns out to be made of Krpytonite). Finding this out, Joker plots Superman's death with Lex Luthor for a sum of money. Lex agrees but doesn't want to be found out as a partner to the crime. It's up to Batman and Superman working together to stop it from happening. Meantime, Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane start to become romantically involved much to the chagrin of Clark Kent & that causes many a problem for our duo.Don't get me wrong. This animated feature isn't entirely awful. Actually, it is a fun film. I did give it four stars. It's just that I was expecting alot more out of it considering it's our 'World's Finest' team. To me, it seemed uninspired. Whereas the show,the new Batman/Superman Adventures, was alot more inspired than this.At any rate, if you're a big Batman/Superman fan--check this one out.

Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego are in Metropolis on business. Guests they certainly are, in both senses. The bulk of the time sticks with Superman stuff.The Joker has figured out a way to kill Soupey (that darn Kryptonite) and asks Lex Luthor for a billion dollars to pull it off. Thus, a plot involving Batman and Superman beating henchmen, escaping death traps and flying through the night sky follows.It is rather amusing and the scenes where Kent and Wayne see through each other's identities is cool. But there's no great plot to get involved in and it ends a bit abruptly.

To add to the mix throw in their equally legendary nemeses the Joker and Lex Luthor, along with galpals Harley Quinn and Mercy, plus an unexpected but delightful romantic angle between Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane. The premise is solid, though there may not have been enough plot for the one hour length. The first third is the best, with the stage being set for all its entertaining scenarios. The last third is a bit too focused on action, which admittedly many people like, but did appear to be extended in order to fill up the allotted time. Since the three episodes that comprise this movie originally aired on the Superman series, both the animation and tone are from it as well, which does explain the emphasis on action. Regarding the animation, it was a bit jarring at first to see the different appearance of Batman, and especially the Joker, but otherwise was stellar. Lois especially looks as gorgeous as ever. Unfortunately her closing goodbye scene with Bruce was all too brief, and an opportunity to please the romantics among us missed. As this movie illustrated, there will always be something special whenever these two giants of the DCU share an adventure.

One problem for Superman and Batman being able to work together, is that they both know the others secret identity, and making matters even worse is the fact that Bruce Wayne has begun a relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (voiced by Dana Delany), and this is just what was needed to make Clark Kent jealous.  Will these two heroes put aside their differences to save Metropolis from the clutches of the Joker and Lex Luthor, or succumb to their petty rivalries?After a very successful outing with their first animated feature film ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"", and a not as successful, yet still entertaining sequel ""Batman & Mr. Freeze:  Sub Zero"", both Warner Brothers and the producers of the two series' were leery of jumping into another animated feature film.  So instead of trying to come up with a story that exists outside of the standard continuity of either series, they opted instead to have the movie's storyline take place over the course of 3 episodes within the second season of ""Superman:  The Animated Series"".  This way, the continuity is left intact for both characters, and if the 3-part story arc is successful in terms of ratings, then release them all together as a feature length direct-to-video film.  Well, obviously since I'm reviewing the film, it means that the 3-part arc was successful, and proved to be very entertaining.One nice piece of trivia about the 3 Batman animated movies that had been produced thus far, including this one, is that with ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" and ""The Batman Superman Movie"" the two series' creators Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, and Paul Dini were producers for those movies and also served as co-writers; however, on ""Batman & Mr. Freeze:  Sub Zero"" none of them are credited.  This piece of trivia may prove to be why the two of the movies were very successful and entertaining on many levels, while the latter was somewhat inferior.One more thing for fans of these two characters respective animated series' and their animated movies, you can find the entire 3 episode story arc that comprises this DVD movie in the recently released to DVD second volume of ""Superman:  The Animated Series"".

(For many years, the comic titled ""World's Finest""'s lead story every month was a Batman/Superman team-up, in an era when hero's team-ups were not common)Batman and Superman's first meeting, herein portrayed, is rather nice, especially because they really just don't like each other a heck of a lot.  Especially because Lois Lane falls hard for Bruce Wayne.Their mutual discovery of secret identities plays nicely on the two characters' strong points, with Superman using his superpowers and Batman demonstrating why he's the world's greatest detective.Harley Quinn's running feud with Luthor's female bodyguard/chauffeur, Mercy, is one of the high points.The Joker's ""Dance of Death"" over the fallen Superman, adding shocks from his super-charged handbuzzer to Big Blue's suffering in his kryptonite death trap is rather chilling; in this and a few elements of violence this production (originally aired in prime-time, and then as three episodes of the television series) goes a bit beyond what the afternoon TV series can usually portray, and the Mark Hamill-voiced Joker is truly scary.  The Joker's raving laughter as he (apparently) goes to his death as a result of one of his own traps gone wrong is both chilling and in character.  (Harley Quinn, on the other hand, is just a *bit* too broadly portrayed.)(There is, by the way a comicbook/""graphic novel"" adaptation of this material -- now sadly out of print.  While it doesn't bring much new, it's a good counterpoint to this film, as it gives alternate, slightly more ""adult"" views on some things -- if you have one, you really need the other.)One question -- does Lois Lane have a trust fund or something?  Otherwise, how does she afford that Simply Incredible apartment on a mere reporter's salary?Also -- a couple of scenes, notably the lab where the robots are kept and where Superman fights them, and Superman straining to (just barely) prevent a huge aircraft from crashing into buildings strongly suggest deliberate homages to the old Fleischer Bros ""Superman"" cartoons, specifically to ""Metal Monsters"" and ""Japoteurs"".",3,No Love Lost at First Meeting,1030838400,"09 1, 2002",2002,2204,"['Worthwhile', 'use', 'World', 'Finest', 'title', 'first', 'animated', 'meeting', 'Bat', 'Big', 'Blue', 'Cheese', 'many', 'years', 'comic', 'titled', 'World', 'Finest', 'lead', 'story', 'month', 'was', 'Batman/Superman', 'team-up', 'era', 'when', 'hero', 'team-ups', 'were', 'not', 'common', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'first', 'meeting', 'herein', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'nice', 'especially', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'heck', 'lot', 'Especially', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'hard', 'Bruce', 'Wayne.Their', 'mutual', 'discovery', 'secret', 'identities', 'nicely', 'two', 'characters', 'strong', 'points', 'Superman', 'using', 'superpowers', 'Batman', 'demonstrating', 'why', 'world', 'greatest', 'detective.Harley', 'Quinn', 'running', 'feud', 'Luthor', 'female', 'bodyguard/chauffeur', 'Mercy', 'one', 'high', 'points.The', 'Joker', 'Dance', 'Death', 'fallen', 'Superman', 'adding', 'shocks', 'super-charged', 'handbuzzer', 'Big', 'Blue', 'suffering', 'kryptonite', 'death', 'trap', 'rather', 'chilling', 'few', 'elements', 'violence', 'production', 'originally', 'aired', 'prime-time', 'then', 'three', 'episodes', 'television', 'series', 'bit', 'what', 'afternoon', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'usually', 'portray', 'Mark', 'Hamill-voiced', 'Joker', 'truly', 'scary', 'Joker', 'raving', 'laughter', 'apparently', 'death', 'result', 'one', 'own', 'traps', 'gone', 'wrong', 'chilling', 'character', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'other', 'hand', 'just', '*bit*', 'too', 'broadly', 'portrayed', 'way', 'comicbook/', 'graphic', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'material', 'now', 'sadly', 'print', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'new', 'good', 'counterpoint', 'film', 'alternate', 'slightly', 'more', 'adult', 'views', 'things', 'have', 'one', 'really', 'need', 'other', 'One', 'question', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'have', 'trust', 'fund', 'something', 'Otherwise', 'how', 'afford', 'Simply', 'Incredible', 'apartment', 'mere', 'reporter', 'salary', 'Also', 'couple', 'scenes', 'notably', 'lab', 'where', 'robots', 'are', 'kept', 'where', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'straining', 'just', 'barely', 'prevent', 'huge', 'aircraft', 'crashing', 'buildings', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'deliberate', 'homages', 'old', 'Fleischer', 'Bros', 'Superman', 'cartoons', 'specifically', 'Metal', 'Monsters', 'Japoteurs']",N/A

Because it was originally done for television, this is not a widescreen movie; it was released with a 4:3 aspect ratio. And it's just an hour long.This is the story of the first meeting between Batman and Superman, with a similar partnership between their top foes, the Joker and Lex Luthor. Because this was done for television and because it's nearly 20 years old, the animation isn't quite up to the standards that the studio has established over the past few years.The movie opens with Harley Quinn and the Joker stealing a glowing green &#34;jade&#34; statue from an antique store. Batman finds a sliver of the statue left behind and when he analyzes it he finds that it's emitting low-level radiation. We shift to an airplane in the air over the city of Metropolis, where reporter Lois Lane is on Air Force One as it is highjacked. Superman flies to the rescue, of course, and has a brief tete a tete with Lois on the ground, as she suggests that it might be interesting to meet when she doesn't need to be rescued. The next shift is to our final protagonist, as we see Lex Luthor meeting Joker, who has a proposition for him: for one billion dollars, he'll take out Superman, with the assistance of a glowing green statue made of kryptonite.Batman recognizes that the statue was made of kryptonite, so he heads to Metropolis as Bruce Wayne, ostensibly to check out the results of a joint project that he has with Lex Luthor, the development of robots built with enhanced artificial intelligence to be used for unmanned exploration. Lois covers the arrival of Bruce Wayne and is immediately smitten, as he asks her to dinner (to pump her for information on Superman and how to contact him).Batman goes into action in his usual style, something that Superman takes umbrage at. Their first encounter is not amicable, with Superman warning Batman that he will not tolerate vigilantism in his town. He uncovers Batman's identity with his x-ray vision, only to find later that Batman has returned the favor by putting a tracking device on his cape. Finally, a few days later, the Joker makes his move, kidnapping Lois Lane.I won't go into more details, as that would spoil the movie. Suffice to say that the threats are very real and it takes both heroes to fight them off, that Luthor, in the end, gets more than he bargained for, and that Lois gets the scoop of her career.There were some aspects of the movie I found to be unbelievable, from a small point, like the Joker and his henchmen firing a hundred bullets at Bruce Wayne without hitting him once, to a large point, like why on earth would Luthor go along with someone like Joker: unpredictable, unreliable, and psychopathic?One of the things I didn't like is that they pretty radically changed the look of the Joker, without his trademark white face and red lips. Instead, he appears to be light blue all over, with odd-looking eyes (white irises in a sea of black). It's an interesting choice but it doesn't really work.The voice acting is rock-solid, with all of the usual choices reprising their roles, including Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tim Daly as Superman, Dana Delaney as Lois Lane, Clancy Brown as Luthor, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quin. The story is fairly typical of a television show; it's not really strong enough as a standalone movie.

The first teamup between Batman and Superman was as expected: filled with tension both over Lois Lane, and especially the way things are done.  Both Heroes take some time to find some footing with each other, and learning to work together before their super-villains try to take them out.  This character development was accomplished to an amazing degree; watching the movie you could really feel the emotions coming from them!Why do voice-actors get little respect in this country?  There should be an award for them specifically.  Kevin Conroy will always BE Batman in my mind, and Mark Hamil as the JOKER.  Even Tim Daly does a fine job as Superman. Dana Delany as Lois Lane is always terrific and makes this Lois sexy and personable.The animation was superb, it was almost as good as some Japanese animation.  the Batman ""cartoons"" are by far the best American animation I've ever seen.Batman brought the best out of Superman, and the Joker, well, is always as scene-stealing as ever.  I never felt Lex Luthor was that much of a super villain, no offense to those who like Lex and Superman's world.  I mean, he's ruthless and a genius and all, but he is NO Joker!the one character I felt sorry for was Mercy (Lex's assistant) geez, she got beat up a lot in this episode (by Harley, Batman)!  unfortunately, the music was not as good as it could have been, considering this was the first meeting between the Man of Steel and the Caped Crusader.

Well, I stand by that opinion.  After all, seeing two of the world's greatest superheroes on screen together is indeed quite something.  The animators, actors, director, and everyone else involved in this project were sure to put in the effort needed so that neither the characters nor the viewers would soon forget these epic events.  When the Joker sets his sights on Metropolis and bringing down the Man of Steel, the Dark Knight follows his arch foe, who has teamed up with Lex Luthor.  It was nice to see tension not only between Luthor and the Joker, but also between Batman and Superman.  All four were set in their ways and these team-ups weren't what anyone wanted.  But as Lex Luthor and the Joker drift farther apart, Batman and Superman grudgingly come closer together and ultimately understand that they need each other to defeat the threat of the super villains working as partners.  It was nice to see Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock show themselves before we focused solely on Metropolis and Bullock's rants and complaints were as enjoyable as ever.  As for the other supporting characters from both series, no one was short-changed.  But I most enjoyed Bruce Wayne's and Clark Kent's scenes together out of costume...the greatness was just noticeable to anyone who knew what these two do with their free time.  In the end, this cross-over was by no means a let-down, giving us all we could hope for from both heroes and villains...the World's Finest all around!

Thus, the pair forms a strained alliance when forced to  combat the team composed of their respective nemeses Lex Luthor and The  Joker.

Clancy Brown's deep  resonance has an aristocratic and arrogant air about it that makes him the  perfect Lex Luthor.  Dana Delaney as the very independent Lois Lane is  quite good.  Arleen Sorkin shines in her role as Harley Quinn, Joker's  sidekick who is as &quot;far off the deep end&quot; as is The Clown Prince  of Crime.But it is Mark Hamill who really rises to the occasion in a  truly over-the-top performance as the Joker.

105875,A3EOHYIHQM3KK,0790736896,Sean Ares Hirsch,"[14, 15]","This may be an animated movie, but it is excellent in every sense of the word. In this tape we see that Batman and Superman are selfless heroes, but they are not without human weaknesses. Despite their benevolent characters, their egos make it difficult to work with each other at times. As someone who cherishes the writings of Charles Dickens, I have noticed that Dickens is usually careful not to make his heroes perfect. (Usually they have at least some human flaws.) The Joker and Harley Quinn STEAL this movie. Whatever people may have thought of the Joker up to this point, NO ONE is likely to underestimate him now. First he quickly hammers down the local thugs and lets them know it's either their loyalty or else. He finds the weaknesses of his opponents, takes advantage of the dissension between Batman and Superman, and fights them both quite well. Despite their crimes the Joker and Harley are a real lovable couple. They function as a team, they stand by each other, and it is clear that their relationship is a happy one. Lex seems little more than the Joker's stooge in this movie. The Joker manipulates him to get a shot at Superman; later the Joker's fight starts to spell trouble for Lex; Lex makes the fatal error of thinking he can outsmart the Joker and Harley; all too late, Lex realizes that PSYCHOTIC DOES NOT EQUAL STUPID!!! I never forgot the chills I felt when the Joker and Harley Quinn flipped the tables on the naive Lex. It is in this movie that we can see why the Joker and Harley Quinn are Batman's most dangerous enemies. The minds of most criminals follow a pattern and they hope to gain something. Usually they will not bother with criminal activity that digresses from their goal. The Joker and Harley Quinn DO NOT follow this pattern. Any kind of chaos gives them joy, and they do not have to gain anything to win. Their total revenge on the helpless Lex shows us just how dangerous the Joker and Harley Quinn are. What is even more frightening is that throughout this movie, it is so easy to cheer for the Joker and Harley Quinn every step of the way. In all honesty this movie never drags. So we have a great story, super heroes that display heroic benevolence as well as human weaknesses, and a tour of psychotic terror by the Joker and Harley Quinn.

105876,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,0790736896,Simon,"[1, 1]","With the news that WB has decided to release the original Batman animated episodes, SubZero, World's Finest, and ROTJ Uncut, it seemed only right to revisit The Batman Superman Movie, AKA World's Finest. This movie was originally three episodes of the animated Superman series, and featured the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The team-up was so well-recieved that the creators later featured teamups between Superman and Robin, Superman and Green Lantern, and a host of others.I'll be the first to admit that when I heard about Batman and Superman in the same episode, I wasn't thrilled. Up until that point I was strictly a Batman fan, and Batman's world seemed to be such a contrast of Superman's that I failed to see how any team-up could work. I was also reminded of the cheesy 'Superfriends' from the 70's and 80's. What annoyed me the most, however, was that the creators seemed to have altered they way they animated the new Batman series just so they could fit Batman and Superman together without making it seem awkward. Most fans tend to agree that the original 'dark-deco' style is superior to the new one.While I wasn't too impressed with The Batman Superman Movie the first time I watched it, it's grown on me and I've come to love it as much as the other Batman movies. The creators (Paul Dini and Bruce Timm) were really careful to balance the two superheroes. Superman is physically superior and the story takes place on his home turf, but Batman has the toys and the knowledge of how Joker thinks. When you watch their initial meeting and how each discovers the others' identity, you'll realize that each can hold their own, and the way they each overcome obstacles serves as a good character study of the two heroes.The villains are equally compelling and balanced as well. Luthor has the resources and the intelligence, while Joker has the insanity needed to start their plan in motion. Even moreso than Batman and Superman, we never really think of these two villians teaming up in a buddy-buddy fashion; It's more like a symbiosis, and the tension between Joker and Lex adds another plot twist, as the Joker's insanity is destroying LexCorp property and putting Luthor under suspicion. There is an ample amount of violence here as well. Batman and Superman were one of the last cartoon series' to have characters fire real guns (as opposed to sci-fi-ish laser pistols). Besides the heightened realism from actual gunplay, there are several explosions and scenes of destruction, and some of what the Joker does is really twisted (though not as twisted as ROTJ).With this movie coming to DVD April 23, 2002, all fans should pick up a copy. The disc has a few extra features (though nothing truly substantial), but the movie is great fun, and serves as a prelude to Cartoon Network's Justice League.",4,"ON DVD April 23, 2002!!",1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2824,"['news', 'WB', 'decided', 'release', 'original', 'Batman', 'animated', 'episodes', 'SubZero', 'World', 'Finest', 'ROTJ', 'Uncut', 'seemed', 'only', 'right', 'revisit', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'AKA', 'World', 'Finest', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'three', 'episodes', 'animated', 'Superman', 'series', 'featured', 'first', 'meeting', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'team-up', 'was', 'so', 'well-recieved', 'creators', 'later', 'featured', 'teamups', 'Superman', 'Robin', 'Superman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'host', 'others.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'when', 'heard', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'same', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'point', 'was', 'strictly', 'Batman', 'fan', 'Batman', 'world', 'seemed', 'be', 'such', 'contrast', 'Superman', 'failed', 'see', 'how', 'team-up', 'could', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'reminded', 'cheesy', '70', '80', 'What', 'annoyed', 'most', 'however', 'was', 'creators', 'seemed', 'have', 'altered', 'way', 'animated', 'new', 'Batman', 'series', 'just', 'could', 'fit', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'together', 'making', 'seem', 'awkward', 'Most', 'fans', 'tend', 'agree', 'original', ""'dark-deco"", 'style', 'superior', 'new', 'one.While', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'grown', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'Batman', 'movies', 'creators', 'Paul', 'Dini', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'were', 'really', 'careful', 'balance', 'two', 'superheroes', 'Superman', 'physically', 'superior', 'story', 'place', 'home', 'turf', 'Batman', 'toys', 'knowledge', 'how', 'Joker', 'When', 'watch', 'initial', 'meeting', 'how', 'others', 'identity', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'way', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'serves', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'heroes.The', 'villains', 'are', 'equally', 'compelling', 'balanced', 'as', 'well', 'Luthor', 'resources', 'intelligence', 'Joker', 'insanity', 'needed', 'start', 'plan', 'motion', 'Even', 'moreso', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'never', 'really', 'think', 'two', 'villians', 'teaming', 'up', 'buddy-buddy', 'fashion', 'more', 'symbiosis', 'tension', 'Joker', 'Lex', 'plot', 'twist', 'Joker', 'insanity', 'destroying', 'LexCorp', 'property', 'putting', 'Luthor', 'suspicion', 'ample', 'amount', 'violence', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'were', 'one', 'last', 'cartoon', 'series', 'have', 'characters', 'fire', 'real', 'guns', 'opposed', 'sci-fi-ish', 'laser', 'pistols', 'heightened', 'realism', 'actual', 'gunplay', 'are', 'several', 'explosions', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'what', 'Joker', 'really', 'twisted', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'twisted', 'ROTJ', '.With', 'movie', 'coming', 'DVD', 'April', '23', '2002', 'fans', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'disc', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'nothing', 'truly', 'substantial', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'prelude', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Justice', 'League']",N/A

So if you're looking to buy the entire Superman,TAS, which I HIGHLY recommend,then DON'T BUY this movie as you'll be buying it twice! Getting back to this review. What else can be said but that it was a great great movie! Pairing superman & batman and both finding out each other secret identity. Plus the battle both Superman & Batman had with Luthor & the Joker was classic! I won't tell you what Batmen went up against in this movie, but it was verry similar to a battle that another well known superhero, Spiderman, had. Either way, it was a great battle and one of the best parts of this movie. The Lois Lane storyline was good also. It wasn't too violent so I watched this with my then 5 year old son and he LOVED IT! After it was done, he wanted to see it again. All I can say is that this cartoon brought back alot of memories of long ago when superhero cartoons were fun to watch. It wasn't watered down or politically corrected like the SuperFriends were, because you were able to see the heros using ALL of their powers. If you're a fan of good superhero cartoons, then this cartoon, (which again, you can see in it's entirety in the Superman, TAS)is well worth buying!",5,One of the best cartoon movies I've ever watched,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,1295,"['Just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'shown', '2', 'episodes', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'entire', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'then', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'BUY', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'twice', 'Getting', 'back', 'review', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'great', 'great', 'movie', 'Pairing', 'superman', 'batman', 'finding', 'out', 'other', 'secret', 'identity', 'battle', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'had', 'Luthor', 'Joker', 'was', 'classic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'Batmen', 'went', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'verry', 'similar', 'battle', 'well', 'known', 'superhero', 'Spiderman', 'had', 'way', 'was', 'great', 'battle', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'storyline', 'was', 'good', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'violent', 'so', 'watched', 'then', '5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'IT', 'was', 'done', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'can', 'say', 'cartoon', 'brought', 'back', 'alot', 'memories', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'superhero', 'cartoons', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'watered', 'down', 'politically', 'corrected', 'SuperFriends', 'were', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'heros', 'using', 'ALL', 'powers', ""'re"", 'fan', 'good', 'superhero', 'cartoons', 'then', 'cartoon', 'again', 'can', 'see', 'entirety', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'well', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
