1033669,A2V3M6G0BBYKF3,B000KF0NNE,Bernd Kotz,"[3, 3]",It is an excellent view on her playing and it gives you a good look on her person. The documentary gives you a feeling of a save place in the fast moving world. It is time to relax and to enjoy the music. It was the first experience with Hilary Hahn. I saw the documentary on German television. It is nearly six years away but it is always a pleasure to see it. The documentary is for me a view on her person and a classical documentary of the artist. The documentary takes care of the artist and shows her in a new way. It is not a marketing hype to make money. It is a very personal view on her ideas and her inspiration. Hilary Hahn takes us on a musical journey. The Curtis Institute is the core of the documentary. It gives us a look behind her education in the college but it is very personally. She introduces the Curtis Institute to the viewer and gives her own personal feeling with it. It shows the people she worked with especially her amazing playing with Natalie Zhu. The little things that gave her support and what frighten her. The joy on her Asian tour and little concerts she played. Her interest in the Asian culture and that she wants to learn more of it. The recording session in London is filmed. It is a focus on the lark ascending CD. The intensity of her profession and the lightness of her playing makes it a totally gift for you. The violin concert by Korngold and the recording of Mozart are the musical highlights on the DVD. She is always very cute and it gives you a short inside of her touring life.,5,first impression,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,1531,"['excellent', 'view', 'playing', 'good', 'look', 'person', 'documentary', 'feeling', 'save', 'place', 'fast', 'moving', 'world', 'time', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'music', 'was', 'first', 'experience', 'Hilary', 'Hahn', 'saw', 'documentary', 'German', 'television', 'nearly', 'six', 'years', 'away', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'documentary', 'view', 'person', 'classical', 'documentary', 'artist', 'documentary', 'care', 'artist', 'new', 'way', 'not', 'marketing', 'hype', 'make', 'money', 'very', 'personal', 'view', 'ideas', 'inspiration', 'Hilary', 'Hahn', 'musical', 'journey', 'Curtis', 'Institute', 'core', 'documentary', 'look', 'education', 'college', 'very', 'personally', 'Curtis', 'Institute', 'viewer', 'own', 'personal', 'feeling', 'people', 'worked', 'especially', 'amazing', 'playing', 'Natalie', 'Zhu', 'little', 'things', 'gave', 'support', 'what', 'frighten', 'joy', 'Asian', 'tour', 'little', 'concerts', 'played', 'interest', 'Asian', 'culture', 'learn', 'more', 'recording', 'session', 'London', 'filmed', 'focus', 'lark', 'ascending', 'CD', 'intensity', 'profession', 'lightness', 'playing', 'totally', 'gift', 'violin', 'concert', 'Korngold', 'recording', 'Mozart', 'are', 'musical', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'always', 'very', 'cute', 'short', 'inside', 'touring', 'life']",N/A
1033670,A2T14X4XOVXBTL,B000KF0NNE,Erik Ketzan,"[13, 15]","For fans of Hilary Hahn's music, this hour-long documentary is a welcome look into her touring life and personality. Hahn guides us around her music academy, the Curtis Institute, there's some short performances and recording sessions, a glimpse into Hahn's life on the road and some interviews probing her views on musical interpretation, recording, and performance. The camera-work and editing are serviceable and about what you'd expect from a television program.Hahn seems to do her best to entertain the camera but ultimately the program presents what Hahn is willing to share with the public. She specifically avoids divulging her views on anything extra-musical-- not a bad stance for a musician, of course-- but it means there's absolutely zero in the way of controversial, juicy or edgy material on the DVD.There's some bonus scenes featuring her collaboration with Natalie Zhu, but both come across as a bit stiff in front of the camera here.Overall, a decent hour of programming for fans of Hilary or classical music in general.",3,A solid rental,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,1039,"['fans', 'Hilary', 'Hahn', 'music', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'welcome', 'look', 'touring', 'life', 'personality', 'Hahn', 'music', 'academy', 'Curtis', 'Institute', 'short', 'performances', 'recording', 'sessions', 'glimpse', 'Hahn', 'life', 'road', 'interviews', 'probing', 'views', 'musical', 'interpretation', 'recording', 'performance', 'camera-work', 'editing', 'are', 'serviceable', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'television', 'program.Hahn', 'do', 'best', 'entertain', 'camera', 'ultimately', 'program', 'what', 'Hahn', 'willing', 'share', 'public', 'specifically', 'divulging', 'views', 'anything', 'extra-musical', 'not', 'bad', 'stance', 'musician', 'course', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'way', 'controversial', 'juicy', 'edgy', 'material', 'DVD.There', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'collaboration', 'Natalie', 'Zhu', 'come', 'bit', 'stiff', 'front', 'camera', 'here.Overall', 'decent', 'hour', 'programming', 'fans', 'Hilary', 'classical', 'music', 'general']",N/A

Although it is used during the brief documentary at times, an entire live performance of the concerto can also be cued by selecting EXTRAS from the DVD menu.

I do not think you will be disappointed.She's an exceptional musician and a delightful person. This is a rather intimate portrait.The DVD does present clips of concertos interspersed with commentary, which seems to be a turnoff to some. But the good news is that the entire Korngold concerto is included nonstop with the bonus material, along with a video of her playing with long-time friend Natalie Zhu a Mozart sonata duet (from their audio CD ""Violin Sonatas"")--which is a gift, since you get to see them playing, not so of course with the CD. By the way, the Korngold Concerto is gorgeous.To me, a lovely DVD. Ms. Hahn's musicality and warmth and personal honesty are a joy to witness.For classical  muscic lovers, and particularly fans of key classical musicians, this one is not to be missed.Again, highly recommended.",5,"For those who like Hilary Hahn's work, not to be missed!",1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,1006,"['are', 'interested', 'lives', 'personalities', 'gifted', 'accomplished', 'classical', 'musicians', 'case', 'Hilary', 'Hahn', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.She', 'exceptional', 'musician', 'delightful', 'person', 'rather', 'intimate', 'portrait.The', 'DVD', 'present', 'clips', 'concertos', 'interspersed', 'commentary', 'be', 'turnoff', 'good', 'news', 'entire', 'Korngold', 'concerto', 'included', 'nonstop', 'bonus', 'material', 'video', 'playing', 'long-time', 'friend', 'Natalie', 'Zhu', 'Mozart', 'sonata', 'duet', 'audio', 'CD', 'Violin', 'Sonatas', 'gift', 'get', 'see', 'playing', 'not', 'so', 'course', 'CD', 'way', 'Korngold', 'Concerto', 'gorgeous.To', 'lovely', 'DVD', 'Ms.', 'Hahn', 'musicality', 'warmth', 'personal', 'honesty', 'are', 'joy', 'witness.For', 'classical', 'muscic', 'lovers', 'particularly', 'fans', 'key', 'classical', 'musicians', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Again', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
