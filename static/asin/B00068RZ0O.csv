Within a couple of weeks I was very enthusiastic about Qigong and this video.  I checked out several exercise videos at the time and after watching each, I liked this one best.I had no experience with and very little idea of what Qigong is before watching this video.  By the time the video was due for return, I was able to do the moves.  I bought a copy of the video in appreciation for the value I got from it, not because I needed to still use it.  I do review every few weeks to fine tune my methods.The exercises or movements are very clearly demonstrated and explained.  They are relatively low impact.  It takes very little time to do the program.  Now that I'm familiar and comfortable with the routines, it takes 20 minutes or less.  I often do them twice a day.Another feature of the video I like is two people are doing the routines.  There are slight differences in their techniques.  This helped me realize the moves didn't need to be exactly those of the instructor to achieve benefit.  I'm not very physically adept and have trouble learning physical routines so this is encouraging.I'm 66 years old and find the program very interesting and relaxing.  I'm feeling much more flexible and aches and pains are disappearing.",5,Very clear and easy to follow program instructions,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,1296,"['originally', 'borrowed', 'video', 'public', 'library', 'couple', 'weeks', 'was', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'Qigong', 'video', 'checked', 'out', 'several', 'exercise', 'videos', 'time', 'watching', 'liked', 'one', 'best.I', 'had', 'experience', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'Qigong', 'watching', 'video', 'time', 'video', 'was', 'due', 'return', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'moves', 'bought', 'copy', 'video', 'appreciation', 'value', 'got', 'not', 'needed', 'still', 'use', 'do', 'review', 'few', 'weeks', 'fine', 'tune', 'methods.The', 'exercises', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'explained', 'are', 'relatively', 'low', 'impact', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'do', 'program', 'Now', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'comfortable', 'routines', '20', 'minutes', 'less', 'often', 'do', 'twice', 'day.Another', 'feature', 'video', 'like', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'routines', 'are', 'slight', 'differences', 'techniques', 'helped', 'realize', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'exactly', 'instructor', 'achieve', 'benefit', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'physically', 'adept', 'have', 'trouble', 'learning', 'physical', 'routines', 'so', 'encouraging.I', ""'m"", '66', 'years', 'old', 'find', 'program', 'very', 'interesting', 'relaxing', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'much', 'more', 'flexible', 'aches', 'pains', 'are', 'disappearing']",QIGONG FOR STRESS RELIEF - Format Movie

But you'd be wrong.it's funny the little things that pop up out of nowhere that make me realize that I've absorbed something so fully that it's a part of my life. In the push hands movement, they talk about knowing when to use your own power and it wasn't until i was going through a really crappy time in my life that I realized that I absorbed that teaching. As I was describing what was going on to someone, I stopped short and actually did the push hands movement to demonstrate the use of power.my favourite routine is the tapping series because it really seems to do something positive for me at all times... before bed, if I'm really sleepy during the day...I try to practice the work out before bedtime because I find I have a more full, restful sleep and wake up energized.The work out is about 20 minutes long, easy to fit into everyday.",5,My Favourite DVD,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,937,"['such', 'short', 'easy', 'work', 'out', 'can', 'easily', 'believe', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong.it', 'funny', 'little', 'things', 'pop', 'up', 'nowhere', 'make', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'absorbed', 'something', 'so', 'fully', 'part', 'life', 'push', 'movement', 'talk', 'knowing', 'when', 'use', 'own', 'power', 'was', ""n't"", 'i', 'was', 'going', 'really', 'crappy', 'time', 'life', 'realized', 'absorbed', 'teaching', 'was', 'describing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'someone', 'stopped', 'short', 'actually', 'did', 'push', 'movement', 'demonstrate', 'use', 'power.my', 'favourite', 'routine', 'tapping', 'series', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'positive', 'times', 'bed', ""'m"", 'really', 'sleepy', 'day', 'try', 'practice', 'work', 'out', 'bedtime', 'find', 'have', 'more', 'full', 'restful', 'sleep', 'wake', 'up', 'energized.The', 'work', 'out', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'easy', 'fit', 'everyday']",QIGONG FOR STRESS RELIEF - Format Movie

There is a lot of starting and stopping. It would have been better for me if they had created a separate section for the talking so that the movement could flow more uniformly. Since there are so few movements introduced, I thought it would also be better if more time were spent on each. I have another DVD that has a lot of movements.
