I titled it ""Italian Style"", but have no idea where the film was made.  The title was in honor of a lady who has not been given the recognition she so richly deserves.  Luciana Paluzzi admits that had she not traveled back and forth to her home in Italy she might have had a bigger career by sticking to one country.  Whatever the reason for her not being fully recognized, we are happy that she made films and TV appearances here as she is truly outstanding.

894878,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,B0007Y08TW,Kay's Husband,"[6, 6]","In 1961 a western novel from the pen of Richard Jessup entitled ""CHUKA"" was published, in 1967 Richard Jessup wrote the screen play for the Paramount Picture also entitled CHUKA.In an age when the western movie was slowly receding from Hollywood's attention, comes a very well directed and written western story. In the land of the Arapahoe sits a fort in the midst of winter, the Arapahoe are starving, having neither food nor guns and ammunition to hunt or forage for food. Over the adjacent ridge, inside the fort, are food, guns, and ammunition. The Arapahoe have been ignored by the army and are dying of starvation, having no one to turn to, attacking the fort seems to their chief, Hanoo, the only alternative left.The fort is entirely wiped out, and burnt pretty much beyond use. The soldiers and other inhabitants?  Well, all but a couple are killed. To understand this one must watch the film, I do not rattle off plots as others, wanting to leave to each viewer's discretion just what opinion they form of the film just watched.I sometimes feel, however, as I write these reviews that the film I have seen is somehow not the film other reviewers, based upon their reviews, have seen.  In this present case, if you enjoy westerns, it is beyond me how this movie would not impress. For it is far from the norm where 'oat burners' or 'shoot em ups' are concerned.  This is a story with depth of both humans and human nature. It is a varied story, but at its vortex very much a love story, not only between a man and woman but also of love of courage, fidelity, and most of all, duty.Watch this film from 1967 and see what you think. Should it not be one of your favorites, it may at least give not only entertainment but also a cause for some thought. Exactly how does it end or what is the meaning of the ending we are given. Fill in the blank, there seems to be no wrong answer.Semper Fi.",5,STARVING ARAPAHOES,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1898,"['1961', 'western', 'novel', 'pen', 'Richard', 'Jessup', 'entitled', 'CHUKA', 'was', 'published', '1967', 'Richard', 'Jessup', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'Paramount', 'Picture', 'also', 'entitled', 'CHUKA.In', 'age', 'when', 'western', 'movie', 'was', 'slowly', 'receding', 'Hollywood', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'written', 'western', 'story', 'land', 'Arapahoe', 'fort', 'midst', 'winter', 'Arapahoe', 'are', 'starving', 'having', 'food', 'guns', 'ammunition', 'hunt', 'forage', 'food', 'adjacent', 'ridge', 'fort', 'are', 'food', 'guns', 'ammunition', 'Arapahoe', 'have', 'been', 'ignored', 'army', 'are', 'dying', 'starvation', 'having', 'one', 'turn', 'attacking', 'fort', 'chief', 'Hanoo', 'only', 'alternative', 'left.The', 'fort', 'entirely', 'wiped', 'out', 'burnt', 'pretty', 'much', 'use', 'soldiers', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'Well', 'couple', 'are', 'killed', 'understand', 'one', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'rattle', 'off', 'plots', 'others', 'wanting', 'leave', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'just', 'what', 'opinion', 'form', 'film', 'just', 'watched.I', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'however', 'write', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'somehow', 'not', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'based', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'present', 'case', 'enjoy', 'westerns', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'impress', 'far', 'norm', 'where', ""'oat"", 'burners', 'em', 'ups', 'are', 'concerned', 'story', 'depth', 'humans', 'human', 'nature', 'varied', 'story', 'vortex', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'man', 'woman', 'also', 'love', 'courage', 'fidelity', 'most', 'duty.Watch', 'film', '1967', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Should', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'favorites', 'may', 'least', 'give', 'not', 'only', 'entertainment', 'also', 'cause', 'thought', 'Exactly', 'how', 'end', 'what', 'meaning', 'ending', 'are', 'given', 'Fill', 'blank', 'be', 'wrong', 'answer.Semper', 'Fi']",N/A

894882,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B0007Y08TW,T O'Brien,"[4, 4]","As westerns were adjusting to the times in the late 60s, along came a dark western made on a small budget that is about as dark as westerns come in terms of storytelling.  Riding south across the desert, a gunslinger named Chuka comes across a broken-down and stranded stagecoach with two passengers, one of them a woman from his past.  Chuka escorts them to the nearest fort, Fort Clendennon, only to find a worst situation.  The Arapaho are on the warpath and seem on the verge of a huge attack.  What's worse is that the fort's garrison are the dregs of the cavalry, men sent their as a sort of punishment.  Can Chuka figure out what to do before the coming attack?  The action is good here, especially a knock-down, no holds barred fight between Chuka and an army sergeant played by Ernest Borgnine, and the final battle is a memorable one, fairly graphic too for the times.  Not a huge budget here and the movie was filmed on an indoor set for the fort, but the story and cast overcome the flaws.  Definitely give this one a try.Rod Taylor leads a very capable cast as Chuka, a cowhand turned hired gun who meets a woman he loved from his past.  Taylor played several anti-heroes in westerns, and is very good here as he builds up an impressive kill count.  Ernest Borgnine is good in a tough guy role as Sgt. Otto Hahnsbach, the tough sarge who remains loyal to the fort's commander when everything points against it.  John Mills plays Colonel Stuart Valois, the commander of the fort who yearns for the good old days with his British regiment in India.  Italian beauty Luciana Paluzzi makes the most of a somewhat unnecessary part as Veronica, a Mexican woman with lots of money who may still have feelings for Taylor's Chuka.  James Whitmore has a good role as Lou Trent, the grizzled old head scout who clashes with Valois and sides with Chuka.  It's an all-around good cast that makes an average movie a notch above the rest.The DVD, a good deal at around $10, has the movie in a high quality widescreen presentation but since the movie was filmed mostly on an indoor set, there's only a few shots of the California locations.  No special features at all, but the print of the movie is a good one.  A very good western that shows how the genre was changing, give Chuka a try!",4,"Dark, cynical western with great cast",1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,2285,"['westerns', 'were', 'adjusting', 'times', 'late', '60s', 'came', 'dark', 'western', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'as', 'dark', 'westerns', 'come', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'Riding', 'south', 'desert', 'gunslinger', 'named', 'Chuka', 'broken-down', 'stranded', 'stagecoach', 'two', 'passengers', 'one', 'woman', 'past', 'Chuka', 'nearest', 'fort', 'Fort', 'Clendennon', 'only', 'find', 'worst', 'situation', 'Arapaho', 'are', 'warpath', 'seem', 'verge', 'huge', 'attack', 'What', 'worse', 'fort', 'garrison', 'are', 'dregs', 'cavalry', 'men', 'sent', 'sort', 'punishment', 'Can', 'Chuka', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'coming', 'attack', 'action', 'good', 'here', 'especially', 'knock-down', 'barred', 'fight', 'Chuka', 'army', 'sergeant', 'played', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'final', 'battle', 'memorable', 'one', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'too', 'times', 'Not', 'huge', 'budget', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'indoor', 'set', 'fort', 'story', 'cast', 'overcome', 'flaws', 'Definitely', 'give', 'one', 'try.Rod', 'Taylor', 'very', 'capable', 'cast', 'Chuka', 'cowhand', 'turned', 'hired', 'gun', 'who', 'woman', 'loved', 'past', 'Taylor', 'played', 'several', 'anti-heroes', 'westerns', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'up', 'impressive', 'kill', 'count', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'good', 'tough', 'guy', 'role', 'Sgt', 'Otto', 'Hahnsbach', 'tough', 'sarge', 'who', 'loyal', 'fort', 'commander', 'when', 'everything', 'points', 'John', 'Mills', 'Colonel', 'Stuart', 'Valois', 'commander', 'fort', 'who', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'British', 'regiment', 'India', 'Italian', 'beauty', 'Luciana', 'Paluzzi', 'most', 'somewhat', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'Veronica', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'lots', 'money', 'who', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'feelings', 'Taylor', 'Chuka', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'good', 'role', 'Lou', 'Trent', 'grizzled', 'old', 'head', 'scout', 'who', 'Valois', 'sides', 'Chuka', 'all-around', 'good', 'cast', 'average', 'movie', 'notch', 'rest.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'deal', '10', 'movie', 'high', 'quality', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'indoor', 'set', 'only', 'few', 'shots', 'California', 'locations', 'special', 'features', 'print', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'western', 'how', 'genre', 'was', 'changing', 'give', 'Chuka', 'try']",N/A

I must say it is everything I remembered. I thought it was a really good western. All the characters are memorable and it is a very compelling and fun movie to watch. Love Taylors character and costume as well as Whitmores as the old grizzled and tough scout. And the friction between the virile Taylor and the impotent Mills is great. And then add to it the hulking Ernest Borgnine who is Mills Sergeant and also the one man who respects and knows Mills and you have one of the best two fisted fight scenes in movie history.
