The Founding Fathers, which I believe is based on the book by M.E. Bradford, is one of 2 DVD collections available by the History Channel that discusses the lives and times of the countries' founding fathers.  The other DVD collection is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book Founding Brothers by Joseph Ellis.  This DVD collection was the first one created by The History Channel.Both DVD collections discuss the lives and times of the founding fathers (brothers).  This particular DVD collection starts with a discussion of Sam Adams and the rise of discontent amongst New Englanders.  It focuses on the events that led to the American Revolution much better than the other DVD collection, Founding Brothers.  After viewing both of them again I would say without a doubt that this series deals with pre-revolution to the constitution whereas Founding Brothers is more constitutional conventions to post revolution times and the establishment of parties / bickering amongst the founders.1. This DVD collection is well produced.  Famous actors provided the voices for the characters.2. While the DVD is certainly worth watching I found myself wishing it had more facts about events of the American Revolution.  But, as the title states, this series is about the founding fathers.3. The series did a nice job of discussing how various fathers had issues with slavery.  It discussed whether they were pro-slavery or against it and how some had serious troubles dealing with it.4. The one thing I thoroughly enjoyed about the DVD collection was that it clearly depicts how each of these men came together despite their different backgrounds and temperaments to found a nation.Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on ... or at my personal website. If you are interested in economic history book I would encourage everyone to read The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner since it is more international in scope and deals with the lives and times of the most famous economists in history. If you are interested in economic development / evolution of U.S. property history I would encourage you to read Hernando DeSoto's Mystery of Capital but note his lack of focus on corruption in certain countries.

562216,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00004ZETI,David E. Levine,"[67, 71]","If you are interested in early American history, specifically the period of the Revolution, I recommend this series of tapes. The four episodes are a recent series carried by The History Channel and although the tapes can be ordered from that Channel's website, you are better off ordering from Amazon since Amazon offers a discount. The series humanizes the founding fathers. For example, did you ever realize that dour John Adams was a very hot young lover deeply in love with Abigail and whose letters to Abigail were tinged with coded sexual references? I found particularly engaging the treatment of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. The two were so very different yet they combined into a powerful voice for the revolution. Hancock was very wealthy and part of his reason to support the Revolution was to protect his interests and, perhaps, to avoid the payment of taxes. Samuel Adams, on the other hand, was a failed businessman and a frumpy dresser (whereas Hancock was always perfectly dressed). However, the two worked together to form a passionate voice. In this series we learn how close the Revolution was to failure as Washington had only a few troops whose terms of enlistment were due to expire. However, these troops were rallied by Thomas Paine's famous words, &quot;These are the times that try men's souls.&quot; Paine earlier had rallied the populous with &quot;Common Sense.&quot; but equally important was his rallying of the troops. All of the founding fathers, Washington, Jefferson, Henry, Franklin etc. are presented in an engaging way. They are humanized and their contributions to our fledgling nation are illuminated. This series is particularly well suited to a middle school or high school history class. I recommend it highly.",5,A must for students of the Revolution,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,1756,"['are', 'interested', 'early', 'American', 'history', 'specifically', 'period', 'Revolution', 'recommend', 'series', 'tapes', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'recent', 'series', 'carried', 'History', 'Channel', 'tapes', 'can', 'be', 'ordered', 'Channel', 'website', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'ordering', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'discount', 'series', 'founding', 'fathers', 'example', 'did', 'ever', 'realize', 'dour', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'young', 'lover', 'deeply', 'love', 'Abigail', 'letters', 'Abigail', 'were', 'tinged', 'coded', 'sexual', 'references', 'found', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'treatment', 'Samuel', 'Adams', 'John', 'Hancock', 'two', 'were', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'yet', 'combined', 'powerful', 'voice', 'revolution', 'Hancock', 'was', 'very', 'wealthy', 'part', 'reason', 'support', 'Revolution', 'was', 'protect', 'interests', 'perhaps', 'avoid', 'payment', 'taxes', 'Samuel', 'Adams', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'failed', 'businessman', 'frumpy', 'dresser', 'whereas', 'Hancock', 'was', 'always', 'perfectly', 'dressed', 'However', 'two', 'worked', 'together', 'form', 'passionate', 'voice', 'series', 'learn', 'how', 'close', 'Revolution', 'was', 'failure', 'Washington', 'had', 'only', 'few', 'troops', 'terms', 'enlistment', 'were', 'due', 'expire', 'However', 'troops', 'were', 'rallied', 'Thomas', 'Paine', 'famous', 'words', 'quot', 'are', 'times', 'try', 'men', 'souls.', 'quot', 'Paine', 'earlier', 'had', 'rallied', 'populous', 'quot', 'Common', 'Sense.', 'quot', 'equally', 'important', 'was', 'rallying', 'troops', 'founding', 'fathers', 'Washington', 'Jefferson', 'Henry', 'Franklin', 'etc', 'are', 'presented', 'engaging', 'way', 'are', 'humanized', 'contributions', 'fledgling', 'nation', 'are', 'illuminated', 'series', 'particularly', 'well', 'suited', 'middle', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'class', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

In this case, they dismantle most founding fathers by attacking their character almost as election ads or biased media hit pieces do. The History channel portrayal of our founding fathers in this program says that the men who sacrificed their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor in the name of liberty that we've all enjoyed for generations (corruption aside), were really just a gathering of drunken, rumpled, self serving, low character radicals with a few exceptions. It's almost as bad as their alien life program where they bring through unexplained things in the past and later imply that biblical visions were really space aliens. It's almost as bad as bringing in P Diddy for a intillectual history perspective on the the ""The story of US"". They also jumped topics in that one and glazed rather than explain the economy under Jimmy Carter. That was a sign right there. Getting back to this disc, most historians used during segments sounded more like writers for the National Enquirer or the Globe than historians. Of course the founders were not examples of perfection (who is), but men of character they were and their words and actions justifiy that opinion. Great sacrifice was made and by the ONLY revolutionaries who stepped up for individual rights, self responsibility and liberty. You would think that ""The HISTORY Channel"" would give a little more time to their personal sacrifice at each point of the story and less on the trivial, sensationalistic crap.

This is however something very different. It tells the story of how we (USA) became a country through independence and the formation of a constitution as a true yet still continiously fasinating story. The history channel does that by telling the COMPLETE BACKGROUND (like how Franklin was a womanizer, or John Hancock was kind of a rich playboy, Patrick Henry's recitation of Church sermons that developed his speaking and ablities &amp; much more that I encourage you to find out by buying this video) and from that they show you how those past personal experiences influenced all the actions of our founding fathers that resulted in the founding of America. By doing that the history channel allures any viewer to hold there breath and feel the amazement of how as humans such different yet all bright men found a country. And with that along with the hollywood style of clear, realistic-like voices of our founding fathers and with broadway like re-enactments that makes watching this movie feel like watching Braveheart.

I found this series, focusing on the start of the revolutionary spirit to the creation of the Constitution, a bit better.It is very rare indeed that any video (let alone something for the always mainstream 'History Channe') focuses on the intellectual history of our nation. Usually, the physical aspects of the revolutionary war is focused on. The subject matter here, the revolutions intellectual fire, is not only interesting; it's host of characters: Patrick Henry, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Paine, etc. is a great &quot;cast&quot;.There are two problems. First, the documentary, like its sequel (see my review) is very one sided towards the federalists. Alexander Hamilton, George Washington and John Adams are treated as saints whereas Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson are written off as purely self-motivated hacks. Similarly, James Madison is focused on AS a federalist but his later anti-federalist leanings are not even MENTIONED.The second flaw is that some of the voice-overs do not seem quite right. Burt Reynolds as Patrick Henry, James Woods as John Adams, Hal Holbrook as Franklin, these are fine. But imagine my suprise when I found country singer Randy Travis reading for James Madison. And whoever did Thomas Jeffersons voice had equally little passion.Ryan Setliff's review below may well be a typical reaction to a DVD like this. No, it does not paint the founders as perfect noblemen, but it is accurate. Patrick Henry had a monstrous temper, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were flirts. John Hancock and Alexander Hamilton were greedily ambitious, John Adams was disagreeable in most senses of the word and Thomas Paine was a drunk.

The series goes into the lives of several of the early patriots and shows how events drew them together and how they were able to make it all work.While the DVD is certainly worth watching, I found myself wishing it had more hard facts. But that's a personal preference. They spent a lot of time on the personal lives but not as much on the actual historical things they did.

It is a relatively painless way to learn a great deal about these men, their ideals, and some of the things that gave rise to the American Revolution.I personally thought that the historian-commentators were largely mouthy and annoying.  The narration was pretty good, and in fact I wish there were a way to simply edit out the commentators while leaving the narration.  It is possible to present the Founders both as the human beings they were without losing sight of the fact that America was extraordinarily fortunate to have brought forth such men at this critical time.  At times I thought that this series missed the mark in this regards, and went out of its way to focus on minor personal quirks that frankly are of no importance and only minor interest.  The Founding Fathers were, after all, giants.Nevertheless, at least this piece deals with the American Revolution and the Founders, which are underrepresented topics.",4,Well worth watching despite the annoying commentators.,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,1009,"['DVD', 'interesting', 'useful', 'perspective', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'relatively', 'painless', 'way', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'men', 'ideals', 'things', 'gave', 'rise', 'American', 'Revolution.I', 'personally', 'thought', 'historian-commentators', 'were', 'largely', 'mouthy', 'annoying', 'narration', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'fact', 'wish', 'were', 'way', 'simply', 'edit', 'out', 'commentators', 'leaving', 'narration', 'possible', 'present', 'Founders', 'human', 'beings', 'were', 'losing', 'sight', 'fact', 'America', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'fortunate', 'have', 'brought', 'forth', 'such', 'men', 'critical', 'time', 'times', 'thought', 'series', 'missed', 'mark', 'regards', 'went', 'way', 'focus', 'minor', 'personal', 'quirks', 'frankly', 'are', 'importance', 'only', 'minor', 'interest', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'were', 'giants.Nevertheless', 'least', 'piece', 'deals', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Founders', 'are', 'underrepresented', 'topics']",N/A

Setliff,"[46, 64]","Apparently the former reviewers just haven't studied the Founding Fathers and the War for Independence enough to discern that this video set doesn't do them and their cause any justice. Furthermore, most insights of historical value are usually accompanied with some politically correct rejoinder that holds the founders in contempt. It is fittingly post-1990's, post-Clinton since it earnestly strives to lower them to Bill Clinton's level. It focuses on making their cause lofty while caustically attacking their character... with such witty anecdotes as ""John Adams would have needed Prozac..."" Moreover, most of the panel of 'scholars' consulted for this puff-piece, haven't proven themselves in any way. A revisionist tale of the American Founding typical of the mass-media, which cynically reveres the founders. The good presentation and production put into the film is still unredeemed by the shoddy scholarship. It wasn't hardly worth watching when the History Channel aired it for free on TV- so why drop money to buy it on DVD.The books, tapes and videos of Thomas Fleming's 'Liberty!

562227,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B00004ZETI,Strawgold,"[4, 4]","Nowhere in this film, depicting the early stirrings of Revolution in Boston, is James Otis mentioned.  James Otis, the brilliant British Attorney turned rebel, and his rousing speech against the ""writs of assistance"" (broad power based search warrants of the British) that coined such phrases as ""taxation without representation"", ""a man's home is his castle"", was actually the catalyst, the one who was first and foremost instrumental in starting the movement.  A young John Adams, sitting in the courtroom listening, made the remark later that ""Otis was a flame of fire.  The child of liberty was born then and there.""  John Adams also remarked in one of his correspondence with Thomas Jefferson much later in life that ""The only person who served our cause better than Sam Adams was James Otis.""  Yet Otis is largely forgotten (or ignored) in these chronicles, possibly because he suffered from mental breakdown later.  A tragedy of history, and a disgrace to historians, because Otis was a ""founding father"" himself.Other issues arose in this film, in my opinion.  While I appreciate the fact that the founding fathers were, indeed human with feet of clay like the rest of us, and want the full story told because it adds so much dimension to the overall saga of the Revolution,  I also felt some of the dwelling on subjects unimportant to history smacked of disrespect.  For example, the drawn out section regarding the state of Washington's teeth - everything from a possible set of wooden ones on down to:  "" ....one awful thing after another; bone, teeth of other people, animal,  you don't want to know about the teeth.""  Really?  Then why are you taking us there?  Frankly, I have never been a fan of sensationalism masquerading as history, and this was the chief issue I took with this documentary.  It would have been quite enough to say he had problems with his teeth; perhaps even show the grim set of teeth if they were so inclined - without the drama; but who really cares in the scheme of things?It was adequate, but there are better accountings out there that deal with the personal issues interlocked with the heroism of these people, sans the unnecessary side tracking.I haven't found many documentaries that begin at Faneuil Hall in Boston, but for those wishing to track the Revolution from it's beginnings, there are several books that do so, two of the best are (IMO) :**  ""Three Men of Boston"".**  ""The Defiance of The Patriots - the Boston Tea Party""**  ""Patriot:  The Men Who Started the American Revolution "" - by A.J.

562228,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00004ZETI,tropic_of_criticism,"[29, 36]","I was hoping for FOUNDING FATHERS to be so much more than it is.  Though touted as an examination of the personal lives of America's early leaders, and how those personal lives impacted on the formation of the country, in truth it's a very thin history of the revolution and constitutional convention.Try as it might with great voice acting and interesting featured historians, FOUNDING FATHERS can't make up its mind on how it wants to tell its story.  It follows neither individuals nor the narrative of the revolution in a coherently chronological way.  Yes, it's generally timely--each episode delves into the people and events of a particular set of years--but often the need to spin a biography of a founding father gets in the way of documenting the events themselves.  Just when it starts to make progress on explaining, say, the course of the war itself, it has to stop and give a biography of an individual.  Similarly, just when you're being made curious about Alexander Hamilton's Caribbean youth, you're thrown back into a discussion of the war's progress.With more episodes, it might have been possible to have made this schizophrenic storytelling style work.  But the problem is that there are too many founding fathers to examine, too many events to chronicle--and only four hours to do it in.  By trying to do too much, FOUNDING FATHERS can't help but do too little.  It took Ken Burns, after all, 11 hours to tell his story of the Civil War--and that covered fewer years than this series attempts.This series is thus best left in the high school classroom, or with others who haven't got a basic understanding of revolutionary America.  It works well enough as an introduction to the period.  But ultimately the series will bring up more questions than answers for most viewers.  And if you already know a bit about the formation of the country, you'd do better to turn elsewhere to further your education.",2,"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of coherent history",975801600,"12 3, 2000",2000,1924,"['was', 'hoping', 'FOUNDING', 'FATHERS', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Though', 'touted', 'examination', 'personal', 'lives', 'America', 'early', 'leaders', 'how', 'personal', 'lives', 'impacted', 'formation', 'country', 'truth', 'very', 'thin', 'history', 'revolution', 'constitutional', 'convention.Try', 'might', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'interesting', 'featured', 'historians', 'FOUNDING', 'FATHERS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'individuals', 'narrative', 'revolution', 'coherently', 'chronological', 'way', 'Yes', 'generally', 'timely', 'episode', 'people', 'events', 'particular', 'set', 'years', 'often', 'need', 'spin', 'biography', 'founding', 'father', 'way', 'documenting', 'events', 'Just', 'when', 'make', 'progress', 'explaining', 'say', 'course', 'war', 'stop', 'give', 'biography', 'individual', 'Similarly', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'being', 'made', 'curious', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'Caribbean', 'youth', ""'re"", 'thrown', 'back', 'discussion', 'war', 'progress.With', 'more', 'episodes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'have', 'made', 'schizophrenic', 'storytelling', 'style', 'work', 'problem', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'founding', 'fathers', 'examine', 'too', 'many', 'events', 'chronicle', 'only', 'four', 'hours', 'do', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'FOUNDING', 'FATHERS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'do', 'too', 'little', 'took', 'Ken', 'Burns', '11', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'Civil', 'War', 'covered', 'fewer', 'years', 'series', 'attempts.This', 'series', 'thus', 'best', 'left', 'high', 'school', 'classroom', 'others', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'basic', 'understanding', 'revolutionary', 'America', 'well', 'enough', 'introduction', 'period', 'ultimately', 'series', 'will', 'bring', 'up', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'most', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'bit', 'formation', 'country', ""'d"", 'do', 'better', 'turn', 'elsewhere', 'further', 'education']",N/A
