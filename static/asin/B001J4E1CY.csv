1205124,A17Q8HD4II7BE1,B001J4E1CY,"Amazon Customer ""Philip Ford""","[11, 15]","This version of Oliver twist  was not a bad film, in fact it was quite good. It should not be compared to Polanski's film or the 1968 film. It should be compared to David Lean's excellent film with Sir Alec Guinness. Many previous films including the 1968 film and polanski's omit an important character in Oliver's half brother ""Monks"" or Edward as he is called here. Yes in the book Monks was a major villain who employed Fagin to corrupt Oliver, And in this film Monks is a well portrayed villain who threatens everyone he meets and  tried to seduce his cousin. True, in the book he does not seduce his cousin but he does everything else. Timothy Spall's Fagin is quite good and shows that poverty has corrupted his soul. To show him as a proper jew honors the true nature of a very complex character of which Dickens only shows one side to Fagan. No this production is not a word for word literal telling of Oliver Twist but it opens up old characters and shows that evil has many faces. It is not a perfect film and sometimes the soundtrack was annoying but it was overall a good production and worth watching.",3,not perfect but interesting,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,1115,"['version', 'Oliver', 'twist', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Polanski', 'film', '1968', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'David', 'Lean', 'excellent', 'film', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Many', 'previous', 'films', 'including', '1968', 'film', 'polanski', 'omit', 'important', 'character', 'Oliver', 'half', 'brother', 'Monks', 'Edward', 'called', 'here', 'Yes', 'book', 'Monks', 'was', 'major', 'villain', 'who', 'employed', 'Fagin', 'corrupt', 'Oliver', 'film', 'Monks', 'well', 'portrayed', 'villain', 'who', 'everyone', 'tried', 'seduce', 'cousin', 'True', 'book', 'not', 'seduce', 'cousin', 'everything', 'else', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Fagin', 'quite', 'good', 'poverty', 'corrupted', 'soul', 'show', 'proper', 'jew', 'honors', 'true', 'nature', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'Dickens', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'Fagan', 'production', 'not', 'word', 'word', 'literal', 'telling', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'up', 'old', 'characters', 'evil', 'many', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'sometimes', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'annoying', 'was', 'overall', 'good', 'production', 'worth', 'watching']",Oliver Twist

1205127,A3D5CVFNIYQCSI,B001J4E1CY,David,"[36, 44]","I saw this DVD on sale in a Target store, so I took a chance on it. Luckily, I hadn't read the reviews here or I would have given it a pass. This production of Dickens' famous novel is the least faithful of all the versions I have seen, but I expected that going in. It's basically a stylistic rewrite of the story with a modern audience in mind. Had I been a Dickens purist looking for a mirror image of the book, I would have been appalled, as some reviewers here obviously were.Instead, it's a fresh take on an old story. It doesn't pretend to be faithful. The result for me is that I was highly entertained, and as someone else has pointed out, instead of looking for how many deviations I could find, I was enthralled by the fact that I did NOT know what was coming next. This in effect freed me from the book, which I have read several times (yes, I like Dickens), and allowed me to judge this fresh approach on its own merits.I was quite satisfied with the story as it stood on its own two feet, although the original story is much better. But that was a book (a newspaper serial, actually), not a 173 minute television mini-series. Were I to produce a faithful mini-series of Oliver Twist I would require at least ten hour-long segments. It's a very complicated yarn. (I'd love to film the chapter where Oliver is recuperating in the country.)The cast is excellent for the most part. William Miller (Pieter in ""Krakatoa"") was an inspired choice for what he was intended to do: portray an appealing yet fearless version of Oliver--a boy who has been subjected to the dreary trials of a workhouse upbringing, yet because of his character has come through it all as a soft spoken, kindly little soul. Adam Arnold as Dodger presents a new ""twist"" on the character, who is shown as being quite sensitive and vulnerable, and in love with Nancy (who throws him over for Oliver). Bill Sykes is played by Tom Hardy, and while he looks fine in the part, his accent is so extreme I could only understand ever tenth word. He also suffers in my eyes because he's no Robert Newton. That holds true with every other actor who has played Sykes. Similarly, Timothy Spall is no Alec Guiness. I had a hard time swallowing his Fagin, but again this is a rewrite of the story and he does an adequate job with the writer's reconstruction of the character. Mr. Brownlow is played by the ubiquitous Edward? Fox (is he William, James or Edward? I wish he'd make up his mind).If it sounds like I'm having fun with this review, it's probably because I had fun watching this DVD. The extra on the disk is a ""making-of"" documentary. I enjoyed meeting Will Miller, Sophie Okonedo (Nancy), and others. However, when you listen to the writer, Sarah Phelps, you begin to get an insight into why this Oliver Twist is so different from all the others. She strikes me as an angry, over-the-top liberal who has strong opinions on Dickens and other societal matters. She rubbed me the wrong way, but at the same time I did like very much what she produced. So there you have it in a nutshell.The music didn't bother me one little bit. In fact, its spirited tone fit the revised character of Oliver very well, and I felt it was perfect for this particular production. William Miller is a handsome, lovable boy, and I was very pleased to see Oliver Twist as an engaging, sturdy and athletic youngster for once instead of the meek, frail waif we have always seen, a character who we are to pity. It's a fresh outlook. The rest of the cast, the authentic costuming and backgrounds, yes and even the heavily rewritten story, support this new twist on Oliver Twist very well.It's a good movie. Don't miss it. Take the sour apple reviews with a grain of salt.",5,If you compare it to the book you miss the point,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,3722,"['saw', 'DVD', 'sale', 'Target', 'store', 'took', 'chance', 'Luckily', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'pass', 'production', 'Dickens', 'famous', 'novel', 'least', 'faithful', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'expected', 'going', 'basically', 'stylistic', 'rewrite', 'story', 'modern', 'audience', 'mind', 'Had', 'been', 'Dickens', 'purist', 'looking', 'mirror', 'image', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appalled', 'reviewers', 'here', 'obviously', 'were.Instead', 'fresh', 'take', 'old', 'story', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'faithful', 'result', 'was', 'highly', 'entertained', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'instead', 'looking', 'how', 'many', 'deviations', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'enthralled', 'fact', 'did', 'NOT', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'effect', 'freed', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'times', 'yes', 'like', 'Dickens', 'allowed', 'judge', 'fresh', 'approach', 'own', 'merits.I', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'story', 'stood', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'original', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'book', 'newspaper', 'serial', 'actually', 'not', '173', 'minute', 'television', 'mini-series', 'Were', 'produce', 'faithful', 'mini-series', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'would', 'require', 'least', 'ten', 'hour-long', 'segments', 'very', 'complicated', 'yarn', ""'d"", 'love', 'film', 'chapter', 'where', 'Oliver', 'recuperating', 'country', 'cast', 'excellent', 'most', 'part', 'William', 'Miller', 'Pieter', 'Krakatoa', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'do', 'portray', 'appealing', 'yet', 'fearless', 'version', 'Oliver', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'subjected', 'dreary', 'trials', 'workhouse', 'upbringing', 'yet', 'character', 'come', 'soft', 'spoken', 'kindly', 'little', 'soul', 'Adam', 'Arnold', 'Dodger', 'new', 'twist', 'character', 'who', 'shown', 'being', 'quite', 'sensitive', 'vulnerable', 'love', 'Nancy', 'who', 'Oliver', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'fine', 'part', 'accent', 'so', 'extreme', 'could', 'only', 'understand', 'ever', 'tenth', 'word', 'also', 'eyes', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'true', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Sykes', 'Similarly', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'Fagin', 'again', 'rewrite', 'story', 'adequate', 'job', 'writer', 'reconstruction', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'played', 'ubiquitous', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'William', 'James', 'Edward', 'wish', ""'d"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', ""'m"", 'having', 'fun', 'review', 'probably', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'DVD', 'extra', 'disk', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'enjoyed', 'meeting', 'Will', 'Miller', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'Nancy', 'others', 'However', 'when', 'listen', 'writer', 'Sarah', 'Phelps', 'begin', 'get', 'insight', 'why', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'so', 'different', 'others', 'angry', 'over-the-top', 'liberal', 'who', 'strong', 'opinions', 'Dickens', 'other', 'societal', 'matters', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'same', 'time', 'did', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'produced', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'nutshell.The', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'fact', 'spirited', 'tone', 'fit', 'revised', 'character', 'Oliver', 'very', 'well', 'felt', 'was', 'perfect', 'particular', 'production', 'William', 'Miller', 'handsome', 'lovable', 'boy', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'engaging', 'sturdy', 'athletic', 'youngster', 'once', 'instead', 'meek', 'frail', 'waif', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'character', 'who', 'are', 'pity', 'fresh', 'outlook', 'rest', 'cast', 'authentic', 'costuming', 'backgrounds', 'yes', 'even', 'heavily', 'rewritten', 'story', 'support', 'new', 'twist', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'very', 'well.It', 'good', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Take', 'sour', 'apple', 'reviews', 'grain', 'salt']",Oliver Twist

1205129,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B001J4E1CY,HAMLET,"[3, 7]","The only reason I even bothered to give this atrocious miniseries two stars is because I loved how tender Nancy & Rose were with Oliver in this re-interpretation of Charles Dickens' classic (originally published in serial form between 1837-1838 in ""Bentley's Miscellany""). Other than that, it was a very, very, very poor version of the novel. Firstly, there were some sexual references and an implied sexual relationship between Noah & Charlotte. Secondly, the mood was too light. Thirdly, Nancy was black. Fourthly, the relationships were so changed from what they were in the novel that I barely recognized it as being based on the book. Fifthly, the villains were not even on-half as menacing as in the novel. SPOILER ALERT: Sixthly, Mr. & Mrs. Bumble weren't even punished. Seventhly (and my last point), Oliver talked back. Back then, if you talked back, you got smacked around, and in the novel, Oliver was smart enough to avoid doing that. I did, however, enjoy the scenes with Nancy, Oliver & Rose (especially the look on Rose's face when she realized something crucial and a passionate speech she gave on Oliver's behalf in Episode III), particularly one scene where Rose & Oliver are playing the piano together. I love those scenes. They're the only reason I even bothered to watch this atrocious miniseries. If you want to see a version that's close to the book, the best one out there (as far as I can tell) is the 1985 BBC version starring Eric Porter as Fagin. While it does have its faults, it's better than the musical version, the 1999 Masterpiece Theater version (though I liked a few scenes here and there) and even the 1922 version.

However, I really can't understand why this version was made as it strays so far from the book and can't seem to make up its mind about what it intends to be. The modern soundtrack music was jarring to me and not at all fitting with the desperate situations the film presents. The sets must have been built on a shoestring budget. I am a high school English teacher, and my students commented on the cheap looking scenery and how it made the movie look like it was made for tv twenty years ago. I know a screenwriter is free to choose what details to leave out or change, but I couldn't fathom the purpose for most of them except to twist Dickens' meanings to fit our times. For example, Sikes' means of death was changed in the movie to give it a very different spin than the book had, and the only reason I can think of would be to make the viewer feel sorry for him. Basically, I didn't ""get"" this movie. I tried to keep an open mind as I watched, but I ended up just feeling let down.

With vivid characters one loves to hate ever plotting against the defenseless in a society notorious for exploiting and oppressing women, the poor and the different, this movie streamlines the monumental opus that is Oliver Twist into a classic tale of good vs evil for the 21st century.It's ridiculous to cavil at a filmmaker for failing to stick to every detail of an 800 page novel when making a three hour movie.  This version of Oliver Twist is no exception.  Yes, some of the story was changed to fit time, budget and casting constraints, but the result is faithful to the overall tone and plot of Dickens' novel, making it accessible to a new generation.  It is well worth watching.This film is particularly effective in portraying 19th century anti-Semitism.  If the details of Fagin's character and treatment were changed to convey this, it is an integral part of the story and in this PC age, I was delighted.  Mrs. Sowerberry's hat collection served to illustrate the hypocrisy of the characters and skewering hypocrisy was one of Dickens' favorite themes. If the fimmakers took liberties with the details, the overall message was very Dickensian.The dissonant soundtrack created a sense of urgency, unease and danger, and the production values were impeccable--the dirt and darkness of the workhouse and thieves' den in contrast to the light interiors and costumes of the Brownlow household--and did much to add to the atmosphere.

They bring a creepy slumdog vitality to an old and well-loved story.",5,FRESH AND VITAL,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,821,"['first', 'reviewer', 'Mr.', 'Raker', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'book', 'Purists', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teachers', 'can', 'go', 'showing', 'David', 'Lean', 'classic', 'B', 'W', 'fresh', 'creative', 'vision', 'screenwriter', 'Sarah', 'Phelps', 'done', 'something', 'remarkable', 'given', 'Dickens', 'impossibly', 'precious', 'title', 'character', 'spine', 'Oliver', 'up', 'tormentors', 'cruel', 'handicap', 'being', 'young', 'result', 'longer', 'pity', 'lad', 'actually', 'care', 'him.It', 'was', 'unseemly', 'torpedo', 'excellent', 're-visioning', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'tautly', 'directed', 'Coky', 'Giedroyc', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'PBS', 'clearly', 'was', 'made', 'intelligent', 'artists', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'deviate', 'original', 'just', 'be', 'different', 'bring', 'creepy', 'slumdog', 'vitality', 'old', 'well-loved', 'story']",Oliver Twist

As it opens, you can tell it had great production values -- costuming, set design, all superb.  It opens with a slight but forgiveable deviation from the original.  Unfortunately, the deviations grow ever larger through the course of the movie to point that it dropped from being a 4.5 star rendition to 2 stars.I don't mind someone thinking they can try to improve on Dickens' material -- the musical version was indeed an improvement in many ways -- but these unnecessary changes, from the constant focus on Fagin's Jewishness (including his final court scene) to Bill Sikes' final kidnapping of Oliver and run through the streets of London, were no improvement.  Even poor Mr. Bumble's unhappy marriage to Ms. Corney is rewritten to suit someone's ego.  The little psycho drama with Bill Sikes at the end instead of using Dickens' original dramatic ending was as pathetic as the ego that conjured it up and was very much out of character.  I don't know whether to blame Ms. Sarah Phelps (credited with writing) or Coky Giedroyc (credited as director) but I found this truly upsetting.Timothy Spall turns in a highly original version of Fagin.  He's not at all what one pictures after seeing Ron Moody or Ben Kingsley but he is quite believable in the role.  Sophie Okonedo also gives a slightly different but acceptable twist as Nancy.  Her performance is powerful until ruined at the end by the aforementioned psychodrama.  Edward Fox's Mr. Brownlow was less charitable than seen in other renditions but a powerful performance (as always true of Mr. Fox) and strangely in character even when inconsistent with Dickens' masterpiece.  William Miller's Oliver Twist just felt ... bland.  He just doesn't convey the sense of innocent naivete Mark Lester gave the role; he almost seemed like he'd have had more fun if he'd been able to play the Artful Dodger.In the end, while this aired on PBS's Masterpiece, it is far from one.  The superb photography, set and costume design cannot compensate for the unnecessary changes to the material.  If you're a Dickens fan, do yourself a favor and watch any other version of this story -- even one of the Disney renditions.",2,A Twist on Dickens' work,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,2245,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Dickens', 'Bicentennial', 'year', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'costuming', 'set', 'design', 'superb', 'slight', 'forgiveable', 'deviation', 'original', 'Unfortunately', 'deviations', 'grow', 'ever', 'larger', 'course', 'movie', 'point', 'dropped', 'being', '4.5', 'star', 'rendition', '2', 'stars.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'someone', 'thinking', 'can', 'try', 'improve', 'Dickens', 'material', 'musical', 'version', 'was', 'indeed', 'improvement', 'many', 'ways', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'constant', 'focus', 'Fagin', 'Jewishness', 'including', 'final', 'court', 'scene', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'final', 'kidnapping', 'Oliver', 'run', 'streets', 'London', 'were', 'improvement', 'Even', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Ms.', 'Corney', 'rewritten', 'suit', 'someone', 'ego', 'little', 'psycho', 'drama', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'end', 'instead', 'using', 'Dickens', 'original', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'was', 'as', 'pathetic', 'ego', 'conjured', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'blame', 'Ms.', 'Sarah', 'Phelps', 'credited', 'writing', 'Coky', 'Giedroyc', 'credited', 'director', 'found', 'truly', 'upsetting.Timothy', 'Spall', 'highly', 'original', 'version', 'Fagin', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'seeing', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'quite', 'believable', 'role', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'also', 'slightly', 'different', 'acceptable', 'twist', 'Nancy', 'performance', 'powerful', 'ruined', 'end', 'aforementioned', 'psychodrama', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'was', 'less', 'charitable', 'seen', 'other', 'renditions', 'powerful', 'performance', 'always', 'true', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'strangely', 'character', 'even', 'when', 'inconsistent', 'Dickens', 'masterpiece', 'William', 'Miller', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'just', 'felt', 'bland', 'just', ""n't"", 'convey', 'sense', 'innocent', 'naivete', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'gave', 'role', 'almost', 'seemed', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'more', 'fun', ""'d"", 'been', 'able', 'play', 'Artful', 'Dodger.In', 'end', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'far', 'one', 'superb', 'photography', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'material', ""'re"", 'Dickens', 'fan', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'other', 'version', 'story', 'even', 'one', 'Disney', 'renditions']",Oliver Twist

Besides deviating from the values and intent of the novel, however, this version also fails in characterization. There are boo-coo fascinating and exciting characters in Dickens's novel, and the temptation is to get deep into the minds of all of them to interpret their actions and worldview. You can't do this without getting too far away from the main thread of the plot. The effect is far too muddy. This film gets close to the bad guys in a way that makes their actions seem comprehensible, which is exactly the opposite effect of the book. The Artful Dodger, for example, is potrayed in the book as having some swagger and artistic flair, but as internally darkened -- as deeply as a boy can be. The Dodger in this film is a fully likeable character. He could be the kid next door. There are many such examples. Strangely enough, the novel's ""good"" characters are here potrayed as grittier, moodier, more steely. The bad guys get softer and the good guys more hard-core. ???",2,"Touchy Feely Bad Guys, Gritty Good Guys",1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1102,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'can', 'find', 'merit', 'even', 'poor', 'largely', 'unfaithful', 'adaption', 'such', 'one', 'deviating', 'values', 'intent', 'novel', 'however', 'version', 'also', 'characterization', 'are', 'boo-coo', 'fascinating', 'exciting', 'characters', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'temptation', 'get', 'deep', 'minds', 'interpret', 'actions', 'worldview', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'getting', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'main', 'thread', 'plot', 'effect', 'far', 'too', 'muddy', 'film', 'close', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'actions', 'seem', 'comprehensible', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'effect', 'book', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'example', 'potrayed', 'book', 'having', 'swagger', 'artistic', 'flair', 'internally', 'darkened', 'as', 'deeply', 'boy', 'can', 'be', 'Dodger', 'film', 'fully', 'likeable', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'examples', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'novel', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'potrayed', 'grittier', 'moodier', 'more', 'steely', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'softer', 'good', 'guys', 'more', 'hard-core']",Oliver Twist
