1054863,A2RQS7X7FI3C6E,B000NA1VI2,AAI,"[0, 0]","The final season of The Sopranos is a satisfying end to a fantastic television series that has captured my interest for nearly a decade. This show was the reason I subscribed to HBO and Sunday nights at 9 pm were a sacred hour when this show was on. While I am well aware of the criticism that the series finale drew for its abrupt end; it certainly is not a bad episode and it is much better after a second viewing. The season as a whole contained many gripping story arcs and once again the writing is top notch. Over the years I have developed a liking towards many of the characters; therefore, it was sad for me to see this show conclude and see the demise of many characters I have grown to like. I equate the first half of the show as a farewell tour that sets up the plot for the riveting second half which crosses the Rubicon in terms of war between the two families. The last five episodes of this show are among the best in the series' history but the true gem of the bunch is the penultimate episode The Blue Comet. I equate that episode to DEFCOM 1 as an absolute state of emergency ensues for the Soprano crime family. I was on the edge of my seat during much of that episode due to the fact that I didn't know what would happen next. I recommend purchasing this series on DVD simply it has a lot of replay value. I have watched this show countless times in comparison to just about everything else in my DVD library. I have found that re-watching this season on DVD to be more enjoyable to watching it when it aired in the spring of 2007. This is due to the fact that I can pick up on elements that I overlooked the first time I watched it. All of this said, I probably don't even have to recommend purchasing this season because chances are if you are a true fan of the show you probably own the previous seasons of the show and will buy this one anyway. Owning this show on DVD is much better than watching the abridged edition which airs on A&E.; Watching the syndicated version is about as satisfying as drinking a can of Natty Light with a fine meal. Without sounding like a hired gun for HBO the only other shows that can hold a candle to the great writing on this show are The Wire, Six Feet Under, and The Shield which is on FX. I also recommend those three shows but The Wire certainly can hold its own and even best the Sopranos in some ways. Even though I am a big fan of The Wire, I enjoy the character development of The Sopranos more so and it is essential to view this season to see how things end for Tony Soprano and other characters we have grown to either love or hate.Season 6 Part 2 Grade: A - (92%)DVD special features: B - (82%) Although the main menu has a slick interface.",5,A satisfying end to a fantastic series,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2712,"['final', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'satisfying', 'end', 'fantastic', 'television', 'series', 'captured', 'interest', 'nearly', 'decade', 'show', 'was', 'reason', 'subscribed', 'HBO', 'Sunday', 'nights', '9', 'pm', 'were', 'sacred', 'hour', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'criticism', 'series', 'finale', 'drew', 'abrupt', 'end', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'episode', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'viewing', 'season', 'whole', 'contained', 'many', 'gripping', 'story', 'arcs', 'once', 'again', 'writing', 'top', 'notch', 'years', 'have', 'developed', 'liking', 'many', 'characters', 'therefore', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'show', 'conclude', 'see', 'demise', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'equate', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'farewell', 'tour', 'up', 'plot', 'riveting', 'second', 'half', 'Rubicon', 'terms', 'war', 'two', 'families', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'show', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'history', 'true', 'gem', 'bunch', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Blue', 'Comet', 'equate', 'episode', 'DEFCOM', '1', 'absolute', 'state', 'emergency', 'ensues', 'Soprano', 'crime', 'family', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'much', 'episode', 'due', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'series', 'DVD', 'simply', 'lot', 'replay', 'value', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'countless', 'times', 'comparison', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'DVD', 'library', 'have', 'found', 're-watching', 'season', 'DVD', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'when', 'aired', 'spring', '2007', 'due', 'fact', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'elements', 'overlooked', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'said', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'season', 'chances', 'are', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'show', 'probably', 'own', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'will', 'buy', 'one', 'anyway', 'Owning', 'show', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'abridged', 'edition', 'A', 'E', 'Watching', 'syndicated', 'version', 'as', 'satisfying', 'drinking', 'can', 'Natty', 'Light', 'fine', 'meal', 'sounding', 'hired', 'gun', 'HBO', 'only', 'other', 'shows', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'great', 'writing', 'show', 'are', 'Wire', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Shield', 'FX', 'also', 'recommend', 'three', 'shows', 'Wire', 'certainly', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'even', 'best', 'Sopranos', 'ways', 'Even', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Wire', 'enjoy', 'character', 'development', 'Sopranos', 'more', 'so', 'essential', 'view', 'season', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'end', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'hate.Season', '6', 'Part', '2', 'Grade', '92', '%', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'B', '82', '%', 'main', 'menu', 'slick', 'interface']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"
1054864,A2OTZHOJJM4ZKR,B000NA1VI2,A. Wellman,"[20, 27]","After the final episode aired earlier this summer, HBO hinted that a massive Sopranos complete series boxed set would be released in time for Christmas of 2008--which might possibly actually contain a bit more bonus material than previous sets have included.  However, having shelled out roughly $500 for the previous six packages, I am indifferent to any such ""ultimate"" edition.  I was only interested in picking up these final nine episodes, and assumed that this set would be smaller (and less expensive) than previous sets.Wrong!  Why will this set cost the same as the previous sets, all of which (except for Season 6 Part 1) contained 13 episodes--thus running four hours longer than this set?  There's no mention of any bonus material on this set...As for these final nine episodes...I don't want to get in a debate over the final five or ten minutes of the last episode, as I didn't really have a problem with the ending itself--I had a problem with the fact that in its overall execution, David Chase seemed to be deliberately thumbing his nose at the audience.  That aspect of the ending annoyed me; that I take personally.  The first five seasons had been so brilliantly conceived and intricately plotted, that I was frankly expecting something a lot more ingenious.  But looking back now at the final 21 episodes of season six, it all seems to be a meandering mishmash of red herrings and loose ends.  In particular, the ""Chasing It"" episode stands as one of the worst in the entire series:  for Tony to suddenly morph into a compulsive (or, as he always called them, ""degenerate"") gambler, 81 episodes into the show, simply didn't ring true.  I overlooked a lot of things like that in these final twenty-one episodes, assuming that it was ultimately all going somewhere, but now...the $100 suggested retail price on this comparatively abbreviated set seems only to indicate that these final shows were little more than a final paycheck for everybody involved.",3,Why four discs for only nine episodes?,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1973,"['final', 'episode', 'aired', 'earlier', 'summer', 'HBO', 'hinted', 'massive', 'Sopranos', 'complete', 'series', 'boxed', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'time', 'Christmas', '2008', 'might', 'possibly', 'actually', 'contain', 'bit', 'more', 'material', 'previous', 'sets', 'have', 'included', 'However', 'having', 'shelled', 'out', 'roughly', '500', 'previous', 'six', 'packages', 'am', 'indifferent', 'such', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'was', 'only', 'interested', 'picking', 'up', 'final', 'nine', 'episodes', 'assumed', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'smaller', 'less', 'expensive', 'previous', 'sets.Wrong', 'Why', 'will', 'set', 'cost', 'same', 'previous', 'sets', 'Season', '6', 'Part', '1', 'contained', '13', 'episodes', 'thus', 'running', 'four', 'hours', 'longer', 'set', 'mention', 'bonus', 'material', 'set', 'final', 'nine', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'debate', 'final', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'ending', 'had', 'problem', 'fact', 'overall', 'execution', 'David', 'Chase', 'seemed', 'be', 'deliberately', 'thumbing', 'nose', 'audience', 'aspect', 'ending', 'take', 'personally', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'was', 'frankly', 'expecting', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'ingenious', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'final', '21', 'episodes', 'season', 'six', 'be', 'meandering', 'mishmash', 'red', 'herrings', 'loose', 'ends', 'particular', 'Chasing', 'episode', 'one', 'worst', 'entire', 'series', 'Tony', 'suddenly', 'morph', 'compulsive', 'always', 'called', 'degenerate', 'gambler', '81', 'episodes', 'show', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'overlooked', 'lot', 'things', 'final', 'twenty-one', 'episodes', 'assuming', 'was', 'ultimately', 'going', 'somewhere', 'now', '100', 'suggested', 'retail', 'price', 'comparatively', 'abbreviated', 'set', 'only', 'indicate', 'final', 'shows', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'final', 'paycheck', 'everybody', 'involved']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"

Callaway ""BAC""","[17, 30]","The Sopranos for the current era, rivaled the Dallas series of the late 70's early 80's, during its time people tuned in weekly to see what J.R. would do next, or see how the sideline stories and plots played out, usually with a season ending teaser, so you would be on edge until next season, Who can forget ""Who Shot J.R."" season ending. The Sopranos brought back that type of weekly fan following and anticipation, with people tuning in on Sunday to see what Tony would do next, and how the various side plots would play out. The series was great and will go down as one well remembered for years, and no doubt there will be some attempt to make a follow up Box office or made for HBO movie down the line.The negitive side of this series is how HBO has exploited the fans of this show with the huge price tag attached to the season box sets.A true must have fan of the show will pay $140-$200 for one whole season broken up into 2 sets what a rip-off.Most other season based shows put out by Fox or other producers come out at $30-40, but HBO prices all of its series twice as much. The true fan that can wait a little to add this season to their collection would help their pocket out by waiting a few months and picking the season up from a good after seller for probably half the price.Right now you can find any previous released season for prices from $18-35, so the fan that has waited can get a good deal.HBO should stop exploiting their fan base so much, and be more reasonable with their prices.",3,"Great Series, But a huge HBO Rip-Off !!!",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1507,"['Sopranos', 'current', 'era', 'rivaled', 'Dallas', 'series', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'time', 'people', 'tuned', 'weekly', 'see', 'what', 'J.R.', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'see', 'how', 'sideline', 'stories', 'plots', 'played', 'out', 'usually', 'season', 'ending', 'teaser', 'would', 'be', 'edge', 'next', 'season', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Who', 'Shot', 'J.R.', 'season', 'ending', 'Sopranos', 'brought', 'back', 'type', 'weekly', 'fan', 'following', 'anticipation', 'people', 'tuning', 'Sunday', 'see', 'what', 'Tony', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'how', 'various', 'side', 'plots', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'well', 'remembered', 'years', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'attempt', 'make', 'follow', 'up', 'Box', 'office', 'made', 'HBO', 'movie', 'down', 'line.The', 'negitive', 'side', 'series', 'how', 'HBO', 'exploited', 'fans', 'show', 'huge', 'price', 'tag', 'attached', 'season', 'box', 'sets.A', 'true', 'must', 'have', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'pay', '140-', '200', 'one', 'whole', 'season', 'broken', 'up', '2', 'sets', 'what', 'rip-off.Most', 'other', 'season', 'based', 'shows', 'put', 'out', 'Fox', 'other', 'producers', 'come', 'out', '30-40', 'HBO', 'prices', 'series', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'true', 'fan', 'can', 'wait', 'little', 'add', 'season', 'collection', 'would', 'help', 'pocket', 'waiting', 'few', 'months', 'picking', 'season', 'up', 'good', 'seller', 'probably', 'price.Right', 'now', 'can', 'find', 'previous', 'released', 'season', 'prices', '18-35', 'fan', 'waited', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'deal.HBO', 'should', 'stop', 'exploiting', 'fan', 'base', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'more', 'reasonable', 'prices']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"

It has never been over done, it has always occurred but then things calmed down again.  In season six part two, the violence finally explodes.  The brakes come off.  The very worst of each character, their essence, is portrayed.  This is not as subtly as previous seasons, but it works.It is a closing season,and it offers closure.  Paulie is a nostalgic motor mouth loner.  Bobby is a nice guy who finally kills, and by return karma, gets killed.  We are left in no doubt that Tony Sr is a selfish and nasty piece of work, who's ""bonhomie"" manner is no cover for his violent inner self.  Tony Jr is his father's son in that he gets depression and thinks deeply, but pampered by his family's wealth, lacks his father's steely inner core.Season three was the most enjoyable, but this runs it a close second.  The ending is fine...we have been shown a window into The Sopranos' world, and now it has closed.The one quirk which has been noted by another reviewer is the odd storyline of Tony borrowing money off Hesh.  It is only 200k, the sort of amount one has seen him stash in a flower pot at home before.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[16, 17]","If you manage to still be one of those people complaining about the ending of ""Made In America,"" the final hour of The Sopranos, may I congratulate you - you've managed to prove something that many of us who love the episode know to be true: you simply cannot get the thing out of your head.  I spent days after it aired thinking the initial cut to black did not mean what my gut reaction felt - that Tony and his family were gunned down and David Chase simply opted not to show it, and that instead it proved that in this existence, the anxiety is more ""real"" than life or death.  I think that is true, but I also think I was reluctant to admit the intention of that scene, based on the rich creation of those characters - not knowing that The Sopranos are dead spares us the reality that The Sopranos are dead; my analysis was a little self-protective.  It is, however, the anxiety that seals it, in a (half) season full of one shock after another, the grim truth that, as Tony states in ""Soprano Home Movies"" - ""80% of the time, this thing ends in the can like Johnny Sack, or on the embalming table,"" and Tony, probably, faces both.  This is the season that redefines fearlessness, setting off one bomb after another - exploding the ferocity barely masked in Christopher's addiction (""Walk Like A Man,"" which should've given Michael Imperioli a victory lap Emmy) only to shock us with his first-act death an episode later (""Kennedy and Heidi"").  Having Janice state that she will never become her mother (""Soprano Home Movies"") while her destiny seems to be exactly the opposite (Junior mistakes her for Livia in their final moments together).  The season is so extraordinary, it shows us the last moments of Junior's sanity in ""Remember When,"" but does so with so little fanfare, we don't realize just what we saw until the very end.  It turns Chrisopher's death in ""Kennedy and Heidi"" into an uncomfortable rumination on those of us that remain alive.  It shocks us with Tony's humanity (his suited dive into the pool to save AJ in ""The Second Coming"") while fulfilling his vileness (the moment we're certain he'll kill Paulie in ""Remember When"").  So much can be said about each astonishing installment here - and its final second ensures that most things will get said - that it bares stating the simplest of facts: this is the most visionary work ever created on television, and no amounts of repeated viewings can do it justice.",5,"""Look at us, morbid f----s"" (Careful, Spoilers)",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2438,"['manage', 'still', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'complaining', 'ending', 'Made', 'America', 'final', 'hour', 'Sopranos', 'may', 'congratulate', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'prove', 'something', 'many', 'who', 'love', 'episode', 'know', 'be', 'true', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'thing', 'head', 'spent', 'days', 'aired', 'thinking', 'initial', 'cut', 'black', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'what', 'gut', 'reaction', 'felt', 'Tony', 'family', 'were', 'gunned', 'down', 'David', 'Chase', 'simply', 'opted', 'not', 'show', 'instead', 'proved', 'existence', 'anxiety', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'death', 'think', 'true', 'also', 'think', 'was', 'reluctant', 'admit', 'intention', 'scene', 'based', 'rich', 'creation', 'characters', 'not', 'knowing', 'Sopranos', 'are', 'dead', 'spares', 'reality', 'Sopranos', 'are', 'dead', 'analysis', 'was', 'little', 'self-protective', 'however', 'anxiety', 'half', 'season', 'full', 'one', 'shock', 'grim', 'truth', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Home', 'Movies', '80', '%', 'time', 'thing', 'can', 'like', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'embalming', 'table', 'Tony', 'probably', 'season', 'fearlessness', 'setting', 'off', 'one', 'bomb', 'exploding', 'ferocity', 'barely', 'masked', 'Christopher', 'addiction', 'Walk', 'A', 'Man', 'should', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'victory', 'lap', 'Emmy', 'only', 'shock', 'first-act', 'death', 'episode', 'later', 'Kennedy', 'Heidi', 'Having', 'Janice', 'state', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'mother', 'Soprano', 'Home', 'Movies', 'destiny', 'be', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'Junior', 'Livia', 'final', 'moments', 'together', 'season', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'last', 'moments', 'Junior', 'sanity', 'Remember', 'When', 'so', 'so', 'little', 'fanfare', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'what', 'saw', 'very', 'end', 'Chrisopher', 'death', 'Kennedy', 'Heidi', 'uncomfortable', 'rumination', 'remain', 'alive', 'Tony', 'humanity', 'suited', 'dive', 'pool', 'save', 'AJ', 'Second', 'Coming', 'fulfilling', 'vileness', 'moment', ""'re"", 'certain', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Paulie', 'Remember', 'When', 'So', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'astonishing', 'installment', 'here', 'final', 'second', 'most', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'said', 'stating', 'simplest', 'facts', 'most', 'visionary', 'work', 'ever', 'created', 'television', 'amounts', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'can', 'do', 'justice']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"

Actually, there were many incredible moments, as everybody who loves the show knows, but there was something particularly touching and ""right"" about these last ones.  How fun was Melfi's coming to terms with the fact that Tony's therapy is a bunch of b.s. and her dinner with her envious colleagues, including her sly therapist, played wonderfully by Peter Bogdanovich? As for the ending itself: it's impossible to kill someone you love (yes, even Christopher knew that).

After a night of hallucinations and highly successful gambling (this on the heels of Tony losing pretty consistently and showing symptoms of a gambling addiction), they stumble out into the desert and watch the sun rise.Seeing the sun come up, in a montage of garish color against the desert rock formations, a disheveled Tony screams that message to God and the universe.  ""I get it.""  Now, if only that meant Tony had found something approaching peace.In this season, Tony curses the people he loves and even his own gene pool.  He is enormously self-absorbed and hugely narcissistic, and more brutish than ever.  He shows great empathy and horrible sociopathic fixation, sometimes in the same scene.  When met with the expressed needs of people closest to him, a stock response is, ""oh, poor you.""  Respect, whether earned or not, becomes the only thing that matters.And people die.The violence and loss is met with the classic urban phrase, ""What are you gonna do?""

The last nine episodes of the Sopranos are monuments to the superlative abilities of everyone involved in this groundbreaking series.  The writing and acting have never been better.  When Robert Iler as AJ finally puts together a good performance, you know the series is running at a high pace.For myself, the Sopranos has always been about moments that you're thinking about long after the episode ends.  I've never gotten chills watching the Sopranos until the final episodes, and this season was full of chill-inducing moments.  Carm asking ""Is this it?"" in the opening scene.  Paulie's Big Pussy dream.  The huge fight Tony and Carm have over her housing profits.  Chris stumbling into his house and then his heartbreaking confession in ""Kennedy and Heidi.""  Tony and the Nevada desert.  Tony saving AJ from himself.  Bobby talking about his son while buying a toy train.  Too many heartfelt looks and hilarious lines to remember.And of course, the final episode.  To those that always complain about the open-endedness with which the Sopranos is written, the final episode did a lot of bow-tying.  Every character was shown, and given some closure.  As for the final scene, who knows what happened?  Tony existed in the story before we started watching and he and his family will exist after the series ends.  Maybe Tony died in that diner.  Maybe his whole family died with him.  Maybe Tony died twenty years later of a heart attack after eating too many greasy onion rings.  That pop culture moment attained its immortality by allowing every viewer to have their own ideas.  I'd imagine the Sopranos fans that hated it were hoping the Members Only Jacket man was paid to kill Tony by the vengeful triumvarate of Furio, Ade, and the Russian, but that's just absurd.  The final season is about so much more than the last minutes anyways, so enjoy it for the other 8 hours and fifty-five minutes.Lastly, I've got to mention the music.  Bobby hugging his daughter at the end of the first episode to ""This Magic Moment.""  ""Evidently Chickentown"" playing over the baptism of Chris's daughter.  ""The Valley"" by Los Lobos playing at the end of the fifth episode.  Journey having the honor of backing the final scene.  All perfect mood-setting choices by writers at the top of their game.

1054898,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000NA1VI2,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[0, 0]","The end of the line came for ""The Sopranos"" last year when the critically acclaimed mob drama ended its eight year run. This was one of the best dramatic shows of all-time, and season 6, part 2 for the most part was excellent. It was an improvement over season 6, part 1, though just a tad below the first five seasons. It was a wise decision to end the show where it did. It might have gotten too tiresome if it had ran longer. Tony Soprano and gang returned for nine final episodes, and they didn't disappoint. The tension level rose with each episode as we wondered which characters would get whacked (some of the shows' major supporting characters did), and as the show was coming closer to the end we wondered what fate had in store for our favorite TV mobster. And yes, this show does have without question the most bizarre ending for a television series. I need not say anymore about the ending; just about everybody who's ever watched an episode of ""The Sopranos"" knows how it ended. Nevertheless, there was rarely a dull moment in any of the episodes in season 6, part 2; just another collection of great acting, writing, and directing. And it went out with a bang at the Emmys, receiving 15 nominations and winning for the second time as Best Drama Series (beating out fan favorite ""Grey's Anatomy"" and my current favorite drama series ""House""). It also won its sixth Emmy for Best Writing (David Chase for the final episode ""Made in America""), and (finally) winning its first Emmy for Best Directing (Alan Taylor for the sixth episode ""Kennedy and Heidi""). The total Emmy tally for ""The Sopranos"": 111 nominations and 21 wins.The few quibbles I had with season 6, part 2: one problem was the absence of a few great supporting characters who were seen very little throughout the season, such as Uncle Junior (who got less and less screen time the past few seasons because of his trip into dementia) and sister Janice (who appeared often in the first episode, then is rarely seen until the last few episodes). Another complaint that I had was a moment that has to be seen to be disbelieved. Now throughout the show's run there were plenty of disgusting moments, and I'm not necessarily talking about the graphic violence. This show featured plenty of drug usage, vomiting, and characters breaking wind (the latter was always good for laughs). But the show went just too far in the disgusting department in episode 4 (titled ""Chasing It""). There's a scene where you see a bunch of teenage boys taking a shower in the boys locker room at their school (there's no nudity in the scene). Then the troubled son of the late mobster Vito (the one who turned out to be gay in season 6, part 1) steps into the shower, and has a bowel movement. And the camera actually pans down to show the mess he made. Was this really necessary?Even though I gave ""The Sopranos - Season 6, Part 2"" five stars, I really give it 4  stars. Amazon's rating system won't allow  star reviews, so I ended up giving it 5 stars. If it did, I would give it 4  stars, because that's how I felt about this particular season. (I did this exact same thing in my review of ""The Golden Girls - The Complete Fifth Season"".) It was definitely better than the four star season 6, part 1; but a notch below the five star seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Still, lots to like here in season 6, part 2. It shouldn't be missed.Let me take a moment here to run down the list of people who made this show work during the eight years it was on. ""The Sopranos"" would not have been the great show it was if it weren't for the following individuals: James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco, Michael Imperioli, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Robert Iler, Dominic Chianese, Tony Sirico, Steven Van Zandt, Aida Turturro, Drea de Matteo, Steven Schirripa, John Ventimiglia, Sharon Angela, Vincent Curatola, Frank Vincent, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, Jerry Adler, Vincent Pastore, Federico Castelluccio, David Proval, Dan Grimaldi, Max Casella, Katherine Narducci, Tom Aldredge, Suzanne Shepherd, Peter Bogdanovich, Jason Cerbone, Joseph Gannascoli, Matt Servitto, Toni Kalem, Al Sapienza, and the late Nancy Marchand. Whether their roles were big or small, they all did a spectacular job. Nobody else could have played Tony Soprano as good as Gandolfini did. Same goes for Falco as Carmela; Imperioli as Christopher; Bracco as Dr. Melfi; etc. Much of the credit for this show being so good should go to creator David Chase. He made one hell of a show.

As with all fictional works devoted to organized crime, the most engaging aspect for me is The Business and the attendant adherence to The Code. That goes for these last episodes of the run. I frankly could never get interested in Tony's own immediate family, as opposed to his Familly -- Meadow seemed just a typical rebellious yet ultimately devoted daughter transposed to the  realm of the Mob, while A.J. was an annoying little lump. Carmela was a bit more intriguing as the wife quietly humiliated by Tony's philandering but ultimately staying for the perks that are too much to resist. The final season frittered much of its time away by concentrating on Anthony Jr.'s search for love and meaning in his life, and in a way the Business aspect was treated in a more perfunctory manner, almost as if to take care of loose ends and little more. As for the overly praised finale, no me it's nothing but an unimaginative cop-out, a tacit admission by David Chase that he couldn't pull any real closure out of his nether regions.

It's Season 6- the remaining 9 eps of The final 21. As we reach this TV milestone let's review what we've learned from the Sopranos:  the Family comes first, never break a soldier's oath, beware of Cousins from Italy, a little therapy never hurts (just don't deface your therapist's magazines), the Don't-ask-Don't tell policy works best for mob wives and goomars, you don't have to eat every dish of Rigatoni, e.g. don't sleep with the Boss' ex-mistress, 'Made men' shouldn't play competitive Monopoly and absolutely do not be a Rat!An amazing final season for one of TV's all-time finest! The Saga of Jersey crime fam comes to a close as  Anthony Jr. loses his lady and goes to a dark place as a result. Chris continues his Hollywood pursuits as Cleaver is final released ...&#34;F' Ben Kingsley. Danny Baldwin took 'em to F'n actin'school.&#34;Uncle Junior has been committed, begins running a game there and has other troubles fitting in at 'the home.' Phil Leotardo, now running Brooklyn in Johnny's stead, continues to break balls & press Tony's buttons but still has time to talk to Vito Junior leading to Tony doing some counseling of his own. Tony must deal with his lack of remorse over his part in the death of another friend. All this and the Feds are hot to nail Tony's gang, but not as hot as the Brooklyn gang. It's all come down to this, measures are taken... mistakes are made... a blood bath ensues.. Seriously.There are no weak stories this season. Mid-season opener &#34;Soprano Home Movies&#34; was excellent.  &#34;Stage 5&#34; is  Johnny Sack heavy but good, This season Anthony Jr Blanca/collage/therapy arc is over heavy but it's mercifully Meadow light (and then she's only cheering A.J. up, but at least it's not moaning about Finn). &#34;Remember When&#34; are &#34;Walk like a man&#34; are solid. &#34;Kennedy & Heidi&#34; is a terrific ep when the asbestos hits the fan and Tony goes on a Vegas vision quest. In &#34;Second Coming&#34; there's more than one scene that will make even tough guys cringe, but the Sopranos never shies from showing the violence. &#34;Blue Comet&#34; has some of the most stylistic executions of the entire series.  In spite of all internet debate on the subject &#34;Made in America&#34; is an ok closer for the series run.The throwaway line at the Cleaver Film premiere: &#34;The Sacred & the Propane&#34; ... Exemplifies the series itself high crime drama opposite the darkly funny.

The best of the lot is on Episode 8, ""The Blue Comet,"" featuring Little Steven and Arthur J. Nascarella. Little Steven makes an observation about the AJ character that is so apt, so hilarious, so spot-on accurate that I won't spoil it here. Both actors seem to have the most fun of all with their commentary.One of the gems from the commentary is the revelation of David Chase's intention with the series: He did not want to portray mob life as glamorous, and he did not want to portray it as NOT glamorous. I think he found his balance.Take the AJ character, for example. Could anyone who's watched the show for 7 seasons really expect redemption? In his final scenes, tooling around with his model girlfriend in his brand-new Beemer and laughing like an idiot on the sofa, stuffing his face with chips and enjoying the antics of ""MC Karl Rove"" on the TV...anyone surprised? Did you really think that he'd enlist and go to the front lines in Afghanistan or Iraq, or that he'd become The Donald's helicopter pilot? The genius of Chase is found in the fact that AJ is a bum, no doubt...but we see Tony and Carmela as his chief enablers. There's a point in everyone's life where the parents turn their kids loose in the world. AJ's 20 and they have no intention of letting him go. Listen to the Little Steven remark. He sums up AJ in 25 words or less.What about Christopher? Somewhere around the first or second season, TV Guide featured an interview with ""real-life Jersey Wise Guys""...actual mob figures who rated the show's cast for accuracy. One of them called Christopher ""one for the trunk""...meaning that if it were real ife instead of TV, he would have easily been whacked within the first few episodes. In this instance, Tony received closure...he expressed his gratitude for the way he was portrayed in Christopher's movie, ""Cleaver.""Janice takes one last sniff around Uncle Junior to see if she can locate his ""hidden money,"" but it is to no avail. Carmela still longingly looks at architect drawings and floor plans, but she's still not the real estate diva she's dreamed of becoming. Phil Leotardo's feeling a little run down (literally), Paulie's going through the ""every time I think I'm out they pull me back IN"" angst, and Tony claims he can no longer eat eggplant.It all comes down to onion rings and Journey on the jukebox.

David Chase didn't give viewers that closure that they wanted, but life doesn't come with a nice bow at the end of the day, and the series kept it real.  It also had alot of the comedy that season 1 had.The end of the series finale when Tony first walks into the restaurant then sees himself sitting down, is it a dream?  Are some of the people in the restaurant notorious or related characters from ealier episodes and seasons?  Earlier in the Sopranos there was talk of how a killing happens, you don't hear it, you don't see it, just bang and the lights go out, like how the last moments ended, did Tony Die?  Who knows, but people on every talk show, on every sports show on espn, on blogs, everywhere are discussing it, analyzing it, and debating it, isn't that what great movies do for us?  If mobsters walked in and shot tony and there was a huge shoot out, what is there to comment on, ""whoa did you see him get shot""?, damn.  The end.  David Chase is smarter, and as i said the end was so suspenseful it was Hitchcockian.  Hitchcock once said it's not the explosion of the bomb that goes off.  That'll make you jump for one second, it's the knowing a bomb is under the table and it could go off, the waiting, and anticipation and it doesn't that was the last 5 minutes and i'd think everyone would agree even the dissapointed people that it was very intense.  Great movies make us feel something whether it is good or bad, a great movie can change us or our mood.I've loved watching the Sopranos over the years it's more than just a violent show, it's almost always fresh and current and dealing with alot of the same issues we all deal with in our lives.

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[2, 2]","I don't quite understand the Season 6 Part I and Part II breaks as opposed to breaking them into seasons proper, but whatever.  I'm sure on paper it makes sense to the writers.This is the swan song for the famed HBO show about the New Jersey branch of the Mafia and it's beefy leader Anthony 'Tony' Soprano.  A recognizable figure to many today, this season takes pains to show the darkness, the pain and the evil of the man and his world.  This is probably the darkest season of a very dark show.In fact, the season left me in a funk after nearly every episode in Spring of 2007.  Each of the eight final episodes explores Tony's relationship with both the major and supporting characters.  Something bad happens to nearly all of them as they're touched by Tony and his way of life.  Whether it's another confrontation with his appalling sister Janice and her husband, teddybear capo Bobby, which results in Bacala's full initiation into Tony's world, to the gambling insanity and it's strain on T's relationship with Hesh...it's all headed downhill for the big man.  Even the character of AJ, one of the more useless and unlikable during the course of the show (this in a cast of psychos and thieves) gets a fuller exploration as he heads into his own dark place.  Paulie, Christopher, Sil, Carmela...nobody is spared the black cloud that has followed Tony through five and a half seasons.  The Sopranos, a show about a mobster battling depression, became as much about depression as it did about gangsterism, gobbagool, and those amazing shirts Tony's been wearing for years.As for the now-famous ending and the 'did Tony die or not' question...judge for yourself.  And whether he died or not, the final portion of the sixth season makes clear that things are not going to end well.Excellent box set, though still pricey.  Only eight episodes, but a lot packed into each one.  The usual extras, including commentaries, but the real draw is the show itself.  Looks fantastic, too, as the production really began to benefit from HD with it's careful and moody lighting.Easily one of the most worthwhile seasons to own.  Only thing missing was a limited edition print of one Tony's amazing shirts.",5,Dark show ends on...dark and depressing and excellent notes...,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,2197,"['do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'Season', '6', 'Part', 'Part', 'II', 'as', 'opposed', 'breaking', 'seasons', 'proper', ""'m"", 'sure', 'paper', 'sense', 'writers.This', 'swan', 'song', 'famed', 'HBO', 'show', 'New', 'Jersey', 'branch', 'Mafia', 'beefy', 'leader', 'Anthony', ""'Tony"", 'Soprano', 'A', 'recognizable', 'figure', 'many', 'today', 'season', 'pains', 'show', 'darkness', 'pain', 'evil', 'man', 'world', 'probably', 'darkest', 'season', 'very', 'dark', 'show.In', 'fact', 'season', 'left', 'funk', 'nearly', 'episode', 'Spring', '2007', 'eight', 'final', 'episodes', 'Tony', 'relationship', 'major', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Something', 'bad', 'happens', 'nearly', ""'re"", 'touched', 'Tony', 'way', 'life', 'confrontation', 'appalling', 'sister', 'Janice', 'husband', 'teddybear', 'capo', 'Bobby', 'results', 'Bacala', 'full', 'initiation', 'Tony', 'world', 'gambling', 'insanity', 'strain', 'T', 'relationship', 'Hesh', 'headed', 'downhill', 'big', 'man', 'Even', 'character', 'AJ', 'one', 'more', 'useless', 'unlikable', 'course', 'show', 'cast', 'psychos', 'thieves', 'fuller', 'exploration', 'own', 'dark', 'place', 'Paulie', 'Christopher', 'Sil', 'Carmela', 'nobody', 'spared', 'black', 'cloud', 'followed', 'Tony', 'five', 'half', 'seasons', 'Sopranos', 'show', 'mobster', 'battling', 'depression', 'became', 'much', 'depression', 'did', 'about', 'gangsterism', 'gobbagool', 'amazing', 'shirts', 'Tony', 'been', 'wearing', 'years.As', 'now-famous', 'ending', ""'did"", 'Tony', 'die', 'not', 'question', 'judge', 'yourself', 'died', 'not', 'final', 'portion', 'sixth', 'season', 'clear', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'well.Excellent', 'box', 'set', 'still', 'pricey', 'Only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'lot', 'packed', 'one', 'usual', 'extras', 'including', 'commentaries', 'real', 'draw', 'show', 'Looks', 'fantastic', 'too', 'production', 'really', 'began', 'benefit', 'HD', 'careful', 'moody', 'lighting.Easily', 'one', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'seasons', 'own', 'Only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'limited', 'edition', 'print', 'one', 'Tony', 'amazing', 'shirts']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"

1054918,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000NA1VI2,Phil S.,"[1, 1]","The first TV series since Seinfeld and Married With Children that I waited for. Checked the schedule. And waited for. Didn't see it originally on HBO, so I waited for my local cable to schedule it. Watched every episode until about the last 9 and then...bada bing....nothing. I chased it around the remote [formerly known as the ""dial""] for weeks. Ok. Ok.Not in the least bit disappointed. I think those final shows were among the best.I think of The Sopranos as a combination Soap Opera/Crime Series. To my knowledge, that was never even done in the movies.I'va had reservations about what I surmise [based upon 621 viewings of ""Goodfellas""] to be flaws in writing and concept: (1) Why would a ""Boss"" (a 5 o'clock News celebrity) drive up in his own car, looking exactly like himself, using his real name, to a Pschologist's office where he's expected to pour his guts out? (2) Why would he openly display the discord in his own home, to his ""Crew""? Why would he even *think* Divorce in his world? (3) Why would his Daughter be allowed to roam unprotected through a rough section of town in her Social Worker Intern role? (4) How would ""Cleaver"" have even gotten past the conference stage? Also, I don't understand all the footage inside toilets; other bits of business which make the viewer want to look away.Not all of the above criticisms are really reflected in the final nine, though.The DVD quality is awesome. And if I say it's awesome, considering my ancient entertainment system, it's gotta be. The viewer obviously has the chance with this boxed-set to watch the show muninterrupted by the commercials (more violent than the show), and so it takes on a more *movie* feel.Each Disc has one running commentary, with a total of five voices. The voice of ""Uncle Junior"" is the most impressive. A very insightful, and moving dialogue. He's not particulary emotive, but his calm and cool technique only enhances the detail.I was disappointed that Lorraine Bracco did not have a Commentary. (Gotta check the other packages). ""Dr. Melfi"", like ""Junior"", is a very soft-spoken character, an interesting counterpoint to the often explosive behavior of the other principals.I'm not comfortable with how the Dr. and The Boss ended. Ultimately, she was to blame for not doing better research on a situation that could only work against her...and society. She basically slams the door on Tony...he replaces the torn out recipe page from the magazine in the waiting room...and leaves.Not to be overcritical of this amazing series, but I wish that a small romance would have developped with them. Although, on a deeper level, it was a ""telepathic"" romance. She expressed to *her* Advisor that, yes, in the beginning, she was taken by Tony's masculinity. The fan can decide if that feeling grew even sronger.Features include the above-mentioned Commentaries, plus a ""mock"" Documentary on the making of ""Cleaver"", and the making of the music soundtrack to the show (David Gray's comments about the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Costello are brilliant and can make their fans swell with pride).",5,59 bux well spent,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,3093,"['first', 'TV', 'series', 'Seinfeld', 'Married', 'Children', 'waited', 'Checked', 'schedule', 'waited', 'Did', ""n't"", 'see', 'originally', 'HBO', 'waited', 'local', 'cable', 'schedule', 'Watched', 'episode', 'last', '9', 'then', 'bada', 'bing', '.nothing', 'chased', 'remote', '[', 'formerly', 'known', 'dial', ']', 'weeks', 'Ok.', 'Ok.Not', 'least', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'think', 'final', 'shows', 'were', 'best.I', 'think', 'Sopranos', 'combination', 'Soap', 'Opera/Crime', 'Series', 'knowledge', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'done', ""movies.I'va"", 'had', 'reservations', 'what', 'surmise', '[', 'based', '621', 'viewings', 'Goodfellas', ']', 'be', 'flaws', 'writing', 'concept', '1', 'Why', 'would', 'Boss', '5', ""o'clock"", 'News', 'celebrity', 'drive', 'up', 'own', 'car', 'looking', 'exactly', 'using', 'real', 'name', 'Pschologist', 'office', 'where', 'expected', 'pour', 'guts', 'out', '2', 'Why', 'would', 'openly', 'display', 'discord', 'own', 'home', 'Crew', 'Why', 'would', 'even', '*think*', 'Divorce', 'world', '3', 'Why', 'would', 'Daughter', 'be', 'allowed', 'roam', 'unprotected', 'rough', 'section', 'town', 'Social', 'Worker', 'Intern', 'role', '4', 'How', 'would', 'Cleaver', 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'conference', 'stage', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'footage', 'inside', 'toilets', 'other', 'bits', 'business', 'make', 'viewer', 'want', 'look', 'above', 'criticisms', 'are', 'really', 'reflected', 'final', 'nine', 'DVD', 'quality', 'awesome', 'say', 'awesome', 'considering', 'ancient', 'entertainment', 'system', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'viewer', 'obviously', 'chance', 'boxed-set', 'watch', 'show', 'muninterrupted', 'commercials', 'more', 'violent', 'show', 'so', 'more', '*movie*', 'feel.Each', 'Disc', 'one', 'running', 'commentary', 'total', 'five', 'voices', 'voice', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'most', 'impressive', 'very', 'insightful', 'moving', 'dialogue', 'not', 'particulary', 'emotive', 'calm', 'cool', 'technique', 'only', 'detail.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Commentary', 'Got', 'ta', 'check', 'other', 'packages', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'Junior', 'very', 'soft-spoken', 'character', 'interesting', 'counterpoint', 'often', 'explosive', 'behavior', 'other', 'principals.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Boss', 'ended', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'blame', 'not', 'doing', 'better', 'research', 'situation', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'society', 'basically', 'slams', 'door', 'Tony', 'torn', 'out', 'recipe', 'page', 'magazine', 'waiting', 'room', 'leaves.Not', 'be', 'overcritical', 'amazing', 'series', 'wish', 'small', 'romance', 'would', 'have', 'developped', 'deeper', 'level', 'was', 'telepathic', 'romance', 'expressed', '*her*', 'Advisor', 'yes', 'beginning', 'was', 'taken', 'Tony', 'masculinity', 'fan', 'can', 'decide', 'feeling', 'grew', 'even', 'sronger.Features', 'include', 'above-mentioned', 'Commentaries', 'mock', 'Documentary', 'making', 'Cleaver', 'making', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'show', 'David', 'Gray', 'comments', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'are', 'brilliant', 'can', 'make', 'fans', 'swell', 'pride']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"

We tuned in to see what was going to happen to Tony, Carmela, and dozens of others because we cared - often too much.  There are those still broken over Adriana's exit and scarred by Steve Buscemi's untimely end.That's good writing.So what else could Season Six, Part II offer but resolutions over its nine episodes?  There are resolutions aplenty, including Chris-ta-pha's final mano-a-mano with his drug use and Bobby Bacala's extra devotion to trains, but there are plenty of new stories to uncover.  A.J. struggles with matters of the heart and with nihilism.  Carmela still carries the demons of marrying Tony.  Dr. Melfi finally confronts the question of whether she has helped Tony heal or made him a better criminal.  And Tony must face down both Phil Leotardo and dissension among his own ranks.Some of the series' finest writing can be found in these nine episodes - including the word ""miffled"" and a death scene involving an SUV and two grandchildren in child seats that will go down as one of the great gangster death scenes ever.Much has been written about the enigmatic ending in the diner.  I have my own theories on what happens to Tony, but there are others . . . and many other folks who thought David Chase copped out.

David Chase's last season of television's finest program is full of all the qualities that attracted viewers and critics for the past decade.  Characters live in a world where death is a possibility each day, but aren't shown to be gods or royalty.  Rather, viewers see in them all of the emotions experienced in every family, as Tony, Carmela, Christopher and the rest of the cast share their memorable loves, hates, dreams, failures...and meals.Season 6.2 has three distinct parts.  The first four episodes  are ""last moments in the sun"" for some of the more important characters.  Bobby and Janice retreat for a weekend on a lake with Tony and Carm; Johnny Sack battles a new enemy in prison; institutionalized Uncle Junior spends his last moments of sanity running a card game and mentoring a young killer; and Hesh fears for his safety when Tony owes him money and seems reluctant to pay.Next, the season moves to the difficulties of AJ and Christopher and how both problems affect Tony.  Tony takes a backseat to other characters in the opening episodes of the season, but he's never been more laid bare than in how he deals with his literal and figurative sons.  As with the ambiguous nature of the show,  Tony at times appears to be a heroic, thoughtful and brave, while other times, he's a monster.Finally, the last two episodes end in the much anticipated war with New York, as successful and unsuccessful hits are targeted at the show's biggest players.  A sense of closure is reached with Tony's relationships with his rivals, his crew, his family and the FBI, but as everyone in America knows, nothing concrete is declared about his future.  Does he live?  Does he go to prison?  Will his crew survive?  Those questions aren't answered, Chase`s last gift to his viewers, as people can continue turning this show over in their heads for years.I wasn't there when The Tempest first played at the Globe, and I didn't see The Beatles at Candlestick Park.  But Sunday Nights at 9pm on HBO, I saw my generation's finest contribution to pop culture and to literature, with the final season providing a closing act worthy of such a masterpiece.",5,Brilliant End to Television's Finest Hour,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,2328,"['So', 'much', 'what', 'said', 'final', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'refers', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'people', 'unfortunately', 'overlook', 'best', 'nine', 'episode', 'string', 'entire', 'series', 'David', 'Chase', 'last', 'season', 'television', 'finest', 'program', 'full', 'qualities', 'attracted', 'viewers', 'critics', 'past', 'decade', 'Characters', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'death', 'possibility', 'day', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'be', 'gods', 'royalty', 'Rather', 'viewers', 'see', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'family', 'Tony', 'Carmela', 'Christopher', 'rest', 'cast', 'share', 'memorable', 'loves', 'hates', 'dreams', 'failures', '6.2', 'three', 'distinct', 'parts', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'last', 'moments', 'sun', 'more', 'important', 'characters', 'Bobby', 'Janice', 'retreat', 'weekend', 'lake', 'Tony', 'Carm', 'Johnny', 'Sack', 'new', 'enemy', 'prison', 'institutionalized', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'last', 'moments', 'sanity', 'running', 'card', 'game', 'mentoring', 'young', 'killer', 'Hesh', 'fears', 'safety', 'when', 'Tony', 'money', 'reluctant', 'pay.Next', 'season', 'difficulties', 'AJ', 'Christopher', 'how', 'problems', 'affect', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'backseat', 'other', 'characters', 'opening', 'episodes', 'season', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'laid', 'bare', 'how', 'literal', 'figurative', 'sons', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'show', 'Tony', 'times', 'be', 'heroic', 'thoughtful', 'brave', 'other', 'times', 'monster.Finally', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'end', 'much', 'anticipated', 'war', 'New', 'York', 'successful', 'unsuccessful', 'hits', 'are', 'targeted', 'show', 'biggest', 'players', 'sense', 'closure', 'reached', 'Tony', 'relationships', 'rivals', 'crew', 'family', 'FBI', 'everyone', 'America', 'knows', 'nothing', 'concrete', 'declared', 'future', 'live', 'Does', 'go', 'prison', 'Will', 'crew', 'survive', 'questions', 'are', ""n't"", 'answered', 'Chase', 's', 'last', 'gift', 'viewers', 'people', 'can', 'continue', 'turning', 'show', 'heads', 'years.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'when', 'Tempest', 'first', 'played', 'Globe', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Beatles', 'Candlestick', 'Park', 'Sunday', 'Nights', '9pm', 'HBO', 'saw', 'generation', 'finest', 'contribution', 'pop', 'culture', 'literature', 'final', 'season', 'providing', 'closing', 'act', 'worthy', 'such', 'masterpiece']","The Sopranos: Season 6, Part 2"
