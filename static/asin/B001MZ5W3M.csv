1218544,A3CCVD1MKDVWZ7,B001MZ5W3M,"A. Heifetz ""Arlekino1""","[8, 12]","Technically speaking, this film was well-done.  It had a certain dark atmospheric style that complemented this disturbing story.  The acting was first-rate.  I admit that I have not seen that many movies about bad cops (""Bad Lieutenant"" comes to mind), but if I was a cop then I would be upset about this one.  If our city cops are like this, the country is in serious trouble and well on its way to becoming like Mexico.  We can all admire comraderie and standing up for each other, but the police ""honor codes"" of condoning and covering up criminal behavior are bound to cause a great deal of abuse and suffering.  Essentially, they cause a police force to become no better than a mafia organization.  None of the characters in the movie were sympathetic except for Francis Jr.'s dying wife.  She was the only one who seemed to know the difference between right and wrong.  In addition, the characters were not even interesting and had no style.  (By comparison, Dirty Harry at least had a sense of humor.)  Like other reviewers, I am surprised that actors of this caliber settled for these lame roles.  The language used contained at least 50% profanity.  A strong word now and then can enhance and reinforce emotional impact in adult situations, but when used so much the language just gets plain ugly.  I suppose that the language these cops used was as ugly as their lives, the lives of corrupt, dishonest and dishonorable men.  Ray was a smart guy and a competent investigator but he came across as a conflicted and weak character throughout the entire movie, and especially at the end.  He resorted to using a weapon (a billiard ball) during a fist fight with Jimmy and then he let the mob seize Jimmy and beat him to death, without firing a single shot.  He basically just stood there and watched.  I was hoping that at the end these police officers would do the right thing - come clean and admit their mistakes, even if it cost them their jobs.  That was the only honorable way out for them.  It would make for a great story that would again teach us valuable lessons that the choice of this type of conduct always will come back to haunt in the end.  Instead, there was a silly bar fist fight, a mob lynching and essentially a coverup to insure that business went on as usual.  The police code of conduct in this movie was not to betray each other.  This effectively made them betray the rest of us, the people that they are supposed to protect and serve.  After watching this film, I resolved to watch the entire ""Dirty Harry"" series again to regain the respect for the police as a profession.",2,This film is weak...,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,2606,"['Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'was', 'well-done', 'had', 'certain', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'style', 'complemented', 'disturbing', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'first-rate', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'bad', 'cops', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'mind', 'was', 'cop', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'one', 'city', 'cops', 'are', 'country', 'serious', 'trouble', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'Mexico', 'can', 'admire', 'comraderie', 'standing', 'up', 'other', 'police', 'honor', 'codes', 'condoning', 'covering', 'up', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'are', 'bound', 'cause', 'great', 'deal', 'abuse', 'suffering', 'Essentially', 'cause', 'police', 'force', 'become', 'better', 'mafia', 'organization', 'None', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'Francis', 'Jr.', 'dying', 'wife', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'know', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'addition', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'interesting', 'had', 'style', 'comparison', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'least', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'surprised', 'actors', 'caliber', 'settled', 'lame', 'roles', 'language', 'used', 'contained', 'least', '50', '%', 'profanity', 'strong', 'word', 'now', 'then', 'can', 'enhance', 'reinforce', 'emotional', 'impact', 'adult', 'situations', 'when', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'language', 'just', 'plain', 'ugly', 'suppose', 'language', 'cops', 'used', 'was', 'as', 'ugly', 'lives', 'lives', 'corrupt', 'dishonest', 'dishonorable', 'men', 'Ray', 'was', 'smart', 'guy', 'competent', 'investigator', 'came', 'across', 'conflicted', 'weak', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'especially', 'end', 'resorted', 'using', 'weapon', 'billiard', 'ball', 'fist', 'fight', 'Jimmy', 'then', 'let', 'mob', 'seize', 'Jimmy', 'beat', 'death', 'firing', 'single', 'shot', 'basically', 'just', 'stood', 'there', 'watched', 'was', 'hoping', 'end', 'police', 'officers', 'would', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'come', 'clean', 'admit', 'mistakes', 'even', 'cost', 'jobs', 'was', 'only', 'honorable', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'story', 'would', 'again', 'teach', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'choice', 'type', 'conduct', 'always', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'end', 'Instead', 'was', 'silly', 'bar', 'fist', 'fight', 'mob', 'lynching', 'essentially', 'coverup', 'insure', 'business', 'went', 'usual', 'police', 'code', 'conduct', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'betray', 'other', 'effectively', 'made', 'betray', 'rest', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'protect', 'serve', 'watching', 'film', 'resolved', 'watch', 'entire', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'series', 'again', 'regain', 'respect', 'police', 'profession']",N/A

1218546,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001MZ5W3M,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Pride and Glory / B001MZ5W3M*Spoilers*""Pride and Glory"" is a perfect example of the fact that great actors simply cannot make a good movie in the face of a terrible script. All the actors involved are wonderful actors in general and struggle to perform well here in spite of everything else, but the end result just falls completely flat. Fundamentally, the script is so generic and bland as to feel like it was written by a committee, in some kind of experiment to see how many 'crooked cop' movies and TV shows of the last decade they could rip off.Norton plays, of course, the burned-out, long-suffering, ""honest"" cop who, if he hasn't always been honest in the past, at least *regrets* his dishonesty, if only because lying under oath causes tension in his marriage. There's also a rather silly side plot about Norton being some kind of super-cop, which basically boils down to him being the only cop in the entire district who has a high-school level understanding of Spanish. This is an admittedly pretty useful skill to have in a district populated by a majority of Spanish-speaking residents, and I guess it *would* set you apart if you were the only cop willing to learn the language (the rest of the cops are all so stereotypically Irish Catholic that they can't be asked, apparently - and, yes, that is offensive) but the whole conceit feels so terribly out of date in a modern movie - knowing Spanish shouldn't be a novel super power anymore. But I digress.Farrell plays, again of course, the angry, young, hot-tempered crooked cop - anxious to turn every situation to his financial advantage and eager to break teeth in the pursuit of power. We know Farrell is evil, you see, because he murders, beats, and (threatens to) rape his way across town to get what he wants. He threatens to burn small babies with very hot irons, but we also know he's good because after he gets the information he wants, he cuddles the aforementioned baby and shushes it (don't try this at home, by the way - the heated condensation and steam from that iron would have burned the baby long before he pulled the iron away, for crying out loud).When Farrell's crooked dealings go awry, he manages a nice little frame-up job on Norton in the hopes that Norton will keep his mouth shut and help to bury the truth about Farrell and his dirty cops. In a bit of god-I-hope-this-isn't-like-real-life weirdness, the internal investigators give everyone a few days to collect their thoughts and get their stories straight, and then call Norton in for a white-wash investigation. Norton's too honest to lie for his crooked brother-in-law, but he's too wrapped up in some ridiculous concept of 'family honor' to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.And this is the real failing of ""Pride and Glory"" - all this 'family honor' conceit flat out doesn't make any sense. A lot of effort has gone into making all the characters seem noble and tragic and sympathetic, but it's bunk because blind loyalty to *your* family above all else (and everyone else's families be trampled in the process, or maybe that just applies to families with brown skin) isn't noble or tragic - it's stupid. There's really nothing inherently sacred about the guy you're sister is sleeping with and Norton's whole ""I didn't do it, but I won't tell you who did"" act isn't noble - it's irritating. Assuming internal investigation does their job properly, Farrell's going done anyway so the only difference is whether he does so now or later - after murdering goodness knows how many more people. And the ending that wraps the whole movie up is easily the stupidest I've ever seen in a cop movie, and that's saying something.""Pride and Glory"" isn't a terrible movie... if it was cast with a bunch of no-names, it probably wouldn't have been such a let-down.

1218554,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001MZ5W3M,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 7]","""Pride and Glory"" is an interesting if clich&eacute;d title, especially since the cop characters in the film have neither pride nor glory; they only have shame and corruption. The thing is, shame and corruption are what most cop movies are about, which is to say that ""Pride and Glory"" is really no better and no worse than most cop movies you've seen before. Lines like, ""I will not apologize for doing what I do!"" and, ""Becoming a cop, the pledge we took to uphold something honest--we let it all rot from under us,"" and, ""You got no idea what it takes to do what we do,"" all find their way into this film, and I can't help but feel we've heard similar lines before. Consider this year's ""Righteous Kill"": ""Most people respect the badge,"" says Robert De Niro. ""Everyone respects the gun."" He was saying that people become cops for nothing other than respect, which to me seems like a fancy way of saying that most people have no idea what it takes to be a cop. If we're going to be told the same thing every time we see a cop movie, they're liable to get really bad.Still, ""Pride and Glory"" does have some redeeming qualities, namely strong performances by Edward Norton and Colin Farrell. They play NYPD officers who find themselves at opposite ends of the law. Ray Tierney (Norton) investigates a case that ultimately points to his brother-in-law, Jimmy Egan (Farrell), being involved in a dangerous police corruption scandal. I won't describe the scandal in detail, although I will say that drug dealing is involved. The real problems come not from the discovery of the corruption, but from Ray's belief in doing what's right; if he exposes Jimmy, the Tierney legacy--overseen by his father, Francis Tierney, Sr. (Jon Voight)--could be destroyed. The same goes for the reputation of the entire NYPD, which is threatening to Francis since he believes that cops should look out for one another. As for Ray's brother, Francis Tierney, Jr. (Noah Emmerich), he knows more about the scandal than he initially lets on, which eventually forces him to choose sides.Interwoven with this basic plot are a number of subplots, most of which focus on the main characters' personal lives. Jimmy, for example, is happily married to Francis and Ray's sister, Megan (Lake Bell). They also have two young children. Unfortunately, we don't get to know these secondary characters very well; they mostly serve as a reminder that a bad man is unfairly blessed with a good family. As far as Ray is concerned, there are vague moments with his wife, Tasha (Carmen Ejogo), hinting at the fact that they have separated and are in the process of getting a divorce. Why is never alluded to, although I guess we don't really need to know why. However, I would like to know why Ray is always compelled to leave Christmas gifts on her stoop every year. While it's obvious that he still has feelings for her, it's not so obvious why. And then there's Francis and his wife, Abby (Jennifer Ehle), who's dying of cancer. They share a couple of tender moments, although it's unclear what purpose Abby serves other than to be Francis' guiding light.There are specific scenes in this film that are baffling. One featuring Ray interrogating a Hispanic boy no older than five; the boy witnessed a suspect escaping from a neighboring apartment complex, so Ray needs him to look at pictures and identify the suspect. The boy remembers what he saw with such clarity that I never once believed it possible. Would a five-year-old remember that the bad man escaped in a white car with four doors? And how would he have been able to see the suspect's bleeding leg and belly? I agree that children can be very observant, to recall details with such accuracy seems a little farfetched. And then there's a very uncomfortable scene in which a group of cops break into a family's apartment; in an attempt to get some answers, one of the cops (I dare not say who) threatens to burn an infant with a working iron. I recognize that the purpose of that scene was to be shocking. Nevertheless, one wonders why the filmmakers didn't consider something a little less over the top, a little less melodramatic.But the greatest drawback of ""Pride and Glory"" stems from a lack of originality. There's an interesting Wikipedia.com quote from Declan Quinn, who served as the film's Director of Photography; he said that he wanted to find, ""a fresh way to do a police drama where it feels real and not like something we've seen a hundred times before."" Once you watch this movie, you'll realize that he--along with director/co-writer Gavin O'Connor--did not achieve that goal. ""Pride and Glory"" looks and feels like something we've already had to see a number of times, which is disappointing because it does make an effort to be compelling. I could tell that Norton and Farrell were doing as best they could, and I can certainly give O'Connor credit for wanting to use police corruption as a metaphor for corruption in the industrial world.

1218558,A3GD923K1K602I,B001MZ5W3M,"Dix88 ""Love Ocean""","[0, 0]","First let me say that I was a &#34;Gal Friday&#34; in the early 1980s at the Boulder Police Dept, Detective Division. I helped put together cases for the DA on rapes, homicides & other crimes. I sat up all night on look-outs, trying to track a suspect. One murder was especially horrific, the killing of a little boy by his mother's live-in lover. All the detectives were weeping over his death. The mother had lied & said she'd sold the boy & that was the weak hope.I had to guard this woman after she had confessed about her son's murder. There were other killings & so I am not a delicate little flower of a woman sitting behind protective doors. However, this film was too gruesome for me.These are all some of the better actors around, men & women. The story line is strong--a family of cops in a harsh part of NYC. One brother's (Franny's) team is ambushed & slaughtered, along with drug dealers.The father (played by Jon Voight) insists that his son (Edward Norton) lead a task force to investigate the ambush killings. Norton's character (Ray) is reluctant, due to an unrelated event that got him skittish but he does as his father says. There are some family dinner scenes with Voight as the tipsy father, proud of his sons (but saying nothing about his son-in-law). You meet the wives in these kinds of scenes.Colin Farrell plays Jimmy, who is married to Franny's & Ray's sister. He is a football hero, adores his wife & kids but we find out he has a terribly sinister side. He is the leader of a group of cops gone Very bad. They extort money from shop owners in what seems to be Spanish Harlem. At one point, Jimmy says to Ray &#34;We F***ing make $65,000/year while these scumbags are wipin' their asses on that every week!&#34; Money is a strong motive for going bad but also the daily grime of drug crimes, gang killings & constant threat of death.One of Jimmy's bad cop pals &#34;gets religion&#34; & feels horrible about the ambush. He has been fired by Franny who has found out that Sandy called to warn his old neighborhood pal (a gang member) about the bust which led to the ambush at the beginning of the film.So Sandy calls a reporter, gives him the whole story & then shoots himself in the reporter's car (he puts a sheet over his head first but it is still horribly bloody & shocking). I cared about Sandy & his death was awful. He was a sympathetic character.Jimmy & his cohorts blast into a poor family's apartment & terrorize them. They beat the husband/father mercilessly. Jimmy grabs an infant & holds a hot iron right up to its face (yes, I know, all done with smoke & mirrors & Colin Farrell, who has two sons would never do that in real life---but it was so realistic & horrific, I HATED these guys). They finally get the location of the gang lord they are searching for, in order to kill him before Ray or anyone else finds out about their involvement in the ambush killings & other bad behavior.Ray is beginning to get a vibe about Jimmy's involvement in very bad goings-on & as they are all searching for a gang lord (Tezo) who was involved in the ambush, Ray comes upon Jimmy & his gang of bad cops torturing Tezo. This scene is in semi-darkness but it is still so gruesome, it made me sick.I am not a wimp. I loved Scorcese's &#34;Gangs of NY.&#34; The characters in that film had such depth that the violence, though intense, was offset by the story, the character development (& revelations as to what made them who they were). But Pride & Glory, though well acted, didn't have enough character revelation (except for Sandy) to balance out the goriness & grime. Even with Colin Farrell's deep talent, the scene of him staring at photos of his family in the bar before Ray arrests him isn't enough to make us care about this  thug.Jimmy meets a horrible end during a huge riot caused when two of Jimmy's bad cops get caught in a shop one of them has gone to raid again. The citizens have had enough of their robbing, killing, beating. Even though he was a bad cop, throughouly corrupt, being beaten to death was hardly what I'd have wished for him. Beaten up, yes. Jailed for life, yes. The killing is &#34;offstage&#34; as they say in the theatre (a group surrounds him & the beating is heard rather than seen---but imagination tells a horrific story).The end shows Ray, Franny & their father going up the marble stairs of a justice building, obviously to tell all. Justice has one eye closed.My husband & I are afficianadoes of Colin Farrell's acting, since he appeared in a movie as Jesse James & had recurring roles in &#34;Ballykissangel.&#34; But I wish I hadn't seen him in this role. As I said, great acting. Just cannot get some of the brutal images (like the torture scene) out of my head.",3,Too Harsh for me (SPOILERS),1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,4737,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'was', '34', 'Gal', 'Friday', '34', 'early', '1980s', 'Boulder', 'Police', 'Dept', 'Detective', 'Division', 'helped', 'put', 'together', 'cases', 'DA', 'rapes', 'homicides', 'other', 'crimes', 'sat', 'up', 'night', 'look-outs', 'trying', 'track', 'suspect', 'One', 'murder', 'was', 'especially', 'horrific', 'killing', 'little', 'boy', 'mother', 'live-in', 'lover', 'detectives', 'were', 'weeping', 'death', 'mother', 'had', 'lied', 'said', ""'d"", 'sold', 'boy', 'was', 'weak', 'hope.I', 'had', 'guard', 'woman', 'had', 'confessed', 'son', 'murder', 'were', 'other', 'killings', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'delicate', 'little', 'flower', 'woman', 'sitting', 'protective', 'doors', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'gruesome', 'me.These', 'are', 'better', 'actors', 'men', 'women', 'story', 'line', 'strong', 'family', 'cops', 'harsh', 'part', 'NYC', 'One', 'brother', 'Franny', 'team', 'ambushed', 'slaughtered', 'drug', 'dealers.The', 'father', 'played', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'son', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'lead', 'task', 'force', 'investigate', 'ambush', 'killings', 'Norton', 'character', 'Ray', 'reluctant', 'due', 'unrelated', 'event', 'got', 'skittish', 'father', 'are', 'family', 'dinner', 'scenes', 'Voight', 'tipsy', 'father', 'proud', 'sons', 'saying', 'nothing', 'son-in-law', 'meet', 'wives', 'kinds', 'scenes.Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'married', 'Franny', 'Ray', 'sister', 'football', 'hero', 'wife', 'kids', 'find', 'out', 'terribly', 'sinister', 'side', 'leader', 'group', 'cops', 'gone', 'Very', 'bad', 'extort', 'money', 'shop', 'owners', 'what', 'be', 'Spanish', 'Harlem', 'one', 'point', 'Jimmy', 'Ray', '34', 'F***ing', 'make', '65,000/year', 'scumbags', 'are', 'wipin', 'asses', 'week', '34', 'Money', 'strong', 'motive', 'going', 'bad', 'also', 'daily', 'grime', 'drug', 'crimes', 'gang', 'killings', 'constant', 'threat', 'death.One', 'Jimmy', 'bad', 'cop', 'pals', '34', 'religion', '34', 'feels', 'horrible', 'ambush', 'been', 'fired', 'Franny', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'Sandy', 'called', 'warn', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'pal', 'gang', 'member', 'bust', 'led', 'ambush', 'beginning', 'film.So', 'Sandy', 'reporter', 'whole', 'story', 'then', 'reporter', 'car', 'sheet', 'head', 'first', 'still', 'horribly', 'bloody', 'shocking', 'cared', 'Sandy', 'death', 'was', 'awful', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'character.Jimmy', 'cohorts', 'blast', 'poor', 'family', 'apartment', 'terrorize', 'beat', 'husband/father', 'mercilessly', 'Jimmy', 'grabs', 'infant', 'hot', 'iron', 'right', 'up', 'face', 'yes', 'know', 'done', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'two', 'sons', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'horrific', 'HATED', 'guys', 'finally', 'get', 'location', 'gang', 'lord', 'are', 'searching', 'order', 'kill', 'Ray', 'anyone', 'else', 'out', 'involvement', 'ambush', 'killings', 'other', 'bad', 'behavior.Ray', 'beginning', 'get', 'vibe', 'Jimmy', 'involvement', 'very', 'bad', 'goings-on', 'are', 'searching', 'gang', 'lord', 'Tezo', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'ambush', 'Ray', 'Jimmy', 'gang', 'bad', 'cops', 'torturing', 'Tezo', 'scene', 'semi-darkness', 'still', 'so', 'gruesome', 'made', 'sick.I', 'am', 'not', 'wimp', 'loved', 'Scorcese', '34', 'Gangs', 'NY.', '34', 'characters', 'film', 'had', 'such', 'depth', 'violence', 'intense', 'was', 'offset', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'revelations', 'what', 'made', 'who', 'were', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'though', 'well', 'acted', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'character', 'revelation', 'Sandy', 'balance', 'out', 'goriness', 'grime', 'Even', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'deep', 'talent', 'scene', 'staring', 'photos', 'family', 'bar', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'thug.Jimmy', 'horrible', 'end', 'huge', 'riot', 'caused', 'when', 'two', 'Jimmy', 'bad', 'cops', 'get', 'caught', 'shop', 'one', 'gone', 'raid', 'again', 'citizens', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'robbing', 'killing', 'beating', 'Even', 'was', 'bad', 'cop', 'throughouly', 'corrupt', 'being', 'beaten', 'death', 'was', 'hardly', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'wished', 'Beaten', 'up', 'yes', 'Jailed', 'life', 'yes', 'killing', '34', 'offstage', '34', 'say', 'theatre', 'group', 'beating', 'heard', 'rather', 'seen', '-but', 'imagination', 'horrific', 'story', '.The', 'end', 'Ray', 'Franny', 'father', 'going', 'up', 'marble', 'stairs', 'justice', 'building', 'obviously', 'tell', 'Justice', 'one', 'eye', 'closed.My', 'husband', 'are', 'afficianadoes', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'acting', 'appeared', 'movie', 'Jesse', 'James', 'had', 'recurring', 'roles', '34', 'Ballykissangel.', '34', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'role', 'said', 'great', 'acting', 'Just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'brutal', 'images', 'torture', 'scene', 'head']",N/A

Hasn't this theme been hashed, rehashed, and overdone ad nauseam?  It sure has, but when you get a corrupt cop theme as superbly acted, and a film as skillfully made as PRIDE AND GLORY, you're seeing the wheel being reinvented right before your eyes.  This is a tightly-wound, gritty, dirty, ugly depiction of graft, corruption, and greed at its worst; yet it's also a story of devotion and love, as a multi-generational family of New York cops is about to be tested like never before.Edward Norton, Jon Voight, Colin Farrell, and Noah Emmerich are sensational.  What an ensemble!  Norton plays a detective investigating the deaths of four cops gunned down in what he learns is a setup, as he uncovers disturbing evidence of widespread graft and corruption on the part of his brother-in-law (Farrell), while his brother, the precinct captain (Emmerich), has been conveniently looking the other way.  The family patriarch (Voight) is more interested in his family protecting one another than getting to the truth.  Meanwhile, other subplots add to the texture of the story, including a cancer-stricken wife (Jennifer Ehle), and a distraught cop (John Ortiz is exceptional) who breaks the story to the media in a most disturbing manner.Accordingly, PRIDE AND GLORY examines this litany of complex issues at a frantic pace via marvelous acting.  The fate of Farrell's character is jolting, and for me, caught me completely off-guard.  But sudden twists and unexpected developments are inherent in a very good tale, which PRIDE AND GLORY most certainly is.--D.

Abbie's head is shaven; yet, she is still gorgeous on the outside -- while being consumed by terminal cancer on the inside. the couple knows this will be their last 'Christmas present' to each other. the scene was so moving that i honestly forgot that it contains just a smidgeon of nudity (notwithstanding that, *pace* Chris Matthews, while watching Miss Ehle ""i felt this thrill going up *my*

Despite some riveting performances by a group of some of our better actors - Edward Norton, Colin Farrell, Jon Voight, Noah Emmerich and Jennifer Ehle - the very obvious committee written (Joe Carnahan, Gavin O'Connor,  Gregory O'Connor and Robert Hopes) story and screenplay simply falls apart at every gross killing and murder scene.  Gavin O'Connor's direction fails to propel the action in a credible manner, allowing incidental sidebars that add nothing except hole patching to the film.The story is so overused that a synopsis is unnecessary: an Irish family of cops stumbles along the way of law and order, falling into the business of stealing and murder to cover their misdeeds, until one of the brothers has the courage to 'go straight' to make amends for his own past infractions.One of the early distractions in viewing this film about contemporary New York crime and law enforcement foibles is a soundtrack that buries the dialogue.  It is doubtful that the viewer can even follow the story without the help of English subtitles to compensate for the inaudible spoken word, but then so often the script is so weak that perhaps this is not a flaw but a benefit.  This is a film for those who deeply admire the work of the main actors, but brace yourselves for a film that in the end is simply annoying.

1218572,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B001MZ5W3M,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 2]","I bought this Blu-ray at a ridiculously low price at Walmart primarily because it was a Gavin O'Connor film.  I'd never seen ""Pride and Glory"" but I've seen O'Connor's films ""Miracle"" and ""Warrior"" numerous times and those are excellent, excellent films.""Pride and Glory"" is nothing special, sad to say.  It's the story of a multi-generational family of NYC cops torn apart by corruption.  There's not much original in that, but even an oft-told tale can be interesting if told in a compelling way.  But that's not the case here.The most glaring problem is with the casting:  Edward Norton and Noah Emmerich play the sons of Jon Voight, and good luck finding three other actors who look less convincing as blood relatives.  Voight's wife and Norton and Emmerich's mother in the film is at least partially Hispanic, too, but there are no traces of that in her kids.  [Jon Voight was a last-minute replacement for Nick Nolte, who bowed out near the start of filming.  That combination would not have been any more convincing than this one.]I like Edward Norton.  I think he is a fine actor.  I just think he was miscast in this role.  He can play ""intense"" when he needs to but in this movie he looks like a little kid trying to act tough.  He also lacks the physicality one would expect in his character.  Voight, another very fine actor, is a bit uneven but I chalk that up to the script.Colin Farrell, however, is solid throughout the film.  In fact, what I found to be most interesting about this film was the casting of the supporting actors who surround Farrell.  Actors John Ortiz and Shea Wigham played antagonists to Farrell's characters in ""Miami Vice"" and ""Tigerland"", respectively, but play his partners in crime in this film.  Wink wink! One wonders if Farrell had a hand in getting his buddies cast in this movie (not that they'd need the help -- both Ortiz and Wigham have the goods).In all, though, ""Pride and Glory"" is simply less than the sum of its parts.  Gavin O'Connor proved with his films ""Tumbleweeds"", ""Miracle"", and ""Warrior"" that he can deliver a fine film.  It was largely based on those films that I took a chance and bought this Blu-ray even having never seen the film before.  But this film just doesn't measure up, in my opinion.  It's not a bad film per se, but it feels like a retread of earlier, superior works.  Recast it with someone other than Norton and maybe it would play a bit better.The director is very clear in the documentary feature that they had no completed script when they started shooting and that Edward Norton was a constant source of aggravation, especially given his tendency to go off-script, argue the script, or insist on doing re-writes.  The chaotic nature of the production took a toll on the picture.  The climax of the film plays like it was thrown together at the last minute (which I believe it was) and the final scene/shot in the film looks arbitrary.A hip-hop performer raps over the music during the end credits, but it is an inappropriate piece of music to rap to.  It doesn't work.  Not much about this movie works.The best part of this film was Colin Farrell, who interestingly gets ZERO mention or footage in the hour-long documentary.  His exclusion from that seems deliberate.  And though the director never actually says out loud that he would prefer to never work with Edward Norton again, you can see it on his face and hear it in his voice.

I liked the movie a lot but I must say that even I can see that this film is not for everyone. I am giving it 4 stars because I really did enjoy it, but cannot say that I would reccomend this gritty cop drama to everyone.What I liked:First, I very much enjoyed the plot of this film. As a negative reviewer notes, we find out early on who the ""good cops"" and ""bad cops"" are (there is one question mark until about halfway through the film). But like many stories, the thrill of Pride and Glory is not about finding out which sides the players are on, but on watching how the story unfolds (and there is high drama in this story).I thought the actors were very well cast and played their parts very well. Noah Emerich and Colin Farrell did particlarly god jobs as time-toughened  New York cops, and Edward Norton was a good choice to play the ""cop who still believes in truth"" around whom our story hinges.What You Might Not Like:This film does not have a fast pace. I did not check, but I am quite sure that this film is somwhat over two hours, and one can feel every second of it. I do think that some parts could have been removed from the film, but - as with films like Goodfellas - doing so would have diminished the overall emotional impact. It is a long and ""draggy"" film, though, and that might not sit well with everyone.The film is very gritty and, to be honest, there are some parts that are hard to watch. Some, like myself, call this a necessary realism but others will not be amused by the over-the-top cursing and graphic violence. If you are faint of heart in any way, you might wait until this film is shown on network television.If you are fine with gritty films and don't mind sitting throgh a 2-plus hour, gradually unfolding cop drama then I think you will like this film as much as I did and I wholly reccomend it.

For example:1. Can we really believe that some number of police single other officer else knew about? And that they could burn it without anyone knowing about it. (There was no leakage on the radio?)2. Can we really believe that a police officer's going into a store to rob it was enough to create a riot the size of the one featured at the end of the film?3. Can we really believe that a drug dealer that does not want to be found would be found within the space of a day?  And then when he WAS found, he would go out without a fight? (He was portrayed as a bad MF in the earliest parts of the movie. But he went out like a 'ho when he was found.)4. If someone is a crooked cop, fair enough. But it seems that all these cops developed morality just in time to make a good scene. So, one cop has been on the take for some number of years. And knew what was his involvment in a murder plot. He didn't seem the faintest bit fussed -- until after a reporter called him for an interview. Then he conveniently needed to commit suicide after the interview. The next cop committed suicide by mob (that's the first time I've ever seen that). But he only committed suicide after there was a mob there which he could use in the service of his suicide-- and he only developed some morality at just that point.Save your money.

Although the excellent flick from 2007: ""we own the night"" did tell a great story featuring cops that for once isn't a dirty cop movie.  It used to be cop movies were about the majority of cops who are decent men and women and the exception was the dirty cop movie. Which is porportionally right in most police departments. Although throughout our history some groups have had corruption swamp them.  The drug culture can destroy all it touches even the police when they get involved with drugs.  A third of the narcotic officers in 1975, New York,  were corrupted and betrayed their city and people. But few forces today are this bad and New York has  truly one of the worlds finest police forces on the planet, (this movie takes place in New York). But  you would assume that all police are mainly corrupt everywhere, according to most of the movies coming out of  Hollywood ( and the even worse b movies from everywhere). This movie in spite of it's truly great actors and strong supporting cast is just another one of those bad cop movies. Of course having Edward Norton as the lead in your movie is always a good thing too as the man is always exceptional.

While Pride and Glory does nothing new in its storytelling, the film is compelling regardless, and the main cast does teriffic work as well. What really hurts the film however is the fact that it is simply too long, and the sympathy that the viewer is supposed to feel for Jimmy as the film reaches a close just doesn't work. This isn't because of Farrell at all (as said before, he does a great job) but rather due to what we've seen from the character up to this point. The screenplay from director Gavin O'Connor and Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin Aces) has a lot of good ideas, but there's just too many formulaic shortcuts to set it apart from the pack.

They definitely delivered in a story that offers a brutal and unrelenting look at the dark side of metropolitan life.  Voight plays the patriarch of a NYPD family.  His sons Ray (played by Norton) and Francis (Noah Emmerich) have both risen through the ranks, while his son-in-law Jimmy Egan (Ferrell) is a beat cop under Fran's command.The upshot of the story is the conflict between conscience and corruption, and the desire to protect both the family and the NYPD from the fallout of a crooked deal gone bad.  As the truth begins to come out, the family members' lives begin to unravel both personally and professionally.  I won't get into any spoilers, other than to say the tension between the brothers becomes almost palpable, and the suspense only builds as the movie progresses.The great strength of this movie, aside from stellar performances by the actors I mentioned above, is its unflinching realism.  The only real flaw is that the producers packed in maybe just a little too much pathos.  The wife with cancer, the handful of totally out-of-control cops, and the perpetually dark settings, for example, take what is otherwise a totally believable story and push it just over the edge a bit.  I would also add that, at least early on, both the dialogue and storyline are hard to follow, but that sorts itself out before long.  Overall I have to give this movie some high marks.Just a final note for those who are sensitive to hard language -- the f-bomb drops in darn near every sentence, sometimes more than once per line.

In fact, we were still discussing it the next day. Our conclusion is, that after seeing almost every 'good cop, bad cop' film available, this ranks among our top five. I'm really surprised at the 1 and 2 star reviews.Yes, this theme has been overused, but it was the acting that made this production stand apart. It was superb! You can't help but become enmeshed with this Irish family of cops, spanning generations, who find themselves with colliding ethics.  Their intense love and respect for one another is palpable and quite sad.  Even when doing 'the right thing,' when confronting someone you love---particularly family, the feelings of betrayal are overwhelming and this was so well drawn out with these amazing characters.Edward Norton's portrayal of the NYPD Detective (Ray) attempting to redeem himself for misuse of power previously, is gritty and intense. But, he's a damaged man; his behavior could be unpredictable. You can't wait to see him facing unimaginable choices on his road to redemption. One of his best roles, to date, IMHO.Colin Farrell (Jimmy) did not disappoint as the very, very, bad boy, brother-in- law.  He does bad, SOOOO well!Police Commander, Noah Emmerich (Francis Jr.), tugs at your heart, as the older brother of Norton. He is facing the loss of his wife to cancer, while having to confront issues within himself of turning a blind eye to some of the behaviors of 'his boys,' allowing things to spiral out of control. How far have his professional ethics been tested?John Voigt (Francis Sr.), the Patriarch of the family and a strong defender for maintaining the honor of the force, at all costs, was wonderful. It was good to see him with a piece of challenging work, for a change.Be prepared that this film is quite violent, raw and played out on the streets of darkness, and despair. The violence and language is authentic, for those demanding realism, but not for those overly sensitive to such themes.A word of advice. You need to pay close attention to this movie. There are many characters to keep up with, all with stories of their own. My only complaint was that the characters really had to be allowed to develop for a bit before I could keep them and their stories straight.

It features Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) as an experienced cop who has been on kind of a light duty status since a traumatic episode in which he had been injured.  His father, Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) is the city's chief of detectives.  Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) and brother-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) round out the multi-generational police family.Ray is assigned by his father Francis to investigate a case where four police officers were killed.  As he looks into it, he finds that there are some corrupt cops involved including family members.  The conflicts and ugliness are all brought to the surface.The performances by Norton and Farrell are very good.  Voight is outstanding as always.  This is really probably 3-1/2 stars.

Yes, I know it has a terrific cast with some great actors in it but that has already been pointed out by many.Video:Quite grainy which may be intentionally that way to fit the gritty nature of the movie about corrupt cops both within a cop family and out.  Cooler color grading in most areas  with its bluish tonality and soft contrast in the smaller details.  Decent contrast in the close ups. The whole film has been desaturated a touch in the post production so colors really do not pop but that fits the nature of the film as well.  Mbps range is low averaging between the low teens and low twenties.  No artifacting or ghost trails.  I believe this was simply transferred from SD to HD without much, if any, remastering and doubt you would see much difference between the two.Audio:Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio was surprisingly good with the surrounds used primarily for ambience, but there were plenty of low volumed  foley effects discreetly placed for both the front and rears.  Little LFE use but several good audio pans across both the front and rear sound stages.  The audio of this film really is the star of the transfer.The only extra was a 45 minute Making of Pride and Glory that had its moments of interest.  There are no deleted scenes, bloopers or anything else.  At least, there are no advertisements for other films.If you already have this film on Standard Def DVD I do not believe that you will see much difference in the video.  However, and I do not own the SD disc, you very well may be able to hear a more transparent audio and that might be all it takes.  Never the less, even though the audio is quite good, I would not use this Blu Ray as any sort of DEMO disc for either audio or video.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the video and audio transfers to blu ray and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.Thanks for reading",3,Pride and Glory on Blu Ray,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,2091,"['Most', 'everyone', 'summary', 'storyline', 'opinions', 'acting', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'redundant', 'will', 'focus', 'review', 'strictly', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Yes', 'know', 'terrific', 'cast', 'great', 'actors', 'already', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'many.Video', 'Quite', 'grainy', 'may', 'be', 'intentionally', 'way', 'fit', 'gritty', 'nature', 'movie', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'cop', 'family', 'out', 'Cooler', 'color', 'grading', 'most', 'areas', 'bluish', 'tonality', 'soft', 'contrast', 'smaller', 'details', 'Decent', 'contrast', 'close', 'ups', 'whole', 'film', 'been', 'desaturated', 'touch', 'post', 'production', 'colors', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'pop', 'nature', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Mbps', 'range', 'low', 'averaging', 'low', 'teens', 'low', 'twenties', 'artifacting', 'ghost', 'trails', 'believe', 'was', 'simply', 'transferred', 'SD', 'HD', 'much', 'remastering', 'doubt', 'would', 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'two.Audio', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'surrounds', 'used', 'primarily', 'ambience', 'were', 'plenty', 'low', 'volumed', 'foley', 'effects', 'discreetly', 'placed', 'front', 'rears', 'Little', 'LFE', 'use', 'several', 'good', 'audio', 'pans', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stages', 'audio', 'film', 'really', 'star', 'transfer.The', 'only', 'extra', 'was', '45', 'minute', 'Making', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'had', 'moments', 'interest', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'anything', 'else', 'least', 'are', 'advertisements', 'other', 'films.If', 'already', 'have', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'video', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'SD', 'disc', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'more', 'transparent', 'audio', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'even', 'audio', 'quite', 'good', 'would', 'not', 'use', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'sort', 'DEMO', 'disc', 'audio', 'video.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'transfers', 'blu', 'ray', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

I mean literally every other word is F, or GD, or Csucker, you name it its here. Tactful use of words can be done an executed very well, take phone booth for example, it was pretty filthy as far as language, but it stopped at times to give you a break and it was a great story and tasteful movie. This is just bad bad bad, two brothers on different ends of the spectrum such as cane vs able, one good cop one not so good. Not to spoil it but a certain person got his own men killed and now has to weasel his way out of it somehow, and use his own flesh and blood to try and do so. John Voight(DAD), is a great actor but even he was not immune from the bad dialog and horrible language. Getting to the end i will say the worst part of this entire film and why people watch this crap and think nothing of it, is just staggering to me. Colin Farrell takes his men into a suspected dealers home(Mexican of course), the mom is holding the baby, he's so angry that he doesnt even care and punches the woman in the face while she's holding the baby, as the baby cries(note YES its a REAL BABY). He proceeds to take a clothing iron and put it over top of the tiny infant, and threatens to burn it by pushing it down on its face, either killing it or permenantly scarring it for life. Come on Colin, how much money were they paying you to do such a degrading and tasteless scene. I've heard of pushing the envelope but this is just to far, now how many psychos out there will get the idea hey, i think i'll stick a scorching hot iron over my babys face, and deform it for life. Todays movies just take things to far, and people just except it for what it is, thats sad. This is getting worse and worse as time goes on. The movie itself is VERY drawn out, even though the acting is pretty good, it can't save the muddled script even with the great Edward Norton at the helm. So don't waste your time with this one unless you just want a movie chocked full of bad language, violence, and senseless acts or cruelty. Basically thats all this movie has to offer.

This is why I didn't give it four stars but I have to give a lot of credit to the actors especially Collin Farrell. He is brilliant in this movie. I have to say, he nailed his performance to the tee. So the story goes: A family of cops, the dad (Jon Voight (Francis Sr.), his two sons (Edward Norton (Ray),Noah Emmerich (Francis Jr.) and their brother in law (Collin Farrell (Jimmy). They were all after this drug dealer who killed four other cops. Ray was thrown in this wild goose chase only to find out that Jimmy was somehow involved. So Jimmy somehow framed Ray (can't spoil the movie too much), they were in this battle of Ray's words against Jimmy. The ending could've been better but overall, it is a pretty good movie.

1218619,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001MZ5W3M,Z Hayes,"[5, 6]","""Pride and Glory"" is a run-of-the-mill corrupt cop story that nevertheless proved entertaining, in part because of the excellent acting by the leads. Edward Norton is in fine form as Ray, a detective who comes from a family of cops, i.e. dad [Jon Voight], and brother, Precinct Commander Francis Tierney [Noah Emmerich], as well as brother-in-law Jimmy [Colin Farrell]. When Ray investigates the murder of four cops during a drug raid, he uncovers clues implicating his brother-in-law Jimmy, who together with a few other cops are on the take. When Jimmy realises Ray is on to him, he tries to implicate Ray in the murder of a suspect. Ray is torn between loyalty to family and upholding the cop code of 'taking care of our own' ,and exposing Jimmy and his cronies for the crooked cops they are.""Pride and Glory"" is a taut cop drama, with enough suspense and action to please most fans of the genre. The acting is excellent - especially Colin Farrell's crooked cop Jimmy, whose desperation to cover his tracks unleashes a level of brutality that appeared very credible [though holding a hot iron over a baby seemed a tad extreme to me], and Edward Norton's good cop Ray is also well done.Yet there were quite a few implausible plot threads that annoyed me, and the climactic bar brawl scene seemed over-the-top and unnecessary, as was the street battery scene. Other than that, ""Pride and Glory""  did not break any new ground in the genre.",3,"Implausible, over the top yet entertaining",1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1439,"['Pride', 'Glory', 'run-of-the-mill', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'story', 'nevertheless', 'proved', 'entertaining', 'part', 'excellent', 'acting', 'leads', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fine', 'form', 'Ray', 'detective', 'who', 'family', 'cops', 'i.e', 'dad', '[', 'Jon', 'Voight', ']', 'brother', 'Precinct', 'Commander', 'Francis', 'Tierney', '[', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', ']', 'as', 'well', 'brother-in-law', 'Jimmy', '[', 'Colin', 'Farrell', ']', 'When', 'Ray', 'murder', 'four', 'cops', 'drug', 'raid', 'clues', 'implicating', 'brother-in-law', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'together', 'few', 'other', 'cops', 'are', 'take', 'When', 'Jimmy', 'Ray', 'implicate', 'Ray', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Ray', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'family', 'upholding', 'cop', 'code', ""'taking"", 'care', 'own', 'exposing', 'Jimmy', 'cronies', 'crooked', 'cops', 'are', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'taut', 'cop', 'drama', 'enough', 'suspense', 'action', 'please', 'most', 'fans', 'genre', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Jimmy', 'desperation', 'cover', 'tracks', 'level', 'brutality', 'appeared', 'very', 'credible', '[', 'holding', 'hot', 'iron', 'baby', 'seemed', 'tad', 'extreme', ']', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'good', 'cop', 'Ray', 'also', 'well', 'done.Yet', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'implausible', 'plot', 'threads', 'annoyed', 'climactic', 'bar', 'brawl', 'scene', 'seemed', 'over-the-top', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'street', 'battery', 'scene', 'Other', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'genre']",N/A
