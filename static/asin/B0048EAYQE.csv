1389140,AOB5695UUUJ0,B0048EAYQE,"Anime Lover ""D""","[21, 21]","i gave this a 5 star based just on the show, not about the price.the back of the box says it allthe good news - he just got into the pants of the hottest girl in schoolthe bad news - HE is the hottest girl in shool, and there are other girls out there who want to take her out.  he is SO not going to like being a girlNatsuru is surprised when Kaede, the girl he loves, gives him a stuffed tiger from the Bowel Familiar series and the next morning finds out he is now a girl and wearing a blue bracelet, and then the Tiger talks telling him he is chosen to fight as a female warrior known as a Kampfer fighting in a secret war run by a group called the Moderators.  The next day as a guy he runs into Kaede, but then the bracelet glows turning him back into a girl.  He runs into a red haired girl wielding a large automatic pistol, who tries to kill him he protects Kaede using Zauber (magic projectile), but he also saves the mysterious girl from a street lamp falling on her, and when she see he has a blue bracelet she calls it off.  At school (which is co-ed but the guys go to one side, the girls to the other) a young lady named Akane meets him in the library.  she is also a Kampfer (the one with the gun) and explains there are three types of Kampfers, gunners, swordsmen, and Zauber (actually they use the german words for guns and sword.  Then the big surprise is when he finds out that the girl he loves, bats on the other side of the plate and actually prefers the girl Natsuru (big crush to his heart).  Amd when the student body president is found out to also be a Kampfer, one wearing a red bracelet and supposed to be their enemy, takes in interest his world gets turned upside down.  He is enrolled in both sides of the school, and there is a rumor that he is dating himself, not to mention he is still getting used to the fact he now has a very large chest and different plumbing.  But when a new group comes onto the scene, can the Reds and Blues join forces to combat this new threat, and who is behind them.Overall it is a good series. The physical battles are few, but quick paced, as this is like harem comedies like Tenchi or Dual.  The battles are more towards the feelings of the girls (including Natsuru) as the girls try to get the attention of the thick headed hero (and heroine in Kaede's case).  It is mild to moderate Ecchi as while there is a good level of fan service, it does follow a tv-14 rating with steam or towels or other body parts blocking the naughty bits (especially during the pool resort/bathouse episodes).  the only down side is the price, i got it when it first came out so i got it cheaper than it is now  but if they were broken down into 3 disks, the collection is cheaper (would be 20/disc so 45 compared to 60) .  but it is a good series and how it ended gives a large opening and a lot of questions to still be answered.  and there is a second season coming down the pipe i will keep an eye out for it.  later",5,"Great show, price needs to drop a little",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2966,"['i', 'gave', '5', 'star', 'based', 'just', 'show', 'not', 'price.the', 'back', 'box', 'allthe', 'good', 'news', 'just', 'got', 'pants', 'hottest', 'girl', 'schoolthe', 'bad', 'news', 'HE', 'hottest', 'girl', 'shool', 'are', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'out', 'SO', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'being', 'girlNatsuru', 'surprised', 'when', 'Kaede', 'girl', 'stuffed', 'tiger', 'Bowel', 'Familiar', 'series', 'next', 'morning', 'out', 'now', 'girl', 'wearing', 'blue', 'bracelet', 'then', 'Tiger', 'talks', 'telling', 'chosen', 'fight', 'female', 'warrior', 'known', 'Kampfer', 'fighting', 'secret', 'war', 'run', 'group', 'called', 'Moderators', 'next', 'day', 'guy', 'Kaede', 'then', 'bracelet', 'turning', 'back', 'girl', 'red', 'haired', 'girl', 'wielding', 'large', 'automatic', 'pistol', 'who', 'kill', 'Kaede', 'using', 'Zauber', 'magic', 'projectile', 'also', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'street', 'lamp', 'falling', 'when', 'see', 'blue', 'bracelet', 'off', 'school', 'co-ed', 'guys', 'go', 'one', 'side', 'girls', 'other', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Akane', 'meets', 'library', 'also', 'Kampfer', 'one', 'gun', 'are', 'three', 'types', 'Kampfers', 'gunners', 'swordsmen', 'Zauber', 'actually', 'use', 'german', 'words', 'guns', 'sword', 'Then', 'big', 'surprise', 'when', 'out', 'girl', 'bats', 'other', 'side', 'plate', 'actually', 'girl', 'Natsuru', 'big', 'crush', 'heart', 'when', 'student', 'body', 'president', 'found', 'also', 'be', 'Kampfer', 'one', 'wearing', 'red', 'bracelet', 'supposed', 'be', 'enemy', 'interest', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'enrolled', 'sides', 'school', 'rumor', 'dating', 'not', 'mention', 'still', 'getting', 'used', 'fact', 'now', 'very', 'large', 'chest', 'different', 'plumbing', 'when', 'new', 'group', 'scene', 'can', 'Reds', 'Blues', 'join', 'forces', 'combat', 'new', 'threat', 'who', 'them.Overall', 'good', 'series', 'physical', 'battles', 'are', 'few', 'quick', 'paced', 'harem', 'comedies', 'Tenchi', 'Dual', 'battles', 'are', 'more', 'feelings', 'girls', 'including', 'Natsuru', 'girls', 'try', 'get', 'attention', 'thick', 'headed', 'hero', 'heroine', 'Kaede', 'case', 'mild', 'moderate', 'Ecchi', 'good', 'level', 'fan', 'service', 'follow', 'tv-14', 'rating', 'steam', 'towels', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'blocking', 'naughty', 'bits', 'especially', 'pool', 'resort/bathouse', 'episodes', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'price', 'i', 'got', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'i', 'got', 'cheaper', 'now', 'were', 'broken', 'down', '3', 'disks', 'collection', 'cheaper', 'would', 'be', '20/disc', 'so', '45', 'compared', '60', 'good', 'series', 'how', 'ended', 'large', 'opening', 'lot', 'questions', 'still', 'be', 'answered', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'down', 'pipe', 'i', 'will', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'later']",Kämpfer Complete Collection
1389141,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,B0048EAYQE,Avantel,"[1, 1]","At first this seems to be a typical fantasy-action Japanese cartoon (anime), but it turns out to be mostly comedy! I enjoyed it quite a lot, however I must mention some issues. Their constant Japanese celebrities name-dropping will annoy anybody not familiar with anime, let alone the fact that the series is only spoken in Japanese. Well, the constant name dropping is part of the comedy, but it's meaningless to translate. This is a product mostly for long time anime fans or ""otaku"" to the point that they actually enjoy listening the shows in their original language (like me). The producers must have guessed it was not worth to pay American-voice actors for such reduced public and left it alone, good choice I think.Besides comedy, it has a bit of sex. The Japanese like to mix comedy and sex, but Americans do not so much (must be the puritan thing), too bad. Moreover, some others will have a problem with a central character (Natsuru) who is not the typical arrogant, stupid, macho, trouble-maker stereotype that both Hollywood and the much of American public revere. Natsuru is the Japanese stereotype instead, humble but with clear standards. The contrast with the American type is so sharp that many reviewers (possible otakus included) failed to understand him and even stated false comment about him, like saying he only follows orders without thinking. For once, he objected to the fights in the show, the first time that I see a character doing such a thing in any show ever. They always automatically go for the fight, not him.It looks like you'll need to be a fan of Japanese culture beyond sushi and their typical sci-fi series in order to enjoy Kampfer.

This could have been an interesting show that could have resolved nicely in 13 episodes. Instead we get filler material like beauty contest episodes & the like. The main character is basically a brain dead wimp throughout the series, just going with whatever stupid thing happens to him, never questioning anything. I mean seriously, he transforms into a woman, and just accpets it all, never even trieds to investigate what is going on here. By the time they get back to any plot or action, it is too late to develop it into anything interesting - because they used up too much time with a bunch of episodes on really dumb stuff. This show has a lot of fan service, and I have no complaints about fan service in anime if there is something interesting going on besides that. But when it is filler due to unsinspired writing, it seems to me they are hoping fan serevice alone will keep people watching. Sorry, but that isn't enough to keep my interest.

1389145,A182VTJIIEVM37,B0048EAYQE,GintaxAlvissforever,"[3, 3]","I was really excited when I heard that there was an anime where the main guy ended up with special powers that turned him into a girl while everyone around him either had their appearance or personality change to match the battle. I liked the idea of being a girl and having to live with it more times than not. I was loving the idea that the girl of his dreams was a lesbian and interested in his other gender bender.The anime fails to execute what could have been a good series and here's why.Natsuru is such an unlikable protagonists. He's one of the dumbest protagonists of all times up there with Makoto from School Days (but Makoto is at the top because he's a scumbag to boot) and Saito from The Familiar Zero. The novel does a good reason explaining why he's so dumb (and it's a spoiler) but the anime does not elaborate and makes him the stupidest guy on the planet. He has all the girls fighting for him and declaring his love and he can only think of staring at the moon thinking how beautiful it is...what?! To make matters worse, Natsuru is only there for being the eye candy of everyone in gender bender form. He cannot fight and while at the beginning of the anime, he's shown wanting to fight and help his comrades out the anime later makes him so incompetent to make him the damsel in distress only in female form and used purely for fanservice reasons. Why give him a gender bender with fire powers at all if he's just going to be used for breast close ups and panty shots and fanservice?His other allies are either missed opportunities or badly written (in the anime anyway). His partner Akane is notorious for being a borderline complete monster that is ready to kill anyone in her way regardless if they have anything to do with the battle of Kampfer or not. She's written as a villain and it's nearly forgotten as the anime goes on and just makes her a tsundere. This is simply bad writing on the anime's part. Next is Sango is the only character done right but again the anime fails to elaborate on her backstory and is only brought up in the last episode just to cause shock value and make you hate the villain more (not like you hate her from the start given how obnoxious she is before the reveal). Mikoto, Natsuru's childhood friend is just there to give Sango a partner in the game and she's not even a threat in the harem given how Natsuru tends to dismiss her the majority of the series. Her battle form is very unique but she only turns into it a few times.Finally Kaede. She is one of the worse characters in the series with Natsuru. Not only does she have nothing interested about her except being a psycho lesbian obsessed with getting laid with Natsuru (and this is exaggerated as the anime goes on to the point where it's not even cute or funny anymore and is just plain stalkerish). After all, she fell for female Natsuru because in female form, she was rescued by psycho Akane). And what they do with her character near the end does not save her anyway because it comes out of nowhere.The anime only seems to focus on the fanservice, yuri moments and more fanservice instead of the action. The summary clearly makes it seem like it would be an action harem series but it just ends up being a fanservice disguised as an action to pull you in. We get a few fights that don't even last the whole episode and the fights in later episodes are rushed to fit in as much of shock value as possible. It's a shame because Natsuru and Akane's fight with Sango was amazing. And the worse thing is that the fights aren't really explained well in the anime and why the girls are fighting against each other in the first place. It just seems there to cause conflict which could easily be a romantic comedy.Which leads to one last thing. Many characters that had important roles in the novel were cut out. Midori is a character in the novel that is part of the red team and is Sango's real partner but they cut her out and mention her twice and then she's never heard from again. She was a major character for Palutena's sake and they left her out for inconvenience.Overall, I found this anime to be very poor and when they announce an OVA, it doesn't do justice because it's more fanservice and no action. The only reason I'm not giving this anime a 1 star is because I LOVE the artwork and I love the concept originally before it was executed incorrectly and finally the action scenes that were in the anime made it very cool. So 2 stars out of 5. -sigh- If only there wasn't that much fanservice it would be much higher rating, but there are better animes out there.",2,The Anime Butchered The Novel of What Made it Stand Out,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,4591,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'anime', 'where', 'main', 'guy', 'ended', 'up', 'special', 'powers', 'turned', 'girl', 'everyone', 'had', 'appearance', 'personality', 'change', 'match', 'battle', 'liked', 'idea', 'being', 'girl', 'having', 'live', 'more', 'times', 'not', 'was', 'loving', 'idea', 'girl', 'dreams', 'was', 'lesbian', 'interested', 'other', 'gender', 'bender.The', 'anime', 'execute', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'series', 'here', 'why.Natsuru', 'such', 'unlikable', 'protagonists', 'one', 'dumbest', 'protagonists', 'times', 'up', 'there', 'Makoto', 'School', 'Days', 'Makoto', 'top', 'scumbag', 'boot', 'Saito', 'Familiar', 'Zero', 'novel', 'good', 'reason', 'explaining', 'why', 'so', 'dumb', 'spoiler', 'anime', 'not', 'elaborate', 'stupidest', 'guy', 'planet', 'girls', 'fighting', 'declaring', 'love', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'staring', 'moon', 'thinking', 'how', 'beautiful', 'what', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Natsuru', 'only', 'there', 'being', 'eye', 'candy', 'everyone', 'gender', 'bender', 'form', 'can', 'not', 'fight', 'beginning', 'anime', 'shown', 'wanting', 'fight', 'help', 'comrades', 'out', 'anime', 'later', 'so', 'incompetent', 'make', 'damsel', 'distress', 'only', 'female', 'form', 'used', 'purely', 'fanservice', 'reasons', 'Why', 'give', 'gender', 'bender', 'fire', 'powers', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'breast', 'close', 'ups', 'panty', 'shots', 'fanservice', 'other', 'allies', 'are', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'badly', 'written', 'anime', 'anyway', 'partner', 'Akane', 'notorious', 'being', 'borderline', 'complete', 'monster', 'ready', 'kill', 'anyone', 'way', 'regardless', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'battle', 'Kampfer', 'not', 'written', 'villain', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'anime', 'just', 'tsundere', 'simply', 'bad', 'writing', 'anime', 'part', 'Next', 'Sango', 'only', 'character', 'done', 'right', 'again', 'anime', 'elaborate', 'backstory', 'only', 'brought', 'up', 'last', 'episode', 'just', 'cause', 'shock', 'value', 'make', 'hate', 'villain', 'more', 'not', 'hate', 'start', 'given', 'how', 'obnoxious', 'reveal', 'Mikoto', 'Natsuru', 'childhood', 'friend', 'just', 'there', 'give', 'Sango', 'partner', 'game', 'not', 'even', 'threat', 'harem', 'given', 'how', 'Natsuru', 'dismiss', 'majority', 'series', 'battle', 'form', 'very', 'unique', 'only', 'few', 'times.Finally', 'Kaede', 'one', 'worse', 'characters', 'series', 'Natsuru', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'nothing', 'interested', 'being', 'psycho', 'lesbian', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'laid', 'Natsuru', 'exaggerated', 'anime', 'point', 'where', 'not', 'even', 'cute', 'funny', 'anymore', 'just', 'plain', 'stalkerish', 'fell', 'female', 'Natsuru', 'female', 'form', 'was', 'rescued', 'psycho', 'Akane', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'end', 'not', 'save', 'anyway', 'nowhere.The', 'anime', 'only', 'focus', 'fanservice', 'yuri', 'moments', 'more', 'fanservice', 'instead', 'action', 'summary', 'clearly', 'would', 'be', 'action', 'harem', 'series', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'fanservice', 'disguised', 'action', 'pull', 'get', 'few', 'fights', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'whole', 'episode', 'fights', 'later', 'episodes', 'are', 'rushed', 'fit', 'as', 'much', 'shock', 'value', 'possible', 'shame', 'Natsuru', 'Akane', 'fight', 'Sango', 'was', 'amazing', 'worse', 'thing', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'explained', 'well', 'anime', 'why', 'girls', 'are', 'fighting', 'other', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'there', 'cause', 'conflict', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy.Which', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'Many', 'characters', 'had', 'important', 'roles', 'novel', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'Midori', 'character', 'novel', 'part', 'red', 'team', 'Sango', 'real', 'partner', 'cut', 'out', 'mention', 'twice', 'then', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'was', 'major', 'character', 'Palutena', 'sake', 'left', 'out', 'inconvenience.Overall', 'found', 'anime', 'be', 'very', 'poor', 'when', 'announce', 'OVA', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'more', 'fanservice', 'action', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anime', '1', 'star', 'LOVE', 'artwork', 'love', 'concept', 'originally', 'was', 'executed', 'incorrectly', 'finally', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'anime', 'made', 'very', 'cool', 'So', '2', 'stars', '5', '-sigh-', 'only', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'fanservice', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', 'are', 'better', 'animes', 'out', 'there']",Kämpfer Complete Collection

1389148,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0048EAYQE,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Senou wakes up one day to find that he's become a Kampfer. Kampfers fight each other in a war with little purpose. The biggest problem is that only women can be Kampfers. So when he needs to fight he turns into a girl. Not that he was ever very masculine to begin with. To add to his troubles, Sakura, the girl he loves develops feelings for the girl version of him. His partner, Akane, is in love with him as a guy. This sounds like a troubling situation, but Senou's life get even more complicated. You'll need to watch to find out the details.I really liked this anime. It has great characters, a funny story, excellent animation, a good soundtrack, tons of action, drama, and romance. It's pretty loaded in the entertainment department. It has some heavy yuri stuff in it. Beware of that; I know lots of people don't like yuri. There is some nudity, but it's not very detailed. I think that stuff just makes it funnier. You're probably wondering why I give it 4 stars with all of that going for it. The answer is simple.I have 2 issues with this anime. I really don't like the main character. Senou is probably the least appealing hero I've seen in an anime in a long time. He's a total wuss. He doesn't have much personality either. Fortunately, the other characters are awesome. They make up for the boring vibe he puts off. My 2nd complaint with this anime is that it's not English dubbed. The Japanese cast is really good, but I hate reading subtitles. I watch anime to kick back and relax. I can't relax if I have to constantly focus on reading subtitles. You can't turn your head away for more than a few seconds or you'll lose some of the story.

For my thoughts on the show - its to bad the main charector is not so bright- or maby so unwilling to see  the other girls as a possible  relationship but that would have changed the story line. Expect  nudity and strong desires to be near Natsue when he turns into a woman.Natsue  changes from an ordinary  dense guy to  the hottest physical  looking woman in the school maby the state, ha, when he turns into a kempferLike others  have realized, its to bad the series ended so short they were supposed to make more episodes past the 12  so that the story  would be completed and they'd fight the moderators  or the red and blue would fight each other- though with everyone liking natsuru  in his hot woman body joining forces all the way to the end is to be expected. oh you get to see up to episode 14... though the last episode and other  episode  are just odd ""funny scripts""A high school guy is forced to be in a fight between the red and blue kempers..  they all where bracelets  that  are used to transform them into kempers when near  other kempers...  For the sake of fan service they concentrate on womans body appeal and  they dont always fight each other. In fact so many days  go by that the moderaters appear to try to force them into action.

That plot twist has been around for nearly 20 years in one form or another, and has been used for both dramatic and comedic effect.  Kampfer definitely plays more to the comedic side as the poor main character is another soft hearted and passive harem hero who can't stand up to anything at first.The series does have its problems.  Like just about every harem anime out there it seems 80%+ of the humor requires that the &#34;hero&#34; be unable to tell any girl how he really feels.  Misinterpreted gestures and statements are constant and sometimes require that the watcher accept that these characters just aren't very intelligent.Even with that the artwork is solid and the characters are fun and interesting even while they are acting in annoyingly mindless ways.

The main character is a young high school boy named Natsuru Sen' who for some unknown reason has been chosen to fight in a battle both with others and against female fighters called Kampfers who are given unique abilities and weapons in a unknown war but since only females can become Kampfers he is reluctantly changed to a female form when he has to fight and as time goes on can invoke the change at will.  The series will show us the hijinx Natsuru goes through as he must juggle his life between his male identity and his new female identity now,  and it becomes humorously ironic as his new female form has become the most popular new student at his school getting the attention of both the male and some female bodies vying for Natsuru's affection including his unrequited love Kaede Sakura who to has her own secret that effects Natsuru's Kampfer life.  The series does of course give us our dose of fan service but not as much as you might expect and some of the fan service scenes become quite humorous as Natsuru has to make certain his new little secret doesn't cause him more misfortune than it already has.  The series animation and music match nicely together and the voice cast picked did great in their character roles,  the series only comes subbed so there is not going to be any dubbing here on this set right now though with Section 23 releasing the set it'll probably be dubbed on a later date.  So if you're a fan of series like Sekirei or Ikki Toussen an the like or just like your standard well endowed fighting females with a dose of fan service or just looking for an enjoyable yuri-like harem series here's a great one for your collection,  but if you're an anime fan who has to have their series with dubbed audio than you're going to have to wait for awhile as this series is again only subbed at this time...",5,A Entertaining Female Fighting Gender Bending Semi-Yuri Series To Enjoy,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,2041,"['series', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'be', 'taken', 'little', 'grain', 'salt', 'story', 'again', 'entertaining', 'will', 'leave', 'open-ended', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'areas', 'main', 'character', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'named', 'Natsuru', 'Sen', 'who', 'unknown', 'reason', 'been', 'chosen', 'fight', 'battle', 'others', 'female', 'fighters', 'called', 'Kampfers', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'unique', 'abilities', 'weapons', 'unknown', 'war', 'only', 'females', 'can', 'become', 'Kampfers', 'reluctantly', 'changed', 'female', 'form', 'when', 'fight', 'time', 'can', 'invoke', 'change', 'will', 'series', 'will', 'show', 'hijinx', 'Natsuru', 'must', 'juggle', 'life', 'male', 'identity', 'new', 'female', 'identity', 'now', 'humorously', 'ironic', 'new', 'female', 'form', 'become', 'most', 'popular', 'new', 'student', 'school', 'getting', 'attention', 'male', 'female', 'bodies', 'vying', 'Natsuru', 'affection', 'including', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Kaede', 'Sakura', 'who', 'own', 'secret', 'effects', 'Natsuru', 'Kampfer', 'life', 'series', 'course', 'give', 'dose', 'fan', 'service', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'expect', 'fan', 'service', 'become', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Natsuru', 'make', 'certain', 'new', 'little', 'secret', ""n't"", 'cause', 'more', 'misfortune', 'already', 'series', 'animation', 'music', 'match', 'nicely', 'together', 'voice', 'cast', 'picked', 'did', 'great', 'character', 'roles', 'series', 'only', 'subbed', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'dubbing', 'here', 'set', 'right', 'now', 'Section', '23', 'releasing', 'set', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'dubbed', 'later', 'date', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'Sekirei', 'Ikki', 'Toussen', 'like', 'just', 'standard', 'well', 'endowed', 'fighting', 'females', 'dose', 'fan', 'service', 'just', 'looking', 'enjoyable', 'yuri-like', 'harem', 'series', 'here', 'great', 'one', 'collection', ""'re"", 'anime', 'fan', 'who', 'have', 'series', 'dubbed', 'audio', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'wait', 'awhile', 'series', 'again', 'only', 'subbed', 'time']",Kämpfer Complete Collection

Recommended 17+.After reading the product description (back of the DVD) you'd expect this to be a wild show with the focus being girls running around scantily clad the entire time.  It's not.  It is a typical harem situation with the added twist that the main male character changes into a girl to do battle with other girls.  While this plot line has been done many time before, the execution of this series is great.  The animation is high quality, and while there is no English Dub, they Japanese cast is amazing.  The main characters are voiced by a few well known people who do a great job.  The girls are not only cute, but you become generally interested in their lives and drawn into the show.There is a mild plot twist at the end that keeps things a little more interesting.  Each main character also has a stuffed animal mascot that adds to the comedic value.
