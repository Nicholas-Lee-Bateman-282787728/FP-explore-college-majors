377705,AWA88F5TOX8VL,6303491030,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[6, 7]","[GAMES - (1967) - Widescreen - directed by Curtis Harrington]  I was unfamiliar with this title, but the cast intrigued me enough to give it a stab, and I was pleased I took the plunge. James Caan and Katherine Ross play an affluent, eccentric couple who engage in peculiar activities to amuse themselves, some of which are occult based without having real ties or connections to actual dark magics.  Performed more for kicks and staged to entertain guests held at soirees at their incredibly atmospheric 60's decorated home, which is prominently featured throughout the film and which adds a distinct element of the surreal necessary to make the movie a success.Enter Simone Signoret, a tarot reader and pseudo-psychic who sells cosmetics, who engrains herself into the couple's lifestyle, and soon moves in and adds newfound mystery to an already ambiguous household. Soon enough, there is an unspoken ""Let the games begin"" aura of cat and mouse as mystery, mayhem, murder and madness become the houses' New Order. Bewitching in its execution, it's entertaining right 'till the end credits roll.Simone Signoret steals the show, Katherine Ross is fine as the frazzled housewife but, surprisingly, James Caan is the film's weak link as far as the acting goes - he's no more than adequate, and his role could have been portrayed by almost anyone else with the same conviction. True, it's an early role for him, but none of the fire of his 70's creations are displayed here. No matter, the film is still extremely entertaining as a 60's timepiece of murder mystery, and very much a by-product of 1967 sensibilities, which worked wonders for me. Oh sure, if you think hard while watching you can deduce what the probable outcome will be, but if you're content to sit back and let the amusement unfold, you're in for a treat. Enjoy the 'Games'.",4,Let The 'Games' Begin...,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,1840,"['[', 'GAMES', '1967', 'Widescreen', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Harrington', ']', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'title', 'cast', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'give', 'stab', 'was', 'pleased', 'took', 'plunge', 'James', 'Caan', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'play', 'affluent', 'eccentric', 'couple', 'who', 'engage', 'peculiar', 'activities', 'amuse', 'are', 'occult', 'based', 'having', 'real', 'ties', 'connections', 'actual', 'dark', 'magics', 'Performed', 'more', 'kicks', 'staged', 'entertain', 'guests', 'held', 'soirees', 'incredibly', '60', 'decorated', 'home', 'prominently', 'featured', 'film', 'distinct', 'element', 'surreal', 'necessary', 'make', 'movie', 'success.Enter', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'tarot', 'reader', 'pseudo-psychic', 'who', 'cosmetics', 'who', 'couple', 'lifestyle', 'soon', 'moves', 'newfound', 'mystery', 'already', 'ambiguous', 'household', 'Soon', 'enough', 'unspoken', 'Let', 'games', 'begin', 'aura', 'cat', 'mouse', 'mystery', 'mayhem', 'murder', 'madness', 'become', 'houses', 'New', 'Order', 'Bewitching', 'execution', 'entertaining', 'right', 'end', 'roll.Simone', 'Signoret', 'show', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'fine', 'frazzled', 'housewife', 'surprisingly', 'James', 'Caan', 'film', 'weak', 'link', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'more', 'adequate', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'anyone', 'else', 'same', 'conviction', 'True', 'early', 'role', 'none', 'fire', '70', 'creations', 'are', 'displayed', 'here', 'matter', 'film', 'still', 'extremely', 'entertaining', '60', 'timepiece', 'murder', 'mystery', 'very', 'much', 'by-product', '1967', 'sensibilities', 'worked', 'wonders', 'Oh', 'sure', 'think', 'hard', 'watching', 'can', 'deduce', 'what', 'probable', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', ""'re"", 'content', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'amusement', 'unfold', ""'re"", 'treat', 'Enjoy', ""'Games""]",Games VHS

I really liked the film until about half way through, when I realized that this was just an American take-off of the great French thriller, ""Diabolique.""  It was because this became so obvious by the half-way mark - the film was ruined for me as the outcome was so clear.  Oh, they threw in one last surprise - but it was really a let down (and a bad attempt to fool us ""Diabolique"" fans.)  So, if you've seen ""Diabolique,"" don't bother unless you want to see how to rework a film not for the better.  And, for Heaven's sake, don't even think of watching the American remake of ""Diabolique,"" as it is truely horrible.  If you haven't seen ""Diabolique,"" then go ahead and watch ""Games.""  But I would really suggest getting the Criterion ""Diaboloque"" and settling down to a real classic thriller.

Katherine tells her she can stay at the house until she is well. Simone tells the couple that while they enjoy games, she suggests that they play more macabre games, those that could end up with death. They agree. The initial games involve an apparent shooting, a deceptive beating by the husband of his wife, and a seeming scene of adultery where the surprised husband almost kills the adulterer. The husband then suggests that they play a trick on the man who took part in the apparent adultery. But it goes wrong. While there were supposed to be blanks in the gun, there were real bullets and the man is killed. The husband tells his wife that they need to cover up the murder.

377713,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303491030,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[13, 23]","This is a Hitchcockian suspense film. How can a social climber who marries a rich heiress get rid of her to seize her fortune ? He uses the services of a professional killer, in this case a woman, Mrs Schindler, a German woman. Simone Signoret is a marvelous professional killer. The wife is made crazy, little by little, with the help of a delivery boy who likes playing games. This boy, this accessory to the final crime, is in fact turned into a haunting ghost taunting the woman into a crazy killing reaction. The boy thinks he is playing a trick on her and that the bullets will be blanks, but they are no blanks and he is killed, assassinated. The woman is thus captured by the police and the husband gets his hands on her fortune. He sells at once all he can sell in order to go to foreign countries and live on his prize. But his professional accomplice is a professional killer and thus she has the last word and captures the spoils of the action. The details are in the film. Simone Signoret is marvelous, even if she has a French accent, rather than a German accent. She is of course an allusion, nowadays, to another film due to her name. Mrs Schindler. But she does not save lives. She executes people in order to get a profit out of it. If you want to kill your wife, never get in touch with professionals because you are an amateur and amateurs are always the victims of professionals. And never drink anything presented to you by your professional accomplices. As for the plot, it is very imaginative and creative. Hitchcock himself could not have done better.
