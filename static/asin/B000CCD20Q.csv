956665,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000CCD20Q,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[299, 303]","I first saw this film when it came out and was surprised, if not shocked, that a film could be made about the importance of culture (to everyone; but in particular to Native Americans) and the attempts of tribes to locate children ""stolen"" from their homes and ""repatriate"" them back into their families and communities.  In 1976, a US Congressional report found that one out of two (50%) Native American children were either adopted into, or placed in the ""foster"" care of, Non-Native American families.  This ""process"" was, additionally, causing problems for many Reservation/Reserve communities, because as these children became of age they were aimlessly searching for their ""real"" families.  In 1978, the ""Indian Child Welfare Act"" was approved by Congress in an attempt to stem the problems.  However, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was basically opposed to the law and failed to adequately enforce the law.  None-the-less, by the late 1980s many tribes were actively seeking ways to help these children through actions that have come to be called ""repatriation"": re-uniting children with family members on the reservation/reserve and attempting to teach them of their traditional culture.  This process also derived from the desire to help so called ""problem"" children; children that were unwanted and who hated themselves, and were often in trouble.The Canadian government, seemingly slower at doing things, actually worked out a system that was somewhat more proactive in the ""repatriation"" process.  ""Spirit Rider,"" then, is a Canadian made for television movie, that depicts these efforts on one of the Ojibwa (Chippewa here in the US) reserves in Manitoba to help tribal members.Given the budget, the topic, and the reality of made for television movies, ""Spirit Rider"" is a bold, beautiful film, deserving of far greater recognition than it has received--regardless of one's political position on ""repatriation.""  Yes, there are some generalizations that are injected into the story, but they do not overwhelm the viewer.  My sole problem with the film is that it (the DVD in particular) relies upon the subsequent careers of Graham Greene and Adam Beach by advertising them as the stars of the film.  The true stars of the film are: 1) Michelle St. John, who plays Camilla St. Claire, a young Ojibwa girl raised on the Reserve that wishes to help Jesse ""repatriate""; 2) Herbie Barnes, who plays the central character, Jesse Three Bears, a young boy raised in foster homes and who wants nothing to do with the Reserve or ""repatriation;"" 3) Tom Jackson, who plays Albert St. Clair, Camilla's father, a pragmatic man attempting to run the local store, while being supportive of his ""traditional culture;"" 4) Tantoo Cardinal, who plays Marilyn St.Claire, Camilla's mother, a school teacher, and local repatriation project coordinator; and 5) Gordon Tootoosis, portraying Joe Moon, Jesse's grandfather who has been in prison and had problems with drinking, but was raised in Ojibwa cultural traditions (including speaking Ojibwa as his first language, and is now seen as a resource of cultural knowledge).Please do not take this to be a diminishing of Greene's and Beach's performances--they are wonderful--but an acknowledgment that they are not the ""stars"" of the movie.This is a wonderful movie for everyone, and I highly recommend it.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

The grandfather who is taking on his very alienated grandson (Barnes as Jesse) who resents being plucked from Winnipeg and plopped down on the reservation was played (well) by Gordon Tootoosis).The adults are tactful and try to still the angry hearts of Paul and Jesse, while teaching respect for horses, elders, work, and the land.  Although the ending is pat and predictable, the actors made this an enjoyable as well as an unplifting movie.
