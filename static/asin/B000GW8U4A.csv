Since which time there have been several American versions, none of which compare to the original. The show tends to be bleak and US viewers may find it a tad slow going, but the acting is first rate, especially from Sue Johnston from the 80's Channel 4 soap 'Brookside'. Trevor Eve does what he always does...ie. look very sombre, serious and worried all the time. Since his first series on British TV ""Shoestring' over 20 years ago, he continues to act the only way he is able...very one dimensional !

The protagonists must be into slaughter, rape, violence, and murder in abundance.  I am not.  This series might as well be a product of American network television, for all of its cruelty and political correctness.Moreover, Acorn has added a new twist to its films: the lengthy introductory commercial that cannot be sped up or sped past.  You just have to sit there and endure it.  Moreover, when the commercial concludes, at last, you are presented with choices, depending on what you want to see on the disc and how you want to see it.  I spotted ""subtitles on"" and tried to change it.  It can't be done, and when you fail you have to go back to the beginning of the disc and re-endure the commercial.  After three tries, I simply clicked on ""Play all"" and the program commenced--without subtitles.  Maddening.  If this is a trend then I shall go elsewhere for DVDs.  As for Waking the Dead, expensive as it was, it goes into the wastebasket.

I have seen a great many more crime shows since this show from both the UK and USA.  What sets this show apart is that a lot of it has been borrowed, especially by USA crime shows.  What the USA shows do is increase the sentimentality and sappy elements while decreasing the gritty and real elements.  UK crime shows don't do this and this one certainly didn't.To compare this to CSI verges on the laughable.  This show does not glamorize forensics or cold case work. It does not play loud rock music over good looking people doing forensics testing in futuristic labs. Instead, it is a very gritty depiction of the detectives and forensic specialists trying to solve grisly cases which have remained unsolved. So this was a genuinely ground breaking show.The team also has a psychologist on board and she is probably the best character of all and the least glamorous.  In fact, she is middle aged.  Also, the overall boss can be a real egomaniac and over controlling, which is the unpleasant reality of many people in positions of power. His temper flares out at all of his employees and he wants everything done yesterday.  He's very good at what he does though and keeps everyone on target.  So, like in all jobs, that is why his employers keep him running this department.If you are getting tired of crime shows or forensic shows which seem to only resemble the real world in passing, try this series out instead.",5,Watching for the Second Time,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,1487,"['watched', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'am', 'now', 'watching', 'series', 'again', 'have', 'seen', 'great', 'many', 'more', 'crime', 'shows', 'show', 'UK', 'USA', 'What', 'show', 'apart', 'lot', 'been', 'borrowed', 'especially', 'USA', 'crime', 'shows', 'What', 'USA', 'shows', 'do', 'increase', 'sentimentality', 'sappy', 'elements', 'decreasing', 'gritty', 'real', 'elements', 'UK', 'crime', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'certainly', 'compare', 'CSI', 'verges', 'laughable', 'show', 'not', 'glamorize', 'forensics', 'cold', 'case', 'work', 'not', 'play', 'loud', 'rock', 'music', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'doing', 'forensics', 'testing', 'futuristic', 'labs', 'Instead', 'very', 'gritty', 'depiction', 'detectives', 'forensic', 'specialists', 'trying', 'solve', 'grisly', 'cases', 'have', 'remained', 'unsolved', 'was', 'genuinely', 'ground', 'breaking', 'show.The', 'team', 'also', 'psychologist', 'board', 'probably', 'best', 'character', 'least', 'glamorous', 'fact', 'middle', 'aged', 'Also', 'overall', 'boss', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'egomaniac', 'controlling', 'unpleasant', 'reality', 'many', 'people', 'positions', 'power', 'temper', 'out', 'employees', 'everything', 'done', 'yesterday', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'keeps', 'everyone', 'target', 'So', 'jobs', 'why', 'employers', 'keep', 'running', 'department.If', 'are', 'getting', 'tired', 'crime', 'shows', 'forensic', 'shows', 'seem', 'only', 'resemble', 'real', 'world', 'passing', 'try', 'series', 'out', 'instead']",N/A

The reason I say honest is because the writers do not hide any clues from the viewers, so we have as much chance to solve it as the team does. I appreciated that, but as a result, in almost all episodes I guessed who the killer was about half way thru the program. I watched a fair a number of detective and mystery shows and this doesn't happen to me very often.Another reason I call the show honest is because the characters are real; they are hard working and decent, a little dull and not especially good looking, sexy or charismatic, like similar team members in the more glitzy American shows. The 5 team members also argue with each other quite often, which is to be expected in this type of highly stressful job. They also have many moments of gratitude and camaraderie towards each other, which is nice.The stories are interesting and the acting is very good, so over all definitely worth watching.I have a different opinion starting season 3 and I posted it where it belongs.",4,"Honest police detective show, but with predictible endings",1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,1054,"['show', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'good', 'honest', 'police', 'detective', 'drama', 'reason', 'say', 'honest', 'writers', 'do', 'not', 'hide', 'clues', 'viewers', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'chance', 'solve', 'team', 'appreciated', 'result', 'almost', 'episodes', 'guessed', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'half', 'way', 'program', 'watched', 'fair', 'number', 'detective', 'mystery', 'shows', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'reason', 'call', 'show', 'honest', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'hard', 'working', 'decent', 'little', 'dull', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'looking', 'sexy', 'charismatic', 'similar', 'team', 'members', 'more', 'glitzy', 'American', 'shows', '5', 'team', 'members', 'also', 'argue', 'other', 'quite', 'often', 'be', 'expected', 'type', 'highly', 'stressful', 'job', 'also', 'have', 'many', 'moments', 'gratitude', 'camaraderie', 'towards', 'other', 'nice.The', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'starting', 'season', '3', 'posted', 'where']",N/A

This Season One of BBC's ""Waking the Dead"" (with the 2 part pilot of the series) certainly satisfies the last item on the aforesaid list.The ""Waking the Dead"" detective series is new to me.  However, I am very glad that I have added the series to my British ""Detective/mystery"" collection because I really completely enjoyed Season One.  It's always so good for me to ""discover"" a new program of something that I adore. Based on this season, the series is so well acted and directed.I have always enjoyed Trevor Eve (Heat of the Sun, David Copperfield etc.).  In this series, Trevor plays a tough, no-nonsense, barking orders leader of a Cold Case Unit that solves cases that have been given up as ""unsolvable"".  The unit consists of a group of ""experts"" in their particular field such as psychology or pathology.  What I really like is that this Unit does not always operate in a unified manner with each ""expert"" being very sure of their solution to the case at hand. The leader (played by Trevor) has to, of course, ""step in"" and solve the differences which he does and sometimes not too nicely.  Yes, there can be some rather intense fights between some members of the unit.  I really enjoyed watching these ""battles"".If you enjoy a good Detective/Mystery buy this three disc 567 minute set.

1007749,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000GW8U4A,Stephanie De Pue,"[6, 6]","Waking the Dead: Season 1, (2000).  This is a British mystery/police procedural television series made by and for the BBC (British Broadcasting Company).  To the best of my knowledge, it has only been seen here on BBCAmerica: at least that's where I saw it, some years ago.  But it stuck in my memory, as it just might in yours.  The series is set in contemporary times, and may be considered a British, slower-moving version of the American CSI.  It follows the cold case unit, police investigators who use modern techniques to solve old murder cases, and has won international Emmys. The unit, led by DSI (Detective Supervising Inspector) Peter Boyd (Trevor Eve), includes cops, a scientist, and a psychologist/profiler, who do their best to combine forensics, psychology and old-fashioned police work. It was created by Barbara Machin, as, apparently, an original concept, and in fact, shows a strong female influence at the helm throughout. This set consists of three disks, running approximately 567 minutes, and has good subtitles.Eve, a somber, gripping and intense presence, (Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings),Masterpiece Contemporary: Framed) is ably supported by Sue Johnston (The Royle Family - The Complete First Season) as Grace Foley, psychologist/profiler, and they play off each other well.  In fact, they play off each other so well that Holly Aird, playing the unit's forensics expert Frankie Wharton, who was originally given second billing behind Eve on the pilot episode, is dropped to third billing when the series proper begins.  (Boyd also is seen with a family in the pilot, which he loses by the first episode, apparently in accordance with the unwritten rule of British TV mystery series, that the detective may have no family.) The show, although slow-moving by American standards, is intense and suspenseful, with some onscreen violence, and probably not for shrinking violets.  And it is refreshing to see investigations headed by middle-aged, no longer perfect-looking people, as they are in real life. Strong supporting players are many, including Annette Crosbie, equally skilled at comic and dramatic roles (One Foot in the Grave: The Complete Series,Edward the King), and Anthony Valentine (Raffles: Complete Collection).  Also Amelia Warner, John Vine, Peter Gallagher, Clive Russell.The episodes, built around four unsolved crimes that have lain dormant for years, are:The Pilot. Concerns the abduction and murder of Alice Miller, a young girl who disappeared five years ago. The team inadvertently triggers the killer, who apparently holds a grudge against Boyd, to strike again in exactly the same manner as before: this time he kidnaps and holds the teenage Jodie Whitemore.  Boyd fights to get the current, urgent case for the Cold Team, which then finds they are struggling to solve past and present crimes at the same time.""Burnout.""  The suspicious death of a celebrated war photographer in a car accident haunts the photographer's daughter: in fact, she thinks she has recently actually been haunted by her father.  Was the lensman's death suicide, an accident, or murder?  In the meantime, her mother has moved on, and now lives with the photographer's brother.""Blind Beggar.""  A body is found, buried for twenty years, under the concrete in St. Joseph's basement crypt: the local Catholic community is deeply shaken.  Annette Crosbie, as Moira Bowen, wife of a local contractor, dominates the screen in this one.""A Simple Sacrifice.""  Annie Keel is a beautiful woman who has already spent 25 years in jail for a double murder, that of her husband and a friend of her son's, to which she had confessed.  But an anonymous source has recently come to light, who was apparently in the house that night, and has forensic proof of it.  This tipster insists Annie is innocent of the crimes, and points the finger at her surviving, long-estranged son.""Every Breath You Take."" The body of Debbie Britten, celebrated as a police hero, is found in the Thames River.  She is found to have been pregnant.  Was her killer one of her several stalkers, her estranged husband, or the unknown father of the unborn daughter?A minor caveat: the two parts of ""A Simple Sacrifice"" appear on two different disks.  This was slightly annoying, but the series is of such high quality it kept me riveted on the sofa.

1007751,A29XI8QYHVHM7B,B000GW8U4A,TC,"[3, 3]","If you are into ""CSI"" types of shows and have not seen this, you are truly missing out.  This British series combines excellent acting with fast paced action sequences and extensive crime scene sciences.  Unlike the American shows, Waking the Dead employs extensive use of DNA evidence and other crime scene evidence to develop the storyline and the interaction among the characters.  The characters are sharply drawn and form a cohesive team in solving cold cases.  The team's leader, Boyd, is impatient, brilliant, emotional and a task master.  The way he cajoles, yells and connects the evidence to lead the team to solving the evidence is very entertaining and would make an excellent management case study - how to effectively work for a boss who is both exhilarating and breath-takingly scary in an almost unbearably stressful situations.  The other members of the team are just as dedicated and smart in solving the case, although less vociferous and provide a nice counterbalance to Boyd's almost manic approach.  Even the bad guy perpetrators are multi-dimensional and fleshed out.  The series pretty much sticks to the crime solving at hand and does not muddy the plot with extraneous time fillers, to which is the American series often resort to try to cover up the lack of plotline, storyline, character development, etc.  I did have some difficulty in understanding the British accent, especially when they were speaking fast; however, if you turn the subtitles on, it is fine.  Unfortunately, after couple of the original cast members dropped off in season 4, it just wasn't the same and I stopped watching it.",5,"Very best in the ""CSI"" genre",1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,1624,"['are', 'CSI', 'types', 'shows', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'are', 'truly', 'missing', 'out', 'British', 'series', 'combines', 'excellent', 'acting', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'sequences', 'extensive', 'crime', 'scene', 'sciences', 'American', 'shows', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'extensive', 'use', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'other', 'crime', 'scene', 'evidence', 'develop', 'storyline', 'interaction', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'form', 'cohesive', 'team', 'solving', 'cold', 'cases', 'team', 'leader', 'Boyd', 'impatient', 'brilliant', 'emotional', 'task', 'master', 'way', 'yells', 'evidence', 'lead', 'team', 'solving', 'evidence', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'management', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'effectively', 'work', 'boss', 'who', 'exhilarating', 'breath-takingly', 'scary', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'stressful', 'situations', 'other', 'members', 'team', 'are', 'just', 'dedicated', 'smart', 'solving', 'case', 'less', 'vociferous', 'provide', 'nice', 'counterbalance', 'Boyd', 'almost', 'manic', 'approach', 'Even', 'bad', 'guy', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'multi-dimensional', 'fleshed', 'out', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'sticks', 'crime', 'solving', 'hand', 'not', 'muddy', 'plot', 'extraneous', 'time', 'fillers', 'American', 'series', 'often', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'lack', 'plotline', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'etc', 'did', 'have', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'British', 'accent', 'especially', 'when', 'were', 'speaking', 'fast', 'however', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'fine', 'Unfortunately', 'couple', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'dropped', 'off', 'season', '4', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'stopped', 'watching']",N/A
