573234,A2IK9YLARCZ9YG,B000059HAZ,Bud Sturguess,"[21, 32]","This fifteen minute homemade film of former Pink Floyd songwriter (1965-68) Syd Barrett taking mushrooms and other drugs is absolutely degrading. Instead of remembering Syd as a brilliant songwriter and musician, it instead elevates his reputation as a reclusive drug addict. Syd was once a bright musician, with a lot of great ideas, and a brilliancy when it came to songwriting. But sadly he turned to drugs, and it severely damaged his mental health. Barrett has even made it clear through relatives and ""representatives"" that he does not want this part of his past flaunted by anyone or any company, and for good reason. This ""document"" is an insult to Roger Keith Barrett, the person. Drug addiction is a sad thing, but exploiting it on camera and releasing it to the public for their viewing pleasure is absolutely degrading.",1,"Does Nothing To Remember Syd Barrett, The Musician",1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,831,"['fifteen', 'minute', 'homemade', 'film', 'former', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'songwriter', '1965-68', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'taking', 'mushrooms', 'other', 'drugs', 'absolutely', 'degrading', 'Instead', 'remembering', 'Syd', 'brilliant', 'songwriter', 'musician', 'instead', 'reputation', 'reclusive', 'drug', 'addict', 'Syd', 'was', 'once', 'bright', 'musician', 'lot', 'great', 'ideas', 'brilliancy', 'when', 'came', 'songwriting', 'sadly', 'turned', 'drugs', 'severely', 'damaged', 'mental', 'health', 'Barrett', 'even', 'made', 'clear', 'relatives', 'representatives', 'not', 'want', 'part', 'past', 'flaunted', 'anyone', 'company', 'good', 'reason', 'document', 'insult', 'Roger', 'Keith', 'Barrett', 'person', 'Drug', 'addiction', 'sad', 'thing', 'exploiting', 'camera', 'releasing', 'public', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'absolutely', 'degrading']",Syd Barrett's First Trip Limited Edition

This somehow actually &quot;shows&quot; the way it looked in an authentic shot into the world that Syd is traveling. Even though you're only getting to see it outwardly, it's paranormal. Looking at Syd and the transformation that takes place after the campfire trip when he is back in town, really shows how he was altered. When you see him in his Floyd attire later he looks, superhuman. Indeed, this movie captures the supernatural quality of what was going on there and during that time.

I have not and I absolutely refuse to do so on principle.  It is extremely unfortunate that someone feels the need to make money off of the &quot;legend&quot; of Mr. Barrett's troubles.  This myth is only a problem for him--it's what brings people uninvited to his doorstep, dragging up the memories of a life he no longer wishes to live.A TRUE Pink Floyd fan RESPECTS all members of the band.  With that respect comes the responsibility not to make a soap opera out of their lives or to exploit them.  With Mr. Barrett this is all the more important given his withdrawal from the public life.  As I have said elsewhere, Mr. Barrett's story is a reminder that simply because someone gets the opportunity for stardom, he does not suddenly cease to be just like any of us. And I believe that none of us, going about our everyday lives, would appreciate such unwanted intrusions. Even Mr. Barrett's recent decision to autograph a photo book about his past should not, I believe, be taken as an invitation of any kind to his fans--those days are done, and his true fans know and respect it.DO NOT waste your money on this--do not encourage the disgusting bottom-feeders who have no respect for Mr. Barrett as a human being.",1,Exploitative garbage--Avoid if you respect Syd Barrett!,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,1333,"['absolutely', 'reason', 'why', 'self-respecting', 'band-respecting', 'Floyd', 'fan', 'should', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'absolutely', 'refuse', 'do', 'so', 'principle', 'extremely', 'unfortunate', 'someone', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Barrett', 'troubles', 'myth', 'only', 'problem', 'what', 'people', 'uninvited', 'doorstep', 'dragging', 'up', 'memories', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'wishes', 'live.A', 'TRUE', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'fan', 'RESPECTS', 'members', 'band', 'respect', 'responsibility', 'not', 'make', 'soap', 'opera', 'lives', 'exploit', 'Mr.', 'Barrett', 'more', 'important', 'given', 'withdrawal', 'public', 'life', 'have', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'Mr.', 'Barrett', 'story', 'reminder', 'simply', 'someone', 'opportunity', 'stardom', 'not', 'suddenly', 'cease', 'be', 'just', 'believe', 'none', 'going', 'everyday', 'lives', 'would', 'appreciate', 'such', 'unwanted', 'intrusions', 'Even', 'Mr.', 'Barrett', 'recent', 'decision', 'autograph', 'photo', 'book', 'past', 'should', 'not', 'believe', 'be', 'taken', 'invitation', 'kind', 'fans', 'days', 'are', 'done', 'true', 'fans', 'know', 'respect', 'it.DO', 'NOT', 'waste', 'money', 'do', 'not', 'encourage', 'disgusting', 'bottom-feeders', 'who', 'have', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Barrett', 'human', 'being']",Syd Barrett's First Trip Limited Edition

573239,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000059HAZ,Reviewer,"[42, 57]","If the names Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Dave Mason elicit a response of ""Who?"" from you, chances are you should pass on this film, which, quite frankly, is for die-hard Pink Floyd fans only.  If you do fall within that category, however, you will probably view ""Syd Barrett's First Trip"" as a chronicle of minor historical significance, as it is a brief visual documentary of the day that changed Barrett's world forever, and consequently the future of Pink Floyd.The entire film runs a total of (approximately) 15 minutes, and is presented in two segments, the first of which takes place in the late summer of 1966, at a place called Gog Magog Hills.  It was (according to all accounts) the very first time Syd ""tripped out"" on mushrooms, and friend/film student Nigel Gordon was on hand, recording it all on silent, 8MM film.  Gordon was also there in April of 1967, outside Abbey Road Studios, on the day the Floyd signed their first recording contract with EMI Records, which comprises the second segment of the film.  There are glimpses of Waters, Wright and Mason, but Gordon's camera was mainly focused on Barrett, whose state of mind at the time certainly seems open to conjecture.  Very soon, of course, his situation would be beyond conjecture, as even before their first album was released a steady diet of LSD would take him to a place from which he would never return.A soundtrack recorded by the Hypnotic Records group ""Dilate"" has been added to this film, effectively creating an appropriately ethereal atmosphere that evokes a surreal sense of timelessness as the seemingly innocent events captured here by Gordon unfold.Some may argue that, in light of the fact that this was the beginning of the end for Barrett, this film is too personal to share with the world.  There's no denying it has something of a ""tabloid"" feel to it, and without question, the significance of it is, historically, in an entirely different context than, say, the Zapruder film.  But in the final analysis, ""Syd Barrett's First Trip"" is neither invasive, nor is it in any way an inditement, or-- at the other end of the spectrum-- an affirmation of his life.  In it's brevity, it's merely a glimpse; a quick look at a moment-- now frozen in time-- that marked the point of no return in a young man's life.  Syd Barrett was an artist, who very soon after this film was made, would be unable to create anything ever again.  One could say that the moment captured here was, in effect, the very instant that the music-- so alive within Syd Barrett-- died.  To their credit, Waters, Wright and Mason-- Pink Floyd-- endured and, thankfully, continued on; tragically, Syd Barrett did not.  And watching this film one can but reflect upon how truly fragile life is, and how quickly time moves on.  After all, what you see in this film really happened; and moreover, it was only yesterday that it did.",5,Captures the Beginning of the End for Syd Barrett,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,2904,"['names', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'Richard', 'Wright', 'Dave', 'Mason', 'elicit', 'response', 'Who', 'chances', 'are', 'should', 'pass', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'die-hard', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'only', 'do', 'fall', 'category', 'however', 'will', 'probably', 'view', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'First', 'Trip', 'chronicle', 'minor', 'historical', 'significance', 'brief', 'visual', 'documentary', 'day', 'changed', 'Barrett', 'world', 'forever', 'consequently', 'future', 'Pink', 'Floyd.The', 'entire', 'film', 'total', 'approximately', '15', 'minutes', 'presented', 'two', 'segments', 'first', 'place', 'late', 'summer', '1966', 'place', 'called', 'Gog', 'Magog', 'Hills', 'was', 'according', 'accounts', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Syd', 'tripped', 'out', 'mushrooms', 'friend/film', 'student', 'Nigel', 'Gordon', 'was', 'hand', 'recording', 'silent', '8MM', 'film', 'Gordon', 'was', 'also', 'there', 'April', '1967', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'Studios', 'day', 'Floyd', 'signed', 'first', 'recording', 'contract', 'EMI', 'Records', 'second', 'segment', 'film', 'are', 'glimpses', 'Waters', 'Wright', 'Mason', 'Gordon', 'camera', 'was', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Barrett', 'state', 'mind', 'time', 'certainly', 'open', 'conjecture', 'Very', 'soon', 'course', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'conjecture', 'even', 'first', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'steady', 'diet', 'LSD', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'would', 'never', 'return.A', 'soundtrack', 'recorded', 'Hypnotic', 'Records', 'group', 'Dilate', 'been', 'added', 'film', 'effectively', 'creating', 'appropriately', 'ethereal', 'atmosphere', 'surreal', 'sense', 'timelessness', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'events', 'captured', 'here', 'Gordon', 'unfold.Some', 'may', 'argue', 'light', 'fact', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'Barrett', 'film', 'too', 'personal', 'share', 'world', 'denying', 'something', 'tabloid', 'feel', 'question', 'significance', 'historically', 'entirely', 'different', 'context', 'say', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'final', 'analysis', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'First', 'Trip', 'invasive', 'way', 'inditement', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'affirmation', 'life', 'brevity', 'merely', 'glimpse', 'quick', 'look', 'moment', 'now', 'frozen', 'time', 'marked', 'point', 'return', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'was', 'artist', 'who', 'very', 'soon', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'create', 'anything', 'ever', 'again', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'moment', 'captured', 'here', 'was', 'effect', 'very', 'instant', 'music', 'so', 'alive', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'died', 'credit', 'Waters', 'Wright', 'Mason', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'endured', 'thankfully', 'continued', 'tragically', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'did', 'not', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'reflect', 'how', 'truly', 'fragile', 'life', 'how', 'quickly', 'time', 'moves', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'really', 'happened', 'moreover', 'was', 'only', 'yesterday', 'did']",Syd Barrett's First Trip Limited Edition
