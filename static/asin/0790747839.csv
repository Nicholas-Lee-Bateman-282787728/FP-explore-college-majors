It doesn't have a story line at all. It is about as deep as a normal family's vacation video because that's pretty much what is. Two spoiled little girls run around Paris for week and meet two French boys. Sound interesting? It isn't. The French boys are the only characters that make this movie worthy of one star. The script does try to squeeze some humor into the movie and doesn't do very well. All the humor apart from the French boys' bad English is very childish. The movie even ends with the most stupid climax I have ever seen which involves a &quot;clean water treaty&quot; (the girls' grandpa is the U.S. ambassador to France.). The Olsen were probably more interested in the trip to Paris than making a quality film when they payed for it themselves. If you're a fan of the twins, you'll probably like this movie, but if you want a great movie that you're kids will always love, look elsewhere. How this movie actually made the top selling videos chart is beyond me. Even the price is horrible.

Mary Kate and Ashley play twin seventh graders whose interests seem limited to boys and shopping malls. In order to broaden their outlook, their parents send them to Paris to spend a week with their grandfather, the U.S. ambassador. He is a strict gentleman who assigns the girls an itinerary of sights to see and a stiff chaperone named Jeremy, whom the girls delight in tormenting. Soon they manage to elude their chaperone and have fun on their own, zooming around Paris on mopeds to rock music with two dishy French boys. In the end the girls' carefree attitude manages to have a positive transformative effect on both their grandfather and Jeremy, as well as on members of the ambassador's household such as the snobby, stereotypical chef.

Unfortunately, grandpa, the U.S. Ambassador to Paris, is too busy to spend time with the girls so they are babysat by one of his staff members.  Hilarity ensues as the girls sample French culture (namely the odd food) and cause their chaperone all types of headaches.  Along their adventures the girls befriend a famous French supermodel, bring American culture to the embassy, teach their chaperone some important life lessons and of course, meet some cute French boys!!!THE ANALYSIS:While a lot of the dialogue is VERY (pre)-teenish, (jinx anyone???) the story itself is very nicely done.  Forgiving some of the antics (given the target audience of the film it's actually perfectly acceptable and in fact probably expected) the movie is just another nicely done story for the pre-teen/teen girl crowd and families.  The Olsen's deliver another solidly entertaining story, fun, adventurous and with a moral about standing up for one's self (and the environment) to boat!!!THE DVD FEATURES:Like most of their releases on DVD the Olsen's have packed on the standard mini-feature and DOZENS of plugs for their franchise.  Here's what you get:1. Cast and Crew Info:  Listing of the main cast and crew.2. ""Fashion Close-Up"" - Nice 4 minute featurette detailing the various outfits the girls wore during various scenes in the movie and why they were chosen3. ""Mary-Kate and Ashley Video Highlights"" - Extensive filmography off ALL the films done by the girls to date (2001 when this video was released on DVD).4. ""Mary-Kate and Ashley Video Collection Trailer"" - The standard video trailer highlighting the girls' various video franchises.THE VERDICT:In all, overselling in the DVD features aside, the movie was great for a family viewing on the weekend.  Olsen fans should love this first installment in their ever-growing ""world tour"" video franchise series and parents should be pleased with another clean, quality product from America's favorite twins.

They don't take anything all that seriously, and all they ever do is talk on the phone with their friends, hang out at the mall, and go shopping. What else can you expect from two 13-year-old girls? Their parents think the girls need to know that there's more to life than what they think, so on spring break, the girls' parents send them to visit their stern grandfather in Paris, who just happens to be the US Ambassador to France. Mel and Ally think their lives are over because they were just asked to the Spring Fling Dance by the two most popular, cutest guys at their junior high school, which happens during their spring break. So while in Paris, the girls try to make the best of it--especially after they meet two cute French boys about their age--and end up having the time of their lives in Paris! During their trip to Paris, they also befriend Jeremy, the man who's supposed to take them everywhere and always be with them and they even befriend a French supermodel!PASSPORT TO PARIS is a fun flick to watch with your friends. The acting is quite good by the entire cast, when the cast speaks in French, it doesn't seem fake, and the plot is good. Plus, the scenary is absolutely gorgeous, particularly because the movie was actually filmed in France. And even the two French boys aren't that bad looking--especially the one who can only speak French. I also liked the way that the Oslen twins themselves produced this movie besides just acting in it. Highly recommended for all Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen twins fans!NOTE: Some parts are kind of unrealistic, but then again it's a movie.",5,An Olsen fan pleaser,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,1871,"['Even', ""'m"", 'lot', 'older', 'Olsen', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'time', 'time', 'PASSPORT', 'TO', 'PARIS', 'meet', 'Melanie', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'Allison', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'Porter', 'who', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'made', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'seriously', 'ever', 'do', 'talk', 'phone', 'friends', 'hang', 'out', 'mall', 'go', 'shopping', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'expect', 'two', '13-year-old', 'girls', 'parents', 'think', 'girls', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'think', 'so', 'spring', 'break', 'girls', 'parents', 'send', 'visit', 'stern', 'grandfather', 'Paris', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'US', 'Ambassador', 'France', 'Mel', 'Ally', 'think', 'lives', 'are', 'were', 'just', 'asked', 'Spring', 'Fling', 'Dance', 'two', 'most', 'popular', 'cutest', 'guys', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'spring', 'break', 'So', 'Paris', 'girls', 'try', 'make', 'best', 'especially', 'meet', 'two', 'cute', 'French', 'boys', 'age', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'Paris', 'trip', 'Paris', 'also', 'befriend', 'Jeremy', 'man', 'who', 'supposed', 'take', 'everywhere', 'always', 'be', 'even', 'befriend', 'French', 'supermodel', 'PASSPORT', 'TO', 'PARIS', 'fun', 'flick', 'watch', 'friends', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'entire', 'cast', 'when', 'cast', 'speaks', 'French', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fake', 'plot', 'good', 'scenary', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'particularly', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'France', 'even', 'two', 'French', 'boys', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'looking', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'French', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Oslen', 'produced', 'movie', 'just', 'acting', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'fans', 'NOTE', 'parts', 'are', 'kind', 'unrealistic', 'then', 'again', 'movie']",N/A
