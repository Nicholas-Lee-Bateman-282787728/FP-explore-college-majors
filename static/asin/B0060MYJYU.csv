1506509,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B0060MYJYU,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","I am deliberately making this review much different in style to all my other reviews - call it a &#34;consumer review&#34; if you want.First my &#34;bullet points&#34;:#1: yes, it is DVD-R. Unfortunately, this *is* considered a standard manufacturing practice. It is 100% legit, even if it does look really cheap to do so. Are the Fox guys cheapskates to do this with a paltry 2-disc set? Yes, but they're not the first ones to do it. A variety of PBS shows do this (&#34;Equitrekking&#34; among others), as do a great many instructional videos. Should they have lowered the MSRP to reflect this (especially for a season that has only 9 episodes)? Quite so, yes. On the other hand, think about how many people flocked to pay $20 a few years ago for &#34;Blue Harvest,&#34; which is about 45 minutes and has been shown in reruns many times for FREE on TV; I would still call that a worse moneygrub than this set.#2: Despite being DVD-R format, mine play just fine. I don't actually care if they're HD or not because a) I don't have a high-end TV, and b) I don't care about such things anyway when it comes to CARTOON shows. I couldn't tell you if the definition or sound is bad...because to me, both seem pretty normal. I didn't notice any weird graininess/pixel/frame rate problems. The sound seemed fine - no voice distortions (a real feat considering how much Louise screams!), no pitch issues, etc. Yes, it's possible that set to set varies in quality. If yours have that much trouble playing, they do have a refund policy around here.#3: these discs don't have &#34;cheap stickers&#34; on them, as someone noted. No stickers at all. They merely have very basic graphics printed on the topside. This was another budget-cutting move.#4: my discs came mint. If anyone orders this as a new set and sees that much damage, I say again that they DO have a return policy.Yes, it is disappointing that they did what they did with this set. I was so conflicted about the whole thing that I bought mine &#34;slightly used&#34; on a different site so that the manufacturer would not directly get a cut of my money. It's a tough decision when it comes down to having a less-than-orthodox DVD format versus a digital download, but I'm just not a downloading type. Downloading still feels like more of a rip-off to me than buying a DVD set made on a tiny budget.I have no major complaints about the show itself, though it seemed to get slightly crasser and less zany in season 2. This series was lauded by some as being the successor to &#34;King of the Hill.&#34; I say NO it is not, although it is still much gentler and more approachable than &#34;Family Guy&#34; or similar fare. The characters are somewhat original and make a good mix of contrast - maybe this is why some very ordinary situations can turn into such complicated affairs. The quirkiness and often clever dialogue (example: Gene excitedly shouts &#34;They'll finger anything with a pulse!&#34; when he sees a TV station van parked across the street) make up for sometimes odd animation techniques. One way this show IS similar to &#34;King of the Hill&#34; is the tendency to use plots that are not just topical drivel. The situations typically turn very fanciful or verge on impossible, but in some of the best ways. In ten years, a lot of these episodes will still feel current and sincere.Since I wanted to give 4 stars for the show and 2 for the cruddy cheapskate DVD-R choice, I rounded it all to 3 stars. The decision really comes down to how much you want to pay for this set. It's very possible that the price could come down in time (season 1 has dropped to $12 for a new one on Amazon, and you can get used ones for slightly less). On the other hand, perhaps &#34;made on demand&#34; items actually *won't* go down much...this has not become a mainstream practice yet and your guess is as good as or better than mine. It seems to me that &#34;on demand&#34; items ought to be CHEAPER because, well, they're not sitting on a pile of them (and desperate to unload stock) like they would be with a standard release.
