212247,A2ELNJI3RSGP6D,6300214346,A Common Man,"[7, 10]","The Keep is filmed in a beautiful style that increases the mysterious atmosphere of the story. It is set in a small Romanian village during WW II where a troop of Nazi soldiers are stationed in an ancient fortress called The Keep. It is carved into the base of a stone mountain at the entrance of the village. No one knows when The Keep was built or why. The large stones are strangely on the inside to imprison something in instead of protect against an outside threat. The commander, who provides a powerful and hypnotic performance, is unable to stop the unexplained murder of his troops each night. Writing appears on the walls of The Keep in a language that has been dead for over 500 years. An old and dying Jewish professor is brought in to decipher the ancient script. It becomes apparent to the professor that a strange and powerful being has been released and the professor must decide whether to join forces with it to destroy the Nazis or to resist it. The turning point occurs when the professor is commanded to sacrifice the thing he loves most in the world similar to God's command to Abraham to sacrifice his only son. The movie presents us with the question: can we always recognize evil and is it justified to unite with darkness to resist and fight against evil? What is the spiritual price each person must pay to survive in an immoral world?

212253,A9MNGJ3BQP36Z,6300214346,"Bill Binkelman, Wind and Wire","[11, 13]","Given that there are 38 reviews of this film here at amazon.com, it amazes me that no one has pointed out an obvious possibility. Much like Ridley Scott's LEGEND, Mann's THE KEEP is a movie that obviously was butchered by the studio before theatrical release because the director did not have enough pull to have final cut. Why do I theorize this?Both Mann and Scott are consummate story-tellers as directors. If you examine their other work, you can see that in evidence (even if you don't &quot;like&quot; the stories&quot; some of their films tell). For example, LAST OF THE MOHICANS and HEAT, for Mann. These are fully fleshed out stories that leave very few unanswered questions (except on purpose) and their narrative flow is even with no disjointed jumps in logic (prompting the viewer to think &quot;huh?&quot;)Yet in THE KEEP (as is the case also with Scott's LEGEND) not only are the respective films the shortest ever released by the director(s) (LEGEND is only 90 minutes!), but in each case, there are continuity errors, huge gaps of missing action, and even scenes that are so mis-cut and sloppily edited as to be incomprehensible. For example, the final battle scene in THE KEEP ends with Glaeken being sucked into the &quot;inner&quot; Keep but the scene is so poorly edited that instead, I thought, &quot;What the hell just happened?&quot; So much exposition, which is necessary, is missing from the film once Glaeken is introduced that it's a wonder anyone who didn't read the book had any idea who the heck he was! This film is from the same director who made HEAT? Hard to believe, isn't it?I am convinced that THE KEEP, as it is now, is NOT the film that Michael Mann shot. Not even close. I would guess there are at least 20 to 30 minutes of expository and other footage laying around somewhere (again, just like with Scott's LEGEND). That there is buzz about LEGEND being released in a greatly expanded restored-footage DVD gives me hope that the same thing witll happen with THE KEEP.All that being said, the film is very atmospheric, especially from the perspective of set design, lighting, and camera-placement (that famous long tracking pull-back shot when the soldier is first sucked into the &quot;crypt&quot; of Molasar was unbelievable when I saw it on the big screen, (without a VERY high-contrast TV, though, to accentuate the blackness of the crypt compared to the soldier's flashlight, the scene loses most of its power)). Tangerine Dream's score will not appeal to those who hate sequencers and synths, (I loved it) but it IS one of the most sought-after soundtracks, bar none, in history. For proof, visit ebay when a rare bootleg or the &quot;official&quot; verison goes up for sale.

You can decide for yourself if the graphic-comic-style plot pitting Nazis against an ancient evil spirit is your tankard of ale ('Hellboy' fans, perhaps?), but the devil is in the execution. What works: an intriguing ersatz-Romanian location with often lavish sets and suitably spooky cinematography to match, pretty effective casting, some fun pre-CGI special effects, and a story that pulls you in even if ultimately it crumbles beneath its cumbersome premise. What doesn't work: a mostly silly script, moments of weak acting (even by the venerable Ian McKellan), spotty editing, and a cloyingly inappropriate electronic soundtrack by '80s avant-gardist Tangerine Dream.

212264,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,6300214346,Dave Cordes,"[17, 22]","For the record, I would just like to declare that I am a HUGE Michael Mann fan and love how he manages to add that dreamy, surreal touch to all of his outstanding films fromThief (Special Director's Edition), toManhunter [Blu-ray], toHeat [Blu-ray], and... to The Keep. Coupled with Tangerine Dream's atmospheric score [whom he collaborated with on Thief] Mann brings that lucid dream quality to F. Paul Wilson's unforgettable novelThe Keep (Adversary Cycle). Unfortunately, Mann relies more on the visuals than character development and plot. The result is an unforgivably abridged and signifigantly altered adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's wonderfully suspensful novel.Of course, comparing the book to the film is comparing apples to oranges and somewhat unfair to both Mann and Wilson, but Mann loses all focus of the original story which centered on the origin of the Romanian vampire myth and the result is an incohesive mess. Many key plot elements are missing and the suspense that successfully manifested itself in the book and made you not want to put it down are skipped or altered entirely. It is unfortunate too because the elaborate sets and cinematography are outstanding and a fine cast with little room to perform or to deliver any sensible dialog. Gabriel Byrne's character as the loathsome S.S. commander is a guy that you just love to hate in the book, here is reduced to nothing more than a cardboard bully. Ian McKellan, a fine actor (Apt Pupil,X-Men [Blu-ray]) is wasted as the Jewish Professor Cuza who discovers heretic literature and validates the traditional vampire myth in the book, even going so far to question his faith as a Jew and the validity of Christianity, is nothing more than a translator useful to just one scene in the film. The screenplay and editing are poor; one scene Dr. Cuza and his daughter Eva (Magda in the book) are having a conversation in a concentration camp and the next scene they are suddenly in Romania translating an ancient Slavic inscription on the wall of the Keep (written in blood in the book, but looks like it is written with a piece of chalk in the film) for the edification of the Nazi commanders. Even the mysterious stranger Glaeken (played by Scott Glenn) makes his journey to the Keep in just a few short scenes by way of motorcycle... a journey that takes him half the novel by boat, foot, and horseback to reach and furthering the suspense in the novel as the Nazis continue to die one each night by an unseen entity but only one death is actually shown before the S.S. and the Einsatzkommandos arrive at the Keep. The other deaths are merely spoken of in a single line of dialog and further denying the viewer the building suspense and mystery of the malevolent force inside the walls of the Keep. In the film, Molosar is revealed to look like some creature recycled from the old sixties Star Trek episodes, while the book is more subtle and leaving more to the imagination. The relationship between Glaeken and Eva blossoms in the book, but in the film they meet in one scene and in the next they are having sex?!?! And how is it that Eva seems to know his (unpronounceable) last name when there was no mention of it anywhere in the film anyway???While I absolutely love the premise of The Keep and regard it as brilliant storytelling, the film denies the viewer any chance to fully appreciate F. Paul Wilsons captivating book and experience the genuine suspense of the story. If you want moody music and eye candy to chew on, by all means watch the movie, but do yourself a favor and absolutely read the book. Only then will you be redeemed and come to fully appreciate and understand the mysteries of The Keep.",3,"Mann, what was he thinking?!?!?",972604800,"10 27, 2000",2000,3686,"['record', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'declare', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'fan', 'love', 'how', 'add', 'dreamy', 'surreal', 'touch', 'outstanding', 'films', 'fromThief', 'Special', 'Director', 'Edition', 'toManhunter', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'toHeat', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Keep', 'Coupled', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'atmospheric', 'score', '[', 'whom', 'collaborated', 'Thief', ']', 'Mann', 'lucid', 'dream', 'quality', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'unforgettable', 'novelThe', 'Keep', 'Adversary', 'Cycle', 'Unfortunately', 'Mann', 'more', 'visuals', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'result', 'unforgivably', 'abridged', 'signifigantly', 'altered', 'adaptation', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'wonderfully', 'suspensful', 'novel.Of', 'course', 'comparing', 'book', 'film', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'somewhat', 'unfair', 'Mann', 'Wilson', 'Mann', 'focus', 'original', 'story', 'centered', 'origin', 'Romanian', 'vampire', 'myth', 'result', 'incohesive', 'mess', 'Many', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'missing', 'suspense', 'successfully', 'manifested', 'book', 'made', 'not', 'want', 'put', 'down', 'are', 'skipped', 'altered', 'entirely', 'unfortunate', 'too', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'are', 'outstanding', 'fine', 'cast', 'little', 'room', 'perform', 'deliver', 'sensible', 'dialog', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'character', 'loathsome', 'S.S.', 'commander', 'guy', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'book', 'here', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'more', 'cardboard', 'bully', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'fine', 'actor', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'X-Men', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'wasted', 'Jewish', 'Professor', 'Cuza', 'who', 'heretic', 'literature', 'traditional', 'vampire', 'myth', 'book', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'question', 'faith', 'Jew', 'validity', 'Christianity', 'nothing', 'more', 'translator', 'useful', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'screenplay', 'editing', 'are', 'poor', 'one', 'scene', 'Dr.', 'Cuza', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'Magda', 'book', 'are', 'having', 'conversation', 'concentration', 'camp', 'next', 'scene', 'are', 'suddenly', 'Romania', 'translating', 'ancient', 'Slavic', 'inscription', 'wall', 'Keep', 'written', 'blood', 'book', 'written', 'piece', 'chalk', 'film', 'edification', 'Nazi', 'commanders', 'Even', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'Glaeken', 'played', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'journey', 'Keep', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'way', 'motorcycle', 'journey', 'novel', 'boat', 'foot', 'horseback', 'reach', 'furthering', 'suspense', 'novel', 'Nazis', 'continue', 'die', 'one', 'night', 'unseen', 'entity', 'only', 'one', 'death', 'actually', 'shown', 'S.S.', 'Einsatzkommandos', 'arrive', 'Keep', 'other', 'deaths', 'are', 'merely', 'spoken', 'single', 'line', 'dialog', 'further', 'denying', 'viewer', 'building', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'malevolent', 'force', 'walls', 'Keep', 'film', 'Molosar', 'revealed', 'look', 'creature', 'recycled', 'old', 'sixties', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'book', 'more', 'subtle', 'leaving', 'more', 'imagination', 'relationship', 'Glaeken', 'Eva', 'blossoms', 'book', 'film', 'meet', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'how', 'Eva', 'know', 'unpronounceable', 'last', 'name', 'when', 'was', 'mention', 'anywhere', 'film', 'anyway', 'absolutely', 'love', 'premise', 'Keep', 'regard', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'film', 'viewer', 'chance', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilsons', 'captivating', 'book', 'experience', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'story', 'want', 'moody', 'music', 'eye', 'candy', 'chew', 'means', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', 'favor', 'absolutely', 'read', 'book', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'redeemed', 'come', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'mysteries', 'Keep']",The Keep VHS
212265,AAE2DUEMTR30I,6300214346,DAVID BRYSON,"[2, 2]","The Keep was broadcast in two parts many years ago. I saw the first half and would have liked to see the second because I thought the first was distinctly good. I recently stumbled across some references to it, from which I learned that the film was based on a book, and that the book was by F Paul Wilson, of whom I had not even heard. Comment from sources I have come to find reliable was along the lines that the film was not up to the book. In that case, I thought, better to give the film a chance while the book is still in the post.It can't have been the book, therefore, and I hope it wasn't just the comment, that makes me conclude that the film is far better earlier than later. I reacted to the early scenes this time round much as I did last time - I thought they were excellent, and I was at that stage prepared to award the film 5 stars. 4-star standard overtook the production around half way, but by the end I could not see my way, even on some smoothed-out average evaluation, beyond a third star.The production in general, and the camera work in particular, are absolutely outstanding to begin with. The atmosphere is heavy with sinister menace, and the set by and large, particularly the brooding Keep of course, is anyone's idea of nameless lurking horror. The imprisoned fiend is released by the thieving nazis, but as he progressively takes shape he deflates the quality of the narrative and even of the production as a whole. In the course of attaining his resonant bass boom he passes through a disconcertingly polite-sounding English public school diction. His intermediate-stage costume is surprisingly amateurish looking. It does not seem to be clear in the director's mind whether the phantom is set on avenging the wrongs inflicted by the occupiers or on just being a general all-round baddy.This last ambiguity seems to reflect the rather different story in the book, to go by what I have been told so far. The deaths of the storm-troopers are linked in the book, I gather, to Transylvanian vampires, and the vampirism is portrayed as some allegory of fascism. In the film the escaped entity likewise appears only to target the more unpleasant Germans, but this didn't seem to me to sit naturally with its general persona as just a Large Nasty. Similarly, when asked by the Jewish professor who or what it is, it replies `I am of you', which seems to imply that it is a monster projected from the general human id. However that is not the sole possession and prerogative of nazis still less of a sick old Jewish professor, and I could not see why from either angle such an embodiment would target the particular victims it selects.That is an anomaly in the plot. The production takes a turn for the worse in parallel, and I believe the mistake has been in trying to make the effects too literal, rather than keeping at least some aura of the unexplained about them, as at the start. The talisman that the professor is bidden to take out of the Keep by his sinister new associate just looks like a rather ordinary torch or flashlight. As the denouement approaches, the talisman is attached in self-assembly mode to what resembles either a bazooka or just an ordinary length of black plastic piping, and the monster gets its final comeuppance from Jedi-like beams aimed from the kit as finally joined up. The agent of this outcome is a mysterious stranger with paranormal powers played by Scott Glenn who has come from somewhere unstated for precisely this purpose, only taking a short break for an energetic if solemn-faced bout of passion with the heroine, to whom he has hardly been introduced. It may be symbolic in some way, but in view of the urgency of his overall mission one has to suspect that this is screen sex for its own sake. After all he shows up, ravishes the fair maiden in double-quick time, announces that in destroying the monster he will be putting an end to himself as well, gives no answer to the heroine's enquiries as to what he thought he was doing in that case, and is duly spirited away into some other state of being or nothingness after achieving his ostensible objective as well.The acting by the principals is not bad, but the only distinguished performance is from (surprise) McKellen as the elderly professor. The storm-troopers are slightly cast as pantomime nazis of the Ve haff Vays school, and my feeling is that the real foulness of who and what they were would have been conveyed better without such mechanical caricaturing. The real mechanical caricature is, sadly, the very monster who promised so atmospherically to keep us thrilled when the film started. A pity really. That start was very good indeed, but the director loses his way between the kind of allegory that I gather Wilson intended and a rather hammed-up general horror thriller with second hand effects from

Michael Mann originally shot this film with a reputed running length of about 3 hours. However, the studio - Paramount got cold feet with a budget overrun, fired Mann, and severely edited the work in progress to about a 90 minute run time. Naturally being cut in half was never going to enhance the film and achieved the reverse. What was probably an in depth and complex adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's superb novel of the same title became a largely incomprehensible mess to anyone who had not read the book. The result was a Box Office flop on its release, accompanied by largely damning reviews from most critics. It acquired something of a cult status on its video release though. That said, many fans of Michael Mann are often astonished that that they have not heard of it or in fact seen it.Set in WW2 Romania, a garrison of German soldiers are assigned to guard a seemingly deserted Keep, deep in the Carpathian mountains. Their captain, played by Jurgen Prochnow is dismayed to learn, however, that the Keep is not as empty as originally thought but in fact is home to something ancient, evil and very powerful and which embarks on killing his men. An SS contingent arrives to back up the embattled soldiers, led by a vicious Gabriel Byrne. The SS believe the local villagers to be responsible and embark on a series of atrocities. However, this just seems to make the situation worse. Accompanying the SS is a Jewish professor, played by Ian McKellen and his daughter - Alberta Watson who have been brought along to try to shed some light on what is actually going on. Before long, a mysterious stranger played by Scott Glenn arrives at the Keep, with an in depth knowledge of the place and what lies within....The film is superbly enhanced by an incredibly atmospheric score from those maestros of electronic music - Tangerine Dream.My recommendation to anyone wishing to watch this film, is to read the book first because of its severely truncuated nature. That said scenes within the film do stand up well in their own right, and give us a glimpse of what may have been had Michael Mann been allowed to complete his vision. There are differing cuts of the film all over the world it would seem. Of the two UK releases on VHS, the first release - the 'Pre Cert' actually has more complete scenes than the stereo VHS that was to follow later. Various TV versions of the film across the globe appear to have additional scenes from time to time too. One piece of good news though is that Michael Mann and Paramount finally appear to have buried their differences, and may well be embarking on a Director's Cut of the film which we can only hope restores it as fully as possible to what it should have been firstly. Now that would be a truly worthwhile exercise.",3,truncuated masterpiece,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2827,"['Keep', 'quite', 'literally', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'originally', 'shot', 'film', 'reputed', 'running', 'length', '3', 'hours', 'However', 'studio', 'Paramount', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'budget', 'overrun', 'fired', 'Mann', 'severely', 'edited', 'work', 'progress', '90', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'Naturally', 'being', 'cut', 'half', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'enhance', 'film', 'achieved', 'reverse', 'What', 'was', 'probably', 'depth', 'complex', 'adaptation', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'superb', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'became', 'largely', 'incomprehensible', 'mess', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'result', 'was', 'Box', 'Office', 'flop', 'release', 'accompanied', 'largely', 'damning', 'reviews', 'most', 'critics', 'acquired', 'something', 'cult', 'status', 'video', 'release', 'said', 'many', 'fans', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'are', 'often', 'astonished', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'fact', 'seen', 'it.Set', 'WW2', 'Romania', 'garrison', 'German', 'soldiers', 'are', 'assigned', 'guard', 'seemingly', 'deserted', 'Keep', 'deep', 'Carpathian', 'mountains', 'captain', 'played', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'dismayed', 'learn', 'however', 'Keep', 'not', 'as', 'empty', 'originally', 'thought', 'fact', 'home', 'something', 'ancient', 'evil', 'very', 'powerful', 'killing', 'men', 'SS', 'contingent', 'back', 'up', 'embattled', 'soldiers', 'led', 'vicious', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'SS', 'believe', 'local', 'villagers', 'be', 'responsible', 'embark', 'series', 'atrocities', 'However', 'just', 'make', 'situation', 'worse', 'Accompanying', 'SS', 'Jewish', 'professor', 'played', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'daughter', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'try', 'shed', 'light', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'long', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'played', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Keep', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'place', 'what', '.The', 'film', 'superbly', 'enhanced', 'incredibly', 'atmospheric', 'score', 'maestros', 'electronic', 'music', 'Tangerine', 'Dream.My', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'watch', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'severely', 'truncuated', 'nature', 'said', 'scenes', 'film', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'own', 'right', 'give', 'glimpse', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'been', 'allowed', 'complete', 'vision', 'are', 'differing', 'cuts', 'film', 'world', 'would', 'seem', 'two', 'UK', 'releases', 'VHS', 'first', 'release', ""'Pre"", 'Cert', 'actually', 'more', 'complete', 'scenes', 'stereo', 'VHS', 'was', 'follow', 'later', 'Various', 'TV', 'versions', 'film', 'globe', 'appear', 'have', 'additional', 'scenes', 'time', 'time', 'too', 'One', 'piece', 'good', 'news', 'though', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Paramount', 'finally', 'appear', 'have', 'buried', 'differences', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'embarking', 'Director', 'Cut', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'as', 'fully', 'possible', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'firstly', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'exercise']",The Keep VHS

How could we be more knowledgable about a film than it's director?I hadn't seen this since about 1984 on cable tv (after reading the novel first) and remember disliking it immensely. Having just read the book a second time I felt I'd give the film a second chance and purchased it here, figuring that maybe since I was only in my early teens during my first viewing perhaps I needed to mature a bit more to be able to understand the film.I was wrong.Not only was the film STILL crap, it was even MORE crap this time around. Even as a huge fan of the book I still didn't understand what was happening in the film version!The presence of some otherwise excellent actors--Scott Glenn, Gabriel Byrne, Ian McKellen--didn't help, because they had nothing to work with. There was NO character development at all, no real reason to feel any fear of Molasar (who, like Glenn's character, remained nameless throughout), and no real understanding of why the Germans would not leave the Keep.The film's plot for the most part seemed to follow the general framework supplied by the novel. The series of events was similar, but the HANDLING of those events was ludicrous. Yes, the editting is unbelievably bad. So bad, in fact, that when many of the scenes begin you feel like you've missed about half of it already. Some extremely vital information seems to have landed on the cutting room floor.The usually-great Ian McKellen is barely recognizable beneath his soulless acting, but he didn't have a decent screipt to go on so it's not his fault. Jurgen Prochnow only has one acting mode, so there you are. Gabriel Byrne was effective as a psycho Nazi, but not often seen. I didn't have much of a problem with Scott Glenn's portrayal of Glaeken, because he had a nice intensity that reflected the urgency of his mission, but his relationship with Magda--excuse me,I mean Eva (why the stupid name change for the film?)--blossomed waaaaayyyy too quickly.We could go on forever about the film's flaws compared to the awesomeness of the novel, but even if we had no novel to compare this to it would still blow. Everything went wrong with it except for the soundtrack, according to some.This is a perfect example of why it is best to just leave well-enough alone when it comes to adaptations. There was absolutely no reason why so many things needed to be altered (Dr. Cuza was referred to as ""Cuzar"" at times, but listed as ""Cuza"" in the credits)--the book was not a bestseller for nothing. It makes no sense to change what so many people thought was great to begin with.Another case of ""Novel: superb,Film: garbage"".",2,"The director himself hates it, why shouldn't we?",1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,2750,"['How', 'regular', 'folks', 'could', 'see', 'sort', 'art', 'piece', 'cheese', 'when', 'director', 'ashamed', 'effort', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'knowledgable', 'film', 'director', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'about', '1984', 'cable', 'tv', 'reading', 'novel', 'first', 'remember', 'disliking', 'immensely', 'Having', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'second', 'time', 'felt', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'second', 'chance', 'purchased', 'here', 'figuring', 'maybe', 'was', 'only', 'early', 'teens', 'first', 'viewing', 'perhaps', 'needed', 'mature', 'bit', 'more', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'film.I', 'was', 'wrong.Not', 'only', 'was', 'film', 'STILL', 'crap', 'was', 'even', 'MORE', 'crap', 'time', 'Even', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'film', 'version', 'presence', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'had', 'nothing', 'work', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'real', 'reason', 'feel', 'fear', 'Molasar', 'who', 'Glenn', 'character', 'remained', 'nameless', 'real', 'understanding', 'why', 'Germans', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'Keep.The', 'film', 'plot', 'most', 'part', 'seemed', 'follow', 'general', 'framework', 'supplied', 'novel', 'series', 'events', 'was', 'similar', 'HANDLING', 'events', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'Yes', 'editting', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'So', 'bad', 'fact', 'when', 'many', 'scenes', 'begin', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'half', 'already', 'extremely', 'vital', 'information', 'have', 'landed', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.The', 'usually-great', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'soulless', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'decent', 'screipt', 'go', 'not', 'fault', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'only', 'one', 'acting', 'mode', 'are', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'was', 'effective', 'psycho', 'Nazi', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'problem', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'portrayal', 'Glaeken', 'had', 'nice', 'intensity', 'reflected', 'urgency', 'mission', 'relationship', 'Magda', 'mean', 'Eva', 'why', 'stupid', 'name', 'change', 'film', 'blossomed', 'waaaaayyyy', 'too', 'quickly.We', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'film', 'flaws', 'compared', 'awesomeness', 'novel', 'even', 'had', 'novel', 'compare', 'would', 'still', 'blow', 'Everything', 'went', 'wrong', 'soundtrack', 'according', 'some.This', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'best', 'just', 'leave', 'well-enough', 'alone', 'when', 'adaptations', 'was', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'needed', 'be', 'altered', 'Dr.', 'Cuza', 'was', 'referred', 'Cuzar', 'times', 'listed', 'Cuza', 'credits', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'bestseller', 'nothing', 'sense', 'change', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'begin', 'case', 'Novel', 'superb', 'Film', 'garbage']",The Keep VHS

It was an Okay view but I don't see it sticking with me.Here's the scoop. The Nazis roll into a town in the Carpathian mountains and occupy an odd castle where the walls are adorned with a particular kind of cross made of nickle. Some greedy soldiers think one of the crosses is made of silver and, while trying to pry it off the wall, loose a demonic force. As the force begins to slowly kill the soldiers, Ian McKellen is brought in, along with his daughter, to determine the source of the evil. This is an oversimplification but it should do.The opening shot could have been lifted right from Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" released about six years prior. That both movies sport a soundtrack penned by Tangerine Dream pretty much nails that. But the visual impressiveness of this early Michael Mann outing is about all it has going for it. I haven't read the book on which it based but I have to guess something was lost in the translation. This just doesn't hang together. The subtext of the evil in the keep being the same as the evil outside is handled clumsily. It was done much better in ""Predator."" And it all feels disjointed. And the Scott Glenn character is a bit of a mystery. He seems to exist for no other reason than to fight the evil in the event it's let loose. What a boring job to hang out for thousands of years in case you're needed. And what's his need to have a sexual encounter with McKellen's daughter. He's not really human and the encounter seemed to serve no purpose in the story.The cast is impressive and all the production values are top shelf. For my dollar this failed at the script level.

Now there is only survival, until a stranger comes.Though denounced as a piece of pizzle by critics & many horror fans a like, this film has developed a cult following. I have to number myself as one of the cult.""The Keep"" draws me in with it's phenomenal cinematography, so beautiful, it's like watching a animated painted masterpiece, a wash in brilliant swirling colors. Of course, it gorgeous filming location has a lot to do with it. It also has deep dark atmospheric cinematography in the Keep it's self, adding a tangible aura of menace to the film. The scene where the Nazi's find the deep dark cavern & unleash the long imprisoned  evil entity, while digging for silver crosses,  is a testament to the power of the camera to ingrain images to one's mind. It's haunting ethereal sound track by Tangerine Dream, which makes everything in this film seem larger than life, fits the cryptic story line like a spider to a web.""The Keep"" is haunting, ethereal, & most of all cryptic. It does not give you an explanation for it's protagonist & antagonist, & that's part of it's charm, it really does not have too. All you need to know is there is good & evil, good & evil in men, & beyond. It is a triumph of style over substance, yet there is substance to this film. The substance of dreams, escape, power. The fair hearted Nazi Captain, & his struggle with what his country has became. His struggle with the S.S. Lieutenant, sent to find out who is killing the Nazi troops. The aspirations of the concentration camp released aging Jewish Scholar, who finds youth & power, & begins to become the thing he hates most. Yes, this film has substance, & a great cast of actors to fill that substance with convincing portrayals of individuals caught up in something they don't/can't understand. So goes us as an audience, if the characters don't understand their situation, then this film puts us in their mind set, which I feel is a great asset, & so many find frustrating.Even after all of this I wrote, I know ""The Keep"" is an acquired tasted. This is a film you either love or hate. I don't think I've found anyone to be on the middle ground here. One thing is for sure though, this film begs a Blu ray upgrade.

Paul Wilson novel of the same name.In 1941 Romania, German soldiers under the command of the not entirely unreasonable Captain Klaus Woermann are sent to guard the Dinu Pass in the Carpathian Mountains near a small town. Here they find an abandoned but still maintained citadel known locally as ""the keep,"" whose purpose and origin are unknown even to the people who look after it. It is constructed ""backwards,"" Woermann notices, with the largest stones inside the keep instead of outside. Rather than being built to keep something out, it is seemingly designed to keep something in. Furthermore, the walls in every room are lined with crosses made of what the creepy old caretaker claims are nickel.Woermann and his men take up residence in the keep despite the dire warnings of the caretaker. That night, a couple of enterprising soldiers who insist the crosses are made of silver, not nickel, take it upon themselves to try and chisel one out. They unwittingly unleash something mean and nasty that had been imprisoned within the bowels of the keep, something which disintegrates the first German above the waist and then completely blasts the second apart with an unseen power.At the same instant, somewhere in Greece, a mysterious man, Glaeken Trismegestus, is awoke from his sleep as if from a nightmare. Glaeken, who makes his living as a fisherman, quits his job that night and immediately undertakes a journey to Romania, carrying something in a long case with him.Back in Romania, the Waffen-SS under the command of the brutal sadist Major Erich Kaempffer shows up in town. Kaempffer, believing the deaths of the German soldiers to be partisan activity, has some of the townspeople rounded up and shot over the protests of Captain Woermann and the village priest, Father Fonescu. After dissuading Kaempffer from executing anyone else, he shows him something the unseen force wrote on the wall in an ancient language. Fonescu claims only one person can translate it, Dr. Theodore Cuza, who is an expert in early Romanian history. But, being Jewish, Cuza and his daughter Eva are currently in the nearest concentration camp.Kaempffer pulls strings and has the ailing, elderly, wheelchair-bound Cuza and his daughter brought to the keep, where Dr. Cuza translates the writing - ""I Will Be Free."" In the meantime, Glaeken, after getting past the Romanian border guards through sheer intimidation, arrives in town, and despite having some kind of specific mission in mind he immediately begins making goo-goo eyes at Eva and before you know it, hot 80's boinking is happening between the pair.In the meantime, Cuza is contacted by the thing in the keep, an evil entity named Radu Molasar, who feeds off of people's lives and is gradually growing more powerful - and more physical, turning into a human-like beast. Molasar claims that he will not only cure Cuza's illness but also make him young again, if only Cuza will do something for him in return.Cuza, who sees Molasar as a possible weapon against the Nazis, readily agrees. But is Molasar telling the truth? And what connection does the secretive Glaeken have to Molasar and the keep itself?The Keep is a fascinating film that is more style than substance. Director Michael Mann uses music and visuals to tell the story, mostly, and the script is weak and often confusing thanks in no small part to the removal of entire scenes for the final cut (an entire sequence establishing Eva and Glaeken's attraction to one another was cut, meaning the two essentially start having sex right after now), but the movie is saved by the haunting synth score done by Tangerine Dream and by some stellar performances by Ian McKellan (as Cuza), J&uuml;rgen Prochnow (as Woermann) and Gabriel Byrne (as Kaempffer) make the movie worthwhile.",4,"""No one stays the night...""",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,3916,"['movie', 'as', 'divisive', 'confounding', 'times', '1983', 'Keep', 'Michael', 'Mann-directed', 'horror', 'film', 'based', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'novel', 'same', 'name.In', '1941', 'Romania', 'German', 'soldiers', 'command', 'not', 'entirely', 'unreasonable', 'Captain', 'Klaus', 'Woermann', 'are', 'sent', 'guard', 'Dinu', 'Pass', 'Carpathian', 'Mountains', 'small', 'town', 'Here', 'find', 'abandoned', 'still', 'maintained', 'citadel', 'known', 'locally', 'keep', 'purpose', 'origin', 'are', 'unknown', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'constructed', 'backwards', 'Woermann', 'notices', 'largest', 'stones', 'keep', 'instead', 'outside', 'Rather', 'being', 'built', 'keep', 'something', 'out', 'seemingly', 'designed', 'keep', 'something', 'Furthermore', 'walls', 'room', 'are', 'lined', 'crosses', 'made', 'what', 'creepy', 'old', 'caretaker', 'claims', 'are', 'nickel.Woermann', 'men', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'keep', 'dire', 'warnings', 'caretaker', 'night', 'couple', 'enterprising', 'soldiers', 'who', 'insist', 'crosses', 'are', 'made', 'silver', 'not', 'nickel', 'take', 'upon', 'try', 'chisel', 'one', 'out', 'unwittingly', 'unleash', 'something', 'mean', 'nasty', 'had', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'bowels', 'keep', 'something', 'first', 'German', 'waist', 'then', 'completely', 'second', 'apart', 'unseen', 'power.At', 'same', 'instant', 'somewhere', 'Greece', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Glaeken', 'Trismegestus', 'awoke', 'sleep', 'nightmare', 'Glaeken', 'who', 'living', 'fisherman', 'job', 'night', 'immediately', 'undertakes', 'journey', 'Romania', 'carrying', 'something', 'long', 'case', 'him.Back', 'Romania', 'Waffen-SS', 'command', 'brutal', 'sadist', 'Major', 'Erich', 'Kaempffer', 'up', 'town', 'Kaempffer', 'believing', 'deaths', 'German', 'soldiers', 'be', 'partisan', 'activity', 'townspeople', 'rounded', 'up', 'shot', 'protests', 'Captain', 'Woermann', 'village', 'priest', 'Father', 'Fonescu', 'dissuading', 'Kaempffer', 'executing', 'anyone', 'else', 'something', 'unseen', 'force', 'wrote', 'wall', 'ancient', 'language', 'Fonescu', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'translate', 'Dr.', 'Theodore', 'Cuza', 'who', 'expert', 'early', 'Romanian', 'history', 'being', 'Jewish', 'Cuza', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'are', 'currently', 'nearest', 'concentration', 'camp.Kaempffer', 'strings', 'ailing', 'elderly', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Cuza', 'daughter', 'brought', 'keep', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Cuza', 'writing', 'Will', 'Be', 'Free', 'meantime', 'Glaeken', 'getting', 'Romanian', 'border', 'guards', 'sheer', 'intimidation', 'town', 'having', 'kind', 'specific', 'mission', 'mind', 'immediately', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'Eva', 'know', '80', 'boinking', 'happening', 'pair.In', 'meantime', 'Cuza', 'contacted', 'thing', 'keep', 'evil', 'entity', 'named', 'Radu', 'Molasar', 'who', 'people', 'lives', 'gradually', 'growing', 'more', 'powerful', 'more', 'physical', 'turning', 'human-like', 'beast', 'Molasar', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'cure', 'Cuza', 'illness', 'also', 'make', 'young', 'again', 'only', 'Cuza', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'return.Cuza', 'who', 'Molasar', 'possible', 'weapon', 'Nazis', 'readily', 'Molasar', 'telling', 'truth', 'what', 'connection', 'secretive', 'Glaeken', 'have', 'Molasar', 'keep', 'Keep', 'fascinating', 'film', 'more', 'style', 'substance', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'music', 'visuals', 'tell', 'story', 'mostly', 'script', 'weak', 'often', 'confusing', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'removal', 'entire', 'scenes', 'final', 'cut', 'entire', 'sequence', 'establishing', 'Eva', 'Glaeken', 'attraction', 'one', 'was', 'cut', 'meaning', 'two', 'essentially', 'start', 'having', 'sex', 'right', 'now', 'movie', 'saved', 'haunting', 'synth', 'score', 'done', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Cuza', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'Prochnow', 'Woermann', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Kaempffer', 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile']",The Keep VHS

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the film with a screenplay that seems to have been written by someone who failed screenplay writing 101.In Romania, deep in the heart of the Transylvanian Alps, lies the Dinu Pass. In April of 1941, a small squadron of German soldiers has been ordered to  occupy a small, deserted, five hundred year old castle keep at the Dinu pass. From the beginning, Captain Klaus Woermann (Jurgen Prochnow) senses that there is something unusual about the keep. Looking as if it had just been built and inlaid with brass and nickel crosses in every corridor, crosses that the caretaker for the keep exhorts the Germans not to touch, the keep is an architectural oddity.Soon the games begin, as an unseen force begins murdering his men. Captain Woermann sends a message to the high command. To his dismay, they respond by sending a Nazi squadron of einsatzkommandos under the leadership of SS Major Kaempffer (Gabriel Byrne) to quell whatever local guerilla activity is, undoubtedly, responsible for the murders. Soon, these death's head troopers begin succumbing to the same fate as their German Army counterparts, and all hell breaks loose.Enter the ailing Dr. Theodore Cuza (Ian McKellen), a Romanian Jew and former professor  at the University of Bucharest. Although suffering from the ravages of some debilitating illness, he is ordered by the Nazis to the keep, as he is an expert in the history of the region. It is hoped that he will be able to shed some light on the mysterious keep and enable his hosts to defeat their unknown adversary.Accompanied by Eva (Alberta Watson), his daughter, they find themselves confronted with the cruelty of the Nazis, the unexpected kindness of Captain Woermann, and something from their worst nightmares that has them call into question their deepest beliefs. Then, Glaeken (Scott Glenn), a mysterious red-headed stranger with piercing blue eyes also appears, and nothing is ever the same again.While the novel, ""The Keep"", is one of the premier horror stories of all time, the film is almost laughable and far from being in the same league. Despite its stellar cast and a moody setting shrouded in mists,  the director seemingly opts to infuse the film with garish special effects that seem to have little connection with the book. Moreover, unless one has read the book and is able to fill in the gaps, the viewer may find the film to be almost incomprehensible. This is, I imagine, due to poor editing. The Tangerine Dream score is, at times, effective, but for a portion of the film it is simply jarring and seemingly out of sync with the mood of the film.The evil at the heart of the keep departs from that in the novel. It has nothing to do with vampire folklore in the film. What was the screenplay writer thinking? Instead, the film has some special effects travesty, a mechanical demon with piercing , laser like red eyes. It is simply ludicrous, causing the movie to sink to a depth from which it simply cannot surface. Anyone who has read the book will be outraged by this transgression, as it serves to torpedo the film.Our hero, Glaeken, arriving upon the scene on a motorcycle, has piercing blue eyes that can bend others to his will. He is also is armed with what appears to be a futuristic weapon that sends out death rays.  His steamy sex scene with Eva, after they have known each other for about two heartbeats, is simply ridiculous and appears to have been gratuitously thrown in. (Quick, the movie is almost over, and we need a sex scene. ) Other than he has red hair, piercing blue eyes, and can recover from what would otherwise be mortal wounds, the Glaeken of the film has little in common with the Glaeken of the book.Still, the cast does the best it can with the hand it has been dealt. It is not, however, enough to save this film from the torpor to which it quickly sinks. Those of us who love the book would like to see a re-make that would make this wonderful book come to life. As this is the only film version now available, however, those who have read the book should rent this film, if only to see how it has fared.",3,NOT A KEEPER...,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,4548,"['film', 'based', 'terrific', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'author', 'F.', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'stories', 'go', 'definitely', 'best', 'book', 'tautly', 'written', 'tale', 'riveting', 'page', 'turner', 'author', 'taken', 'vampire', 'folklore', 'given', 'new', 'twist', 'hands', 'master', 'horror', 'genre', 'quintessential', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'new', 'dimension', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'screenplay', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'failed', 'screenplay', 'writing', '101.In', 'Romania', 'deep', 'heart', 'Transylvanian', 'Alps', 'Dinu', 'Pass', 'April', '1941', 'small', 'squadron', 'German', 'soldiers', 'been', 'ordered', 'occupy', 'small', 'deserted', 'five', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'castle', 'keep', 'Dinu', 'pass', 'beginning', 'Captain', 'Klaus', 'Woermann', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'something', 'unusual', 'keep', 'Looking', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'built', 'inlaid', 'brass', 'nickel', 'crosses', 'corridor', 'caretaker', 'keep', 'Germans', 'not', 'touch', 'keep', 'architectural', 'oddity.Soon', 'games', 'begin', 'unseen', 'force', 'murdering', 'men', 'Captain', 'Woermann', 'message', 'high', 'command', 'dismay', 'respond', 'sending', 'Nazi', 'squadron', 'einsatzkommandos', 'leadership', 'SS', 'Major', 'Kaempffer', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'quell', 'local', 'guerilla', 'activity', 'undoubtedly', 'responsible', 'murders', 'Soon', 'death', 'head', 'troopers', 'begin', 'succumbing', 'same', 'fate', 'German', 'Army', 'counterparts', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.Enter', 'ailing', 'Dr.', 'Theodore', 'Cuza', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Romanian', 'Jew', 'former', 'professor', 'University', 'Bucharest', 'suffering', 'ravages', 'debilitating', 'illness', 'ordered', 'Nazis', 'keep', 'expert', 'history', 'region', 'hoped', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'shed', 'light', 'mysterious', 'keep', 'enable', 'hosts', 'defeat', 'unknown', 'adversary.Accompanied', 'Eva', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'daughter', 'find', 'confronted', 'cruelty', 'Nazis', 'unexpected', 'kindness', 'Captain', 'Woermann', 'something', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'call', 'question', 'deepest', 'beliefs', 'Then', 'Glaeken', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'mysterious', 'red-headed', 'stranger', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'also', 'nothing', 'ever', 'same', 'novel', 'Keep', 'one', 'premier', 'horror', 'stories', 'time', 'film', 'almost', 'laughable', 'far', 'being', 'same', 'league', 'stellar', 'cast', 'moody', 'setting', 'shrouded', 'mists', 'director', 'seemingly', 'infuse', 'film', 'garish', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'connection', 'book', 'Moreover', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'able', 'fill', 'gaps', 'viewer', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'almost', 'incomprehensible', 'imagine', 'due', 'poor', 'editing', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'score', 'times', 'effective', 'portion', 'film', 'simply', 'jarring', 'seemingly', 'sync', 'mood', 'film.The', 'evil', 'heart', 'keep', 'departs', 'novel', 'nothing', 'do', 'vampire', 'folklore', 'film', 'What', 'was', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'thinking', 'Instead', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'travesty', 'mechanical', 'demon', 'piercing', 'laser', 'red', 'eyes', 'simply', 'ludicrous', 'causing', 'movie', 'sink', 'depth', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'surface', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'outraged', 'transgression', 'torpedo', 'film.Our', 'hero', 'Glaeken', 'arriving', 'scene', 'motorcycle', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'can', 'bend', 'others', 'will', 'also', 'armed', 'what', 'be', 'futuristic', 'weapon', 'out', 'death', 'rays', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scene', 'Eva', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'two', 'heartbeats', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'been', 'gratuitously', 'thrown', 'Quick', 'movie', 'almost', 'need', 'sex', 'scene', 'Other', 'red', 'hair', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'can', 'recover', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'mortal', 'wounds', 'Glaeken', 'film', 'little', 'common', 'Glaeken', 'book.Still', 'cast', 'best', 'can', 'hand', 'been', 'dealt', 'not', 'however', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'torpor', 'quickly', 'sinks', 'who', 'love', 'book', 'would', 'like', 'see', 're-make', 'would', 'make', 'wonderful', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'only', 'film', 'version', 'now', 'available', 'however', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'should', 'rent', 'film', 'only', 'see', 'how', 'fared']",The Keep VHS

Once you do this, enjoying what is good is easy. If you never read the book by F. Paul Wilson, you should -- it's one of the better atmospheric horror novels ever written, and far superior to this film, which it only superficially resembles. In a nutshell, the movie is about a troop of German soldiers who foolishly occupy an abandoned Rumanian castle during WWII. They should have found a Motel Six. The soldiers awaken a bloodthirsty baddie which looks a bit like Arnold Schwarrzenegger with no skin and who proceeds to chomp the troops up like field-gray jalapeno poppers. A lot more happens in the plot, most of which is incomprehensible, so I'll spare you any details: if you want to know what the hell is going on, read the book. What makes this film worth watching are the sumptuous visuals, which establish the sense of brooding noir for which director Michael Mann is justly famous, the bizarre but incredibly atmospheric soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, which I believe also did the instrumentals for the first Terminator film, and some (but most definetly not all) of the acting. Jurgen Prochnow (Woermann) and Gabriel Byrne (Kaempffer) are excellent as the two lead Germans, and Ian McKellen has his moments as the Jewish folklore expert they impress to help them fight the monster. I shudder to think about how good this movie could have been if the script had been worth a damn, because with the cast and director, it should have been a horror classic instead of a bizarre novelty, which it all it is. If you like noir films, this is fun to watch, and horror afficionados should also take it in just to say they did. Expect great atmosphere and music, hit-or-miss performances (Scott Glenn will want to skip this one in his bio), and a plot that is utterly incomprehensible unless you read the book.

He teams with a Jewish scholar who has been freed from a concentration camp in order to help the Nazis defend themselves. The film is much more sophisticated than most films of this type in its attitude towards evil. It distinguishes between the professional soldiers of the Wehrmacht and the political officers of the SS, portraying the former as potentially noble compared to the latter. Even the monster within the keep behaves in an essentially admirable manner until the very end, killing only Nazis, defending a woman from rape, healing the sick Jewish scholar. He expresses outrage that Romanian villagers have been mistreated by the Nazis and vows to avenge them.The film's greatest weakness, I think, is its pacing. It's impossible to tell how much time passes between scenes, though sometimes it seems to be weeks (they mention the need to retrieve the Jewish scholar from a concentration camp, and then in the next scene he has arrived in Romania). We never see the Nazis discussing what's happening to them or developing theories about the threat.

The movie absolutely reeks of the type of post-production tampering that renders ambitious sci fi and horror films incomprehensible.  Director Michael Mann, who has gone on to great things (Heat, The Insider), doesn't talk a whole lot about The Keep, and it has yet to be released properly to DVD despite the cult status.The Keep is based on the excellent F. Paul Wilson novel that comes highly recommended.  Indeed, once you read the book you'll actually have a chance at figuring out what the heck is going on in the movie.To sum up, during WWII a German army unit encounters an evil force while guarding a remote Romanian mountain village.  The Keep in question is a mysterious castle designed to keep something IN rather than out, and when the SS show up to find out why soldiers are being killed off, they unleash one pissed off movie monster complete with hoakey effects.The novel is one of the best horror stories I've come across.  Drawing on history (WWII and the Nazis), it uses human drama to highlight the battle between good and evil, or light and darkness, all the while staying suspenseful and downright creepy.  Instead of treating all Germans as evil monsters, it draws careful distinction between a disillusioned army officer and his fanatical SS counterpart.Unfortunately, The Keep is one of those movies that you really, really want to like but are forced to admit is just bad.  And, as one reviewer noted, once you get past that point you can enjoy it a bit.  The potential is astonishing: Michael Mann, a great source novel, great photography and a moody atmosphere, a Tangerine Dream score (famously never released and bootlegged and I might add, completely inappropriate in half the film), Jurgen Prochnow, Gabriel Byrne, Ian McKellen.  Yet, the whole thing falls apart in a hurry.  Things get downright mind-boggling by the end, when Scott Glenn (uh huh) uses something that resembles a cosmic bazooka to battle a demon that is equal parts smoke machine and glowing Casio readouts for eyes.  Ouch.I value The Keep highly for its important bizarre movie value.  It looks great.  The opening is fantastic; a gray and rainy atmosphere surrounds the proceedings and it's appropriately bleak.  However, the plot gets out of control.  I must admit that it's a book and a story that could use a serious and capable remake.

It's a bit non-typical, definitely achieving cult-film status, and it certainly lacks that noxious and goofy Hollywood stigmata which have tainted so many otherwise good tales of late.THE STORY: During World War II, the Nazis are expanding beyond the borders of Germany to supplement their resources and they arrive at a grim, gothic shrine-fortress of a sort in Romania. Against the advice of the locals, they inhabit the place where a few soldiers get greedy for silver ornamentation that they loot here and there and which leads to their nightmarish demise. This pulls in the Schutzstaffel [SS] who become ruthless in their interrogations and executions. Ironically, these butchers find themselves dependent upon a Jewish historian in their attempt to unravel the mystery of The Keep. A stranger with unique powers also arrives to take on the evil presence but alliances keep shifting.Here's a great quotation from the film:Eva Cuza: ""We're dealing with a Golem! A Devil!""Dr. Theodore Cuza: ""A Devil? Now you listen to me. The Devil in the Keep wears a black uniform, has a Death's Head in his cap, and calls himself a Sturmbannf&uuml;hrer!""This film scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it, (a year ago), and I have viewed it many times since.

The Waffen SS is sent to The Keep to find the killer and punish the villagers. I waited a long time to get a new copy and when I finaly did get one I was really let down, I did not know about the book that the film ws based on so I thought this was going to be a WW2 shoot-em-up, it's not. Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) plays the Wehrmacht officer in charge, Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata) plays the Waffen SS commander and Scott Glen (Urban Cowboy) plays some sort of angel who's destiny it is to fight the demon that is trying to escape from The Keep. Prochnow should have played the angel, his talent is wasted in the role he has in this film. Byrne and Glen offer solid if not wooden performances. Glen has one hot sex scene with the daughter of a Nazi prisoner, it's one of the few highlights of this film. The background music was done by the band Tangerine Dream and it is the very best thing this film has to offer, it is the only reason I gave this movie any stars. There is very little scenery for a movie set in the Rumanian mountains, you also never really get to see The Keep itself, only fleeting glimpses here and there which is disapointing. When two soldiers plundering release the Demon the stage is set and the killing starts. The Demon's appearance is really cheesy, the glowing red eyes look like something out of Superman or KISS Meets The Demon. Think of the scene in Raiders Of The Lost Ark when the Nazi archaeologist opens the Ark and releases the angels of vengence that kill all the Nazi's who gaze upon the Ark...The Keep was made 2 years AFTER Raiders but the special FX in the movie are worse than one from a film in the 60's! from a military standpoint it was a letdown, very little equipment, weapons or tactics to examine. If you like the plot of this movie as I did but want to see a good film try the VHS Castle Keep starring burt Lancaster in which a small American unit defends a castle in Belgium from the advancing Nazi's during the Battle Of The Bulge. The VHS The Bridge which is about Hitler Youth defending a bridge in their hometown from an American attack is also a good alternative.

212310,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300214346,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 9]","The Keep (Michael Mann, 1983)Michael Mann has since directed Heat, Manhunter, and The Insider. Which makes you wonder what on earth he was thinking with The Keep. It's a frustrating film; the first half of it is very, very good, which makes the awfulness of the second half seems like it reaches epic proportions.Based on the first novel in F. Paul Wilson's excellent Nightworld series of novels, The Keep follows a group of German soldiers during World War II, led by Klaus Woermann (Jurgen Prochnow, fresh off the Academy Award-winning Das Boot), who are sent to secure a Romanian keep with some strategic value...or so they're told. When they get there, they realize they're pretty much in the midst of nowhere. Woermann, the typical icy Nazi at first, softens gradually as he realizes they're in the middle of nowhere, even befriending (after a fashion) the place's caretaker, Alexandru (Morgan Sheppard, well-known videogame voice and recently onscreen in Gods and Generals). They encounter a problem, however; something starts killing off Woermann's troop, soldier by soldier. A detachment of the SS is sent in to investigate. The leader of the SS troop, Kaempffer (a very young Gabriel Byrne), is as displeased with the kinder, gentler Woermann as he is with the villagers (his first act is to have Amexandru and his two sons shot as an example), and Kaempffer and Woermann are immediately set up as enemies. The two and their troops, while inspecting the keep for insurgents, find some writing on one wall in a dead language; to translate it, they bring in a Jewish doctor suffering from a terrible disease, Theodor Cuza (Ian McKellen) and his daughter/caretaker, Eva (Alberta Watson, recently in The Sweet Hereafter). Which pretty much sets up the whole cast, except for Scott Glenn (who gets top billing), the Mysterious Stranger&trade; who's headed to the Keep for his own reasons.All of this setup is accomplished over the first forty-five minutes of the film's hundred-minute length, and Mann does a fine job of creating tension while keeping the cheesy special effects to a minimum. (Astute viewers may note that some of the special effects in here were duplicated in Manhunter, but by that time Mann had learned a valuable lesson about overkill.) Once the special effects come trotting out, however, the movie goes downhill fast. It's as if Mann wanted to cram as many effects as possible into the last half of the film, throwing away the second half of the actual novel. The enmities he's already set up between Kaempffer and the other principal characters are carried through nicely, but otherwise, Mann is too busy throwing in some of the cheesiest special effects you'll ever see. (When the murderer is finally revealed without his halo of smoke, try not to laugh too hard.) Mann also glosses over a few important details that might have made the climax more lucid, for example what those ""crosses"" in the walls actually are. But by that time, the average viewer is likely not to care.Recommended only for Michael Mann completists and fans of really bad horror films. Definitely to be avoided for fans of F.

212312,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6300214346,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 8]","Caveat: I read and disliked the original novel which the film intended to follow closely.  That said, having sat through both, I can confidently say that the flick fails on its own merits, repeating (if not enhancing) flaws of the novel while succumbing to editing flubs.THE PLOT: It's 1941, and Jurgen Prochnow is a Wehrmacht officer sent to garrison a remote Romanian village centered on an enigmatic fortress known as ""the Keep"".  The origins and purpose of the Keep are enigmatic, even to its caretakers.  Each brick is inlaid with a symbol slightly resembling a crucifix and - contrary to the basic rules of martial architecture - the Keep's structure is stronger on the inside than the outside, as if it were designed more as a prison than a fortress.  It isn't long before greedy Wehrmacht troops breach the structure of the Keep and release its sole inmate.  Able to kill at will, the malevolent being cannot escape the Keep itself - which is apparently a box-within-a-box.  However, there is the mysterious Glenn (Scott Glenn) who journeys across the Mediterranean once ""sensing"" that the Keep has been disturbed.  There is also Theodore Cuza (Ian Mckellan) who looks older here than he did in ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  Cuza, a scholar who's spent time studying the Keep, has been biding time a death camp when he's drafted by the Germans to explain the secrets of the Keep.  Cuza is accompanied by his strong-willed daughter Magda, and we soon sense that the two Cuzas will be locked in a battle paralleling that of the cosmic forces represented by Glenn and The Monster of the Keep.WHY IT DON'T WORK:  The book has its fans, but I doubt that many will appreciate a film that sloppily carves up the story.  The nature and identity of ""The Monster"" and its shared origin with Glenn are never described - in contrast with the novel which DOES establish the two elements, then switches gears and adds new ones.  Instead ""The Keep"" never becomes more than a battle between Scott Glenn and some (nearly) invincible guy in a suit.  The flick hints at the conflict between Wehrmact Captain Woermann (always dependable Jurgen Prochnow) and SS Sturmbanfuhrer Kampffer (Gabriel Byrne in a surprising turn), even though both will eventually share a fate as fodder for The Beast.  Though the remaining story has less entertainment value than an hour-long episode of ""Twilight Zone"" (the `80's version at that), incoherent storytelling is bound to make the experience feel longer than its 2-hour running time.  In fact, there's little plot at all strung between the arrival of the Nazis and the confrontation between Beast and Glenn.  The flick botches novel's dilemma of whether the Beast is better or worse than the Nazis, or what it even is (readers of the novel, and maybe the flick's credits will know he's Molasar) and compliments that failure with visual effects that are sometimes intriguing but mostly laughably dated (animated lighting effects).WHY IT MIGHT WORK:  The most recurring complaint is how the film botches re-telling of the novel, but those who haven't read it may appreciate the flick's atmospheric settings, score by Tangerine Dream and some bare attempt to keep up the suspense - even as the script utterly fails to gel into any story (whether faithful to the novel, or otherwise).  Instead, I'd suggest getting either John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or ""Prince of Darkness"", or perhaps either version of ""Quatermass and the Pit"".",2,"The Keep that doesn't....(keep, that is)",1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3450,"['Caveat', 'read', 'disliked', 'original', 'novel', 'film', 'intended', 'follow', 'closely', 'said', 'having', 'sat', 'can', 'confidently', 'say', 'flick', 'own', 'merits', 'repeating', 'not', 'enhancing', 'flaws', 'novel', 'succumbing', 'editing', 'flubs.THE', 'PLOT', '1941', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Wehrmacht', 'officer', 'sent', 'garrison', 'remote', 'Romanian', 'village', 'centered', 'enigmatic', 'fortress', 'known', 'Keep', 'origins', 'purpose', 'Keep', 'are', 'enigmatic', 'even', 'caretakers', 'brick', 'inlaid', 'symbol', 'slightly', 'resembling', 'crucifix', 'contrary', 'basic', 'rules', 'martial', 'architecture', 'Keep', 'structure', 'stronger', 'inside', 'outside', 'were', 'designed', 'more', 'prison', 'fortress', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'greedy', 'Wehrmacht', 'troops', 'breach', 'structure', 'Keep', 'release', 'sole', 'inmate', 'Able', 'kill', 'will', 'malevolent', 'being', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'Keep', 'apparently', 'box-within-a-box', 'However', 'mysterious', 'Glenn', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'who', 'journeys', 'Mediterranean', 'once', 'sensing', 'Keep', 'been', 'disturbed', 'also', 'Theodore', 'Cuza', 'Ian', 'Mckellan', 'who', 'older', 'here', 'did', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Cuza', 'scholar', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'studying', 'Keep', 'been', 'biding', 'time', 'death', 'camp', 'when', 'drafted', 'Germans', 'explain', 'secrets', 'Keep', 'Cuza', 'accompanied', 'strong-willed', 'daughter', 'Magda', 'soon', 'sense', 'two', 'Cuzas', 'will', 'be', 'locked', 'battle', 'paralleling', 'cosmic', 'forces', 'represented', 'Glenn', 'Monster', 'Keep.WHY', 'IT', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'book', 'fans', 'doubt', 'many', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'sloppily', 'up', 'story', 'nature', 'identity', 'Monster', 'shared', 'origin', 'Glenn', 'are', 'never', 'described', 'contrast', 'novel', 'DOES', 'establish', 'two', 'elements', 'then', 'gears', 'new', 'ones', 'Instead', 'Keep', 'never', 'more', 'battle', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'nearly', 'invincible', 'guy', 'suit', 'flick', 'hints', 'conflict', 'Wehrmact', 'Captain', 'Woermann', 'always', 'dependable', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'SS', 'Sturmbanfuhrer', 'Kampffer', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'surprising', 'turn', 'even', 'will', 'eventually', 'share', 'fate', 'fodder', 'Beast', 'remaining', 'story', 'less', 'entertainment', 'value', 'hour-long', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '80', 'version', 'incoherent', 'storytelling', 'bound', 'make', 'experience', 'feel', 'longer', '2-hour', 'running', 'time', 'fact', 'little', 'plot', 'strung', 'arrival', 'Nazis', 'confrontation', 'Beast', 'Glenn', 'flick', 'botches', 'novel', 'dilemma', 'Beast', 'better', 'worse', 'Nazis', 'what', 'even', 'readers', 'novel', 'maybe', 'flick', 'credits', 'will', 'know', 'Molasar', 'compliments', 'failure', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'sometimes', 'intriguing', 'mostly', 'laughably', 'dated', 'animated', 'lighting', 'effects', '.WHY', 'IT', 'MIGHT', 'WORK', 'most', 'recurring', 'complaint', 'how', 'film', 're-telling', 'novel', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'may', 'appreciate', 'flick', 'atmospheric', 'settings', 'score', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'bare', 'attempt', 'keep', 'up', 'suspense', 'even', 'script', 'utterly', 'gel', 'story', 'faithful', 'novel', 'otherwise', 'Instead', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'getting', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'perhaps', 'version', 'Quatermass', 'Pit']",The Keep VHS

Paul Wilson's gothic horror novel is a terrible disappointment. The action is set in Nazi-occupied Romania, during the Second World War. It is, however, clearly filmed in North Wales, with the disused slate quarries of Blaenau Ffestiniog doing a poor impersonation of the Carpathian Mountains. And with far too much dry ice compensating for the lack of any real atmosphere in the screenplay!Of the cast, only Jurgen Prochnow's agonised performance, as the disillusioned and disaffected Nazi commander, is the slightest bit credible. Everyone else seems to be suffering from an overdose of intensity, something which is completely unwarranted, given the appalling script and the totally disjointed editing job to which the film has been subjected. The whole affair gives the impression that it has been strung together in a way that will link all of the (laughable) special effect scenes as economically as possible without once requiring the audience to engage any thought processes. No, not even Tangerine Dream's moody and brooding synthesiser soundtrack music can rescue this movie from a hellish pit of its own making - and where it really ought to be left, undisturbed.Incidentally, if you're interested in acquiring the music from this film, you'll either have to fork out the absolute fortune that TDI want for the limited edition CD release, ""The Keep"", or else make do with the ten or so minutes-worth that were reworked into TD's live ""Logos"" album.

No, Jack does not repair appliances, but people go to him for help in a situation when they cannot go to the police.The creature Rasalom of the keep is of the ""Lovecraft Genre,"" and while he is banished from this plane in ""The Keep"" he finds a way back, and intends to destroy the world. His previous opponent has grown old, and the power in the sword, and the ability to evoke the Eldar Gods is now gone. That leaves Jack as his principal opponent. Paul is also weaving Rasalom into his ""Repairman  Jack"" novels.You simply have to sit down and read ""The Keep"" to appreciate how intense, vibrant, and terrifying the real story is. The movie is at best, a pale shadow and a ham fisted muddled mess. Not that there were not some good performances by some of the actors,you just had a director that thought he knew more about what makes a great story than the author did.Hopefully the ongoing effort to remake the movie and follow the book will happen.
