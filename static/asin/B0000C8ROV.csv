774086,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000C8ROV,A Customer,"[4, 4]","Summary:The beginning of the story, which is related near the end of the movie, is that of a bright and energetic young man who loses his parents in a tragic accident then undergoes a drastic personality change, turning from the town hero into the town zero.  This now grown man, Davey Stone (voice - Adam Sandler), is constantly getting into trouble and doesn't really seem to care.As the town's Christmas celebrations get underway, Davey creates a ruckus running from the police and lands himself in court, where he is about to receive a strict punishment, only for the local town do-gooder, Whitey (voice - Adam Sandler), to step in and volunteer to reform Davey by making him help referee the youth basketball games (where he used to be the star).  The judge agrees and Davey is now forced to spend his time refereeing.  Whitey also does his best to befriend Davey, but only really gets the chance when Davey makes a fool out of some guys at the local gym who retaliate by burning down his trailer.Davey is then invited to and decides to move in with Whitey and his spinster sister, Eleanore (voice - Adam Sandler).  Slowly, Eleanore and Whitey work their way into Davey's life, only to burn their inroads when Whitey innocently relates the story of what happened to Davey's parents.  As Davey's inability to deal with this part of his past is the cause of his misbehavior, Whitey's recounting of the story turns him back into the anti-social jerk and leads him to rudely criticize Whitey.Doing his best to brush off the criticism, Whitey then heads for home to get ready for the town's annual Christmas banquet.  Whitey, as the town do-gooder, has been trying for years to win the town's prestigious ribbon given for outstanding service to the basketball league.  Whitey and Eleanore dress in their finest, fully believing that this year will be Whitey's triumph.  When he doesn't win, Davey's haunting criticisms come back and Whitey finally realizes that the townspeople really don't seem to care about him and all of the things he does for them.  Crushed, he leaves with Eleanor to find solace in the mall.  But Davey, having experienced a change of heart (also in the mall; Adam Sandler must have some strange mall fixation), bursts into the town celebration and gives them a powerful lecture on how they have overlooked Whitey, who has only been nice to everyone his entire life.  The townspeople finally come to their senses and realize their mistake.  They race to the mall and bestow upon Whitey the ribbons he truly deserves (he gets them from all the years he should have won them, which are all of them), resulting in a rather touching climax where Whitey's years of service are finally recognized.My Comments:I almost hate to admit it, but I was actually touched by this movie.  It did such a good job of making Whitey a lovable but pathetic character who only experiences frustrating defeats that you can only feel sorry for him.  In my more humanitarian moments (like right now as I write this), I am inclined to see Whitey as a representation of the average man (though heavily laden with pitiable characteristics) and this movie as being about how those people who do so much for society are often overlooked.  This is especially true considering the person who wins the ribbon during the celebration is a billionaire who shelled out a pittance (for him) to buy a new scoreboard, as compared to Whitey's immeasurable time contributions (basically a variation of the Widow's mite story from the New Testament).But the movie isn't without its problems.  The biggest one is really something my wife pointed out early on: Who is the movie targeting?  I mean, it seems most movies have an intended audience and/or a specific genre (action, drama, young girls, etc.), but this one doesn't really seem to have either.  Because it's a cartoon you might think young kids.  But this is really a cross between the Simpsons and South Park in crudeness, which means you can rule out children under 10.  Teenagers may find it too cheesy to bear, and adults likely won't find it initially engaging, meaning you've lost all of your potential audiences.  However, if you can make it through the first 30 minutes or so until you really get to know Whitey and fall in love with his character, the movie may suck you in, but you really do have to give it a lot of leeway.As far as the story goes, it's not perfect and I don't think it has any pretenses to be perfect.  Where is Davey's extended family?  What happens between him and his former girlfriend?  Why is Davey such a jerk?  Even without answering these questions, the story works, but it does take a while to get your attention.Overall, I didn't have very high expectations going into this movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed to be some sort of hybrid Hanukah/Christmas movie.  I didn't end up loving the movie, but it was better than I thought it was going to be and I was actually touched by the story, though I was touched more by Whitey than by Davey.  It definitely isn't a movie for young kids, but some adolescents may enjoy and young adults may as well.  It's probably a bit too crass for older adults to appreciate it, but you might be surprised.",3,Occasionally funny; a little touching,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,5239,"['Summary', 'beginning',

774088,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,B0000C8ROV,Andy Radke,"[1, 1]","I'm the first to admit that I was more than just a little skeptical about seeing this movie after reading dozens upon dozens of bad reviews on various noteworthy sites.  However, I took a chance and went to see ""Eight Crazy Nights"" on Sunday, and it was by far one of the FUNNIEST movies I've ever seen......animated or not.  I swear, I laughed so hard throughout this entire movie to the point where my sides were aching!One thing that needs to be made CRYSTAL clear is the fact that this is not a kids' movie by any means.  I think the trailers and commercials for ""Eight Crazy Nights"" are rather misleading in regards to this fact.  I realized this when I saw at least 5 sets of parents bring their children to see it.This movie doesn't try to be the next animated marvel.  It seems that many critics fail to realize that, and put the movie down because of its mere simplicity.  It's a simple movie with a simple plot, intended for a teen-to-adult audience, in addition to catering to Sandler's loyal fanbase.Much like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"", this movie contains profanity (not as much mind you) but it's there, as well as various sexual innuendos, and plenty of noisy bodily functions.  lol.If you clear away the comedic purpose of the film, etc.  There really is a touching plot to this movie.  In short, a town troublemaker gets in deep with the law.  With his back against the wall, a kind, old man offers him a chance of redemption and appoints him as the Jewish Youth Centre's assistant basketball coach.  I won't give it all away, but the story gives true meaning of friendship and hope.I know, everyone's a critic....and I guess I'm one of them.  But truth be told, this IS a great movie.  It's not for everyone.  If you're easily offended, may I suggest ""Santa Clause 2"".  But for those of you who are willing to let go of your senses for 70 odd minutes and have a good laugh, then you really can't go wrong with this one.

Now here is a movie that will put you out of the Haunakah spirit as quickly as Ron Howard's live-action remake of ""The Grinch"" put people out of the Christmas spirit.A nasty piece too goofy to even be animated, it's Adam Sandler's first full-fledged animated musical ""8 Crazy Nights.""Every year, just about every TV show grinds out a puke-worthy Christmas special where the formula is something like this: Characters have spirit, something bad happens everyone has misfortune. Then... the split-second everyone suddenly obtains the holiday spirit... everyone's problems instantly evaporate. And everything everybody wants... suddenly fall into place...Apparently, because there's little hype and buzz around Haunakah, Sandler has decided to put some product out there (just like he did with his infamous SNL song ""The Hanuakah Song""), but basically with this movie, all he's done is proved that there can be trite, tedious and tiresome holiday ""specials"" for Hanuakah, too.Is that a fight WORTH winning?I've enjoyed a lot of Adam Sandler's flicks, but this one had me annoyed, bored, disgusted and reaching for the remote after the first quarter.Sandler's obnoxious hateful slacker shtick has finally been beaten into the ground. He's been pushing this since he started making movies. His worst, by far, was ""Little Nicky,"" but this movie is the equivalent of a reindeer turd.Adam Sandler stars (or rather, voices) as Davey, a delinquent who's gone downhill a life of crime and vandalism ever since early in his youth. He lives in a crummy trailer and is the Scrooge/Grinch of this little upstate town. He does his best at making plenty of enemies and getting on people's ""*****"" lists instead of Santa's good one. Alcohol and sleeping in don't help his personality much.Finally, after the town has had enough of his very presence (in my opinion, it took way too long), he gets caught during one of his vandalism through town and is thrown before a judge.Things look bad for Davey. But just then, when the judge is about to toss him in a State prison, the town's elderly volunteer youth-basketball coach (also voiced by Sandler) steps up and requests the idea of taking Davey under his wing and making him his assistant coach. Davey rudely rolls his eyes at this idea, but realizing it's either this or a decade in the slammer, he quickly signs up.OK, now see if any of this sounds familiar:Whitey's dream for the last 35 years has been to win the town highest honor--the annual town patch. Something they give to the town's most respected and beloved citizen.Davey doesn't think he'll ever make it. There's also a woman who Davey dated as a young preteen who has grown to despise who he is now. She has a kid who seems insecure and shy and needs a good father figure in his life. Davey hits bottom and realizes that...Well, you can put the rest together, can't you?But there's no fun along the way.I felt while watching this---a sense of disappointment and disinterest in everything that was going on. I felt like I should be enjoying this movie a lot more than I was. I could identify with this story. I used to be an excited and open-minded child. But my optimism and eager nature was met with a lot of crushing disappointment when I was little.Oh, his voice-over is strong enough. As Davey (his usual movie character), Whitey and Eleanor. And SNL/Sandler-movie regulars Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealson and Rob Schnider make their trademark noteworthy points, but it's basically top-notch comedic actors out there reading the phone book.Davey is supposed to be a hero. At least that's how we're supposed to see him. As an angry kid who's lost touch with himself and attacks everyone who can find happiness--in places he can't. Bitter, angry, hateful and destructive---but underneath, there's a repressed likable guy trying to get out (In case you've ever seen an Adam Sandler movie, I'm not giving anything away).But me, I saw him as someone I'd run into oncoming traffic to avoid. Even when he goes though his ""change of heart,"" he was still someone I would take a baseball bat to. Davey is the prototypical bully in almost every Hollywood movie. Here, he's supposed to be a hero.I guess that could work... if Davey wasn't constructed out of cardboard and as funny as the death of your family pet.As the town bully, he's a dick. As a reformed hero, he's a phony. For some reason, when Davey reformed, I didn't believe it for an instant. He's still an open crusty sore. Sandler is just pulling out the standard cope-out ending.But he's made a movie that's too profane and nasty for his ideal audience and too simple-minded, scatological and unimaginative for older viewers.The jokes are mostly just Sandler committing acts of destruction and violent behavior (either physical or emotional). There are some nice songs here and there (some mediocre though), but this movie is no holiday pick-me-up. If you walk into this movie in a seasonal mood, this will certainly take care of that.What's really unsettling is the artificial reform ending that I think these movies are required to have.Sandler's remix of ""The Haunakah Song"" was some of the best part of the movie (and so were a couple of his others). Like I said, there are a handful of funny jokes and catchy songs, but the bad far more than outnumbers the good.I hope Sandler chooses to evolve his style... at least a little.Was he ALWAYS like this? Is this just more of the same?Or am I just out-growing him?danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]%2Fi8&s;=mt_a",2,You'd be better off getting another drediel....,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,5526,"['Dane',

774100,A2MCC9L0YDQAA6,B0000C8ROV,Daniel Mullen,"[8, 8]","Okay, so the movie is crude and not suitable for kids.  I have two things to say to that: (1)not only is the film rated PG-13, but in today's age of ultra-descriptive ratings explanations courtesy of the MPAA, they even let you know in the rating description that this movie contains crude humor.  And (2) this is Adam Sandler, people.  It's not Jimmy Stewart or Tom Hanks.  It's a comedian/actor who's built his career on crude humor, so if you mis-gauged what the tone of this flick would be, it's your own fault.  I thought it was great.  I think it was purposely made to appear like a family movie but actually be crude, just to be ironic and clever.I'm surprised people are so quick to say all that's wrong with this movie, yet no one seems to give kudos to Sandler for making a holiday movie that's focused on Hanukkah, an often overlooked holiday in the mainstream entertainment industry.  I'm not saying this movie has some deep, revelatory moral center that pays homage to the Jewish faith, I'm just citing it as another example of the refreshing way Sandler crafted an entertainingly irreverent holiday spoof flick.Take movies for what they are.  If you don't like them, fine - we're all entitled to our own opinions.  But to criticize a film for not measuring up to the misjudged idea of what you thought it would be is just plain silly.

Unlike The Wedding Singer, the humor was a bit more locker room gross-out, but like the Wedding Singer, it was filled with sentiment and heart. An angry Scrooge-like Jewish man learns to grieve, let go, and love the holidays again.  No, it's not for small kids.  That's why it's rated PG-13. Sandler shows tremendous talent and versatility as the voices of Davy, Eleanor and Whitey, the latter two being annoying elderly fraternal twins whom Davy grows to love despite their freakishness.  Rob Schneider, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nieland add their talent, as well as cameos by Tyra Banks and rock singer Ann Wilson as Davy's mom.  Alison Krauss lends her sweetness as the singing voice of Jennifer, Davy's childhood love, now a single mom.  The music is the most outstanding part of this film. The lyrics are silly and goofy, but also clever, and the song structures are dynamic and hooky, and will stay with you afterward.  If you go into this movie realizing it's not a white-washed Disney flick for the kids, but it's a funny, sometimes gross, but sensitive Christmas story that tackles somewhat-adult issues, like why some people hate the holidays, I think you'll enjoy it almost as much as I did.

774105,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B0000C8ROV,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[6, 8]","I loved this film. But you may very well not like it at all. Answering a couple quick questions will help you know whether you should stay away from Eight Crazy Nights:Can anything in an artwork offend you? Be honest here; there's nothing wrong with you if you can be offended by content. If you're the kind of person who might say, ""I normally don't mind (or I even like) crude humor, but that just went too far"", then the answer is ""yes"". If you think that an artwork can go too far, if you have any personal sacred cows, then be very cautious of watching Eight Crazy Nights.Next, do you like to think of yourself as being more mature than you were as, say, a 13 year old? I don't just mean, ""Are you more mature"", but do you pride yourself on that, so that you don't find joy in playing 13-year-old again. If yes, that's another indicator for caution.And finally, for people who actually are teens and who answered ""No"" to the above questions, do you dislike your crude humor to have any positive messages or sentimentality? If yes, use caution.It's not that Eight Crazy Nights is the most outrageous, risk-taking, potentially offensive comedy ever, or that it's constantly juvenile or ever over-the-top sappy. For offense and maturity, there's nothing here that's not found in the average episode of South Park. But maybe because it's an animated holiday film where many people aren't expecting something like South Park, a lot of viewers--especially the offendable and proudly sophisticated--have turned up their noses.Eight Crazy Nights is actually quite complex and sophisticated on many artistic levels. The animation is exceptionally well done--at least as good and complex as most Disney features. For example, there are many subtle layering and perspective effects, similar to Disney's multiplane approach, and often mimicking ""live action"" cameras, so that different focal depths will be blurred. The environments are lush and subtly modeled. Characters are fluid and well drawn. There are many difficult sequences, such as action and sports scenes, and they're all very impressive.Script-wise, Adam Sandler achieved a film that both mocks/spoofs traditional holiday films and manages to be one at the same time. It's not that different in theory from, say, Elf or Bad Santa, except that Sandler isn't at all afraid to continually go for the throat in his brand of humor (which isn't to suggest that Elf or Bad Santa are bad films--I love both of them, and especially Bad Santa goes for the throat sometimes, too). The plot has some similarities to A Christmas Carol in that the main character, Davey (voiced by Sandler), has an over-the-top, bitter, bah-humbug attitude about the holidays brought on by past events. Davey is even visited by something akin to supernatural entities at one point.Sandler's music and music performances are impressive. The focus is on silly/funny lyrics, of course, but at times, his singing and songwriting skills suggest that he could have easily had a career in the music business instead. While watching Eight Crazy Nights I kept thinking how much I'd like to see a Sandler penned Broadway show--that would be just the thing to help knock Broadway out of its frustrating musical and content conservatism.A couple characters, especially Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), take some getting used to. Sandler is doing one of his odd, affected voices for the character, and Whitey is designed to be disturbing and disagreeable. But of course the joke is that he's the symbol of positive holiday spirit, so Sandler is again pulling the rug out from beneath our expectations--something he does regularly, in many different ways, throughout the course of Eight Crazy Nights--and that's a good thing.",5,A great film if you're in the market for it,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3737,"['loved', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'Answering', 'couple', 'quick', 'questions', 'will', 'help', 'know', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'Can', 'anything', 'artwork', 'offend', 'Be', 'honest', 'here', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'can', 'be', 'offended', 'content', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'say', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'even', 'crude', 'humor', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'then', 'answer', 'yes', 'think', 'artwork', 'can', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'have', 'personal', 'sacred', 'cows', 'then', 'be', 'very', 'cautious', 'watching', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights.Next', 'do', 'think', 'being', 'more', 'mature', 'were', 'say', '13', 'year', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'Are', 'more', 'mature', 'do', 'pride', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'joy', 'playing', '13-year-old', 'again', 'yes', 'indicator', 'caution.And', 'finally', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'are', 'teens', 'who', 'answered', 'No', 'above', 'questions', 'do', 'dislike', 'crude', 'humor', 'have', 'positive', 'messages', 'sentimentality', 'yes', 'use', 'caution.It', 'not', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'most', 'outrageous', 'risk-taking', 'potentially', 'offensive', 'comedy', 'ever', 'constantly', 'juvenile', 'ever', 'over-the-top', 'sappy', 'offense', 'maturity', 'nothing', 'here', 'not', 'found', 'average', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'maybe', 'animated', 'holiday', 'film', 'where', 'many', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'something', 'South', 'Park', 'lot', 'viewers', 'especially', 'offendable', 'proudly', 'sophisticated', 'have', 'turned', 'up', 'noses.Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'actually', 'quite', 'complex', 'sophisticated', 'many', 'artistic', 'levels', 'animation', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'least', 'good', 'complex', 'most', 'Disney', 'features', 'example', 'are', 'many', 'subtle', 'layering', 'perspective', 'effects', 'similar', 'Disney', 'multiplane', 'approach', 'often', 'mimicking', 'live', 'action', 'cameras', 'different', 'focal', 'depths', 'will', 'be', 'blurred', 'environments', 'are', 'lush', 'subtly', 'modeled', 'Characters', 'are', 'fluid', 'well', 'drawn', 'are', 'many', 'difficult', 'sequences', 'such', 'action', 'sports', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'very', 'impressive.Script-wise', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'achieved', 'film', 'mocks/spoofs', 'traditional', 'holiday', 'films', 'manages', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'different', 'theory', 'say', 'Elf', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'Sandler', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'continually', 'go', 'throat', 'brand', 'humor', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'Elf', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'are', 'bad', 'films', 'love', 'especially', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'throat', 'sometimes', 'too', 'plot', 'similarities', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'main', 'character', 'Davey', 'voiced', 'Sandler', 'over-the-top', 'bitter', 'bah-humbug', 'attitude', 'holidays', 'brought', 'past', 'events', 'Davey', 'even', 'visited', 'something', 'akin', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'one', 'point.Sandler', 'music', 'music', 'performances', 'are', 'impressive', 'focus', 'silly/funny', 'lyrics', 'course', 'times', 'singing', 'songwriting', 'skills', 'suggest', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'had', 'career', 'music', 'business', 'instead', 'watching', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Sandler', 'penned', 'Broadway', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'help', 'knock', 'Broadway', 'frustrating', 'musical', 'content', 'conservatism.A', 'couple', 'characters', 'especially', 'Whitey', 'also', 'voiced', 'Sandler', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'Sandler', 'doing', 'one', 'odd', 'affected', 'voices', 'character', 'Whitey', 'designed', 'be', 'disturbing', 'disagreeable', 'course', 'joke', 'symbol', 'positive', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'so', 'Sandler', 'again', 'pulling', 'rug', 'expectations', 'something', 'regularly', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'course', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

774107,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B0000C8ROV,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[8, 9]","I make no secret the fact that I think Adam Sandler has inherited the comic mantle of Jerry Lewis, and I think Adam would consider that a compliment. Were the ghost of Lewis to drop in for a holiday screening of this film, however, I think he'd say, ""It's a good film, Adam, but it could have been great."" How could it have been great? With a little restraint, instead of playing for the South Park/ Family Guy crowd, this could have been a family film. We desperately need a funny holiday special, not more schmaltzy ones, and this could have been it. Adam Sandler knows it too. He very much caught the spirit of Mr. Deeds. He shone in Big Daddy. He brilliantly calls his production company Happy Madison, saying heck if you didn't like Billy Madison (I did by the way), and refusing to be typecast as Happy Gilmore.It also took guts to ""play"" Davy, not just voice him, as with the usual animation voiceovers. Davy is conflicted and Adam plays him that way. There are hints and tributes to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but there are also echoes of a Jerry Lewis film called ""The Delinquent"". This is a PG-13 film merely for the reason that Adam had the bad luck of working when films and TV lack the restraint and limits that Lewis and earlier comedians worked within and which make for great art.So thanks to that rating, kids won't get to see Davy struggle with tough breaks and big questions. Nor will they see the opening scene of a Chanukah menorah and nativity scene coexisting side by side. They won't even get to hear the third version of Sandler's witty ""Chanukah Song"". What they'll get instead is more innocuous clones of someone saving Christmas by rescuing Santa Clause from the Martians or whoever his captors are this year.That leaves us with only A Christmas Story. Jean Shepherd, who writes his books for adults, restrained himself to make this movie family- friendly and came up with a holiday classic. Paul Reubens breathed new life into Saturday Morning by making Pee Wee's Playhouse into a kids' show. And when Davy-- I mean Adam-- decides to use his talents for kids, he'll be another Jerry Lewis.",4,Jerry Lewis is Alive and Well,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,2116,"['make', 'secret', 'fact', 'think', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'inherited', 'comic', 'mantle', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'think', 'Adam', 'would', 'consider', 'compliment', 'Were', 'ghost', 'Lewis', 'drop', 'holiday', 'screening', 'film', 'however', 'think', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'film', 'Adam', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'little', 'restraint', 'instead', 'playing', 'South', 'Park/', 'Family', 'Guy', 'crowd', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'family', 'film', 'desperately', 'need', 'funny', 'holiday', 'special', 'not', 'more', 'schmaltzy', 'ones', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'too', 'very', 'much', 'caught', 'spirit', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'shone', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'brilliantly', 'production', 'company', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'saying', 'heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'did', 'way', 'refusing', 'be', 'typecast', 'Happy', 'Gilmore.It', 'also', 'took', 'guts', 'play', 'Davy', 'not', 'just', 'voice', 'usual', 'animation', 'voiceovers', 'Davy', 'conflicted', 'Adam', 'way', 'are', 'hints', 'tributes', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'are', 'also', 'echoes', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'film', 'called', 'Delinquent', 'PG-13', 'film', 'merely', 'reason', 'Adam', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'working', 'when', 'films', 'TV', 'lack', 'restraint', 'limits', 'Lewis', 'earlier', 'comedians', 'worked', 'make', 'great', 'art.So', 'thanks', 'rating', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Davy', 'struggle', 'tough', 'breaks', 'big', 'questions', 'will', 'see', 'opening', 'scene', 'Chanukah', 'menorah', 'nativity', 'scene', 'coexisting', 'side', 'side', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'hear', 'third', 'version', 'Sandler', 'witty', 'Chanukah', 'Song', 'What', ""'ll"", 'get', 'instead', 'more', 'innocuous', 'clones', 'someone', 'saving', 'Christmas', 'rescuing', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Martians', 'whoever', 'captors', 'are', 'only', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'who', 'books', 'adults', 'restrained', 'make', 'movie', 'family-', 'friendly', 'came', 'up', 'holiday', 'classic', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'making', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Playhouse', 'kids', 'show', 'when', 'Davy', 'mean', 'Adam', 'use', 'talents', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Jerry', 'Lewis']",N/A

774111,AQ2RL6HTVI86T,B0000C8ROV,"J. Bridell ""Lost Johnny""","[1, 9]","First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message.  Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this.  You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends.  Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey?  No one else does, that's a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films.  He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking?  Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant "" Ok I go take shower now"" says Chinese waiter.  I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene.  For starters Mr. Sandler seems to  think he is a voice over man, he is not.  His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard.  One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is.  Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each.  Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here).  The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them.  He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was.  He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book.  Not here.  Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go.  The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms.  He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants ""nice kitty kitty"" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap ""I hope you like them extra sweaty"" Ho Ho Ho.  For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth.  We are treated to this twice.  God bless us, every one.  By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad  ""If I move my bowls without using the spray....that's a technical foul"" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God.  By reading this one might assume, as I did, that  this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not.  It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel.  The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing.  Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after.  The same cannot be said for the audience.  Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience?  There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness.  Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings.  This Christmas turkey won't even work as leftovers.

Take, for instance, the scene towards the end, when the mayor of Dukesbury (voiced by Kevin Nealon) cracks a very unfunny joke in the town hall, and the citizens of Dukesbury start to snort snot all over their tables, and some deer outside get in such a violent fit of laughter that feces squirts from behind their tails with little *splurt* sounds.Does that sound like a good-natured family comedy to you? That's because it isn't. The film stars, in one way or another, Adam Sandler, who has finally found a suitable medium to let loose all his crudeness without (a) getting the film banned from every country in the world, and (b) injuring himself in the process. Because there's something innocent about cartoons. In ""Eight Crazy Nights,"" his self-crafted character, Davey Stone, is on the run from the town police after ripping off a Chinese man (voiced by Rob Schneider). He picks up the lid of a trashcan and slides down a railing like Vin Diesel did in ""xXx."" It's funny to see a limitless and physically fit Sandler, yes, but right as the scene starts to become fun, we get a worn out gag involving squeezed melons that has been done countless times before, including last year's ""Austin Powers in Goldmember.""Davey resents the holidays, and he especially resents the ""eight crazy nights"" of Hanukkah, because when he was 12 years old his parents died on their way to his basketball game. Ever since, Davey has been the town troublemaker, getting stoned (hence his last name?) and making out with cars. (Don't ask.)Davey gets picked up by the cops and is sentenced to ten years in jail, when the town eccentric, Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), offers the judge to make Davey a basketball referee in hopes of changing his ill spirits. The judge agrees, but as soon as Davey leaves court he throws Whitey into a porta-potty and knocks it down a hill. Whitey emerges with human feces all over his body, and Davey then sprays him with water, saying, ""See ya' later, poopsicle.""That's why the film careens from gross-out gags to heartwarming moments and then back to juvenile bodily function jokes. You've probably heard a lot of people complain about bodily function humor and how bad it is, but this will disgust the most crude and vile audience members. I did for me. (Hey, I'm joking! About being crude. Er...never mind.)A lot of people hate Adam Sandler and his humor, but I think they're just all jumping on the bandwagon. Ironically, his ""breakthrough role"" in P.T. Anderon's 2002 art film ""Punch-Drunk Love"" has been praised as his crowning triumph. I, personally, still enjoy ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Big Daddy."" His comedies are very basic but also, on occasion, very funny. I also like ""Saturday Night Live""-type humor a lot, so that may have something to do with it.Is ""Eight Crazy Nights"" a bad movie? I guess. It's hard to place a finger on. It's mean-spirited and vile, and that's where the film fails, but when the film has its touching moments they are touching. Too bad it always has to ruin the mentioned scenes by ending them with lame poop and/or seizure jokes. Again, don't ask.",3,"Here Comes Chanukah!

774117,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0000C8ROV,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","I have been a fan of the movies Adam Sandler has made to date. Are they cinematic treasures? Heck no! They're nothing more than fun comedies that make me laugh. And with that in mind, I expected nothing less from this movie, even if it is the animated adventures of a Sandler character.What I got instead was a mish mash of several movie styles that never quite gels. Sure, it made me feel good by films end but I think that has more to do with my feelings towards sappy movies during the holidays than the movie itself (see review of ELF).The story revolves around Davey (Sandler) who is the town jerk. Having had the chance to make something of his life, he tossed it all aside one fateful night when his parents died on the way to watch him play in a junior league basketball game. Now the town drunk, a run in with the law is about to land him in jail. Until a kindly, tiny voice speaks up.Whitey (again Sandler) is the town do-gooder. He has worked forever at the town recreation center with kids playing there since the days when Davey was learning his first jump shot. Whitey sees something in Davey that no one else does and takes a chance on him. He has him turned over to his custody and has him help at the center.But years of bitterness have left Davey hollow inside. He has no use for anyone. He treats everyone with disdain. He even goes so far as to admit that he hates himself. It isn't until he meets Jennifer, the girl of his dreams long ago, again and her son that he begins to even consider coming around.But as fate would have it, things continue to go from bad to worse until Davey makes the decision to leave town behind and make a run for it. On the night when Whitey hopes to earn the towns respect for the years he has given by receiving an award called the spirit patch, Davey hits the road knowing full well that it won't happen. While Whitey may give more to the town than the people realize, he is one of those faceless people that does it all and receives no praise. And if Davey leaves, it becomes just one more major disappointment in Whitey's life.Unless a Christmas miracle could take place.Now, while the plot of this movie seems quite simple that's because...well...it is. Surrounding the story of Davey and Whitey are the small tales of the rest of the townsfolk. The adventures and predicaments that the pair gets involved in as well as musical numbers fill it out as well. And what would a Sandler film be without tons of crude humor? If toilet humor (and in some cases here I mean that literally) offends or disgust you then this movie is not your cup of tea.While I enjoyed the comedy here as well as the animation and story beneath it all, I found that there was too much mean spirit running throughout for me to embrace it. The joy of the film does not come about until the final moments of the film, long after we have been bombarded with the cruelty over and over again. The ending does raise that warm fuzzy feeling inside but at what cost to get there?This is one movie that will have a hard time finding an audience. Most people over 12 aren't that interested in animated films. And those over 30 will not find the gross out humor all that great. But there are a few of us twisted people out there who will enjoy this one even if not making it a regular Christmas treat. Watching it once may be enough. But it is definitely for selective tastes.",3,SANDLER'S CHRISTMAS EXPRESS,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,3394,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'movies', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'made', 'date', 'Are', 'cinematic', 'treasures', 'Heck', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'more', 'fun', 'comedies', 'make', 'mind', 'expected', 'nothing', 'movie', 'even', 'animated', 'adventures', 'Sandler', 'character.What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'mish', 'mash', 'several', 'movie', 'styles', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'Sure', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'films', 'end', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'feelings', 'towards', 'sappy', 'movies', 'holidays', 'movie', 'see', 'review', 'ELF', '.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Davey', 'Sandler', 'who', 'town', 'jerk', 'Having', 'had', 'chance', 'make', 'something', 'life', 'tossed', 'aside', 'one', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'parents', 'died', 'way', 'watch', 'play', 'junior', 'league', 'basketball', 'game', 'Now', 'town', 'drunk', 'run', 'law', 'land', 'jail', 'kindly', 'tiny', 'voice', 'speaks', 'up.Whitey', 'again', 'Sandler', 'town', 'do-gooder', 'worked', 'forever', 'town', 'recreation', 'center', 'kids', 'playing', 'there', 'days', 'when', 'Davey', 'was', 'learning', 'first', 'jump', 'shot', 'Whitey', 'something', 'Davey', 'one', 'else', 'chance', 'turned', 'custody', 'help', 'center.But', 'years', 'bitterness', 'have', 'left', 'Davey', 'hollow', 'inside', 'use', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'disdain', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'admit', ""n't"", 'Jennifer', 'girl', 'dreams', 'long', 'ago', 'again', 'son', 'even', 'consider', 'coming', 'around.But', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'things', 'continue', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Davey', 'decision', 'leave', 'town', 'make', 'run', 'night', 'when', 'Whitey', 'earn', 'towns', 'respect', 'years', 'given', 'receiving', 'award', 'called', 'spirit', 'patch', 'Davey', 'road', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Whitey', 'may', 'give', 'more', 'town', 'people', 'realize', 'one', 'faceless', 'people', 'praise', 'Davey', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Whitey', 'life.Unless', 'Christmas', 'miracle', 'could', 'take', 'place.Now', 'plot', 'movie', 'quite', 'simple', 'well', 'Surrounding', 'story', 'Davey', 'Whitey', 'are', 'small', 'tales', 'rest', 'townsfolk', 'adventures', 'predicaments', 'pair', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'musical', 'numbers', 'fill', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'Sandler', 'film', 'be', 'tons', 'crude', 'humor', 'toilet', 'humor', 'cases', 'here', 'mean', 'literally', 'disgust', 'then', 'movie', 'not', 'cup', 'tea.While', 'enjoyed', 'comedy', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'story', 'beneath', 'found', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'mean', 'spirit', 'running', 'embrace', 'joy', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'bombarded', 'cruelty', 'over', 'again', 'ending', 'raise', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'inside', 'what', 'cost', 'get', 'there', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'audience', 'Most', 'people', '12', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'animated', 'films', '30', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'twisted', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'even', 'not', 'making', 'regular', 'Christmas', 'treat', 'Watching', 'once', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'definitely', 'selective', 'tastes']",N/A

The story isn't all slapstick and lowbrow humor, though. There's a moral to this story (you just have to look beyond the humor) which may be surprising. This movie is not without dirty humor, but I found it amusing (like the basketball scene with Sandler, the boy, the fat guy with the jockstrap, and the two guys who had been giving Sandler and the boy a hard time) and Whitey and his sister were amusing characters. Overall a funny movie and a decent addition to any Sandler collection.This is definitely NOT a movie for little kids. It's a cartoon, but this movie would go great on Adult Swim.

774121,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,B0000C8ROV,"M. Hind ""daria_m""","[2, 4]","I'm usually a supporter of Adam Sandler comedies, even if a lot of them are the same.  His films have innocent, escapist humor that just allows you to forget about your troubles and laugh at pratfalls.  This time, Sandler dabbles in animation, and it unfortunately does not achieve the same effect as his live-action comedies.Sandler voices the three main characters in this cartoon:  a grumpy criminal prankster named Davey, a tiny and kindhearted old man named Whitey, and Whitey's crazy wig-wearing sister Eleanor.  Davey actually looks and sounds like Sandler himself, while the brother and sister duo have the most grating voices possible and wacky appearances.  This could annoy you so much that you may want to turn the movie off...I almost did.The plot is unimportant because gross-out humor and mean-spirited jokes take precedent in this film, but I will explain it anyway.  Davey goes around town terrorizing people until his crimes catch up with him: he knocks down huge Menorah and Santa ice sculptures.  The town judge sentences him to be supervised by Whitey, who plans to get him involved in a youth basketball program to turn his life around.  It turns out that a tragedy from Davey's past is what has caused his bitterness towards the holidays, and this topic is finally explored after much mayhem and many gags.It only has a few truly funny moments, and it is overwhelmed with product placement ad nauseum in a mall sequence.  It kind of makes you wonder if all of those advertising fees were necessary to get this film produced in the first place.  It's artistic and comic merit alone are simply not enough.  This movie is pretty pointless and misdirected towards a younger audience.  Parents be warned:  the movie earns every ounce of the PG-13 rating.  It has naughty language, innuendo, and plenty of humor centering around excrement.The Sandler purist may love this film and see it for the sometimes strange and sickening comedy it is.  For me, it was just not as funny as I expected.

774128,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000C8ROV,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","""Eight Crazy Nights"" is like an animated holiday special as it might be envisioned and conceived by the Farrelly Brothers - rude, crude, vulgar, yet surprisingly conformist in its values and themes.The people actually responsible for the film are director Seth Kearsley, and writers Brooks Arthur, Allen Covert, Brad Isaacs and Adam Sandler.  Sandler also provides the voice for the lead character, Davey Stone, a 30-something curmudgeon who hates the holidays and goes out of his way to ruin them for everyone else.  As a public menace, Davey finds himself assigned by court order to assist a sweet, but addled septuagenarian who coaches a youth basketball team.Part of the fun of ""Eight Crazy Nights"" comes from the strange dichotomy between the film's crude humor and the picture postcard small town setting.  This film looks like every Christmas special ever made, yet when the characters open their mouths...well, all I can say is that ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" or ""Frosty the Snowman"" this ain't.  Some people may be offended by the antics contained in this film, and it is certainly not recommended viewing for very small children.  But the film is really no worse in tone than the average Sandler comedy and the humor is nothing that every prepubescent boy hasn't heard or even indulged in himself (though the scatological sequences involving some deer are a bit much).  In fact, one of the criticisms that can be leveled against the film is that it really isn't raunchy enough, that it wants to have it both ways.  It wants to come across as a daring and iconoclastic image-buster, yet it can't resist employing the very same heart tugs that virtually all other holiday films employ and which this film is supposed to be a reaction against.  Unlike, say, ""South Park,"" which makes no concessions to sentimentality, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" loses its nerve and becomes just another warm-hearted and cuddly holiday-themed film at the end.  That's too bad because we really could use a corrosive tonic long about this time of the year.  After all who decreed that all holiday films had to be pure sweetness and light?  Isn't running over grandma with a reindeer also a holiday tradition?Still, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" does have some very shrewd, very clever, very funny moments contained within it, enough to almost compensate for the conventional gooey ending - and it does a nice job parodying the musical interludes generally found in more conventional Disney-type animated features as well.  Moreover, ""Eight Crazy Nights"" has historical significance in that it is the first movie I can remember in which Chanukah achieves equal billing with Christmas.  That's a long overdue correction, I must say, although I'm just not sure that Jewish mothers quite had this in mind when they envisioned it finally happening.

I'm not Jewish, but if I were I think I'd be pretty offended by this attempt by Adam Sandler to milk the holiday to add a few more bucks to his pile of money.  This movie consists entirely of cheap humor and even cheaper sentimentality, making no effort to actually earn a laugh or any real emotion.  I chuckled mildly about three times during this movie, and I think that may have been because I was bored.  I'm not some snob who only likes ""intellectual"" movies either; I've actually enjoyed every other Sandler movie except for the equally atrocious ""The Waterboy.""  But this drivel is just completely worthless.  All those affiliated with this movie should be beaten sharply about the heads and shoulders with blunt objects at the earliest possible convenience.  Oh, and the original Hanukkah song stopped being funny about four years ago, so the third version tacked onto the end of this snoozathon isn't helping matters.",1,Oh good god no...,1040083200,"12 17, 2002",2002,1217,"['try', 'REALLY', 'hard', 'not', 'write', 'negative', 'reviews', 'site', 'realize', 'things', 'music', 'movies', 'are', 'subjective', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'criticizing', 'such', 'things', 'much', 'debate', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'case', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'absolutely', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jewish', 'were', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'offended', 'attempt', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'milk', 'holiday', 'add', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'pile', 'money', 'movie', 'entirely', 'cheap', 'humor', 'even', 'cheaper', 'sentimentality', 'making', 'effort', 'actually', 'earn', 'laugh', 'real', 'emotion', 'chuckled', 'mildly', 'three', 'times', 'movie', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'bored', ""'m"", 'not', 'snob', 'who', 'only', 'intellectual', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'equally', 'atrocious', 'Waterboy', 'drivel', 'just', 'completely', 'worthless', 'affiliated', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'beaten', 'sharply', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'blunt', 'objects', 'earliest', 'possible', 'convenience', 'Oh', 'original', 'Hanukkah', 'song', 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'third', 'version', 'tacked', 'end', 'snoozathon', ""n't"", 'helping', 'matters']",N/A

I think that's what makes them funny; the crude humor. That's the problem with the movies coming out for kids lately: they're very lowbrow and cheesy. This is an animated movie that reaches more toward the teenage audience with a liking for bathroom-type humor and Adam Sandler's genius. A very memorable part from the movie for me is when Whitey was cleaning an outhouse for a dollar and Davey pushes it down a hill. Whitey emerges from the outhouse covered in human sewage and Davey then appears with a hose and sprays Whitey until he's a frozen block of crap.

774138,AYOLDSNPONSEE,B0000C8ROV,"""xxblacklabelsocietyxx""","[3, 5]","As you know... this is probably one of the most hated movies ever... and why is that?? Because these days, people just want to see boring, crappy romantic comedy junk like &quot;Love Actually&quot; and &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot;..... Well I don't care about the negative reviews, I loved this movie and I'll admit that I bought it and I've watched it to the point where I know every song by heart :)I think this movie is somewhat similar to &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (another hillarious film that is worth seeing), in that it deals with a drunk no-life loser who just CANT STAND the holidays AT ALL (much like me,,, seeing &amp; hearing Christmas stuff everywhere gets SO incredibly annoying!)  This is a hillarious story of a &quot;crazy 33-year-old Jewish guy&quot; who always has to do bad things to the town during the holidays, especially on the first night of Hanukkah,, and there's a reason why he's this way,, and he just keeps seeming to run from admitting that reason...(I won't tell you what it is, dont wanna ruin it :)This movie has great voices by Sandler of course, and Rob Schnieder is great as the narrator and the Chinese waiter... Also I love all the songs, especially &quot;I Hate Love, I Hate You, I Hate Me&quot;, &quot;Technical Foul&quot;, and &quot;Let It Out, Davey&quot;Believe it or not this movie DOES have a good messege behind it-actually a few- one is that you shouldn't run from your emotions, and the other is that the most ignored people can do the nicest things (which goes so for Whitey, the old man who helps Davey)I would say that this &amp; &quot;Bad Santa&quot; are 2 great movies to slap the &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; holiday season junk in the face, and if you can't appreciate this kind of humor, then go watch some Julia Roberts movie or some teenybopper movie like &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;!!!!!",5,oh whatever....
