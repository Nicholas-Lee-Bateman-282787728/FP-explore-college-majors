Despite all the noise and the chasing and the running and the doping, viewer boredom predominates.

1678782,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00GM5GLDW,D. Holmes,"[5, 8]","Critics tore this film limb from limb almost without exception, but I found it to be an engaging and neat experience despite or, in certain cases, because of its imperfections.  The film opens with the inglorious hospital-bed death of the mother of the title character, played by Shia LaBeouf in a further bid to move away from his prior child-star status.  Moments later, the ghost of the mother (or a manifestation of his imagination) tells him he should travel to Romania, and he does.  Why not?  This grim absurdity sets the tone for a film which sways with mad abandon from the comic to the magical to the tragic to the good old-fashioned violent.  On the plane, the charming older gentleman seated next to him dies mid-flight, which leads Charlie to his beautiful and fragile daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), with whom he falls in love, a bond complicated by her prior union with a jealous and volatile gangster (Mads Mikkelsen).Designed as Fear and Loathing in Bucharest for Generation Y, the film is honestly a bit daft:  it is beholden to its flights of fantasy and its Wonderland indebted version of logic, and it finds its way to its actual &#34;storyline,&#34; involving two criminals' pursuit of an incriminating videotape, over an hour in.  Yet the performances are persuasive:  LaBeouf, anxious and earnest and exploding with both grief and romantic longing, is an engaging anchor, while Evan Rachel Wood exudes the type of melancholic elegance and potent sexuality required to convince the audience men could go to war for her hand.  And the scene stealing Mikkelsen is as magnetic and menacing as ever; in his most fiery moments here, he is truly frightening and unpredictable in a way screen antagonists too rarely are.  The film also won my admiration with its sense of psychedelic style and propulsive pace.  Simply put, it is cool:  cool to hear, cool to see, and cool to lose oneself in.  The hypnotic music, including a perfectly utilized cut by the xx, and atmospheric on-location-in-Bucharest photography grip the viewer, or at least did this viewer, and compensate for any auctorial shortcomings.",4,Fear and Loathing in Bucharest,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,2118,"['Critics', 'tore', 'film', 'limb', 'limb', 'almost', 'exception', 'found', 'be', 'engaging', 'neat', 'experience', 'certain', 'cases', 'imperfections', 'film', 'inglorious', 'hospital-bed', 'death', 'mother', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'further', 'bid', 'move', 'away', 'prior', 'child-star', 'status', 'Moments', 'later', 'ghost', 'mother', 'manifestation', 'imagination', 'should', 'travel', 'Romania', 'Why', 'not', 'grim', 'absurdity', 'tone', 'film', 'mad', 'abandon', 'comic', 'magical', 'tragic', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'violent', 'plane', 'charming', 'older', 'gentleman', 'seated', 'next', 'mid-flight', 'Charlie', 'beautiful', 'fragile', 'daughter', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'whom', 'love', 'bond', 'complicated', 'prior', 'union', 'jealous', 'volatile', 'gangster', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', '.Designed', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Bucharest', 'Generation', 'Y', 'film', 'honestly', 'bit', 'daft', 'beholden', 'flights', 'fantasy', 'Wonderland', 'indebted', 'version', 'logic', 'way', 'actual', '34', 'storyline', '34', 'involving', 'two', 'criminals', 'pursuit', 'incriminating', 'videotape', 'hour', 'performances', 'are', 'persuasive', 'LaBeouf', 'anxious', 'earnest', 'exploding', 'grief', 'romantic', 'longing', 'engaging', 'anchor', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'type', 'melancholic', 'elegance', 'potent', 'sexuality', 'required', 'convince', 'audience', 'men', 'could', 'go', 'war', 'hand', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Mikkelsen', 'magnetic', 'menacing', 'ever', 'most', 'fiery', 'moments', 'here', 'truly', 'frightening', 'unpredictable', 'way', 'screen', 'antagonists', 'too', 'rarely', 'are', 'film', 'also', 'won', 'admiration', 'sense', 'psychedelic', 'style', 'propulsive', 'pace', 'Simply', 'put', 'cool', 'cool', 'hear', 'cool', 'see', 'cool', 'lose', 'hypnotic', 'music', 'including', 'perfectly', 'utilized', 'cut', 'xx', 'atmospheric', 'on-location-in-Bucharest', 'photography', 'grip', 'viewer', 'least', 'did', 'viewer', 'compensate', 'auctorial', 'shortcomings']",Charlie Countryman
1678783,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00GM5GLDW,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","Charlie, a guy with relationship problems, is told by his dying mother to move to Bucharest. She does not explain why: That's something he has to discover for himself. And he does.If this film were as good as its themes, it would be truly great. CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN is all about life and love, how rough they can be, and how valuable the good moments in both really are. It's about searching. It's also about death and how maybe it ain't so terrible after all. Unfortunately, the script is more of a mockery than real people really talking, and the storyline, well. . .the combination of draggy repetition with lots of mob violence and unconvincing chase scenes just doesn't work. So much of what happens between the beginning and end seems like directionless filler. Still, a very nice ending that, at least for some, will make CC worth sitting through, kinda-sorta, perhaps.A few other observations:--Good acting by Shia LaBeouf, Evan Rachel Wood, and Melissa Leo. The fact that many of the characters are fairly plain people, not Hollywood hotties, is a nice touch.--Strange combination of ethereal, dreamy soundtrack combined with dark, often flippant, ultra-violent romantic comedy.--Very narrow scope that will inevitably limit this film's mass appeal. In the end, CC's lesser qualities only serve to make its interesting premise and other various stronger qualities all-the-more disappointing.--CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN does not give a very flattering portrayal of Bucharest and Romania in general.",3,"""If you can find me tomorrow, I will kiss you""",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1498,"['Charlie', 'guy', 'relationship', 'problems', 'told', 'dying', 'mother', 'move', 'Bucharest', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'something', 'discover', 'film', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'themes', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'great', 'CHARLIE', 'COUNTRYMAN', 'life', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'valuable', 'good', 'moments', 'really', 'are', 'searching', 'also', 'about', 'death', 'how', 'maybe', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'terrible', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'more', 'mockery', 'real', 'people', 'really', 'talking', 'storyline', 'well', '.the', 'combination', 'draggy', 'repetition', 'lots', 'mob', 'violence', 'unconvincing', 'chase', 'scenes', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'So', 'much', 'what', 'beginning', 'end', 'directionless', 'filler', 'Still', 'very', 'nice', 'ending', 'least', 'will', 'make', 'CC', 'worth', 'sitting', 'kinda-sorta', 'perhaps.A', 'few', 'other', 'observations', 'Good', 'acting', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'fact', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'plain', 'people', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'hotties', 'nice', 'touch.', 'Strange', 'combination', 'ethereal', 'dreamy', 'soundtrack', 'combined', 'dark', 'often', 'flippant', 'ultra-violent', 'romantic', 'comedy.', 'Very', 'narrow', 'scope', 'will', 'inevitably', 'limit', 'film', 'mass', 'appeal', 'end', 'CC', 'lesser', 'qualities', 'only', 'serve', 'make', 'interesting', 'premise', 'other', 'various', 'stronger', 'qualities', 'all-the-more', 'disappointing.', 'CHARLIE', 'COUNTRYMAN', 'not', 'give', 'very', 'flattering', 'portrayal', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'general']",Charlie Countryman
1678784,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00GM5GLDW,.fgd,"[0, 1]",It is beautifully shot in Budapest. Great camera work. Everything works;  watchable and promising enough in a quirky way as Charlie romances his fallen beau cellist. The two crazy British ravers lightened and entertained for a while. Enter Mads Mikkellson as the jealous husband and it became hard to find any chemistry between Charlie and Gabbi. Mads Mikkellson had too much screen presence and was too much man. Dont tell me she was turned up-side down by her american toy-boy who later gets beat up by gangsters and Nigel himself but neverthe less grows iron balls and keeps throwing himself at the &#34;baseball bat&#34; intended for his cute face. A far more interesting story would have been centred on Nigel's angst. There was a tender lover buried inside a thug- vampire from the love she gave him once. But this story was missing from the film while we are expected to believe a guy much weaker than herself could rock her boat in bed ever.Three stars for setting the film in Budapest which was interesting and the fabulous Mads Mikkellson.

1678785,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GM5GLDW,FNDNreview,"[3, 9]","Have you ever had one of those nostalgic feelings during the opening moments of a movie that give you the false impression that you&#8217;re about to witness a masterpiece?  Charlie Countryman is one of those films.  Describing a movie that leaves you speechless is no easy task, so you&#8217;re forced to reflect carefully on what you&#8217;ve just witnessed.  To that end, I&#8217;ve come to the safe conclusion that Charlie Countryman, helmed by first time director Fredrik Bond, is an intrinsic experience that&#8217;s mostly unsure of itself and its intentions.  This lifeless thriller has shades of brilliance, but mostly it&#8217;s an all-encompassing, dark generic tale that &#8211; for reasons beyond comprehension &#8211; reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s easily forgettable post-Titanic flick, The Beach.When we first meet Charlie Countryman (Shia LaBeouf), he&#8217;s bloodied, battered, and hanging upside down from a bridge.  A gun discharges and suddenly Charlie is popping out of his bath tub and on his way to the hospital to witness his mother being taken off life support.  He quickly becomes uncomfortable and makes a beeline for the hospital hallway, only to be visited by his deceased mother (Melissa Leo).  From the word go, Charlie is clearly an emotionally distraught young man, but is he mentally deranged, too?  Sadly, the reasoning behind his visit from the dead is never acknowledged, initially giving the film a supernatural feel, which quickly and unequivocally falls by the wayside.  This film even pokes fun at its incorporation of ghosts by making a comical reference to The Sixth Sense (that &#8220;I see dead people&#8221; movie starring Bruce Willis).His tale is of the preordained variety, meaning two characters set the course for Charlie&#8217;s not-so-distant future.  Initially a resident of Chicago, Charlie picks up with nothing and moves to Bucharest, Romania, (no, not Budapest) where another timely death intertwines him with the film&#8217;s conflicted and troubled love interest, Gabi (Evan Rachel Wood).  For the duration of this film, Charlie makes abundantly clear that his sole intention is to be a creature of love &#8211; yes, like a fundamentally challenged hippie (which he also looks like).  Still, the clich&eacute;d resemblance of a reimagined version of Romeo & Juliet is alive and well in this film, minus the bickering family members.  Instead, it&#8217;s Gabi&#8217;s dangerous and dastardly husband that continuously causes grief in Charlie&#8217;s journey to a bliss-filled state of love.The villain of the story, Gabi&#8217;s husband, Nigel &#8211; portrayed admirably by Mads Mikkelssen, is one of the few superlative characters in the fray.  Mikkelssen is a talented, yet seemingly restricted actor that is born to play the role of the bad guy (check out Casino Royale if you don&#8217;t believe me).  This guy literally strikes fear with a simple, harmless glance &#8211; but still uses his uncontrollable temper to throw Charlie around from time to time.  The other half of the villainy in this film is from a character simply called Darko &#8211; portrayed by Til Schweiger.  Just like his name suggests, he&#8217;s a dreary, calculating individual that manages a strip club manager, which eventually ties to both Gabi and Nigel.  Although he appears to be on even footing with Nigel, he does little more than play the role of the underling enforcer.  Still, Mikkelssen and Schweiger prove to be an entertaining, all-be-it one-dimensional tandem.Thus, we are only left to discuss the main man himself, Shia LaBeouf &#8211; who continuously manages to snag leading roles.  The good news is he doesn&#8217;t seem as sniveling as in the majority of his roles.  Most of us recognize LaBeouf from his irksome leading role in the Transformers trilogy &#8211; a role that no doubt is his acting legacy.  As much as I&#8217;d love to knock his portrayal of Charlie Countyman, I honestly cannot.  There are still portions of this film that I whole headedly despise.  I suppose it might have something to do with the fact that LaBeouf is actually tripping on acid while his character is also tripping on acid.  I thought actors are supposed to be able to act out these scenes?  Regardless, LaBeouf is the undersized underdog &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard not to relate to this character.Charlie&#8217;s story is a bit ridiculous in the sense that he appears to be nothing more than some average guy, at least until he&#8217;s thrust into a world of gangster-fueled mayhem.  He&#8217;s chasing the forbidden fruit (another man&#8217;s wife), even though all odds are against him to make it work.  What exactly does he offer this girl?  Nothing is the answer.  There&#8217;s absolutely nothing.  However, the most interesting premise of this story is the cleverness of Charlie and Gabi finding one another by mutual deaths within their family.  Still, their chemistry is anything but believable and noticeably forced.  This film has the right idea, but there&#8217;s far too much clutter and randomness to drive home the true intentions of this story.Up until the climax, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to figure out where in the world this story is taking us.  After an evening in the club, Charlie and his new-found bunk mates, Carl &#8211; portrayed by Harry Potter alum Rupert Grint, and Luke &#8211; portrayed by James Buckley, get some surprising hilarious trouble.  Oddly enough, the trouble stems from Grint&#8217;s character taking five or six Viagra pills.  Did I mention his character&#8217;s ambition in life is to become a porn star?  Anyway, after this particular clubbing experience, the wheels fully come off the bus, and the direction of this film rapidly shifts directions.  One minute this film is all about death and love, and the next it&#8217;s about murder and a rather damaging video &#8211; that&#8217;s shrewdly disguised as a Chicago Cubs World Series victory tape.  That&#8217;s right, this randomly picks on the Cubs not once, but in a few difference scenes.  I suppose that fits in perfectly here since this film is one of the most randomly put together films I&#8217;ve seen in quite some time.In the end, Charlie Countryman suffers from cinematic bipolar disorder.  From scene to scene, there&#8217;s no telling what you&#8217;re going to get.  Spiritual implications are at the forefront and then quickly move to the back-burner.  Love is in the air, but the chemistry is missing.  Finally, it becomes about sacrifice &#8211; but how much sacrifice is this confusing Charlie character willing to give?  Is love worth giving his life for?  And, if you think all of this sounds confusing, then this film will blow your mind &#8211; but not in a compelling manner.  The original title of this film was The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman, which poses the only real question:  does Charlie live or does he die?  Trust me, it doesn&#8217;t matter one way or the other.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",2,"'Charlie Countryman' silly, incredibly disorganized",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,6988,"['Have', 'ever', 'had',

The original title of this little adventure in Bucharest was THE NECESSARY DEATH OF CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN: they should have stuck with that.Charlie (Shi LaBeouf) is a scruffy sad e-eyed lad who at his mother's (Melissa Leo) deathbed with her current paramour Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio - in only a few minutes of inconsequential screen time): mother dies, but appears in a vision extracting a promise for Charlie to go to Bucharest to mend his grief.  Charlie hops on a plane, sits next to an old Romanian Victor (Ion Caramitru) with whom he bonds before Victor dies in flight: another vision - Victor asks Charlie to deliver a silly hat to his daughter Gabi (Evan Rachel Wood) in Bucharest. Once Charlie is in Bucharest, having survived airport investigation, he gets conflicting data from a taxi driver (Gabriel Spahiu) and is delivered to a youth hostel where he shares a room with tow losers - Karl (Rupert Grint) and Luc (James Buckley) - who introduce him to Ecstasy. Charlie is already on the bad side of the crime world for wanting to deliver Victor's gift to Gabi and is at the mercy of Nigel (Mads Mikkelsen) and Darko (Til Schweiger) who are covering up some criminal problem. Charlie meets Gabi, a cellist with the Bucharest Opera who happens to be married to Nigel, and of course he falls in love beginning an endless chase sequence by the mob that involves Gabi, Nigel, Darko and assorted thugs. The ending is in the original title....maybe....A great movie this is not, but its twisted plot, incorporation of visions from the dead, and brisk action captured in a very strange but exciting light by cinematographer Roman Vasyanov and a strange atmospheric musical score by Christophe Beck keep the movie intriguing. And it is tough to cast Mads Mikkelsen, Til Schweiger, Melissa Leo, and yes, Shia LaBeouf and Evan Rachel Wood and not expect to see some moments of excellent acting. As an evening's diversion, given the fact that it is the initial outing by both director and writer, it is worth watching.

1678791,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00GM5GLDW,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","I've never been a fan of Shia LaBeouf. I've never hated him either. For me he's just been there on the fringes of good movies, never a name I would associate with mega-stardom. I'm beginning to think that this may be the case for him the rest of his career. He's begun to try and make himself out to be edgy with his choices in roles and his antics in the public eye. This being a review you might wonder why I mention it. I do so because all of those things combine to take away from what might be a good actor trying to do good work. If he would just bypass all the hullabaloo that goes with being an actor and stick to performing he could become a star.CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN features LaBeouf as the title character, a young man whose mother has just died and who seems to have no idea what to do with his life. But Charlie also has a unique gift that he doesn't tell anyone about. Much like the child in THE SIXTH SENSE, Charlie can see dead people moments after they perish. In the hospital he sees his mother talking to him in the hallway and telling him he should take time to travel and see Bucharest. Sensing that this is his fate, Charlie follows her suggestion.On the plane to Bucharest Charlie is seated next to Victor, a Bucharest native returning from seeing his much loved Chicago Cubs play baseball. They strike up a conversation and immediate friendship with Victor showing Charlie the gift he has for his daughter. Both doze off and Charlie wakes to find Victor deceased and lying on his shoulder. Then he begins a last conversation with the now dead Victor who gives him a message to pass along to his daughter.At the airport Charlie is questioned by the police and then released. He meets Victor's daughter Gabi (Evan Rachel Wood), a cellist in the Bucharest symphony, and passes along the message Victor asked him to. For Charlie it is love at first site. He tries to get closer to her, eventually tracking her down to where she performs. It is obvious there is a mutual attraction but their conversation is interrupted by Gabi's ex-husband Nigel (Mads Mikkelson), a sadistic criminal who continues to force himself into her life.Given instructions on how to reach a local youth hostel to stay in, Charlie arrives and meets his two roommates Karl (Rupert Gint) and Luc (James Buckley), complete goofballs who are more interested in being wasted than anything else. After slipping Charlie some ecstasy the trio hits a strip club where Karl is hoping to find release from the 4 Viagra tabs he took. Unfortunately for him he does which the proprietor of the establishment, Darko (Til Schweiger) charges a lot extra for. When he notices Charlie eyeing a picture on the wall that has both Gabi and Nigel in it, he offers them a chance to pay up with something other than cash. He wants Charlie to bring Nigel to him.From there the movie moves along what could have been a predictable path but one that takes a few twists and turns along the way. Charlie must reach out to Gabi in the hopes that he can actually have her for his own but at the same time he must seek her help in taking Nigel to Darko. Nigel, a full blown psychopath, will obviously do all he can to make sure he this doesn't happen if he finds out. Can Charlie convince her to help him? Can the two of them find love in this dark and dangerous place?While the ability to talk to dead people plays some important moments in his life, the movie doesn't focus on that and instead focuses on Charlie and the love he finds. LaBeouf does a good job here as Charlie, a young man way out of his league in terms of what is going on around him. Wood as Gabi does a fine job as well even though numerous critics have said the part should have been played by a Romanian. For my money she does fine. Standing out though is Mikkelson who exudes charm and sophistication on one hand and terrifying murderous intent on the other. I can't remember an actor doing this this easily since Robert Mitchum in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.This may not have been a box office hit, it might not have even played in your neighborhood, but it is a film that's worth picking up and watching. Some scenes may make it a movie you won't want to add to your collection but it will offer an interesting, though definitely adult, story.",3,BAD NEWS FOR BUCHAREST TOURISM,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4271,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', ""'ve"", 'never', 'hated', 'either', 'just', 'been', 'there', 'fringes', 'good', 'movies', 'never', 'name', 'would', 'associate', 'mega-stardom', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'rest', 'career', 'begun', 'try', 'make', 'be', 'edgy', 'choices', 'roles', 'antics', 'public', 'eye', 'being', 'review', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'mention', 'do', 'so', 'things', 'combine', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'actor', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'would', 'just', 'bypass', 'hullabaloo', 'being', 'actor', 'stick', 'performing', 'could', 'become', 'star.CHARLIE', 'COUNTRYMAN', 'LaBeouf', 'title', 'character', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'Charlie', 'also', 'unique', 'gift', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'Much', 'child', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'Charlie', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'moments', 'perish', 'hospital', 'mother', 'talking', 'hallway', 'telling', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'travel', 'see', 'Bucharest', 'Sensing', 'fate', 'Charlie', 'suggestion.On', 'plane', 'Bucharest', 'Charlie', 'seated', 'next', 'Victor', 'Bucharest', 'native', 'returning', 'seeing', 'much', 'loved', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'play', 'baseball', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'immediate', 'friendship', 'Victor', 'showing', 'Charlie', 'gift', 'daughter', 'doze', 'Charlie', 'wakes', 'find', 'Victor', 'deceased', 'lying', 'shoulder', 'Then', 'last', 'conversation', 'now', 'dead', 'Victor', 'who', 'message', 'pass', 'daughter.At', 'airport', 'Charlie', 'questioned', 'police', 'then', 'released', 'Victor', 'daughter', 'Gabi', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'cellist', 'Bucharest', 'symphony', 'passes', 'message', 'Victor', 'asked', 'Charlie', 'love', 'first', 'site', 'get', 'closer', 'eventually', 'tracking', 'down', 'where', 'obvious', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'conversation', 'interrupted', 'Gabi', 'ex-husband', 'Nigel', 'Mads', 'Mikkelson', 'sadistic', 'criminal', 'who', 'force', 'life.Given', 'instructions', 'how', 'reach', 'local', 'youth', 'hostel', 'stay', 'Charlie', 'two', 'roommates', 'Karl', 'Rupert', 'Gint', 'Luc', 'James', 'Buckley', 'complete', 'goofballs', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'wasted', 'anything', 'else', 'slipping', 'Charlie', 'ecstasy', 'trio', 'strip', 'club', 'where', 'Karl', 'hoping', 'find', 'release', '4', 'Viagra', 'tabs', 'took', 'Unfortunately', 'proprietor', 'establishment', 'Darko', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'lot', 'extra', 'When', 'Charlie', 'eyeing', 'picture', 'wall', 'Gabi', 'Nigel', 'chance', 'pay', 'up', 'something', 'other', 'cash', 'Charlie', 'bring', 'Nigel', 'him.From', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'predictable', 'path', 'one', 'few', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'Charlie', 'must', 'reach', 'out', 'Gabi', 'hopes', 'can', 'actually', 'have', 'own', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'seek', 'help', 'taking', 'Nigel', 'Darko', 'Nigel', 'full', 'blown', 'psychopath', 'will', 'obviously', 'do', 'can', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'happen', 'out', 'Can', 'Charlie', 'convince', 'help', 'Can', 'two', 'find', 'love', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'place', 'ability', 'talk', 'dead', 'people', 'important', 'moments', 'life', 'movie', ""n't"", 'focus', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Charlie', 'love', 'LaBeouf', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'Charlie', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'league', 'terms', 'what', 'going', 'Wood', 'Gabi', 'fine', 'job', 'well', 'even', 'numerous', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Romanian', 'money', 'fine', 'Standing', 'out', 'Mikkelson', 'who', 'charm', 'sophistication', 'one', 'hand', 'terrifying', 'murderous', 'intent', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'actor', 'doing', 'easily', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'HUNTER.This', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'played', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'watching', 'scenes', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'will', 'offer', 'interesting', 'definitely', 'adult', 'story']",Charlie Countryman
1678792,A3OJERVDCVKUGL,B00GM5GLDW,"M Marsh ""Mermarsh""","[2, 2]","A short review that is currently on the front page of this listing suggests astutely that a film about the love affair between Mads Mikkelsen's very charismatic bad boy and the cello-playing good-girl heroine would have been great fun to watch.  Instead we have the tedium of Shia LaBeouf oh so implausibly bumbling around Bucharest and fumbling his way into the aforementioned girl's heart.  Which speaks to the hopelessly lopsided nature of this movie, in which Mikkelsen is asked to play a heartthrob of a gangster who is explicitly called ""the most beautiful man /she/ had ever seen"" by the heroine, while poor Shia LaBeouf is stuck with playing a character who reminded me of a nerdy boy constantly mistaking a video game for reality.  He should have stuck to his PlayStation.  Despite his undoubted good looks, it is by no means the case that Mads Mikkelsen normally chooses to play sexy or romantic leads, but here, no two ways about it, he is intended to be drop dead glamorous, and although the script also indicates that he is a bad dude, we never SEE him being bad in any way that matters to us.  So naturally any viewer still possessed of an ounce of sexuality, male or female, aches to see vastly more of him on the screen, because that's just the nature of movies.  Instead, however, we have pitifully little of him while we're stuck with scene after scene of Shia stumbling, bumbling, or mumbling outworn romantic clich&eacute;s.  Which leaves us to wonder what on earth is wrong with this heroine.  Does she want a green card that badly, is that her motivation?  Because she is not provided with any other.  I have nothing against LaBeouf as such.  The only other time I've ever seen him was as the male ing&eacute;nue in Lawless, a great film in which he was just fine, so when I read that he wanted to ""change his image,"" I assumed that meant no more ingenues.  And to be fair, his IMAGE here, in the literal sense of the word, is different; now he looks like a skinny character actor with hair sprouting in unfortunate places.  But he is still definitely playing the ing&eacute;nue, far too naive and downright dumb to be called a leading man -- indeed, far more nave than the girl he is presuming to rescue.  Most of the fault for all of this lopsidedness lies with the script, which is ocassionally funny but mostly just silly.  But the rest of the fault is probably a pitfall of Indie films in general.  How could a casting director say no to LaBeouf, who is a ""name,"" after all?  And HOW could the same director say no to Mads Mikkelsen, who is by now an internationally respected actor?  Yet so skilled is Mikkelsen in the scene-stealing role assigned to him that it's impossible to imagine any actor but a very few, very handsome, very expensive movie stars holding their own against him, and that group would NOT include Shia LeBeouf.  So while the movie has a few amusing moments and some very nice footage of Bucharest, a city most of us will never visit, I would still advise that it's not worth the time.",2,Hopelessly Lopsided,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,3034,"['short', 'review', 'currently', 'front', 'page', 'listing', 'astutely', 'film', 'love', 'affair', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'very', 'charismatic', 'bad', 'boy', 'cello-playing', 'good-girl', 'heroine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Instead', 'have', 'tedium', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'oh', 'so', 'implausibly', 'bumbling', 'Bucharest', 'fumbling', 'way', 'aforementioned', 'girl', 'heart', 'hopelessly', 'lopsided', 'nature', 'movie', 'Mikkelsen', 'asked', 'play', 'heartthrob', 'gangster', 'who', 'explicitly', 'called', 'most', 'beautiful', 'man', '/she/', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'heroine', 'poor', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'stuck', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'reminded', 'nerdy', 'boy', 'constantly', 'mistaking', 'video', 'game', 'reality', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'PlayStation', 'undoubted', 'good', 'looks', 'case', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'normally', 'play', 'sexy', 'romantic', 'leads', 'here', 'two', 'ways', 'intended', 'be', 'drop', 'dead', 'glamorous', 'script', 'also', 'bad', 'dude', 'never', 'SEE', 'being', 'bad', 'way', 'matters', 'So', 'naturally', 'viewer', 'still', 'possessed', 'ounce', 'sexuality', 'male', 'female', 'aches', 'see', 'vastly', 'more', 'screen', 'just', 'nature', 'movies', 'Instead', 'however', 'have', 'pitifully', 'little', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'scene', 'scene', 'Shia', 'stumbling', 'bumbling', 'mumbling', 'outworn', 'romantic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Which', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'wrong', 'heroine', 'want', 'green', 'card', 'badly', 'motivation', 'not', 'provided', 'other', 'have', 'nothing', 'LaBeouf', 'such', 'only', 'other', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'male', 'ing', 'eacute', 'Lawless', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'when', 'read', 'wanted', 'change', 'image', 'assumed', 'meant', 'more', 'ingenues', 'be', 'fair', 'IMAGE', 'here', 'literal', 'sense', 'word', 'different', 'now', 'skinny', 'character', 'actor', 'hair', 'sprouting', 'unfortunate', 'places', 'still', 'definitely', 'playing', 'ing', 'eacute', 'far', 'too', 'naive', 'downright', 'dumb', 'be', 'called', 'leading', 'man', 'indeed', 'far', 'more', 'nave', 'girl', 'presuming', 'rescue', 'Most', 'fault', 'lopsidedness', 'script', 'ocassionally', 'funny', 'mostly', 'just', 'silly', 'rest', 'fault', 'probably', 'pitfall', 'Indie', 'films', 'general', 'How', 'could', 'casting', 'director', 'say', 'LaBeouf', 'who', 'name', 'HOW', 'could', 'same', 'director', 'say', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'now', 'internationally', 'respected', 'actor', 'so', 'skilled', 'Mikkelsen', 'scene-stealing', 'role', 'assigned', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'actor', 'very', 'few', 'very', 'handsome', 'very', 'expensive', 'movie', 'stars', 'holding', 'own', 'group', 'would', 'NOT', 'include', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'So', 'movie', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'very', 'nice', 'footage', 'Bucharest', 'city', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'visit', 'would', 'still', 'advise', 'not', 'time']",Charlie Countryman

In a dream (hallucination?) shortly after she passes away, he asks her what he should to next, and she tells him &#34;Go to Bucharest&#34;. Don't ask why (no explanation is given), but Charlie decides to take his mom's advice.On the flight over there he befriends Victor, who promptly dies in his sleep. Charlie arrives in Bucharest and gets to know Victor's daughter Gabi (played by Evan Rachel Wood), and falls for her. Unfortunately for Charlie, Gabi is married to Nigel (played by Mads Mikkelsen), a crazy loose canon with ties to the mob. Meanwhile Charlie finds a place to stay at the Marco Polo youth hostel in Bucharest and befriends his two British room mates who have a liking for acid (yes, the drug). Can Charlie keep Gabi out of harm's way (from Nigel)? Will Gabi fall for Charlie? What becomes of the two room mates?To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, it seems that LaBeouf is trying hard to stay away from more Transformer-like predictable roles. Last year there was the excellent &#34;Lawless&#34;, and now this. On top of that, LaBeouf looks scrungy for most of the movie, I suppose to give his role an even more authentic feel. (Along the same lines, LaBeouf reportedly took acid for real to shoot the acid hallucination scene.) Unfortunately, none of that fixes the movie's subpar script, which has holes in it the size of Manhattan and doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a rom-com or an action/adventure movie. Second, Mads Mikkelsen is absolutely delightful as the crazed husband/crime guy. Third, I hardly recognized Evan Rachel Wood as the Romanian girl. She plays up the Eastern European accent on top of that. Last but certainly not least, except for the opening scenes (which take place in Chicago), the entire movie is shot on location in Bucharest. I've never seen the city look more beautiful than in this movie.Imagine my surprise when this movie opened on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati here this weekend, without any pre-release fanfare or advertising. I was in the mood for something different and took a chance on this so I went to see it last night. I got a quasi-private showing, as in: there was only one other person besides myself in the entire theatre. When that happens on a Friday evening of its opening weekend, you know a movie is commercially D.O.A. But despite its obvious flaws, I quite enjoyed this beautiful mess. If you are in the mood for something different than your standard Hollywood fare like Last Vegas or Bad Grandpa, &#34;Charlie Countryman&#34; is worth taking a chance on, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"3.5 stars...

1678795,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00GM5GLDW,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[0, 0]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Charlie Countryman&#8221; [Romania, 2013]1. The original title of the movie (and the title that appears onscreen) is &#8220;The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman&#8221;.2. For some reason, mainstream critics tore this movie apart, perhaps because it denies easy classification. I don&#8217;t know. Whatever the reason, it doesn&#8217;t deserve the hate that was heaped on it.3. It&#8217;s kind of a violent, drug-fueled, romantic drama wrapped in magical realism.4. Shia LaBeouf stars in it, and I think this may be his best performance ever. LaBoeuf plays Charlie, a depressed young man who has a tendency to talk to people even after they&#8217;re dead.5. Charlie&#8217;s dead mother tells him to take a trip to Bucharest, where he meets a cello player with a dead father and a psychotic husband. Charlie falls in love with her, and he gets drawn into her problems.6. The guy that played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter movies, Rupert Grint, does a good job here playing an over-eager druggie. He&#8217;s definitely not at Hogwarts anymore.7. The movie is bafflingly good at capturing that &#8220;damn-the-consequences-I&#8217;m-in-love&#8221; feeling that young people tend to fall into.8. The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly. The original score meshes well with tracks from Moby and M83 to keep the slightly hallucinatory, dreamy atmosphere going through the whole film.9. The ending wraps everything up a little too neatly, but this is an oddly beautiful film that needs to be better appreciated.",4,better than it's given credit for,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,1544,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Charlie', 'Countryman', '8221', '[', 'Romania', '2013', ']', '1', 'original', 'title', 'movie', 'title', 'onscreen', '8220', 'Necessary', 'Death', 'Charlie', 'Countryman', '8221', '.2', 'reason', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'movie', 'apart', 'perhaps', 'easy', 'classification', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'reason', '8217', 'deserve', 'hate', 'was', 'heaped', 'it.3', '8217', 'kind', 'violent', 'drug-fueled', 'romantic', 'drama', 'wrapped', 'magical', 'realism.4', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'LaBoeuf', 'Charlie', 'depressed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'tendency', 'talk', 'people', 'even', '8217', 're', 'dead.5', 'Charlie', '8217', 's', 'dead', 'mother', 'take', 'trip', 'Bucharest', 'where', 'cello', 'player', 'dead', 'father', 'psychotic', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'love', 'drawn', 'problems.6', 'guy', 'played', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'playing', 'over-eager', 'druggie', '8217', 'definitely', 'not', 'Hogwarts', 'anymore.7', 'movie', 'bafflingly', 'good', 'capturing', '8220', 'damn-the-consequences-I', '8217', 'm-in-love', '8221', 'feeling', 'young', 'people', 'tend', 'fall', 'into.8', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'original', 'score', 'meshes', 'well', 'tracks', 'Moby', 'M83', 'keep', 'slightly', 'hallucinatory', 'dreamy', 'atmosphere', 'going', 'whole', 'film.9', 'ending', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'oddly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'be', 'better', 'appreciated']",Charlie Countryman
