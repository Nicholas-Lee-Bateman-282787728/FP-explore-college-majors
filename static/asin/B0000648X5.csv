699347,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0000648X5,Artist & Author,"[2, 2]","At the beginning of this movie, a young girl named Sufi playfully pushed Altaaf into the water.  When he runs home, he finds his family held hostage by islamic terrorists.  The police have been tipped off, and in storming the house Altaaf's parents and sister are killed.  When they grow up, Altaaf is full of hatred, but Sufi is a loving person.  This is no accident, because in Islam, the Sufi sect's central concept is love.  They believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe.Altaaf joins up with a group of islamic terrorists, filled with hatred and violence.  To them, anyone who doesn't agree with them is an infidel, even other Moslems, so they should be killed.  All of this violence is done in the name of their god, and they make frequent use of killing.  Their ultimate goal is to blow up a mosque while the prime minister of India is visiting the area.  It is important for understanding this movie that all the main characters are Moslem . . . or claim to be moslem.As probably most often happens, the supreme terrorist takes some perceived offense expressed by someone and channels that into terrorism.  In Altaaf's case, the leader took the hatred he had of his adoptive father to turn it into hatred of anyone who did not practice his version of islam.  However, Altaaf's mother, possibly a Sufi Moslem, loved him in spite of his violence and terrorism; she was trying to let her God's love flow through her to her apparently evil adopted son.  Believing that her God was an Islamic God of love, not the god of hatred and violence of the terrorist's sect, she risks her life to go to him with the message that his choice is not just one of kill or be killed, but of choosing the way of love and life or the way of hatred and death.This movie does not skimp on showing the utterly brutal violence of the evil moslems, carrying out their terror in the name of some god.  This is partly dramatic, but also because islamic terrorists have killed more people in India, say since Sept. 11, 2001, than in the rest of the world combined . . . By a factor of ten or so.  It is a stark reminder of what will inevitably happen in Europe or the US if they ever gain enough influence and power.Some of the musical interludes seem a bit long, but the words to the songs are related to the message of the story.  They are worth reading (or listening to if you understand the language).  This is an excellent movie on the choice to follow the ways of hatred and evil or a life of love and forgiveness.For another good movie depicting Sufi Islam, be sure to see Omar Shariff's Monsieur Ibrahim (2003) [Starring: Omar Sharif, Pierre Boulanger Director: Franois Dupeyron][I want to point out that in this review, I have capitalized the words that refer to a true religion or deity, and deliberately left off the capitals to refer to a pseudo-religion or the anti-diety.]",5,Sufi symbolizes love in a world of hate,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,2894,"['beginning', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Sufi', 'playfully', 'pushed', 'Altaaf', 'water', 'When', 'home', 'family', 'held', 'hostage', 'islamic', 'terrorists', 'police', 'have', 'been', 'tipped', 'off', 'storming', 'house', 'Altaaf', 'parents', 'sister', 'are', 'killed', 'When', 'grow', 'up', 'Altaaf', 'full', 'hatred', 'Sufi', 'loving', 'person', 'accident', 'Islam', 'Sufi', 'sect', 'central', 'concept', 'love', 'believe', 'love', 'projection', 'essence', 'God', 'universe.Altaaf', 'up', 'group', 'islamic', 'terrorists', 'filled', 'hatred', 'violence', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'agree', 'infidel', 'even', 'other', 'Moslems', 'should', 'be', 'killed', 'violence', 'done', 'name', 'god', 'make', 'frequent', 'use', 'killing', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'blow', 'up', 'mosque', 'prime', 'minister', 'India', 'visiting', 'area', 'important', 'understanding', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Moslem', 'claim', 'be', 'moslem.As', 'probably', 'most', 'often', 'supreme', 'terrorist', 'perceived', 'offense', 'expressed', 'someone', 'channels', 'terrorism', 'Altaaf', 'case', 'leader', 'took', 'hatred', 'had', 'adoptive', 'father', 'turn', 'hatred', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'practice', 'version', 'islam', 'However', 'Altaaf', 'mother', 'possibly', 'Sufi', 'Moslem', 'loved', 'spite', 'violence', 'terrorism', 'was', 'trying', 'let', 'God', 'love', 'flow', 'apparently', 'evil', 'adopted', 'son', 'Believing', 'God', 'was', 'Islamic', 'God', 'love', 'not', 'god', 'hatred', 'violence', 'terrorist', 'sect', 'life', 'go', 'message', 'choice', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'choosing', 'way', 'love', 'life', 'way', 'hatred', 'death.This', 'movie', 'not', 'skimp', 'showing', 'utterly', 'brutal', 'violence', 'evil', 'moslems', 'carrying', 'out', 'terror', 'name', 'god', 'partly', 'dramatic', 'also', 'islamic', 'terrorists', 'have', 'killed', 'more', 'people', 'India', 'say', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'rest', 'world', 'combined', 'factor', 'ten', 'so', 'stark', 'reminder', 'what', 'will', 'inevitably', 'happen', 'Europe', 'US', 'ever', 'gain', 'enough', 'influence', 'power.Some', 'musical', 'interludes', 'seem', 'bit', 'long', 'words', 'songs', 'are', 'related', 'message', 'story', 'are', 'worth', 'reading', 'listening', 'understand', 'language', 'excellent', 'movie', 'choice', 'follow', 'ways', 'hatred', 'evil', 'life', 'love', 'forgiveness.For', 'good', 'movie', 'depicting', 'Sufi', 'Islam', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'Monsieur', 'Ibrahim', '2003', '[', 'Starring', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Pierre', 'Boulanger', 'Director', 'Franois', 'Dupeyron', ']', '[', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'review', 'have', 'capitalized', 'words', 'refer', 'true', 'religion', 'deity', 'deliberately', 'left', 'off', 'capitals', 'refer', 'pseudo-religion', 'anti-diety', ']']",N/A
699348,AHKP7P4T2QDU5,B0000648X5,Aubrey Ward III,"[3, 3]","I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie like this. It's a drama, a comedy, a love story, a musical, and an action film. Some might find that subject matter of terrorism shouldn't have been treated lightly but I don't this film is guilty of that. It's actually pretty realistic. The story is about this boy, Altaaf, who experiences a lot of traumatic stuff such as losing his parents in a police raid. He then grows up with this hatred and ends up in a terrorist gang. Altaaf is constantly battling between love and hate and we see the consequences of his desicions.The musical part is integrated very well into the film. It's doesn't just happen. Like one scene where Altaaf goes to visit his childhood friend and ends up appearing in her music video. It's a nice moment that shows Altaaf isn't totally consumed with vengence and that he still has the capacity to love. And the song was pretty catch too. However, the scene where Altaaf is dancing in a televison special is a little odd. I think he might have been imaging himself in the number wishing he could have the peace being sung about. The action scenes were done well, perhaps a little over done but it worked fine.I didn't find the acting over the top or hammy at all. I admit that adult Altaaf is pretty darn handsome and probably has done some modeling but I was convicted by his performance. He wasn't just a pretty boy. The man who played the cop that killed Altaaf's parents was superb. The cop's wife was also amazing and it was a hoot to recognize her from ""Bride and Prejudice"".My only gripe is the ending. If there was an unrealistic moment in this film then that was it. If I had written it the ending would've been much more tragic.

699351,A1CMWPFDXA3Y2I,B0000648X5,"ex nihilo ""creatio""","[6, 7]","Indian films seem lately to have a special interest in the issue of islamic terrorism. This is the case in this film, in which the situation of Kashmere as a potential terrorist target is treated in quite a gutsy way. The plot is complex and far-fetched, even by Indian standards, and it involves an international terrorist plot, Bin Laden (always seen in the shadows, but unmistakenly him), Afghans, Kashmir, Indian policemen, romance and music, all thrown together. However, the complexity of the plot forms a background against which we are told a tragic story of love and hate between a father and his son. The son, Hrithik Roshan, hates his father with such violence that his only obsession is to kill him. Of course, this pattern of family relations must be so traumatic in a country like India, where parents and families in general are considered almost sacred, that the audience would have found impossible to understand, let alone like or sympathize with, such a character. And hence the bizarre plot. The father is not the real father of the protagonist, he is actually the policeman who killed the protagonist's family as an act of vengeance, and then, guilt-ridden, adopted the, then very young, boy. When this boy grew up and discovered the truth about his adoptive father, he ran away from home promising vengeance. He then was raised and trained as a terrorist by a mysterious Afghan , and finally goes back to India as an extremely dangerous person pepared to do anything to get his revenge, inadvertedly acting as a pawn in a great scale plan to cause havoc in Kashmir. This is the bizarre story that justifies what would be otherwise impossible to do for an Asian audience: a son hating his father, rebelling against him, obsessed with destroying him. This is an old trick, much used in literature (e.g. Shakespeare) and that in this case adds to the build-up of the climax and makes this long movie (3 hours aprox) seem short. It also makes you understand the ending. In an American film, the terrorist would certainly have been punished by the writer. But here, the main issue is not terrorism but this rebellion of the son against the father, so...",5,A story of love and hate,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,2170,"['Indian', 'films', 'seem', 'lately', 'have', 'special', 'interest', 'issue', 'islamic', 'terrorism', 'case', 'film', 'situation', 'Kashmere', 'potential', 'terrorist', 'target', 'treated', 'quite', 'gutsy', 'way', 'plot', 'complex', 'far-fetched', 'even', 'Indian', 'standards', 'international', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'always', 'seen', 'shadows', 'unmistakenly', 'Afghans', 'Kashmir', 'Indian', 'policemen', 'romance', 'music', 'thrown', 'together', 'However', 'complexity', 'plot', 'background', 'are', 'told', 'tragic', 'story', 'love', 'hate', 'father', 'son', 'son', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'father', 'such', 'violence', 'only', 'obsession', 'kill', 'course', 'pattern', 'family', 'relations', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'traumatic', 'country', 'India', 'where', 'parents', 'families', 'general', 'are', 'considered', 'almost', 'sacred', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'impossible', 'understand', 'let', 'alone', 'sympathize', 'character', 'hence', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'father', 'not', 'real', 'father', 'protagonist', 'actually', 'policeman', 'who', 'killed', 'protagonist', 'family', 'act', 'vengeance', 'then', 'guilt-ridden', 'adopted', 'then', 'very', 'young', 'boy', 'When', 'boy', 'grew', 'up', 'discovered', 'truth', 'adoptive', 'father', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'promising', 'vengeance', 'then', 'was', 'raised', 'trained', 'terrorist', 'mysterious', 'Afghan', 'finally', 'back', 'India', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'person', 'pepared', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'revenge', 'inadvertedly', 'acting', 'pawn', 'great', 'scale', 'plan', 'cause', 'havoc', 'Kashmir', 'bizarre', 'story', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'otherwise', 'impossible', 'do', 'Asian', 'audience', 'son', 'hating', 'father', 'rebelling', 'obsessed', 'destroying', 'old', 'trick', 'much', 'used', 'literature', 'e.g', 'Shakespeare', 'case', 'build-up', 'climax', 'long', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'aprox', 'seem', 'short', 'also', 'understand', 'ending', 'American', 'film', 'terrorist', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'punished', 'writer', 'here', 'main', 'issue', 'not', 'terrorism', 'rebellion', 'son', 'father', 'so']",N/A

J.""","[3, 3]","I had to watch Mission Kashmir because I recognized the handsome Bollywood Superstar, Hrithik Roshan, on the DVD cover.While the sound effects and some of the acting is a bit dated by Hollywood standards, the storyline is brilliant:  a young Kashmiri freedom fighter must choose between revenge and violence or love and forgiveness. His soul is tortured because the man who adopted him as a child is also responsible for the death of his biological family.  After watching this film, you begin to think about the futility of war, revenge and violence.While randomly interspersed with some Bollywood musical moments, it is still a touching story.  Nothing is black and white about the matter at all, and you're dying to find out how it all ends.  One reviewer wrote about the cheesiness of the musical interludes.  That's just Bollywood and part of its appeal.  It's definitely different by Hollywood standards which makes it somewhat of a novelty to Western audiences.  You just have to be open minded to different types of cinema.  Some people like the formula, some do not.  It is merely preference in style.It's a shame that Hollywood films today are falling into a pattern of monotony. If you're reduced to doing re-makes of old films, you got to ask yourself who's really the cheesy one?  On top of that, you get the same old endings.  The same old lines.  Same scene set up. Worst of all, no character development--the crucial premise to a good story.  The audience ends up wasting their money.  And who benefits?  The studios, of course.  One of these days, the audience will no longer take half-baked attempts at entertainment and will start looking for entertainment elsewhere.

699354,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0000648X5,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 6]","A beautiful film about a very serious problem, the political strife in divided Kashmir in India, I mean in the Indian half of Kashmir. Beautiful because of the dancing, the music, the constant celebration of something or other since one of the main characters is a TV actress. The main hero is himself able to sing, to dance, to play some music, to draw and to paint, and do so many other things. This gives a great atmosphere and a marvellous picture of what Indo-Aryan people are. It also gives an extremely open vision of the Moslems there who are not at all submitted in any way to any orthodox fundamentalism. Yet behind this brilliant picture, there is a situation that hurts in the deepest cells of our brain. The fundamentalists are trying to take over this half of Kashmir and reunify Kashmir under a basic moslem rule. The fundamentalists are shown as terrorists who cast a curse, a death sentence - it has another name but this name does not tell us what it really is - against anyone who will cooperate with Indian soldiers or police. The first  victim of this sentence is a doctor who dared take care of a wounded soldier, and the second victim will be a child who will not find the treatment he needs because of the fear of doctors who refuse to treat him. The film also shows how the police can kill a whole innocent family just to kill one terrorist, making us wonder who the terrorists are then. Then we sink lower and lower into the terrorist dilemma with the main hero who is divided between avenging his family killed by the police and recognizing that it was an accident and yielding to the love of the beautiful girl who is a TV actress and forgiving the police. We are thus taken down into the minutest details of a terrorist attack against the Indian Prime Minister and our hero will make it fail at the very last second due to his epiphanic conversion. This is Indian cinema that associates drama and even tragedy to romance and musical pageant. That's a way of looking at life as being always the association of totally antagonistic elements and considering the truth can only be found in such a cocktail of black, white and grey elements into an optimistic finishing colourful touch. It is a way to see the light of hope even in the darkest moments of history and demonstrating to us that a fair dose of meditation will always alleviate unhappy events and prospects.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Happiness is always within some sad suffering,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2486,"['beautiful', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'problem', 'political', 'strife', 'divided', 'Kashmir', 'India', 'mean', 'Indian', 'half', 'Kashmir', 'Beautiful', 'dancing', 'music', 'constant', 'celebration', 'something', 'other', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'TV', 'actress', 'main', 'hero', 'able', 'sing', 'dance', 'play', 'music', 'draw', 'paint', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'marvellous', 'picture', 'what', 'Indo-Aryan', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'open', 'vision', 'Moslems', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'submitted', 'way', 'orthodox', 'fundamentalism', 'brilliant', 'picture', 'situation', 'deepest', 'cells', 'brain', 'fundamentalists', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'half', 'Kashmir', 'reunify', 'Kashmir', 'basic', 'moslem', 'rule', 'fundamentalists', 'are', 'shown', 'terrorists', 'who', 'cast', 'curse', 'death', 'sentence', 'name', 'name', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'cooperate', 'Indian', 'soldiers', 'police', 'first', 'victim', 'sentence', 'doctor', 'who', 'dared', 'take', 'care', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'second', 'victim', 'will', 'be', 'child', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'treatment', 'fear', 'doctors', 'who', 'refuse', 'treat', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'police', 'can', 'kill', 'whole', 'innocent', 'family', 'just', 'kill', 'one', 'terrorist', 'making', 'wonder', 'who', 'terrorists', 'are', 'then', 'Then', 'sink', 'lower', 'lower', 'terrorist', 'dilemma', 'main', 'hero', 'who', 'divided', 'avenging', 'family', 'killed', 'police', 'recognizing', 'was', 'accident', 'yielding', 'love', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'TV', 'actress', 'forgiving', 'police', 'are', 'thus', 'taken', 'down', 'minutest', 'details', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Indian', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'hero', 'will', 'make', 'fail', 'very', 'last', 'second', 'due', 'epiphanic', 'conversion', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'drama', 'even', 'tragedy', 'romance', 'musical', 'pageant', 'way', 'looking', 'life', 'being', 'always', 'association', 'totally', 'antagonistic', 'elements', 'considering', 'truth', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'such', 'cocktail', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'elements', 'optimistic', 'finishing', 'colourful', 'touch', 'way', 'see', 'light', 'hope', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'history', 'demonstrating', 'fair', 'dose', 'meditation', 'will', 'always', 'alleviate', 'unhappy', 'events', 'prospects.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

""Mission Kashmir"" suffers from this malady - a willingness to sacrifice artistic and even ideological integrity at the altar of marketability. What do you get when you take an all star cast that consists of an actor who looks like a Calvin Klein model, an actress who looks like she belongs in a Miss World beauty pageant, and have them and other cast members dancing in grandiose dance numbers, at arbitrary points in the film, for no apparent reason? You get a movie that is prime to rake in big money at the box offices in India, because it appeases the simplistic tastes of Indian moviegoers.Why should anyone take a movie seriously, when one of its main stars, who is supposed to play a jaded kid, turned terrorist, doesn't look or act the part? Hrithik Roshan's chiseled face, Adonis like physique, and starry eyed gaze may make him an ideal candidate for romantic films like ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" - a fun film to watch, and one that he performed exceeding well in - but he hardly makes a good candidate to play a terrorist. Maybe its just me, but there is something hard to swallow about a terrorist who appears as if he spends hours per day in beauty salons working on a soft complexion and refining his hair style. For the love of God, even his stubble looks perfectly groomed! Roshan's character, Altaaf, is supposed to be a kid who comes from an impoverished area of Kashmir, who in the early stages of his life watched his own family massacred by his future adoptive father, and his entire life is consumed by revenge. Its not exactly the stuff runway models are made out of, but you wouldn't know it looking at Altaaf. If people think Altaaf is a believable terrorist, well then I propose that the next cinematic reenactment of Jesus' life have Britney Spears cast as the Virgin Mary and one of the Back Street boys as Barabbas.Aside from mere appearances, the acting and characterization in this film is atrocious. Roshan, in typical Bollywood fashion, is melodramatic to the point of being obnoxious. He shakes so hard at times in the story, were he seeks to convey the feeling of rancor or lamentation, that you would think he is having an epileptic seizure. Secondly, his whole pursuit of his childhood flame, played by the beautiful Preity Zinta, is superfluous to the plot and really mitigates against the notion that he is a man consumed totally by hatred. Zinta's character is an obvious didactic device used by the moviemakers to ensure that the denser of us get the moral message of the story. When her character told Altaaf (paraphrased), ""My religion (Islam) does not teach violence and murder as solutions to life's problems"", I began to wonder if I was watching a movie for adults or some after school special. It is common for characters to serve as the primary expositors of morals in movies. However, skillfully written films do this in such a subtle manner, through the actions of the character, not by one character giving a lecture to another character as if she is some teacher in a third grade Sunday school classroom. Furthermore, Zinta's character hardly makes for a believable voice for religious moderation in times of turmoil, considering with her good looks, budding television career, better than average wealth, and chipper demeanor, she was seemingly unaffected by her impoverished and war torn upbringing. Then we have Jackie Shroff as the terrorist mastermind behind the film's doomsday plot. He has about as much depth as a Japanese anime villain, and to compound matters he spouts off corny dialogue that seemed to have been drafted by an overzealous fifth grader who has watched one too many ""Iron Eagle"" sequels.To add to all this lunacy the film is interspersed with several dance numbers - the trademark of any Bollywood picture. Granted, in films like ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"",  ""Saathiya"", and  ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"", this is excusable and even adds to how entertaining these films are because these films are primarily about subjects like love, family, and culture, and are therefore light hearted. Hence, when dance sequences are badly edited into these films, to where the narrative is abruptly halted for a dance number, no one thinks twice about. However, in such a film like ""Mission Kashmir"" this only serves to detract from the overall story, especially since much of the music and dancing is so blissful. Seeing Altaaf dance gleefully doesn't exactly mesh well with the movies portrayal of man who is supposed to be enraged by past injustices. I wonder how much of an impact a landmark drama like ""Schindler's List"" would have had if it's narrative were punctuated haphazardly with dance sequences that pitted concentration camp victims and Nazi soldiers in a dance off? I don't think it would have elicited the tear jerking reaction it got from me, nor would it have garnered the respect from the film community that it did.There are some saving graces of this film. One is the superb acting done by Sanjay Dutt. Dutt is a believably conflicted inspector whose life is literally torn asunder by the internal struggle between moral conviction and his own penchant for revenge. Sonali Kulkarni embodies maternal empathy with the skill of a seasoned actress. Finally, the cinematography, which is especially noticeable at the opening of the film, is on par with that of American films.It is unfortunate that all these laudable elements could not have been subsumed into a better cinematic framework that had a more appreciable supporting cast and characterization. Its no wonder Indian cinematic efforts, with the exception of the overrated Lagaan, have not gotten much international attention.",2,Mission Kashmir (a.k.a.

I've seen some conflict Bollywood films like Refugee and Dil Se that deal with issues between India - Pakistan - the northeastern states, etc. that were much better in my opinion. If you're interested in these issues, I'd recommend watching the film but maybe not buying.

699357,A3QVAKVRAH657N,B0000648X5,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[56, 57]","One of the great things about Bollywood is that for Americans who are tired to death of the inanity and sameness of summer blockbuster-typemovies, these imports from India offer a completely different kind of movie experience. Mission : Kashmir, for example, presents a dedicated and happily married policeman trying to stop terrorists.  Easy enough to predict how Hollywood would handle that one : Michael Bay or some other loud noise and explosion director; Bruce Willis/Nicholas Cage/Arnold Schwarzenegger starring; Rene Russo as the wife; plenty of blood and death and snappy one-liners; no emotions; no thought required.  It's all so familiar and insipid you wouldn't even rent it went it comes to video.  Bollywood may be just as formulaic in its own way, but it is very much its own way and besides being fresh and different for an American viewer the formula also seems superior in several important aspects.First, despite the Hindu nationalism of India, which would make you think filmmakers would shy away, the stories use politics and history toilluminate contemporary concerns--most often the clash between rival religions.  So in Mission : Kashmir, the hero, Inspector Inayat Khan is aMuslim loyal to India, hunting down Muslim terrorists who are trying to ""liberate"" Kashmir and destroy India. His particular hatred of the terrorists is fueled by a fatwa which was placed upon anyone who assists him or his family, so that when his son fell from a window no doctor would treat the boy even as he lay dying in Khan's arms.But rather than present everyone as cardboard cutouts, uniformly bad or uniformly good, the film explores the legacy of hatred and the currents of violence that have made people hate each other.  In one especially effective scene, after a police raid in which Kahn's Hindu deputy, Avinash, has gone berserk, his Sikh colleague, Gurdeep Singh, tries comforting him.  But as Avinash bemoans the loss of loved ones to terror and wails that Gurdeep can't know what it is like, Gurdeep explodes in rage because his family was murdered by Hindus rioting after the assassination of Indira Gandhi.  In a nation where so many ethnicities and religions have co-existed so uncomfortably, everyone has his own scars, some quite horrible.Another refreshing feature of these films is that they quite revel in melodrama and pathos.  So when Khan exacts his revenge, slaughtering an entire village to get at the terrorist leader who issued the fatwa, he rescues the man's son and at the insistence of his own wife, Neelima, adopts him.  The child, Altaaf, who witnessed the raid, is nearly catatonic and is obsessed with the ski-masked gunman who shot his father.  When, several years later, he finds the mask in Khan's desk drawer, he runs away from home, is taken in by a Kashmiri terrorist who raises him as a son, and dedicates himself to getting revenge on Kahn.  So the father is responsible for the death of Khan's son and Khan is responsible for the death of the father and now the son and Khan will duel to the death with the struggle in Kashmir, and the jihad of the boy's third ""father"", as a backdrop--and so violence begets violence and passes from generation to generation.Meanwhile, Neelima, who is Hindu, is torn between the two men she loves and when Altaaf returns as a young man, hell-bent on murdering her husband, she tries desperately to convince him that no religion, no cause, no blood feud can justify his course of action, that he has a choice to make, between love and hate and good and evil.  But just the fact of her temporarily eluding security to meet with him brings down the distrust of Kahn's Hindu superiors upon him and Kahn confronts her, saying she'll have to choose between him and her ""son"".  And, of course, when the final confrontation comes, Altaaf does indeed have to choose between the vengeful and mindless sectarian violence or the kind of love and healing of which his ""mother"" spoke.Granted, many of these scenes are way over the top and somewhat implausible, but they're at least trying to elicit some reaction from us.  Thefilmmakers want to invoke the emotions that might drive such destructive, even self-destructive, behaviors--to make us at least share the feelings if not the thoughts of the various characters.  Think how different this is than say a Die Hard movie, where the terrorists are merely evil incarnate with no coherent motivation.The final innovation that Bollywood brings to the movies is one that can take some getting used to and is particularly jarring in a film like this one.  Bollywood productions tend to be musicals--not musicals as in the Sound of Music either, where there are songs throughout and some pretense for them, but musicals in the sense that big production numbers break out nearly at random, often blending in elements of fantasy, with no realintention of moving forward the narrative of the film.  Here the songs begin at a couple of really odd moments, once during a major terrorist assault and once when Kahn has unknowingly brought a bomb home in his briefcase.  Just when we'd expect the film to try and exploit the tension of the situation, the stars start singing and dancing.  As if the timing wasn't disconcerting enough, the song during the attack turns into a huge Up With People type extravaganza.  It's exceedingly odd.  But it's also so unusual that it ends up being rather exhilarating and it's certainly memorable.If all this isn't enough to intrigue you : the cinematography and the scenery in Kashmir are spectacular; the screenplay's cowritten by the finenovelist Vikram Chandra; there are any number of terrific action sequences; there's a romantic angle as Altaaf finds the girl he loved in childhood; and the actors and actresses are uniformly fabulous looking.  Sanjay Dutt is especially appealing as Kahn, big, bluff, and tough, with the manly good looks of a Jack Lord or a Victor Mature.  Hrithik Roshan, as Altaaf, is more the Brad Pitt-type, a pretty and sensitive hearththrob, but it's very much Dutt's picture and he carries it ably.With all this going for it and with terrorism and Kashmir so much in the news, it seems likely that even if you're new to Bollywood, this is a film you'll enjoy and a timely introduction to the fine crop of films coming out of India these days.GRADE

(Bollywood means Bombay's Hollywood).This DVD of ""Mission Kashmir"" gives you an English Audio track to listen to so that you don't have to struggle with reading as you're watching.  The English dubbing has some voices that your kids hear when they watch English dubbed ""Japanese Anime"".In India, in the exciting world of Bollywood, this film has one of the hottest male stars of Indian cinema.  His name is Hrithik Roshan.  Ladies are going nuts over this handsome guy.  As in other Bollywood films that he's done, Hrithik Roshan is quickly becoming the most popular male star of Bollywood.  Some of his other films that are popular (in India, and other countries outside of America), are ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"", ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"", ""Fiza"", and ""Mujhse Dosti Karoge"".  If you find a way to rent these films, you're in for a treat.  Your husband may enjoy them too, because the girls in these films are gorgeous too.In ""Mission Kashmir"", the female co-starring with Hrithik is Preity Zinta.  She has also been in some Indian Blockbusters, such as ""Chori Chori Chupke Chupke"", ""Dil Chahta Hai"", and ""Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega"", just to name a small few.The other main character of this film is more of a Bollywood veteran star named Sanjay Dutt.  Many of his big movies include; ""Khal Nayak"", ""Khoobsurat"", ""Vaastav"" and ""Daud""  (This film ""Daud"" features an intensely sexy song video with the undenyably gorgeous Urmila Matondkar).  I'm sure Sanjay Dutt has had many other popular films, but I don't follow him as much as I do other Bollywood stars.Now I'll close with just a small comment about Bollywood.  I've come to recognize that women enjoy the stories of Indian films better than men do. I guess women have longer attention spans, then most men.  Indian films aren't for the bone-headed, simple mindedness that American Blockbuster films rely on.  These stories are more intricate and detailed.  Most men prefer American Hollywood films more because Hollywood does more special effects, and extensive violence and blatant use of fowl language.  In other words, men usually don't want to follow a story, men don't want to have to think, they just want to be entertained by unrealistic action scenes, and watching people get beat up and/or killed.  Many Hollywood Blockbusters aren't much when it comes to an actual story...Bollywood films have a lot more to offer than just visual effects. Maybe it's just me, but I happen to love watching beautiful girls dance.  In Bollywood, song videos are normal.  I'll agree with some people though.  Some of the songs, although passionate and sexy, still seem a little out-of-text with the story here.  But, luckily, you can always skip the songs by simply jumping to the next chapter.  You also have an option with the DVD to just watch the song videos without the movie, which I enjoy when I don't have time to watch a full movie.  I even have a ""Priety Zinta"" Song DVD collection where her song videos are mixed up with other song videos from other movies that she's done.  These song videos are usually filmed in some exotic paradise location, or in hot dance bar, or somewhere else, which is so colorful and exciting.  India's Bollywood song videos are like watching ""moving, active, visual art for the mind and the ears.""  The hell with MTV, I'd rather watch visual art that is sensual, not angry and disturbing.  I mean, what do YOU watch music videos for?""Mission Kashmir"" is a great place to start for both men and women.  It's got a great detailed story, and it's got your violence, too.  It's got handsome guys and gorgeous girls.  And the DVD has an English voice track, so nobody has to think too hard...  What's more, most all Bollywood DVD's have an English subtitle option.  That wasn't always the case with VHS.  This factor alone is helping to bring Bollywood to the American audience.So, give this one a try.  I'm sure you'll enjoy this new movie experience.",4,Americans can start watching Bollywood with this one.,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,4270,"['have', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Lagaan', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'yet', 'feel', 'slightly', 'discouraged', 'watching', 'foreign', 'films', 'where', 'have', 'read', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'film', 'Mission', 'Kashmir', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'want', 'capture', 'great', 'Indian', 'film', 'Bollywood', 'experience', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'America', 'are', 'starting', 'discover', 'Bollywood', 'Bombay', 'Hollywood', '.This', 'DVD', 'Mission', 'Kashmir', 'English', 'Audio', 'track', 'listen', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'struggle', 'reading', ""'re"", 'watching', 'English', 'dubbing', 'voices', 'kids', 'hear', 'when', 'watch', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Japanese', 'Anime', '.In', 'India', 'exciting', 'world', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'one', 'hottest', 'male', 'stars', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'name', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Ladies', 'are', 'going', 'nuts', 'handsome', 'guy', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'done', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'most', 'popular', 'male', 'star', 'Bollywood', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'popular', 'India', 'other', 'countries', 'America', 'are', 'Kaho', 'Naa', 'Pyaar', 'Hai', 'Kabhi', 'Khushi', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', 'Fiza', 'Mujhse', 'Dosti', 'Karoge', 'find', 'way', 'rent', 'films', ""'re"", 'treat', 'husband', 'may', 'enjoy', 'too', 'girls', 'films', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Mission', 'Kashmir', 'female', 'co-starring', 'Hrithik', 'Preity', 'Zinta', 'also', 'been', 'Indian', 'Blockbusters', 'such', 'Chori', 'Chori', 'Chupke', 'Chupke', 'Dil', 'Chahta', 'Hai', 'Har', 'Dil', 'Jo', 'Pyar', 'Karega', 'just', 'name', 'small', 'few.The', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'Bollywood', 'veteran', 'star', 'named', 'Sanjay', 'Dutt', 'Many', 'big', 'movies', 'include', 'Khal', 'Nayak', 'Khoobsurat', 'Vaastav', 'Daud', 'film', 'Daud', 'intensely', 'sexy', 'song', 'video', 'undenyably', 'gorgeous', 'Urmila', 'Matondkar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Sanjay', 'Dutt', 'had', 'many', 'other', 'popular', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'stars.Now', ""'ll"", 'close', 'just', 'small', 'comment', 'Bollywood', ""'ve"", 'come', 'recognize', 'women', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'Indian', 'films', 'better', 'men', 'do', 'guess', 'women', 'have', 'longer', 'attention', 'spans', 'then', 'most', 'men', 'Indian', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'bone-headed', 'simple', 'mindedness', 'American', 'Blockbuster', 'films', 'rely', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'intricate', 'detailed', 'Most', 'men', 'prefer', 'American', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'more', 'because', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'extensive', 'violence', 'blatant', 'use', 'fowl', 'language', 'other', 'words', 'men', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'follow', 'story', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'think', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'unrealistic', 'action', 'scenes', 'watching', 'people', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'and/or', 'killed', 'Many', 'Hollywood', 'Blockbusters', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'when', 'actual', 'story', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'visual', 'effects', 'Maybe', 'just', 'happen', 'love', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'dance', 'Bollywood', 'song', 'videos', 'are', 'normal', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'people', 'songs', 'passionate', 'sexy', 'still', 'seem', 'little', 'out-of-text', 'story', 'here', 'luckily', 'can', 'always', 'skip', 'songs', 'simply', 'jumping', 'next', 'chapter', 'also', 'have', 'option', 'DVD', 'just', 'watch', 'song', 'videos', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'full', 'movie', 'even', 'have', 'Priety', 'Zinta', 'Song', 'DVD', 'collection', 'where', 'song', 'videos', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'other', 'song', 'videos', 'other', 'movies', 'done', 'song', 'videos', 'are', 'usually', 'filmed', 'exotic', 'paradise', 'location', 'hot', 'dance', 'bar', 'somewhere', 'else', 'so', 'colorful', 'exciting', 'India', 'Bollywood', 'song', 'videos', 'are', 'watching', 'moving', 'active', 'visual', 'art', 'mind', 'ears', 'hell', 'MTV', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'visual', 'art', 'sensual', 'not', 'angry', 'disturbing', 'mean', 'what', 'do', 'watch', 'music', 'videos', 'Mission', 'Kashmir', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'men', 'women', 'got', 'great', 'detailed', 'story', 'got', 'violence', 'too', 'got', 'handsome', 'guys', 'gorgeous', 'girls', 'DVD', 'English', 'voice', 'track', 'nobody', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'What', 'more', 'most', 'Bollywood', 'DVD', 'have', 'English', 'subtitle', 'option', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'VHS', 'factor', 'alone', 'helping', 'bring', 'Bollywood', 'American', 'audience.So', 'give', 'one', 'try', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'new', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A

The film would have worked great as a dramatic action film, even with the melodrama in it.  I know that Indian films are known for their musical scenes, but the musical scenes in this film fall totally flat and are completely out of place with the rest of the film.  Some of the musical scenes would work well, if the film were a comedy, and the others would work only in a cheesy Bollywood romance.  Only one musical scene has any choreography worth noting; the other scenes are very mediocre.  Besides the tone, the placement and occurances of some of the musical scenes are poorly chosen.  In one scene, a terrorist somehow finds his way into a TV studio to dance with a long-lost childhood love.As for other elements of the film, the scenery is nice, the dialogue is decent, and the script is smart, but the photography and camera angles are below par.  The film also uses too many cheesy and unbelievable dream sequences.  Some of the action scenes are straight out of B-movie thrillers, too.  There are a few nice visual images, however, scattered through the film.Overall, the director doesn't seem to know what path he wants the film to take, a melodramatic drama with action or a (somewhat) cheesy love story with an unbelievable tacked-on feel-good ending.Also, the film is rated ""R"" for violence only, but I was quite surprised because I've seen ""PG-13"" films with more violence, sex, nudity, and swearing than this.  Perhaps giving it an ""R"" rating was a lame attempt to make it seem like a serious grown-up film.",1,"This ""Mission"" Never Quite Comes Together...",1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,1658,"[""'d"", 'read', 'good', 'review', 'Mission', 'Kashmir', 'wanted', 'see', 'knowing', 'was', 'flop', 'India', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'great', 'dramatic', 'action', 'film', 'even', 'melodrama', 'know', 'Indian', 'films', 'are', 'known', 'musical', 'scenes', 'musical', 'scenes', 'film', 'fall', 'totally', 'flat', 'are', 'completely', 'place', 'rest', 'film', 'musical', 'scenes', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'were', 'comedy', 'others', 'would', 'work', 'only', 'cheesy', 'Bollywood', 'romance', 'Only', 'one', 'musical', 'scene', 'choreography', 'noting', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'mediocre', 'tone', 'placement', 'occurances', 'musical', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'chosen', 'one', 'scene', 'terrorist', 'somehow', 'way', 'TV', 'studio', 'dance', 'long-lost', 'childhood', 'love.As', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'scenery', 'nice', 'dialogue', 'decent', 'script', 'smart', 'photography', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'par', 'film', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'cheesy', 'unbelievable', 'dream', 'sequences', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'straight', 'B-movie', 'thrillers', 'too', 'are', 'few', 'nice', 'visual', 'images', 'however', 'scattered', 'film.Overall', 'director', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'take', 'melodramatic', 'drama', 'action', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'love', 'story', 'unbelievable', 'tacked-on', 'feel-good', 'ending.Also', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'only', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'PG-13', 'films', 'more', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'Perhaps', 'giving', 'R', 'rating', 'was', 'lame', 'attempt', 'make', 'seem', 'serious', 'grown-up', 'film']",N/A
699362,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B0000648X5,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[0, 0]","When it comes to movies about war and Terrorism generally speaking we here in the west basically portray the issues as a strictly ""black and white"" kind of tale. The evil terrorists are brainwashed, nearly robotic fanatics, devoid of even the most basic humanitarian instincts. While the virtuous defenders of liberty always do the right thing and never make mistakes. In Bollywood, they do things a little differently. I've seen several movies from Bollywood on the subject now and at first I found the shift in perspective a bit jarring. The first of these movies wasFanaaand oh boy, was that a kick in the stomach! I mean that in a good way, but I'll never be able to see it more than once.This is where I learned the basic premise on the Bollywood method of dealing with the subject of Terrorism... ""Terrorists are human beings, who make all the wrong choices."" Simplistic? Yes, but also true when you get to the bottom of it. Films likeFiza (2000) (Hrithik Roshan / Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)and this one explores the way Terrorists are *made* and that gets in to the more complex and familiar themes we in the west are used to seeing...Religion: Let's face it, the most basic argument to almost every conflict we humans unleash starts with religion. Be it Christianity, or any other, even non-belief, there's nothing like religion to stir up a conflict. People have used it to their advantage since the beginning of time.Politics and power: One of the best quotes I know says ""what do all men with power want? More power."" Again, that's been proven true since the beginning of time. It doesn't matter which form the power takes, the person who wields it will always want more. This film covers most of the power spectrum, from the grand scheme of governments and national pride, the power of money, the power of ideology, to the basic power over men's minds. All these powers, and the men who wield them are dealt with quite realistically, some stay out-of-sight from our protagonists, some are out in the open.Revenge: It's crazy how one tragedy can grow into a thousand. One boy falls from a window, another becomes a weapon. The moral, 'break a man's heart badly enough and he's capable of becoming anything.'Like I said, Hindi movies about Terrorism aren't very straightforward. No white and black hats here. The ""bad guys"" have feelings, and even morals. The ""good guys"" do terrible things in the name of revenge. A wise man once said, ""War is hell"" this movie adds to it by saying, ""for everyone."" If you like films where there is a definite hero and a definite villain, then skip this one. Here, the main leads are both heroes and they are both villains. There is no right side, there is only what there is, and everyone suffers for it. That's why I liked it. Maybe if more people would look at it that way they wouldn't be quite so eager to blow something up.That said, not the best Hrithik Roshan movie I've ever seen. On the star scale I give it four because of the message, the songs were lovely, and everyone played their characters well. Even the script was far above average, unlike Fiza where the script killed the movie entirely. It's major flaw is that it's ""filmy."" Granted, this is Bollywood and in the early 2000's no less, any long time viewer will tell you to expect ""filmy"" even me! Unfortunately, it does this film a disservice. I often think that Bollywood Directors just do too much! They're in charge of EVERYTHING! From script to song, most of them handle it all. It's a syndrome of ""jack of all trades, master of none.""Note: I say, MOST but there are directors who can and do master all their trades. I'm just not sure Mr. Chopra is one of them.Don't get me wrong, there's more good in the film then bad. But it all could have been so much more polished and for lack of a better term sophisticated. It never quite fulfills it's massive potential. I'm not one of those who object to the song and dance of Bollywood, it's part of what makes it special! But, even though this movie put the Big Three of Bollywood music making on the scene, (Shankar Ehsaan Loy) I wish that the wonderful songs had been used in a more modern way. I keep thinking, 'What if Aamir Khan, or Zoya Akhtar had directed this?' The two very short dance numbers don't showcase Mr. Roshan's amazing abilities, and the songs could have been integrated in a much more natural way.The production values also seem a bit lackluster here. Maybe I just feel that way because the movie isn't in HD, but the trademark vivid imagery that so defines a Hindi film is just not here. At first, I thought this was a deliberate style choice due to the subject matter, but the more I thought about it, I saw that the visuals are just washed out. Even the outdoor cinematography which is usually outstanding in Hindi movies, is lacking. This is especially disappointing considering that the valley the story is set in is supposed to be the most beautiful on earth.The performances range from very good to quite extraordinary. On the 'quite extraordinary' side of the scale belong to Jacky Schroff as the evil Hilal. Watching the film, I knew that the actor was familiar, but I couldn't recognize him. Now, as I write this I simply can't believe that the same man who made me so nervous it felt like worms were crawling up my spine, played Chintubabu inDevdas (2 Disc Set)Dang he's good!The other member of the ""extraordinary"" club is Ms. Sonali Kulkami, who plays Sanjay Dutt's wife, and Hrithik Roshan's adoptive mother. WOW! Why isn't she a star? She is too young to LOOK like her character's age, but she inhabits her character with grace, sincerity, and conviction. She truly is the heart of the story. I hope to see her in more soon, she has real talent.Ms. Zinta gives her usual 'strong woman with a soft heart' performance, but I feel that her character didn't have enough to do, and a bad introduction. As always, I find her chemistry with her leading man warm, charming, and completely without any sexual tension. Thankfully, in their three movies together their characters suite this kind of chemistry. Still, I hope they do another film together at some point, they're a great (if chaste) jodi. It'd be nice if they shook it up a little.Sanjay Dutt, I haven't seen many movies staring him. All my information about him comes from his legal troubles. I didn't expect to like him much as an actor, but he's quite good. At times, his performance does stray into ham territory, BUT again, this is Bollywood in the year 2000, that's the prevailing style. All in all, I think he gave a fine performance. But I doubt I'll become a major fan, from what I've read of his filmography there aren't many films of his I'd enjoy.And finally, Hrithik Roshan, by now anyone whose read my reviews knows there's very little he can do wrong in my eyes. As I said above this isn't a favorite of mine, BUT he does show his brilliance several times throughout the film, and the parts where he's ""hammy"" we'll blame on the time, and the style.All in all, this is a movie to see because it will make you think, the actors are compelling, and the message is one that needs repeating more often.",4,A Shift in Perspective,1382659200,"10 25,
