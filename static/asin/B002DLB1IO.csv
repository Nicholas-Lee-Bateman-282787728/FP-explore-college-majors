What these well-meaning man-children don't realize is that they aren't famous for a reason - they're really not very good. But their self-delusion is almost admirable, and leads you to have sympathy for them as they embark on a European tour, only to be playing to clubs with 10 people in the audience, getting stiffed by clubowners, and being left on the platform with no tickets to the sold out train. On one segment, they are booked into an arena that hold 10,000 people, and then only 174 show up. Ouch! Partly sad and partly funny - often at the same time - this is a poignant documentary of friendship and resilience that even non-metal fans will appreciate.",5,Amazing documentary of a mediocre band,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,756,"['all-too-real', 'documentary', 'heavy-metal', 'band', 'Anvil', 'struggle', 'make', 'What', 'well-meaning', 'man-children', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'are', ""n't"", 'famous', 'reason', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'self-delusion', 'almost', 'admirable', 'have', 'sympathy', 'embark', 'European', 'tour', 'only', 'be', 'playing', 'clubs', '10', 'people', 'audience', 'getting', 'stiffed', 'clubowners', 'being', 'left', 'platform', 'tickets', 'sold', 'out', 'train', 'one', 'segment', 'are', 'booked', 'arena', 'hold', '10,000', 'people', 'then', 'only', '174', 'show', 'up', 'Ouch', 'Partly', 'sad', 'partly', 'funny', 'often', 'same', 'time', 'poignant', 'documentary', 'friendship', 'resilience', 'even', 'non-metal', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil
1263766,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B002DLB1IO,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[0, 1]","Meet the real life Spinal Tap, the guys of Anvil.  As the film proudly proclaims, with such luminaries as Metallica, many influential metal bands from the 80s can list Anvil as one of their influences and sing their praises.  The group has put out 14 albums over a 30 year career, yet have you ever heard of them?  This excellent documentary rectifies that oversight.But the sad thing is, this IS a documentary and is all real.  While Spinal Tap is a funny story about a once-great band bumbling through a comeback tour.  Anvil, unfortunately for them, never really hit it big and is almost a cautionary tale of the rock world.  While many rock and rollers realize by the time they hit their mid 30s that if they haven't yet made it, they tend to pack it in.  Not Anvil.  These guys (naively?) still strive for that elusive brass ring of stardom, and always fall short.  We see every excruciating (funny and uncomfortable) moment of one of their recent tours of crooked club owners, lying A&R; guys and fickle fans.  It gets to the point where it is almost sad to see these two guys chasing an elusive dream.And yet it is oddly inspiring.  This is the story of two guys who refuse to give up their dreams, in the face of in many cases, insurmountable obstacles.  Many bands have banned Spinal Tap on tour buses because it is considered bad luck because of the eerily prescent look at the wacky world of the rock music business world.  This should be another one.  At least you can laugh at Spinal Tap, because that is the point.  In the case of Anvil, this is real and you get an uneasy feeling of laughing at someone who does not deserve it.  The movie actually ends on a high note, proving sometimes that truth IS stranger than fiction.  This is a great movie, worth watching.  Parents, show it to your kids if they are considering entering the music business.  It gives a very unflinching view of the grunge behind the glitz.  As the old saying goes, if it was easy, everyone would do it.  This film shows what happens when one tries and fails, over and over.  Yet they keep coming back for more.  Humorous, sad, hopeful, and in the end, inspiring, this movie is a must for anyone who loves a good story about interesting people.  Not to be missed.",4,"Interesting, Funny or Cautionary Tale?",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2251,"['Meet', 'real', 'life', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'guys', 'Anvil', 'film', 'proudly', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Metallica', 'many', 'influential', 'metal', 'bands', '80s', 'can', 'list', 'Anvil', 'one', 'influences', 'sing', 'praises', 'group', 'put', 'out', '14', 'albums', '30', 'year', 'career', 'yet', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'rectifies', 'oversight.But', 'sad', 'thing', 'documentary', 'real', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'funny', 'story', 'once-great', 'band', 'bumbling', 'comeback', 'tour', 'Anvil', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'really', 'hit', 'big', 'almost', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'rock', 'world', 'many', 'rock', 'rollers', 'realize', 'time', 'hit', 'mid', '30s', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'made', 'tend', 'pack', 'Not', 'Anvil', 'guys', 'naively', 'still', 'strive', 'elusive', 'brass', 'ring', 'stardom', 'always', 'fall', 'short', 'see', 'excruciating', 'funny', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'one', 'recent', 'tours', 'crooked', 'club', 'owners', 'lying', 'A', 'R', 'guys', 'fickle', 'fans', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'sad', 'see', 'two', 'guys', 'chasing', 'elusive', 'dream.And', 'yet', 'oddly', 'inspiring', 'story', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'refuse', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'face', 'many', 'cases', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'Many', 'bands', 'have', 'banned', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'tour', 'buses', 'considered', 'bad', 'luck', 'eerily', 'prescent', 'look', 'wacky', 'world', 'rock', 'music', 'business', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'can', 'laugh', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'point', 'case', 'Anvil', 'real', 'get', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'laughing', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'deserve', 'movie', 'actually', 'high', 'note', 'proving', 'sometimes', 'truth', 'IS', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Parents', 'show', 'kids', 'are', 'considering', 'entering', 'music', 'business', 'very', 'unflinching', 'view', 'grunge', 'glitz', 'old', 'saying', 'was', 'easy', 'everyone', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'tries', 'fails', 'over', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'Humorous', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'end', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'people', 'Not', 'be', 'missed']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil
1263767,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B002DLB1IO,Andrew C Wheeler,"[2, 4]","Everyone in the world has regrets. The only real choice in life is to have most of your regrets be things that you did do, or things that you didn't do. The men in the heavy-metal band Anvil -- the center of the documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil -- are in the unhappy position of regretting the things that they had no control over, and so aren't sure if they did right or wrong.Anvil was an up-and-coming band back in the early '80s, just before that big wave of thrash/death/etc. metal really broke with Megadeth and Metallica and so forth. There's a montage of famous metal musicians, early in Anvil!, all talking about how great and groundbreaking Anvil was back then, and how they upped the game for everyone. (One may consider that these men are mostly being polite and charitable, depending on one's opinion of Anvil's music as shown in the movie.)But Anvil never happened -- maybe because they were from Toronto, maybe because they were always on small labels, maybe because they never had a decent manager, maybe because of bad luck, maybe because their records never sounded as good as they could have, maybe because their songs just weren't good enough, maybe a thousand maybes. But the core of the band -- Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow, the singer and guitarist, and drummer Robb Reiner -- stayed together. At the time this movie was filmed, they were both in their early fifties, and had been playing together since they were both fourteen -- most of that time as Anvil.The movie is then something like the portrait of a long-term marriage; Kudlow and Reiner have been together longer than most marriages, and have been that close most of that time. Kudlow is more annoyed by the failure of Anvil than Reiner is -- they hew pretty close to the stereotype of hair-trigger frontman and phlegmatic drummer in that. It's not the story of their failure -- they didn't exactly fail, anyway, just didn't succeed in the way that they'd hoped for -- but an examination of what it's like to still be chasing that rock 'n' roll dream in middle age, with wives and kids and tedious day-jobs. Kudlow and Reiner are like the guys in ten thousand bar-bands across the civilized world, except that they saw that brass ring, and got close enough to almost touch it.Anvil! has all the things a good rock movie needs to have -- the disastrous tour, led by the hard-working but overwhelmed manager; the big fight during the recording of the make-or-break comeback album; the interviews with die-hard fans; the montage of Big Names explaining why we should care about Anvil; vintage footage from when everyone was younger and had all their hair. If we sometimes get the sense that Kudlow in particular has seen too many rock documentaries and VH1 reality shows, and is trying to live the life he thinks he ought to have rather than the life he has, that's only to be expected. This is rock 'n' roll. It has to be bigger than life, or else it's nothing.",4,When the brass ring just can't be grasped,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,2938,"['Everyone', 'world', 'regrets', 'only', 'real', 'choice', 'life', 'have', 'most', 'regrets', 'be', 'things', 'did', 'do', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'men', 'heavy-metal', 'band', 'Anvil', 'center', 'documentary', 'Anvil', 'Story', 'Anvil', 'are', 'unhappy', 'position', 'regretting', 'things', 'had', 'control', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'did', 'right', 'wrong.Anvil', 'was', 'up-and-coming', 'band', 'back', 'early', ""'80s"", 'just', 'big', 'wave', 'thrash/death/etc', 'metal', 'really', 'broke', 'Megadeth', 'Metallica', 'so', 'forth', 'montage', 'famous', 'metal', 'musicians', 'early', 'Anvil', 'talking', 'how', 'great', 'groundbreaking', 'Anvil', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'how', 'upped', 'game', 'everyone', 'One', 'may', 'consider', 'men', 'are', 'mostly', 'being', 'polite', 'charitable', 'depending', 'one', 'opinion', 'Anvil', 'music', 'shown', 'movie', 'Anvil', 'never', 'happened', 'maybe', 'were', 'Toronto', 'maybe', 'were', 'always', 'small', 'labels', 'maybe', 'never', 'had', 'decent', 'manager', 'maybe', 'bad', 'luck', 'maybe', 'records', 'never', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'maybe', 'songs', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'maybe', 'thousand', 'maybes', 'core', 'band', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Kudlow', 'singer', 'guitarist', 'drummer', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'stayed', 'together', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'were', 'early', 'fifties', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'together', 'were', 'fourteen', 'most', 'time', 'Anvil.The', 'movie', 'then', 'something', 'portrait', 'long-term', 'marriage', 'Kudlow', 'Reiner', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'longer', 'most', 'marriages', 'have', 'been', 'close', 'most', 'time', 'Kudlow', 'more', 'annoyed', 'failure', 'Anvil', 'Reiner', 'hew', 'pretty', 'close', 'stereotype', 'hair-trigger', 'frontman', 'phlegmatic', 'drummer', 'not', 'story', 'failure', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fail', 'anyway', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'way', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'examination', 'what', 'still', 'be', 'chasing', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'dream', 'middle', 'age', 'wives', 'kids', 'tedious', 'day-jobs', 'Kudlow', 'Reiner', 'are', 'guys', 'ten', 'thousand', 'bar-bands', 'civilized', 'world', 'saw', 'brass', 'ring', 'got', 'close', 'enough', 'almost', 'touch', 'it.Anvil', 'things', 'good', 'rock', 'movie', 'have', 'disastrous', 'tour', 'led', 'hard-working', 'overwhelmed', 'manager', 'big', 'fight', 'recording', 'make-or-break', 'comeback', 'album', 'interviews', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'montage', 'Big', 'Names', 'explaining', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'Anvil', 'vintage', 'footage', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'younger', 'had', 'hair', 'sometimes', 'get', 'sense', 'Kudlow', 'particular', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'rock', 'documentaries', 'VH1', 'reality', 'shows', 'trying', 'live', 'life', 'ought', 'have', 'rather', 'life', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'be', 'bigger', 'life', 'else', 'nothing']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

The movie begins with a disastrous tour of Europe, set up by an apparent amateur promoter and fan who talked the band into a tour via a number of email messages.  She promised them 1500 Euro per show.  As you might expect, they got essentially nothing, and the promoter got engaged to one of the band members.  It's a tough 5 weeks for the band, and when they return to Canada they are discouraged, but not so discouraged that they don't muster up the money and the will for a subsequent last shot at stardom.This movie works because Lips and Robb Reiner are such likeable guys with such enthusiasm for their music.  It doesn't hurt that the Anvil classics like ""Metal on Metal"" are really, really good songs.  These guys aren't deluding themselves that they have a hard road, being 50 and attempting to get back on top of a music genre that has, by and large, come and gone.  The intensity and purity of their belief in their eventual success is inspiring and touching, even if they never get past where they are right now.

1263773,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B002DLB1IO,David Ljunggren,"[3, 4]","(Caution, spoiler ahead)This is a wonderfully funny, sad and moving documentary about two close friends who formed a metal band in the early 1980s, made it big very briefly, and then descended into obscurity for decades while the many groups they inspired enjoyed great success. The lead singer and the drummer are in dead end jobs (one delivers school meals, the other operates a power drill) and yet they are convinced, against mounting evidence, that they will make it. What really makes this succeed is the total honesty and emotional openness we see in the two characters, who are often excited, angry or in tears. There are no cold characters here -- everyone, despite their flaws, is warm and honest and reflective.After a part-hilarious and part-tragic tour of Europe, where the large crowds promised by the hapless promoter singularly fail to materialise, Anvil records a demo tape of their 13th album and reestablishes contact with the English music producer who worked on their first album in the 1980s. He is very blunt about why their star faded so quickly -- bad songs, bad production, bad recording labels and bad promotion. The lead singer borrows $25,000 from his sister to make the album and yet, despite all the effort and sacrifice, it attracts little interest.(Here's the spoiler). My problem with the documentary is what comes next. The band are as down on their luck as ever, when all of a sudden, they get a phone call from a Japanese promoter who promises them a big gig in Tokyo. Over they go to Japan and hey presto!, they're playing in a huge space in front of thousands and thousands of young screaming fans, finally hitting the big time after all those years of poverty and frustration. This all seemed just a little bit too convenient to me.That said, the richness of the relationships between the lead singer, the drummer and their families is what makes this stand out. You don't need to know anything about, or even like, metal music. The hapless promoter may be not very good, but she's a warm human being, and ends up marrying one of the back-up band members.The other notable thing about this delightful work is that it's only 80 minutes long, yet never feels forced.

Their music never was the greatest and I believe this is the real reason they didnt make it. Sure, it was fun and had some energy back in the early 80's, but the reason they didnt get further, IMO, is the fact that they were hard to take seriously. Lyrically they were challenged at best! lol.. They had no real label to back them and they didnt evolve as other bands did. Maybe a great producer and a real mix would have gotten them further way back when, but because of the corny lyrics, I believe they were seen as more of a novelty act. There are so many metal bands out there that its hard to see them as more than a very good garage band.That said, this is still a great film to see the behind the scenes BS that many bands face. Especially a band that has been around for 25 years and never quite made a name for themselves. These guys are just a couple of real, nice guys. Its hard not to root for them, and you will find yourself rooting for them when you watch this. The scenes with them meeting some of their heroes is sad and funny. Especially the look on Michael Schenkers face! Priceless.Get this if you like Rock n Roll Doc's. This is one of the best and the people are real. Doubt they will gain a ton of fans of their music because it truly is a niche audience they cater too. But at least they got to make a statement in the end. It really is a cool flick and I admire the director for following his heart in making this. Good luck Lips and Rob! They really have shown in this film that living your dream is most important, regardless of the size of the audience.",4,Behind the scenes of Mediocrity,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,2389,"['saw', 'theatre', 'great', 'flick', 'Honest', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'sad', 'cool', 'see', 'real', 'movie', 'real', 'band', 'God', 'are', 'thousands', 'bands', 'still', 'sticking', 'trying', 'just', 'get', 'making', 'music', 'love', 'one', 'stories', 'real', 'doc', '2', 'great', 'friends', 'who', 'refuse', 'totally', 'throw', 'away', 'dream', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'was', 'real', 'eclipse', 'ending', 'even', 'got', 'play', 'front', 'lot', 'people', 'real', 'point', 'film', 'see', 'relationship', '2', 'best', 'friends', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'aspect', 'will', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'it.4', 'stars', 'ending', 'actual', 'music', 'Listen', 'have', 'known', 'Anvil', 'was', 'teen', 'music', 'never', 'was', 'greatest', 'believe', 'real', 'reason', 'didnt', 'make', 'Sure', 'was', 'fun', 'had', 'energy', 'back', 'early', '80', 'reason', 'didnt', 'get', 'further', 'IMO', 'fact', 'were', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'Lyrically', 'were', 'challenged', 'best', 'lol..', 'had', 'real', 'label', 'back', 'didnt', 'evolve', 'other', 'bands', 'did', 'Maybe', 'great', 'producer', 'real', 'mix', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'further', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'corny', 'lyrics', 'believe', 'were', 'seen', 'more', 'novelty', 'act', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'metal', 'out', 'there', 'hard', 'see', 'more', 'very', 'good', 'garage', 'band.That', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'see', 'scenes', 'BS', 'many', 'bands', 'face', 'Especially', 'band', 'been', '25', 'years', 'never', 'quite', 'made', 'name', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'couple', 'real', 'nice', 'guys', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'will', 'find', 'rooting', 'when', 'watch', 'scenes', 'meeting', 'heroes', 'sad', 'funny', 'Especially', 'look', 'Michael', 'Schenkers', 'face', 'Priceless.Get', 'like', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Doc', 'one', 'best', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'Doubt', 'will', 'gain', 'ton', 'fans', 'music', 'truly', 'niche', 'audience', 'cater', 'too', 'least', 'got', 'make', 'statement', 'end', 'really', 'cool', 'flick', 'admire', 'director', 'following', 'heart', 'making', 'Good', 'luck', 'Lips', 'Rob', 'really', 'have', 'shown', 'film', 'living', 'dream', 'most', 'important', 'regardless', 'size', 'audience']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

At first I thought it might be a spoof film like this is Spinal Tap.  Unfortunately, I recalled the band from an earlier performance shown in the beginning of the film.  I remember discarding them as another bunch of wanna-bes that someone in the universe other than me must really like (King Diamond, Loudness, Kix, (early) Queensryche).  But they were not a band that I thought would never make it altogether.  They had the style and the musicianship to back them up, they just did not have the one break out song they needed to get over the noise festering at the bottom of the pit.That is why this film came as a complete shock to me.  Anvil has made 13 Albums and are no longer on a decent record label (Major or independent)  In fact they are barely known in their own home country of Canada.  This is where the story takes us to and hopefully beyond.  The lead singer is working delivery hot lunches to either schools or nursing homes and his drummer is basically living off the wealth his parents left him.  They have not had a hit nor a decently recorded album in years.  Their new manager hopes to change all this and place them on an European tour that is disaster in the making.I do not want to ruin this film for those who have not seen it, but I will state that by the end of the movie, you are hoping this band will find the success they most desperately crave and become true Rock stars.  It is not Spinal Tap, but a feel good movie about a band who never stopped trying to make the big time.  I just hope this film helps them acheive everything they have worked so hard to gain.",5,The band you may not previously remember but will definitely remember after seeing this movie.,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,1680,"['do', 'not', 'own', 'DVD', 'yet', 'recall', 'seeing', 'film', 'movie', 'theaters', 'first', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'spoof', 'film', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Unfortunately', 'recalled', 'band', 'earlier', 'performance', 'shown', 'beginning', 'film', 'remember', 'discarding', 'bunch', 'wanna-bes', 'someone', 'universe', 'other', 'must', 'really', 'like', 'King', 'Diamond', 'Loudness', 'Kix', 'early', 'Queensryche', 'were', 'not', 'band', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'altogether', 'had', 'style', 'musicianship', 'back', 'up', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'break', 'song', 'needed', 'get', 'noise', 'festering', 'bottom', 'pit.That', 'why', 'film', 'came', 'complete', 'shock', 'Anvil', 'made', '13', 'Albums', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'decent', 'record', 'label', 'Major', 'independent', 'fact', 'are', 'barely', 'known', 'own', 'home', 'country', 'Canada', 'where', 'story', 'hopefully', 'lead', 'singer', 'working', 'delivery', 'hot', 'lunches', 'schools', 'nursing', 'homes', 'drummer', 'basically', 'living', 'off', 'wealth', 'parents', 'left', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'hit', 'decently', 'recorded', 'album', 'years', 'new', 'manager', 'change', 'place', 'European', 'tour', 'disaster', 'making.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ruin', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'will', 'state', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'hoping', 'band', 'will', 'find', 'success', 'most', 'desperately', 'crave', 'become', 'true', 'Rock', 'stars', 'not', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'band', 'who', 'never', 'stopped', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'just', 'hope', 'film', 'acheive', 'everything', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'gain']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

Delli,"[4, 8]","I must start this review stating that I am a musician, I have been actively playing live and as a session man for nearly 30 years, and I've listened to and enjoy just about every kind of music out there, with my favorites being progressive rock, jazz-fusion, AOR/keyboard oriented metal-hard rock, modern rock, some country, new age, classical.Although in the late '80s I pretty much liked 99% of metal bands, when the genre was at its peak, I was never a fan of Anvil, and the reason is because their songwriting was extremely lacking and redundant, as opposed to many of the contemporary metal bands of their time, which had at least a few good songs and decent hooks, but I must say this movie is enjoyable for open minded individuals, regardless. Me included.I firmly believe the whole reason why Anvil never made it, IS because of their crappy songwriting, when the band members and their producer, in this movie, blame their lack of success to the ""crappy production, crappy management...."" lame excuses.If you're a somewhat decent musician, and you can come up with somewhat decent hooks, there will be people out there who will enjoy your music. Anvil's music appealed to mostly hardcore metal fans and listeners who never expected much out of music to begin with.The scenes about the Tiziana Arrigoni character were rather annoying, and I hope those who watch the movie did not get the impression that all Italians are that way.She was just an inept, spoke poor English and that was it.

The movie just might reaffirm your faith in humanity.  Here's four guys that just will not give up; at least for the two original members of the band who have kept Anvil going for more than 30 years.Are they a real-life Spinal Tap?  Yes.  However, they are also real people with real dreams, desires, hopes, and fears.  These guys inspired me because they did not give up, even when trapped in the European tour straight out of Dante's Inferno, with each date becoming increasingly surreal and pathetic.  Even the ending of the movie is so Spinal Tap-like, it's a case of life imitating art, when, at the end of their rope, they are asked to play a gig in Japan that revitalizes their career (just like the end of Spinal Tap).  Quite surreal.  I hope these guys get the success they deserve.One of the bonus features on the DVD is an interesting, if not long-winded interview with Lars Ulrich of Metallica.  Man, that guy could talk the ears off of a donkey.  He gives some good props to Robb Reiner, the drummer of Anvil. Although you can tell Lars is a little self-centered, he seems generous with his praise, and doesn't quite live up to his mean reputation.Another bonus feature is ""a day in the life"" of Lips, the lead singer and guitarist of Anvil, as we follow him around in his job at a food-preparation warehouse (it's clear that this is a low-paying, strenuous job).  Kind of sad in a way, but Lips seems to accept his lot in life with almost zen-like serenity.

1263783,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B002DLB1IO,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[9, 15]","This is a decent film, but not a great one, but it is certainly not ""the greatest film ever made about rock and roll"".  It doesn't really flow like a good film, in fact, jumps around rather incoherently from gig to gig, happening to happening, and it feels unfinished.  The actual story of Anvil is interesting, though.We see Anvil playing really small venues in Europe (including one when they show up 2 hours late and don't get paid because the owner said most of the people have left, and he was right).  Eventually the band got their money for that gig, but it was only 100 euros.  There's also one scene where they play for 174 people in a venue that can hold 10,000 people.  We see Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow talk and talk about how he's not giving up, and how his music makes him feel good, and it's the only thing he loves doing.  We also see his extended family, his wife, sisters, and the like, and while they're supportive of him, they are also weary, and later in the film you can tell that Steve's behaviour is getting to them.  Steve's behaviour is also getting to the drummer, Robb Reiner, Steve's childhood friend and the only other original member of Anvil.  Reiner is actually a good drummer, and a good painter (we see his painting in his house).  He's also a bit of an introvert, and I think Reiner would like to cut Steve loose and quit the band.  There are times in the movie where he almost does, but he always comes back to the band, perhaps out of loyalty and friendship.  To me, Steve seems determined to recapture his lost youth.  He had taste of success when he was very young in the 80's (where Anvil was mentioned along with other bands like Metallica), and he seems desperate to get back to that time.  In an early scene when Anvil is playing a festival, there are other rock legends around, and Steve tries to make conversation with them.  Most of them (like Vanilla Fudge's Carmine Appiece, one of rock's most underrated drummers) don't remember him and/or ignore him.  It's rather sad to see him like this.  He's almost like a high school jock going back to the old high school because he was someone there, but in the real world, he's nobody.As much as it pains me to say, I think the reason that Anvil has never made it big is simply their music is not particularly good.  Metallica, for example, has grown out of their head banging days and go on to make much more complex music.  Steve's guitar playing is decent, and he enjoys it, but his songwriting is pedestrian, and his vocals are just as pedestrian.  You feel for the guy (struggling artist is a bad thing to be, and struggling artists always elicit sympathy from me),but in Anvil's case, the struggle isn't worth it.  The band does have a cult, most of whom have been following them since the early 80's.  In fact, one of them ends up giving Steve a job as a telemarketer (which Steve is no good at).  It's kind of touching, yet sad at the same time.

You can be an innovative band, have the respect of your peers, and have the same access to fans but still not make it into big time Rock 'n' Roll. The story of Anvil is also a story of hope, friendship and following your artistic vision to create something that not only do you like but will be there after you're gone.Anvil is a Heavy Metal band created by childhood friends Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner. They've been together as a band for almost 30 years and while bassists have come and gone they still share a dream to make it to the big time. Their belief in themselves isn't unrealistic, as proved by interviews by such Heavy Metal luminaries as Lars Ullrich, Lemmy (from Motorhead), and Slash attest to. They credit Anvil with being Heavy Metal innovators not only in their music such as songs like Metal On Metal, which Ullrich says other bands used and borrowed without ever looking back, but in stage appearance such as Lips early penchant for wearing bondage outfits onstage, and using dildos as a guitar slide.There is a pathos present too. As the band embarks on a European tour that was managed by an amateur promoter, they played bars where the band almost out number the patrons, or a bar owner that tries to rip them off. There's also the family and friends who are shown and they understand and support the dreams and ambitions of Reiner and Kudlow. A sister of Kudlow going so far as to front money for Anvil to record with Heavy Metal producer Chris Tsangarides (Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy).Why didn't Anvil make it? The movie isn't about that, although, Lips and Robb wrestle with it a little. Lips seems to think it's because in 25 years of Rock `n' Roll they never had good management. Another reason that might explain why they didn't make it goes uncommented on by either the filmmaker or the band themselves. It may be the reason they didn't rise in the Rock `n' Roll world is the band members themselves. During a recording session, which they shelled out 13,000 pounds to producer Chris Tsangarides and for reasons not clear at first, Lips blows up at Reiner and even goes so far as to say Reiner is ""fired."" After an impromptu therapy session run by Tsangarides, Lips and Reiner make up. How much of this played into their not making it to the big time? The movie doesn't delve into that aspect at all, and keeps the focus on their struggles of the present.Some reviewers and critics argue that Anvil just wasn't as good as other bands they were contemporaries with, such as The Scorpions, Bon Jovi, Metallica. I'm not much of an expert on Heavy Metal but both in the vintage footage of them playing in Japan and in hearing songs off their new album This Is Thirteen they sound as good as any other band in the oeuvre. Their music has moments where the music has something of interest, but my only complaint is the same I have for any other Heavy/Speed Metal band, is they blow past those moments too fast looking for the next interesting phrase.The movie seems to elicit Spinal Tap comparisons. Maybe it's because the format resembles Spinal Tap so much. We can't leave out the coincidence that the drummer and founding member of Anvil is Robb Reiner. But there are some Spinal Tap moments in the movie such as when the band is recording and the producer turns up a volume control that you quite clearly can see goes to 11! There is also Reiner's painting of a giant anvil in the middle of a park. Other paintings of his are quite good, reminiscent of Edward Hooper. There are moments the band itself seems cognizant of being like Spinal Tap, such as when the band is being lead to the stage and Lips is delivering a monologue about them being lost backstage.One question I asked myself while watching this movie is, it's very cool to have all those heavy hitting, heavy metal rockers saying how cool and innovative Anvil is, but couldn't they ask Anvil to open for them? That might get them the exposure they need. Hopefully, this film will bring Anvil a larger audience.",5,"Anvil: The Band That Didn't Make It, But Should...",1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,4124,"['Story', 'Anvil', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'living', 'out', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'dreams', 'can', 'be', 'innovative', 'band', 'have', 'respect', 'peers', 'have', 'same', 'access', 'fans', 'still', 'not', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'story', 'Anvil', 'also', 'story', 'hope', 'friendship', 'following', 'artistic', 'vision', 'create', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'there', ""'re"", 'gone.Anvil', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'band', 'created', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Kudlow', 'drummer', 'Robb', 'Reiner', ""'ve"", 'been', 'together', 'band', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'bassists', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'still', 'share', 'dream', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'belief', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'proved', 'interviews', 'such', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Lars', 'Ullrich', 'Lemmy', 'Motorhead', 'Slash', 'attest', 'credit', 'Anvil', 'being', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'innovators', 'not', 'only', 'music', 'such', 'songs', 'Metal', 'Metal', 'Ullrich', 'other', 'bands', 'used', 'borrowed', 'ever', 'looking', 'back', 'stage', 'appearance', 'such', 'Lips', 'early', 'penchant', 'wearing', 'bondage', 'outfits', 'onstage', 'using', 'dildos', 'guitar', 'pathos', 'present', 'too', 'band', 'European', 'tour', 'was', 'managed', 'amateur', 'promoter', 'played', 'bars', 'where', 'band', 'almost', 'number', 'patrons', 'bar', 'owner', 'rip', 'off', 'also', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'shown', 'understand', 'support', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'Reiner', 'Kudlow', 'A', 'sister', 'Kudlow', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'front', 'money', 'Anvil', 'record', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'producer', 'Chris', 'Tsangarides', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', '.Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Anvil', 'make', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Lips', 'Robb', 'wrestle', 'little', 'Lips', 'think', '25', 'years', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'never', 'had', 'good', 'management', 'reason', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'uncommented', 'filmmaker', 'band', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'rise', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'world', 'band', 'members', 'recording', 'session', 'shelled', 'out', '13,000', 'pounds', 'producer', 'Chris', 'Tsangarides', 'reasons', 'not', 'clear', 'first', 'Lips', 'up', 'Reiner', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Reiner', 'fired', 'impromptu', 'therapy', 'session', 'run', 'Tsangarides', 'Lips', 'Reiner', 'make', 'up', 'How', 'much', 'played', 'not', 'making', 'big', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'delve', 'aspect', 'focus', 'struggles', 'present.Some', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'argue', 'Anvil', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'other', 'bands', 'were', 'contemporaries', 'such', 'Scorpions', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'Metallica', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'expert', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'vintage', 'footage', 'playing', 'Japan', 'hearing', 'songs', 'new', 'album', 'Thirteen', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'band', 'oeuvre', 'music', 'moments', 'where', 'music', 'something', 'interest', 'only', 'complaint', 'same', 'have', 'other', 'Heavy/Speed', 'Metal', 'band', 'blow', 'moments', 'too', 'fast', 'looking', 'next', 'interesting', 'phrase.The', 'movie', 'elicit', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'comparisons', 'Maybe', 'format', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'coincidence', 'drummer', 'founding', 'member', 'Anvil', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'are', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'moments', 'movie', 'such', 'when', 'band', 'recording', 'producer', 'up', 'volume', 'control', 'quite', 'clearly', 'can', 'see', '11', 'also', 'Reiner', 'painting', 'giant', 'anvil', 'middle', 'park', 'Other', 'paintings', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'reminiscent', 'Edward', 'Hooper', 'are', 'moments', 'band', 'cognizant', 'being', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'such', 'when', 'band', 'being', 'lead', 'stage', 'Lips', 'delivering', 'monologue', 'being', 'lost', 'question', 'asked', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'cool', 'have', 'heavy', 'hitting', 'heavy', 'metal', 'rockers', 'saying', 'how', 'cool', 'innovative', 'Anvil', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Anvil', 'open', 'might', 'get', 'exposure', 'need', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'Anvil', 'larger', 'audience']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

Swanson,"[1, 2]","I've got to go wait for the limo in the lobby...Clearly the director knew that this is pure uncut Tappishness, and wisely shied away from all comparisons except for the one shot of the volume going to 11. That they actually went to Stonehenge only drives it home: these guys are as Tap as can be. (But, only one drummer so far!)I had such a great time watching this, aided by seeing it with the drummer I've played with for the last ten years. And I play guitar and sing. It's a good thing we've never taken ourselves too seriously, as this might have hit too close to home! We howled at points, especially during the bit with the painting of the anvil. I have truly never seen my friend laugh that hard. He was literally rolling on the couch and choking with laughter. I had tears rolling down my face.They MUST have mentioned Tap during the entire making of this. They HAD TO!! Evvery band I know quotes that thing forever, but these guys live it! Too good.Still, the real greatness of this movie lies in the friendship of Lips and Robb, and especially in the support of their friends and family---except Robb's fat stupid sister, clearly jealous of whatever success they once had and mad that anyone still cares about him. But to counter her we get Lips' older sister, who is so sweet and loving that I almost cried. Now THAT is what family should be about. A gorgeous moment, now vitiated by Anvil's present success.Let's face it: what makes this movie so good is that Anvil are not in fact a great band. They are okay, but miles from Metallica or any other truly fine metal band. Reiner makes the group, clearly, and the scene where we only hear Lips' vocals as he cuts a track points out the main reason they've never made it: a mediocre singer with inane lyrics (""Thumb Hang"", about the Inquistion? Calling Nigel Tufnel, please come to the departure gate...).But the guy is mostly so likeable it's hard to fault him. What this movie is really about is friendship, and the willingness to hold onto a dream long after the expiration date. The bottom line is, these guys can't do anything else, so they keep trying to ""make it"" doing the only thing they could. Metal is a young man's game, but don't tell these guys.One very interesting note: listen to the dvd extra interview with Lars (where he makes 3 points over and over for 20 minutes). He mentions that what made Anvil big back in the day were the tales of their backstage debauchery, and Lips' dildo (he mentions that repeatedly, kinda hilarious in fact). So why did we never hear of this in the movie? I think becasue we'd be less likely to root for these guys had we known that they'd already had the whole rock and roll dream full-on. Once a lifetime is plenty, no? Don't be greedy! But the director knew that would pull sympathy away from them, so he makes it seem like they never quite had enough fun, and thus deserve it now. Good direction, perhaps, but it makes one wonder about all the other stuff left out.In any case, avoiding the endless Tap comparisons was wise, as it makes them all the more glaring for real metal fans, and that's what makes this so much fun to watch.But my hero is Lips' sister. You, madam, are a truly human being.I guess now we'll see a thousand docs on every half-assed band that never made it but thought they should have.

Sherwin,"[4, 7]","Anvil's story may not be the happiest; but it is truly interesting even if you aren't into heavy metal music; and the people we meet in this documentary are actually very endearing. I found myself rooting for the band members more and more as the movie progressed! The film flows along well; and the cinematography works wonders for the picture. The scenes capture the essence of the band both in their brief heyday as well as those awful, countless times when things don't work out for them. There's a lot of footage about their relationships as well; there is in particular a focus on Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and his band mate and buddy for life Robb Reiner.Sure, the band had a hit or two and their music really isn't that bad; but they still weren't strong enough to make a lasting impression on people so they only got their fifteen minutes of fame. They had poor representation more often than not, although things are tough for them especially when Chris Tsangarides, who worked with bands as big as Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy, can't even make it happen for them. They do get one of their biggest fans, Tiziana Arrigoni, to manage them on a European tour but she's so inexpert and her language barriers are so great that you just know that tour is doomed.Yet Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow remains optimistic; he comments in the film that if things went badly ""at least there was a tour for them to go wrong on."" His buddy Robb Reiner, the drummer for Anvil, also still shares Steve's hopes and dreams that even after nearly thirty years of disappointments the band might yet make it. And that's remarkable in and of itself--they play to nearly empty stadiums that could have held thousands of people and they play a nightclub in Munich where there are hardly any patrons to perform for--and suffering the indignity that comes with the shocker announcement from the bar owner that he's not paying them--which they learn of only after they've played!In addition, look for interesting insights and commentary from the family members and wives of ""Lips"" and Robb. There are some mighty good moments there and it all becomes rather poignant; their families want them to succeed and they share Steve's and Robb's frustrations. We also get great footage of Steve working at a catering company where he is well liked although of course he's not truly happy because he's not playing his music; Robb and anyone else playing in the band must also work a relatively boring job to make ends meet.The DVD comes with extras. There are deleted scenes including interviews with two former band members; an optional audio commentary with Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow, Robb Reiner and director Sacha Gervasi; an interview with Lars Ulrich of Metallica; and an extra entitled ""'School Love' in Japan with Sacha."" They're all quite good.Anvil: The Story of Anvil explores the history of the band and lets us meet the leaders of the band as well as some others with the band and a couple of men who left the band after several years. By the time the film is over you'll be rooting for these guys to finally hit it big; we see a very human side of them and their ache for fame and fortune is something many people will identify with. I recommend this film for people who are interested in heavy metal music as well as bands like Anvil that inspired other major bands including Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax. In addition, anyone interested in the pathos that can result when people's dreams are not being realized will find this film quite intriguing.",5,very watchable and intriguing,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,3514,"['Anvil', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happiest', 'truly', 'interesting', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'people', 'meet', 'documentary', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'endearing', 'found', 'rooting', 'band', 'members', 'more', 'more', 'movie', 'progressed', 'film', 'along', 'well', 'cinematography', 'wonders', 'picture', 'scenes', 'capture', 'essence', 'band', 'brief', 'heyday', 'as', 'well', 'awful', 'countless', 'times', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'footage', 'relationships', 'well', 'particular', 'focus', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Kudlow', 'band', 'mate', 'buddy', 'life', 'Robb', 'Reiner.Sure', 'band', 'had', 'hit', 'two', 'music', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'people', 'only', 'got', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'had', 'poor', 'representation', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'things', 'are', 'tough', 'especially', 'when', 'Chris', 'Tsangarides', 'who', 'worked', 'bands', 'as', 'big', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'happen', 'do', 'get', 'one', 'biggest', 'fans', 'Tiziana', 'Arrigoni', 'manage', 'European', 'tour', 'so', 'inexpert', 'language', 'barriers', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'just', 'know', 'tour', 'doomed.Yet', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Kudlow', 'optimistic', 'comments', 'film', 'things', 'went', 'badly', 'least', 'was', 'tour', 'go', 'wrong', 'buddy', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'drummer', 'Anvil', 'also', 'still', 'shares', 'Steve', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'even', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'disappointments', 'band', 'might', 'yet', 'make', 'remarkable', 'play', 'nearly', 'empty', 'stadiums', 'could', 'have', 'held', 'thousands', 'people', 'play', 'nightclub', 'Munich', 'where', 'are', 'hardly', 'patrons', 'perform', 'suffering', 'indignity', 'shocker', 'announcement', 'bar', 'owner', 'not', 'paying', 'learn', 'only', ""'ve"", 'played', 'addition', 'look', 'interesting', 'insights', 'commentary', 'family', 'members', 'wives', 'Lips', 'Robb', 'are', 'mighty', 'good', 'moments', 'there', 'rather', 'poignant', 'families', 'want', 'succeed', 'share', 'Steve', 'Robb', 'frustrations', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'footage', 'Steve', 'working', 'catering', 'company', 'where', 'well', 'liked', 'course', 'not', 'truly', 'happy', 'not', 'playing', 'music', 'Robb', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'band', 'must', 'also', 'work', 'relatively', 'boring', 'job', 'make', 'ends', 'meet.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'interviews', 'two', 'former', 'band', 'members', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Kudlow', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'director', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'interview', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'Metallica', 'extra', 'entitled', ""'School"", 'Love', 'Japan', 'Sacha', ""'re"", 'quite', 'good.Anvil', 'Story', 'Anvil', 'history', 'band', 'meet', 'leaders', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'band', 'couple', 'men', 'who', 'left', 'band', 'several', 'years', 'time', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'guys', 'finally', 'hit', 'big', 'see', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'ache', 'fame', 'fortune', 'something', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'identify', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'bands', 'Anvil', 'inspired', 'other', 'major', 'bands', 'including', 'Metallica', 'Slayer', 'Anthrax', 'addition', 'anyone', 'interested', 'pathos', 'can', 'result', 'when', 'people', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'realized', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'quite', 'intriguing']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

Most documentaries tell a bunch of facts, and if you like the subject and they're okay to watch.  But this movie tells a story, with a beginning, middle and end.  It touches all the emotions and just when you thought things couldn't get worse for the group Anvil, Sascha, the director, figures out a way to make you feel their pain, and then gives you the perfect ending.  This is not a standard documentary, this is a movie, and a very good one.  And one that actually accomplished something.  Since the movie was released, Anvil has finally seen their dreams come true.  Because of the story, and the response to the movie, the group has gotten a record deal, and a US Tour is coming up in 2010, and they recently opened at Giants Stadium in NYC for AC/DC.As for the DVD itself, I don't often take the time to watch movies while listening to the commentary track.

I can recall somebody taping me some songs from Metal on Metal (their supposed masterpiece) around 1985 and always fast forwarding the cassette when they came up. They weren't really that bad, they just sounded lame, like some lesser talented Manowar with boring songs and no charisma. My best guess is that back in the day, some people outside Canada listened to them simply because they weren't that many bands to choose from, and that their rapid slide into irrelevance was more a consequence of their lack of talent rather than management and record label woes.The movie makes a big deal about how important they were in shaping the early sound of thrash metal, but really, I don't see how this band could've influenced Metallica, Anthrax or anyone for that matter. While Venom, Diamond Head, Mot&ouml;rhead, Raven and Exciter had a seminal role bridging the NWOBHM with early thrash, Anvil was just a standard radio metal band that couldn't write good singles.Now, don't get me wrong. I do admire these guys, but not because of their musical legacy, and being a guy who quit his own band at 26 and music altogether at 30 because juggling between two careers was too hard, I can't feel nothing but respect for this duo.The Story of Anvil struck a chord on a lot of people because it's not really about an unsuccessful, over the hill heavy metal band: it's a testimony to friendship, never giving up on your dreams and the power music has on people.Back when I saw this movie in 2010, I was so moved by it that I bought Metal on Metal and Forged in Fire. Sadly, both albums confirmed me, at 38, what I already knew at 12: this band's just not that good, or even mildly interesting.That said, this documentary manages to be both a fun ride and an incredible study on human nature that any music lover will doubtlessly enjoy... and will be Anvil's ultimate legacy.Notable DVD Extras:Aside from a rather uninteresting commentary track, there are three enlightening deleted scenes. The first one features extra footage of Lips working as a caterer, the second, the story of Lips' older brother's medical problems, and the third, short ""where are they now"" style interviews with two original members who left the band in 1989.

And for many reasons I can think of, but the most obvious one is that I can totally relate to this band because I suffered an even more unsatisfying demise in my own musical journey than Anvil did. In my case I gave everything I had for more than 25 years to make something lasting in the music industry. I played in front of more people than Anvil ever did, I wrote many songs that were as good or even better than what Anvil put out, yet I couldn't even gain the noteriety that this band had. It breaks my heart because their music is really very good metal. It reminded me of the work of underground artist Rozz Williams who founded the band's Christian Death and Shadow Project. Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson admitted that without Rozz's musical creativity they never would have found their success with their music. yet major label success was to never be for him, and in 1998 he commited suicide. But for every artist that makes it, there are thousands more that are even better that are never even discovered. I remember when Metalica became famous, it seemed to make no sense to me because there were other bands out there doing the same kind of music even before they were and doing it better. I remember a band from Hawaii called Sacred Rite. Their first album called simply- Sacred Rite is still one of the best metal albums I have ever heard, yet none of you have probably ever heard of them. They simply never got the noteriety they deserved either. And so the sad reality is the music industry is an ugly business. It is really like winning the lottery. It's all chance and miracles no matter how good your music is. Like Anvil I am still hoping for that big break some day but it is not likely to happen.

1263803,A2CPM6WTF7PO3G,B002DLB1IO,"Red Xala ""~23~""","[5, 8]","I remember hearing a little bit about ANVIL during the 80's, but they truly were overshadowed and overlooked during the heyday of the classic heavy metal era. My general recollection was (and still is) that they were sort of a bunch of clowns on the rock scene. Early on in the film, there are some brief segments of concert footage of the band from their zenith in 1984; the lead singer/guitarist Steve ""Lipps"" Kudlow is wearing a thin mesh S & M shirt, a studded neck collar, and he's playing his guitar with a woman's vibrator. It's good for a laugh, but the image of an ugly heavy metal drag queen armed with a dildo may have been a bit much for the average ""metal"" fan at the time. Who knows?At many points in the film, it felt like I was watching a Spinal Tap-style spoof; ""Lipps"" oftentimes comes off as hyperbolic and just plain goofy, particularly when he was nearly getting into physical altercations with first a club manager in Prague who refused to pay the band after a show, and then with his life long friend and drummer of the band, Robb Reiner. I would be laughing at many of these scenes until I started seeing tears streaming down their faces, or some of their family members' faces -- It was at these moments I started thinking to myself ""Jesus, this is actually real. This heavy metal version of ""Bob & Doug McKenzie"" has been scratching out this meager musical existence for over 30 years, holding out a quixotic hope that they will eventually achieve stardom."" Part of me felt truly sorry for the band; part of me felt like they were pathetic aging rockers who should have packed it in a long time ago. Most of all, I felt sorry for the family members of the band; the wives, the siblings, and the band members' children who had also been forced to endure the protracted failure of ANVIL; when the older sister of ""Lipps"" wearily agrees to allow the band to borrow $18,000L to make a high quality production for their 13th album, I actually started to cringe. All I could think was that, yet again, this was going to be another ANVIL failure, and that this poor woman was going to lose all of her money. At first, this seemed to be the case; no major record label was interested in picking up the album. However, in the 21st century internet age, it's become obvious that the major record labels are becoming obsolete - Why depend on the record companies for something that you can now effectively do yourself? This is what ANVIL did, and this is what made their windfall - A Japanese booking agent listens to a copy of their new album, loves it, and then invites them to Japan to play in front of 20,000 screaming fans.  Coupled with the release of this film at Sundance, and support from high profile musicians such as Slash of Guns n' Roses and Lars Ulrich of Metallica, ANVIL seems to have finally achieved their dream.  I was also happy to read on their Wikipedia page that ""Lipps"" has repaid the money borrowed from his sister to record their album.  Truly, it's a one-in-a-million miracle for the band.Best of luck to them in the future.",3,"I felt like I was watching a real life version of ""This is Spinal Tap""",1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,3067,"['remember', 'hearing', 'little', 'bit', 'ANVIL', '80', 'truly', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'overlooked', 'heyday', 'classic', 'heavy', 'metal', 'era', 'general', 'recollection', 'was', 'still', 'were', 'sort', 'bunch', 'clowns', 'rock', 'scene', 'Early', 'film', 'are', 'brief', 'segments', 'concert', 'footage', 'band', 'zenith', '1984', 'lead', 'singer/guitarist', 'Steve', 'Lipps', 'Kudlow', 'wearing', 'thin', 'mesh', 'S', 'M', 'shirt', 'studded', 'neck', 'collar', 'playing', 'guitar', 'woman', 'vibrator', 'good', 'laugh', 'image', 'ugly', 'heavy', 'metal', 'drag', 'queen', 'armed', 'dildo', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'much', 'average', 'metal', 'fan', 'time', 'Who', 'many', 'points', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Spinal', 'Tap-style', 'spoof', 'Lipps', 'oftentimes', 'off', 'hyperbolic', 'just', 'plain', 'goofy', 'particularly', 'when', 'was', 'nearly', 'getting', 'physical', 'altercations', 'first', 'club', 'manager', 'Prague', 'who', 'refused', 'pay', 'band', 'show', 'then', 'life', 'long', 'friend', 'drummer', 'band', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'would', 'be', 'laughing', 'many', 'scenes', 'started', 'seeing', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'family', 'members', 'was', 'moments', 'started', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Jesus', 'actually', 'real', 'heavy', 'metal', 'version', 'Bob', 'Doug', 'McKenzie', 'been', 'scratching', 'out', 'meager', 'musical', 'existence', '30', 'years', 'holding', 'out', 'quixotic', 'hope', 'will', 'eventually', 'achieve', 'stardom', 'Part', 'felt', 'truly', 'sorry', 'band', 'part', 'felt', 'were', 'pathetic', 'aging', 'rockers', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'packed', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Most', 'felt', 'sorry', 'family', 'members', 'band', 'wives', 'siblings', 'band', 'members', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'forced', 'endure', 'protracted', 'failure', 'ANVIL', 'when', 'older', 'sister', 'Lipps', 'wearily', 'allow', 'band', 'borrow', '18,000L', 'make', 'high', 'quality', 'production', '13th', 'album', 'actually', 'started', 'cringe', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'yet', 'again', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'ANVIL', 'failure', 'poor', 'woman', 'was', 'going', 'lose', 'money', 'first', 'seemed', 'be', 'case', 'major', 'record', 'label', 'was', 'interested', 'picking', 'up', 'album', 'However', '21st', 'century', 'internet', 'age', 'become', 'obvious', 'major', 'record', 'labels', 'are', 'becoming', 'obsolete', 'Why', 'depend', 'record', 'companies', 'something', 'can', 'now', 'effectively', 'do', 'what', 'ANVIL', 'did', 'what', 'made', 'windfall', 'Japanese', 'booking', 'agent', 'copy', 'new', 'album', 'then', 'Japan', 'play', 'front', '20,000', 'screaming', 'fans', 'Coupled', 'release', 'film', 'Sundance', 'support', 'high', 'profile', 'musicians', 'such', 'Slash', 'Guns', 'n', 'Roses', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'Metallica', 'ANVIL', 'have', 'finally', 'achieved', 'dream', 'was', 'also', 'happy', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'Lipps', 'repaid', 'money', 'borrowed', 'sister', 'record', 'album', 'Truly', 'one-in-a-million', 'miracle', 'band.Best', 'luck', 'future']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

1263806,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002DLB1IO,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Sometimes pioneers just don't get the credit they deserve.  Take Anvil, a band that helped to define much of what is meant by the term ""heavy-metal"" (their signature album was in fact called ""Metal on Metal""), yet a band that never achieved the kind of worldwide fame or notoriety that groups like Metallica, Twisted Sister, Slayer, Megadeth, Guns & Roses or Motorhead did while following in Anvil's footsteps.  Now, thanks to the documentary ""Anvil: The Story of Anvil,""  that injustice may, at least in part, have been rectified.Director Sacha Gervasi took her cameras to Toronto, Canada to catch up with two of the original members - lead guitarist Steve ""Lips"" Ludlow and drummer Robb Reiner - who are busy raising families and holding down jobs during the day, while still rocking out as Anvil (with additional members) in local clubs at night.  Yet the dream of ""achieving bigger and better things ahead"" persists.  The first step in fulfilling that dream comes in the form of a tour of Europe - a tour that, thanks to incompetent management and a flurry of scheduling missteps, turns into an aggravating comedy of errors, with the group stuck playing in rickety venues to decidedly under-whelming crowds for virtually no money.  Yet, unbowed and unbroken, the band members continue to forge ahead, staying true to their dream.Next up is the recording and promoting of a new album, even though securing the funding for that endeavor presents a nearly insurmountable obstacle to these two working-class dudes.  But the members know they are fighting a losing battle against aging and time (Lips is already in his 50s) and that if they don't strike while the iron's hot, such an opportunity may be lost forever.As subjects for a documentary, Lips and Reiner are wonderfully appealing in the openhearted frankness and unflappable optimism they display in the face of some pretty daunting setbacks.  Indeed, the movie is at its most compelling when it focuses on the complex, tumultuous relationship between these two lifelong partners and buddies (they often refer to each other as ""brothers"") who tear each other down almost as much as they build each other up, who cater to one another`s weaknesses almost as much they reinforce one another`s strengths.  Yet, it is a relationship that has worked for them for decades and has helped them remain hopeful through a lifetime of disappointments.In fact, if there's any lesson to be gleaned from the story of Anvil, it's that a good dream will never die - provided you never give up trying to achieve it.",4,a dream that never dies,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,2554,"['Sometimes', 'pioneers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'credit', 'deserve', 'Take', 'Anvil', 'band', 'helped', 'define', 'much', 'what', 'meant', 'term', 'heavy-metal', 'signature', 'album', 'was', 'fact', 'called', 'Metal', 'Metal', 'yet', 'band', 'never', 'achieved', 'kind', 'worldwide', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'groups', 'Metallica', 'Twisted', 'Sister', 'Slayer', 'Megadeth', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'Motorhead', 'did', 'following', 'Anvil', 'footsteps', 'Now', 'thanks', 'documentary', 'Anvil', 'Story', 'Anvil', 'injustice', 'may', 'least', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'rectified.Director', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'took', 'cameras', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'catch', 'up', 'two', 'original', 'members', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Steve', 'Lips', 'Ludlow', 'drummer', 'Robb', 'Reiner', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'raising', 'families', 'holding', 'down', 'jobs', 'day', 'still', 'rocking', 'out', 'Anvil', 'additional', 'members', 'local', 'clubs', 'night', 'dream', 'achieving', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'ahead', 'persists', 'first', 'step', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'form', 'tour', 'Europe', 'tour', 'thanks', 'incompetent', 'management', 'flurry', 'scheduling', 'missteps', 'aggravating', 'comedy', 'errors', 'group', 'stuck', 'playing', 'rickety', 'venues', 'decidedly', 'under-whelming', 'crowds', 'virtually', 'money', 'unbowed', 'unbroken', 'band', 'members', 'continue', 'forge', 'ahead', 'staying', 'true', 'dream.Next', 'up', 'recording', 'promoting', 'new', 'album', 'even', 'securing', 'funding', 'endeavor', 'nearly', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle', 'two', 'working-class', 'dudes', 'members', 'know', 'are', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'aging', 'time', 'Lips', 'already', '50s', 'do', ""n't"", 'strike', 'iron', 'hot', 'such', 'opportunity', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'forever.As', 'subjects', 'documentary', 'Lips', 'Reiner', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'appealing', 'openhearted', 'frankness', 'unflappable', 'optimism', 'display', 'face', 'pretty', 'daunting', 'setbacks', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'most', 'compelling', 'when', 'complex', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'two', 'lifelong', 'partners', 'buddies', 'often', 'refer', 'other', 'brothers', 'who', 'tear', 'other', 'down', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'build', 'other', 'up', 'who', 'cater', 'one', 's', 'almost', 'much', 'reinforce', 'one', 's', 'strengths', 'Yet', 'relationship', 'worked', 'decades', 'helped', 'remain', 'hopeful', 'lifetime', 'disappointments.In', 'fact', 'lesson', 'be', 'gleaned', 'story', 'Anvil', 'good', 'dream', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'provided', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'achieve']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

Unfortunately, Anvil never quite made it. About twenty years after heavy metal died, filmmakers caught up with Kudlow and Reiner. The result is the charming documentary Anvil: The Story of Anvil.By the 2000s, Anvil was releasing music on obscure record labels and touring small bars. The documentary includes memorable footage from a disastrous European tour. The tour was organized by a fan and the band was left with no transportation, few fans at their gigs, and - often - no pay.But the Anvil documentary is not just another ""Spinal Tap"" in which viewers jeer at a bunch of losers. Viewers cheer for these guys. Why?Anvil is a story of friendship. Viewers like Lips and Reiner because they come across as down-to-earth guys who love to play heavy metal. Both men come from Jewish immigrant families. Reiner's family supported his involvement in music; Lips' did not. Their friendship is closer than the relationship that either enjoys with his wife.Also, this is a movie about dreamers and the importance of dreams in our lives.

1263809,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B002DLB1IO,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[4, 4]","Anvil! The Story of Anvil - I heard this movie was very very good - and the trailer certainly leads you to believe this would be so too - but I was still completely unprepared for the emotional roller coaster I was about to experience. Watching Lips and Robb travel the rocky road of life for 90 minutes was way more intimate than any other rock documentary that I've ever seen. I'm still a bit teary-eyed, nearly three hours after watching it.  Hearing these mountains of praise for the band from band members of Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax as well as Slash was really something. ""Everybody ripped them off and left them for dead,"" says Slash, voicing an idea which could have easily been the title of the film. Ultimately, the love and emotion between these guys for their cause, and their art, is unconquerable, even if you do get a major laugh at Robb's painting to ""The Megalithic Anvil Monument"", you can see that the spirit is just that huge (Robb's paintings are really very good, including the one of the drumkit, and the one that hangs at the top of his staircase, which will fetch millions on auction some day). On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie gets a 98% approval rating, which means that out of 123 reviews there cannot be more then two that are negative, making it just about the highest-ever rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It is well deserved. I'd watch the movie again, but I don't know if I'm ready to have my heart put through the wringer again so soon.After I watched the movie, I went and read everything I could find out about the band. The story about Sacha Gervasi, and how he had been their roadie at 16, went off and done all sorts of incredible things, and then re-entered their lives to make this movie, is amazing. His touching personal note at the movie's website is also something amazing to read. I bought a signed DVD with extras for $20 on their website, I'm sure it's going to be well worth it.The band's classic album, ""Metal on Metal"", was released in 1982, and I remember hearing several songs from it on the radio, including the title track and ""Stop Me."" Great tunes. That year Slash was 17, Lars Ulrich of Metallica and Scott Ian of Anthrax were 19 and Tom Araya of Slayer was 21. Now, 27 years later, people are still talking about it. Amazing.This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. Don't watch ""Avatar"", watch ""Anvil""!For those who love Anvil for those that love the Anvil movie, there's nothing like owning a copy DVD signed by Lips and Robb.  The DVD does offer a few interesting tidbits, the most ""interesting"" (not sure that's the right word) is the full interview with Lars, where we see what director Sacha Gervasi had to go through to get a soundbite out of rock's most eager interviewee (this guy can talk and talk and talk).Other extras are three deleted scenes (""Children's Catering"", ""Former Band Members"", ""Lips' Brother"") and a scene of Sacha drumming with the band's performance of ""School Love"" in Japan. Of the deleted scenes, ""Former Band Members"" should have been in the film, as it interviews two of the five ex-Anvil guitarists and bassists. INterviewed is Dave ""Squirrelly"" Allison, a formerly skinny metalhead who's turned into a middle-aged Canadian hoser with a mullet, baseball cap and mustache driving a pickup and chilling out at his cottage up north. More interesting is former bass player Ian ""Dix"" Dickson, who was a handsome Steve Harris-type young metaller who has turned into a successful artisan/goth/lutist with a home arts and crafts studio. Drinks his coffee from a cool skull mug.The ""Children's Catering"" scene is extended out of scenes that are in the movie, the most part of it shows Lips driving to work, talking about his life and the jobs he's had (delivering flowers, delivering fish), his aborted studies in cinematography, the end of a fifteen year relationship chronicled on the ""Worth the Weight"" album, a.k.a. the death album (death of Robb's father, death of Lips' marriage, flower deliveries to funeral homes where he saw his first dead bodies, etc.). That is also the theme of the segment Lips' brother Jeffrey, who has been diagnosed with a neural degenerative disease and only has a short time left. The clip shows Lips with siblings Jeffrey, Gary and Rhonda in Birmingham, Alabama, it is a very sad, private moment.",5,They rock!!!,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,4317,"['Anvil', 'Story', 'Anvil', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'trailer', 'certainly', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'too', 'was', 'still', 'completely', 'unprepared', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'was', 'about', 'experience', 'Watching', 'Lips', 'Robb', 'travel', 'rocky', 'road', 'life', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'intimate', 'other', 'rock', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'still', 'bit', 'teary-eyed', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'watching', 'Hearing', 'mountains', 'praise', 'band', 'band', 'members', 'Metallica', 'Slayer', 'Anthrax', 'as', 'well', 'Slash', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'Everybody', 'ripped', 'off', 'left', 'dead', 'Slash', 'voicing', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'title', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'love', 'emotion', 'guys', 'cause', 'art', 'unconquerable', 'even', 'do', 'get', 'major', 'laugh', 'Robb', 'painting', 'Megalithic', 'Anvil', 'Monument', 'can', 'see', 'spirit', 'just', 'huge', 'Robb', 'paintings', 'are', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'including', 'one', 'drumkit', 'one', 'top', 'staircase', 'will', 'fetch', 'millions', 'auction', 'day', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'movie', '98', '%', 'approval', 'rating', '123', 'reviews', 'there', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'then', 'two', 'are', 'negative', 'making', 'just', 'highest-ever', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'well', 'deserved', ""'d"", 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'ready', 'have', 'heart', 'put', 'wringer', 'again', 'so', 'soon.After', 'watched', 'movie', 'went', 'read', 'everything', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'band', 'story', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'how', 'had', 'been', 'roadie', '16', 'went', 'off', 'done', 'sorts', 'incredible', 'things', 'then', 're-entered', 'lives', 'make', 'movie', 'amazing', 'touching', 'personal', 'note', 'movie', 'website', 'also', 'something', 'amazing', 'read', 'bought', 'signed', 'DVD', 'extras', '20', 'website', ""'m"", 'sure', 'going', 'be', 'well', 'it.The', 'band', 'classic', 'album', 'Metal', 'Metal', 'was', 'released', '1982', 'remember', 'hearing', 'several', 'songs', 'radio', 'including', 'title', 'track', 'Stop', 'Me', 'Great', 'tunes', 'year', 'Slash', 'was', '17', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'Metallica', 'Scott', 'Ian', 'Anthrax', 'were', '19', 'Tom', 'Araya', 'Slayer', 'was', '21', 'Now', '27', 'years', 'later', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'talking', 'Amazing.This', 'far', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Avatar', 'watch', 'Anvil', 'who', 'love', 'Anvil', 'love', 'Anvil', 'movie', 'nothing', 'owning', 'copy', 'DVD', 'signed', 'Lips', 'Robb', 'DVD', 'offer', 'few', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'most', 'interesting', 'not', 'sure', 'right', 'word', 'full', 'interview', 'Lars', 'where', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Sacha', 'Gervasi', 'had', 'go', 'get', 'soundbite', 'rock', 'most', 'eager', 'interviewee', 'guy', 'can', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', '.Other', 'extras', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Children', 'Catering', 'Former', 'Band', 'Members', 'Lips', 'Brother', 'scene', 'Sacha', 'drumming', 'band', 'performance', 'School', 'Love', 'Japan', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Former', 'Band', 'Members', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'two', 'five', 'ex-Anvil', 'guitarists', 'bassists', 'INterviewed', 'Dave', 'Squirrelly', 'Allison', 'formerly', 'skinny', 'metalhead', 'who', 'turned', 'middle-aged', 'Canadian', 'hoser', 'mullet', 'baseball', 'cap', 'mustache', 'driving', 'pickup', 'chilling', 'out', 'cottage', 'up', 'north', 'More', 'interesting', 'former', 'bass', 'player', 'Ian', 'Dix', 'Dickson', 'who', 'was', 'handsome', 'Steve', 'Harris-type', 'young', 'metaller', 'who', 'turned', 'successful', 'artisan/goth/lutist', 'home', 'arts', 'crafts', 'studio', 'coffee', 'cool', 'skull', 'mug.The', 'Children', 'Catering', 'scene', 'extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'Lips', 'driving', 'work', 'talking', 'life', 'jobs', 'had', 'delivering', 'flowers', 'delivering', 'fish', 'aborted', 'studies', 'cinematography', 'end', 'fifteen', 'year', 'relationship', 'chronicled', 'Weight', 'album', 'a.k.a', 'death', 'album', 'death', 'Robb', 'father', 'death', 'Lips', 'marriage', 'flower', 'deliveries', 'funeral', 'homes', 'where', 'saw', 'first', 'dead', 'bodies', 'etc.', 'also', 'theme', 'segment', 'Lips', 'brother', 'Jeffrey', 'who', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'neural', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'left', 'clip', 'Lips', 'siblings', 'Jeffrey', 'Gary', 'Rhonda', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'very', 'sad', 'private', 'moment']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil

1263812,A13Y06X4O7WRY9,B002DLB1IO,"vitajex ""11th Duke of Chalfont""","[1, 2]","Often promoted as a real-life 'This is Spinal Tap', Anvil: The Story of Anvil documents the struggles of an aging, Canadian heavy metal band. Interviews with famous metal musicians such as Slash, Lars Ulrich and Scott Ian reveal that Anvil was very influential in the early rise of the 80's metal scene. The band never reached the heights of popularity achieved by those that followed them and wallowed in obscurity for 20+ years, releasing over-looked and quickly forgotten albums (interestingly, of the 19 albums listed on their discography, all but 2 have three word titles). Now in their 50's, the band attempts one last grasp at the brass ring, sinking themselves and those around them deep into dept to finance a 13th studio album 'This is Thirteen'. The film follows Anvil on a less-than-impressive tour full of missed trains, double-crossing club owners and audiences numbering in the teens. As far as comparisons to 'Spinal Tap', I feel they are unwarranted. The only similarities I saw were the aging rockers, refusing to 'grow up' and get 'real jobs' and give up their dreams. There's definitely a very juvenile slant to these gentlemen, both in their writing styles (oft-strained double entendres and suburban Satanic symbolism) and in their relationships with each other and with the 'business' part of 'show business'. However, the film is NOT a comedy. It is more of an inspirational portrait of two men who have never, and probably will never, stop rocking.",4,'What Do You Wanna Do With Your Life?'- 'I WANNA ROCK!',1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,1473,"['Often', 'promoted', 'real-life', ""'This"", 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Anvil', 'Story', 'Anvil', 'documents', 'struggles', 'aging', 'Canadian', 'heavy', 'metal', 'band', 'Interviews', 'famous', 'metal', 'musicians', 'such', 'Slash', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'Scott', 'Ian', 'reveal', 'Anvil', 'was', 'very', 'influential', 'early', 'rise', '80', 'metal', 'scene', 'band', 'never', 'reached', 'heights', 'popularity', 'achieved', 'followed', 'wallowed', 'obscurity', '20+', 'years', 'releasing', 'over-looked', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'albums', 'interestingly', '19', 'albums', 'listed', 'discography', '2', 'have', 'three', 'word', 'titles', 'Now', '50', 'band', 'one', 'last', 'grasp', 'brass', 'ring', 'sinking', 'deep', 'dept', 'finance', '13th', 'studio', 'album', 'Thirteen', 'film', 'Anvil', 'less-than-impressive', 'tour', 'full', 'missed', 'trains', 'double-crossing', 'club', 'owners', 'audiences', 'numbering', 'teens', 'As', 'far', 'comparisons', ""'Spinal"", 'Tap', 'feel', 'are', 'unwarranted', 'only', 'similarities', 'saw', 'were', 'aging', 'rockers', 'refusing', ""'grow"", 'up', 'get', ""'real"", 'jobs', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'definitely', 'very', 'juvenile', 'slant', 'gentlemen', 'writing', 'styles', 'oft-strained', 'double', 'entendres', 'suburban', 'Satanic', 'symbolism', 'relationships', 'other', ""'business"", 'part', ""'show"", 'business', 'However', 'film', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'more', 'inspirational', 'portrait', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'rocking']",Anvil: The Story of Anvil
