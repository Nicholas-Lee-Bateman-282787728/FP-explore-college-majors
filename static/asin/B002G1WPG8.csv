It would have helped to have more deformed bad guys rather than just one throughout the whole film. As there are families of baddies in the woods I though the film would have progressed from the second film and developed more of a story into the third film but this doesn't happen. The gore is what you expect with a couple of tasty deaths but the acting really is bad and let's the film down badly.You can see why this was a straight to DVD movie..hopefully they don't try and make a 4th one unless a good budget is used.

It's not bad, just a little different from the rest.  The start of the film has young people ""as usual"" rafting down the river in the backwoods.  Well, they are killed off, all but 1 girl in the first 5 min.Then for the last hour and more, we see a bunch of convicts wondering around the woods getting killed by 1 or 2 hillbillys.  That's it.It is a good slasher flick in my opinion.  It's a necessary piece to complete the trilogy.  I just wish it would of had a little more story behind it, instead of a mess of mindless kills.

1267243,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002G1WPG8,David J. Brown,"[4, 5]","The first Wrong Turn came out in the time when horror was just getting revitalized with the Saw films and a slew of successful remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Dawn of the Dead.  It also was part of the time's trend in that it was a non-self-referencial horror film that also was paying homage to the type of horror that was vogue in the mid to late 70's.  The Texas Chainsaw remake and Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses were also part of this wave.  The first Wrong Turn was surprisingly entertaining for me.  It was stylishly made and directed by Rob Shmidt(Crime + Punishment in Suburbia), fun, and well acted.  Sure, it was nothing original and towards the third act when the villains reluctance to die, no matter how hardcore the damage they took, pushed credulity, but I still enjoyed it and it brought me back to memories of the original Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes, Last House on the Left, and Eaten Alive.  It was good entertainment. Then years later the direct to video sequel, Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, was released and received much positive attention by fans and professional horror critics.  It was energetically directed by first timer Joe Lynch(who was a clerk at 112 Video, a store I rented my horror from in my youth here in New York). It switched tones to more balls-out, in your face splatstick.  It had a novel premise involving the hillbilly mutants attacking a group of contestants on a new reality show(very timely), and it had Henry Rollins pulling a Rambo and just being plain bad-a##!  It was funny, fun, gross, well acted, and totally over the top to the point of hysteria.  It's surprise success led to Fox now owning a profitable direct to video franchise and the inevitable Wrong Turn 3 was put into works.  Well, here it is, and I assure you it won't go over as well as the previous films.  It's quite mediocre and boring and the total quick death of this fun franchise.None of the creative team, writers or directors, return for Wrong Turn 3, but that shouldn't be a negative sign due to the fact that that was the case with the fist sequel.  Fox lets newcomers take a stab at their franchise and hope for the best.  Well, this time they lost the hand.  Director Declan O'brien isn't a first timer either when it comes to genre material.  He's a veteran of Sci-Fi(I mean, Sy-Fy, D'oh) original productions like Cyclops and Rock Monster.  I don't hold this against him.  I was hoping this Wrong Turn sequel would be his road to legitimacy.  His experience with the Sy-Fy Network means that he's a solid, fast working, journeyman director who can add flare to the lowest budgets, short scheduled shoot.  Well, here the only thing the director contributes is efficiency.  Unlike the previous Wrong Turn installments this film is without style.  It's all by the numbers.  There's no real or believable set ups.  No suspense.  It's just A to B to the next bloody death, and this film has the highest body count of all the Wrong Turn films.  And the acting is mostly horrible.  The lead prisoner bad guy, Chavez, is effective and the actor playing the hostage prison guard is good, but the rest of the cast, big or small parts, is terrible.  It doesn't help that the script gives them dialogue only master thespians like Laurence Olivier could make convincing.  I would say it's bad because nobody is committed to the characters, but it's worse then that, they are committed and their lack of acting chops makes it even more intolerable.Plus, after Wrong Turn 2's ingenious, creative, and timely set up this film's plot is a real boring downer.  It's been done so many times before, and done better.  It's your basic plot about escaped convicts trying to make it out of the woods and holding some good guys hostage while they're all attacked by some inbred mutant hillbillys.  Yawn.  Been there done that.  Sure, that's not a real problem if the director and the screenwriter are able to transcend the material and make the audience feel like we've never seen it before, but this film ain't that film.  Plus, to make matters worse we spend more time with the convicts fighting each other over some conveniently found cash them we do with the survival of the fittest premise of man versus hillbilly.  Hell, this script is so ham-fisted, it made Crocodile II(which had the same plot), seem downright Shakespearian.  Also, unlike the previous films this one only focus on two mutants, the always returning from the dead Three Finger and his son Baby Splooge(the same baby born in Wrong Turn 2 and dubbed Baby Splooge by the filmmakers and not by the script).  So, we get to see more of the always allusive Three Finger then ever before, and I assure you that's not a good thing.  He's no longer creepy and more of a home made haunted house attraction.  His maniacal creepy laugh so effective in the first film now just seems mannered and tacked on to compensate for the fact that this villain has no real character or personality.  His son is in the film for minutes.  We get a nice moment between pops and son and before you know it the little tykes head is on a spike.  So much for a new character.The make up in this film is also quite horrible.  The first film, with the largest budget, had the benfit of having the late great Stan Winston as a producer and his special effects team to design the mutant make ups.  The sequel had the great Bill Terazakis so they looked good too.  This film is all rubber and no substance.  I'm not sure if its the bad lighting or cinematography or if the make up is really that amateurish.  The gore effects have no weight but they are right there and in your face.  They're not even shocking or gross, because they look so phony.  I know that can be a fun aspect of low budget horror, but in this film is just didn't work out that way.  The opening scene follows Wrong Turn 2 in setting up some non-important characters and then killing them off in brutal ways.  The fist film did it off screen, the second gave us a really macbre sight gag, and this film just gives us more victims.  This time is just isn't interesting and just comes off as typical exploitation horror historionics.  No excitement or repulsion, just waiting for the next scene to come.The Blu Ray has some special features as well, not as many as the previous films.  We get the obligatory deleted scenes.  I didn't get through all of them, and I recommend you not even bother.  We get three behind the scenes featurettes going over the special effects, the director and some of the fight scenes.  Director Declan O'brien states that he wanted his film to be more action oriented then the previous installments.  Which leads me to wonder why it's the least exciting and most boring of the three.  Most of these featurettes go over the usual EPK stuff regarding how wonderful the director and is and how wonderful it is to work with everyone, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!  Not worth watching even if you enjoyed this film somehow.Bottome line, if you're a fan of the first two Wrong Turn films you are going to watch this film, hopefully just as a rental.  Your love and devotion to the horror franchise will make you do it regardless of my warning.  But, if your just a plain horror fan and a moderate admirer of the first two films just skip this all together.  You'll thank me.",2,Three Finger and his son Baby Splooge help the Wrong Turn franchise officially die with this recent installment.,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,7320,"['first', 'Wrong', 'Turn',

If something is great, I don't feel the need to express it. But this...I don't even know if you can call it a ""bad movie"". For me, ""Batman & Robin"" or ""Transformers 2"" were bad movies. They were made with big budget, great actors, good directors and a true desire to make something they thought was commercial. In other words, ""Pop Corn"" movies. But they missed. This movie though, this ""Wrong Turn 3"", is something different. It has absolutely nothing going for it. Nothing. It is giving B-movies, what am I saying, Z-movies a bad name.Pick anything. The acting, the dialogue, the camera movements, the cinematography, the music, the script, the special effects, the pace, the rhythm, the make-up, the sound, the color, the intention... I mean, it has nothing going for it. It isn't even passable. When it's not misguided, it is simply worst than amateur-like.""Resurrection County"" or something like that, is another B-Movie done in an amateur way but at least, it has heart, which makes it ""passable'. But ""Wrong Turn 3"" is just some kind of a strange cinematic entity that doesn't even have a proper adjective to qualify it. Even watching it with the intention of laughing about it will disappoint you. You do that with Ed Wood movies like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".It looks like a school work done in an horror course and the teacher is using it to show the students what not to make.The idea was good. I'll give that. It made me think of the idea behind ""The Devil's Reject"" in which Rob Zombie uses tough bounty hunters to stop the crazy killers. This is something I'd like to do as a director or a writer: take a craze killer and give him a tough guy to battle with. Imagine Steven Seagal battling Jason Voorhees? Who would win? In ""Wrong Turn 3"", you have a bus full of killers that are let loose in the woods. That was interesting... but sadly wasted in the worst possible way.The real horror here... is realizing that this strange entity called a movie saw the light of day and that it was distributed by 20th Century Fox.

1267256,AYMVQD757T4ZS,B002G1WPG8,"Kody ""ParisHiltonFan""","[1, 1]","As a fan of the first two 'Wrong Turn' films, especially the first, 'Wrong Turn 3' is absolutely terrible and one of the worst sequels of the year. This film should have never have been a part of the series, as it feels nothing like a 'Wrong Turn' film. Well, apart from the presence of Three-Finger - but then again, he's barely in the film.The script is awful and the whole prisoners aspect just didn't work for this film. All of the prisoners were unlikeable and stereotypical, with very little development. The lead girl was not lead girl material, and was either screaming, crying or standing in the background doing nothing. The dialog, especially in the opening scene, is so god-awful I wanted to hit mute. The acting ranges from horrific to bearable, with no memorable performances. Most of the actors are Brits playing Americans, and most of them keep slipping in and out of their accents.There are no memorable horror sequences and absolutely no tension. Every character either steps into a trap, gets killed off-screen or is CGI'd with incredibly fake blood splatter. The film reeks of 'SyFy channel', which isn't surprising considering the director, Declan O'Brien, has an entire resume of SyFy productions and the same production services were used. Whether it's the cheesy 'TV movie' soundtrack playing constantly or the horrific CGI and green screen backdrops, it's really horrible to look at and makes 'WT2' look a blockbuster.Where did it all go wrong? Wrong Turn 2 is one of the most well-received horror films of 2007 and one of the best DTV horror entries available. It received tons of praise from horror critics and fans, and I loved it. You'd think the series could only get better, but instead they give us this piece of sh-t? I know the trailer looked lame as hell, but I still wasn't expecting a terrible film.The only worthy aspect of the film is the presence of Three-Finger and the fact the movie takes place on night, which was the main weak point of WT2.

1267266,A2P0L2XE35BYQW,B002G1WPG8,"Patt ""Shop4Bliss""","[1, 3]","First and foremost, I agree with many reviewers on here, Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead was an unnecessary sequel, but it is here to stay. However, my agreement with many of these same reviewers ends here. Of course, the Wrong Turn film franchise is yet another Hollywood cash crop (even if direct to dvd) much like dozens of other unnecessary horror movie franchises. The bottomline is the franchise will continue to grow because we allow it to. Neither Hollywood, nor Fox should be blamed, for its success, we should. With that being said, here's my review:Direction: C+, Script: C, Acting: C-, Editing: B-, Camera Work: B, Lighting: B, everything else is pretty moot at this point. Overall, Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead is a solid C in my opinion. This coming from a huge movie buff, especially horror films. I pretty much watch it all. Here is the breakdown for my grading scale:The director; an unknown to me did a fairly decent job with what he had to work with which was not much. Unknown actors and actresses and a mess of a script with terrible dialogue and a lot of unnecessary scenes. However, this surprisingly worked fairly well for the film because after all it is a B-horror movie. The make-up, costume and gore effects were pretty bad, yes even for a cheese ball horror film. Many of them looked very fake and Three Fingers' make-up was laughable at best. I definitely was not impressed with this, and can honestly say I have seen far better on television programs. Granted, I am sure this film did not have a huge budget by any means, and you can tell by watching it. Despite all of this, I actually enjoyed the flick even with its lackluster writing, decent direction and mostly bad acting. Why? Simply put, it is HORROR film! This sub-genre of horror is never all that great anyway, rarely do you ever truly come across a horror masterpiece. Of course, there are those few, but name one that involves terrified people running through the woods from backwards, inbred cannibalistic freaks that never really stay dead. These films are made for gore hounds who love senseless, stupid violence tangled with blood, guts and dismemberment with total disregard of a storyline.Like the previous films in the franchise, I did not expect much going into this film because I already knew what to expect and that was already mentioned above. However, I was very surprised with the first Wrong Turn being very good, probably because of its strong female lead. The second was far from great, but it served its purpose and was not half bad. However, this one failed where the other two succeeded. There was zero suspense, you easily knew what would happen scene after scene and I did not care about the characters. Not because most were convicts, but because they were not interesting and only numbers in a body count. Of course, their acting did not help much either, but let's face it, even horror films from yester-year like the original Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, were plagued with bad acting, even coming from today's stars; Kevin Bacon, Jamie Lee Curtis, and the most popular out of the group, Johnny Depp. Yet, we still love these films mostly because of the villain hence why all the remakes. I could never see a Wrong Turn remake in the future, it just is not that type of franchise, but I could definitely see a 4th, or even 5th installment as long as people keep watching them.Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead despite having many flaws and doomed by very sub-par to terrible acting with no originality in story, it is what it is, a gory horror romp to please gore hounds and true horror fans. Did not let the bad reviews fool you into steering clear from this film, just go into it knowing what to expect as I did and you should not be let down. As I said before, it is a HORROR film after all.",3,"Wrongly accused of being a terrible horror flick because it is just that, a horror flick.",1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,3829,"['First', 'foremost', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '3', 'Left', 'Dead', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', 'here', 'stay', 'However', 'agreement', 'many', 'same', 'reviewers', 'here', 'course', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'film', 'franchise', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'cash', 'crop', 'even', 'direct', 'dvd', 'much', 'dozens', 'other', 'unnecessary', 'horror', 'movie', 'franchises', 'bottomline', 'franchise', 'will', 'continue', 'grow', 'allow', 'Hollywood', 'Fox', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'success', 'should', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'review', 'Direction', 'C+', 'Script', 'C', 'Acting', 'C-', 'Editing', 'B-', 'Camera', 'Work', 'B', 'Lighting', 'B', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'moot', 'point', 'Overall', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '3', 'Left', 'Dead', 'solid', 'C', 'opinion', 'coming', 'huge', 'movie', 'buff', 'especially', 'horror', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'watch', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'grading', 'scale', 'director', 'unknown', 'did', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'Unknown', 'actors', 'actresses', 'mess', 'script', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'However', 'surprisingly', 'worked', 'fairly', 'well', 'film', 'B-horror', 'movie', 'make-up', 'costume', 'gore', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'yes', 'even', 'cheese', 'ball', 'horror', 'film', 'Many', 'looked', 'very', 'fake', 'Three', 'Fingers', 'make-up', 'was', 'laughable', 'best', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'better', 'television', 'programs', 'Granted', 'am', 'sure', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'budget', 'means', 'can', 'tell', 'watching', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'even', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'decent', 'direction', 'mostly', 'bad', 'acting', 'Why', 'Simply', 'put', 'HORROR', 'film', 'sub-genre', 'horror', 'never', 'great', 'anyway', 'rarely', 'do', 'ever', 'truly', 'come', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'course', 'are', 'few', 'one', 'terrified', 'people', 'running', 'woods', 'backwards', 'inbred', 'cannibalistic', 'freaks', 'never', 'really', 'stay', 'dead', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'gore', 'hounds', 'who', 'love', 'senseless', 'stupid', 'violence', 'tangled', 'blood', 'guts', 'dismemberment', 'total', 'disregard', 'storyline.Like', 'previous', 'films', 'franchise', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'already', 'mentioned', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'first', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'probably', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'second', 'was', 'far', 'great', 'served', 'purpose', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'However', 'one', 'failed', 'where', 'other', 'two', 'succeeded', 'was', 'zero', 'suspense', 'easily', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'scene', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'characters', 'Not', 'most', 'were', 'convicts', 'were', 'not', 'interesting', 'only', 'numbers', 'body', 'count', 'course', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'much', 'let', 'face', 'even', 'horror', 'films', 'yester-year', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'Halloween', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'were', 'plagued', 'bad', 'acting', 'even', 'coming', 'today', 'stars', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'most', 'popular', 'group', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'still', 'love', 'films', 'mostly', 'villain', 'hence', 'why', 'remakes', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'remake', 'future', 'just', 'not', 'type', 'franchise', 'could', 'definitely', 'see', '4th', 'even', '5th', 'installment', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'keep', 'watching', 'them.Wrong', 'Turn', '3', 'Left', 'Dead', 'having', 'many', 'flaws', 'doomed', 'very', 'sub-par', 'terrible', 'acting', 'originality', 'story', 'what', 'gory', 'horror', 'romp', 'please', 'gore', 'hounds', 'true', 'horror', 'fans', 'Did', 'not', 'let', 'bad', 'reviews', 'fool', 'steering', 'clear', 'film', 'just', 'go', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'did', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'said', 'HORROR', 'film']",N/A

This has probably the goriest deaths out of any wrong turn movie but most of them looked completely fake and some are quite farfetched! I did however like some of the creativity throughout the movie but it was quickly destroyed by the consequences the scenes caused! The CGI that was used in other places also looked again very unreal! I felt that the deaths were created by a kid who was bored and just plane lazy! The plot is original at best but I did notice that there were too many characters in this installment over the previous two which made the film sort of confusing in trying to figure out which criminal did what! It was just messy!Acting: It had decent acting that needed more put into it.... the first three victims were all terrible actors and I wish they created a better script for these actors to follow!Gore: Lots of bloody impalements, decapitations, a face sliced in half with a scythe, a gross severed cranium scene (with a gross brain part that follows), a body sliced vertically into three parts, some gruesome bow and arrow action, graphic barb wire deaths, severed limbs, stabbings, slashings, and a lot more! It was gorier than part two but definitely not as realistic!Bottom Line: ""Left for Dead"" took the series straight down and I hope Declan O' Brien has a way to bring it back up with the fourth installment!

The first two involved someone making a wrong turn then ending up seeing the cannibal hillbillies that they eventually run into if not killed off early like in the second film.  This movie to me feels like that they made it a 'Wrong Turn' film, but the deal is that nobody had made a wrong turn anywhere.  The film deals with inmates that have to go about getting transferred I believe, and end up running into only one hillbilly which I do not know is one from the previous films had shown or were killed off by movie's end.  Although the writing and acting in the movie weren't that good nor wasn't that bad somewhere inbetween those, but this movie I think people should go about renting at some point to watch it.

This time a bunch of escaped convicts and their police prisoner face off against the inbred cannibals. The first thing one notices is that the budget for this film is obviously much lower than that of the other two. Examples of this are demonstrated by a pathetic use of ""blue screen"" during any driving scene (reminiscent of films from the thirties and forties) and some very poor cgi gore effects. Some other interesting things to tale note of are: a bus that has the power to restore itself after being blown up, a shotgun that holds unlimited ammo and the convict who cocks it all the time. I gave the film three stars because it truly is a time waster. It moves along at a fairly quick pace, there are a lot of bloody deaths (even though many of them are horribly fake looking) and the acting is okay. Also there is humor to be had from some truly pretentious dialouge such as the cops' lamentation on money. The DVD supplements include two deleted scenes and a short piece of behind the scenes stuff, none of which is very important or informative.

If you're looking for a 1.5 hour escapist ride into the nightmarish woods we've come to be familiar with, well, I guess you're not going to be disappointed.The movie has a decent plot and it attempts to be mildly original, by making the ""victims"" not victims at all. So, you don't know really who to root for. The film is also heavy on the corn syrup, and the special effects are fine.For me, WT3 is just as decent as WT1 and WT2, it's in the same level.My only big problem with the movie was the ending. The last minute of the movie was utterly stupid and useless, actually making the whole inferior. What were they thinking? I know they ""have to"" set up a scenario for a possible sequel, but the way they chose to do it contradicts the relationships and the characters themselves in the movie. Not to mention it is a lot to ask of us to believe they would all be there at the very same time. Come on!!All in all.... if you liked the previous two, you'll probably like this one as well.

The adventure which involves a group of escaped convicts trying to make find their way out of the woods, actually has some potential, but sadly isn't executed very well, weighed down by a dumb screenplay that features unrealistic situations, idiotic dialog, and some moronic brain damaged characters.Things get off to a decent start, with the massacre of a group of campers which features some eye popping archery.  This is followed up by the inbred Three Fingers (Borislav Petrov) attacking a bus transporting a group of prisoners, causing it to crash deep in the woods.  This upsets the escape plans of Carlo Chavez (Tamer Hassan), a big shot con who takes control of the group of survivors.  Relying on half asleep Nate Wilson (Tom Frederic), a correctional officer who grew up in the area, to show him the way out, is his first of many mistakes.  Moving through the forest the group encounters Alex (Janet Montgomery), a camper on the run from the cannibals, and also an armored car loaded with a fortune in cash.  Wearing leg irons, and carrying bags of cash, the prisoners attempt to find a way out.The gore and special effects scenes are the best thing about Wrong Turn 3.  Those acquainted with either of the first two adventures, are aware of the ruthlessness of the inbreds, and suspense isn't major factor.  However the film still manages to include a few new violent twists and creative traps, to at least stimulate the imagination.  A trap involving a tow truck and razor wire, is probably the most diabolical and enjoyable of the lot.Filmed in Bulgaria, director Declan O'Brien (Sharktopus) achieved his goal of putting more of an emphasis on action, but Connor James Delaney's screenplay is just a mess of poorly conceived ideas and characters.  Alex is totally unbelievable, springing out of the woods to attack the group, and then constantly shooting off her mouth amongst a group of desperate convicts.  Nate Wilson is a complete doofus, who almost makes Gomer Pyle look like a genius.  The goofball gets in one lucky swing, but his luck eventually runs out.  Chavez, who alternates between being coldly ruthless and a raving maniac, takes on Three Fingers, who opens up his mind to new experiences.Wrong Turn 3 has some fun bloody moments, but is simply dragged down by terrible writing, and inept idiotic characters.  The inbreds haven't been eliminated from the woods, so another Wrong Turn is certainly possible.

As they are camping, her friends are killed by Three-Finger as Alex watches.Two days later, prison guard Nate (Tom Frederic) was assigned with Walter (Chucky Venn) and Preslow (Mike Straub) to transfer a group of prisoners: Willy (Christian Contreras), crank caller Crawford (Jake Curran), thug Floyd (Gil Kolirin), convicted killer Brandon (Tom McKay) and drug cartel Chavez (Tamer Hassan) to a distant prison. While driving, their bus is attacked by Three-Finger and crashes to the woods, forcing them to continue on foot. Preslow is killed and to complicate matters, Nate and Walter are overpowered by the prisoners, with Chavez taking charge and in control of the guns. While being chased through the woods, the prisoners use Nate as a guide to lead them to a watch tower that Nate recalls being in the area, to send out an SOS using the communications equipment they believe is in there. The group finds Alex and walks to an abandoned armored truck filled with cash. The money quickly becomes the prisoners' sole motivation for escape and survival. Chavez commands Walter to pick up some of the bags of money, but Walter refuses because of his injury. In a last ditch effort to regain control of the situation, Officer Walter pulls out a gun and tries to shoot Chavez. Unfortunately, the gun was not loaded and Chavez kills him. He forces Nate and Alex to carry the money and walk on foot.Along the trail, they stumble upon a trap. The prisoners escape the booby trap set by Three-Toes, Three Finger's son. They then catch the son and behead him, leaving a trophy on the spent booby trap for Three Fingers to find as a deterrent. They soon realize it only enrages Three Fingers. Three Fingers hunts and murders Willy and Crawford. After Sheriff Carver is killed, Nate and Alex manage to escape. They are able to find the location where the watch tower once stood, only to discover it was burned down years ago. Chavez decides to get rid of Nate, but instead promises him another way to get out. They find Three Finger's truck and Chavez uses Alex as bait. Floyd betrays Chavez and steals the money as Chavez chases him down only to see Three Fingers lobbing a molotov cocktail at Floyd, killing him and burning all the money. Chavez then decides to give Alex to Three-Finger to improve his chances of survival. Three-Finger drags Alex into his truck and drives off. He secures Alex at his house and goes back out to hunt the rest of the survivors. Chavez finds Three-Finger and fights him, but Three-Finger kills him.Meanwhile, Alex has been tied up in Three Fingers' house, awakes and see Deputy Lane tied with barbed wire, who dies shortly after. Nate finds Three-Finger's house and frees Alex, but Three-Finger attacks him. Alex save him by stabbing Three-Finger with a large stake. Nate and Alex take his tow truck and drive away, but Three-Finger follows them and leaps on top of the truck causing them to crash the truck into a tree. As the truck is set on fire, Brandon appears and pulls Alex out of the truck. When Brandon is helping Nate, Three-Finger attacks them but Nate manage to stab him in the head with a meathook. After Nate releases Brandon free, the U.S. Marshall team arrives and rescues Nate and Alex.Sometime later, Nate returns to collect the remaining cash from the armored truck.
