Actually it's riveting, the way Altman and Hartley can be riveting, but just because Anania knows his stuff won't mean that anyone will care.  He does know his stuff though; this is the most accurate of the many recent films to tackle schizophrenia, and it's also the most accurate about &#34;theater people.&#34;  But we're still in the very outer margins of fringe culture here, and not even Altman or Hartley at their most subtle ever seemed to flirt so heavily with complete irrelevance.  Like recreating the Sistine Chapel in frosting on a carrot cake.  So, I'm still rooting for Anania, as I have been since Her Name Is Carla if not before, but more like the way I root for certain esoteric indie bands, in full acceptance of the fact that they're never going to record Stairway to Heaven, not even by indie standards.",4,"Jay Anania, the next Hal Hartley?",1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,982,"['Here', 'atmospheric', 'nuanced', 'mature', 'psychodrama', 'perceptive', 'skillful', 'Anania', ""'d"", 'only', 'be', 'human', 'be', 'stifling', 'yawn', 'now', 'Actually', 'riveting', 'way', 'Altman', 'Hartley', 'can', 'be', 'riveting', 'just', 'Anania', 'stuff', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anyone', 'will', 'care', 'know', 'stuff', 'most', 'accurate', 'many', 'recent', 'films', 'tackle', 'schizophrenia', 'also', 'most', 'accurate', '34', 'theater', 'people.', '34', ""'re"", 'still', 'very', 'outer', 'margins', 'fringe', 'culture', 'here', 'not', 'even', 'Altman', 'Hartley', 'most', 'subtle', 'ever', 'seemed', 'flirt', 'so', 'heavily', 'complete', 'irrelevance', 'recreating', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'frosting', 'carrot', 'cake', 'So', ""'m"", 'still', 'rooting', 'Anania', 'have', 'been', 'Name', 'Carla', 'not', 'more', 'way', 'root', 'certain', 'esoteric', 'indie', 'bands', 'full', 'acceptance', 'fact', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'record', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'not', 'even', 'indie', 'standards']",N/A

Too bad I opened the package, thereby sabotaging my opportunity to return it...Still, there are intriguing ideas contained within this mess of a movie... if only writer/director Jay Anania had figured out how to clearly convey what he wanted to say, and had made more of an effort at plotting (and given it the serious shot of adrenaline it needed)... there is a fascinating picture struggling to be released from this footage!  Although I can't recommend this work, I have to admit that I couldn't stop watching.  I was waiting for something to happen that made sense, and I think I got at least a portion of the idea, but it was too little, too late.

It was only 93 minutes in length, but the entire experience felt so much longer.  The plot itself is promising:  a theatre director working with a very small ensemble cast may either be descending into insanity or may legitimately be victim to a nefarious plot to poison her.The problems are myriad.  Repeated phrases (""Why is that strange?""), excruciatingly drawn-out closeups of Winona's tortured visage as it is wracked by confusion and despair, the smirking, snide reactions of James Franco; the negligable contributions of the ensemble cast.  It all adds up to nothing.Jay Anania (director) was clearly aiming for a very intellectual, minimalist, and theatre-driven piece of drama with ""The Letter"".  Even that belabored vehicle -- the Japanese tradition of composing missives to dead loved ones and then sailing them downriver -- was so occluded by the saturnine voice-over of Winona that I still don't see the point of giving the film this title.Please, Ms. Ryder:  choose your next work mroe carefully, because this one was a celluloid disaster.",1,Pointless,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,1167,"['will', 'state', 'up', 'front', 'only', 'watched', 'mess', 'end', 'longstanding', 'loyalty', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'was', 'only', '93', 'minutes', 'length', 'entire', 'experience', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'plot', 'promising', 'theatre', 'director', 'working', 'very', 'small', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'may', 'either', 'be', 'descending', 'insanity', 'may', 'legitimately', 'be', 'victim', 'nefarious', 'plot', 'poison', 'her.The', 'problems', 'are', 'myriad', 'Repeated', 'phrases', 'Why', 'strange', 'excruciatingly', 'drawn-out', 'closeups', 'Winona', 'tortured', 'visage', 'wracked', 'confusion', 'despair', 'smirking', 'snide', 'reactions', 'James', 'Franco', 'negligable', 'contributions', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'up', 'nothing.Jay', 'Anania', 'director', 'was', 'clearly', 'aiming', 'very', 'intellectual', 'minimalist', 'theatre-driven', 'piece', 'drama', 'Letter', 'Even', 'belabored', 'vehicle', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'composing', 'missives', 'dead', 'loved', 'ones', 'then', 'sailing', 'downriver', 'was', 'so', 'occluded', 'saturnine', 'voice-over', 'Winona', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'giving', 'film', 'title.Please', 'Ms.', 'Ryder', 'choose', 'next', 'work', 'mroe', 'carefully', 'one', 'was', 'celluloid', 'disaster']",N/A

It makes the hour and a half run time seem like a month.  I was actually worried that the machine I rented it from would not take it back.  Narrated in a droning monotone voice by a playwrite/director the movie is about her attempts to direct and also re-write a boring and amateurish play which is in rehearsals.  The dialogue between the actors is slow and seemingly meaningless in this clunker and I wonder why as fine an actor as James Russo would take a role in it.

No real story, just a collection of confused and confusing, disjointed scenes.What was writer/director Jay Anania not thinking?Winona Ryder portrays a playwright who is apparently going insane. How much is in her mind? What's real and what's not? Has she been drugged? Or not? Many possibilities are suggested, but we never really learn any answers. I suppose that's meant to be profound?THE LETTER has many closeups, and even extreme closeups. Yes, Winona Ryder looks lovely in her closeups. If you want a collection of Ryder images for your screensaver, then this is the DVD for you. But if you want a film that's entertaining, or even coherent, you must look elsewhere.As in many of her past films, Ryder: 1. Does voiceovers, 2. Plays a writer, 3. Plays a Crazy Girl.Alas, ever since her excellentGirl, Interrupted, Ryder's too often been typecast as The Crazy Girl. She sometimes plays other types (e.g., the also excellentWhen Love Is Not Enough), but isn't often enough given the chance.And what an awful title -- THE LETTER. So generic. The IMDB lists 28 films titled THE LETTER just since 2006.THE LETTER actually reminded me of the much betterNightmares (Totally Uncut & Uncensored), a 1980 slasher film, because NIGHTMARES is set amid a really bad, pretentious play, much like that in THE LETTER. Except that NIGHTMARES parodies the sort of pretentiousness found in THE LETTER.NIGHTMARES is a gory horror film -- but what's really scary is that (according to the IMDB) THE LETTER's writer/director ""Jay Anania heads the directing program at the graduate film school at New York University and is one of James Franco's teachers.""Franco co-stars in THE LETTER. I guess Anania used his NYU film school contacts to get this film made, but based on this sample of his filmmaking skills, NYU should fire him and refund his students' tuition fees.",1,"Yes, it really is THAT bad!",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1863,"['What', 'mess', 'real', 'story', 'just', 'collection', 'confused', 'confusing', 'disjointed', 'scenes.What', 'was', 'writer/director', 'Jay', 'Anania', 'not', 'thinking', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'playwright', 'who', 'apparently', 'going', 'insane', 'How', 'much', 'mind', 'What', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'been', 'drugged', 'not', 'Many', 'possibilities', 'are', 'suggested', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'answers', 'suppose', 'meant', 'be', 'profound', 'LETTER', 'many', 'closeups', 'even', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'Yes', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'lovely', 'closeups', 'want', 'collection', 'Ryder', 'images', 'screensaver', 'then', 'DVD', 'want', 'film', 'entertaining', 'even', 'coherent', 'must', 'look', 'elsewhere.As', 'many', 'past', 'films', 'Ryder', '1', 'Does', 'voiceovers', '2', 'Plays', 'writer', '3', 'Plays', 'Crazy', 'Girl.Alas', 'ever', 'excellentGirl', 'Interrupted', 'Ryder', 'too', 'often', 'been', 'typecast', 'Crazy', 'Girl', 'sometimes', 'other', 'types', 'e.g.', 'also', 'excellentWhen', 'Love', 'Not', 'Enough', ""n't"", 'often', 'enough', 'given', 'chance.And', 'what', 'awful', 'title', 'LETTER', 'So', 'generic', 'IMDB', '28', 'films', 'titled', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'just', '2006.THE', 'LETTER', 'actually', 'reminded', 'much', 'betterNightmares', 'Totally', 'Uncut', 'Uncensored', '1980', 'slasher', 'film', 'NIGHTMARES', 'set', 'really', 'bad', 'pretentious', 'play', 'much', 'LETTER', 'NIGHTMARES', 'sort', 'pretentiousness', 'found', 'THE', 'LETTER.NIGHTMARES', 'gory', 'horror', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'scary', 'according', 'IMDB', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'writer/director', 'Jay', 'Anania', 'directing', 'program', 'graduate', 'film', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'University', 'one', 'James', 'Franco', 'teachers', 'Franco', 'co-stars', 'LETTER', 'guess', 'Anania', 'used', 'NYU', 'film', 'school', 'contacts', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'based', 'sample', 'filmmaking', 'skills', 'NYU', 'should', 'fire', 'refund', 'students', 'tuition', 'fees']",N/A

Martine (Ryder) is a New York playwright who is getting a chance to direct her boyfriend in a new play she wrote. Soon after rehearsals begin an unknown actor, Tyrone (Franco) shows up and begins to cause tension. His acting is good but he is hostile to everyone except Martine. While the rehearsals are going on Martine begins to become paranoid and thinks someone is trying to kill her. Her re-writes of the play begin to confuse the actors and the line between life and paranoia are blurred. First of all I will say this is not terrible but this is another movie that tries to be artsy for the sake of being artsy. I find the easiest way to describe movies sometimes are to compare them to others that many have seen. I open with that because it seemed like this movie tried it's hardest to be like ""Black Swan"" but never quite making it. Very limited scenery and actors but the main focus is on Martine's slow descent into madness. You begin to question if she is just overly paranoid or if her concerns are legit. This is the type of movie that keeps you wondering about that which helps you make it through. Overall, an OK movie but tried to be artsy for the sake of being artsy.
