Well no movie gets better than that, and that's what the Gremlins is.  A cute little creature sprouted a bunch of little punk gremlins running around everywhere causing chaos at every corner.  There was a lot of comedy in this one, the gremlins were hilarious, absolutely hilarious.  I must say that this is a must see dvd.  Plus you get the second one with it, which is even a sweeter deal.  The first one itself is worth the 20 bucks.
