922082,A1ZDEH3V0H290C,B000A59Q6E,"Betty ""diverduck""","[1, 1]","*Spoiler Alert*I rented this film years ago and watched it with my daughter. She thought it was somewhat amusing and very weird. I thought it was wickedly funny with Lynch art direction and had a Polanski, creepy paranoid, vibe to it. I wanted a copy for myself, but none was to be had. I just found it recently here and snagged it. What is there to say about Sal and Frances and their filthy apartment...especially their bathroom after Vic the Plumber goes to work on it, and later in the film causes a serious dilemma for Sal and Frances when he ""stinks it up."" That bathroom should have gone in the NY MOMA, along with all of those bright yellow cans of SMEAT.  The first scene we see Frances involved in self-abuse, than the lens at floor level to gaze on his step-mother Sal passed out, laying on her back on the bathroom floor, with a nearly empty bottle of mouthwash in her hand and lit cigarette poking out of her lips.Frances is very shy and has a stutter, where as Sal has a prosthetic leg, and foot, and has the ability to charm anyone that enters their apartment. One night while taking the trash out, Frances trips on something, and discovers a small hole in the privacy fence and takes a peek. He sees a beautiful young woman that turns out to be named Gloria, and who is a vegetarian with epilepsy and a relationship of intimacy forms between them. Frances starts to make this habit of spying on her, and begins to see her eating meat in more grotesque manners; even thinking he sees her murdering and butchering people through an opaque bathroom window, and eating, and serving various body parts to guests.  Gloria patiently puts up with his paranoid confrontations. Even a confrontation when he barges in on a party she has having, because he saw a human head being put into a stock pot, and grabs a large clever, threatening her guests. Frances works at a photo lab and the film uses this as a great plot device with music and lighting to contrast with darker set colors and night scenes. The photo lab scenes are scored with abrasive songs like ""Kiddie Grinder--Marilyn Manson remix by Dave Oglive"" and ""Cold Skin by Mind Rot."" The song ""Elevate in Madness by Candira"" is especially unnerving. The film blurs the line of Frances's developing psychosis, and hallucinations, with his reality so well, at times it makes the viewer questions what is his reality, until the film itself seems to be having a nervous breakdown, with visions and revelations of secrets. This is the first film I've ever seen where a Ukulele and prosthetic foot are used as weapons in the same scene. It has the artistic vision and rage of David Lynch, the paranoia and absurdity of Roman Polanski and the grotesque humor of Lina Wertmuller. There is even a bit Hitchcock's Rear Window and Shakespeare's Macbeth in it. It's difficult to compare to any another film I've seen. This one stands out on its own.I didn't realize until after the film and watching the extras of photo stills, that Frances was wearing that T-Shirt with a cow printed on it with the caption ""MEAT IS MURDER"" (gift from Gloria) when he was packing a hand gun to confront his lover and neighbor Gloria, towards the end of the film when Frances's state of mind was so broken, his paranoia was at a fever pitch, his anger and frustration over the past and present overlapping one another pushing him into literally tearing down his own home and almost taking his own life...because god hated him so much.One has to see it for them self to discover if they like it. If you are a devote catholic, you might hate this film...I don't know, maybe you could relate to it. There is some blasphemy in it. To me the ending seemed like an opening to instantly raise Frances's paranoia thru the roof and god only knew what he was capable of at that moment. If there had been a next scene, his vegetarian neighbor would likely have been a dead duck.Extras: Short, sweet and simple Q & A from the director. Soundless video of the beginning construction on Sal and Frances's apartment set.

922084,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000A59Q6E,J from NY,"[0, 0]","Mark Hanlon's debut film ""Buddy Boy"", starring Aidan GillenThe Wire: The Complete Fifth SeasonBlackoutis a sick little diamond which stands out very distinctly from the thousands of movies produced by independent filmmakers who have watched ""Mulholland Drive"" one too many times.The protagonist--if you really want to be nice and call him that--is Francis, a mentally ill young man with obvious dental problems and even more obvious mental issues.  Gillen plays Francis perfectly: a sensitive, nice guy who struggles with a medieval form of the Roman Catholic faith (somehow I'm not surprised that the faith is given a smarmy, ironic treatment in this kind of movie) and tries to make sense of his tragic life.  He lives with a crippled, vicious stepmother played brilliantly by Susan Tyrrell and endures her fat, obnoxious, disgusting friends and their insults towards him.  The film's unrelentingly bleak and doomy atmosphere reminds one very much ofRequiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)and if you've seen that movie, expect something similar with a hallucinatory psychological twist.Francis spends most of his time working at a comic book store, where he is virtually ignored, and peeping out his windows at neighbors.  One of these is the beautiful actress Emmanuelle Segnier (Roman Polanski's wife) as Francis' vegan/intellectual lite neighbor Gloria who as a result of one kind act on Francis part, pursues him and wants more than anything else to get to know him.  Francis is suspicious of her motives and has trouble believing anyone would want to get to know him, particularly a gorgeous woman like this--so did I--and this probably has something to do with what he sees in his binoculars when he peeps at her.  A relationship develops, but mistrust on Francis' part grows and grows as a result of...well, Francis has problems.On the whole, this is a slam dunk in terms of surrealism, character development, mood and practically everything else.  On the other hand, one can't help but wonder why Hanlon has us grasping at Francis' background so desperately.  We know that his father was also borderline insane and may have harmed his real mother, but why and when?  Also, who exactly IS Gloria?  Are we actually expected to believe that this lady hangs around after Francis pulls a cleaver out at one of her dinner parties?  Berates her about being a vegetarian (hilarious scenes, some of these.)  Then is patient with him as he draws a pistol on her? InThe Ninth GateSegnier was used in much the same way, only with a much different character.  She was Satan. In this film, is she God?  That would make the most sense to me, considering the ending.  Also, it borrows a little too much fromThe Tenantwhich is not a bad thing the first few times, but gets a little derivative in parts.  On the whole, though, this is a great movie from a promising new director.",4,"""Something is lost that can't be found/St. Anthony please look around!""",1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2868,"['Mark', 'Hanlon', 'debut', 'film', 'Buddy', 'Boy', 'starring', 'Aidan', 'GillenThe', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'SeasonBlackoutis', 'sick', 'little', 'diamond', 'out', 'very', 'distinctly', 'thousands', 'movies', 'produced', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times.The', 'protagonist', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'nice', 'call', 'Francis', 'mentally', 'ill', 'young', 'man', 'obvious', 'dental', 'problems', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'mental', 'issues', 'Gillen', 'Francis', 'perfectly', 'sensitive', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'medieval', 'form', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'somehow', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'faith', 'given', 'smarmy', 'ironic', 'treatment', 'kind', 'movie', 'make', 'sense', 'tragic', 'life', 'crippled', 'vicious', 'stepmother', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Susan', 'Tyrrell', 'fat', 'obnoxious', 'disgusting', 'friends', 'insults', 'film', 'unrelentingly', 'bleak', 'doomy', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'ofRequiem', 'Dream', 'Director', 'Cut', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'expect', 'something', 'similar', 'hallucinatory', 'psychological', 'twist.Francis', 'most', 'time', 'working', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'where', 'virtually', 'ignored', 'peeping', 'out', 'windows', 'neighbors', 'One', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Emmanuelle', 'Segnier', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'wife', 'Francis', 'vegan/intellectual', 'lite', 'neighbor', 'Gloria', 'who', 'result', 'one', 'kind', 'act', 'Francis', 'part', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'get', 'know', 'Francis', 'suspicious', 'motives', 'trouble', 'believing', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'particularly', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'so', 'did', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'what', 'binoculars', 'when', 'relationship', 'mistrust', 'Francis', 'part', 'grows', 'grows', 'result', 'well', 'Francis', 'problems.On', 'whole', 'slam', 'dunk', 'terms', 'surrealism', 'character', 'development', 'mood', 'practically', 'everything', 'else', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hanlon', 'grasping', 'Francis', 'background', 'so', 'desperately', 'know', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'borderline', 'insane', 'may', 'have', 'harmed', 'real', 'mother', 'why', 'when', 'Also', 'who', 'exactly', 'Gloria', 'Are', 'actually', 'expected', 'believe', 'lady', 'hangs', 'Francis', 'cleaver', 'out', 'one', 'dinner', 'parties', 'being', 'vegetarian', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Then', 'patient', 'pistol', 'InThe', 'Ninth', 'GateSegnier', 'was', 'used', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'only', 'much', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'Satan', 'film', 'God', 'would', 'make', 'most', 'sense', 'considering', 'ending', 'Also', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fromThe', 'Tenantwhich', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'little', 'derivative', 'parts', 'whole', 'though', 'great', 'movie', 'promising', 'new', 'director']",Buddy Boy
