To me, it felt mostly like a criticism of the way of life of the Edwardian society. Totally different from the ""Treasure Houses of Britain"" which takes you on tours of these wonderful historical houses and takes the time to show you the treasures in each one of them.

1527818,A32KCBYRCHN9DF,B0077PBPYQ,Cookie,"[9, 10]","I was very disappointed with the obvious bias of this documentary.  Yes, the wealthy were very wealthy and there was a big gulf between the classes.  But, the film made it look like everyone who worked ""in service"" was angry and bitter about their lot in life.  It kept playing doomsday music and showing over and over one photo where the servants looked just short of insane.  In fact, the people who worked in service had plenty to eat, clothes to wear, and a good roof over their heads, which many poor people at that time yearned for, as evidenced by how many parents sent their children off to work at the manor houses.  What I had hoped to see was information on how the house was managed, how they kept those huge estates in such good condition without electricity and modern tools, and how their supply chain functioned.
