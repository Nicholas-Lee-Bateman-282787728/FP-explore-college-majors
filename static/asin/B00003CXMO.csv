529156,A1TSYN528AXVMA,B00003CXMO,A Customer,"[4, 6]","I looooooved this movie. There are not enough words that can describe my love for this movie. I guess that this is the type of film I've wanted to see my whole life and when I saw it I just fell in love with it. Kirsten Dunst plays Torrence the newest captain of the cheerleading squad who finds out that the old captain was stealing cheers from an inner city school that could never afford to go to the nationals. But that squad also has a new captain that plans on making it to nationals and is driven to win her squad the championship. I honestly enjoyed how this movie glorified cheerleading and showed how it can be just as much of a sport as football and basketball. There's a great romance between Torrance and Cliff. The cheers are humorous and the routines are breath taking. And the movie itself is truly and genuinely funny. I think the movie has something everyone will enjoy. Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Jesse Bradford, Nathan West and Claire Kramer round out this terrific cast and all have an amazing chemistry. This movie will have you guessing until the very end which squad will win the championship...All I can say about this movie is that it is very fun! Its like a cool wind of originality. I have to say I have never seen anything quite like it. If you took Clueless, The MIghty Ducks and Dirty Dancing and mixed them together you would almost have this movie, but not quite. Kirsten Dunst was made for this role and she plays it with believability, style and a bubbliness that no other actress can do and still gain respect. The dvd for this film is great. It has alot of extra goodies like alot of behind-the-scenes footage, a music video, audio commentary and other features that are fun to watch. This movie is a true gem and everyone should run out and buy it. Oh and by the way, I forgot to mention how hot theses cheerleaders are! They sizzle and truly Bring It On!!!",5,"&quot;Its funny, and smart and has alot of heart&quot;",984355200,"03 12, 2001",2001,1899,"['looooooved', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'words', 'can', 'describe', 'love', 'movie', 'guess', 'type', 'film', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'whole', 'life', 'when', 'saw', 'just', 'fell', 'love', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Torrence', 'newest', 'captain', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'who', 'out', 'old', 'captain', 'was', 'stealing', 'cheers', 'inner', 'city', 'school', 'could', 'never', 'afford', 'go', 'nationals', 'squad', 'also', 'new', 'captain', 'making', 'nationals', 'driven', 'win', 'squad', 'championship', 'honestly', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'glorified', 'cheerleading', 'showed', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'sport', 'football', 'basketball', 'great', 'romance', 'Torrance', 'Cliff', 'cheers', 'are', 'humorous', 'routines', 'are', 'breath', 'taking', 'movie', 'truly', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'think', 'movie', 'something', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Nathan', 'West', 'Claire', 'Kramer', 'round', 'out', 'terrific', 'cast', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'squad', 'will', 'win', 'championship', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'very', 'fun', 'cool', 'wind', 'originality', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'took', 'Clueless', 'MIghty', 'Ducks', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'mixed', 'together', 'would', 'almost', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'believability', 'style', 'bubbliness', 'other', 'actress', 'can', 'do', 'still', 'gain', 'respect', 'dvd', 'film', 'great', 'alot', 'extra', 'goodies', 'alot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'music', 'video', 'audio', 'commentary', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'true', 'gem', 'everyone', 'should', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'Oh', 'way', 'forgot', 'mention', 'how', 'hot', 'theses', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'sizzle', 'truly', 'Bring']",Bring It on VHS

529161,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXMO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I've seen `Bring it On' maybe six times in the past six months.  I seem to catch it every time it's on television and I can't help myself but watch it through.  It's one of those teen comedies that just works on every level.  It's fresh, funny, smart and entertaining from the start to the finish, even when it's at its corniest.  The routines are impressive, the acting is superb (when compared with the average acting chops of teen stars) and the script is downright hilarious.  Sure there are plenty of teen sports comedies out there but `Bring it On' is truly ahead of the pack when it comes to delivering top notch entertainment every step of the way.The film opens with Torrance Shipmen being handed position of head cheerleader.  It's what she's always dreamed of but it's much more difficult than she imagined.  On her first day she instructs her squad in a pyramid that ends up costing them a player (when she is injured) and thus they have to hold auditions to fill her spot.  That's when they meet Missy Pantone, a new student who despises the whole cheerleader mentality but tries out for the team because the school has no gymnastics team.  Missy just so happens to be ""the poo"" and so Torrance gives her the spot with no reservations.  With Missy though comes a sudden and devastating reality.  She informs Torrance that their routines, the routines the former head cheerleader hand selected and taught to the squad, are in fact stolen routines from a rival school, a school that up until this year has never been able to compete in the national cheerleading competitions.  Torrance is now faced with not only the moral issue of using the stolen routines but also the task of creating a whole new fresh routine.The film is filled with funny dialog and hilarious characters.  Kirsten Dunst proves herself here.  She is truly one gifted actress who can deliver in comedy as well as drama.  I'm stunned at her lack of an Oscar nomination, for with powerful performances in films like `The Virgin Suicides' as well as `Marie Antoinette' you would almost assume she has multiple nominations to her name.  She is far from your typical `Jessica Alba', she actually has talent.The rest of the cast is impressive as well.  Most impressive would have to be Gabrielle Union who plays rival head cheerleader Isis.  I just adore Gabrielle and only wish she would select some more meaty roles for herself.  She constantly delivers in somewhat thankless films.  It would be nice to see her really excel in something worthy of her talent.  Newcomer Eliza Dushku also does great here as Missy.  Sadly, much like Gabrielle, Eliza has yet to really follow this up with anything worth mentioning, which is sad since she steals scene after scene here.  Jesse Bradford shows some potential, and he has a few decent films in his resume as of now, but in the end this is a `chick flick' and thus the `chicks' involved definitely outshine Bradford.So, if you're a fan of the genre or a fan of comedies in general and want to see a smart one with sharp and witty dialog then `Bring it On' may just be your cup of tea.  I just adore it and highly recommend it with no reservations.",4,This movie is the poo; take a big whiff...,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,3168,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bring', 'maybe', 'six', 'times', 'past', 'six', 'months', 'seem', 'catch', 'time', 'television', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'watch', 'one', 'teen', 'comedies', 'just', 'level', 'fresh', 'funny', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'when', 'corniest', 'routines', 'are', 'impressive', 'acting', 'superb', 'when', 'compared', 'average', 'acting', 'chops', 'teen', 'stars', 'script', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'Sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'teen', 'sports', 'comedies', 'there', 'Bring', 'truly', 'ahead', 'pack', 'when', 'delivering', 'top', 'notch', 'entertainment', 'step', 'way.The', 'film', 'Torrance', 'Shipmen', 'being', 'handed', 'position', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'what', 'always', 'dreamed', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'imagined', 'first', 'day', 'squad', 'pyramid', 'up', 'costing', 'player', 'when', 'injured', 'thus', 'have', 'hold', 'auditions', 'fill', 'spot', 'when', 'meet', 'Missy', 'Pantone', 'new', 'student', 'who', 'whole', 'cheerleader', 'mentality', 'out', 'team', 'school', 'gymnastics', 'team', 'Missy', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'poo', 'so', 'Torrance', 'spot', 'reservations', 'Missy', 'sudden', 'devastating', 'reality', 'Torrance', 'routines', 'routines', 'former', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'hand', 'selected', 'taught', 'squad', 'are', 'fact', 'stolen', 'routines', 'rival', 'school', 'school', 'up', 'year', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'compete', 'national', 'cheerleading', 'competitions', 'Torrance', 'now', 'faced', 'not', 'only', 'moral', 'issue', 'using', 'stolen', 'routines', 'also', 'task', 'creating', 'whole', 'new', 'fresh', 'routine.The', 'film', 'filled', 'funny', 'dialog', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'here', 'truly', 'one', 'gifted', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'deliver', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'drama', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'lack', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'powerful', 'performances', 'films', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'as', 'well', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'would', 'almost', 'assume', 'multiple', 'nominations', 'name', 'far', 'typical', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'actually', 'talent.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'impressive', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'impressive', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'who', 'rival', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'Isis', 'just', 'adore', 'Gabrielle', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'select', 'more', 'meaty', 'roles', 'herself', 'constantly', 'somewhat', 'thankless', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'really', 'excel', 'something', 'worthy', 'talent', 'Newcomer', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'also', 'great', 'here', 'Missy', 'Sadly', 'much', 'Gabrielle', 'Eliza', 'yet', 'really', 'follow', 'up', 'anything', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'sad', 'scene', 'scene', 'here', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'potential', 'few', 'decent', 'films', 'resume', 'now', 'end', 'chick', 'flick', 'thus', 'chicks', 'involved', 'definitely', 'outshine', 'Bradford.So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre', 'fan', 'comedies', 'general', 'want', 'see', 'smart', 'one', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialog', 'then', 'Bring', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'just', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reservations']",Bring It on VHS

The &#34;poor&#34; school scores financing by getting their story out to the media. The cheerleaders deliver their competing routines. That's about it.

One thing this movie is right about though is what cheerleading has been allowed to become in this country. Cheerleading is supposed to be about cheering.

It is better written than most other modern teen movies. Better performed as well too. If you are into cheerleader competition mode, this is a movie for you. If you like great movies with a sophisticated plot, go elsewhere. It's not here. If you just enjoy simple, innocent, mindless fun, this movie delivers. And, oh yeah, it has some pretty cute girls in it too. This movie shows how far cheerleaders will go to win the title, and I don't think some of it is exaggeration. I think it could be true. Our hero team then learns that their old leader was stealing cheers from another squad from another school. Kirsten Dunst, as Torrance, is cute and bubbly. She does that very well. She can get on your nerves a little. She is a good actress who is capable of being a credible performer, as well as just being cute. Eliza Dushku, as missy, was the standout of the bunch. She possesses a radiance that can't be put into words. She absorbs the screen and you have to watch every single frame she's in. Co-Star Gabrielle Union(""She's All That"", ""10 Things About You"", and ""7th Heaven"")is a real find too. A pleasing actress and a real beauty. The end competition is decently executed and delivers a final verdict that isn't what most people would of predicted would happen. This is what I think. I know some people were disgusted with it, and I can see why they would be. Especially some stiff parents. There are some sexual innuendo type remarks and actions here that might offend them.

Sure there are alot of cliches in it and alot but never does it get bogged  down in them. The story revolves a high school senior Torrance played by  Kirsten Dunst who becomes captain of the cheerleading squad. During the  regionals the squad finds out that there previous captain known as Big Red  stole their moves from the East Compton squad of black girls. During  tryouts they meet a sneering gymnast Missy who replaces a member after  hurting herself during the first practice when they were doing the pyramid.  Missy played by Eliza Dushku from Buffy Vampire Slayer fame.Unlike the  most recent film about cheerleaders But I'm A Cheerleader were they were  the focus of scorn and ridicule. This movie dosn't deal with such issues.  largely due to Jessica Bendinger's sunny peppy efervescent script which  dosn't relie on cliches. Also is from Director Peyton for delivering a high  energy level that never makes it drag. Also with some show stopping  gymnastics. it is a 90 minute pep rally. As always Kirsten Dunst is sunny  who is completely charming.

However, she discovers that her previous Captain has been stealing the routines off their competition from East Compton. Now Perky Torrance has to find a way to come up with some original moves to win the National. Some of the things she tries fail terribly but she findsinner strength to motivate her cheer squad to become champs again...Not much of a plot, but most teen movies don't seem to have solid ones. And to tell you the truth, I don't want teen flicks to have one. Movies like &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgmont High&quot; didn't point anywhere, but created and dealt with hilarious situations. However, when writers tend to throw in plots, it can go tedious real quickly (example is the lame movie &quot;She's all that&quot;).I watched this and &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; this weekend and I have to admit, I found &quot;Bring it on&quot; more entertaining. Both movies have actresses who had strong starts but have not continued in such a fashion. Anna Paquin had an incredible start in &quot;The Piano&quot; and then faded to second billing obscurity (other than playing Rogue in X-men). Kirsten Dunst also had a breakout role as the Vampire Claudia in &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;, but recently has made some pretty lousy movies like &quot;Small soldiers&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; and &quot;Get over It&quot;. However, she find her mark in this movie.When I say she finds her mark, I mean she plays Torrance with the appropriate amount of airheadedness and valley girl posture that the role requires. If Dunst had played this role with the intelligence I know she has, it would have been unbelievable. Dunst (who looks young in some shots and much older in others--bizarre) follows the &quot;clueless&quot; formula: Be completely shallow in the beginning, screw up and lose face in the middle, redeem oneself and get the right man at the end of this movie. It's pretty generic and depends on the lead female character to be charming enough to fool the audience into believing that the story is actually fresh. Dunst pulls it off.She is aided by co-star Eliza Dushku, who does a decent job as her teammate. They have a good buddy chemistry together. Dunst also creates the chemistry with her male love-interest Jesse Bradford, who plays his character with some sarcastic (if lifeless) wit. However, he produces no chemistry himself therefore making his role as Torrance's lover interest unbelievable. Other sub-par performance come from over the top idiot choreography wannabee Sparky Polanski (Ian Roberts), her jealous &quot;friends/rivals&quot; and Torrance's younger brother, who has no role other than to be a pest.Also, the subplot involving the East Compton Clovers or the stereotype that Male Cheerleaders are automatically considered gay are more interesting, but are only given surface treatment.The ultimate factor why I recommend this movie is the Cheerleading itself. While I am not interested in competitive cheerleading, the movie provided excitement in the way it shot the scenes and the energy that was shown on the screen. I actually could believe that these actresses/actors could actually be cheerleaders. For that eye-candy I give high credit to the Choreographers of this movie.If you though Clueless was a great movie, then this movie will be pleasantly interesting.

529185,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00003CXMO,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","I can picture ""Bring It On"" director Peyton Reed in high school. He was on the Audio Visual Squad, and when they were showing a film in class he would wheel in the 16mm projector. The cheerleaders would look right through him, like he didn't even exist. They only went out with the jocks on the football, basketball, or baseball teams. Someday, he told himself, I will be a film director, and then they will notice me. He began his familiar day dream that went something like this:He was transferred from another school to one with horrible teams, but really hot cheerleaders. He was an outsider, a loner, who spent his time honing his electric guitar skills, and he could really rock out. His sister, also an outsider, spent her time honing her gymnastic skills. This school didn't even have a gymnastic program, so she had to join the cheerleading squad. Though he and his sister both shared a cynical attitude about cheerleading, she made friends with the head cheerleader and they had sleep overs. The head cheerleader's boyfriend was also a cheerleader, but he is now away at college. Maybe he was a little light in the loafers. Anyway, he is out of the picture. Since nature abhors a vacuum...[At this point the film gets stuck and the hot projector lamp begins to melt the frame. Still caught up in his daydream, young Peyton can only stare at the melting film. A blonde cheerleader looks at him and thinks: ""What a dork.""]When I saw Peyton Reed in the bonus material, I was struck by his resemblence to Jesse Bradford, who played Cliff in ""Bring It On."" Of course Bradford was better looking than Peyton Reed ever was, even in his prime, but he was what Peyton Reed might have looked like in his own fantasy. Cliff was clearly a wish fulfillment projection of the director's. The fact that the vintage rock band t-shirts that Cliff wore were all taken directly from the wardrobe of Peyton Reed is only further evidence. The whole ""Bring It On"" project is a ploy for Peyton to live out his cheerleader fixation through Cliff.The Cheerleader Fantasy scenario is very potent. Just ask Charlie Sheen.  It explains the bikini car wash scene where they are raising money to hire a choreographer, too. That was all a part of the day dream that Peyton Reed would slip into whenever he got the chance, the dream he has been chasing since high school...But I don't begrudge him his dream. Most writers, musicians, or film makers are motivated by such delusions. Even athletes, I dare say, get into the game for similar reasons. The question is, how was Peyton Reed able to channel those fantasies into a successful film?Here is how:The characters of Cliff (Jesse Bradford) and Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku) give us a hip and cynical point-of-view from which to observe the cheerleaders. We are all too cool to care about a bunch of cheerleaders, but secretly wish we could date them or be one. Cliff and Missy allow us to do that while still maintaining our distance. We can mock the cheer leaders, as Cliff and Missy do, but through Cliff we can date the head cheerleader, and through Missy, be a part of their clique.------------------------Whitney: [talking about Missy to Courtney] Excuse me, where did you park your Harley?===============================Though Courtney and Whitney try to discourage Missy from joining the squad, Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), the head cheerleader, is the only one whose opinion matters. Missy and Shipman bond, to the point of having sleep overs. Kirsten Dunst does a great job of making you care about her character. Though she is kind of obsessed with cheerleading, you still feel like she is not a bad person. She has compassion for others and tries to do the right thing. We are still cheering for the rich White cheerleaders, The Toros, even when it is revealed that Big Red, the former head cheerleader, had stolen their routines from an inner city squad from East Compton, the Clovers.-----------------------------------[Torrance is stressed after knowing they had stolen Clovers' routine]Torrance Shipman: Do you know what this means? My entire cheerleading career has been a lie.Missy: Well, look on the bright side - It's only cheerleading!Torrance Shipman: I *am* only cheerleading.===========================================Gabrielle Union plays Isis, the head Clover, and three of the cheerleaders are in the group Blaque, who also perform on the soundtrack. The rap and hip hop elements really invigorate the Cheer genre. Even though The Toros, the mostly White cheerleading squad, stole their routines from The Clovers, ""Bring It On"" is slanted to favor The Toros. There are some barbs directed at the friends of Dorothy as well. But wait a minute, give ""Bring It On"" a chance to ""Do The Right Thing."" Before you judge its political correctness, watch until the end. You might be surprised.--------------------Whitney: Oh, don't play dumb.

It will make you want to stand up and cheer.Kirsten Dunst plays Torrence, the newly elected captain of the Toros, the defending national champion high school cheerleading team.  While working out the new routine for this year's tournament, Torrence finds out that the previous captain had been stealing ideas from an inner-city school that never had enough money to compete.  This year, under a new captain, the Clovers plan to win the tournament, and they are on to the Toros' gameplan.The acting is fairly good in the movie, and the snappy dialogue makes it even better.

On the day she becomes captain, Torrence starts off her leadership with a bang, or at least one of her cheerleaders does.  Poor Carver falls from the top of a pyramid and breaks her leg.  This means that the Toros have to find a new girl to take her place.  The auditions are set and the competition is less than fierce.  The final decision is made and Missy Pantone, Eliza Dushku, against the other cheerleaders complaints (""She likes look an uber-Dyke""), becomes the new Toro.  Little does Torrence know but Missy's brother is that guy from 1st period who caught her eye and will soon catch her spirit fingers.  The squad soon finds out that Big Red (the old captain of the squad) has stolen all the cheers that made them champions from a rival schools squad that is now headed by the beatiful Gabrielle Union.  The Clovers challenge the Toros, and the squad must now come up with an origianl cheer to use at the regionals and the nationals if they want to hold on to their title of #1.

529193,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXMO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","I love Bring It On.  I had never gotten around to watching it until I found out Eliza Dushku was in it, and I was thrilled to discover that this film delivers all kinds of great stuff, plays out on a level far above that of most ""teen comedies,"" and (lest we not forget) features a bevy of beauties in cheerleading outfits.  Personally, I think every movie should work a few cheerleaders into the script, but until that happens I have Bring It On to make the wait a little easier.  I've never really been a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, but now I have figured out why: I really hadn't seen any of her movies.  Dunst, as Torrance Shipman, makes a perfect head cheerleader - bright and perky, yet committed to her sport and a great human being.  That's why, when she finds out that the cheers that led her Rancho Carne Toro cheerleaders to five consecutive national championships were stolen from the local inner-city East Compton Clovers squad, she is mortified.  Having already learned all of their routines, her fellow cheerleaders, with the exception of the new girl in town, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku) don't seem to care - not until the Clovers show up at a Rancho Carne football game (if you can call what the incompetent team does out on the field football) and basically calls them out.  Torrance goes to great lengths to reinvent her squad, yet her plans blow up in her face at the regional competition.  Granted a spot in the nationals thanks to their previous championship, the team has three weeks to come together and ""bring it"" for a national championship face-off with the Clover squad.Naturally, there is a romantic component to the film, which plays out quite well in a subtle and oftentimes comical sort of way, but the biggest impression conveyed by the film is the commitment, hard work, and dedication required to be a competitive cheerleader.  Ah, who am I kidding?  The biggest impression is that of Eliza Dushku absolutely burning up the screen in one of the sexiest performances of all time, but the whole ""cheerleading is hard work"" theme comes in second.  Wait, actually the minor yet crucial role played by Wonder Years alum Lindsay Sloane (who has grown up ""real good,"" let me tell you) is second - then it's the hard work thing.  Okay - wait, Kirsten Dunst's energetic and adorable performance comes in third.  But, believe me, that hard work thing does come across, though.  Bring It On qualifies as a classic in my mind, and it certainly breaks new ground in terms of portraying cheerleaders in a serious and respectful fashion.This movie doesn't even wait for the credits to roll before giving you your money's worth, as the initial scene reaches out and grabs you immediately.  The movie never really slows down from there, avoiding the sort of lull that has doomed many a teen comedy in the past.  Even the closing credits are great fun to watch.  The DVD only adds to the bounty, featuring all kinds of special features: deleted and extended scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, home movies of the memorable car wash scene, wardrobe and makeup tests with Dunst and Dushku, the music video for the song As If from Blaque (whose members make up part of the Clovers squad in the movie), a director's commentary, and more.

529194,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXMO,Daniel McInnis,"[1, 1]","To see the trailer for Bring It On you might be expecting it to be just another in a long line of mind-numbing teen oriented comedies.  But in truth it's actually a very acute social satire on high school politics and the they way they inevitably follow us into later life.  I don't mean to put it among such contemporary classic as Heathers and Election (both of which are far superior), if simply because it lacks the mean-spirited edge that put those films in such exclusive company.  But it's that lighthearted tone that makes this movie so distinctive.  The filmmakers aren't trying to spoof cheerleaders, in fact they paint a pretty flattering potrait of them as atheletes, and they never patronize their characters by dismissing them or their problems as inconsequential.Kirsten Dunst (The Virgin Suicides) is mostly to thank for this.  She takes an earnest approach to the role of Torrance, playing her as a real person rather than a sterotypical characterization, as many young actors make the mistake of doing.  Torrance is the newly appointed head cheerleader who, after losing a teammate on the first day of practice, is put in the position of having to hold auditions to find her replacement.  The void is eventually filled by a spunky gymnast named Missy who joins the squad only after learning the school doesn't have a gymnastics team.  The two almost instantly hit it off, but after seeing their routine for regionals Missy brings Torrance to the stark realization that they've been lifted from a hip-hop squad across town.So they're faced with the dilemma of who to do, but it's not until they're shown up at one of their team's football games that they introduce the idea of reiventing themselves and coming up with an original routine.  Their initial course of action is to hire a professional choreogrpher called Sparky, which is one of the few truly funny moments in a movie where the laughs are suprisingly sparse.As all of this is going on Torrance engages in an unspoken romance with Missy's brother, Cliff.  This is when Dunst puts her impressive acting skills on display by conveying emotion without ever having to say a word.  It's a testament to her as an actress that at such a young age she can be so expressive in a nonverbal way.  She takes the character and the relationship seriously, which is what makes the movie so engaging.  It's asking us to root for these girls rather than laugh at them.Two of the biggeest misconceptions I've encountered with this film is that it's sexist, when it's actually the polor opposite, and that it's a knee-slapping comedy like There's Something About Mary or Kingpin, when it's actually more of the chuckling variety.  It's just not the type that'll have you in stitches, though there are a few good one-liners.Director Peyton Reed shows great promise as a young director.  He moves the story along at a swift pace, never letting things get too bogged down and knows when to end his movie, which is becoming increasingly rare.  Most young directors like to let the falling action linger a little too long, but Reed cuts right from the climax to the outtakes reel, which is as good as the movie itself.  And he does it to the Toni Basil cheerleading anthem &quot;Mickey.&quot;  This is the high point of the film and is placed right where it belongs, at the end.  A movie should leave you on a high note rather that using up all it's best material in the first few minutes, as is becoming all too common.Between Bring It On, the moderately funny American Pie and Alexander Payne's Election, I have renewed hope in the resurgence of the teen comedy.  Hollywood seems to be shying away from trying to recreate Animal House or Fast Times at Ridgemont High and allowing their filmmakers to get really creative with the genre.",3,Dunst  Brings  Credibility  to  Cheerleading  Movie,983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,3791,"['see', 'trailer', 'Bring', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'be', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'mind-numbing', 'teen', 'oriented', 'comedies', 'truth', 'actually', 'very', 'acute', 'social', 'satire', 'high', 'school', 'politics', 'way', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'later', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'put', 'such', 'contemporary', 'classic', 'Heathers', 'Election', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'simply', 'mean-spirited', 'edge', 'put', 'films', 'such', 'exclusive', 'company', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'movie', 'so', 'distinctive', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'spoof', 'cheerleaders', 'fact', 'paint', 'pretty', 'flattering', 'potrait', 'atheletes', 'never', 'patronize', 'characters', 'dismissing', 'problems', 'inconsequential.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'mostly', 'thank', 'earnest', 'approach', 'role', 'Torrance', 'playing', 'real', 'person', 'rather', 'sterotypical', 'characterization', 'many', 'young', 'actors', 'make', 'mistake', 'doing', 'Torrance', 'newly', 'appointed', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'losing', 'teammate', 'first', 'day', 'practice', 'put', 'position', 'having', 'hold', 'auditions', 'find', 'replacement', 'void', 'eventually', 'filled', 'spunky', 'gymnast', 'named', 'Missy', 'who', 'squad', 'only', 'learning', 'school', ""n't"", 'have', 'gymnastics', 'team', 'two', 'almost', 'instantly', 'hit', 'off', 'seeing', 'routine', 'regionals', 'Missy', 'Torrance', 'stark', 'realization', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lifted', 'hip-hop', 'squad', 'town.So', ""'re"", 'faced', 'dilemma', 'who', 'do', 'not', ""'re"", 'shown', 'up', 'one', 'team', 'football', 'games', 'introduce', 'idea', 'reiventing', 'coming', 'up', 'original', 'routine', 'initial', 'course', 'action', 'hire', 'professional', 'choreogrpher', 'called', 'Sparky', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'laughs', 'are', 'suprisingly', 'sparse.As', 'going', 'Torrance', 'engages', 'unspoken', 'romance', 'Missy', 'brother', 'Cliff', 'when', 'Dunst', 'impressive', 'acting', 'skills', 'display', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'ever', 'having', 'say', 'word', 'testament', 'actress', 'young', 'age', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'expressive', 'nonverbal', 'way', 'character', 'relationship', 'seriously', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'engaging', 'asking', 'root', 'girls', 'rather', 'laugh', 'them.Two', 'biggeest', 'misconceptions', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'film', 'sexist', 'when', 'actually', 'polor', 'opposite', 'knee-slapping', 'comedy', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Kingpin', 'when', 'actually', 'more', 'chuckling', 'variety', 'just', 'not', 'type', ""'ll"", 'have', 'stitches', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'one-liners.Director', 'Peyton', 'Reed', 'great', 'promise', 'young', 'director', 'story', 'along', 'swift', 'pace', 'never', 'letting', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'when', 'end', 'movie', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'Most', 'young', 'directors', 'let', 'falling', 'action', 'linger', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Reed', 'cuts', 'right', 'climax', 'outtakes', 'reel', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'Toni', 'Basil', 'cheerleading', 'anthem', 'quot', 'Mickey.', 'quot', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'placed', 'right', 'where', 'end', 'movie', 'should', 'leave', 'high', 'note', 'rather', 'using', 'up', 'best', 'material', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'becoming', 'too', 'common.Between', 'Bring', 'moderately', 'funny', 'American', 'Pie', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Election', 'have', 'renewed', 'hope', 'resurgence', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'shying', 'away', 'trying', 'recreate', 'Animal', 'House', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'allowing', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'really', 'creative', 'genre']",Bring It on VHS

529200,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00003CXMO,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","""Bring It On"", with its peppy cheerleading routines, is a modern morality tale for teens.Its heroine is Torrence Shipman, played by an appropriately perky Kirsten Dunst, who has just been elected captain of her school's cheereleading squad. An injury to one of the squad members results in her having to look for a replacement, which she finds in a new student named Missy Pantone, whose hard edge is sharply emphasized by Eliza Dushku.Missy bails out of practice on the first day, and the subsequent confronation between her and Torrance results in Torrance's discovery that her squad's award winning routines were actually stolen by the squad's previous captain, Big Red (a cold and conniving Lindsay Slone). The two girls have a hostile encounter with the captain of the wronged squad, Isis. Exoctically beautiful Gabrielle Union was well-chosen for this part because her assertiveness is established at the very beginning.Torrence sets out to correct Big Red's mistakes, even though the choice made her unpopular with a few of the squad members. In the process, she hires a choreographer of questionable credentials, which results in her team's humiliation during the State Championship tryouts.In the meantime, the friendship between Missy and Torrence grows, as does a relationship between the determined cheerleading captain and Missy's brother,(a very down-to-earth Jesse Bradford). Noteworthy is the similarity of the two friends' households, each complete with an either mildly antagonistic or completely disgusting brother.Hard hit by the setback, and determined to have a fair contest between her squad and the inner city East Compton Clovers, Torrence regroups. In the meantime, the Clovers come up with their own way to raise money to attend the National cheerleading competition. Attention is given to the streetwise nature of the Clovers but also to their willingness to work their way towards their goal by their own bootstraps. Torrence and Isis both compliment each other in their marked determination to make the contest as fair as possible.One point of curiosity is how the heroine's squad managed to come up with the money to hire a mime and three new choregraphers within a limited amount of time between championships after their disastrous showing at State.Viewers of this movie are treated to spectacular cheerleading routines and a satisfactory out come. But emphasis is also given to cheerleading as a dangerous sport as well.This film deals with a lot of real issues faced by modern teenagers, and it does a great job of pointing a moral compass on issues such as integrity.",4,It Is Better To Lose With Honor Than to Win By Deceit,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,2603,"['Bring', 'peppy', 'cheerleading', 'routines', 'modern', 'morality', 'tale', 'teens.Its', 'heroine', 'Torrence', 'Shipman', 'played', 'appropriately', 'perky', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'captain', 'school', 'cheereleading', 'squad', 'injury', 'one', 'squad', 'members', 'results', 'having', 'look', 'replacement', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Missy', 'Pantone', 'hard', 'edge', 'sharply', 'emphasized', 'Eliza', 'Dushku.Missy', 'practice', 'first', 'day', 'subsequent', 'confronation', 'Torrance', 'results', 'Torrance', 'discovery', 'squad', 'award', 'winning', 'routines', 'were', 'actually', 'stolen', 'squad', 'previous', 'captain', 'Big', 'Red', 'cold', 'conniving', 'Lindsay', 'Slone', 'two', 'girls', 'have', 'hostile', 'encounter', 'captain', 'wronged', 'squad', 'Isis', 'Exoctically', 'beautiful', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'was', 'well-chosen', 'part', 'assertiveness', 'established', 'very', 'beginning.Torrence', 'sets', 'out', 'correct', 'Big', 'Red', 'mistakes', 'even', 'choice', 'made', 'unpopular', 'few', 'squad', 'members', 'process', 'choreographer', 'questionable', 'credentials', 'results', 'team', 'humiliation', 'State', 'Championship', 'tryouts.In', 'meantime', 'friendship', 'Missy', 'Torrence', 'grows', 'relationship', 'determined', 'cheerleading', 'captain', 'Missy', 'brother', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Noteworthy', 'similarity', 'two', 'friends', 'households', 'complete', 'mildly', 'antagonistic', 'completely', 'disgusting', 'brother.Hard', 'hit', 'setback', 'determined', 'have', 'fair', 'contest', 'squad', 'inner', 'city', 'East', 'Compton', 'Clovers', 'Torrence', 'regroups', 'meantime', 'Clovers', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'way', 'raise', 'money', 'attend', 'National', 'cheerleading', 'competition', 'Attention', 'given', 'streetwise', 'nature', 'Clovers', 'also', 'willingness', 'work', 'way', 'goal', 'own', 'bootstraps', 'Torrence', 'Isis', 'compliment', 'other', 'marked', 'determination', 'make', 'contest', 'as', 'fair', 'possible.One', 'point', 'curiosity', 'how', 'heroine', 'squad', 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'hire', 'mime', 'three', 'new', 'choregraphers', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'championships', 'disastrous', 'showing', 'State.Viewers', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'spectacular', 'cheerleading', 'routines', 'satisfactory', 'out', 'come', 'emphasis', 'also', 'given', 'cheerleading', 'dangerous', 'sport', 'well.This', 'film', 'deals', 'lot', 'real', 'issues', 'faced', 'modern', 'teenagers', 'great', 'job', 'pointing', 'moral', 'compass', 'issues', 'such', 'integrity']",Bring It on VHS
529201,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00003CXMO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","I remember the old days of turning on ESPN every year and to see the High School cheerleading competitions. When I saw this movie come out and beat X-Men who was the reigning king at the box offices and stay #1 for a week or two, I figured it is either another teen movie like American Pie or another teen movie in general.One of the reasons for purchasing this movie is because I have enjoyed the movies that Kirsten Dunst appeared in.  Second, I enjoyed what Universal has done with their last &quot;teen&quot; movie &quot;American Pie&quot; and filled that DVD up with special features galore.  With &quot;Bring it on&quot;, again Universal loads this DVD up with cool features.First, I am very happy to announce that Universal has included DTS for audiophiles out there.  You get the Digital 5.1 and DTS for this movie.  Although mostly a dialogue movie, there is a lot of music and the cheers come to life on this DVD.  The Making of &quot;Bring it On&quot; was also a treat to watch including the deleted scenes, extended scenes which both feature pre-commentary of why he took them off.  I always feel that is important.  I wish though that the deleted scenes were separated and not one big chunk.  The never-before-seen home movies of the car wash scene are good enough and will please the guys and the wardrobe and makeup test was pretty cool to watch as well.  Also, a music video from Blaque, the &quot;Did You Know That?&quot; animated anecdotes gives you a reason to watch this movie three times (once on DTS, once with directors commentary and third with the anecdotes) and the cool DVD-Rom features as well.This DVD is jam packed.

529204,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXMO,D. Litton,"[8, 12]","There is something truly special about the unexpectedly entertaining comedy &quot;Bring It On,&quot; which will do more than just keep you laughing. Unlike most other teeny bopper films about the lives of high school students in certain demographics, this film, under the direction of Peyton Reed, takes a serious approach to its subject matter while also incorporating humor into the script. The story is as light and breezy as some of the cheers involved, while also giving its young cast a chance to have a lot of fun with their acting, making the experience all the better for the audience.The opening scene is a bit of a putdown on cheerleaders, stereotyping them as typical popular people that rule the school, so to speak. This all turns out to be a dream sequence in the mind of Torrance, the blond, bright high school senior who is up for nomination as the new head cheerleader of the Toros. After a summer of practice and physical workouts, the cheerleading squad is eager to learn their cheers again, so when Torrance becomes the new captain, they go right to work. After one of the girls becomes injured, they hold tryouts in order to try and find a suitable replacement. This scene in particular is comedic genius, ranging from such practitioners as a Broadway hopeful to a strip-club dancer wannabe, with the judging table looking on in sheer disgust.They find the perfect replacement in Missy, who has the rough-tough appearance but ultimately delivers in terms of strength and ability to do the moves. At one point, Torrance refers to Missy as the best they've seen (&quot;Missy's the poo, so take a big whiff&quot;). But when Missy watches one of their routines, she realizes that they are stolen cheers, and she whisks Torrance over to an opponent high school to watch the Clover cheerleaders do the same routine they've been practicing for weeks. Torrance discovers that it was, in fact, the departed captain who vandalized the opposing squad, and begins frantically thinking to try and figure out some new cheers.Going on from this point will ruin a lot of the humor and surprises the film has to offer, so I will stop giving out the plot. I will tell you, though, that this is one of the brightest and most successful teen films since &quot;American Pie,&quot; and just as funny without the crude humor sexual situations. Don't get me wrong: &quot;American Pie&quot; is a terrific film, and goes right for its demographic perfectly. But &quot;Bring It On&quot; proves to us that movies of this sort do not have to rely solely on crudity and vulgarities simply to make us laugh. We find humor in the dilemnas the squad faces, as well as how they go about solving them, and that is something that proves to be quite refreshing.The humor leaves nothing to be desired here, keeping us laughing throughout the film while also adding to the overall perkiness of the story. There is a very small subplot that involves Torrance and her brother, and while it does not have an effect on the major story at hand, it does provide us for some hearty laughs (that's the last time I listen to my brother when he says he wants to tell me something). A truly remarkable scene of comedy is the scene in which the squad employs the services of a choreographer, who tells them that &quot;cheerleaders are dancers who have gone retarded.&quot; He begins by telling them their flaws from the start, from skinny ankles to an ... that could have its own URL address. While it is intimidating to the girls, it's incredibly funny to watch. The competitions also have a lot to give us in terms of laughs, and you can learn a few things from these scenes, like never telling a nervous cheerleader to smile or speak, and that guy cheerleaders aren't always &quot;sexually controversial.&quot;Perhaps the centerpiece for the film is the choreography of the stunts and cheer sequences, which are given to us in a straightforward and in-your-face manner. Instead of seeming drawn out, overly long and boring, the cheers make us happy, keep the pep of the film flowing, while also showing us some of the real talent that went into the making of this film (there is only one stunt scene of cheerleading in the entire movie). There is some exciting and fascinating stuff going on here, especially in the scene at the national finals. The audience learns that at a competition like this, it's not all battle for the big win, but about having fun in what you're doing and keeping a good outlook on spirit.I found the young and incredible cast to be immensely likeable and easy on the eyes to watch. Instead of just reading lines, they all know what they are doing, and they do it extremely well. Kirsten Dunst is a knockout head cheerleader, and smart and sassy as Torrance, who, while always sounding whiny and annoying, never fails in making it easy to watch her be that way. It's not a putoff at all, but rather adds to her character's appeal. Eliza Dushku plays the hip newcomer cheerleader Missy, who is sort of the double standard character that like to cheer, but also keeps in touch with the other side of her life as well. Her character shows us that people who play a sport and enjoy it as much as these girls do also have other things in their lives to do. Each one of the cheerleaders is played out according to a certain stereotype: There is the male cheerleaders, who are always in a constant battle to defend their sexuality, and there are the typical ditzy cheerleaders who have nothing better to do than say things like &quot;Let's not put the 'duh' in dumb,&quot; and argue with every decision the captain makes. All of the diversities combine in making the squad a character in itself.A breath of fresh air for the teenage genre, &quot;Bring It On&quot; is remarkably sweet, peppy to perfection, and solid entertainment. It keeps us involved in a light story that gives us a powerhouse display of a sometimes forgotten sport, brought to life by a stunning cast that brings on the laughs and the cheers.",5,Peppy and

It's a cute, fluffy, teen comedy that wasn't so fluffy that you could throw up but it still had the fluff factor.It's about a team of cheerleaders, The Rancho Carne Toros, who are the 5 time defending cheerleading champions. After a harsh injury to one of thier teammates, they are forced to fund a replacement for her, in walks Missy (Eliza Dushku). After her first practice, she breaks it to her team that their cheer routines are STOLEN from an inner city step squad. Not believing Missy, Torrance, team captain of the Toros (Kirsten Dunst) goes with her and funds out that it was true. And now, along the way to Nationals, they find that they are in a heated rivalry and that they must come out with their own unique routine to show that they do deserve their champions title.O.k. I won't lie, it is funny but it's more of a light hearted jab at the world of cheerleading. Plus it's brand a light comedy works for this movie. Mostly made up of wise cracks. Bring It On will surely make you laugh.The routines are actually pretty cool to watch. I'm not really a competitive cheerleading fan, but I will say I was impressed with the routines and that they were fun to watch. The only reason that I'm taking off a star for this movie is that the opening sequence of the movie was the only part that really made me laugh, otherwise I just chuckled here and there.I still think it's worth a buy.

I found this understandable at the time; I was, after all, only seeing it because it featured Eliza Dushku. What I hadn't been expecting was the peppy, energized and ultimately funny movie that followed.The story is simple: the Torros, a high school cheerleading team, are consecutive winners of the national championship. They seem destined to win the prize yet again until it's discovered that Big Red [who is one of the highlights] had stolen all the routines of a less fortunate team. So begins a classic rivalry situation, mixed in with an admittedly charming romance.The characters are all exactly what you expect them to be, and the actors throw themselves into their roles with gusto. Claire Kramer shines as half of the back stabbing duo, while Kirstin Dunst and Eliza make the perfect good girl/not-so-good girl twosome.Capping off the casts adrenaline fueled perfomances is a thumping soundtrack, and a score done by the ever reliable Chris Beck. After viewing you're likely to find yourself with a new found appreciation for the athleticism and all around dedication cheerleading demands. The routines are simply amazing. And, while the film is predictable, it doesn't matter as you are so caught up in the fun. That's all it is: harmless fun.The extras are good, and to be honest I was surprised that this movie got such good treatment. They display the &quot;good time&quot; feel of the feature, and are all well worth a look.So, if you're looking for quick laughs or a boost, buy this DVD.

It turned out not to be so.  The story is actually quite good, with the occasional stereotype thrown in to show you, that this is in fact a Hollywood film.  The main characters are Torrance Shipman played by Kirsten Dunst, the painfully perky leader.  Another is Missy played by Eliza Dushku, the &quot;rebel&quot; who does gymnastics in her spare time, a ludricous concept to say the least.  The last main character is Isis, played very well by Gabrielle Union, she is the leader of a rival cheerleader squad in East Compton.  The three leads are very well played, and are very engaging, and all have great one-liners.  The plot is quite engaging.  I don't like to give away the plot in my reviews, since I like going in clean myself.  The great thing about this movie, is that the production team and actors, never take the material too seriously, and everything is tongue in cheek.

I am among the adults, 31 yrs. old, and I liked this movie -- It had alot of heart, and it's a cute little story with a great soundtrack.  I think Kirsten Dunst is one of the better younger actresses right now, and she has a great future in Hollywood.  She was very convincing as the new captain to the cheerleading squad for the Toros(a championship winning squad at that).  Come to find out that her whole cheerleading career is a lie when she learns all the cheers are stolen from another squad from East compton.  So they have to come up with something original.  One of the funniest scenes is when a &quot;professional choreographer&quot; comes to teach them a thing or two about real dancing.  Eventually they do have to come up with their own cheer for the finals in Florida. This is a cheery little film, no pun intended.  It wasn't great,but it is well worth the rental fee.

529216,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXMO,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 2]","A crowd pleaser of a film, ""Bring It On"" is essentially a high school sports story for girls.  Though the cheering squad has boys on it, the film is clearly dominated by the young women.  This represents a fresh entry into that genre, as I can't remember ever seeing another film that focuses on competitive cheerleading.  The film is actually well constructed, with an interesting story underlying numerous highly athletic cheerleading scenes.Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the National Champion cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High (that name cracks me up, literally translated it means ""Meat Ranch"").  She discovers that the former captain stole all their cheers from an inner city high school and this year that high school intends to compete in the regional championships with the same routine.  Torrance has to come up with a new routine in just a few weeks.  This is an appealing twist on the normal sports story because it focuses on the champions as the underdogs (like the Rocky sequels).  They also throw in a Cinderella story with the East Compton Clovers, who are coming from obscurity to compete at the national level.The film is lively, energetic, and generally fun to watch, although we aren't delving into the mysteries of the universe here.  It takes cheerleading seriously and attempts to legitimize it as a serious endeavor, dealing candidly with the team members' self consciousness about their own sport.  The teen scenes are well written, giving a frank look at some real issues teens face, like the back biting rivalries and mocking condescension between cliques.  They even pack in a teen love story to further engage their target audience, which is clearly teenage girls.Kirsten Dunst is spunky, perky, sprightly, vivacious, and otherwise youthfully exuberant.  In short, she is perfect for the part.  While it is true, a strong breeze could have blown Torrance away (literally and figuratively) Dunst captures the emotions and concerns of her character realistically and effectively (Dunst's being 18 undoubtedly helped).  There are numerous other good performances.  I am particularly impressed with Eliza Dushku as Missy.  She is by far the most substantial character in the film and brings a great deal of maturity to the part.  Among the entire cast, Dushku is the only actor I can see succeeding in role outside the teen genre.  Gabrielle Union, as Clovers' team captain Isis, is powerful and audacious and gives the entire Clovers team a strong image.  I also enjoyed Cody McMains as Torrance's sarcastic kid brother who goes to see his sister compete in the National Championships wearing a Cheerleading = Death tee-shirt.This is a good film for young girls and is highly entertaining for just about anyone.  It was a resounding financial success grossing seven times its meager $10 million budget.  It is well directed and has numerous funny high school moments, along with plenty of scenes where teens take themselves all too seriously.  I rated it 8/10, since it is better than many of the films in its genre.  It's true that it is cotton candy cinema, (insubstantial but sweet), however it is worth seeing if you enjoy teen flicks.",4,High Energy Entertainment,982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,3198,"['crowd', 'pleaser', 'film', 'Bring', 'essentially', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'story', 'girls', 'cheering', 'squad', 'boys', 'film', 'clearly', 'dominated', 'young', 'women', 'fresh', 'entry', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'film', 'competitive', 'cheerleading', 'film', 'actually', 'well', 'constructed', 'interesting', 'story', 'underlying', 'numerous', 'highly', 'athletic', 'cheerleading', 'scenes.Torrance', 'Shipman', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'new', 'captain', 'National', 'Champion', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'Rancho', 'Carne', 'High', 'name', 'cracks', 'up', 'literally', 'translated', 'Meat', 'Ranch', 'former', 'captain', 'stole', 'cheers', 'inner', 'city', 'high', 'school', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'compete', 'regional', 'championships', 'same', 'routine', 'Torrance', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'routine', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'appealing', 'twist', 'normal', 'sports', 'story', 'champions', 'underdogs', 'Rocky', 'sequels', 'also', 'throw', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'East', 'Compton', 'Clovers', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'obscurity', 'compete', 'national', 'level.The', 'film', 'lively', 'energetic', 'generally', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', ""n't"", 'delving', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'here', 'cheerleading', 'seriously', 'attempts', 'legitimize', 'serious', 'endeavor', 'dealing', 'candidly', 'team', 'members', 'self', 'consciousness', 'own', 'sport', 'teen', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'giving', 'frank', 'look', 'real', 'issues', 'teens', 'face', 'back', 'biting', 'rivalries', 'mocking', 'condescension', 'cliques', 'even', 'pack', 'teen', 'love', 'story', 'further', 'engage', 'target', 'audience', 'clearly', 'teenage', 'girls.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'spunky', 'perky', 'sprightly', 'vivacious', 'otherwise', 'youthfully', 'exuberant', 'short', 'perfect', 'part', 'true', 'strong', 'breeze', 'could', 'have', 'blown', 'Torrance', 'away', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Dunst', 'emotions', 'concerns', 'character', 'realistically', 'effectively', 'Dunst', 'being', '18', 'undoubtedly', 'helped', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'good', 'performances', 'am', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Missy', 'far', 'most', 'substantial', 'character', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'maturity', 'part', 'entire', 'cast', 'Dushku', 'only', 'actor', 'can', 'see', 'succeeding', 'role', 'teen', 'genre', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Clovers', 'team', 'captain', 'Isis', 'powerful', 'audacious', 'entire', 'Clovers', 'team', 'strong', 'image', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Cody', 'McMains', 'Torrance', 'sarcastic', 'kid', 'brother', 'who', 'see', 'sister', 'compete', 'National', 'Championships', 'wearing', 'Cheerleading', '=', 'Death', 'tee-shirt.This', 'good', 'film', 'young', 'girls', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'just', 'anyone', 'was', 'resounding', 'financial', 'success', 'grossing', 'seven', 'times', 'meager', '10', 'million', 'budget', 'well', 'directed', 'numerous', 'funny', 'high', 'school', 'moments', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'where', 'teens', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'rated', '8/10', 'better', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'true', 'cotton', 'candy', 'cinema', 'insubstantial', 'sweet', 'however', 'worth', 'seeing', 'enjoy', 'teen', 'flicks']",Bring It on VHS

529220,A2NRJPY8LPHYJL,B00003CXMO,ghtx,"[2, 4]","Peyton Reed's tenny-bopper high school comedy &quot;Bring It On&quot; poses the ethical question: while it is clearly immoral to ogle after high school age girls, is it moral to ogle after twenty-something actresses portraying high school girls? Pondering over this question, along with participating in the above-mentioned ogling, is just about all the enjoyment that you'll get from this standard pre-teen magnet. Kirsten Dunst is her usual bubbly self, and the charm and energy that was splendid in &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; is here just as splendid but now tiresome and repetitive. She is joined by some other cute boys and girls whose names it is not really worth mentioning. There are plenty of funny scenes, the choreoraphy is cool, and the plot is, of course, ludicrous and beyond reproach. The attempt to add a (try not to snicker) social conscious by involving a candy wrapper glossed over racism subplot doesn't really work, especially as the stereotypes keep flying.

All goes well as the team shows off their spunk and prepares for their 6th championship title.....but then Torrance has a messy confrontation with Isis, the captain of the Clovers, a squad across town that is equally as talented as Torrance's team. Apparently, Torrance's predesessor as captain, &quot;Big Red,&quot; used some top-notch routines from the Clovers to lead her squad to all those national titles. Now that Isis is the new captain, she ain't showin' no mercy. So, now is the time for Torrance and her team to come up with a new routine and ensure that they make it to nationals. But it isn't easy, because Torrance is forced to deal with two fellow cheerleaders who are itching to take over Torrance as captain, and not many of the others are interesting in wiping the slate clean and starting all over with some fresh new routines.

I can't see how anyone could dislike this movie. It's entertaining to the max with an intriguing story that has so much poignancy yet mixes in more comedy than you could imagine. Bring It On is quite simply, an awesome party movie with magnificent ideas and an engaging and unforgettable opening scene. I loved it a lot and watch it all the time. Now, for the performances. Kirsten Dunst carries the entire movie on her shoulders with excellent comic ability. She also has very many emotional scenes and I could relate with her determination or sadness. Eliza Dushku, however, is the star. She is the black-haired, in-your-face and deliciously pretty girl that is all new in the world of cheerleading. I knew Eliza had something going for her after she played Faith in Buffy, The Vampire Slayer and hopefully her movie career will pick up from his exuberant experience. Peyton Reed's direction is fast, focused and fabulous; he never lets the movie slow down. Jessica Bendinger's awesome script is creative, cool and sexy.

It was supposed to be about a cheerleading competition between the rich white (and Asian) cheerleaders and the poor but noble black girls from the bad part of town.  It seems the white girls ex-leader has stolen all the cheers from the rival school, no one had figured this out in years but it falls on Kristen Dunst to rectify this situation when she finds herself the new captain.  So far so good, the trouble is that this film quickly deteriorates into, yet another &quot;She's All That-10 things I hate about you-Drive Me Crazy-American Pie&quot; thing.  The real conflict isn't about race or economic station, it is will the rich good girls accept the rich &quot;bad girl&quot; who is really a gymnast but is trying cheerleading because, for some reason, there is no gymnastics (curios, as the school had everything else).  She has a fake tattoo and listens to punk rock, will she fit it?  Who cares?  What this film majors in is very, very pretty young girls running around in all manner of skimpy attire, Yeah baby Yeah!!  This is the only redeeming feature, but redeeming it is.  We go into the locker room for underwear showings off and there is even an obligatory &quot;car wash&quot; with massive bikini footage.  Kristen Dunst is an absolute babe, she is so pretty (as is the rest of the cast) that one can almost forgive the fact that in the end, the film sabotages it's original attempt to decry racial and economic inequities by doing what it criticizes society for, marginalize and stereotyping blacks.  The black cheerleaders, (they are all black by the way, leading one to believe there either were no poor whites or at least no with any rhythm) are never seen out of uniform, we learn nothing about where they live and what they think, they only cheer and threaten the rival group with violence, like a bunch of gagsta ho's.  Pretty insulting if you think about it, don't bother thinking too much, the writers didn't.  To get money for the trip the Black girls go on Opera Winfrey and beg.  The final is a showdown between the two squads, who will triumph?  Who really cares.  Great cheerleading though, and lots of scanty clad teenage girls almost make up for this...almost.

The plot; Dunst takes over as cheerleading captain for `Lily-White High School' only to discover that the departing captain had stolen all of their routines from an inner city squad at `Mostly Black High School'.  What a moral quandary!  Things really take a wacky turn when the Lily-Whites then have to face the Mostly Blacks at nationals!  Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans may will enjoy the presence of not just Faith, but the overlooked Glorificus as well.  All of the stock teen stereotypes are present in Bring It On, and strangely enough so is the perpetuation of  the `myth' that male cheerleaders are generally Nancy boys.  I would have thought that a movie that is trying to portray cheerleading in a positive light would have tried to avoid that.  One of the males has the `hilarious' predilection of digitally raping his female counterparts while they are performing together.  His victims seem to love it!  Nice message for teenage boys from Hollywood, young girls LOVE unwanted digital penetration!.  Another point of contention is why are the inner city kids the Clovers?  If there is some subliminal message there, I really don't get it.  Maybe it was left on the cutting room floor.  So while the story may have had a little promise, its limited appeal and limiting script assured that the movie wouldn't live up to it.  I can't believe Kirsten Dunst hasn't fired her agent yet for continuing to let her star in these weak teen movies.  It's as if she were aging in reverse.  But, all this aside, I did watch the whole thing and would again.

529241,A2ZE73RFY0GD3K,B00003CXMO,J. Reynolds,"[4, 11]","Not since ""War and Peace"" has a narrative work so stunningly brought to life, or at least to the active imagination, an endeavor so rich, memorable, profound and inspiring as does ""Bring It On,"" a contemporary cinema adaptation (with modifications) of the archetype of American novels, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" by John Steinbeck.  The struggling Joad family has been metaphorically reconstructed as an intrepid group of high school cheerleaders facing one overwhelming adversity after another.  The Tom Joad character, herein portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, assumes leadership early in the story, then firmly holds the reins for the rest of the film, overcoming disharmony on the team, the discovery that their prior leader cheated by stealing cheer routines, an unfaithful boyfriend and a devious little brother.  The rumor in Hollywood was that Dunst's character, Torrance, was modeled as a combination of ""Dominique Francon"" and ""Dagny Taggart"" from, respectively, ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged,"" and that rumor might have been true though unverifiable.  The Joad family's journey to California from Oklahoma was altered into a series of cheerleading competitions.  As with ""Grapes,"" ""Bring It On"" was speckled infrequently with humorous interludes -- the totally lousy football team, the dumb football players, the vicious team-mates -- but otherwise presented a paragon of film gravitas covering an extremely important social issue:  poverty and economic depression (here, however, presented in the form of cheerleading).  We see one group of impoverished cheerleaders overcome their financial problems, then win the championship, their leader the ""Bring It On"" version of the Steinbeck character ""the preacher,"" who evolves from spewing religious sermons to organizing labor strikes and leading a union in furtherance of social justice.  One of the out-takes, which wasn't ever filmed or even written, had Torrance delivering the utterly riveting Tom Joad monologue toward the end of the film:  ""Whenever you see a cheerleading pyramid collapse, I'll be there.  Whenever you hear someone shout, 'Burrrrr, it's COLD in here!  There must be some Toros in the at-mo-sphere,' I'll be there.  Whenever you hear hands clapping, the rustle of pom-poms, fans hollering... I'll be there.""  (It was feared moviegoers would be weep so profusely at hearing that soliloquy, they might not have been able to recover emotional control in time for the movie's triumphant ending, so Kirsten's ""I'll be there"" speech was never even composed.)""Bring It On"" features no cameo appearances by famous literary personages such as John Updike, Phillip Roth or Anne Rice, so don't even bother watching for them.  Due to this movie's impact, its achieved standing as the apotheosis of social-message films -- ""Bring It On"" probably will end up being one of those works of art which actually alters societal thinking, propagating permanant changes in humanity's conduct, such as happened with ""The Origin of the Species"" -- there is a great likelihood that Kirsten Dunst will never again be able to work in cinema without being regarded as ""Torrance.""

On top of that they have tons of deleted AND extended scenes, a never before seen car wash scene w/ Kirsten and the other cheerleaders in bikinis, the music video &quot;As If&quot; from Blaque and some clips of Kirsten and Eliza Dushku from the Wardrobe &amp; Make up tests!  If you thought that was a lot, they also threw in a documentary &quot;THE MAKING OF BRING IT ON&quot; w/ exclusive interviews from Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Blaque and more!  Only thing is I wish there was more of the group BLAQUE in the movie ~ they hardly had any speaking parts! For all you cheerleaders, you'll LOVE the cheers all the different squads perform through out the movie. Lindsay Sloane from the WB's &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; has a small but great part of the former cheerleading captain who stole all the cheers~!!

529263,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXMO,Matthew Horner,"[2, 5]","Bring it On is a movie about the trials and tribulations that exist in the world of high school cheer leading - the fears, the work and the hopes endured by squads vying for a place in a national championship. On TV we often see programs that document the quaint and sometimes downright weird cultural practices of people in other countries. Bring it On reminded me that we have some pretty odd practices right here at home. In one scene, the main character says, &quot;I'm a cheerleader. That's what I am.&quot; What a strange view of self that it! Is there a social anthropoligist in the house?Torrance [Kirstin Dunst] is the new captain of The Toros, the cheerleaders from a school in an affluent part of San Diego. They have been national champions for five years and have the exaggerated sense of importance such dubious competitions bring. Her world is deflated when she learns that the routine the team won the last contest with was stolen from a group in East Compton, an intercity - and mostly black - neighborhood in Los Angeles. To make matters worse, the East Compton team is aware of the theft and is also trying to enter this year's competition. Naturally, they despise the uppity Toros.The movie starts with a dream sequence about the Toros that is both satirical and hilarious. For its first half hour, it stays on track and promises to be smart and funny, as in Election, one of the best teen movies of recent years. Then it changes course. It becomes sappy and serious for the most part. You can almost see the executives at Sony, the company that produced it, picking at the original script, hacking away its heart and replacing it with material gleaned from some focus group. The confrontations between the black team and the mostly white Toros have been sanitized and sweetened, I believe, and, as a result, Torrance's attempts to reach out come across as merely patronizing.The best thing about Bring it On is that it stars Kirstin Dunst, one of our best young stars. She has the ability to tackle virtually any role. She is excellent as Torrance, making a likable character out of someone who is, for the most part, a bimbo. Another good performance is given by Gabriel Union as Isis, the captain of the East Compton team. There are also some well choreographed cheer leading routines, all of them of the 'don't try this as home' variety.Bring it On is an example of a recent Hollywood trend. It has the tone and subject matter of an &quot;R&quot; rated movie, but has been edited in such a way that it can squeak by with a &quot;PG-13.&quot; Commercially, I see the logic of this trend. Entertainment-wise, I don't.

This was a great film, and I was laughing right the way through. I just thought that would be a cool title. You don't need much thinking to enjoy this film. Which makes it very easy for me to like. It means I'm not constantly who this guy is and what is he doing, and why is he doing it. Just sit back, relax, and let the simpleness go straight over your head.It was very slow to start with. There were no great pop/dance songs, or any spectacular cheerleading stunts. Those all came later. At the beginning, it was just simple things, with a little chemistry between Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Bradford, and her boyfriend cheating on her, and refusing to kiss her in front of the ""parentals"".Lets skip all the boring bits to talk about the characters. Kirsten Dunst is once again stereotyped as the blonde bubbly girl, who's always smiling. Gabrielle Union seems to appear in every teenage film around, and she's normally gets on my nerves. And she never plays one of the lead characters either. Jesse Bradford I have personally never heard of, but will need to get more films out with him in them! Very nice. He reminded me of Donny Osmond in some scenes - I don't think he'd appreciate that comment though! He played a great lead up against Kirsten Dunst.However, the shining star in this film was Eliza Dushku. Previously starring as the bratty daughter of Arnold Schwarzneggar in True Lies, she's plucked her eyebrows, and grown up. The whole film seemed to light up when she appeared, and she gave her part so much more energy that she managed to outshine Kirsten Dunst. Something that couldn't possibly be done. But she was the highlight of this film for me, coming in to try out for cheerleading in the beginning, a rebelling teenager (with a very Pamela Anderson tattoo), to at the end a reformed teenager, who smiles and enjoys cheerleading. Her face is a picture when she first watches the rest of the `team' cheerleading.This movie had one of the greatest soundtracks ever! I need this soundtrack. From your typical cheerleading songs (""Mickey"" originally by Toni Basil, done here by B*Witched, a now defunct Irish girl group) to some of the rockier songs (the one that Jesse's character sings to Kirsten), to some songs which are undeniably catchy (""As If"" by Blaque - nope, never heard of them either). I'm not the dancing type, and I didn't dance to it, but it's the kind of music I would probably dance around my room to, if no one were around! They are typically great pop songs, and that's the kind of stuff I like.The extras are also very good, although I'll never find the Easter egg. The Blaque video was quite disappointing to watch, they seemed to be basing themselves on Destiny's Child/TLC. No wonder I've never heard of them. You have 45 minutes of extras to watch, and they seem to fly by.This is one of the few films I've ever actually watched right to the very end of the credits (apart from Titanic and Matrix Reloaded). There's the cast dancing and miming (albeit badly) to ""Mickey"" before the credits even start rolling, and then there's outtakes going on in the background (memorable highlight: Kirsten Dunst royally messing up her lines and swearing about it), and then the great pop songs playing over the end credits. I finished watching this film on such a high.This is one for both guys and girls to watch. The girls will be wondering if they could have made it into a cheerleading team if they lived in the USA (the answer is no), and the guys will have their tongues hanging out most of the time! The little cheerleading outfits, the very unnecessary but apparently needed car washing sequence, where all the girls are quite literally poured into bikinis, and ham it up for the camera.",4,Watch if you&#65533;ve had a brain bypass,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,3767,"['However', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'laughing', 'right', 'way', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'title', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'thinking', 'enjoy', 'film', 'very', 'easy', 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'constantly', 'who', 'guy', 'what', 'doing', 'why', 'doing', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'let', 'simpleness', 'go', 'straight', 'head.It', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'start', 'were', 'great', 'pop/dance', 'songs', 'spectacular', 'cheerleading', 'stunts', 'came', 'later', 'beginning', 'was', 'just', 'simple', 'things', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'boyfriend', 'cheating', 'refusing', 'kiss', 'front', 'parentals', '.Lets', 'skip', 'boring', 'bits', 'talk', 'characters', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'once', 'again', 'stereotyped', 'blonde', 'bubbly', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'smiling', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'appear', 'teenage', 'film', 'normally', 'nerves', 'never', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'have', 'personally', 'never', 'heard', 'will', 'need', 'get', 'more', 'films', 'out', 'Very', 'nice', 'reminded', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'comment', 'played', 'great', 'lead', 'up', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst.However', 'shining', 'star', 'film', 'was', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Previously', 'starring', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzneggar', 'True', 'Lies', 'plucked', 'eyebrows', 'grown', 'up', 'whole', 'film', 'seemed', 'light', 'up', 'when', 'appeared', 'gave', 'part', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'energy', 'managed', 'outshine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Something', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'done', 'was', 'highlight', 'film', 'coming', 'try', 'out', 'cheerleading', 'beginning', 'rebelling', 'teenager', 'very', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'tattoo', 'end', 'reformed', 'teenager', 'who', 'cheerleading', 'face', 'picture', 'when', 'first', 'rest', 'team', 'cheerleading.This', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'greatest', 'soundtracks', 'ever', 'need', 'soundtrack', 'typical', 'cheerleading', 'songs', 'Mickey', 'originally', 'Toni', 'Basil', 'done', 'here', 'B*Witched', 'now', 'defunct', 'Irish', 'girl', 'group', 'rockier', 'songs', 'one', 'Jesse', 'character', 'sings', 'Kirsten', 'songs', 'are', 'undeniably', 'catchy', 'Blaque', 'nope', 'never', 'heard', ""'m"", 'not', 'dancing', 'type', 'did', ""n't"", 'dance', 'kind', 'music', 'would', 'probably', 'dance', 'room', 'one', 'were', 'around', 'are', 'typically', 'great', 'pop', 'songs', 'kind', 'stuff', 'like.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'Easter', 'egg', 'Blaque', 'video', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'watch', 'seemed', 'be', 'basing', 'Destiny', 'Child/TLC', 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'have', '45', 'minutes', 'extras', 'watch', 'seem', 'fly', 'by.This', 'one', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'actually', 'watched', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'credits', 'apart', 'Titanic', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'cast', 'dancing', 'miming', 'badly', 'Mickey', 'credits', 'even', 'start', 'rolling', 'then', 'outtakes', 'going', 'background', 'memorable', 'highlight', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'royally', 'messing', 'up', 'lines', 'swearing', 'then', 'great', 'pop', 'songs', 'playing', 'end', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'high.This', 'one', 'guys', 'girls', 'watch', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'cheerleading', 'team', 'lived', 'USA', 'answer', 'guys', 'will', 'have', 'tongues', 'hanging', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'little', 'cheerleading', 'outfits', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'apparently', 'needed', 'car', 'washing', 'sequence', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'quite', 'literally', 'poured', 'bikinis', 'ham', 'up', 'camera']",Bring It on VHS

Cheerleaders everywhere are usually seen to everyone as blonde, and very girly, who just want to show off their bodies. This movie proves it is not true, but only a false stereotype that everyone likes to believe. Although I myself am not a cheerleader, I now understand that they do more than just show off, they compete against other cheerleaders, and learn hard routines. It's kind of like a gymnastics thing.This movie also shows that sexuality is questioned when you are a cheerleader. Everyone expects the girls to be heterosexual, and the male cheerleaders to be homosexual, which this movie proves is wrong. Not all guys are homosexual just because they are cheerleaders.The Toro cheerleaders have a great routine, and a horrible leader. When Big Red's reign over the cheerleaders is over, senior Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) becomes the captain. During her reign as captain, she discovers that Big Red stole their perfectly choreographed routines from another squad from San Diego. The squad must hurry to find a new routine to compete in the next competition.Between realizing that her boyfriend is cheating on her with another girl at his college, and getting over the ""Spirit Stick curse"", and falling for Missy's cute brother, Torrance and the Toros learn to create their own hot moves for the cheer squad that noone has seen before; and they only have a short amount of time to do it.This is a great film to watch, especially if you are within the age of middle or high school.

The story was a send-up of cheerleaders too, and send-ups are always fun.  The story here is of a cheer team that discover that all their past trophies have been a joke, with dance routines ripped off from another local high school.  They've got to come up with a new routine...and fast!It contains some of the best teen actresses around.  Unfortunately Kirsten Dunst never really gets to show what she's made of in an easy role.  Yet she's certainly never less than effective as our heroine and, most importantly we root for her.  Still, I can't help but think she was that much more effective as the dreamy troubled teen in 'The Virgin Suicides' or as an eternal child in 'Interview With The Vampire'.  The supporting cast is great though, with Eliza Dushku and Clare Kramer (Faith and Glory respectively from 'Buffy', although you might remember Dushku from earlier movies such as 'True Lies' or 'That Night') shining.  Both give great pep to their roles.  In fact, there's a little bit of a 'Buffy' theme going on here.  Sharp-eyed viewers may spot one of the Cordettes playing Whitney, and the school looks an awful lot like Sunnydale High.  Oh, and there's also Valerie from 'Sabrina' playing Big Red.The best points of the movie are the hilarious routine at the start, with the girls strutting their stuff with pasted smiles on their faces, and the dance routines themselves.  They are not only superbly choreographed but absolutely stunning to watch.  Plus, the way in which these girls flaunt their sexuality whilst still remaining perfectly virginal is obviously intentional and well observed.However, the movie is dragged downhill by several things.  Firstly, for all its efforts not to be conventional, it's blatantly obvious who the heroine will end up with.  Cue the obligatory cute (but thankfully not obnoxious) romance.  Also, there's the fact that the winners of the cheerleading finals were not as good as those that came second place.  This may not seem like a big thing but when watching it's incredibly annoying.At the end of the day this is more enjoyable than a lot of teen movies out there, but it's by no means spectacular.",3,Average teen movie made better by good performances,1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,2253,"['came', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'had', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'had', 'become', 'smash', 'hit', 'story', 'was', 'send-up', 'cheerleaders', 'too', 'send-ups', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'story', 'here', 'cheer', 'team', 'past', 'trophies', 'have', 'been', 'joke', 'dance', 'routines', 'ripped', 'off', 'local', 'high', 'school', ""'ve"", 'got', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'routine', 'fast', 'best', 'teen', 'actresses', 'Unfortunately', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'never', 'really', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'easy', 'role', 'certainly', 'never', 'less', 'effective', 'heroine', 'most', 'importantly', 'root', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'dreamy', 'troubled', 'teen', ""'The"", 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'eternal', 'child', ""'Interview"", 'Vampire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Faith', 'Glory', 'respectively', ""'Buffy"", 'might', 'remember', 'Dushku', 'earlier', 'movies', 'such', ""'True"", 'Lies', ""'That"", 'Night', 'shining', 'give', 'great', 'pep', 'roles', 'fact', 'little', 'bit', ""'Buffy"", 'theme', 'going', 'here', 'Sharp-eyed', 'viewers', 'may', 'spot', 'one', 'Cordettes', 'playing', 'Whitney', 'school', 'awful', 'lot', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'Oh', 'also', 'Valerie', ""'Sabrina"", 'playing', 'Big', 'Red.The', 'best', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'hilarious', 'routine', 'start', 'girls', 'strutting', 'stuff', 'pasted', 'smiles', 'dance', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'superbly', 'choreographed', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'watch', 'way', 'girls', 'flaunt', 'sexuality', 'whilst', 'still', 'remaining', 'perfectly', 'virginal', 'obviously', 'intentional', 'well', 'observed.However', 'movie', 'dragged', 'downhill', 'several', 'things', 'Firstly', 'efforts', 'not', 'be', 'conventional', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'who', 'heroine', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'Cue', 'obligatory', 'cute', 'thankfully', 'not', 'obnoxious', 'romance', 'Also', 'fact', 'winners', 'cheerleading', 'finals', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'came', 'second', 'place', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'big', 'thing', 'when', 'watching', 'incredibly', 'end', 'day', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'lot', 'teen', 'movies', 'there', 'means', 'spectacular']",Bring It on VHS

529289,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CXMO,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","OK, I will admit that I watched this for one and only one reason:  I'm a major fan of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and I thought it would be fun to see a film with two major characters from BUFFY in a different context, Eliza Dushku (Faith) and Clare Kramer (Glory, the hell goddess from Season Five and the second blonde lead in this one after Kirsten Dunst).  I was surprised that the film actually stood up on its own.  No question a lot of this is due to the fact that the leads are talented.  Kirsten Dunst has since begun to develop into one of the hot actresses in Hollywood, and Eliza Dushku has been a scene-stealer in everything she has been in.  In BUFFY, there wasn't a moment when her Faith didn't dominate every scene she was in, and while she hasn't yet really gotten the kinds of roles she should, one can't help but feel that, as they say, her future is in front of her.  Gabrielle Union, who plays the head of the inner-city cheerleading squad, is also a very charismatic performer.  To be honest, all of them are a lot better than this movie, but they all conspire to make what might have been a pretty average picture very decent indeed.The pretext of the film is a mainly white (with token Asians) high school is five time national cheerleading champions, despite the fact that their football team is hideous (at the football game, the fans lamely applaud the football team, but passionately greet the cheerleading squad).  Unknown to the members of the squad, however, they have managed this under their former captain by stealing routines from an underexposed but extraordinarily talented inner city high school, where she would go to film their routines.  A newcomer to the squad, Missy, recognizes the routines as having originated elsewhere, and this creates a moral crisis for the squad, and especially for their new captain, played by Kirsten Dunst.  From this point on, the film should be fairly predictable, but the great thing is that it isn't at all.  Is it all improbable?  Of course.  But is it fun?  Sure.One more bit of Buffy trivia, while Eliza Dushku was in this one with Clare Kramer, this past year she was in a pretty miserable movie (despite starring one of my favorite actors, Terence Stamp) called THE KISS in which Charlie Weber appeared, who played &quot;Ben&quot; in Season Five of Buffy and who was, of course, linked in the same body with Clare Kramer's &quot;Glory.&quot;",4,A very surprisingly decent comedy,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2418,"['OK', 'will', 'admit', 'watched', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'reason', ""'m"", 'major', 'fan', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'film', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'BUFFY', 'different', 'context', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Faith', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Glory', 'hell', 'goddess', 'Season', 'Five', 'second', 'blonde', 'lead', 'one', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'actually', 'stood', 'up', 'own', 'question', 'lot', 'due', 'fact', 'leads', 'are', 'talented', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'begun', 'develop', 'one', 'hot', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'been', 'scene-stealer', 'everything', 'been', 'BUFFY', 'was', ""n't"", 'moment', 'when', 'Faith', 'did', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'really', 'gotten', 'kinds', 'roles', 'should', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'that', 'say', 'future', 'front', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'who', 'head', 'inner-city', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'also', 'very', 'charismatic', 'performer', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', 'conspire', 'make', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'average', 'picture', 'very', 'decent', 'indeed.The', 'pretext', 'film', 'mainly', 'white', 'token', 'Asians', 'high', 'school', 'five', 'time', 'national', 'cheerleading', 'champions', 'fact', 'football', 'team', 'hideous', 'football', 'game', 'fans', 'lamely', 'applaud', 'football', 'team', 'passionately', 'greet', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'Unknown', 'members', 'squad', 'however', 'have', 'managed', 'former', 'captain', 'stealing', 'routines', 'underexposed', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'inner', 'city', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'film', 'routines', 'newcomer', 'squad', 'Missy', 'routines', 'having', 'originated', 'elsewhere', 'moral', 'crisis', 'squad', 'especially', 'new', 'captain', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'point', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'great', 'thing', ""n't"", 'improbable', 'course', 'fun', 'Sure.One', 'more', 'bit', 'Buffy', 'trivia', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'was', 'one', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'past', 'year', 'was', 'pretty', 'miserable', 'movie', 'starring', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'called', 'KISS', 'Charlie', 'Weber', 'appeared', 'who', 'played', 'quot', 'Ben', 'quot', 'Season', 'Five', 'Buffy', 'who', 'was', 'course', 'linked', 'same', 'body', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'quot', 'Glory.', 'quot']",Bring It on VHS

529295,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00003CXMO,Shashank Tripathi,"[7, 13]","To be fair, this cheery travesty of a movie had the potential to be several different kinds of movies.It could have been a hilarious satire on the rah-rah spirit behind the odd concept that cheerleading is a sport in itself, and there were flashes of this at times. It could have been a serious movie about the effort and dedication it takes to become the best at something, and there were more than a few flashes of that. It could have also been a &quot;Rocky&quot; or &quot;Karate Kid&quot; type movie where the underdog fights against all odds to come out on top, and it seems that was what the filmmakers were aiming for, but they picked the wrong characters for the leads for us to root for that.What we end up with though is mere hints of all of the above, and no follow-through on any consistent theme. The first 30 minutes of the film have several satirical gags about the cheerleaders but then insists that we take them seriously later on. I spent close to the entire movie trying to decide whether I should be rooting for the central characters or their rivals.The acting isn't bad and the cheer routines are done well. They may even be the most entertaining part of the entire movie. There are several laughs, mostly in the first part of the movie. After that it gets dull and plodding. You never get to know any of the secondary characters at all, which wouldn't be a problem in a satire but is a problem when the movie starts taking itself seriously.Overall, a seriously mediocre movie, and the sad part is that it had the potential to be so much better if someone would have decided what the hell they wanted to do.",2,"BRING IT ON INDEED, BECAUSE IT GETS NOWHERE AND FAST.",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,1629,"['be', 'fair', 'cheery', 'travesty', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'several', 'different', 'kinds', 'movies.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'rah-rah', 'spirit', 'odd', 'concept', 'cheerleading', 'sport', 'were', 'flashes', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'movie', 'effort', 'dedication', 'become', 'best', 'something', 'were', 'more', 'few', 'flashes', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'quot', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'quot', 'movie', 'where', 'underdog', 'fights', 'odds', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'was', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'aiming', 'picked', 'wrong', 'characters', 'leads', 'root', 'end', 'up', 'though', 'mere', 'hints', 'above', 'follow-through', 'consistent', 'theme', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'have', 'several', 'satirical', 'gags', 'cheerleaders', 'then', 'take', 'seriously', 'later', 'spent', 'close', 'entire', 'movie', 'trying', 'decide', 'should', 'be', 'rooting', 'central', 'characters', 'rivals.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'cheer', 'routines', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'dull', 'plodding', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'secondary', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'satire', 'problem', 'when', 'movie', 'taking', 'seriously.Overall', 'seriously', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'sad', 'part', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'decided', 'what', 'hell', 'wanted', 'do']",Bring It on VHS
529296,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00003CXMO,Simon,"[1, 1]","This is a very fun, energetic movie, and one of my guilty pleasures. It stars many beautiful ladies, including Kirsten Dunst (Torrance) and Eliza Dushku (Missy), and balances goofiness with enough seriousness to make us care about the characters. The performances are great, the cheerleading routines are fun, and there's enough here for guys and girls that it makes a pretty good date movie (heck, even the romance subplot worked for me).Though the cover shows what seems like two Cheerleading squads in direct competition, the movie actually focuses on Kirsten's squad; the other squad is, more or less, a plot device which makes the Cheerleaders get their act together in time for the big competition. While I wish the focus would have been a little more balanced, it's a minor complaint, because the story is still solid (how many teen movies can you actually say that about?).As if this great movie doesn't sell you on the DVD, Universal has packed in TONS (and I mean TONS) of extra features. There is a hilarious director commentary, another ""pop-up-video"" style text commentary, and tons of deleted footage, extended footage, and fun footage, including the car wash, Kirsten and Eliza's makeup tests, and the extended locker-room steady cam (hey, I'm a guy!). As icing on the cake, there's also a fun easter egg to find.This is a great DVD package. A fun, colorful teen movie that has something for both sexes, and solid extras to boot.

529298,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CXMO,S. Schell,"[17, 22]","A surprise hit whose profit substantially elapsed its $10 million budget, ""Bring It On"" boasted little and earned a lot.  Awash with several unknown faces and a few familiar ones, it attained delighted reviews from critics and audiences alike and already has a Blockbuster Entertainment Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy (Kirsten Dunst).  Who knew that a story about cheerleading would've produced such fascination among the young American populace?The bubble-gummy tale starts with the torch being passed from former captain Big Red to squeaky-clean senior Torrance Shipman (Dunst), instating the beginning of her reign as the head of her cheerleading squad at Rancho Carne High School.  The very first day she is instructing the Toros, a squad member breaks half the limbs in her body and is off the team.  Since she is a woman short of a Toro entourage, Torrance holds auditions to fill the vacancy and it is here that she meets tough-talking gymnast Missy Pantone (Dushku).  Despite the discrepancy from fellow Toros Courtney and Whitney (great duo of airheads), Torrance decides to recruit her and tracks Missy down to her residence to convince her that being a cheerleader is a lot more than just screaming at aloof patrons from the sidelines - it's a whole different perspective.  Once Missy is drafted, the Toros begin their first practice but they receive a dismayed reaction from their new member.  Baffled by why she is so displeased with their routine, Torrance demands answers and Missy shows her the ugly truth - every cheer the Toros have won their championships with is stolen material.  The mountain of trophies they possess really belongs to an inner-city squad called the East Compton Clovers and they are one...-off bunch of broads.  Many an opportunity to be discovered has been taken from them thanks to Big Red's faithful filching and now the Clovers have a new captain - she's the most intolerant of them all.  With the National Championship just around the corner, Torrance is rapt with the task of composing a completely new routine and by her college boyfriend's recommendation hires a patronizing and insulting choreographer named Sparky.  Three weeks later, they are humiliated at a competition when they discover Sparky's routine has also been given to six other competing squads.  Upon that debasing experience, Torrance is immediately geared for some rigorous labor and the Toros embark on the creation of a cheerleading oeuvre that they can truly call their own.This is director Peyton Reed's first major directing debut as he has done mostly TV work in his career.  His few projects consist of Comedy Central's ""Upright Citizens Brigade"" and a string of short-lived shows.  Reed may be a novice but there is considerable experience in his female-dominated cast.  Kirsten Dunst is an actress who has significantly grown over the years, not only physically but also career-wise.  She was impressive as the doll-like Claudia in ""Interview With The Vampire"" and has furthered impressed in recent flicks such as ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"".  She is beautiful and bankable and will be around for a long time.  Up and comers include the striking Eliza Dushku (an inductee of E! Online's renowned ""Sizzlin' Sixteen"" list), her big break as Arnold Schwarzenegger's rebellious daughter in ""True Lies"" and Gabrielle Union as Isis, the Clover's strong-headed captain.  There is a delectable performance from Jesse Bradford as Cliff, Missy's brother and Torrance's love interest.  Even Cody McMains is wickedly entertaining as Torrance's obnoxious little brother Justin.Jessica Bendinger's screenplay is surprisingly clever and mature for a movie about something as trifling as competitive cheerleading and the majority of her characters are witty and engaging.  There are a lot of cute quips here and there, a good example being when an opposing team at a late night football game lifts their skirts to reveal the spiteful phrase ""You suck"" emblazoned on their tushes.  Not one to back down, the Toros smartly retort with, ""That's all right/that's okay/you're gonna pump our gas someday!""  And who can forget the hilarious reference to Wanda Holloway, the Texas cheerleader-murdering mom who was immortalized in a made-for-TV movie starring Holly Hunter.On the whole, ""Bring It On"" is a highly enjoyable romp into the superficiality of a high school extramural and it brings out the best in every one of its players.

You don't want to admit you've seen this or even like it.  Yet you do.The premise may turn you off.  The story is about rival cheerleading teams who are duking it out for Nationals.  The road is a rough one for both teams.  The side of Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushka (hee) find that their routines have been stolen for the past (we can assume) 4 years.  The other side comes from what could be considered the 'Hood because they have no money to get to Nationals.  Oh, did I mention that Dunst's team stole the routine from their rivals?From where I came from, cheerleading is treated as a joke.  It's for brainless, bubble-gum popping, ditzy girls.  As for male cheerleaders, &quot;that says it all&quot;.  IF YOU CAN PUT THAT ASIDE, it's a very enjoyable film.Upon seeing the routines, you'll wonder why YOUR high school wasn't nearly as athletic as what you are watching.  Have you ever watched the cheerleading comps on ESPN?  The routines in the movie equal to what you see on ESPN.  The routines are just awesome showing that cheerleaders can/are athletes themselves.I really picked this movie up because of Kirsten Dunst.  Yet, she almost gets shadowed by Eliza Dushka who brings in a certain sexiness that Dunst doesn't do.  Both girls do an excellent job of fitting into the high school society (they aren't that far from it...) and it reminds some of us why high school wasn't that great.The movie is full of fun moments (&quot;THOSE AREN'T SPIRIT FINGERS!!!&quot;) and other goofy scenes (a spitting contest between Dunst and Bradford).This is a great movie and a pleasant surprise.

Ok the plot is very simple, and when I looked at the DVD cover, my very first impression was that this movie would be too superficial; but being now an experienced movie buff, I realized that it was a wrong impression, and I was absolutely right !!! This movie is actually full of beautiful pictures and of lovely girls, but on top of that, it is actually very, very deep !!!! First it is mostly a ""honest"" movie; secondly, it contains lots of common sense ideas, back-to-basics; ""Who said laurels were not a good place to rest ?""; ""don't keep your head down ...""; ""always smile....""; etc. etc. Also all the actors are doing great, especially Kirsten Dunst of course ..... . She wonderfully plays a complex Torrance character, a very gifted and generous person who can be either very self-confident or very full of doubts about herself, depending on the events and on the environment. She is really a great person ; so I only regret that her team does not win the competition in Florida at the end of the movie .... . Anyway, apart from that, I like the whole movie. Obviously some scenes are more important than the rest, like when some members of the team want to dismiss Torrance as the captain and her boyfriend Aaron stupidly supports this idea, only to hear that he is probably no valid ""boyfriend material""; also the study of the competition between the mostly black team and the predominantly white team must be an interesting moment for psychologists I suppose... Well anyway there is plenty of good things to say about this movie... Most importantly, it is a good movie to improve your heart beat... the whole movie sort of casts a ray of light and of good humor upon you; and it definitely covers so much on top of Cheerleading.

Her performance really holds this one up.  She's the glue that makes it stick.The opening bit is very funny.  It's a dream sequence in which Kirsten's character is awarded the captainship of the cheer team.  Needless to say, some pretty bizarre things start happening.  The energy level is kept up for the entire movie.My only complaint is that one of the characters changes her personality too quickly.  In the beginning she is supposed to be a tough girl, who hates cheering, but by the end of the movie, she's just one of the girls.  You never really see that happen.  It's just that suddenly in the middle of the movie, she flips.  Bizarre.Overall this is good clean fun.

The film started off that way, then it took me on a ride into the deeply serious world of highschool (ughh) cheerleading. The film itself tries to be a spoof on cheerleading, but it is done at a view that cheering is the only thing that matters in life. These girls diss everyone that is not cool, when in actuallity they should diss themselves. High school is not about popularity, and being cool...what am i talking about! this is a teen movie! of course the only thing that matters is what you wear and where you eat lunch. This film really shows off how &quot;cool&quot; its script is by having a plot that can be seen in any other rotten teenager film. What is that plot? the rich kids battle the inner city school. Real creative, the only thing we need is a battle with the head cool cheerleader and the outsider. Oh my gosh, that is here too!

But it's hardly possible to dislike &quot;Bring It On,&quot; because it succeeds in creating fun in most down-to-earth fashion.  To say it's bad is like kicking a puppy clinging to  your feet.To me, the best thing in &quot;Bring It on&quot; is that it pays due respect to cheerleading, sometimes hugely misunderstood among the people (see &quot;Replacement,&quot; for example&quot;).  I am teaching at women's college in Japan, and I have actually witnessed what they can do once.  It was sensational.  They took my breath away.  &quot;Bring It On&quot; will increase the number of cheerleaders in high school, and it's no wonder.  On top of that, I am willing to welcome Kirsten Dunst in teen movie, whose previous work was &quot;Virgin Suicides.&quot;  I don't say I hate the movie; still, I'd rather give another $ 10 to watch &quot;Bring It On&quot; than to see her dead.  The real find here is, however, Eliza Dushku, who easily steals every scene she's in with her natural charm.  Look how she smiles!The most important key to the success of the film may be, after all, the characters are all taking their life seriously as the exciting national competition of the final scene shows.  We find there that we, young and old, could relate to them.  After all it's good to see people enjoying themselves, and doing what they can do earnestly.  Love cheerleading.  Love life.[FROM HERE BELOW, MY COMMENTARY REFERS ONLY TO VHS SPECIAL EDITION ISSUED IN 2001]As Amazon's technical information is slightly erroreous, I add some correction below.  The tape contains two &quot;deleted scenes&quot;; one of them is a kitchen scene, in which Torrence (Dunst) confesses she has a boyfriend.  The other is the scene where Torrance's parents talk about her future education in college by the side of swimming pool.  The &quot;extended scene&quot; is the locker room scene, originally done in one shot, like De Palma or Scorsese often does.  The director wisely decided to use only the half of it, and for the rest of the scene he substituted frontal shots of Torrance and her friends respectively.  (It may be interesting to compare two takes for fans because total effect is different.)  So, &quot;Locker Room Scene&quot; IS this &quot;Extended Scene&quot;; they are the same thing.  Nothing serious, though, when the feature film is so funny.",5,"It's Sexy, It's Cute, And It's Funny to Boot.",1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2402,"['say', 'predictable', 'say', 'just', 'teen', 'movie', 'hardly', 'possible', 'dislike', 'quot', 'Bring', 'quot', 'creating', 'fun', 'most', 'down-to-earth', 'fashion', 'say', 'bad', 'kicking', 'puppy', 'clinging', 'feet.To', 'best', 'thing', 'quot', 'Bring', 'quot', 'due', 'respect', 'cheerleading', 'sometimes', 'hugely', 'misunderstood', 'people', 'see', 'quot', 'Replacement', 'quot', 'example', 'quot', 'am', 'teaching', 'women', 'college', 'Japan', 'have', 'actually', 'witnessed', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'once', 'was', 'sensational', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'quot', 'Bring', 'quot', 'will', 'increase', 'number', 'cheerleaders', 'high', 'school', 'wonder', 'top', 'am', 'willing', 'welcome', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'teen', 'movie', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'hate', 'movie', 'still', ""'d"", 'rather', 'give', '10', 'watch', 'quot', 'Bring', 'quot', 'see', 'dead', 'real', 'find', 'here', 'however', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'easily', 'scene', 'natural', 'charm', 'Look', 'how', 'most', 'important', 'key', 'success', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'characters', 'are', 'taking', 'life', 'seriously', 'exciting', 'national', 'competition', 'final', 'scene', 'shows', 'find', 'young', 'old', 'could', 'relate', 'good', 'see', 'people', 'enjoying', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'earnestly', 'Love', 'cheerleading', 'Love', 'life', '[', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'BELOW', 'MY', 'COMMENTARY', 'REFERS', 'ONLY', 'TO', 'VHS', 'SPECIAL', 'EDITION', 'ISSUED', 'IN', '2001', ']', 'Amazon', 'technical', 'information', 'slightly', 'erroreous', 'add', 'correction', 'tape', 'two', 'quot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'quot', 'one', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'Torrence', 'Dunst', 'boyfriend', 'other', 'scene', 'where', 'Torrance', 'parents', 'talk', 'future', 'education', 'college', 'side', 'swimming', 'pool', 'quot', 'extended', 'scene', 'quot', 'locker', 'room', 'scene', 'originally', 'done', 'one', 'shot', 'De', 'Palma', 'Scorsese', 'often', 'director', 'wisely', 'decided', 'use', 'only', 'half', 'rest', 'scene', 'substituted', 'frontal', 'shots', 'Torrance', 'friends', 'respectively', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'compare', 'two', 'fans', 'total', 'effect', 'different', 'So', 'quot', 'Locker', 'Room', 'Scene', 'quot', 'IS', 'quot', 'Extended', 'Scene', 'quot', 'are', 'same', 'thing', 'Nothing', 'serious', 'though', 'when', 'feature', 'film', 'so', 'funny']",Bring It on VHS
