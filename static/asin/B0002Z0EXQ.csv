I started off watching this movie expecting to be bored for the next 3 hours of my life, but surpringly, I'm glad to say that I was wrong. Brad Pitt as Achilles makes this entire movie worth watching anyway, but the fact that he totally kicked @ss was an added bonus. Not only is he extremely HOTT!, but he can also pull off playing a Greek legend like a charm. Quite frankly, I haven't seen Brad carry a movie this great in quite some time, so I am most certainly impressed. I also must admit that I underestimated Eric Bana's character ""Hector"" as well because he actually played a great warrior. I was also shocked to see Peter O'Toole because he's definitely a face that I haven't seen in a long time, and he still looks great for his age might I add. I can honestly say that the only character that I was a little diappointed with was Orlando Bloom's character ""Paris"". It's a good thing that he had so many other stronger characters supporting his role because clearly he was just the weak link of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Orlando Bloom, I really do, but his character just wasn't in the same league as the others. To keep it short, I would definitely recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this movie check it out, and then buy it for your collection.

851959,A3JTBRDRK6Q0M3,B0002Z0EXQ,24/F Review,"[5, 6]","Although Troy is clearly a popcorn flick, not a history lesson, if youre going to spend US$150 million to recreate the Trojan War, you may as well get things right. Instead, Wolfgang Petersen seems content to sling together a mishmash of anachronisms that together give a vague, general sense of antiquity, rather than Troy, 1200 BC.A few of the more annoying examples:The statues in the city of Troy? Wrong (theyre actually replicas of Greek kouroi).The coins? Wrong (coins werent invented until several centuries later).The jewellery worn by the Trojan princesses? Wrong (unless those were family heirlooms, theyre a full millennium too old).The thousand Greek ships that set sail? Wrong (the designs are about four centuries off).The 50-foot high wall that encircles Troy? Wrong (in real life it was a ditch).But enough nit-picking  I could spend all day bitching about the historical inaccuracies and I haven't even started about the mishmash of the story (Cassandra's unheeded warnings coming out of Hector's mouth, Laocoon's lines going to poncy Prince Paris, Aeneas appearing with his dad Anchises but looking a trifle too young and with his son nowhere in sight) but Troy isnt worth getting carpal tunnel syndrome for.So, what else is there besides historical deviations and sweeping shots of a fleet of miniature Greek boats in a large bathtub?On the plus side, any movie that sparks interest in the classics has to be a good thing. The film company executives may beg to differ, but if at least one young person is inspired to pick up the Iliad and the Odyssey because of this film, the millions spent on this lavish production will have been worthwhile.Another plus is that theres plenty of eye candy. When I wasnt wishing I could bitch-slap Helen (Diane Kruger) and her even-girlier Trojan prince, Paris (Orlando Bloom), I was shamelessly ogling Achilles (Brad Pitt), the buffed-up Greek warrior who spends much of his time off the battlefield, either en deshabille or in a Beckham-style sarong, cavorting with his Stockholm Syndrome-suffering Trojan slave girl (Rose Byrne).When you film such well-known stories as the Trojan War, the most important issue becomes how you tell the story, not the story itself, and regrettably, Petersens delivery is neither convincing nor eloquent.The acting too is a let-down, especially that of Priam (Peter OToole), Agamemnon (Brian Cox), and Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), who shouldve known better than to be content with cardboard caricatures.Id like to say that I didnt like Troy because of the crap special effects, the superfluous liberties taken with generally accepted myth and the negligent research, but in the end I guess what irked me the most about the movie is that the men have much better hair and look so much sexier in short skirts than I do. In the end, that's all you can say about this superficial summer blockbuster.",2,Where to begin?,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2884,"['Troy', 'clearly', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'youre', 'going', 'spend', 'US', '150', 'million', 'recreate', 'Trojan', 'War', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'Instead', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'content', 'sling', 'together', 'mishmash', 'anachronisms', 'together', 'give', 'vague', 'general', 'sense', 'antiquity', 'rather', 'Troy', '1200', 'BC.A', 'few', 'more', 'annoying', 'examples', 'statues', 'city', 'Troy', 'Wrong', 'theyre', 'actually', 'replicas', 'Greek', 'kouroi', '.The', 'coins', 'Wrong', 'coins', 'werent', 'invented', 'several', 'centuries', 'later', '.The', 'jewellery', 'worn', 'Trojan', 'princesses', 'Wrong', 'were', 'family', 'heirlooms', 'theyre', 'full', 'millennium', 'too', 'old', '.The', 'thousand', 'Greek', 'ships', 'set', 'sail', 'Wrong', 'designs', 'are', 'four', 'centuries', '.The', '50-foot', 'high', 'wall', 'Troy', 'Wrong', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'ditch', 'enough', 'nit-picking', 'could', 'spend', 'day', 'bitching', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'started', 'mishmash', 'story', 'Cassandra', 'unheeded', 'warnings', 'coming', 'Hector', 'mouth', 'Laocoon', 'lines', 'going', 'poncy', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'Aeneas', 'appearing', 'dad', 'Anchises', 'looking', 'trifle', 'too', 'young', 'son', 'nowhere', 'sight', 'Troy', 'isnt', 'getting', 'carpal', 'tunnel', 'syndrome', 'for.So', 'what', 'else', 'besides', 'historical', 'deviations', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'fleet', 'miniature', 'Greek', 'boats', 'large', 'bathtub', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'interest', 'classics', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'company', 'executives', 'may', 'beg', 'differ', 'least', 'one', 'young', 'person', 'inspired', 'pick', 'up', 'Iliad', 'Odyssey', 'film', 'millions', 'spent', 'lavish', 'production', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile.Another', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'When', 'wasnt', 'wishing', 'could', 'bitch-slap', 'Helen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'even-girlier', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'was', 'shamelessly', 'ogling', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'buffed-up', 'Greek', 'warrior', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'battlefield', 'en', 'deshabille', 'Beckham-style', 'sarong', 'cavorting', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome-suffering', 'Trojan', 'slave', 'girl', 'Rose', 'Byrne', '.When', 'film', 'such', 'well-known', 'stories', 'Trojan', 'War', 'most', 'important', 'issue', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'story', 'regrettably', 'Petersens', 'delivery', 'convincing', 'eloquent.The', 'acting', 'too', 'let-down', 'especially', 'Priam', 'Peter', 'OToole', 'Agamemnon', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Menelaus', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'who', 'shouldve', 'known', 'better', 'be', 'content', 'cardboard', 'caricatures.Id', 'say', 'didnt', 'Troy', 'crap', 'special', 'effects', 'superfluous', 'liberties', 'taken', 'generally', 'accepted', 'myth', 'negligent', 'research', 'end', 'guess', 'what', 'irked', 'most', 'movie', 'men', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'hair', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'sexier', 'short', 'skirts', 'do', 'end', 'can', 'say', 'superficial', 'summer', 'blockbuster']",N/A
851960,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B0002Z0EXQ,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 2]","The Illiad gets Hollywood treatment and loses all poetry and awesomeness and what made it a classic of Western Civilization, not surprisingly. My main beef in addition to the theatrical release lacking any emotional depth or characters I cared about at all was that the story was stripped of its crucial mythological underpinnings. Where are the gods? Homer isn't meant to be real history. It'd be like if they did Lord of the Rings without magical wizards...instead Ian McKellen is an old hermit and there's no magical ring. They're just good northern European medieval people fighting an evil league of Roman Catholics, Turks, Middle Eastern peoples and Africans. Anyway. Yes they think Troy existed but that ain't the point of Homer and as far as realism goes (IF that's what they aimed for..) it didn't successfully flesh out ancient Greek life and war. I recall a scene of thousands of cgi spear carriers running across a field and feeling like you do when you're consciously watching a mundane ""special effect"", not something you feel real or compelling. Ex. of realistic type ancient battle is found here-->Braveheart Poster Movie 11x17 Mel Gibson Sophie Marceau Patrick McGoohan Catherine McCormackand...here: Rome: The Complete First Season. This Troy movie is a pedestrian sword and sandal battle flick. The battles weren't exciting except for a moment when poor Hector must face Achilles.. you had to feel bad for the guy. Achilles himself came across as almost neurotic and whinny but I still didn't care for him. And I think Pitt is a solid actor. My 2 cents. I'd recommend the amazing Rome: The Complete Series for godless, metaphysical free truly gritty realism. You're in the streets with the plebs smelling the body odor and gagging on the overpowering aroma of the sewage and rotting things and you could get shanked, beaten and robbed or worse... and you're also brought into Machiavellian soap opera intrigues of wicked aristocrats.

851962,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002Z0EXQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","My feelings on Troy are mixed.  While I did enjoy the action/war scenes that reminded me of Lord of the Rings, there was the small detail to the story and plot that just completely blew my mind.  Why, if you are going to make a history epic such as this, would you focus so intently on the characters that the story (which should have been the star of the film) pretty much falls to the wayside?  I think that it has something to do with who you have carrying your story.  If you have actors that are a little less defined in their careers, perhaps you would focus more on the story giving us the way that Homer would have been happy with.  Instead, we headline huge actors to carry the roles and focus more on the shirtless wonders of the world instead of the written word.  It is sad and unforgivable at the same time.To begin, let me tell you what I really liked about this film, which shouldn't take up too much space, but is still worthy of mention.  I loved the grand scale of this film.  When I read Homer's work, I didn't think of this tiny little incident that felt and looked like a back lot to a movie studio.  I wanted epic visions of land, wars, and chaos.  I wanted to be placed right in the action by being transported to the era visually and audibly.  Director Wolfgang Petersen did this with the greatest of ease.  This is a big production film, and he never allowed us to forget that.  Second, I enjoyed the smaller stories of this film.  The hints and references made to the culture at the time that allowed those three years of Latin class, Greek Mythology, and history of Troy seemed to constantly keep a grin on my face and my mind in motion.  It reminded me of Disney's Hercules, one of the most underappreciated Disney films out there.  There were subtle hints and clever moments that just placed that intelligent smile on your face.  Troy did the same even threw in a couple ""fun"" CGI moments for everyone to share, but sadly that was it.If you could turn the sound off on your television or surround sound and watch this film, you probably will experience a better picture than I did.  From the opening scene until the very anti-climactic moment in Troy, the hardest trouble that I had was the accents that accompanied our actors.  Brian Cox is one of the worst as I nearly found myself laughing in hysteria when he bellowed his first lines in a very un-Greek British accent.  This was followed by Orlando Bloom dawning a very unmasculine British accent coupled with Peter O'Toole looking very un-Trojan in his element.  If that wouldn't have been the tip of the ice cream, we were allowed to add sprinkles with the grunting force of Brad Pitt as our heroine/anti-heroine Achilles.  Taking moments from Rocky and Cobra, Pitt gives us his worst performance to date as a man given the strength of millions, but the emotions of a child.  It is sad to see Pitt butcher such an amazing character and never look back in suspicion.  This was not the role for him, and somebody (even the best boy) should have stepped out of his place to inform the Hollywood hitter that perhaps he was making a grave mistake.  Unfortunately, nobody came through and Troy was created and the power of Fight Club was thrown right out the window.  Corporate Hollywood had its field day in the Trojan sun.Another steaming issue that I had with this film was the pacing and timing of the overall picture.  Why did it take two hours to get to the most popular moment of the film?  Why did Petersen bog the viewers down with idle moments of passion and unnecessary character development when really we were most interested in learning about the infamous ""Trojan Horse"" and the ""Achilles Heel"" references?  I would hate to say it, but those were two of the reasons why I was very interested in seeing this film.  I wanted to see Petersen's portrayal of this historical moment, but instead what I discovered was that choppy editing left too much on the sandy desert floor.  It felt, at least to me, that the ending was very rushed and very underdeveloped.  The ending seemed cheaper to me, and without giving anything away, almost out of the precedent set forth by the beginning of the film.  I think Petersen knew that he had run out of time and the budget was already too big, so the ending was forced to suffer.  This ultimately hurt the film more than helped it giving it that sensation of a two-week science project done the night before.  I felt sorry for those involved with this droopy ending.To be honest, you had a very powerful story here that failed due to corporate Hollywood deciding to cast big names to fill the parts and place more emphasis on who was going to get the most screen time instead of story.  The actors hurt this film more than most will imagine because they just never fully represented the power of Homer's work.  I would have never imagined seeing Brad Pitt fighting along in Greek/Trojan times, and even after seeing this film I still cannot.  Brian Cox, normally fascinating in every film he does, just fell flat on his face in this film with the yelping of British words during this era.  It didn't fit causing the epic to quickly transform into nothing for that another summer blockbuster.  The story didn't help much either, forcing us to desperately want to get back into our High School Latin class to relive the truth of the story one last time.SEMPER UBI SUB UBI!!!Grade: *** out of

851963,A2ELP13J2HSGJQ,B0002Z0EXQ,AJ Denny,"[2, 3]","Troy is neither a faithful retelling of the Iliad, the epic Homeric poem it was inspired by, nor a Hollywood computer generated sword and sandal film hoping to cash in on the popularity of Gladiator. Instead Troy is the timeless story of people caught up by the ravages of war.The film begins at the end of a long war of unification by Mycenaean King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) of the proto-Greek city-states. In history the Mycenaeans were recent barbarian conquerors of Greece, and we get a hint of this especially in Cox's portrayal of Agamemnon. He is in turns arrogant, playful and greedy. The only Mycenaean king we see who is tries to rule well is Odysseus (Sean Bean).From the battle scene at the beginning of the film, it is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who grabs your attention. He is brooding, arrogant and thinks his immortality will be to be known as the greatest warrior in history. This is an interesting contrast to Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana). Hector is a veteran professional soldier, not a warrior. He wants nothing more but to end the war, and protect his people.The war in which he finds this immortality is started with Prince of Troy Paris (Orlando Bloom) encourages Queen Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to run off with him, at the end of a treaty negotiation with her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Both come across as sympathetic, guilt ridden and fully aware of the disaster they have caused.Menelaus quickly goes to Agamemnon, his brother, for help to get Helen back. Agamemnon is more interested in taking Troy, a city astride the Dardanelle's (close to Gallipoli), and blocking his access to wheat grown in what is now the Ukraine.The fight scenes take place the beach in front of the city, and eventually inside it. Most of them are done with CGI, though at times the movie can look like an animation from the PC game Age of Empires. But on the ground, they are bloody and full of frenetic energy. Pitt's Achilles fights ability, speed and strength. His cold blue-eyed stare says more then any words he may speak during the film.When he does talk, for most of the film it is to noble slave girl Briseis (Rose Byrne). Around her he visibly softens (and hardens again, but that comes later on). Until Hector kills his cousin Patroclus, in his armour, Achilles is all set to take Briseis, and sail away forever.Director Wolfgang Petersen made his name with the 1981 German film Das Boot (the Boat). Troy has a similar somber feel to it. Rather then filling his movie with typecast heroes and villains, his characters become people who are dealing with circumstances beyond their control. War is the only evil in Troy, and the only people we see are its victims.",4,A Sword and Sandal Metaphor for the War on Terror,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2685,"['Troy', 'faithful', 'retelling', 'Iliad', 'epic', 'Homeric', 'poem', 'was', 'inspired', 'Hollywood', 'computer', 'generated', 'sword', 'sandal', 'film', 'hoping', 'cash', 'popularity', 'Gladiator', 'Instead', 'Troy', 'timeless', 'story', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'ravages', 'war.The', 'film', 'end', 'long', 'war', 'unification', 'Mycenaean', 'King', 'Agamemnon', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'proto-Greek', 'city-states', 'history', 'Mycenaeans', 'were', 'recent', 'barbarian', 'conquerors', 'Greece', 'get', 'hint', 'especially', 'Cox', 'portrayal', 'Agamemnon', 'turns', 'arrogant', 'playful', 'greedy', 'only', 'Mycenaean', 'king', 'see', 'who', 'tries', 'rule', 'well', 'Odysseus', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'battle', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'grabs', 'attention', 'brooding', 'arrogant', 'immortality', 'will', 'be', 'be', 'known', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'history', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Trojan', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'veteran', 'professional', 'soldier', 'not', 'warrior', 'nothing', 'more', 'end', 'war', 'protect', 'people.The', 'war', 'immortality', 'started', 'Prince', 'Troy', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'run', 'off', 'end', 'treaty', 'negotiation', 'husband', 'Menelaus', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'come', 'sympathetic', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'fully', 'aware', 'disaster', 'have', 'caused.Menelaus', 'quickly', 'Agamemnon', 'brother', 'help', 'get', 'Helen', 'back', 'Agamemnon', 'more', 'interested', 'taking', 'Troy', 'city', 'Dardanelle', 'close', 'Gallipoli', 'blocking', 'access', 'wheat', 'grown', 'what', 'now', 'Ukraine.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'beach', 'front', 'city', 'eventually', 'Most', 'are', 'done', 'CGI', 'though', 'times', 'movie', 'can', 'look', 'animation', 'PC', 'game', 'Age', 'Empires', 'ground', 'are', 'bloody', 'full', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'fights', 'ability', 'speed', 'strength', 'cold', 'blue-eyed', 'stare', 'more', 'then', 'words', 'may', 'speak', 'film.When', 'talk', 'most', 'film', 'noble', 'slave', 'girl', 'Briseis', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'visibly', 'again', 'later', 'Hector', 'cousin', 'Patroclus', 'armour', 'Achilles', 'set', 'take', 'Briseis', 'sail', 'away', 'forever.Director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'made', 'name', '1981', 'German', 'film', 'Das', 'Boot', 'Boat', 'Troy', 'similar', 'somber', 'feel', 'then', 'filling', 'movie', 'typecast', 'heroes', 'villains', 'characters', 'become', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'circumstances', 'control', 'War', 'only', 'evil', 'Troy', 'only', 'people', 'see', 'are', 'victims']",N/A

851966,AFEU1F4TXQWKL,B0002Z0EXQ,Alan V. Dunkin,"[3, 7]","The story of the incomparable (to mortals anyway) Greek beauty Helen, the siege of Troy, and the ""Trojan"" Horse is the stuff of epic legend, told and retold orally and in prose over thousands of years. Homer's two poems, The Illiad and The Odyssey, are perhaps the most famous of these retellings. Recent attempts to adapt these and other works to film usually fall short for one reason or another, and director Wolfgang Petersen's most recent effort, Troy, unfortunately is no exception.After a brief graphic introduction and voice-over (by Odysseus, played by Sean Bean), Agamemnon (Brian Cox) and Achilles (Brad Pitt) are brought to the fore; the former, a power-hungry and ruthless King, and the latter a powerful warrior in Agamemnon's army seemingly sick of war yet fascinated by his own glory. After Achilles easily dispatches the Thessalyian champion and winning the war, the scene shifts to Sparta, home of Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), where a peace treaty is being signed with Troy, a powerful city-state across the Aegean in current in Asia Minor. Representing Troy are Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) - during the celebration Paris slips away to sleep with Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger).Helen has little love for Menelaus and the two lovers decide to steal away on Paris' ship bound for Troy the next day. Menelaus, slightly perturbed, visits Agamemnon to ask his brother to support him in going to war with Troy, for Menelaus' honor if nothing else. Agamemnon, seeing the advantages of a fallen Troy and the growth of his own empire, gleefully accepts, and enlists Odysseus' help in bringing the disinterested Achilles to his cause. The Trojans accept Helen, but soon realize that war is on its way: a thousand Greek ships appear over the horizon.Troy can be many things to many people, but most would be disappointed in one way or another. Those looking for a visual realization of Homer's epic poems will see that very little made it to the screen, nor is the movie completely based on just Homer. The Trojan Horse itself isn't even in The Illiad. While some of the characters are highly religious, the godly figures of Greek mythology never make an appearance (unlike the stories). According to legend, the siege lasted some ten years - in the movie, it didn't even last two weeks. Varying characters die when they shouldn't, and live when they should have died.Many of the motivations, subterfuges, and plots by characters are either simplified or disregarded for the movie. Achilles' motivation seems to be an attempt to reach ever-higher pillars of fame and glory, until his encounter with the Priestess of Apollo (and thereafter slave) Briseis (Rose Byrne), at which point he barely wants to do anything. Agamemnon is a bloodthirsty tyrant, Menelaus a heartless killer, and Paris a cowardly sop. Hector is the wonderfully portrayed reluctant defender of Troy with the specter of death hanging over him, while Odysseus is the great survivor, thinker, and trickster. The latter two essentially are the only likeable characters throughout.Characters continually tell each other how this will be a war that will go down in history and be the stuff of legends, but their actions (except for Achilles going in the first place) disagree. The source material contains all these great characters and motivations, yet they mostly remain wooden and forgotten.For a movie that stretches beyond two and a half hours, Troy is barely even a movie about battles. There is one major battle, two minor ones, and really five duels, one lasting all of about five seconds. While the legends concentrate on the heroic deeds of warriors and individualistic combat, you see very little of that outside of the duels, and sometimes not even then. While the spectacle of the one singular immense battle is amazing, it very nearly serves little purpose except to kill two characters and show that Agamemnon wasn't a very good general - and maybe that he really did need Achilles (who sat it out). The other battles aren't really battles at all, just one side getting beat up at the expense of the other.Which is not to say the battles aren't impressive - the duels and struggles are wonderfully filmed and occasionally gory. Yes, the landing sequence does remind the viewer of Omaha Beach ala Saving Private Ryan, and there's a little too much shaky-cam going on. Hector vs. Achilles, however, is simply fantastic.Petersen, who directed the greatest submarine film of all time, Das Boot, the schmaltzy Air Force One, and the drowning tour de force The Perfect Storm, is off and on in Troy. Some scenes are wonderfully crafted, others are just sloppy. The battle sequences look great, the scenes where he cuts to character reactions seem really off. The script is weak in parts, as is the acting (Orlando Bloom in particular) - James Horner's quickly rushed score is horrific. Nice to see such a great ensemble cast (including Julie Christie, Peter O'Toole, Nigel Terry, Trevor Eve, Saffron Burrows and Julian Glover).It's hard to recommend Troy, because it's so uneven. Aside from the few shots of the naked flanks of a muscular, tanned Brad Pitt, even the screaming throngs of women may be disappointed. When you consider that the movie could have been so much better, if they had kept the characters and motivations a little more down to earth, if they had made the siege an epic struggle rather than a big battle and a wooden horse, than Troy could have been a much better movie. As it stands currently it's merely passable.",3,Troy - Movie Review,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,5565,"['story', 'incomparable', 'mortals', 'anyway', 'Greek', 'beauty', 'Helen', 'siege', 'Troy',

That kept in mind, this massive film has spectacle and beauty, and the feel and often the look of the great sword and sandal epics of the 1950s. Filmed in Mexico and Malta, the cinematography is a feast for the eyes, and there is wonderful detail in some of the lavish costuming and art direction. The romantic aspects of the story have been thankfully minimized, and the film focuses on the courage and heroism, as well as the lust for power and carnage of war.There are many excellent performances throughout, and I especially enjoy Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus. Orlando Bloom is good as Paris, as are Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Rose Byrne as Briseis, Vincent Regan as Eudorus, and a short but lovely appearance by Julie Christie as Achilles' mother, Thetis. Brad Pitt looks like a golden god and is believable as the larger than life Achilles, and is fantastic in the fight scenes. The brilliantly choreographed battle between Achilles and Hector is memorable, and has to be one of the best mano a mano action sequences in film history.Some of the loveliest music written today is for film, and James Horner has outdone himself in ""Troy,"" with the gorgeous song ""Remember Me,"" sung by Josh Groban, and the atmospheric voices of Tanja Tzarovska and Desislava Stefanova woven throughout the score. Wolfgang Peterson's sweeping direction, the cinematography of Paul Bond and Roger Pratt, and the script by David Benioff make this satisfying, and often riveting viewing, and it's a film that should be seen multiple times to fully appreciate.

851969,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B0002Z0EXQ,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[3, 7]","I admire the courage of Wolfgang Petersen. Making ""Troy"" was bound to be controversial. The big question was how much of Homers work do you actually use? Petersen has never shied away from diffcult films, think about Das Boot - in my opinion the best submarine film ever made. Troy was doubtless his greatest challenge.The result was a compromise of sorts. The history of the Trojan war will likely never be fully known. The work of Schliemann is certainly controversial still and no where near universally accepted my modern historians.Petersen, I think did the right thing by keeping the gods directly out of it, other than the characters beliefs and fealties or contempt to or for the gods. Petersen tried to make a historical film based on one version of the history of Troy and probably the most interesting of the interpretations.Like many here I have read and enjoyed the classics of Homer, and have read several translations of both works. Petersen seemed to take some of the most realsitic sounding elements and wove them into an epic film.Casting was inspired and brilliant despite my initial skepticism about Pitt's role as Achilles I was pleasantly suprised at his skill in bringing the character to life.The best in my opinion was Eric Bana's potrayal of Hector. I had always beleived Hector to be the honorable hero that this film brought to the part and from now on I will never again be able to read The Iliad without picturing Bana as Hector. Bravo!As always Peter O'Toole brings class and sophistication to any role and he brought King Priam to life for me. That scene in the tent with Achilles was in my opinion was an Acadamy Award grade performance.I thought Sean Bean played too much the nice guy as Odysseus, but overall I would like to see him in a Wolfgang Petersen version of The Odyssey. Brian Cox nearly stole the show as Agamemnon and performed equally to Pitt's Achilles.The women were all marvelous especially Saffron Burrows as Andromache and Rose Byrne playing Briseis.Writing was excellent and there are way too many excellent lines to mention but one of my favorites was the scene with Agamemnon and Achilles:Agamemnon: A great victory was won today, but that victory  was not yours. Kings do not kneel to Achilles. Kings do not pay homage to Achilles.Achilles: Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see: the soldiers won the battle.Agamemnon: History remembers KINGS, not soldiers!

UGH!). I finally got to see it. My verdict: Good, not Great.However, what it did do is spur me on to rent some of Brad Pitt's other movies. WOW. I just moved him from my eye-candy list to my outstanding actors list. GREAT!I digress---Pitt actually does ok in Troy. Unfortunately this film had so much more potential. I do not think we will be hearing much about Troy come Oscar time (not in the major categories at least). That's a shame because, as far as source material, what could be better?Eric Bana is spectacular. Peter O'Toole is amazing. Orly--well he does well enough but quite honestly some of those wierd facial expressions irritate. He's young though--he has potential.I didn't think much of any of the women in this movie. The actress who played Helen was especially flat. Hector's wife was o.k. and Achilles love interest was good. The story was ok. The battle scences were exceptionally well done (and get my highest nod). The score was ok.I guess that about sums it up. It was OK. I am spoiled by LOTR as Peter Jackson (THE MASTER) just blew me away. Troy just never really gets there emotionally for you. You watch the characters but you don't really feel for them with a few notable exceptions: Hektor and Achilles fight scence was superb and Priam and Achille's conversation had me in tears I was so touched. Yet overall my emotional level remained pretty constant.I do not think this movie can really be compared with Braveheart or Gladiator but its a good movie and worth a cinema visit to see it on the big screen.

851981,A2D5IK2Q2P355K,B0002Z0EXQ,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","After watching ""Troy"" last night, I had mixed feelings at best.  I had been looking forward to this latest adaptation of Homer's great epic for the last couple of years.  ""The Iliad"" has been my favorite book since I was a kid - I've read several translations over the years, and have also read Homer's ""The Odyssey"", Virgil's ""The Aeneid"", Quintus of Smyrna's ""The Fall of Troy"", Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon"", ""The Libation Bearers"" and ""The Euminides"", Sophocles' ""Ajax"", and Euripides' ""Iphigenia in Aulis"", ""Hecuba"", ""The Trojan Women"" and ""Andromache"" for good measure.  These books (along with the now-lost ""Cypria"", ""Ileupersis"", the ""Little Iliad"" and the ""Nostoi"" of which we only have fragments) provide the complete back-story to the decade-long Trojan War.  Finally getting to see a big screen adaptation (with Brad Pitt as Achilles and Aussie hunk Eric Bana as Hector, no less) was certainly an exciting prospect.  The last big screen adaptation of ""The Iliad"" was made in the 1956 (""Helen of Troy"") and centred on the characters of Paris and Helen, beautifully portrayed by Jacques Sernas and Rosanna Podesta.  The more recent 2003 TV mini-series adaptation, likewise called ""Helen of Troy"", also focused on Paris and Helen.  Both were serviceable, though I disliked the latter version for the number of unforgivable liberties it took with the story of the Trojan War, like having a BALD Vin Diesel wannabe portray a savage, cowardly and irredeemable Achilles.  Unfortunately, ""Troy"" is typical Hollywood - all pomp and circumstance, blood and gore, with little heart or emotional resonance.  ""Troy"" is certainly mixed bag.  It is entertaining - there are enough blood and gore to satisfy the blokes and plenty of hunky male flesh to satisfy the ladies.  The battle scenes are fantastic, and the climatic fight scene between Brad Pitt's Achilles and Eric Bana's Hector is heart-stopping stuff.  If you haven't read Homer, you would probably enjoy it.  But if you are a Homer fan, you would probably squirm at the liberties taken with Homer's great epic.  And now, for my gripes.  There are spoilers ahead, so do not read further if you do not want to know any major plot points in the movie.1. One of my biggest gripes is the tampering done with Homer's sublime scene in which King Priam of Troy begs Achilles for the body of his son, Prince Hector.  In Homer's original, King Priam softens Achilles' heart by comparing himself to Achilles' father, King Peleus of Phtia.  Both were once great and noble warriors - both are now old and defenseless men who rely on their sons for love, hope, security and protection.  But while King Peleus still has hope that Achilles will return from war one day, King Priam is devoid of hope since his most beloved son and heir is dead.  And King Priam has endured what no other man has ever done - kissed the hands of the man who killed so many of his sons.  In Homer, it was this appeal to Achilles' feelings for his own father that softens the great warrior's heart.  In ""Troy"" however, Achilles' father is supposedly long dead by then, which renders that whole pivotal scene senseless.2. The Trojan War was supposed to have lasted for TEN long gruelling years.  Homer's epic actually covers only several weeks during the ninth year of the war.  ""The Iliad"" ends with Hector's funeral, and it is actually other works like ""The Odyssey"", ""The Aeneid"" and ""The Fall of Troy"" that go on to provide the details of how Troy lost the war.  And yet ""Troy"" resolved the entire war in a matter of days.3.  Prince Paris gives the ""Sword of Troy"" to the first Trojan refugee he finds?  He entrusts the future hope for the Trojan race to an unknown stranger?  In the ancient epics, far from being an anonymous refugee, Aeneas is Troy's second best warrior.  It is he who fights at the forefront of war with Hector most of the time.  It is he who would go on to revive the lot of Trojans by setting up a new colony for the refugees that would later become Rome.4.  In the ancient epics, Patroclus and Achilles grew up together (Patroclus is actually the ELDER cousin) - they were inseparable and were the best of friends.  They were probably even lovers (Homer was rather coy about this although the hints are all over the place, and being bisexual was not unusual amongst Greek warriors), which was why the full wrath of Achilles was only unleashed when Hector killed Patroclus.  Patroclus pretended to be Achilles in a heroic and desperate bid to fool the Trojans into retreating from the burning Greek ships.  In ""Troy"", Patroclus was a naive younger cousin who died because he foolishly disobeyed orders.  Short of being a completely unmitigated savage, there would have been no reason for Achilles to behave like a beast in desecrating Hector's body.5.  Where is Cassandra and her dire warnings about Greeks bearing gifts?  Where is Queen Hecuba?6.  The Agamemnon in ""Troy"" is a caricature - the ultimate cruel, corrupt and amoral politician.  There is no hint of that most painful of sacrifices that Agamemnon has to make to embark on his war - that very sacrifice that turned him from being merely a greedy and ambitious politician to being such a deadly and almost insane enemy to all things Trojan.  The sacrifice of Iphigenia, seen so powerfully in 2003's ""Helen of Troy"", should have been in this movie.  As should have been Agamemnon's ultimate fate in the hands of HIS OWN WIFE, not Briseis.The one bright spot in ""Troy"" is Sean Bean's Odysseus.  He's the one character that seems most consistent with how Homer himself would have wanted him portrayed.  Sigh ... if I could have my wish, I would take the best elements of all three versions of the Trojan War made so far (""Helen of Troy"" 1956, ""Helen of Troy"" 2003 and ""Troy"" 2004) and combine them into one movie.  By all means, watch this movie if you like the swords and sandals genre.  But don't go in expecting a faithful adaptation of ""The Iliad"".",3,Another missed opportunity.,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,5948,"['watching', 'Troy', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings',

851983,A3ROE64EVHDTTV,B0002Z0EXQ,"AMP ""Al""","[13, 16]","Blu-Ray review.  If you are reading this for the DVD copy, this information may not be accurate.Film:  4/5, Image Quality:  5/5, Audio Quality:  4.5/5, Extras:  3/5, Overall:  4/5Quality:This Blu-Ray is like a gift from the gods.  The picture quality is supremely colorful, vibrant, clean, and has excellent sharpness and detail.  Sound quality is uncompressed, and it is really clear and clean, but I did have to turn the volume up quite a bit more than usual; it seems rather subdued.  Some parts also seemed a bit muffled; possibly due to source issues from reinserted footage.This Blu-Ray disc presents the extended Director's Cut, which is nearly 200 minutes long and contains a lot of interesting new footage that's perfectly interwoven in the movie itself.  The disc also contains a number of featurettes and a trailer.Film:Personally, I am not familiar with the original story for the battle of Troy, so I can't comment on how historically/mythically/culturally accurate this movie really is.  Whether it's fully embellished or not, it is a rather fun and timeless story; it is only appropriate that Hollywood should someday film it with such a high production cost and a full list of A-list actors.This is such a film; a slick and stylish production with plenty of large-scale set-pieces, exotic-looking locations, huge battles and fight scenes, ambitious CGI effects, and a smidgeon of classic romance.  The talents of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and even Peter O'Toole are all dispensed here.  Watching ""Troy"" is about as rewarding of an experience as the long list of other Hollywood epics (such as ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" or ""300""), for better or for worse.The best part about this film is that it is tremendously entertaining.  Whether watching the original two-hour theatrical cut or the rather sublime three-hour director's cut, the film is tightly paced and hardly ever dull.  Battle scenes are spectacular and often times bloody.  Individual fight scenes are pretty swell too.  The CGI work is a little fake-looking, but still well-realized and quite slick to look at.  Outside of the battles, the film is quite pretty to look at, with so many unique settings and solid camera work.The most negative aspects about this film would likely be reserved for the pickiest of viewers.  Despite the film's quality production, it is not even comparable to the most highly-rated epics in this genre; movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" can easily out-match ""Troy."" After all, ""Troy"" does not have the same quality writing and acting, much less the same thematic prowess or emotional power.  It is certainly not as immersive, deep, or insightful.In the end, ""Troy"" is a polished and entertaining film.  It comes recommended to most casual audiences, but those looking for full artistic valor can do better.4/5 (entertainment:  4/5, story:  4/5, film:  4/5)",4,"""Let them say that I walked with giants.""",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2891,"['Blu-Ray', 'review', 'are', 'reading', 'DVD', 'copy', 'information', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accurate.Film', '4/5', 'Image', 'Quality', '5/5', 'Audio', 'Quality', '4.5/5', 'Extras', '3/5', 'Overall', '4/5Quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'gift', 'gods', 'picture', 'quality', 'supremely', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'clean', 'excellent', 'sharpness', 'detail', 'Sound', 'quality', 'uncompressed', 'really', 'clear', 'clean', 'did', 'have', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'usual', 'rather', 'subdued', 'parts', 'also', 'seemed', 'bit', 'muffled', 'possibly', 'due', 'source', 'issues', 'reinserted', 'footage.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'extended', 'Director', 'Cut', 'nearly', '200', 'minutes', 'long', 'lot', 'interesting', 'new', 'footage', 'perfectly', 'interwoven', 'movie', 'disc', 'also', 'number', 'featurettes', 'trailer.Film', 'Personally', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'story', 'battle', 'Troy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'how', 'historically/mythically/culturally', 'accurate', 'movie', 'really', 'fully', 'embellished', 'not', 'rather', 'fun', 'timeless', 'story', 'only', 'appropriate', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'someday', 'film', 'high', 'production', 'cost', 'full', 'list', 'A-list', 'actors.This', 'such', 'film', 'slick', 'stylish', 'production', 'plenty', 'large-scale', 'set-pieces', 'exotic-looking', 'locations', 'huge', 'battles', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ambitious', 'CGI', 'effects', 'smidgeon', 'classic', 'romance', 'talents', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'even', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'are', 'dispensed', 'here', 'Watching', 'Troy', 'about', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'long', 'list', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'such', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', '300', 'better', 'worse.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'original', 'two-hour', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'rather', 'sublime', 'three-hour', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'tightly', 'paced', 'hardly', 'ever', 'dull', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'often', 'times', 'bloody', 'Individual', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'swell', 'too', 'CGI', 'work', 'little', 'fake-looking', 'still', 'well-realized', 'quite', 'slick', 'look', 'battles', 'film', 'quite', 'pretty', 'look', 'so', 'many', 'unique', 'settings', 'solid', 'camera', 'most', 'negative', 'aspects', 'film', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'reserved', 'pickiest', 'viewers', 'film', 'quality', 'production', 'not', 'even', 'comparable', 'most', 'highly-rated', 'epics', 'genre', 'movies', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'can', 'easily', 'out-match', 'Troy', 'Troy', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'much', 'less', 'same', 'thematic', 'prowess', 'emotional', 'power', 'certainly', 'not', 'immersive', 'deep', 'insightful.In', 'end', 'Troy', 'polished', 'entertaining', 'film', 'recommended', 'most', 'casual', 'audiences', 'looking', 'full', 'artistic', 'valor', 'can', 'do', 'better.4/5', 'entertainment', '4/5', 'story', '4/5', 'film', '4/5']",N/A

I became immediately alarmed at the slow beginning, and while I was entertained for the majority of the movie, something wasn't quite right and I didn't know what it was until the end.  WHERE was the MEAT of the STORY?  Sure, it was ""explained"" nicely, but I felt incredibly ripped off from the minimal portrayal of Helen of Troy and the CRITICAL role she played.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are no gods in this film... they are mentioned and briefly shown in statues, but there are no live characters-- dissapointing.That aside, there was some *excellent* battle scenes that I've been hungry for in a non-LOTR setting for a change.  Also, there was some really good acting from the supporting roles which really carried this film through.I normally would avoid comparing this to similiar films of this vein, however, the background music is so similar to that of Gladiator (which can take the Pepsi Challenge with this movie any ol' day of the week) I found myself reflecting back on Gladiator and feeling that Troy was a lesser film.

851985,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0002Z0EXQ,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[2, 5]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***When I first saw the preview, I thought ""What a fantastic idea!"" movies about Ancient Greece seemed rare to me (not being a fanatic, or knowing of the older movies)I knew once the movie was over that it was very poor... and it took me a few more viewings to realize how horrible it was.First off, the music is all middle-eastern sounding. I realize Troy is in western Asia-ish (like around ancient Pergamum and such) and such, but come one, this music sounded like a day in the deserts of Arabia. More suited for Kingdom of Heaven or Hidalgo.Historical accuracy?  You'd find a fair share more in something like Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven (not to bash the films, simply pointing out that they aren't very accurate). Agammemnon and Menelaus are portrayed as fat greedy villains interested only in themselves, the Trojans portrayed as noblemen and upright in every way (even Paris, who in mythology, was sly as a fox), and Achilles as a moody drama queen! He's stubborn and arrogant and stuck-up and very very rude, like when he told that poor boy in Thessalonica, ""That's why no one will remember your name"" when the boy said he was afraid of the Thessalonican warrior sent to fight Achilles.The battle which was supposed to be 10 years, seemed to last less than a month, with most of that time being the 12 days they gave peace for Hector's death! In the entire movie, none of the characters change in appearance---Peter O'Toole's Priam looks on the verge of death, without any change, Agammemnon doesn't gray, no one changes in what is supposed to be 10 years, and the way the movie passes makes it seem like each passing day is just that; one passing day. Agammemnon and Menelaus survive in mythology, yet both die in this movie, probably because they were the ""bad guys"" in the film.This is a big one: Mythology. This movie seems to spit in the face of mythology, use Homer's book pages as toilet paper, and then throw up venom on the sheer ""coolness"" of the legend of Troy. The legend of Achilles being immortal and his only weakness being his heel is sneered at, when Paris shoots Achilles through the heel, we think ""WOW! the legend! His heel is his only weak spot!"" hence the term ""Achilles Heel"" meaning our greatest weakness...Then Achilles gets shot five times in the chest. So to the average viewer, who knows nothing about Achilles's legend, what do you think kills Achilles, a shot in the heel, or five shots in the chest?That plus the callous way in which the director--through characters like Hector and Achilles and such--seem to treat the Gods like crap, and doesn't portray their influence at all, as opposed to say ""Alexander"", which gives the Gods a light, dubious touch, such as showing hints of Zeus watching over him (the Eagle). The Trojans constantly claim the Gods are on their side, and the pompous way in which they say it seems to make you envision the director going ""Pfft, what idiots! believing in the Gods of their time, HAH! Jesus Christ our lord and savior is the only God and THEY should've known that! So they die for their heresy! DIE DIE DIE!""Another big problem is something that also messed up the game Warcraft III. It is TOO HERO-BASED. In the movie, so much emphasis is placed on heroes like Achilles and Hector, that the armies pretty much play absolutely no role at all in the movie! It doesn't matter that the Greeks outnumber the Trojans 2 or 3 to 1, they absolutely can't win without Achilles!!! It doesn't matter that the Trojans are defended by epic walls and the best archers in the world, they can't win without Hector!!!All in all, a very poor put-together movie, with a kind of stubborn negative and childish mentality towards the ways, beliefs, and customs of the times, pretty much re-writing the legend of Troy to make it more marketable to audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot. The acting is wooden, and hearing Achilles whine and sass like a snotty teenage girl just irritates.  The characters are portrayed all wrong, the Gods and the Myths aren't just ignored---they're subtly cursed and treaded and stomped in the mud.The legend was torn open, the parts the director liked picked apart, and made more Hollywood-friendly for the money.",1,Terrible film.. only given a star because it looks like it cost some money,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,4351,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***When', 'first', 'saw', 'preview', 'thought', 'What', 'fantastic', 'idea', 'movies', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'seemed', 'rare', 'not', 'being', 'fanatic', 'knowing', 'older', 'movies', 'knew', 'once', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'took', 'few', 'more', 'viewings', 'realize', 'how', 'horrible', 'was.First', 'off', 'music', 'middle-eastern', 'sounding', 'realize', 'Troy', 'western', 'Asia-ish', 'ancient', 'Pergamum', 'such', 'such', 'come', 'one', 'music', 'sounded', 'day', 'deserts', 'Arabia', 'More', 'suited', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Hidalgo.Historical', 'accuracy', ""'d"", 'find', 'fair', 'share', 'more', 'something', 'Gladiator', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'not', 'bash', 'films', 'simply', 'pointing', 'out', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'accurate', 'Agammemnon', 'Menelaus', 'are', 'portrayed', 'fat', 'greedy', 'villains', 'interested', 'only', 'Trojans', 'portrayed', 'noblemen', 'upright', 'way', 'even', 'Paris', 'who', 'mythology', 'was', 'sly', 'fox', 'Achilles', 'moody', 'drama', 'queen', 'stubborn', 'arrogant', 'stuck-up', 'very', 'very', 'rude', 'when', 'told', 'poor', 'boy', 'Thessalonica', 'why', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'name', 'when', 'boy', 'said', 'was', 'afraid', 'Thessalonican', 'sent', 'fight', 'Achilles.The', 'battle', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '10', 'years', 'seemed', 'last', 'less', 'month', 'most', 'time', 'being', '12', 'days', 'gave', 'peace', 'Hector', 'death', 'entire', 'movie', 'none', 'characters', 'change', 'appearance', '-Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'verge', 'death', 'change', 'Agammemnon', ""n't"", 'gray', 'one', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', '10', 'years', 'way', 'movie', 'seem', 'passing', 'day', 'just', 'one', 'passing', 'day', 'Agammemnon', 'Menelaus', 'survive', 'mythology', 'yet', 'die', 'movie', 'probably', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'film.This', 'big', 'one', 'Mythology', 'movie', 'spit', 'face', 'mythology', 'use', 'Homer', 'book', 'pages', 'toilet', 'paper', 'then', 'throw', 'up', 'venom', 'sheer', 'coolness', 'legend', 'Troy', 'legend', 'Achilles', 'being', 'immortal', 'only', 'weakness', 'being', 'heel', 'sneered', 'when', 'Paris', 'shoots', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'think', 'WOW', 'legend', 'heel', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'hence', 'term', 'Achilles', 'Heel', 'meaning', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'Then', 'Achilles', 'shot', 'five', 'times', 'chest', 'So', 'average', 'viewer', 'who', 'nothing', 'Achilles', 'legend', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'kills', 'Achilles', 'shot', 'heel', 'five', 'shots', 'chest', 'callous', 'way', 'director', 'characters', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'such', 'seem', 'treat', 'Gods', 'crap', ""n't"", 'portray', 'influence', 'opposed', 'say', 'Alexander', 'Gods', 'light', 'dubious', 'touch', 'such', 'showing', 'hints', 'Zeus', 'watching', 'Eagle', 'Trojans', 'constantly', 'claim', 'Gods', 'are', 'side', 'pompous', 'way', 'say', 'make', 'envision', 'director', 'going', 'Pfft', 'what', 'believing', 'Gods', 'time', 'HAH', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'lord', 'savior', 'only', 'God', 'THEY', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'die', 'heresy', 'DIE', 'DIE', 'DIE', 'big', 'problem', 'something', 'also', 'messed', 'up', 'game', 'Warcraft', 'III', 'TOO', 'HERO-BASED', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'heroes', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'armies', 'pretty', 'much', 'play', 'absolutely', 'role', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Greeks', 'outnumber', 'Trojans', '2', '3', '1', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'Achilles', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Trojans', 'are', 'defended', 'epic', 'walls', 'best', 'archers', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'Hector', 'very', 'poor', 'put-together', 'movie', 'kind', 'stubborn', 'negative', 'childish', 'mentality', 'ways', 'beliefs', 'customs', 'times', 'pretty', 'much', 're-writing', 'legend', 'Troy', 'make', 'more', 'marketable', 'audiences', 'who', 'want', 'gawk', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'naked', 'yes', 'naked', 'several', 'times', 'real', 'reason', 'amount', 'men', 'can', 'cram', 'one', 'shot', 'acting', 'wooden', 'hearing', 'Achilles', 'whine', 'sass', 'snotty', 'teenage', 'girl', 'just', 'irritates', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'wrong', 'Gods', 'Myths', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'ignored', '-they', ""'re"", 'subtly', 'cursed', 'treaded', 'stomped', 'mud.The', 'legend', 'was', 'torn', 'open', 'parts', 'director', 'liked', 'picked', 'apart', 'made', 'more', 'Hollywood-friendly', 'money']",N/A

The film's changes make for a more ""neat and tidy"" resolution - but more empty in the themes Homer was trying (at least I think) to express.The Iliad's gut wrenching tragedy and drama is what has kept it alive for 2700+ years. Though definitely a feast for the eyes - this film left my mind stirring - ""all this for what?""(Spoilers - Warning)The characters I felt the most were Hector and Priam. Pitt's Achillies was 90% there - but a bit too much sulking and brooding. His sudden sympathetic turn at the end also contrasted to sharply and quickly with his more hardened and faithful Achillies rendering through most of the film.Agamemnon - over the top; guess Hollywood felt they needed a real ""badie,"" and had to give the audience the standard ""bad guy gets it in the end"" ending, having one of the heroines kill him.Orlando Bloom - Paris the ""ueberwimp""And then there's the whitewashed ending with everyone escaping Troy (Paris, Helen, Hector's wife and baby).The film is essentially a new story, very loosely based on classic characters.

851989,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002Z0EXQ,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 3]","Homer's ""The Illiad"" is one of literature's greatest war stories.  It begins with a contest among the gods, which the Trojan prince Paris (played by Orlando Bloom in the film) is chosen to decide.  The three goddesses each promise him something if he selects them, and Aphrodite, the goddess of Love, makes him an offer he can't refuse: Queen Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), the most beautiful woman in the Aegean.  So Paris kidnaps Helen, which prompts her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) to call upon the other Greek kings who opted for her hand in marriage.  You see, when nearly every Greek king wanted to marry Helen, including Agammemnon (Brian Cox), and Odyseus (Sean Bean), Odyseus came up with a plan: there would be a kind of trial to win Helen, and then the losers would band together against any enemy if said enemy ever tried to steal Helen from the winner.  Well, the kings followed the plan, and they sailed to Troy in order to get her back.  A 10-year war followed, with the main figures being Achilles (Brad Pitt) on the side of the Greeks, and Hector (Eric Bana) on the side of the Trojans.Ok, for the most part, that did not happen in the movie.  I'm not sure if it was the writer or the director, Wolfgang Peterson, who chose to do this, but the gods, who played a pivotal role in the Trojan War, were all but eliminated from the story.  Anyway, the movie gets started as Menelaus is treating his guests, the Trojan princes Hector and Paris, to a peace dinner.  Troy is one of the few, and definitely the most powerful, states that is not under Greek rule, which angers Menelaus' brother Agammemnon, who wants to rule the Aegean Sea.  Throughout this stay, Paris and Helen have been having an affair, and Paris convinces her to come home with him, and she consents.  This angers Menelaus so much that he goes to his brother, asking for help in ""getting her back"".  Agammemnon uses this as an excuse to go to war with Troy, and he assembles an army of 50,000 Greeks to fight Troy.  Odyseus and Achilles are two of the leaders enlisted to fight, but Agammemnon is weary of Achilles, for the two detest each other.  When Agammemnon steals one of Achilles' girls that he captured, Achilles decides to stop fighting and watch the Greeks get slaughtered.  It takes the death of his cousin Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) by Hector to get him back into the war.I have to say that I liked this movie.  It was very riveting and very entertaining.  However, since I have such an extensive knowledge of Greek Mythology, I noticed many discrepancies that bugged me a little bit.  It mainly had to do with the deaths; some people died before they were supposed to, while others died after.  Also, some of the characters' motives were obscured.  I'm not completely sure about this, but I think the whole thing about Agammemnon being some war-hungry was a crack at President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq.  Agamemmnon was a pig, but he went to war for Helen, not land.Oh well, what are you going to do.  Achilles, Hector, and Odyseus were right on the mark.  The actors who played them did very good jobs playing them, and their attributes and morals were not obscured.  I did think that Odyseus was a bit underused, and he kind of sold himself short at the end, but it kind of set things up for The Odysey, Homer's other great epic, though I doubt it will be made with this crew.  They also set up Virgil's The Aeneid, as Paris handed the Sword of Troy over to Aeneis (Frankie Fitzgerald) in order to find a new home.My last word: go see this movie.  You will have a good time.  But if you are a Greek myth fan like myself, try not to pay too much attention to the ""liberties"" that were taken.",4,"Good Movie, But Too Many ""Liberties"" Were Taken",1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,3703,"['Homer', 'Illiad', 'one', 'literature', 'greatest', 'war', 'stories', 'contest', 'gods', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Paris', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'film', 'chosen', 'decide', 'three', 'goddesses', 'promise', 'something', 'Aphrodite', 'goddess', 'Love', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Aegean', 'So', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'husband', 'Menelaus', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'call', 'other', 'Greek', 'kings', 'who', 'opted', 'hand', 'marriage', 'see', 'when', 'nearly', 'Greek', 'king', 'wanted', 'marry', 'Helen', 'including', 'Agammemnon', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Odyseus', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odyseus', 'came', 'up', 'plan', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'trial', 'win', 'Helen', 'then', 'losers', 'would', 'band', 'together', 'enemy', 'said', 'enemy', 'ever', 'tried', 'steal', 'Helen', 'winner', 'Well', 'kings', 'followed', 'plan', 'sailed', 'Troy', 'order', 'get', 'back', '10-year', 'war', 'followed', 'main', 'figures', 'being', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'side', 'Greeks', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'side', 'Trojans.Ok', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'writer', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'who', 'chose', 'do', 'gods', 'who', 'played', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Trojan', 'War', 'were', 'eliminated', 'story', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'started', 'Menelaus', 'treating', 'guests', 'Trojan', 'princes', 'Hector', 'Paris', 'peace', 'dinner', 'Troy', 'one', 'few', 'definitely', 'most', 'powerful', 'states', 'not', 'Greek', 'rule', 'Menelaus', 'brother', 'Agammemnon', 'who', 'rule', 'Aegean', 'Sea', 'stay', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'Paris', 'come', 'home', 'consents', 'angers', 'Menelaus', 'so', 'much', 'brother', 'asking', 'help', 'getting', 'back', 'Agammemnon', 'excuse', 'go', 'war', 'Troy', 'army', '50,000', 'Greeks', 'fight', 'Troy', 'Odyseus', 'Achilles', 'are', 'two', 'leaders', 'enlisted', 'fight', 'Agammemnon', 'weary', 'Achilles', 'two', 'detest', 'other', 'When', 'Agammemnon', 'one', 'Achilles', 'girls', 'captured', 'Achilles', 'stop', 'fighting', 'watch', 'Greeks', 'get', 'slaughtered', 'death', 'cousin', 'Patroclus', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Hector', 'get', 'back', 'war.I', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'riveting', 'very', 'entertaining', 'However', 'have', 'extensive', 'knowledge', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'noticed', 'many', 'discrepancies', 'bugged', 'little', 'bit', 'mainly', 'had', 'do', 'deaths', 'people', 'died', 'were', 'supposed', 'others', 'died', 'Also', 'characters', 'motives', 'were', 'obscured', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'Agammemnon', 'being', 'war-hungry', 'was', 'crack', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Agamemmnon', 'was', 'pig', 'went', 'war', 'Helen', 'not', 'land.Oh', 'well', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'Odyseus', 'were', 'right', 'mark', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'jobs', 'playing', 'attributes', 'morals', 'were', 'not', 'obscured', 'did', 'think', 'Odyseus', 'was', 'bit', 'underused', 'kind', 'sold', 'short', 'end', 'kind', 'set', 'things', 'up', 'Odysey', 'Homer', 'other', 'great', 'epic', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'crew', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'Virgil', 'Aeneid', 'Paris', 'handed', 'Sword', 'Troy', 'Aeneis', 'Frankie', 'Fitzgerald', 'order', 'find', 'new', 'home.My', 'last', 'word', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'Greek', 'myth', 'fan', 'try', 'not', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken']",N/A

851992,A2Z4WSNH9EDEDG,B0002Z0EXQ,"angelduke ""angelduke""","[11, 17]","I saw an early screening of the movie last night, and was quite impressed with Wolfgang Peterson's adaptation of an excellent and timeless story.For those who know little or nothing about the background of the story, they will probably not be convinced by some of the scenes (i.e. the abrupt endings/agreements in the middle of battles), but trust me...they are actually fairly accurate with the time they are portraying.Unlike some viewers, I thought Brad Pitt was perfectly cast as Achilles - he convinced me instantly that he was the arrogant, selfish, ultra-perfect warrior that Achilles was.  Actually, the real character of Achilles was much more brutal than how Peterson has him portrayed (in the killing of Hector, it actually took several days before Achilles would give up the body so it could be given a proper funeral...and he wasn't as sympathetic as Brad Pitt makes him out to be).It is true that Peterson does play around with the story and takes several liberties to fit into his vision of the film...but what director doesn't?  The important thing is that it embodies the heart of the story, and I think it does that perfectly.  The entire movie has that epic, greater-than-life quality that used to be present in the old Roman, ""sword-and-sandal"" films of the past...something the film Gladiator tried to do too, but while I loved that film also, I feel that Troy is much more accurate and much better executed overall. Especially when it came to the battle sequences...while Gladiator possessed none of the qualities of how the Romans actually fought (watch the movie Spartacus - it does a much better job), Troy succeeds in portraying how the ancient Greeks did.  And watching Achilles fight was simply breathtaking (excuse my bloodlust)!My greatest qualm, I guess, was the music.  I am not a huge fan of Horner...in my opinion, there are only a few times when he has been wholly inventive and original (Braveheart, Glory, and Legends of the Fall are probably the highlights of his career).  The majority of his music have been pathetic copies of either Braveheart (if you don't believe me, listen to Bicentennial Man) or some other previous work he's done.  There's nothing wrong with having a certain trademark sound to all your work - John Williams certainly stamps most of his music with a sound that is unique to him - but that is a huge difference from outright copying from yourself.  This time around, however, he didn't copy from himself...he just tried copying from Hans Zimmer's Gladiator soundtrack.  True, he doesn't outright copy from Zimmer, but it's obvious he's trying too hard to capture the magic of Gladiator's music...and he fails, I'm sorry to say.  It's not a bad soundtrack (I've heard a lot worse), but I wish it had been worthy of the movie.Okay, enough Horner-bashing (sorry to the many James Horner fans out there).  All in all, a great movie worthy of the great story it comes from.  If the story fails to convince the viewers as believable, that's because it does come from a legendary STORY that may or may not be true (the argument goes on and on).  I've studied both the facts and the legend, and am convinced that there was a Troy and a great battle at it...but as for the rest, well, who knows.I'll finally close with a reminder from the character of Odysseus...like him, when you watch the movie, you will walk with giants of legend.",5,Troy,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,3389,"['saw', 'early', 'screening', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'timeless', 'story.For', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'nothing', 'background', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'convinced', 'scenes', 'i.e', 'abrupt', 'endings/agreements', 'middle', 'battles', 'are', 'actually', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'time', 'are', 'portraying.Unlike', 'viewers', 'thought', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Achilles', 'convinced', 'instantly', 'was', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'ultra-perfect', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'was', 'Actually', 'real', 'character', 'Achilles', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'how', 'Peterson', 'portrayed', 'killing', 'Hector', 'actually', 'took', 'several', 'days', 'Achilles', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'body', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'proper', 'funeral', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'sympathetic', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'out', 'be', '.It', 'true', 'Peterson', 'play', 'story', 'several', 'liberties', 'fit', 'vision', 'film', 'what', 'director', ""n't"", 'important', 'thing', 'heart', 'story', 'think', 'perfectly', 'entire', 'movie', 'epic', 'greater-than-life', 'quality', 'used', 'be', 'present', 'old', 'Roman', 'sword-and-sandal', 'films', 'past', 'something', 'film', 'Gladiator', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'loved', 'film', 'also', 'feel', 'Troy', 'much', 'more', 'accurate', 'much', 'better', 'executed', 'overall', 'Especially', 'when', 'came', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Gladiator', 'possessed', 'none', 'qualities', 'how', 'Romans', 'actually', 'fought', 'watch', 'movie', 'Spartacus', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Troy', 'portraying', 'how', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'did', 'watching', 'Achilles', 'fight', 'was', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'bloodlust', 'greatest', 'qualm', 'guess', 'was', 'music', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Horner', 'opinion', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'been', 'wholly', 'inventive', 'original', 'Braveheart', 'Glory', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'are', 'probably', 'highlights', 'career', 'majority', 'music', 'have', 'been', 'pathetic', 'copies', 'Braveheart', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'other', 'previous', 'work', 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'having', 'certain', 'trademark', 'sound', 'work', 'John', 'Williams', 'certainly', 'most', 'music', 'sound', 'unique', 'huge', 'difference', 'outright', 'copying', 'time', 'around', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'copy', 'just', 'tried', 'copying', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Gladiator', 'soundtrack', 'True', ""n't"", 'outright', 'copy', 'Zimmer', 'obvious', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'capture', 'magic', 'Gladiator', 'music', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'worse', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'worthy', 'movie.Okay', 'enough', 'Horner-bashing', 'sorry', 'many', 'James', 'Horner', 'there', 'great', 'movie', 'worthy', 'great', 'story', 'story', 'convince', 'viewers', 'believable', 'come', 'legendary', 'STORY', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'argument', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'facts', 'legend', 'am', 'convinced', 'was', 'Troy', 'great', 'battle', 'rest', 'well', 'who', 'knows.I', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'close', 'reminder', 'character', 'Odysseus', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'walk', 'giants', 'legend']",N/A

Especially when Brad Pitt plays Achillies, the greatest warrior in all the world's antiquity. Especially when its shown of how Agamemnon was a greedy, fat, strutting pig who had united the greeks just to line his pockets. Him and Achillies clash endlessly over everything, from Achillies having to fight battles against other nations hero's on down to him having to answer to Agamemnon. The part of where Paris seduces Helen whose miserable with her lush, womanizing husband Menelaius and decides to go to Troy with Paris is when the movie gains speed. That's when the Greeks mobilized their fleet, Achillies beating them to the beach and slaughtering at least a dozen or more Trojans, taking Apollo's temple, and desecrating it for good measure. In it he finds Breiseis, a Trojan noble woman who chose to be a preistess to Apollo who stirs him as the proverbial woman all men want but can never have. Agamemnon, just to spite and annoy Achillies takes Bresies as a slave making Achillies decide to sit out the next battle. This causes the Greeks to lose Ajax their second best fighter, Menelauis, and a sizable peice of their army. Agamemnon reluctantly gives Bresies to Achillies, who says she's know men like him her whole life and him repling that he was born this is what he is. That night she tries to slit his throat, only to have him make love to her in such a way she sleeps in his bed into morning. Achillies looks at her and considers something amazing for him, leaving Troy and the glory he'd have for all of time from fighting there. That night Achillies with Breises she asks him if he could leave this war, he replies could you leave Troy? His meaning if she could forget about her family, her culture, her country, her home he could forget about glory. Then his cousin is killed, and Achillies kills Hector dragging the body behind his chariot. That night Priam begs Achillies for Hector's body, discovering Briseis is alive and takes the two back to Troy. The Greeks desperate, play a tactic of subterfuge with a hollowed out horse and make it into Troy and begin the slaughter of Troy and its populace.

Lordy!However, for anyone who has ever read Homer, and has an iota of recognition of the Oddessey, the absence of the Greek gods is a major disappointment. Hollywood of course went for the love story between lesser characters to play up the roles of Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt, and this was more an annoyance when actors with chops including Peter O'Toole were on screen. The Hollywood pretty boys looked decidedly underfed compared to the beefy Greek brothers of Sparta like Brian Cox, and at times this was an unexpected comical relief in fight scenes between the lithe Orlando Bloom as Paris and Agamemnon's kin.  It was not only laughable but cartoonish.The tender scenes between Hector and his wife and infant son were all but thrown out with the baby's bath water in this production as was the friendship between Achillies and Petrocles. Can't Hollywood just leave Homer alone if it wants to make a movie where a boy loves girl, girl runs away with the boy, and Greece goes after her with 50,000 extras.

I read parts of the Iliad in high school and admit I don't remember much about it, so my qualms with the film didn't involve any deviations from the epic by Homer. In fact I like how the movie tried, emphasis on ""tried,"" to make the movie more realistic and left out direct involvement by the gods. The gods still played an important part in the film, but it was the human reaction to either the belief (King Priam of Troy) and disbelief (Hector and Achilles) in the gods and their will.My problems with the film stem mainly from the direction: it's horrible. Close-ups and slo-mo moments are meant to evoke drama but instead come off cheezy and unintentionally comical. The score, which is a bad GLADIATOR knock-off, is absolutely terrible. And the acting by a pumped-up Pitt was far from his best. Although the problems with his performance as the warrior Achilles as a conflicted philosopher trapped inside the worlds most efficient killer likely has a lot to do with the script. In true Hollywood form, TROY tries to give us clear-cut teams to root for and against.We know how the story ends, but TROY tries to make the audience not want it to happen. It fails. The story of TROY goes as thus: evil, power hungry Greek King Agamemnon uses his cuckolded brother Menelaus, who's wife Helen ran off with Prince Paris of Troy, as an excuse to launch the greatest Greek army in history to take control of Troy. The moody warrior Achilles, who hates Agamemnon, yet fights for him because he seeks glory and fame, governs the Greek army's morale with his own band of elite Greek warriors. The city of Troy is governed by old king Priam, who relies heavily on the council of his priests of Apollo, and his two sons: Hector and Paris. The younger Paris is a coward and selfish boy. Hector is the Trojan Achilles, but less conflicted. Hector believes in honor and country and family. In other words Hector is the ""good"" good guy to Achilles' ""bad-boy"" good guy. The two meet in an implausible yet climactic one-on-one battle that is the movie's high point.TROY tries and fails to combine aspects of BRAVEHEART & GLADIATOR with a lot of nude Brad Pitt scenes thrown for those into that sort of stuff. However, I went w/ 3 friends and all of us heckled the film throughout. Pretty much the entire theater agreed. We were all waiting for the film to just end so we could leave.

Thus spoke Agamemnon at the start of this film, yet his words are strangely applicable to all men regardless of the age in which they were born. The same can be said of the epics of Homer. The working title of this film was The Illiad, but there are some major departures between the landmark of literature and the script from which the movie was made. Without the gods as characters, a great deal of the story loses its meaning. Furthermore, a ""war, what is it good for?"" angle has been introduced and instilled within the characters. In my humble opinion, such a stance concerning battles and death is strikingly misguided in relation to those who lived in the classical world. Sons and husbands dying was a daily occurrence, and many of the conversations in this movie are more reflective of twentieth century therapism than anything to do with the Greeks or Trojans.However, despite one's historical objections to the interjections made by the characters in the name of our times, Troy is a very entertaining movie. Its 2+ hours float by, and I can't recall a film that was so pretty. That sounds condescending but it isn't. Its colors are vivid, and the views engaging. It pleases regardless of how disjointed the narrative may be. As for Brad Pitt as Achilles, if you ask me, he is the best part of the movie. I know some people won't buy him in such a role, but I was quite impressed. He won his acting bona fides with me years ago in Kalifornia and stood out in Snatch as well.

While Menelaus is preoccupied with other matters he leaves his wife, Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to her own devises. The younger Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) is left alone to many times with Helen and decides against everyone else's better judgment to make her Helen of Troy and thus pilfers her from Menelaus.As a husband Menelaus is of course miffed. However his brother the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) sees this as an opportunity to absorb Troy into his territory. Natural this spawns a war in which Agamemnon recruits Achilles an extremely gifted and charmed warrior. Achilles goes to make a name for him self. He brings his cronies, and his cousin. Together they do many bold and callous things.I will not go into the details of the war as you either know or will soon know the details.

852006,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B0002Z0EXQ,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[0, 0]","This lavish war movie took us back 3,200 years ago to discover the truth about the legend of Achilles' heel. The scenes were similar to the primitive fight of our Civil War. The Trojan War was vast and destructive (as was the War Between the States in America); the Colonial Wars were just as bad. At least there was no scalping of prisoners or dead warriors as portrayed in Coyle's SAVAGE WILDERNESS. However, it was not an easy thing to see. Parts of the movie were shot in Mexico; the female vocal was performed by someone named Tanya. Johnny Mathis sang ""Remember."" The musical director was the marvelous James Horner of TITANTIC fame. War and horror movies depend on the orchestral mood-setting music, and this was no exception. At times, it was spectacular like the sunrise there in Mexico.Based on Homer's THE ILIAD, the saga is updated to 2004 sexual propensities. The nude scenes were not needed in such a movie, only lower the integrity of Homer's classic. The gladiators may have used primitive weapons, such as spears, shields, bows & arrows (they did play dirty using the fire arrows), and I like the nose guards on their helmets. The Trojans were dressed in gray, as they invaded. They loved a spectacle, sometimes fighting without shields. They trampled their own dead in retreat, with some revenge killings. At least, the dead were not left on the field (sand) for the vultures and given a burial pyre where they fell. There were many such death pyres similar to India's tradition. The final was an indoor flame for Hector, the real star of this saga, when the funeral games lasted twelve days.The fleet of ancient boats was quite spectacular. There was pandemonium in the streets (larger scale than in PIRATES OF PENZANCE in which Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline starred) as the fleet approached. There was mass slaughter inside the walls of the city and the fires turned it into a huge funeral pyre. Now, this is the film in which the Rock should have starred. Brad Pitt made a valiant effort. He looked silly, however, in a skirt; his outfits influenced this summer's skimpy styles for women. He looked like a woman with that hair style (bleached blonde to boot). He was a mean (though not lean) fighting machine.Jewelry was abundant on men with earrings and gold ornaments in their long hair. The women (except for Achilles mother) wore lavish jewels -- even the slave girl loved by Achilles (who turned out to be a real princess), was cousin of Hector. The old king, with his ugly teeth, played by Peter O'Toole was humanly portrayed as the father of two handsome sons: Hector married with a blue-eyed son (even Trojan babies suched their thumbs) and Paris who caused all this havoc by stealing the young wife, Helen, who just wanted a man she could grow old with. Her Greek husband was old enough to be her father. Women were used merely as chattal for sex and pro-creation, not much love involved. Achilles slept with women but he loved his male cousin. When the cousin gave his life (dressed as Achilles), a vendetta took place. Hector wasd a fool who thought he'd killed Achilles but revenge caused his death and his body was dragged thtough the desert tied to Achilles' chariot. The old king appealed for his son's body; consequently, we see the Trojan horse and the vermin who escaped to open the gates for a new, massive fleet of Greek warriors to wreck havoc.There were gorgeous horses in the seaside camp on the Trojan Beach. Thank God they freed the horses from the final inferno. The nudity was bad and totally unnecessary. There was a bevy of belly dancers at the feast in Sparta. At Phtia, there was a type of Stonehenge where Achilles practiced sword play with his cousin. His weakness was the sword through his heel as he could not walk, run, or fight back. As he cried before he died, I thought, ""So, he was human after all, not just a killing monstrosity."" He could find peace only in death.There was plunder as spoils of war. During the twelve-day reprieve, one of the Greek men was shown carving a stone horse with a sharp knife ""for my son back home."" I guess he got it, as there was a final victory with the Trojans being defeated. It does no good to be sorry 'after the fact.' We're all human, and humans make mistakes -- sometimes fatal. This extra-long movie (music kept it going) showed that even enemies can show respect. When Achilles ""frees"" the woman who loves him to return to her people (not caring how he hurts her), it parodies the old adage: ""You Always Hurt The One You Love.""",3,Another Achilles Heel.,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,4531,"['lavish', 'war', 'movie', 'took', 'back', '3,200', 'years', 'ago', 'discover', 'truth', 'legend', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'scenes', 'were', 'similar', 'primitive', 'fight', 'Civil', 'War', 'Trojan', 'War', 'was', 'vast', 'destructive', 'was', 'War', 'Between', 'States', 'America', 'Colonial', 'Wars', 'were', 'just', 'bad', 'least', 'was', 'scalping', 'prisoners', 'dead', 'warriors', 'portrayed', 'Coyle', 'SAVAGE', 'WILDERNESS', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'see', 'Parts', 'movie', 'were', 'shot', 'Mexico', 'female', 'vocal', 'was', 'performed', 'someone', 'named', 'Tanya', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'sang', 'Remember', 'musical', 'director', 'was', 'marvelous', 'James', 'Horner', 'TITANTIC', 'fame', 'War', 'horror', 'movies', 'depend', 'orchestral', 'mood-setting', 'music', 'was', 'exception', 'times', 'was', 'spectacular', 'sunrise', 'there', 'Mexico.Based', 'Homer', 'THE', 'ILIAD', 'saga', 'updated', '2004', 'sexual', 'propensities', 'nude', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'needed', 'such', 'movie', 'only', 'lower', 'integrity', 'Homer', 'classic', 'gladiators', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'primitive', 'weapons', 'such', 'spears', 'shields', 'arrows', 'did', 'play', 'dirty', 'using', 'fire', 'like', 'nose', 'guards', 'helmets', 'Trojans', 'were', 'dressed', 'gray', 'invaded', 'loved', 'spectacle', 'sometimes', 'fighting', 'shields', 'trampled', 'own', 'dead', 'retreat', 'revenge', 'killings', 'least', 'dead', 'were', 'not', 'left', 'field', 'sand', 'vultures', 'given', 'burial', 'pyre', 'where', 'fell', 'were', 'many', 'such', 'death', 'pyres', 'similar', 'India', 'tradition', 'final', 'was', 'indoor', 'flame', 'Hector', 'real', 'star', 'saga', 'when', 'funeral', 'games', 'lasted', 'twelve', 'days.The', 'fleet', 'ancient', 'boats', 'was', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'was', 'pandemonium', 'streets', 'larger', 'scale', 'PIRATES', 'OF', 'PENZANCE', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'starred', 'fleet', 'approached', 'was', 'mass', 'slaughter', 'walls', 'city', 'fires', 'turned', 'huge', 'funeral', 'pyre', 'Now', 'film', 'Rock', 'should', 'have', 'starred', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'made', 'valiant', 'effort', 'looked', 'silly', 'however', 'skirt', 'outfits', 'influenced', 'summer', 'skimpy', 'styles', 'women', 'looked', 'woman', 'hair', 'style', 'bleached', 'blonde', 'boot', 'was', 'mean', 'not', 'lean', 'fighting', 'machine.Jewelry', 'was', 'abundant', 'men', 'earrings', 'gold', 'ornaments', 'long', 'hair', 'women', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'wore', 'lavish', 'jewels', 'even', 'slave', 'girl', 'loved', 'Achilles', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'princess', 'was', 'cousin', 'Hector', 'old', 'king', 'ugly', 'teeth', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'humanly', 'portrayed', 'father', 'two', 'handsome', 'sons', 'Hector', 'married', 'blue-eyed', 'son', 'even', 'Trojan', 'babies', 'suched', 'thumbs', 'Paris', 'who', 'caused', 'havoc', 'stealing', 'young', 'wife', 'Helen', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'man', 'could', 'grow', 'old', 'Greek', 'husband', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'father', 'were', 'used', 'merely', 'chattal', 'sex', 'pro-creation', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'involved', 'Achilles', 'slept', 'women', 'loved', 'male', 'cousin', 'When', 'cousin', 'gave', 'life', 'dressed', 'Achilles', 'vendetta', 'took', 'place', 'Hector', 'wasd', 'fool', 'who', 'thought', ""'d"", 'killed', 'Achilles', 'revenge', 'caused', 'death', 'body', 'was', 'dragged', 'desert', 'tied', 'Achilles', 'chariot', 'old', 'king', 'appealed', 'son', 'body', 'consequently', 'see', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'vermin', 'who', 'escaped', 'open', 'gates', 'new', 'massive', 'fleet', 'Greek', 'warriors', 'wreck', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'horses', 'seaside', 'camp', 'Trojan', 'Beach', 'Thank', 'God', 'freed', 'horses', 'final', 'inferno', 'nudity', 'was', 'bad', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'bevy', 'belly', 'dancers', 'feast', 'Sparta', 'Phtia', 'was', 'type', 'Stonehenge', 'where', 'Achilles', 'practiced', 'sword', 'play', 'cousin', 'weakness', 'was', 'sword', 'heel', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'run', 'fight', 'back', 'cried', 'died', 'thought', 'So', 'was', 'human', 'not', 'just', 'killing', 'monstrosity', 'could', 'find', 'peace', 'only', 'death.There', 'was', 'plunder', 'spoils', 'war', 'twelve-day', 'reprieve', 'one', 'Greek', 'men', 'was', 'shown', 'carving', 'stone', 'horse', 'sharp', 'knife', 'son', 'back', 'home', 'guess', 'got', 'was', 'final', 'victory', 'Trojans', 'being', 'defeated', 'good', 'be', 'sorry', 'fact', ""'re"", 'human', 'humans', 'make', 'mistakes', 'sometimes', 'fatal', 'extra-long', 'movie', 'music', 'kept', 'going', 'showed', 'even', 'enemies', 'can', 'show', 'respect', 'When', 'Achilles', 'frees', 'woman', 'who', 'return', 'people', 'not', 'caring', 'how', 'old', 'adage', 'Always', 'Hurt', 'One', 'Love']",N/A

Keena,"[4, 4]","Well, now...aside from condensing a 10-year seige into a 2-week affair, I'd have to say that this film has some REALLY impressive elements.Brad Pitt--Hey, that fancy battle move is worth the whole price.  I thought Pitt did a wonderful job of conveying the ""victory or death"" credo of the Greek warrior.  He's a deliciously moody Achilles; and the nuances of soldiering philosophy ""a conscience does not become a sword."" is well carried off.  Pitt often gets less credit than he deserves, I think, because he makes it look too easy, and his performance in TROY is much more than adequate.  He creates an Achilles worthy of Homer.Olando Bloom and Eric Bana are equisitely matched at brothers Paris and Hector.  Eric Bana, especially, delivers a stirring performance of the antithesis of Achilles--a warrior with a conscience, a soldier with a reason to live (loving wife and family), a man who fights for his country, not personal glory.  Bana probably should have been considered for an Oscar.  Orlando's looks and the youthful impetuosity he gives Paris are nicely done.Great to see Sean Bean as Odysseus.  He was everything that planner should be--manipulative, winning.Peter O'Toole--Well, what can one say?  His performance as Priam is exquisite--especially as he pleads with Achilles for the body of his beloved son.  Unfortunately, Peter learned a long time ago that Oscar hates him...sad, isn't it?The weakest link is probably the portrayal of Helen.  She's the one character you'd probably want to know more about and yet she impresses the audience as a dishrag...it's a wonder Hector didn't feed her to Agamemnon for dinner just to be rid of her cow-eyed whinning.  I think maybe Paris might have helped him do it, actually.  She certainly was tiresome.  I think Helen just might have had a little more back bone than that--after all, she certainly wasn't ignorant of what the result of her actions would be.BUT...This film, for any flaws, has an ""old-time-epic"" feel about it that I don't think has been that well captured since BEN HUR.  The thousand ships, the Trojan Plains, the City Gates...it's all pure majesty.My family was mixed...My daughter, husband, and I liked it very much.

852008,A3FMZGLC0XBU64,B0002Z0EXQ,bharring,"[2, 4]","Forget the fact that Greek mythology holds that the war was actually started by the gods up on Mount Olympus; forget the fact that Achilles' immortality but for his tendon (where the term ""Achilles tendon"" comes from) goes pretty much unmentioned; and forget the fact that Achilles actually died before the conquest of Troy and there were plenty of other exciting Greek warriors anyway. The reinventing of history by Hollywood isn't anything new. However, just because the plotline of a movie is inaccurate doesn't mean it has to be poorly done.Essentially, the plotline is that son of the Trojan king and queen, Paris (Orlando Bloom), falls in love with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), king of Sparta's, pretty wife, Helen (Diane Kruger). When Paris decides to smuggle Helen into the Trojan ship, the Greeks are furious because the two sides have just signed some sort of treaty. Thus, all of the warriors of Greece, who once signed a pledge to defend Helen, the most beautiful lady of the land, if any harm should befall her, are sent into battle. The Greeks bring out the big guns, most notably, the great warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, in case you weren't aware) who agrees to fight despite his mother's (Julie Christie) prophecy that if he goes to Troy he will die. What ensues is basically a combination of intense battle scenes (but you're spoiled if you have seen Lord of the Rings) and some heady romantic scenes (Brad Pitt is naked in the very first shot), but other than that the whole affair is very shallow. If you know anything about the Iliad (and I'm not a Classics major) you will be groaning. The characters are skin-deep and hopelessly predictable.Brad Pitt does all right as a buff warrior, but there is no real room for him to scope out his acting ability. You will not be able to help rolling your eyes as you watch him show his ""softer side"" and teach his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; how to duel (and then of course experience the agonies of grief when he dies) as well as when he woos Briseis, a captured temple virgin (Rose Byrne), and then defends her as Troy falls. However, if you are looking for the wild and crazy rogue who played Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"" then this is not the movie for you. German model Diane Kruger was a very safe choice for Helen-a typical blonde blue-eyed maiden with very little affect or attitude. Basically no one with any spunk or charisma would be an appropriate choice for Helen, because she is more of an object of desire than an actual human being. She played her role (which required minimal acting ability) well enough. Orlando Bloom was well-cast in his role as a pretty, cowardly sissy who spends his time being tortured and love-stricken and posturing for the ladies.Perhaps the worst aspect of this film was the screenplay! I have not encountered such terrible dialogue in a movie since ""Titanic"". Clich&eacute; lines such as `I will love you in this world and the next' are everywhere. An exchange between Helen and Paris which basically consists of: ""You shouldn't be here!"" ""That's what you said last night and the night before that, etc."" and then suddenly Helen's naked, caused the entire theater to burst out laughing! Actually the entire movie did! If the whole thing had been a spoof then it would have been fine, but as a serious movie, Troy did not deliver.

Brad Pitt does more than hold his own here, and while there is some silly dialogue there are some genuine moments where I think he shines. Eric Bana as Hector portrays him superbly. The film just looks gorgeous all-around, and the fight scenes are impressive both in scale and intensity.People, there are a whole lot of worse movies out there. With all of the crap that gets made these days, we don't need to savage the good ones. A lot of people had problems with Brad Pitt as Achilles. So he doesn't always speak with the proper accent. Is that a reason to dislike the film so intensely? Pitt is one of the better actors out there, and rarely involves himself in lightweight, forgettable films. This a a true epic, and Wolfgang Petersen did a masterful job in covering the important parts of the movie when confronted with all of the material presented in Homer's Iliad. Hey, Peter Jackson tinkered with The Lord of the Rings, and I don't see a whole lot of backlash over that!I think that there are a lot of people today in this world who do nothing but criticize the works of others, and try to come off as cool in doing so, and that is what they think they contribute to society.

852011,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,B0002Z0EXQ,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[1, 1]","After watching this highly superior epic four times in succession I attempted to revise and edit my first review, upwards, but Amazon wasn't having it; so I scrapped it, and now start again.To anyone familiar with Homeric legend there is much that is disconcerting about  this telling of the story, which is different from the Iliad, although using numerous characters and incidents from the ancient Greek original --- not that the Iliad itself was original in the sense one might assume. These stories had been told and re-told, each bard adding and omitting to suit his audience and his own temperament. There seems nothing wrong, therefore, for a modern team of writer and film director to do their own thing, especially as they have deliberately changed the title of their tale, making it quite clear that they are not aiming to reproduce the classic Iliad. Any criticism which complains that Benioff and Petersen don't precisely follow Homer (if he ever existed) is  barking up the wrong tree.This is a stunning, intriguing and fascinating movie in its own right. At first one may be taken aback, for other reasons besides its deviation from its inspiration. The dialogue is curiously throwaway and informal, to anyone brought up on the sententiously stilted posturing and declaiming of traditional celluloid epics.  A number of reviewers are annoyed by what they regard as the inaccuracies and  anachronisms of social life, battle techniques, armour, equipment and so forth. The fact is that no one is quite sure when, if ever, the famous siege of Troy took place --- and there is even some doubt as to where.  All that is certain is that it was in the past; a long, long, time ago. This aspect is conveyed with tremendous effect. At the same time, the actions, motivations, behaviour and psychology of the individuals is bang up-to-date, and extremely convincing. The political power-play, the arrogant insubordination of Achilles, the dependency and resentful hatred of the boss, ring true. Achilles' petulance is a strong and crucial feature of the familiar version. Brad Pitt's performance, and ability to convey his utter superiority as a killing machine on the battle-field, is exceptional. The fact is that the Iliad itself centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity.The absence of the Gods is complained of.  I didn't feel this in any way at all. The Gods are present in this movie, just as much as they are in Homer. No contemporary actually imagined that Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and the rest appeared on the battlefield. They were conscious, however, of how little men could do to take charge of their own destinies. The hidden presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are presented as if in the grip of outside forces. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles, which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice were illusory. They still are --- although we are obliged to believe that we are in control of our own lives.Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Her changing expressions as she enters Troy for the first time speak volumes.

So if you don't and don't want any details then stop reading.I love stories about ancient wars and epic heroes and so I was extremely excited about watching this movie because:1) I normally enjoy Brad Pitt's movies2) If your making an epic film this is really the only epic tale.As far as the cinematography and music are concerned, this film was definately top notch and really left nothing to be desired in those two areas. The story is a fascinating one, however, David Benioff's screenplay has two huge flaws (among many little details) that really bring this movie down, A LOT.1. Achilles is going to war to get glory that will last thousands of years (this point is referenced several times in the film). But, in the movie, Achilles really only has two fight scenes and one of them is a one on one duel. Yes, I know the story of Achilles, but I really felt like he needed at least one more defining moment to show he was truly the greatest warrior ever.2. First let me say I DO NOT like Orlando Bloom as an actor and I don't think I ever will. He plays the same elf from Lord of the Rings in every single movie he is in. As a happy coincidence, Bloom played the character I disliked the most in this movie...Paris. Paris is a weak character, never actually does anything heroic,  and has no redeeming actions or qualities in this screenplay whatsoever. YET, he is the one who ultimately brings down Achilles...while he is embracing the woman he loves who is screaming ""Paris, NO."" YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!

852018,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B0002Z0EXQ,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[0, 4]","Many milennia ago, so far back that even historians can't pin it down, a man named Homer apparently wrote an epic Greek tragedy entitled ""The Iliad.""  Even that isn't entirely sure.  The existence of Troy, even longer ago, is a bit more sure, as is the belief that said Troy was involved in a war like the one depicted in this film.  Other than those generally accepted facts, it isn't known how much of ""The Iliad"" is myth or reality, although some of the characters are Greek gods and goddesses, which makes it easier to figure which parts of Homer's story might be myth.  So, let's not get all worked up about how historically accurate this film is, OK?Those who know something about ""The Iliad"" will at least be interested to see how director Wolfgang Petersen and the staff of this production demythologize the story of Achilles, his heel, the Trojan horse, the man for whom Paris is named, and Helen of Troy whose face launched a thousand ships.  Many have had little good to say about the adaptation.  I'll say some good things, however.For one, I bought Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, although his character has been overwhelmingly modernized, like almost everything else in this version of the ancient tale.  A loner, the world's greatest warrior, iconoclast, apathetic in the extreme where politics is concerned, Achilles is presented as the kind of character who might say the modern line, ""The men want to be me and the women want to be with me.""  Along the lines of eye candy for the guys, there's Diane Kruger, the lovely young lady who portrays Helen of Troy, her face truly worthy of seamanship on a mass scale.  Also excellent in supporting roles are Sean Bean as Achilles' adviser, Odysseus, and Brian Cox as the boastful Greek warlord Agamemnon.It's a story on a vast scale, a tale of love, war, and tragedy.  So, expect romantic moments, huge battle scenes, and an unhappy yet appropriate ending.There, however, the good news ends, for the most part.The memorable and gripping moments of ""Troy"" are also unfortunately interspersed with some truly embarrassing scenes.  One that comes to mind is when Achilles hews off the head of a golden statue with his sword.  This would be fine if he had been presented as a supernatural figure, as he was in ""The Iliad,"" but remember, we have no gods in this film other than when their names are referenced by the all too human characters on screen.  No sword would truly hold up to a massive slab of gold, and the scene is ridiculous as a result.  Even worse are some incredibly melodramatic moments early in the film where a character's closeup is actually held for a couple of seconds while the film is switched to slo-mo until fadeout.  Nothing could possibly be more cornball, except perhaps the dialogue.  Julie Christie, in a cameo as Achilles' mother, is forced to spew some of the most horrid dialogue heard in recent years.  Scenes like hers set the motion picture industry back 50 years to the days of the hamminess of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Yeech.And then there's the late great Peter O'Toole.  Oh, sorry, he's not dead?  Well, he looks it.  Aside from a touching scene in private with Pitt's Achilles, O'Toole, as the king of Troy, is seemingly one step away from the nursing home, both in looks and actions.  He's barely recognizable, the poor old sot.  Yet another parable about the destructive powers of strong drink, that man.And the battle scenes are so ""Lord Of the Rings""-like as to be blatantly obvious even to those who haven't seen any of the LOtR films.  It was once clever to computerize a few hundred extras and replicate them to become many thousands, but now it just looks cheesy.  Or maybe that's just ""Troy"" working its questionable magic again.By the end of the film I was really unsure whether to be glad it was over, savor the occasional satisfying scene, or be sickened at the way the memorable fable of Achilles' heel is turned into almost nothing.  Upon further review, it's a bit of both.  ""Troy"" really has some fine moments and also some that are laughably bad.  Please don't take the film seriously, and you just might enjoy it as a rental.  I would not recommend a purchase.

852020,A1BJ04DTXVHSAN,B0002Z0EXQ,Brian W. Glenn,"[3, 5]","Most people blamed this movie for the shallowness of the characters, but they are not shallow, they are God driven... It's true that as the gods are omitted in the film Helen appears as a brainless woman determined to trigger a war for love: she is not Aphrodite promised Paris he would have her. Some say that Paris is a spoiled brat who should have been killed: he has grown far from his family and was only found back recently, that's why they are all so glad to have him (moreover Paris is not supposed to be a nice man just because Orlando bloom is famous...).  The absence of Gods had numerous effects, it is not obvious for people who do not know the iliad that Achille has reasons to be so scornful, that Paris and Helen had no choice. People think that Agamemnon is a tyrant ready to invade any part of the world for any reason: he is only Menelas' brother and leader of the kings who have all sworn to protect the couple Menelas/ Helen There are some details that really do not fit in the original story (the way Odysseus convinces Achille to come, the death of Achille...) but it's an adaptation of a book six time as long as LOTR, and including a cast of famous actors that do not like to die stupidly and cowardly... In my opinion it is a very good film, though there are some discrepancies with the Illiad. Those who say that they didn't like the characters miss the point cos the characters are mainly as they should be.

I was soooo dissapointed with the movie I felt ike sleeping through it. In another words, I didn't like it at all!Firstly, the plot is paris steals Helen. The king wants her back so they have war, but then......... the story drags on, and suddenly, the battle of troy changes, it is not about helen much any more, STUFF HER! and we just want to destroy troy anyways! Basically, most of the wars and duels are for the sake of revenge after revenge. In Troy, there is no real hero. Brad Pitt is Achillies and he only wants to destroy troy because Hector (Eric Banna) killed his cousin. He didn't even fight the first MAJOR war of troy when Helen was stolen, he just tagged along and went on the beach and killed more people and slicing the head off the god: Apollo. Helen, ARGH!! in my opinion, she does not have the looks to launch over 1000 ships, her acting is not very good and she gets forgoten afterwards without you knowing, ( this confirms that the main plot has changed. THe things we see Helen is walking and talking very little lines in the film. Hector (bana) is quite good in this film, for some reason, I thought he was more of a hero in troy than achillies. Another thing I cannot stand in film are corny lines (screenplay. Beleive it or not, screen play is very important to a film and in a film like this, there is zero tolerance for bad script and I went crazy when achillies said ( if I remember correctly) ""its too early for killing princes now"" and Helen saying ' don't play with me"". Orlando Bloom (Paris) is only O.K in acting while he doesn't do much in the film than talk and just become a coward in fighting and the thing which was quite wierd is that at the sacking of troy, He used his bow and arrow very professionally ( HMMMMM I WONDER WHAT MOVIE HE GOT IT FROM!!!!!!. Thew battles, yes, the first time it was nice but after wards, it just kept going on and on. The problem with the battles that it was not innovative, just people crashing into each other with swords however I liked when Troy attacked The greeks in the night attack.The SCore music of troy was horrible, Even during the actual war, the music was dumb and did not stand out, it did not give this ""POWER"" of the film. The reason why Lord of the rings is quite popular is bevause of the music beleive it or not. Emotion must be heard by visual and audio. And Lord of the rings had this combination and it dominated the screen and the battle music was strong and had meaning. James Horner (who had only a few days to score) should not have scored the film in the first place, the director shouldn't have fired the Original conductor just becvause the music was too old fasioned. UMMMMMM!!!! WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THOUSNDS OF YEARS BEFORE CHIRST HERE!!!The film is worth seeing int he cinema than DVD so see it in the cinema if your planning to see the movie.The movie could be done better as Emotion in the film was not enough to get our attention and to feel the emotion.Bad music, bad screenplay, bad directing, sometimes bad acting.. but I didn't give the movie a zero or 1 star, as some scenes were quite good but those little scenes only stood out, out of 2hrs 45mins",2,ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In fact, this edition is shockingly devoid of content.. a real disappointment considering how great some other 2-disc sets are.The first disc is only the movie. No audio commentary, nothing, so why even put a ""Special Features"" item on the menu screen? Selecting it tells you to see Disc 2. I realize this is a long movie (over 2 hours), so space was an issue here, but the studio could've squeezed in an audio commentary track. It doesn't take that much space. Director/actor commentaries are par for the course these days and a lot of people enjoy listening to them and consider them essential to a DVD purchase. Instead, we have a French dubbed track.. and we all know how people love dubs, and French, no less.The second disc is appallingly miserly in content: three 10-15 minute production featurettes, a 3-D gallery of the gods (who cares about bad 3D?) which are about 5 minutes each god, and subtitles. That's it! End of story. All in all, that's less than 1 hour of content. The featurettes are mildly interesting, but are too short and left me wanting more. That's the reason I and a whole lot of people buy these DVD 2 disc sets: to see the behind the scenes stuff and details about the film making process.Other historically based movie DVD's like Kingdom of Heaven and Last Samurai pack a lot of content in and you get a lot for your money. Not here. The second disc is virtually useless. Yet another lazy DVD put out by a studio seeking to cut corners. Don't reward lazy studios.

This is no worse than ""Ben Hur"" or some other of that caliber. I enjoyed it thoroughly since I thought the casting and acting was great. The love stories and tradgedies follow the true stories fairly well. The timeline is a bit askew but we are no worse off for that. We get the overall story and see where the lines ""Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts"" and ""Achilles Heel"" come from.There are those that would think Brad Pitt was not right for the part of Achilles, but if that was so, he did a fine job of making it his part. His fights were choregraphed meticuously and are worth seeing the movie for alone. The detailed methods of fighting showed me some moves that I had not seen in this type movie before but make perfect since to me. Afterall a moving target is hard to hit, and Achilles moves very well. I recommend it if you enjoy this type movie. Personally I like these real people movies over the CGI types.

But stop comparing an action movie, made with star power to make millions of dollars, with the book! Its like comparing apples with automobiles.On to the movie...Sure Brad Pitts role as Achilles is questionable, it still works. He puts on the right amount of flair of ego and ultimately makes his onscreen persona shine. I especially liked his death sequence. While it was far from a surprise, i thought it was well done when he plucked every arrow except the one aimed at his famous weak point.And Eric Bana. He was the real star of this movie. He played the noble-loved by all-warrior to a T. His character was so easily likable and made the tremendous Achilles vs Hector fight scene one to remeber.Sean Bean, straight from his Boromir role, played Odyssesys remarkably. His was another character that truly stood out, and its a bit sad that his character didnt have more on screen time.Though i must say that Bloom as Paris was terrible. He was weak, annoying, and very hate worthy. Though Helen was played very well for what she had to work with. They picked a great actress to play her part as anything less than a gorgeus model would not have worked to be worthy for a 'thousand ships.'All in all it was a tremendous movie and was very well paced and exciting. No scenes ever dragged on and that was surprising for a long movie like this.

Brad Pitt who plays Achilles is such a strong actor that you hate Achilles at the same time you love him!  Especially when he helps to take over Troy.  Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana along with all the other actors also give excellent strong performances.  I think for me personally the battle scenes were the best and they were the most powerful!  Yet, the romance between Achilles and Orlando and Eric's cousin was extremely powerful with the take over of Troy.  I also thought the scene where Achilles (Pitt) challenges Paris (Bloom) and Paris wimps out and his brother (Bana) takes the battle on and ends up losing his life over it was powerful!  And the treatment Achilles gives to Bana and then the talk with King Priam (Bana's father) was just excellent.

Although you might hear all there is is fighting scenes that is not true. There are alot of them but for petes sake its a war thats what usually happens in them theres fights. But like i said its not all fighting scenes. In the movie they have scenes that show love between Paris and Helen, Paris and Hector,thhe sons and fathers, and alot of other people. It also gives a great message that glory is not everything. In this movie Aquilies (im not positive on how to spell it) (Brad Pitt) goes to battles only for glory and in the end dies in the arms of the person he has fallin in love with. It was not at all boring for me (i havnt mentioned i am a girl who usually does not get into this stuff) I was into every motion of this movie and there was not one moment i was looking away from the screen. Also i beleive Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, and Brad Pitt did excellant in their parts. I dont think they where used just to bring in LOTR fans (though with or without orlando LOTR fans would enjoy this movie). They are all very talented actors and the point was proven in this movie.

852035,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0002Z0EXQ,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","The director of this film made a wise decision: make this retelling of the story of the Trojan war realistic for modern audiences. The original Illiad by Homer (on which this movie is based) is full of gods and goddesses playing with the human characters as if they were puppets. By cutting out all the gods and goddesses, we have a more clean to-the-point epic of ambition, power, love, and warfare. The characters are dirty, sweaty human beings and as fellow human beings we recognize the struggles they face.Some of the great themes of literature are raised in this film. One of these is the nature of leadership. What a wonderful contrast in leadership we see between Achilles ( a beautiful killing machine), Agamemnon (a ego maniac constantly consolidating power), Ullyses (a wise manipulating survivor),  King Priam (a patrician who trusts the gods), and Hector (a loving family man of character who unfortunately must face the demi-god Achilles in mortal combat).There is a price for editing out all the gods (Apollo, Athena,Juno, Neptune, and Aphrodite) in that the manipulations of the gods explain the motives of some of the characters. For example, when Paris selects Aphrodite as the most beautiful of the goddesses, his prize (or bribe) is that the most beautiful women in the world will love him upon first sight. Helen (herself a demi-god since she is the daughter of Zeus and Leda) is that woman and we are never convinced in the film that this woman would leave her husband for the young pretty boy, Paris.We also don't understand the sacrifice Agamemnon made to the war. The gods would not give him winds for his fleet until he sacrificed his daughter, Iphegenia. This messy scene was never shown.Also, the link between Ulysses and Achilles is never explained. Remember that it is the trickster Ulysses who finds the adolescent Achilles hidden in women's clothes because his mother knows he will die a warrior.The acting was very good. Peter O'Toole as King Priam was a standout. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana as the brothers Paris and Hector were superb. Saffron Burrows as Hector's suffering wife Andromache conveyed the personal and national crisis of Hector's death.But what was the best scene in the film?  The scene where King Priam comes to Achilles tent in the enemy camp to beg for his son's mangled body so that it might be washed and given a burial. O'Toole plays the role perfectly of a patrician,noble old man who has lost his beloved son and must now beg the killer for the corpse. Pitt does a good job of showing a man who was consumed with his own anger and grief begin the process of healing by discovering compassion and empathy within himself.And what was the best line in the film?  As Hector leaves his family to go outside the city gates to face Achilles, his father King Priam, puts his hands on his son's shoulders and says: ""No man has ever had a finer son that you have been to me."" These are the words every son wishes to hear his father say, unfortunately sometimes it takes crisis for us to open our hearts.",4,The story of Troy for our modern age,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,3052,"['director', 'film', 'made', 'wise', 'decision', 'make', 'retelling', 'story', 'Trojan', 'war', 'realistic', 'modern', 'audiences', 'original', 'Illiad', 'Homer', 'movie', 'based', 'full', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'playing', 'human', 'characters', 'were', 'puppets', 'cutting', 'out', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'have', 'more', 'clean', 'to-the-point', 'epic', 'ambition', 'power', 'love', 'warfare', 'characters', 'are', 'dirty', 'sweaty', 'human', 'beings', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'recognize', 'struggles', 'face.Some', 'great', 'themes', 'literature', 'are', 'raised', 'film', 'One', 'nature', 'leadership', 'What', 'wonderful', 'contrast', 'leadership', 'see', 'Achilles', 'beautiful', 'killing', 'machine', 'Agamemnon', 'ego', 'maniac', 'constantly', 'consolidating', 'power', 'Ullyses', 'wise', 'manipulating', 'survivor', 'King', 'Priam', 'patrician', 'who', 'gods', 'Hector', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'character', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'must', 'face', 'demi-god', 'Achilles', 'mortal', 'combat', 'price', 'editing', 'out', 'gods', 'Apollo', 'Athena', 'Juno', 'Neptune', 'Aphrodite', 'manipulations', 'gods', 'explain', 'motives', 'characters', 'example', 'when', 'Paris', 'Aphrodite', 'most', 'beautiful', 'goddesses', 'prize', 'bribe', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'will', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Helen', 'demi-god', 'daughter', 'Zeus', 'Leda', 'woman', 'are', 'never', 'convinced', 'film', 'woman', 'would', 'leave', 'husband', 'young', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Paris.We', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'sacrifice', 'Agamemnon', 'made', 'war', 'gods', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'winds', 'fleet', 'sacrificed', 'daughter', 'Iphegenia', 'messy', 'scene', 'was', 'never', 'shown.Also', 'link', 'Ulysses', 'Achilles', 'never', 'explained', 'Remember', 'trickster', 'Ulysses', 'who', 'adolescent', 'Achilles', 'hidden', 'women', 'clothes', 'mother', 'will', 'die', 'warrior.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'King', 'Priam', 'was', 'standout', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'brothers', 'Paris', 'Hector', 'were', 'superb', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'Hector', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Andromache', 'conveyed', 'personal', 'national', 'crisis', 'Hector', 'death.But', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'King', 'Priam', 'Achilles', 'tent', 'enemy', 'camp', 'beg', 'son', 'mangled', 'body', 'might', 'be', 'washed', 'given', 'burial', ""O'Toole"", 'role', 'perfectly', 'patrician', 'noble', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'beloved', 'son', 'must', 'now', 'beg', 'killer', 'corpse', 'Pitt', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'consumed', 'own', 'anger', 'grief', 'begin', 'process', 'healing', 'discovering', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'himself.And', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'line', 'film', 'Hector', 'family', 'go', 'city', 'face', 'Achilles', 'father', 'King', 'Priam', 'hands', 'son', 'shoulders', 'man', 'ever', 'had', 'finer', 'son', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'words', 'son', 'hear', 'father', 'say', 'unfortunately', 'crisis', 'open', 'hearts']",N/A

The war lasted for 10 years, and it was compressed in the movie to weeks, or maybe a couple of months.  That is some difference from Homer's depiction of it.  Paris was supposed to be killed at Troy and Helen didn't escape.  Also, Menelaus was not killed at Troy, and neither was Agamemnon.  In Homer Menelaus got Helen back and returned home, and Agamemnon returned home also, but brought Priam's daughter Cassandra with him and was killed, at home, in his bathtub, by his wife and her lover.I have to wonder why a more faithful story was not made.

You get a good movie.I was all ready to hate `Troy' with every fiber of my being. But I'm sad to admit that I was very entertained.The plot: Every child (literally) knows the story of the `Iliad', but here we get a complete bastardization of the `Iliad'.1. The Trojan War is not sparked by a goddess beauty contest gone wrong. In fact ALL supernatural elements are removed from the script. Instead it's a Romeo and Juliet love story between Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger). Except here, they live happily ever after?2. Achilles (Brad Pitt) is the main character? And he lives? Yes, somehow Achilles is now the MAIN character in the film. But instead portraying Achilles as a demigod, he's now Tyler Darden in a toga. This was obviously done to put more emphasis on Brad Pitt a anti hero punk who just happens to be a good warrior.3. Odysseus (Sean Bean) is a NOBODY? Odysseus pushes Achilles into going to war? That's right, the hero of the `Iliad' and `Odyssey' is barely of any consequence. Except that he pushes for war. In the `Iliad' Odysseus was so against the war he dressed his son as a girl to avoid the draft. When this failed, Odysseus only went to Troy to protect his son. Even Odysseus' invention of the Trojan Horse is pushed aside with literally a single phrase of ""Well done."" by Agamemnon. In fact the climax of the epic, the Horse is minimalized to just a few minutes.4. Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is the villain? He dies at the end? OK I'm not even sure how to begin.DISPITE ALL THESE FLAWS IT WORKS!!!Sad but true, even working with a mutilated story, `Troy' really is great drama. Wolfgang Peterson does a surprisingly good job of conveying the drama of the Trojan War. The fight sequences even though CGI are VERY impressive and trilling. The battles were also fairly realistic of the fighting of the time.`Troy' does a nice job of wrapping things up at 2:40 running time. `Troy' doesn't slow down. Most of the focus is on the fighting. We are spared long and frequent scenes of lovers talking about honor that really have no point.The bad actors make the good ones look better. Not a technique I'd recommend but Pitt's truly embarrassing performance (yes even worse than `Interview' or `Seven') does allow us to marvel even more at Brian Cox, whom has a really good time hamming it up as the villain, and Eric Bana as the honorable Hector.In summary, `Troy' is a lot of fun.

Yes, both films show scantily-clad, muscle men sweating, getting dirty, duking it out and professing love of one thing or another.In ""Gladiator"", the homo-erotic components is a little more subtle. Maximus is totally hot and Commodus is not. Commodus' dad, Marcus Aurelius has sublimated home-or-sect-chew-all attraction for Maximus and of course Maximus responds to it positively by going out onto the battle field with nothing more than a jock strap and some armor in order to cut off some German heads. Commodus is jealous and so he kills his dad, but then he wants to assume his father's role by consumating his (and his father's) attraction to Maximus. At first this takes the form of a loyalty enticement but when Maximus rebuffs this, Commodus unleashes a chain of murderous events that result in Maxiums performing in the Colloseum with a jock strap and some armor, a lot of tight, sweaty muscle men and even a few animals. Go Maximus! Anyway, Commodus transforms himself from observer to participant by doing a little disabling S&M; routine on Maximus and then playing with him in the arena which is both scripted homo-erotic behavior and flagrant exhibitionism. So much for ""Gay-ladiator"".""Troy"" ambitiously sets out to out-gay ""Gladiator"". From the beginning  the eye of the homo-erotic hurricane is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. My what a bad boy Achilles is. He's late for battle with Thesaly because he's sleeping in late (nood) with a couple of Ancient Greek chicks who look like a couple of Ancient Greek boys. This movie is clever about that because it gives the chicks the same hair style as the little servant boy and fails to show their distinctive feminine traits such as their love tunnels, fun seats, and chest-o-plenty.Achilles shows up at the battle field where he performs homo erotic combat with a total leather man from Thesaly. Then he goes home and plays with his cute little cousin, whacking wooden swords around and giggling while wearing cute blue dresses and having his hair sort of braided in blue.Then it's off to Troy which might as well be a gay disco spread out on the beach at day light. BOM PID DEEEEE, BOM PID DEEEE, BOM BOM BOM will you just look at all those scantily clad muscle men charging around on the beach and jumping on and stabbing each other!Ever the narcisist, it isn't enough for Achilles merely to do Hector. He also has to drag his body around the city wall behind his chariot boasting in a sort of modern prison movie manner, ""Yeah, Hector: I DID him!"" Achilles also shows as much of his nude body as he can get away with AND...he shows his sweet sensitve side not to mention his pouty bad boy nature.Oh and that combat scene between delicate little Paris and husky, aggressive Meneleus--c'mon.

Brad Pitt as Achilles is so convincing you will not doubt the legend of the man one bit.I could go on and on about the greatness of this film.  I could also go on and on about it's flaws.  I will, however, concentrate on one statement:Troy has the greatest single combat footage I've ever seen in a movie as the fight between Hector (Eric Bana) and Achilles is the true climax of this great action film.The athletic prowess taking place between Bana and Pitt is so convincing that you are certain the two are actually fighting it out for real.  It never occurs to the viewer that the scene is pure acting by professionals who know how to spoof up a scene to capture an audience's attention.  What a fight this was.  It didn't carry on too long and it wasn't too short.  The timing and moves of the action are emotively powerful.  The only flaw is that it's clear from the beginning that Achilles is going to win the confrontation.  That doesn't detract, however, from the power of this combat sequence.  I recommend that this film is watched just for this few minutes worth of highlight.But, beware when watching this film.  You might decide that you like all of it despite some overacting at some parts and some serious revisionism of the original Greek myth story.

852041,AB34G6VKP28L,B0002Z0EXQ,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","When Homer wrote the classic story of forbidden love and great folly, he never envisioned it would become a classic. Comprised of a fantastic cast and magnificent sets, Troy tries very hard to cover up its flaws. Its an interesting story but fails on many levels. It doesn't have the strong storyline and moral foundation of The Patriot. It doesn't have the driving passion of Gladiator. What Troy turns out to be is a humble attempt at romance without great conviction in a tale of characters we have trouble completely rooting for. They are all flawed and human, but not remarkable. By the end were not sorry to have seen it, just sorry that it wasn't better.King Agamemnon has been moving his armies throughout the empire, conquering one land after another. The only freestanding province remaining is Troy, seat of the high king Priam (Peter O'Toole), whose two sons have been sent to decree peacetime. Working for Sparta is a brutal warrior named Achilles (Brad Pitt), a soul born to kill men. He fights not for the empire but out of desire for glory. His mother (a briefly seen Julie Christie) acknowledges his wish for notoriety but warns him it will bring his death, foreseeing inevitable conflict on the battlefield. While in Sparta, Paris (Orlando Bloom), younger Prince of Troy, falls in love with the kings beautiful wife Helen (Diane Kruger). They conduct a clandestine affair in which both are convinced they have found true love. Paris is due to return to his homeland and begs Helen to accompany him.When Menelaus learns his wife has fled with Paris, he desires to declare war and gain the return of his wife so he can kill her with my own two hands. Agamemnon has been awaiting just such an opportunity, an excuse to attack the nation of Troy and bring it to its knees. Paris older brother Hector (Eric Bana) warns Paris against the folly of bringing home another mans wife, but has not the heart to send him to his death. Paris has promised, if Helen is returned to her husband, to follow her there, even if it means his certain execution. When they return to Troy, their father welcomes them with open arms, also extending his protection to his son's lover. When the Spartans arrive and Priam refuses to sacrifice Helen, they attack the beach of Troy. Inevitably it will bring others to war on their fair shores, including Odysseus (Sean Bean) and Achilles, who finds forbidden love in the form of the kings niece Briseis (Rose Byrne).While the story begins solidly, it loses momentum midway through. The battles have no excitement because neither army battles for anything worth fighting for. Paris wants to keep Helen at no great cost to himself. He has noble intentions of saving Troy but fails when it counts and shows cowardice. The story revolves around Helen, but she's barely given any screen time. Achilles is supposed to be likable but comes across as more of an arrogant, bloodthirsty jerk. Hectors wife (Saffron Burrows) has the most empathetic role but not enough character development. The two noblest of characters are needlessly killed for sport. When you leave the theatre thinking all involved were foolish for not trying to sort out pointless differences, the movie has failed to do its job. These men died for nothing. There was no cause for them to battle for, nothing but lust, pride, and greed. A king took an army to war because he wanted to rule the earth. Another fought for revenge over a common, simple mistake. None of it was honest heroism, just macho displays of vengeance.Despite this, the film is very engaging at times, and many of the characters are enjoyable to watch. Hector and his beautiful wife, Paris internal struggles with cowardice, the grief of his father, even Achilles unusual character alterations. In one scene he's a warring madman, in another he's weeping for a fallen enemy. He says it is senseless to go to war and believes loss of life is terrible but deep down feeds his bloodlust. Its an impossible conflict of interest, an attempt to humanize a character you simply cannot root for. He does show great kindness to Briseis (even though he eventually seduces her) by allowing her to live, offering her freedom, and fighting for her protection on numerous occasions from Spartans. This aspect makes him much more likable, although when he ties the body of a fallen foe behind his chariot and races it through the encampment, some of our liking for him fades.Because of this, as well as some lengthy pacing issues and an abominable soundtrack (all except for the closing song by Josh Groban) Troy is not very memorable. There are few remarkable aspects. The costuming is very rich and the acting is quite good. The leading cast, particularly Peter O'Toole are all very convincing. The problem then becomes an issue of which side to root for. The movie tries so hard to be fair to both sides that they alienate the audience. If the story were only about Helen and Paris, we could root for Helen and Paris. Instead were given glimpses into not only their romance, but Achilles relationship with his impressionable young cousin, his romance with Briseis, Priam's concerns for Troy, Homer and his wife, and the King of Spartans plans to rule the world. It would have been better to follow one or two threads. Characters also die out rapidly; some of the most beloved heroes fall beneath the blade, as well as the bad guys.Its entertaining and interesting but not quite gripping enough to forgive its flaws. Worth seeing once if you're a fan of the cast, but not a classic, and certainly has nothing to teach other than that mankind can be utterly cruel and foolish. That's the true tragedy of Troy.",3,A Decent Attempt,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,5666,"['When', 'Homer', 'wrote', 'classic', 'story', 'forbidden', 'love', 'great', 'folly', 'never', 'envisioned',

852042,AB9WCN34TY8CV,B0002Z0EXQ,Charles Sutherland,"[2, 4]","No, wait, that's the start of another epic, or at least almost.  This is a very sanitized version of the Iliad, and I give credit, it does say ""inspired by"" rather than adapted from.  Okay, Patroclus was not Achilles' cousin.  They had a different, Greek relationship, if you know what I mean.  So did many of the Greeks.  But you don't get that here.  For all the hours of male muscle and flesh one sees on the screen in this epic, you never get even the slightest hint that anything other than straighter-than-straight male bonding goes on between them.  Troy, the big villain in the Iliad, is the one you end up rooting for, because they are very homespun family values, rather than the politically corrupt but sexually correct Greeks, who are only interested in power and domination.  Leaving out the sacrifice of Agammemnon's daughter before they set sail was another bowing to family sensibilities.  The ending is also rather cleaned up - for the wanton destruction of a city, there is remarkably little violence.There was no Cassandra here, and no idea that Paris didn't grow up side by side with Hector, but was in fact a great fighter in his own right.  Didn't he actually defeat Hector in the actual story of the Iliad?Brad Pitt is looking more buff than ever here, and Eric Bana may not be the Incredible Hulk any more, but he did look very incredible in this epic.  All the people were stylish.  Sean Bean looked different, but then, he looks different in everything he ever plays in.  Brian Cox did a great job with an overblown Agammemnon, but it is too bad that isn't how Agammemnon is supposed to be played.  Orlando Bloom looked very out of character, but maybe I'm just used to the Lord of the Rings presentation, where he is much more a self-confident and capable character.  Peter O'Toole was fabulous, but then, when isn't he?  The female roles, even the cause, Helen was-this-the-face-that-launched-a-thousand-ships of Troy, were not significant here.  This is a male film from first to last.Wolfgana Petersen the director has been accused of being crazy, a charge he doesn't always deny.  There is fine line between genius and insanity, and there is both in this film.  The creative wonders on many levels are astonishing, and it probably takes someone a little off the edge to come up with the funds and the commitment to so massive a project.  For all its faults, and there are many, it is still a great film.  The city scenes, the battle scenes, and the construction of the Greek ships and the great horse carted into the city are really well done - I heard Petersen got the idea from seeing a gorilla made of old auto tires -- look at the texture of the horse, it does look that way, doesn't it?A good film, I won't be surprised if it wins a few awards.

I also didn't like the inclusion of borrowed themes from other movie scores (such as Planet of the Apes) to replace James Horner's at many times of this new version.  If any new music was to be included, they should have used the amazing trailer themes which were completely ignored in the theatrical score; this was a perfect opportunity to put them into the film.It still feels like a movie that tries too hard to be epic and serious in so many levels, and somehow fails.

852047,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B0002Z0EXQ,Chris,"[6, 9]","The classic interpretation of Homer's ""The Illiad"" comes to life in Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy.""  The story is about a young Trojan named Paris who steals a Greek king's wife, Helen (you know, the face that launched a thousand ships!).  Anyways, the Greeks use this as an excuse to conquer the city of Troy, the city whose walls have never fallen to foreign nations.  The Greeks get the warrior Achilles to fight on their side.  The Trojans and the Greeks fight.  The Greeks make a horse with troops inside, in order to enter the walls of Troy and open its doors to the rest of their troops and eventually conquer Troy.  That is the quick overview of the story without revealing too many turning points of the storyline.Brad Pitt plays the role of Achilles.  Achilles fought this war in order to be remembered throughout the ages, not because he believed in the Greeks cause.  He does a very good job at this role and I believed that he is a great warrior.  Eric Bana played Hector, the leader of the Trojan army and a prince of Troy.  Hector was my favorite character of the movie.  He is a very honorable man and well respected.  He stayed true to his country and his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, the person who basically started this whole war.  I was really hoping that Paris would get his in the end.  I just thought that his character was too romantic and didn't care that thousands of people would die so he could have his fling.The most impressive aspect of this movie was Peterson's direction.  I like how he made Achilles have some emotional scenes and have some human aspects to him, instead of being some inhuman killing machine.  The battle sequences in the movie flashed from scene to scene a little too quick for me.  But the highlight were the greatly choreographed individual fight scences, especially the one between Hector and Achilles.  The big battle scenes looked very good and the CGI was not bothersome.This movie is extremely good.  It is very well acted, well directed and the movie moved at a good pace.  The movie is about 2 hours and 40 mins. long and it really doesn't feel like it.  There is a lot of good action in this movie and the storyline is very interested, even if you've read the story and know whats going to happen.

Also, the movie completely alters the nature of several death scenes (or eliminates the death scenes altogether), which will bother people who enjoy the play.  The movie focuses much more on Achilles and his own troubles/relationships than it does on Helen and the war fought for her.Casting Helen of Troy is pretty tricky, especially when people will have such high expectations of her beauty.  Diane Kruger, while pretty, failed to meet my expectations as a woman of enough captivating beauty and personality to launch ten thousand ships.  Her bland acting and monotone delivery makes her even more unattractive, and I could feel nothing between her and Paris.  Orlando Bloom looks the part of Paris - young, na've, pretty-boy - but his acting is nearly as bad as Kruger's.  He is totally unconvincing in all of his scenes.  Other supporting characters, like Hector (Eric Bana), King Priam (Peter O'Toole), and Odysseus (Sean Bean), are excellent in their few scenes, saving the movie from being a complete dud.  Also, much commotion has been made of Brad Pitt's naked behind, and it's a very nice-looking one, but frankly, I am a bit scornful of his performance as Achilles.  He certainly looks the part, but I can't believe how corny he made his lines sound!  This is too bad, because Pitt is normally a pretty great actor.However, the corniness of his delivery may be partially blamed on the terrible dialogue.  A line like ""Immortality!  Seize it, it's yours!"" is only one of the many very bad, cheesy lines in this movie, and the movie consequently plays out too soap-opera-ish and too...superficial.  There is none of the human pathos (with the exception of Peter O'Toole's scene) that is present in abundance in Homer's story.  The movie is also visually unexciting.  The CGI is overblown and uninteresting; it looks so artificial and grandiose that, instead of being ""epic"", it looks rushed and childish.  To the movie's credit, though, there are some good fight scenes, notably the one between Achilles and Hector.  It is also probably the best because real actors are employed, not computer-generated troops.Worth a rental, I suppose, but don't expect too much.

I didn't even like it but every film that looks like a period piece is all of a sudden fodder for ""not better than Gladiator"" comments. While Troy is more of a spectacle than that film, it's still not a powerhouse the film wants to be.The basics of Troy, based loosely or exactly depending on how you're watching, on Homer's poem The Iliad, a way too long poem about an affair between Paris, prince of Troy and Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. After a celebration of Troy and Sparta being friends, the people from Troy hed back home, bringing Helen with them. Menelaus finds out, plays the anger-stricken husband so what does he do? What any other man would do: get the king of Greece, Agememnon, to command an army against Troy of course.Among the king's warriors is Achilles, a well-known and arrogant soldier. While all soldiers are loyal to the king, he questions him, like why would the king send tens of thousands of men just for a girl, or Troy's beliefs in the gods. Among Troy's ranks are Hector, another well-known soldier but less arrogant and more reluctant to fight if the case doesn't call for it. After the opening arrival on the beach, Achilles captures Bresias, an Apollo server, who he ends up falling for.It's funny how the basics of the film are 2 kids deciding to love each other and run away together only to bring death and mayhem in doing so. A huge epic story told through the eyes of teenagers not thinking things through clearly.As for the performances, the only 3 I liked were Peter O'Toole, playing the king of Troy; Rose Byrne(Bresias), who somehow manages to make a so-so film worth watching and make you feel symphathetic towards like in Wicker Park, even if she's vastly underused. The last one being Eric Bana, who was rather bland in Hulk, but gives the right amount of pathos and energy to a very static character. As for the others? Well, as for the 2 lovers, you wouldn't be able to stomach their performances on a bad NBC show, let alone here.As far as the effects are concerned, maybe Lord of the Rings spoiled me but seeing 70,000 men fight doesn't have that wowness that Pelennor Fields battle had in Return of the King. And of course, right before the battle we get another ""they will never take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" wannabe pre-battle speech, which is getting more and more common since Braveheart's release.All in all, you want to like this film for the amount of time and effort that was put into it, but like a car, it's got to perform well no matter how it looks and this let's say breaks down half the time.",3,The woman that launched a thousand ships...and a so-so movie,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2722,"['reason', 'Gladiator', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'been', 'uber-epic', 'fix', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'storytelling', 'rooted', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'film', 'period', 'piece', 'sudden', 'fodder', 'not', 'better', 'Gladiator', 'comments', 'Troy', 'more', 'spectacle', 'film', 'still', 'not', 'powerhouse', 'film', 'be.The', 'basics', 'Troy', 'based', 'loosely', 'exactly', 'depending', 'how', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Homer', 'poem', 'Iliad', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'poem', 'affair', 'Paris', 'prince', 'Troy', 'Helen', 'wife', 'Menelaus', 'king', 'Sparta', 'celebration', 'Troy', 'Sparta', 'being', 'friends', 'people', 'Troy', 'hed', 'back', 'home', 'bringing', 'Helen', 'Menelaus', 'out', 'anger-stricken', 'husband', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'What', 'other', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'get', 'king', 'Greece', 'Agememnon', 'command', 'army', 'Troy', 'course.Among', 'king', 'warriors', 'Achilles', 'well-known', 'arrogant', 'soldier', 'soldiers', 'are', 'loyal', 'king', 'questions', 'why', 'would', 'king', 'send', 'tens', 'thousands', 'men', 'just', 'girl', 'Troy', 'beliefs', 'gods', 'Troy', 'ranks', 'are', 'Hector', 'well-known', 'soldier', 'less', 'arrogant', 'more', 'reluctant', 'fight', 'case', ""n't"", 'call', 'opening', 'arrival', 'beach', 'Achilles', 'Bresias', 'Apollo', 'server', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'for.It', 'funny', 'how', 'basics', 'film', 'are', '2', 'kids', 'deciding', 'love', 'other', 'run', 'away', 'together', 'only', 'bring', 'death', 'mayhem', 'doing', 'so', 'huge', 'epic', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'teenagers', 'not', 'thinking', 'things', 'clearly.As', 'performances', 'only', '3', 'liked', 'were', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'playing', 'king', 'Troy', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Bresias', 'who', 'somehow', 'make', 'so-so', 'film', 'watching', 'make', 'feel', 'symphathetic', 'towards', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'even', 'vastly', 'underused', 'last', 'one', 'being', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'bland', 'Hulk', 'right', 'amount', 'pathos', 'energy', 'very', 'static', 'character', 'others', 'Well', '2', 'lovers', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stomach', 'performances', 'bad', 'NBC', 'show', 'let', 'alone', 'here.As', 'far', 'effects', 'are', 'concerned', 'maybe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'spoiled', 'seeing', '70,000', 'men', 'fight', ""n't"", 'have', 'wowness', 'Pelennor', 'Fields', 'battle', 'had', 'Return', 'King', 'course', 'right', 'battle', 'get', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'lives', ""'ll"", 'never', 'take', 'freedom', 'pre-battle', 'speech', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'common', 'Braveheart', 'release.All', 'want', 'like', 'film', 'amount', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'car', 'got', 'perform', 'well', 'matter', 'how', 'let', 'say', 'breaks', 'down', 'time']",N/A

IN the film....), everyone speaks with a British accent, except Brad Pitt....which wouldn't be that bad if he wasnt the STAR OF THE FILM.And then there are the extras who play sailors....who for reasons I cant quite understand seem to be speaking Greek....when the rest of the GREEKS are speaking English with a British accent....well...except Brad Pitt.In one scene, Achilles (Pitt) and his cousin (?) sparr with swords among majestic Greek ruins next to a beautiful blue sea....and I actually hit pause to scream at the screen, ""Idiots!!! It would have been a BUILDING then! Not RUINS!"".The real Trojan War lasted over ten years....this filmed version appears to last two weeks...with a days break here and there to allow the main characters to look suitably attractive on the beach...and you have very little if any idea of the loss of life on each side.... in short, this movie is pure unadulterated drivel. Youre asked to care about what began the war (you don't), you're asked to believe Brad Pitt's Achilles is smoldering and brooding (you can't), and youre expected to come away with the knowledge that for thousands of years this was considered the greatest war of all time (you won't).However much was spent in making this film was wasted.",1,I can't get this 2 hours and 40 minutes of my life back.,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1971,"['havent', 'gotten', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'angry', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'course', 'took', 'film', 'Troy', 'remind', 'what', 'was', 'like.Let', 'start', 'saying', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'slightly', 'misted', 'sweat', 'looking', 'pretty', 'then', 'turn', 'sound', 'down', 'grab', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'means', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'costuming', 'ignore', 'rest', 'review.BUT', 'expect', 'even', 'one', 'iota', 'more', 'movie', '..dont', 'waste', 'time', '.I', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'fact', 'cant', 'get', '2', 'hours', '40', 'odd', 'minutes', 'life', 'wasted', 'here', 'back.The', 'dialogue', 'insipid', 'actually', 'left', 'line', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'sir', 'wife', 'left', 'Trojans', 'film', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'British', 'accent', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '.which', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'wasnt', 'STAR', 'OF', 'THE', 'FILM.And', 'then', 'are', 'extras', 'who', 'play', 'sailors', '.who', 'reasons', 'cant', 'quite', 'understand', 'seem', 'be', 'speaking', 'Greek', 'rest', 'GREEKS', 'are', 'speaking', 'English', 'British', 'accent', '.well', 'Brad', 'Pitt.In', 'one', 'scene', 'Achilles', 'Pitt', 'cousin', 'sparr', 'swords', 'majestic', 'Greek', 'ruins', 'beautiful', 'blue', 'sea', '.and', 'actually', 'hit', 'pause', 'scream', 'screen', 'Idiots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'BUILDING', 'then', 'Not', 'RUINS', '.The', 'real', 'Trojan', 'War', 'lasted', 'over', 'ten', 'years', '.this', 'filmed', 'version', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'days', 'break', 'here', 'there', 'allow', 'main', 'characters', 'look', 'suitably', 'attractive', 'beach', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'loss', 'life', 'side', 'short', 'movie', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'drivel', 'Youre', 'asked', 'care', 'what', 'began', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'asked', 'believe', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'smoldering', 'brooding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'youre', 'expected', 'come', 'away', 'knowledge', 'thousands', 'years', 'was', 'considered', 'greatest', 'war', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", '.However', 'much', 'was', 'spent', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'wasted']",N/A
852055,AUCISQA1YXX86,B0002Z0EXQ,Confederate,"[1, 1]","Lawrance Bernabo's review of Troy mirrors many of my own views and disappointments in this cinematic adaptation of the classic story between the nation states of Greece and Troy. And though it's not unusual for aspects of the story to change to accommodate another medium, why do it if it's not necessary? That was one of my main objections to the film.Another is when characters depart from an otherwise reasonable course of behavior. Priam, sending his two sons to Sparta to negotiate a long-sought peace treaty, shows absolutely no anger or even annoyance when his sons return with the wife of the Spartan king! Wouldn't one expect Priam to lose his temper at the gross irresponsibility of Paris in wrecking the said alliance and bringing a potentially ruinous war and siege of the city? Instead, he immediately greets Helen with all the warmth of a future in-law without being in the least perturbed. This goes beyond mere license and puts the viewer in a completely unnecessary situation of suspending disbelief. So why did it happen? I understand the script writer needing to transition to acceptance, but the transition was too quick, too unbelievable and too contrived.There also is no way to justify the treachery of Paris' action. As Priam was too quick to accept it, so, too was Hector. Both situation demand indignation. This isn't the first time Paris had behaved in this manner, and this time it meant war and the loss of Troy's fair sons. Yet it's handled in much the same manner as if the purloined object was a water bottle, not a man's wife. Whatever nobility Priam and Hector may of had was lost by their reckless disregard of the situation. Hector's spontaneous slaying of Menelaus also was a blight upon his nobility. By the time Achilles comes to seek vengeance, one has had enough of both Hector and Paris. I only regret that Achilles didn't slay Paris at the same time.I have no problems with the computerized battles, but people never respond as they should. Before Hector is slain, Priam could have ordered the archers to unleash their volley on Achilles, but Hector stopped him with no explanation. Was he being noble? Ha! Any nobility was long gone by his previous behavior. And after Hector's death, he could have ordered the archers to keep him from dragging Hector's body away, but again, the writers hope you won't notice. Wouldn't it have been better to have them unleash their arrows and have them fail to hit the Greek hero, volley after volley? That would have appealed to me far more, plus it would have hinted divine intervention, which was too much lacking in this production.Still, even with its lamentable faults, the movie is still well worth owning and watching. It's just a shame that the opportunities were missed. Hollywood should know better, but its contempt for reality is too often obvious in its productions.Director's Cut: The added scenes really round out the Director's Cut. Achilles battle on the beach, the small but well rounded character insights--they all are improvements. In the Theatrical Cut, Achilles makes a brief impression, but almost immediately leaves the fight. The extended scenes give us a better glimpse of why he was the greatest of the Greeks and why Agamemnon was the most arrogant.Of particular merit was Sean Bean's outstanding portrayal of Odysseus. He is worthy of a sequel as the Ithacan king who stayed away too long from his wife and kingdom.Some don't approve of the deeschatologizing of the story, but I've never much cared for the way the gods stole glory from the heroes. And there's the line by Achilles to Briseis that he knew more than the priests about the gods, because he had seen them. That's all the mention they deserved.",4,Director's Cut Better Than Theatrical,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3717,"['Lawrance', 'Bernabo', 'review', 'Troy', 'mirrors', 'many', 'own', 'views', 'disappointments', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'story', 'nation', 'states', 'Greece', 'Troy', 'not', 'unusual', 'aspects', 'story', 'change', 'accommodate', 'medium', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'necessary', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'objections', 'film.Another', 'when', 'characters', 'depart', 'otherwise', 'reasonable', 'course', 'behavior', 'Priam', 'sending', 'two', 'sons', 'Sparta', 'negotiate', 'long-sought', 'peace', 'treaty', 'absolutely', 'anger', 'even', 'annoyance', 'when', 'sons', 'return', 'wife', 'Spartan', 'king', 'Would', ""n't"", 'one', 'expect', 'Priam', 'lose', 'temper', 'gross', 'irresponsibility', 'Paris', 'wrecking', 'said', 'alliance', 'bringing', 'potentially', 'ruinous', 'war', 'siege', 'city', 'Instead', 'immediately', 'Helen', 'warmth', 'future', 'in-law', 'being', 'least', 'perturbed', 'mere', 'license', 'viewer', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'situation', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'why', 'did', 'happen', 'understand', 'script', 'writer', 'needing', 'transition', 'acceptance', 'transition', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'too', 'contrived.There', 'also', 'way', 'justify', 'treachery', 'Paris', 'action', 'Priam', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'accept', 'so', 'too', 'was', 'Hector', 'situation', 'demand', 'indignation', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'Paris', 'had', 'behaved', 'manner', 'time', 'meant', 'war', 'loss', 'Troy', 'fair', 'sons', 'handled', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'purloined', 'object', 'was', 'water', 'bottle', 'not', 'man', 'wife', 'nobility', 'Priam', 'Hector', 'may', 'had', 'was', 'lost', 'reckless', 'disregard', 'situation', 'Hector', 'spontaneous', 'slaying', 'Menelaus', 'also', 'was', 'blight', 'nobility', 'time', 'Achilles', 'seek', 'vengeance', 'one', 'had', 'enough', 'Hector', 'Paris', 'only', 'regret', 'Achilles', 'did', ""n't"", 'slay', 'Paris', 'same', 'time.I', 'have', 'problems', 'computerized', 'battles', 'people', 'never', 'respond', 'should', 'Hector', 'slain', 'Priam', 'could', 'have', 'ordered', 'archers', 'unleash', 'volley', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'stopped', 'explanation', 'being', 'noble', 'Ha', 'nobility', 'was', 'long', 'gone', 'previous', 'behavior', 'Hector', 'death', 'could', 'have', 'ordered', 'archers', 'keep', 'dragging', 'Hector', 'body', 'away', 'again', 'writers', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'unleash', 'arrows', 'have', 'fail', 'hit', 'Greek', 'hero', 'volley', 'volley', 'would', 'have', 'appealed', 'far', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'hinted', 'divine', 'intervention', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'lacking', 'production.Still', 'even', 'lamentable', 'faults', 'movie', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'watching', 'just', 'shame', 'opportunities', 'were', 'missed', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'contempt', 'reality', 'too', 'often', 'obvious', 'productions.Director', 'Cut', 'added', 'scenes', 'really', 'round', 'out', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Achilles', 'battle', 'beach', 'small', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'insights', 'are', 'improvements', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'Achilles', 'brief', 'impression', 'almost', 'immediately', 'fight', 'extended', 'scenes', 'give', 'better', 'glimpse', 'why', 'was', 'greatest', 'Greeks', 'why', 'Agamemnon', 'was', 'most', 'arrogant.Of', 'particular', 'merit', 'was', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'outstanding', 'portrayal', 'Odysseus', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'Ithacan', 'king', 'who', 'stayed', 'away', 'too', 'long', 'wife', 'kingdom.Some', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'deeschatologizing', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'much', 'cared', 'way', 'gods', 'stole', 'glory', 'heroes', 'line', 'Achilles', 'Briseis', 'knew', 'more', 'priests', 'gods', 'had', 'seen', 'mention', 'deserved']",N/A

The movie was visually stunning, however, it was far too long in duration and at times boring.  History purists will cringe at the liberties taken with Homer's ""The Iliad"".The acting for the most part was adequate.  Veteran actor Peter O'Toole playing Trojan king Priam excelled and might walk off with a long overdue Oscar.  I had no problem with a buffed Brad Pitt as a pensive and brooding Achilles.  Eric Bana playing Hector gave a commendable performance.  Rose Byrne did well as Breisis and was more attractive than Diane Kruger, the gal who launched a thousand ships, Helen.  Brian Cox as Agamemnon was obnoxious but on second thought maybe he was meant to be.

852057,A3NPPOHPRZG0JC,B0002Z0EXQ,Cristina Galdames,"[3, 4]","This film is from the german director Wolfgang Petersen, the director of the great film The Boat.  This film isn't near to how good the another is, but it is still a good film.It is long, that's true, but it is entertaining enough and it does not feel too long. The battle scenes are maybe not the most entertainig ones, since the historical facts are a little limitating.  I would give three stars to this film, but its anti-belic message worths to me at last a whole star. They present battles in a very human way, not like in Gladiator and less like in Master and Commander.  The director respectfully mantains his anti-belic message.  Is something admirable in a film about a war, and specially in an american film.Apart from that, the best of the movie is the development of Achilles' and Hector's characters, specially Hector's.  The work of both actors is very good also.  And the development of the relationships between Hector and Paris, between both brothers and their father, Hector and his wife, Aquilles and Briseis.The weak parts are the development of the relationships between Achilles and Patroclus, and Paris and Helen.  Considering this last relationship is the one which produces the war, it is extremely little developed, both characters sharing little screen toghether.  One just don't belive Paris risks all he risks for her.  One don't see how they fall in love.And Achilles and Pathroclus, they share two scenes toghether.  This relation is very poorly developed too.  One don't understand that ""the only man who can controle Achilles is Patroclus"" as the film says.  Neither do one understands that Achilles is so upset because of what happens to Patroclus.  If they would have make him Achilles lover, it would have been more understandable.  Or, at last, they could have developed much more this relationship as they presented it.Anyway, it is a good film, I do recommend it.",4,Good film,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,1903,"['film', 'german', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'director', 'great', 'film', 'Boat', 'film', ""n't"", 'near', 'how', 'good', 'still', 'good', 'film.It', 'long', 'true', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'not', 'feel', 'too', 'long', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'maybe', 'not', 'most', 'entertainig', 'ones', 'historical', 'facts', 'are', 'little', 'limitating', 'would', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'anti-belic', 'message', 'worths', 'last', 'whole', 'star', 'present', 'battles', 'very', 'human', 'way', 'not', 'Gladiator', 'less', 'Master', 'Commander', 'director', 'respectfully', 'anti-belic', 'message', 'something', 'admirable', 'film', 'war', 'specially', 'american', 'film.Apart', 'best', 'movie', 'development', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'characters', 'specially', 'Hector', 'work', 'actors', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'development', 'relationships', 'Hector', 'Paris', 'brothers', 'father', 'Hector', 'wife', 'Aquilles', 'Briseis.The', 'weak', 'parts', 'are', 'development', 'relationships', 'Achilles', 'Patroclus', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'Considering', 'last', 'relationship', 'one', 'war', 'extremely', 'little', 'developed', 'characters', 'sharing', 'little', 'screen', 'toghether', 'One', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'belive', 'Paris', 'risks', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'fall', 'love.And', 'Achilles', 'Pathroclus', 'share', 'two', 'scenes', 'toghether', 'relation', 'very', 'poorly', 'developed', 'too', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'controle', 'Achilles', 'Patroclus', 'film', 'do', 'one', 'Achilles', 'so', 'upset', 'what', 'Patroclus', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'Achilles', 'lover', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'understandable', 'last', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'much', 'more', 'relationship', 'presented', 'it.Anyway', 'good', 'film', 'do', 'recommend']",N/A

The landscapes and backdrops are jaw-droppingly beautiful. That said, lets focus on the movie itself. Wolfgang Peterson took many, many departures from the legend of Troy in this film, and gave a timeless story from the ages a well-worn soap-opera feel. The action sequences were obviously well-planned and are truthfully quite spectacular. If only everyone hadn't seen the Lord of the Rings films, with their very superior army clash sequences. It was as if the fights had been seen before, although the Achilles fights were notable highlights. I bring special notice to Peter O'Toole here, for he brought a special dignity and grace to King Priam, and Eric Bana does a fine job as Hector. Brad Pitt was noticeably very buff in the role of Achilles, although he seemed a bit too much on the pouty side for a great warrior of the ages. Diane Kruger as Helen may have been a bit in over her head here. She honestly didn't have much to do here, except appear here and there in the story.

When I sat down to watch the greatly anticipated ""full screen"" I couldn't believe my eyes or my ears. Some the very most important dialog had been cut; the musical score had been changed in some scenes to something one would expect to hear in the common variety battle scenes of a ""B"" movie....instead of the unique, stirring, notes that remain with you long after the film has ended. The dialog? I'll give you the most damaging deletion in the film....THE pivotal lines that gave Achilles his powerful purpose and reason for going to Troy...he chose glory AND doom, and KNEW what it was he chose and how it would end for him. It was his complete conversation with his mother on the beach as she gathered sea shells. At the movies beginning, a young boy tells Achilles it is said Achilles' mother is an immortal God. We know from Greek Mythology Achilles was dipped in water as an infant....that anywhere on his body the water touched could not be injured to the point of causing his death. His mother held by the heel as she dipped him in the water....his heel was not covered with water and was his only weakness. She was a Goddess.....one who could see into the future. It is this reason Achilles comes to talk to her before deciding whether to go to Troy. The lines that were cut came after she said his glory and doom would come together. He asks her ""You KNOW this to be true, Mother?"" (No mistake? No mother's attempt to keep him home?you see this in the future?) She answered, "" I KNOW this."". Consider these lines...really consider them, THEN watch Troy again. There are other cuts in dialog that dilute the character and, if you will, also the full robust/richness of the other salient characters. The story it's self is the stuff of legends and myths, and is perhaps a tribute to one man's series of mistakes in judgment, King Priam. His son, Hector was commander of his armies...but he never ONCE listens to his counsel...opting to chose the exact opposite. And by the way....he gives Paris the ""sword of Troy"" to fight with....what about giving it to Hector as he goes out to fight. Achilles? Hector is the only souce of wisedom and solid common sense, millitary savvy in Troy. One wonders if King Priam finally ""gets it"" as he watches Troy being burned to the ground. Buy the wide screen version, you will enjoy and become enthralled in it's mastery and magic.BTW...the color and sharpness of the full screen version is also really crummy....sub-standard. OK...I am being too practical here. But can you imagine the volume of fish caught to feed 50,000 men a day?

852063,A2DRCJ1YOFTZKK,B0002Z0EXQ,Dana,"[17, 20]","It's a credit to the quality and immortality of this story that although it was written more than 2000 years ago, it still interests modern audience. There are quite few stories that can do that, and the story of the Trojan war is one of them.This adaptation for cinema fails because it doesn't manage to add anything new to the story. It doesn't enhance it it any way, doesn't make it bigger, and in fact changes some things in a bad way. It is not overall a very bad movie, but it is certainly not a very good one either.Some fundamental changes include:1. The Trojan war lasted 10 years -- in the movie it lasts only a couple of weeks. Well, this is one change I can understand and accept - I don't think they could have made a movie spanning 10 years and still manage to keep today's audience, used with high-speed in everything, interested. Still, it takes away a fundamental part of that which made the war so important.2. They leave out the gods and their meddling in human affairs entirely. I think they did it for simplicity and also to appeal to modern audiences, and I can live with this as well. It appeals even better to me that we get to make our own decisions without any divine intervention, and that only we are responsible for our choices.3. They change the fate of some characters, and I will not get into details. This part -- well, they say that the b\movie was ""inspired"" by the Odyssey, so I guess that justifies it, but still... hm. If you never read the original story, it won't bother you, though.4. And a ""historic"" note: in the 14th century b.c. they were not Greeks, they were Acheans (possible mispelling, I'm not sure the word exists in English). But the term Greek did not exist until much later, and they certainly did not refer to themselves as Greek, and there certainly was no Greece (as a country). This is a definite mistake and it could have been easily avoided.Now we get to the bad part. More than half of the cast was miscast and they do not manage to build convincing characters.The worst of all was Brad Pitt. B.P. is one of my favourite actors and I think he is one of the best of his generation, but he's just no Achilles. (First of all because of his looks -- blond and blue/green eyed.) This role reminded me of him in Legends of the Fall -- the same type of jaded outcast, slightly shaggy, with an eye for women, the eternal unadapted. He's just so... American. There's nothing heroic about his presence, no grandeur.Then. Helen -- also blond! I understand they picked the actress because she was Elite Model of some year and because she was not a known face. But she doesn't act. You just don't notice her as a presence, Andromaca stands out more than her.Also -- Orlando Bloom as Paris. He's been on the rise ever since LOTR and I have no problem with that. But he would have made a wonderful Patrocles, not Paris. Patrocles is a pivotal character and the guy playing him is weak and unnoticeable. Orlando Bloom would have been a perfect Patrocles, and even as Paris he acts like a Patrocles -- impulsive, with that deer-eyed face.Thumbs-up though to Peter O'Toole as Priam -- really intense and regal. And also Hector, he's the only one who really looks his part, I don't think they could have picked a better face.Leaving this apart, some scenes were wonderfully done and really kept the audience at the edge of their seats. The duel between Paris and Menelaus is one of them, the duel between Hector and Achilles is another, and of course the wonderful scene when Priam visits Achilles.And they even managed not to make the fights look like a Matrix-rerun all over, which unfortunately is the tendency these days -- although the first time Achilles fights the king of Thessaly, there is a camera move which was Matrix-like. The other hand-to-hand combats were just like they should have been.Overall, you can see this movie -- but don't except it will touch you any deeper.",3,"Whatever good there is, it's in the story",1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,3927,"['credit', 'quality', 'immortality', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'more', '2000', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'interests', 'modern', 'audience', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'stories', 'can', 'do', 'story', 'Trojan', 'war', 'one', 'them.This', 'adaptation', 'cinema', 'fails', ""n't"", 'manage', 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'story', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'way', ""n't"", 'make', 'bigger', 'fact', 'changes', 'things', 'bad', 'way', 'not', 'overall', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'either.Some', 'fundamental', 'changes', 'include:1', 'Trojan', 'war', 'lasted', '10', 'years', 'movie', 'only', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Well', 'one', 'change', 'can', 'understand', 'accept', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'spanning', '10', 'years', 'still', 'manage', 'keep', 'today', 'audience', 'used', 'high-speed', 'everything', 'interested', 'Still', 'away', 'fundamental', 'part', 'made', 'war', 'so', 'important.2', 'leave', 'out', 'gods', 'meddling', 'human', 'affairs', 'entirely', 'think', 'did', 'simplicity', 'also', 'appeal', 'modern', 'audiences', 'can', 'live', 'as', 'well', 'appeals', 'even', 'better', 'get', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'divine', 'intervention', 'only', 'are', 'responsible', 'choices.3', 'change', 'fate', 'characters', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'details', 'part', 'well', 'say', 'b\\movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'Odyssey', 'guess', 'justifies', 'still', 'hm', 'never', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'though.4', 'historic', 'note', '14th', 'century', 'b.c', 'were', 'not', 'Greeks', 'were', 'Acheans', 'possible', 'mispelling', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'word', 'English', 'term', 'Greek', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'much', 'later', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'refer', 'Greek', 'certainly', 'was', 'Greece', 'country', 'definite', 'mistake', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'get', 'bad', 'part', 'More', 'half', 'cast', 'was', 'miscast', 'do', 'not', 'manage', 'build', 'convincing', 'characters.The', 'worst', 'was', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'B.P', 'one', 'favourite', 'actors', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'generation', 'just', 'Achilles', 'First', 'looks', 'blond', 'blue/green', 'eyed', 'role', 'reminded', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'same', 'type', 'jaded', 'outcast', 'slightly', 'shaggy', 'eye', 'women', 'eternal', 'unadapted', 'just', 'so', 'American', 'nothing', 'heroic', 'presence', 'grandeur.Then', 'Helen', 'also', 'blond', 'understand', 'picked', 'actress', 'was', 'Elite', 'Model', 'year', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'face', ""n't"", 'act', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'presence', 'Andromaca', 'out', 'more', 'her.Also', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'been', 'rise', 'ever', 'LOTR', 'have', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'Patrocles', 'not', 'Paris', 'Patrocles', 'pivotal', 'character', 'guy', 'playing', 'weak', 'unnoticeable', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'Patrocles', 'even', 'Paris', 'Patrocles', 'impulsive', 'deer-eyed', 'face.Thumbs-up', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'really', 'intense', 'regal', 'also', 'Hector', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'face.Leaving', 'apart', 'scenes', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'really', 'kept', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'duel', 'Paris', 'Menelaus', 'one', 'duel', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'course', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'when', 'Priam', 'visits', 'Achilles.And', 'even', 'managed', 'not', 'make', 'fights', 'look', 'Matrix-rerun', 'unfortunately', 'tendency', 'days', 'first', 'time', 'Achilles', 'king', 'Thessaly', 'camera', 'move', 'was', 'Matrix-like', 'other', 'hand-to-hand', 'combats', 'were', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'been.Overall', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'except', 'will', 'touch', 'deeper']",N/A

852065,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0002Z0EXQ,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 3]","""Inspired"" by Homer's Iliad is right.  Homer, Sophocles, Aeschylus, and other poets would be beseeching Zeus and the Olympian gods for justice had they been able to view Troy, which scores well in panoramic shots requiring digital graphics and certain battle scenes.  Things start out all right from the time Paris kidnaps the Spartan queen Helen for his bride and spirits her to Troy.  Menelaus enlists the aid of his brother Agamemnon of Mycenae, Odysseus of Ithaca, and Achilles of the Myrmidons.  Helen is a blonde Barbie doll here, and I'd launch three ships and a canoe after Diane Kruger, but never a thousand ships, the sight of which is an impressive spectacle courtesy of the usual digital graphics.Brian Cox really hams it up as Agamemnon, an odious, power-mad king wanting to control the Aegean, and he's drooling at an invasion of Troy, which he has wanted to conquer for ages.  Odysseus tells Achilles that in war, the older men engage in politics while the younger men die in battle.  Achilles, though, wants his name to be remembered for all time, and goes to war despite entreaties from his mother Thetis.The division of the Greeks caused by Agamemnon's seizure of Briseis from Achilles, and the Greeks take a beating from the Trojans because of Achilles ordering his Myrmidons not to fight.  But it shows the marked difference between the egotistic Achilles, who fights for himself, and the noble Hector, who's a loving family man with a wonderful wife, Andromache, and baby, loyal to his country, calling Troy every Trojan's mother whose honour is to be defended, and even to his younger brother, who starts the war with his stunt.  Hector knows what war is like and does not glorify or romanticize it.  He also observes the courtesy of allowing the Greeks to honour their dead.Having said that, things go okay until the proposed showdown between Paris and Menelaus, where an unforgivable liberty is taken with Homer's text.  All I'll say here is that in the Odyssey, Menelaus and Helen are known to be alive and well.  And Sophocles will have issues with what happens to Agamemnon later.Minor exclusions are forgivable, given the content of Homer's original text.  Major and unashamed alterations to the text are NOT!!  The exclusion of Hecuba, Priam's wife, Diomedes, Sarpedon, and the prophetress Cassandra, is puzzling, as these are key characters.  But the absence of the gods and goddesses, who took sides and made all sorts of mischief, is quite unsettling.The Iliad ends with the games done in honour of Hector's funeral, but not Troy, which helps further the misconception that the wooden horse is part of the Iliad, whereas it's actually part of the Aeneid.Veteran Peter O'Toole comes off the best as the noble King Priam, someone of honour, with Eric Bana as Hector coming in a close second.  Of the Greeks, Sean Bean comes off the best as the pragmatic Odysseus.  Brad Pitt does Achilles with the expected pretty-boy pouting--he's clearly there for the women to swoon over.  Andromache and Briseis are well portrayed by Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne respectively, showing that women suffer a lot in war.Conclusion:  the Troy here is a far cry from the city of Homer's Iliad or the city Heinrich Schliemann excavated, but the city Hollywood plagued with unforgivable inaccuracies.

852066,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B0002Z0EXQ,Daniel K.,"[0, 1]","Ok listen, I know what you're thinking, you think I'm probably crazy to give this movie a good review, but personally I enjoyed it.  Infact I saw it twice, once with my dad and the second time with my mother since my mom wasn't able to see it with us the first time.  I must say this film has plenty of problems, during the credits of Troy, it says that this film is inspired by Homer's The Illiad, which is very inaccurate.  Sure this film is enjoyable and entertaining but in order for it to be entertaining you have to ignore the fact that The Illiad even exists.But the $200 million budget of the film shows.  The cinematography is great, the sets are pretty extraodinary and the acting is decent.  Achilles is not a role made for Brad Pitt but I should point out that Pitt is a fine actor, this just isn't a role made for him.  While Brad Pitt does look the part he certainly isn't it, though I do commend him for his hard work in preparing for the physical aspects of the role, he just lacks grandiosity.  But you pretty much have to enjoy this as a Brad Pitt movie. Better movies with him include Fight Club and Se7en.  Eric Bana as Hector was very impressive infact his performance along with Peter O'Toole's performance as King Priam were the only really worthy ones.  Orlando BLoom as Paris and Diane Krueger as Helen, well enough said, I mean sure they look good but they just aren't convincing enough.  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson were fine though I should point out.This film wasn't horrific as some people view it to be.  I must say I did expect more considering that Wolfgang Petersen directed this film, he's made some great films such as Das Boot, Air Force One and In the Line of Fire, and The Perfect Storm was decent.  James Horner's score wasn't abhorrent as some people claim it to be, infact I didn't know that Gabriel Yared the original composer was fired.  The battle sequences were good, but they could've done more with them due to the fact that the battle sequences resulted in a one on one combat scene.The fight between Hector and Achilles was excellent though, the best one in the movie.  I'm not too sure to say if the battle sequences in this film were better than well let's say Return of the King's but they were definitely on par.  Gladiator is certainly a better epic, considering that Troy is pretty much a Gladiator wanna be.  Troy is historically confusing, overlong and lacking in parts, such as Petersen's decision to omit the Gods from the film.  This is a 2 hour and 40 minute film so I should warn you.  It's also not that bloody, Gladiator is a lot bloodier.  While Troy is entertaining it does have its problems,but call me insane but I might consider purchasing this film on DVD, but that's not for sure yet.Troy is rated R for Graphic Violence and Some Sexuality/Nudity.  The battles in Troy are aggressive and fiercebut aren't very graphic, there's some occasional blood.  The battles include the use of spears, arrows, swords, etc.  The sexual content isn't really explicit which was a let down, just kidding.  There was some steamy kissing, and partial nudity.

And am equally sorry to say that this movie did not live up to them. The only reason it is even remotely recieving four stars, is the fight scenes between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Also, Brad Pitt did his his role pretty well. Now for the complaints on this movie.First of all the movie seemed to forced. The dialogue was harsh and abrupt. Orlando Bloom doing better as a blonde arrow slinging elf than a hot sexy stud trying to win over Helen. Talking of Helen, I thought she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world!!!!!!?Now to talk about Orlando Bloom, er... complain. Paris, contrary to the movie where he was son to King Priam ruler of Troy, Paris was supposed to be nothing more than a humble goat herder!!! Big difference people. He went to Troy to escape the wrath of Helen's husband. Again, big difference.Ok, this brings us now to the dialogue. Whats up with Brad Pitt insulting the King by calling him a ""cask of wine?"" When was that ever an insult? Not just that, but the writing of the dialogue was definetly too American, it left me feeling more like  I was watching a cheap shot at something being Mythological.The only good thing  about this movie was the scene where Wolfang Peterson showed the wide camera view of the army outside of Troy. Now that was impressive. But then he went and ruined it by stealing from Peter Jackson's  shot in his last LOTR movie where Viggo Mortenson and his small army are surrounded by Suron's. Just before Frodo throws the ring into the fire. Hmmm, back to Troy.Brad Pitt did a wonderful job, he at least deserved an academy award, being the sexy, brooding Achilles. But again, Wolfgang ruined it by killing him off in the end. He already twisted facts around, so why not just smudge over history and let poor Achilles run off with his lover?Last question.

852068,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B0002Z0EXQ,"Dan ""Longsword""","[0, 0]","The line between epic spectacle and overblown bore is often as unclear as it is easily crossed. So it's no surprise that Wolfgang Petersen's Troy navigates that demarcation like a drunk driver on a twisty two-lane highway. There are times when Troy is stirring and engaging. However, at least as often, it is flat. There's really too much story to cram into a l65-minute period, yet, paradoxically, the movie seems longer than its bloated running length. And all of the visual majesty that hundreds of millions of dollars can buy cannot obscure the perfunctory and unsatisfying development of the major characters.Troy is loosely (and I emphasize loosely) based on Homer's epic poem ""The Illiad,"" which many educated viewers will have read once (probably in a high school literature class). David Benioff's screenplay keeps most of the places and names, but takes a lot of what could charitably call ""artistic license."" One of the more interesting changes is to place the Olympians in the background. Troy is a story of men alone, not of men and gods. The filmmakers wanted this movie to follow in the footsteps of Braveheart and Gladiator rather than Clash of the Titans. For my money, it's the right decision.Most viewers will recognize at least part of the story, which takes place around the year 1250 B.C. (Homer's poem is believed to have been composed about 400 years later). Helen of Sparta, the daughter of Zeus and a mortal, is said to be the most beautiful woman alive. When Paris of Troy accompanies his older brother, Hector, on a peace mission to Sparta, Paris and Helen fall for each other. The lovers flee to Troy and sanctuary while Helen's scorned husband, Menelaus, encourages his brother, Agamemnon, to rouse all of Greece to go to war with Troy. Led by the hero Achilles, the Greeks attack the walled city.With the possible exception of Hector, who is portrayed with depth and feeling by Eric Bana, the characters in Troy are paper-thin. The biggest disappointment is Brad Pitt's Achilles, whose miniscule personality is overwhelmed by his bronzed skin and bulging muscles. Despite having bulked up for the part, Pitt defines the term ""miscast."" Achilles is as lifeless a central figure as one is likely to find. Orlando Bloom's Paris and Diane Kruger's Helen fall into the same pretty but personality-free zone. The sparks are left to the veterans - in particular, Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam, who employs his limited screen time to fashion a memorable character. In the end, one wishes the film had been focused on the king of Troy rather than the Greek hero.Troy is chock-full of majestic battle scenes, none of which generate a whiff of energy or suspense. Some might argue that it's hard to make a battle exciting when the end is already known (those familiar with mythology know what happens when the Trojan Horse makes its appearance), but I disagree. I had read Tolkien's books long before viewing Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and was still riveted by the epic battle sequences. Likewise, my recognition of what happened at Gettysburg did not diminish my appreciation of Ronald Maxwell's historically accurate re-telling. What hurts Troy is that there's no imagination or energy to the battles. All we see is the clash between two largely faceless armies hacking at each other. The conflict, like many of the prominent characters, lacks a personality. Petersen's handling of the one-on-one fights (Paris vs. Menelaus, Hector vs. Ajax, Hector vs. Achilles) is more successful.Despite its shortcomings, there are things to appreciate about Troy, not the least of which is that it's aimed at adults, not children - a rarity amidst summer fare. And, since I'm inordinately fond of historically-based epics (even though little is known about the real Troy), I was entertained more often than not. But it seems to me that if a viewer is going to invest nearly three hours, he or she deserves more than what Troy delivers. The best epics work because they provide both visual spectacle and emotional resonance, and the second part of that equation is where Troy falls short. Tertiary love stories (such as the one between Achilles and a slave girl) and noble speeches aren't enough. Petersen understands the importance of believable characters, but, excepting Hector and Priam, he fails to bring these mythological figures to life on the screen. And that, more than anything else, proves to be this film's undoing.",2,A loosely movie for an epic story,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,4467,"['line', 'epic', 'spectacle', 'overblown', 'bore', 'often', 'as', 'unclear', 'easily', 'crossed', 'surprise', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Troy', 'demarcation', 'drunk', 'driver', 'twisty', 'two-lane', 'highway', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Troy', 'stirring', 'engaging', 'However', 'least', 'as', 'often', 'flat', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'cram', 'l65-minute', 'period', 'yet', 'paradoxically', 'movie', 'longer', 'bloated', 'running', 'length', 'visual', 'majesty', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'can', 'buy', 'can', 'not', 'obscure', 'perfunctory', 'unsatisfying', 'development', 'major', 'characters.Troy', 'loosely', 'emphasize', 'loosely', 'based', 'Homer', 'epic', 'poem', 'Illiad', 'many', 'educated', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'once', 'probably', 'high', 'school', 'literature', 'class', 'David', 'Benioff', 'screenplay', 'most', 'places', 'names', 'lot', 'what', 'could', 'charitably', 'call', 'artistic', 'license', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'changes', 'place', 'Olympians', 'background', 'Troy', 'story', 'men', 'alone', 'not', 'men', 'gods', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'movie', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator', 'rather', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'money', 'right', 'decision.Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'recognize', 'least', 'part', 'story', 'place', 'year', '1250', 'B.C', 'Homer', 'poem', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'composed', '400', 'years', 'later', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'daughter', 'Zeus', 'mortal', 'said', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'alive', 'When', 'Paris', 'Troy', 'older', 'brother', 'Hector', 'peace', 'mission', 'Sparta', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'fall', 'other', 'lovers', 'flee', 'Troy', 'sanctuary', 'Helen', 'scorned', 'husband', 'Menelaus', 'brother', 'Agamemnon', 'rouse', 'Greece', 'go', 'war', 'Troy', 'Led', 'hero', 'Achilles', 'Greeks', 'attack', 'walled', 'city.With', 'possible', 'exception', 'Hector', 'who', 'portrayed', 'depth', 'feeling', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'characters', 'Troy', 'are', 'paper-thin', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'miniscule', 'personality', 'overwhelmed', 'bronzed', 'skin', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'having', 'bulked', 'up', 'part', 'Pitt', 'term', 'miscast', 'Achilles', 'lifeless', 'central', 'figure', 'one', 'likely', 'find', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'fall', 'same', 'pretty', 'personality-free', 'zone', 'sparks', 'are', 'left', 'veterans', 'particular', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Troy', 'King', 'Priam', 'who', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'fashion', 'memorable', 'character', 'end', 'one', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'focused', 'king', 'Troy', 'rather', 'Greek', 'hero.Troy', 'chock-full', 'majestic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'none', 'generate', 'whiff', 'energy', 'suspense', 'might', 'argue', 'hard', 'make', 'battle', 'exciting', 'when', 'end', 'already', 'known', 'familiar', 'mythology', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'appearance', 'disagree', 'had', 'read', 'Tolkien', 'books', 'long', 'before', 'viewing', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adaptation', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'still', 'riveted', 'epic', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Likewise', 'recognition', 'what', 'happened', 'Gettysburg', 'did', 'not', 'diminish', 'appreciation', 'Ronald', 'Maxwell', 'historically', 'accurate', 're-telling', 'What', 'Troy', 'imagination', 'energy', 'battles', 'see', 'clash', 'two', 'largely', 'faceless', 'armies', 'hacking', 'other', 'conflict', 'many', 'prominent', 'characters', 'personality', 'Petersen', 'handling', 'one-on-one', 'fights', 'Paris', 'vs.', 'Menelaus', 'Hector', 'vs.', 'Ajax', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'more', 'successful.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'things', 'appreciate', 'Troy', 'not', 'least', 'aimed', 'adults', 'not', 'children', 'rarity', 'amidst', 'summer', 'fare', ""'m"", 'inordinately', 'fond', 'historically-based', 'epics', 'even', 'little', 'known', 'real', 'Troy', 'was', 'entertained', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'viewer', 'going', 'invest', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'more', 'what', 'Troy', 'delivers', 'best', 'epics', 'work', 'provide', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'second', 'part', 'equation', 'where', 'Troy', 'short', 'Tertiary', 'love', 'stories', 'such', 'one', 'Achilles', 'slave', 'girl', 'noble', 'speeches', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Petersen', 'importance', 'believable', 'characters', 'excepting', 'Hector', 'Priam', 'bring', 'mythological', 'figures', 'life', 'screen', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'be', 'film', 'undoing']",N/A
852069,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0002Z0EXQ,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[3, 6]","It seems like every couple of months there's a new film hyped as an epic--but they rarely live up to the billing. Such is the case with ""Troy,"" which is based on Homer's story ""The Illiad.""Most incarnations of this story have been devoted to the love affair between Trojan Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") and Spartan Queen Helen (Diana Kruger, ""Michael Valiant""), which sparked the decade-long war between the Trojans and Greeks. But screenwriter David Benioff (""The 25th Hour"") focuses this saga on the warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"").Casting Pitt in the role of Achilles seemed odd for a number of reasons, not the least of which is Pitt's boy-next-door looks. He could have just as easily been cast as Trojan general Hector--played magnificently by Eric Bana (""Hulk"")--as in the role of the brooding, glory-hunting Achilles.Maybe Warner Bros. figured the best way to attract women to a film that has enough bloodshed to make Quentin Tarantino jealous would be to cast Pitt parading around barely clothed. (I've seen so much of Brad Pitt now that I felt like I should apologize to his (then) wife, Jennifer Aniston.)But Pitt is an incredible actor and he easily pulls off making Achilles a multidimensional character.Some noticeable changes were made to Homer's version of the story, such as who killed whom and at what point in the story, but the dramatic intensity of the film greatly benefits from these changes.The opening battle scene with the Greeks storming the Trojan beach seemed like a swords and spears version of Stephen Spielberg's opening to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" while other battle scenes recalled Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart.""Unlike those war-theme epics, however, director Wolfgang Petersen (""The Perfect Storm"") had the luxury of a main event battle that would make boxing promoter Don King envious, with Achilles squaring off against Hector.Other principal characters of ""The Illiad"" are peripheral faces in Petersen's ""Troy"" as he builds to this clash of titans. As Achilles mows down wave after wave of Trojan soldiers, Hector defeats scores of Greek soldiers and generals before his inevitable conflict with Achilles.""Troy"" boasts an excellent supporting cast, with Brian Cox (""The Bourne Identity"") as head Greek general Agamemnon, Sean Bean (""The Lord of the Rings"") as Achilles' closest friend Odysseus, the legendary Peter O'Toole (""Imperium: Augustus"") as Troy's King Priam and Bloom, who continues making wise career moves.What keeps ""Troy"" from becoming an epic is that sense of awe and amazement of watching a film like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in witnessing the atrocities of war, or ""Braveheart,"" which features memorable speeches that make your spine tingle. There is no lavish, lush scenery as the battlegrounds are fought on desolate, arid plains.No, ""Troy"" is all about the action, and in that sense it has more in common with Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator,"" another total adrenaline-rush film that doesn't bother with looking pretty or sounding preachy.The action scenes are tremendous and the setup and battle between Achilles and Hector is moviemaking at its best. Petersen delivers on the hype for the film's main event and wisely speeds through the rest of the story (The Trojan Horse, Achilles' fate, etc.).Petersen doesn't waste scenes, and with a story this immense in scope, the length is reasonable and the pace moves briskly so that it barely feels like a three-hour film.Teachers who are looking for a way to get their students into Greek mythology have a new tool for making learning exciting--despite the liberties taken with the story. And action fans have a new film to add to their must-see movie list.",4,Three hours of epic spectacle is a must-see,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,3706,"['couple', 'months', 'new', 'film', 'hyped', 'epic', 'rarely', 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'Such', 'case', 'Troy', 'based', 'Homer', 'story', 'Illiad', 'Most', 'incarnations', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'love', 'affair', 'Trojan', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Spartan', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Diana', 'Kruger', 'Michael', 'Valiant', 'sparked', 'decade-long', 'war', 'Trojans', 'Greeks', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Benioff', '25th', 'Hour', 'saga', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', '.Casting', 'Pitt', 'role', 'Achilles', 'seemed', 'odd', 'number', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'Pitt', 'boy-next-door', 'looks', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'cast', 'Trojan', 'general', 'Hector', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hulk', 'role', 'brooding', 'glory-hunting', 'Achilles.Maybe', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'figured', 'best', 'way', 'attract', 'women', 'film', 'enough', 'bloodshed', 'make', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'jealous', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'Pitt', 'parading', 'around', 'barely', 'clothed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'now', 'felt', 'should', 'apologize', 'then', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Pitt', 'incredible', 'actor', 'easily', 'off', 'making', 'Achilles', 'multidimensional', 'character.Some', 'noticeable', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'Homer', 'version', 'story', 'such', 'who', 'killed', 'whom', 'what', 'point', 'story', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'film', 'greatly', 'benefits', 'changes.The', 'opening', 'battle', 'scene', 'Greeks', 'storming', 'Trojan', 'beach', 'seemed', 'swords', 'spears', 'version', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'opening', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'other', 'battle', 'scenes', 'recalled', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Braveheart', 'war-theme', 'epics', 'however', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'had', 'luxury', 'main', 'event', 'battle', 'would', 'make', 'boxing', 'promoter', 'Don', 'King', 'envious', 'Achilles', 'squaring', 'off', 'Hector.Other', 'principal', 'characters', 'Illiad', 'are', 'peripheral', 'Petersen', 'Troy', 'clash', 'titans', 'Achilles', 'down', 'wave', 'wave', 'Trojan', 'soldiers', 'Hector', 'scores', 'Greek', 'soldiers', 'generals', 'inevitable', 'conflict', 'Achilles', 'Troy', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'head', 'Greek', 'general', 'Agamemnon', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Achilles', 'closest', 'friend', 'Odysseus', 'legendary', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Imperium', 'Augustus', 'Troy', 'King', 'Priam', 'Bloom', 'who', 'making', 'wise', 'career', 'moves.What', 'Troy', 'becoming', 'epic', 'sense', 'awe', 'amazement', 'watching', 'film', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'witnessing', 'atrocities', 'war', 'Braveheart', 'memorable', 'speeches', 'make', 'spine', 'tingle', 'lavish', 'lush', 'scenery', 'battlegrounds', 'are', 'fought', 'desolate', 'arid', 'plains.No', 'Troy', 'action', 'sense', 'more', 'common', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Gladiator', 'total', 'adrenaline-rush', 'film', ""n't"", 'bother', 'looking', 'pretty', 'sounding', 'preachy.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'tremendous', 'setup', 'battle', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'moviemaking', 'best', 'Petersen', 'delivers', 'hype', 'film', 'main', 'event', 'wisely', 'speeds', 'rest', 'story', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'Achilles', 'fate', 'etc', '.Petersen', ""n't"", 'waste', 'scenes', 'story', 'immense', 'scope', 'length', 'reasonable', 'pace', 'briskly', 'so', 'barely', 'three-hour', 'film.Teachers', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'get', 'students', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'have', 'new', 'tool', 'making', 'learning', 'exciting', 'liberties', 'taken', 'story', 'action', 'fans', 'have', 'new', 'film', 'add', 'must-see', 'movie', 'list']",N/A

Beautifully filmed and full of action and romance, it has a little bit of everything to satisfy everyone.  Brad Pitt does a nice job as Achilles, a feared warrior who is battling his own demons and filled with repulsion for the King he serves.  Eric Bana (coming off the film, The Hulk) also gives a good performance as Hector, Achilles' foe, a good man that is caught up in fighting for his homeland and the honor of his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, who's stealing Helen from the King of Sparta, sets the story in motion.

Alot of the invective was also directed at Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles.  This role is a no-win situation for Pitt.  How do you portray the greatest warrior the world has known without appearing to be a bit preening and narcissistic?  Director Petersen has staged here an impressive spectacle indeed.

The spectacle would be nothing, however, if the characters were overwhelmed by the proceedings.  Fortunately, this film contains a number of wonderful performances.  Special citation has to go to Eric Bana who gives a star-making performance as Hector.  Bana more than holds his own, sometimes dominating, the more seasoned pros he is working with.  Peter O'Toole as Priam can still command the screen forty years after ""Lawrence of Arabia"" with that unmistakable voice and those intense eyes.  Newcomer Rose Byrne as Briseis, niece of Priam, is an engaging actress.  I found myself more attracted to her character than I was to Diane Kruger as Helen, the beauty that launched a thousand ships.

What you're looking for will impact your like or dislike of the film.If you want a film true to Homer, this is NOT the flick for you.  Not even remotely close.  No gods, relationships all wrong, characters increased or decreased in importance, and the timeline is beyond butchered.  Oh, and several rather important characters are completely missing. (Cassandra!  Hello!  Kinda needed with the whole big wooden horse!)  I can forgive the limited Akhilleus backstory as we all know who he is and were he's vulnerable.  But these other omissions were enough to almost cause a fight between myself and the gentleman sitting in front of me when I saw this film as I kept muttering under my breath and this poor adaptation of a classic.If you want a good action flick, this is it.  Although long at 2 hours and 40 some-odd minutes, it has a good deal of action.  The fight scenes were stunning, the cinematography was excellent, the costumes were beautiful, and the locations were stunning.  My ex loved it since he never read the Iliad, and he could appreciate it as a straight up action film.I would not call this an epic, and here's why.  The script was a bit full of itself, to be kind, and I had several casting issues.  Pitt was all wrong for Akhilleus.  Krueger as Helen was a cardboard cutout, and Bloom took Paris' cowardice to comedic levels.Bana was the perfect Hektor, Peter O'Toole was nothing less than classy (despite the script), Brian Cox and Sean Beam were excellently cast in their roles as well.  Fortunately, we were not subject to too much in terms of dialogue from Ajax, because as we saw in ""X-Men"", Taylor Mane (aka ""Sabretooth"") can't do much more than growl his way through a film.I wanted to like this film.  Desperately.  I couldn't.  I am going to give it another try on rental, just to view it as an action flick.

852082,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B0002Z0EXQ,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 4]","Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" is a film for action buffs and not for classicists.  Here, immortality does not belong to the gods but instead to the fierce warrior, Achilles, who intends to fight the kind of battles that will etch his name in history for thousands of years.  A bit egotistical, yes, but it makes for a ferociously buff Brad Pitt intent on stealing the show, both as an actor and as a character.  ""Troy"" gives us an insolent Achilles (Pitt), lethal killer and hedonist, who fears no one, not even Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king he fights for and for whom Achilles has nothing but disdain.  When Menoleus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) steals off with the effete Paris (Orlando Bloom), brother-in-law Agamemnon sees the perfect opportunity to launch a war against his nemesis Priam (Peter O'Toole).Bloom's Paris is such a moronic wimp that it's hard to imagine he had the guts to convince Helen to escape with him to Troy.  Diane Kruger's Helen is equally clueless; even when she finally realizes that her departure from Sparta has jeopardized an entire nation, her attempts at rectifying matters are feeble and easy to put aside.  This choice to steer away from true passion and to present the couple as ineffectual is partly what makes ""Troy"" such a riveting film; the battles rage around Paris and Helen even though neither is worthy of such passion and violence, making the war seem unstoppable and stoked by more deeply rooted issues of pride, power, and greed. Despite its failings, ""Troy"" doesn't not have a boring moment in it.The stupidity of bringing the Trojan Horse inside the city walls recalls Monty Python, and some of the lines spoken by Paris and Helen are laughable; however, the film contains some fine roles and performances.  Peter O'Toole portrays a human Priam, gentle and full of love for his sons, and Cox's Agamemnon makes a dangerously arrogant foil for him.  Eric Bana as Hector exudes nobility and honor as well as a fierce passion for his family.  Sean Bean's Odysseus is so natural and likeable that I wished he had a bigger role.  The most astonishing performance is Brad Pitt, who is wholly believable as the unparalleled warrior and lover Achilles. He evokes barbarianism and passion in one sidelong look.As long as viewers don't expect accuracy, those looking for a riveting story and physical clashes will enjoy this film.",4,"A film for action fans, not classicists",1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,2366,"['Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'Troy', 'film', 'action', 'buffs', 'not', 'classicists', 'Here', 'immortality', 'not', 'belong', 'gods', 'instead', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'who', 'fight', 'kind', 'battles', 'will', 'etch', 'name', 'history', 'thousands', 'years', 'bit', 'egotistical', 'yes', 'ferociously', 'buff', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'intent', 'stealing', 'show', 'actor', 'character', 'Troy', 'insolent', 'Achilles', 'Pitt', 'lethal', 'killer', 'hedonist', 'who', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'Agamemnon', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'king', 'whom', 'Achilles', 'nothing', 'disdain', 'When', 'Menoleus', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'effete', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'brother-in-law', 'Agamemnon', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'launch', 'war', 'nemesis', 'Priam', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", '.Bloom', 'Paris', 'such', 'moronic', 'wimp', 'hard', 'imagine', 'had', 'guts', 'convince', 'Helen', 'escape', 'Troy', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'equally', 'clueless', 'even', 'when', 'finally', 'departure', 'Sparta', 'jeopardized', 'entire', 'nation', 'attempts', 'rectifying', 'matters', 'are', 'feeble', 'easy', 'put', 'aside', 'choice', 'steer', 'away', 'true', 'passion', 'present', 'couple', 'ineffectual', 'partly', 'what', 'Troy', 'such', 'riveting', 'film', 'battles', 'rage', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'even', 'worthy', 'such', 'passion', 'violence', 'making', 'war', 'seem', 'unstoppable', 'stoked', 'more', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'issues', 'pride', 'power', 'greed', 'failings', 'Troy', ""n't"", 'not', 'have', 'boring', 'moment', 'it.The', 'stupidity', 'bringing', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'city', 'walls', 'Monty', 'Python', 'lines', 'spoken', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'are', 'laughable', 'however', 'film', 'fine', 'roles', 'performances', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'human', 'Priam', 'gentle', 'full', 'love', 'sons', 'Cox', 'Agamemnon', 'dangerously', 'arrogant', 'foil', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'nobility', 'honor', 'as', 'well', 'fierce', 'passion', 'family', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'so', 'natural', 'likeable', 'wished', 'had', 'bigger', 'role', 'most', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'wholly', 'believable', 'unparalleled', 'warrior', 'lover', 'Achilles', 'barbarianism', 'passion', 'one', 'sidelong', 'look.As', 'long', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'accuracy', 'looking', 'riveting', 'story', 'physical', 'clashes', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

But for those of us who like movies with real people, weather, and locations, CGI just doesn't cut it.  There is only one real special effect in Troy, and that's Peter O'Toole's performance.  He should get the best supporting actor Oscar because he singlehandedly made this movie watchable.  When he's on the screen, things get real, and he makes the awful dialogue sound Shakesperian.  Other than that, no thanks.  Wolfgang Petersen has no point of view or distinctive style as a director.  Say what you want about Alexander, at least Stone had a vision, as ridiculous as it was at some points.  Eric Bana is a solid actor in the role of Hector, much more appealing than Achilles, and he is also convincing.

Just crack open a dictionary sometime, fercrissake...) and despite an inaccuracy or two here and there... (Didn't Ajax die after Achilles?  Like, didn't he scoop his armor up off the beach, and all that...? ) and despite the fact that hardly anyone on this film looks even remotely Greek... and despite the film giving the impression that a torturous ten-year war took place in the span of a few weeks...  Despite all that, this film was still fun, about as good a sword-and-sandal epic as we're likely to get in this day and age.  Brad Pitt, though buff as can be, perhaps isn't the greatest choice as Achilles, but Eric Bana is surprisingly moving as Hector, the champion of Troy, investing him with a tremendous pathos... The script is fairly tight, the sets look grand, the computer generated armies aren't too mechanical, the violence has heft.  In short, it works as an action film.That being said, the screenwriters and producers should be ashamed or at least abashed at how they distorted the Greek legends and bent history to fit their narrative scope.  The prime example of this is the melodramatic slaying of King Agamemnon at the film's climax:  Agamemnon actually returned from the Trojan War and was later slain in a palace intrigue.  His murder was the source of an entirely separate drama, and monkeying with the details of his death is a particularly egregious untruth.I weary of Hollywood writers who defend their despoiling of history by saying, ""oh look, it's just a movie and I can write it any way I want to..."" It's one thing to elide past peripheral events or omit facts that bog a story down, another thing altogether to willfully change the facts entirely.  Not only is it simply evil and wrong to rewrite history, it's just plain lazy.  They may claim that they are professionals who know how best to tell a story, but c'mon: if you can't figure out how to come up with a proper dramatic ending using the real story of ""The Iliad,"" then you just aren't as skilled a craftsman as you'd like us to believe.  You're just a hack with a tight deadline. And in the case of the Iliad in particular, it's not ""just a movie."" This is probably the only version of this story -- one of the world's most important historical narratives -- that most people in our demi-literate pop culture will ever learn: couldn't you at least make the effort to get the details straight?  Is it really that hard?  Do you really gain that much dramatically by screwing up our perception of history?  Fie, a pox apon you lazy Hollywood twits.

A major portion of the female characters are gone, no Cassandra, no Iphigenia, no Clytemnestra, no Hecuba.I shudder to think what would have happened if Helen hadn't been the reason for the war.  As it is, she is a depleted character.I knew we were trouble when the actress playing her, whined in her dinky Little Nell voice, ""Sparta is not my home.  I was sent from my home to marry King Menelaus.""  Oh gee, really?In the Iliad, it was made clear that Helen was Queen of Sparta before Menelaus married her. He became King of Sparta because he married her.  He had no right to rule Sparta unless he was married to her.When she ran off with Paris, she left poor old Menelaus in a pickle. Which is why he really did have to go after her and try to get her back.  Helen had true power as a woman and a queen.  We never get a sense of that from little dolly Helen in this movie.What we are left with for the most part, except for the graceful presence of Peter O'Toole as King Priam, is a bunch of warrior jocks butting heads.  The jockiest of them all being Brad Pitt as Achilles.  He doesn't do a bad job of it but one is expected to care more for him than one can.At the fall of Troy in this movie, who is there to mourn for?  Not the tragic old Queen Hecuba (Oooops, no Hecuba), not the half-mad young seerest Cassandra, enduring her own rape while foreseeing her own murder (Oooops, no Cassandra). Peter O'Toole, however briefly used as King Priam always has a claim on our emotions, so there is him.  In this version, Andromache is allowed to keep her child and Helen and Paris survive.No, at the end we are expected to mourn most of all for the one person who merits it least, Achilles.  He is the embodiment of the warlike spirit so his death cannot make us ache for the tragedy of war. And since it brings him his dearest wish, the glory of an immortal name, it cannot even make us ache very much for him.Too much is piled on the character of Achilles because big money movie star, Brad Pitt, is playing him.

We as viewers (well, most of us) cut Peter Jackson some slack with his deviations from Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" and we ought to give the same consideration to Wolfgang Petersen, who brings Homer's classic to vivid, sweaty life.  And not only does Petersen pull off a cinematic coup, he makes watching TROY an outright fun and thrilling experience.The film centers around two characters--and they are not Helen and Paris.  A beefed-up Brad Pitt plays Achilles, a fierce Greek warrior who is literally unbeatable.  Yet Achilles is anything but a nice person:  he is self-centered and pretentious, and he fights on his terms, often to the detriment of his countrymen.  Achilles has but one quest:  to be immortalized through history, and the Greek siege of Troy provides him the perfect opportunity.  For such a shallow, narcissistic character, Pitt is perfectly suited for the role.Eric Bana, on the other hand, steals the show as Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is a good, kind, and decent man who loves his family and his country.  Faced with having to clean up the mess after his brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) brings Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to his beloved land, Hector leads the Trojan army against the Greek invaders; his showdown with Achilles is inevitable, and is also the film's defining moment.Yet TROY is bursting at its wooden horse seams with other memorable performances, including a frail Peter O'Toole as Trojan King Priam, and his scene-chewing counterpart Brian Cox, who plays greedy King Agamemnon.  Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean are superb, too, as Greek kings Menelaus and Odysseus, while Bloom is less than stellar as a peach-fuzzed, pusillanimitic Paris.Director Petersen delivers a grand epic complete with stunning cinematography, fierce action, imaginative special effects, and a spellbinding story.  His film does not detract, but instead enhances, Homer's classic.  In the words of King Menelaus of Sparta:  ""May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds.""

But this is a travesty.First of all, it is a jumble. So much is left out that at times the story becomes incomprhensible. Important characters are omitted, and the roles of some characters are all too frequently assigned to different characters.The story of Homer's Iliad begins after the seige of Troy has already been underway for nine years and ends with the funeral of Hector some months later. Much of what we know about the story and the characters is learned from other sources, such as the plays of Aeschylus and Vigil's Aeneid. There is nothing wrong with combining these sources to tell the tale of the Fall of Troy. But one would hope that the movie makers could keep the story straight. Sadly, they don't.Omitted are such significant characters as Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, Cassandra, the prophetess of Troy whose prediction that Paris will bring destruction upon the city proves to be all too accurate, Hecuba, King Priam's wife, and the Gods who play a vital role in the course of events.Menelaus (pronounced MeneLAYus, not MeneLOUSE) is not killed by Hector. He lives to return to Sparta, bringing his wayward wife Helen with him.Achilles is killed by a poisoned arrow shot by Paris BEFORE the fall of Troy. It is after the death of Achilles, when the Greeks are ready to give up and sail home, that Odysseus comes up with the Trojan Horse ruse.It is never explained that Achilles is one of the ancient Greek heroes, the offspring of a godess (Thetis) and a man, or that his mother dipped him in the river Styx when he was an infant,  making him immortal. But she failed to immerse the heel by which she held him. Thus the significance of the arrow shot into his ""Achilles heel,"" the only spot on his body in which he could be killedParis is also killed BEFORE the fall of Troy and is not present at the end.Agamemnon is not killed by Brises during the fall of Troy. He returns home to Mycenae where he is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra because he had sacrificed their daughter to the sea god Poseidon at the beginning of the Trojan War in order to obtain passage for his army across the Aegean Sea to Troy.May the Gods punish those who are responsible for this butchery of the ancient tale of the Fall of Troy.",2,A travesty of Greek mythology,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2354,"['am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'license', 'when', 'translating', 'novel', 'film', 'Omissions', 'are', 'inevitable', 'travesty.First', 'jumble', 'So', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'times', 'story', 'incomprhensible', 'Important', 'characters', 'are', 'omitted', 'roles', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'frequently', 'assigned', 'different', 'characters.The', 'story', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'seige', 'Troy', 'already', 'been', 'underway', 'nine', 'years', 'funeral', 'Hector', 'months', 'later', 'Much', 'what', 'know', 'story', 'characters', 'learned', 'other', 'sources', 'such', 'plays', 'Aeschylus', 'Vigil', 'Aeneid', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'combining', 'sources', 'tell', 'tale', 'Fall', 'Troy', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'movie', 'makers', 'could', 'keep', 'story', 'straight', 'Sadly', ""don't.Omitted"", 'are', 'such', 'significant', 'characters', 'Clytemnestra', 'Agamemnon', 'wife', 'Cassandra', 'prophetess', 'Troy', 'prediction', 'Paris', 'will', 'bring', 'destruction', 'city', 'be', 'too', 'accurate', 'Hecuba', 'King', 'Priam', 'wife', 'Gods', 'who', 'play', 'vital', 'role', 'course', 'events.Menelaus', 'pronounced', 'MeneLAYus', 'not', 'MeneLOUSE', 'not', 'killed', 'Hector', 'return', 'Sparta', 'bringing', 'wayward', 'wife', 'Helen', 'him.Achilles', 'killed', 'poisoned', 'arrow', 'shot', 'Paris', 'fall', 'Troy', 'death', 'Achilles', 'when', 'Greeks', 'are', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'sail', 'home', 'Odysseus', 'up', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'ruse.It', 'never', 'explained', 'Achilles', 'one', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'heroes', 'offspring', 'godess', 'Thetis', 'man', 'mother', 'dipped', 'river', 'Styx', 'when', 'was', 'infant', 'making', 'immortal', 'failed', 'immerse', 'heel', 'held', 'Thus', 'significance', 'arrow', 'shot', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'only', 'spot', 'body', 'could', 'be', 'killedParis', 'also', 'killed', 'fall', 'Troy', 'not', 'present', 'end.Agamemnon', 'not', 'killed', 'Brises', 'fall', 'Troy', 'home', 'Mycenae', 'where', 'murdered', 'wife', 'Clytemnestra', 'had', 'sacrificed', 'daughter', 'sea', 'god', 'Poseidon', 'beginning', 'Trojan', 'War', 'order', 'obtain', 'passage', 'army', 'Aegean', 'Sea', 'Troy.May', 'Gods', 'punish', 'who', 'are', 'responsible', 'butchery', 'ancient', 'tale', 'Fall', 'Troy']",N/A

Even Paris Hilton might have launched a few more ships than this low budget babe.  And Orlando Bloom.  Paris Hilton wouldnt give that wimp the time of day.  He doesnt even have any lips.  Obviously she would have to have a magic spell cast upon her to run away with him.  And Hector with his mullet hair style is just too banal to look at.  Brad Pit is always a pretty wooden indian so he's no surprise as Achilles.  He really is a bit reminiscent of Charlton Heston in the wooden quality of his acting. But why does Patrolus look like an ugly girl? This movie is sure a flashback to ye olde Charlton Heston extravaganzas.  The wrath of Achilles never materializes but he does like to fight being so godlike.  Thats clear.  It would have been so wonderful to have given it a contemporary spin.  The choice of a director would have been a start and a costume designer and a hair stylist.  Peter O'Tooole should have stood in bed. Too many fat old men.  Menalaus was a good guy.  Not a bad guy.

When I watched it the first time, as Menelaus bites it fairly early on, I could only wonder what the heck was going on.  I just watched the extended version, my fourth viewing overall, and despite the major changes, this is a huge larger than life epic, and I still very much recommend it.  The additional footage was wonderful, especially the anticipation sequence as the Trojans, knowing the Greeks were coming, getting ready for siege.  Excellent.  And heck, we get to see Odysseus' dog, the most famous canine in human literature.Others also speak of the acting, and here I must disagree with most, I thought Brad Pitt pulled off Achilles very well.  Both in the physical sense and in the actual performance.  I have never seen the character as a bulked out brute.  Good call I thought.Peter O'Toole does steal the show as Priam and his scene seeking his son's body is as expected, the most powerful one in the film.Action too is a sight to behold.  The great fight between Achilles and Hector really stands out.  It is the close up work here that is so outstanding.  Yes, some of the AI crowd scenes are over done, but that is the epic aspect, and even those were pretty seamless, we have come a long way with computer crowds.  As long as they don't distract from the more personal interactions, and in this movie, they don't; I had no problem maintaining my suspension of disbelief.Sean Bean was a great Odysseus and I was grateful for his additional scenes.  One really does want to see the sequel, to follow up on The Odyssey, but I am not sure that could be pulled off in a no-gods scenario, you would have to have the mythological monsters at least, or why bother?  Still, it does make one wish for the other half of the bookends, for Odysseus' journey home is equally a timeless classic.And a note to other more professional reviewers, especially those it seems, that work for Entertainment Weekly.  This movie was it hit.  It made a half million dollars world wide, and I am tired of seeing it linked more to ""Alexander"" than its proper historical and economically successful kin ""Gladiator"".

852100,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0002Z0EXQ,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 5]","This is one of the best efforts Hollywood has ever put forth to make a genuine and tasteful production of a classic mythological story.  While the Trojan war is thought to be a historical event, much of the details in Homer were the stuff of legend, not history.Eric Bana and Brad Pitt are both buffed up and believable as Greek warriors.  I was skeptical of Pitt being cast as Achilles, but he turned out a surprisingly good performance.  Peter O'Toole is a natural as Priam, and Orlando Bloom plays Paris as every bit the wimp he is in the ILIAD.To be sure, the writers took a great many liberties in the storyline.  However, this made for a nice and cohesive plot.  In particular, I was impressed by the clever way in which they re-wrote the duel between Paris and Menelaous, as well as their blowing up the character of Chrysalias into a major & pivotal persona.  In Homer we barely get to know her at all.After seeing the film, some friends of mine complained that Achilles was not likeable enough.  Actually, the Achilles in TROY is far more likeable than the one in Homer's epic.  In my mind, they did a great job of making him as likeable as possible without divorcing him from the character in Homer's poem.Eric Bana is remarkable as Hector.  Some people I know were surprised that he is depicted as in most ways more heroic than Achilles.  After all, Hector fights for all the right reasons.  This, too, is consistent with the ILIAD.  Also, TROY is a good name for the film as ILIAD alludes to Ilion, which was another name for Troy.As a nice bonus, there are some scenes from and allusions to Virgil's AENEID.  This makes the production value even more endearing to the viewer.Whether you have ever read Homer / Virgil or not, I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  It has a nice 2nd disc of special features that includes an overview of the Greek pantheon (although some detail on Homer would have been nice as well).  I would recommend both the movie AND the book.  I would also recommend watching HELEN OF TROY, which is a DVD that focuses on different aspects of the myth.",5,The Trojan war on screen,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2084,"['one', 'best', 'efforts', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'put', 'forth', 'make', 'genuine', 'tasteful', 'production', 'classic', 'mythological', 'story', 'Trojan', 'war', 'thought', 'be', 'historical', 'event', 'much', 'details', 'Homer', 'were', 'stuff', 'legend', 'not', 'history.Eric', 'Bana', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'buffed', 'up', 'believable', 'Greek', 'warriors', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Pitt', 'being', 'cast', 'Achilles', 'turned', 'out', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'natural', 'Priam', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'bit', 'wimp', 'ILIAD.To', 'be', 'sure', 'writers', 'took', 'great', 'many', 'liberties', 'storyline', 'However', 'made', 'nice', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'particular', 'was', 'impressed', 'clever', 'way', 're-wrote', 'duel', 'Paris', 'Menelaous', 'as', 'well', 'blowing', 'up', 'character', 'Chrysalias', 'major', 'pivotal', 'persona', 'Homer', 'barely', 'get', 'know', 'all.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'friends', 'mine', 'complained', 'Achilles', 'was', 'not', 'likeable', 'enough', 'Actually', 'Achilles', 'TROY', 'far', 'more', 'likeable', 'one', 'Homer', 'epic', 'mind', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'as', 'likeable', 'possible', 'divorcing', 'character', 'Homer', 'poem.Eric', 'Bana', 'remarkable', 'Hector', 'people', 'know', 'were', 'surprised', 'depicted', 'most', 'ways', 'more', 'heroic', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'fights', 'right', 'reasons', 'too', 'consistent', 'ILIAD', 'Also', 'TROY', 'good', 'name', 'film', 'ILIAD', 'Ilion', 'was', 'name', 'Troy.As', 'nice', 'bonus', 'are', 'scenes', 'allusions', 'Virgil', 'AENEID', 'production', 'value', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', 'viewer.Whether', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'Homer', '/', 'Virgil', 'not', 'would', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'nice', '2nd', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'overview', 'Greek', 'pantheon', 'detail', 'Homer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'book', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'HELEN', 'OF', 'TROY', 'DVD', 'different', 'aspects', 'myth']",N/A

Having watched most of ""Helen of Troy"" last October on USA network, I must admit that I feared seeing a regurgitation of a storyline I'd already seen and couldn't believe the playtime of nearly three hours, but I went anyway.If I had to sum up my review for this movie in a single word, it would be ""Wow!"" I predict that both Brad Pitt and Eric Bana will be nominated for Oscars next year for this movie, and it will win the Oscar for Best Costumes and Best Picture. I also believe that history will write this epic movie on the scale of ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Cleopatra,"" ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Titanic."" The only thing that will hurt the ""classic"" status of this movie is the R rating; though in hindsight, I can't help but think they were aiming for a PG-13 and just missed.After watching some of the promo interviews, I was kind of nauseated by Brad Pitt's disgust over the fact that the interviewer wanted to talk more about his physique rather than his role in the movie. The phrase ""don't hate me because I'm beautiful"" just kept popping up in my mind. But after seeing the film, I must say that I believe that this film will be the defining performance of his career. The only performer that ""wowed"" me more was Eric Bana who played Hector, and I have to give an honorable mention for Peter O'Toole as well. The stunts, the costumes, the settings, the screenplay, the cinematography, the casting (with one exception noted below), and the performances were nearly flawless.One other group that may be disappointed in this film is the one going to see blood fly and body parts severed. This movie makes Gladiator look pale in comparison, with the exception that the focus is on a well-planned plot and not on showing as much bleeding and carnage as possible. It does have many grand fight scenes and blood *is* shed, but the focus is on plot-necessity, not gratuitous gore. I count this a plus, but I know some will not appreciate this omission. I followed one viewer out of the film whose immediate response was, ""That movie was so boring, but I'm sure it will win a lot of awards."" My guess is that she would fall in this aforementioned group of viewers.I am having a hard time coming up with criticism for this film, though I did find a couple of points. The movie is merely ""inspired"" by the original poem, ""The Iliad.""  While I think the ""rewrites"" are clever and add to the plot of the movie, I'm sure that history buffs will be annoyed by the introduction of ""facts, not in evidence,"" and events that had to be left on the editting room floor. Also, whomever hired the *very* brightly blue-eyed son of Hector ought to be taken out and shot.  Both Hector and his wife have *very* brown eyes, and this baby is much too large to be passed off as a newborn. The kid's cute, but the least they could have done was change the eye color in post-production. If I were Hector, I'd be wondering, ""Who's the daddy?"" because it definitely couldn't have been him. There's even a greater than 80% chance that the mom isn't his either, if you follow the genetic probabilities.Historically, I've not been a huge Brad Pitt fan, but I must say that this film is now in my Top-10 list of all time. And, believe it or not, I left wishing they had *added* five minutes to the movie to solidify the fate of one of the main characters but understand that the focus of the movie wouldn't allow for this clarification.",5,"Initially Sceptical, but Wow.

852103,A1YSNDCBNZU3W2,B0002Z0EXQ,e5150,"[2, 3]","Just another film among the recent glut which tries to capitalize on the success of The Lord of the Rings and its epic battles and sword and arrow warfare. TROY, however, really begs for the ""LOTR wannabe"" comparisons by starring two main actors from the epic trilogy: Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean. In fact, one would think TROY was purposefully trying raise an unconscious comparison in our minds by hiring them. To complete the connection, there's an amusing moment at the end when Orlando Bloom finally discovers his ""inner elf"" and sends Pitt to pin cushion school.Unfortunately, though TROY is formed around similar battle scenes with enormous armies, the overall effect is much less awe-inspiring. Sure, you have Wolfgang Petersen using Peter Jackson's patented aerial swoops over the massive armies as they collide head on, but when you get down close the fighting is so overcrowded it is more like pushing and shoving and tripping.  To draw our attention away from this, we are treated mostly to one-on-one fighting scenes which are going on between the main actors.Being an R-rated movie, I had thought the battles would have had more gore, but I have to confess that the PG-13 LOTR trilogy, though virtually bloodless, was far more violent than this R-rated feature. TROY, with all of its ferocious combat, has no decapitations and no severed limbs, which would have been perfectly acceptable when you consider that the rating gave them more room to work in such realism. Even the nudity was sadly restricted to just butts. Huh?!?! I don't see anything worth an R-rating here.To its credit, TROY does move along at a rapid pace, gets to the action immediately and rarely lets up for long. It's battle after battle, but nothing nearly as exciting as in LOTR which it clearly draws some ideas from.Though TROY obviously wants to be called ""The Lord of the Trojans"", its grand scale doesn't come off quite as epic. The special effects are very good and the acting is decent, but after watching it I wasn't left with any feeling that I had just witnessed something incredible or even memorable. It's not a bad movie and worth a watch, but you may or may not feel the urge to view it more than once.",3,a.k.a.

I havn't read the actually poam of The Iliad, but I read an easier version, and thought that the story was great. When I heard that it was going to become a movie, ""Troy"", I was very excited. When I heard that it was going to star Brad Pitt, that irked me a little bit. I learned that it was going to be 165 minutes, close to three hours. I began to think it was going to be a new great epic. This movie had everything going for it, and I thought it was going to become a five star wonder, but it actually fell short by one star. The one star was lost, mostly because of Brad Pitt. The movie got greta star power because of Eric Bana, who I noticed from ""Hulk"" which came out last summer.The movie begins in the 12th century BC. The army of King Agamemnon wants to expand his land and take over Greece. Agamemnon calls for Achilles, who is supposed to be the greatest warrior alive who has no weaknesses, to fight Thessaly, a part of Greece they want. They take over, but Agamemnon needs to call him again and bring him to Troy. Prince Paris has fallen in love and taken Agamemnon's brother Menelaus's wife Helen, and has brought her back to his homeland of Troy. Paris' brother Hector doesn't want any problems, and tries to make his father Priam, the king, to send her back to home on a ship. Agamemnon decides to help his brother, after finding out that he if takes Troy he will have taken over Greece. The Greeks assemble 1000 ships, and head out to Troy to get Helen back to her home, along with Odysses, who becomes a sort of leader to the Trojans.""Troy"" was a well made movie, with a kind of ""Lord of the Rings"" fashion with the battle scenes and some of the camera angles. It also had a great score, and the three hours felt like it was only about ninety minutes. The time just flew by. The problem was Brad Pitt. He did not make a good Achilles, and he kind of killed the entire movie. He lost the movie an entire star. I have only seen one movie with Brad Pitt, and that is ""Oceans 11."" He also kind of killed that movie. A minor problem is that the nudity in this movie is pointless. They could have showed everything they needed to without the nudity. ""Troy"" focused more on the romance of these figures, and not on the war. There was a heart in Achilles, but Brad Pitt couldn't show heart in this character.

The best performance in the film belongs to Eric Bana, who I thought made the film, as Hector prince of Troy. Peter O' Toole and Brian Cox were also great.The plot of the film is rather complicated, but here goes. While in Sparta agreeing to terms with a peace treaty between Sparta and Troy. Paris (Orlando Bloom) steals King Menelaus' wife Helen. This causes much trouble when Menelaus goes to his brother Agemmenon (Cox) for support. Achilles (Pitt) is asked to aid Agemmenon in battle, but is very stubborn, and hard to control. Achilles desperately wants to become a legend so agrees to aid in the war. While Pretty Boy Pitt wasn't terrible as Achilles I thought he lacked something. As I said before Eric Bana is excellent as Prince Hector, and brought depth to the very tortured charactor.While this may not be the film I expected it to be. I must say that I rather enjoyed it.

Though never quite reaching such wondrous heights as historical epics such as ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" and not earning enough domestically to make a profit, ""Troy"" succeeds as a fine film reminiscent of old Hollywood epics such as ""El Cid"" and ""Ben Hur"".The production values are simply astounding.  Wolfgang Peterson's flawless reproduction of Ancient Greece engulfs audiences in the wonder and glory of the age.  The breathtaking cinematography by Roger Pratt makes this a film best seen on the silver screen.  From the pulse-pounding battle sequences to the sweeping shots of the Greek fleet that shall be emblazoned in my mind forever, this is a truly handsome film.  James Horner creates yet another pitch perfect score that works perfectly with the film's visual style.The acting chops of Brad Pitt are (quite literally at times, ladies) put to good use here.  It is my belief, and one that is most certainly not shared by all, that Pitt is a wonderful and versatile actor.  Consider some of his most prominent roles; as Death in ""Meet Joe Black"", a vampire in ""Interview with the Vampire"", a criminal in ""Ocean's 11"", a mental patient in ""12 Monkeys"", a cowboy in ""Thelma and Louise"", an Irish boxer in ""Snatch"", a detective in ""Seven"" and on and on.  This boy has talent!  He proves himself even further with the role of Achilles.  Pitt 100% becomes the legendary fighter, from the body to the mannerisms to the swordplay.  He IS Achilles.  I pity all actors who have played Achilles or will play him in a future film; their performances are/will be tremendously dwarfed in comparison.  The rest of the cast; Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger, and Eric Bana are all fantastic with the exception of Orlando Bloom, who proves without a doubt that a handsome face does not equal talent.  Bloom should take notes from fellow heartthrob Pitt, who does indeed know how to act!Like the old Hollywood epics, ""Troy"" does regrettably lack that certain level of emotional pull and human drama that modern audiences demand (i.e. don't expect to be sobbing uncontrollably by its finale as you might very well have done in ""Braveheart"").  ""Troy"" and old Hollywood epics also share a certain level of melodrama and almost joyful corniness.  Audiences nowadays dislike this style of filmmaking, yet I found myself embracing it simply because it helped to make ""Tory"" even more old Hollywood.",4,"""This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen""",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2923,"['Hollywood', 'recent', 'obsession', 'historical', 'epics', 'produced', 'truly', 'amazing', 'films', 'truly', 'not', 'Troy', 'mercifully', 'former', 'category', 'whole', 'production', 'was', 'risky', 'endeavor', 'would', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'be', 'interested', 'ages', 'old', 'myths', 'Would', 'scholars', 'classics', 'devotees', 'condemn', 'film', 'reworking', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'course', 'was', 'expensive', 'price', 'tag', '200+', 'million', 'brought', 'mind', 'similarly-themed', 'legendarily', 'pricey', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'Cleopatra', 'never', 'quite', 'reaching', 'such', 'wondrous', 'heights', 'historical', 'epics', 'such', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator', 'not', 'earning', 'enough', 'domestically', 'make', 'profit', 'Troy', 'fine', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'such', 'El', 'Cid', 'Ben', 'Hur', '.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'simply', 'astounding', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'flawless', 'reproduction', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'engulfs', 'audiences', 'wonder', 'glory', 'age', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Pratt', 'film', 'best', 'seen', 'silver', 'screen', 'pulse-pounding', 'battle', 'sequences', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'Greek', 'fleet', 'shall', 'be', 'emblazoned', 'mind', 'forever', 'truly', 'handsome', 'film', 'James', 'Horner', 'yet', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'score', 'perfectly', 'film', 'visual', 'style.The', 'acting', 'chops', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'quite', 'literally', 'times', 'ladies', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'here', 'belief', 'one', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'shared', 'Pitt', 'wonderful', 'versatile', 'actor', 'Consider', 'most', 'prominent', 'roles', 'Death', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'vampire', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'criminal', 'Ocean', '11', 'mental', 'patient', '12', 'Monkeys', 'cowboy', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Irish', 'boxer', 'Snatch', 'detective', 'Seven', 'boy', 'talent', 'even', 'further', 'role', 'Achilles', 'Pitt', '100', '%', 'legendary', 'fighter', 'body', 'mannerisms', 'swordplay', 'Achilles', 'pity', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'Achilles', 'will', 'play', 'future', 'film', 'performances', 'are/will', 'be', 'tremendously', 'dwarfed', 'comparison', 'rest', 'cast', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'are', 'fantastic', 'exception', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'who', 'doubt', 'handsome', 'face', 'not', 'equal', 'talent', 'Bloom', 'should', 'take', 'notes', 'fellow', 'heartthrob', 'Pitt', 'who', 'indeed', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'Troy', 'regrettably', 'lack', 'certain', 'level', 'emotional', 'pull', 'human', 'drama', 'modern', 'audiences', 'demand', 'i.e', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'finale', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'done', 'Braveheart', 'Troy', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'also', 'share', 'certain', 'level', 'melodrama', 'almost', 'joyful', 'corniness', 'Audiences', 'nowadays', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'yet', 'found', 'embracing', 'simply', 'helped', 'make', 'Tory', 'even', 'more', 'old', 'Hollywood']",N/A
852114,A146D2LYLICNLS,B0002Z0EXQ,eric_f,"[1, 2]","Upon seeing the trailer for this movie I had expected a lot more than what was delivered. This is simply an average movie in every aspect. I actually like Brad Pitt as an actor; he can do a good job when he is cast for the right movie (ie: ""12 Monkeys and ""Se7en""). But I'm sorry, he was unconvincing as Achilles. Yeah, he obviously spent some major time at the gym for this role and admittedly he looks impressive physically. But in terms of *emotion* and acting in the role he leaves much to be desired.The fight scenes are mediocre at best and become repetitive after the first one. Both armies stare each other down-run towards each other while screaming-collide-throats are slashed and chests are impaled (one very large fighter needs to be impaled twice before he dies, just for the added shock value and drama)-armies retreat and lick their wounds-Brad Pitt is shown all sweaty and covered in the blood of the men he killed-Brad Pitt washes himself (one almost expects him to turn to the camera, hold up a bottle of the newest shampoo and start talking about how it leaves your hair silky smooth without any buildup)-army sleeps while Brad Pitt gets a little action-next day another battle. Repeat as necessary throughout the movie.But I don't mean to knock the battle sequences all that much. The fight between Achilles and Hector is great, and might very well be worth the price of admission. Pitt and Bana actually work at it.And Diane Kruger who plays Helen of Troy is definitely gorgeous and nice to look at, even if she's a one-dimentional cardboard cutout of a character. Not her fault. Blame the film-makers for that.All in all, don't expect much from this movie other than mild entertainment. It's all style and little substance.

It's a fact that not every movie is true to the books they're based on). No, the biggest flaws in the movie are the casting choices. The supporting cast is really good, and Peter O'Toole is typically brilliant. However, the five major leads of the film (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Rose Byrne, and Diane Kruger) are badly miscast. None of them fit their parts (even Pitt): they look unconvincing and undistinguished. And Brad Pitt is a pretty cool guy, but seriously, how can ANYONE picture him as Achilles? Good news, however.

852119,A1CMWPFDXA3Y2I,B0002Z0EXQ,"ex nihilo ""creatio""","[5, 6]","A black sail aproaches the beach of Troy, bearing the terrible and fearsome Myrmidons -Achillles's warriors; meanwhile, at the gates of Troy, Hector harangues his soldiers: they must fight, he urges them, to defend their mother, Troy. Inmediately afer this scene, we can hear Achilles, also haranguing his Myrmidons: he promises them the glory of inmortality if they die while fighting against three times their number on that beach. This contrast Achilles/Hector is the centre around which the film revolves since the moment when Achilles's mother (Goddess Thetis) gives him the choice of either living a life of love and dignity (after which his name will sink into oblivion), or one of fighting and death (after which his name will be immortal). Achilles chooses this last possibility right away, and we are shown, as we get to know the character, that Hector represents the first one. They are, thus, incompatible, and there can't be one of them where there is the other. So, from the beginning, we learn to love the character of Hector, who is beloved of all who know him, and full of dignity (and WONDERFULLY played by Eric Bana). The final combat between these two characters (a truly great scene) is a moment of great tension and pathos, even though we know the final result of this confrontation.Is this the only ethic choice we are shown in the movie? No. At the beginning of the film Menelaus gives a toast: ""may the gods keep the wolves in the hills and our women in our beds!"" And this is just what most characters in the story do...leave their responsibilities in the hands of the gods (as Priam repeatedly does when he refuses to see the danger that the Greeks -the ""wolves""- represent, thinking that apollo will deliver them form this tribulation, as he has used to do in many other past wars). But, as Odyseus tells Achilles, ""we must play with the toys the gods give us"", and if we refuse to do this (control our own life, make our decissions) others will do it for us, and boy will it be worse!We must make our own decissions and face the consequences of these, something Paris and Helen always fail to do, leaving others to suffer the results of their thoughtless and impulsive actions. In fact this was the worst fear I had about a popular movie rendering of The Illiad: that it might glorify and beautify the Helen/Paris affair, something that, I think, the original version does not. But, thanks the gods, this film does not yield to this easy temptation.So, is this just another dumb vulgar Hollywood version of the Illiad? Granted, there are many details where it betrays Homer's story: the war lasted longer than just some days, Agamemnon did not die this way, many characters are missing or just sketchy, etc. But one must be dumb to think these details are anything more important than just so many turnings of a very long plot. What is really important is that Homer composed his epic poem to entertain while giving his audience food for thought with the universal moral themes that the characters' actions exemplify. And this Hollywood version proves that these moral themes are truly universal,and the actions of the characters that bring them to us are as likely to engage the attention of a modern day audience as they were 3,000 years ago.

If not, a brief sum up is that this film is a modern retelling of Homer's classic epic poem, The Illiad, which to most people, needs no introduction. Of course, this is a very stylized, action-oriented take on the story, leaving out much of the original works's depth. This review is for the Extended, uncut, edition Blu Ray disc release which I just bought and viewed. First off, the film's high definition transfer is excellent, the film is visually stunning, especially on newer LED LCD HDTV's in 1080p resolution. This version's extended scenes, unfortunately, were not very good, and did not add anything special to the film's original theatrical release. Of course, this is my opinion, as others may find the extra dialogue better in some way, although I did not.

852123,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002Z0EXQ,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[19, 23]","There are several problems with the film `Troy', if one is trying to fit it too closely with the literature which inspired it, Homer's Illiad.  There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than `inspired by' - there are characters missing (Cassandra, etc.); there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (I won't give spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world.  However, he is a loose canon of sorts, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy.  Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory.  Achilles is persuaded in the end by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy.  Achilles sets sail.The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair `was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson).  Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy;  Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event as a chance to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time).  This is where the retelling becomes much more modern than ancient.  The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as it is with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends.  Does one sense a thinly-veiled critique of the modern siege-makers in this?An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy.  Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo (a dishonouring of the local gods - again, does one sense a critique of the moderns here?) by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have.  At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of `good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache).  Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one.  (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.)  We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and `shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally.  The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody.  The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery.  The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an  offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse.  The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called `the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory.  As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in.A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).The effects are great, as is the general cinematography.  This is a film to be seen in the theatres, for the `big screen' effect.",4,A tale for our times?,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,5661,"['are', 'several', 'problems', 'film', 'Troy', 'one', 'trying',

As a grad student in history, I can respect the apparent desire of the director to make an ""historical"" rendition of the Trojan War, rather than a mythical one.  However---despite the archaeological discovery of Heinrich Schliemann (who found the actual site of Troy in Anatolia)---the story is inextricably founded upon Homer's epics.  To apply them half-heartedly in some regards and violate them in others is absolutely unacceptable.  The movie would have been far better if it had not been consumed in a secularist (or even dogmatically atheist) campaign to demythologize an intrinsically mythological story.  Even basic, non-supernatural aspects, such as the survivals or deaths of certain characters, are altered.  The director (Petersen) has Menelaus die at the hand of Hector, whereas Homer had him die long after the sack of Troy and his return to Sparta.  Petersen also allows Paris to escape with Helen.  Helen, in the Illiad, is recaptured by Menelaus at the burning of Troy and returns with him to his polis; Paris dies in the true story.  Furthermore, Agamemnon, in the ""new version"" is killed by Briseis.  In the ""old"" (or real) story, he is murdered, upon his return home, by his queen Clytemnestra and her lover.  Perhaps the most galling thing, already mentioned, is the constant desacralization of the story.  Petersen spins the noble Homeric story of vindictive gods and tragic men into a crass, hedonistic, vulgar, brutal farce.My compliments to Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana for attempts to salvage the film.

852126,ARH0LRE3YSZ5H,B0002Z0EXQ,Gary,"[3, 6]","When I saw the original version of Troy, I don't remember thinking that the movie needed more ""character development"" or longer battle scenes. It was pretty good as it was, even though it occasionally lapsed into Hollywood epic dialogue and some of its scenes were flat out absurd, e.g., the scene where Hector kills Patroclus, thinking he's actually Achilles, then turns to Odysseus and calls off a battle involving tens of thousands of men. ""That's enough for today,"" he says, and then they all retreat. Right. If the director wanted to release a new version of the movie, he should have fixed up scenes like this rather than just undo all the edits that made the original so tight in the first place.The director's cut of Troy isn't all that bad, but it's worse than the original. Director's cuts are always worse and always longer, because what they do is restore all the ""missing scenes"" that were cut (usually for good reasons) from the original. For example, in this ""new and improved"" version of Troy, the battles are longer and a lot bloodier, which isn't necessarily bad in itself, but I thought the original battle scenes were more effective, mostly due to the tighter editing. In the new version, we also get a lot more character dialog, but ""more dialog"" isn't the same thing as more ""character development."" None of this restored footage told me anything new about the characters or helped to clarify their relationships or any of that stuff. It was all pretty clear in the original.The director's cut seemed ""off"" somehow. It wasn't as tight, for one thing, but there was something weird about the sound quality and the new score was god-awful, in my opinion. I've read that the picture quality is much better; if so, I didn't really notice.  In any case, I have yet to see a director's cut that was better than the original and this new version of Troy is no exception.

Two mighty armies face each other and decide to let their top performers do the business. A brute of a man steps forward from Geezers FC. But the Greeks centre forward has had it away on his toes. ""Where's Achilles?"" bellows Agamemnon, reminding us that this is an age when men were men and sheep were nervous. A soldier is dispatched to a hut where a dirty haired rock God is crashed out with two birds, natch. ""Oi, Kills, the boss says get your....self to the pitch, post Hector prompt!"" ""Leave it out. I've got a hangover."" Hair of the dog later, Achilles gets himself to the gig. ""I should kick your a**, kid!"" Yells Aggy. ""Oh, yeah, well your mouthwash ain't makin' it"", Achilles comes back with. With a nonchalance Perry Como would envy, Achilles legs it towards the giant. Drop kick. Blinding left 'ook. Our 'enry goes face down. Sorted. Well, that's me sold on the film. I liked classical civilization as a kid and my sister says I've been in the closet longer than a geriatric moth, so it wasn't even a hard sell.Brad Pitt is the business in this film. He plays Achilles as a living spear, and as you know a spear has two sides (this is where the review collapses into pretension.) When he gets a visit from a grieving father, his face crumples as if to say ""don't lay this heavy trip on me, dude!"" Remember Pitt's mannered performance in SE7EN? He no longer acts like he's got something to prove and the result is entertaining.There's very little I don't like about this film. The sacking of Troy is deflated by an elegiac soundtrack. There's one of those long winded death scenes where they turn down the volume and the cast of thousands suddenly disappear to the John. When Hector exits stage left, a lot of the film's heart goes with him. Not really a criticism, as the same happens in real life when a great warrior checks out. Apart from that, this is one of the best films I've seen. The spectacle and violence is staggering. See it while you can on as big a screen as you can find because I've a hunch it's not going to be around for long, judging by the poor turn out.

He is joined in preparing for war with Troy, by his worthless brother, Agamemnon, King of Greece, who sees an opportunity to expand his power and influence, and for plenty of plunder and riches.Under the leadership of Paris' father King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his brother the heroic warrior Hector (Eric Bana), the Trojans put up a spirited and strong defense against the invading Greek armies. The champion of the Greeks is the invincible warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), who hates Agamemnon, but his come to fight to immortalize his own name, in line with the prophecy by his seer mother.Brad Pitt did pull off his role as Achilles, though I was skeptical whether he would BEFORE the movie.Though he was not as good as Eric Bana in his superb and thoughtful portrayal of Hector.Three notable roles by three beautiful women.

852135,A2VOIE123XM7T5,B0002Z0EXQ,G M. Stathis,"[5, 5]","Judging from the initial reactions of purists, this writer included, many viewers were generally offended by Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 interpretation of the epic tale of Achilles, Hector, and Helen of Troy.  Clearly, it is not Homer, well, not exactly.  But then the various intertwining stories that introduced me to this wonderful tale as told by my Greek grandfather were not pure Homer either.  Petersen took great dramatic license and mixed Homer (not without a good deal of exclusion...the gods and goddesses, numerous characters such as Hecuba and Cassandra) with Virgil and a good deal of Hollywood for his film version of ""Troy.""  Having just viewed the ""Director's Cut,"" I must admit that Homeric purity set aside, it works pretty well as a retelling of the tale, despite some alterations in story that simply warrant a shake of the head.  And yes, this cut is better than the theatrical version, certainly more graphic in every sense.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is really remarkable, Eric Bana as Hector is fine, Sean Bean's Odysseus ""the sacker of cities"" is first rate, Diane Kruger's Helen worked for me, Peter O'Toole is a heart-rending Priam, and most of the rest of the cast is certainly serviceable.  The production is grand, and even James Horner's last minute replacement score (underrated) works well.  Despite the complaints, Petersen gets some of the scenes just right, especially the ""fleet footed"" Achilles both in battle and particularly later in his touching scene with Priam.  And some of his touches from non-Homeric works such as Virgil are quite clever at times.  It all ends with an ironic touch, not the funeral pyre of Hector ""tamer of horses,"" but that of Achilles which actually accentuates the point that this is still primarily the story of Achilles, not of Helen of Troy, and this Petersen gets right.  I don't know if ""The Iliad,"" ""The Odyssey,"" or even ""The Aeneid"" can ever be produced adequately on the screen, but this is a worthy effort in hindsight, even if it is not quite a Homeric one.",3,"A Flawed But Worthy ""Troy""",1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,2028,"['Judging', 'initial', 'reactions', 'purists', 'writer', 'included', 'many', 'viewers', 'were', 'generally', 'offended', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', '2004', 'interpretation', 'epic', 'tale', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Clearly', 'not', 'Homer', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'then', 'various', 'intertwining', 'stories', 'introduced', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'told', 'Greek', 'grandfather', 'were', 'not', 'pure', 'Homer', 'either', 'Petersen', 'took', 'great', 'dramatic', 'license', 'mixed', 'Homer', 'not', 'good', 'deal', 'exclusion', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'numerous', 'characters', 'such', 'Hecuba', 'Cassandra', 'Virgil', 'good', 'deal', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'version', 'Troy', 'Having', 'just', 'viewed', 'Director', 'Cut', 'must', 'admit', 'Homeric', 'purity', 'set', 'aside', 'pretty', 'well', 'retelling', 'tale', 'alterations', 'story', 'simply', 'warrant', 'shake', 'head', 'yes', 'cut', 'better', 'theatrical', 'version', 'certainly', 'more', 'graphic', 'sense', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'really', 'remarkable', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'fine', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'sacker', 'cities', 'first', 'rate', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'worked', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'heart-rending', 'Priam', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'certainly', 'serviceable', 'production', 'grand', 'even', 'James', 'Horner', 'last', 'minute', 'replacement', 'score', 'underrated', 'well', 'complaints', 'Petersen', 'scenes', 'just', 'right', 'especially', 'fleet', 'footed', 'Achilles', 'battle', 'particularly', 'later', 'touching', 'scene', 'Priam', 'touches', 'non-Homeric', 'works', 'such', 'Virgil', 'are', 'quite', 'clever', 'times', 'ironic', 'touch', 'not', 'funeral', 'pyre', 'Hector', 'tamer', 'horses', 'Achilles', 'actually', 'point', 'still', 'primarily', 'story', 'Achilles', 'not', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Petersen', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Iliad', 'Odyssey', 'even', 'Aeneid', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'produced', 'adequately', 'screen', 'worthy', 'effort', 'hindsight', 'even', 'not', 'quite', 'Homeric', 'one']",N/A
852136,A16FUU8WW76QFY,B0002Z0EXQ,gork57,"[0, 0]","I really did look forward to ""Troy"", Wolfgang Peterson's epic version of the Iliad.  Alas, there is some good, and some bad in the monumental production ($200 million) of the Greek vs. Trojan saga. Overall I was disappointed.Did I mention that it is huge?  There are vast numbers of computer generated soldiers, 1000 Greek warships, and gigantic fortifications of Troy, the city under siege.  Somehow I just don't think this is what Homer had in mind when he wrote the epic poem more than 3,000 years ago.  It all looks pretty, but the film has no soul.A buffed-out Brad Pitt plays the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, but somehow the ancient Rambo just doesn't fit his style.  He seems like a pufferfish trying to fill the big shoes of this historic giant.  Pitt is a superb actor, but I agree with the critics who've stated that he is miscast in the role.  The one fellow who does very well in this film is Eric Bana, who gives his portrayal of the Trojan hero Hector a real conscience.  Hector sees what is coming, but his stature among the Trojan nobility means duty comes first-whatever the cost.  The other characters such as Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) are again physically attractive and uninteresting at the same time.  Peter O'Toole's King Priam says 'It is the will of the Gods' an awful lot.The story is by now well known to just about anyone who can read.  Let's just say that the interaction between mortal and gods in the book are dispensed with in favor of man vs. man conflict.  The romance between Paris and Helen, which is what is supposed to have started the war in the first place, is largely shunted aside in favor of the huge battle scenes-there is virtually no chemistry between Bloom and Kruger.The battle scenes are well done, but after awhile one begins to wonder if that is all there is to this film (my wife did).

852137,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002Z0EXQ,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","The 2004 screen adaptation of Homers `Illiad' by David Benioff (who currently is regaling us with `Game of Thrones') is director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm) at his longest.  Clocking in at 196 minutes this Director's cut adds more gore and more sex and a bit of filling in the holes left by the initial edit of the movie (though for some reason the physical relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is essentially ignored...).  TROY is a film worth re-visiting for all its spectacle and costume drama.It is the year 1250 B.C. during the late Bronze age. Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris (Orlando Bloom), the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to leave her husband, Menelaus (Brandon Gleason), and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles (Brad Pitt at his buff body best), the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans. But they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy (Eric Bana). The whole movie shows their battle struggles and the foreshadowing of fate.The cast is packed with many Hollywood stars and fine stage and British actors including Julian Glover, the imposing Nathan Jones whose Boagrius unsuccessfully fights Achilles, John Shrapnel, Mark Lewis Jones, a very young and very under developed Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Peter O'Toole, James Cosmo, Nigel Terry, Owain Yeoman (now of The Mentalist), Saffron Burrows, Rose Byrne, and Vincent Regan. The musical score, initiated by Gabriel Yared and finalized by James Horner includes some nice passages, and a lot of `borrowing' from Shostakovich symphonies.  In all it is spectacular to watch and the Director's cut does indeed flesh out more of the characters than the theatrical version.  It wears well.

Also, Brad Pitt as Achilles was quite impressive..Brad definitely exudes a great deal of presence in this film and his fight scene with Eric Bana as Hector reminded me of the fight scene between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon..very intense and cool..I thought the opening sequence where Achilles deposes of Boagrius was a great way to start the film.  Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Saffron Burrows were amazing in the film and created an emotional tapestry within the framework of the film..Peter O'Toole's character Priam was really great in a scene with Brad Pitt..I won't go into the details in case the readers do not know the whole story but it is very emotional..probably the best acting sequence in the film..Now Orlando Bloom seems very underutilized in this film..compared to his appearance in Pirates of the Caribbean..I read somewhere that Brad Pitt worked out for 6 months prior to making this film and you can tell.

852139,A1CRE598L3RWD1,B0002Z0EXQ,G.Reed,"[3, 4]","Overall,this movie was okay. At first, being an avid fan of Homer's Iliad, and of Greek mythology, I was utterly dissapointed and surprised with the inacuracy of this picture. Not only was the casting off, but also tons of people who survived the Iliad die, and tons who die live! Many characters (ie. Cassandra, Hecuba, the Amazons,) are excluded, when they would have made the film better. Too much of the film is spent on shots of Achilles (Brad Pitt) walking around or gazing meditatively in the sky with his shirt off, or spouting philosphical dribble.But, if one considers the movie itself, not comparing it to the Iliad, it was not displeasing. The cinematography was great, with breathtaking scenes, as were the sets, which were acurate with their thick columns and primitive looking statues. The shots of the ships heading for Troy, the city itself, and its tragc, but darkly beautiful, distruction- a proud and beautiful city glowing with fire, statues toppling...an empire at its defeat. Hector and Andromache were very well played, and Orlando Bloom did a good job being a spoiled, cowardly prince, which was probably not hard for him, being so close to what he is. Sean Bean was a wonderful Odysseus, witty and clever, and also Agamemnon was quite good, though he differed in character greatly from the Agamemnon of the Iliad. Briseis was well developed and clever also. The music was probably the best part of this movie, with great climactic pieces (such as the death of Achilles) and slow, erie songs that fit the scenes. The drums in The Death of Hector are amazing, and the tragic, beautiful music played during the destruction of the city is heartwrenchingly good. I greatly recommend the soundtrack to any fans of the movie or interested consumers. The special effects were amazing, and the battle scenes were well done. I especially loved the Trojan attack on the Greek camp with the balls of flaming straw. It was pretty ingenious. Leave it to Hector.Reguarding life and death of the characters- (this contains spoilers, obviously,) I thought it was fitting that Agamenmom die as he was painted out as a nasty, greedy, selfish tyrant, and the way in which he was killed was awesome. When I saw Briseis, the seemingly helpless girl in the clutches of the tyrant, reveal the dagger in her palm, I was exhilerated. If he had to go, it was a good way. The death of Menelaus was not as good, and I felt it should have been ommitted. Brad Pitt did a terrible job dying in the film, taking about ten minutes to talk to Briseis, then promptly falling over and dying. I felt that Paris should have died, not just because Orlando Bloom practically ruined the movie with his dreadfully cheesy overdone acting, but just because it should not have been a happy ending with Paris and Helen together happily ever after. The death of Hector was devestating, but well done, and necessary. The fact that Helen fled with Andromache into the tunnels below the city was strange- in the Iliad she's taken back to Mycenae and lives there for the rest of her life, and Andromache is also, though she's enslaved, reduced to a prisoner, watching helplessly as her baby is thrown off of the walls of Troy because he's seen as a threat, an avenger of his father. So, save the death of Agamemnon, and that of Hector, the deaths were not very good. Few and far between.Overall, Troy is a mediocre take-off of a great epic, but a good film all the same, though it cowers in the shadow of Homer's Iliad.",3,Would it kill them to be acurate?,1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,3493,"['Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'first', 'being', 'avid', 'fan', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'was', 'utterly', 'dissapointed', 'surprised', 'inacuracy', 'picture', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'casting', 'off', 'also', 'tons', 'people', 'who', 'survived', 'Iliad', 'die', 'tons', 'who', 'die', 'live', 'Many', 'characters', 'ie', 'Cassandra', 'Hecuba', 'Amazons', 'are', 'excluded', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'better', 'Too', 'much', 'film', 'spent', 'shots', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'walking', 'around', 'gazing', 'meditatively', 'sky', 'shirt', 'off', 'spouting', 'philosphical', 'dribble.But', 'one', 'movie', 'not', 'comparing', 'Iliad', 'was', 'not', 'displeasing', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'were', 'sets', 'were', 'acurate', 'thick', 'columns', 'primitive', 'looking', 'statues', 'shots', 'ships', 'heading', 'Troy', 'city', 'tragc', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'distruction-', 'proud', 'beautiful', 'city', 'glowing', 'fire', 'statues', 'toppling', 'empire', 'defeat', 'Hector', 'Andromache', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'spoiled', 'cowardly', 'prince', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'hard', 'being', 'so', 'close', 'what', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Odysseus', 'witty', 'clever', 'also', 'Agamemnon', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'differed', 'character', 'greatly', 'Agamemnon', 'Iliad', 'Briseis', 'was', 'well', 'developed', 'clever', 'also', 'music', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'great', 'climactic', 'pieces', 'such', 'death', 'Achilles', 'slow', 'erie', 'songs', 'fit', 'scenes', 'drums', 'Death', 'Hector', 'are', 'amazing', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'music', 'played', 'destruction', 'city', 'heartwrenchingly', 'good', 'greatly', 'recommend', 'soundtrack', 'fans', 'movie', 'interested', 'consumers', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'loved', 'Trojan', 'attack', 'Greek', 'camp', 'balls', 'flaming', 'straw', 'was', 'pretty', 'ingenious', 'Leave', 'Hector.Reguarding', 'life', 'death', 'characters-', 'spoilers', 'obviously', 'thought', 'was', 'fitting', 'Agamenmom', 'die', 'was', 'painted', 'out', 'nasty', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'tyrant', 'way', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'awesome', 'When', 'saw', 'Briseis', 'seemingly', 'helpless', 'girl', 'clutches', 'tyrant', 'reveal', 'dagger', 'palm', 'was', 'exhilerated', 'had', 'go', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'death', 'Menelaus', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ommitted', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'dying', 'film', 'taking', 'ten', 'minutes', 'talk', 'Briseis', 'then', 'promptly', 'falling', 'dying', 'felt', 'Paris', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'not', 'just', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'practically', 'ruined', 'movie', 'dreadfully', 'cheesy', 'overdone', 'acting', 'just', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'ending', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'together', 'happily', 'ever', 'death', 'Hector', 'was', 'devestating', 'well', 'done', 'necessary', 'fact', 'Helen', 'fled', 'Andromache', 'tunnels', 'city', 'was', 'strange-', 'Iliad', 'taken', 'back', 'Mycenae', 'rest', 'life', 'Andromache', 'also', 'enslaved', 'reduced', 'prisoner', 'watching', 'helplessly', 'baby', 'thrown', 'walls', 'Troy', 'seen', 'threat', 'avenger', 'father', 'So', 'save', 'death', 'Agamemnon', 'Hector', 'deaths', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Few', 'far', 'between.Overall', 'Troy', 'mediocre', 'take-off', 'great', 'epic', 'good', 'film', 'same', 'shadow', 'Homer', 'Iliad']",N/A

A few years later, I read that a Director's Cut of the movie had been released, and I checked out the reviews on it, to see if it was even worth it.Is the Director's Cut worth it? YES, YES, YES and YES!!!!I saw the Director's Cut of the movie a few hours ago, and I have to say that it's much better than the theatrical cut of the film. More story has been added, giving the film much needed drama which was lacking in the original release print, along with more violence, two extended scenes with female nudity and an extended sex scene. MILD SPOILERS!!! The additional material includes an extended scene where Priam (played by the excellent Peter O'Toole) tells Hector (Eric Bana) why he has decided to let the Greeks beseige Troy, along with a scene where Hector suspects that Paris (Orlando Bloom) is sleeping with the fisherman's wife and a brief scene extension of the party, giving Helen (Diane Kruger) the motivation for falling in love with Paris. SPOILERS OVER!!! It sucks, however, that Warner Bros. wouldn't let Mr. Petersen use Gabriel Yared's infinitely superior score, which they had the stupidity to reject in favour of a repetitive, but somewhat interesting, score from Mr. Horner. At least, they let him use the track Sparta for the scene where Menelaus is toasting to peace. I think it's more accurate to the period than Horner's score for that scene. Using cues from The Count Of Monte Cristo and Planet Of The Apes was also a good choice. And finally, the song performed by Josh Groban over the end credits of the theatrical cut is gone, and replaced with proper music score. The song Remember Me is fine as a stand-alone song, but it was just wrong for TROY. I wonder what the Director's Cut would have been like, had Warner Bros. allowed Mr. Petersen to use Mr. Yared's more appropriate and lushful score, instead of Mr. Horner's score. Thankfully, the music by Mr. Horner has been re-edited for the Director's Cut, and thus gives the film a natural musical progression.

Let it be noted however, that the story in the film is primarily Homer's story, but I'll not to go into details such as who died and shouldn't have, who lived and shouldn't have, who was omitted and shouldn't have been, etc..., I'll leave it to other reviewers to pick through the story.I watched it with certain expectations of my own, namely that historically it ""could"" have happened, with emphasis on things like accuracy in warfare, costumes, cultural aspects and so on, and I must say this disappointed my most open-minded expectations.  Homer wrote about a war that can't be supported archeologically (the details), so a lot in the Iliad is actually based more on Homers current culture, than history.  Essentially Wolfgang Peterson had an end product that isn't the Iliad, AND can't be supported historically.To begin with, neither the Mycenaeans (Greeks) nor the Trojans had a cavalry (and it is unlikely that they rode horses -my husband and I disagree as to whether the Trojans could ride horses.  In the Iliad, Hector is mentioned as ""breaker of horses"", but I'm not sure that meant he could ride them, not that Homer would have known.  The Trojans would have been more exposed to the eastern cultures, who were beginning to develop riding skills, so it's possible.).  Donkeys were generally used for riding and horses for pulling things such as, oh, say, CHARIOTS, which were the ""war machine"" of choice for the nobles/war lords.  The first ""real"" evidence of mounted cavalry came from the Assyrians a bit latter in time, however there is a case to be made that the Amazons were the first to use cavalry, which they used in the Trojan war.  In any event there would have been chariot battles, and Achilles (and his lover Patroclus) would have utilized this more than their feet (- picture a young rich guy with a nice car hoofing it around town).  The Amazons would have made a striking contrast to everybody else and I was sorry they weren't used.  Otherwise, weapons were generally typical at the time and I was unable to identify the weapon used by Greater Ajax, nor am I familiar with the two weapon approach so popular in movies today.  I can gloss over the weapons (barely), but can somebody tell me what's with the giant burning balls of yarn??  Furthermore, the turtle or a variation of it is not really associated with this era (i.e. a group of soldiers advancing under cover of their shields in a tight group).  That's not to say it couldn't have been used in a singular instance by a creative commander, but again this is not something that became the norm at that time, nor the warfare we associate with the Trojan war.The women's clothing is typically misrepresented by the ""they all wore togas"" crowd.  The Mycenaeans closely followed the Minoan (earlier Greeks) dress; i.e. tight upper bodice, with a wide flowing lower portion.  The Minoan fashion was such that the bodice hooked under the [...], leaving them exposed.  With the Mycenaeans they were either exposed or covered.  We have this information from the artwork, mostly pottery of the time, and it's not difficult to look up for someone with a Hollywood budget.  The drapey, flowing clothing Helen wore in the film, surfaced during or after the ""Greek dark ages"", sometime before Homer's time.  I do not know how the Trojan women would have dressed, but this may have been an east meets west situation (the Assyrians to the east were draped and veiled, with Troy geographically in between , but closer to Greece) - of course this is probably easy to look up as well.  The priests, and priestesses would probably have been similar to the Mycenaeans, due to their shared religious beliefs.As to the cultural aspects, the old sand and sandals epics were by far less prudish.  There was always hinting and innuendo, and the scripts were clever and well written.  They may not have been a match in eye candy, but they tried harder to create a more realistic impression.  The Achilles/Patroclus ""relationship"" (one might kill to avenge one's best friend, or cousin - but the desecration of a body goes beyond that kind of relationship - especially with an experienced warrior), and the costumes are an example of this.  As to cremation, it was common enough during Homer's time, however Mycenaean culture entombed their dead in a similar way to the Egyptians.  Maybe in battlefield instances the dead would be quickly cremated (cremation wasn't unheard of) in order to dispose of them, but kings and leaders would be disposed of in a way that befitted them according to their own culture.  The little I have read about the excavations at Troy also indicate burial on the Trojan side.  -  All in all, a very disappointing movie.",1,Typical Hollywood - impressive budget - no

Its not at all exaggerated despite the countless number of characters with very well defined attributes. Brad Pitt was larger than life in this film.Its impossible to have favourites in Troy but the one character in this film that left me spellbound with his integrity and isolation of soul was ""Hector""(Eric Bana) There were certain scenes with him in the film that bought out the Trojan in me.It'll be an absolute waste of time trying to figure out what I disliked about the film because I was completely spellbound and awestruck by the dialogues. I've lost count on the number of times a dialogue made me feel absolutely awakened and insignificant.The one dialogue I do waguely remember was the scene in which the little kid,messenger,demands Achillies presence at the war grounds. The kid says ""I wouldn't fight a man as big as him."" And Pitt(Achillies) replies "" ..thats why your name will not be remembered"" Now I dont know what that did to the audience and how the audience in the theater reacted to it but it awoke a certain rage in me. I stood up and cheered for some reason beyond me.Always felt the insignificant need provocation and if this film doesnt certify everything I stand for and re-enforce all of its endless number of salutes it demands then nothing ever will.I know I am noone to judge something as mangamous as this but in my most honest opinion this film killed doubts in the line of thought imbred in me. A lot of dialogues and scenes in the film cannot be forgotten. I demand of everyone reading to go watch this film. Either rent the DVD or buy it but please watch it for your own good.I borrowed a friend's DVD . I can't wait to give it a second watch cause its an education in itself.

This is movie with one major weakness. The actors try their best, the directing is more or less competent, and of course the special effects and fight choreography are beyond reproach in this day and age; unfortunately, with this script, all of that is worth exactly nothing. No actor could deliver a decent performance, given these lines to read.There are two major things which begin to get on your nerves after awhile, like corrupt motifs. The first is the scene in which a character stares piercingly either at the camera or at the horizon. If they eliminated even half of the horizon-gazing, this movie would be a good ten minutes shorter. Silence does not neccesarily equal drama. But this is a minor sin compared to other repeated scene, the one in which some character makes a statement to the effect of, ""This entire horrible war is all my fault. If I do such and such a thing, it could all be over right now"" - and then some other character tries to dissuade them, and succeeds in no more than five lines, and the entire moral crisis is suddenly forgotten. This happens again and again. Also there are just minor things that are ridiculously clumsy, like the way in which both huge armies suddenly stop fighting as soon as Hector joins swords with Petrollocus, because apparently everybody on the entire battlefield has a bird's-eye view of the situation and is not just occupied with the spear-wielding guy currently trying to kill him. And also there needed to be less aimless pondering about the reasons for fighting, when these circular discussions never really lead to any moral revelations. And I didn't particularly like the way people like Hector's wife and child were wheeled onscreen just to provide a spot of human interest and never given anything resembling characters.The only time when this movie is consistently enjoyable is when Ajax is mauling people with his giant hammer.

There are so many things that can go wrong, and some things did in this expensive-- costs were nearly two hundred millions dollars-- epic ""inspired"" by Homer's ILIAD.First the good: there are certainly many things to like about this movie. Although the film is about three hours long, the action moves rapidly. The ship scenes as well are the hand-to-hand combat battles are quite amazing and really do become epic-like. Some of the acting is terrific as well. Eric Bana as Hector gives a first-rate performance. Julie Christie in a small role as Achilles' mother is also great. But Peter O'Toole as King Priam-- British accent notwithstanding-- is simply wonderful. (Of course he is no stranger to period pieces with movies such as BECKET, LION IN WINTER and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA under his belt.) The scene where he approaches Achilles to beg for the dead body of his beloved son Hector achieves high tragedy, something that rarely happens in epics. Just as in grand opera with its usual outrageous plots, when real acting occurs, it's all the more appreciated.Then those things that really aren't that significant (so-so). First, the director plays hard and fast with the original story; but after all, it's just his inspiration, not his roadmap. Remember: the movie is not the book. There are also missed opportunities. For instance, there is a beautifully scene in the ILIAD when Hector goes off to battle and sees his wife and child for what will be the last time. Because he is wearing his helmet, his baby son does not recognize him and cries. This is one of the most touching scenes in all of the ILIAD. I thought the director was setting us up for that in this movie. The child cries as Hector says goodbye, however, and then puts on his helmet later.Finally the bad: Orlando Bloom as Paris is totally unconvincing as someone Helen would even look at. And Brad Pitt, for all his buffed-up beauty, is still Brad Pitt, only with long hair and in ancient Grecian drag. He is completely miscast as the sober, brooding, sulking Achilles.The film is worth seeing, however, for all the battles and the fine acting by Peter O'Toole.",3,"A Mixed Bag: The Good, Bad, So-So",1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2185,"['Making', 'kinds', 'movies', 'fraught', 'dangers', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'things', 'did', 'expensive', 'costs', 'were', 'nearly', 'two', 'hundred', 'millions', 'dollars', 'epic', 'inspired', 'Homer', 'ILIAD.First', 'good', 'are', 'certainly', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'action', 'rapidly', 'ship', 'scenes', 'well', 'are', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'battles', 'are', 'quite', 'amazing', 'really', 'do', 'become', 'epic-like', 'acting', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'small', 'role', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'also', 'great', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'King', 'Priam', 'British', 'accent', 'notwithstanding', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'course', 'stranger', 'period', 'pieces', 'movies', 'such', 'BECKET', 'LION', 'IN', 'WINTER', 'LAWRENCE', 'OF', 'ARABIA', 'belt', 'scene', 'where', 'Achilles', 'beg', 'dead', 'body', 'beloved', 'son', 'Hector', 'high', 'tragedy', 'something', 'rarely', 'epics', 'Just', 'grand', 'opera', 'usual', 'outrageous', 'plots', 'when', 'real', 'acting', 'occurs', 'more', 'appreciated.Then', 'things', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'significant', 'so-so', 'First', 'director', 'hard', 'fast', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'inspiration', 'not', 'roadmap', 'Remember', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'also', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'instance', 'beautifully', 'scene', 'ILIAD', 'when', 'Hector', 'battle', 'wife', 'child', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'wearing', 'helmet', 'baby', 'son', 'not', 'recognize', 'cries', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'ILIAD', 'thought', 'director', 'was', 'setting', 'up', 'movie', 'child', 'cries', 'Hector', 'goodbye', 'however', 'then', 'helmet', 'later.Finally', 'bad', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'someone', 'Helen', 'would', 'even', 'look', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'buffed-up', 'beauty', 'still', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'only', 'long', 'hair', 'ancient', 'Grecian', 'drag', 'completely', 'miscast', 'sober', 'brooding', 'sulking', 'Achilles.The', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'however', 'battles', 'fine', 'acting', 'Peter', ""O'Toole""]",N/A

Nevertheless Petersen makes a wonderful camera work . The cast is not entirely homogeneus . The ravishing presence of O'Toole as Priamo established such rank level than literally he sent to the rest of the cast to a very worthable second level; personally I suppose O' Toole at last will win a prize of the Academy as Best supporting actor in 2005 (though between you and me we know he doesn't need it)  ; Brian Cox as Agamemnon and Brendan Gleason as Menelao are first rate . The very brief presence of Julie Christie as Thetis is unforgettable. Pitt looks a little overacted ; it is absolutely true that no other actor in this moment was more appropiatte than him ; but in my opinion I missed the presence of the inner mood in certain moments of loneliness of Achilles .However the sumptuosity and the epic breathe are still present  all along the film.Orlando Bloom is fine as Paris . He embodies all the cowardness and lack of braveness , and Erik Bana was OK.But beware with Garret Hedlund as Patroclo ; there are certain twist of the real character of him and Hedlund gave a very romantic approach ; Kruger is a very beautiful woman but she looks extremely cool and geometric .The film experiments a visible decline since the Hector death and the Troy invassion . I reall do not know what was going on ; because these crucial moments are told so kinetically without any drop of dark poetry and the serenity of such tragical moment demanded .

Epic films are usually grand in scale and this one is no different, in fact, TROY sometimes almost seems too grand with HUGE sets, big FX, and thundering battle sequences.  What this flick also has in it's favor is a quick, exciting pace, assured direction, and a script that doesn't meander too long where diatribes of honor and war are concerned.  Sure, there is a macho warrior posturing here and there, but those moments are quickly evaded by great action set pieces and beautifully lavish production design.  The performances are decent, and the characters are flushed out with old fashioned conviction.  PITT does ACHILLES with some badass stoic ferocity, and BANA's HECTOR is a noble, compassionate warrior.  The showdown between the two was excellent.  It doesn't overstay it's welcome yet doesn't leave you unsatisfied and keeps you on the fence as to whom you want to win.

It was fun to watch even having read the Iliad several times when I was younger and knowing it is quite flawed compared to it.  That is why it is called Troy and not The Iliad.The producers of this film make no attempt to present this as actual history.  They try to stick to the Iliad as much as possible but there are several realities that cause departure from this.  First off making this a 10 year war would have been very confusing and hard to do. Second hollywood does not know how to stick to a timeless classic and undoubtedly believes it can improve upon one.Despite knowing exactly what was supposed to happen I felt drawn in at every point.  I didn't want people to die that I knew had to.  The only thing I didn't like is that they let Paris live.  I may be mistaken but I am almost certain he was killed.I also wish they would have introduced Odysseus a little more.

The story of Helen -- the face that launched a thousand ships -- who runs away with Paris to his city of Troy is the most classical of all.  People who know or remember The Iliad will find this version frustrating due to the many changes from the original.  Those who don't, won't notice the difference at all.Many people had their doubts about Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles.  It is easy to imagine several other, better stars in the role.  Some of the time it was easy to forget that it is he on the screen, but some of the time he even seems to have difficulty immersing himself in the role.  He was great eye candy for the female audience, however.  Orlando Bloom is believable as Paris, and Sean Bean is almost memorable as Odysseus.  However, the scene stealers were Eric Bana as the brave and true Hector, and Peter O'Toole as Priam.The women's roles were not nearly as strong as they are in the original story and sometimes seem to be included only as backdrops.  Most of us still have difficulty accepting that death camp thin is the epitome of beauty.As is the case in many movies of this genre, the scenery, the large scapes, are wonderful.  This is especially true of the first view of the Greek armada.  The fight scenes are up close and claustrophobic and with the helmets and speed of the action, it's nearly impossible to keep up with who goes down and who survives.Given all of the above, I would have preferred to rated this film a 3 1/2.

852155,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B0002Z0EXQ,Ian Vance,"[28, 38]","To say I was anticipating the cinematic adaptation of *The Illiad* would be a major understatement.  The source text being so rich with epic possibility, I thought that an achievement along the lines of Jackson's *Lord of the Rings* could be possible (...and perhaps, perhaps a trilogy...? O hope, false mistress!).  I queued at a theater in Vancouver, BC on opening day, nervous of an initial negative `buzz' but still confident I would enjoy it - after all, I'd managed to find entertainment in many, many other Hollywood offerings in the past that were, to say the least, of suspect quality.  Thus, imagine my surprise to find *Troy* to be an utter failure as both a film and an adaptation: imagine my angst to watch an opportunity wasted, an epic mediocrity.Perhaps a little back-history is necessary.  I've read *The Illiad* several times and, while in high school, participated in a short thematic theater adaptation.  The book is a classic of historical myth, a powerful condemnation of selfishness and revenge, and a damn fine read in its own right.  *Troy*, in contrast, is a butchery, the shallowest of interpretations, with most of the story altered to fit Hollywood convention - and, by itself, a dull, dire film when compared to almost any other epic of recent note.  Only Oliver Stone's *Alexander* disappointed me more this year, and even that lumbering mess had moments of visual genius: *Troy*, fashioned workmanlike from the hands of Wolfgang Peterson, lacks eve this fleeting grace.  From start to finish it is paint-by-numbers, pedestrian beyond any salvation.Moreover, it is a shameless rape of the source text.  Some `changes' the screenwriter, director and suits seemed to find appropriate:~ Helen of Sparta was contested for marriage by all the kings of Greece.  To ensure peace, Odysseus offered the following compromise: Helen would choose her husband among the regal suitors, and those denied would join in a pact to protect her honor - and that of her husband - by strength of arms.  Helen chose Menalaous of Sparta to be her husband, and lived with him in happiness until Aphrodite whisked her away to Troy and enchanted her to love Paris.  Menalaous was not slain in the Trojan War, and afterward they returned to Sparta to live in renewed harmony.~ Aeneas was not some boy given the sword of Troy purely at random: he was a general and titan of the field, a man of much experience who led his people to Italy and founded the Roman Empire, as chronicled in Virgil's classic *The Aenied*.~ The siege of Troy lasted nine years, not a couple of weeks.~ Hector and Achilles fought during a pitch battle.  Achilles dragged Hector's body around Troy for `many, many days'.  Achilles was slain a good time before the construction of the Trojan Horse; Agamemnon survived the war and returned home, to later find his death at the hands of his wife. (Aeschylus: *The Oresteia*)...I'll stop here to conserve space.  Simply put: so much was changed that the only real similarity between text and film is a few tenuous relationship-strands and important scenes.  The filmmakers obviously knew the extent of their manipulation, and how it would be perceived by the faithful, hence the `inspired by' tag at the end of the film.  Yet there is no excuse for this shambles.  None.  If *Troy* is inspiration, then by Zeus I'd flee, gibbering in terror, from a `revision.'When I heard that Brad Pitt was taking up the mantle of Achilles, I cheered, having taken pleasure in most of the actor's body of work, and, purely aesthetically, admiring the man as a product of rare genetic stock.  His physical tour-de-force in *Fight Club* assured me that he could handle the physical challenge of portraying the mightiest warrior of human myth.  Yet Pitt, I think, sabotaged himself.  After his success with the rather empty *Legends of the Fall*, Pitt eschewed traditional leading-man roles for a more eclectic, subversive series of films; prior to Troy's release he admitted in interviews to caving in on his private decision.  And his boredom shows, o how it shows! I've never seen the man so phone a performance in - mumbling and/or rushing dialogue, forcing passion where passion should come so easily... it seems Pitt spent more time preparing for the role by toning his impressive physique rather than practicing his lines.  During the speech about the `God's envy' he does show a spark; pity the subsequent scene with Briseis undermines this moment with its ridiculously contrived capitulation of hate to lust.Pitt is not alone, however - none of the actors give true nuance.  As a power-hungry Agamemnon, Brian Cox chews the scenery to the point I thought the set-decorators might suggest a change in diet for the sake of sheer preservation: his overacting reaches its nadir at the fall of Troy: ""BURN! BURN!"" Orlando Bloom is given some of the tritest dialogue I've heard in some time, and his paramour, Helen, is hardly a face to launch a thousand ships, much less an acting talent deserving such a pivotal role.  Only Eric Bana and Sean Bean give halfway acceptable performances, and even then it's a far cry from their best work.The score, cobbled together by James Horner in a few weeks after Gabriel Yared's original music was scrapped, does nothing to enhance the material - if anything, with its psuedo-Gladiator screeching, weak percussion and tinny horn-blasting, it serves as a further detriment, highlighting the ham-fisted direction.  Peterson's effort is competent, but lacks drama, intensity and inspiration.  The film does temporarily achieve all three during the battle between Hector and Achilles, but one action setpiece does not a good film make.*Troy*: the biggest example of wasted potential in 2004, and arguably this new century.

It shows that war is a horrible adventure in which motivations are absolutely perverse, perverted and hypocritical. One goes to war for a woman who was stolen from him. Women are nothing but homestead possessions. One goes to war to increase his power by conquering people who resist him. War is a power game that is won or lost after many deaths of soldiers and civilians who are not supposed to question any point but only to obey. War is blind obedience for the soldiers and blind submission for the civilians. One goes to war for the pleasure of fighting to show his prowess, his courage, his  invincibility  and yet he will be killed in the heart of victory because no one is invincible, no war is a clean parade on an empty boulevard. Then supplementary motivations appear during the fighting or the discussions and rivalries among chiefs. It is such events, like the killing of a cousin, the manhandling of a prisoner, or any dramatic event, that can change the course of a war and bring into the battle people who wanted to remain neutral. War is a big pot in which spiders and predators are cooking, some enemies, some allies. Finally most soldiers are going into the war with only one objective : looting and taking advantage of the situation to satisfy their basic and repulsive instincts to hurt, torture, maim and enjoy the barbarity of such acts. Finally a war is always lost in the long run and the victors are vanquished as Handel would say in Alexander's Feast. A few of the princes of Troy will escape and they will create Rome who will eventually conquer Greece and submit them to their power. History is always a vengeful game if the will, interests and peace of the people are not taken into account. Finally a war can only be won through a genocide : kill all your enemies and you will carry the day. This film is the exposure of war as a crime against humanity. Yet there are in this film a few, very few, but a few nevertheless, scenes that redeem such horror. The  invincible  Achilles is vanquished by a sudden and unexplainable love that leads him into a mistake and a trap, and there is no escape, no pardon, no tolerance, no considering the honorable actions of before. He is an enemy, so he has to be killed. Everyone will like the Trojan horse immensely that shows a war is always won through perfidy, ruse, deception and the exploitation of the gullibility of the opponents. Nothong has changed except that we are more conscious and sensitive to crime and perverse actions, and that we have media who will expose any tresspassing from some guideline. War is based on lies but the media have the responsibility to expose such lies and when they are exposed the war is lost for the liars who are exposed as such at the same time. Yet the film is short on the real stakes of this war : the control of eastern commercial routes and the danger such a strategic position represents for those who are thus controlled by this commercial power.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,There is no war that can be redeemed,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,3077,"['film', 'beautiful', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'anyway', 'change', 'face', 'world', 'war', 'horrible', 'adventure', 'motivations', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perverse', 'perverted', 'hypocritical', 'One', 'war', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'stolen', 'Women', 'are', 'nothing', 'homestead', 'possessions', 'One', 'war', 'increase', 'power', 'conquering', 'people', 'who', 'resist', 'War', 'power', 'game', 'won', 'lost', 'many', 'deaths', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'question', 'point', 'only', 'obey', 'War', 'blind', 'obedience', 'soldiers', 'blind', 'submission', 'civilians', 'One', 'war', 'pleasure', 'fighting', 'show', 'prowess', 'courage', 'invincibility', 'yet', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'heart', 'victory', 'one', 'invincible', 'war', 'clean', 'parade', 'empty', 'boulevard', 'Then', 'supplementary', 'motivations', 'appear', 'fighting', 'discussions', 'rivalries', 'chiefs', 'such', 'events', 'killing', 'cousin', 'manhandling', 'prisoner', 'dramatic', 'event', 'can', 'change', 'course', 'war', 'bring', 'battle', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'remain', 'neutral', 'War', 'big', 'pot', 'spiders', 'predators', 'are', 'cooking', 'enemies', 'allies', 'Finally', 'most', 'soldiers', 'are', 'going', 'war', 'only', 'one', 'objective', 'looting', 'taking', 'advantage', 'situation', 'satisfy', 'basic', 'repulsive', 'instincts', 'hurt', 'torture', 'maim', 'enjoy', 'barbarity', 'such', 'acts', 'Finally', 'war', 'always', 'lost', 'long', 'run', 'victors', 'are', 'vanquished', 'Handel', 'would', 'say', 'Alexander', 'Feast', 'A', 'few', 'princes', 'Troy', 'will', 'escape', 'will', 'create', 'Rome', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'conquer', 'Greece', 'submit', 'power', 'History', 'always', 'vengeful', 'game', 'will', 'interests', 'peace', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'taken', 'account', 'Finally', 'war', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'won', 'genocide', 'kill', 'enemies', 'will', 'carry', 'day', 'film', 'exposure', 'war', 'crime', 'humanity', 'are', 'film', 'few', 'very', 'few', 'few', 'nevertheless', 'scenes', 'redeem', 'such', 'horror', 'invincible', 'Achilles', 'vanquished', 'sudden', 'unexplainable', 'love', 'mistake', 'trap', 'escape', 'pardon', 'tolerance', 'considering', 'honorable', 'actions', 'before', 'enemy', 'be', 'killed', 'Everyone', 'will', 'like', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'immensely', 'war', 'always', 'won', 'perfidy', 'ruse', 'deception', 'exploitation', 'gullibility', 'opponents', 'Nothong', 'changed', 'are', 'more', 'conscious', 'sensitive', 'crime', 'perverse', 'actions', 'have', 'media', 'who', 'will', 'expose', 'tresspassing', 'guideline', 'War', 'based', 'lies', 'media', 'have', 'responsibility', 'expose', 'such', 'lies', 'when', 'are', 'exposed', 'war', 'lost', 'liars', 'who', 'are', 'exposed', 'such', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'short', 'real', 'stakes', 'war', 'control', 'eastern', 'commercial', 'routes', 'danger', 'strategic', 'position', 'who', 'are', 'thus', 'controlled', 'commercial', 'power.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The battle scenes--generally the hardest thing to stage---are some of the best in recent memory. The sequences that feature champions of each army in one-on-one confrontations are vivid and real.  I also enjoyed the way that screenwriter David Benioff cleverly mined the source material for plausible ways to explain many of the story's legendary elements--for instance, Achilles'heel.Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean, Brendon Gleeson, Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne all give each of their respective characters a vibrant on-screen presence. Brad Pitt works well as the preening, self-centered Achilles but a couple of his scenes would have served the film by being left in the editor's bin, especially when his acting calls attention to itself, reminding us we're watching a Movie Star and not an historical character.Most importantly for Blu-ray fans, this version of the disc is well worth the price.

The Iliad is not a romance. Killing off Menalaus half way through the movie--just stupid! Briseis kills Agamemnon after the fall of Troy?  Huh? What are these people thinking?  The list of really unnecessary plot adulterations goes on.  Oh, I know Hollywood producers probably thought they needed a love interest for box office reasons, but even that could have been handled with a little more subtlty and without looking truly ridiculous, which is really all I can say about the ending.  They could have pulled off a really great movie.All that said, I'm still giving this 4 stars.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for this stuff because the TV Helen of Troy, though more true to the story, was a little disappointing.  The Iliad really does need the kind of epic treatment Hollywood can give it, if only Hollywood had the brains and sensitivity to the material they are working with to do it justice.  And there are some pluses in the movie besides just the lavish spectacle. I've heard many people mock the choice of Brad Pitt as Achilles, but I really thought he did the role justice.  His Achilles really has a chip on his shoulder and he sulks through the part in real heroic style.  Whatever else I didn't like about the script I did think it captured what motivated Achilles pretty well, and even the rather modern anti-war touch that came out at times was not overdone.

I saw more of Pitt in the movie scenes then the kings or princes on both sides.  I also didn't see how this girl prisoner would be so angry with him and then turn around sleep with him so quickly.  I just wish that the movie would focus more equally on other important characters and not so much on Brad Pitt.  I also didn't understand why he pranced around naked so much in the movie, just what does that supposed to do for the story?  However, I could sit through this movie a little easier then the movie Alexander which I gave one star rating to because it was so boring.

The BD version is the best version released for audio and video.  The video is a quantum leap above the DVD version as the richness of the detail in sets, clothing, and actors are eye popping.  The audio is a quantum leap in clarity and staging, and complements the imagery to roar scenes into one's living room with hubris and magnificence.  The wider color gamut and superb digital transfer makes many scenes appear real and even super real.  Alas, the movie itself suffers a bit in 2 respects. Music is weaker and less striking, as a different score is used, and some scenes are filled with synthesizer scores that are clearly out of step with any of the music.  Filler music is added and borrowed from other movies, and mentioned in the end credits such as taken from Planet of the Apes.

852170,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0002Z0EXQ,Jason,"[0, 0]","Based on Homer's Illiad, there is an ironic connection to how this movie was received.  Some may have been wary of another big-budget Hollywood production, and thought of the classic proverb, ""beware those who would bring false gifts.""  The concern was unwarranted, as this movie is stunning in every way from beginning to end, and PACKED with major players from the ultimate battle movies.  Warriors from300,The Lord of the Rings, andBraveheartall do battle in one movie!Agamemnon (Brian Cox - who was awesome in Braveheart as Argyle Wallace and showed enough range to be hilarious as Captain O'Hagan inSuper Troopers) is a power hungry king who has challenged enough other kings to control most of Greece.  The only land that stands in his way of controlling the Aegean is Troy, ruled by pacifist-leaning Priam (Peter O'Toole).  Boromir from LOTR (Sean Bean) - plays Odysseus, a sycophant king to the now ruler of kings, Agamemnon.  Odysseus just happens to be a mentor and friend to the greatest warrior ever, Achilles (Pitt).  Fighting alongside Achilles is his second-in-command, Eudorus (Vincent Regan).  You will recognize him as the guy who was awesome as Leonidas's captain in 300.As peace is being worked out between Agamemnon's Greek forces and the emerging armies of Troy, two Trojan princes are treated as guests by Agamemnon: Prince Hector (Eric Bana) is his land's greatest warrior; and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom aka Legolas from LOTR) is his younger, ""Don Juan"" brother.  When they leave they have an extra passenger, Helen (Diane Kruger) - who is now ""of Troy"" but was once ""of Sparta"" - and the peace being discussed is destroyed because she just happens to be married to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson - Hamish Campbell from Braveheart), Agamemnon's brother.  Now disgraced, Menelaus gives Agamemnon the reason he needed for war with Troy, a previously unbreached city thought undefeatable.  And, just for good measure, the rugged Campbell father from Braveheart plays Glaucus (James Cosmo), a top soldier in the Trojan Army.If all this is confusing, don't worry; the movie is still great.  Enjoy the epic war scenes similar to the movies from which they have borrowed cast members, tragically snicker at the fact that you know what the ""Trojan Horse"" is all about (and that the city of Troy falls to such a ridiculous trick), and revel in a classic sword battle between Achilles and Hector.  Actually, try not to enjoy one battle more than others, because this movie is saturated with great action like Achilles' complete domination of the monstrous Thessalian warrior Boagrius (Nathan Jones aka Petr fromThe Condemned).From beginning to end this movie is superb.  The lighting, acting, scenery, musical score, costume design and casting all reflect impressively on the entire movie's efforts.  I didn't care to go too much into the historical aspect of the movie, but from what I can tell all the major details fairly consistent with the truth.

His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated in the film, TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive ""Trojan Horse.""

852173,AFSQ6YUV4ZGYD,B0002Z0EXQ,jct456,"[2, 2]","Many reviewers have complained that the movie ""Troy"" is not completely true to the Iliad in portraying the characters and events of the Trojan War. This is unfair. Even in ancient times, the Iliad was not the only version of the Trojan War stories, and the Iliad which has come down to us may not be the only version that was performed. The Iliad only tells what happened in the space of 50 days in the 9th year of the war, although it alludes in passing to events that happened before and after these 50 days. Like the whole Camelot cycle which developed through the Dark and Middle Ages, the Trojan War cycle picked up and incorporated the best (and contradictory) legends over a millennium from Greece and Asia Minor.  Modern historical fiction has been even more imaginative in retelling the stories.  Further, it has been traditional for a long time not to portray Homer's literary gods in other tellings of the War.  ""Troy"" does NOT forget the gods - the presence of the gods is always there in the way the humans (especially Priam, Briseis, and Achilles) refer to their existence.The movie ""Troy"" looks at what might have been the historical Bronze Age kernel for the legends and does a wonderful, powerful job of doing so.  It specifically says ""INSPIRED by the Iliad"".  If you want to see a movie which hews closer to the plot line of the Iliad, see instead the 1962 sword and sandals movie ""Fury of Achilles"".  I think Peterson's is a monumental achievement, and I do not tire of watching this movie (I have not seen the director's cut yet).The movie is very good at exploring the essence of the characters which have come down to us and the Greek Dark Ages warrior code portrayed in the Iliad.  We see in Achilles' quest for glory and Odysseus' narration the attempt to find in military glory and song a meaning for our mortality as opposed to the immortality of the gods. We see how the society is too small for the great warrior to fit into. We see in Hector's character of the reluctant warrior the distinction made between the two warrior codes of the aggressive quest for glory and the defensive warrior who defends a civilized city.  The movie's Priam is like that in the Iliad - he relies on a religious fatalism to avoid having to make difficult decisions.  Paris is correctly portrayed as a coward and seducer, so you can't blame Orlando Bloom for his portrayal of Paris.On the whole the acting is quite good.  I am not a Brad Pitt fan, but with the possible exception of Daniel Craig, I do not see who else would have had the star power, beauty, and grace to BE Achilles.  Eric Bana was perfect as Hector - valiant but overmatched (and emblematic of the Trojans as a whole), with his expressive, soft, anguished eyes, and he and Andromache (Saffron Burrows) had a true chemistry which intensified the sad fate of this loving couple.If I have one major criticsm, it is that the fates of certain characters, which are set in the canon of Western literature, were too radically different. I speak of Agammemnon and Menelaus.  The ending was too conventional, in that the bad guys (which Menelaus was not, really) got bad ends at Troy.  Agammemnon should have returned to Mycenae - there is a whole lot of Greek literature based on that.  We should have had a real sense of the absolute loss and waste of the destruction of Troy, without the catharsis of Agammemnon's death.I still highly recommend this movie, and I especially like James Horner's musical score, which particularly packed a visceral punch in the invasion of the Trojan beach.",5,"""The Iliad"" is not the only version of the Trojan War!",1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,3559,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'Troy', 'not', 'completely', 'true', 'Iliad', 'portraying', 'characters', 'events', 'Trojan', 'War', 'unfair', 'Even', 'ancient', 'times', 'Iliad', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'version', 'Trojan', 'War', 'stories', 'Iliad', 'come', 'down', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'version', 'was', 'performed', 'Iliad', 'only', 'what', 'happened', 'space', '50', 'days', '9th', 'year', 'war', 'passing', 'events', 'happened', '50', 'days', 'whole', 'Camelot', 'cycle', 'developed', 'Dark', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Trojan', 'War', 'cycle', 'picked', 'up', 'incorporated', 'best', 'contradictory', 'millennium', 'Greece', 'Asia', 'Minor', 'Modern', 'historical', 'fiction', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'imaginative', 'retelling', 'stories', 'Further', 'been', 'traditional', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'portray', 'Homer', 'literary', 'gods', 'other', 'tellings', 'War', 'Troy', 'NOT', 'forget', 'gods', 'presence', 'gods', 'always', 'there', 'way', 'humans', 'especially', 'Priam', 'Briseis', 'Achilles', 'refer', 'existence.The', 'movie', 'Troy', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'historical', 'Bronze', 'Age', 'kernel', 'legends', 'wonderful', 'powerful', 'job', 'doing', 'so', 'specifically', 'INSPIRED', 'Iliad', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'closer', 'plot', 'line', 'Iliad', 'see', 'instead', '1962', 'sword', 'sandals', 'movie', 'Fury', 'Achilles', 'think', 'Peterson', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'do', 'not', 'tire', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'director', 'cut', 'yet', '.The', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'exploring', 'essence', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'Greek', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'warrior', 'code', 'portrayed', 'Iliad', 'see', 'Achilles', 'quest', 'glory', 'Odysseus', 'narration', 'attempt', 'find', 'military', 'glory', 'song', 'meaning', 'mortality', 'opposed', 'immortality', 'gods', 'see', 'how', 'society', 'too', 'small', 'great', 'warrior', 'fit', 'see', 'Hector', 'character', 'reluctant', 'distinction', 'made', 'two', 'warrior', 'codes', 'aggressive', 'quest', 'glory', 'defensive', 'warrior', 'who', 'civilized', 'city', 'movie', 'Priam', 'Iliad', 'religious', 'fatalism', 'avoid', 'having', 'make', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'Paris', 'correctly', 'portrayed', 'coward', 'seducer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'portrayal', 'Paris.On', 'whole', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'am', 'not', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'fan', 'possible', 'exception', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'who', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'star', 'power', 'beauty', 'grace', 'BE', 'Achilles', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'was', 'perfect', 'Hector', 'valiant', 'overmatched', 'emblematic', 'Trojans', 'whole', 'expressive', 'soft', 'anguished', 'eyes', 'Andromache', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'had', 'true', 'chemistry', 'intensified', 'sad', 'fate', 'loving', 'couple.If', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'criticsm', 'fates', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'set', 'canon', 'Western', 'literature', 'were', 'too', 'radically', 'different', 'speak', 'Agammemnon', 'Menelaus', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'conventional', 'bad', 'guys', 'Menelaus', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'got', 'bad', 'ends', 'Troy', 'Agammemnon', 'should', 'have', 'returned', 'Mycenae', 'whole', 'lot', 'Greek', 'literature', 'based', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'sense', 'absolute', 'loss', 'waste', 'destruction', 'Troy', 'catharsis', 'Agammemnon', 'death.I', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'James', 'Horner', 'musical', 'score', 'particularly', 'packed', 'visceral', 'punch', 'invasion', 'Trojan', 'beach']",N/A

Achilles, Hector, their fight scene in this film is an absolute masterpiece especially when you realize they actually took lessons and performed their fighting scenes themselves.  I think you will find that all fhe fight scenes in this film are absolutely spectacular.  Pitt's portrayal of Achilles is extremely well done.  I thought it was very interesting the way they came up with a fighting style to be used by Achilles and how great the fight scenes look.  Bana as Hector is perfect for this part and perfect in this part.  It's wonderful to have all the bonus material available so you can learn details with regard to the background of these films.Bloom's character, Paris, is an absolute wimp in this film and he looks like he is about 15 yrs old to Helen's (Kruger's)30+ yrs.  I really have trouble with these two characters because they gave so little consideration to the consequence of their actions.  It's no surprise that Paris learned to use a bow and arrow so he could be at a nice, safe distance while killing the soldiers who were fighting in hand to hand combat.  I think this may be the reason you see such rage in Achilles' face in the last scene with Paris. Evidently, there was a code about fights and who could do what to whom and when they could do it.  Paris did not follow the rules.  I have to admit that Bloom playing this part was very good because he really made me angry at his absurd behavior and his lack of character.  Give me Achilles and/or Hector any dayThere is so much covered in this film. You really need to see it.  The biggest discrepancy is that this war seems to cover about a 3 week period when in fact it lasted 10 years.

Brad Pitt as Achilles was very good, which totally shocked me. I thought he would be miscast, but it worked. O'Toole was great. The other actors were hit and miss, but on the whole it worked. The fight scenes were very good. I read Ebert's review. I disagreed. I think 100,000 men would stop and watch Hector and Achilles fight.I've read the Illiad about ten years ago. The movie misses the irony of the gods and fates in the affairs of men angle, but the movie replaces that idea with the study of kingship, leadership and honor. Why do men follow a king into battle? Is there any good reason for war? Is love a good enough reason?The movie is overly long, overblown and too full of itself, but it works for me. The CGI creates armies of millions instead of armies of tens of thousands, but it is minor point. The sight from the upper rooms of the city of the 1000 ships arriving on shore is pretty cool.

Brad Pitt looks better in the part of his character than Colin Farrel does in Alexandre. He's no Russel Crowe in Gladiator but still I think he does fine in the part. It's just hard to root for his character though because he's clearly fighting for the wrong team. He just wants to go down in history as a great warrior pretty much so can really careless who he's fighting.  He has no real desire to fight in a war that's mostly over a women but he is in it just for the victory and fame and...his ego. He changes a little but still he still chooses to fight on the wrong side and to kill nice innocent people.The trailers make Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) look bad and  Brad Pitt's character look like this great hero but really it's the other way around. Eric Bana plays this passionate guy who's just really fighting to defend his family and Kingdom. Pitt is just fighting for him and the glory eventhough he does have a heart in there somewhere. He never gets you to care for him as much as you do for Russel Crowe in Gladiator.  Bana even makes your care for him more and is a lot more likeable than Pitt is.The supporting cast is fantastic too, Brian Coxx  (X-Men 2, Manhunter) plays a crazed leader who wants to just conquare Troy. He doesn't care that his brother's wife left him for the prince of Troy and isn't fighting because of that. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) is fine as the Prince of Troy who's love is too strong for Helen to allow her to go back to avoid war. Peter O'Toole is also excellent as the King of Troy who just wanted peace. He shows he can still act and I think he should even be nominated for Best Supporting actor. Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings) is also good in a small role as Pitt's friend who gets him to go into battle with him. Movies like this always show that he deserves better than to be always casted as a villain from  Ireland in bad movies. The movie is  very involving with great sword-play and intense battles.

Most times, I'll see a movie and think either that I'd watch it again or I wouldn't, but I still enjoy it more or less either way. This movie, though, is an exception. To put it as bluntly as I can, it is simply the most God-awful piece of trash I have ever seen in my entire life. It's definately one of the three or four movies I've ever seen that I would consider actively bad.First of all, it's boring. The movie drags on for hours and nothing particularly interesting happens. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly interesting or sympathetic. They all just seemed flat and emotionless to me. About the scene where Achilles killed Hector, I was so bored I wanted to leave the theater, and would have if I hadn't been with other people. How they can turn one of the classics of western literature into a bloated sleeper is beyond me. That has to take real talent.Secondly, the action is bad. Okay, so the whole Achilles taking the guy out with one hit was really cool the first time they showed it, but after a while it just got really annoying. Kind of like the ""bullet-time"" thing in the Matrix; really cool the first few times you see it, but it loses something with over-use. The battle sequences themselves are confusing, largely because it's very difficult to tell the Trojans from the Greeks. The battles also feel kind like a poor cross between Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, and it seems like this movie is just trying to ride their success and popularity. The only thing is, the director here obviously doesn't have the eye for this kind of thing the directors of those films did.The story. This movie is supposed to be based on the Iliad. It even says it is in the credits, but the story has absolutely no resembelence to the original in any way. It takes place at the same location, with most of the same characters, and there's still the Trojan horse (with everything else they changed, I'm surprised they left this in). But everything else is different. The Greek gods not only figure into the original story, but are essential to it. There basically is no story without them, giving you this confused movie. The ten year siege is reduced to the period of about ten days or a week, making much of it not make sense (I guess the screen writers don't understand the concept of a SIEGE, which isn't a battle, but an attempt to starve out an enemy stronghold and force them to surrender.). Also, what's the deal with Patroclus being Achilles' cousin? They're not cousins in the original. Just kinda bugs me. The changes in general wouldn't bother me too much, except that the movie almost seems to be mocking the original at times, such as when the characters are made to look foolish for having faith in the gods, etc. Also, I have to say that I did not need to see that much of Brad Pitt.There are a couple good points about the movie. Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean are very good as Priam and Oddyseus, respectively (although I prefer Armande Asante as Oddyseus in NBC's production of The Oddysey a few years ago), and there are a few times when the movie ties into the mythology. When Paris kills Achilles and shoots him in the heel, that was a nice touch, since in the poem, that was his one vulnerable spot. I also liked the end when Paris gave his sword to Aeneus(sp?) and tells him to lead the survivors away. This is a reference to Virgil's The Aeneid, essentially the Roman version of the story in which Virgil claims the Romans are decended from Aeneus and the Trojan refugees. However, these references to the mythology only make the parts where it is left out or seemingly disparaged all the more baffling and annoying. It's like the people making the film couldn't decide how far they wanted to deviate from the original.If you're interested in the kind of movie, I'd suggest getting Gladiator, or even the old NBC version of the Oddysey, both of which are far superior and much more entertaining than this mess.",1,"All I can say is, why?",1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,3985,"['do', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'movies', 'often', 'Most', 'times', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'think', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'more', 'less', 'way', 'movie', 'exception', 'put', 'as', 'bluntly', 'can', 'simply', 'most', 'God-awful', 'piece', 'trash', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'life', 'definately', 'one', 'three', 'four', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'consider', 'actively', 'bad.First', 'boring', 'movie', 'hours', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'happens', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'be', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'just', 'seemed', 'flat', 'emotionless', 'scene', 'where', 'Achilles', 'killed', 'Hector', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'wanted', 'leave', 'theater', 'would', 'have', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'other', 'people', 'How', 'can', 'turn', 'one', 'classics', 'western', 'literature', 'bloated', 'sleeper', 'take', 'real', 'talent.Secondly', 'action', 'bad', 'Okay', 'whole', 'Achilles', 'taking', 'guy', 'one', 'hit', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'first', 'time', 'showed', 'while', 'just', 'got', 'really', 'annoying', 'Kind', 'bullet-time', 'thing', 'Matrix', 'really', 'cool', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'see', 'something', 'over-use', 'battle', 'are', 'confusing', 'largely', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'Trojans', 'Greeks', 'battles', 'also', 'feel', 'kind', 'poor', 'cross', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Gladiator', 'movie', 'just', 'trying', 'ride', 'success', 'popularity', 'only', 'thing', 'director', 'here', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'eye', 'kind', 'thing', 'directors', 'films', 'did.The', 'story', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Iliad', 'even', 'credits', 'story', 'absolutely', 'resembelence', 'original', 'way', 'place', 'same', 'location', 'most', 'same', 'characters', 'still', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'everything', 'else', 'changed', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'left', 'everything', 'else', 'different', 'Greek', 'gods', 'not', 'only', 'figure', 'original', 'story', 'are', 'essential', 'basically', 'story', 'giving', 'confused', 'movie', 'ten', 'year', 'siege', 'reduced', 'period', 'about', 'ten', 'days', 'week', 'making', 'much', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'guess', 'screen', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'concept', 'SIEGE', ""n't"", 'battle', 'attempt', 'starve', 'out', 'enemy', 'stronghold', 'force', 'surrender.', 'Also', 'what', 'deal', 'Patroclus', 'being', 'Achilles', 'cousin', ""'re"", 'not', 'cousins', 'original', 'Just', 'kinda', 'bugs', 'changes', 'general', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'almost', 'be', 'mocking', 'original', 'times', 'such', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'foolish', 'having', 'faith', 'gods', 'etc', 'Also', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'see', 'much', 'Brad', 'Pitt.There', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'points', 'movie', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Sean', 'Bean', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Priam', 'Oddyseus', 'respectively', 'prefer', 'Armande', 'Asante', 'Oddyseus', 'NBC', 'production', 'Oddysey', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'mythology', 'When', 'Paris', 'Achilles', 'shoots', 'heel', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'poem', 'was', 'one', 'vulnerable', 'spot', 'also', 'liked', 'end', 'when', 'Paris', 'gave', 'sword', 'Aeneus', 'sp', 'lead', 'survivors', 'away', 'reference', 'Virgil', 'Aeneid', 'essentially', 'Roman', 'version', 'story', 'Virgil', 'Romans', 'are', 'decended', 'Aeneus', 'Trojan', 'refugees', 'However', 'references', 'mythology', 'only', 'make', 'parts', 'where', 'left', 'out', 'seemingly', 'disparaged', 'more', 'baffling', 'annoying', 'people', 'making', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'how', 'far', 'wanted', 'deviate', 'original.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'kind', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'getting', 'Gladiator', 'even', 'old', 'NBC', 'version', 'Oddysey', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'mess']",N/A

I don't begrudge the actors, I don't think they were given much to work with.Once they arrive at Troy, the movie really pics up steam.

Ultimately, that is what the movie is about, being remembered beyond your years. I think the Greeks would have called it arete, I'm not sure though. Purists will be unhappy that this doesn't follow as close to the Illiad as it could, but Hollywood did get the gist of it, and that is something you normally can't say.I'm just not enthused about this one.

852184,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B0002Z0EXQ,J. O. Booker,"[0, 2]","Yes, Paul Verhoeven should have directed Troy. He could have filmed the graphic violence depicted in The Iliad to greater effect. But I'm sick and tired of all these damn purists hollering ""historical"" epic. The Iliad was a greek myth, not an actual historical event, but a long poem composed by a writer named Homer. However, I do maintain that if you are going to base the movie on the book, the writer, producer, and director of the film should have kept to the original story. Why call it ""Troy"" and then fabricate something else if just to sucker in those who've read the Iliad. It's the same thing with comic book adaptations like the X Men. Why adapt material of such a large devoted following and change the character histories, costumes, etc., and call it the X Men?Troy, of itself, is a good Hollywood film. Pawned as Homer's Iliad, the movie's not just a fraud, it's a disgrace and an insult. As if the producers of the film felt that they could improve on a story that's been around, studied, and loved for over 2,500 years. I think Verhoeven, Peter Jackson, or Spielberg--especially with the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (wow)--could have done not only a better job, but they--I believe--would have stayed truer to Homer's original story. As far as violence goes, no novel revels in it like the Iliad. A film version of the book, if depicted as Homer depicted in the Iliad, would be a strong NC-17 or a weak X rating. If you want to see--or visualize--action and violence on a whole other level, read the Iliad and skip Troy.

Foster ""knightemerald""","[10, 12]","This is just my opinion of the movie that I saw in theatres over the summer, I have not seen the DVD and don't know what special features it will include.That being said, those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Homer will be sorely disappointed.  This is a modern movie loosely based on Homers work.  If you take it as that and go into the movie with an open mind, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I saw it with my wife (who I think wanted to see it just for Brad Pitt) and I must admit, it was better than I thought it was going to be, especially after I witnessed movie critics coast to coast bashing the film.  It is an epic period piece, along the lines of Gladiator and Braveheart, and I truly believe this film ranks up there with those two.  So if you enjoyed those two movies, I think you will enjoy this one.  The acting was terrific by all, Brad Pitt was ferocious and unforgiving, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom did exceptionally well (Although I wasn't too fond of the characterization of Blooms character, he pulled it off masterfully) and the one of a kind Richard Harris overshadows them all.  The casting was excellent, although you will hear many people think that the actress portraying Helen was not beautiful enough, but to be honest that is one hard character to cast.  I think it must be difficult to cast a woman whose beauty started a war.  The sets were spectacular and the pace of the film was fast, I was never bored or looked at my watch the entire time.  This film is violent, so not for the kiddies, but not flamboyantly so.  It really explores such topics as honor and family loyalty, and honestly I think this movie was great, and can't understand why it didn't do better.  Once again I will reiterate that if you are looking for a faithful adaptation of Homer, you might as well look somewhere else.  Just take it for what it is, a epic Hollywood summer blockbuster.  I will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection January 4th.  Please watch this movie, and make up your own mind, I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,"Not based on fact, but a great movie.",1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,2077,"['just', 'opinion', 'movie', 'saw', 'theatres', 'summer', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'special', 'will', 'include.That', 'being', 'said', 'looking', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Homer', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'modern', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Homers', 'work', 'take', 'go', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'saw', 'wife', 'who', 'think', 'wanted', 'see', 'just', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'especially', 'witnessed', 'movie', 'critics', 'coast', 'coast', 'bashing', 'film', 'epic', 'period', 'piece', 'lines', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'truly', 'believe', 'film', 'up', 'there', 'two', 'So', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'movies', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'ferocious', 'unforgiving', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'did', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'fond', 'characterization', 'Blooms', 'character', 'pulled', 'off', 'masterfully', 'one', 'kind', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'will', 'hear', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Helen', 'was', 'not', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'hard', 'character', 'cast', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'difficult', 'cast', 'woman', 'beauty', 'started', 'war', 'sets', 'were', 'spectacular', 'pace', 'film', 'was', 'fast', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'looked', 'watch', 'entire', 'time', 'film', 'violent', 'so', 'not', 'kiddies', 'not', 'flamboyantly', 'so', 'really', 'such', 'topics', 'honor', 'family', 'loyalty', 'honestly', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'Once', 'again', 'will', 'reiterate', 'are', 'looking', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Homer', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Just', 'take', 'what', 'epic', 'Hollywood', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'January', '4th', 'Please', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

If you've read the Iliad this movie will irritate you. Overall, Troy is an ok action movie. Average acting covered up by eye-catching sets and costumes. Peter O'Toole is great as Priam and Brad Pitt makes a fine Achilles. However the rest of the cast wasn't too impressive. Maybe I can't blame then though because the screenplay was lacking. Especially notable with the romantic scenes between Paris and Helen. Yuck! And yea, Diane is cute but the ""most beautiful woman in the world?"" I think not. Anyway, the main reason to see this film is the battle scenes, particularly the showoff between Achilles and Hector. In my opinion, the climax of the movie and one of the best sword fights I've seen on film. Of this genre, I'd have to say Gladiator is the more perfect movie, not only because the plot flowed easier, but the atmosphere was enhanced with Zimmer's original score.

852188,A33IATTAB2Q7KD,B0002Z0EXQ,John Bliss,"[31, 35]","The closing credits say that ""Troy"" is ""inspired by Homer's The Iliad."" ""Inspired by"" is an interesting choice of words. ""Troy"" is inspired by the ""Iliad"" in the same way that ""Van Helsing"" is inspired by ""Dracula."" Some of the names are the same. Some of the characters are similar. An incident or two bears a passing resemblance to the source material.The filmmakers tell their story without the interaction of the gods. I have no problem with that. Anyone who's seen ""Clash of the Titans"" knows how difficult it is to portray the gods on screen. Half the time they're lounging around in bedsheets and lacy underthings, spouting poetic doggerel in some set that is equal parts little girl's bedroom and Plato's Retreat. And by omitting the gods, Benioff and director Wolfgang Petersen are in a position to find human justification for the events of the story. This would be fine is the humans were the slightest bit interesting. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The minor characters in the Iliad are more fully rounded than the main characters in ""Troy.""Much has been written about Brad Pitt's newly buffed chassis on view in the flick. Indeed, Brad is buffed and blond and fully bronzed. He could be a professional wrestler. What he lacks is any authority. Oh, he kicks tail. In an early scene he leaps over a giant warrior and slides his sword into his shoulder as if he's the butter cow at the state fair. In another scene he single handedly wipes out half the Trojan army before the other Greek ships have even landed. But this scene plays like the Burly Brawl in ""Matrix Reloaded,"" when Keanu fights the jillion Agents Smith. There's no weight to it. Pitt is enjoyable in things like ""Ocean's 11"" specifically because he is such a lightweight. In this, he's like Dean Martin as Achilles.Other actors don't fare much better. Eric Bana screws up his face and tries to find his inner warrior, but to no avail. War to him seems neither a chance for glory nor a requirement of honor, but merely an unpleasant task. Orlando Bloom has a pretty voice and pleasant appearance and is otherwise unremarkable. Diane Kruger (Who? Exactly.) has the task of playing Helen and she acquits herself not at all. She has the classic beauty of a Barbie doll, with the same emotional depth. Among the younger cast, only Sean Bean, as Odysseus, brings any weight to his role. He is served by having very few lines, which allows him to suggest an insight denied Pitt and Bana.Peter O'Toole plays Priam, and suggests a majesty which is lacking in the lines. O'Toole was born for this sort of nonsense (Remember ""My Favorite Year""?) and he can carry it off in his sleep. Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson chomp some serious scenery as Agamemnon and Menelaus, respectively. Cox in particular brings a vigor to his role that is sorely missing from the rest of the proceedings. His Agamemnon loves battle: he's like Robert Duvall in ""Apocalypse Now"" some 3000 years earlier. You may remember Cox as the villain of ""X-Men 2."" His work here makes that performance seem nuanced.The big problem with the movie is its desire to fit the story into a stereotypical plot. Cox plays the villain. He is nothing but a strutting popinjay who lets others do the fighting for him. In the Iliad, he is arrogant, but he is also a valiant warrior. Achilles, on the other hand, refuses to return to battle even after Agamemnon has apologized, because he's stubborn. Homer understands, as the makers of ""Troy"" do not, that a jerk can still be a hero and a hero can still be a jerk. Introducing a totally unnecessary love interest does nothing but slow down the plot, and reduce Achilles from a warrior to a patsy, with his final line, ""You gave me peace in a lifetime of war."" This isn't the Iliad, it's ""Troy Story.""

Davidson,"[6, 6]","As a version Homer's Iliad this is a travesty, as other reviewers (both on Amazon and elsewhere) have noted the filmmakers have played fast and loose with the source material. This is not a terminal problem: all films adapt the source material in some way and in the past, good, even great, films have diverged significantly from the source material (although maybe not quite to this extent).In all fairness the Iliad does require considerable work to meet the demands of cinema. Anyone familiar with the poem will be aware that even the book shows it oral roots - a huge cast of characters (that the reader is assumed to be already familiar with), lots of repetition of key phrases. The problem is the way it has been adapted. The film feels like it has been written by committee and then filtered through endless focus groups - the resulting script is timid and reliant on clich&eacute;. They seem scared to make any tough decisions. They cannot make any sense of Achilles motivation so they reduce it to a dull love story (with captured Trojan, Briseis) and only sketch his relationship with Patroclus. They cannot bear to not have Brad Pitt on screen so the death of Achilles is held over to the finale. They water down the ending so that Andromache, Helen and Hector's son amongst others escape. The extended timeline of the story is shortened to a few days and many of the most interesting characters including the gods are not included.The film is (partially) rescued by some very good battle scenes and some very good performances. The (largely British) supporting cast makes excellent use of the sketchy material: Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Sean Bean as Odysseus, Saffron Burrows as Andomache are all wonderful although they are all rather under utilised. However, the star of the film is Eric Bana as Hector - he is the one fully realised character amongst a host of underwritten clich&eacute;s - a warrior, a father, a statesman - he is a revelation and holds the film together. I have no problem with the portrayal of Achilles as a 'pretty boy' and Brad Pitt is actually rather good although he suffers most from the woeful script as his motivation is confused at best. More disappointing is Diane Kruger as Helen, she is rather bland and insipid (it is probably not a good idea to have the allegedly most beautiful woman in the world standing next to the lovely Saffron Burrows).If you love the Iliad and are looking for a faithful adaptation, then this will disappoint. If you are looking for a fun action movie packed with plenty of male and female eye-candy then maybe, just maybe, you will be satisfied with this.",3,Uninspired by the Iliad,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,2651,"['version', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'travesty', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'noted', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'played', 'fast', 'loose', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'terminal', 'problem', 'films', 'adapt', 'source', 'material', 'way', 'past', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'films', 'have', 'diverged', 'significantly', 'source', 'material', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'extent', 'fairness', 'Iliad', 'require', 'considerable', 'work', 'meet', 'demands', 'cinema', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'poem', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'even', 'book', 'oral', 'roots', 'huge', 'cast', 'characters', 'reader', 'assumed', 'be', 'already', 'familiar', 'lots', 'repetition', 'key', 'phrases', 'problem', 'way', 'been', 'adapted', 'film', 'feels', 'been', 'written', 'committee', 'then', 'filtered', 'endless', 'focus', 'groups', 'resulting', 'script', 'timid', 'reliant', 'clich', 'eacute', 'seem', 'scared', 'make', 'tough', 'decisions', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Achilles', 'motivation', 'reduce', 'dull', 'love', 'story', 'captured', 'Trojan', 'Briseis', 'only', 'sketch', 'relationship', 'Patroclus', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'not', 'have', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'screen', 'death', 'Achilles', 'held', 'finale', 'water', 'down', 'ending', 'so', 'Andromache', 'Helen', 'Hector', 'son', 'amongst', 'others', 'escape', 'extended', 'timeline', 'story', 'shortened', 'few', 'days', 'many', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'gods', 'are', 'not', 'included.The', 'film', 'partially', 'rescued', 'very', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'largely', 'British', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'use', 'sketchy', 'material', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Agamemnon', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'Andomache', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'rather', 'utilised', 'However', 'star', 'film', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'one', 'fully', 'realised', 'character', 'host', 'underwritten', 'clich', 'eacute', 'warrior', 'father', 'statesman', 'revelation', 'film', 'together', 'have', 'problem', 'portrayal', 'Achilles', ""'pretty"", 'boy', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'most', 'woeful', 'script', 'motivation', 'confused', 'best', 'More', 'disappointing', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'rather', 'bland', 'insipid', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'allegedly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'standing', 'next', 'lovely', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', '.If', 'love', 'Iliad', 'are', 'looking', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'then', 'will', 'disappoint', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', 'packed', 'plenty', 'male', 'female', 'eye-candy', 'then', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied']",N/A

Without the spectre of Peter Jackson looming behind it, Troy would have been a lot more impressive.  Still, for its bright sandy sweep it is an enjoyable romp if one overlooks the departures from Homer's Iliad, particularly the time compression from 10 years to a week or so, and just enjoy the ride.  For those of us who have actually read the epic, there are well detailed `Hollywoodisms' that tend to detract more than Jackson's artistic license w/ Tolkien.  I was however pleased with the tragic hero treatment of Hektor, and thought Bana did a fine job.  The CG army clashes were frankly, paltry, compared to the ferocity of Helms Deep and Minis Tirith battles, but it was nice to have a lighter palette of the desert.  The cast did a good job, even if Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a somewhat unconvincing warrior leading his armies, he chewed scenes in the more personal dialogues.

What is Hector doing killing him? After just taking art-appreciation and reading up on Troy I have to say this disturbed me a little, the war that took several years also appears like it's over in about 4 months, even though I understand that turning the entire story into a movie would take forever I would have liked SOME signs that the battle had been going on for a long time and not just a few months. Also even though I understand not wanting to represent the Gods as men in white beards sitting on a bunch of clouds I would have liked to see something that would indicate divine intervention, my God the entire war was influenced by the Gods, the director could have at least shown SOMETHING, anything.Alright now that you know all this, I still really enjoyed this movie, the best thing in the whole movie (aside from the battle-scenes of course) is Eric Bana as Hector, I believe Bana portrays a very likeable and believable character that you will feel close to quite quickly, to me he is an oscar nomination waiting to happen, and as much as people were talking about Pitt's physique I believe Bana looks equally impressive.Now a lot of people were complaining about the fact that Brad Pitt was naked too much in this movie, I really didn't even notice, yes there a few butt-shots here and there but I don't think it's gratutious at any point, Pitt worked hard for his body and if he wants to show it off a few times let him go ahead and do that, Lord knows he looks a lot better in a skirt then I ever would.Also the comment was often made that people misscast, I really don't believe that this is the case and everyone turned in a good performance, it's a very enjoyable movie, very summer movie-action epic, worth paying your 9 dollars to go see it on the big screen with surround soundIf they ever tell my story, let them say that I walked with giants.Men rise and fall like winter wheat, but these names will never die.Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses; let them say that I lived in the time of Achilles.",4,"Very good movie, though a bit dissapointing in the story",1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,2191,"['Alright', 'first', 'personally', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'story', 'been', 'Hollywooded', 'example', 'where', 'Ajax', 'suicide', 'What', 'Hector', 'doing', 'killing', 'just', 'taking', 'art-appreciation', 'reading', 'up', 'Troy', 'have', 'say', 'disturbed', 'little', 'war', 'took', 'several', 'years', 'also', 'over', 'about', '4', 'months', 'even', 'understand', 'turning', 'entire', 'story', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'forever', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'SOME', 'signs', 'battle', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'Also', 'even', 'understand', 'not', 'wanting', 'represent', 'Gods', 'men', 'white', 'beards', 'sitting', 'bunch', 'clouds', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'something', 'would', 'indicate', 'divine', 'intervention', 'God', 'entire', 'war', 'was', 'influenced', 'Gods', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'shown', 'SOMETHING', 'anything.Alright', 'now', 'know', 'still', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'best', 'thing', 'whole', 'movie', 'aside', 'battle-scenes', 'course', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'believe', 'Bana', 'very', 'likeable', 'believable', 'character', 'will', 'feel', 'close', 'quite', 'quickly', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'waiting', 'happen', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'were', 'talking', 'Pitt', 'physique', 'believe', 'Bana', 'equally', 'impressive.Now', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'complaining', 'fact', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'naked', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'yes', 'few', 'butt-shots', 'here', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'gratutious', 'point', 'Pitt', 'worked', 'hard', 'body', 'show', 'off', 'few', 'times', 'let', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', 'Lord', 'lot', 'better', 'skirt', 'then', 'ever', 'would.Also', 'comment', 'was', 'often', 'made', 'people', 'misscast', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'case', 'everyone', 'turned', 'good', 'performance', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'very', 'summer', 'movie-action', 'epic', 'worth', 'paying', '9', 'dollars', 'go', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'surround', 'soundIf', 'ever', 'tell', 'story', 'let', 'say', 'walked', 'giants.Men', 'rise', 'fall', 'winter', 'wheat', 'names', 'will', 'never', 'die.Let', 'say', 'lived', 'time', 'Hector', 'tamer', 'horses', 'let', 'say', 'lived', 'time', 'Achilles']",N/A

This reworked version is more complex and rewarding, although it still feels a bit shallow, unlike ""Alexander"", which is a much more honest film.The straightened-up relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (they were lovers, not cousins, in Homer's original), rings false and robs the film of a true emotional center. Brad Pitt certainly looks the part of the hero, and we see pretty much all of him in this version of the film. Yet by not staying true to the source material, Achilles' feelings toward Patroclus can't be truly expressed, so in other ways we really don't see Achilles at all.Eric Bana nearly steals the show out from under Pitt, while Orlando Bloom is relegated to a sort of pretty boy support player.

852202,A22Z22U91OK40X,B0002Z0EXQ,"Joshua Chrisopher Stephen Rauch ""JC""","[4, 5]",":-)I must say that the fight scenes in this movie are great, and as a guy's movie it is great - plus for the ladies there is a lot of beefcake for them.But if you were going to see the movie expecting to see Homer's The Iliad you have chosen the wrong movie.  There are many things missing from this movie that are important to the ancient myths.  Noticeably missing is the fact that Achilles (Brad Pitt) is supposed to be invulnerable except for one of the heels of his foot.  But in this movie Achilles is killed with an arrow through the heart, which according to the myth is quite impossible.  Had Achilles been in the battle they way Brad Pitt is in the movie and not been invulnerable, he would have been killed - nobody skilled enough to survive those battles unless he has supernatural help.And the character of Paris (Orlando Bloom) is made out to be a coward, which is not the case in The Iliad.  No woman, especially a queen,  in that time period is going to fall in love with a coward and run away with him without supernatural help.  That brings me to the fact that the Olympians (Greek Gods) are noticeably missing as well.  The Greek Gods are an important element to the story and they are missing - bad idea in my opinion.In the beginning we see Achilles with his mother, but there is no mention that, as in the myths, Achilles' mother is the sea-goddess Thetis who had when Achilles was an infant, dipped Achilles into the river Styx while holding onto the heel of his foot.  After being coated from the river Styx Achilles was made invulnerable and now blade, no arrow, not even the thunderbolts of Zeus could harm him unless the hit the heel of his foot, hence the short phrase of the Achilles Heel referring to a weak point.This story should have started with the wedding of Thetis to her mortal husband, which when you look at the roots of the Trojan War was what started all the elements into action that ended with the fall of Troy.  At the wedding the goddess Eris was not invited to the wedding so the spiteful goddess grabbed one the golden apples guarded by Atlas and his daughters and wrote on it ""To the fairest!"" and then rolled it down the aisle.  Three goddesses claimed to be the fairest, Hera, Athena & Aphrodite and the argued for decades till they decided to let a mortal decide who of the three of them was the fairest.But shortly after the wedding of Thetis and her mortal husband, King Pelius their son Achilles was born and then dipped into the river Stix to make him invulnerable.  Thetis eventually went back to the sea and left Achilles in the hands of Chiron, the centaur who trained many of the Greek mythical heroes.Decades after the wedding the three goddesses approached Prince Paris of Troy and each offered gifts if Paris would decide in their favor.  Aphrodite, the goddess of love & beauty offered Paris the love of Helen of Sparta and for her to be his wife so Paris chose Aphrodite to receive the golden apple.  This put both Hera & Athena supporting the Greeks is the upcoming war.  King Tyndare&uuml;s, the foster father of Helen of Sparta, was afraid of war if he were to choose her husband so he had all the suitors swear an oath to support the final decision and to defend her husband's sole right to Helen.

852203,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0002Z0EXQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 8]","While, ""Troy"" lacks ""Gladiators"" emotional core, ""Troy"" is actually a surprisingly well done action epic. Roger Ebert recently put this film #1 on his Top 10 Worst List. It was tiedwith Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". I don't agree with this. I saw""Alexander"" earlier this year and it was a horrible movie. It was like sitting down and reading a Social Studies textbook for 3 hours. NOT FUN! ""Troy"" is a well done film, especially comparedto Alexander, and it is in no way a masterpiece of cinema but it certainly is not the worst film of the year. Wolfgang Peterson(who directed the visually stunning and storyline illiterate ""Pefect Storm"") directs the film which was scripted byDavid Benioff who wrote the screenplay for Spike Lee's ""25th Hour"". Brad Pitt plays Achilles, Eric Bana plays Hector, OrlandoBloom plays Paris, Diane Kruger plays Helen, Brian Cox plays Agememnon, Brendan Gleeson plays Menelaus, and the wonderful Peter O'Toole plays King Priam. Prince Paris of Troy falls in love with Helen of Sparta who is married to Menelaus (I might add, they don't really make a good couple, Menelaus & Helen I mean) Due to his love for her he kidnaps her and takes her back to Troy with him, much to the dismay of his brother Hector and father King Priam. Well, obviously Menelaus is mad and asks his brother Agememnon to help him. Agememnon doesn't care about Helen, he cares about taking control of Troy. Agememnon recruits Achilles, to help him. Now, I need to add right quick. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan. I do like a majority of his movies though. I think this is one of his best performances. People say he was miscast, but I disagree.I think he was perfectly cast. He's got the body to play the character, and he's (as much I hate to admit) a fine actor. Diane Kruger, who has now appeared in both ""Wicker Park"" and ""National Treasure"" is good except she doesn't really have a lot of screen time. The story truly is about the personal battle betweenAchilles and Hector, as well as Agememnon and well....Everybody. I need to add as well before I finish the review that i've never read ""The Ilead"" nor do I ever want too, so i've heard a lot of people saying it doesn't hold to the book. That may or may not be ture, but it doesn't matter to me. See this movie, it's very entertaing and the special effects are great too.

Eric Bana stole the show as Hector who's a brave and wise prince as well as a fierce warrior but longs for peace and simple life with his family. Peter O'Toole as King Priam who through vanity and kindheartedness destroys his beloved kingdom. Sean Bean as Ulysses, capturing his essence of cunning and intelligence. The battle scenes and cinematography were exhilarating. The bad - they completely rewrote the story to keep Brad Pitt's Achilles onscreen as long as possible. Menelaus dies in an early battle instead of returning home with Helen. Briseis, a minor character in the book takes center stage, and one wonders whether we watched 'Helen of Troy' or 'Briseis of Troy'. In the end, she almost acts like Xena the Warrior Princess. Paris, Helen, and everyone escapes instead of being killed or enslaved. The last straw was putting Achilles in the Trojan Horse. That's so against his character who values honest combat vs. deception.

It's been hyped and over-hyped for the last 6 months and I've been getting more and more excited about it.. so to finally see it, well.. there aren't many movies that can live up to that.  Overall, it wasn't a bad movie.  It was pretty entertaining at least.  I think some of the roles were poorly cast and some of the plot was just boring.. but overall it was an above average action movie.For the cast... I think the person who definitely shines here is Eric Bana as Hector.  He is absolutely perfect in the role, utterly believeable as the soft-hearted hero of Troy.  Brad Pitt as Achilles is totally opposite!  He was utterly wrong for the role. I really like him as an actor, he's great in movies like 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Ocean's Eleven... just not right for this role.  He looks like an American male model, not like a Greek warrior.  Sorry to say it because I do like him a lot!  Orlando Bloom was ""ok"" as the pretty-boy ""I'm a lover, not a fighter"" Paris, but he really didn't do much during the movie.  The fight scene between him and Helen's husband was pretty funny, especially when he's crouching at Hector's feet. ;)The rest of the cast was alright.  The women did a lot of standing around looking alarmed, but not really much actual acting.  Helen was pretty enough, but only had about 5 lines in the entire movie.. and about halfway through we almost forgot she existed.  Pretty odd considering this whole war was fought over her!The battle sequences are probably the best reason to go see this film.  Some of them are truly awe inspiring, especially one sweeping scene where the entire Greek force attacks the Trojans in an open area.  Some other great scenes include the nighttime attack on the Greeks by the Trojans -- those rolling fireballs were very well done!  The very first battle scene with Achilles, while short, is amusing and interesting.While the movie had great battle sequences and decent acting, it just felt somewhat hollow.  The only character I really came to care about was Hector - only because Eric Bana did such an amazing job playing him.  I felt pretty much neutral about all the other characters, not caring if they lived or died.  I found it hard to sympathize with either side, and hard to believe these men would go to war over Helen.  The movie is interesting, true.. but I don't think it does Homer's story justice in the least.  Also, coming off the heels of the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy - there was really no way this movie could truly shine.

I was WRONG, his portrayal was EXCELLENT, and it prompted me to take a look at the work he's been doing since his days on the covers of the teenage magazines.  He has done some excellent work and I think it has been dismissed because he is so photogenic.Playing Achilles is wrought with all the pitfallls of playing Hamlet.  We all know the story, the scenes, and the lines.  There have been great paintings depicting scenes such as Priam begging Achilles for Hector's body.  This is every bit as tough as trying to deliver Hamlet's ""To be or not to be..."".  The actor's great challenge is to make those words his own, in order to be believable as the character.  Brad Pitt accomplishes this and it is no small feat.  I for one applaud his courage in taking on this role, and would be the first to rise for a standing ovation for the performance he delivers.The score for Troy by James Horner is magnificent, evocative, and compelling.  ""Remember Me"" should be a serious contender for the Oscar, and shouldn't be missed.  I'll tune in on Oscar night just to cheer for James Horner, and Troy.The lessons of the tale of Troy are lessons for the ages; the archetypal personalities ring as true today as they ever did, and the screenplay captures them with messages such as:""War is young men dying and old men talking.""""Men are wretched things.""""There will always be another war, I can promise you that.""""I want what all men want, I just want it more.""What is it that man wants?  Immortality.  A name that will live forever.  How many men over the centuries have been willing to trade everything for personal glory?  Mankind is ever the same.When I first read the Iliad, I wept for Hector and the mighty Achilles, and I wept again with this film.  Wept for them and all of mankind, because we seem to have so little control of our destinies, as we try to exert complete control over our world.Set aside your preconceived notions of Mr. Pitt, open yourself to the experience of this film, stop looking for disappointment, and you'll experience a wonderful, yet emotionally devastating, heartbreaking film.  Theatre requires a ""suspension of disbelief"" on the part of the audience to work its magic.Judge this film for yourself, with an open mind, and an open heart.Kaller S.

852211,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,B0002Z0EXQ,Katie,"[22, 31]","I could rant about a lot of things in Troy: when I originally saw it I wrote a four page rant in which I detailed everything they got wrong, even things as simplistic as the ancient Greek burial ritual.  And now I could list even more since I've studied early civilizations a bit and know that the Iliad would have taken place during the Greek Dark Ages and thus the battle tactics shown were incredibly anachronistic.  But I think that a review on what bothered me the most about the movie will suffice.Menelaus has always been my favorite Iliad character: perhaps my favorite mortal character in all of Greek mythology.  When I heard about Troy coming out, I was excited.  Then I saw the casting.  The minute I saw Brendan Gleeson's face peering back at me, I knew Menelaus was going to be villainized.Okay, it is a sign of bad writing when a movie needs to villainize the second guy in a love triangle in order to make the audience root for the other one.  Think Cal in Titanic.  Troy's portrayal of Menelaus makes Cal look like Prince Charming.  At least he was good-looking.  Menelaus, originally a younger, handsome warrior whom Helen CHOSE TO MARRY out of FIFTY suitors was warped into an old, brutish jerk who, just to ensure the audience felt no sympathy for him, was a philanderer as well.  And then the audience is made to think that poor Helen was the child bride of this old man.  Just so we think that Paris, played by Orlando Bloom with all of the depth and charisma of a noodle, is the love of her life.  And not the honorable man she chose to marry.Troy doesn't even stop there.  It villainizes all of the Greeks, particularly Agamemnon, who apparently isn't shown as enough of a jerk in the myths when he sacrifices his daughter.  No, no, now he has to be a megalomaniacal oaf who hurt the poor Trojans for no reason.  Ignoring the real reasons the Greeks invaded Troy.  Yeah... Oath of Tyndareus, anyone?  Curse of the House of Atreus, anyone?  Pfft.And then Troy gets even better by making HECTOR think Menelaus is a lousy jerk and his brother is wonderful!  When in the Iliad it's the total opposite.  He even refers to Menelaus as ""the honorable man who you wronged.""  Hector kills Menelaus for Paris in the movie.  Hector would NEVER fight his brother's battles for him.  He hated his brother.In the myths, Helen ends up missing her husband and even yells at Aphrodite for having enchanted her.  Not so in Troy; in Troy, she genuinely loves Paris!  Gag me.  Seriously.  Why does she love Paris, because he's young and hot?  Because he's a disgusting person, and a coward.See, it's not poor Menelaus's fault that Troy's writers suck.  And that Helen and Paris were such a terrible couple, with such bad chemistry, that the writers needed to make Helen's husband a worse alternative.  Yes, I am aware that he is not real, but is it not a crime to defile a great literary character?  I will never forgive Troy for what it did.",1,Character assassination,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,2946,"['could', 'rant', 'lot', 'things', 'Troy', 'when', 'originally', 'saw', 'wrote', 'four', 'page', 'rant', 'detailed', 'everything', 'got', 'wrong', 'even', 'things', 'as', 'simplistic', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'burial', 'ritual', 'now', 'could', 'list', 'even', 'more', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'early', 'civilizations', 'bit', 'know', 'Iliad', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'Greek', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'thus', 'battle', 'tactics', 'shown', 'were', 'incredibly', 'anachronistic', 'think', 'review', 'what', 'bothered', 'most', 'movie', 'will', 'suffice.Menelaus', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Iliad', 'character', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'mortal', 'character', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'When', 'heard', 'Troy', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'excited', 'Then', 'saw', 'casting', 'minute', 'saw', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'face', 'peering', 'back', 'knew', 'Menelaus', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'villainized.Okay', 'sign', 'bad', 'writing', 'when', 'movie', 'villainize', 'second', 'guy', 'love', 'triangle', 'order', 'make', 'audience', 'root', 'other', 'one', 'Think', 'Cal', 'Titanic', 'Troy', 'portrayal', 'Menelaus', 'Cal', 'look', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'least', 'was', 'good-looking', 'Menelaus', 'originally', 'younger', 'handsome', 'warrior', 'whom', 'Helen', 'CHOSE', 'TO', 'MARRY', 'FIFTY', 'suitors', 'was', 'warped', 'old', 'brutish', 'jerk', 'who', 'just', 'ensure', 'audience', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'was', 'philanderer', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'audience', 'made', 'think', 'poor', 'Helen', 'was', 'child', 'bride', 'old', 'man', 'Just', 'think', 'Paris', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'depth', 'charisma', 'noodle', 'love', 'life', 'not', 'honorable', 'man', 'chose', 'marry.Troy', ""n't"", 'even', 'stop', 'there', 'Greeks', 'particularly', 'Agamemnon', 'who', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'shown', 'enough', 'jerk', 'myths', 'when', 'daughter', 'No', 'now', 'be', 'megalomaniacal', 'oaf', 'who', 'hurt', 'poor', 'Trojans', 'reason', 'Ignoring', 'real', 'reasons', 'Greeks', 'invaded', 'Troy', 'Yeah', 'Oath', 'Tyndareus', 'anyone', 'Curse', 'House', 'Atreus', 'anyone', 'Pfft.And', 'then', 'Troy', 'even', 'better', 'making', 'HECTOR', 'think', 'Menelaus', 'lousy', 'jerk', 'brother', 'wonderful', 'When', 'Iliad', 'total', 'opposite', 'even', 'Menelaus', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'wronged', 'Hector', 'Menelaus', 'Paris', 'movie', 'Hector', 'would', 'NEVER', 'fight', 'brother', 'battles', 'hated', 'brother.In', 'myths', 'Helen', 'up', 'missing', 'husband', 'even', 'yells', 'Aphrodite', 'having', 'enchanted', 'Not', 'so', 'Troy', 'Troy', 'genuinely', 'Paris', 'Gag', 'Seriously', 'Why', 'love', 'Paris', 'young', 'hot', 'disgusting', 'person', 'coward.See', 'not', 'poor', 'Menelaus', 'fault', 'Troy', 'writers', 'suck', 'Helen', 'Paris', 'were', 'terrible', 'couple', 'such', 'bad', 'chemistry', 'writers', 'needed', 'make', 'Helen', 'husband', 'worse', 'alternative', 'Yes', 'am', 'aware', 'not', 'real', 'not', 'crime', 'defile', 'great', 'literary', 'character', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'Troy', 'what', 'did']",N/A
852212,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0002Z0EXQ,Kaya Savas,"[1, 3]","STORY: Now, before you go walking into this movie let me remind you that Troy was inspired by Homer's ""The Iliad"" not based on it. So if you go in with your mind set on nitpicking at it for its representation then you will ruin the experience for yourself. Troy is a film that tells the tale of the Greeks and the Trojans at first fighting for love, then power, then honor, and finally family. What Troy does so well is that the film really does play out like a poem and at times almost feels Shakespearean with all the family issues going on. What makes this version of Homer's poem more true than the rest is that it successfully handles the epic along with the incorporation of the mythology. There are plenty references to the gods and goddesses, notably Apollo, god of the sun. When I first heard that Wolfgang Petersen was going to tackle the tale of Troy I was wondering if he would be able to capture the scale of the immense battle scenes as well as Lord of The Rings had done with its battle scenes. While not the same size as Minas Tirith the battles are superbly shot and choreographed. The most thrilling scene in the film was the duel of Achilles and Hector. Overall the impact of this 2 hour and 46 minute epic is great. The movie handles itself very well and I can admit that this was a potential sleeper. But with a $200 million budget and some decent film making the experience is well worth while. What bugged me all the while through the film was the score. James Horner composed the score and he is a respectable composer, but the score's tone at times either seemed too watered down or too pushy. This is the kind of movie that Hans Zimmer would make come alive and a pity he didn't get it; probably most likely due to the fact that he's scoring King Arthur which should be interesting. Also, James Horner used the exact same trumpet tune that he used in Titanic which irritated the hell out of me. Every time I heard it, Titanic jumped right into my head and distracted me from the movie.ACTING: What plagues Troy from making it a fully enjoyable experience is the acting. The male roles were played out perfectly in my opinion, but the female roles were a joke. The problem lies in that there are no credible actresses in the film. I guess they spent all their money filling in the male roles and were left broke for the female roles. Helen is played by some German model for god's sake. Many people may complain about the dialogue but in fact the dialogue, even though cheesy, really is almost like reading from one of Homer's poems or a Shakespearean play. As a matter of fact the movie (aside from the battles) was structured very much like a play from the acting down to the position of where the characters were standing. Orlando Bloom is also a thorn in the bed. His acting I wasn't fond of at all. He seemed out of place next to macho men such as Eric Bana, Brad Pitt, Brian Cox, and Brenden Gleeson. In the end Troy shoots itself in the foot by running out of funds for its actresses.BOTTOM LINE: When Oscar time rolls around next year don't expect to see any acting nods or directing nods. However, do look out for some nods in the field of art direction, costume design, and possibly cinematography. The movie while bogged down by some bad acting that contributes to the lack of ""umph"" is in the end a very entertaining look at the story of Troy. A very appropriate summer film that won't bore. One last comment, once the movie ended this horrible sappy song came on with the credits. It had lyrics and music you'd hear from a Disney movie, it was almost bad enough to make me give the film three stars, but I tried to ignore it while walking out of the theater.",4,A Decent Representation Of Homer's Epic Poem,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,3696,"['STORY', 'Now', 'go', 'walking', 'movie', 'let', 'remind', 'Troy', 'was', 'inspired', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'not', 'based', 'So', 'go', 'mind', 'set', 'nitpicking', 'representation', 'then', 'will', 'ruin', 'experience', 'Troy', 'film', 'tale', 'Greeks', 'Trojans', 'first', 'fighting', 'love', 'then', 'power', 'then', 'honor', 'finally', 'family', 'What', 'Troy', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'really', 'play', 'out', 'poem', 'times', 'almost', 'feels', 'Shakespearean', 'family', 'issues', 'going', 'What', 'version', 'Homer', 'poem', 'more', 'true', 'rest', 'successfully', 'epic', 'incorporation', 'mythology', 'are', 'plenty', 'references', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'notably', 'Apollo', 'god', 'sun', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'was', 'going', 'tackle', 'tale', 'Troy', 'was', 'wondering', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'scale', 'immense', 'battle', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'had', 'done', 'battle', 'scenes', 'not', 'same', 'size', 'Minas', 'Tirith', 'battles', 'are', 'superbly', 'shot', 'choreographed', 'most', 'thrilling', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'duel', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'Overall', 'impact', '2', 'hour', '46', 'minute', 'epic', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'admit', 'was', 'potential', 'sleeper', '200', 'million', 'budget', 'decent', 'film', 'making', 'experience', 'well', 'worth', 'while', 'What', 'bugged', 'while', 'film', 'was', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'composed', 'score', 'respectable', 'composer', 'score', 'tone', 'times', 'either', 'seemed', 'too', 'watered', 'down', 'too', 'pushy', 'kind', 'movie', 'Zimmer', 'would', 'make', 'come', 'alive', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'probably', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'fact', 'scoring', 'King', 'Arthur', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'Also', 'James', 'Horner', 'used', 'exact', 'same', 'trumpet', 'tune', 'used', 'Titanic', 'irritated', 'hell', 'time', 'heard', 'Titanic', 'jumped', 'right', 'head', 'distracted', 'movie.ACTING', 'What', 'Troy', 'making', 'fully', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'acting', 'male', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'perfectly', 'opinion', 'female', 'roles', 'were', 'joke', 'problem', 'are', 'credible', 'actresses', 'film', 'guess', 'spent', 'money', 'filling', 'male', 'roles', 'were', 'left', 'broke', 'female', 'roles', 'Helen', 'played', 'German', 'model', 'god', 'sake', 'Many', 'people', 'may', 'complain', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'dialogue', 'even', 'cheesy', 'really', 'almost', 'like', 'reading', 'one', 'Homer', 'poems', 'Shakespearean', 'play', 'matter', 'fact', 'movie', 'aside', 'battles', 'was', 'structured', 'very', 'much', 'play', 'acting', 'down', 'position', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'standing', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'also', 'thorn', 'bed', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'seemed', 'place', 'next', 'macho', 'men', 'such', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Brenden', 'Gleeson', 'end', 'Troy', 'shoots', 'foot', 'running', 'out', 'funds', 'actresses.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'When', 'Oscar', 'time', 'rolls', 'next', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'acting', 'nods', 'directing', 'nods', 'However', 'do', 'look', 'out', 'nods', 'field', 'art', 'direction', 'costume', 'design', 'possibly', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'bogged', 'down', 'bad', 'acting', 'lack', 'umph', 'end', 'very', 'entertaining', 'look', 'story', 'Troy', 'very', 'appropriate', 'summer', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'One', 'last', 'comment', 'once', 'movie', 'ended', 'horrible', 'sappy', 'song', 'came', 'credits', 'had', 'lyrics', 'music', ""'d"", 'hear', 'Disney', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'bad', 'enough', 'make', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'tried', 'ignore', 'walking', 'theater']",N/A
852213,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0002Z0EXQ,K. Driscoll,"[8, 10]","I'm really going to forgive some massive fundamental flaws and applaud this fun epic popcorn flick.  Obviously, and it is assumed that like many cinephiles, I have a major problem with Troy's very existence to the core.  Consider for a minute that the likes ofBraveheartandAlexanderare called ""historical fiction"" but they are based on people we know existed.  Troy is based onThe Iliadbut it works in such a way that the audience is possibly being urged to believe these were real events.  So the film in essence is based on the possible events that took place during the Trojan War.  In fact, it doesn't even stay particularly true to The Iliad but it does try to capture the icons associated with the Trojan War and at the very least it keeps in tone with The Iliad, especially with regards to the violence in its battle sequences and the portrayal of Achilles' wrath.  However, no gods or mythical figures to speak of and that is, at the very least an indirect attempt to steer the audience from believing that this is fiction.  Maybe it is just because so many other epic films released are based on some degree of truth.  Troy is based on myths and that's alright if you want to portray it that way.  2004'sKing Arthurhad the same problem but with less CGI.  Troy has a lot of CGI and it cost $180 million to make.  They didn't need to stretch so far for believability but like I said, some movies are just worth forgiving.  This is eye candy; it is Hollywood to the bone.Nevertheless, I liked Troy and it looks incredible on blu-ray.  The director's cut includes extra battle cuts, extra nudity, and it even has some scenes that assist in character development.  The extra footage is actually seamless and makes the movie far longer but also far better and if there is an epic film made for superior visual technology like blu-ray, Troy is just that film.  There is no pretending here, Troy is a true Hollywood production and I actually mean that with at least some degree of affection.  The cast is great and includes of course Brad Pitt as the seemingly invincible and infinitely angry Achilles, Brian Cox as one of the film's real villains in Agamemnon, Eric Bana plays the heroic Trojan warrior Hector, Sean Bean plays Odysseus, Peter O'Toole plays Priam with fitting melodrama, Tyler Mane plays the chaotic and violent Ajax, and the very beautiful Diane Kruger plays Helen; the face that launched a thousand ships, or was it her breasts?  All are good in their roles but no one seems to take themselves too seriously and for the most part their performances, or in some cases just their presence, work within the film.The battle scenes in Troy are huge and absolutely second to none. There are tons of battle scenes within this 196 minute Director's cut and they just keep on going while getting more and more exciting and out of control.  Thesoundtrackfor Troy is clearly an upgrade from the theatrical version and makes the battle scenes seem even larger as it booms and powers in and out of great sky shots over the beginnings, middles, and ends of various battles.  The cinematography and visual effects, whether the fake kind or the real kind, look absolutely amazing on blu-ray and the great shots never cease in Troy.  The music is huge, the drama is huge, and the visuals are even bigger.  It is visually one of the most impressive blu-rays so far and that is because it is a visually driven film to begin with.  Troy truly is epic in every sense of the word.  Well, except for that whole idea of it being based on an epic poem.",4,Hollywood's Enormous Trojan War Looks Amazing on Blu-Ray,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,3548,"[""'m"", 'really', 'going', 'forgive', 'massive', 'fundamental', 'flaws', 'applaud', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Obviously', 'assumed', 'many', 'cinephiles', 'have', 'major', 'problem', 'Troy', 'very', 'existence', 'core', 'Consider', 'minute', 'likes', 'ofBraveheartandAlexanderare', 'called', 'historical', 'fiction', 'are', 'based', 'people', 'know', 'existed', 'Troy', 'based', 'onThe', 'Iliadbut', 'such', 'way', 'audience', 'possibly', 'being', 'urged', 'believe', 'were', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'essence', 'based', 'possible', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Trojan', 'War', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'stay', 'particularly', 'true', 'Iliad', 'try', 'capture', 'icons', 'associated', 'Trojan', 'War', 'very', 'least', 'tone', 'Iliad', 'especially', 'regards', 'violence', 'battle', 'sequences', 'portrayal', 'Achilles', 'wrath', 'However', 'gods', 'mythical', 'figures', 'speak', 'very', 'least', 'indirect', 'attempt', 'steer', 'audience', 'believing', 'fiction', 'Maybe', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'epic', 'films', 'released', 'are', 'based', 'degree', 'truth', 'Troy', 'based', 'myths', 'alright', 'want', 'portray', 'way', ""2004'sKing"", 'Arthurhad', 'same', 'problem', 'less', 'CGI', 'Troy', 'lot', 'CGI', 'cost', '180', 'million', 'make', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'stretch', 'so', 'far', 'believability', 'said', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'worth', 'forgiving', 'eye', 'candy', 'Hollywood', 'bone.Nevertheless', 'liked', 'Troy', 'incredible', 'blu-ray', 'director', 'cut', 'extra', 'battle', 'cuts', 'extra', 'nudity', 'even', 'scenes', 'assist', 'character', 'development', 'extra', 'footage', 'actually', 'seamless', 'movie', 'far', 'longer', 'also', 'far', 'better', 'epic', 'film', 'made', 'superior', 'visual', 'technology', 'blu-ray', 'Troy', 'just', 'film', 'pretending', 'here', 'Troy', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'actually', 'mean', 'least', 'degree', 'affection', 'cast', 'great', 'course', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'infinitely', 'angry', 'Achilles', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'one', 'film', 'real', 'villains', 'Agamemnon', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'heroic', 'Trojan', 'warrior', 'Hector', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'fitting', 'melodrama', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'chaotic', 'violent', 'Ajax', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'face', 'launched', 'thousand', 'ships', 'was', 'breasts', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'one', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'most', 'part', 'performances', 'cases', 'just', 'presence', 'work', 'film.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Troy', 'are', 'huge', 'absolutely', 'second', 'none', 'are', 'tons', 'battle', 'scenes', '196', 'minute', 'Director', 'cut', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'exciting', 'control', 'Thesoundtrackfor', 'Troy', 'clearly', 'upgrade', 'theatrical', 'version', 'battle', 'seem', 'even', 'larger', 'powers', 'great', 'sky', 'shots', 'beginnings', 'middles', 'ends', 'various', 'battles', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'effects', 'fake', 'kind', 'real', 'kind', 'look', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'blu-ray', 'great', 'shots', 'never', 'cease', 'Troy', 'music', 'huge', 'drama', 'huge', 'visuals', 'are', 'even', 'bigger', 'visually', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'blu-rays', 'so', 'far', 'visually', 'driven', 'film', 'begin', 'Troy', 'truly', 'epic', 'sense', 'word', 'Well', 'whole', 'idea', 'being', 'based', 'epic', 'poem']",N/A

852215,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,B0002Z0EXQ,Kelvin H.,"[6, 9]","If I were to critique ""Troy"" according to Homer, then ""Troy"" is a debacle. If I were to even critique ""Troy"" according to Greek myth, then ""Troy"" would be a misinterpretation. Yet, for what the movie is alone, it manages to be good because it does not pride itself in the adaptation of an epic-sized poem. Is ""Troy"" Homer's vision of the Trojan War? Certainly not. But at least it is director Wolfgang Petersen's conception, and he knows it to be his.""Troy"" is loosely based on Homer's ""The Iliad"" and it should be because it is infeasible to adapt a classic poetic story that is even too epic to be put on screen without risking being chastised if it is even remotely disproportionate with the original. It is as impossible as finding the perfect Hamlet performance. I believe Wolfgang Petersen wanted to spare himself from being humiliated by not making the movie be in accordance to ""The Iliad."" Instead, he made the right decision by using ""The Iliad"" as the ignition for the story and remodeled it into a more human story instead of Homer's treatment of mythological heroes. Plus, this gives Petersen more leeway as he even adds in the Trojan horse so that he can exhibit what it would actually look like and it is impressing.For what it is, ""Troy"" is acceptable. It is two and a half hours long and it manages to indulge you whether you are just looking to watch the battles or to gawk at the beauty of these actors. In spite of its grand visuals, ""Troy"" is not an epic because the actors playing in their roles do not grasp that larger-than-life persona. Moreover, the screenplay contains very little memorable dialogues and not fully realizing certain story points while having some scenes that are not a necessity.

Absolutely fantastic!Brad Pitt did a terrific performance as the famous Greek warrior, Achilles who leads 50,000 men to conquer the last city, Troy, that is stopping the sinister king, Agyrmemnon, fantastically played by Brian Cox, from ruling the whole of Greece BUT there is also another reason why he's trying to conquer and that is because of Helen, played by the sexy Diane Kruger, who runs away, with Paris, the prince of Troy, played by Orlando Bloom, from her husband, played by Brendan Gleeson, who is Agyrmemnon's brother.Are you with me so far? There is a lot to get through in this film I'm surprised it didn't take 2 hours 45 minutes!Thus causing the greatest and most famous battle of all time. Also starring Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean and the underrated Eric Bana who did a superb performance as the famous Trojan warrior, Hector.Be warned people who have read Homer's Illiad which the film is based on might be disappointed considering you must remember since when does a film actually stay true to the original story.Also, the film is quite long so be prepared.

I read several negative reviews and I almost decided not to watch the movie, but I'm glad I did. Troy is a reasonably entertaining sword-and-sandals type of popcorn muncher. As long as you don't expect Homer you won't be too disappointed. There's precious little poetry here and the gods are referred to but are otherwise absent.First, the cast. The always outstanding Brian Cox steals every scene he is in as Agamemnon. Cox is one of the most talented character actors working today and he has enormous screen presence. Eric Bana is fine as the tragic hero Hector and Orlando Bloom is suitably callow and cowardly as Paris. Sean Bean, another of my favorites, is good although underutilized as Odysseus. Peter O'Toole as Priam gets to deliver the single best line in the movie, during his scene with Achilles.  Rose Byrne as Briseis is by far the best actress in the film and her relationship with Achilles is by far the most interesting male-female relationship in the movie. I hope to see more of her.These fine performances highlight the most important flaw in this film, the casting of Achilles and Helen. Simply put, Brad Pitt is not a good actor. He is hopelessly miscast as Achilles. Never is he believable. His dialogue is delivered in a wooden monotone, his accent is all over the place and rather than rage, his primary emotion is pique. His battle scenes aren't too bad but they are overchoreographed and don't seem very believable. This poor casting choice is what seperates this film from better movies of this genre such as Gladiator.Almost as bad is Diane Kruger's Helen. She's attractive enough but no more so than many other actresses. She completely lacks charisma and virtually disappears from every scene she's in. Her face couldn't launch a single ship, much less a thousand. She should take lessons in screen presence from Brian Cox. It takes more than a nice figure (something Cox would be the first to admit he lacks).The large battle scenes are well done and exciting and the costumes and scenery are also well handled. I enjoyed the sight of the ships sailing for Troy and the CGI was pretty seamless. I appreciated the fact that Helen's adultery was an excuse, rather than a reason for the war. The reason was Agamemnon's imperial ambition, well presented by Cox.So, all in all not a bad film but a better job of casting would have made it much better. A missed opportunity but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, as long as you're not expecting Homer.",3,Better than I expected,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,2550,"['admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Troy', 'read', 'several', 'negative', 'reviews', 'almost', 'decided', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Troy', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'sword-and-sandals', 'type', 'popcorn', 'muncher', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Homer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'precious', 'little', 'poetry', 'here', 'gods', 'are', 'referred', 'are', 'otherwise', 'absent.First', 'cast', 'always', 'outstanding', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'steals', 'scene', 'Agamemnon', 'Cox', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'enormous', 'screen', 'presence', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'fine', 'tragic', 'hero', 'Hector', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'suitably', 'callow', 'cowardly', 'Paris', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'favorites', 'good', 'underutilized', 'Odysseus', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'deliver', 'single', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'scene', 'Achilles', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Briseis', 'far', 'best', 'actress', 'film', 'relationship', 'Achilles', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'male-female', 'relationship', 'movie', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'her.These', 'fine', 'performances', 'highlight', 'most', 'important', 'flaw', 'film', 'casting', 'Achilles', 'Helen', 'Simply', 'put', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'hopelessly', 'miscast', 'Achilles', 'Never', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'wooden', 'monotone', 'accent', 'place', 'rather', 'rage', 'primary', 'emotion', 'pique', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'are', 'overchoreographed', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'believable', 'poor', 'casting', 'choice', 'what', 'film', 'better', 'movies', 'genre', 'such', 'as', 'Gladiator.Almost', 'bad', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'attractive', 'enough', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'actresses', 'completely', 'charisma', 'virtually', 'disappears', 'scene', 'face', 'could', ""n't"", 'launch', 'single', 'ship', 'much', 'less', 'thousand', 'should', 'take', 'lessons', 'screen', 'presence', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'more', 'nice', 'figure', 'something', 'Cox', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'admit', '.The', 'large', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'exciting', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'handled', 'enjoyed', 'sight', 'ships', 'sailing', 'Troy', 'CGI', 'was', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'Helen', 'adultery', 'was', 'excuse', 'rather', 'reason', 'war', 'reason', 'was', 'Agamemnon', 'imperial', 'ambition', 'well', 'presented', 'Cox.So', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'better', 'job', 'casting', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'Homer']",N/A

852223,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002Z0EXQ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 9]","Troy is an epic story loosely adapted from Homer's Iliad, which is in its own rights an epic masterpiece.  The story is known to most people who were probably coerced to read it in either high school or college as it was required reading in order to receives a passing grade.  Most probably found the tale difficult to read as it was written in prose, which left most readers missing a story full of intrigue as humans and gods are faced with deceit, love, bereavement, faith, war, heroism, despotism, and much more.  The divine portion of the Iliad is immense as the god's choices always reflect upon the humans, but in Troy Wolfgang Petersen decides to focus on the human aspects of the tale.  This creates an interesting perspective on the story as the many characters still deceive, kill, love, commit heroic deeds, and much more.Troy begins with depicting Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) who is on the war path as he seeks to conquer all of Greece and become the king of kings.  The many battles that Agamemnon faces are decided with very little bloodshed as he suggests to each king that if their best warrior can beat his best warrior then he will retreat, but if his best warrior wins then the opposing king will have to pledge his legion to him.  Agamemnon's best warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who seeks immortal fame through the battles that he fights and he also strengthens the confidence of the men in the troops.  However, Achilles also believes in his independence as he believes that the kings should fight their own fights, which makes it difficult for Agamemnon to handle Achilles.The Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is welcoming peace with Troy as Hector (Eric Bana), the throne prince of Troy, is visiting Sparta with the duty of declaring peace.  In joy Menelaus and Hector celebrate the truce between the cities while Hector's younger brother brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) is secretively courting Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger).  On the voyage back across the Aegean Sea Paris reveals the secret to Hector as he has persuaded Helen to return to Troy with him as they have fallen in love with one another.  Hector is furious as he realizes that the truce is broken and a war might be approaching in the near future unless they return Helen to Sparta.  Nevertheless, Helen sails to Troy with Paris as Hector is not willing to give up his little brothers life on account of his love for Helen.Wrathful vengeance boils within the veins of Menelaus as he discovers that Helen has left him for one of the princes of Troy, which leads him to visit his brother Agamemnon in a request to seek his vengeance on Troy.  Agamemnon understands that Helen's abandonment of his brother has provided him with an opportunity to ensemble all the troops of Greece to attack Troy, and his advisors recommend that they also bring Achilles.  This is something that Agamemnon resents, as he hates Achilles and his independent manners.  Despite his own dislike for the man Agamemnon listens to his advisors as he send for him through Odysseus (Sean Bean), the only person that Achilles respects.  When all troops arrive they set sail for Troy as Agamemnon has gathered the largest army ever, which is 50,000 men strong.When the many ships arrive to Troy the audience is to see a siege of enormous proportions as the 50,000 men settle on the beach outside Troy.  The siege of Troy offers many interesting views of the characters as intrigue begins to build up and create different camps within the Greek camp.  Achilles' hatred for Agamemnon and vice versa depicts an interesting perspective on power and the symbiosis between characters that detest each other.  There are also several interesting comments such as Odysseus talking to Achilles: ""War is young men dying and old men talking.  You know this.  Ignore the politics.""  These comments offer much to reflect upon as the siege of Troy continues to kill husbands and fathers.Troy is depicted through radiant cinematography, which uses many vast shots where the background seems to go on forever.  The camerawork and lighting also offer several shots with silhouettes of the characters, especially of Achilles.  These silhouettes provide an interesting notion for the uncomplicated existence of Achilles as he perceives life rather black and white as he fearlessly moves through the battlefield with no thoughts of the death he is delivering to other.  The casts performances are, however, unbalanced and it affects the complete cinematic experience as it on occasion feels too 21st century, and in other scenes it is nothing but brilliant.  Altogether, Troy offers a solid cinematic experience, which provides the audience with several lessons and morals in regards to war and the aftermath of war.",4,"""War is young men dying and old men talking."" - Odysseus",1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,4764,"['Troy', 'epic', 'story', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'own', 'rights', 'epic', 'masterpiece', 'story', 'known', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'coerced', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'was', 'required', 'reading', 'order', 'receives', 'passing', 'grade', 'Most', 'probably', 'found', 'tale', 'difficult', 'read', 'was', 'written', 'prose', 'left', 'most', 'readers', 'missing', 'story', 'full', 'intrigue', 'humans', 'gods', 'are', 'faced', 'deceit', 'love', 'bereavement', 'faith', 'war', 'heroism', 'despotism', 'much', 'more', 'divine', 'portion', 'Iliad', 'immense', 'god', 'choices', 'always', 'reflect', 'humans', 'Troy', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'focus', 'human', 'aspects', 'tale', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'story', 'many', 'characters', 'still', 'deceive', 'kill', 'love', 'commit', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'much', 'more.Troy', 'depicting', 'Agamemnon', 'Mycenae', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'war', 'path', 'conquer', 'Greece', 'become', 'king', 'kings', 'many', 'battles', 'Agamemnon', 'are', 'decided', 'very', 'little', 'bloodshed', 'king', 'best', 'warrior', 'can', 'beat', 'best', 'warrior', 'then', 'will', 'retreat', 'best', 'warrior', 'wins', 'then', 'opposing', 'king', 'will', 'have', 'pledge', 'legion', 'Agamemnon', 'best', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'immortal', 'fame', 'battles', 'also', 'confidence', 'men', 'troops', 'However', 'Achilles', 'also', 'independence', 'kings', 'should', 'fight', 'own', 'fights', 'difficult', 'Agamemnon', 'handle', 'Achilles.The', 'Menelaus', 'Sparta', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'welcoming', 'peace', 'Troy', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'throne', 'prince', 'Troy', 'visiting', 'Sparta', 'duty', 'declaring', 'peace', 'joy', 'Menelaus', 'Hector', 'celebrate', 'truce', 'cities', 'Hector', 'younger', 'brother', 'brother', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'secretively', 'courting', 'Menelaus', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'voyage', 'back', 'Aegean', 'Sea', 'Paris', 'secret', 'Hector', 'persuaded', 'Helen', 'return', 'Troy', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'one', 'Hector', 'furious', 'truce', 'broken', 'war', 'might', 'be', 'approaching', 'near', 'future', 'return', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'Nevertheless', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Paris', 'Hector', 'not', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'little', 'brothers', 'life', 'account', 'love', 'Helen.Wrathful', 'vengeance', 'boils', 'veins', 'Menelaus', 'Helen', 'left', 'one', 'princes', 'Troy', 'visit', 'brother', 'Agamemnon', 'request', 'seek', 'vengeance', 'Troy', 'Agamemnon', 'Helen', 'abandonment', 'brother', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'ensemble', 'troops', 'Greece', 'attack', 'Troy', 'advisors', 'recommend', 'also', 'bring', 'Achilles', 'something', 'Agamemnon', 'resents', 'Achilles', 'independent', 'manners', 'own', 'dislike', 'man', 'Agamemnon', 'advisors', 'send', 'Odysseus', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'only', 'person', 'Achilles', 'respects', 'When', 'troops', 'arrive', 'set', 'sail', 'Troy', 'Agamemnon', 'gathered', 'largest', 'army', 'ever', '50,000', 'men', 'strong.When', 'many', 'ships', 'arrive', 'Troy', 'audience', 'see', 'siege', 'enormous', 'proportions', '50,000', 'men', 'settle', 'beach', 'Troy', 'siege', 'Troy', 'many', 'interesting', 'views', 'characters', 'intrigue', 'build', 'up', 'create', 'different', 'camps', 'Greek', 'camp', 'Achilles', 'hatred', 'Agamemnon', 'vice', 'versa', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'power', 'symbiosis', 'characters', 'detest', 'other', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'interesting', 'comments', 'such', 'Odysseus', 'talking', 'Achilles', 'War', 'young', 'men', 'dying', 'old', 'men', 'talking', 'know', 'Ignore', 'politics', 'comments', 'offer', 'much', 'reflect', 'siege', 'Troy', 'kill', 'husbands', 'fathers.Troy', 'depicted', 'radiant', 'cinematography', 'many', 'vast', 'shots', 'where', 'background', 'go', 'forever', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'also', 'offer', 'several', 'shots', 'silhouettes', 'characters', 'especially', 'Achilles', 'silhouettes', 'provide', 'interesting', 'notion', 'uncomplicated', 'existence', 'Achilles', 'life', 'rather', 'black', 'white', 'fearlessly', 'battlefield', 'thoughts', 'death', 'delivering', 'other', 'casts', 'performances', 'are', 'however', 'unbalanced', 'complete', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'occasion', 'feels', 'too', '21st', 'century', 'other', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'Altogether', 'Troy', 'solid', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'several', 'lessons', 'morals', 'regards', 'war', 'aftermath', 'war']",N/A

There is good, bad and nails-against-a chalkboard-horrible in Troy.The Good:Brad Pitt, from the neck down he looks might cute and he obviously took lessons for the fight scenes.Peter O'Toole, the last of the great rowdy boys from Great Britain, gives a rather touching performance as King Priam.Eric Bana and Sean Bean. Both do their jobs, don't embarass themselves and seem to be taking the whole thing seriously.The Bad:Diane Kruger as Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world. Judging by the reactions from the guys in the audience this actress was miscast.The Pace. In this movie the Trojan War seems to last for a few hot days instead of a decade.Brad Pitt, he looks really cute but when he opens his mouth to say his lines he sounds like a surfer boy pretending to be Hamlet.Julie Christie as Thetis. She's supposed to be a nymph but looks like a suburban granny.The ending. I won't give it away but it's not even within shouting distance of the one Homer wrote.What's horrible:The anachronisms.

Mind you-it's not the best way to spend almost three hours of your life but, it's not the worst either. Rarely is a movie done that guys and girls might both enjoy the guys will love the action fight scenes while the gals will swoon over Brad Pitt.This movie must have cost millions to make with the all-star cast, stunning costumes, the music, and thrilling fight scenes this movie did not fail to impress me and in my opinon it deserved some nodds from the oscars particulary concerning the accuracy and detail in the costumes.I can't believe how many people were critcising the fact that the movie strayed from the ""Illiad"" personally I thought this was a good thing considering I had to suffer reading that book in high-school. The movie is actually in my opinon better than the book which strains the borriness and pettiness of the Gods who decide the fate of the doomed city. It also was not just based on the Illiad but I saw refrences from the Aenid as well(The Roman version of the Illiad). And yes the Trojan war lasted twelve years I believe and in this it lasts a period of a couple of months.The cast does a very good job particularly from Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Peter O'Toole also did great as King Priam an actually honorable king. I however was not impressed by Orlando and can find the only reason why he has made it into acting is his pretty face. Sorry Girls- he's a model not an actor! But, you will not notice him when you have such performances from cuties Brad and Bana!This movie is all about, love, honor, and immortality. With great action squences and wonderful love scenes- this is a movie to rent on movie night. The only thing I have to critcize about this movie and the only reason this flick didn't recieve four stars from me would have to be the melodramatic screenplay which in my opinon ruined what would have been a great film.This is one of those movies I would rent for movie night, but not buy.",3,Take Immortality It'sYours- This movie may not be immortal,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2024,"['Troy', 'surprised', 'based', 'reviews', 'being', 'portrayed', 'online', 'newspaper', 'Mind', 'you-it', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'spend', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'life', 'not', 'worst', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'done', 'guys', 'girls', 'might', 'enjoy', 'guys', 'will', 'love', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gals', 'will', 'swoon', 'Brad', 'Pitt.This', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'millions', 'make', 'all-star', 'cast', 'stunning', 'costumes', 'music', 'thrilling', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'impress', 'opinon', 'deserved', 'nodds', 'oscars', 'particulary', 'concerning', 'accuracy', 'detail', 'costumes.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'critcising', 'fact', 'movie', 'strayed', 'Illiad', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'considering', 'had', 'suffer', 'reading', 'book', 'high-school', 'movie', 'actually', 'opinon', 'better', 'book', 'borriness', 'pettiness', 'Gods', 'who', 'decide', 'fate', 'doomed', 'city', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'based', 'Illiad', 'saw', 'refrences', 'Aenid', 'well', 'Roman', 'version', 'Illiad', 'yes', 'Trojan', 'war', 'lasted', 'twelve', 'years', 'believe', 'period', 'couple', 'months.The', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'particularly', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'also', 'did', 'great', 'King', 'Priam', 'actually', 'honorable', 'king', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'Orlando', 'can', 'find', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'made', 'acting', 'pretty', 'face', 'Sorry', 'Girls-', 'model', 'not', 'actor', 'will', 'not', 'notice', 'when', 'have', 'such', 'performances', 'cuties', 'Brad', 'Bana', 'movie', 'love', 'honor', 'immortality', 'great', 'action', 'squences', 'wonderful', 'love', 'scenes-', 'movie', 'rent', 'movie', 'night', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'critcize', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'four', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'screenplay', 'opinon', 'ruined', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film.This', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'rent', 'movie', 'night', 'not', 'buy']",N/A
852226,A2NNTNC715AJ50,B0002Z0EXQ,"Kindle Customer ""JKM""","[2, 3]","Troy is an enjoyable film.  It does not make it to the epic level, but it's a strong film that is character driven.  Of course everyone knows that Brad Pitt is Achilles and he does a great job.  Physically, Pitt looks like one would imagine Achilles looked like.  His demeanor and fighting style scream the greatest warrior who ever lived.  The only problem Pitt sometimes has is with the dialogue.  Occassionally, he seems to get lost in the grandeur of the film.  Eric Bana as Hector totally steals the show.  As the only one of the heroes who understands exactly what the consequences of war are, Bana makes Hector the most noble and decent of the actors.  He dominates every scene with a quiet dignity that totally befits a prince of Troy.  Orlando Bloom as Paris turns in a fine performance.  Though he has played many different epic heroes, Bloom is able to convincingly convey the fear that Paris fears.  He succeeds to a degree in making Paris a sympathetic figure.  Sean Bean turns in a  great performance as Odysseus, I wish he was in the film more.  The supporting actors are also fine and they are too many to name so I will go past them.  What is wrong with this film?  Sometimes the intricate plot gets lost in the action.  My biggest problem with the film is the lack of any sense of time.  The Trojan War supposedly lasted 10 years and while no one wants 10 years to show up on screen, the entire war takes tops 2 weeks.  Amy Greek would have known that only a prolonged siege would take the city, so it would have been interesting to see more attacks repelled.  The sacking of Troy is a tragic scene.  Achilles because of his status as a main character survives until the end of the film where he is killed by an arrow firing Paris, who shoots Achilles first in the heel, slowing the warrior and allowing him to pepper Achilles' body with several more arrows.  Achilles rips out all the arrows except the one in his heel, leaving alive the legend of Achilles' heel.  Paris does live to the end of the movie and I guess he escapes the sack of Troy.  This I do have a bit more of a problem with but overall, this is an adaptation of the Illiad, not the Illiad on film.  I found this film to be totally enjoyable and while it could have been better, it was not too bad.  The dvd release is pretty pathetic with only a smattering of extra features, not even justifying the 2-disc set.",4,Enjoyable realistic take of the Legend of Homer,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,2397,"['Troy', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'epic', 'level', 'strong', 'film', 'character', 'driven', 'course', 'everyone', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'great', 'job', 'Physically', 'Pitt', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'Achilles', 'looked', 'demeanor', 'fighting', 'style', 'scream', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'only', 'problem', 'Pitt', 'sometimes', 'dialogue', 'Occassionally', 'get', 'lost', 'grandeur', 'film', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'totally', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'heroes', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'consequences', 'war', 'are', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'most', 'noble', 'decent', 'actors', 'scene', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'totally', 'prince', 'Troy', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'fine', 'performance', 'played', 'many', 'different', 'epic', 'heroes', 'Bloom', 'able', 'convincingly', 'convey', 'fear', 'Paris', 'fears', 'degree', 'making', 'Paris', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'great', 'performance', 'Odysseus', 'wish', 'was', 'film', 'more', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'name', 'so', 'will', 'go', 'What', 'wrong', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'intricate', 'plot', 'lost', 'action', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'lack', 'sense', 'time', 'Trojan', 'War', 'supposedly', 'lasted', '10', 'years', 'one', '10', 'years', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'entire', 'war', 'tops', '2', 'weeks', 'Amy', 'Greek', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'only', 'prolonged', 'siege', 'would', 'take', 'city', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'more', 'attacks', 'repelled', 'sacking', 'Troy', 'tragic', 'scene', 'Achilles', 'status', 'main', 'character', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'killed', 'arrow', 'firing', 'Paris', 'who', 'shoots', 'Achilles', 'first', 'heel', 'slowing', 'warrior', 'allowing', 'pepper', 'Achilles', 'body', 'several', 'more', 'arrows', 'Achilles', 'out', 'arrows', 'one', 'heel', 'leaving', 'alive', 'legend', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'Paris', 'live', 'end', 'movie', 'guess', 'sack', 'Troy', 'do', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'problem', 'overall', 'adaptation', 'Illiad', 'not', 'Illiad', 'film', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'totally', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'dvd', 'release', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'only', 'smattering', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'even', 'justifying', '2-disc', 'set']",N/A
852227,A2LNVIYOP4RTO5,B0002Z0EXQ,Kiran KK,"[1, 1]","Directed by Wolfgang Peterson. Produced by Wolfgang Peterson/Diana Rathbun/Colin Wilson. Starring Brad Pitt (Achilles), Eric Bana (Prince Hector of Troy), Orlando Bloom (Prince Paris of Troy), Diana Kruger (Queen Helen of Sparta) and Brian Cox (Agamemnon) in lead roles.Storyline: The king of Achaea (old Greece) Agamemnon and king of Sparta (Menelaus) were brothers. Agamemnon had a long cherished wish to capture the wealthy and powerful kingdom of Troy, ruled by King Priam, who makes a peace pact with Sparta to avoid the invasion of Agamemnon. But, the younger Prince of Troy, Paris falls in love with the wife of Agamemnon, Queen Helen. He smuggles her to Troy. This angers both Menelaus and Agamemnon and gives them a reason to attack Troy with all their forces in 1000 ships. They take the help of Achilles, the greatest warrior ever born in this world, lord of the deadly warrior clan of Greece, called the Myrmidons, for this attack. Achilles, unwillingly takes up the job as he was against the principles of Agamemnon and his unjustified invasions. Achilles skillfully wins the initial war against Troy, by taking over their coveted Temple of Apollo, where he comes across the beautiful Brisies, cousin of the Prince of Troy, Hector, with whom he falls in love. Prince Hector, the elder son of King Priam, an equally fierceful warrior, defeats the Greek army with his great war skills. In his second reluctant attack Hector kills the cousin of Achilles, mistaking him for Achilles himself. This greatly angers Achilles and kills Hector in a one to one tussle, avenging his cousin&#8217;s death. Achilles repents for this act of his, when King Priam begs to give back his brave son&#8217;s corpse for last funeral rights. After a brief peace assurance for twelve days, the Greeks enter the impregnable Troy walls hidden in a wooden horse, which the Trojans mistake for a gift to their God Apollo, for having attacked Troy. The Greeks plunder Troy by burning the city to ashes, ruthlessly killing the men and the babies after raping their women. The royal family women along with Prince Paris escape through a secret passage built by Hector. Agamemnon, Menelaus and Priam along with all their great generals die in this dastard attack in the night. Achilles, also gets killed by Paris&#8217;s deadly arrows when the former tries to find his lover Brisies in the palace. Finally, Achilles is given full royal funeral pyre in the ruins of Troy by the Greeks, as a farewell to the greatest warrior that ever lived on this Earth.Positives:  One of the greatest epic war movies ever made in the history of world cinema. Another proof that mankind&#8217;s self destruction happens only due to the hunger for either power or a woman. Lot of study and research has gone into the making of this movie which has given the right aroma of excitement through hair raising scenes brought out in the greatest wars of olden days. The true story of the rivalry between Greece and Troy and the great war that resulted in destruction of one of the most prosperous and powerful kingdom of Troy is exquisitely shown on silver screen. Kudos to the production and technical team which captured every minute detail of the true epic story, on celluloid. The warrior skills of Achilles and Hector, the two greatest warriors of those days, was brought back to life as if those men exist even today, amongst us. Perfect screenplay, music, action, and result.Negatives: Though Brad Pitt well suited as Achilles, Eric Bana as Prince Hector, seemed a little misfit. Hector was shown as too weak compared to Achilles both in physique and mental state, which is actually, not true, in history. There should have been more of Helen and Paris, whose selfish love (rather infatuation) was the actual reason behind the fall of a great kingdom and death of two great warriors.My rating is 4.75 out of 5",5,A Masterpeice in Action,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,3873,"['Directed', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'Produced', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson/Diana', 'Rathbun/Colin', 'Wilson', 'Starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'Troy', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'Troy', 'Diana', 'Kruger', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Agamemnon', 'lead', 'roles.Storyline', 'king', 'Achaea', 'old', 'Greece', 'Agamemnon', 'king', 'Sparta', 'Menelaus', 'were', 'brothers', 'Agamemnon', 'had', 'long', 'cherished', 'wish', 'capture', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'kingdom', 'Troy', 'ruled', 'King', 'Priam', 'who', 'peace', 'pact', 'Sparta', 'avoid', 'invasion', 'Agamemnon', 'younger', 'Prince', 'Troy', 'Paris', 'love', 'wife', 'Agamemnon', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Menelaus', 'Agamemnon', 'reason', 'attack', 'Troy', 'forces', '1000', 'ships', 'take', 'help', 'Achilles', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'ever', 'born', 'world', 'lord', 'deadly', 'warrior', 'clan', 'Greece', 'called', 'Myrmidons', 'attack', 'Achilles', 'unwillingly', 'up', 'job', 'was', 'principles', 'Agamemnon', 'unjustified', 'invasions', 'Achilles', 'skillfully', 'initial', 'war', 'Troy', 'taking', 'over', 'coveted', 'Temple', 'Apollo', 'where', 'beautiful', 'Brisies', 'cousin', 'Prince', 'Troy', 'Hector', 'whom', 'love', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'elder', 'son', 'King', 'Priam', 'equally', 'fierceful', 'warrior', 'Greek', 'army', 'great', 'war', 'skills', 'second', 'reluctant', 'attack', 'Hector', 'cousin', 'Achilles', 'mistaking', 'Achilles', 'greatly', 'angers', 'Achilles', 'kills', 'Hector', 'one', 'one', 'tussle', 'avenging', 'cousin', '8217', 's', 'death', 'repents', 'act', 'when', 'King', 'Priam', 'begs', 'give', 'back', 'brave', 'son', '8217', 'corpse', 'last', 'funeral', 'rights', 'brief', 'peace', 'assurance', 'twelve', 'days', 'Greeks', 'enter', 'impregnable', 'Troy', 'walls', 'hidden', 'wooden', 'horse', 'Trojans', 'mistake', 'gift', 'God', 'Apollo', 'having', 'attacked', 'Troy', 'Greeks', 'plunder', 'Troy', 'burning', 'city', 'ashes', 'ruthlessly', 'killing', 'men', 'babies', 'raping', 'women', 'royal', 'family', 'women', 'Prince', 'Paris', 'escape', 'secret', 'passage', 'built', 'Hector', 'Agamemnon', 'Menelaus', 'Priam', 'great', 'generals', 'die', 'dastard', 'attack', 'night', 'Achilles', 'also', 'killed', 'Paris', '8217', 'deadly', 'when', 'former', 'tries', 'find', 'lover', 'Brisies', 'palace', 'Finally', 'Achilles', 'given', 'full', 'royal', 'funeral', 'pyre', 'ruins', 'Troy', 'Greeks', 'farewell', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'ever', 'lived', 'Earth.Positives', 'One', 'greatest', 'epic', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'history', 'world', 'cinema', 'proof', 'mankind', '8217', 'destruction', 'only', 'due', 'hunger', 'power', 'woman', 'Lot', 'study', 'research', 'gone', 'making', 'movie', 'given', 'right', 'aroma', 'excitement', 'hair', 'raising', 'scenes', 'brought', 'out', 'greatest', 'wars', 'olden', 'days', 'true', 'story', 'rivalry', 'Greece', 'Troy', 'great', 'war', 'resulted', 'destruction', 'one', 'most', 'prosperous', 'powerful', 'kingdom', 'Troy', 'exquisitely', 'shown', 'silver', 'screen', 'Kudos', 'production', 'technical', 'team', 'captured', 'minute', 'detail', 'true', 'epic', 'story', 'celluloid', 'warrior', 'skills', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'two', 'greatest', 'warriors', 'days', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'men', 'exist', 'even', 'today', 'amongst', 'Perfect', 'screenplay', 'music', 'action', 'result.Negatives', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'well', 'suited', 'Achilles', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'seemed', 'little', 'misfit', 'Hector', 'was', 'shown', 'too', 'weak', 'compared', 'Achilles', 'physique', 'mental', 'state', 'actually', 'not', 'true', 'history', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Helen', 'Paris', 'selfish', 'love', 'rather', 'infatuation', 'was', 'actual', 'reason', 'fall', 'great', 'kingdom', 'death', 'two', 'great', 'warriors.My', 'rating', '4.75', '5']",N/A
852228,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B0002Z0EXQ,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[4, 5]","Troy should be the sort of movie that I love -- a lavish, sword-and-sandal epic. A real man's movie! Sadly, although there is a great deal to like about it, it's so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with its characters. That said, if you love exciting, epic battle scenes, or summer blockbuster films, or even just seeing an unfairly handsome and buffed Brad Pitt, all sweaty and virtually nude, then read on . . .Film is a visual medium, and the original story is very, very long, so I can accept that many changes needed to be made. But in a bizarre move, all of the mythology of the original legend has been removed, and the story is rather presented as a historical epic, and not a mythological tale. I feel this was a great loss. I understand Director Wolfgang Petersen saw the gods as ""silly and unnecessary to the plot"". But when you consider the popularity of shows like Xena, I think audiences would be more accepting of mythology than Petersen gives them credit for.However, for me, the biggest problem with Troy is David Benioff's overly simplified screenplay: He manages to reduce a ten-year war to what appears to feel like just a week or so, he reduces Paris and Helen's romance to dopey teenage ""I love yous"", and a lot of the dialogue is empty rhetoric, with Achilles barking empty catch-phrases such as ""Immortality! Take it! It's yours!"". Indeed, the film is so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with the characters. I recall seeing this film at the cinema and not really caring if any of the characters were killed. It's a pity that some of that $US200 million spent on the film couldn't have been spent on a script-doctor.The quality of Petersen's direction also varies. On one hand, he brings epic and complex action scenes with awesome set pieces to life with great precision. On the other hand, almost everything in Troy looks and feels fake. Many of the amazing sets and costumes, look like . . . well . . . amazing sets and costumes. Rather than looking like soldiers dragged into a brutal, soul-crushing, ten-year campaign, the men often look like they've just shown up that morning, and had some dirt or dust rubbed onto them. Their weapons don't look used, and the buildings don't look lived in.For me, apart from the stunning visuals and the beautifully fluid camera work, the most outstanding thing in Troy is Achilles' fight scenes. Over many months, Brad Pitt was trained by swordsman Steven Ho, and he swings his sword with a poetically elegant and deadly style.There is a lot to marvel at in Troy: The eye-popping visuals, seamless CGI-rendered grandeur, and the epic battle scenes, but if the same attention to detail had been applied to the rest of the film, as it has to Pitt's swordplay, Troy might have been a truly classic epic film.",4,Entertaining!,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2877,"['Troy', 'should', 'be', 'sort', 'movie', 'love', 'lavish', 'sword-and-sandal', 'epic', 'real', 'man', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'great', 'deal', 'like', 'so', 'solemn', 'pretentious', 'impersonal', 'emotionally', 'involve', 'audience', 'characters', 'said', 'love', 'exciting', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'even', 'just', 'seeing', 'unfairly', 'handsome', 'buffed', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'sweaty', 'virtually', 'nude', 'then', 'read', '.Film', 'visual', 'medium', 'original', 'story', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'can', 'accept', 'many', 'changes', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'bizarre', 'move', 'mythology', 'original', 'legend', 'been', 'removed', 'story', 'rather', 'presented', 'historical', 'epic', 'not', 'mythological', 'tale', 'feel', 'was', 'great', 'loss', 'understand', 'Director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'saw', 'gods', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'when', 'consider', 'popularity', 'shows', 'Xena', 'think', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accepting', 'mythology', 'Petersen', 'credit', 'for.However', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Troy', 'David', 'Benioff', 'overly', 'simplified', 'screenplay', 'reduce', 'ten-year', 'war', 'what', 'feel', 'just', 'week', 'so', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'romance', 'dopey', 'teenage', 'love', 'yous', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'empty', 'rhetoric', 'Achilles', 'barking', 'empty', 'catch-phrases', 'such', 'Immortality', 'Take', 'Indeed', 'film', 'so', 'solemn', 'pretentious', 'impersonal', 'emotionally', 'involve', 'audience', 'characters', 'recall', 'seeing', 'film', 'cinema', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'pity', 'US200', 'million', 'spent', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'script-doctor.The', 'quality', 'Petersen', 'direction', 'also', 'one', 'hand', 'epic', 'complex', 'action', 'scenes', 'awesome', 'set', 'pieces', 'life', 'great', 'precision', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'everything', 'Troy', 'looks', 'feels', 'fake', 'Many', 'amazing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'look', 'well', 'amazing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Rather', 'looking', 'soldiers', 'dragged', 'brutal', 'soul-crushing', 'ten-year', 'campaign', 'men', 'often', 'look', ""'ve"", 'just', 'shown', 'up', 'morning', 'had', 'dirt', 'dust', 'rubbed', 'weapons', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'used', 'buildings', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'lived', 'in.For', 'apart', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'beautifully', 'fluid', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'outstanding', 'thing', 'Troy', 'Achilles', 'fight', 'scenes', 'many', 'months', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'trained', 'swordsman', 'Steven', 'Ho', 'swings', 'sword', 'poetically', 'elegant', 'deadly', 'lot', 'marvel', 'Troy', 'eye-popping', 'visuals', 'seamless', 'CGI-rendered', 'grandeur', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'same', 'attention', 'detail', 'had', 'been', 'applied', 'rest', 'film', 'Pitt', 'swordplay', 'Troy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'classic', 'epic', 'film']",N/A

Lovesick Prince Paris has run off with Helen to his land of Troy.  Helen's husband wants her back, and convinces Greek King Agamemnon to ""launch a thousand ships"" and bring Helen back.  The King enlists the aid of Achilles, and the battle begins.On the plus side, the movie looks just great, with spectacular sets and thousands of soldiers who fight gallantly.  The supporting cast is wonderful; in particular Eric Bana as Paris' brother, Hector, and Peter O'Toole as his father, King Prium.  Their scenes are the best in the film.On the down side, Brad Pitt, while ruggedly handsome and sincere, never really loses himself in the character of an ancient Greek hero; you can't forget he's Brad Pitt.  The actress who plays Helen is not the classic beauty one would expect and looks like so many modern starlets.  The battle scenes are for the most part filmed in close-ups and edited in very quick shots, which makes them look blurry and chaotic, and you may need a scorecard to keep up with all the characters.Troy has the look and feel of a good epic, but isn't a great one.

In one of the well made movies of this year, Brad Pitt gives a magnetic performance as Achilles, the emotionally wounded warrior, that is said to be one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. Eric Bana gives an equally magnetic performance as Hector, the heir to the throne of Troy, eldest son of King Priam. Orlando Bloom gives a strong performance as Paris, brother of Hector, youngest son of King Priam. The rest of the cast, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Diane Kruger as Helen, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Sean Bean as Odyseeus, Julie Christie as Thetis, Peter O' Toole as Priam, Saffron Burrows as Andromache, & Rose Byrne as Briseis, give splendid performances. This movie is well made and well fashioned, visually and emotionally. The production budget for this movie is nearly $200 million. The directing by Wolfgang Petersen is brilliant without compromise. The screenplay by David Benioff, who wrote the screenplay for ""The 25th Hour"", is brilliant. The score by James Horner is brilliant. The cinematography by Roger Pratt is brilliant. The film editing by Peter Honess is excellent. The casting by Edward Mercieca and Lucinda Syson is excellent. The production design by Nigel Phelps and costume design by Bob Ringwood is brilliant.

But this fantastic movie is by no means riding on Ridley Scott's coat-tails, TROY is a movie on it's own and is far better for it.Fantastic one on one fights and epic battles are all present and correct. The special effectc really deserve the term 'special', with seamless CGI interacting with live action shots throughout the intimidating running time. For once, a movie where the immense budget was well worth it. Brad Pitt's Achilles is great, he imbodies the ruthless immortal with gusto and gravitas. Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom are impressive also.Wolfgang Petersen's bravado direction makes this a truly epic adventure, with enough old-fashioned entertainment to shake a stick at. There are great moments of quiet subtlety and powerful performances from veteran Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox (X-Men 2). Those expecting a heroic turn from Orlando will be surprised, but it shows good range. Brendan Gleason and Tyler Mane make memorable turns in battle.

It's not that Troy is a bad film, because it is most certainly not.  And if you haven't read the Iliad then it's a way to ease into the story without dealing with all of Homer's language, which is beautiful but like Shakespeare can be hard to follow if you're not into it.  But for those of us who have read the Iliad and love Homer's story telling ability as well as the language in which is conveys it, Troy the movie is somewhat of a disappointment. To say the very least.While the film is action packed and fast moving it also glosses over some very important components of the original text.  While trying to sanitize it for the masses it has been stripped of some key and compelling elements.  The gods have been relegated to hushed background chatter; the very fact that Achilles himself is a demigod, hence his superior abilities has been completely lost.  The fact that he had a weak spot to exploit (by a purely lucky shot on Paris' part) makes his death far less dramatic and quite frankly anticlimactic.  And to top it all off the relationship between Achilles and Patroculos has been so homogenized as to ask the question why would Achilles mourn for him the way he did none the less go after Hector for killing him in battle.It is a shame that apparently some of us can't get past the concept of two men can loving each other in every sense of the word and still being fierce warriors.  Achilles is written more nobly in the film than he was in the Iliad because while great he was a selfish and at times childish man.  Who turned his back on his people in a time of war because he was slighted by Agamemnon.If you want some fluff, with a macho action hero punch then buy Troy, not the worst way to spend a Saturday night.",3,Okay for what it is...,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,1840,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'am', 'revisionist', 'history', ""'m"", 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Troy', 'not', 'Troy', 'bad', 'film', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Iliad', 'then', 'way', 'ease', 'story', 'dealing', 'Homer', 'language', 'beautiful', 'Shakespeare', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', ""'re"", 'not', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Iliad', 'love', 'Homer', 'story', 'telling', 'ability', 'as', 'well', 'language', 'conveys', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'say', 'very', 'film', 'action', 'packed', 'fast', 'moving', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'components', 'original', 'text', 'trying', 'sanitize', 'masses', 'been', 'stripped', 'key', 'compelling', 'elements', 'gods', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'hushed', 'background', 'chatter', 'very', 'fact', 'Achilles', 'demigod', 'hence', 'superior', 'abilities', 'been', 'completely', 'lost', 'fact', 'had', 'weak', 'spot', 'exploit', 'purely', 'lucky', 'shot', 'Paris', 'part', 'death', 'far', 'less', 'dramatic', 'quite', 'frankly', 'anticlimactic', 'top', 'relationship', 'Achilles', 'Patroculos', 'been', 'so', 'homogenized', 'ask', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'Achilles', 'mourn', 'way', 'did', 'none', 'less', 'go', 'Hector', 'killing', 'battle.It', 'shame', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'concept', 'two', 'men', 'can', 'loving', 'other', 'sense', 'word', 'still', 'being', 'fierce', 'warriors', 'Achilles', 'written', 'more', 'nobly', 'film', 'was', 'Iliad', 'great', 'was', 'selfish', 'times', 'childish', 'man', 'Who', 'turned', 'back', 'people', 'time', 'war', 'was', 'slighted', 'Agamemnon.If', 'want', 'fluff', 'macho', 'action', 'hero', 'punch', 'then', 'buy', 'Troy', 'not', 'worst', 'way', 'spend', 'Saturday', 'night']",N/A

That movie told the tale of a Union raid on the Railway station at . . . somewhere, it might not of been Atlanta. It was a story about the stress between the Doctor, Holden (why are all Doctors so pacifist . . .don't we have any facist Doctors anymore?) and the Hawk Wayne. It's also the answer to the trivia question ""In what John Wayne movie set in the 1860's does a jet airplane fly over the blue skies."" It also says very little about the Civil War, neither makes any attempt to be accurate and kind of freelances from scene to scene.The point is that no movie made by Hollywood and an army of CPA's is going to risk taking on The Illiad or any other ancient text. It's not supposed to. The Illiad, along with Hamlet, Exodus, Chaucer and probably a 1000 other great stories weren't written for anything but paper. Or in Homer's time, papyrus. Or scrolls.

Perhaps some people become inspired to actually read Illiad.The focus is on fight scenes, rather than on dialogue, and while some people think there should've been more fight scenes, I think there were plenty.  I can't exactly imagine people from the Meditarrean area as blond, but I did like Brad Pitt as Achilles and a star of the movie.  Eric Bana, who played Hector, admittedly played his role very well, though he didn't physically appear (to me) to be a warrior, or a fighter - and he had a lot of fighting to do in this movie.  It seems it befell him to engage in many fights that were not really his own, but rather, he fought them due to some questionable decisions other people made. Peter O'Toole, who played Priam, and Julie Christie, who played Thetis - Achilles' mother, had somewhat brief, but very-well acted parts.Even though the main reason for the Trojan War seems to be the fact that Paris to Helen (queen of sparta and wife of Menelaus) to Troy, it is only an excuse for the war that was much wanted and only needed one good reason to be instigated.  Agamemnon already wanted to appropriate Troy (that's how the movie begins), and since his earlier attempt(s) didn't work out, he was more than happy to oblige, when his brother Menelaus came enraged because Paris took his wife.",4,Enjoyable Movie,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1485,"['spite', 'fact', 'movie', 'history', 'suppose', 'will', 'still', 'leave', 'good', 'deal', 'people', 'knowing', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Trojan', 'War', 'did', 'before', 'Perhaps', 'people', 'become', 'inspired', 'actually', 'read', 'Illiad.The', 'focus', 'fight', 'scenes', 'rather', 'dialogue', 'people', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'think', 'were', 'plenty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'imagine', 'people', 'Meditarrean', 'area', 'blond', 'did', 'like', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'star', 'movie', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'played', 'Hector', 'admittedly', 'played', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'physically', 'appear', 'be', 'warrior', 'fighter', 'had', 'lot', 'fighting', 'do', 'movie', 'befell', 'engage', 'many', 'fights', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'own', 'rather', 'fought', 'due', 'questionable', 'decisions', 'other', 'people', 'made', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'played', 'Priam', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'who', 'played', 'Thetis', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'had', 'somewhat', 'brief', 'very-well', 'acted', 'parts.Even', 'main', 'reason', 'Trojan', 'War', 'be', 'fact', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'queen', 'sparta', 'wife', 'Menelaus', 'Troy', 'only', 'excuse', 'war', 'was', 'much', 'wanted', 'only', 'needed', 'one', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'instigated', 'Agamemnon', 'already', 'wanted', 'appropriate', 'Troy', 'how', 'movie', 'earlier', 'attempt', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'oblige', 'when', 'brother', 'Menelaus', 'came', 'enraged', 'Paris', 'took', 'wife']",N/A
852239,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002Z0EXQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","As a teacher of Classical Greek and Roman Mythology I was really looking forward to ""Troy."" In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the ""Iliad,"" but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy.""I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war certainly makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that tlegitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but they are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was ""inspired"" by Homer's ""Iliad,"" which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it.The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles. Stories abound about how Pitt worked six months to get in shape for this film, gave up smoking, and ended up hurting his Achilles tendon in one of those profound ironies that indicates that maybe the gods were not pleased with what was happening in this film. Pitt certainly looks good, not just in terms of taking several opportunities to display the line of his nude body, but in how he carries himself as Achilles. The whole idea is that this guy is the greatest warrior on the face of the planet and Pitt exudes that with the way he strides across the sands of Troy. Even more impressive is the choreography for the fights, because Pitt's movements are so smooth and powerful, especially compared with that of Eric Bana's Hector, that you do not doubt that this guy is in a league by himself as a warrior. I also like the way he uses the distinctive form of his shield when fighting. They thought this part out quite a bit.The fight choreography was worked out by Simon Crane, the film's stunt coordinator and second unit director, who describes Achilles as fighting with a boxing style but with the velocity of a speed skater and the agility of a panther. They also come up with a nice touch in that Achilles looks slightly to the side at his opponent until he is ready to come in for the kill. The best fight sequences of ""Troy"" are when Achilles is fighting. The giant battle sequences of computerized soldiers are not as impressive, mainly because the camera is always in motion and the cutting is so fast that we are left with an impression of the battle rather than always being able to tell what is going on (which has become my constant complaint with most movies with large battle sequences).Bana does a good job of capturing Hector's nobility without turning him into a marble statue, while Peter O'Toole fills the role of Priam naturally. On the Trojan side the problematic character is Paris (Orlando Bloom), again because of the writing more than the performance. Priam has negotiated peace between Troy and the Sparta of King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), but that is destroyed when Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him. Both Hector and Priam know that Paris is wrong and their reasons for supporting him and thereby dooming Troy ring hollow (the less than stellar ""Helen of Troy"" television miniseries did a nice job of providing a solid motivation for the Trojans to protect Helen).It you want to draw a clear distinction between Homer's story of Achilles and that of Benioff it is that the former is about the rage of Achilles (see the first line of the ""Iliad"") and the latter adds an equally strong love element. The one character whose role is most inflated in this version is that of Briseis (Rose Byrne), the Trojan slave girl who comes between Achilles and Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king of kings for the Greeks. This change becomes the reasoning behind how the film rewrites the end game of the Trojan War, although I still do not understand why some of the key characters get to live happily ever after. But since Pitt's performance dominates the film and he is clearly the horse that director Wolfgang Petersen is riding to make the whole thing work, it makes sense that he has to be around until the very end.Each semester about a third of my students take the option to compare ""Troy"" to what they know about Homer's ""Iliad"" and the mythology of the Trojan War.  Most of them take exception to the changes as well, which I find interesting because most of them saw the movie before they got around to reading ""what really happened.""  I have expanded their options to include the recent ""Helen of Troy"" mini-series, but ""Troy"" is still their favorite target.",4,Brad Pitt might be Achilles but David Benioff is no

852242,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B0002Z0EXQ,L. E. Cantrell,"[3, 7]","First, why does every movie that tackles Troy have to cover the whole war?  Homer certainly never attempted to do any such thing in the Iliad.  Aristotle, in fact, praised him for keeping his focus and concentrating on just a few events in the middle of the war.  After all, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" managed to tell a pretty good story without dragging in either the Munich Conference or the atomic bomb.Second, the movie abounds with spectacular sword fights.  That is all very well--but it is neither Homer nor history.  The ancient poet makes it abundantly clear that the primary weapon of most combatants was the spear--giving special emphasis to Achilles' own particularly massive weapon.  (All right, all right, you Freudians can stop giggling now.)  A minority of the heroes, including the Lesser Ajax and Pandaros, used the bow as their primary weapon.  In all cases, the sword--or more precisely, the Mycenean rapier--was a secondary weapon.  Showing the combats before Troy contested with swords is about as accurate as showing the Battle of the Bulge fought with six-shooters.In Greece, there are numerous examples of both spear heads and bronze rapiers being found buried with the bodies of their owners.  The rapier was a thrusting weapon not a cutting weapon.  The reason for this is that it was made without an extended tang around which a hilt could be fastened.  Rather, it widened at the base and provided three holes arranged at a right angle to the direction of thrust.  The hilt was fitted around the base and riveted to it.  The problem with this arrangement is that bronze is a soft metal.  A thrust will work with no trouble, but a cut with such a weapon will tear through the bronze, leaving an embarrassed warrior waving a sword that has acquired a new hinge or, even worse, with just a hilt in his hand.  Since most of the grave swords are broken in just that manner, we can pretty well tell how it was that their owners came to be buried in the first place.Third--now we're getting picky--there are contemporary illustrations of Mycenean warriors--Homer's Achaeans--using the rapier.  The most famous one appears on a fabulous inlayed dagger blade.  Offhand, I cannot remember ever seeing the rapier used in anything but the overhand position, just as though it were a long dagger or maybe a short spear.Fourth, all the strong-grieved Acheans should be in bronze armor--shining bronze armor.  They should look like an array of bright, new pennies.Fifth, Achilles, who always goes to battle in a chariot is shown on horseback--arrgh!Sixth, the missing gods...!Ahem.As for the movie, it wasn't a trainwreck.  Not a total trainwreck, anyway.

852245,A3KB1H0S7T6JX1,B0002Z0EXQ,L Gontzes,"[5, 6]","Troy is a very good movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Homer's story of the Trojan War to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the original, rather it is INSPIRED by Homer's Iliad, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the original story. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied the Iliad, you know the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was when Achilles enters the city of Troy, which he never actually did.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is the Iliad in question and not some modern twentieth century novel.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the Iliad) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did occur according to Homer.  Consequently, due to the distortion of Homer's work, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Homer when they really do not.  Not good!Lastly, special emphasis must be made on the point that the Trojans are Greeks too, with the same language, the same gods, the same names etc, which is another thing that the movie does not stress enough, leaving relations between the combatants vague/open to any theory.On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is very good and the cast are wonderful.  Peter O'Toole, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, and the rest of the actors have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality and entertainment it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for deviating so much from the original and creating a sense of confusion among viewers.",4,Mixed emotions from Greece,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,2217,"['Troy', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'life', 'director', 'version', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Homer', 'story', 'Trojan', 'War', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'not', 'faithfully', 'follow', 'original', 'rather', 'INSPIRED', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'therefore', 'great', 'deal', 'flaws', 'deviations', 'original', 'story', 'One', 'could', 'list', 'one', 'discrepancies', 'occur', 'have', 'read/studied', 'Iliad', 'know', 'list', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'long', 'indeed', 'will', 'say', 'too', 'long', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'most', 'important', 'alteration', 'course', 'was', 'when', 'Achilles', 'city', 'Troy', 'never', 'actually', 'did', 'Even', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'flexible', 'lenient', 'when', 'dealing', 'adaptations', 'one', 'should', 'also', 'keep', 'mind', 'Iliad', 'question', 'not', 'modern', 'twentieth', 'century', 'novel', 'Therefore', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'arises', 'when', 'majority', 'people', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'Iliad', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'start', 'believing', 'events', 'happened', 'way', 'movie', 'depicts/portrays', 'not', 'way', 'actually', 'did', 'occur', 'according', 'Homer', 'Consequently', 'due', 'distortion', 'Homer', 'work', 'movie', 'very', 'serious', 'danger', 'producing', 'armies', 'misinformed', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'Homer', 'when', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'Not', 'good', 'Lastly', 'special', 'emphasis', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'point', 'Trojans', 'are', 'Greeks', 'too', 'same', 'language', 'same', 'gods', 'same', 'names', 'etc', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'leaving', 'relations', 'combatants', 'vague/open', 'theory.On', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'rest', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'set', 'ancient', 'times', 'demand', 'definitely', 'there.In', 'short', 'belief', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'top', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'short', '5', 'stars', 'deviating', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'creating', 'sense', 'confusion', 'viewers']",N/A

It's almost three hours long but the time does fly.  There are battles and swordsmanship and characters spouting lines that are so overdone that I burst out laughing.  But who really cares about historical context in a film like this?  And if the nuances seem a little modern for this 3000-year-old myth by Homer, it doesn't really matter. When he wrote it, little did he know that it had all the makings of a Hollywood spectacle, including a romance at its core. This is when one of the princes of Troy, after a couple of nights of stolen passion, whisked away the beautiful Helen who was married to the King of Sparta.  Later, Troy would eventually be destroyed because of this and everyone watching the film probably knew that but yet, it's great fun to see how it all plays out.Brad Pitt is cast as Achilles, a warrior for the Spartans who is having second thoughts about the wisdom of serving his king. It's obvious he's been to the gym because of his defined muscles and a body shape crafted by a personal trainer and vitamin supplements. He's also been trained in swordplay and there is one scene in which he is teaching his younger male cousin to fence which might be viewed as homo-erotic.  However, there are other scenes in which he defines himself as a man who loves women, especially in the scene in which he seduces the young female cousin of the King of Troy.The performance of the woman cast as Helen and her Prince lover plays like amateur hour.  However, Eric Bana, an actor I have never seen before, is cast as Hector, the prince's older brother.  His performance is masterful and his presence dominated every scene he was in.  But as far as I'm concerned, the very best performance of all was by Peter O'Toole, cast as the King of Troy.  There is one scene in particular, in which he begs Achilles, who has just murdered the king's son Hector, for the right to give his Hector a dignified burial.  Shakespearian in nature, this is a scene I will long remember.This film can be enjoyed only if you don't think about historical reality and just relax and watch the forces of lust and revenge and warfare and pomp and glitter let you forget that this film is downright silly.  Of course Troy falls far short of my highest recommendation, but frankly, I recommend you see it anyway.  It's a pleasant diversion and an evening's entertainment.",4,Forget historical context.

852251,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B0002Z0EXQ,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[10, 11]","...in this movie doesn't belong to Helen of Troy, but to Brad Pitt's Achilles!This is because the most striking-looking person, very much on purpose as a superblond, is Brad-illes. I had heard that he gave up smoking and worked out in order to be buff enough to be Achilles. Well, the only other movie I ever saw Brad in was ""Legends of the Fall"", of which I have an imperfect memory, so I'm almost coming to Brad sight-unseen. Therefore, I can say with perfect candor that he's great!I had my doubts about this movie, I had to admit. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I did like it. Is it a movie for purists, though? Oh, no, not in the least. It's been twenty years since I read the Iliad, but even I can tell what's not true to the text here here.1. No gods anywhere in sight. A good chunk of the original poem concerns all the machinations of the gods behind (or is it above?) the scenes. Not a breath of that here. Brad-illes makes some comments about the gods, quite reminiscent of how Kevin Sorbo's Hercules character says disparaging things about Hera. Of course, any time a movie has tried to show the gods, it just looks SO dopey; think ""Clash of the Titans"" and feel yourself blush. So, to dispense with that whole set of characters not only saved paychecks but also face. But the subliminal message I think is that the gods are hooey--no amount of worship, sacrifice, whatever, is of any avail. It's rather nihilistic in feel. Good people die and bad people triumph, if only for a while.2. Characters die here who don't die at Troy. I guess it would be wrong to say just who, but let me put it this way: At a ""trial by combat"" kind of scene in the very beginning, a character got slain whom I know for a fact is still alive enough to get a visit from Odysseus in ""The Odyssey"". Once this happened, I said to myself, TutorGal anything's possible in this here movie! Then there's a big climax scene, when a woman character is being sexually threatened by another Major Character, and she kills him--even though he gets his own play and a different kind of hosing in his legendary bath later on.3. Other characters don't even appear at all. Like the famous Cassandra, who says in effect ""Hey, I wouldn't bring that big wooden horse in here if I were you!"" And her mother, Hecuba, who Hamlet takes on about in one of his soliloquys. I guess the story held together without them, but I did miss them.There's probably a lot of other stuff too, like the Great Balls of Fire (gotta go see it to find out what that means), that aren't in the source material, but still and all, I think it worked well enough.Some other reviewers take umbrage at the casting, but I don't think there are any problems on that score. Brad looks rather surfer-ish in some respects, but he's not as All-American as others would paint him. He's shown to be a not-very-pleasant person, chuck full-o anger. I found him believable enough.Yeah, Helen is something of a nonentity, but my rationale on that is that it was necessary to have a very young woman play Helen if your Paris were going to be Orlando Bloom, who seems like a high schooler in many respects. They match well agewise. I also think that to play a different kind of Helen, a more seductive kind, you'd need a much older actress, say about 35, who knew her own sexuality very well. But if there were a Helen like that, King Priam would have given her the heave-ho because she'd have known the repercussions of her actions too well to be forgiven.Speaking of King Priam, Peter O'Toole is one of my favorites this time around. Once famous as a Golden Boy himself 40 years ago, now Sir PO'T sports his white hair very elegantly. When he sees the 1,000 ships sailing right for his beach, he did what I call ""face acting""--he decided to show fear and alarm by making his face long. A trick worthy of the late great Olivier himself--had to lean over to tell my companion, ""Looks like he's opening up his can of ham!""  There's a very strange encounter between him and Brad-illes towards the end of the movie, where Brad almost seems frightened of him, continually moving away from him.

That some didnt like this movie is understandable, but to call it a ""bad movie"" or ""boring""? I just think that's a giant stretch even by the harshest of critics.Troy, is a wonderful modern-day interpretation of Homer's ""The Illiad"" which must be one of the most well known story's of all time. The Trojan war was long thought to be a myth, which no basis in reality. Untill one historian spent his life searching for the city of Troy and found what he believed to be it's ruins. This sparked a lot of debate on whether such a tale might well have it's roots in real events.""Troy"" is born of this desire to contemplate ""what may have really happened"". It doesnt have any God's or Godesses, nor does it really stick firm to Homer's tale. What it does is take Homer's work and reintepret it through the mindset of ""hey this is what might have really went down"". This is why many such as Robert Ebert didnt like ""Troy"", because they were expecting Homer.But the storyline of troy has all the essence of homer only portrayed in a more realisitic version. Helen, wife of the king of Sparta, falls in love with Paris Prince of the powerful city state of Troy. She willingly sneaks out of Sparta and from a loveless marriage to the trojan boat and returns with Paris to Troy. This sparks a chain of events culminating in a massive war and the fall of a city. The King of Sparta is outraged and appeals to his brother - Agamemnon - who has just finished uniting the cities of greece under his rule. Using his brother's misfortune as a pretext for war, he assembles a 40,000 man strong army and sails them to troy on 1,000 ships. And so begins the trojan war.The acting throughout the movie varies from acceptable to spectacular. Brad pit gives an excellent performance as the hero Achilles. But Achilles of the movie is not immortal or divine, just an amazing warrior with a complex personality consisting of strong narcasism and some true honor (they dont always mix well). The character of hector is brilliantly portrayed as a man who has seen war and knows there is no glory in it, the antithesis of achilles. While Peter O'Toole (yes from Lawrence of Arabia!) does a FANTASTIC job as the Trojan king Priam. One scene is truly dramatic as he begs achilles for the body of his fallen son, proclaiming ""even enemies can show respect"".The battle scenes and special effects are amazing, and the battles in troy are second to none. But it's not all action, in fact much of troy is a look at the nature of war and politics. How the macro affects the micro. How small events trigger big ones. How ordinary people can play a part in larger than life stories. And how history plays out similar stories again and again. There's a strong anti-war message underlying the film. There's also a lot of unfinished ideas and holes in troy that never get filled. The end feels rushed and thrown together, and some interesting ideas brought up by the film are never fully explored. This is made up for by some truly GREAT scenes. Such as when the Greek fleet apears on the horizons of Troy. Bells are sounded, and all the characters react when they look out to see the horizon clouded with enemy ships. This scene is so well done it amazed me.All things considered I found Troy to not only be a great movie, but a great analysis of how the world works and how the greed of the few culminates in the suffering of the many. It wasnt as powerful as gladiator, and it isnt going to have the broader appeal of LOTR (it's not that kinda movie at all, completely different genre in fact), but while it's no Brave Heart, troy is the first movie in a while to come close to being in that class and is certainly an excellent movie.",5,Fantastic Epic!,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,3779,"['First', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'saw', 'same', 'movie', 'nay', 'sayers', 'have', 'seen', 'didnt', 'movie', 'understandable', 'call', 'bad', 'movie', 'boring', 'just', 'think', 'giant', 'stretch', 'even', 'harshest', 'critics.Troy', 'wonderful', 'modern-day', 'interpretation', 'Homer', 'Illiad', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'time', 'Trojan', 'war', 'was', 'long', 'thought', 'be', 'myth', 'basis', 'reality', 'Untill', 'one', 'historian', 'spent', 'life', 'searching', 'city', 'Troy', 'found', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'ruins', 'sparked', 'lot', 'debate', 'such', 'tale', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'roots', 'real', 'events', 'Troy', 'born', 'desire', 'contemplate', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'happened', 'doesnt', 'have', 'God', 'Godesses', 'really', 'stick', 'firm', 'Homer', 'tale', 'What', 'take', 'Homer', 'work', 'reintepret', 'mindset', 'hey', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'really', 'went', 'down', 'why', 'many', 'such', 'Robert', 'Ebert', 'didnt', 'Troy', 'were', 'expecting', 'Homer.But', 'storyline', 'troy', 'essence', 'homer', 'only', 'portrayed', 'more', 'realisitic', 'version', 'Helen', 'wife', 'king', 'Sparta', 'love', 'Paris', 'Prince', 'powerful', 'city', 'state', 'Troy', 'willingly', 'Sparta', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'trojan', 'boat', 'returns', 'Paris', 'Troy', 'chain', 'events', 'culminating', 'massive', 'war', 'fall', 'city', 'King', 'Sparta', 'outraged', 'appeals', 'brother', 'Agamemnon', 'who', 'just', 'finished', 'uniting', 'cities', 'greece', 'rule', 'Using', 'brother', 'misfortune', 'pretext', 'war', '40,000', 'man', 'strong', 'army', 'sails', 'troy', '1,000', 'ships', 'so', 'trojan', 'war.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'varies', 'acceptable', 'spectacular', 'Brad', 'pit', 'excellent', 'performance', 'hero', 'Achilles', 'Achilles', 'movie', 'not', 'immortal', 'divine', 'just', 'amazing', 'warrior', 'complex', 'personality', 'consisting', 'strong', 'narcasism', 'true', 'honor', 'dont', 'always', 'mix', 'well', 'character', 'hector', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'war', 'knows', 'glory', 'antithesis', 'achilles', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'FANTASTIC', 'job', 'Trojan', 'king', 'Priam', 'One', 'scene', 'truly', 'dramatic', 'achilles', 'body', 'fallen', 'son', 'proclaiming', 'even', 'enemies', 'can', 'show', 'respect', '.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'battles', 'troy', 'are', 'second', 'none', 'not', 'action', 'fact', 'much', 'troy', 'look', 'nature', 'war', 'politics', 'How', 'macro', 'micro', 'How', 'small', 'events', 'trigger', 'big', 'ones', 'How', 'ordinary', 'people', 'can', 'play', 'part', 'larger', 'life', 'stories', 'how', 'history', 'out', 'similar', 'stories', 'again', 'again', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'message', 'underlying', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'unfinished', 'ideas', 'holes', 'troy', 'never', 'get', 'filled', 'end', 'feels', 'rushed', 'thrown', 'together', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'made', 'up', 'truly', 'GREAT', 'scenes', 'Such', 'when', 'Greek', 'fleet', 'apears', 'horizons', 'Troy', 'Bells', 'are', 'sounded', 'characters', 'react', 'when', 'look', 'out', 'see', 'horizon', 'clouded', 'enemy', 'ships', 'scene', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'amazed', 'me.All', 'things', 'considered', 'found', 'Troy', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'analysis', 'how', 'world', 'how', 'greed', 'few', 'culminates', 'suffering', 'many', 'wasnt', 'as', 'powerful', 'gladiator', 'going', 'have', 'broader', 'appeal', 'LOTR', 'not', 'kinda', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'genre', 'fact', 'Brave', 'Heart', 'troy', 'first', 'movie', 'while', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'class', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

What came out was a relatively basic war movie where computer armies fight it out and the script and the story were kept relatively simple. Of course, leave it to Hollywood to reduced a ten year siege into two months!!! Brad Pitts actually is the center of this movie, playing the ultimate warrior but he seem slightly miscast. I think much of the problem lies in the fact that there seem to be so little characterization in all characters, just your basic two-dimensional cardboard folks with only their base nature as a reference.For the production values, I thought the city of Troy was superbly well done with computer graphics. The men of Troy was well costumed while the Greeks looked like they looted every Hollywood warehouses to get their outfits. Some looke like they were last used in the Passion of the Christ movie. I thought they did the Trojan Horse very well. It really did look like something made from scratch and that was very effective.Diane Kruger plays Helen of Troy, the beauty that ""launched a thousand ships"" so to speak. There's a nice photo of her in the May issue of Premiere which suggest that she may be capable of launching a thousand ships after her.Overall, entertaining but not very deep movie.

He brought real authority and intensity to the role.  After awhile, it was east to forget he was Brad Pitt.  Even his voice seemed deeper and more commanding than usual. And he looked like... well, a Greek god.  This was Pitt's movie all the way.Eric Bana was his usual mopey-dopey Hulk-self, a spectacularly untalented actor with a peculiar regional Australian accent that made him sound ridiculous trying to emote with the likes of Peter O'Toole and even Brad Pitt.  Orlando Bloom looked pretty, but was relegated to a role that teetered inexplicably between wimp and hero, more the former than the latter.  And Diane Kruger as Helen was about as vapid as they come.  Peter O' Toole was impressive even if he did chew a little scenery from time to time.  The girl who played Pitt's ""love slave"" was unattractive both in visage and performance.Despite the defects, however, the story was meaty and engrossing.  It held my full attention for 3 hours. I don't care that it wasn't faithful to The Illiad and I think reviewers who harp on that are being as silly as those who lambasted ""The Alamo"" because they disagreed with some of its interpretation of history.  These are only movies, not historic or mythological reenactments, and you need to judge them on their own merits as movies.The battle scenes were the most spectacular and well-choreographed that I've ever seen.

(Okay, and maybe the ones with Helen of Troy, that rarest of the rare--a strawberry blonde Greek with blue eyes to boot).  Pitt is so out of his element here, it's almost funny.  He looks like a male model at a monster truck rally. I especially liked how quickly he cleans up from one moment to the next, and not just from one scene to the next.  It's almost uncanny.  Brad, do more films like 12 Monkeys and Fight Club.Brian Cox is the standout, in terms of performances.  He plays a lovely old King, a greedy, bloodthirsty, and self-aggrandizing son-of-a-bitch who'd send 10,000 men to their doom just to get a little more power.  Cox gives him just enough growl, just enough macho, and just enough decay to pull it off.  And, speaking of decay, don't be surprised if Peter O'Toole makes the obituaries in this year.  He looks just about finished, and his performance looked like it was squeezed out of him.  (In one scene, with Pitt, O'Toole's eyes are half-focused, like he's not even seeing Pitt.  Sad, really.  I'm quite convinced it was no act.)I gave this bombastic spectacle three stars simply because the battle scenes are nice, and the ultimate slugfest between Achilles and Hector was engaging.  I found myself shifting in my seat in response to the blows they traded.  Nicely done.  Hopefully, most know the story.  The ending is a bit of a downer, but I suppose it's nice that Hollywood didn't have a choice about it.",3,"Fun.  But Brad Pitt?

852261,A1B05INWIDZ74O,B0002Z0EXQ,M. A. Ramos,"[3, 4]","Troy is a movie worth watching. Eric Bana does a great job on playing Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is showed as a kind and decent man that loves his family and country. And with his performance, you will believe it. Peter O'Toole was a natural choice for playing Priam, King of Troy. The movie is centered around Achilles, Brad pits character. And he plays him well for the way the movie is written. He is shown as a self-centered man that fights for his own reasons, and does not care for the fate of Greace or their kings. What is important to Achilles, is that his name go down in history as great.Pitt obviously did a lot of work to get in shape and learn the great choreography of the fights. Achilles fight scene with Hector is the real star of this movie. It is a very exciting fight, starting with his moving stride across the sand as he starts the attack. Pitt does makes us feel that Achillies is the greatest warrior on that battlefield.Priam had negotiated a peace between Troy and Sparta's King Menelaus, played by Brendan Gleeson. But this peace is broken when Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, convinces Helen, played by Diane Kruger, to run away with him to Troy. The movie shows that Priam and Hector know that what Paris did was wrong, and yet they will risk the safety of Troy to keep Helen.Seeing the large Greek army array itself before Troy is impressive. And the large battle scenes are exciting. Espcially when they try to show some of the manuevers in close ups. The rest seems to just be computer animation for the large scenes. Extras must cost too mch no a days. But still fun to watch.The film is not true to the epic poem. But then, what movie is true to the written medium. You can not show all the true dynamics of the poem. After all the war lasted ten years. And the fact tha tthe real reason for the Greek alliance was not political as the movie shows, but it was rather a part of an oath sworn by all the princes who were suitors for Helen. And the film does take liberty not only with when certin people died during the war, like Achilles himself, but as to who even actually died. Forgetting all that, I loved this move for entertainment, but not as a history lesson.",5,Exciting movie to watch....,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2205,"['Troy', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Hector', 'Prince', 'Troy', 'Hector', 'showed', 'kind', 'decent', 'man', 'family', 'country', 'performance', 'will', 'believe', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'natural', 'choice', 'playing', 'Priam', 'King', 'Troy', 'movie', 'centered', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'character', 'well', 'way', 'movie', 'written', 'shown', 'self-centered', 'man', 'own', 'reasons', 'not', 'care', 'fate', 'Greace', 'kings', 'What', 'important', 'Achilles', 'name', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'great.Pitt', 'obviously', 'did', 'lot', 'work', 'get', 'shape', 'learn', 'great', 'choreography', 'fights', 'Achilles', 'fight', 'scene', 'Hector', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'very', 'exciting', 'fight', 'starting', 'moving', 'stride', 'sand', 'attack', 'Pitt', 'feel', 'Achillies', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'battlefield.Priam', 'had', 'negotiated', 'peace', 'Troy', 'Sparta', 'King', 'Menelaus', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'peace', 'broken', 'when', 'Paris', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Helen', 'played', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'run', 'away', 'Troy', 'movie', 'Priam', 'Hector', 'know', 'what', 'Paris', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'yet', 'will', 'risk', 'safety', 'Troy', 'keep', 'Helen.Seeing', 'large', 'Greek', 'army', 'array', 'Troy', 'impressive', 'large', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'Espcially', 'when', 'try', 'show', 'manuevers', 'close', 'ups', 'rest', 'just', 'be', 'computer', 'animation', 'large', 'scenes', 'Extras', 'must', 'cost', 'too', 'mch', 'days', 'still', 'watch.The', 'film', 'not', 'true', 'epic', 'poem', 'then', 'what', 'movie', 'true', 'written', 'medium', 'can', 'not', 'show', 'true', 'dynamics', 'poem', 'war', 'lasted', 'ten', 'years', 'fact', 'tthe', 'real', 'reason', 'Greek', 'alliance', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'part', 'oath', 'sworn', 'princes', 'who', 'were', 'suitors', 'Helen', 'film', 'take', 'liberty', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'certin', 'people', 'died', 'war', 'Achilles', 'who', 'even', 'actually', 'died', 'Forgetting', 'loved', 'move', 'entertainment', 'not', 'history', 'lesson']",N/A
852262,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B0002Z0EXQ,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[4, 6]","I am a Greek mythology addict and have been since childhood. To say that I was anxiously anticipating this film is a major understatement.  Not only is it a story that has endured through many centuries but it also has the star wattage of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean - actors that I greatly admire.With all the baggage that came along with the coming of this film, I expected to be disappointed. As the credits rolled, however, I found myself extremely satisfied with the outcome of the film.  There were some shortcomings, to be sure: some important plot points were changed (who lived vs who died, who killed whom, the 10 year war made to look like it only lasted 2 weeks), the ending was somewhat ""hollywood-ized"" and some of the dialogue was clunky (the romantic scenes, in particular).  But the positives more than outweighed the negatives: the impressive battle scenes (second only to ""The Lord of the Rings""), amazingly good-looking and talented cast (men and women alike), almost flawless visual effects, sumptious sets and cinematography, high production values, and the overall effort by the cast and crew to make this film as faithful to Homer's vision as possible while making it resonate to modern audiences.Greek mythology enthusiasts, for instance, will appreciate the mythological traditions and customs sprinkled throughout the film: the placing of coins on the deceased person's eyes to help them on their voyage to the underworld, burning a dead person's body in a pyre, the influence of the Gods in their daily lives, the practice of making sacrifices to the Gods, the temples and many statues of the Gods shown throughout the film, and the funeral games.A film wouldn't work, of course, if the story doesn't draw audiences in and Homer has not earned his reputation as one of the greatest storytellers of all time for nothing.  The Trojan War is one of the greatest stories ever told - a tale of greed, ambition, love, glory and courage.  Apart from the story, credit should also be given to its talented actors and director Wolfgang Petersen.  Brad Pitt is the physical embodiment of Achilles - the perfect warrior.  He moves with the grace of a gazelle, looks like a Greek god and fights like a lion.  Eric Bana is flawless as the honorable, brave and heroic Hector (my favorite character in ""The Iliad"" and in the film). Orlando Bloom fits well into his role of the immature, selfish and naive Paris (the anti-Legolas).  Diane Kruger is beautiful and luminous (if not rather placid) as Helen.  Peter O'Toole is heartwrenching as the noble yet  misguided King Priam of Troy.  Saffron Burrows is sympathetic as Hector's wife Andromache.  I could go on and on.  In a film filled with great actors, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger are actually the weakest link.  The `love scenes' somewhat pale in comparison to the powerful battle scenes and hand-to-hand combats (Hector vs Achilles is like watching Batman vs Superman in action).  I was most impressed by Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole.  The scene between King Priam and Achilles made me cry and Hector was the one character that I truly empathized with.  Finally, Eric Bana (""Black Hawk Down,"" ""The Hulk"") has been given a role where he can shine.  I hope for great things for this handsome, talented and charismatic Australian actor.Many films have been made on the Greek heroes and myths, and particularly the Trojan War, in the past (""Clash of the Titans,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" ""Helen of Troy,"" to name a few).  ""Troy"" is, by far, the best and most impressive.  The gods (excepting Thetis) may not be present in this film but their influence and power is certainly felt.  Instead of ""Clash of the Titans"" you get a film that is more akin to the realism and historical feel of ""Gladiator.""If you are a fan of classical mythology or enjoy epics like ""Gladiator,"" ""Braveheart"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" then this film is for you.  It is - to date - the must-see film of 2004.  And even if classical mythology seems all greek to you, this film is well worth seeing if only for its spectacular battle scenes, intimate moments and pleasing ""eye candy.""",5,The Best Film of 2004 to date.......superb!,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,4149,"['am', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'addict', 'have', 'been', 'childhood', 'say', 'was', 'anxiously', 'anticipating', 'film', 'major', 'understatement', 'Not', 'only', 'story', 'endured', 'many', 'centuries', 'also', 'star', 'wattage', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'actors', 'greatly', 'admire.With', 'baggage', 'came', 'along', 'coming', 'film', 'expected', 'be', 'disappointed', 'credits', 'rolled', 'however', 'found', 'extremely', 'satisfied', 'outcome', 'film', 'were', 'shortcomings', 'be', 'sure', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'changed', 'who', 'lived', 'vs', 'who', 'died', 'who', 'killed', 'whom', '10', 'year', 'war', 'made', 'look', 'only', 'lasted', '2', 'weeks', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hollywood-ized', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clunky', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'particular', 'positives', 'more', 'outweighed', 'negatives', 'impressive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'second', 'only', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'amazingly', 'good-looking', 'talented', 'cast', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'almost', 'flawless', 'visual', 'effects', 'sumptious', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'overall', 'effort', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'film', 'faithful', 'Homer', 'vision', 'possible', 'making', 'resonate', 'modern', 'audiences.Greek', 'mythology', 'enthusiasts', 'instance', 'will', 'appreciate', 'mythological', 'traditions', 'customs', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'placing', 'coins', 'deceased', 'person', 'eyes', 'help', 'voyage', 'underworld', 'burning', 'dead', 'person', 'body', 'pyre', 'influence', 'Gods', 'daily', 'lives', 'practice', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'Gods', 'temples', 'many', 'statues', 'Gods', 'shown', 'film', 'funeral', 'games.A', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'course', 'story', ""n't"", 'draw', 'audiences', 'Homer', 'not', 'earned', 'reputation', 'one', 'greatest', 'storytellers', 'time', 'nothing', 'Trojan', 'War', 'one', 'greatest', 'stories', 'ever', 'told', 'tale', 'greed', 'ambition', 'love', 'glory', 'courage', 'Apart', 'story', 'credit', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'talented', 'actors', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'physical', 'embodiment', 'Achilles', 'perfect', 'warrior', 'grace', 'gazelle', 'Greek', 'god', 'fights', 'lion', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'flawless', 'honorable', 'brave', 'heroic', 'Hector', 'favorite', 'character', 'Iliad', 'film', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'well', 'role', 'immature', 'selfish', 'naive', 'Paris', 'anti-Legolas', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'beautiful', 'luminous', 'not', 'rather', 'placid', 'Helen', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'heartwrenching', 'noble', 'yet', 'misguided', 'King', 'Priam', 'Troy', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'sympathetic', 'Hector', 'wife', 'Andromache', 'could', 'go', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'actors', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'are', 'actually', 'weakest', 'link', 'love', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'pale', 'comparison', 'powerful', 'battle', 'scenes', 'hand-to-hand', 'combats', 'Hector', 'vs', 'Achilles', 'watching', 'Batman', 'vs', 'Superman', 'action', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'scene', 'King', 'Priam', 'Achilles', 'made', 'cry', 'Hector', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'truly', 'empathized', 'Finally', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Hulk', 'been', 'given', 'role', 'where', 'can', 'shine', 'hope', 'great', 'things', 'handsome', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'Australian', 'actor.Many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Greek', 'heroes', 'myths', 'particularly', 'Trojan', 'War', 'past', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'name', 'few', 'Troy', 'far', 'best', 'most', 'impressive', 'gods', 'excepting', 'Thetis', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'present', 'film', 'influence', 'power', 'certainly', 'felt', 'Instead', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'get', 'film', 'more', 'akin', 'realism', 'historical', 'feel', 'Gladiator', 'are', 'fan', 'classical', 'mythology', 'enjoy', 'epics', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'then', 'film', 'date', 'must-see', 'film', '2004', 'even', 'classical', 'mythology', 'greek', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'scenes', 'intimate', 'moments', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'candy']",N/A
852263,A26F5B12T242LL,B0002Z0EXQ,"Margaret P. ""mhp2027""","[1, 3]","""Troy"" was a fun action flick that focused on Achilles.  His personality was softened, and he has a romance (that being essential to modern war-movies).  On the whole, the plot was true to the theme ""the fall of Troy"".  Many different people were well developped.  The fight between Achilles and Hector is the best done fight I've ever seen in a movie -- truly, the whole thing is worth seeing just for that.  Helene appears beautiful, just as she ought.  The director did an excellent job, and no expense was spared on the sets.  To my fellow ladies, let me say that there are plenty of handsome young men to admire.  All told, I can sympathise with those of you who loved this movie.However.  ""Troy"" was long, a bit slow, and went to rediculous extremes to avoid nudity.  The script writers took one of the greatest tragedies ever written and turned it into a decent war movie with an ending that was almost happy.  What is the point in seeing a Greek tragedy without the tragedy?  In my opinion, way too much care was taken not to offend the viewer's sensibilities, thus loosing the essiantial flavor.  Also, the romance between Helene and Paris was too bland -- this is supposed to be one of history's most famous romances, but the actors didn't do a convincing job of acting passionately in love.  For example, Helene's distress over her marriage and the war to get her back were all well portrayed, but she didn't appear affectionate toward Paris.So, in summary, I enjoyed ""Troy"" and would recommend this movie to you, but personally I wanted something slightly different.",3,Not the Iliad; but good in its own right,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,1578,"['Troy', 'was', 'fun', 'action', 'flick', 'focused', 'Achilles', 'personality', 'was', 'softened', 'romance', 'being', 'essential', 'modern', 'war-movies', 'whole', 'plot', 'was', 'true', 'theme', 'fall', 'Troy', 'Many', 'different', 'people', 'were', 'well', 'developped', 'fight', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'best', 'done', 'fight', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'truly', 'whole', 'thing', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'Helene', 'beautiful', 'just', 'ought', 'director', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'sets', 'fellow', 'ladies', 'let', 'say', 'are', 'plenty', 'handsome', 'young', 'men', 'admire', 'told', 'can', 'sympathise', 'who', 'loved', 'movie.However', 'Troy', 'was', 'long', 'bit', 'slow', 'went', 'rediculous', 'extremes', 'avoid', 'nudity', 'script', 'writers', 'took', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'ever', 'written', 'turned', 'decent', 'war', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'almost', 'happy', 'What', 'point', 'seeing', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'opinion', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'not', 'offend', 'viewer', 'sensibilities', 'thus', 'loosing', 'essiantial', 'flavor', 'Also', 'romance', 'Helene', 'Paris', 'was', 'too', 'bland', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'famous', 'romances', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'convincing', 'job', 'acting', 'passionately', 'love', 'example', 'Helene', 'distress', 'marriage', 'war', 'get', 'back', 'were', 'well', 'portrayed', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'affectionate', 'Paris.So', 'summary', 'enjoyed', 'Troy', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'personally', 'wanted', 'something', 'slightly', 'different']",N/A

852267,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0002Z0EXQ,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Movies these days are won or lost on the hype that precedes them. Not only that, but after those expectations are developed, the film maker must follow through for that movie to have any staying power which results in it's making any money at the box office. So often we are built up to believe one thing only to be disappointed once we sit down and the lights go dim. Such is not the case with TROY.Many years ago the sword and sandal movies were a staple in Hollywood. They reached a grand scale with movies like BEN-HUR and bottomed out with others like HERCULES IN NEW YORK. But these films were movies that people went to see and either loved or hated. Times changed and with the interest in more real storied that developed in the late sixties and early seventies, it seemed none were made. The release and success of GLADIATOR changed that. And as much as I enjoyed that film, I liked this one even more.For those who don't know the story or have never read the Iliad (include me in that category), it revolves around the attempts of Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to bring together all of the states of Greece under his rule. He is out to establish an empire and is on the verge of doing just that. The film opens with a battle between his army and that of Thessaly about to occur. A challenge is made and they place their best man against his to cut down on casualties, winner takes all. His challenger is Achilles (Brad Pitt), the fiercest warrior ever known. The battle takes mere seconds and the character of Achilles is established for all to see.The scene shifts to Sparta where the brother of Agamemnon and king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleason) has just signed a peace treaty with Troy and its representatives Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). As a feast ensues, Menelaus wife Helen (Diane Kruger) leaves to her room, followed by Paris. The two have been together since his arrival and now she plans to run off with him. This sets in motion the war that is to be waged as Menelaus attempts to regain his wife while Agamemnon uses the excuse to lead his army into battle to win Troy.Leading a fleet of a thousand ships, Agamemnon must also swallow his pride for a moment. He and Achilles never see eye to eye and have even come close to battle themselves. But with the help of Odysseus (Sean Bean) he recruits Achilles to be a part of this force setting out for Troy.It is not for the sake of Agamemnon that Achilles fights. Nor is it for the honor of Menelaus or to rescue his wife. Achilles fights for glory and for honor. He fights so that his name might live on long after he has departed Earth. A vision by his mother Thetis (Julie Christie) tells him this will happen, but that he will never return to her.The ships sail and the Trojans prepare for war. Their walls have never been breached and they are confidant that no matter who attacks, they will be victorious. King Priam (Peter O'Toole) backs his son Paris' and his love for Helen. War is coming their way and they are as prepared as they can be to battle this incredible army.There you have it, the set up for a grand and glorious movie about war. And in reading just that much, you might expect that it deals only with the victories and failures of the men involved. But there is so much more going on in this film. And amazingly enough, it never presents war as a bad thing or a good thing. It shows it for what it really is, a clash of two parties that yields both good and bad.It shows the honor between men fighting together in a solid unit as one, using tactics instead of brute strength to win a battle. It shows men willing to lay down their lives for something they believe in, for a leader that commands them to do so.At the same time, it shows a leader who is blinded by his own ego, men dying due to poor leadership and the fact that death is everlasting and not a grand as the cry before battle might make it out to be. Some men will walk away as heroes to be spoken of from that day forward. Others will become nothing more than fuel for funeral pyres.The mix of these ideas back and forth makes this movie more real than most and less political than many would assume we will find in this day and age.The battles are well made, presenting not only the best that CGI has to offer in showing thousands involved in combat, but the up close fighting is more real than most seen in some time. The hand to hand combat, the archers' arrows landing in the most gruesome ways, the use of anything on hand to become a weapon make it all seem real.The acting is stupendous with Brad Pitt taking the lead. Pitt has done some great films in the past and has shown that he is not just another pretty face. But this film uses everything from his looks to his physical abilities to form a character that the audience comes to sympathize with as well as fear.Eric Bana also excels as Hector. His character is also a warrior to be reckoned with but one with more heart, with more at stake, with more foresight to see what can become of this whole mess. While Achilles fights for glory, Hector fights to protect his land and his family, to protect that which he loves most. And Bana portrays this with an insight rarely seen or shown in most actors these days.Perhaps the weakest link in the entire film is a character that should be center stage, Paris as played by Orlando Bloom. While I thought him fantastic in the LORD OF THE RINGS films, Bloom has yet to make an impression on me since. His portrayal of Paris here is as if he were a twit and a coward, a man who thinks only of himself and his pleasures at the expense of everything and everyone else. If this was who he was then Bloom does a better job than I give him credit for. I still see him as only a simpering wimp here and not the hottest actor working today.The directing is amazing with Wolfgang Peterson turning in another stupendous job. He uses everything he can at his disposal to get the tale put onscreen in its entirety. Scenes of battle mingle with scenes of tenderness, both presented as real and as a part of the story that when brought together tell the entire tale.Hollywood has for years forsaken the genre of epic in an attempt to make more money on smaller films. Battling against everything from video games to the internet, it has gone back to draw viewers into seats once more. If they can continue to produce films like this they will continue to prosper. TROY is a film that fulfilled all of my expectations, though to be honest they were not high to begin with. It is perhaps one of the best films I have seen in some time.",5,EPICS CAN STILL BE MADE,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,6597,"['Movies', 'days', 'are', 'won', 'lost', 'hype', 'Not', 'only',

The film makers were obviously more concerned with mass battle scenes and special effects than the development of the characters and the minor matter of remaining true to 'The Iliad'doesn't come into it.The script is downright bad. Two choice quotes sum it up:- 'Immortality awaits you. Take it!' 'Of all the Warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the worst.'This being so, I couldn't blame the actors in having difficulty in imparting humanity to such cardboard characters:- There's the 'Invincible Warrior Who Needs a Good Woman to Get in Touch with His Emotions', the 'Meglomaniac King' the 'Nice Fiesty Girl' and the 'Caddish Young Prince Who Must Grow Up'. You get the general idea...I suppose that was why in general, the acting was wooden, though it varied. Helen is more impressive later on and always lovely to look at and Peter O'Toole as King Priam and Sean Bean as Odysseus are brilliant, while Hector, Andromache and the less-than-heroic Paris are good. I thought the part where Helen comforts Paris after his cowardice in the battle with Menelaus was sweet.I assume that Brad Pitt's sullen, impassive-faced Achilles was script and director driven. He's generally a good actor, and I know he read 'The Iliad' before acting in this.Briesis is supposed to be brave, independent minded and spiritual, but somehow comes across as insipid. There is something tediously inevitable about the love affair between her and Achilles; her 'spirited' defence,then her surrender. The poor girl goes on to develop a violent case of 'Stockholm Syndrome'. For anyone interested, I go into this in more detail in my review on the F Word but I don't think I am allowed to quote the link under the Amazon guidelines.I think it was because of the abusive-relationship-aspect that meant that the last scene between these lovers,which should be touching, left me dry-eyed.In fact, Brad Pitt's impassive face throughout was so unstimulating that I found my attention wandering from the action to questions such as:- Whether his tan was that spray-on stuff that body builders use to accentuate their muscles? Why his skin looked so oddly rubbery? Why he alone, of all the warriers, was smothered in oil - possibly filched from Hector and Andromache's delightful baby?Also, and quite unreasonably, I didn't find him a believable Achilles with that tiny nose of his - I couldn't believe in an Achilles without one of those lovely long Greek noses he is always depicted as having in ancient vase paintings, etc. That was unfair of me, as nobody else had such a nose, so why hold it against Brad PItt?This is good to have a laugh over with a group of friends, but if you want a serious modern take on The Iliad, look elsewhere...",2,Tacky and Terrible with a Generous Helping of Stockholm Syndrome,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2754,"['was', 'so', 'absurd', 'kept', 'laughing', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'obviously', 'more', 'concerned', 'mass', 'battle', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'development', 'characters', 'minor', 'matter', 'remaining', 'true', ""'The"", ""Iliad'does"", ""n't"", 'come', 'it.The', 'script', 'downright', 'bad', 'Two', 'choice', 'quotes', 'sum', 'up', ""'Immortality"", 'Take', ""'Of"", 'Warlords', 'loved', 'gods', 'hate', 'worst', ""'This"", 'being', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'having', 'difficulty', 'imparting', 'humanity', 'such', 'cardboard', 'characters', ""'Invincible"", 'Warrior', 'Who', 'Good', 'Woman', 'Get', 'Touch', 'Emotions', ""'Meglomaniac"", 'King', ""'Nice"", 'Fiesty', 'Girl', ""'Caddish"", 'Young', 'Prince', 'Who', 'Must', 'Grow', 'Up', 'get', 'general', 'idea', 'suppose', 'was', 'why', 'general', 'acting', 'was', 'wooden', 'varied', 'Helen', 'more', 'impressive', 'later', 'always', 'lovely', 'look', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'King', 'Priam', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Hector', 'Andromache', 'less-than-heroic', 'Paris', 'are', 'good', 'thought', 'part', 'where', 'Helen', 'Paris', 'cowardice', 'battle', 'Menelaus', 'was', 'sweet.I', 'assume', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'sullen', 'impassive-faced', 'Achilles', 'was', 'script', 'director', 'driven', 'generally', 'good', 'actor', 'know', 'read', 'Iliad', 'acting', 'this.Briesis', 'supposed', 'be', 'brave', 'independent', 'minded', 'spiritual', 'somehow', 'across', 'insipid', 'something', 'tediously', 'inevitable', 'love', 'affair', 'Achilles', ""'spirited"", 'defence', 'then', 'surrender', 'poor', 'girl', 'develop', 'violent', 'case', ""'Stockholm"", 'Syndrome', 'anyone', 'interested', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'review', 'F', 'Word', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'am', 'allowed', 'quote', 'link', 'Amazon', 'guidelines.I', 'think', 'was', 'abusive-relationship-aspect', 'meant', 'last', 'scene', 'lovers', 'should', 'be', 'touching', 'left', 'dry-eyed.In', 'fact', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'impassive', 'face', 'was', 'so', 'unstimulating', 'found', 'attention', 'wandering', 'action', 'questions', 'such', 'tan', 'was', 'spray-on', 'stuff', 'body', 'builders', 'use', 'accentuate', 'muscles', 'Why', 'skin', 'looked', 'so', 'oddly', 'rubbery', 'Why', 'alone', 'warriers', 'was', 'smothered', 'oil', 'possibly', 'filched', 'Hector', 'Andromache', 'delightful', 'baby', 'Also', 'quite', 'unreasonably', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'believable', 'Achilles', 'tiny', 'nose', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Achilles', 'one', 'lovely', 'long', 'Greek', 'noses', 'always', 'depicted', 'having', 'ancient', 'vase', 'paintings', 'etc', 'was', 'unfair', 'nobody', 'else', 'had', 'such', 'nose', 'so', 'why', 'hold', 'Brad', 'PItt', 'good', 'have', 'laugh', 'group', 'friends', 'want', 'serious', 'modern', 'take', 'Iliad', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

Well the movie is big and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.First of all let me say that I have never read the Illiad. I have read the Odyessey and I enjoyed it a lot. From what I've been told of people the movie is not very acurate at all. However, I did enjoy it despite it's flaws in the story.I think by now everybody has heard the plot to the movie. Paris(Bloom) runs off with Helen(Kruger) because they are in love and she no longer wants to stay with her husband Menelaus the King of Sparta. Agnaemenon the head King of Greece looks at this as a chance to strike against the one kingdom that can face up to him in Troy.War is set and the Greeks must get the greatest warrior to fight for them. They get Achilles(Pitt)to fight for them. Agnaemenon is weary of this because Achilles doesn't worship him like the rest do, but he knows he needs him to win. They then sail off to Troy to get Helen and to conquer them.The city of Troy is not scared. King Priam(O'Toole) is not worried at all because of the high walls around his city, the sun god Apollo, and most of all because of his son Hector(Bana). The stage for the epic war is set and the battle is on.First of all let me say that I loved Brad Pitt in the movie. A lot of the critics have hammered him saying he didn't display the vainess and godlike qualities that Achillies displayed in the book. They must not have watched the same movie as I did. This was the most cocky and arrogant character Pitt has played to date. His vanity is incredible in the film. He also bulked up real big. He put on over 20lbs and he's cut to the bone.Eric Bana was great at Hector. Like Pitt he really bulked up as well. He does the best acting job in the film. He displays Hectors emotions perfectly. When he's going to fight Achillies he really does look like he knows he's the lamb going to the slaughter. His acting is superb and his performance is just awesome. He won't win an acadamey award, but you will enjoy it.Hector and Achillies are the two main characters in the film. The whole movie really does focus on the battle between the two of them and how much there respective people await on them.The sets in the movie are fantastic. They did a great job building the city of Troy. Everything looks authentic to the time period. It's about the only thing that is accurate to it's time.Like I said the movie is not accurate to Homers poem at all. It is however a great action film. If you look past those flaws and don't spend your time ripping the movie for it's flaws you really wil enjoy a well made action film.

It has all the right moves in the epic area - great battles, great sets, etc. On the human scale, it succeeds barely at all. Still, it has an overall grandeur and sweep that is both entertaining and interesting. It succeeds in spite of its flaws.In the great epics - from ""The Ten Commandments"" to ""Spartacus"" to ""Gladiator"" - there is a balance between great battles for great causes and the love between a man and a woman.""Troy"" doesn't succeed on the human level. The legend is that the Greek Paris [Orlando Bloom] took Helen of Troy [Diane Kruger] away from her husband, the King [Brian Cox], which caused the Trojan War. But nothing in the relationship between Paris and Troy suggests a great passion that would cause a great war.

852273,A1TJNC96AF73XJ,B0002Z0EXQ,Maxwell,"[5, 9]","I was looking forward to this movie for awhile, so I became pretty worried that it would not live up to my expectations after I saw that the initial reviews were generally negative.  Well, I just saw the film and I'm happy to say that as usual, the critics know nothing.  Sometimes I feel that moviegoers and critics are becoming so jaded that they just don't let themselves sit back and enjoy a movie anymore.  The only thing Troy lacks is originality.  It is an epic Hollywood drama about love and war, enhanced by a cast of famous beautiful actors and CGI armies.  Yep, its all been done before.  Nevertheless, Troy takes the formula and executes it notably well.  Those who are tired of seeing CGI armies and famous stars waving swords around should stay home.  But fans of the genre will not be disappointed.  If I had to compare Troy to other similar epics of recent time, I would say that it rises far above the hollow and pretentious ""The Last Samurai"" and is every bit as good if not better than ""Gladiator"" and ""Lord of the Rings"".Troy succeeds mainly because inspite of all the special effects pageantry and CGI army battles, at its heart it is still a very character driven story.  The personalities of Achilles, Hector, Priam, Agamemnon, and Odysseus stand out to make this portrayal of the Trojan War legend feel very real.  Furthermore, the film makes the right choice of not taking any sides.  Neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are portrayed as completely righteous or completely evil.  The only exception to this would be King Agamemnon.  He's pretty much the only one who's totally rotten.  For the rest of the charcters, we see their strengths and their weaknesses.  The most decent character is Hector, but he is still not free of questionable decisions and mistakes.  He exudes the most sympathy because he is a good and honorable man, forced to make hard decisions by circumstances beyond his control.  Priam is a noble king, but his pride and overconfidence are at least partially responsible for Troy's fall.  We can sympathize with Menelaus as a well intentioned king who was betrayed by his wife.  But at the same time, we can see why Helen left him.  Helen and Paris are not given nearly as much attention in the film as one might expect, but we do see enough of Paris to understand that he is romantic and loving, but also young and foolish.  Helen is disappointing, as she doesn't do much in the film other than start a war and then stand around looking pretty.  And then there's Achilles.  If Hector is the most honorable character, Achilles is still by far the most interesting.I would defend Brad Pitt against all the critics who have blasted his performance.  I felt that he portrayed Achilles with all the charisma, arrogance, and intensity that the character deserved.  His only fault is that he may look too pretty to be the meanest and toughest SOB among all the Greeks.  But he quickly rises above that by bringing a lot of emotion and power to his character.  He also deserves a lot of credit for pulling off the physical demands of Achilles so adeptly.  It is obvious that he trained himself intensely for the role.  His movements in combat are very fluid and practiced.  Some actors can only be made to look deadly with the help of up close camera angles and quick shots.  But in Troy, there are moments when the camera pulls back and remains steady, allowing us to see every movement the actors make.  It is here where we can admire Pitt's honed athleticism and precision.  His skillful execution in combat remove all doubts that he is a worthy Achilles.I also don't agree with complaints about the film's dialogue being hokey.  I felt that it was eloquently delivered, with plenty of clever moments.  If it seems over the top and dramatic at times, you have to remember that this movie is based on a classic epic poem.  Viewed in that context, the dialogue is no more hokey than Shakespeare (not to compare David Benioff to Shakespeare).  The underlying themes revealed in much of the dialogue are very heartfelt and strong.  The foundations of the classic story of Troy resonate through this film.  That being said, those expecting a straight retelling of the Troy story will be disappointed.  This is not a faithful film translation of Homer's account.  It is instead a clever revision of the story that takes away the influence of gods and humanizes the characters (particularly Achilles) more.  Despite this departure from the source material, it is still a worthy version of the classic story.  It does justice to many of the original story's core elements while going in other directions as well.The film does seem to lose some steam towards the end.  Despite the movie's three hour length, the fall of troy seems a bit rushed, and the final resolution feels unsatisfying.  But this is a pretty minor shortcoming to an otherwise stellar film.  I highly recommend Troy to anyone looking for a sweeping character driven epic, complete with CGI armies and intense action.",5,The critics are wrong...this is a great epic!,1084492800,"05 14,

Some of the lines are both written and delivered horribly, even by normally competent actors like Brad Pitt. I'm not extremely familiar with the story of The Iliad, so I can't really comment on all the changes to the plot. I know that the role of the Greek gods was almost completely excised, however, and thus Troy is a demythologization of Homer (in the same way that The Thirteenth Warrior is a demythologization of the ""Beowulf"" story). Some people hate this, but I think it works. In a movie version of this story, I would rather see what likely happened in the battle for Troy than Homer's souped-up version that has the gods flying around on the battlefield in their chariots like superheroes. Pitt portrays the man-killer Achilles and his thirst for glory well, but Eric Bana is even better as Hector. The battle between these two heroes and the events that follow are extremely powerful and heart-wrenching. The battle scenes are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but sometimes the cinematography is horrible. My wife noticed this also; needless to say, she is not someone who says the word ""cinematography"" often, so that's really saying something.

852277,A1H9D7UTKW58F8,B0002Z0EXQ,M. Buentello,"[2, 5]","I enjoyed watching this DVD for what it is: a Hollywood version of Ancient History (and also to see the hunks of Brad Pitt and Eric Banna). Although it was very romanticized, it still was an enjoyable flick.I was expecting to see a little more realism in this modern version, but I think the producers want a ticket-guaranteed-formula of a romantic-heroic epic in the traditional sense. You have Brad Pitt in the nude with some chicks (blockbuster guaranteed), romantic drama (Paris and Helen and Achilles and his slave), and war scenes.What I don't understand is how they were afraid to portray Achilles as an homosexual if contemporary society is more open to homosexuality (and Hollywood seems to have been exploiting homosexuality nowadays). It is widely known that ancient Greek young men were expected to carry out homosexual relationships, and in this case, it makes sense that Achilles, who despised this war and its motives, would enter the battle only after going crazy for the death of his beloved Petroclus. I know that the relationship of Achilles and Petroclus is debatable. Some argue that this homosexual relationship was never stated in Homer's work. But I feel that it is important to the plot that Achilles loved Petroclus with deep intensity and that only his death would fill Achilles with immense rage to the point of craziness and would want to enter the war to avenge his lover. To portray Petroclus as an orphaned cousin of Achilles and that Achilles would protect him as a son is understandable too, but where does it say that Petroclus was indeed a cousin of Achilles?Achilles was really disturbed by Petroclus' death, so much that when he killed Hector, he did not respect his corpse and carried him around Petroclus' tomb for 12 days. Only after Achilles' mother asked his son, he returned the body to the Trojans to receive a funeral. This would be further evidence of Achilles' deep love for Petroclus, yet, in this movie, they focus on Achilles' romantic relationship with the Trojan woman as if this was a major feature in the story. As I said, I like verism in a historic movie, but I guess I can understand the producers wanting Brad Pitt (Achilles) to be a true hero and a ladies man.Also, despite the fact that Helen might have been a great part on the motive of this war, I think it was one of many other events that lead to war. Yeah, it's sounds romantic, but politically, really, it has to have more than that. It would have been nice to see a more accurate portrayal of ancient political affairs.I enjoyed though how they did they Trojan horse. I couldn't picture a trojan horse with people in it before. The idea sounded so funny I just couldn't picture it. Good job on this. Also, I REALLY enjoyed watching Hector (played by Eric Banna). Besides being a hunk, great performance, acting, etc. he was to most likable hero to me, and too bad he died too soon in the movie.Achilles, (Brad Pitt) was also accurately portrayed. It is said that Achilles was very arrogant and disrespectful of authority and although these are not likable traits, well, these were true of our beloved hero.All in all, if you are looking into finding an enjoyable way to view history, to just have some sort of idea how the ancient times would look like and to enjoy a romantic and heroic fictional story I would recommend this film, but don't expect to be accurate to history or just to human nature.",3,I like historic movies...but how truthful are they?,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,3419,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Ancient', 'History', 'also', 'see', 'hunks', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Eric', 'Banna', 'was', 'very', 'romanticized', 'still', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'flick.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'realism', 'modern', 'version', 'think', 'producers', 'want', 'ticket-guaranteed-formula', 'romantic-heroic', 'epic', 'traditional', 'sense', 'have', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'nude', 'chicks', 'blockbuster', 'guaranteed', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'Achilles', 'slave', 'war', 'scenes.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'were', 'afraid', 'portray', 'Achilles', 'homosexual', 'contemporary', 'society', 'more', 'open', 'homosexuality', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'been', 'exploiting', 'homosexuality', 'nowadays', 'widely', 'known', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'expected', 'carry', 'out', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'case', 'sense', 'Achilles', 'who', 'despised', 'war', 'motives', 'would', 'enter', 'battle', 'only', 'going', 'crazy', 'death', 'beloved', 'Petroclus', 'know', 'relationship', 'Achilles', 'Petroclus', 'debatable', 'argue', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'was', 'never', 'stated', 'Homer', 'work', 'feel', 'important', 'plot', 'Achilles', 'loved', 'Petroclus', 'deep', 'intensity', 'only', 'death', 'would', 'fill', 'Achilles', 'immense', 'rage', 'point', 'craziness', 'would', 'want', 'enter', 'war', 'avenge', 'lover', 'portray', 'Petroclus', 'orphaned', 'cousin', 'Achilles', 'Achilles', 'would', 'protect', 'son', 'understandable', 'too', 'where', 'say', 'Petroclus', 'was', 'indeed', 'cousin', 'Achilles', 'Achilles', 'was', 'really', 'disturbed', 'Petroclus', 'death', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'killed', 'Hector', 'did', 'not', 'respect', 'corpse', 'carried', 'Petroclus', 'tomb', '12', 'days', 'Only', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'asked', 'son', 'returned', 'body', 'Trojans', 'receive', 'funeral', 'would', 'be', 'further', 'evidence', 'Achilles', 'deep', 'love', 'Petroclus', 'yet', 'movie', 'focus', 'Achilles', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Trojan', 'woman', 'was', 'major', 'feature', 'story', 'said', 'like', 'verism', 'historic', 'movie', 'guess', 'can', 'understand', 'producers', 'wanting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'be', 'true', 'hero', 'ladies', 'man.Also', 'fact', 'Helen', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'part', 'motive', 'war', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'other', 'events', 'lead', 'war', 'Yeah', 'sounds', 'romantic', 'politically', 'really', 'have', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'ancient', 'political', 'affairs.I', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'did', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'trojan', 'horse', 'people', 'idea', 'sounded', 'so', 'funny', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'Good', 'job', 'Also', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Hector', 'played', 'Eric', 'Banna', 'being', 'hunk', 'great', 'performance', 'acting', 'etc', 'was', 'most', 'likable', 'hero', 'too', 'bad', 'died', 'too', 'soon', 'movie.Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'also', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'said', 'Achilles', 'was', 'very', 'arrogant', 'disrespectful', 'authority', 'are', 'not', 'likable', 'traits', 'well', 'were', 'true', 'beloved', 'hero.All', 'are', 'looking', 'finding', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'view', 'history', 'just', 'have', 'sort', 'idea', 'how', 'ancient', 'times', 'would', 'look', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'heroic', 'fictional', 'story', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'accurate', 'history', 'just', 'human', 'nature']",N/A

said to have lasted for ten years, i did not expect the movie to show a battle for that long.the chartures are well drawn out.they are who u expected to be.agamemnon is a warmonger. paris more a lover then a fighter. brad pitt makes a good achilles. angery, love of battle and fame, at odds with agamemnon. the charitures are pretty much the same as in the myths and in the illiad, well for the most part.all the actors are very good in their parts. pitt ie great. bloom, brain cox,bana, sean bean, and all the others are good. the sets are wonderful. you get a real feel of the culture of that time period. the battles are very bloody. well they are in the same vein as the battles in BRAVEHEART. i have one nit pic about the first fight, part of it looked fack but otherwise a good movie.most of the chartures of the myth are intorduced and as i said pretty much the same as you knew them in the myth. a couple of chartures are not readily intorduced. such as ajax. you'll spot him soon enough though. also look out for aeneas at the end. hes carring his father, an old man, just as in the myth. oddly u dont see cassandra or hecuba of troy. but for hecuba see euripedies play HECUBA. for cassandra see the play AGAMEMNON.This movie has all the basic elements of the Illiad (with a few twists)this movie is the Illiad in short hand in a way.here is a break down of the plot of the illiad which the movie uses1 Temple of Apollo ransacked2 Agamemnon and Achilles fight over a woman3 Paris and Menalias fight. the truce that erupts into war (the movie changes the plot in this story line, with one twist.)4 Achilles refuses to help the greeks, even though agamemnon trys to offer him a peace treaty.5 the greek ships are attacked and the battle at the ramparts6 Portroclis fights and dies7 Achilles and Hector fight8 The funueral games for Hectoragain this is the basic format of the Illad which the movie uses.other parts are barrowed from the Oddessy, the Aeniad, and other myths of troy.

With all the publicity though, I'm definitely looking forward to Mr & Mrs Smith!What I found most annoying about this movie, and many other movies similar to it, is how they're all trying to be the next Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad, as I still haven't seen those movies, and at the moment, have no wish to). Also, was it just me, or were the main stars constantly posing?! It got on my nerves after a while!I think I'd probably heard of Troy, Achilles & the Iliad through school, although I can't remember reading it. The whole Achilles myth/legend was very familiar to me - where he can be killed through his heel, after his mum dipped him in something, but held him by his heel.This is a butt-numbing 156 minutes long, and could have easily been shortened, and made it pass quicker. The battle scenes are very cliched, and we've seen them a zillion times before. You don't know which army you want to win - with Braveheart (for example), you knew you wanted the Scots to win. With this, it's very confusing. Look out for Brian Cox (he's in everything!) and James Cosmo (?), who was in Braveheart also. You felt no sympathy for any of the characters - although I must admit Hector (Eric Bana) made me very sad towards the end. (Without ruining it for anyone!) You know something's wrong with the film, when you're laughing at the death scenes, and making up things that the cast are saying (BOO!) as they're lying on the funeral pyre. However, I did love the funeral scenes, especially with the focus on the coins on the eyes, to pay the ferryman - this was a terrific tradition.This film can be liked or hated. With the severe lack of decent eye candy, instead of posing pretty boys, I'm sitting on the fence with this film. It's too long (although I can sit through Titanic perfectly), and it doesn't hold your attention for long enough. I was always looking for an excuse to pause it. It's definitely not something I'd ever watch again.

They were men who knew honor and wanted a lot out of life.  Achilles wanted ever-lasting fame.  Hector wanted his family, his people, and his country kept safe.  Ultimately, these two men came to deathblows.  Hector's brother, Paris, kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, from the Greeks.  This provided all the excuse Agamemnon needed to crush the Trojans and add them to his list of conquered people.  The Greeks sailed to Troy to reclaim their lost queen, but the war lasted a long time and proved more costly than anyone would have believed.  But Achilles and Hector were at the eye of that storm.Brad Pitt stars as Achilles and does a good job in the physical and emotional sense of the character.  Eric Bana plays Hector, and comes across as a noble champion.  The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a director noted for his attention to detail and willingness to get the scene no matter what it takes.TROY is a throwback to old Hollywood style filmmaking.  With a cast of thousands.  Of course, most of them are really computer animation, so the numbers are actually in the hundreds.  But the movie is just BIG.  The HD DVD version features beautiful imagery and Lossless sound that really makes you glad you bought the surround sound system.  The story is so big that even when it finishes two hours and forty-plus minutes later, you scarcely notice the time.  Something is always going on.  Some character is always in trouble (or dying or grieving).I was familiar with the story from high school as well as college, but the two characters never touched me so much before.  Maybe it's because I'm older and realize now how much was truly at stake and how different things might have been.  But I choose to believe it's because the story was present so well, visually as well as emotionally.  The suspense was great, because you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.

And whereas in those films we have the likes of Kirk Douglas, Richard Burton and Tony Curtis, in ""Troy"" we have Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. And it is a toss-up who is more gorgeous and glamorous: Pitt, Bana, Bloom or Kruger. All four are beautifully photographed as to defy description especially since so much of this film is shot as set pieces, tableaux.Wolfgang Petersen directs in such a stodgy and stoic manner that much of the good acting work is lost amidst the sand and sandals mise en scene. We had hoped for a ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" instead we got ""Cleopatra.""Nonetheless, there are a few scenes of uncommon grace: Peter O'Toole (as Priam) begging for the body of his slain son of Achilles (Brad Pitt), Thetis (Julie Christie) pleading with her son (Achilles) to remain uninvolved with the inevitable conflict between the Trojans and the Greeks. But these moments are few and far between.Unfortunately, ""Troy"" is ultimately a lost opportunity to say something important about the world. What it is is a limp flaccid comment on the ancient past: more concerned with surface, rather than interior beauty.""Troy"" goes on way too long for its own good: it could have been cut by at least twenty minutes. But the main problem is one of focus and point-of-view. Yes, these are beautiful people involved with life changing experiences but why should we care? What is it about their experiences that we can embrace now, hundreds of years later? Director Wolfgang Petersen has taken the easy road: he's shown us the glitz and the glam but he's left out his point-of-view. Wolfgang: we need to know how and why we should care beyond why Brad Pitt has forbidden your showing his toes on camera.

852287,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002Z0EXQ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 5]","My wife's a ""fan"" of Brad Pitt (...), so it only made sense that I would inevitably see Troy.  She comes with me to see Kate Beckinsale fight vampires all the time, so I figure we're even.It's easy to categorize Troy as a movie in the vein of the sweeping historical epics like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments.  The musical score swells, lots of extras mill about, and the camera moves slowly over panoramic views. Only in the 21st century, the musical score still swells, digitized extras using the Massive engine (first invented for Lord of the Rings) makes the extras mill about, and the camera moves slowly over computer-generated panoramic views.  For all intents and purposes, the effect is largely the same.It's easier to categorize what Troy is not...Troy is NOT Gladiator. Troy has far too many characters to focus exclusively on one man's revenge.  Unfortunately, Troy tries to do just that in the character of Achilles (Brad Pitt).  It doesn't work, if only because one has difficulty sympathizing with a killing machine.  Even if that killing machine walks around half-naked displaying his tanned washboard abs. Lots of men could empathize with The Spaniard.  There's very few folks to like in Troy.Troy is NOT Helen of Troy.  There were plenty of flaws with Helen of Troy, not the least of which being that if you're going to use the premise that Helen's really worth launching a thousand ships for, she better be incredibly hot.  Helen of Troy's Helen simply didn't have that much allure.  Fortunately, the Helen of this movie (Diane Kruger) is very attractive.  On the other hand, her beauty is largely wasted because this is not about romance.  Where the Iliad played up the star-crossed lovers angle, this movie makes it clear (over and over and OVER) that the war is actually about much less noble aims.  In other words, Helen's just an excuse to start a war that would have happened anyway.  Which is sort of like saying that Moses just sort of made up the Ten Commandments.  I imagine Charlton Heston would have made a much less impressive movie as a result.Troy is NOT Clash of the Titans.  Every mythical or supernatural trace has been eradicated from the script. Achilles isn't invulnerable (""why else would I use a shield?"").  You won't see a bearded Zeus arguing with...well, anybody.Troy is a semi-realistic retelling of an event, with the presumption - one might say, arrogant assumption - that the Iliad is in fact an embellishment of the whole thing.  In transforming it into a simple if somewhat overblown war story, it has parallels to Americas' conflict with Iraq.  A powerful nation attacks a smaller country for construed reasons (Helen), only to find the protracted war to be more costly than expected. Indeed, there's even weapons of mass destruction - flaming balls of straw unleashed on slumbering Greeks.Troy has its moments.  Achilles is a true martial artist and his combat is breathtaking.  Achilles himself is part of the scenery.  Brad Pitt, at 40-years-old, looks like he was sculpted from marble.  He FEELS like a hero of Greek myth.  Eric Bana's furrowed brow lends a tinge of regret to Hector.  And Orlando Bloom is suitably whiny and impetuous as Paris.  Heck, even Sean Bean plays the role of Odysseus, lending his measured tones to a man who has seen so much that he has his own string of movies.Troy's strength is also its weakness.  The familiarity of the characters breeds contempt.  When Paris picks up a bow and fires arrows at Achilles and the hero continues to stump forward as arrow after arrow thuds into his chest, I couldn't help but flash back to Legolas (Orlando Bloom) firing a bow and Boromir (Sean Bean) stumbling to orc archery.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy has not even grown cold...either Troy has an eerily similar parallel or directors are already filming an homage to Peter Jackson.And that's the problem.  Troy feels like a movie made by movie stars about some stuff that happened in the past.  Troy plays fast and loose with history and with the characters, but gives the actors plenty of time to enunciate and emote.  It is truly an actor's movie.  It also not a great movie, in the way Cleopatra isn't a great movie but people still watch it to see the stars.For historical buffs, Troy is a revisionist travesty.  For moviegoers looking for an action flick, Troy's not exciting enough to hold their interest.  For fans of Greek mythology, Troy offers almost nothing at all.  Troy wants to be something entirely different...but nobody ASKED for that kind of movie.  It's almost as if the director felt the actual plot of the Iliad is too juvenile for modern audiences.

Banished are the Greek gods, who are referred to a lot, but never seen.  And that is probably for the best, although that is probably the most noticeable change from the source material.Hector (Bana) and Paris (Bloom) from Troy are on a peaceful mission to Sparta, when Paris falls for the beautiful Helen (Kruger).  Paris takes her back to Troy, enraging her husband Menelaus.  Menelaus enlists the help of his brother, King Agamemnon (Cox), and his army to retrieve her.  Agamemnon sees this as a opportunity to increase his empire, and is more than willing to help, summoning his prized warrior Achilles (Pitt).  Achilles, we find out, will fight for Agamemnon, but only when it suits him.The battle scenes are grand in detail and the special effects mesh seamlessly with the live actors, and one has come to expect in movies these days.  The problem lies more in the characters.  With the exception of Hector, the characters seem rather flat and unlikeable.

I definetly am not at all impressed by Brad Pitt, like all those women fans of his are, after all, we must remember that he does not write the lines he says, so all these intelligent words that come out of his mouth are not actually his.

852297,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002Z0EXQ,mirasreviews,"[2, 4]","""Troy"" is the latest Hollywood effort to bring the epic tale of the Trojan War, which legend places around 1200 B.C., to the screen. Screenwriter David Benioff claims Homer's ""The Iliad"" as inspiration, but ""Troy"" actually incorporates details from several ancient sources, including ""The Odyssey"" and probably the ""Little Iliad"" or ""Sack of Ilion"", both written a little later. ""The Iliad"" only covers a short period of time in the Trojan War, and begins a decade into the conflict. ""Troy"" reduces the war to what seems like only a few weeks, keeps most of ""The Iliad""'s principle characters, but changes some of their actions and motivations.""Troy"" maintains the traditional cause of the Trojan War: While on a diplomatic visit to Sparta, in Greece, young Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with King Menalaus' wife, the lovely Helen (Diane Kruger), who incites the wrath of her husband (Brendan Gleeson) by accompanying Paris back to Troy, across the sea. King Menalaus of Sparta implores his brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), an ambitious and ruthless military leader who has managed to force all of the Greek city-states into a loose confederation under his rule, to raise a Greek army to attack Troy. Agamemnon is only too happy to have an excuse to conquer Troy, but needs Greek's greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) to commit to the war. Achilles hates Agamemnon, but when his friend Odysseus (Sean Bean), the clever King of Ithaca, appeals to his vanity, Achilles cannot refuse the  opportunity for immortality that the great war will bring its heroes. In Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is confident that his city walls will withstand a Greek attack. His eldest son, the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana) is contemptuous of Paris' reckless action, but committed to his family and country all the same. He prepares the army to fight, but fears the worst.Every writer who has told the story of the Trojan War since ancient times has had to invent rationale to explain why all of the Greek city-states would go to war for one cuckolded king, why the Trojans don't just send Helen back to Greece, and why the great warrior Achilles withdraws from the conflict and then changes his mind. ""Troy"" changes some of the interactions between the characters and creates its own line of reasoning that makes sense -or as much sense as is necessary- within its own narrative. The character of Briseis (Rose Byrne), a Trojan priestess of the Temple of Apollo who is abducted by the Greeks, is a composite of ""The Iliad""'s Briseis and Chryseis, Achilles' mistress and Agamemnon's captive, respectively. Combining the two women turns out to be a good idea, as she can exacerbate the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon, provide both men with opportunity to demonstrate their character, and make mercenary, vain Achilles sympathetic. Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) is another altered character. Traditionally Achilles' close companion, in ""Troy"" Patroclus is his young cousin whose eagerness proves fateful.Some viewers will be appalled to see an epic poem turned into epic fluff. ""Troy"" is 2 1/2 hours of epic fluff, occasionally bordering on cheese. Its shortcoming isn't its departure from ""The Iliad"" or any other source of the ancient legend. The Trojan War is legend, not a true story or even a novel to which one is expected to be faithful. The story of Troy has changed to suit its audience with every retelling for thousands of years. ""Troy"" carries on that tradition. The trouble is that, in condensing thousands of written pages into pivotal events and characters only, much of the substance is lost. But ""Troy"" does still manage to be a tragedy, as Homer intended. And it is entertaining, as I'm sure all ancient poets and oral storytellers hoped. It's just not eloquent or sophisticated.

852304,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B0002Z0EXQ,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[3, 5]","I really wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film. Movies that are based on either history or works of literature always make me nervous, since they're sometimes botched so badly. In addition, I'm no great fan of Orlando Bloom, and I wasn't certain Brad Pitt was the ideal actor to play Achilles. On the other hand, the trailer looked really great, and while I must admit I've only read some excerpts from Homer's ""Iliad"" and not the whole thing, I know the basic storyline and thought it could make an excellent movie if done well. Having now seen the movie, I'm glad to say that, though it wasn't all it could have been, it was still quite good and I did enjoy it.The movie's plotline does not fully follow Homer's epic (see the excellent review by ""ravenya"" for a great rundown on the divergences). The most notable changes to the story are that there are no gods and what was supposed to be a ten-year war is concluded in much less than a month. Nevertheless, it makes a great story in and of itself. The rash young Trojan prince, Paris (Orlando Bloom), destroys the recently concluded peace between Troy and the Greek King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) when he runs off with Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), wife of Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Menelaus wants Helen back, and Agamemnon uses this opportunity to launch a campaign to gain a foothold in the Aegean. However, he needs the help of the proud and moody warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) if he has a hope of conquering the great city and winning his war.Meanwhile, when the Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) discovers what Paris, his brother, has done, he grimly sets about preparing Troy for the inevitable war. Ironically, it is the two men on either side who don't want to fight this war at all, Hector and Achilles, upon whom each side is dependant for victory. Hector fights only to defend his homeland, and Achilles, who initially refuses to fight at all, only joins the fray when Hector mistakenly slays Achilles's cousin, thinking it is the great warrior himself. The outcome of the story is ultimately tragic, yet moving. The only thing that irks me about the movie's ending is the way they alluded to Paris and Helen's romance as having a neat and tidy conclusion.Despite my misgivings, Brad Pitt made an excellent Achilles. My only criticism is that his voice couldn't seem to decide whether it wanted to have an accent or not. Other than that, he portrayed the proud demigod quite well. We hate him for his excessive pride and arrogance at the same time that we love him for his moments of heroism and honor. And he definitely fits the bill visually - rumor has it he packed on 20 pounds of muscle for the movie! The star of the day, however, is Eric Bana as Hector. His performance is undoubtedly the best in the film. Some of my favorite parts of the movie are the tender moments that pass between Hector and his wife, Andromache (Saffron Burrows). The other actor who really nailed his role was Sean Bean, portraying Odysseus. Though the role is relatively small here, it was very well executed.The rest of the cast is decent, but not spectacular. Orlando Bloom turns in a performance that's passable, but nothing terrific. The only moment when I really felt anything for his character was his collapse into abject fear during his one-on-one fight with Menelaus. Diane Kruger as Helen is similar. She is believable, but this woman who is supposed to be the world's greatest beauty actually pales next to Hector's lovely wife. Brian Cox's blustering Agamemnon was fairly good, as was Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Troy's king, Priam.The cinematography of ""Troy"" is excellent, and definitely a feast for the eyes. The battle sequences are nicely balanced with dramatic scenes, so that the movie becomes neither a plotless action-fest nor a sluggish over-the-top romance. We get just enough of both elements, but not too much. Sticklers for literary accuracy will no doubt be disappointed, since as I mentioned earlier the plotline has been tweaked in numerous places, but if you take the movie as it's own story, I think it works nicely. Overall, while ""Troy"" doesn't realize its full potential, it's worth seeing in the theater at least once. I'm undecided as of yet whether I'll purchase the DVD when it comes out, but I certainly wouldn't mind seeing the movie again in the future.",4,"Not perfect by any means, but still enjoyable and worthwhile",1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,4379,"['really', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'Movies', 'are', 'based', 'history', 'works', 'literature', 'always', 'make', 'nervous', ""'re"", 'sometimes', 'botched', 'so', 'badly', 'addition', ""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'was', ""n't"", 'certain', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'ideal', 'actor', 'play', 'Achilles', 'other', 'hand', 'trailer', 'looked', 'really', 'great', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'excerpts', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'not', 'whole', 'thing', 'know', 'basic', 'storyline', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'excellent', 'movie', 'done', 'well', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'did', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'movie', 'plotline', 'not', 'fully', 'follow', 'Homer', 'epic', 'see', 'excellent', 'review', 'ravenya', 'great', 'rundown', 'divergences', 'most', 'notable', 'changes', 'story', 'are', 'are', 'gods', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'ten-year', 'war', 'concluded', 'much', 'less', 'month', 'Nevertheless', 'great', 'story', 'rash', 'young', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'recently', 'concluded', 'peace', 'Troy', 'Greek', 'King', 'Agamemnon', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'when', 'Helen', 'Sparta', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'wife', 'Agamemnon', 'brother', 'Menelaus', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Menelaus', 'Helen', 'back', 'Agamemnon', 'opportunity', 'launch', 'campaign', 'gain', 'foothold', 'Aegean', 'However', 'help', 'proud', 'moody', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'hope', 'conquering', 'great', 'city', 'winning', 'war.Meanwhile', 'when', 'Trojan', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'what', 'Paris', 'brother', 'done', 'grimly', 'preparing', 'Troy', 'inevitable', 'war', 'Ironically', 'two', 'men', 'side', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'war', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'whom', 'side', 'dependant', 'victory', 'Hector', 'only', 'defend', 'homeland', 'Achilles', 'who', 'initially', 'fight', 'only', 'fray', 'when', 'Hector', 'mistakenly', 'Achilles', 'cousin', 'thinking', 'great', 'warrior', 'outcome', 'story', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'yet', 'moving', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'ending', 'way', 'alluded', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'romance', 'having', 'neat', 'tidy', 'conclusion.Despite', 'misgivings', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'made', 'excellent', 'Achilles', 'only', 'criticism', 'voice', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'wanted', 'have', 'accent', 'not', 'Other', 'portrayed', 'proud', 'demigod', 'quite', 'well', 'hate', 'excessive', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'moments', 'heroism', 'honor', 'definitely', 'bill', 'visually', 'rumor', 'packed', '20', 'pounds', 'muscle', 'movie', 'star', 'day', 'however', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'performance', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'film', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'tender', 'moments', 'pass', 'Hector', 'wife', 'Andromache', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'nailed', 'role', 'was', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'portraying', 'Odysseus', 'role', 'relatively', 'small', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'decent', 'not', 'spectacular', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'performance', 'passable', 'nothing', 'terrific', 'only', 'moment', 'when', 'really', 'felt', 'anything', 'character', 'was', 'collapse', 'abject', 'fear', 'one-on-one', 'fight', 'Menelaus', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'similar', 'believable', 'woman', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'world', 'greatest', 'beauty', 'actually', 'next', 'Hector', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'blustering', 'Agamemnon', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'was', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'portrayal', 'Troy', 'king', 'Priam.The', 'cinematography', 'Troy', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'feast', 'eyes', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'plotless', 'action-fest', 'sluggish', 'over-the-top', 'romance', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'elements', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Sticklers', 'literary', 'accuracy', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'disappointed', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'plotline', 'been', 'tweaked', 'numerous', 'places', 'take', 'movie', 'own', 'story', 'think', 'nicely', 'Overall', 'Troy', ""n't"", 'realize', 'full', 'potential', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theater', 'least', 'once', ""'m"", 'undecided', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'purchase', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'future']",N/A

However, after watching the movie for a second passing, it started to endear itself to me.Brad Pitt was still a bit of a miscast Achilles, and Peter O'Toole an odd choice for Priam, the King of Troy, but the bad guys were very well cast, I thought. Agamemnon and Menalaus were both brilliantly portrayed in all of their warlike savagery. Orlando Bloom seemed more plastic than normal as Paris, second prince of Troy, and the lover of Helen.On the plus side, the cinematography was simply superb, and when the CGI was used to assist, it was of very high quality. The overall visual effects were exception, from the sets used right through to the battle scenes.The special features in this edition are fairly good, and well worth the look themselves. I found them informative and interesting, though unless you are a ""The Making of..."" geek like me, you might want to pass on them.Overall, the movie is not the best I have seen, of course, but for a big budget, Hollywood production with the big name stars, it is not too bad at all.

I had heard bits and pieces of the real myth/story but had no idea of the details and all that stuff.  Maybe this is why I liked it better than some of the reviewers that hated it because of the ""not true to the books / original story"" crowd.I thought the acting was excellent although Brad Pitt seemed out of place sometimes.  He just isn't a rough and tough dude like Achilles must have been.  Otherwise, the characters were cast almost perfectly.The unfolding story had some interesting twists and turns that kept me involved and waiting for the next situation to occur.  I enjoyed the back and forth nature of the battles and strategies, especially the ending when Troy finally gets sacked.  VERY cool stuff.The battle scenes were as well done as you could possibly do them with great choreography, violence to show the bloodiness of war, and also the magnitude of it all.  The huge number of boats in the sea on their way to Troy was a breathtaking shot. So are the shots of the huge armies just waiting to go at it.Overall, this film came out pretty well, not perfect, but very much worth seeing.  The DVD quality and the sound quality are as good as you can get!The flaws are as follows:- Brad Pitt tried to play Achilles the best he could but just seemed out of place and was probably miscast here.- The movie/plot deviated quite a bit from the actual events/legend/myths.  I have no problem with this though, it was an entertaining movie not a history lesson.  Still, they could have stayed true to the ""Iliad"".- The extra features on the second disc are pretty weak and not very good.If you can get it at a sale price, I'd buy it.

The extra scenes - a mixture of character moments and action scenes, truly change it from a bit of a muddle, to something approaching classic status.The battle scenes add little, but the character scenes change and explain the dynamics of the characters, in particular Sean Bean's Odysseus, and the tension between King Agamemnon and Achilles.There is still a problem with the casting... no-one really looks that comfortable in their roles, neither Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and certainly not Orlando Bloom.  Only Peter O'Toole really fits the part, at least as much of a part as he is given.  Diane Kruger looks pretty, but whether it is the script, or her acting, it is difficult to say - but she never quite seems worth putting a thousand ships to sea for.That aside, the battle scenes are visceral, and if this movie added anything new, it was the mano-a-mano battles with Achilles, which are terrifically well choreographed to make you really believe in his invincibility.Extras are prolific - I gave up before I managed to exhaust all the topics, which are conveniently arranged in segments a few minutes long, so you can either watch all together or search for just the parts which interest.A worthy package which goes some way to restoring the reputation of this previously maligned movie.",4,"At last, now available in epic cut",1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,1498,"['new', 'director', 'cut', 'Troy', 'might', '3', 'hours', 'be', 'rather', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'sitting', 'cinema', 'home', 'theatre', 'now', 'finally', 'movie', 'punters', 'wished', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'extra', 'scenes', 'mixture', 'character', 'moments', 'action', 'scenes', 'truly', 'change', 'bit', 'muddle', 'something', 'approaching', 'classic', 'status.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'add', 'little', 'character', 'scenes', 'change', 'explain', 'dynamics', 'characters', 'particular', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'tension', 'King', 'Agamemnon', 'Achilles.There', 'still', 'problem', 'casting', 'no-one', 'really', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'certainly', 'not', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Only', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'really', 'part', 'least', 'much', 'part', 'given', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'pretty', 'script', 'acting', 'difficult', 'say', 'never', 'quite', 'worth', 'putting', 'thousand', 'ships', 'sea', 'for.That', 'aside', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'visceral', 'movie', 'added', 'anything', 'new', 'was', 'mano-a-mano', 'battles', 'Achilles', 'are', 'terrifically', 'well', 'choreographed', 'make', 'really', 'believe', 'invincibility.Extras', 'are', 'prolific', 'gave', 'up', 'managed', 'exhaust', 'topics', 'are', 'conveniently', 'arranged', 'segments', 'few', 'minutes', 'long', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'together', 'search', 'just', 'parts', 'interest.A', 'worthy', 'package', 'way', 'restoring', 'reputation', 'previously', 'maligned', 'movie']",N/A

852313,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B0002Z0EXQ,Ms Winston,"[3, 3]","As someone else mentioned, this movie was ""inspired"" by Homer's epic poem and was never intended to be a line by line re-creation of the original. The Robert Fagles translation published by Penguin Classics is over 600 pages, so obviously the story needed to be condensed. How to cut a classic is always a problem -- why was the decision made to eliminate any mention of the gods and goddesses who play such major roles in the original? Was Petersen afraid that the movie would be too much like the ""Clash of the Titans?"" Or that a 21st century audience would not be able to identify with the concept of deities playing with and manipulating humans? Since there was little emphasis on the gods, we don't get Agamemnon's sacrific of his daughter prior to sailing to Troy, we don't get Cassandra, and the Myrmadon's horrified look when Achilles destroys a religious statue just looks campy. This decision to eliminate the gods as participants IMO was not the correct one, as it means that many of the more serious themes in Homer's work cannot be explored, including the idea of destiny working out the fate of Achilles.Of all the actors, I thought Eric Bana  and Sean Bean put in the most memorable performances, as everything they were thinking or feeling were conveyed by their facial expressions and body language. Brad Pitt was an adequate Achilles, given his limited range as an actor (I still think of ""A River Runs Through It"" as his best work). Part of the problem for Pitt was with the script, and again it had to do with the de-emphasis of the influence of the gods and godesses: nothing is mentioned about his heel as being his only weak point or why that is so. My grandson, who is nine, didn't understand why the wound was so devestating, and I have a feeling from the reaction that he wasn't the only one in the audience who didn't have this bit of information. The idea of Achilles moving toward his destiny wasn't really made clear. Achilles generally seemed like nothing more than a glory hunter with a pout on until his cousin was killed. That was really the only time we truly felt the wrath of Achilles.The rest of the cast, with the exception of Diane Krueger as Helen and possibly Orlando Bloom as Paris, turned in good workmanlike performances. Obviously the German model selected to play Helen was chosen for her beauty and not her acting ability, but I expected more from Mr Bloom. I think part of the problem was that he just looked too babyfaced to be the worldly Paris, seducer of countless women, although he did a good job of portraying his character's all-consuming fear in the single combat with Menalaus. And it was nice seeing Julie Cristie as the mother of Achilles...we should all be able to age that well!I found the battle scenes not to be as moving and exciting as one would have thought to see in an epic of this type. Part of the problem may have been that I had recently watched the Civil War movie ""Glory,"" which does an excellent job of realistically recreating hand to hand combat. The musical score was adequate, but not memorable. Even though IMO ""Troy"" is not up there with other epics such as ""Braveheart"" and ""Master and Commander - Far Side of the World"" I still felt it was an enjoyable, if superficial, treatment of Homer's epic.",3,Flawed But Not Without Merit,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,3281,"['someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'Homer', 'epic', 'poem', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'line', 'line', 're-creation', 'original', 'Robert', 'Fagles', 'translation', 'published', 'Penguin', 'Classics', '600', 'pages', 'so', 'obviously', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'condensed', 'How', 'cut', 'classic', 'always', 'problem', 'why', 'was', 'decision', 'made', 'eliminate', 'mention', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'who', 'play', 'such', 'major', 'roles', 'original', 'Was', 'Petersen', 'afraid', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'Clash', 'Titans', '21st', 'century', 'audience', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'concept', 'deities', 'playing', 'manipulating', 'humans', 'was', 'little', 'emphasis', 'gods', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Agamemnon', 'sacrific', 'daughter', 'prior', 'sailing', 'Troy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Cassandra', 'Myrmadon', 'horrified', 'look', 'when', 'Achilles', 'religious', 'statue', 'just', 'campy', 'decision', 'eliminate', 'gods', 'participants', 'IMO', 'was', 'not', 'correct', 'one', 'many', 'more', 'serious', 'themes', 'Homer', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explored', 'including', 'idea', 'destiny', 'working', 'out', 'fate', 'Achilles.Of', 'actors', 'thought', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'put', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'everything', 'were', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'were', 'conveyed', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'adequate', 'Achilles', 'given', 'limited', 'range', 'actor', 'still', 'think', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'best', 'work', 'Part', 'problem', 'Pitt', 'was', 'script', 'again', 'had', 'do', 'de-emphasis', 'influence', 'gods', 'godesses', 'nothing', 'mentioned', 'heel', 'being', 'only', 'weak', 'point', 'why', 'so', 'My', 'grandson', 'who', 'nine', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'wound', 'was', 'so', 'devestating', 'have', 'feeling', 'reaction', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'audience', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bit', 'information', 'idea', 'Achilles', 'moving', 'destiny', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'Achilles', 'generally', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'more', 'glory', 'hunter', 'pout', 'cousin', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'time', 'truly', 'felt', 'wrath', 'Achilles.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'exception', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'Helen', 'possibly', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'turned', 'good', 'workmanlike', 'performances', 'Obviously', 'German', 'model', 'selected', 'play', 'Helen', 'was', 'chosen', 'beauty', 'not', 'acting', 'ability', 'expected', 'more', 'Mr', 'Bloom', 'think', 'part', 'problem', 'was', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'babyfaced', 'be', 'worldly', 'Paris', 'seducer', 'countless', 'women', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'all-consuming', 'fear', 'single', 'combat', 'Menalaus', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Cristie', 'mother', 'Achilles', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'age', 'well', 'found', 'battle', 'not', 'be', 'moving', 'exciting', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'see', 'epic', 'type', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'recently', 'watched', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'Glory', 'excellent', 'job', 'realistically', 'recreating', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'adequate', 'not', 'memorable', 'Even', 'IMO', 'Troy', 'not', 'there', 'other', 'epics', 'such', 'Braveheart', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'Homer', 'epic']",N/A

I love the idea of taking old stories and making movies out of them. All those lovely stories that have been around thousands (or hundreds) of years....But there's a reason they've been around so long - people LIKE them. So why does Hollywood feel it has to add so many twists to the story? Why does it have to change it so much? Take King Arthur, for instance, or Robin Hood. And Troy. It's true they are just myths, but there IS actually a limitation to the different possibilities for the original version.They ruined this story! Ok, ok, so maybe you don't care about the story, or all willing to enjoy a changed version. Well, I was prepared to enjoy it, even if it was changed.But, even NOT looking at the legend... it was no good. I mean, I think that the actors did a good job, but it was BORING. The fight between Achilles and Hector was pretty good, but that's about it. There were basically two types of characters: Whiney and annoying, and cruel. Not wonderfully cruel - but cruel like a child's character (like Char's uncle in the movie 'Ella Enchanted'). And then there was Achilles, who seemed to fall in love with a girl but really showed no emotion throughout, and Hector, who was the hero of the movie (in my opinion), and was the only good character.They should have taken out a few bad scenes, and made this movie PG.Now, looking at how they changed it from the legend... well... they portrayed the Trojans as the 'good guys', and made the Greeks the 'bad guys'. Menalus, instead of loving his wife (Helen) and wanting to get her back, just wants to kill her. Paris, instead of being a cruel whiney coward, is just a pathetic sort of person you either feel sorry for or want to strangle.And the gods. WHERE are the Gods?! It is my solemn duty to inform you that there aren't any in this movie. According to the legends, it was all the gods fault that Paris stole Helen (and half of Sparta's treasure) in the first place. The gods intervened - like Apollo, who guided Paris's arrow to Achilles ankle.Oh, by the way, in this movie, Achilles is a totally normal guy. Apart from showing no emotion, being some sort of great fighter, and having a water nymph for a mother, that is. What about the Achilles Tendon? That's who it was named for. Achilles supposedly was dipped, held by his ankle, into this stuff that made him immortal. His ankle was the only vulnerable spot. In the movie, they erased that fact, and Achilles simply died with arrows in his chest. Yahoo.Ok, I'm drawing out this review, but I'm trying to be helpful (and express my disappointment, too). If you are a Brad Pitt fan, or Orlando Bloom fan, etc., then you might like this movie. After all, Pitt seems to be the central character, and Bloom wins in the end.If you like fighting movies, this isn't a good choice, because there doesn't seem to be a lot of fighting. Hmm - I don't see how they manage 2 1/2 hours, considering there isn't any story either.Sorry - what I mean, is, it goes like this (If you don't want to know what happens, don't read this): Paris and Helen are in love. Paris takes Helen away. They get to Troy. Then the Greeks get to Troy. Then they fight for 3 days.

One of the major flaws of the movie, aside from the anachronistic dialogue (I can't stand it when modern pop culture phrases find their way into the scripts for ancient period pieces) was the bad casting.  The casting director I'm assuming was given this simple task:  Pretty people.  Don't worry about acting, just make sure they're pretty.Okay.  Luckily in Hollywood you can find pretty people who are also good actors.  Unfortunately for Troy, very few of them are in this movie.The two standouts are Brad Pitt (a proven great actor from Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall, Seven, etc.) and Eric Bana (I've only seen him in the Hulk, which was awful but not his fault so I'll pardon him).  The director must have given Pitt this instruction to guide him through the movie ""Be an @sshole!"" because that's pretty much how Pitt plays his Achilles.  You feel no remorse for Achilles when he dies because he gives you no reason to.  Bana, on the other hand, was the only shining point in the entire plundering film and after his death, there was really no point in going on.  Orlando Bloom who seems to make me less attracted to him in every movie I've seen him in since The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is a pathetic waste of flesh who is responsible for the death of thousands and the fall of his homeland for some other man's [...] wife and he is one of the few main characters that survives.  I guess the moral of the story is, the reason the world is so terrible is because the baseless cowards live on while the valiant and courageous die.I could go on about the movie but there's no real point.  I only saw it once and don't want to see it again.  I'm currently living in China where DVDs are the cost of 1 U.S. dollar and I'm not even willing to buy Troy.

Brad Pitt gives a fine performance almost despite himself (notice how he adjusts his chiton unnecessarily for the camera's benefit) as Achilles, the troubled chieftain who decides to sit out his part in a war because of an insult by another chief. The cast is stellar, though no one is given enough screen time: Sean Bean as wily Odysseus, the aristocratic Peter O'Toole as King Priam, and too many more to list. The photography is beautiful and has the very definition of Cretan blue. But there are too many times when the CGI overwhelms the living action, to the point where it is as obvious as was the modern underwear on those old black and white epics of my childhood. Particularly egregious was the fleet under sail, which looked like it was shot off someone's desktop. Another problem: in this day and age, the movie omits the fact - central to ""The Iliad"" - that Patroclus was not Achilles' cousin or best friend, he was his lover. Only his death can bring Achilles out of his tantrum and send him rushing onto the battlefield in search of vengeance. I understand that it might be complicated to portray a warrior who removes himself from battle because a slave girl is taken from him but then returns to war because of the death of a male lover, but I think the world is old enough to understand that bisexuality existed in ancient Greece (as it does today). Anyone who reads ""The Iliad"", which includes a majority of college students and a fair number of high school students, is well aware of the story line. There are no surprises here and thus no need to put a metaphorical fig leaf over the situation.

852326,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B0002Z0EXQ,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[5, 9]","A couple of months ago, I saw the highly anticipated epic, ""Troy"", at the theater. I, for one, must say that the film was, without a doubt, one of the most impressive and action-packed epics ever made since Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" and Charlton Heston's ""Ben-Hur""! The direction of Wolfgang Petersen (""Air Force One"") was top-notch and flawless! The performance of superstar Brad Pitt (""Snatch"", ""Ocean's Eleven""), headlining the film's cast as the Greek warrior Achilles, was powerful and commanding! Once again, this is Pitt's best performance in years! The performance of Eric Bana (""The Hulk"", ""Black Hawk Down""), as Achilles' Trojan counterpart, Prince Hector, was not only a tour de force performance, but an unforgettable one at that! Rounding out the cast are Orlando Bloom (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), Diane Kruger (""Wicker Park"", ""National Treasure""), Brian Cox (""The Ring""), Brendan Gleeson (""Cold Mountain""), Sean Bean (""Don't Say A Word""), Saffron Burrows (""Wing Commander""), Rose Byrne (""Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones""), Julie Christie (""Afterglow""), and Peter O'Toole (""Lawrence of Arabia"") in which they gave excellent performances as well!For those not familiar with Homer's ""The Iliad"", the oldest and most enduring story ever told, ""Troy"" goes like this: Trojan princes Hector (Bana) and Paris (Bloom) are on a peace-keeping errand for their father, King Priam (O'Toole), in Sparta. Paris falls for King Menelaus' (Gleeson) lovely young bride Helen (Kruger), and Paris whisks Helen back to Troy for his own. Big mistake for Paris! Because with Helen missing, not to mention Menelaus presenting the problem to his brother, the land-grabbing Super-monarch Agamemnon (Cox), who uses the problem as an excuse to start a war between Troy and most of Greece, and only a great, big wooden horse and the might of warrior-for-hire Achilles (Pitt) can infiltrate the impenetrable walls of Troy and avenge the ""theft"" of Helen.To take on the role of Achilles, Brad Pitt worked out ferociously for months, with four hours a day of intensive body-building and four hours of fight training. But Pitt's training took a turn for the worse as an injury sidelined him for three months while filming a crucial fight scene: the mano-a-mano showdown between Achilles and Hector (In other words, Pitt had damaged his Achilles heel, paying homage to his character). Yet physically, Pitt is everything that Achilles should be: beautiful, god-like, and a fighting machine. Yet, Achilles is not a brooding, James Dean, introspective Hamlet-type, which is how he is played by Pitt. Achilles is a hero with a tragic flaw (almost always hubris). ""The Iliad"", like the writings of the ancient Greeks, is not about language or character development. It's about larger-than-life themes: gods, goddesses, vengeance and might, and fury and fate. With fate behind all decisions, there is almost no need for character because there is no inner struggle. The Greek myths are painted in the broadest of strokes to create the largest of pictures. The story of this is saddled with a mortality and humanity that saps it of what makes it great in the first place: infinity.Nonetheless, ""Troy"" proved a whole lot. Pitt, a superstar and a member of Hollywood's $20-million club, has only carried a blockbuster once: ""Se7en"", and that was nine years ago. Likewise, the success of ""Troy"", to me, had a lot to say about the leading-man future of Eric Bana, whose supporting performance was the best thing about Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" in 2001, but who languished as last year's ""Hulk"" in the Ang Lee film. Pitt did an excellent job in the film because he's buff and fights well, and we all know he can act from ""Se7en"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", and he should have hits well into the near future. It will be long, however, before a romantic comedy or courtroom drama will test Orlando Bloom's mettle. But so long as he's shooting arrows (""The Lord of the Rings"" films) and buckling swashes (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"") in the company of $200 million-grossing Hobbits and pirates, he's safe. It's Bana who is the revelation as Hector. His warrior physique and huge, vulnerable eyes mix perfectly for a romantic hero. Fortunately, ""Troy"" follows the model of all great and not-so-great Hollywood epics by having a multi-national cast with British accents for characters who wouldn't have spoken English, anchored by the last surviving British theatrical aristocracy. That's why we get screen legend Peter O'Toole as King Priam, who, dusted off, is still the best actor in any scene he's in.In conclusion, ""Troy"" has it all: a great cast, spectacular action, a powerful storyline, and extraordinary, larger-than-life characters! My advice about the film is: Come for the Brad Pitt, savor the Orlando Bloom, and stay for the Eric Bana. And never, NEVER, under any circumstances, underestimate Peter O'Toole.

852333,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B0002Z0EXQ,No one of consequence,"[3, 5]","I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and quite frankly, I enjoyed it immensely.  I was left with a profound hollowness in my gut when the film ended -- which is precisely the effect any worthwhile Greek tragedy should have.  I realize that most of this movie's loudest critics highlight its rather pronounced divergence from Homer's classic Greek epic, The Iliad, and they're correct.  However, I would remind viewers that this movie's credits include an appropriate disclaimer -- it is ""inspired by"" the Iliad, rather than ""based on"" it.  Those two words open up a broad range of artistic license, of which the producers obviously availed themselves.  Nevertheless, the main story line of the battle of Troy is readily identifiable.The story is not complicated.  Just when Sparta and Troy are trying to cement a peace treaty to end years of war between them, young Paris, a prince of Troy (an uninspired performance by Orlando Bloom), takes a shine to Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of its king, Menelaus.  When Helen chooses to return to Troy with Paris and his brother, the legendary Trojan general Hector (Eric Bana), Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother, Greek king Agamemnon, to get her back.  Agamemnon sees a golden opportunity to unite the strength of all the Greek kingdoms under his banner and to do the one thing which has always eluded him -- the capture of Troy.  Trojan king Priam (masterfully played by Peter O'Toole) accepts the risk of war and chooses to stand behind his sons, trusting in his gods and the walls of Troy to protect them.Helen's face does, indeed, launch a thousand ships, bearing to the shores of Troy the largest Greek army ever fielded.  The Greeks quickly find, however, that the Trojan walls are just as impregnable as they have always been, and that Hector's leadership is brilliant.  Agamemnon is forced to turn to his unpredictable and uncontrollable ally, the mighty warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his band of Myrmidons.  Achilles brings a heroic dynamism and leadership to every battle, and literally makes the difference between victory and defeat for the giant Greek army.  In the many (very well done) battle scenes, Achilles reminds the viewer of a Cuisinart as he whirls and dances with deadly speed and precision among his enemies.But Achilles is a tormented man.  He is portrayed as the ultimate warrior, a veritable killing machine whose only code is death.  Legend has it that, as an infant, Achilles was dangled by his ankle and dipped into the River Styx, thereby becoming invulnerable to death.  Brad Pitt, in my opinion, did a fine acting job in this role, bringing depth and dimension to this complex character.  On the one hand, he is a cold ruthless killer, but on the other, he demonstrates a deep love, and grief, toward his young cousin Patroclus, and a strange tenderness and protectiveness toward Briseis, the young priestess he captures in an early battle.  He also shows an intense honor in his dealings with Priam and Hector, and even spares the life of a Trojan soldier who states simply, ""Please, I have a son.""  Frankly, this is probably the best role I have seen from Brad Pitt so far.The legends go on to tell of the Trojan Horse, and of Achilles' heel -- the one part of his body that wasn't dipped in the Styx.  Those legends play out forcefully and credibly on the screen, and leave the viewer struck by a deep sense of tragedy and loss as the story closes.  The entire film is one of heroism, nobility and action as the legends are brought vividly to life.  The settings and the battles are realistic and gritty, and the special effects are well done.  Maybe it's not true to Homer's original story, but if you can get past that I think you'll find that this is a wonderful tale in its own right.",4,"Not exactly the Iliad, but a pretty good movie nonetheless.",1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,3800,"['finally', 'got', 'watching', 'one', 'weekend', 'quite', 'frankly', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'was', 'left', 'profound', 'hollowness', 'gut', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'precisely', 'effect', 'worthwhile', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'should', 'have', 'realize', 'most', 'movie', 'loudest', 'critics', 'highlight', 'rather', 'pronounced', 'divergence', 'Homer', 'classic', 'Greek', 'epic', 'Iliad', ""'re"", 'correct', 'However', 'would', 'remind', 'viewers', 'movie', 'credits', 'include', 'appropriate', 'disclaimer', 'inspired', 'Iliad', 'rather', 'based', 'two', 'words', 'open', 'up', 'broad', 'range', 'artistic', 'license', 'producers', 'obviously', 'availed', 'Nevertheless', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'battle', 'Troy', 'readily', 'identifiable.The', 'story', 'not', 'complicated', 'Just', 'when', 'Sparta', 'Troy', 'are', 'trying', 'cement', 'peace', 'treaty', 'end', 'years', 'war', 'young', 'Paris', 'prince', 'Troy', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'shine', 'Helen', 'queen', 'Sparta', 'wife', 'king', 'Menelaus', 'When', 'Helen', 'return', 'Troy', 'Paris', 'brother', 'legendary', 'Trojan', 'general', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Menelaus', 'aid', 'brother', 'Greek', 'king', 'Agamemnon', 'get', 'back', 'Agamemnon', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'unite', 'strength', 'Greek', 'kingdoms', 'banner', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'eluded', 'capture', 'Troy', 'Trojan', 'king', 'Priam', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'risk', 'war', 'stand', 'sons', 'trusting', 'gods', 'walls', 'Troy', 'protect', 'them.Helen', 'face', 'indeed', 'thousand', 'ships', 'bearing', 'shores', 'Troy', 'largest', 'Greek', 'army', 'ever', 'fielded', 'Greeks', 'quickly', 'find', 'however', 'Trojan', 'walls', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'impregnable', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'Hector', 'leadership', 'brilliant', 'Agamemnon', 'forced', 'turn', 'unpredictable', 'uncontrollable', 'ally', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'band', 'Myrmidons', 'Achilles', 'heroic', 'dynamism', 'leadership', 'battle', 'literally', 'difference', 'victory', 'defeat', 'giant', 'Greek', 'army', 'many', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Achilles', 'viewer', 'Cuisinart', 'dances', 'deadly', 'speed', 'precision', 'enemies.But', 'Achilles', 'tormented', 'man', 'portrayed', 'ultimate', 'warrior', 'veritable', 'killing', 'machine', 'only', 'code', 'death', 'Legend', 'that', 'infant', 'Achilles', 'was', 'dangled', 'ankle', 'dipped', 'River', 'Styx', 'thereby', 'becoming', 'invulnerable', 'death', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'opinion', 'did', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'role', 'bringing', 'depth', 'dimension', 'complex', 'character', 'one', 'hand', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'other', 'deep', 'love', 'grief', 'young', 'cousin', 'Patroclus', 'strange', 'tenderness', 'protectiveness', 'Briseis', 'young', 'priestess', 'early', 'battle', 'also', 'intense', 'honor', 'dealings', 'Priam', 'Hector', 'even', 'life', 'Trojan', 'soldier', 'who', 'simply', 'Please', 'have', 'son', 'Frankly', 'probably', 'best', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'far.The', 'legends', 'go', 'tell', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'one', 'part', 'body', 'was', ""n't"", 'dipped', 'Styx', 'legends', 'play', 'out', 'forcefully', 'credibly', 'screen', 'leave', 'viewer', 'struck', 'deep', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'story', 'closes', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'heroism', 'nobility', 'action', 'legends', 'are', 'brought', 'vividly', 'life', 'settings', 'battles', 'are', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Maybe', 'not', 'true', 'Homer', 'original', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'own', 'right']",N/A

Well, OK, ""The Illiad"" it's not, but as good, old style, big-screen costume drama it's just fine. The cast is a mix of oldies-but-goodies and youthful hotties; some of the CG effects--the walls and city of Troy for example--aren't bad; and even if the scenery lacks variety--sand, sand everywhere--the battles that take place on all that sand are for the most part well choreographed. Brad Pitt, whose legendary good looks are seen to great advantage both in armor and in his birthday suit, offers up a nice portrayal of that nasty-tempered, fame-seeking Achilles. If his sullen, uncompromising Greek hero seems more 21st century than Bronze Age, he is still impressive in the role (in spite of critics' quibbles about his elocution), and in the fight scenes he is simply a pleasure to watch. Director Wolfgang Petersen sidesteps the issue of Achilles' bisexuality (pretty much the norm for many great men of ancient Greece), and turns Patroclus--played by Gerrett Hedlund--into a convenient cousin. Eric Bana does an excellent job as the steady, far more emotionally balanced Trojan warrior Hector. The great Peter O'Toole makes a welcome appearance as King Priam; as frail and misty-eyed as he seems, he can still wow an audience. Far too little use is made of Sean Bean as Odysseus (how about a sequel--""The Odyssey""?) Brian Cox has a hammy old time as Agammemnon, scowling, sneering, and cheerfully dining on whatever scenery is available. Saffron Burrows, as Hector's wife Andromache, is lovely to see but is given rather little to do. Finally, as pretty as Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom may be, they don't add much to the film in terms of acting power, but they look nice in their beautifully-designed costumes.Forget the critics' muttering and suspend any scholarly expectations, sit down with 2 1/2 hours worth of popcorn, and you'll probably find plenty to enjoy in ""Troy.""[Note: This is my second Amazon review of ""Troy""; my first was after the film opened in theatres, well before the release of the DVD.]",4,"It may not be Homer, but it's good entertainment",1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2177,"['Troy', 'opened', 'box', 'office', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'complaints', 'purists', 'high', 'school', 'humanities', 'teachers', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'Homer', 'epic', 'tale', 'Well', 'OK', 'Illiad', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'style', 'big-screen', 'costume', 'drama', 'just', 'fine', 'cast', 'mix', 'oldies-but-goodies', 'youthful', 'hotties', 'CG', 'effects', 'walls', 'city', 'Troy', 'example', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'scenery', 'variety', 'sand', 'sand', 'everywhere', 'battles', 'take', 'place', 'sand', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'choreographed', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'legendary', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'seen', 'great', 'advantage', 'armor', 'birthday', 'suit', 'up', 'nice', 'portrayal', 'nasty-tempered', 'fame-seeking', 'Achilles', 'sullen', 'uncompromising', 'Greek', 'hero', 'more', '21st', 'century', 'Bronze', 'Age', 'still', 'impressive', 'role', 'spite', 'critics', 'quibbles', 'elocution', 'fight', 'scenes', 'simply', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'issue', 'Achilles', 'bisexuality', 'pretty', 'much', 'norm', 'many', 'great', 'men', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'Patroclus', 'played', 'Gerrett', 'Hedlund', 'convenient', 'cousin', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'excellent', 'job', 'steady', 'far', 'more', 'emotionally', 'balanced', 'Trojan', 'warrior', 'Hector', 'great', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'welcome', 'appearance', 'King', 'Priam', 'frail', 'misty-eyed', 'can', 'still', 'wow', 'audience', 'Far', 'too', 'little', 'use', 'made', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Odysseus', 'how', 'sequel', 'Odyssey', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'hammy', 'old', 'time', 'Agammemnon', 'scowling', 'sneering', 'cheerfully', 'dining', 'scenery', 'available', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'Hector', 'wife', 'Andromache', 'lovely', 'see', 'given', 'rather', 'little', 'do', 'Finally', 'as', 'pretty', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'may', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', 'terms', 'acting', 'power', 'look', 'nice', 'beautifully-designed', 'costumes.Forget', 'critics', 'muttering', 'suspend', 'scholarly', 'expectations', 'sit', 'down', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'popcorn', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'Troy', '[', 'Note', 'second', 'Amazon', 'review', 'Troy', 'first', 'was', 'film', 'opened', 'theatres', 'well', 'release', 'DVD', ']']",N/A
852336,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B0002Z0EXQ,Octavius,"[13, 18]","...and Apollo would be quite angry at Wolfgang Petersen for directing such an appallingly bad adaptation of the Iliad. In addition to the bad acting, uninspiring battle scenes, and mediocre direction, the whole screenplay stands in such contrast to the Iliad or even the notion of a Greek epic that it's laughable.In the Iliad, most if not all the characters are tragic heroes and there aren't really any good or bad characters: all of the mortals succumb to the will of the Olympian gods. Although the film's removal of the immortal characters was not a bad idea, the dispositions of the mortals characters were changed so much that they follow neither the plot or theme of the Iliad. In the Iliad, Achilles worried about his fate and valor as a warrior but wasn't the type to sigh over those issues to every other character in the story: he did this primarily to his mother, Thetis the sea nymph. The Iliad also presents Helen as being beguiled or even abducted by Paris but she was never really Paris' willing lover. Another poor arrangement is Achilles' relation to Briseis. The movie actually combines Briseis (a girl captured by Achilles' men on an island raid and given to him as a token) with the character of Chryseis (daughter to Apollo's priest whom Agamemnon captured but returned only after he had unleahed Apollo's wrath on his army.) The film shows Achilles having intimate discussions with Briseis about the war, politics, etc. It's as if the film forgot that the story takes place in 1200 B.C. and not 20th century era of the emancipated woman. As the Iliad recites again and again, a woman's place was to tend to a man's bed, spindle her loom, and care for the household. Also given that Achilles was more fond of Patroclus than women, I don't think he would have cared one bit what his female captive thought with regards to anything other than obeying his commands.In terms of plot, the film leads the audience to believe that the siege of Troy was a picnic lasting only a few weeks instead of ten years. The film has both Agamemnon and Menelaus die before or during the sack of Troy which is completely at odds with the story: this was done simply to have Helen run off with Paris again in the end. The latter is the most stupid part of the film both in terms of plot and theme. Even in the film, Paris is the epitome of cowardice and is anything but manly in battle: to have him live and run off with Helen into the sunset is to make the coward the hero. It's as if Dobbs in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" kills everyone else and runs off with the gold. This type of plot structure is anti-climactic and undermines the entire thematic arrangement for an epic. An epic is a hero's tale, not a coward's: to make it otherwise isn't creative, it's just anti-climactic and simply idiotic.The battle scenes were uninspiring while the tactics and armaments were inaccurate. The phalanx was not a tactic used in the Iliad. The Iliad is quite descriptive in showing that the chariot dominated the battlefield while the infantry had a secondary role. The phalanx is a product of the citizen army of classical Greece, not the feudal armies of the Mycenean civilization. The funniest part is having Achilles' men use a Roman ""testudo"" or turtle formation that didn't come into existence until 1000 years later. The galleys shown in the film are also from the 5th century B.C. and not the 13th century B.C.: it would be the same as depicting Viking longboats of the 9th century as sailing vessels of the 18th century.In conclusion, this film is appalling in both concept and execution. I think it all starts witht he atrocious screenplay and Peterson's desperate efforts at directing this piece of trash into something watchable. I don't blame the actors too much for their lack of inspiration since they didn't have anything inspiring to work with in the first place. If you want to see this film because you never read the Iliad, don't bother: this film barely resembles the story. The plot is absurd and undermines the whole idea of an epic tale. Read the Iliad instead of watching this rubbish; it's more inspiring and Homer's battle descriptions are far more graphic than any of the action sequences in this pathetic film.",1,"""Anger be now your song immortal one...""",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,4236,"['Apollo', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'angry', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'directing', 'appallingly', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'Iliad', 'addition', 'bad', 'acting', 'uninspiring', 'battle', 'scenes', 'mediocre', 'direction', 'whole', 'screenplay', 'such', 'contrast', 'Iliad', 'even', 'notion', 'Greek', 'epic', 'Iliad', 'most', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'tragic', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'characters', 'mortals', 'succumb', 'will', 'Olympian', 'gods', 'film', 'removal', 'immortal', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'dispositions', 'mortals', 'characters', 'were', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'follow', 'plot', 'theme', 'Iliad', 'Iliad', 'Achilles', 'worried', 'fate', 'valor', 'warrior', 'was', ""n't"", 'type', 'sigh', 'issues', 'other', 'character', 'story', 'did', 'primarily', 'mother', 'Thetis', 'sea', 'nymph', 'Iliad', 'also', 'Helen', 'being', 'beguiled', 'even', 'abducted', 'Paris', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'Paris', 'willing', 'lover', 'poor', 'arrangement', 'Achilles', 'relation', 'Briseis', 'movie', 'actually', 'Briseis', 'girl', 'captured', 'Achilles', 'men', 'island', 'raid', 'given', 'token', 'character', 'Chryseis', 'daughter', 'Apollo', 'priest', 'whom', 'Agamemnon', 'captured', 'returned', 'only', 'had', 'unleahed', 'Apollo', 'wrath', 'army', 'film', 'Achilles', 'having', 'intimate', 'discussions', 'Briseis', 'war', 'politics', 'etc', 'film', 'forgot', 'story', 'place', '1200', 'B.C', 'not', '20th', 'century', 'era', 'emancipated', 'woman', 'Iliad', 'again', 'again', 'woman', 'place', 'was', 'tend', 'man', 'bed', 'spindle', 'loom', 'care', 'household', 'Also', 'given', 'Achilles', 'was', 'more', 'fond', 'Patroclus', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'cared', 'one', 'bit', 'what', 'female', 'captive', 'thought', 'regards', 'anything', 'other', 'obeying', 'commands.In', 'terms', 'plot', 'film', 'audience', 'believe', 'siege', 'Troy', 'was', 'picnic', 'lasting', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'instead', 'ten', 'years', 'film', 'Agamemnon', 'Menelaus', 'die', 'sack', 'Troy', 'completely', 'odds', 'story', 'was', 'done', 'simply', 'have', 'Helen', 'run', 'off', 'Paris', 'again', 'end', 'latter', 'most', 'stupid', 'part', 'film', 'terms', 'plot', 'theme', 'Even', 'film', 'Paris', 'epitome', 'cowardice', 'anything', 'manly', 'battle', 'have', 'live', 'run', 'off', 'Helen', 'sunset', 'make', 'coward', 'hero', 'Dobbs', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'everyone', 'else', 'off', 'gold', 'type', 'plot', 'structure', 'anti-climactic', 'entire', 'thematic', 'arrangement', 'epic', 'epic', 'hero', 'tale', 'not', 'coward', 'make', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'creative', 'just', 'anti-climactic', 'simply', 'idiotic.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'uninspiring', 'tactics', 'armaments', 'were', 'inaccurate', 'phalanx', 'was', 'not', 'tactic', 'used', 'Iliad', 'Iliad', 'quite', 'descriptive', 'showing', 'chariot', 'dominated', 'battlefield', 'infantry', 'had', 'secondary', 'role', 'phalanx', 'product', 'citizen', 'army', 'classical', 'Greece', 'not', 'feudal', 'armies', 'Mycenean', 'civilization', 'funniest', 'part', 'having', 'Achilles', 'men', 'use', 'Roman', 'testudo', 'turtle', 'formation', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'existence', '1000', 'years', 'later', 'galleys', 'shown', 'film', 'are', 'also', '5th', 'century', 'B.C', 'not', '13th', 'century', 'B.C', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'depicting', 'Viking', 'longboats', '9th', 'century', 'sailing', 'vessels', '18th', 'century.In', 'conclusion', 'film', 'appalling', 'concept', 'execution', 'think', 'witht', 'atrocious', 'screenplay', 'Peterson', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'directing', 'piece', 'trash', 'something', 'watchable', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'too', 'much', 'lack', 'inspiration', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'inspiring', 'work', 'first', 'place', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'never', 'read', 'Iliad', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'film', 'barely', 'story', 'plot', 'absurd', 'whole', 'idea', 'epic', 'tale', 'Read', 'Iliad', 'instead', 'watching', 'rubbish', 'more', 'inspiring', 'Homer', 'battle', 'descriptions', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'action', 'pathetic', 'film']",N/A

There was the training of the stuntmen (but it conveniently left out the Bulgarians' strike for the extreme condition that they worked in and also the pay packets), how the scenes tied in together even when the location shoots were located at Mexico and Malta, the editing, the sound effects, et cetera.  The behind the scene segment also talked about what we already knew about the hurricane that destroyed the set, the delay due to reconstruction of the Troy fortress and waiting for Brad Pitt's achilles tendon to heel (ironic)?  In terms of the acting, it was good in patches but one couldn't help but notice that the acting was secondary to this grand spectacle when they had to strictly adhere to the structures to make sure that it worked like a clockwork.  Peter O'Toole was faultless in playing Priam and as Brad Pitt said himself, the scene of Priam asking for Hector's body back for a proper burial was the highlight of his career and understandly so.  Eric Bana was charismatic and tremendous as the reluctant and tormented Hector who fought for his beloved country, Troy and his obligation as a Prince and as a protector to his younger brother, Paris.  Brad Pitt was almost always criticised for being too good looking for his role but his presence in this movie was credible.  Sean Bean was faultless playing the king of Ithaca, a pragmatist ruler who mediated between Achilles and Argamenon and sided with the Greek for his country's livelihood.  Then, there was the priestess (an Australian girl whose name had escaped me) and also Achilles' love interest in this movie who stole every scenes that she was into.  Then, there was Brian Cox (reminding me so much of Dennis Hopper on a bad hair day), Orlando Bloom (not another epic movies with his involvement in it - yawn).  All these characters basically tied the whole movie together.  Despite that it's such a visually exciting movie, it is akin to Titanics, devoid of a soul which would make it a modern classics.  This disturbed me.  Perhaps, we all knew that this is a tragedy and in the end, everybody died.  There wasn't a just cause in this story and the massacre of people from both sides were simply senseless especially when we knew that it was all started of the vanity of Paris, falling in love with a married woman when he wasn't supposed to.  I would remember Bravehearts for we have a tendency to vouch for the underdogs especially when we know that  Conqueror was arrogant and devious in their conquest of Scotland.  We would also vouch for mel Gibson's character again in the Patriots for his family was under threat and as a father, he had to do what's necessary not simply to defend his family but also his country.  All of these were something that we would attach our feelings to but for a Greek tragedy that was almost four thousand years old, it's a bit difficult.  Wolgang Petersen wanted to do this movie because he missed his chance in the Gladiators but in the end, Gladiators, to me, scored on the emotional side as we had empathy for someone who had lost everything and to revenge against someone who had wronged him.  Anyhow, if you can overlook the mixture of accents in this movie, having Englishmen, Aussies, American, Bulgarians, Mexicans and if you can also overlook the faithfulness of this movie to the Greek tragedy, this is actually quite an entertainment movie to be shared around!",4,Souless But Still a Grand Epic,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,3525,"['Technically', 'movie', 'blast', 'geek', 'was', 'fun', 'sitting', 'sections', 'explaining', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'made', 'was', 'training', 'stuntmen', 'conveniently', 'left', 'out', 'Bulgarians', 'strike', 'extreme', 'condition', 'worked', 'also', 'pay', 'packets', 'how', 'scenes', 'tied', 'together', 'even', 'when', 'location', 'shoots', 'were', 'located', 'Mexico', 'Malta', 'editing', 'sound', 'effects', 'et', 'cetera', 'scene', 'segment', 'also', 'talked', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'hurricane', 'destroyed', 'set', 'delay', 'due', 'reconstruction', 'Troy', 'fortress', 'waiting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'achilles', 'tendon', 'heel', 'ironic', 'terms', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'patches', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'acting', 'was', 'secondary', 'grand', 'spectacle', 'when', 'had', 'strictly', 'adhere', 'structures', 'make', 'sure', 'worked', 'clockwork', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'faultless', 'playing', 'Priam', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'said', 'scene', 'Priam', 'asking', 'Hector', 'body', 'back', 'proper', 'burial', 'was', 'highlight', 'career', 'understandly', 'so', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'was', 'charismatic', 'tremendous', 'reluctant', 'tormented', 'Hector', 'who', 'fought', 'beloved', 'country', 'Troy', 'obligation', 'Prince', 'protector', 'younger', 'brother', 'Paris', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'criticised', 'being', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'role', 'presence', 'movie', 'was', 'credible', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'faultless', 'playing', 'king', 'Ithaca', 'pragmatist', 'ruler', 'who', 'mediated', 'Achilles', 'Argamenon', 'sided', 'Greek', 'country', 'livelihood', 'Then', 'was', 'priestess', 'Australian', 'girl', 'name', 'had', 'escaped', 'also', 'Achilles', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'who', 'stole', 'scenes', 'was', 'Then', 'was', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'reminding', 'so', 'much', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'not', 'epic', 'movies', 'involvement', 'yawn', 'characters', 'basically', 'tied', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'such', 'visually', 'exciting', 'movie', 'akin', 'Titanics', 'devoid', 'soul', 'would', 'make', 'modern', 'classics', 'disturbed', 'Perhaps', 'knew', 'tragedy', 'end', 'everybody', 'died', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'cause', 'story', 'massacre', 'people', 'sides', 'were', 'simply', 'senseless', 'especially', 'when', 'knew', 'was', 'started', 'vanity', 'Paris', 'falling', 'love', 'married', 'woman', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'would', 'remember', 'Bravehearts', 'have', 'tendency', 'vouch', 'underdogs', 'especially', 'when', 'know', 'Conqueror', 'was', 'arrogant', 'devious', 'conquest', 'Scotland', 'would', 'also', 'vouch', 'mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'again', 'Patriots', 'family', 'was', 'threat', 'father', 'had', 'do', 'what', 'necessary', 'not', 'simply', 'defend', 'family', 'also', 'country', 'were', 'something', 'would', 'attach', 'feelings', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'was', 'almost', 'four', 'thousand', 'years', 'old', 'bit', 'difficult', 'Wolgang', 'Petersen', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'missed', 'chance', 'Gladiators', 'end', 'Gladiators', 'scored', 'emotional', 'side', 'had', 'empathy', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'everything', 'revenge', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'wronged', 'Anyhow', 'can', 'overlook', 'mixture', 'accents', 'movie', 'having', 'Englishmen', 'Aussies', 'American', 'Bulgarians', 'Mexicans', 'can', 'also', 'overlook', 'faithfulness', 'movie', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'be', 'shared']",N/A
852351,AIDQV95MLCIDD,B0002Z0EXQ,P. Luce,"[0, 0]","Ok, this was a big Hollywood epic that had over the top acting, over the top action, and lots of tanned A-list actors. I loved every minute (and there are quite a few minutes) of it. It isn't the best telling of the story of Troy, but it is worth watching. Pitt, Bana and Bloom all walk around with their bare chests tanned, waxed, and buffed but they reminded me of all the old Charlton Heston epics such as Ben Hur and El Cid. I enjoyed the movie and thought it did as good a job with the story as the recent Helen of Troy mini-series that ran on TV. You can not get a better villain than Brian Cox (who has carved a nice villain spot in movies such as X2 and the Bourne Supremacy and who gave audiences their first taste of Hannibal Lector in Manhunter). He does a great job at being just nasty. Peter O'Toole (who looked extremely old in this movie and who has said he hated it) is always great to watch on the screen and I wish they would have done more with his character. The movie has holes in it and they take liberties with the story, namely with Pitt's Achilles character, but it is nothing that took away from the overall movie. The movie starts with war and it ends with war. The DVD is also loaded to the max with special features that make up for any part of the movie that might let you down. Pitt gets annoying at times, but Bana does a great job at playing his counter part Prince Hector. If they missed cast anyone, it would be Bloom. He comes off too weak for the role of Paris and you really got to wonder why they just didn't throw him off the wall when the Greek army first showed up. You also have to wonder why they cast Bloom knowing that he would be using a bow and everyone would compare it to Lord of the Rings. Diane Kruger is good as Helen but she really is just a trophy in the movie and they never take the time to explain her character (like the mini series did). Overall, I would say that Troy stands up to other epics such as Gladiator and Braveheart and blows other recent retellings of classics, such as the horrible King Arthur adaptation, out of the water. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a big epic story with huge stars in the tradition of classic Hollywood.",4,Troy is no Torjan Horse this movie is true Hollywood epic,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,2224,"['Ok', 'was', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'had', 'top', 'acting', 'top', 'action', 'lots', 'tanned', 'A-list', 'actors', 'loved', 'minute', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'best', 'telling', 'story', 'Troy', 'worth', 'watching', 'Pitt', 'Bana', 'Bloom', 'walk', 'bare', 'chests', 'tanned', 'waxed', 'buffed', 'reminded', 'old', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'epics', 'such', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'El', 'Cid', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'story', 'recent', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'mini-series', 'ran', 'TV', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'villain', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'carved', 'nice', 'villain', 'spot', 'movies', 'such', 'X2', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'who', 'gave', 'audiences', 'first', 'taste', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'Manhunter', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'just', 'nasty', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'looked', 'extremely', 'old', 'movie', 'who', 'said', 'hated', 'always', 'great', 'watch', 'screen', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'character', 'movie', 'holes', 'take', 'liberties', 'story', 'namely', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'character', 'nothing', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'movie', 'movie', 'war', 'war', 'DVD', 'also', 'loaded', 'max', 'special', 'features', 'make', 'up', 'part', 'movie', 'might', 'let', 'down', 'Pitt', 'annoying', 'times', 'Bana', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'counter', 'part', 'Prince', 'Hector', 'missed', 'cast', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'Bloom', 'off', 'too', 'weak', 'role', 'Paris', 'really', 'got', 'wonder', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'throw', 'off', 'wall', 'when', 'Greek', 'army', 'first', 'showed', 'up', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'cast', 'Bloom', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'using', 'bow', 'everyone', 'would', 'compare', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'good', 'Helen', 'really', 'just', 'trophy', 'movie', 'never', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'character', 'mini', 'series', 'did', 'Overall', 'would', 'say', 'Troy', 'up', 'other', 'epics', 'such', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'other', 'recent', 'retellings', 'classics', 'such', 'horrible', 'King', 'Arthur', 'adaptation', 'water', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'big', 'epic', 'story', 'huge', 'stars', 'tradition', 'classic', 'Hollywood']",N/A

I really enjoyed it a LOT.However there are some departures from the epic poem that inspired it.  Mainly the Gods have been nixed, so they are only mentioned in passing as religious icons and not nearly as involved as they are in the myth.  However this brings the story to a more earthly level and makes it more believable as something that could have really happened.  Furthermore despite Agamemnon being ruthless and power-hungry, there are no clear good or bad guys in this story, as it should be.  It's like a real war, two sides of warriors who don't want to fight are forced into the situation by the powers that be.Despite the changes in story-line, the core elements of the story are still there in their over-dramatic glory.  The horrors of war! The tragedy of love!I'm a Brad Pitt fan and I can't fight it...he was just the perfect person to play the arrogant Achilles.  And the fighting style Achilles is given is realistic yet still amazing.  It's not impossibly silly Hong-Kong Kung Fu but the way he moves makes you believe he could have been the greatest warrior.  This coupled by the fact that Pitt can act...KICK ASS!  The rest of the cast is well chosen and give quality performances.If you're one of those people who can't handle it when tragic things happen to good people..don't watch this movie.

852362,AEYJGHIDOO6GE,B0002Z0EXQ,rainforest,"[5, 8]","I'm not as familiar with this story as the other reviewers here, but I have read all the classic Greek myths when I was little. So even I have forgotten most of the stories, but part of the stories are still in my mind, and it helped me understanding the storyline of the movie. Fortunately, my favorite character, Achilles, is the one that I still remember. I remember after he was born, his mother, Thetis, wanted to make him immortal. She held him by one heel and immersed him in the river Styx. Since her hand held his heel, the magic water did not touch it. Therefore, his heel remained mortal. In order to kill him, one had to hurt his heel.The Trojan War lasted about 10 years, however, in this movie, they seemed to have shortened the war in just a week or so. I don't know if Achilles was a handsome guy. But after watching this movie, I believe he must have been. Brad Pitt was charming and he was also a leading man in this movie. I enjoyed watching him fighting and talking. But the love story between him and Briseis was lame. I don't know how a man as charming and proud as Achilles would fall in love with her. At first, I thought he was just flirting because he was bored. When I saw the end, Achilles died for the reason of this woman because he was looking for her in order to save her while the city of Troy was smashed down, I thought that went a bit too far and was not believable. A woman shouldn't be the reason for his death. He should have died for a more glorious reason.I also liked Hector, played by Eric Bana. Hector was a loving, responsible son, father, husband, brother, and Prince. Eric Bana made me believe he was Hector.They have excluded all the Gods that originally were in Homer's Iliad. I think it's better to do it this way. It makes it more historical; makes it like it had happened 3000 years ago. Otherwise, it would become another Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. I liked it more than Gladiator. Gladiator was too violent. Originally, I thought this movie must be too, but it turned out not so bad. The fighting was quick and not too bloody. It focuses more on love and passion.",5,Good enough to watch...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2124,"[""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'read', 'classic', 'Greek', 'myths', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'So', 'even', 'have', 'forgotten', 'most', 'stories', 'part', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'mind', 'helped', 'understanding', 'storyline', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'favorite', 'character', 'Achilles', 'one', 'still', 'remember', 'remember', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'Thetis', 'wanted', 'make', 'immortal', 'held', 'one', 'heel', 'immersed', 'river', 'Styx', 'hand', 'held', 'heel', 'magic', 'water', 'did', 'not', 'touch', 'Therefore', 'heel', 'remained', 'mortal', 'order', 'kill', 'one', 'had', 'hurt', 'heel.The', 'Trojan', 'War', 'lasted', '10', 'years', 'however', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'shortened', 'war', 'just', 'week', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Achilles', 'was', 'handsome', 'guy', 'watching', 'movie', 'believe', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'charming', 'was', 'also', 'leading', 'man', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'fighting', 'talking', 'love', 'story', 'Briseis', 'was', 'lame', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'man', 'charming', 'proud', 'Achilles', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'flirting', 'was', 'bored', 'When', 'saw', 'end', 'Achilles', 'died', 'reason', 'woman', 'was', 'looking', 'order', 'save', 'city', 'Troy', 'was', 'smashed', 'down', 'thought', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'woman', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'reason', 'death', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'more', 'glorious', 'reason.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Hector', 'played', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'was', 'loving', 'responsible', 'son', 'father', 'husband', 'brother', 'Prince', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'Hector.They', 'have', 'excluded', 'Gods', 'originally', 'were', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'think', 'better', 'do', 'way', 'more', 'historical', 'had', 'happened', '3000', 'years', 'ago', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'become', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'liked', 'more', 'Gladiator', 'Gladiator', 'was', 'too', 'violent', 'Originally', 'thought', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'too', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'fighting', 'was', 'quick', 'not', 'too', 'bloody', 'more', 'love', 'passion']",N/A

The film focuses in on the human reality of the war and the devestating battles which took place.  I was completely thrilled to see that this film DID NOT try to explain Achilies as a God, or immortal, or explain that he was dipped in a pool of immortality... thank you!

I don't want anyone dying for me. ~BriseisIf you have yet to view the greatest war story of all time, I would highly recommend listening to Robert Fagles translation on audio cassette. While it takes 9 hours to listen to the story, your viewing experience of this movie will be greatly enhanced. The original story seems to imply that the cause of the war is more of a game between the gods on Olympus. The participation of the gods is hinted at throughout the movie and in the ""Gallery of God"" extra feature, but never truly explored. Did Aphrodite offer Paris the love of Helen? Who was actually plotting the destruction of Troy? Is the war simply a game between the gods?With this in mind, it is no wonder that the love between Paris and Helen pales in comparison to all the other themes of love in this movie. It is sweet and romantic, but we never learn enough about either character to become emotionally attached. The love story between Briseis and Achilles seems much more compelling, as is the love between Hector and his wife.There are three main love stories between the main male characters and their chosen women. Then, there is the love of a brother, the love of power, the love of peace, the love of a king for his son and the love men have for their country. This movie is filled with love as the underlying force motivating the actions of men. Most of the women endure great emotional suffering and Helen is presented as a woman who wants to make the right choice, but can't seem to break free from Paris.When I listened to the Iliad on tape, I considered how violent this would be when it was made into a movie. The brutality in the story tends to explode in a similar way to how the fight scenes appear onscreen. The savage energy becomes very primal and yet the brutality is somehow soothed by the use of special effects. At times the movie relapses into a wrestle mania mode for comic relief, but overall this is a very serious movie complete with realistic action and impressive fireballs hurtling across sand dunes. I loved the excitement of the impending doom produced by horses galloping on the sand and the contrast of the war against the peaceful azure sky and sea.Throughout the movie we are presented with two perspectives and frankly we grow to love characters on both sides of this war. As Achilles calls for his men to fight for immortality, Hector appeals to his men to fight for Troy, ""mother to us all.""The brutal war scenes with magnificent swords and armor seem to take up most of the movie, although there are a few moments of romance. While women are viewed as prizes of war, Achilles actually fights for Briseis and seems to have genuine affection for her. Brad Pitt's fight scenes are quite enjoyable to watch from a ""superhero"" perspective. The way he fights is unique and therefore quite fascinating. After watching many of his movies, I can't think of anyone more perfect to play Achilles. He has the ability to alternate between extreme violence and tenderness. In this man, a lover resides. It does seem that at times he would rather be a lover than a fighter because he wants to return home. His confrontation with King Priam was well worth waiting for and is quite profound when you truly consider the moment of understanding between enemies.Peter O'Toole (Trojan King Priam) steals the movie with his amazing facial expressions. His look of desperation as he prays in the temple and his look of absolute terror when Hector and Achilles fight is stunning in its emotional impact. These seem to be the pivotal points in the movie and his acting helps to set the mood and add stability to the instability of war.I must say that while I prefer the travels in the Odyssey to a war, it is the heart of the Iliad and the romance in the movie version that fully captured my attention. We are only left wondering about the cost of love and a little worried that maybe the gods were having a bit too much fun while this movie was being made. The special features are very revealing and it is amazing they finished this movie.As someone who doesn't appreciate war movies, I was highly impressed with TROY and watched it twice in 24 hours. The themes reverberate down through the ages and this adaptation makes Homer's Iliad very palatable for today's audience. I had very low expectations and now I wish I had seen this sooner. Even if this is not a perfect version, I enjoy variety in a story and it is more a change in perspective than a complete reordering of the underlying elements. I think they could have made this movie even more enjoyable with less war scenes and a little more intrigue and humor, especially involving the gods. Although it did keep my attention for almost 3 hours, twice.The true irony in this movie is that when Paris finally makes a good judgment call; no one listens to him. Also...what makes ""this"" Helen worth dying for? I'd love to know more about her character and why Paris fell in love with Helen in the first place. The plot is fairly simple and if you crave complete accuracy and complexity, I'd recommend listening to the audio version or reading a translation.~The Rebecca Review",5,A Vivid Interpretation of

This is truly a film of grandeur that deserves to be called an epic. Wolfgang Peterson's masterful direction, James Horner's superb score, a very literate script and an outstanding cast, ""Troy"" takes its place with ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"", and ""Gladiator"" as one of the best of the genre.For those critical of Pitt's performance as ""Achilles"", I say that the actor shows that he possesses the acting ""muscle"" to coincide with the beefed up physique for this challenging role. Eric Bana's is quite sympathetic as ""Hector"", a prince of Troy forced into battle because of younger brother Paris's (Orlando Bloom) obsession with the beautiful, and very much married, ""Helen"" of Sparta (the visually-stunning Dianne Kruger).Veterans Peter O'Toole (""King Priam"") and Brian Cox (the power-hungry ""Agamemnon"") are brilliant in their respective roles. Bloom's ""Lord of the Rings"" co-star Sean Bean is also effective as ""Odysseus"", brainchild behind the infamous Trojan horse of historical fame.And any movie that features the classy Julie Christie in the small yet memorable role of Pitt's ""mom"" is destined for greatness.""Troy"" may run almost three hours but it's time well spent.I, for one, can't wait for the DVD.

852373,A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ,B0002Z0EXQ,"R. Gorham ""RCG2""","[4, 4]","OVERVIEW: Most national newspaper reviews were average at best for ""Troy"" (2004). I went into this movie not expecting much - which was probably the best way to go. I had several years of latin & mythology in high school and college and liked the subject matter in general (though I don't claim to be a Greek historian as some writers here seem to be). I knew most of the players here, but I don't think it's essential to know them going in. You quickly know that this movie is depicting a battle between two very distinct sides (Greeks vs Trojans). I think if you enjoy movies and like to be entertained by Hollywood - you'll enjoy ""Troy"". However, if you go into this film expecting things to unfold how historian's have documented - you'll be sorely disappointed. This is the Reader's Digest 'condensed' version of a 10 year war - taking place over about 2 weeks. ""Troy"" fits in nicely with the other ancient era/period movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Clash Of The Titans"", ""Spartacus"", ""Ulysses"", ""Hercules"", ""The Odyssey"", ""Jason & The Argonauts"", ""Gladiator"", and even Marlon Brando's ""Julius Caesar"".THE GOOD: Director Wolfgang Peterson (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Air Force One"", ""Das Boot"", ""In The Line Of Fire"") has the reputation for making a good action film. He does not disappoint in making ""Troy"". There are some truly great battle scenes featured here; a great fight between the lead characters of the Greek Achilles and the Trojan Hector. There is also some wonderful scenery - the vast many ships out on the Aegean Sea, the huge walls around the city of Troy, the sweeping shots of the armies on the beach as well as outside the great entrance to Troy's city. The male cast is exceptional. Brad Pitt as the ultimate warrior Achilles; Eric Bana as the patriotic Hector; Orlando Bloom perfectly playing wimpy Paris; Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam; Brian Cox as the loathsome Greek King Agamemnon; Sean Bean as supportive Odysseus. The story revolves around Paris stealing Menelaus' wife (Helen) and bringing her back to Troy. Menelaus wants her back and decides to go to his brother (Agamemnon) to fight for her. Turns out Agamemnon isn't so much in it for his brother as much as he wants to conquer Troy itself. Enter Paris running away from Menelaus, Hector killing Menelaus, Agamemnon declaring war, lots of fighting, a Trojan Horse, a city on fire, and so on. History books tell us the Trojan War lasted 10 years. ""Troy"" appears to last about 2 weeks. While there were some great scenes in ""Troy"" - Achilles battling Hector, King Priam sneaking into Achilles tent and asking for his dead son's body back for a proper burial, the hundreds of ships in the Aegean Sea arriving on the Trojan shores, the whole Trojan horse scene - there are several things that prevent me from giving this movie a higher rating.THE NOT SO GOOD: Brad Pitt was good, but not great. Some of his lines were just not convincing. His choreographed fight scenes seemed somewhat labored. His death scene was uneventful. His pecks and abs looked fine (as my wife would agree). Pitt was no Russell Crowe (in ""Gladiator""), or Mel Gibson (in ""Braveheart"")... not even close. I like Pitt, and loved his lunacy in ""Fight Club"", ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Seven"" - perhaps ""Troy"" was too 'calm' for him. Most of the females in this movie were disappointing. The main female was Helen (Diane Kruger). A somewhat limp and feeble woman - I was expecting a stronger character role here - one that wasn't so love-struck or sobbing so dang much. As good as Brian Cox was as Agamemnon, I felt he was too short for this movie. Anything I've ever read in mythology said Agamemnon was monsterous in size. I recognized several 2nd and 3rd tier actors in ""Troy"" that had played supporting roles in the similar era/period type movies ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"". The soundtrack was also very reminiscent of ""Gladiator"". The 2-disc DVD set was overkill. I guess with 2 discs, I somehow expect a boat-load of extras. Not so here - the six DVD extras here total about 50 minutes. Included is the trailer, a language choice selection, ""Gallery Of the Gods"" (giving a brief history lesson on 12 Greek Gods - from Apollo to Zeus), a battle and a historical perspective, and a special effects odyssey (rubber swords et all). While the DVD extras were good and gave a keen look inside the making of the film, they were by no mean extensive. All of this could have easily fit on one disc. At 162 minutes, prepare for a good sit with plenty of popcorn and a Coke. ""Troy"" falls into the ranks of the mega-blockbusters with its $200+ million budget. It did well at the box office for several weeks, but then fell way short of it's projected in take ($)... thus, in my prediction, dooming it come Oscar time (3.5 stars).",3,10 year war condensed to 2

It is also unique in that Pitt accomplishes a believeable rendering of the god/man Achilles, giving a Hamlet quality to Achilles that I found interesting. Pitt convincingly portrays the character's awakening to his destiny in parallel to his awakening to his humanity.The acting and directing are done with economy, aided by an outstanding performance by Peter O'Toole.  The story proceeds on its own steam, does not get sidetracked by trying to be historically accurate, and the action seldom lags.  Bana gives an excellent and understated performance as Hector.  You can feel his stomach churn when his sound judgment is ignored due to pernicious influence of the court soothsayers over his father Priam [O'Toole].One obvious knock-off was the close resemblance of the Troy's soundtrack to the Gladiator soundtrack. Close your eyes and you expect to see Russell Crowe when you open them.The casting of Helen was weak.

I hadn't read any reviews going into this movie and didn't know the premise or what to expect, other than it was starring Bradd Pitt and Orlando Bloom of Lord of the Rings fame. This movie had me intrigiued since the beginning. In the beginning, 2 battling kingdoms decided to settle a war based on the outcome of the best warrior from each kingdom. So along comes Brad Pitt as Achilles. When I compared Brad Pitt to the warrior he was about to face, I was questioning whether Brad Pitt could successfully convince me that he was a great warrior such as Achilles. However, after the opening scene, my doubts were subsided. Brad Pitt was magnificent. Now, my memory of greek mythology has faded over the years, and the best I can recall of Achilles was that he was invincible in all parts of his body other than the heels from which his mother held him to dip him some magical water. And the movie didn't expand on the past of Achilles or even reveal that he had only one vulnerability. However, this didn't effect my enjoyment of the movie. I'm not sure whether someone familar with greek mythology would be bothered by this exclusion, but for me, it wasn't an issue.

852380,A3S75QQLGAOOAO,B0002Z0EXQ,Rick Darby,"[0, 0]","Is it good account of Homer's tale? Of course not. Still, to be fair, the movie is called ""Troy,"" not ""The Iliad."" The credits even say that it was ""inspired"" by the Iliad (an exaggeration; the movie, though often effective, is hardly inspired).Judged in cinematic, not literary or historical terms, though, ""Troy"" is by no means the complete turkey that most reviewers pronounced it. The director, Wolfgang Peterson, doesn't do much that is memorable with the cast-of-thousands scenes (with their rather obvious computerized effects), but imparts some dignity and occasional grandeur to the more intimate and solemn moments. The costuming is striking and vivid without being too extravagant, and while the Egyptian-like sets of the city have provoked much scorn and are no doubt anachronistic, we don't know what the Troy of circa 1200 BC looked like, so what's the big deal? The sets, particularly the interiors, are evocative, as is the score, surprisingly exotic and spare for a ""big"" popular movie.True, the dialogue is generally undistinguished and trite, and the casting includes a few damp squibs such as the amateurish Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus and an overly pompous Peter O'Toole as King Priam. But some of the acting is right on the money. Casting the great Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a smart move, and Sean Bean as Odysseus steals every scene he's in. Orlando Bloom conveys Paris's charm and impetuosity, offset by callowness. Eric Bana gives the role of Hector the authority that is needed to pull it off.Saffron Burrows, as Andromache, and Rose Byrne, as Briseis, also distinguish themselves. Diane Kruger (Helen) is not a polished actress, but she has a rare beauty, and the costumer has added to her allure. You believe that this is a face to launch a thousand ships.Brad Pitt as Achilles is, I think, the film's main weakness. His performance is all sensitive-hulk notes. You're not drawn beneath the surface; he doesn't project what it was in Achilles's character that made him the central figure in an epic.The scriptwriter had a serious problem on his hands -- making the status of Briseis and the actions of Paris acceptable to modern audiences. In the Iliad, Briseis is -- in line with the mores of the Bronze Age  -- no more than a captured slave, a bit of crumpet who precipitates the great stand-off between Achilles and Agamemnon but is otherwise unimportant. Brad Pitt could hardly be portrayed as a brute arguing over a slave girl, so in this version Briseis is a ""priestess of Apollo,"" and Achilles's love interest.Paris couldn't be presented as a royal yob dragging Helen off to Troy by the hair, so this movie gives us the two as hot young love birds.(And to ward off any suspicions of a homosexual attraction between Achilles and Patroclus, they have been made into ""cousins."")So I can understand why lovers of the Iliad would find this something of a travesty, and there are other mistakes, such as turning Agamemnon into such an unsympathetic rotter that it destroys the tragic element of two great figures locked in a clash of wills. (And having Briseis [!] slit Agamemnon's throat in the midst of the Greeks' overrunning Troy deprives Aeschylus of some of his best source material.)But while the movie is in no way on a par with reading Richmond Lattimore's translation of the Iliad, or probably any other translation, it has its pleasures. Take it for what it is.The letterboxed DVD is an excellent transfer, with richly glowing, natural colors and sound to match.

On the side of Greece, is the near-invincible Achilles played by Brad Pitt. Achilles despises power-hungry Agamemnon, the King of Kings of Greece. Achilles, it appears, fights for no reason. Not for love, not for loyalty, and especially not for Agamemnon. He fights because that is what he is born to do.On the side of Troy is Hector (played by The Incredible Hulk's Eric Bana), a family man and the prince of Troy. Greece declares war on Troy when Hector's younger brother, Paris (played by LOTR's star Orlando Bloom), takes Helena as his bride. (Helena, you see, is Agamemnon's brother's wife.) Hector understands the reasons for the war and this makes him leery, but it doesn't dampen his desire to fight for Troy. He is the son of Troy, and he will protect it to the death.In the middle of this war, Achilles refuses to fight after a dispute with Agamemnon until tragedy strikes. Achilles, filled with blood thirsty revenge, challenges Hector to a fight to the death. In victory, Achilles desecrates Hector's body for all to see. It is from this point that this 2-hour and 30-minute movie begins its race to the finish. A wooden horse shows up, a city is burned, and Prince Paris finds Achilles' weak spot. (If this is a surprise to you, brush up on your Greek history & mythology).Troy is a non-stop movie filled with short monologues; cute, sweaty, muscled men; and wide-scale epic battle sequences that rival both Gladiator and The Last Samurai combined. The operatic scores brings dramatic tension to the well-shot battle scenes, which are choreographed to near perfection. Brian Cox is wonderfully evil as Agamemnon. Sean Bean is convincing as the clever Odysseus. And Eric Bana gives depth and emotion to the internally-tortured Hector.But alas, the movie belongs to Brad Pitt as the brooding, moody, pr**k who is Achilles. Whatever training and preparation Pitt had to become Achilles pays off in this flick. As the great warrior, he slays his opponents with fluid motions and with the flare of a man whose skill is killing. The training also shows on Pitt's wonderfully chiseled body (excuse my drool), which is naked almost as much as it is dressed. (my hormones are a-jumping.)This movie lived up to and exceeded my expectations.

852383,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0002Z0EXQ,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[13, 18]","Where to begin? Wolfgang Peterson's film ""Troy"" is rumoured to be one of the most expensive movies ever made at a whopping US$200 million, based on the famous Homer's ""Iliad"". The story is legendary: Prince Paris steals away Queen Helen, the wife of Menelaus, taking her back to the great citadel of Troy. The injured Menelaus unites with his brother Agamemnon and the allied kingdoms, in order to reclaim Helen and burn Troy to the ground.In an epic so huge, it was obvious that certain components had to be omitted or changed. With this in mind, I was already reconciled to the fact that the gods would not be present and that the ten year siege would be condensed into only two weeks. Other changes however, are less excuseable - many characters who should live are killed off, and many who should meet their deaths manage to escape. The fates of the main players in the love triangle are especially incorrect: Menelaus originally succeeds in recapturing Helen, but here he is killed early on, whilst Helen manages to escape from the burning city, and one presumes that she and Paris re-meet in the countryside to enjoy a typical happy-ending. Never mind the fact that Paris was originally killed in battle so long before the sack of Troy that Helen had time to be married off to another of Priam's sons! So although the basics of the war are still in place, the movie becomes more and more liberal as it draws to an close, making it eventually unrecognisable to scholars. Sometimes film-makers can get away with changes to tradition, if only they compensate with good, solid storytelling. Peterson only partically gets away with his dramatic liberties.Sean Bean as Odysseus is pretty much spot-on, and Eric Bana steals the show as the noble, heroic Hector, weighed down by honour and duty to his family and city. Much ado has been given about Peter O'Toole as Priam, but consider this: throughout the movie he is given three choices to make - should Troy return Helen? Should Troy attack the Greeks in the morning? Should they bring the horse into Troy? All three times he makes the wrong decision! Therefore, his key scene when he begs Achilles for the body of his son was somewhat dimished for me in light of his consistent stupidity.The casting of Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships"", was always going to be difficult. On the whole, Diane Kruger does reasonably well, but it never helps when the leading lady is eclipsed by her co-stars (it reminded me of in ""A Knight's Tale"", where Jocelyn is introduced as the fairest of them all, only to look homely next to Kate the lowly blacksmith). In any case, as the daughter of Zeus, Helen needed an aura, a divine-quality to her that simply wasn't captured - and the fact that she soon drops from the action doesn't help much either. Orlando Bloom as Paris is debatable - some have critised him for his cowadice, but don't seem to realise that Paris *was* a coward, even more so than what is presented here! In fact, one of the most oddly moving scenes for me was when he gave into his fear of death and crawled pitifully back to clasp big brother's feet.And then of course there's Brad Pitt as Achilles, playing a character that is either too complicated to understand, or too shallow to be taken seriously - I couldn't figure out which one it was! After safely introducing Patroclus as his cousin (when some versions have him as his lover), Achilles travels to Troy in search of everlasting glory (encouraged by a brief cameo by Julie Christie as his mother). However, a run in with Agamemnon (played far too over-the-top by Brian Cox) over a captive Brisius leaves him sulking in his tent until Patroclus is killed. His true motivations are always murky, but hey, whether you like him or not, you have to admit that he certainly *looks* the part of the blonde, buff Achilles.In terms of visual beauty, ""Troy"" is a stunner - the epic scale of Troy and the battlefield is realised, and the show-down between Hector and Achilles in particular is riveting. Almost every actor is extremely good-looking, and CGI figures blended seamlessly with the real thing. Yet, all the action sequences in the world can't make up for quiet moments in between, made up of clumsy, often silly dialogue that carry nothing of the weight of Homer's ""Iliad"".In brief: it irritated me that the word ""Greeks"" was used so often (there was no such *thing* as Greece until several hundred years later), and the silly love story between Brisius and Achilles, and the passion between Paris and Helen (which was originally a lust story, not a love story) took too much away from the true lovers of the ""Iliad"" - the unassuming domestic bliss between Hector and Andromache. There is a nice nod to scholars with the appearance of Aeneas fleeing the city, and I was amazed that the baby son of Hector looked directly at his father before the battle - how did they do that?!Basically, ""Troy"" is a good movie, worth the price of admission, but with the money and actors involved, it should have been a fantastic one.",3,"""The Gods Envy Us...""",1084492800,"05 14,

Praise the gods for DVD! TROY is far and beyond my expectations. So let's compare the critics to the movie:1) It doesn't make the war last ten years so its not faithful to Homer. Hey, Was Homer there??? I don't think so. The War's progession is logical to battle and works with the story. So the ""brevity"" of the War is no big deal.2) The gods aren't in this so the purpose and the motivation of The Illiad is lost. OK, so the gods aren't flying around like a Ray Harryhausen flick (many of which I am very fond of). The gods are spoken of and discussed, developing characterization and motivation. They are unseen, except as idols: isn't that more realistic?3) Brad Pitt doesn't work as Achilles. Absolutely untrue. When Pitt puts on his helmet, his eyes take on a wild animal glare. Otherwise, his looks work surprisingly well for Achilles, because he has an unusual face. He is certainly believable as a classical Greek demi-god.4) Diane Kruger isn't beautiful enough to launch a Thousand Ships. Come on! Who in reality is? This Helen is really hot! Give her a break.5) Orlando Bloom doesn't impress. Ditto as said for Brad Pitt. Orlando looks his best since his LOTR glory days. He is a GREAT Paris. And he even gets to use his archery skills again.6) Troy is a disappointment. On the contrary, I found it both epic and thoughtful. Peter O'Toole gets decent screen time and is wonderful. Eric Bana humanizes Hector and thereby contrasts him with Achilles, who remains somewhat aloof and superhuman. The death scene of Achilles is ingenious as it creates a believable assumption for his mythic demise. Overall, I could only ask for a longer film.",5,"Troy it, You'll Like it.",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1768,"['Once', 'again', 'critics', 'have', 'influenced', 'miss', 'cinematic', 'adventure', 'should', 'have', 'experienced', 'movie', 'theater', 'Praise', 'gods', 'DVD', 'TROY', 'far', 'expectations', 'So', 'let', 'compare', 'critics', 'movie:1', ""n't"", 'make', 'war', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'not', 'faithful', 'Homer', 'Hey', 'Was', 'Homer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'War', 'progession', 'logical', 'battle', 'story', 'brevity', 'War', 'big', 'deal.2', 'gods', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'purpose', 'motivation', 'Illiad', 'lost', 'OK', 'gods', 'are', ""n't"", 'flying', 'around', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'flick', 'many', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'gods', 'are', 'spoken', 'discussed', 'developing', 'characterization', 'motivation', 'are', 'unseen', 'idols', ""n't"", 'more', 'realistic', '3', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ""n't"", 'work', 'Achilles', 'Absolutely', 'untrue', 'When', 'Pitt', 'helmet', 'eyes', 'take', 'wild', 'animal', 'glare', 'Otherwise', 'looks', 'work', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Achilles', 'unusual', 'face', 'certainly', 'believable', 'classical', 'Greek', 'demi-god.4', 'Diane', 'Kruger', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'enough', 'launch', 'Thousand', 'Ships', 'Come', 'Who', 'reality', 'Helen', 'really', 'hot', 'Give', 'break.5', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', ""n't"", 'impress', 'Ditto', 'said', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Orlando', 'best', 'LOTR', 'glory', 'days', 'GREAT', 'Paris', 'even', 'use', 'archery', 'skills', 'again.6', 'Troy', 'disappointment', 'contrary', 'found', 'epic', 'thoughtful', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'decent', 'screen', 'time', 'wonderful', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'thereby', 'Achilles', 'who', 'somewhat', 'aloof', 'superhuman', 'death', 'scene', 'Achilles', 'ingenious', 'believable', 'assumption', 'mythic', 'demise', 'Overall', 'could', 'only', 'ask', 'longer', 'film']",N/A
852386,A23VTC6VKNFZVE,B0002Z0EXQ,Robert D. Williams,"[1, 1]","This movie is a sprawling epoch from ancient Greece and Turkey. This is Brad Pitt at his best, who got really pumped up for the part.  Eric Bana plays a great supporting role as Hector, tamer of horses, and the rest of the cast, from Peter O'toole as King Priam on down play superb roles too. The battle scenes are very realistic.  Pitt shows great athletic skill in his fight with Hector and the trojans. Taken from the pages of Homer's Iliad, the story dates back 33 centuries when Helen, Diane Kruger, a Spartan queen becomes abducted by Paris, Orlando Bloom, a trojan prince.  King Agamemnon, Brendan Gleeson, agrees to help his brother, Menelaus, Helen's husband, to get her back.  His real motive, however, is to take Troy and control the Aegean Sea.  Unable to defeat troy's defences, the Greeks resort to trickery and employ a giant hollow horse to gain admittance to the city.  Troy was actually a real city and was rediscovered in the late 1800s by an archaeologist named Heinrick Schlieman.  The entire movie from beginning to end is awesome and breathtaking.

852387,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B0002Z0EXQ,Robert Graves,"[4, 6]","First, I should mention that I am not in any way a classical historian, nor do I have any aspirations to be one. So any criticisms I make of this film are almost purely from the cinematic angle, not a historical purist one. This film, in fact, is based on what may be a work of fiction about characters who may not have ever existed - so I don't really have a huge problem with the filmmakers diverging from the primary source, Homer's ""Iliad,"" and I as I understand it, there *were* serious divergences.The film recounts the ultimate epic story and tries to do so on the ultimate epic scale. The problem is that LOTR has spoiled us all. Five years ago this would've been the most amazing thing anyone had ever seen, but after watching 100,000 soldiers fight on the fields of Gondor, Troy feel low-budget. We see the famed battle of Troy, where the Trojan Horse allegedly was conceived. After Helen (Diane Kruger), purportedly the most beautiful woman alive, escapes Greece with her lover Paris, a prince of Troy, she is pursued by her former husband Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon. Together they launch a war on Troy, which in Homer's story lasted ten years, but in the movie lasts about a week. There are battles galore, worship of the Gods and plenty of Brad Pitt. I found the movie to be quite entertaining, but as my title suggests there was a pretty big problem with the storytelling.I don't have any issues that they drastically changed the storyline of The Iliad. After all, as I wrote earlier, it's not as if Homer was reporting facts in his epic work - he was writing a century after it all ""happened"" - so this isn't like retelling WW2. We're talking about a war that may not have even happened, and up until a few dozen years ago scholars were *positive* it didn't happen. So I don't think we need to be all that loyal to the source when the ""source"" is pretty dubious to begin with. What I do have a problem with, is that in the changes they made they couldn't manage to give us a clear protagonist. If you're gonna change the story so much that characters who are supposed to live die, and characters who are supposed to die live, then why not give us a storyline to get behind? Orlando Bloom as Paris is completely unlikable, looking far more like Cupid with his little bow and arrow than a prince. In fact, the whole war was for his greed - hard to root for him. Peter O'Toole as Priam is portrayed as a fairly foolish king, Achilles (Brad Pitt) is a reckless, self-indulgent warrior who is only after his own glory, and Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is the Hitler of the early Mediterranean. That only leaves Eric Bana as Hector, who is great but doesn't stick around too long. I just didn't know whom to root for. All the characters were so flawed that you couldn't possibly get behind any of them and want them to ""win."" By the end of the movie I was not really invested and was simply curious to see how they would end it, rather than hoping the ""good guys"" would win - there just weren't any good guys.Furthermore, the ""epicness"" of the film truly suffers since they crammed the entire 10-year war into a week. Movie-goers will leave wondering how what was basically a week-long skirmish managed to make its way into the history books.The film has other serious problems. For one, the characters all seem to be very well aware of their place in history. If I heard ""our names will be remembered for a thousand years"" one more time, it would've turned into a comedy. The filmmakers wanted to treat these characters as though the characters had already read about themselves in Homer's writing, self-aware that they were great heroes who would be remembered long into the future. They repeatedly rammed it down our throats that ""our names will be remembered, our names will be remembered"" ad nauseum. A simple and opposite wry statement like ""these days will not be remembered by any who weren't here"" would've gotten far more mileage than the method they chose.The acting was fine, but the dialogue was awful. Again - not a historian - but when Helen uttered the line ""Don't play with me, don't play,"" to Paris, I did laugh. Modern street talk didn't seem to go well with classical accents, which were indiscriminately turned on and off by both Diane Kruger and Brad Pitt.Because the cinematography was so great, you should see this in a theater. The music leaves something to be desired. It's mostly a Gladiator rip, with the woman moaning over the dark symphony, except Gladiator actually sounds good. This woman sounds like a dying animal in spots, and it's rather distracting from the film.The one interesting thing I really took away was our place in history. America is a few hundred years old. That is just a page in the history books of these other parts of the world. It's amazing to think of the treasures scattered through the Aegean Sea from countless shipwrecks dating back five, six - maybe even seven thousand years ago. That's hard to comprehend for a country not even 300 years old. Did you know Greece won't let divers into the Aegean Sea because they know how much is buried there? Purportedly, the ocean floor is littered with gold and jewels from ancient kingdoms.Anyway, I digress. I recommend seeing it, but go for entertainment, not historical accuracy - not that you should ever see a movie for historical accuracy; you can stay home and watch the History Channel for that. Just be aware that you may have a hard time latching onto a character to invest in for the three-hour epic length.",3,"Even with all the heroes, there's no, um...hero.",1084752000,"05 17,

852388,AFLTHO3MB4825,B0002Z0EXQ,Robert J. Willert,"[0, 4]","having read Homer's THE ILIAD, director Wolfgang Peterson's epic film doesn't pretend to be exactly like the poem. Instead, Peterson takes plenty of artistic license. It is clear that Peterson wanted his movie to be entertaining (ala 'Gladiator') AND true to Homer's story. Unfortunately he lost his way near the end.But first let's examine the characters:Brad Pitt is Achilles. Some have said he was miscast. Who else could play Achilles with the emotions he did? The anger and sadness and ruthlessness all bottled up inside this tragic hero? Achilles is not a one-dimensional character (ala Steve Reeves). Pitt portrayed a complex war hero. A man only his mother (Goddess Thetis could love and understand). He menacing hatred for King Agamemnon was genuine. How else would an actor play Achilles (we are not talking Hamlet or King Lear). It was one of Pitt's better performances.Another actor who does a good job is Eric Bana as Hector. A more subtle approach to his character. Husband and father, he is the reluctant hero for the Trojans. Bana was perfectly cast. No match for Achilles, he still fights the Greek war hero. Bana is wonderful to watch.Peter O'Toole as King Priam (Troy's king) also gives a standout performance. And Brian Cox as the hated King Aggamemnon is meaner than a rattlesnake, and very effective.The battle sequences are effective, especially the first battle involving Achilles and his men arriving on the shores of Troy. Peterson really catches the fierceness of hand to hand combat with arrows and spears and swords. If you saw the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan' and it's version of D-Day, war is just as intense in Peterson's stagings here.If there are weaknesses in the film, and there are many, it concerns some of the other characters. For example.Helen of Troy. It is a thankless role that Diane Kruger plays. King Menalaus, her husband. There is little substance to his character. We don't care about what happens to him. Achilles has fallen for a Trojan girl (cousin to Hector). She gives a fine performance, but the role could have easily been cut from the film. Orlando Bloom's Paris is weak, as he should be. Paris, brother to Hector, runs from a dual with Menalaus. And it is he winds up shooting Achilles in the heal with his arrow. More on that in a second. Hector's wife had little to say or do. And Peterson never reveals much history about Troy or its adversary, the Greeks. For those who were not familiar with this famous war, a brief history lesson might have been helpful.Odysseus (Ulysses if you're Roman - Sean Bean) was not seen very often. But it was he who created the idea of the Trojan Horse. Peterson instead decided to concentrate all of his efforts of Achilles, in effect causing inaccuracies throughout the film. For example:When Paris and Helen run away to Troy, the Greek Armada attack. It is to become a 10 year war, with many of the more famous cast of characters still alive to see the burning of Troy. The Gods play a big part in the sacking of Troy, and defending it. Because Achilles has insulted Apollo, it is Apollo who guides Paris' arrow when Achilles get hit in the heal. When Achilles was dipped into the River Styx as a child by his mother, Goddess Thetis, his body became invulnerable, all except the heal she had held him with. Paris kills him not long after the death of Hector. After killing Achilles, Paris is also killed by Greek hero and strongman Ajax who would go on to take his own life after Odysseus won Achilles' armor and not him (in the movie Ajax is killed early in the film). When Odysseus constructs the Trojan Horse, Paris is already dead as is Achilles (in the movie Achilles jumps out of the horse with the other Greeks and Paris is waiting to kill him). King Priam does indeed die during the burning of Troy, but Aggamemnon does not die. Helen survives and returns to Sparta. And Odysseus is the main character in Homer's second epic, THE ODYSSEY. The ending seemed a little hurried.But considering what Peterson chose to work with (unless he had wanted to make a 20-hour movie), ""Troy"" is one of the best war films to come out in the last decade because it seems real, as if I were watching fighting men on some contemporary battlefield. There is really a special feeling you get when you can imagine watching mythology come to life.

More than 4,000 years later, Peter O'Toole steals this film with one of his most thoughtful and sensitive performances in a supporting role as Priam, King of Troy. Thanks to modern digital technologies, the battle scenes are terrific. Most of the cast members are OK and I think director Wolfgang Petersen was wise to omit various gods and goddesses which Robert Wise saw fit to include in Helen of Troy (1955). Pitt is generally credible as the hubristic, athletic, sullen, and lethal Achilles...at least until he opens his mouth. Troy's greatest warrior, Hector, requires more than Eric Bana delivers. (I got the distinct feeling that Bana's Hector would be more comfortable in a cardigan sweater, smoking a pipe, than in armor and carving up opponents with a sword.) Sean Bean is quietly effective as Ulysses. It was a bold decision and, I think, a wrong one to have Orlando Bloom portray Paris as a confused wimp throughout most of the film. (I am not alone when reacting ""She ran off with HIM?"") Petersen gives Diane Kruger (as Helen) little to do which I also think was a mistake. Indeed, others in supporting roles are essentially decorative. Julie Christie appearing briefly as Thetis, for example. However, O'Toole's performance and the action scenes (including the plundering and destruction of Troy) enhance this otherwise unremarkable film. Also noteworthy is the revelation of Agamemnon's motives. Raging with righteous indignation, he publicly demands justice after his sister-in-law is ""stolen"" by Paris. He  organizes and leads an invasion force to reunite Helen with her husband. However, what we soon realize is that Agamemnon really wants Troy's wealth and, of even greater importance, Spartan control of the trade routes. This film lacks the depth, nuance, edge, and cohesion of other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, and even Gladiator but it does provide entertainment sufficient to earn a Four Star rating by this reviewer.",4,O'Toole's Brilliant Performance Adds a Star,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,2026,"['According', 'Homer', 'Paris', 'stole', 'Helen', 'King', 'Menelaus', 'Sparta', 'More', '4,000', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'film', 'one', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'supporting', 'role', 'Priam', 'King', 'Troy', 'Thanks', 'modern', 'digital', 'technologies', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'terrific', 'Most', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'OK', 'think', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'was', 'wise', 'omit', 'various', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'saw', 'fit', 'include', 'Helen', 'Troy', '1955', 'Pitt', 'generally', 'credible', 'hubristic', 'athletic', 'sullen', 'lethal', 'Achilles', 'least', 'mouth', 'Troy', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'Hector', 'more', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'delivers', 'got', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'cardigan', 'sweater', 'smoking', 'pipe', 'armor', 'carving', 'up', 'opponents', 'sword', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'quietly', 'effective', 'Ulysses', 'was', 'bold', 'decision', 'think', 'wrong', 'one', 'have', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'portray', 'Paris', 'confused', 'wimp', 'most', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'when', 'reacting', 'ran', 'off', 'HIM', 'Petersen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Helen', 'little', 'do', 'also', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'Indeed', 'others', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'essentially', 'decorative', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'appearing', 'briefly', 'Thetis', 'example', 'However', ""O'Toole"", 'performance', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'plundering', 'destruction', 'Troy', 'enhance', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'film', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'revelation', 'Agamemnon', 'motives', 'Raging', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'publicly', 'justice', 'sister-in-law', 'stolen', 'Paris', 'invasion', 'force', 'reunite', 'Helen', 'husband', 'However', 'what', 'soon', 'realize', 'Agamemnon', 'really', 'Troy', 'wealth', 'even', 'greater', 'importance', 'Spartan', 'control', 'trade', 'routes', 'film', 'depth', 'nuance', 'edge', 'cohesion', 'other', 'epics', 'such', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Spartacus', 'even', 'Gladiator', 'provide', 'entertainment', 'sufficient', 'earn', 'Four', 'Star', 'rating', 'reviewer']",N/A

The good doctor walked out in a huff after only an hour because he felt Homer's ""Iliad"" was being ""desecrated by Hollywood.""  We three stayed and enjoyed the movie.And I like the DVD even more.Wolfgang Peterson fully captures the grand scale of events that engage Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) lovers Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) in a war that launched a thousand ships to recover a pretty face.Admittedly, it's a little jarring accepting Pitt as Achilles. He's oiled up, precisely coiffed and often photographed in golden light like a pin up.  But he's very fine in the action scenes and choreographed battles -- especially the final duel with hector. And Pitt gives it his all and almost holds his own in an emotionally pivotal scene with Peter O'Toole.  Eric Bana is a much more forceful presence than Pitt but it's O'Toole who steals every scene he's in as Troy's King Priam.Surprisingly, there's no commentary from Peterson and stars Pitts and Bana. It wouldn't surprise me if there's a ""special colelctor's edition"" DVD coming out next year. I hope it includes something -- anything at all, really -- from Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie.Limited extras do include: ""In The Thick of Battle,"" a fine featurette on the battle sequences and the training of warrior extras. ""From Ruins to Reality"" explores how the remains of ancient Troy were unearthed and how the production designers created their own version of the legendary city.  ""Troy: An Effects Odyssey"" looks at some of the stunning visual effects and the creation of the effective sound design.  There's also a 3-D tour of Mount Olympus in the ""Gallery of the Gods"" where we meet the fabled Greek Gods that play an important part in Homer's poem but are missing (thankfully) from the movie.  There's a brief, informative monologue that goes with each semi animated god or goddess.Even with mixed reviews, ""Troy"" grossed over $491 million worldwide.  Not too bad.  The audience doesn't lie.And I bet Homer would approve of his 3,200 year old poem being part of our pop culture.

852396,A2E1QZ5YSHVQXL,B0002Z0EXQ,Rocky,"[1, 2]","When I heard of this film I thought it would be a flop honestly. I have had many bitter memories of watching great tales be torn to shreds when adapted to films, and I only tried this one out of sheer curiosity and love for the Illiad story. (And of coruse having Brad Pitt in it was a temptation as well.)I was left surprised at the end of this two- hour and some film nonetheless! The scenes were beautiful, the actors well picked for their characters, and the fight scenes were bold. I loved it when Brad Pitt would jump high in the air. It looked so dramatic. And Brad Pitt himself excellently portrayed the cocky, self- assured and yet self- destructive Achilles. Orlando Bloom was interesting as Paris, appearing as one of those men that are not fighters, but lovers. The others actors as well, including the actor whom played Hector, was fanatastic. I thought the actor for Helen was a bit paper- thin, but the rest of the cast leveled her out well. Overall this movie plays the very essence of the story of Troy very well, even if they do stray somewhat from the orginal Illiad, but they indeed did not tear it up like so many other movies do to legendary stories. I liked this movie very much, and that's why I give it four stars. Why not five? Well one because some parts of the movie did not fit the main storyline, but the major problem they lost a star was because of the ending. Right when Achilles died, that was the end of the movie? No. A few other things happened! They made it seem that right when Achilles died that was it, but the story continued on for a little longer. I didn't like that too well because people should know what happened afterwards, and a few things do. I guess what I can tell people who don't know the full story should read it, because other events happen after Achilles is killed.

852397,AK1OBVI54SY73,B0002Z0EXQ,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[1, 3]","I have to be honest. This movie was great, full of action and just enough drama to keep it the tragic story it is supposed to be. One of the better historical films I have witnessed...but there is a problem. This story was supposed to be more centered on the two lovers, Paris and Helen, and it wasn't. No they centered more on Achilles, Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is the bigger actor, so they of course wanted him to stay in the spotlight, and Brad Pitt did very well as Achilles. But I felt they should have made the situation between Paris and Helen more in the center of everything, since they are the ones who started this whole story. You see a lot more of Achilles and Hector though than Paris and Helen, and although like I said it makes it a very fascinating film, I still have to shave off a star because one of the things I wanted to see more of was this Paris and Helen situation more strongly than it was. Matter of fact they strengthened more on the relationship of Achilles and his eventual lover in the film than Paris and Helen.Yet I cannot hate this film. It was as I said exciting and the characters that played this film supported the movie. It is definitely one of the better films I have seen historically and I love how they played out the movie. I just wish they would have stayed focused a little better on Paris and Helen. Yet Brad Pitt made it a film to enjoy with him as the centerfold.I recommend this film over Gladiator, King Arthur, and Alexander. Troy is a lot more exciting of a film than any of these others.

852398,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002Z0EXQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","Wolfgang Peterson`s ""Troy"" is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned.  As is to be expected, ""Troy"" shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.On the positive side, ""Troy"" provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen.  It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see.  On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film.  The good news is that, for the most part, ""Troy"" manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.""Troy"" is based very loosely on ""The Iliad,"" the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer.  So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama.  Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures.  On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn`t appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle.  Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world`s most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought.  In fact, it is Paris` ""abduction"" of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.Because of the quality of the source material, ""Troy"" boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films.  For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen.  The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful.  Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son.  On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan ""war prize"" Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum.  And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in ""The Iliad.""Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of ""The Iliad""'s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse.  The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged.  All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those ""prophetic"" lines.Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance.  It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.""Troy"" is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of ""The Iliad,"" but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing.",3,uneven but sometimes rewarding film,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,4623,"['Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 's', 'Troy', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'look', 'feel', 'sword-and-sandal', 'epics', '1950', '1960', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'wide', 'screen', 'extravaganzas', 'helped', 'lure', 'audiences', 'away', 'television', 'sets', 'home', 'back', 'movie', 'houses', 'had', 'so', 'recently', 'abandoned', 'be', 'expected', 'Troy', 'shares', 'many', 'strengths', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'weaknesses', 'earlier', 'films.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Troy', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'history', 'pseudo-history', 'case', 'unfolding', 'grand', 'scale', 'events', 'greater', 'being', 'enacted', 'screen', 'also', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'sequences', 'thousands', 'extras', 'computerized', 'equivalent', 'thereof', 'stretching', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'negative', 'side', 'movie', 'suffers', 'length', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'banal', 'characters', 'who', 'frequently', 'get', 'lost', 'vast', 'canvas', 'film', 'good', 'news', 'most', 'part', 'Troy', 'triumph', 'most', 'weaknesses', 'Troy', 'based', 'very', 'loosely', 'Iliad', 'epic', 'poem', 'Greek', 'writer', 'Homer', 'So', 'loose', 'fact', 'screenplay', 'completely', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'who', 'play', 'so', 'crucial', 'role', 'original', 'tale', 'instead', 'exclusively', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'act', 'out', 'drama', 'characters', 'read', 'Who', 'Who', 'great', 'mythological', 'figures', 'Greek', 'side', 'have', 'Achilles', 'pouty', 'warrior', 'who', 'out', 'most', 'fighting', 'personally', 'slighted', 'king', 'who', 't', 'appreciate', 'way', 'should', 'Agamemnon', 'arrogant', 'chieftain', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'personal', 'glory', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'Menelaus', 'impulsive', 'cuckold', 'who', 'compunction', 'taking', 'nation', 'war', 'personal', 'humiliation', 'Odysseus', 'pragmatic', 'fighter', 'who', 'hardest', 'get', 'Achilles', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'Patroclus', 'impetuous', 'youth', 'eager', 'prove', 'mettle', 'devotion', 'Achilles', 'field', 'battle', 'Lined', 'up', 'Trojan', 'side', 'are', 'Hector', 'sensitive', 'tactician', 'Priam', 'wise', 'king', 'loving', 'father', 'Hector', 'Paris', 'Paris', 'callow', 'youth', 'Helen', 'world', 's', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'sake', 'epic', 'battle', 'ultimately', 'fought', 'fact', 'Paris', 'abduction', 'Helen', 'Greek', 'husband', 'Menelaus', 'nation', 'launch', 'thousand', 'ships', 'cross', 'sea', 'fortified', 'city', 'Troy', 'do', 'battle', 'Trojans.Because', 'quality', 'source', 'material', 'Troy', 'slightly', 'more', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'are', 'used', 'finding', 'action/adventure', 'films', 'even', 'reputed', 'be', 'world', 'most', 'invincible', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'also', 'petulant', 'spoiled', 'quick', 'anger', 'often', 'more', 'concerned', 'amending', 'personal', 'injuries', 'safeguarding', 'welfare', 'own', 'countrymen', 'squaring', 'off', 'two', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'different', 'circumstances', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'excitingly', 'well', 'done', 'suspenseful', 'Ditto', 'scene', 'mourning', 'King', 'Priam', 'tent', 'enemy', 'beg', 'body', 'son', 'other', 'hand', 'Achille', 'love', 'affair', 'Trojan', 'war', 'prize', 'Breseis', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'poor', 'Agamemnon', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'conventional', 'villain', 'version', 'Iliad', 'screenplay', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'broad', 'outlines', 'Iliad', 'storyline', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'duplicate', 'beauty', 'soul', 'Homer', 'poetic', 'verse', 'closest', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'having', 'characters', 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'men', 'thousands', 'years', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'speaking', 'Achilles', 'Hector', 'Troy', 'et', 'al', 'events', 'are', 'engaged', 'pretentious', 'self-reverential', 'speechifying', 'merely', 'throwing', 'drama', 'time', 'someone', 'one', 'prophetic', 'lines.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'Priam', 'one', 'truly', 'compelling', 'performance', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'movie', 'again', 'role', 'sea', 'nymph', 'Thetis', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'too', 'inconsequential', 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'Troy', 'little', 'more', 'Illustrated', 'Highlights', 'version', 'Iliad', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'decent', 'enough', 'introduction', 'willing', 'take', 'real', 'thing']",N/A

852400,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B0002Z0EXQ,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[1, 1]","In my opinion this is the best movie yet produced on what is, arguably, the greatest story ever told.  Granted, it is a Hollywood interpretation of the famous epic and is, therefore, inaccurate.  The screenwriters, however, clearly love Homer's tale and try to do justice to it.  They've just tried to tweak it a little.We see remorseless Agammemnon sacrifice his only daughter so that favorable winds will blow for the Greek fleet.  We see near-immortal Achilles playing with his women prior to deadly battle.  Actually this scene doesn't accord with the Iliad.  Achilles, who has been warned of his death at Troy, has dressed up like a woman and is hiding with them.We see Paris and Helen too weak to subdue their fatal desire.  We see Hector and old Priam--for reasons we never completely understand--refuse to discipline the wayward couple and return fair Helen to her husband.We see the mechanical Achilles slaughter ranks of his enemies.Still, the story does diverge from the Iliad.  There is a duel between Helen's husband, Menelaus, and Paris.  Menelaus proves victorious but, when he goes to kill Paris, Hector intervenes and slays the cuckolded man.  Not true.  In the story Paris is whisked away to the arms of Helen by the Goddess Aphrodite.  Menelaus lives to reclaim his wife after the fall of the doomed city.The other, more fundamental change the scriptors made, was to minimize the supernatural component of the story.  Most of the events have natural explanations whereas, in the Iliad, events are dictated by bickering Gods.No matter.  Hector, both in the movie and in the Iliad, is sympathetic as the doomed hero fighting for his city.  He's a mighty warrior but he must fight against the Achilles demi-god.  He almost prevails but, in the end, there is no escaping death at Achilles' hand.  It is, after all, fate.I love the story so I liked the movie.  We are witness to events 3,200 years ago still we take sides and--even though we know what the outcome must be--we hope things will turn out differently.  It's remarkable in its own way.

852402,A3VX6DDDK0681Z,B0002Z0EXQ,R. Overall,"[0, 0]","Not a Brad Pitt fan, but I love history, often even when Hollywoodized (sic).  Brad does a good job here, if occasionally a bit wooden.  Though somewhat predictable since the history is well-known to even moderately educated folks, despite the half-hearted love story for the gals, this is a very good retelling of the story.  Like 300 should have been (but was too cartoonized), it humanizes a classic.  Very good acting, great graphics, and mostly on-original.  I grew up with the classics, learning as Icarus did, the lessons of life from those who lived thousands of years ago, who in turn had learned them the hard way.  And the classic adventure is not lost here.  It ain't poifect, but it's as close as I've seen Hollywood come.

852403,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B0002Z0EXQ,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[5, 9]","Wolfgang Petersen's film adaptation of the Illiad is good material for a traditional blockbuster movie. It's the number one film in theatres right now. Wolfgang Petersen has made several movies loosely based on novels before, including the children's fantasy The NeverEnding Story in 1984. Starring Brad Pitt as Achilles, Brenda Gleeson as Helen, Orlando Bloom as Paris, Eric Bana as Hector and Peter O Toole as King Priam. It's a visual masterpiece, big battle scenes and epic sweep, but it's a big cake with no substance.He has completely changed Homer's classic Illiad and cut out several significant characters and made alterations to suit a Hollywood epic starring of all people Brad Pitt as the warrior hero Achilles. Women are not portrayed in a good light, eventhough in the Illiad this remained true, but many important female characters did not feature in the movie. Queen Hecuba, the wife of Priam, is no where to be seen and we are lead to believe King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is an old widower. The blind prophetess Cassandra, who predicted the fall of Troy, is not in the movie either and neither is the old prophet Laoocowom who warned the Trojans of the danger of the Trojan Horse the Greeks left on the shore. The Illiad is completely butchered. Ajax, another warrior is not supposed to die in combat either. Brisceis is a princess and not a temple priestess, something to which even Wolfgang Petersen's script contradicted. In her first meeting with Brad Pitt's Achilles, he tells her she is royalty eventhough she's been a priestess in the temple. With a lot of inaccuracies, this film merely serves as a big Hollywood version of Troy. There have been many versions, in old films and in the summer of 2003 a made for cable series. This film is enjoyable to watch at a purely Hollywood level- brand name celebrities like Brad Pitt in a role he's not used to doing. Impressive yes and good music. Oh, and the gods do not make any appearances, and the gods- Athena, in particular, had a very prominent role in the Trojan War. Also, it's assumed everyone has read the Illiad because there is no explanation for Achilles dying when Paris shot an arrow on his heel. Read the classic Greek legendcycle instead...it's superior in every way and a treasure of Greek historic literature.

852410,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0002Z0EXQ,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 5]","""Troy"" is a popcorn bucket, sword-n-sandal beefcake epic, bloody and full of itself, yet terrific entertainment.Summer movies pass or fail on the ""deliver the goods"" litmus test, and Wolfgang Petersen's loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Iliad,"" all $175 million of it, works both as a historical cheat sheet and action flick, with battle scenes rivaling the best of ""Braveheart"" and the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. And, yes, a sculpted Brad Pitt survives in the role of Greek warrior Achilles, even as Eric Bana quietly carries the picture as the Trojan prince Hector.Working from a script that writer David Benioff pitched to Warner Bros executives before his previous work, ""The 25th Hour,"" had even hit screens, ""Troy"" compresses Homer's ten-year war into a matter of weeks, and mostly removes the mythological element of the story, concerning itself with mortals on the battlefield. An outline of the poem remains: Trojan Paris (Orlando Bloom) woos Helen (Diane Kruger) from Greek king Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), who summons brother Agamemnon (a wicked Brian Cox) for war. And thus begins the sail to Troy, with Achilles, insolent and glory-fond, aboard the lead ship.The movie stumbles out of the gate - Kruger and Bloom make for doe-eyed, passionless Couple That Launched A Thousand Ships - but finds its stride on the shores of Turkey; Achilles leads an initial invasion reminiscent of the Normandy scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" in capturing Troy's Temple of Apollo and there first meets his battle equal, Hector, who bears the responsibility of an outnumbered army led by an aging, weakened King Priam (Peter O'Toole, grand is what might be his final role).""Troy"" stays true to Achilles and Agamemnon's quarrels - in the middle is a Trojan temple girl played gamely by Rose Byrne - and Pitt, while no Russell Crowe - he just can't yell without his voice cracking an octive - preens, struts and pouts as the ancient warrior might have. Homer's poem is point-blank about those whines and bouts of grandstanding, and Pitt sells the physicality, speed and acumen of Achilles from the opening blink-and-you'll-miss-it victory over another Greek brute.His duel with Hector outside the gates of the city is worth a repeat viewing - as swift as it moves, Petersen does not turn the fight into the indistinct chaos that hampered Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator;"" there is a geometry and skill to the editing. Petersen favors sweeping helicopter shots for the clash of the two large armies, effective for understanding strategy and position, which plays a specific role in the Greeks' first march toward Troy. A Trojan raid at dawn on the Greeks' beachhead camp is impressive, as is the Trojan Horse raid, also at dawn, as Agamemnon's swarm descends on the city. Petersen bottles Homer's spirit with these scenes even as he lops off most of the labyrinthine plot - the balance of the world seems at stake, the city of Troy a significant sentinel in the desert to capture, the adversaries worthy on each side. The essence is there.And the acting, Pitt included, is strong. Cox may come off too shrill for some, but his Agamemnon is a true amoral jackal - a dash of humor amidst his sadism. Vile and practical - ""I like your land. I like your army, too."" - Agamemnon is from the Saddam Hussein school of cruelty and leadership. His comeuppance is deserved. O'Toole shares one great scene with Pitt inside Achilles' tent (Pitt rises to the moment as well) but Bana, as the wise, troubled Hector is given the movie's best character - he knows what his brother has tempted in stealing Helen, and when Hector himself draws Achilles back into the battle, his extended goodbye before duel would work in any genre. What Bana gave up in his bland work as Bruce Banner in ""Hulk"" he earns back in ""Troy."" Sean Bean makes a nice turn as Odysseus, another Homer icon who negotiates between Agamemnon and Achilles.Kruger is a failure - a bit tepid for Helen despite her siren eyes. Her role has been severely cut. She's a weakness. So, too, are the very final scenes pitting Achilles and Paris in the Troy courtyard; as long as it is, ""Troy"" still manages to rush the sacking of the city. James Horner's score never stops its trumpets and strings - the same problem plagued Petersen's ""The Perfect Storm.""",4,"The spirit of Homer, the action of ""Braveheart.""",1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,4292,"['Troy', 'popcorn', 'bucket', 'sword-n-sandal', 'beefcake', 'epic', 'bloody', 'full', 'yet', 'terrific', 'entertainment.Summer', 'movies', 'pass', 'fail', 'deliver', 'goods', 'litmus', 'test', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Homer', 'Iliad', '175', 'million', 'historical', 'cheat', 'sheet', 'action', 'flick', 'battle', 'scenes', 'rivaling', 'best', 'Braveheart', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'yes', 'sculpted', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'role', 'Greek', 'warrior', 'Achilles', 'even', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'quietly', 'picture', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Hector.Working', 'script', 'writer', 'David', 'Benioff', 'pitched', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'executives', 'previous', 'work', '25th', 'Hour', 'had', 'even', 'hit', 'screens', 'Troy', 'Homer', 'ten-year', 'war', 'matter', 'weeks', 'mostly', 'mythological', 'element', 'story', 'concerning', 'mortals', 'battlefield', 'outline', 'poem', 'Trojan', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'woos', 'Helen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Greek', 'king', 'Menelaus', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'who', 'brother', 'Agamemnon', 'wicked', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'war', 'thus', 'sail', 'Troy', 'Achilles', 'insolent', 'glory-fond', 'lead', 'ship.The', 'movie', 'gate', 'Kruger', 'Bloom', 'make', 'doe-eyed', 'passionless', 'Couple', 'That', 'Launched', 'Thousand', 'Ships', 'stride', 'shores', 'Turkey', 'Achilles', 'initial', 'invasion', 'reminiscent', 'Normandy', 'scene', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'capturing', 'Troy', 'Temple', 'Apollo', 'there', 'first', 'meets', 'battle', 'equal', 'Hector', 'who', 'responsibility', 'outnumbered', 'army', 'led', 'aging', 'weakened', 'King', 'Priam', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'grand', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'final', 'role', 'Troy', 'true', 'Achilles', 'Agamemnon', 'quarrels', 'middle', 'Trojan', 'temple', 'girl', 'played', 'gamely', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Pitt', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yell', 'voice', 'cracking', 'octive', 'preens', 'struts', 'pouts', 'ancient', 'warrior', 'might', 'have', 'Homer', 'poem', 'point-blank', 'whines', 'bouts', 'grandstanding', 'Pitt', 'physicality', 'speed', 'acumen', 'Achilles', 'opening', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'victory', 'Greek', 'brute.His', 'duel', 'Hector', 'gates', 'city', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'as', 'swift', 'Petersen', 'not', 'turn', 'fight', 'indistinct', 'chaos', 'hampered', 'Coliseum', 'scenes', 'Gladiator', 'geometry', 'skill', 'editing', 'Petersen', 'favors', 'sweeping', 'helicopter', 'shots', 'clash', 'two', 'large', 'armies', 'effective', 'understanding', 'strategy', 'position', 'specific', 'role', 'Greeks', 'first', 'march', 'Troy', 'A', 'Trojan', 'raid', 'dawn', 'Greeks', 'beachhead', 'camp', 'impressive', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'raid', 'also', 'dawn', 'Agamemnon', 'swarm', 'city', 'Petersen', 'Homer', 'spirit', 'scenes', 'even', 'most', 'labyrinthine', 'plot', 'balance', 'world', 'stake', 'city', 'Troy', 'significant', 'sentinel', 'desert', 'capture', 'adversaries', 'worthy', 'side', 'essence', 'acting', 'Pitt', 'included', 'strong', 'Cox', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'too', 'shrill', 'Agamemnon', 'true', 'amoral', 'jackal', 'dash', 'humor', 'sadism', 'Vile', 'practical', 'like', 'land', 'army', 'too', 'Agamemnon', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'school', 'cruelty', 'leadership', 'comeuppance', 'deserved', ""O'Toole"", 'shares', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'tent', 'Pitt', 'moment', 'as', 'well', 'Bana', 'wise', 'troubled', 'Hector', 'given', 'movie', 'best', 'character', 'what', 'brother', 'tempted', 'stealing', 'Helen', 'when', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'back', 'battle', 'extended', 'goodbye', 'duel', 'would', 'work', 'genre', 'What', 'Bana', 'gave', 'up', 'bland', 'work', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'back', 'Troy', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'nice', 'turn', 'Odysseus', 'Homer', 'icon', 'who', 'Agamemnon', 'Achilles.Kruger', 'failure', 'bit', 'tepid', 'Helen', 'siren', 'eyes', 'role', 'been', 'severely', 'cut', 'weakness', 'So', 'too', 'are', 'very', 'final', 'scenes', 'pitting', 'Achilles', 'Paris', 'Troy', 'courtyard', 'as', 'long', 'Troy', 'still', 'rush', 'sacking', 'city', 'James', 'Horner', 'score', 'never', 'trumpets', 'strings', 'same', 'problem', 'plagued', 'Petersen', 'Perfect', 'Storm']",N/A

Then, one should beware of Greeks bearing gifts.It's become an axiom that films have to do killer numbers in their first three weeks or they are considered less-than-successful. Well, the reviews weren't real kind to this movie, and maybe the weak initial receipts were the reason. In truth, it wasn't that bad. It is actually a fairly entertaining version (cf the original 'Helen of Troy')of this story. As befits the presentation of an epic, the director made good use of technology (there actually seem to be thousands of ships and thousands of soldiers), and the battle scenes were both realistic and interesting. Those involving only two combatants were particularly impressive due to some fine choreography. Yet, this film suffered from an unbalanced approach with an unnecessary emphasis on sentimentality overall and an inattention to the more important themes from Homer's original epic. It could have easily been re-named ""Achilles,"" so much of the movie revolved around his character rather than the destruction of the ancient city. Pitt did an acceptable, if a bit too rigid, job of playing that role but at times hurt his own performance when he couldn't seem to decide whether he should speak aristocratic English or American vernacular. The adaptation also could have been more genuine. After all, if it is decided that Achilles is going to take center stage, then there should at least be a reference or an explanation concerning his vulnerable heel. Similarly, the most telling aspect of the original tale, the events surrounding the Trojan Horse, were treated here almost as a necessary afterthought. The final words of the narrator merely reinforced that this movie was less about Troy than a few of the more important warriors, when he said, 'Troy is gone, but those names will be remembered.' Good supporting performances from Peter O'toole and Brian Cox overcame some of its weaknesses, but this could have been a better movie.

Under a hot spotlight for historical accuracy, director Wolgang Petersen does steer away from the original story, but does a fine job to bring such an extensive series of events to the screen.For those who do not know the story, King Menelaus of Sparta is outraged when he discovers that his beautiful wife Helen (Diane Kruger) has run off with the young Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). He seeks help from his greedy and mischevious brother Agammemnon, who convinces Menelaus to start a war to conquer Troy and bring Helen back to Sparta. In an act of desperation, Agammemnon recruits loose-cannon Achilles (Brad Pitt), one of the greatest warriors of all time to lead the fight. Fighting for the Trojans is the legendary soldier Hector (Eric Bana), eldest son of King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and brother to Paris. What begins is one of the greatest and most widely-recognized tales of all time, which eventually leads to the Trojan horse, and the fall of Troy.Performance wise, ""Troy"" tries to rely heavily on its A-list ensemble cast for the movie's backbone, and luckily, most of the performances are spot on. As the reluctant hero and family man Hector, Eric Bana gives a suprisingly deep and emotionally solid performance. He molds himself to the character, and gives one of the best performances in the film. Orlando Bloom puts his doe-eyes and innocent face to good use in the role of Paris, and envelopes the torn and somewhat pathetic character well. Newcomers Diane Kruger and Rose Byrne are solid in their roles as the prominent female characters Helen and Briseis, respectively. A bulked up and perfectly tanned Brad Pitt gives a good, but not great performance as Achilles, and Peter O'Toole gives a wonderful cameo as King Priam. The scene between Priam and Achilles is one of the best in the film.Although the performances are a main focus of the picture, the action and battle sequences are what really make this movie. Huge numbers of extras and large choreographed fight scenes pay off in a realistic, bloody and poignant picture of ancient warfare. ""Troy"" does alter history quite a bit to give it a more Hollywood feel, which to some effect, diminishes parts of the epic tale. However, the adaptations made to the script work well, and are credible considering the ominious task of bring a ten-year-long war to life.One of the most anticipated (and not to mention most expensive) epic films of the spring, Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" is a fine and enjoyable movie. Sure, it has its flaws, like any other film, but the fantastic battle sequences, solid performances, beautiful scenery and music, and not to mention the constant presence of half-naked Greeks makes for a good day at the cinema.",4,Petersen's Big Fat Greek Epic,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2875,"['being', 'based', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'widely-known', 'epic', 'tales', 'time', 'Iliad', 'Hollywood', 'certainly', 'had', 'difficult', 'task', 'Troy', 'hot', 'spotlight', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'director', 'Wolgang', 'Petersen', 'steer', 'away', 'original', 'story', 'fine', 'job', 'bring', 'extensive', 'series', 'events', 'screen.For', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'story', 'King', 'Menelaus', 'Sparta', 'outraged', 'when', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'run', 'off', 'young', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'help', 'greedy', 'mischevious', 'brother', 'Agammemnon', 'who', 'Menelaus', 'start', 'war', 'conquer', 'Troy', 'bring', 'Helen', 'back', 'Sparta', 'act', 'desperation', 'Agammemnon', 'loose-cannon', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'greatest', 'warriors', 'time', 'lead', 'fight', 'Fighting', 'Trojans', 'legendary', 'soldier', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'eldest', 'son', 'King', 'Priam', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'brother', 'Paris', 'What', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'widely-recognized', 'tales', 'time', 'eventually', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'fall', 'Troy.Performance', 'wise', 'Troy', 'rely', 'heavily', 'A-list', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'movie', 'backbone', 'luckily', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'spot', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'family', 'man', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'suprisingly', 'deep', 'emotionally', 'solid', 'performance', 'character', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'doe-eyes', 'innocent', 'face', 'good', 'use', 'role', 'Paris', 'torn', 'somewhat', 'pathetic', 'character', 'well', 'Newcomers', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'are', 'solid', 'roles', 'prominent', 'female', 'characters', 'Helen', 'Briseis', 'respectively', 'bulked', 'up', 'perfectly', 'tanned', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'performance', 'Achilles', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'wonderful', 'cameo', 'King', 'Priam', 'scene', 'Priam', 'Achilles', 'one', 'best', 'film.Although', 'performances', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'picture', 'action', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'Huge', 'numbers', 'extras', 'large', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pay', 'off', 'realistic', 'bloody', 'poignant', 'picture', 'ancient', 'warfare', 'Troy', 'alter', 'history', 'quite', 'bit', 'give', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'effect', 'parts', 'epic', 'tale', 'However', 'adaptations', 'made', 'script', 'work', 'well', 'are', 'credible', 'considering', 'ominious', 'task', 'bring', 'ten-year-long', 'war', 'life.One', 'most', 'anticipated', 'not', 'mention', 'most', 'expensive', 'epic', 'films', 'spring', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Troy', 'fine', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Sure', 'flaws', 'other', 'film', 'fantastic', 'battle', 'sequences', 'solid', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'music', 'not', 'mention', 'constant', 'presence', 'half-naked', 'Greeks', 'good', 'day', 'cinema']",N/A

852417,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0002Z0EXQ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" bears all the hallmarks of a major studio production for a summer blockbuster.  Thousands of soldiers clash in violent battle scenes, plenty of beefcake and cheesecake to go around (but not too racy as to potentially offend anyone), famous and semi-famous actors even in marginal roles, and more than a bit of romance.  All this points to the good, but the problem is that in taking this perspective to the battle of Troy, Petersen and his team generally gutted the ""Iliad,"" which is only one of the foundations of the Western Canon and with plenty of devoted fans.Brad Pitt's Achilles is the best example of how ""Troy"" fundamentally changed a major character.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer a semi-immortal, beloved of the Gods and vulnerable only in the heel that his mother held when she dipped him in the River Styx.  Instead, he's ""just"" the best warrior out there.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer the desperately vain hero of the ""Iliad,"" but instead is a thoughtful man given to internal anguish over things like loyalty, duty, and the like.  Also abandoned is Achilles' love for his friend Patroclus -- rather than touch upon any hint of homosexuality, the script makes Achilles and Patroclus cousins.  This doesn't quite work as justification for Achilles' rage after Patroclus' death -- as more than one Trojan points out to Achilles, how many cousins, father, sons, and brothers have you killed, you hypocrite?  I can't say Pitt was miscast as Achilles, given Pitt's excellent work in other films -- the character was just poorly written.  His sacrifice for the maiden Briseas is just plain wrong, but it gives Pitt a chance for a ""Hollywood"" dying speech . . . yeesh.""Troy"" also completely abandons the role of the Greek gods in the battle, which dismisses one of the major plot lines in the ""Iliad.""  I'm sure this was done for the sake of getting the movie completed in under 3 hours -- there are already a lot of characters to begin with -- but the Gods elevate the battle of Troy from mere tale to the level of myth, and their absence is telling.  Indeed, the Trojans, with the exception of Hector (a stoic Eric Bana), are generally led to their downfall to their devotion to ""the Gods,"" who never show up, while the Greeks are motivated by more worldly (and therefore practical) considerations.The movie gets many things right, even as it rewrites the story. Paris and Helen, whose affair starts the whole bloody mess, are as passive and self-absorbed as they are in the ""Iliad"" -- note how Paris (Orlando Bloom) continually fails to rise to the occasion.  Other characters who shine in the ""Iliad,"" such as Odysseus, Nestor, Ajax, and Menelaus, are not given nearly as much time to shine and are used generally as plot devices.There are several solid performances in ""Troy,"" particularly Brian Cox as the dastardly Agamemnon and Peter O'Toole as the wizened Priam, and if you're not that familiar with the ""Iliad,"" you will probably be able to enjoy ""Troy"" more on its own merits than someone who is really bothered by the fact that ""Troy"" takes place over a few weeks while the ""Iliad"" recounts the last year in a ten-year battle.The DVD looks great, and the battle scenes are enjoyable even if they don't rise to the recent heights established by Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.All in all, ""Troy"" is a good movie that somewhat disappoints because it could have been great.  Unfortunately, by trying to make a blockbuster, the filmmakers trimmed corners and softened the edges of one of the great tales of Western Civilization . . . maybe they should have respected the fact that Homer has had considerable box office appeal for over 3,000 years.",4,Grand Battle Scenes Help Mediocre Translation of Iliad,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,3706,"['Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Troy', 'hallmarks', 'major', 'studio', 'production', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Thousands', 'soldiers', 'clash', 'violent', 'battle', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'beefcake', 'cheesecake', 'go', 'around', 'not', 'too', 'racy', 'potentially', 'offend', 'anyone', 'famous', 'semi-famous', 'actors', 'even', 'marginal', 'roles', 'more', 'bit', 'romance', 'points', 'good', 'problem', 'taking', 'perspective', 'battle', 'Troy', 'Petersen', 'team', 'generally', 'gutted', 'Iliad', 'only', 'one', 'foundations', 'Western', 'Canon', 'plenty', 'devoted', 'fans.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'best', 'example', 'how', 'Troy', 'fundamentally', 'changed', 'major', 'character', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'no', 'longer', 'semi-immortal', 'beloved', 'Gods', 'vulnerable', 'only', 'heel', 'mother', 'held', 'when', 'dipped', 'River', 'Styx', 'Instead', 'just', 'best', 'warrior', 'there', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'no', 'longer', 'desperately', 'vain', 'hero', 'Iliad', 'instead', 'thoughtful', 'man', 'given', 'internal', 'anguish', 'things', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'like', 'Also', 'abandoned', 'Achilles', 'love', 'friend', 'Patroclus', 'rather', 'touch', 'hint', 'homosexuality', 'script', 'Achilles', 'Patroclus', 'cousins', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'justification', 'Achilles', 'rage', 'Patroclus', 'death', 'more', 'one', 'Trojan', 'out', 'Achilles', 'how', 'many', 'cousins', 'father', 'sons', 'brothers', 'have', 'killed', 'hypocrite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Pitt', 'was', 'miscast', 'Achilles', 'given', 'Pitt', 'excellent', 'work', 'other', 'films', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'sacrifice', 'maiden', 'Briseas', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'Pitt', 'chance', 'Hollywood', 'dying', 'speech', 'yeesh', 'Troy', 'also', 'completely', 'role', 'Greek', 'gods', 'battle', 'one', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'Iliad', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'done', 'sake', 'getting', 'movie', 'completed', '3', 'hours', 'are', 'already', 'lot', 'characters', 'begin', 'Gods', 'elevate', 'battle', 'Troy', 'mere', 'tale', 'level', 'myth', 'absence', 'telling', 'Indeed', 'Trojans', 'exception', 'Hector', 'stoic', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'are', 'generally', 'led', 'downfall', 'devotion', 'Gods', 'who', 'never', 'show', 'up', 'Greeks', 'are', 'motivated', 'more', 'worldly', 'therefore', 'practical', 'considerations.The', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'even', 'story', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'affair', 'whole', 'bloody', 'mess', 'are', 'passive', 'self-absorbed', 'are', 'Iliad', 'note', 'how', 'Paris', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'continually', 'rise', 'occasion', 'Other', 'characters', 'who', 'shine', 'Iliad', 'such', 'Odysseus', 'Nestor', 'Ajax', 'Menelaus', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'shine', 'are', 'used', 'generally', 'plot', 'are', 'several', 'solid', 'performances', 'Troy', 'particularly', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'dastardly', 'Agamemnon', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'wizened', 'Priam', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Iliad', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Troy', 'more', 'own', 'merits', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'bothered', 'fact', 'Troy', 'place', 'few', 'weeks', 'Iliad', 'last', 'year', 'ten-year', 'battle.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'rise', 'recent', 'heights', 'established', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy.All', 'Troy', 'good', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'trying', 'make', 'blockbuster', 'filmmakers', 'trimmed', 'corners', 'softened', 'edges', 'one', 'great', 'tales', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'respected', 'fact', 'Homer', 'had', 'considerable', 'box', 'office', 'appeal', '3,000', 'years']",N/A

This blinding pace is set at the very outset, when the preamble text flashes some hard-to-read fonts in quick scattershots, so we begin the film with a muddle of Greek names we don't quite grasp, much less care for.Once we do get into it, there are bouts of overacting and just campy cheese as the purpose and background of many things go unexplained.The whole episode of capturing of Helen of Troy happens in a blink, before we have been told who's who. Helen, btw, the very raison-d'etre of the entire Trojan war is some pan-faced damsel about as expressive as a cardboard, a horrid glitch in casting, and she not once makes a dent in our emotions.Come to think of it, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole are the only decent actors the film sports, and both of them are sadly under-rationed their bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is wooden and Hollywood poster-boyish as ever, although towards the end he does show that he can muster a tear or two.But the war scenes are superbly done. Especially some episodes such as one-on-one combat between Hector and Achilles (Bana and Pitt respectively), plus a few war strategy themes. The oceanside looks suitably spectacular (Malta?) so the imagery guys get a nod from me. I still marvel at how such huge crowds can be hired for stunts, as not all of it is CGI.War is wretched business, but unlike recent farces like ""The Last Samurai"", this movie shows what true warfare used to be like -- there was honor among thieves and even bloody wars followed rules.A couple of not-so-overt themes stood out to me:(1) ATHEISM:The emperor of Troy commits not one but two blunders by listening to his pretentiously pious minister whose holy crap about Apollo was almost always misguided. On both these occasions some common sense was at hand too, from the emperor's own sons, and ignoring them was catastrophic for Troy. Makes one wonder if there was an agnostic message hidden somewhere.(2) MESSAGE DENOUNCING WILD ABANDON:Achilles has a heroic dialog with his cousin where he (ill-)advises the latter to ""don't waste your time following some fool's orders"". This advice instigates the cousin to do a wild turn in the war and get himself killed. Anyone see what I see?It's stuff like this and some mildly amusing remember-me lines such as ""War is young men dying and old men talking"" that make the movie a worthy investment of your time. Don't expect quite a classic but it's decent popcorn entertainment for the 3 hours it takes to make its point.",4,"SOMEWHAT CAMPY AND SLOW-BURNING, BUT QUITE WATCHABLE..",1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2528,"['long', 'lot', 'material', 'smooshed', 'hurry', 'blinding', 'pace', 'set', 'very', 'outset', 'when', 'preamble', 'text', 'hard-to-read', 'fonts', 'quick', 'scattershots', 'begin', 'film', 'muddle', 'Greek', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'grasp', 'much', 'less', 'care', 'for.Once', 'do', 'get', 'are', 'bouts', 'overacting', 'just', 'campy', 'cheese', 'purpose', 'background', 'many', 'things', 'go', 'unexplained.The', 'whole', 'episode', 'capturing', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'blink', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'who', 'who', 'Helen', 'btw', 'very', ""raison-d'etre"", 'entire', 'Trojan', 'war', 'pan-faced', 'damsel', 'as', 'expressive', 'cardboard', 'horrid', 'glitch', 'casting', 'not', 'once', 'dent', 'emotions.Come', 'think', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'are', 'only', 'decent', 'actors', 'film', 'sports', 'are', 'sadly', 'under-rationed', 'bit', 'screen', 'time', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'wooden', 'Hollywood', 'poster-boyish', 'ever', 'end', 'show', 'can', 'muster', 'tear', 'two.But', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'superbly', 'done', 'Especially', 'episodes', 'such', 'one-on-one', 'combat', 'Hector', 'Achilles', 'Bana', 'Pitt', 'respectively', 'few', 'war', 'strategy', 'themes', 'oceanside', 'suitably', 'spectacular', 'Malta', 'imagery', 'guys', 'get', 'nod', 'still', 'marvel', 'how', 'such', 'huge', 'crowds', 'can', 'be', 'hired', 'stunts', 'not', 'CGI.War', 'wretched', 'business', 'recent', 'farces', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'movie', 'what', 'true', 'warfare', 'used', 'be', 'was', 'honor', 'thieves', 'even', 'bloody', 'wars', 'followed', 'rules.A', 'couple', 'not-so-overt', 'themes', 'stood', 'out', '1', 'ATHEISM', 'emperor', 'Troy', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'blunders', 'listening', 'pretentiously', 'pious', 'minister', 'holy', 'crap', 'Apollo', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'misguided', 'occasions', 'common', 'sense', 'was', 'hand', 'too', 'emperor', 'own', 'sons', 'ignoring', 'was', 'catastrophic', 'Troy', 'Makes', 'one', 'wonder', 'was', 'agnostic', 'message', 'hidden', 'somewhere', '2', 'MESSAGE', 'DENOUNCING', 'WILD', 'ABANDON', 'Achilles', 'heroic', 'dialog', 'cousin', 'where', 'ill-', 'latter', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'following', 'fool', 'orders', 'advice', 'cousin', 'do', 'wild', 'turn', 'war', 'get', 'killed', 'Anyone', 'see', 'what', 'see', 'stuff', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'remember-me', 'lines', 'such', 'War', 'young', 'men', 'dying', 'old', 'men', 'talking', 'make', 'movie', 'worthy', 'investment', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quite', 'classic', 'decent', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', '3', 'hours', 'make', 'point']",N/A
852428,A1O9CA15IA31NT,B0002Z0EXQ,Short,"[2, 13]","From the previews of Troy, one could decide it was going to be a movie that would either be great or terrible. No inbetweens. No kind of good. Black and white good or bad.For me it undeniably falls into the bad category. The movie was long and had some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. The plot is basically that of the Illiad. Paris from Troy takes away beautiful Helen, pissing off all of Greece. King Agamemnon uses this as an excuse to invade Troy so he can get the area open for trade. But they can't win the war without Achilles (Brad Pitt) who is such an amazing warrior that he moves in slow motion when he starts killing multiple enemy soldiers at once. Also in the story are Hector, Priam, and some other Greek names you would never recognize unless you read the Illiad.My main problem with the film was the acting. Except for Priam and Hector, there was very little effort in making for interseting dialogue or character to care about. Achilles is made out to be this emotionless killing machine, who finally has his heart openned by a Trojan girl he capture, but kindly abstains from raping AND keeps other soldiers from having their way her either. How sweet, he must have fallen love.The only thing I really enjoyed about this film was the action. There's not a lot one can do to make Greecian warfare cool that hasn't been done before. The way warriors like Achilles and Hector fight is very smooth and fluid and that is captured very nicely when these warriors are featured in battle. Achilles vs. Hector wasn't a badly choreographed fight either.What some people may not like is how little it follows the actual Illiad. Major plot points are missing. Achilles comes up with the Trojan Horse rather than Oddeseyus, and Paris lives freely in the end. I realize that the movie takes and approach that eliminates the appearance of the Greek gods that is prolific in the Illiad, but a few too many liberties are taken for my liking. I think that a better Greek war epic is going to be Alexander. Watch for that coming soon, it looks a thousand times better than Troy.I would not wish this movie upon my worst enemy.

852431,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B0002Z0EXQ,Simon Crowe,"[0, 1]","If you're expecting to see a film of the ILIAD, you'll be disappointed. TROY borrows, changes, and cuts to shape this story of two noble warriors who were the finest men of their respective ages. Briefly: Paris (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with and absconds with Helen (Diane Kruger), the wife of Greek king Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). The Greeks, led by Agamemnon (Brian Cox, florid), sail across the Aegean to invade Troy , home of Paris and his brother Hector (Eric Bana), the sons of King Priam (Peter O'Toole). Achilles (Brad Pitt), a legendary warrior even then, forms an uneasy alliance with Agamemnon to fight for the Greeks.TROY is impressively made, with a real epic sensibility. I don't know if computer effets were used, but the battle scenes are appropriately large scale ang genuinely harrowing. The cast is generally quite good, with the real standout being Bana as Hector, and great warriot who with every fiber of his being longs not to fight. I was happy to see Bana shine here after the disaster of THE HULK. O'Toole has a wonderfully detached regalness that's somehow very moving, and among the women Saffron Burrows (as Andromache) and Rose Byrne stand out.Much has been made of Pitt's physical transformation, which is impressive. Somewhat less has been made of his acting. I don't think Pitt is a particularly good choice to play Achilles (Bana or Sean Bean, who plays Odysseus, might have done better.) But the problem with the movie for me lies not with Pitt but with the conception of the Achilles character. Achilles is the only character in the film whose behavior is never explained. When he's not fighting he's awfully static, and his uneasy relationship with Agamemnon seems unmotivated. Readers of Homer know the backstory, but this is a review of the film. As a result, there's a vacuum at the center of the movie that prevents it from achieving true greatness. Still, TROY is certainly worth seeing and the filmmakers must be applauded for their ambition.

In all seriousness this movie was quite good.  The story-telling was nowhere near Braveheart or Gladiator but the action is some of the best I've ever seen.  The battles are fantasctic!  There are four big battles total which I will run down for you here:BATTLE 1:  This battle consists of the greeks first landing on the beach of Troy.  Brad er..uhh...I mean Achilles is amazing here.  He tears through the poor Trojans with such quickness and vigor that it is sure to bring out the inner man in all of you.BATTLE 2:  This is the biggest battle in the film, the main one, the big Kahuna if I may.  Thousands upon thousands of Greeks fight thousands of Trojans in front of their walls.  The visuals are fantastic.  For example: arrows fly from the city before raining down on the troops.  Also, in this battle is a cool confrontation between Hector and Ajax (I think that's his name).BATTLE 3:  The Trojans attack the Greeks on the beach in the early morning hours.  It is short but sweet.  The visuals are, once again, great.BATTLE 4:  I won't give away the ending but, the winner completely destroys the loser.All in all, this is an entertaining movie although the non-action scenes may make you want to puch a baby.

It has a very impressive cast list and uses a director who has made some excellent films in his time.That it succeeds partially is a tribute to most of the cast. Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole both give fine performances as the respective Kings of Greece and Troy. Eric Bana is pretty good as Hector and even Brad Pitt is reasonable as Achilles. The battle scenes are well done, although the over reliance on CGI effects is painfully obvious in places.However, Brad Pitt is not Russell Crowe (who when it matters is a really good actor), and for that matter Wolfgang Peterson is not as consistently a good filmmaker as Ridley Scott. In Gladiator I sympathised with Russell Crowe's character, and I hated Commodous. In Troy Hector was the most likable character but his future in the film was blatently obvious after a short period of time. Achilles was not a sympathetic character and sometimes I found Pitt a bit robotic.

I love Brad Pitt--not only is he easy on the eyes, he's a really good actor who usually does smart, good movies.  Orlando Bloom is awfully pretty and really good at the overly heroic idiot (Pirates of the Caribbean, anyone?) and I thought that would be perfect for Paris, who is the idol of idiot worshippers.Haha boy was I disappointed.  At first I was VERY upset about how they took the story of the Iliad and smashed it against an expensive wall so it shattered to millions of tiny, irreparable pieces.  No gods?  What?  How?!  Hell, I did an essay comaparing the gods' petty tiffs with the reality of deaths of their mortal counterparts.  The Iliad (and Troy) is simply deeply hampered without the gods.  And with a budget like they had, they could have done the gods and done them well.  Instead we get an extremely buff and tan Achilles pounding the theme of glory and immortality of the mortal through legend and whatnot throughout the entire freaking film.  Perhaps this was made for the intellectually challenged, but those of us with a brain really got sick of it.  God!  Subtlety people!  It exists, and is really quite amazing when done correctly.Anyway, lets forget that the classic story of the Iliad even exists.  Lets look at this seperatly as just a movie.I still say it sucked.  Brad Pitt's acting was subpar at best (why, Brad Pitt, why?  I respected you!) and Achille's storyline with Briseis was cornball central.  Oh!  She taught the big strong man how to feel!  It was completely fake.  And while we're talking about fake, lets move on to Paris and Helen.  Paris is a douchebag.  Helen should hate him.  Paris is NO reason to go into a ten year war.OMG and the ending . . . what a horror that was.  It was so cheesy.  The movie overall was just so stupid over and over and over.  And come on, Hollywood.  Patroclus was not Achilles cousin and you know it.If I had it my way, The Iliad and The Odessey would both be made into huge, epic films with three parts each so you can really get the majority of the storyline.  There would be gods, Paris would be hated by everyone, and Achilles would be shown for the ass that he really is.  The Iliad was supposed to be about Achilles wrath.

Well, to save you some grief, here's a review split for two different audiences.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKTroy is about a war between the Greeks and the Trojans.  The movie follows Achilles, who is the best fighter that the Greeks have to offer; so good in fact, that he can sway the outcome of a war just based on his participation.  Troy covers a little bit of a few different genres.  There is a love story, a tale of friendship, and of course a war.  However, if you are looking for an overly violent war epic, you may be somewhat dissappointed.  There isn't quite as much violence as you would think would be in a movie whose characters all use spears and swords.  All in all, 4 stars.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOKThe book was better, but you saw that coming from a mile away.  There are changes to the overall plot of the Iliad, and the movie even throws in the first few books of The Aeneid.  There are character who are eliminated entirely and others who die early on who do not die at all in the book.  Given all of that, the movie does still focus on the most central aspect of the Iliad, Achilles' rage.  It might be worth a rental.

852440,A26A64X86VL1R4,B0002Z0EXQ,Snowbrocade,"[6, 6]","This gorgeous film portrays a portion of Homer's Iliad, Achilles' story. Brad Pitt plays Achilles and brings to life this ancient warrior.  Despite no overt manifestation of the gods, Pitt manages to convey possession by the god of war or possesion by the warrior archetype in his body language and facial expression.  His intense physicalization of the role is typical of Pitt's talent and dedication to studying and learning a character.The crux of the matter is that Achilles is not a likeable character in the original.  He was a great warrior but he was childish and petulant.  In the movie they emphasize his lust for glory.  His pride and lack of impulse control exemplifies the dark side of the heroic which manifested in other great Greek heroes such as Hercules and Medea.  This heroic dark side is often ignored in modern heroic portrayal and leads to problems in our society.Pitt and Peterson did not flinch from portraying this darkness and in the process provided a portrait of the ugliness of war which I find psychologically useful in this modern era of war.  Achilles is balanced by the excellent and sympathetic portrayal of Hector by Eric Bana.  Continuing the theme of the problematic nature of war is the portrayal of Agammenon as a cynical warmonger who manipulates others in order to achieve his goal of hegemony.Of note is the wonderful acting performance in the portrayal of King Priam by O'Toole. One of the best scenes of the movie is where Priam goes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son.  The interaction/chemistry between the two actors was savory.  Both Pitt and O'Toole clearly have studied Homer's version and provide a poignant scene which underscores the tragedy of war.While this movie departs from the original I find it to be a satisfying and beautiful modernization of the story--certainly there is nothing to compare it to since nothing quite like this has been attempted in film.  My only complaint might be that I would have liked an attempt to portray the gods.  But perhaps the absence of gods is apt in our literal modern age where nature is de-sacralized and we put the gods in the service of our wars.",5,An epic battle of heroes; the loss of ancient civilizations.,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2154,"['gorgeous', 'film', 'portion', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'Achilles', 'story', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'life', 'ancient', 'warrior', 'overt', 'manifestation', 'gods', 'Pitt', 'convey', 'possession', 'god', 'war', 'possesion', 'warrior', 'archetype', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expression', 'intense', 'physicalization', 'role', 'typical', 'Pitt', 'talent', 'dedication', 'studying', 'learning', 'character.The', 'crux', 'matter', 'Achilles', 'not', 'likeable', 'character', 'original', 'was', 'great', 'warrior', 'was', 'childish', 'petulant', 'movie', 'emphasize', 'lust', 'glory', 'pride', 'lack', 'impulse', 'control', 'dark', 'side', 'heroic', 'manifested', 'other', 'great', 'Greek', 'heroes', 'such', 'Hercules', 'Medea', 'heroic', 'dark', 'side', 'often', 'ignored', 'modern', 'heroic', 'portrayal', 'problems', 'society.Pitt', 'Peterson', 'did', 'not', 'flinch', 'portraying', 'darkness', 'process', 'provided', 'portrait', 'ugliness', 'war', 'find', 'psychologically', 'useful', 'modern', 'era', 'war', 'Achilles', 'balanced', 'excellent', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Continuing', 'theme', 'problematic', 'nature', 'war', 'portrayal', 'Agammenon', 'cynical', 'warmonger', 'who', 'others', 'order', 'achieve', 'goal', 'hegemony.Of', 'note', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'King', 'Priam', ""O'Toole"", 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'Priam', 'Achilles', 'beg', 'body', 'son', 'interaction/chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'was', 'savory', 'Pitt', ""O'Toole"", 'clearly', 'have', 'studied', 'Homer', 'version', 'provide', 'poignant', 'scene', 'tragedy', 'war.While', 'movie', 'original', 'find', 'be', 'satisfying', 'beautiful', 'modernization', 'story', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'compare', 'nothing', 'quite', 'been', 'attempted', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'might', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'attempt', 'portray', 'gods', 'perhaps', 'absence', 'gods', 'apt', 'literal', 'modern', 'age', 'where', 'nature', 'de-sacralized', 'put', 'gods', 'service', 'wars']",N/A

It's been a long time since I read The Iliad (and even then I might have sorta skimmed it...), but I remember it was long and sprawling and not very moving. The movie was long and sprawling but it did make an attempt at being moving, which I commend. It gave the characters motivations (which, as I recall, weren't entirely spelled out in The Iliad), and used the good Hollywood details, like Agamemnon stealing Briseis.That brings me to my one really big problem with the movie though. That supposed ""romance"" between Achilles and Briseis? What the crap was that? The worst scene in the whole movie was the one where Briseis was holding the knife against Brad Pitt's neck and suddenly, she's in love with him. Now I know all you English majors are going to go, ""But hate is so much closer to love than indifference and blah blah blah"" but I don't care. That scene sucked, and it made their whole romance unbelievable. Poo on the writers for not just making Achilles the big dumb brute he was supposed to be and trying to give him more motivation than ""kill kill kill"" and ""revenge revenge revenge."" That's all he really needed anyway.As a side note, I don't care for Brad Pitt bulked up. I much prefer the skinny Ocean's Eleven version.Excellent casting on Helen. I'd launch a few ships for her, if not a thousand, and I'm not even a lesbian.Oh, and best quote from the movie:""Wars are about young men fighting and old men talking,"" spoken by Odysseus, who had a surprisingly minor role in the movie.Overall, I was not moved.

852445,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0002Z0EXQ,S. Schell,"[18, 21]","Before ""Troy"" was ever released, it was subject to comparison to 2000's Oscar-winning film ""Gladiator"".  The time period that both take place in is similar and both have their roots in Greek/Roman history.  The films have their obvious heroes and protagonists and one veteran actor from the golden age of Hollywood (Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris).  Even the score by Howard Shore (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) seeks to imitate the haunting eastern chants created by composer Lisa Gerrard (Whale Rider, The Insider).  Despite its best efforts to measure up, ""Gladiator"" is both technically and artistically a better film than ""Troy"" and the rest of this review will more than explain why.For this story, the clock rewinds 3200 years, the opening scene a blown-up map of the Greek empire during 1100 BC.  Many of Greece's cities are now under the rule of the militaristic autocrat Agamemnon (Cox), save one - Thessaly, a coastal region that resides westward of King Priam's (O'Toole) proud municipality of Troy.  Agamemnon's brother and fellow sovereign Menelaus (Gleeson) is amicable to the Trojans, inviting them to a sumptuous repast in his homeland of Sparta.  Rather than feasting his eyes on the myriad of dancing ladies that frolic about the banquet table, Prince Paris (Bloom) instead gazes longingly at Menelaus's young and resplendent wife Helen (Kruger).  Little does Menelaus know, Helen has been cavorting with Paris for quite some time and after another passionate embrace that evening, the prince beseeches her to steal away with him back to Troy.  Knowing the dissension her departure from Sparta will cause, Helen nonetheless lets her heart rule her head and boards a Trojan ship, instigating a war that will last for nearly fourteen years.The movie's greatest assets lie with the aforementioned O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia, My Favorite Year) and Eric Bana (The Hulk).  Bana maintains a strong sense of integrity as Hector, heir to the throne of Troy and a great warrior in his own right.  O'Toole is mesmerizing in his every scene, such a commanding presence that the role of Priam is almost beneath him.  He even commented that in his heyday, he would've ""murdered to play Achilles or Hector"".  What a killer performance he would've given.Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) coasts along, letting his looks do most of the work and later on takes to a bow like a master (visions of Legolas are hard to avoid when he swiftly and accurately deposits arrows into his enemies).  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson look more like Vikings than Greeks, Cox devouring the role of Agamemnon with zeal - a little too much for his own good.  Sean Bean makes a respectable walk-on as does Julie Christie and Rose Byrne is passable as the vestal virgin Briseis.According to legend, Helen of Sparta was a REAL looker.  The ""face that launched 1,000 ships"" beheld a magic spell - one look at her ravishing physiognomy and a man was completely at her mercy.  German model Diane Kruger is no ugly duckling but she is also not phenomenal, either.  You would think a make-up artist would do their best to show off a woman's NATURAL beauty at a time when eyeshadow and mascara weren't available but Kruger's pleasant visage is loaded with cosmetics (Rose Byrne's mascara ran in every weepy scene).  It may as well be a Maybelline ad, not a period piece.As far as aesthetics, Brad Pitt is perfect as the unyielding Achilles.  With a 6-month training period before shooting in Malta even began, Pitt defined every major muscle group with the help of personal trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche.  The result is sizable biceps, thick and defined hamstrings and calves and perfect pectorals offset by a rippling six-pack.  His body alone is a wonder of the world.His acting, however, is less than legendary.Try as he might, Pitt is not made for a purely dramatic role and the portrayal of the stalwart Achilles suffers for it.  The dialogue loses some of its integrity for three reasons: Pitt rushes it, misinterprets it and tries ever so delicately to imply a British accent, no doubt to feel up to his British peers (Bloom, Bana, O'Toole, etc.).  ""Devil's Own"" was proof enough that Pitt is not adept at faking it, but thankfully he doesn't embarrass himself to that level here.  All the same, his awkwardness in Achilles's shoes is felt and don't let the rumors about his supposed ""nude scene"" fool you - not even a full shot of his tone, tanned glutes is available.  Of course, this rumor was designed to get the women flocking en masse to the cineplex, as was the casting of two other hard bodies with handsome mugs (Bana, Bloom).The script is highly lacking - there are shining moments, such as the meeting between Priam and Achilles after the poignant death of an integral character and Achilles's first encounter with Prince Hector while sacking a sacred temple.  The rest lies flat, particularly the dialogue between foes.  There is either too much talk or not enough of it and the exchange is spiritless and inconsequential.  The villains of the story are hard to appreciate for their duplicity nearly as much as the conniving Commodus of ""Gladiator"" (bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix) and the central female character of Helen is meek compared to the dignified and discerning Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).""Troy"" also attempts to wow the pants off its audience with its myriad of CGI tricks, the movie's visual effects team creating tens upon thousands of digital soldiers for the storming of Troy's beaches and the sweeping vista of the 1,000 ships that sail across the Aegean on their way to war.  ""Gladiator"" had a much smaller digital stratagem, the most major being the coliseum that resided in the heart of Rome.  With half its images created by a series of complicated clicks on a mouse, ""Troy"" can't really be praised for exquisite cinematography - it's practically farmed in techno-land.So if you're headed to the video store this evening and can't decide between ""Gladiator"" or ""Troy"", this review should help you make a quick (and smart) decision.",2,Egregious Epic,1091404800,"08 2,

Hollywood's big budget adaptation of The Illiad conveniently came out at a time when this kind of film is at it's high.  Parts of the book are randomly tossed out to keep the action going and the target audience happy.  Characters speak in a modernized English which is annoying.  In order to guarantee box office success, a big name actor is put in the starring role, even though they're not right for the part.  In this case Brad Pitt as Achilles.  I don't really have anything against Pitt, but he's no Achilles no matter what reviewers here might say.  Obviously they never read the book. How many of you have read The Illiad and thought to yourself, ""Boy, wouldn't Brad Pitt make a great Achilles?""  Probably none of you.  If memory serves, Achilles is described as seven feet tall and four feet wide.  Not very Brad Pitt-like.  Personally I think Dolph Lundgren would make a pretty cool Achilles. That would never happen though coz he's not pretty or popular enough, though he'd do a better job.  Peter O'Toole is good as usual, so is Brian Cox.  Eric Bana is a decent Hector and Orlando Bloom has finally found a role that suits his talents-a whiney wuss.  For once CGI is used to good effect, making the battle scenes impressive.

852447,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B0002Z0EXQ,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","The over 30 minutes of additional footage greatly enhance the theatrical release of this thoroughly interesting and exciting film.  One of Brad Pitts best films, and highly underrated, the video transfer is very good, sharp and detailed though out with no grain or video noise that I could detect.  The audio however, really could have used a more detailed mix into discreet channels as there is certainly enough action both in front and behind the viewer that a more thorough use of the rear channels would have been beneficial.  The additional footage is not just gratuitous cut scenes but actually do go further to enhance the story lines and create depth to the characters.  That the director himself states that this longer version is what he had initially envisioned adds to its validity.Though the story is not completely historically accurate according to the works of Homer, it never the less, is great watching.

852449,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B0002Z0EXQ,Steven A. Peterson,"[1, 1]","""Troy"" is an example of not taking your subject seriously.  Homer's twin epics, ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"" are sprawling, have lots of scenes, meander, and are not necessarily great movies in the making.  But Homer's epics could be mined for the right material to make a good movie.  But this isn't it.First, the acting is not always so hot.  Paris comes across as such a wimp that it is rather hard to take.  Eric Bana creates a character who seems to recognize the tragedy that is occurring, but--compared with a wonderfully sculpted Brad Pitt--he doesn't look like he could hold his own with him in combat, which diminishes the impact of their inevitable one on one battle.  Brad Pitt, as Achilles, seems pretty shallow, although he looks great.  Peter O'Toole, playing Trojan King Priam, is not a terribly compelling figure.Second, Homer (not Homer Simpson! Homer, the poet who created ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"") disappears as the script goes bizarre.  Menelaus and Ajax die as portrayed in this version? The same with Agamemnon? There's enough pizzazz in Homer's work not to have to resort to the butchery of his works for alterations that are unnecessary.Third, for some pluses.  This is gorgeously shot; the battles scenes are well played; the computer graphics work well and are not over obtrusive. The depiction is near spectacular.  Even though it bears only a modest resemblance to Homer (for which, ultimately, I'm old-fashioned enough that I cannot forgive the perpetrators), it is all to the good that people ignorant of his work will at least have some faint knowledge of it  by watching this. Maybe a few more people might actually read his work after having viewed this flick. If so, this movie has made its own contribution.I tend to rate products pretty positively, since I normally review things that I like.  This movie I don't like so much.  But, on the other hand, if you want to see a buff Brad Pitt, lots of spectacle, fine special effects, even if the movie greatly ignores Homer, then you'll probably enjoy this.

852450,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B0002Z0EXQ,Steven Hancock,"[4, 6]","According to Homer's ""The Illiad"" (which may or may not have been based on an actual event), the love between Trojan prince Paris and Helen of Troy caused the great city of Troy to fall. Similarly, Wolfgang Petersen's epic ""Troy"" nearly falls itself.The storytelling is fairly weak. The set-up for the tale goes by too fast, and little time is spent on really getting to know many of the characters of the film. The battle sequences are big and well-crafted with fantastic choreography and breathtaking CG effects, but they lack both the excitement and emotion that were clearly evident in Oliver Stone's superb epic ""Alexander.""The casting is also a problem. Like most other people, I agree that Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles. I've never liked Pitt as an actor, and the character is portrayed more as an anti-hero. Brian Cox does not make Agememnon a convincing leader, or villain for that matter. Orlando Bloom seems to still be channeling Will Turner from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in his portrayal of Paris.However, there are some great performances. Eric Bana is great as Hector. I rooted for him in the one-on-one battle with Achilles, even though I knew what the outcome would be. Peter O'Toole is great at giving Trojan King Priam a Shakespearean feel. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. If they ever do ""The Odyssey,"" he should be approached to do so. It is these performances that make the 162-minute film bearable.Overall, the film is mostly a letdown. It has some good moments in terms of acting and battle, but I recommend ""Alexander"" as the best ""Sword and Sandals"" epic of 2004. As for ""Troy,"" it's best to be viewed once, and that is all.Movie/DVD Grade: C+",3,"""TROY:"" NO GIFT FROM THE GODS!",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1675,"['According', 'Homer', 'Illiad', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'love', 'Trojan', 'prince', 'Paris', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'caused', 'great', 'city', 'Troy', 'fall', 'Similarly', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'epic', 'Troy', 'nearly', 'itself.The', 'storytelling', 'fairly', 'weak', 'set-up', 'tale', 'too', 'fast', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'really', 'getting', 'know', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'big', 'well-crafted', 'fantastic', 'choreography', 'breathtaking', 'CG', 'effects', 'lack', 'excitement', 'emotion', 'were', 'clearly', 'evident', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'superb', 'epic', 'Alexander', 'casting', 'also', 'problem', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'agree', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'miscast', 'Achilles', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Pitt', 'actor', 'character', 'portrayed', 'more', 'anti-hero', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'not', 'make', 'Agememnon', 'convincing', 'leader', 'villain', 'matter', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'still', 'be', 'channeling', 'Will', 'Turner', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'portrayal', 'Paris.However', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'great', 'Hector', 'rooted', 'one-on-one', 'battle', 'Achilles', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'outcome', 'would', 'be', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'great', 'giving', 'Trojan', 'King', 'Priam', 'Shakespearean', 'feel', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'great', 'Odysseus', 'ever', 'do', 'Odyssey', 'should', 'be', 'approached', 'do', 'so', 'performances', 'make', '162-minute', 'film', 'bearable.Overall', 'film', 'mostly', 'letdown', 'good', 'moments', 'terms', 'acting', 'battle', 'recommend', 'Alexander', 'best', 'Sword', 'Sandals', 'epic', '2004', 'Troy', 'best', 'be', 'viewed', 'once', 'all.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'C+']",N/A

852452,A3399PIYZXPD0G,B0002Z0EXQ,Steven Laine,"[8, 9]","What an unengaging, bloated, crepe-papered high school gymnasium of a forgettable film! The casting is off, the acting is below average, the sets and special effects are uninspired and they let it run on for over two and a half hours. It's as if the producers figured they had Pitt on board and that would be enough to get people into the theaters. It almost is.The casting was distracting with Pitt ok, but Bloom and Bana are miscast and unbelievable as Paris and Hector. Bana is supposed to be the great warrior and hero but has the build of an accountant. I'm really starting to favor the approach they use to cast Harry Potter films; use someone right for the role rather than simply finding an available big name movie star. The acting in Troy is very average and I always felt like I was watching movie stars reading lines rather than actors bringing characters to life, (except for O'Toole, he was great, and Brian Cox as Agamemnon was pretty good.)The romance between Paris (Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger), which is the motivation for the war that sends 1,000 ships across the Aegean, came across as a zipless pick-up between two school kids with hot pants rather than a love affair told through the ages.The special effects were either ordinary or else jarringly noticeable. For instance, the scene where the camera pulls back from a close-up of Pitt on the deck of a ship to ultimately a birds-eye view of the 1,000-ship navy was impressive in the trailers. Here in the theater however, I found myself trying to figure out which ships were real and which were added in because there is no possible way to do it in real life. The sets too, looked like they were not a real city but simply built for the film. By contrast, look at the Lord of the Rings with its seamless use of special effects to round out battle scenes with huge army's or setting that looked real and lived in like the The Shire or Helm's Deep; they seemed like real places, not just movie sets. We have also already seen the clash of huge army's in LOTR, the Mummy Returns and others. Why do we need to see it here, looking exactly the same, AND several times? Sure, you have to show battle scenes, but have some original vision.Brad Pitt is fun to watch, without doubt, especially when he is moving and jumping in battle, but his acting was only average in this, not nearly as believable as he has been in the past, say in Fight Club. His lines sound like he is reading them rather than living them. Maybe costume spectaculars aren't the right vehicle for him.There is no reason for the obese length of this movie, coming in at 242 minutes. If they just limited it to 2 or 3 drawn out funeral pyre scenes, rather than the indomitable 4 or 5 they could have shaved off 15 minutes. I like long movies when there is a real justification for it but this movie is crying out for some straight- forward editing.Surprisingly, disappointingly, a very forgettable movie of an unforgettable tale. You'd think that would be hard to accomplish, but they hit that nail square on the head.

852453,A3TEH90X39WC8F,B0002Z0EXQ,"Stuart W. Mirsky ""swm""","[0, 0]","Based loosely on Homer's Iliad, this film recreates the Trojan war in telescoped form, compressing a decade and more of momentous events into a few weeks of political maneuvering and a few days of outright fighting. It succeeds in a variety of ways.It creates an authentic seeming eastern Mediterranean bronze age world, not infected by the latter day Greece of classical times (which is more familiar to us), and thereby establishes a convincing cultural backdrop for the decisions which may actually have driven the events recorded by Homer. The war, itself, is shown for what it most probably was, a power-driven effort by one group to dominate another, and not a massive effort to reclaim a wayward woman.The characters, though drastically shrunk in number from those who people the Iliad, come convincingly to life through the efforts of screenwriter and actors. Though Helen herself is rather stiffly portrayed, Brad Pitt, despite complaints by some, gives us a very convincing and human Achilles. He does seem a little wooden at times though, particularly when confronting Peter O'Toole's Priam. That scene was the powerful denouement of the Iliad and called for more vitality from Achilles, as the man is at last awakened from his self-absorbed bronze age heroic persona, than Pitt managed to provide. But Pitt is excellent as the warrior par excellence and makes real the myth of an invincible Achilles as he practices and teaches and kills those around him.License was taken with the story as characters are knocked off who supposedly lived through the Trojan war and much has necessarily been left out. Still, that is to be expected in a film treatment of such a huge tale and, all in all, most of it was well done. True, Orlando Bloom's Paris is a little hard to take but then so was the original character who is basically a sneak and a bit of a coward in the original. The priestess, Briseis, who is captured by Achilles and becomes the cause of his rift with his fellow Achaeans when Agamemnon claims her for his own, is nicely portrayed in this film. Her part has been enhanced here from the original in which she was little more than a prop whose possession triggers the anger of Achilles against his leader and thereby sets the entire Achaean enterprise at risk.Eric Bana's Hector seemed wooden and a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes to have been the great champion of Troy he is supposed to have been and it was a little hard to imagine him standing up for long against Achilles as, of course, he ultimately must do. Of course, even in the original Iliad he doesn't really stand his ground before that fierce warrior but, rather, breaks and flees before Achilles who chases him around the walls of Troy before finally killing him with a spear thrust. Still, that is not quite how the great duel between the champions is portrayed here though it is handled well enough.The actors, director and choreographers seem to have captured the manner in which the ancient Acheaeans might really have moved in battle, as seen in the pictures on pottery shards that have come down to us from that era. In a stylish blending of ancient acrobatics, modern martial arts and, perhaps, not a little dance, Pitt's Achilles demonstrates why he is the unchallenged master of war and individual combat for which the legends seem to remember him.Alas, the episode of the Trojan Horse is a bit of a letdown and seems almost an afterthought in the narrative. It's particularly disappointing when the Trojans foolishly disregard the obvious (to us) threat the wooden statue poses and heedlessly drag it into their city, giving the Greeks the opening they've long sought. But then I don't suppose there was any better way to present this. How do you create suspense when something like this is so much a part of our historical background?This tale is dramatically tighter than its literary antecedent but, in the end, it does not quite rise to the power of its predecessor. Still, it's finely done despite that and worth seeing.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga",4,A Very Respectable Rendering of the Trojan War,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,4061,"['Based', 'loosely', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'film', 'Trojan', 'war', 'telescoped', 'form', 'compressing', 'decade', 'more', 'momentous', 'events', 'few', 'weeks', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'few', 'days', 'outright', 'fighting', 'variety', 'ways.It', 'authentic', 'seeming', 'eastern', 'Mediterranean', 'bronze', 'age', 'world', 'not', 'infected', 'latter', 'day', 'Greece', 'classical', 'times', 'more', 'familiar', 'thereby', 'convincing', 'cultural', 'backdrop', 'decisions', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'driven', 'events', 'recorded', 'Homer', 'war', 'shown', 'what', 'most', 'probably', 'was', 'power-driven', 'effort', 'one', 'group', 'dominate', 'not', 'massive', 'effort', 'reclaim', 'wayward', 'woman.The', 'characters', 'drastically', 'shrunk', 'number', 'who', 'people', 'Iliad', 'come', 'convincingly', 'life', 'efforts', 'screenwriter', 'actors', 'Helen', 'rather', 'stiffly', 'portrayed', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'complaints', 'very', 'convincing', 'human', 'Achilles', 'seem', 'little', 'wooden', 'times', 'particularly', 'when', 'confronting', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Priam', 'scene', 'was', 'powerful', 'denouement', 'Iliad', 'called', 'more', 'vitality', 'Achilles', 'man', 'last', 'awakened', 'self-absorbed', 'bronze', 'age', 'heroic', 'persona', 'Pitt', 'managed', 'provide', 'Pitt', 'excellent', 'warrior', 'par', 'excellence', 'real', 'myth', 'invincible', 'Achilles', 'practices', 'teaches', 'kills', 'him.License', 'was', 'taken', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'knocked', 'off', 'who', 'supposedly', 'lived', 'Trojan', 'war', 'much', 'necessarily', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Still', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'treatment', 'such', 'huge', 'tale', 'most', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'True', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Paris', 'little', 'hard', 'take', 'then', 'so', 'was', 'original', 'character', 'who', 'basically', 'sneak', 'bit', 'coward', 'original', 'priestess', 'Briseis', 'who', 'captured', 'Achilles', 'cause', 'rift', 'fellow', 'Achaeans', 'when', 'Agamemnon', 'own', 'nicely', 'portrayed', 'film', 'part', 'been', 'enhanced', 'here', 'original', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'prop', 'possession', 'anger', 'Achilles', 'leader', 'thereby', 'entire', 'Achaean', 'enterprise', 'risk.Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'seemed', 'wooden', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'goody-two-shoes', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'champion', 'Troy', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'imagine', 'standing', 'up', 'long', 'Achilles', 'course', 'ultimately', 'must', 'do', 'course', 'even', 'original', 'Iliad', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'ground', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'rather', 'breaks', 'flees', 'Achilles', 'who', 'walls', 'Troy', 'finally', 'killing', 'spear', 'thrust', 'Still', 'not', 'quite', 'how', 'great', 'duel', 'champions', 'portrayed', 'here', 'handled', 'well', 'enough.The', 'actors', 'director', 'choreographers', 'seem', 'have', 'captured', 'manner', 'ancient', 'Acheaeans', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'moved', 'battle', 'seen', 'pictures', 'pottery', 'shards', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'era', 'stylish', 'blending', 'ancient', 'acrobatics', 'modern', 'martial', 'arts', 'perhaps', 'not', 'little', 'dance', 'Pitt', 'Achilles', 'why', 'unchallenged', 'master', 'war', 'individual', 'combat', 'legends', 'seem', 'remember', 'him.Alas', 'episode', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'bit', 'letdown', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'narrative', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'when', 'Trojans', 'foolishly', 'disregard', 'obvious', 'threat', 'wooden', 'statue', 'poses', 'heedlessly', 'drag', 'city', 'giving', 'Greeks', 'opening', ""'ve"", 'long', 'sought', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'was', 'better', 'way', 'present', 'How', 'do', 'create', 'suspense', 'when', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'historical', 'background', 'tale', 'dramatically', 'tighter', 'literary', 'antecedent', 'end', 'not', 'quite', 'rise', 'power', 'predecessor', 'Still', 'finely', 'done', 'worth', 'seeing.SWMauthor', 'King', 'Vinland', 'Saga']",N/A

While the film itself is well produced and acted, Pitt just wasn't right for the role.  Yes, he looks the part with his rippling muscles, but Achilles (Pitt) is waaaay too introspective and conflicted as a killing machine for the army.Perhaps he was like this because he was rumored to be partly parented by a god/goddess, but still, Pitt was out of place in Troy.  Also, Pitt's delivery of his lines was less than desirable.  Through all his muddled emotions he comes off as if he could give a hoot about what he's talking about.The action was done well and Eric Bana did a much better job of acting (maybe he and PItt should have switched roles) - the battle between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) was especially good.I'm only going to mention Orlando Bloom once:  He looked like an utter fruitcake in this film.  I understand that was in part to his character, but come on!  What's up with that late 80's era Michael Jackson hair he was sporting?

Why not let Menelaus live and have Paris killed instead?? In the actual legend, it's more like reality check, not just black and white (good lives, evil dies). Puuuuhhhlease!!Been reading every version of this story, and consistency is the name of the game. Until this horrible movie came out. Now, history and literature will never be the same.This movie is nothing but a vehicle for Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. Brad's acting sucks, about as bad as Tom Cruise's (ever noticed the so-called cute lil' actors can't act at all)?? And Orlando's character should've been eliminated 'bout halfway down the movie. Bad, bad script.There are two outstanding actors who performed so well. Eric Bana's Hector as the loyal but conflicted big brother and responsible son is so convincing you can't help but feel sorry for him after he was killed by a terrible actor....er...warrior.And Brian Cox is always excellent in any role he portrays. Now wonder he was awfully pissed when they (the dumbass writers) killed his brother, Menelaus (Gleeson, who should've broken Bloom's wimpy back for good).No, this movie could've been better if only the central characters didn't revolve around Pitt and Bloom.

And I guess Charlton Heston's recent demise made me want to see an old fashioned, 'Hollywood' take of an epic subject.What a surprise TROY is.  I remember it only garned so-so official reviews, with lots of semi-snide comments about Brad Pitt's pecs and his newly refined accent, etc.  Even though this version isn't the 196 minute director's cut, which is supposed to supply more narrative flow, I'm impressed enough with this version to recommend it.  Any one of the various battle scenes, certainly, are worth the price.  It's been ages since I read The Iliad, and that was for college lit class (so ""ages"" is the appropriate word), but I didn't have any trouble following the narrative.  I've read snobbish carping comments about TROY's lack of fidelity to The Iliad, but I never look to a Hollywood film for literary or historical accuracy -- just a good story well told.If Brad Pitt isn't quite the greatest actor here (and I hope the director's cut might change that impression), the performances of Brian Cox; Eric Bana; Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean more than make up for Pitt's occasional flatness.  Personally, I didn't sense much chemistry in his scenes with Rose Byrne.  I think Pitt's best scenes were during his meeting with King Priam (Hector's father), and what happens afterward.  Also, Pitt's scenes with Brian Cox as the contemptable King Agamemmnon; these scenes have energy and passion.  The viewer knows they hate each other, but each is forced to use the other, if only temporarily.For me, the brief scenes portraying the relationship between Eric Bana (Hector) and the actress who plays his wife, are more sensual and emotionally affecting than anything between Orlando Bloom (Paris) and Diane Kruger (Helen), and/or Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne.  I think it's the fact that Hector is happily married and just wants to savor his life with his wife and son; that does it... at least for me.  Sure, illicit love has its moments, but married and happy, the way Eric Bana plays it, is very sexy too.  (Think GLADIATOR, when all Maximus really wanted was to return home to his wife and son.  A woman likes to see that kind of thing!)So in all, I was pleasantly impressed and surprised by TROY.

Yates,"[10, 18]","if you're like me, you rarely like a film with that ""written in committee""-feel. more scenes with certain actors are thrown in because they want to market the film more on that particular person. 'troy' takes that mentality to the extreme. forget suspension of disbelief: this film suffers from a lack of suspension of boredom of a load of studio executives sitting in around a table saying things like, ""ok, we've got brad pitt in this, so let's put lots of scenes with him in."" ""why not have him shirtless? appeal to a teenage-girl sort of market?"" ""perfect! and we'll cast orlando bloom!"" ""oh, the one who had about 10 lines in lord of the rings."" ""yeah, the teenage girls love him.""at this point I'm dying to interject: no, hollywood executives, it's not because he's ""orlando bloom"", it was because he was ""legolas"", and peter jackson is a skilled enough - not to mention visionary, which I wouldn't even bother trying to explain to these people - director and can actually make you lose sight of the fact that those are actors up there. 'troy' is mired in that fact.and while we're on the subject of unfavourable comparisons to lord of the rings, let's see what our committee is up to: ""oh, yeah, people love big battle scenes. have you seen the numbers for those ring-y movies?"" ""yeah, so we'll need lots of extras."" ""don't forget the horses!""wait a second here, executives. that sounds like you're making a 1940's western. wasn't that the very thing that killed 'old hollywood' the first time around? an emphasis on big stars and the ""see how many horses you can fit in the shot"" mentality? the battles in jackson's LOTR films succeed in that they actually FEEL huge, using a deft combination of emphasis on the gritty details of just one soldier and the 10,000 others all moving as one huge mass, telescoping back and forth seemingly effortlessly so that you are absorbed by the hugeness of everything while not losing sight of the characters. that takes creativity: peter jackson didn't just throw money at the problem to make it go away.'troy' doesn't understand that at all. boredom sets in after the first few seconds of any particular battle scene, and the drag only gets worse, pulling down everything with it, including acting and mere consistency with previous scenes. in the anti-climactic climax of one such battle, as we are forced to take in dialogue between an over-earnest eric bana with a regrettable choice of accent and a bored-looking brad pitt sacking the temple of apollo, one might think: hang about, have they conveniently forgotten the huge raging battle supposedly still taking place outside? because all we get is dead silence. the dialogue is so awful that any clanking of swords and shields outside might completely overshadow it.there's a lot of that kind of nit-picking to be done with many of the choices made in this film. to be fair, they were plagued by waterworld-esque weather and location problems, and at $200 million, you really just need to get the picture finished, because hey, no one's really happy that it cost that much in the first place. but if there's one thing I'd say is the most glaring error in this film, it's that it really has no audience. is it directed towards men? surely they'll be turned off by the parade of shirtless beaus strutting about like they're on the cover of a romance novel without any real female equivalent to counterbalance that (helen, the most beautiful woman in the world according to the story, is actually fairly dull in 'troy'. does that sum up the entire film?) is it directed towards teenage girls? they might be turned off by the stupid hollywood violence, the dialogue (""you are a great king because you love your country!"" ad nauseum), and... well, perhaps anything about this film, especially its generally chauvinist demeanor. families? no... students of the classics? no, the committee decided not to pander to them whatsoever fairly early on, it seems. ok, who's left... people who like bad films for a cheap laugh? well, at 2h 42m, it's really just too much of an investment. it's sure to bore the pants off of basically anyone.and they wonder why the hollywood studio system is doomed. anyone who helped put up the money for this film should feel very bad about what they've done, above and beyond the sorrow at having parted with that money for good. they've trusted a group of people and an entire system that doesn't really have a clue what it's doing. we've passed the age of 'bankable' stars and audiences who don't know that the studios think they're stupid. people are starting to get the message.",1,"I knew it would be bad, but this...",1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,4604,"[""'re"", 'rarely',

852459,A2N753IQ3DO8NO,B0002Z0EXQ,"T. Boards ""Azreal Cold""","[0, 3]","This is a very strange character omission from this movie,  In Greek mythology, Cassandra also known as Alexandra was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. Her beauty caused Apollo to grant her the gift of prophecy. However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions.In an alternative version, she spent a night at Apollo's temple, at which time the temple snakes licked her ears clean so that she was able to hear the future. This is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future.Apollo loved Cassandra, and when she did not return his love, he cursed her so that her gift would become a source of endless pain and frustration. In some versions of the myth, this is symbolized by the god spitting into her mouth; in other Greek versions, this act was sufficient to remove the gift so recently given by Apollo, but Cassandra's case varies. From the play Agamemnon, it appears that she made a promise to Apollo to become his consort, but broke it, thus incurring his wrath: though she retained the power of foresight, no one would believe her predictions. Telephus, the son of Heracles, loved Cassandra but she scorned him and instead helped him seduce her sister Laodice.While Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy (she warned the Trojans about the Trojan Horse, the death of Agamemnon, and her own demise), she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since they did not believe her.Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra. Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother Hector being brought back to the city.At the fall of Troy, she sought shelter in the temple of Athena, where she was violently abducted and raped by Ajax the Lesser. Cassandra was then taken as a concubine by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.I know to fit this story in with Troy would have been impossible but nonetheless, this woman should have been involved in this movie!

I have always wondered about the old saying that the Helen of Troy could launch a 1000 ships, because of her beauty! I always wondered why and how that could be done, and this movie gives you a real good idea of how it might have been, and you get the why and how to the ""Achilles Heel"" saying. And I have always wondered and hoped that the grand city of Troy really existed! I just love movies about places and people of long ago, you get to step back into time with them, and see how they lived and loved!This is a remarkable story about a grand high walled city being overtaken by a very big and mighty army! You will see a prince of Troy(Orlando Bloom), fall in love with a beautiful woman named Helen, and you will see the heir of Troy, Hector (Eric Bana), who is a very brave and mighty warrior stand up and fight against Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is one of the greatest warriors that ever lived, according to legend! Achilles and Hector are greatly admired by everyone because of their brave courage, and honor, and their skill on a battlefield, and because they have the ability and wisdom to lead men!This story has alot of action, and drama, it has it all; greedy lust for power, revenge, desire, love, war, heartbreak, courage, bravery, death, jealousy! I loved the beautiful costumes, and clothes, and all the grandeaur of the city of Troy, and the stunning visual scenes of the war and the mighty armies!Ladies there is alot of handsome men in this movie, and Guys there is alot of action in this movie!My favorite scene in this movie is when the King of Troy(Peter O'Toole) makes a surprise vist to Achilles, and I just loved this scene, it touched my heart. Peter O'Toole and Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did a outstanding job in this movie, they were just awesome! And I think that the people behind the scenes in making this movie did a outstanding job also, you can tell that a lot of hard work went into making this movie, because it is so real and alot of attention was paid to all these wonderful details, that made it so real and successful!I love ALL the handsome men in this movie and there was hundreds of them, and of course I loved Orlando Bloom, and I just loved Brad Pitt with his handsome self, as Achilles! WOW! I also loved the handsome king, that was Achilles friend; they all kept my eyes glued to the TV scene, but the one that touched my heart, and took my breath away with his handsome brave self was Hector,(Eric Bana)! This was the first time that I ever saw Eric Bana in any movie, and I thought he was just beautiful, and he became my favorite hero, he just melted my heart, with his courage and wisdom and his awesome beauty!

The DVD extras are boring but interesting for the fact the emphasis on battle scenes as opposed to characters & casting displays how much the filmmaker wanted to sweep the dirt under the carpet.  If there's no focus on the actors and their characters, then the audience might put less emphasis on laughable miscasting (Brad Pitt - one of the producers - so that explains why his character is the ""lead"" and the attempt to turn the self-absorbed egotist Achilles into someone admirable) and weird focus on characters, such as Briseus, who is only there to prove to the audience how ""lovable"" Achilles is.  In the extras, there aren't even any deleted scenes!  All the bad cliches of epics are here, and also a blatant rip-off of Peter Jackson's RINGS films, when it comes to sweeping focus on battle scenes & vistas, as well as continued earnestness.  I would say this film is borderline camp, only it's not fun enough to qualify.  And, unfortunately, the battles are empty here, they don't seem to serve a purpose except to say ""Hey, here's a battle.""  Since RINGS' battles tended toward the overlong, that's not altogether bad as it should give more time over into character.  However, the film does succeed on the eye candy basis, and to see the film for that alone, is actually the only reason to spend the time (or the money on the DVD).  Both Orlando Bloom as handsomest man Paris, and Sean Bean (both these guys RINGS alumni) as clever Odysseus - though he's underused and even physically faded a bit as he underwent a hair color change - are very suitable to their roles.  Diane Kruger is the blonde symmetrical perfection the Greeks would have revered as Helen.  Eric Bana's Hector is really the soul of the film, and consequently he has the best and most noble character, and to most people steals the film as Hector is the most sympathetic and competently played.  Interestingly, it is Paris who is the only character who has a true arc to play, as he starts as a foolish & romantic youth, to undergoing a change into responsible & honorable man, the kind of man and prince his brother Hector would respect (after a humiliating middle ground in the film).  The supporting parts are all well played, notably Brian Cox, who's in nearly every film made nowadays.  Indeed this was a nearly perfectly cast film, it is the execution by the screenplay and director that are at fault, where the emphasis is misplaced (and the unfortunate casting for Achilles and the exaggeration of that role).",3,Sheer Disappointment,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2607,"['Forgetting', 'completely', 'Homer', 'just', 'looking', 'film', 'DVD', 'have', 'confess', 'sheer', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'boring', 'interesting', 'fact', 'emphasis', 'battle', 'scenes', 'opposed', 'characters', 'casting', 'displays', 'how', 'much', 'filmmaker', 'wanted', 'sweep', 'dirt', 'carpet', 'focus', 'actors', 'characters', 'then', 'audience', 'might', 'put', 'less', 'emphasis', 'laughable', 'miscasting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'producers', 'so', 'why', 'character', 'lead', 'attempt', 'turn', 'self-absorbed', 'egotist', 'Achilles', 'someone', 'admirable', 'weird', 'focus', 'characters', 'such', 'Briseus', 'who', 'only', 'there', 'prove', 'audience', 'how', 'lovable', 'Achilles', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bad', 'cliches', 'epics', 'are', 'here', 'also', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'RINGS', 'films', 'when', 'sweeping', 'focus', 'battle', 'scenes', 'vistas', 'as', 'well', 'continued', 'earnestness', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'borderline', 'camp', 'only', 'not', 'fun', 'enough', 'qualify', 'unfortunately', 'battles', 'are', 'empty', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'serve', 'purpose', 'say', 'Hey', 'here', 'battle', 'RINGS', 'battles', 'tended', 'overlong', 'not', 'altogether', 'bad', 'should', 'give', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'However', 'film', 'succeed', 'eye', 'candy', 'basis', 'see', 'film', 'alone', 'actually', 'only', 'reason', 'spend', 'time', 'money', 'DVD', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'handsomest', 'man', 'Paris', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'guys', 'RINGS', 'alumni', 'clever', 'Odysseus', 'underused', 'even', 'physically', 'faded', 'bit', 'underwent', 'hair', 'color', 'change', 'are', 'very', 'suitable', 'roles', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'blonde', 'symmetrical', 'perfection', 'Greeks', 'would', 'have', 'revered', 'Helen', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hector', 'really', 'soul', 'film', 'consequently', 'best', 'most', 'noble', 'character', 'most', 'people', 'steals', 'film', 'Hector', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'competently', 'played', 'Interestingly', 'Paris', 'who', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'true', 'arc', 'play', 'foolish', 'romantic', 'youth', 'undergoing', 'change', 'responsible', 'honorable', 'man', 'kind', 'man', 'prince', 'brother', 'Hector', 'would', 'respect', 'humiliating', 'middle', 'ground', 'film', 'supporting', 'parts', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'notably', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'nearly', 'film', 'made', 'nowadays', 'Indeed', 'was', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'film', 'execution', 'screenplay', 'director', 'are', 'fault', 'where', 'emphasis', 'misplaced', 'unfortunate', 'casting', 'Achilles', 'exaggeration', 'role']",N/A

852472,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B0002Z0EXQ,Timothy Michael Resh,"[10, 11]","If you go to other reviews in this forum, you will find some very thoughtful, thorough reviews from people comparing this film to its source material, Homer's Iliad.  Such comparisons, while interesting and worthwhile, are really pointless, since Hollywood is notorious for taking perfectly good source material and inexplicably changing pieces of it for the purposes of condensing the story, expediting exposition, or simply focusing on a different aspect of the story than has traditionally been told.  Thus, it was probably good that my memory of reading the Iliad in high school was somewhat fuzzy--it was much better for me to consider the film on its own merits, even if it did depart from Homer's storyline in a few significant respects.Troy might well have been titled Achilles, for Brad Pitt's character is really the centerpiece of the film.  Pitt brings an earnest, amoral righteousness to Achilles that makes the viewer realize that there is more to Pitt than a pretty face, flowing locks, good muscle tone, and an all-over tan.  Although the screenwriting pushes Achilles' struggles with Agamemmnon and his own conscience to the forefront for much of the film, the rest of the ensemble cast is similarly well-chosen.  Brian Cox is sufficiently egomaniacal as Agamemmnon, Eric Bana (who has totally underwhelmed me with previous performances) actually shows a bit of range in this film as Hector, Sean Bean makes a believable Odysseus, and Peter O'Toole is stately as Priam.  Probably the best commentary on the acting in the film is that each main character comes off as both heroic and yet fatally flawed.  Strangely enough, the face that launched a thousand ships and whose infidelity actually precipitated the Trojan War, plays a relatively minor role in the film, although Kruger (the actress playing Helen) is appropriately beautiful and conflicted in her minor role.The major improvement over Homer is that, apart from a few statues, temples, and offhanded references, the Greek gods are basically nonexistent in the film, giving the characters a grounding in reality instead of the supernatural.  For the purposes of this film, that is a good thing, as bringing the involvement of the gods into the affairs of men would cloud an already complicated storyline of shaky and sometimes shifting allegiances.The battle sequences are generally magnificently done, particularly where Achilles is involved, and although much blood is spilled, few scenes seem gratuitous or pointless.  There is purpose in these battles--the Greeks are empire building and the Trojans are protecting their homeland.  And when Achilles joins the fray, look out.  His battle sequences are sufficiently entertaining to keep the viewer fully engaged and mesmerized, yet are understated enough to leave the viewer wanting more.The film's pacing is also better than most movies that exceed two hours--I rarely found myself clock watching.  Petersen's directing is also generally good, although even a relatively untrained eye like mine noted some awkward cuts and angles.After watching some recent disappointments passing themselves off as epics (see my review of King Arthur, for example), Troy was a breath of fresh air.  Homer it's not, but I didn't rent it expecting a strict interpretation.  The film does what it sets out to do, and does so in an entertaining manner, and that's all I was hoping for.  Watch the film and enjoy the performances, just don't confuse it with the Iliad.",4,An epic to watch without thinking too much,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,3476,"['go', 'other', 'reviews', 'forum', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'thorough', 'reviews', 'people', 'comparing', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'Such', 'comparisons', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'really', 'pointless', 'Hollywood', 'notorious', 'taking', 'perfectly', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'inexplicably', 'changing', 'pieces', 'purposes', 'condensing', 'story', 'expediting', 'exposition', 'simply', 'focusing', 'different', 'aspect', 'story', 'traditionally', 'been', 'told', 'Thus', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'memory', 'reading', 'Iliad', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'somewhat', 'fuzzy', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'consider', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'even', 'did', 'depart', 'Homer', 'storyline', 'few', 'significant', 'respects.Troy', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'really', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'Pitt', 'earnest', 'amoral', 'righteousness', 'Achilles', 'viewer', 'realize', 'more', 'Pitt', 'pretty', 'face', 'flowing', 'locks', 'good', 'muscle', 'tone', 'all-over', 'tan', 'screenwriting', 'pushes', 'Achilles', 'struggles', 'Agamemmnon', 'own', 'conscience', 'forefront', 'much', 'film', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'similarly', 'well-chosen', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'sufficiently', 'egomaniacal', 'Agamemmnon', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'totally', 'underwhelmed', 'previous', 'performances', 'actually', 'bit', 'range', 'film', 'Hector', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'believable', 'Odysseus', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'stately', 'Priam', 'Probably', 'best', 'commentary', 'acting', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'off', 'heroic', 'yet', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'face', 'launched', 'thousand', 'ships', 'infidelity', 'actually', 'precipitated', 'Trojan', 'War', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role', 'film', 'Kruger', 'actress', 'playing', 'Helen', 'appropriately', 'beautiful', 'conflicted', 'minor', 'role.The', 'major', 'improvement', 'Homer', 'apart', 'few', 'statues', 'temples', 'offhanded', 'references', 'Greek', 'gods', 'are', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'film', 'giving', 'characters', 'grounding', 'reality', 'instead', 'supernatural', 'purposes', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'bringing', 'involvement', 'gods', 'affairs', 'men', 'would', 'cloud', 'already', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'shaky', 'sometimes', 'shifting', 'allegiances.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'generally', 'magnificently', 'done', 'particularly', 'where', 'Achilles', 'involved', 'much', 'blood', 'spilled', 'few', 'scenes', 'seem', 'gratuitous', 'pointless', 'purpose', 'battles', 'Greeks', 'are', 'empire', 'building', 'Trojans', 'are', 'protecting', 'homeland', 'when', 'Achilles', 'fray', 'look', 'out', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'entertaining', 'keep', 'viewer', 'fully', 'engaged', 'mesmerized', 'are', 'understated', 'enough', 'leave', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more.The', 'film', 'pacing', 'also', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'exceed', 'two', 'hours', 'rarely', 'found', 'clock', 'watching', 'Petersen', 'directing', 'also', 'generally', 'good', 'even', 'relatively', 'untrained', 'eye', 'mine', 'noted', 'awkward', 'cuts', 'angles.After', 'watching', 'recent', 'disappointments', 'passing', 'off', 'epics', 'see', 'review', 'King', 'Arthur', 'example', 'Troy', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'rent', 'expecting', 'strict', 'interpretation', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'entertaining', 'manner', 'was', 'hoping', 'Watch', 'film', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'Iliad']",N/A

Kalamaras ""Scrivener""","[3, 3]","If you take this work as inspired by Homer's Illiad, but understand that it is not the Illiad, then you can enjoy it as a wonderful action adventure epic film complete in itself.However if you are overmuch concerned with the integrity of comparison between Homer and this movie, you will be disappointed.The enjoyable aspects have been well covered in other essays. I will touch on the one negative that can't be eliminated however, which comes from comparing the works, that was key to Peterson's film but likewise, integral to Homer.  That element is the voice and action of the gods.To Homer, and to the Greeks, the work was surely as much about gods as men.  In the Illiad, the gods enflesh themselves, they talk to each other, they talk to mortals, they fight and they are key and indispensible dramatis personae.Peterson eliminates them.  With all the imagination of a post-war, modern-day Freudian atheist, he just purged their existence as if they were imaginary.  As if there were no cult of Hellenistic gods that existed for centuries, that were the subjects of real worship, and the inspirational archetypes even for Christians in centuries since Constantine.  All that is gone, flushed away, and here you have the Kali-juga iron age  version instead.  Here the only Apollo is a dead statute that Achilles gets to deface and destroy.  In terms of the cultural vacuum of today's West, this is an apt artistic choice, but one that is made so unselfconsciously that it in itself is a desecration, a de-sacralization, of the Illiad, that is very much a religious epic as much as an adventure.By doing this Peterson makes way for a thrilling and enjoyable action-adventure film, based on the story of Troy, but he cheapens the content.  Yet in a way, could this work have been done in any other way today?  Concerning what we know of the irreligious, materialistic attitudes of ""Hollywood"" today I think probably not.If one can forget the religious and cultural signficance of the Illiad, then you can really enjoy this film.

I was hoping Troy would be a success, but instead I got a typical blockbuster mess.I think everyone knows the plot so I won't bore you explaining it. What I will talk about is the choice of looks, or fame, over acting credibility, which is most evident in the form of the pathetic Orlando Bloom. Ok, so all the little girls love him, but quite frankly all the little girls won't really be watching this film. He was laughable. His character Paris is meant to be weak at times, but not wooden, cheesy and ultimately melodramatic in ALL situations. Orlando added that in by himself. Brad Pitt was an acceptable Achilles, but again they went for aesthetics over acting, as he too appeared rather wooden at times, and once again lacked the vivacity and presence he displayed in his career-high point ""Fight Club"".On the upside, Eric Bana as Hector was very good and brought some realism into the film, with steady and believable acting. His down to Earth stytle boosted the film considerably, as did Peter O'Toole who put in another fine performance. Special mention should also go to Shaun Bean, who continues to revel in his smaller roles.The battle scenes, while good, are nothing new compared to Lord of the Rings.

852476,A2817E4ZO8LJ0M,B0002Z0EXQ,Tom Chatt,"[2, 3]","Though the ancient Greek poet Homer is given a co-writer credit, we had heard from advance buzz about the film that screenwriter David Benioff would be taking some liberties in adapting the Iliad to the big screen. In particular, we'd heard that Patroklos (who was Achilles' beloved in the original) would be his ""cousin"" in the movie, while a romantic line was added between Achilles and Briseus (who in the original was one of two captured trophy maidens, more a conquest than a love interest). Some changes were inevitable in the adaptation, for instance, in the Iliad, the Trojan War lasts nearly a decade, while in the movie it seems to last maybe a few weeks. And there were quite a number of changes made for the sake of the story (the IMDB page has a pretty good list). All of that notwithstanding, I think that the film turned out to be a great story and thematically quite faithful to the original, even while liberally rearranging the specifics. One of Homer's great themes is the contrast between the glory and horror of the war (two sides of the same coin) versus home and family life. The film sets this theme up in the beginning, with a beautiful invented scene between Achilles and his mother the sea nymph Thetis, in which she foretells two possible futures for him -- one going to Troy, dying young and achieving eternal fame, the other staying home and enjoying children and grandchildren over a long life. (Julie Christie is marvelous as Thetis.) Later in the film, there are some family scenes with the Trojan hero Hector with his wife and young baby, torn between wanting to stay with his family versus his duty to go and fight the war in which he's likely to get killed. (Eric Bana gives just the right balance of noble warrior and tender husband and father.) The sentiment is very true to Homer. One scene that was particularly true to Homer, both in theme and detail, was when King Priam sneaks into Achilles' tent to beg for the return of his slain son's body. (Peter O'Toole is brilliant as Priam, and particularly shines in this scene.)Director Wolfgang Peterson has done a good job of crafting this film as an epic. The scenes of the walled city of Troy, the masses of Greek ships at sea, and the battles were well worthy of big-screen viewing. And the adaptation does well in capturing the sense of great heroes waging the battle amidst the thousands of troops, and the classic sense of honor among them. Amidst the epic, he skilfully develops a number of characters. The romantic tension between Achilles and Briseis is a nice invention, with each coming to love and admire the other's strength of character. Achilles is rightly portrayed as both noble (as we see not only with his treatment of his captive Briseis, but also his concern for his ""cousin"" and for his men) and also egoistic, a bit of a pouty prima donna. Agamemnon is painted as political and power-craving, and the dynamic between the two is nicely done. Brad Pitt does an outstanding job portraying the moody hero, and the film does not disappoint those who would go just to get a good look at this gorgeous actor in action. (He has seriously worked out for this role, and it shows.) Orlando Bloom plays a naturally impetuous Paris who struggles to become responsible in the end. All in all, some great performances, a visual feast, a good solid story with engaging characters, and a memorable adaptation of a classic work.",4,"True to the spirit, if not the letter, of the original",1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,3421,"['ancient', 'Greek', 'poet', 'Homer', 'given', 'co-writer', 'credit', 'had', 'heard', 'advance', 'buzz', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Benioff', 'would', 'be', 'taking', 'liberties', 'adapting', 'Iliad', 'big', 'screen', 'particular', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Patroklos', 'who', 'was', 'Achilles', 'beloved', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'cousin', 'movie', 'romantic', 'line', 'was', 'added', 'Achilles', 'Briseus', 'who', 'original', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'captured', 'trophy', 'maidens', 'more', 'conquest', 'love', 'interest', 'changes', 'were', 'inevitable', 'adaptation', 'instance', 'Iliad', 'Trojan', 'War', 'nearly', 'decade', 'movie', 'last', 'maybe', 'few', 'weeks', 'were', 'quite', 'number', 'changes', 'made', 'sake', 'story', 'IMDB', 'page', 'pretty', 'good', 'list', 'notwithstanding', 'think', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'story', 'thematically', 'quite', 'faithful', 'original', 'even', 'liberally', 'rearranging', 'specifics', 'One', 'Homer', 'great', 'themes', 'contrast', 'glory', 'horror', 'war', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'versus', 'home', 'family', 'life', 'film', 'theme', 'up', 'beginning', 'beautiful', 'invented', 'scene', 'Achilles', 'mother', 'sea', 'nymph', 'Thetis', 'two', 'possible', 'futures', 'one', 'going', 'Troy', 'dying', 'young', 'achieving', 'eternal', 'fame', 'other', 'staying', 'home', 'enjoying', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'long', 'life', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'marvelous', 'Thetis', 'Later', 'film', 'are', 'family', 'scenes', 'Trojan', 'hero', 'Hector', 'wife', 'young', 'baby', 'torn', 'wanting', 'stay', 'family', 'duty', 'go', 'fight', 'war', 'likely', 'get', 'killed', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'noble', 'warrior', 'tender', 'husband', 'father', 'sentiment', 'very', 'true', 'Homer', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'true', 'Homer', 'theme', 'detail', 'was', 'when', 'King', 'Priam', 'Achilles', 'tent', 'beg', 'return', 'slain', 'son', 'body', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'brilliant', 'Priam', 'particularly', 'shines', 'scene', 'Director', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'crafting', 'film', 'epic', 'scenes', 'walled', 'city', 'Troy', 'masses', 'Greek', 'ships', 'sea', 'battles', 'were', 'well', 'worthy', 'big-screen', 'viewing', 'adaptation', 'well', 'capturing', 'sense', 'great', 'heroes', 'waging', 'battle', 'thousands', 'troops', 'classic', 'sense', 'honor', 'Amidst', 'epic', 'skilfully', 'number', 'characters', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Achilles', 'Briseis', 'nice', 'invention', 'coming', 'love', 'admire', 'other', 'strength', 'character', 'Achilles', 'rightly', 'portrayed', 'noble', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'treatment', 'captive', 'Briseis', 'also', 'concern', 'cousin', 'men', 'also', 'egoistic', 'bit', 'pouty', 'prima', 'donna', 'Agamemnon', 'painted', 'political', 'power-craving', 'dynamic', 'two', 'nicely', 'done', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'moody', 'hero', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'just', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'actor', 'action', 'seriously', 'worked', 'out', 'role', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'naturally', 'impetuous', 'Paris', 'who', 'become', 'responsible', 'end', 'great', 'performances', 'visual', 'feast', 'good', 'solid', 'story', 'engaging', 'characters', 'memorable', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'work']",N/A

Let's just say that I'm highly disappointed in the changes that were made, for the sake of movie making. If LotR fans thought Peter Jackson beat up Tolkien, then Wolfang Petersen slaughtered Homer and left his body for the vultures.The Bean Factor: Kudos to Sean Bean for being the perfect Odysseus. Smart, cunning, sympathetic and one of the most human characters portrayed. Although his part was much smaller than I, among many, would have liked, he was brilliant.The Pitt Factor: I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, but I have to say this movie has certainly changed my mind. Not only did he look incredible, but his performance was quite good. I honestly didn't think he was quite that capable.The Bloom Factor: There's been a lot of Orlando bashing since this movie came out, and again, I've never been a huge fan of his, but I honestly think he was perfect for the role. If anyone had read the book, (which I doubt most of the pre-teen squeeling movie viewers I was *fortunate enough* to be viewing this with, had) they would know that Paris was weak and basically spineless. Bloom played the part well. I certainly had no sympathy for his character, just as I hadn't when reading The Iliad.The O'Toole, Cox and Gleeson Factor: Watching these three veterans was a joy. The played their parts to absolute perfection. I was mesmerized watching them on the screen. Masters, pure and simple.The Women of Troy: No stand-outs here. I thought Diane Kruger's performance as Helen was flat. Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Andromache was pretty good. Rose Byrne as Briseis was probably the best, as her part was a little meatier than the others.Last but not least, The Bana Factor: All I can say is WOW! Eric Bana was absolutely brilliant as Hector. He played the part perfectly. A soldier with a conscience, pride, loyalty, valor, honor, sympathy and even grace. The scenes between he and Peter O'Toole were magnificent, and made me want for more. There is no doubt in my mind that his was the stand-out performance of the movie.The cinematography and special effects were good. Not great, but good. I found the soundtrack to be very distracting. It was decent at times, but for the most part was overdone, almost as if they were using the music to carry portions of the movie, instead of supporting or enhancing it.I went to this movie to be entertained, and although I'm not sure if it was the overall audience distraction factor, or the fact that there was just so much I didn't like, that I found myself actually critiquing the movie instead of enjoying it. (I NEVER do that on a first viewing.)But, please, please, buy the film. The individual performances more than make up for the movies' (Petersen's) shortcomings. Based on that, on a scale of 1 to 5, I give the writers and director a 2, the acting a 5, for an overall 3 1/2.",3,Disappointing But Worth Watching,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2918,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'details', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Let', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'highly', 'disappointed', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'sake', 'movie', 'making', 'LotR', 'fans', 'thought', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'beat', 'up', 'Tolkien', 'then', 'Wolfang', 'Petersen', 'slaughtered', 'Homer', 'left', 'body', 'vultures.The', 'Bean', 'Factor', 'Kudos', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'being', 'perfect', 'Odysseus', 'Smart', 'cunning', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'most', 'human', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'part', 'was', 'much', 'smaller', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'was', 'brilliant.The', 'Pitt', 'Factor', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'certainly', 'changed', 'mind', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'look', 'incredible', 'performance', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'quite', 'capable.The', 'Bloom', 'Factor', 'been', 'lot', 'Orlando', 'bashing', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'anyone', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'doubt', 'most', 'pre-teen', 'squeeling', 'movie', 'viewers', 'was', '*fortunate', 'enough*', 'be', 'viewing', 'had', 'would', 'know', 'Paris', 'was', 'weak', 'basically', 'spineless', 'Bloom', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'certainly', 'had', 'sympathy', 'character', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'when', 'reading', 'Iliad.The', ""O'Toole"", 'Cox', 'Gleeson', 'Factor', 'Watching', 'three', 'veterans', 'was', 'joy', 'played', 'parts', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'watching', 'screen', 'Masters', 'pure', 'simple.The', 'Women', 'Troy', 'stand-outs', 'here', 'thought', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'performance', 'Helen', 'was', 'flat', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'portrayal', 'Andromache', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Briseis', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'little', 'meatier', 'others.Last', 'not', 'least', 'Bana', 'Factor', 'can', 'say', 'WOW', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Hector', 'played', 'part', 'perfectly', 'soldier', 'conscience', 'pride', 'loyalty', 'valor', 'honor', 'sympathy', 'even', 'grace', 'scenes', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'were', 'magnificent', 'made', 'want', 'more', 'doubt', 'mind', 'was', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'movie.The', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'Not', 'great', 'good', 'found', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'very', 'distracting', 'was', 'decent', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'overdone', 'almost', 'were', 'using', 'music', 'carry', 'portions', 'movie', 'instead', 'supporting', 'enhancing', 'it.I', 'went', 'movie', 'be', 'entertained', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'overall', 'audience', 'distraction', 'factor', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'found', 'actually', 'critiquing', 'movie', 'instead', 'enjoying', 'NEVER', 'do', 'first', 'viewing', 'please', 'please', 'buy', 'film', 'individual', 'performances', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'movies', 'Petersen', 'shortcomings', 'Based', 'scale', '1', '5', 'give', 'writers', 'director', '2', 'acting', '5', 'overall', '3', '1/2']",N/A

852483,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002Z0EXQ,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","I don't say &quot;Troy&quot; is a bad film; it has many virtues, like grand-scale actions and many handsome stars, who, whenever the chances are given, throw away his armors to show his torso. But as far as our emotional reaction go, &quot;Troy&quot; is as empty as that famous horse, or the smile of Helen, who is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world (who decides that anyway?)This story of &quot;Iliad&quot; has already been covered (partially) in Robert Wise film &quot;Helen of Troy.&quot; In a nutshell, Paris, Prince of Troy (Orland Bloom) steals the married lady Helen, and his stupid action opens another war between Troy and Greece. Don't say that it's impossible for that's what Homer says.So we see the siege of the Greek soldiers, who attack the city of Troy, where its leader Hector (Eric Bana) commands. But considerable time of this very long film (2h43m) is given to Achilles (Brad Pitt), who unwillingly obeys the Greek commander Agamemnon (Brain Cox) whose ruthless and villanious character makes a great contrast to other Greek soldiers such as Odysseus (Sean Bean).The script by David Benioff (novelist of &quot;25th Hour&quot;) remains surprisingly faithful to the original, considering the nature of the original (it's an epic). But if you look close, you notice there are so many elements barrowed from action genre, the last 30 minute in particular, about the famous Trojan Horse episode (which is not included in Homer's poem). The script lacks the emotional punch, or the portal for the audience to enter the inside of the characters -- in short, it's very superficial.The spectacular fight scenes are all great to watch, I admit, and you need a very close inspection to know what is really going on when the camera sweeps over the army on the coast of Troy. It is realistc, but at the same time very showy.About the actors. I hate to say this, but Pitt is totally miscast. We need someone who looks more natural when standing with a sword like a warrior. It's true that Pitt pumped up his muscles, but that doesn't mean that he cuts a convincing figure as a deadly soldier like Achilles. He is a demi-god, hardly the fit role for Pitt who is too human (I mean in a good sense, ok?).Eric Bana shows, perhaps, the better acting as Hector, whose role is not entirely an envious one. But he infuses a considerable amount of humanity to the character, making him a somewhat sympathetic man. After all, Bana is, I think, a better actor than Pitt. As to Bloom, all I can say is that his fans would be greatly disappointed by his slightly negative role (or weakness of personality).Finally this. Helen. French Diane Kruger is beautiful, but looks very insipid to me. Sorry, but the story requires her to be the beauty that would destroy one nation. However, her Helen does not look such seductiveness (where is Nicole Kidman, please), and the love between her and Paris is so feeble. You know, the director Petersen (&quot;Das Boot&quot; &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;) has never been famous for romance. but we need romance here, which is glaringly missing.",3,"Great to Look at, But Fatally Lacks the Emotional Punch",1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,3094,"['do', ""n't"", 'say', 'quot', 'Troy', 'quot', 'bad', 'film', 'many', 'virtues', 'grand-scale', 'actions', 'many', 'handsome', 'stars', 'who', 'whenever', 'chances', 'are', 'given', 'throw', 'away', 'armors', 'show', 'torso', 'as', 'far', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'go', 'quot', 'Troy', 'quot', 'as', 'empty', 'famous', 'horse', 'smile', 'Helen', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'who', 'anyway', 'story', 'quot', 'Iliad', 'quot', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'partially', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'film', 'quot', 'Helen', 'Troy.', 'quot', 'nutshell', 'Paris', 'Prince', 'Troy', 'Orland', 'Bloom', 'married', 'lady', 'Helen', 'stupid', 'action', 'war', 'Troy', 'Greece', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'impossible', 'what', 'Homer', 'says.So', 'see', 'siege', 'Greek', 'soldiers', 'who', 'attack', 'city', 'Troy', 'where', 'leader', 'Hector', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'considerable', 'time', 'very', 'long', 'film', '2h43m', 'given', 'Achilles', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'unwillingly', 'obeys', 'Greek', 'commander', 'Agamemnon', 'Brain', 'Cox', 'ruthless', 'villanious', 'character', 'great', 'contrast', 'other', 'Greek', 'soldiers', 'such', 'Odysseus', 'Sean', 'Bean', '.The', 'script', 'David', 'Benioff', 'novelist', 'quot', '25th', 'Hour', 'quot', 'surprisingly', 'faithful', 'original', 'considering', 'nature', 'original', 'epic', 'look', 'close', 'notice', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'barrowed', 'action', 'genre', 'last', '30', 'minute', 'particular', 'famous', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'episode', 'not', 'included', 'Homer', 'poem', 'script', 'emotional', 'punch', 'portal', 'audience', 'enter', 'inside', 'characters', 'short', 'very', 'superficial.The', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'admit', 'need', 'very', 'close', 'inspection', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'when', 'camera', 'army', 'coast', 'Troy', 'realistc', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'showy.About', 'actors', 'hate', 'say', 'Pitt', 'totally', 'miscast', 'need', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'natural', 'when', 'standing', 'sword', 'warrior', 'true', 'Pitt', 'pumped', 'up', 'muscles', ""n't"", 'mean', 'convincing', 'figure', 'deadly', 'soldier', 'Achilles', 'demi-god', 'hardly', 'fit', 'role', 'Pitt', 'who', 'too', 'human', 'mean', 'good', 'sense', 'ok', '.Eric', 'Bana', 'perhaps', 'better', 'acting', 'Hector', 'role', 'not', 'entirely', 'envious', 'one', 'considerable', 'amount', 'humanity', 'character', 'making', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'Bana', 'think', 'better', 'actor', 'Pitt', 'Bloom', 'can', 'say', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'slightly', 'negative', 'role', 'weakness', 'personality', '.Finally', 'Helen', 'French', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'beautiful', 'very', 'insipid', 'Sorry', 'story', 'be', 'beauty', 'would', 'destroy', 'one', 'nation', 'However', 'Helen', 'not', 'look', 'such', 'seductiveness', 'where', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'please', 'love', 'Paris', 'so', 'feeble', 'know', 'director', 'Petersen', 'quot', 'Das', 'Boot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Line', 'Fire', 'quot', 'never', 'been', 'famous', 'romance', 'need', 'romance', 'here', 'glaringly', 'missing']",N/A
852484,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B0002Z0EXQ,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[2, 3]","""Troy"" is in many ways an infuriating film, because it seemed like a sure thing.  Everyone knew that a major film had to be made about the battle for Troy, arguably the most famous one in the history of western civilization (at least in terms of its fame longevity).  A talented cast and proven director was assembled, it was given a $160,000,000 budget, and the prerelease hype was huge.  Of course, the film was roasted when it was finally released, and its final gross (at least domestically) was very disappointing.  Now that the hype has died down, I can say that ""Troy"" is not a bad movie, but just a disappointing one.The movie is awash in moral ambiguity.  That might work for Vietnam War films, but it is missplaced here.  We desparately want a hero to root for, but Achilles does not fit that mold.  For most of the film, he's cold, unsympathetic, and even borderline cruel.  Brad Pitt's performance does not help- it is adequate at its best moments, and terrible at its worst.  Where's Tyler Durden when you need him?As it turns out, the best and most sympathetic performances are given from the Trojan side, in the forms of Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole.  Bana's Hector seems to be the hero that the audience can root for, and Bana himself is terrific in the role.  This makes the film a real downer, however.  Hector's inevitable fate makes him disappear three quarters of the way through, and without him the film's ending is weak, as we've run out of people to root for.  O'Toole is also touching as the Trojan king, but he is not given enough screen time.Ultimately, the audience sympathizes with Troy, which makes its inevitable end that much more disappointing.  The Greeks are led by an arrogant and greedy king, played by Brian Cox with over-the-top menace (I know this guy is good at being a villain, but he should seriously consider being in a romantic comedy or something.  STRETCH a little, man!).  By the end of ""Troy"", we are rooting against the Greeks, and their inevitable victory renders the ending flat.  Imagine if Sauron had triumphed at the end of ""Return of the King"", and you'll have an idea how much of a downer ""Troy"" ends up being.  I suppose we're supposed to root for Achilles at the end because he has a sudden change of heart, but it's too little too late, and Pitt does not make the change in Achilles convincing.If you haven't realized by now, I liked ""Troy"" all the way up to its ending (although its running time should have been 20 minutes shorter).  The disappearance of Bana and O'Toole from the movie's final moments render them flat, and the failure of the movie to deliver a rousing climax is ultimately its undoing.  Many of the battle scenes in here are spectacular and some of the performances (at least on the Trojan side) are effective, but in the end I'm afraid that ""Troy"" is better for a rental than a purchase.",3,"""Troy"" entertains, but there's something missing",1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,2869,"['Troy', 'many', 'ways', 'infuriating', 'film', 'seemed', 'sure', 'thing', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'major', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'battle', 'Troy', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'one', 'history', 'western', 'civilization', 'least', 'terms', 'fame', 'longevity', 'talented', 'cast', 'proven', 'director', 'was', 'assembled', 'was', 'given', '160,000,000', 'budget', 'prerelease', 'hype', 'was', 'huge', 'course', 'film', 'was', 'roasted', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'final', 'gross', 'least', 'domestically', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Now', 'hype', 'died', 'can', 'say', 'Troy', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'disappointing', 'one.The', 'movie', 'awash', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'might', 'work', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'films', 'missplaced', 'here', 'desparately', 'want', 'hero', 'root', 'Achilles', 'not', 'fit', 'mold', 'most', 'film', 'cold', 'unsympathetic', 'even', 'borderline', 'cruel', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'not', 'help-', 'adequate', 'best', 'moments', 'terrible', 'worst', 'Where', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'when', 'need', 'out', 'best', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Trojan', 'side', 'forms', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Bana', 'Hector', 'be', 'hero', 'audience', 'can', 'root', 'Bana', 'terrific', 'role', 'film', 'real', 'downer', 'however', 'Hector', 'inevitable', 'fate', 'disappear', 'three', 'quarters', 'way', 'film', 'ending', 'weak', ""'ve"", 'run', 'people', 'root', ""O'Toole"", 'also', 'touching', 'Trojan', 'king', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time.Ultimately', 'audience', 'Troy', 'inevitable', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'disappointing', 'Greeks', 'are', 'led', 'arrogant', 'greedy', 'king', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'over-the-top', 'menace', 'know', 'guy', 'good', 'being', 'villain', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'being', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'STRETCH', 'little', 'man', 'end', 'Troy', 'are', 'rooting', 'Greeks', 'inevitable', 'victory', 'renders', 'ending', 'flat', 'Imagine', 'Sauron', 'had', 'triumphed', 'end', 'Return', 'King', ""'ll"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'downer', 'Troy', 'up', 'being', 'suppose', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'root', 'Achilles', 'end', 'sudden', 'change', 'heart', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Pitt', 'not', 'make', 'change', 'Achilles', 'convincing.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'realized', 'now', 'liked', 'Troy', 'way', 'up', 'ending', 'running', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', '20', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'disappearance', 'Bana', ""O'Toole"", 'movie', 'final', 'moments', 'render', 'flat', 'failure', 'movie', 'deliver', 'rousing', 'climax', 'ultimately', 'undoing', 'Many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'least', 'Trojan', 'side', 'are', 'effective', 'end', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Troy', 'better', 'rental', 'purchase']",N/A
852485,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0002Z0EXQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","Putting aside all the mythological characters and even many of the historical facts, TROY is an epic film that attempts to display the Trojan War in less than three hours. Seeing that the Trojan War lasted around a decade, it's almost an insane feat. However, for the most part, the movie works. There's a lot of fierce fighting and the political underpinings around the war are examined. This was a film that probably did have a cast of thousands and the 1000 ships sailing from Greece to Troy along with the conflicts that follow are spectacular.However, the movie could have been much better. The basic story about the Trojan War has been altered. That in itself isn't that big of a deal, but most of the things that have been changed weren't changed to make the movie flow smoother or even to make the movie more interesting. Instead, they've were changed to accommodate star Brad Pitt and give him more screen time. Normally, that wouldn't bother me much, but Pitt has been horribly miscast as Achilles. By changing the story to give him more screen time, the filmmakers have made the film less interesting and appealing.Another one of the big stars of the movie is Orlando Bloom. Bloom portrays the love struck Paris--you know, the guy who steals Helen away from her husband in Greece and takes her to Troy. Though Bloom looks and fits into his role better than Pitt, Bloom too, is miscast. Paris might have been somewhat of a whiner and even a bit of a wimp compared to his brother Hector, but he probably wasn't the pretty boy that he's made to be in the film (and if I'm not mistaken, according to the ""real"" story Paris doesn't survive the invasion of the city either).The real star of this movie and an actor who continues to be overlooked and underrated is Eric Bana. Bana is dead on as Hector, Troy's great warrior and the one man who could have bested Achilles had he not been so invinsible.  Bana's portrayal is perfect and would have been even had the movie been better casted.Overall TROY is a somewhat enjoyable film that attempts to recapture the spirit of the grand epic movie rather than tell a historically accurate description of the Trojan War. There's a little romance, some decent sword and sandal combat scenes, and a lot of pretty faces.

First off, to see how they would do a well-known historical film and secondly to see how Brad Pitt would carry the lead as the greatest warrior ever in Achilles. Troy is comparable in nature to Gladiator the 2000 Russell Crowe blockbuster. Unfortunately for Troy Gladiator is a much better movie in terms of story, action, and acting. Troy has some great action but the story and the acting is a disaster. Watching this movie you really get to see what a lightweight actor Pitt is after all. The rest of the cast isn't much better. In particular Pitt's slave love interest is atrocious! This woman isn't attractive nor is her character interesting or even necessary. I found myself hoping she would get killed in the very next scene she was in just to keep from hearing her annoying whining voice again. The story is basically a Trojan prince steals a Greek king's wife, Helen. This brings war. The Greeks invade Troy by sea. One spectacular fight scene has Pitt land on the beach and kill hundreds of Trojans on his way to a temple. Some of the action is great but unfortunately there isn't enough of it. Also, there aren't any real heroes in this movie. WHat made Gladiator so successful is that we the viewer had a genuine hero to root for in Crowe's noble general/gladiator Maximus. THis move has no clear cut hero. Pitt's Achilles comes off as some kind of moody playboy warrior. We never really know why he goes to war. He seems to have the choice not to as he kicks back on the beach with his mom and bro. He moodily decides to invade Troy despite Mom's warnings. The Trojan horse scene is the climax and it is pretty good but keep in mind this is after more than 2 hours! The movie is unnecessarily long and drawn out. Pitt and his soldiers come out of the horse and pillage Troy. Unfortunately for Brad he gets an arrow in the Achilles. But before he goes he says goodbye to his annoying horrible love interest(whose name I didn't even catch, not that I tried). The scene is not touching in the least its just tiring like all the scenes Pitt and this woman are in together. Pitt tells his lady ""you gave me peace in a lifetime of war!"". HUH? She did nothing but argue and insult him and for some reason he loves her?!?!!? Never mind! This movie should've stuck to the action and the fight scenes instead of this insipidness. Pitt's entire love interest was a tacked-on disaster which slowed everything down. The characters are mostly selfish cowardly annoying jerks.

Most of the other special features have been ported over from the previous edition.First the most important question is whether or not this double dip is worth it? Absolutely because the additional footage only enhances the film giving it additional depth. The transfer is striking (regardless of which format)as well. In many respects this isn't a double dip because we get a film that is superior to the original version.Unlike ""The Illiad"" Wolfgang Petersen's film ""Troy"" seemed too short and for good reason; Petersen had to trim the film down to a shorter length for its theatrical release. Luckily Warner gave Petersen the opportunity to revisit this epic film and add more meat to the bones of a film that had the look of an epic but was missing much of the emotional depth.Petersen restores roughly 32 minutes to the film giving additional depth to the various relationships in the film. While ""Troy"" isn't a perfect epic, it's much improved. James Horner's score is still occasionally obtrusive but the overall impact of Petersen's film with its marvelous performances from Brian Cox (who steals almost every scene he's in), the quiet power of Eric Bana and even the gravity of Pitt as Achilles is far more effective than the previous version.Image quality is superb for both the DVD and Blu Ray verisons of the film (the Blu Ray, of course, gets the nod because the images are much sharper, crisper with better definition but the DVD isn't too shabby either). Audio for the Blu Ray is presented lossless while the DVD's audio sounds terrific given the limitations of the format. Colors are a bit bolder here than on the previous version to my eyes.It appears that a lot of the special features from the previous edition have been ported over and the only new things are the introduction by Petersen as well as a retrospective 23 minute interview where Petersen discusses the genesis of the original film and this project.This film version much more closely resembles what he had in mind when he took on the project.

And, true enough, there are some stunning visuals in it. It's for the visual imagery and quality fight scenes that I give this three stars. But I couldn't get beyond the poor writing and the complete disregard for the source material. I know that film adaptions should have their own life. This film didn't need to be the Iliad on the screen. But on the other hand it's frustrating when they take a great story, great drama, classic characters and plot... And then make something so flat and lame. If you really don't know the Iliad you'll probably be a lot happier with this. But I remember it quite well, and I just watched this in awe at all the changes they made and how poorly it effected the finished product.I keep wanting to see more ancient epics on the screen. I'd love to see GATES OF FIRE or PRIDE OF CARTHAGE in big, fabulous versions, maybe brought to life on the scale of RETURN OF THE KING. But Hollywood seems incapable of making really good historical epics. I guess they cost so much money that they have to make decisions geared at profit instead of quality. But that hasn't work for films like ALEXANDER and KING ARTHUR and TROY. TROY might have made a profit worldwide, but it wasn't exactly the blockbuster the studio wanted. That's clear.And how about having an actual Greek actor in a Greek-themed movie once in a while? I for one would love to watch a movie where the actors looked authentic to the ethnicity they're trying to portray. It's an unfortunate aspect of our race-biased world that we cast Brad Pitt as Achilles, Russell Crowe as the Gladiator, Colin Farrell as Alexander. It's shameless. Wouldn't it be great to discover some unknown Greek actor who could really inhabit these characters? And when did we decide that Greeks and Romans generally spoke with a British accent? There are so many Brits in this film that it must have kept most of the Britain's male character actors in work.It's unfortunate that Hollywood can't let the past live as the past and make something really interesting. Nobody else can do it, really. There are some Japanese, Chinese and Korean epics that have been wonderful, but these filmakers are usually working on their own material/history. That's too bad. How about somebody gets Ang Lee to direct Hannibal's story? That might be something, but I won't hold my breath.

Played by Brad Pitt, Achilles leads the men from the field, even though he is torn about whether thousands of men should die in order to return one woman to a man she left.  Filmed on the picturesque blazing beaches of Malta, ""Troy"" is full of action, love and a few too many shots of half-naked Pitt.Not as aesthetically ambitious as other historical epics like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, Troy is more concerned with telling a good story in the populist sense. It is not a film for teachers of English or History to use as an example of what is known about the Trojan War; those familiar with Homer's source material may be somewhat disappointed with the liberties taken (even though Homer took some himself). The film is essentially an inaccurate re-telling of a story we know is already full of inaccuracies.But holding up this film to the original work of Homer misses the point entirely. The filmmakers knew an accurate depiction would be impossible to make and even more impossible to sell. They borrow the spirit from The Iliad and transform it into a modern action film.

This film tries to show the Trojan War in a mere 2 and a half hours, and it does an admirable job with the task, so kudos to Wolfgang Peterson for fulfilling such a daunting task. This movie stars all the needed hunks(for the women, sigh), such as Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom, who are at sometimes almost nude, but you never see anything contrary to what the media is saying. For the men, you get a Straight-up action movie with a great plot and believeable characters, putting you headfirst into the Trojan War. You really do get quite immersed in this movie, and you'll find yourself surprised at how quickly it's over, really wanting more! Troy starts off with Paris(Orlando Bloom) and Helen sailing away in a sailboat, angering Menalaus(Helen's Husband), and giving King Agnemonom the push he needs to go to war with Troy. Enter Achilles, the worlds greatest and seemingly invincible fighter, capable of defeating even the harshest of foes. Achilles fights for the Greeks, yet he doesn't obey the rule of King Agnemonom, because he believes him to be a greedy fool. Eventually, the Greeks invade Troy, bringing Achilles with them, and Troy must fight for their homeland. The most memorable scene in the entire movie comes from the epic battle of Hector(Eric Bana, Prince of Troy) and Achilles(Brad Pitt), and their fight sets the stage for the last effort from the Greeks, the using of the Trojan Horse. I won't tell you what happens, because if you haven't read the Illiad some parts of the movie come of as genuinely surprising, yet the mediocre love stories are easily predictable. Overall,great fun for adults, might not want to bring the kids because of the violence, but good to bring a date or wife to. My only problems with the movie was the terrible score, which at times made me cover my ears it was so bad, and the childishly put together Cinematography, which was so bad it was hard to tell if what was happening!

Plain and simple, Brad Pitt tried too hard, Orlando Bloom played the sleaze right to the tee, and still had me plugging my nose during parts of this. I thought that the best performance belonged to Brendan Gleeson, especially during his fight scene with Bloom, where he took me back to the days of Hamish in ""Braveheart""! Brian Cox showed excellence like he always does. In my opinion, he doesn't do poorly.Now I know that this is based on Homer, possibly the pride of the Greeks, the great story of Achilles and the Trojan horse, who knows what else. But I wasn't impressed. Some of it actually seemed phony. I loved the line where the dude's carving the horse (this is near the end, for those of you who are asking questions) and says, ""Makin' this for my boy."" HMM, wonder what's gonna happen after that? See, I really don't think they had jock straps back then, but they do now.

852500,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0002Z0EXQ,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[61, 66]","When I saw TROY in the theaters, I wasn't expecting much. After that first viewing, I knew there was something missing; the screenplay just didn't grab me, it failed to immerse me on the scenes. I am quite familiar with GREEK myths, also both Norse and Roman mythology. Well, I managed to purchase the director's cut of Troy, and although it is not as great as KINGDOM of HEAVEN Director's cut, it is a better cut of the film.I presume that most of the folks who'll be interested in the director's cut are fans or at least the ones who saw it in theaters as I did. ONE OBVIOUS improvement this version has over the previous dvd is the PICTURE transfer. The Video this time out is more vibrant, sharper and cleaner. Another difference is the SOUNDTRACK on certain scenes; the training scene of Achilles and his cousin, the duel between Hector and Achilles. Also, the music is improved with added bass during the siege at the beach and on the gates of Troy. The music sounded more powerful.The Director's cut has the same plotlines, characters and scenes. It does have added ""meat"" and do they make Troy a better cut of the film? Yes.1: Opening scene with a dog going around the spoils of war. (Dead bodies)2: Nudity in the scene between Paris and Helen. Their relationship is also a bit more fleshed out. Love scenes are extended, suffice it to say, the film is a bit more uninhibited when it comes to nudity.3: Helen's husband is shown as unfaithful. It gives more motivation to Helen's actions.4: Odysseus is developed as the humble King of Ithaca. He likes to be among the common folk.  His character is also more fleshed out; the film also emphasizes how it is Achilles trusts his judgment.5: Hector knew about Paris' affair with Helen even before they boarded the ship back to Troy. He warns him of the potential consequences.6: Achilles' ego is more fleshed out.  He has a confrontation with Agamemnon regarding the Priestess of Apollo. (Extended)7: Extended battle sequences. More blood is shown. Heads get lopped off more often.8: Funeral sequences are extended. It shows more emotion and emphasizes the combatants' sorrow with the lost of their comrades.9: A dog licks off the ""fake"" disease after the Trojans took the wooden horse inside their city.10: Agamemnon's obsession and arrogance is more fleshed out.11: Extended final act sequence; last assault on the city of Troy. More blood and gore is shown. A tad more brutally graphic.There may be more that I missed, it did contain an added 30+ minutes of footage. The film is contained in 2 discs (2 Dual layer DVDs) similar to the terrific extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven Director's cut.VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.35 Anamorphic widescreen. Exceptional transfer, an improvement over the previous dvd release; Near-flawless picture quality, nice colors, improved sharpness and contrast. Black levels are solid. 5.1 Dolby Digital English is very powerful. I'd had hoped that this cut would include DTS sound mix, it would have been better with DTS.In closing: Is the director's cut worth a ""double dip""? For me, for $ 14.99 2-disc edition director's cut, definitely yes! As for the other more ""stylish"" Ultimate Edition (includes photo book etc.)with the $ 25.99-$ 34.99 price tag, I'm not so sure. For fans of the film, or if you don't have the original release, this is a no-brainer. The lack of DTS track is a minus, but this new edition definitely has a bit more ""grandeur"" than the theatrical release.However, if you hated the original cut, this new director's cut will NOT change your mind!Recommended!

852501,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0002Z0EXQ,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic film ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is an ultra-realistic and serious portrayal of the Trojan war.More than that, ""Troy"" is without a doubt the BEST sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Viking Queen,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Attila,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc. -- ""Troy"" is BETTER. Okay, maybe I'm getting a bit carried away here because I just viewed ""Troy"" and it blew me away, but ""Troy"" is at least AS GOOD as some of the better flicks just mentioned, like ""Ben-Hur,"" and far edges out ""Spartacus"" and ""Samson and Delilah."" As for more recent sword & sandal epics like the overrated ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator,"" ""Troy"" utterly blows 'em out of the water -- no lie!Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""Troy"" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film -- He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""Ulysses,"" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in ""Troy."" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the ACTUAL Trojan war that Homer's myth is based on (and even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I'm not a major Brad Pitt fan -- I neither love him or hate him -- but I think he does an outstanding and believable job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from ""Hulk"") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest man-to-man sword & sandal fight ever filmed -- really!What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful showdown, my wife and I couldn't decide who to root for. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong here, Agamemnon could probably be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks or the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out,... and it never ends,  as Achilles states. An additional point of the film is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionables: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. Not that I think she's some ultra-ravishing beauty (although she does have a supremely impressive rear-end shot), but she's certainly not plain looking; and, besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder -- if Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.I should point out that ""Troy"" is one of the most expensive pictures ever made, close to 200 million dollars, and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, ""Troy"" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding, not fake-looking like the Rome and Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator.""Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout the flick, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""Everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" So don't worry, there's thankfully not one 'humorous,' goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack for ""The Passion of the Christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/appropriate/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.INTERESTING NOTE: Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon while making the film. Fitting, no?FINAL WORD: If you're into sword & sandal epics, ""Troy"" will BLOW YOU AWAY. The story captivates you right from the very beginning and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour running time. Beyond this ""Troy"" extravagantly visualizes the Trojan war for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.Keep in mind that those who give ""Troy"" a poor rating are the same losers who think ""Jackass -- the Movie"" is a great film.",5,"""Where does it end?"" -- ""It never ends.""",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,5360,"['Homer', 'mythical', 'epic',
