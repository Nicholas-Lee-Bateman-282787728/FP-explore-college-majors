He later finds out she is actually a witch, sought after by a murderous coven. She appears to have ""Samanthitis"" - that is, a witch falling in love with a ""muggle"", as it were (see Bewitched). They appear on several occasions attempting to reintegrate her into the cult. Among them, is a ""Mrs. White"", a kindly grandmother who harasses and frames him.He eventually seeks the aid of a survivalist with the likely name of ""Brock"", who operates a veritable compound, but is no match for the power of the cadre of cultists. Seems he received the brain blender treatment. Despite all of their desperate attempts (including her Magic), they cannot fully fend off the evildoers who consistently prove to be far too clever and potent at every turn.He begins hallucinating as they appear to him; in one remarkable scene, a Warlock levitates his little Porsche, bursting out the windows. He finally visits the stately mansion where they congregate, and is attacked by a Martial Artist cultist; also displayed therein, an impressive ritual chamber decorated with a Sabbatic Baphomet on a wall, and a pentagram upon the floor. As he flees therefrom, he finds his little car torched.Finally, in search for his dream girl, he arrives at a beach during a ceremony where he is lured to be the night""s ""sacrifice"" (who had to come forth willingly}. A discernible The Devils Rain influence is detected here. Thus confined, the final scene contains some very interesting and rather impressively unexpected twists,  surprisingly without the demoralization process typical of these presentations. The cult prevails herein, and the chain of events continue...The film has a rather ""made for TV"" vibe at times, but can be quite engaging nevertheless, really picking up when the resident Witches and Warlocks begin their nefarious influence upon his mind. The movie does have some cult value overall, and holds the drama well.",4,"""You don't know what you're getting into, friend...""",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2242,"['Disclaimer', 'First', 'all', 'important', 'mention', 'types', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'represent', 'actual', 'Satanic', 'philosophy', 'practices', 'are', 'appreciated', 'entertainment', 'value.A', 'lawyer', 'enamored', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'named', 'Miranda', 'who', 'glamor', 'Greater', 'Magic', 'well', 'rescuing', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'later', 'out', 'actually', 'witch', 'sought', 'murderous', 'coven', 'have', 'Samanthitis', 'witch', 'falling', 'love', 'muggle', 'were', 'see', 'Bewitched', 'appear', 'several', 'occasions', 'attempting', 'reintegrate', 'cult', 'Mrs.', 'White', 'kindly', 'grandmother', 'who', 'frames', 'him.He', 'eventually', 'aid', 'survivalist', 'likely', 'name', 'Brock', 'who', 'veritable', 'compound', 'match', 'power', 'cadre', 'cultists', 'received', 'brain', 'blender', 'treatment', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'including', 'Magic', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'fend', 'off', 'evildoers', 'who', 'consistently', 'prove', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'clever', 'potent', 'turn.He', 'hallucinating', 'appear', 'one', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'Warlock', 'little', 'Porsche', 'bursting', 'out', 'windows', 'finally', 'stately', 'mansion', 'where', 'congregate', 'attacked', 'Martial', 'Artist', 'cultist', 'also', 'displayed', 'therein', 'impressive', 'ritual', 'chamber', 'decorated', 'Sabbatic', 'Baphomet', 'wall', 'pentagram', 'floor', 'therefrom', 'little', 'car', 'torched.Finally', 'search', 'dream', 'girl', 'beach', 'ceremony', 'where', 'lured', 'be', 'night', 's', 'sacrifice', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'forth', 'willingly', 'discernible', 'Devils', 'Rain', 'influence', 'detected', 'here', 'Thus', 'confined', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'interesting', 'rather', 'impressively', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'surprisingly', 'demoralization', 'process', 'typical', 'presentations', 'cult', 'herein', 'chain', 'events', 'continue', 'film', 'rather', 'made', 'TV', 'vibe', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'engaging', 'nevertheless', 'really', 'picking', 'up', 'when', 'resident', 'Witches', 'Warlocks', 'begin', 'nefarious', 'influence', 'mind', 'movie', 'have', 'cult', 'value', 'overall', 'drama', 'well']",N/A

249003,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301300521,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 3]","""Spellbinder"" is a suspenseful, clever and entertaining suspense-thriller of a movie that delves into the dark and malignant world of satanism.  Timothy Daly stars as Jeff Mills, an attorney, who falls for a danzel in distress or is she something else?  ""Spellbinder"" does a good job of keeping the viewer on the edge of his/her seat and interested in the movie's storyline from beginning to the very end.  As a horror movie, ""Spellbinder"" really does not fit very well into this particular genre although there are some elements of horror in the movie.  From a strictly horror movie fan's point of view, ""Spellbinder"" leaves a lot to be desired as actual scares are few and far between in this movie, although scene on the beach towards the end of the movie is certainly horrifying and shocking to the viewer.  All things considered, this movie is an interesting and rather flambouyant look at the occult/satanism.  If you are looking for a clever and entertaining little suspense/thriller with a powerful ending, you should definitely check ""Spellbinder"" out, but if you are looking for a pure horror movie, keep looking my friend.

249007,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,6301300521,LadyLestat,"[2, 3]","First of all, I was born it the early eighties, so I watched this movie for the first time at eight year of age. The 2nd time I saw this movie was in the early nineties, and I still liked it just as much as the first time I saw it. I do think this movie was ahead of it's time seeing as how there have been plenty like it. Tim Daly, known best for playing Joe Hackett on ""Wings"" plays a noble Attorney who admirably intervines and stops a woman from being beaten by her boyfriend. Kelly Preston plays Miranda, the woman in distress with one hell of a secret. Miranda is a Witch! and she's on the run from her Coven who wants her back. Frankly, this movie gets a little over the top at that point. Come to think of it, he met this chick in the street, took her home, fell in love with her in all of 5 minutes, and then he finds out she's being chased by a Satanic Cult. Realistically, a man in real life would say the hell with her, and let her go before he would do battle with the forces of evil. However, that's not the way it goes in the movies as we all know. I could tell from the very beginning there was a little something off about this chick, and I wish things would've turned out differently, but it is what it is. At any rate, Miranda is finally captured by these people, and of course Jeff being who he is again, has to go and save her not realizing the trap she's set for him. I hate to spoil the ending, but I don't think there's that many people who haven't seen it since it's release in 1988. Anyway, the truth of the matter is, she hasn't quit the cult, but they do need a human sacrifice to come of his own free will. I felt sorry for him because he was a lamb led to a slaughter by a beautiful woman, and not only that, his friend is involved in setting him up to be sacrificed too. They all knew he would be an easy sacrificial lamb because he did indeed love Miranda.

O'Blenis,"[22, 24]","Not just one of the sexiest horror movies ever but one of the sexiest Movies ever, period, and also among the scariest movies out there; why this remains unavailable on DVD is confounding (the site here has the same product listed as both a DVD and a VHS, but I believe the DVD part is a typo; I don't think they had DVD even on the drawing board in 1992 and ""Spellbinder"" doesn't show up on DVD searches).Springing from a simple premise - while playing basketball one night Jeff (Timothy Daly) and a friend witness a beautiful young woman (Miranda, as played by Kelly Preston in one of her best roles) being attacked by a thug and come to her rescue.  From this a romance develops between Jeff and the magical Miranda, which in turn leads to some of the hottest footage ever put on film.  What elevates it (in addition to Preston's mind-blowing beauty) is how passionate and into one another the lovers seem to be; the stone-faced, mechanical love scenes in some lesser movies are ineffective (the characters seem to be thinking, 'ah, we got a half hour to kill.  Why not?  Whatever.') but here both the action and the affection are scorching.The new idyllic life doesn't stay idyllic for long though, as the identity of the man earlier assaulting Miranda and his reasons come into the light.  Miranda is on the run from a cult she became mixed up in that now wants her back as they've chosen her as a human sacrifice.  If memory serves me correctly there were allusions to Wicca, although the cult is clearly not Wiccan but Diabolical in nature; the 'Wicca' angle may have been a hook they used to lure in unsuspecting recruits who would have wanted nothing to do with Satanism.The less rational the scares become the more effective they are, as it leads to the conclusion that the cult not only worships the devil but is powered by him, or else makes the viewer question the perceptions of reality.  One of the twists to the movie in the latter half I would have prefered to do without, but others may disagree.  It certainly packed a punch.
