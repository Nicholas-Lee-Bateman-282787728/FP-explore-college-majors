A good script with great actors and lush music makes us remember why we love the movies.  A film from today that could hold it owne on TCM.

1097580,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,B000UYN9OU,Donegal Dan,"[20, 22]","The plot of this movie is a simple and familiar one: young aspiring and naive actress struggles to make it in the bigtime theatrical world, meets young, aspiring playwright and young, successful director, both of whom fall for her and complicate her  life and theirs.  There are a spate of lesser characters floating around--snobby socialites, former divas, etc. played by several ""name"" actors who either overact (Angelica Houston) or sleepwalk through their parts (Lauren Bacall).  The exception to that rule is Terrence Stamp, who plays a butler/chauffeur/fixer and who, as far as I'm concerned, stole the show with his low-key, sardonic portrayal of probably the most intelligent and interesting character of the lot.  The build-up to World War II provides a rather attenuated background to the love triangle and machinations that form the main storyline.  I cannot say that this saga was all that riveting--a good Catherine Cookson drama would be preferable, more involving, and considerably more substantive.",3,Pre-WWII Potboiler,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1014,"['plot', 'movie', 'simple', 'familiar', 'one', 'young', 'aspiring', 'naive', 'actress', 'make', 'bigtime', 'theatrical', 'world', 'meets', 'young', 'aspiring', 'playwright', 'young', 'successful', 'director', 'whom', 'fall', 'complicate', 'life', 'are', 'spate', 'lesser', 'characters', 'floating', 'around', 'snobby', 'socialites', 'former', 'divas', 'etc', 'played', 'several', 'name', 'actors', 'who', 'overact', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'sleepwalk', 'parts', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'exception', 'rule', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'butler/chauffeur/fixer', 'who', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'stole', 'show', 'low-key', 'sardonic', 'portrayal', 'probably', 'most', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'character', 'lot', 'build-up', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'rather', 'attenuated', 'background', 'love', 'triangle', 'machinations', 'form', 'main', 'storyline', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'saga', 'was', 'riveting', 'good', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'drama', 'would', 'be', 'preferable', 'more', 'involving', 'considerably', 'more', 'substantive']",N/A
