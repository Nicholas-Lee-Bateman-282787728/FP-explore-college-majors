495771,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00000DFQZ,Bobby Underwood,"[14, 14]","This fun and snappy little mystery from director Tay Garnett is every film buff's dream come true. It has a great cast, a good script, and best of all, hardly anyone knows about it! Ken Englund's smart sceenplay, based on the novel ""Send Another Coffin"" by F.G. Presnell, is full of witty one-liners in this breezy surprise every classic movie fan will want to own.Pat O'Brien is attorney Johnny Webb and Broderick Crawford is his tough but easygoing assistant, Russ Sampson. Webb is trying to earn a huge fee for cleaning up the highway contract corruption which has led to murder. Edward Arnold is Vincent Cushing, the political boss he'll have to take down who also happens to be involved with Alma (Claire Dodd), Webb's ex-girlfriend.When she gets knocked off on a windy night, both Webb and Cushing are the main suspects. Webb has become involved with the sweet but ditzy young Anne (Ruth Terry), and spends as much time trying not to take advantage of her as he does finding out who killed Alma. Neither is easy and both have some interesting and comical twists and turns.Eve Arden is a ton of fun as Webb's sarcastic secretary Miss Ater, and B-movie favorite Phyllis Brooks has a fantastic turn as Sarilla Cushing, the gorgeous daughter of Vincent. She just happens to be Webb's alibi when a second murder occurs using the same weapon, which keeps turning up in Webb's office!There is a surprising and spirited conclusion to the mystery and an equally satisfying one to the love angle, as the delightful Anne finally gets to stick around as Johnny's permanent girl. O'Brien and the rest of the cast are terrific in this delightful little gem that may just be the most entertaining mystery you've never heard of.Finding films like this one is what classic movie fans live for. This is one that doesn't let you down. Keep in mind it's one of those public domain films so the print is decent if not excellent, but certainly one you need to see.

495772,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00000DFQZ,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","Pat O'Brien, to my way of thinking, was always an interesting actor. He was one of that breed of Thirties men who almost blasted self-confidence. He was fast-talking, always ready with a quick comeback and a one-two punch. He was hard to deflate. Think of others such as Chester Morris, Lee Tracy and Lloyd Nolan. O'Brien played up the Irish charm like a poster. Unlike those others, O'Brien made it to the big time in the Thirties. He was great friends with James Cagney and starred with Cagney in nine films. But with opportunities to be a leading man, O'Brien just sucked the air away from anyone else in the room. He was dynamic to a fault, in my view. When he tried to do comedy line reading, he usually came across as emphatic and irritable. When he was playing tough, he could come across as emphatic and unmovable.With Slightly Honorable, a 1940 film directed by Tay Garnett, O'Brien plays John Webb, a strong-willed, fast-talking lawyer who is determined to bring down Victor Cushing (Edward Arnold), the leader of a corrupt political machine, a man responsible for rigging highway construction bids and using shoddy materials. Even the district attorney is part of Cushing's operation. Webb's only helper is his law associate, Russ Sampson (Broderick Crawford). There is the attempted corruption of an 18-year-old singer, two murders by dagger and two attempted murders, and a tense political debate in the state capitol where we learn how much pressure it takes to crumble second-rate concrete. There's even a climactic scene at night in a foggy, isolated cemetery, with old tombstones being read by flashlight and a thrown dagger coming very close to permanently ending Webb's law practice.And this is a comedy...or, at least, an attempt at a comedy mystery. The background music is jaunty. The repartee is quick and sometimes witty (and sometimes awful: ""Well,"" says Webb, ""it looks like the good old frameroo.""); the 18-year-old lamb chop is cute, ditzy and dumb; there's a souse on a barroom floor and a black elevator attendant who roles his eyes and does shuffle steps. Eve Arden even shows up as Miss Ater, Webb's ironic secretary.The result teeters close to being a mess, but a fast-moving one. O'Brien, with his high-energy line delivery and no nonsense style, dominates the proceedings. Even Edward Arnold, smooth, avuncular and good-humored as Mr. Big, isn't able to steal any scenes from O'Brien. Ruth Terry as Ann Seymour, the young singer who wants to be John Webb's girl friend, is fine delivering a song and dance, but doing young and ditzy she sounds like a motor mouth Shirley Temple on amphetamines. She survives the plot and manages to win Webb, but after a while I started hoping she'd be one of the victims. Broderick Crawford does a fine job as Webb's partner, younger, not as sharp but ready to stand up and be counted.There are two problems with Slightly Honorable. The first is that as a leading man Pat O'Brien can get tiresome. The second is that Tay Garnett couldn't make up his mind whether he was directing a comedy or a crime drama. The movie is often fun to watch but it keeps veering from one style to the other. It's hard to believe that a few years later Garnett would direct one of the most satisfying, well-made and depressing crime noirs ever filmed, The Postman Always Rings Twice.This is a public domain film and looks it. Don't expect much. If the price is low enough (under $5), you might want to take a chance on it.",3,"A comedy murder mystery with a split personality, and the hyper-confident Pat O'Brien as the hero",1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,3471,"['Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'way', 'thinking', 'was', 'always', 'interesting', 'actor', 'was', 'one', 'breed', 'Thirties', 'men', 'who', 'almost', 'blasted', 'self-confidence', 'was', 'fast-talking', 'always', 'ready', 'quick', 'comeback', 'one-two', 'punch', 'was', 'hard', 'deflate', 'Think', 'others', 'such', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'Lee', 'Tracy', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', ""O'Brien"", 'played', 'up', 'Irish', 'charm', 'poster', 'others', ""O'Brien"", 'made', 'big', 'time', 'Thirties', 'was', 'great', 'friends', 'James', 'Cagney', 'starred', 'Cagney', 'nine', 'films', 'opportunities', 'be', 'leading', 'man', ""O'Brien"", 'just', 'sucked', 'air', 'away', 'anyone', 'else', 'room', 'was', 'dynamic', 'fault', 'view', 'When', 'tried', 'do', 'comedy', 'line', 'reading', 'usually', 'came', 'emphatic', 'irritable', 'When', 'was', 'playing', 'tough', 'could', 'come', 'emphatic', 'unmovable.With', 'Slightly', 'Honorable', '1940', 'film', 'directed', 'Tay', 'Garnett', ""O'Brien"", 'John', 'Webb', 'strong-willed', 'fast-talking', 'lawyer', 'who', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'Victor', 'Cushing', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'leader', 'corrupt', 'political', 'machine', 'man', 'responsible', 'rigging', 'highway', 'construction', 'bids', 'using', 'shoddy', 'materials', 'Even', 'district', 'attorney', 'part', 'Cushing', 'operation', 'Webb', 'only', 'helper', 'law', 'associate', 'Russ', 'Sampson', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'attempted', 'corruption', '18-year-old', 'singer', 'two', 'murders', 'dagger', 'two', 'attempted', 'murders', 'tense', 'political', 'debate', 'state', 'capitol', 'where', 'learn', 'how', 'much', 'pressure', 'crumble', 'second-rate', 'concrete', 'even', 'climactic', 'scene', 'night', 'foggy', 'isolated', 'cemetery', 'old', 'tombstones', 'being', 'read', 'flashlight', 'thrown', 'dagger', 'coming', 'very', 'close', 'permanently', 'ending', 'Webb', 'law', 'practice.And', 'comedy', 'least', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'background', 'music', 'jaunty', 'repartee', 'quick', 'sometimes', 'witty', 'sometimes', 'awful', 'Well', 'Webb', 'good', 'old', 'frameroo', '18-year-old', 'lamb', 'chop', 'cute', 'ditzy', 'dumb', 'souse', 'barroom', 'floor', 'black', 'elevator', 'attendant', 'who', 'eyes', 'shuffle', 'steps', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'even', 'up', 'Miss', 'Ater', 'Webb', 'ironic', 'secretary.The', 'result', 'teeters', 'close', 'being', 'mess', 'fast-moving', 'one', ""O'Brien"", 'high-energy', 'line', 'delivery', 'nonsense', 'style', 'proceedings', 'Even', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'smooth', 'avuncular', 'good-humored', 'Mr.', 'Big', ""n't"", 'able', 'steal', 'scenes', ""O'Brien"", 'Ruth', 'Terry', 'Ann', 'Seymour', 'young', 'singer', 'who', 'be', 'John', 'Webb', 'girl', 'friend', 'fine', 'delivering', 'song', 'dance', 'doing', 'young', 'ditzy', 'motor', 'mouth', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'amphetamines', 'plot', 'win', 'Webb', 'while', 'started', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'be', 'one', 'victims', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'fine', 'job', 'Webb', 'partner', 'younger', 'not', 'sharp', 'ready', 'stand', 'up', 'be', 'counted.There', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'Slightly', 'Honorable', 'first', 'leading', 'man', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'can', 'get', 'tiresome', 'second', 'Tay', 'Garnett', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'was', 'directing', 'comedy', 'crime', 'drama', 'movie', 'often', 'fun', 'watch', 'veering', 'one', 'style', 'other', 'hard', 'believe', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Garnett', 'would', 'direct', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'well-made', 'depressing', 'crime', 'noirs', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice.This', 'public', 'domain', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'price', 'low', 'enough', '5', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'chance']",Slightly Honorable VHS

495779,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00000DFQZ,rsoonsa,"[10, 11]","Frank Presnell's first of three crime novels, ""Send Another Coffin"", is the basis for this film, completed the year following publication of the original, featuring flinty Ohio attorney John Webb (Pat O'Brien)  with his wife Ann (Ruth Terry), the duo patterned somewhat upon Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles, although Webb is less suave than Nick and more eager to stir political pots.  A corrupt state politician, Vincent Cushing (Edward Arnold), is the principal target for Webb's reforming urge, and when Cushing's mistress Alma (Claire Dodd), erstwhile flame of Webb, is murdered, nearly all of the major characters seem to have a motive, including Webb, who faces most of the heat from the homicide investigation although he perceives himself to be ""slightly honorable"" when compared with those about him.  The work includes a strong comedic element along with its murder mystery and socially conscious themes.  Vivacious Terry, with her patented energy and spirit, steals the film in what she states is her favourite role, a part for which she is promised by producer Walter Wanger and director Tay Garnett that the former night club singer/dancer will be spotlighted in a musical specialty number, and that she is, one that is perfectly woven into the screenplay, this while under personal contract to Howard Hughes who loans her to Wanger for this production.  A cardinal pleasure inherent with film reviewing is discovery of works that have not received an amount of recognition that they deserve, and that is the case in this instance, for it is a piece that includes among its attributes sparkling dialogue, skillful acting and, especially, that mastery of narrative pace and rhythm that marks the best efforts from Garnett who here cunningly blends details for his established mise-en-sc&egrave;ne within the script, as is his custom.
