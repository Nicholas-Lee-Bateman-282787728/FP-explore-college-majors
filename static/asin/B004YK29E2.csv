1433339,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004YK29E2,DVD Verdict,"[0, 0]","Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict-- You have to give director Brian A. Miller credit for trying to shape House of the Rising Sun into a bleak neo-noir thriller instead of the sort of explosive, combat-heavy action-adventure typical of the feature film debuts of most professional wrestlers. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't come close to delivering on its genre promises. Dave Bautista is surprisingly good as Ray, a role that gives him plenty of opportunity to play fear and anxiety while shying away from the sort of blunt force trauma we'd expect from a guy his size and with his background making the leap onto the silver screen (in fact, his one major fist fight in the movie is utterly implausible because of how capably the other actor fights back despite being about half Bautista's size). But the fledgling actor's solid line reads and emotive facial expressions don't quite make him appropriate for a role that, in the noir tradition, cries out for a regular schmoe with whom the audience can relate when fate begins to grind him between a rock and a hard place.Moreover, Miller and cinematographer William Eubank lacked the means or expertise to give the movie the visual flair one expects of noir. It's not that the picture should been self-consciously styled like a throwback. Rather, Ray's fear is observed by the camera objectively when one of noir's distinguishing characteristics is a use of framing and lighting that evokes desperation and paranoia for the audience. Nothing about the look of the film places us in Ray's psychological or emotional shoes, and that's too bad because there's just enough going on in Bautista's performance that a more artful visual approach may have improved the movie mightily (matters aren't helped by Miller's inexplicable decision to set the movie in Grand Rapids instead of New Orleans, the location of the real House of the Rising Sun). A more aggressive use of the camera wouldn't have saved the movie from a third act that unravels and fizzles out rather than delivering satisfying, nihilistic climax it attempts, but it would have made our journey with Ray a bit more compelling.The Blu-ray's 1080p/AVC transfer has the smooth, crisp look of a feature shot on high definition digital video, though depth and detail are mostly weak due to the restrained lighting. The image fails to satisfy because the format wants clean lighting, while the genre demands grit and grain. The transfer is somehow both too clean and too muddy.The DTS-HD Master Audio mix in 5.1 surround is far from immersive, but it competently handles the movie's few bursts of action.For extras, you get a feature-length commentary by Miller and Bautista, a nine-minute making-of featurette, and brief video interviews with Miller, Bautista, Smart, and Trejo.

1433342,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B004YK29E2,JLR,"[0, 0]","Remember when people used to say that no other movie starring a wrestler could ever be as bad as ""The Marine""? Well, show them this dreck and they'll eat their words.""The Marine"" was an absolute catastrophe but it looks like the work of God compared to this. I have to admit, though, that the badness in this movie is pretty fascinating. Who'd thought that a 300-pound wrestler with muscles the size of a bowling ball could run like a sissy and be outmatched by someone half his size? How amazing is it that in a scene where Batista wants another file from his partner that the most powerful bits of dialogue they can deliver are F-words like a 13-year old? It also intrigues me how Batista could beat up a black accomplice, take him with him in his car and then the black dude then just disappears for the rest of the movie. And wait a minute, Batista suddenly has another car? What did he do with the first car? How did he get the second car?There's a plot going on about an ex-con is caught in the middle of a crime that he did not commit but the movie is so incompetently directed that it'd be more pleasurable to decipher the way it was made rather than the story it tells. One of my favorite scenes is when someone shoots a guy a few times with a silencer and then the scene cuts to the person standing there for a split second before he is gunned down. A few seconds later, the shooter puts the gun over the person's head and shoots him but in the next shot, it is shown that he actually shot him IN THE LEG!In a movie this horrible, you would think the action scenes would be entertaining, right? Wrong. The action scenes have as much excitement as being stranded in a traffic jam...and possibly just as painful. Even more painful is seeing a 300-pound wrestler get his a-- whipped by people half his size. This guy could do spinebusters, bench presses and powerbombs in the ring and yet in this movie, he cannot take down one dude in a trailer?!!!Action movies should provide visceral pleasure for audiences but ""House of the Rising Sun"" is a rarity: an anti-action action movie, one where even the most enjoyably dubious qualities are greatly missed.

Things go from bad to worse for him as he has to figure out who robbed the club and try to prove to everyone he is actually a good person now. The filmmakers really tried to go the artistic way with this one, including well over 15 minutes of filming Bautista driving through the cold city, chain-smoking and walking the streets (I finally timed it because it became apparent they were needing filler for the actual 60 minutes of story). Amy Smart plays the love interest, but the ""R"" rating comes strictly from the strippers in the club. Danny Trejo has a few lines but it is always fun to watch him. The special features:* Making of, 9 minutes. Some brief insights spliced into too much film footage to be that informative.* Interviews with cast/crew, 4 @ 8 minutes. Longer takes of what was put into the making of docu. The Trejo one was only 90 seconds but he gives that great story of how he got into acting (the story has been told 100 times - but I love hearing it again anyway).* Commentary with director and Bautista. I did listen to it but will mention why at the end here.5.1 English with subs in Spanish and English. Region 1 coded. The artwork is deceiving as he never carries a gun in the film though he uses one once or twice in self defense. The action is sparse, especially with Bautista so if you are looking for that skip this film; even more frustrating is he continually gets beat down and shoved around while never really handing out any great fighting. This is a solid showing for him on an acting front, but the writing is horrible and that ending is so bad I turned on the commentary to find out why they made it that way - and they did not have any real explanation.

Strange but true and except for the constant insertion of T&A with lots of shots of the ""beef cake muscle man hero"" to increase sales, the story was sound and the acting was done by accomplished actors from the ""A"" list.

After the club he works at gets robbed on his watch ex-cop Ray (Bautista) is told by the owners that it is up to him to find and retrieve the money and get the man who killed the owners son.  When the clues he follows leads him to question everything he wonders who's side he is really working for.  This movie surprised me a little.  The main reason is that nine times out of ten movies with wrestlers as the main star are not that exciting.  They seem fun and good for the first twenty minutes then really drag and become repetitive. This one is the opposite.  The last twenty minutes in this one are good, the build up to them is a little slow.  For a B-rate action movie starring a wrestler I have actually seen much worse.  This is not a great movie, but it was much better then I expected it to be. I did feel that the fighting could have been better, being that Bautista is the lead actor. Overall, not a bad movie.  Better then I expected. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.*Also try - Blood Out",3,"Another attempt at a WWE wrestler to carry a movie. Better then some, but still not as good as The Rock.

Actually, his acting wasn't so bad and he didn't play a part where he was invincible. He did get his butt kicked many times in this movie.The story is about an ex cop who was dirty and put in jail for 5 years. He gets out and goes to work as a bouncer in a strip club owned by the mob. One night there is a robbery and he is set up. Dominic Purcell plays one of the mob guys who runs the club. You know from the beginning that Ray, is set up and pretty much obvious by who. Ray is hired by one of his bosses to find out who did the robbery and bring them to him. As Ray tries to find the guys he gets more and more framed for crimes he hasn't done. It has plenty of action and you probably will figure out how it will end. I have to say Dominic Purcell plays a bad guy very well. I recommend this film to people who like plenty of action and a good mystery.",4,Good story and tons of action,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,967,"['Dave', 'Bautista', 'used', 'be', 'WWE', 'wrestling', 'star', 'most', 'retired', 'WWE', 'stars', 'move', 'action', 'movies', 'Actually', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'part', 'where', 'was', 'invincible', 'did', 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'many', 'times', 'movie.The', 'story', 'ex', 'cop', 'who', 'was', 'dirty', 'put', 'jail', '5', 'years', 'out', 'work', 'bouncer', 'strip', 'club', 'owned', 'mob', 'One', 'night', 'robbery', 'set', 'up', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'one', 'mob', 'guys', 'who', 'club', 'know', 'beginning', 'Ray', 'set', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'obvious', 'who', 'Ray', 'hired', 'one', 'bosses', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'robbery', 'bring', 'Ray', 'find', 'guys', 'more', 'more', 'framed', 'crimes', ""n't"", 'done', 'plenty', 'action', 'probably', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'well', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'plenty', 'action', 'good', 'mystery']",N/A
