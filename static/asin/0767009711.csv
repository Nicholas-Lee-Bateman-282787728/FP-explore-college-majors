Overall, I thought it a solid documentary of the Duke. All of his character traits are discussed and elucidated which allows us to separate the man from the gigantic legend which has been constructed around him. Most pleasing is that Wayne never took himself too seriously as evidenced by his appearance at Harvard and the making of True Grit. His range as an actor has totally been underappreciated. Ron Howard points out that no leading man in Hollywood today would have taken his role in The Searchers as it's far too complex and nuance filled for our modern times, but not for John Wayne. He had his own times. John Wayne was and is an American legend, and, although it's a clich&eacute;, I wish we had more men like him today. As an aside, without commercials many of these biographies are a slim and brisk 90 minutes which makes you wonder why we ever agreed to watch TV in the first place.",5,Excellent Documentary.,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1009,"['Well', 'just', 'saw', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'described', 'VHS', 'tape', 'only', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'Overall', 'thought', 'solid', 'documentary', 'Duke', 'character', 'traits', 'are', 'discussed', 'elucidated', 'separate', 'man', 'gigantic', 'legend', 'been', 'constructed', 'Most', 'pleasing', 'Wayne', 'never', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'evidenced', 'appearance', 'Harvard', 'making', 'True', 'Grit', 'range', 'actor', 'totally', 'been', 'underappreciated', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'out', 'leading', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'role', 'Searchers', 'far', 'too', 'complex', 'nuance', 'filled', 'modern', 'times', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'had', 'own', 'times', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'American', 'legend', 'clich', 'eacute', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'men', 'today', 'aside', 'commercials', 'many', 'biographies', 'are', 'slim', 'brisk', '90', 'minutes', 'wonder', 'why', 'ever', 'agreed', 'watch', 'TV', 'first', 'place']",N/A
3583,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,0767009711,bixodoido,"[11, 11]","I believe there have been few Americans in the last 50 years who do not recognize John Wayne, and even fewer who have never seen him.  The Duke has become a great American legend.  But despite all his fame, most people know relatively little about his life.  Wayne became so famous that the name &quot;John Wayne&quot; became associated more with a mythical figure than with a real man.  This biography attempts to go behind the manly, tough-as-nails American hero and tries to discover the real John Wayne.For only being 100 minutes long, the documentary is surprisingly good.  It is not easy to chronicle the career of a man who made over 150 films in less than two hours.  Despite this, however, I felt that this film overlooked some important elements in Wayne's career, including many of his best-loved films like the Cowboys and El Dorado.  Also, the film gives the Duke's film total at 169, while I have seen several other (good) sources which seem to agree on the neighborhood of 153.  This is a minor detail, of course, but worth mentioning.Despite its shortcomings, this was an enjoyable documentary, certainly worth the time it took to watch it.  Any fan of the Duke will enjoy this film, even if for no other reason than a visual chronology of (most of) the highlights of John Wayne's extremely illustrious career.",3,"A good, but not great, look at the Duke's life",1055030400,"06 8, 2003",2003,1326,"['believe', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'Americans', 'last', '50', 'years', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'John', 'Wayne', 'even', 'fewer', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Duke', 'become', 'great', 'American', 'legend', 'fame', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'relatively', 'little', 'life', 'Wayne', 'became', 'so', 'famous', 'name', 'quot', 'John', 'Wayne', 'quot', 'became', 'associated', 'more', 'mythical', 'figure', 'real', 'man', 'biography', 'go', 'manly', 'tough-as-nails', 'American', 'hero', 'tries', 'discover', 'real', 'John', 'Wayne.For', 'only', 'being', '100', 'minutes', 'long', 'documentary', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'not', 'easy', 'chronicle', 'career', 'man', 'who', 'made', '150', 'films', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'however', 'felt', 'film', 'overlooked', 'important', 'elements', 'Wayne', 'career', 'including', 'many', 'best-loved', 'films', 'Cowboys', 'El', 'Dorado', 'Also', 'film', 'Duke', 'film', 'total', '169', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'good', 'sources', 'seem', 'agree', 'neighborhood', '153', 'minor', 'detail', 'course', 'worth', 'mentioning.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'time', 'took', 'watch', 'fan', 'Duke', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'other', 'reason', 'visual', 'chronology', 'most', 'highlights', 'John', 'Wayne', 'extremely', 'illustrious', 'career']",N/A
