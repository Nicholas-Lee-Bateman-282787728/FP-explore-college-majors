Watch closely to see early  parallels with later legendary performances with Maureen O'Hara in films  such as the quiet man. Only about 100 mins long, but very easy viewing, and  absorbing, don't be put off by the early year of production - this is a  very good movie.",4,Wayne shows his versatility,965347200,"08 4, 2000",2000,379,"['early', 'outing', 'finds', 'Wayne', 'romantic', 'light', 'hearted', 'story', 'showed', 'early', 'signs', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Watch', 'closely', 'see', 'early', 'parallels', 'later', 'legendary', 'performances', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'films', 'such', 'quiet', 'man', 'Only', '100', 'mins', 'long', 'very', 'easy', 'viewing', 'absorbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'early', 'year', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Flame of Barbary Coast VHS
206954,A3SBCBEN4NGK5I,630020829X,B-Movie Fan,"[0, 0]","Not a classic John Wayne movie, but better than no John Wayne movie at all.John Wayne travels from Montana to San Francisco to collect a debt from a crooked gambler. He sold the gambler a horse but when he sent one of his cowhands to collect, the Gambler cheated him out of the money. Now the Duke is coming to town to collect.Along the way he meets a gambling hall entertainer named Flaxen (Ann Dvorak) and the Gambler who owns the hall where she works; the same Gambler who owes John Wayne the money. Of course if things went easy, this wouldn't be a movie; so before John manages to collect his money he has to make a fortune, lose the fortune, and then make a bigger one.By the time it's all said and done, John is involved in city politics and helping San Francisco deal with the after effects of the ""Great Quake of 1906"". This lacks the Indians, horses, and gun fights we usually associate with a John Wayne movie, and it's not a classic like the Quiet Man or Rio Bravo, but if you thought you'd run out of movies starring the Duke this is better than nothing.",4,Not a bad little movie . . .,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,1067,"['Not', 'classic', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'better', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'all.John', 'Wayne', 'travels', 'Montana', 'San', 'Francisco', 'collect', 'debt', 'crooked', 'gambler', 'sold', 'gambler', 'horse', 'when', 'sent', 'one', 'cowhands', 'collect', 'Gambler', 'cheated', 'money', 'Now', 'Duke', 'coming', 'town', 'collect.Along', 'way', 'gambling', 'hall', 'entertainer', 'named', 'Flaxen', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'Gambler', 'who', 'hall', 'where', 'same', 'Gambler', 'who', 'John', 'Wayne', 'money', 'course', 'things', 'went', 'easy', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'John', 'collect', 'money', 'make', 'fortune', 'lose', 'fortune', 'then', 'make', 'bigger', 'time', 'said', 'done', 'John', 'involved', 'city', 'politics', 'helping', 'San', 'Francisco', 'deal', 'effects', 'Great', 'Quake', '1906', 'Indians', 'horses', 'gun', 'fights', 'usually', 'associate', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'not', 'classic', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'thought', ""'d"", 'run', 'out', 'movies', 'starring', 'Duke', 'better', 'nothing']",Flame of Barbary Coast VHS

Wayne plays a Rancher who competes with a gambling tycoon on the Barbary Coast over the hand of a beautiful dance hall queen. This film also displays the infamous 1906 San Fransisco Earthquake. One of the highlights in a film that is otherwise routine. Another highlight is seeing this film in colured version instead of black &amp; white.,3,John Wayne In Different Form Here and it works,976665600,"12 13, 2000",2000,486,"['John', 'Wayne', 'reigning', 'hero', 'Western', 'amp', 'Action', 'films', 'departure', 'usual', 'tough', 'guy', 'personna', 'playing', 'chracter', 'self', 'doubt', 'Wayne', 'Rancher', 'who', 'gambling', 'tycoon', 'Barbary', 'Coast', 'hand', 'beautiful', 'dance', 'hall', 'queen', 'film', 'also', 'infamous', '1906', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'Earthquake', 'One', 'highlights', 'film', 'otherwise', 'routine', 'highlight', 'seeing', 'film', 'colured', 'version', 'instead', 'black', 'amp', 'white']",Flame of Barbary Coast VHS
