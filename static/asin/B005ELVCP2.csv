1456766,A1NLX459D0JVDR,B005ELVCP2,Ron Mayes,"[3, 10]","Series relies too much on computer animated recreations and talking heads.  Not quite boring, but there are better choices like the new History Channel series, Mankind--The Story of Us.  Where this fails to captivate the average viewer (for me that's a group of 15 year olds--I teach world history), MANKIND grabs them by the throat and holds their little attention spans hostage for the duration of the program.  Might be more of interest to an architect class than a history class.
