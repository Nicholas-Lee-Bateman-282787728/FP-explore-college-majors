Some of the best episodes there are of Blue and Steve, not to mention how Joe was introduced and how Steve went off to college. My little one loves, loves, loves watching this DVD, especially when he's almost ready for nap time or getting ready for bed. We just pop it in the dvd and let him watch until he falls asleep. Again, this teaches him so much that he won't even begin to let an adult teach him.  Sharing, gifts, people leaving.

995391,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000FSME1U,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[70, 74]","""Blue's Biggest Stories"" is a compilation DVD release designed to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the program. It contains a mix of Steve and Joe ""Blue's Clues"" stories and a bit of ""Blue's Room"" as well.""Magenta Gets Glasses"" is the only episode on here that hasn't been released before on DVD. It's a pretty neat story. In this one, Blue's best friend Magenta learns that she has to get glasses. She's nervous both about getting them and then about wearing them, but with our help, Steve, Blue and her owner Miranda help her to get over her fears.This DVD comes with ""Blue's Memory Photos"" --- a brief photo album of some major moments from the series. It also comes with a couple of ""Blue's Room"" short-segments that are actually pretty good. Also included inside is a note from show creators Angela C. Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson.The other episodes included on this DVD are as follows:""Blue's Birthday""In this Steve episode, it's Blue's birthday. We arrived early, so we help get things set up. We also skidoo with Steve to find a present for Blue. And we play Blue's Clues to find out what Blue wants for her birthday.""Treasure Hunt""In another major Steve episode, the characters go on a treasure hunt. Content from this was used for one of the ""Blue's Clues"" albums, so it's a pretty important episode.""Blue's Pajama Party""Blue's first-ever sleepover! We play Blue's Clues with Steve to find out what Blue wants to do tonight.""Steve Goes to College""Definitely an important episode. This ep is the final episode in the ""Meet Joe"" arc. Joe takes over hosting duties for the show and Steve goes away to ""college.""""Blue Takes You to School""Actually, I don't really think too much of this. The pacing is too fast-paced and rushed and it doesn't really seem to work. The idea of this one though is that the viewers, Blue and Joe are helping Periwinkle out as he goes to school for the first time.""The Legend of the Blue Puppy""Whether you like ""Blue's Room"" or not, this is definitely a major one. This is the episode in which Blue learns of her legend and searches for a special key to unlock her greatest gift --- her playroom. Once she finds it, she enters Blue's Room for the first time and talks.""Blue's Room Snacktime Play Date""You know, ""Blue's Room"" has actually become a pretty good show, but this pilot episode does not do it justice. They're trying to introduce every character and the pacing is just really slow and boring. This episode is practically unwatchable and the only good thing about it is the reading of ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."" Avoid.Overall, ""Blue's Clues"" fans will probably be interested in this tenth anniversary collection. However, if you already have all these episodes on DVD or your own tapes, there may not be much for you here.",4,"Only One New Story, But Still a Cool DVD",1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,2777,"['Blue', 'Biggest', 'Stories', 'compilation', 'DVD', 'release', 'designed', 'celebrate', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'program', 'mix', 'Steve', 'Joe', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'stories', 'bit', 'Blue', 'Room', 'well', 'Magenta', 'Glasses', 'only', 'episode', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'neat', 'story', 'one', 'Blue', 'best', 'friend', 'Magenta', 'get', 'glasses', 'nervous', 'getting', 'then', 'wearing', 'help', 'Steve', 'Blue', 'owner', 'Miranda', 'get', 'fears.This', 'DVD', 'Blue', 'Memory', 'Photos', 'brief', 'photo', 'album', 'major', 'moments', 'series', 'also', 'couple', 'Blue', 'Room', 'short-segments', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Also', 'included', 'inside', 'note', 'show', 'creators', 'Angela', 'C.', 'Santomero', 'Traci', 'Paige', 'Johnson.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'Blue', 'Birthday', 'Steve', 'episode', 'Blue', 'birthday', 'arrived', 'early', 'help', 'get', 'things', 'set', 'up', 'also', 'skidoo', 'Steve', 'find', 'present', 'Blue', 'play', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Blue', 'birthday', 'Treasure', 'Hunt', 'major', 'Steve', 'episode', 'characters', 'go', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'Content', 'was', 'used', 'one', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'albums', 'pretty', 'important', 'episode', 'Blue', 'Pajama', 'Party', 'Blue', 'first-ever', 'sleepover', 'play', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'Steve', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Blue', 'do', 'tonight', 'Steve', 'Goes', 'College', 'Definitely', 'important', 'episode', 'ep', 'final', 'episode', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'arc', 'Joe', 'hosting', 'duties', 'show', 'Steve', 'away', 'college', 'Blue', 'Takes', 'School', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'pacing', 'too', 'fast-paced', 'rushed', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'work', 'idea', 'one', 'though', 'viewers', 'Blue', 'Joe', 'are', 'helping', 'Periwinkle', 'out', 'school', 'first', 'time', 'Legend', 'Blue', 'Puppy', 'Blue', 'Room', 'not', 'definitely', 'major', 'one', 'episode', 'Blue', 'legend', 'searches', 'special', 'key', 'unlock', 'greatest', 'gift', 'playroom', 'Blue', 'Room', 'first', 'time', 'talks', 'Blue', 'Room', 'Snacktime', 'Play', 'Date', 'know', 'Blue', 'Room', 'actually', 'become', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'pilot', 'episode', 'not', 'do', 'justice', ""'re"", 'trying', 'introduce', 'character', 'pacing', 'just', 'really', 'slow', 'boring', 'episode', 'practically', 'unwatchable', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'reading', 'Give', 'Mouse', 'Cookie', 'Avoid.Overall', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'interested', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'collection', 'However', 'already', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'own', 'tapes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'here']",Blue's Clues - Blue's Biggest Stories

As soon as he was old enough to know what TV was, and who Blue was, he was hooked. I credit his amazing ability to read at age 4, along with a lot of his other cognitive skills, to watching BLUE'S CLUES on a daily basis. The only problem is, that as he got older, BLUE'S CLUES gave way to shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, so by the time his sister was born, we no longer owned every VHS cassette of BLUE'S CLUES that we'd bought. Thankfully, my kids have finally rediscovered the joy and learning of this show, so I was ecstatic when I found the DVD of BLUE'S BIGGEST STORIES.
