This movie can bring out almost every emotion. So very well done.  Should definitely be recognized by those who give out awards of all kinds.  But, maybe it has.  I will watch it again",5,Wow!!!!

Kirstie Alley shows that she really can act and is not just a comedian type actress. This shows there are many many stages of challenged people and how much people really know about it. This is an excellent movie that could be shown to children to teach them about the difference and that people all deserve respect no matter what their challenge is.,5,MENTALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,417,"['book', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'not', 'just', 'comedian', 'type', 'actress', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'stages', 'challenged', 'people', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'really', 'know', 'excellent', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'children', 'teach', 'difference', 'people', 'deserve', 'respect', 'matter', 'what', 'challenge']",Profoundly Normal

As such should be treated, respected and have the rights and chances that all human beings have. I feel that Kirstie Alley and Delroy Lindo should have won an award for their acting and their choice to portray these people. NEVER MAKE FUN OF OR BE CRUEL TO ANY PERSON. You never know what can happen to you. Anyone can be disabled physically, emotionally and mentally at any time for a variety of reasons. NEVER JUDGE A PERSON, especially if you haven't walked a mile in their shoes.In reality of today people can and are really mean to persons of any disability. They feel that they are better and that they should be extinct. They are all human beings with feelings. Its hard enough for someone that is disabled in some way to deal with their own affliction without having to deal with so many people who are cruel and mean to them. I was and still am shocked how many people are cruel out there.Quote, "" Survival of the Fittest"". Think of this Quote in this way: Survival meaning; someone who has survived an ordeal and Fittest meaning; how you treat people, example; kindness, respect,etc.. If you think of this saying this way, I feel it will take you farther in life and ads to the Quality of Life you bring to others.As I stated, YOU NEVER KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. Some people, especially children have a fear of someone with a disability and do not understand it.I highly recommend this film and I think it should be shown and talked about in schools.

IT WAS EDUCATIONAL IN THAT IT HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED FACE, AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED, LESS THAN WHAT IS CONSIDERED a ""NORMAL"" HUMAN BEING. AS SERIOUS AS THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS, IT STILL HAD PARTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT MADE YOU LAUGH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SEE THIS MOVIE.  NOT ONLY DOES IT GET THE STORY OUT THERE, BUT THE ACTING (in my opinion) IS 'TOPS'.  THE MAIN MALE CHARACTER, DLROY LINDO WAS GREAT IN THIS ROLE, AND THE MAIN FEMALIE CHARACTER, KIRSTIE ALLEY WAS, AS USUAL, SUPERB.  I REALLY CAN'T SEE ANY OTHER ACTRESS DOING THAT ROLE BUT KIRSTIE.
