But then, I watched it when ""The X-Files"" were going down the drain, too. ""Millenium"" was never out of it. The plot of ""Dark Skies"" is too convoluted, and almost too conspiracist. And yes, it picks on Carl Sagan.I can understand why a certain kind of conspiracy buff may like this series, which was cancelled after only one season, but personally I just found it boring. The same UFO-government conspiracy concept played out all over again. Besides, I don't like the nerdy 50's fashion.Why do you think urban legends become late night entertainment, while the REAL conspiracies of the U.S. government (or any other government, for that matter) are dropped down the memory hole? Well...?I almost think it's a conspiracy!Or perhaps the more down-to-earth conspiracies (the plot is set during the Cold War) aren't entertaining enough... I mean, who cares about Ronald Reagan supporting Osama bin-Laden and Pol Pot, or sending hard cash to ayatollah Khomeini, when we can all worry about Carl Sagan's connections to alien abductions, right?You've been conned by the Illuminati.

I simply couldn't watch any more because the series is a pale imitation at best of THE X-FILES. This show also lacks a sense of humor which the X-Files never did.  I remember, for example, one episode where a bunch of clowns with a circus were evaluating what a normal person was like and picked Mulder as their example!  It was hilarious.Also this series does not have any shows about separate events pertaining to alternate power or abilities in an alternate world. The X-Files had separate episodes about characters with a bizarre set of circumstances.  Scully and Mulder had to help them.  DARK SKIES, by contrast, is always struggling with the same old story line: aliens who showed up at Roswell in 1947 who wanted us to surrender to them.  The government, with an agency called Majestic, has struggled with the aliens every since.  The chief government person is played by the late JT Walsh.  Although I liked him as an actor, this role was about as well rounded as the Smoking Man's in THE X-FILES.  It grew extremely tiresome and I just groaned whenever he appeared.One difference between this show and the X-FILES is that this show is set in the 1960s, not present day.

Now, it's finally here!Dark Skies was a series that only lasted one season about government cover-ups of various incidences related to the UFO/alien phenomenon. It aired on Saturdays at 8 PM on NBC, which was generally a time-slot for family-friendly programs and did not help Dark Skies' chances of staying on the air. Not only that, but it was endlessly (and unfairly) compared to The X-Files, which was very popular at the time.Admittedly, while the two series had some things in common, they were really much more different than they were alike. While The X-Files had an overall alien conspiracy story-arc, it was also a show that dealt with ghosts, monsters, time travel, the occult, government conspiracies NOT related to aliens, etc. Dark Skies never focused on those things. It was also a 9 year journey of Agents Mulder and Scully searching for ""the truth.""With Dark Skies, the series started out with both the main characters as well as the audience knowing EXACTLY what ""the truth"" was from the very beginning. Aliens were here, they were hostile, and powerful people didn't want us to know. It was a story that started in the 1960s and was initially planned to bring us up to the present, going through all sorts of well-known historical events (like the JFK assassination) and tying each and every one of them to a government conspiracy to keep the truth about alien visitations on this planet a secret.It was very much a different show than The X-Files, and anyone who wrote off the show as just a cheap imitation should give it a second chance now that it is readily available on DVD at quite an affordable price. It is true to UFO/alien lore, and presents it all in a respectably well-done format of fiction. It comes in a great collector's case presented like a TOP SECRET package declassified for the first time. It even includes a booklet written by Bryce Zabel, co-creator of Dark Skies, made up to look like the information presented in the series is fact but presented as a work of fiction in order to avoid government intervention. Very cool for the fans!As others have pointed out, there are no subtitles on this release. While unfortunate, it should not stop people from buying this. It includes tons of great bonus features, including an all-new 3-part documentary on the making of the series which includes interviews with Eric Close and Megan Ward, the two main stars of the series, as well as the international version of the pilot episode!They really pulled out all the stops to make this a great release for the fans who have been waiting so long for it, so I highly recommend it!",5,"Finally, this epic series has been released.",1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,2722,"['many', 'others', 'have', 'reviewed', 'item', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Now', 'finally', 'here', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'was', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'government', 'cover-ups', 'various', 'incidences', 'related', 'UFO/alien', 'phenomenon', 'aired', 'Saturdays', '8', 'PM', 'NBC', 'was', 'generally', 'time-slot', 'family-friendly', 'programs', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'chances', 'staying', 'air', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'endlessly', 'unfairly', 'compared', 'X-Files', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'time.Admittedly', 'two', 'series', 'had', 'things', 'common', 'were', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'different', 'were', 'alike', 'X-Files', 'had', 'overall', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'story-arc', 'was', 'also', 'show', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'time', 'travel', 'occult', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'NOT', 'related', 'aliens', 'etc', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'never', 'focused', 'things', 'was', 'also', '9', 'year', 'journey', 'Agents', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'searching', 'truth', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'series', 'started', 'out', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'knowing', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'truth', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'Aliens', 'were', 'here', 'were', 'hostile', 'powerful', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'was', 'story', 'started', '1960s', 'was', 'initially', 'planned', 'bring', 'present', 'going', 'sorts', 'well-known', 'historical', 'events', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'tying', 'one', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'keep', 'truth', 'alien', 'visitations', 'planet', 'secret.It', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'show', 'X-Files', 'anyone', 'who', 'wrote', 'show', 'just', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'should', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'now', 'readily', 'available', 'DVD', 'quite', 'affordable', 'price', 'true', 'UFO/alien', 'lore', 'presents', 'respectably', 'well-done', 'format', 'fiction', 'great', 'collector', 'case', 'presented', 'TOP', 'SECRET', 'package', 'declassified', 'first', 'time', 'even', 'booklet', 'written', 'Bryce', 'Zabel', 'co-creator', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'information', 'presented', 'series', 'fact', 'presented', 'work', 'fiction', 'order', 'avoid', 'government', 'intervention', 'Very', 'cool', 'fans', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'subtitles', 'release', 'unfortunate', 'should', 'not', 'stop', 'people', 'buying', 'tons', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'all-new', '3-part', 'documentary', 'making', 'series', 'interviews', 'Eric', 'Close', 'Megan', 'Ward', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'international', 'version', 'pilot', 'episode', 'really', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'make', 'great', 'release', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Unfortunately, at the time it first aired, I think a lot of people assumed it was a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of the then red-hot X-FILES, and so never even gave it a chance.Trust me, those of you who have never seen the series, the producers really did their homework and incorporated all of the well-known lore and conspiracy theories regarding UFOs.  Beginning with the Roswell, NM ""saucer crash""  in 1947 and working its way logically up to the early 1960s, the series ably matched established UFO history with actual recorded history to create a believable fictionalized chronology.  You don't have to be a ""believer"" to enjoy this, but if you are you will truly appreciate the way this series ""gets it right"". Believers and non-believers alike will enjoy the many appearances by historical personalities in nearly every episode.Another thing, X-FILES was all over the map with its conspiracies and paranormal phenomena, whereas DARK SKIES wisely concentrates exclusively on UFO lore and its attendant conspiracies.  This makes the whole series much more coherent when viewed as a whole.  The overall impression is that X-FILES, which I really enjoyed when it started, became a victim of its own success, with on-again/off-again subplots that ultimately never hung together. It's as if the producers, once the show went beyond their initial premise, were just throwing stuff against the wall to see what would stick.DARK SKIES, on the other hand, despite its mere 18 episodes (plus the initial 2-hour pilot), really hangs together well in retrospect.

It comes on strong and stays strong throughout each episode; so while I can't point to any one episode and say ""That's my favorite!"" or ""That's the best!"" neither can I point to a single episode and say ""That's the Worst!"" - because the term ""worst"" simply has no application here.The strength of this show, however, does not lie in the writing but in the production itself.  Not that the writing is in any sense bad (and by ""writing"" I mean the story itself, not just the dialog); only that it couldn't carry the show without first rate execution (contrast this with several X-Files episodes wherein it was the writing - particularly Chris Carter's - that almost single-handedly carried the show). Dark Skies is without doubt the most action-oriented of any sci-fi show I've ever watched - with the possible exception of ""Threshold.""  To be perfectly honest, there's nothing original about the primary concept: an alien entity infesting human subjects.  In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a sci-fi series from the 1990's that didn't have alien entities infesting human subjects.  Nor is it unique to have, as a secondary concept, these alien entities infesting prominent people with a given society - that, too, is de rigueur for 90's style sci-fi.  The special and truly unique twist Dark Skies introduces is having real historical figures as characters.  And therein, for me, lies the seeds of destruction.I, for one, found the introduction of historical figures to be by far the least appealing part of the show.  Not from any sense of decorum (i.e., that it's in poor taste to fictionalize real people); but simply because real historical figures must necessarily end up being what's called ""wooden"" characters.  You can't flesh them out or have them advance the plot because you're severely limited in what you can have them say or do - you have no choice but to portray them exactly as they were. So while it's interesting to throw in a Jim Morrison or a Dorothy Kilgallen or a Carl Sagan, it detracts as much as it adds to the series.  And these ""seeds of destruction"" I alluded to take the form, not of alien pods ready to open but of a multitude of characters who simply weigh the show down - because you can only get so much mileage out of real people without fudging the details of their lives.  Besides, strictly in terms of Dark Skies, they are so redundant.If the strength of the show is its production, the heart and soul of that production is the characters, and the actors who portray them.  Eric Close's John Loengard is as fascinating as any hero of any show - sci-fi or otherwise - that you'll ever see; his intensity rivals Peter Weller's in ""Odyssey 5.""  He reveals his soul entirely through his actions, which is an enormous achievement because, by the time the show's over, you really truly do come to know him (i.e., to see him as something more than a piece of cardboard flapping about the set).  Megan Ward's Kim Sayers, while far more introspective, likewise reveals enough of her soul to make the radical plot shift near the end seem realistic.  Then there's J.T. Walsh's absolutely sublime Frank Bach, the ultimate bad guy/good guy.  Without the interplay primarily between Loengard and Bach, there would be no show.  And since Kim Sayers goes over to the dark side, making the introduction of a female counter force necessary, Jeri Lynn Ryan's Juliet is perfect in every way.This show, to me, sank solely from the weight of its cast of totally unnecessary characters - the historicals.  Even in real life, historical figures start to wear thin very quickly.",5,Greatest Odd-Ball Show Ever,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3750,"['Even', 'intro', 'music', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'out', 'loud', 'clear', 'not', 'X-Files', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'dreamy', 'humorous', 'show', 'strong', 'strong', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'point', 'one', 'episode', 'say', 'favorite', 'best', 'can', 'point', 'single', 'episode', 'say', 'Worst', 'term', 'worst', 'simply', 'application', 'strength', 'show', 'however', 'not', 'lie', 'writing', 'production', 'Not', 'writing', 'sense', 'bad', 'writing', 'mean', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'dialog', 'only', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'show', 'first', 'rate', 'execution', 'contrast', 'several', 'X-Files', 'episodes', 'wherein', 'was', 'writing', 'particularly', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'carried', 'show', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'doubt', 'most', 'action-oriented', 'sci-fi', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'possible', 'exception', 'Threshold', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'nothing', 'original', 'primary', 'concept', 'alien', 'entity', 'infesting', 'human', 'subjects', 'fact', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'sci-fi', 'series', '1990', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'alien', 'entities', 'infesting', 'human', 'subjects', 'unique', 'have', 'secondary', 'concept', 'alien', 'entities', 'infesting', 'prominent', 'people', 'given', 'society', 'too', 'de', 'rigueur', '90', 'style', 'sci-fi', 'special', 'truly', 'unique', 'twist', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'having', 'real', 'historical', 'figures', 'characters', 'therein', 'seeds', 'destruction.I', 'one', 'found', 'introduction', 'historical', 'figures', 'be', 'far', 'least', 'appealing', 'part', 'show', 'Not', 'sense', 'decorum', 'i.e.', 'poor', 'taste', 'fictionalize', 'real', 'people', 'simply', 'real', 'historical', 'figures', 'must', 'necessarily', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'what', 'called', 'wooden', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'flesh', 'out', 'have', 'advance', 'plot', ""'re"", 'severely', 'limited', 'what', 'can', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'have', 'choice', 'portray', 'exactly', 'were', 'So', 'interesting', 'throw', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Dorothy', 'Kilgallen', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'as', 'much', 'series', 'seeds', 'destruction', 'alluded', 'take', 'form', 'not', 'alien', 'pods', 'ready', 'open', 'multitude', 'characters', 'who', 'simply', 'weigh', 'show', 'down', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'mileage', 'real', 'people', 'fudging', 'details', 'lives', 'Besides', 'strictly', 'terms', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'are', 'so', 'redundant.If', 'strength', 'show', 'production', 'heart', 'soul', 'production', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'Eric', 'Close', 'John', 'Loengard', 'as', 'fascinating', 'hero', 'show', 'sci-fi', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'intensity', 'rivals', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Odyssey', '5', 'soul', 'entirely', 'actions', 'enormous', 'achievement', 'time', 'show', 'over', 'really', 'truly', 'do', 'come', 'know', 'i.e.', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'flapping', 'set', 'Megan', 'Ward', 'Kim', 'Sayers', 'far', 'more', 'introspective', 'likewise', 'reveals', 'enough', 'soul', 'make', 'radical', 'plot', 'shift', 'end', 'seem', 'realistic', 'Then', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'absolutely', 'sublime', 'Frank', 'Bach', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guy/good', 'guy', 'interplay', 'primarily', 'Loengard', 'Bach', 'would', 'be', 'show', 'Kim', 'Sayers', 'dark', 'side', 'making', 'introduction', 'female', 'counter', 'force', 'necessary', 'Jeri', 'Lynn', 'Ryan', 'Juliet', 'perfect', 'way.This', 'show', 'sank', 'solely', 'weight', 'cast', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'historicals', 'Even', 'real', 'life', 'historical', 'figures', 'start', 'wear', 'thin', 'very', 'quickly']",N/A

I liked the sci-fi slant of Nowhere Man in a big way, I loved The Fugitive as it depicted a man's journey, investing the viewer, seeking the truth with different locales and colorful characters; finally, one of the great things about Mad Men is the  fine recreation of the 60's era I was born in.  Dark Skies has all of this as the central character, John Loengard (Eric Close), searches for the truth about the government's cover-up of aliens discovered at Area 51 and subsequently the aftermath of alien integration into society.  All while the government wrestles to keep in under wraps.  It's a very creative show with a dark underpinning of a growing hostile alien integration into our world.  It's rap with drama and danger not the least of which is the government officially denying any knowledge, but attempting to learn how to battle the threat of alien domination.  There's a palpable need to prevent the public's probable chaos if it comes to light before it can be eliminated or contained.Also of note is this show, like the X-Files, has a powerful female co-star in Megan Ward, plus the menacing late J.T. Walsh as the sometimes cooperative government military official in charge of containing and eliminating the alien threat.Sure, this show requires a generous amount of suspension of belief and that is part of the charm.  If you allow yourself to ""get on board"" and get past the obviously ridiculous plot and, at times, laughable special effects, you will be rewarded with a great fictional journey.  There is a fantastically entertaining mix of historical figures and wonderful locales that add copious amounts of flavor. I, like many of you reading this, wished it could have gone on for more seasons, but at least it is now available for purchase.

1386085,A1T6EA2RO5H5G8,B00465I156,"Ma'rifah ""BGA""","[5, 10]","...the filming and acting reminded me of those Saturday afternoon creature features we watched as kids. I thought the pilot was well put together but then it kind of fell apart. I can see why the networks cancelled this after one season. Weak acting (save J.T. Walsh who did a good job), badly researched script (can't even get Area 51's location right), and poor quality filming (why the slow-mo, and fading in and out of black and white to color?). There is some current stuff about sightings and abductions (the Arizona lights for instance) that probably could have been woven into the script in lieu of the Kennedy's, Mercury Space Program, and some kid growing inside a cow. But, I'm not a believer in Alien abductions anyway so my comments probably have to be put in context. After all, why do they only come at night and into the bedrooms--seems like make believe 'monsters in the night', as one character says in the series. And, as someone who has been around the locations mentioned I've never seen anything suspicious, ever. Likewise, the series didn't even get the location of Area 51 correct so this should give the viewer an idea of how much [non] research went into the script (check with anyone in Neveda if you want to know where it's at). Finally, why haven't the Gray's shown themselves to people of other countries? Because they only seem to exist in the fictional minds of Americans and to my knowledge no one in Africa or the Middle East has ever reported an abduction. Do I think we are alone in the Universe, no, but there's no ""Grays"" and certainly no abductions. All those post-WW2, anti-nuclear films about aliens (great B movies for a rainy Saturday afternoon); films like ""ET"", ""Close Encouters"", the final Indiana Jones (what's up with Spielberg's thing with space aliens?), and ""Signs"" (good movie Mel); and fictional books by authors like Whitney Strebler's (spelling?) on abductions have not only made a bunch of money for those involved but also put a 'bug' in the brains of some people. It's all bla bla bla and where's the hard proof? There isn't any because it's all a fantasy.

1386086,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00465I156,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 2]","""My name is John Loengard. I'm recording this because we might not live through the night. They're here, they're hostile and there are powerful people who don't want you to know. History as we know it is a lie...""That voice-over opens most episodes of Dark Skies, a television series that ran for a single season on the NBC network between 1996 and 1997. Yet despite lasting merely a single season, it remains nevertheless unique more than fifteen years after it finished its run. That is thanks to a combination of things that made the series both unique and ahead of its time.The basis of the show is a large factor in its uniqueness. Covering the years between 1960 and 1967, Dark Skies features a strong combination of 1960s history, period setting and UFO lore. Over the course of the series we learn that following the events at Roswell in 1947, a shadowy government agency called Majestic 12 began to fight a covert war with an extraterritorial intelligence called the Hive bent on invading the Earth. As a result of that conflict, events ranging from the U-2 incident to the JFK assassination to the Beatles first US TV appearance and beyond have played a part in that conflict. That line from the voice-over ""History as we know it is a lie..."" sums it up rather nicely.The series makes strong use of UFO lore as a result. Well known elements and events such as Roswell, crop circles, cattle mutilations, abductions and the familiar gray aliens all come into play throughout the series. Alongside that are developments on that unique to Dark Skies: the grays are only puppets of the real threat which seeks to take over humanity as it once took over the grays and, as a result, what really is behind familiar aspects of the UFO phenomenon.The series shows us these events though John Loengard (played by Eric Close) who starts out as a young congressional staffer and ends up a soldier on the conflict's front line alongside his girlfriend and White House staffer Kim Sayers (played by Megan Ward). The two of them together sell the reality of the series as two ordinary young people caught up in extraordinary events that both bring them together and yet threaten to tear them apart. Leading Majestic is Captain Frank Bach, played expertly by J.T. Walsh, determined to fight the secret war against the Hive at any cost. Walsh sells the reality of events by bringing a sense of authority to both Majestic and the character of Bach. Through them and a strong supporting cast including Conor O'Farrell as Bach's right hand man Lt. Commander Phil Albino or Jerri Ryan's Majestic agent in later episodes alongside real-life figures such as James F. Kelly as Robert Kennedy, we're given a window into this shadowy conflict and alternative history.The period setting of the early to mid 1960s is also a big part of the show. Alongside the impressive sets for Majestic's headquarters with excellent period details and 1960s technology, the show features excellent costumes and recreations of period settings. These range from halls of power in Washington to Cape Kennedy, Vietnam and across much of the United States. As a result, the series presents a large range of different locations and stories covering many aspects of the period from the Cuban missile crisis to the civil rights, the space race and much more. It's no wonder then that some have called the series ""Mad Men for the Close Encounters set"".Something that set Dark Skies apart was how it unfolded. Not only did the show incorporate all of the aforementioned elements, it developed both them and its characters across numerous stories arcs stretched across most if not all of what was meant to be a first season. The series was ahead of its time in this regard but came in an odd time slot in the era before DVR's and the ability to marathon shows where such things could be adequately developed in the minds of viewers. In retrospect, it gives the series something else that makes it all the more unique.Despite all this, the series isn't perfect though. Many of the early and middle episodes of the series lean perhaps too heavily on being formulaic with Loengard and Kim arriving somewhere where the Hive is active , Majestic follows suit and the Hive is defeated in this attempt at least. The scripts themselves, more especially in some of the dialogue, give into clich&eacute;s and cheesy lines when can occasionally both the episodes no matter their strengths while occasional anachronisms occur (such as in the episode Mercury Rising which features the test of a Saturn V rocket in 1964, something that didn't occur until late 1967). Also, as strong as the period recreations and costumes are much of the time, there are occasions when the budget doesn't quite stretch to cover everything adequately. Yet perhaps nothing is more mixed in the series than its special effects which range from the excellent physical creations of the Grey's themselves to the quality of the CGI effects used when range from good to near laughable.For its faults though, Dark Skies remains a fantastic series. Its combination of 1960s history, period setting with its trappings and the use of UFO lore continue to make it unique while it also features strong actors and good performances that make use of those elements. It's a series that ended before its time and, thus, brilliant but canceled.",5,"""History As We Know It Is A Lie""",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,5350,"['name', 'John', 'Loengard', ""'m"",

If, however, you are of a more rational bent, there is no logical reason to dislike a series which incorporates historical events and people as well as the ""real mythology"" surrounding UFOs (as opposed to creating your own mythology.)  (One odd little tid-bit here: as explained in one of the bonus features, the folks behind the ""Men in Black"" movie were somehow able to exert pressure so that there are no ""Men in Black"" in this series, even though they're a standard feature of UFO mythology.)In general, the historical events and people merge well with the plot, with the exception of Jim Morrison and Tim Leary, who seem very silly.  Fans of Ronald Reagan who can't take a joke probably won't like his cameo either.  The acting is top-notch, in general, with one major exception, who is generally just a little better than adequate (I'll let you guess who I mean.  Hint: it's not J.T. Walsh or Eric Close.)It's very unfortunate that the series only lasted for one season, because the final episode was forced to remain deliberately open-ended, as they hoped they might get a second season on another station.Oh, about the music: I think almost all the original music has ended up on these disks.  I think some of the ""Beatles"" songs were originally done by Beatles impersonators.

It was originally conceived as a 5 year series that had as it's theme that all of the historical events of the late 20th Century was a lie and that there is a coverup conspiracy to hide the fact that Earth was invaded by aliens. UFO's were real and the world had been fighting a secret war since 1947.  The pilot episode was a 2-hour show directed by Tobe Hooper and written by the producers, Brent Fiedman and Bryce Zabel.  Titled 'The Awakening', the episode follows congressional aide John Loenhgard (Eric Close) and his girl friend Kim Sayers (Megan Ward) as they unravel the 'truth' hidden and controlled by a super secret government organization named 'Majestic-12' run by a Naval officer named Frank Bach (J. T. Walsh) in the early 1960's. Recruited by Majestic-12, Loenhgard is told to investigate Project Blue Book so that Majestic-12 could stop the USAF project from revealing the 'truth'. The 'truth' being that UFO's are controlled by an alien race called 'The Greys' who are slaves controlled by alien parasites called the Hive who are inbedded in their brains. As these parasites conquered and controlled the Greys, it is now time for humans to be enslaved.In their attempt to reveal the truth about the government cover-ups that include the existence of flying saucers, aliens, Area 51, Roswell, the assasination of President Kennedy, cattle mutilations, and almost every other conspiracy theory you have ever heard of, John and Kim flee across the country, pursued by the aliens and sometimes working for, or being chased by, the  secret Majestic-12 group. Our lead characters aimless cross-country trips are reflected of the aimlessness of the first half of the series. The series failed to find an audience and was cancelled mid-season.The DVD set of 'Dark Skies' made it into production after long delays and enjoyed a decent success among UFO buffs and conspiracy believers. The 6 disk set includes all episodes on 5 discs. The sixth disk contains several features and the original shorter international pilot episode. The features are very revealing, especially the interviews with the two producers. When you watch these features you might wonder if the producers are really UFO and conspiracy buffs are are just pulling your leg.In any case, the original 2-hour pilot directed by Tobe Hooper is quite good. Unfortunately, like most new TV series, the subsequent episodes are increasing awful. They are characterized by bad acting, confusing plots and scripting, and terrible production values.

If you weren't paying attention in the mid nineties or you were amongst the many too preoccupied with the X-Files, you need to see this. Sure the similarity of an alien virus or parasite in the two series makes it seem as though Dark Skies may have copied X-Files that couldn't be furthur from the truth. The Dark Skies' series concentrates completely on aliens whereas the X-Files covered every paranormal field and oddity or urban legend. For those who are true UFO researchers or fans, the events and people shown in Dark Skies is word for word a spot on recreation the best cases from early modern UFOlogy. It is fascinating to watch due to the excellent casting and far above average acting. In fact I feel that this is the best acting of it's time; there will be many faces you recognize from former or future work. This is a beautiful tapestry of love, devotion, patriotism, action, drama, comedy and ultimate adventure that is a continuous thrill ride for the mind as well as the eyes. Special effect money was clearly spent better than in most modern movies with limited budgets. Similar to '50's style movies there are times when things are left to your imagination yet, many excellent effects distributed in places where they can have the most impact. Don't miss this totally different take on the events of Rosewell, the car chases, the black mail, and let's not forget the whole thing is a trip back into the cultural feel of the early and middle '60's. A time that gets overlooked since people seem to be fascinated with '50's and classical hippie era of the late '60's. It was an interesting time when for many the ""American Dream"" was still a fresh and vibrant idea. The makers went to great lengths to put the viewer into the time, into the history and into all the relationships of the characters, without the whole thing ending up feeling like a soap opera.  Give this DVD set a chance and don't worry, someone will always be willing to buy this one from you. Classic.

The US Army recovered four alien bodies and has been keeping them a secret ever since. Almost twenty years later, young couple John Loengard and Kimberly Sayers move to Washington DC. And while investigating military budgets, John uncovers a terrifying secret. There are aliens among us. And they're not peaceful. And the covert organization known as Majestic is keeping it a secret from the rest of the world.This science fiction show from 1996 stars Eric Close as John Loengard and Megan Ward as Kimberly Sayers. The two have a fantastic chemistry that makes this show worthwhile. The series follows the two across the country in their search for answers and to protect humanity from the alien Hive. Taking place in the sixties, we are shown a history many historic events were influenced by the Hive and Majestic - from Kennedy's assassination to the Beatles and the Civil Rights Movement.  John and Kimberly's mission and relationship are certainly the highlight of the show. And the few episodes near the end where Kimberly becomes replaced with Jeri Ryan's character (Juliet), is where the series jumped the shark for me. While Juliet is passionate, there was no chemistry with John. Thankfully, the majority of the series revolved around John and Kimberly. J.T. Walsh also stars as Capt. Frank Bach, head of Majestic as a man with strong (though sometimes misplaced) convictions who will do anything to stop the Hive - as long as he doesn't have to give up control.The series has a distinct feel of X-Files meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The special effects are, of course, very out-of-date and comical at times. But the storylines, strong characters, and suspense are enough to make this series still completely enjoyable today. Creepy aliens, intrigue, danger, cleverly written alternative history, and plenty of heart - Dark Skies is a truly impressive series that I certainly recommend for any science fiction fan.Bonus Features Include:- International Pilot- Signal to Noise: Uncovering Dark Skies - a look back at the series- The Dark Skies Glossary- Original Sales Presentation- Electronic Press Kit- Network Promos- Never-before-seen proposal for Season 2",5,Fantastic SF Series,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2237,"['1947', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'crashed', 'Roswell', 'New', 'Mexico', 'US', 'Army', 'recovered', 'four', 'alien', 'bodies', 'been', 'keeping', 'secret', 'ever', 'Almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'young', 'couple', 'John', 'Loengard', 'Kimberly', 'Sayers', 'move', 'Washington', 'DC', 'investigating', 'military', 'budgets', 'John', 'terrifying', 'secret', 'are', 'aliens', ""'re"", 'not', 'peaceful', 'covert', 'organization', 'known', 'Majestic', 'keeping', 'secret', 'rest', 'world.This', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', '1996', 'stars', 'Eric', 'Close', 'John', 'Loengard', 'Megan', 'Ward', 'Kimberly', 'Sayers', 'two', 'have', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'show', 'worthwhile', 'series', 'two', 'country', 'search', 'answers', 'protect', 'humanity', 'alien', 'Hive', 'Taking', 'place', 'sixties', 'are', 'shown', 'history', 'many', 'historic', 'events', 'were', 'influenced', 'Hive', 'Majestic', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'Beatles', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'John', 'Kimberly', 'mission', 'relationship', 'are', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'show', 'few', 'episodes', 'end', 'where', 'Kimberly', 'replaced', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'character', 'Juliet', 'where', 'series', 'jumped', 'shark', 'Juliet', 'passionate', 'was', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Thankfully', 'majority', 'series', 'revolved', 'John', 'Kimberly', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'also', 'Capt', 'Frank', 'Bach', 'head', 'Majestic', 'man', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'misplaced', 'convictions', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'stop', 'Hive', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'up', 'control.The', 'series', 'distinct', 'feel', 'X-Files', 'meets', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'out-of-date', 'comical', 'times', 'storylines', 'strong', 'characters', 'suspense', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'series', 'still', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'today', 'Creepy', 'intrigue', 'danger', 'cleverly', 'written', 'alternative', 'history', 'plenty', 'heart', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'truly', 'impressive', 'series', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan.Bonus', 'Features', 'Include', 'International', 'Pilot-', 'Signal', 'Noise', 'Uncovering', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'look', 'back', 'series-', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'Glossary-', 'Original', 'Sales', 'Presentation-', 'Electronic', 'Press', 'Kit-', 'Network', 'Promos-', 'Never-before-seen', 'proposal', 'Season', '2']",N/A

First, I was not even aware of ""Dark Skies"" when it aired on NBC in 1996-97 because my rabbit-ear antenna did not pick up the channel (it still doesn't, but that's another story), so the series was completely new to me. Second, I am writing this review without having watched all of the episodes!If another reviewer were to admit to not watching a DVD set such as this one before writing a review, I would jump all over him or her (""How can you possibly review something you haven't even seen???""). So be it--guilty as charged. But I now relax my own hard-and-fast rule for one simple reason: ""Dark Skies"" is so darned good that I just couldn't wait to post a review and hopefully encourage others who may be unfamiliar with the series to give it a try.The positive reviews posted here made me as anxious to pick up this set as any release in recent memory. The series' concept--a ""shadow"" organization fights an ongoing alien invasion in strictest secrecy--is fascinating. I especially look forward to seeing the threads of various themes of UFO conspiracy theories, such as alien abductions, crop circles, cattle mutilations, Roswell, MJ-12, etc., weave together against a background of actual historical events and people during the 1960s. I love the idea, and the quality of the execution in what I've seen so far completely blew me away. Having experienced just a part of the story, I'm ready to say that this is one of the best television series I've ever seen, and it will definitely bear watching again and again. It's a real shame that it didn't last longer than its brief run.You don't have to be a UFO believer (I'm not--you'd be hard pressed to find someone more skeptical of ""extraterrestrial visitors"" than I am) to really enjoy ""Dark Skies.""
