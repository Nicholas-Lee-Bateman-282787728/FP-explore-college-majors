463745,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,630542666X,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","DOWN IN THE DELTA (for Showtime Films, Dir. Maya Angelou, Writ. Myron Goble, 1998, 115 minutes) is one of my favorite cable TV family films of the late 1990s. It is hard to believe I shied away from reviewing it for so long, since I always pair it whenever I watch it with my equally treasured masterpiece by Maurice Jamal,Dirty Laundry(see my review).DELTA was a film of firsts for me when I first saw it in 1998: the first time I ever saw my now-favorites Al Freeman and Loretta Devine. The first time I ever saw an ""old South family homestead""-oriented film. The first time I ever saw the gorgeous Alfre Woodard in a less-than-flattering role. Oddly enough, this was only the second time I had seen Wesley Snipes, the first time having been inDemolition Man.Alfre plays Chicago alcoholic Loretta Sinclair, struggling to find work when all she wants to do is party. The immortal Mary Alice plays Loretta's mother Rosa, who struggles to raise Loretta's young son Thomas (the charming Mpho Koaho) and her autistic daughter Monica (Anne-Marie Johnson). Having become fed up, Rosa issues an ultimatum to her daughter: either Loretta takes the children and goes down to the Delta to live the summer with her Uncle Earl (Al Freeman) ~ or Rosa will call Social Services.Since Woodard's character is meant to be sympathetic and reasonable when sober, she goes along with the plan. The locations are beautiful and I got a real sense of the South, the Delta, where I have never been. Trouble with this film is because of budget issues, they filmed outside Toronto!! For two decades this disgrace has been happening, but I think this was the first film I ever saw set here and filmed in Canada. It's a minor slap in the face of the South and America as a whole, in my opinion.In any case, be this as it may, this film is not to be missed. Its gentle family atmosphere will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has suffered a similar family problem; Angelou handles the story and characters with a knowing gentleness ~ and we all need more of that. The introduction of a treasured family heirloom gives us insight into the pride and history of a family, touches on the irredeemable evils of slavery, and Uncle Earl's restaurant illustrates the richness and success of the present.In other words, Angelou has given us a masterpiece of family entertainment that instructs, gladdens the heart and inspires us to be ourselves. More importantly it inspires us to share of ourselves.",5,A family classic that ought to be aired regularly on TV,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2470,"['DOWN', 'IN', 'THE', 'DELTA', 'Showtime', 'Films', 'Dir', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'Writ', 'Myron', 'Goble', '1998', '115', 'minutes', 'one', 'favorite', 'cable', 'TV', 'family', 'films', 'late', '1990s', 'hard', 'believe', 'shied', 'away', 'reviewing', 'so', 'long', 'always', 'pair', 'whenever', 'watch', 'equally', 'treasured', 'masterpiece', 'Maurice', 'Jamal', 'Dirty', 'Laundry', 'see', 'review', '.DELTA', 'was', 'film', 'firsts', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1998', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'now-favorites', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'old', 'South', 'family', 'homestead', '-oriented', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'gorgeous', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'less-than-flattering', 'role', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'only', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'first', 'time', 'having', 'been', 'inDemolition', 'Man.Alfre', 'Chicago', 'alcoholic', 'Loretta', 'Sinclair', 'struggling', 'find', 'work', 'when', 'do', 'party', 'immortal', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'Loretta', 'mother', 'Rosa', 'who', 'raise', 'Loretta', 'young', 'son', 'Thomas', 'charming', 'Mpho', 'Koaho', 'autistic', 'daughter', 'Monica', 'Anne-Marie', 'Johnson', 'Having', 'become', 'fed', 'up', 'Rosa', 'issues', 'ultimatum', 'daughter', 'Loretta', 'children', 'down', 'Delta', 'live', 'summer', 'Uncle', 'Earl', 'Al', 'Freeman', '~', 'Rosa', 'will', 'call', 'Social', 'Services.Since', 'Woodard', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'reasonable', 'when', 'sober', 'along', 'plan', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'got', 'real', 'sense', 'South', 'Delta', 'where', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Trouble', 'film', 'budget', 'issues', 'filmed', 'outside', 'Toronto', 'two', 'decades', 'disgrace', 'been', 'happening', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'set', 'here', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'minor', 'slap', 'face', 'South', 'America', 'whole', 'opinion.In', 'case', 'be', 'may', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'gentle', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'who', 'suffered', 'similar', 'family', 'problem', 'Angelou', 'story', 'characters', 'knowing', 'gentleness', '~', 'need', 'more', 'introduction', 'treasured', 'family', 'heirloom', 'insight', 'pride', 'history', 'family', 'touches', 'irredeemable', 'evils', 'slavery', 'Uncle', 'Earl', 'restaurant', 'richness', 'success', 'present.In', 'other', 'words', 'Angelou', 'given', 'masterpiece', 'family', 'entertainment', 'heart', 'be', 'More', 'importantly', 'share', 'ourselves']",N/A

I don't know how I missed it on the big screen.  Thank god for DVD.  (Too bad Bountiful is not out on DVD yet. )It is a beautifully-made family movie without sex, violence and foul language (or even harsh language for that matter).  If you want any of that or fast-paced action (Wesley Snipes in not cast in his usual role) you will not get it here. In fact, I don't know why it wasn't rated G.I wont bother to repeat the story since it has been covered by other reviewers here.  Maya Angelou has made a slow-paced but even-tempoed film that chronicles a family's struggle to stay together.  In her subtle way she almost succeeds in making us fail to notice that this is an African-American film with barely a white face seen except in flash-back sequences.  Her subtlety also extends to portraying strength in her female characters even when they are flawed.  It is enlightening to watch how she blends societal contrasts so effortlessly - the contrast between the haves and the have-nots and the one between urban and rural America.All in all, this is a good movie to watch with your family.",5,"A family movie without sex, violence and bad language.",1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,1191,"['have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'good', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'Not', 'A', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'big', 'screen', 'Thank', 'god', 'DVD', 'Too', 'bad', 'Bountiful', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'yet', 'beautifully-made', 'family', 'movie', 'sex', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'even', 'harsh', 'language', 'matter', 'want', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'not', 'cast', 'usual', 'role', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'rated', 'G.I', 'bother', 'repeat', 'story', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'made', 'slow-paced', 'even-tempoed', 'film', 'family', 'struggle', 'stay', 'together', 'subtle', 'way', 'almost', 'making', 'fail', 'notice', 'African-American', 'film', 'barely', 'white', 'face', 'seen', 'flash-back', 'sequences', 'subtlety', 'also', 'portraying', 'strength', 'female', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'flawed', 'enlightening', 'watch', 'how', 'societal', 'contrasts', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'contrast', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'one', 'urban', 'rural', 'America.All', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'family']",N/A

I am simply stating a fact, for I have no idea why this has happened. Whatever the reasons, I am always overjoyed when a movie like Down in the Delta makes it to the screen.It is true that Down in the Delta is not a major piece of film making. Director Maya Angelou, who is by profession a famous poet, does not have the experience behind the camera to bring us a polished product. What she does know how to do is to weave a tale quietly and effectively.This is the story of the Sinclair family and of a candelabra called Nathan. Nathan has been in the family since the end of the Civil War and is now in the possession of Rosa Sinclair [Mary Alice], who long ago moved from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago. She is a middle-aged widow trying to cope with her dysfunctional daughter, Loretta [Alfre Woodard]. Loretta has two children. They all live with Rosa in a small, but well-kept apartment in a rough Chicago neighborhood.Rosa is a strong woman, and she believes that family nurtures the soul. This may be an old-fashioned notion, but it remains an inspiring one. When Loretta has yet another bout with drugs and alcohol, Rosa asks her brother Earl [Al Freeman, Jr.] if he will take Loretta and the children in for the summer.Earl still lives in the Delta. Loretta and the kids find themselves in a different world. While it is never stated, it is obvious that director Angelou means for us to understand that the South has undergone changes since the great migrations to Northern urban areas. As cities like Chicago have become increasingly rough, the South has gotten much more livable. The Sinclairs there live in a fine old home in the country outside a small town. Earl has his own restaurant called Just Chicken, because that's all he serves. No one is rich, but everyone works. The town has a sense of community. Loretta's son discovers that school is much more pleasant, but also academically harder. Loretta herslef discovers that people are more willing to help her overcome her lack of work skills.The Mississippi Sinclairs are not without problems. Earl misses his son, who's a lawyer in Atlanta. His wife Annie [Esther Rolle] has Alzheimer's disease. When Loretta suggests that Annie might be better off in a home, Earl replies that she is home. As the weeks go by, Loretta and her children learn the importance of family, something her mother has been trying to teach her for years.Throughout the movie there is the story of Nathan - or rather the story of its meaning to the family. The flashbacks are minimal, but in the end this plot device works well in summing up the point of the story.",4,Loving told story,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2726,"['recent', 'years', 'number', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'African-Americans', 'other', 'minority', 'groups', 'declined', 'am', 'simply', 'stating', 'fact', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'happened', 'reasons', 'am', 'always', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'movie', 'Down', 'Delta', 'screen.It', 'true', 'Down', 'Delta', 'not', 'major', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'Director', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'who', 'profession', 'famous', 'poet', 'not', 'have', 'experience', 'camera', 'bring', 'polished', 'product', 'What', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'weave', 'tale', 'quietly', 'effectively.This', 'story', 'Sinclair', 'family', 'candelabra', 'called', 'Nathan', 'Nathan', 'been', 'family', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'now', 'possession', 'Rosa', 'Sinclair', '[', 'Mary', 'Alice', ']', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'moved', 'Mississippi', 'Delta', 'Chicago', 'middle-aged', 'widow', 'trying', 'cope', 'dysfunctional', 'daughter', 'Loretta', '[', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', ']', 'Loretta', 'two', 'children', 'live', 'Rosa', 'small', 'well-kept', 'apartment', 'rough', 'Chicago', 'neighborhood.Rosa', 'strong', 'woman', 'family', 'soul', 'may', 'be', 'old-fashioned', 'notion', 'inspiring', 'one', 'When', 'Loretta', 'yet', 'bout', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Rosa', 'brother', 'Earl', '[', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'Jr.', ']', 'will', 'take', 'Loretta', 'children', 'summer.Earl', 'still', 'Delta', 'Loretta', 'kids', 'find', 'different', 'world', 'never', 'stated', 'obvious', 'director', 'Angelou', 'understand', 'South', 'undergone', 'changes', 'great', 'migrations', 'Northern', 'urban', 'areas', 'cities', 'Chicago', 'have', 'become', 'increasingly', 'rough', 'South', 'gotten', 'much', 'more', 'livable', 'Sinclairs', 'live', 'fine', 'old', 'home', 'country', 'small', 'town', 'Earl', 'own', 'restaurant', 'called', 'Just', 'Chicken', 'one', 'rich', 'everyone', 'town', 'sense', 'community', 'Loretta', 'son', 'school', 'much', 'more', 'pleasant', 'also', 'academically', 'harder', 'Loretta', 'herslef', 'discovers', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'help', 'overcome', 'lack', 'work', 'skills.The', 'Mississippi', 'Sinclairs', 'are', 'not', 'problems', 'Earl', 'son', 'who', 'lawyer', 'Atlanta', 'wife', 'Annie', '[', 'Esther', 'Rolle', ']', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'When', 'Loretta', 'Annie', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'home', 'Earl', 'home', 'weeks', 'go', 'Loretta', 'children', 'learn', 'importance', 'family', 'something', 'mother', 'been', 'trying', 'teach', 'movie', 'story', 'Nathan', 'rather', 'story', 'meaning', 'family', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'minimal', 'end', 'plot', 'device', 'well', 'summing', 'up', 'point', 'story']",N/A

It concerns a drug-abusing mother (a great Alfre Woodard) who can't kick her habit or hold down a job.  In other words, this girl's a mess.  In an effort to get her act together, she takes her kids down south to begin a new life.  At times, the movie has a made-for-TV feel, but it's an otherwise riveting debut for Angelou.  You can feel her prescence in her directorial style; the words spoken from a few of the actors have a certain poetic flow.  So, why, then, did I give it a rating of only 4 stars?  Because the DVD has absolutely no features!  No trailer!  No production notes!  Nada!  I hope Miramax will revisit this film and give it a bunch of decent features including a making-of featurette.
