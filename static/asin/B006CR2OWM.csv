1514627,A1CDJ52UT65XGE,B006CR2OWM,Lil MC,"[220, 226]","Father Dowling Mysteries was a brilliant, original, intelligently written, and super enjoyable mystery series starring Tom Bosley (most notably for some as Mr. Cunningham on Happy Days), Tracy Nelson (daughter of famed 60's rock singer Ricky Nelson, also the sister of Gunnar and Matthew Nelson of late 80's early 90's hair band Nelson), and Mary Wickes (notably from the feature films ""Sister Act"" and ""Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit"" as Sister Mary Lazarus).Bosley plays Father Frank Dowling, the priest of a Chicago parish who runs around the windy city with his right-hand streetwise nun, Sister Stephanie ""Steve"" Oskowski (played by Nelson), solving murders, much in the tradition of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Diagnosis Murder"".  Father Dowling and Sister Steve are supported by housekeeper Marie (portrayed by Mary Wickes). Father Dowling and Sister Steve investigate murders, and in the tradition of the aforemention ""Murder, She Wrote"", outsmarting the police and criminals themselves while uncovering deeper hidden clues that the police overlook.This series started in January 1989 with a total of 8 episodes in its first season.  The series was launched by a tv-movie called ""Fatal Confession: A Father Dowling Mystery"" which aired in 1987.  The show was not given its proper due as it ended in 1991 at the end of its third season.  I hope that the tv-movie that started it all will be included in this release.  The phrase ""they don't make shows like this anymore"" is absolutely true about high caliber shows like this one.If you miss the days when shows weren't hyper-sexualized, when mysteries were solved without grotesque gore, vulgar language, and toilet humor, if you miss the days when tv used to have substance, then you will LOVE ""Father Dowling Mysteries"".  If you are a fan of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Diagnosis Murder"", then you will LOVE ""Father Dowling Mysteries"".  Father Dowling and Sister Steve solve crimes with some pluck, determination, intelligence, and heavenly guidance.  This show will give you something to believe in.",5,"Holy Crime Solving, Batman. ...

1514629,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B006CR2OWM,Marty Gillis,"[6, 7]","I am a fan of both Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson and also a huge mystery fan.  I was sad to see Tom leave Murder She Wrote as I always enjoyed the Cabot Cove episodes with Sheriff Tupper, but was happy he got his own show and always enjoyed Father Dowling Mysteries.  It is a formula show and some are better written and cast than others, but the two lead characters carried things nicely and it is a good ""cozy"" on a stormy day with a hot cup of tea.  With that said, this review will examine the product itself, both the video, audio, special features and packaging, rather than the series itself.When 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was announced for DVD it went straight to my wish list.  I now have both Season One and Two and other than the broadcast network that showed them  (NBC, then ABC), they both have much in common as far as the product is concerned so much of my review for Season One and Two are interchangeable and identical.This review is somewhat technical so if you are not into that sort of thing, I can give you my verdict here and now! Video Quality is crummy, sound fares much better and the packaging is cheap with non existent special features.Ok, on with the gory details!You get two DVD's with Season One and Three with Season Two.  There is not artwork in the discs and they are a thinner variety of media than I would have liked. Also, the cases are bare bones with the dreaded Eco styling which is almost as much air as plastic.  Episode names are inside the case and for the most part behind the discs so you need to remove the discs to see what shows are on what disc. El-Cheapo!How about the video quality? IN a word: LOUSY!  It is readily apparent that CBS home video used video tape masters for this transfer. I am talking broadcast video tape but what appears to be at least 1 or 2 generations DOWN from the original.  To make up for the horrible bad video quality, there has been an abundance of edge enhancement added and that actually works AGAINST itself as it introduces other unwanted video artifacts into the picture.  Don't get me wrong. They ARE  watchable, but long shorts are blurry, medium shots are ""acceptable"" and close-ups are ""ok"" but NONE of it looks all that great. The colors are fine pretty much and the motion is encoded correctly at least.I am going to make a guess that 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was edited on video tape after principal photography to save both time and money, much like the later years of Murder She Wrote and as such it is cost prohibitive to return to the original negatives as Viacom most likely used an inter-positive made from the film and transferred THAT to tape, the edited the shows causing another drop in generation resolution.  ANYWAY, because of all of this, it is unlikely this show will EVER look any better on home video than it does with these transfers, as sad as that may be. Phooey!  It was a huge mistake for production companies to edit on tape as far as the future home video market was concerned.  Luckily, shows like Columbo fare much better on DVD thanks to being both shot and edited on film. (until the very last few years on ABC)How about the sound? Well, that is the GOOD NEWS about this product. The sound is presented in Dolby Digital stereo and as such you can use your surround receivers decoder to give you Pro Logic Surround which is both convincing and sounds very good actually. Music sounds excellent and dialogue is crisp and clear. It is a real shame the picture quality is so poor and not presented at the same level of quality as the audio.No special features really, just the network teasers which are tacked on to each episode page and touted as a special feature when in fact they are not. No interviews, no commentaries, nothing. Phooey again!Bottom line, if you enjoy this show then you really have no choice but to purchase these sets as they exist now since it is highly unlikely they will EVER see another home video release. I still find them very enjoyable and do not regret my purchase, just be warned the video quality isn't even as good as a good VHS transfer at times. 'Father Dowling Mysteries' deserved more, better video and better packaging but like Rodney Dangerfield, it just got no respect at all!",4,"Good first season, Horrendous Transfer!",1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,4235,"['am', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'also', 'huge', 'mystery', 'fan', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Tom', 'leave', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Sheriff', 'Tupper', 'was', 'happy', 'got', 'own', 'show', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'formula', 'show', 'are', 'better', 'written', 'cast', 'others', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'carried', 'things', 'nicely', 'good', 'cozy', 'stormy', 'day', 'hot', 'cup', 'tea', 'said', 'review', 'will', 'examine', 'product', 'video', 'audio', 'special', 'features', 'packaging', 'rather', 'series', 'itself.When', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'announced', 'DVD', 'went', 'straight', 'wish', 'list', 'now', 'have', 'Season', 'One', 'Two', 'other', 'broadcast', 'network', 'showed', 'NBC', 'then', 'ABC', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'as', 'far', 'product', 'concerned', 'so', 'much', 'review', 'Season', 'One', 'Two', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'identical.This', 'review', 'somewhat', 'technical', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'give', 'verdict', 'here', 'now', 'Video', 'Quality', 'crummy', 'sound', 'fares', 'much', 'better', 'packaging', 'cheap', 'non', 'existent', 'special', 'features.Ok', 'gory', 'details', 'get', 'two', 'DVD', 'Season', 'One', 'Three', 'Season', 'Two', 'not', 'artwork', 'discs', 'are', 'thinner', 'variety', 'media', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Also', 'cases', 'are', 'bare', 'bones', 'dreaded', 'Eco', 'styling', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'air', 'plastic', 'Episode', 'names', 'are', 'case', 'most', 'part', 'discs', 'need', 'remove', 'discs', 'see', 'what', 'shows', 'are', 'what', 'disc', 'El-Cheapo', 'How', 'video', 'quality', 'word', 'LOUSY', 'readily', 'apparent', 'CBS', 'home', 'video', 'used', 'video', 'tape', 'masters', 'transfer', 'am', 'talking', 'broadcast', 'video', 'tape', 'what', 'be', 'least', '1', '2', 'generations', 'DOWN', 'original', 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'bad', 'video', 'quality', 'been', 'abundance', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'added', 'actually', 'AGAINST', 'other', 'unwanted', 'video', 'artifacts', 'picture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'ARE', 'watchable', 'long', 'shorts', 'are', 'blurry', 'medium', 'shots', 'are', 'acceptable', 'close-ups', 'are', 'ok', 'NONE', 'great', 'colors', 'are', 'fine', 'pretty', 'much', 'motion', 'encoded', 'correctly', 'least.I', 'am', 'going', 'make', 'guess', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'edited', 'video', 'tape', 'principal', 'photography', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'much', 'later', 'years', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'such', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'return', 'original', 'negatives', 'Viacom', 'most', 'likely', 'used', 'inter-positive', 'made', 'film', 'transferred', 'THAT', 'tape', 'edited', 'shows', 'causing', 'drop', 'generation', 'resolution', 'ANYWAY', 'unlikely', 'show', 'will', 'EVER', 'look', 'better', 'home', 'video', 'transfers', 'as', 'sad', 'may', 'be', 'Phooey', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'production', 'companies', 'edit', 'tape', 'as', 'far', 'future', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'was', 'concerned', 'Luckily', 'shows', 'Columbo', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'being', 'shot', 'edited', 'film', 'very', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'ABC', 'How', 'sound', 'Well', 'GOOD', 'NEWS', 'product', 'sound', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'stereo', 'such', 'can', 'use', 'surround', 'receivers', 'decoder', 'give', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'Surround', 'convincing', 'sounds', 'very', 'good', 'actually', 'Music', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'real', 'shame', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'not', 'presented', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'audio.No', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'just', 'network', 'teasers', 'are', 'tacked', 'episode', 'page', 'touted', 'special', 'feature', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'No', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'nothing', 'Phooey', 'again', 'Bottom', 'line', 'enjoy', 'show', 'then', 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'purchase', 'sets', 'exist', 'now', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'EVER', 'see', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', 'just', 'be', 'warned', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'good', 'good', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'times', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'deserved', 'more', 'better', 'video', 'better', 'packaging', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'just', 'got', 'respect']",N/A
1514630,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B006CR2OWM,Mary Kate,"[21, 21]","I've been waiting a long time for the Father Dowling Mysteries to come to DVD. It was one of my favorite series during its original run from 1989 - 1991. Along with ""Murder, She Wrote"" I considered it a sort of comfort-TV. (Like comfort food in a way, only without the calories!) I could count on both shows for an hour of decent entertainment with likable characters, (mostly) solid writing and pleasant casts.The Father Dowling Mysteries didn't enjoy the long run of Murder, She Wrote and the wait for it to come to DVD has been considerably longer. Unfortunately, now that it's finally been released, the quality of the DVDs isn't what I had hoped it would be. I knew I wasn't going to get Blu-ray quality, but I expected the episodes to look a little better than they did on my VHS tapes when they were newly recorded and they just - don't. Not really. A couple of the episodes (The Missing Body Mystery, for instance) look overly dark and a bit muddy in places and even have some odd moments where the picture jerks a little. (Forgive my techy-talk.)Aside from a promo for each episode - ""Next on the Father Dowling Mysteries..."" (which are of even poorer quality than the episodes) - there are no extras. There are, however, English subtitles.The case is just as bare-bones as the DVDs. A brief synopsis of each episode is included, but it's printed on the reverse side of the case art. That means that, unless you remove the insert from the case, you're reading the synopsis text through the plastic and some of it is obscured by the doohickies that hold the discs in place.While I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD and the packaging, I really enjoyed spending time with Father Dowling (Tom Bosley) and Sister Steve (Tracy Nelson) again and was quickly reminded of how much Mary Wickes as the housekeeper, Marie, added to the series.Included in this 2-disc set is ""Fatal Confession"", the original television pilot which aired in November of 1987, in which Father Dowling and Sister Steve investigate the apparent suicide of a former parishioner.The set also includes all episodes from the first season:* The Missing Body Mystery (2-hour episode) - After a man dies in the confessional, his body disappears, only to turn up across town. The investigation leads to a confrontation with the FBI.* What Do You Call a Call Girl Mystery - Three powerful men are suspects in the murder of a prostitute.* The Man Who Came to Dinner Mystery - Star Tracy Nelson's real-life grandmother, Harriet (from Ozzie & Harriet fame) and her then-husband William R. Moses guest star in an episode where Moses has witnessed a murder and is now being hunted by the murderers.* The Mafia Priest Mystery (parts 1 & 2) - When a fellow priest, who has family ties to the mob, is accused of murder, Father Dowling tries to prove his innocence.* The Face in the Mirror Mystery: When Father Dowling's no-good half-brother (also played by Bosley) turns up, Frank is able to thwart his attempted crime, but their resemblance to one another causes trouble.* The Pretty Baby Mystery: After a baby is left at the rectory, Father Dowling and Sister Steve try to help the mother, whose life is in danger.The Father Dowling Mysteries was a good series with an appealing cast. I'm glad it has finally come to DVD. But, IMHO, the poor quality of this release doesn't do the series justice, which is a darn shame. I hope that seasons 2 & 3 are created with a closer eye to quality.",4,Good Show - Disappointing DVD Quality,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,3456,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'come', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'original', 'run', '1989', '1991', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'considered', 'sort', 'comfort-TV', 'comfort', 'food', 'way', 'only', 'calories', 'could', 'count', 'shows', 'hour', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'likable', 'characters', 'mostly', 'solid', 'writing', 'pleasant', 'casts.The', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'long', 'run', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'wait', 'come', 'DVD', 'been', 'considerably', 'longer', 'Unfortunately', 'now', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'quality', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'expected', 'episodes', 'look', 'little', 'better', 'did', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'when', 'were', 'newly', 'recorded', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'Not', 'really', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Missing', 'Body', 'Mystery', 'instance', 'look', 'overly', 'dark', 'bit', 'muddy', 'places', 'even', 'have', 'odd', 'moments', 'where', 'picture', 'little', 'Forgive', 'techy-talk', 'Aside', 'promo', 'episode', 'Next', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'are', 'even', 'poorer', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'extras', 'are', 'however', 'English', 'subtitles.The', 'case', 'just', 'as', 'bare-bones', 'DVDs', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'included', 'printed', 'reverse', 'side', 'case', 'art', 'remove', 'insert', 'case', ""'re"", 'reading', 'synopsis', 'text', 'plastic', 'obscured', 'doohickies', 'hold', 'discs', 'place.While', 'was', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'spending', 'time', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'again', 'was', 'quickly', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'housekeeper', 'Marie', 'added', 'series.Included', '2-disc', 'set', 'Fatal', 'Confession', 'original', 'television', 'pilot', 'aired', 'November', '1987', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'investigate', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'former', 'parishioner.The', 'set', 'also', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', '*', 'Missing', 'Body', 'Mystery', '2-hour', 'episode', 'man', 'confessional', 'body', 'only', 'turn', 'up', 'town', 'investigation', 'confrontation', 'FBI', '*', 'What', 'Do', 'Call', 'Call', 'Girl', 'Mystery', 'Three', 'powerful', 'men', 'are', 'suspects', 'murder', 'prostitute', '*', 'Man', 'Who', 'Dinner', 'Mystery', 'Star', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'real-life', 'grandmother', 'Harriet', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'fame', 'then-husband', 'William', 'R.', 'Moses', 'guest', 'star', 'episode', 'where', 'Moses', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'now', 'being', 'hunted', 'murderers', '*', 'Mafia', 'Priest', 'Mystery', 'parts', '1', '2', 'When', 'fellow', 'priest', 'who', 'family', 'ties', 'mob', 'accused', 'murder', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'prove', 'innocence', '*', 'Face', 'Mirror', 'Mystery', 'When', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'no-good', 'half-brother', 'also', 'played', 'Bosley', 'up', 'Frank', 'able', 'thwart', 'attempted', 'crime', 'resemblance', 'one', 'trouble', '*', 'Pretty', 'Baby', 'Mystery', 'baby', 'left', 'rectory', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'try', 'help', 'mother', 'life', 'danger.The', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'good', 'series', 'appealing', 'cast', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'come', 'DVD', 'IMHO', 'poor', 'quality', 'release', ""n't"", 'do', 'series', 'justice', 'darn', 'shame', 'hope', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'are', 'created', 'closer', 'eye', 'quality']",N/A

1514654,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B006CR2OWM,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 1]","This 1989-1991 (with a 1987 pilot episode) murder mystery show is just dynamite, mixing far-fetched fantasy (really, how many priests uncover gun smuggling and mafia plots among their parishioners??) with gritty realism (cops and other extras/props appear pulled from the Chicago streets) in a very satisfying blend of entertainment, remaining faithful in this formula to the style of Notre Dame professor Ralph McInerny's original paperback detective stories. The show has a dark tone (often presenting mature themes and physical peril for its leads) while remaining family friendly, a rarity for television. It charms the viewer by allowing one to root for its protagonists as decent people, rather than presenting us with the nihilistic or neurotic anti-heroes we find on most police procedural shows now airing on TV. Full disclosure: When I saw parts of this series on TV as a kid, I didn't find it terribly exciting, but I'm loving every minute of it on DVD now that I'm able to appreciate the clever dialogue, even though I'm probably younger (33) than its target audience. This first season aired on NBC before moving to ABC for its last two seasons, also available now on DVD, but the show is the same thing from both networks. Some things that make it a wonderful show:1.) Authentic Chicago locations from the days before filmmakers started using Toronto to double for the Windy City, avoiding Mayor Daley's high costs for filming rights. Locations here include everything from Lake Shore Drive to the Stockyards. If you've ever visited or lived in Chicago, you'll be surprised at how many times you'll say ""I've been there"" while watching this show, even though it's 25 years old.2.) A great cast featuring Tom Bosley (""Happy Days"") as Father Dowling, a Catholic parish priest who solves murder mysteries, in an effortless performance made all the more remarkable by the fact that Bosley is both a native Chicagoan and Jewish rather than Catholic. He underplays the role with a deceptive geniality, getting serious when necessary, but never losing a sense of fun in solving the mysteries. Then there is Tracy Nelson as the cheerfully implausible ""Sister Steve,"" his sidekick in unraveling the mysteries. Looking back at this show in 2013, Nelson feels particularly odd as the reformed petty criminal-turned-nun who is so close to the pastor that she calls him by his first name and sometimes sleeps on his couch, spending more time with him than in her own convent. But the innocence and pluck of Nelson's character are charming in just the right way: Sister Stephanie is a ""naughty nun"" insofar as she picks locks and mixes drinks like a pro, but her character's quality of naive worldliness works perfectly as a Watson-like foil to the Holmes that is Father Dowling, and the mystery plots themselves are so imaginative that one rarely feels inclined during a show to deconstruct her character's credibility. Mary Wickes (""Sister Act"") is surprisingly touching as Father Dowling's scowling housekeeper Marie, who cares for him more than her external actions let on, and the actors playing recurring characters (like the gently paternal bishop, hapless young assistant pastor, and various police allies) are all delightful in their characterizations.3.) Great dialogue. This is a more cerebral TV series than many action-driven police procedural shows, making it more like the ""Star Trek"" than ""Star Wars"" of detective fiction, but the dialogue is effortless in a way that advances the plot and endears you to the characters without ever drawing attention to itself. Characterizations of good-hearted Father Dowling, clever Sister Steve, hapless Father Prestwick, tart Marie, and the scandalized bishop are memorable and never dull. It's some of the funniest and most touching writing that you will find on any TV show from these years.4.) Solid guest stars, including Leslie Nielson in the TV pilot movie that opens disc one of this two-disc set. Great acting and character interaction all around on this one. Overall, this show comes across as so far-fetched that one can only take it as pure fantasy, but it's a fantasy presented realistically enough that you care about the main characters while enjoying their adventures. A few of the guest stars are generic TV players, but everyone seems to be having fun on the show, which makes it fun to watch.There's no way to possibly take the basic ""priest detective"" premise of these stories seriously, but that's part of their charm, as they are meant to be enjoyed as pure escapism. Every episode is original and creative, refreshingly lacking in the formulaic boredom of ""CSI"" and other generic procedurals on TV today. This show is the rare murder mystery that is actually fun to watch.",5,Forgotten gem of Chicago-based murder mysteries,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,4748,"['1989-1991', '1987', 'pilot', 'episode', 'murder', 'mystery', 'show', 'just', 'dynamite', 'mixing', 'far-fetched', 'fantasy', 'really', 'how', 'many', 'priests', 'uncover', 'gun', 'smuggling', 'mafia', 'plots', 'parishioners', 'gritty', 'realism', 'cops', 'other', 'extras/props', 'appear', 'pulled', 'Chicago', 'streets', 'very', 'satisfying', 'blend', 'entertainment', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'formula', 'style', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'professor', 'Ralph', 'McInerny', 'original', 'paperback', 'detective', 'stories', 'show', 'dark', 'tone', 'often', 'presenting', 'mature', 'themes', 'physical', 'peril', 'leads', 'remaining', 'family', 'friendly', 'rarity', 'television', 'viewer', 'allowing', 'one', 'root', 'protagonists', 'decent', 'people', 'rather', 'presenting', 'nihilistic', 'neurotic', 'anti-heroes', 'find', 'most', 'police', 'procedural', 'shows', 'now', 'airing', 'TV', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'When', 'saw', 'parts', 'series', 'TV', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'terribly', 'exciting', ""'m"", 'loving', 'minute', 'DVD', 'now', ""'m"", 'able', 'appreciate', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'even', ""'m"", 'probably', 'younger', '33', 'target', 'audience', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'NBC', 'moving', 'ABC', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'also', 'available', 'now', 'DVD', 'show', 'same', 'thing', 'networks', 'things', 'make', 'wonderful', 'show:1', 'Authentic', 'Chicago', 'locations', 'days', 'filmmakers', 'started', 'using', 'Toronto', 'double', 'Windy', 'City', 'avoiding', 'Mayor', 'Daley', 'high', 'costs', 'filming', 'rights', 'Locations', 'here', 'include', 'everything', 'Lake', 'Shore', 'Drive', 'Stockyards', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'visited', 'lived', 'Chicago', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'even', '25', 'years', 'old.2', 'great', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Catholic', 'parish', 'priest', 'who', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'effortless', 'performance', 'made', 'more', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'Bosley', 'native', 'Chicagoan', 'Jewish', 'rather', 'Catholic', 'role', 'deceptive', 'geniality', 'getting', 'serious', 'when', 'necessary', 'never', 'losing', 'sense', 'fun', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'Then', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'cheerfully', 'implausible', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'sidekick', 'unraveling', 'mysteries', 'Looking', 'back', 'show', '2013', 'Nelson', 'particularly', 'odd', 'reformed', 'petty', 'criminal-turned-nun', 'who', 'so', 'close', 'pastor', 'first', 'name', 'sometimes', 'sleeps', 'couch', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'own', 'convent', 'innocence', 'pluck', 'Nelson', 'character', 'are', 'charming', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'Sister', 'Stephanie', 'naughty', 'nun', 'insofar', 'locks', 'mixes', 'drinks', 'pro', 'character', 'quality', 'naive', 'worldliness', 'perfectly', 'Watson-like', 'foil', 'Holmes', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'mystery', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'imaginative', 'one', 'rarely', 'feels', 'inclined', 'show', 'deconstruct', 'character', 'credibility', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Sister', 'Act', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'scowling', 'housekeeper', 'Marie', 'who', 'more', 'external', 'actions', 'let', 'actors', 'playing', 'recurring', 'characters', 'gently', 'paternal', 'bishop', 'hapless', 'young', 'assistant', 'pastor', 'various', 'police', 'allies', 'are', 'delightful', 'characterizations.3', 'Great', 'dialogue', 'more', 'cerebral', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'action-driven', 'police', 'procedural', 'shows', 'making', 'more', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'detective', 'fiction', 'dialogue', 'effortless', 'way', 'plot', 'characters', 'ever', 'drawing', 'attention', 'Characterizations', 'good-hearted', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'clever', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'hapless', 'Father', 'Prestwick', 'tart', 'Marie', 'scandalized', 'bishop', 'are', 'memorable', 'never', 'dull', 'funniest', 'most', 'touching', 'writing', 'will', 'find', 'TV', 'show', 'years.4', 'Solid', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'TV', 'pilot', 'movie', 'disc', 'one', 'two-disc', 'set', 'Great', 'acting', 'character', 'interaction', 'around', 'one', 'Overall', 'show', 'across', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'presented', 'realistically', 'enough', 'care', 'main', 'characters', 'enjoying', 'adventures', 'few', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'generic', 'TV', 'players', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'show', 'watch.There', 'way', 'possibly', 'take', 'basic', 'priest', 'detective', 'premise', 'stories', 'seriously', 'part', 'charm', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'pure', 'escapism', 'episode', 'original', 'creative', 'refreshingly', 'lacking', 'formulaic', 'boredom', 'CSI', 'other', 'generic', 'procedurals', 'TV', 'today', 'show', 'rare', 'murder', 'mystery', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
