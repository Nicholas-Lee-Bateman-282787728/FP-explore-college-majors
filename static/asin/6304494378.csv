Robin Quivers,as herself,met Howard in 1981 when he joined DC 101 in Washington,D.C. as a talk show host and she was a newswoman. Mary McCormack is Alison Berns Stern who Howard met while he studied for his communications degree at Boston University. Paul Giamatti is Kenny ""Pig Vomit"" Rushton,the program director at New York City's now-defunct WNBC 660 AM. Howard is returning home to his family and supermodel Carol Alt sat next to Howard on the aircraft in which they traveled. As themselves are Howard's other team members,Fred Norris,who Howard met in Hartford,Connecticut in '79,Gary Dell'Abate,the producer and Jackie ""Jokeman"" Martling,the head writer. Alison Janney is Dee Dee,the DC 101 programming director. Norris and Quivers,since Howard first met them,have stuck with Stern everywhere he went to this very day. Stern met Dell'Abate and Martling at WNBC in '84(Stern came to the station 2 years earlier). If you're a Howard Stern fan,this film is for you. WNBC was bought out by WFAN,a sports station,in 1988. Stern and his team were fired from WNBC in September 1985 and two months later,they went to the newly christened K-Rock,where they still are today. Howard and Alison have been divorced since 1999 after 21 years of marriage. The couple have had three daughters. Betty Thomas,who starred on NBC's Hill Street Blues,directed this film. She also directed ""The Brady Bunch Movie"". Giamatti also appeared in ""Donnie Brasco"",""The Cable Guy"" and ""Big Fat Liar"".

425856,A2582KMXLK2P06,6304494378,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Private Parts isn't *nearly* as outrageous as it once was. Yes, back in 1997 this was probably considered a pretty shocking film with many whacky and disrespectful antics on the part of Howard Stern and his cast of misfits, but in todays world -with the variety of films we have today intended solely for shock value- not so much. It's fairly tame in comparison, actually.Sure, the storyline does a decent job showing you how dysfunctional Howard Stern really is, specifically because of his upbringings (his father kept calling him a moron, for one thing) and the movie does a *very* good job showing you how Stern got into the radio broadcasting business, but the once considered downright *daring* style of comedy that made Stern so popular and innovative back in the day honestly doesn't seem nearly as outrageous as it does today, so Private Parts kind of feels boring and... dare I say, fairly normal, in several spots as a result.However, I fully realize Howard Stern's dirty and shocking comedic style was completely original at the time- it's just these days we've become *used* to these kind of comedy films dominating much of our movie selections on any number of movie channels, so the best thing a film like Private Parts can accomplish is allowing us to reflect on the days when this kind of disrespectful humor was brand new and actually lived up to its name of being *shocking*.That doesn't mean I'm calling Stern's style of humor mild or anything- just mild in comparison to the world we live in today. What does this mean for you? It means you shouldn't expect Private Parts to offer anything you haven't already seen over the last 10 years of watching comedy films.  Only one or two moments honestly made me go ""Wow, that's intense!""  One of them being the naked woman who walks into the studio and actually makes out with Stern right there on the floor.  Very shocking.Now, I'm not sure if every single attempt to shock his radio listeners that we see in the film actually took place or not, but let's be honest here- his wife must be the greatest single living breathing person in the entire WORLD if she was actually able to see through Howard Stern's insulting personality and his many constant aggressive attempts to shock his listeners.  Only the most understanding woman in the world would want to start a family with someone like him. Talk about *extremely* impossible to believe.I mean come on- Stern completely trashes his wife on the air and yet... she cares about it and feels insulted *sometimes*, but not nearly as often to seem believable from where I'm standing.I'm sure in reality the arguments that took place between Stern and his wife were much angrier and on the brink of separation than this film makes their relationship appear. It would be pretty darn hard to imagine *anyone* in a relationship not having a problem with their partner going on the air and spouting what most normal people would consider very personal and realistic problems. I simply refuse to believe the fighting incidents you see between them was ANYWHERE near as tame as Private Parts made them seem.Overall, sure, you'll experience a few worthwhile and solid laughs watching Private Parts, no doubt about it. But watching the film this afternoon, I'm more surprised the most interesting aspect of it was Howard Stern's coming into the world of radio, and MUCH less interesting to me was the actual shock value of his dirty attempts to draw in listeners (which felt disappointingly tame because, again, we've seen worse these days).",3,"not very good, but tolerable",1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,3546,"['Private', 'Parts', ""n't"", '*nearly*', 'as', 'outrageous', 'once', 'was', 'Yes', 'back', '1997', 'was', 'probably', 'considered', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'film', 'many', 'whacky', 'disrespectful', 'antics', 'part', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'cast', 'misfits', 'todays', 'world', 'variety', 'films', 'have', 'today', 'intended', 'solely', 'shock', 'value-', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fairly', 'tame', 'comparison', 'actually.Sure', 'storyline', 'decent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'really', 'specifically', 'upbringings', 'father', 'kept', 'calling', 'moron', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', '*very*', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Stern', 'got', 'radio', 'broadcasting', 'business', 'once', 'considered', 'downright', '*daring*', 'style', 'comedy', 'made', 'Stern', 'popular', 'innovative', 'back', 'day', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'nearly', 'as', 'outrageous', 'today', 'so', 'Private', 'Parts', 'kind', 'feels', 'boring', 'dare', 'say', 'fairly', 'normal', 'several', 'spots', 'result.However', 'fully', 'realize', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'dirty', 'shocking', 'comedic', 'style', 'was', 'completely', 'original', 'time-', 'just', 'days', ""'ve"", 'become', '*used*', 'kind', 'comedy', 'films', 'dominating', 'much', 'movie', 'selections', 'number', 'movie', 'channels', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Private', 'Parts', 'can', 'accomplish', 'allowing', 'reflect', 'days', 'when', 'kind', 'disrespectful', 'humor', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'actually', 'lived', 'up', 'name', 'being', '*shocking*.That', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'m"", 'calling', 'Stern', 'style', 'humor', 'mild', 'anything-', 'just', 'mild', 'comparison', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'What', 'mean', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Private', 'Parts', 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'last', '10', 'years', 'watching', 'comedy', 'films', 'Only', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'honestly', 'made', 'go', 'Wow', 'intense', 'One', 'being', 'naked', 'woman', 'who', 'studio', 'actually', 'out', 'Stern', 'right', 'there', 'floor', 'Very', 'shocking.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'single', 'attempt', 'shock', 'radio', 'listeners', 'see', 'film', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'here-', 'wife', 'must', 'be', 'greatest', 'single', 'living', 'breathing', 'person', 'entire', 'WORLD', 'was', 'actually', 'able', 'see', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'insulting', 'personality', 'many', 'constant', 'aggressive', 'attempts', 'shock', 'listeners', 'Only', 'most', 'understanding', 'woman', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'start', 'family', 'someone', 'Talk', '*extremely*', 'impossible', 'believe.I', 'mean', 'come', 'on-', 'Stern', 'completely', 'wife', 'air', 'yet', 'feels', 'insulted', '*sometimes*', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'often', 'seem', 'believable', 'where', ""'m"", 'standing.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reality', 'arguments', 'took', 'place', 'Stern', 'wife', 'were', 'much', 'angrier', 'brink', 'separation', 'film', 'relationship', 'appear', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'hard', 'imagine', '*anyone*', 'relationship', 'not', 'having', 'problem', 'partner', 'going', 'air', 'spouting', 'what', 'most', 'normal', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'very', 'personal', 'realistic', 'problems', 'simply', 'refuse', 'believe', 'fighting', 'incidents', 'see', 'was', 'ANYWHERE', 'near', 'as', 'tame', 'Private', 'Parts', 'made', 'seem.Overall', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'experience', 'few', 'worthwhile', 'solid', 'laughs', 'watching', 'Private', 'Parts', 'doubt', 'watching', 'film', 'afternoon', ""'m"", 'more', 'surprised', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'was', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'coming', 'world', 'radio', 'MUCH', 'less', 'interesting', 'was', 'actual', 'shock', 'value', 'dirty', 'attempts', 'draw', 'listeners', 'felt', 'disappointingly', 'tame', 'because', 'again', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'days']",Private Parts VHS

We didn't see him get  beat up by blacks when living in a predominantly black community. We didn't see his comical sexual experiences during his adolescent years as he described in this book.

425862,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6304494378,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 5]","Before 'Private Parts', Howard Stern was a virtual unknown round these parts, at best a shady creature of rumour.  Whereas for an American audience, presumably familiar with the dj's shock-shtick, the film has a nostalgic impulse, offering a quaint re-run of censorship- and taste-baiting episodes; this material was new to us - the shock-jock phenomenon has had very little impact in a Europe long inured to shock.  So some of the material was predictable and juvenile; the on-air naked masseuse or the proxy orgasm; some of it was simply funny, such as the 'fill-in-the-blanks' word-game after rude words are banned by WNBC management; but some of it was genuinely unsettling, in particular Stern's personal jokes on radio in reaction to his wife's miscarriage.  It shows the unexpected extent to which Stern has made you care for his characters in spite of yourself, that your laughs at this point are uncomfortable at best.Stern is ostensibly telling his life-story to a pretty woman on an airplane.  Originally repulsed by his reputation as a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, foul-mouthed jock, she admits, in his words, that he grows on you, like fungus, and this is the effect his film has.  In a weird way, Stern is a kind of soft-rock Woody Allen, adapting the intellectual loser/little man, New York Jewish persona in a pseudo-autobiographical tale that has him walking through the important episodes of his life.  There is even a (parodic) allusion to Ingmar Bergman (an obscene puppet show staged for an old folks' home), and a cameo by Mia Farrow.  Stern is a film-maker manque, who made an award-winning short at college.While Allen's self-absorption tends towards negation and psychic self-flagellation, Stern's is whitewashing and self-congratulatory - but the intense egotism has the same effect: you initially resist, you eventually succumb.  Stern becomes engaging, not because you buy the self-pity of the sickly happy-families routine or the 'it's only an act' justifications, but because his limited acting talent fits in ingratiatingly with the vignette-structure, which bypasses psychological realism to achieve a cartoon honesty.  His spat with WNBC won't tell you anything about the state of the American media, or the corporate suppression of free speech, but it does tell you  a lot about Stern, consistently anxious about being 'a real man', and his need to find a ridiculous straw target he can knock down and emasculate to feel good.  Significantly, the film finishes in 1985, with Stern at his peak, and nowhere else to go.

If I--your humble reviewer--wish to get Mrs. Mikels upset in a New York minute all I need do is tune in to a Stern TV broadcast, then watch this normally tolerant woman start foaming at the mouth.Yep, couch time again.Unfortunately, Stern's outrageous, misogynistic persona is neutered in this film--no doubt to appeal to a mainstream audience.  But by softening Stern the character becomes a superficial parody; a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; Howard is unappealing to both his fans and his dissenters.  Granted, the movie depicts some of Stern's famous (infamous?) radio spoofs, but only as a device to show Howard as a disc jockey trying to break free from the bondage of management nimrods rather than the broadcaster's true psychological inclination.Kind of takes all the fun out of the man, if you ask me.On the positive side (and the film, as I've said, does have its moments), Stern is surprisingly comfortable and believable in front of a camera, and his unwavering loyalty to fellow broadcaster Robin Quivers is fascinating.

However, this is still a funny film in its own right, and gave him a little more dimension to his radio personality and why he was so outrageous to begin with.Based on his book, the movie covers some ground in his childhood, with a father constantly yelling at him and a (s)mother, that it starts going into Woody Allen territory, but the seeds are planted that he wants to be on the radio as a personality.I think that with Second City actress turned director Betty Thomas and Ivan Reitman producing, they took a potentially one dimensional crassfest into a real story, starring someone who had no acting experience that did a great job in seeming natural at it.Robin and Fred have significant roles in the film, the point is that the show was not just him, but the group assembled, without which he never would have succeeded the way he did.In true Stern fashion, the film has no shortage of naked women, featured in between scenes being interviewed by his producer Gary.Another reason to watch this is for the people who broke out of this film and have since become well known in their own right:There are 2 future ""West Wing"" actors on here. One is Mary McCormack, who plays Howard's wife Allison, who supports him through thick and thin, although the marriage fell apart early on  in the marriage, and made comedy out of a personal tragedy. Allison Janney plays a radio producer that gets under Robin's skin.The biggest reason to watch this is for Paul Giamatti's breakout performance as Howard's nemesis. Even if you're not a Howard Stern fan, Giamatti is the biggest reason to watch this over the top performance that even ""Sideways"" didn't capture.Longtime character actors Richard Shull and Richard Portnow have great scenes, the former as Symphony Sid and the latter as Howard's father, and ""Tilt"" actor Michael Murphy as Roger Erlick.There are a lot of veteran character actors in this film (as well as well known adult film stars like Jenna Jameson.... The MTV awards shows have a bunch of cameos (Tiny Tim at the awards?), and a brief clip of ""Soprano"" Edie Falco as one of Alison's friends driving in the car. AC/DC is also in the film towards the end. And of course the ""Wack pack"" put in an appearance as well.However, Howard is the central character through it all, and brings forth a warmth that isn't shown so much on the radio show, which can be very mean, that he was just a misfit that never fit in whether he was unknown or the king of all media. I think that this film converted more women to his audience because of his relationship to Alison in it.The shortcoming of the film is that for the longtime fans, they would expect something far less mainstream. It stops in the mid 80s, where ""Miss America"" would pick up the man in his prime.The DVD itself is barebones, but the price is good. It screams for a special edition due to his following and the film itself having been up for AFI's all time comedies (it barely missed the top 100). It had a platinum selling soundtrack with a killer collection of songs (which had originally slated Tool to cover Led Zeppelin's ""No Quarter"" and VH with David Lee Roth's ""Can't Get This Stuff No More""). THe actors have since gone on to bigger things since, and chances are that he'll never make another movie. There has been a TV version and had mentioned a lot of outtakes, behind the scenes footage as well as the MTV premiere featuring Rob Zombie and Janes Addiction. A commentary with the actors, or just Stern and his crew would have been great to have been able to include on here, especially since he had made the movie AT THE SAME TIME he was doing his morning radio show.Other recommended films: FM, Pump Up The Volume, Good Morning Vietnam, Talk Radio, Play Misty For Me, High Fidelity, Airheads, Network, Broadcast News, American Graffiti, and Lenny.",3,"The movie is 4 stars, the DVD 2.

Sterns humor style (deadpan and cynical delivery) and his excellent writing staff/supporting cast made his show truly a phenomanom in it's heyday. Personally, I loved the show for more than a decade hearing him first locally in Washington,D.C then in syndication from New York. Stern truly did introduce a lot of great humor to the airwaves and transitioned from record-spinner/joketeller to unique humorist. That said, I've come to realize that it's perfectly possible to like the ""Howard Stern Show"" and NOT like Howard Stern.The events since this film was released has dated this autobiography. The film is a semi-love story about Howards committment to now ex-wife Alison regardless of his irreverent on-air life of fart jokes and lesbian stripper guests. The film also celebrates Stern's battles against censorship, a fight he surrendered from when he moved to satellite radio, all the while hyping his ""little guy against big censorship"" rap that is obviously flat now that listeners must pay and Stern himself never spent a day in court fighting for his rights as a broadcaster. Lenny Bruce was a bloated dope fiend in the end, but he had the balls to fight censorship while Stern has only played the ""role"" of a free speech warrior.Without these faults, ""Private Parts"" still won't satisfy many hardcore fans because of the sweet natured romantic tone between Howard and Alison as well as the diluted nature of the shows humor. Maybe this film was intended as a crossover to audiences unfamilar with Stern.True fans will be much happier with bootlegs of ""Butt Bongo Fiesta"" or the New Years Special that Stern put out.Stern belongs BEHIND a microphone with Fred Norris,Robin,Jackie Martling and Gary nearby.

There really is no middle ground, when it comes to him. For anyone living in a cave for the last twenty years, he is the comedic 'shock jock', who pretty much pioneered the ideal, that you could talk & do just about anything on the FCC controlled radio air waves. The movie comedy, ""Private Parts"" is a hilarious portrayal of Stern's life and his rise to fame & success in the radio business. But it is also something else. Who would have thought, that the so called 'shocking', ""King of All Media"" would create for his first theatrical film ...a good old fashion love story? Thats right, instead of going the easy route of bimbos and bodily functions (O.K., there in the movie too!) he presents, what is essentially a love letter to his (now ex) wife, Alison. This autobiography gets everything right, from his geeky, introverted childhood (""Seinfeld's"" George Costanza's parents have nothing on Howard's mother & father!) to his early days as a really bad Disc Jockey to his rise to fame as the #1 radio personality in the #1 radio market, New York City. Eventually Stern would reach national prominance in radio syndication. All along this journey the movie features all the ups and downs of Howard's marrige & relationship to Alison (well played by actress Mary McCormack). Director, Betty Thomas does a credible job at presenting us with an entertaining and very funny movie. The cast does quite well. It might not be big stretch to play himself, but Howard Stern proves he can actually act and his brand of humor can make the leap from radio to film. Kudos also for the rest of the Stern show regulers Robin Quivers, Jackie ""the Jokeman"" Martling and the always stone faced, Fred Norris. But the real scene stealer of the film is comic actor, Paul Giamatti.Giamatti plays the thankless but gut busting funny role of Howard's WNBC boss, who was nicknamed ""Pig Vomit"" on the radio show. With eyes and veins bulging the character tries to reign in and censor Stern and his often scatological program.Giamatti is just truely hilarious as he practically has a nervous breakdown, while Stern harangues him, live on the air! A classic comic moment that has to be seen to be believed! If you are a Howard Stern fan or just a fan of really good comedy, I would highly recommend this very funny film",5,"""No, Say it again...

As a comedy, it was intermittently funny, although not terribly imaginative. The fun is in learning more about Stern's perspective on his own life, and in seeing his crew play themselves (initially, younger versions of themselves). The element of self-deprecation is kind of original, and makes for some of the movie's best moments, but pseudo-sexy scenes, such as when Stern gives a woman an orgasm by having her sit on a speaker while he makes a raspberry, are played for far more value than they're worth.

425890,AZI0O32W4ZYGH,6304494378,"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon""","[1, 2]","Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" does an excellent job examining Stern's life from his youth to his radio days.  The movie humanizes Stern by showing that although he is known for his rebellious antics on the radio, he actually has concerns for people who are in his life, including his former wife, who he met when he was young.  The movie does present some scenes that give a superficial impression of how controversial Stern is.  Scenes such as him asking a caller to make sex-sounds on the air, for instance, are prevalent in the movie; however, the movie is in fairly good taste.On the acting: the acting is actually quite well-done, and I suspect the main reason is because he's playing himself.  But many other actors would have a difficult time playing themselves, including quite embarassing roles regarding their past.  (In Howard's case, his hair in the 1970s was probably a huge embarassment).  Yet there was this feeling that one was visiting him throughout his life . . . that this was real and not actually a movie about the man.So what happens?  The most important part of the movie relates to Howard's close associates--such as Robin.  Howard Stern meets Robin when she works as a newscaster on the air, present objective information.  He starts to ask her questions about her personal life, which was quite uncommon in the old days, and later, chooses to hire her as another on-air personality.  We see from this movie that Howard was also willing to confront traditional rules and regulations regarding the airwaves and see how far it could go.  Stations that cover his radio show have been fined millions of dollars for his experimentation.  Yet Howard continues to this day.  And we can see from recent developments that Mr. Stern has had a huge impact on our culture.The FCC, for instance, recently ruled that one may use the F-word on the radio and television, as long as the comment is not related to the description of the act in which the word describes.

Here we have an original comedy, presented in no off-hand manner: reportedly HS spent years researching scripts. We get a full, believable movie, not only because of the star's belief in the project but because the whole production looks and sounds right. His early years in radio are intriquing, as he searches for his own radio and personal(?) identity amidst poverty line production values. I say ""radio identity"" because there is no doubt that although he is called ""The King Of All Media"", he was made for radio - a great voice, a style of predictable unpredictability. Like, ofcourse he's going to say something wild, but *how wild this time*?The personal story is well directed and well acted, although some Sternologists might feel that Mary McCormack's Allison is too much a stretch: the real Mrs. Stern is a successful Psychologist *and* the heart of Howard's life without the ""feminist"" underpinning. McCormack's performance is excellent however - particularly in the ""making a baby"" scene. Her matter-of-fact statement that she's ""ready"" is brilliantly expressed - a poignant meeting of the practical and the romantic.Robin Quivers does a fine job of acting although she does not emote as she could have in the scene where she meets her future teammate. Stern immediately shatters all concerns of propriety as they converse on the air and Quivers has very little reaction. A person trying to build a career in radio around 1981 would have had dilated pupils at least when the thought that her career might be over any second because of some newcomer's attempt to turn the industry upside down and use her as an instrument. At the time, talking to a Newsperson on the air was not encouraged, especially talking about ""private"" area stuff. Whether it's faulty direction or not here is a question.An entertaining performance is delivered by Allison Janney as Dee Dee, the (apparent) Assistant Manager or Program Director in Washington, D.C. Her acting is nuanced, with her mid-30ish character displaying great opprobrium when confronted with the iconoclast on the professional level, while suppressing a certain interest in his ideas on another.I wish that more time could have been spent on his political viewpoints because by the end of the picture we get the uncomfortable feeling that our anti-hero is portrayed more as just another show business exponent with another bag of gimmicks than a real original.

As much as it does, at times, candy-coat the raunchy nature of Howard Stern's radio show, PRIVATE PARTS will never convert adamant Howard-haters.Still if you sit back and enjoy the story, this is a fun movie about the rise of a famous (and to some infamous) radio personality who invented a genre of talk show that's been copied relentlessly over the last 20 years.Directed by ""Hill Street Blues"" actress Betty Thomas and loosely based on a best selling book by the same title, PRIVATE PARTS stars all the characters Howard made famous since the early 80s on DC and New York City radio shows.As a result, this cast is mostly comprised of non-actors playing themselves, at various stages of their lives so you have to ""suspend belief,"" as Howard himself urges viewers at the beginning of this film.  (A 40 year old Howard Stern doesn't look like the geeky teenager he once was, though trust me he still looks geeky).Since every Howard fan has already seen this film many times over, I would recommend PRIVATE PARTS to open-minded people who are unfamiliar with him but up for a great tale about the life (complete with its struggles and successes) of one of the most controversial characters of the late 20th century.Because I love his actual radio show, but found his old TV show, lacking dimensions of Howard that do not involve sex workers, I appreciated director Betty Thomas's approach to telling the Howard story.  Rather than exclusively focusing on lesbians and pornography, Thomas also reveals the conflicting nature of Howard Stern, complete with an overbearing, critical father, an off-kilter mother and Howard's disturbingly normal and loving relationship with his wife.What I loved best about PRIVATE PARTS were the scenes that depicted random people hearing Howard Stern's radio and literally looking shocked by what they were hearing.  I remember the first time I heard Howard during the summer of 1985 when he was still on WNBC.  What I heard that afternoon startled me and that is precisely what has kept me tuning in ever since.It's not that I agree with Howard (though more often than not I do) it is just that I never hear people say the things that come out of his mouth.  And that in a nutshell is precisely what makes Howard great.  Rather than a foul-mouthed shockmeister, Howard is really the voice of a silenced group of people most of us interact with every day.  It is not the voice of left-leaning Hollywood with its politically correct poster children.Instead Howard is the vocal mouthpiece of the random Joe, who secretly thinks about sex 24 hours a day while straddling the fence between liberal and conservative opinions. Because ultimately he is obsessively concerned with himself, his weight, his body functions and the world around him as it relates to him, Stern offers a stream of conscious window into the inner minds of those complicated middle Americans who voted for Bush, made Bay Watch must-see TV and who to this day continue to baffle exit-pollers.-- Regina McMenamin",4,Howard Goes Hollywood: The Life of a Modern Radio Legend,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,3044,"['film', 'not', 'everyone', 'As', 'much', 'times', 'candy-coat', 'raunchy', 'nature', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'radio', 'show', 'PRIVATE', 'PARTS', 'will', 'never', 'convert', 'adamant', 'Howard-haters.Still', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'story', 'fun', 'movie', 'rise', 'famous', 'infamous', 'radio', 'personality', 'who', 'invented', 'genre', 'talk', 'show', 'been', 'copied', 'relentlessly', 'last', '20', 'years.Directed', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'actress', 'Betty', 'Thomas', 'loosely', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'PRIVATE', 'PARTS', 'characters', 'Howard', 'made', 'famous', 'early', '80s', 'DC', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'radio', 'shows.As', 'result', 'cast', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'non-actors', 'playing', 'various', 'stages', 'lives', 'so', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'Howard', 'viewers', 'beginning', 'film', '40', 'year', 'old', 'Howard', 'Stern', ""n't"", 'look', 'geeky', 'teenager', 'once', 'was', 'trust', 'still', 'geeky', '.Since', 'Howard', 'fan', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'would', 'recommend', 'PRIVATE', 'PARTS', 'open-minded', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'up', 'great', 'tale', 'life', 'complete', 'struggles', 'successes', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'characters', 'late', '20th', 'century.Because', 'love', 'actual', 'radio', 'show', 'found', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'lacking', 'dimensions', 'Howard', 'do', 'not', 'involve', 'sex', 'workers', 'appreciated', 'director', 'Betty', 'Thomas', 'approach', 'telling', 'Howard', 'story', 'Rather', 'exclusively', 'focusing', 'lesbians', 'pornography', 'Thomas', 'also', 'conflicting', 'nature', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'complete', 'overbearing', 'critical', 'father', 'off-kilter', 'mother', 'Howard', 'disturbingly', 'normal', 'loving', 'relationship', 'wife.What', 'loved', 'best', 'about', 'PRIVATE', 'PARTS', 'were', 'scenes', 'depicted', 'random', 'people', 'hearing', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'radio', 'literally', 'looking', 'shocked', 'what', 'were', 'hearing', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Howard', 'summer', '1985', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'WNBC', 'What', 'heard', 'afternoon', 'startled', 'precisely', 'what', 'kept', 'tuning', 'ever', 'since.It', 'not', 'agree', 'Howard', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'do', 'just', 'never', 'hear', 'people', 'say', 'things', 'come', 'mouth', 'nutshell', 'precisely', 'what', 'Howard', 'great', 'Rather', 'foul-mouthed', 'shockmeister', 'Howard', 'really', 'voice', 'silenced', 'group', 'people', 'most', 'interact', 'day', 'not', 'voice', 'left-leaning', 'Hollywood', 'politically', 'correct', 'poster', 'children.Instead', 'Howard', 'vocal', 'mouthpiece', 'random', 'Joe', 'who', 'secretly', 'sex', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'straddling', 'fence', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'opinions', 'ultimately', 'obsessively', 'concerned', 'weight', 'body', 'functions', 'world', 'around', 'Stern', 'stream', 'conscious', 'window', 'inner', 'minds', 'complicated', 'middle', 'Americans', 'who', 'voted', 'Bush', 'made', 'Bay', 'Watch', 'must-see', 'TV', 'who', 'day', 'continue', 'baffle', 'exit-pollers.', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",Private Parts VHS

This film shows how he got to that spot, taking us through the process by which he discovered what people really wanted to hear, and the challenges he faced along the way. You really do not need to be a fan of Stern to appreciate this funny and informative movie. And let's get real; when Stern was on free radio, a lot of those that hated him listened to him even more than those that liked him. As they put it in the movie, haters also wanted to know what he was going to say next!I was really surprised to see how good a job Howard did with his acting, and Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, who  also play their real personas in the film, did not lag behind at all. This trio delivers laughs-a-plenty, and shows why so many people love them. The bit in which they use the fill-in the blank competition is priceless, and will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Especially when you see Kenny (pig vomit), the program director at NBC, go berserk over what he was hearing on air. I have to stop here and comment on how Giamatti, who played the role of ""pig vomit"", shows his great skills for acting, and you can see that he had those skills way before his success with ""Sideways"".The film portrays Stern's wife, Allison, as his muse and object of desire. Everything he does is for her. Too bad they got divorced following this production, but this does not spoil any of the fun. If you are looking to have a good time, with some politically incorrect and over-the-top humor, and do not mind a little nudity, you have a winner in this one.",4,"Can't miss this, whether you are a fan or not",1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,1631,"['debate', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'dominated', 'radio', 'market', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'film', 'how', 'got', 'spot', 'taking', 'process', 'discovered', 'what', 'people', 'really', 'wanted', 'hear', 'challenges', 'faced', 'way', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'fan', 'Stern', 'appreciate', 'funny', 'informative', 'movie', 'let', 'get', 'real', 'when', 'Stern', 'was', 'free', 'radio', 'lot', 'hated', 'listened', 'even', 'more', 'liked', 'put', 'movie', 'haters', 'also', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'next', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'job', 'Howard', 'did', 'acting', 'Robin', 'Quivers', 'Fred', 'Norris', 'who', 'also', 'play', 'real', 'personas', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'lag', 'trio', 'laughs-a-plenty', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'bit', 'use', 'fill-in', 'blank', 'competition', 'priceless', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'Especially', 'when', 'see', 'Kenny', 'pig', 'vomit', 'program', 'director', 'NBC', 'go', 'berserk', 'what', 'was', 'hearing', 'air', 'have', 'stop', 'here', 'comment', 'how', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'pig', 'vomit', 'great', 'skills', 'acting', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'skills', 'way', 'success', 'Sideways', '.The', 'film', 'Stern', 'wife', 'Allison', 'muse', 'object', 'desire', 'Everything', 'Too', 'bad', 'got', 'divorced', 'following', 'production', 'not', 'spoil', 'fun', 'are', 'looking', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'over-the-top', 'humor', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'little', 'nudity', 'have', 'winner', 'one']",Private Parts VHS

Who is both of those people? Why,of course,BOTH of those honors go to Howard Stern. I'll admit it,I think Stern is hillarious,and he is my favorite radio disc jockey. Stern's humor may affend some people,and maybe sometimes it does go a little overboard,but jokes like Fartman and some of his jokes that he tends to make on his radio show(and usually gets in trouble for)are plain and flat out hillarious. If You're offended by Howard Stern and you're thinking about giving him a try,then listen to his show first or read one of his books before you come anywhere close to this movie. But if You're not offended by Howard Stern and you happen to be a huge fan of his,then read on for my review of this and then make the decision to whether or not you want to buy/rent this movie:This movie takes a look at Howard Stern's whole life from his childhood to up about 1994-1996. It is pretty funny. It opens up with showing what happened when Stern did his hillarious ""Fartman"" act on national TV,and throughout the rest of this movie,you get to see what his childhood and his high school years were like and what motivated him to go to college(Boston University)and became a radio DJ,and this movie also covers his personal life outside of his radio show,which is another reason for why this film is so interesting.But of course,this film also covers the shocking things Howard Stern did back then and probably still does today not only in his life,but also on his radio show,and those scenes are 100 percent hillarious with not one exception,no matter how shocking they are. I really enjoyed the scene where Stern and that one lady(this really did happen on Stern's show once)had sex over the radio,and it was also cool to see AC/DC make a guest apperance towards the end of this film.This movie is something that is definitely worth checking out,if You're a fan of either Howard Stern,radio,or,of course,fun and juvenile humor. I hear that Stern is not going to be doing any more work for Infinity Broadcasting as of January 1,2006 and will be doing his show in an apartment in New York(Manhattan)so I'll definitely have to keep listening to his show when he is doing it over Satellite Radio-it will really suck that all of Stern's fans who still want to listen to him are going to have to pay money just to hear Stern's show off of a Satellite,but it will be interesting to see what Stern's show is like then and if it degrades or is more funny than his radio broadcasts that he is currently doing for Infinity.Time and money well,well,well,well,well,well,well,well,well spent-I have this movie on VHS,but I'm definitely going to have to get it on DVD.A funny and shocking look at America's ""Love Him or Hate Him""disc jockey-Howard Stern.",5,One of the funniest movies I have EVER seen,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2896,"['America', 'one', 'radio', 'disc', 'jockey', 'people', 'think', 'hillarious', 'one', 'radio', 'disc', 'jockey', 'who', 'controversial', 'several', 'people', 'Who', 'people', 'Why', 'course', 'BOTH', 'honors', 'go', 'Howard', 'Stern', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'think', 'Stern', 'hillarious', 'favorite', 'radio', 'disc', 'jockey', 'Stern', 'humor', 'may', 'affend', 'people', 'maybe', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'jokes', 'Fartman', 'jokes', 'make', 'radio', 'show', 'usually', 'trouble', 'are', 'plain', 'flat', 'out', 'hillarious', ""'re"", 'offended', 'Howard', 'Stern', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'giving', 'try', 'then', 'show', 'first', 'read', 'one', 'books', 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'offended', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'happen', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'then', 'read', 'review', 'then', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'want', 'buy/rent', 'movie', 'movie', 'look', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'whole', 'life', 'childhood', 'up', '1994-1996', 'pretty', 'funny', 'up', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'Stern', 'did', 'hillarious', 'Fartman', 'act', 'national', 'TV', 'rest', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'childhood', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'were', 'what', 'motivated', 'go', 'college', 'Boston', 'University', 'became', 'radio', 'DJ', 'movie', 'also', 'personal', 'life', 'radio', 'show', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'interesting.But', 'course', 'film', 'also', 'shocking', 'things', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'probably', 'still', 'today', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'also', 'radio', 'show', 'scenes', 'are', '100', 'percent', 'hillarious', 'not', 'one', 'exception', 'matter', 'how', 'shocking', 'are', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'where', 'Stern', 'one', 'lady', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'Stern', 'show', 'once', 'had', 'sex', 'radio', 'was', 'also', 'cool', 'see', 'AC/DC', 'make', 'guest', 'apperance', 'end', 'film.This', 'movie', 'something', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'radio', 'course', 'fun', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'hear', 'Stern', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'work', 'Infinity', 'Broadcasting', 'January', '1,2006', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'show', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'Manhattan', 'so', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'have', 'keep', 'listening', 'show', 'when', 'doing', 'Satellite', 'Radio-it', 'will', 'really', 'suck', 'Stern', 'fans', 'who', 'still', 'want', 'listen', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'pay', 'money', 'just', 'hear', 'Stern', 'show', 'Satellite', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'Stern', 'show', 'then', 'more', 'funny', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'currently', 'doing', 'Infinity.Time', 'money', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'spent-I', 'have', 'movie', 'VHS', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'going', 'have', 'get', 'DVD.A', 'funny', 'shocking', 'look', 'America', 'Love', 'Him', 'Hate', 'Him', 'disc', 'jockey-Howard', 'Stern']",Private Parts VHS

And his radio crew also appears as themselves, as including his newsroom/side kick Robin Quivers. Howard Stern spent his entire childhood hearing from his father (Richard Portnow) that he is a moron, and one day out of the whole year he would go to work with his father who worked as an engineer in a radio station, which leads him to the decision of working on the radio, and even perfoms his own puppet shows. But he didn't begin his radio carrer until his senior year in college. In high school, he was the only white kid, in a school attended by the blacks, and only went on his first date in college, mostly because girls would turn him down on dates. And then he mets the girl that becomes his future wife, and her name is Alison (Mary McCormack). In 1981, he was hired by a radio station, where he was paired for the first time by newswoman Robin Quivers, that would become his long time newswoman and sidekick, and even when she gets fired from her job, Howard vows her that he will and she of course feels that she was breyed. He gets a new newsman, and he does whatever he can until the new guy gets tired and says he doesn't want to work with him anymore, along with servel other people, and so Robin Qiuvers is re-hired for the job. And then WNBC ratiung drop, the mange to lure him over to the station, and Kenny ""Pig Vomit"" (Paul Giamatti) is the progrtam director over there, and he voulneers to try to tame Howard. Also seen in the movie are Fred Norris, Jackie Martling, and Howard Stern's producer Gary Dell'Abate  also appears in the movie.

It basically summarizes his childhood and early years and shows us some of his influences to become a radio personality.  Most of the movie is a flashback panning his lifetime as he moves from small town disc-jockey to well-known local personality to huge radio star.  He meets many of his sidekicks and good friends throughout the movie, such as Robin Quivers, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling.  Unfortunately, the flashback cuts off in the mid-80's and doesn't touch at the next ten years of his career.

I'm here to talk about this movie PRIVATE PARTS. This movie was on TV last night, and though it was heavily edited, it was just what I needed to watch.The story that is told here is one about doing what you feel is necessary, no matter who, or what force tries to cut you down. The movie is important for this reason. Sometimes we forget we are right, when EVERYBODY tells us we are wrong! The message is to keep fighting for what you believe in. If the results of your struggle are hillarious, well then thats an added bonus.Theres more happening for this movie than just STERNs potty humor, so don't let the leading role deter you. Although there is a bit (heh heh) for good measure. (Lots of boobs)The supporting roles are all great, Mary Mcormack as his wife, Robin Quivers, and Fred Norris as themselves (and Jackie The Joke Man, who is GREAT for the five minutes he's in the movie). Then Paul Giamatti, who plays Pig Vomit. He's a great comic actor, but you have to hate him in this one, his character anyway. Without that animosity towards him, this movie would never have worked as good as it did. ""W-eeeeN-Bee-Ceee""So, enough said, heres the basic gist of this thing. Howard Stern grows up an awkward kid, eventually he breaks into radio but struggles for a while, until he gets big on a D.C radio station, and then gets picked up by the big boys at NBC. Here is where the major conflicts arise between Stern and Pig Vomit. Pig Vomit wants to make him sorry he ever took the job at NBC, and really wants him to quit (The station can't fire him because of breach to the contract.) The war begins and ends, I won't tell you how. You can probably guess. AC/DC joins him on stage at the end and ROCKS Central Park! Thats just the icing on the cake right there.This movie will make you laugh even if you don't like Howard. It will probably soften you up to him if you are a straight out hater.

This movie on it's face is a great story about a one time nerds battle with the radio industrys  management to do his style of radio. Sterns movie is an autobiograpical  look at his life in front and behind the scenes. Whether or not your a fan  you can't help but relate to his triumphs and tribulations. This movie is  not only about the radio business, it's about the unwillingness of  corporate america to handle unproven change. Mary Mc Cormack plays Allison,  Stern's supportive wife and she fairs well as a confidant who at times  can't help but be affected by her husbands on air personal actions. Robin  Quivers recaptures her memorable moments well enough with Stern as does  Fred Norris. Howard tries to display his humble side and even till this day  proves that he can stay unaffected during his on air promotion of the  seductive women who may have never noticed him. In my opinion Howard Stern  is an enigma with a special quality of intelligence. He may not credit his  family enough in this movie but he does Allison. For if it wasn't for their  support Howard just might have failed at bringing Comedic Talk radio to  it's present state of success. Howard you have lived to prove there is  radio life beyond music and it doesn't have to be dialogue about  Republicans!",5,Stern gives away his Privacy,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,1411,"['man', 'radio', 'program', 'directors', 'thought', 'had', 'talent', 'least', 'part', '1', 'extaordinary', 'life', 'film', 'movie', 'face', 'great', 'story', 'one', 'time', 'nerds', 'battle', 'radio', 'industrys', 'management', 'do', 'style', 'radio', 'Sterns', 'movie', 'autobiograpical', 'look', 'life', 'front', 'scenes', 'Whether', 'not', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'relate', 'triumphs', 'tribulations', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'radio', 'business', 'unwillingness', 'corporate', 'america', 'handle', 'unproven', 'change', 'Mary', 'Mc', 'Cormack', 'Allison', 'Stern', 'supportive', 'wife', 'fairs', 'well', 'confidant', 'who', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'affected', 'husbands', 'air', 'personal', 'actions', 'Robin', 'Quivers', 'memorable', 'moments', 'well', 'enough', 'Stern', 'Fred', 'Norris', 'Howard', 'display', 'humble', 'side', 'even', 'till', 'day', 'can', 'stay', 'unaffected', 'air', 'promotion', 'seductive', 'women', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'noticed', 'opinion', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'enigma', 'special', 'quality', 'intelligence', 'may', 'not', 'credit', 'family', 'enough', 'movie', 'Allison', 'was', ""n't"", 'support', 'Howard', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'failed', 'bringing', 'Comedic', 'Talk', 'radio', 'present', 'state', 'success', 'Howard', 'have', 'lived', 'prove', 'radio', 'life', 'music', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'dialogue', 'Republicans']",Private Parts VHS
