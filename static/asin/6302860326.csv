341176,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302860326,Andrew Ellington,"[12, 14]","I am a huge fan of ambiguity; honestly, for I think that a movie that moves you to question what you think you know is beyond important.  It challenges our views of certainty and challenges us to contemplate a reality different than the one we have already accepted as definite.  Because of this I can't really come down too hard on `Agnes of God' for trying to be just that.  Sadly, the film doesn't fully accomplish the task, but it is a valiant effort at least.The film revolves around a young nun, Sister Agnes, who violently gives birth to a child and then murders the baby.  Psychologist Dr. Martha Livingston is given the task of determining whether or not Agnes is crazy, but in order to get to Agnes she has to go through the overly protective Mother Miriam Ruth.  Martha has her own quorums with faith and religion that move her to butt-heads with Mother Miriam, but it is apparent that both want what is best for Agnes, they just both see a different answer to the question of `what is best'.I'm yelling SPOILERS even though I don't really think that they are.The problem I have with this particular films ambiguities is that they don't really validate themselves.  We are meant to believe that there are two viable options to Agnes's conception; namely that she was unfaithful to god by having relations with a man, or that she was divinely impregnated.  Dr. Livingston looks at things logically while Mother Miriam is insistent that the child was a child of god.  The mere fact that the birth resulted in the murder of a child somewhat disputes Mother Miriam's whole argument and thus leaves the audience conflicted, for they want to embrace to possibility but are unable to, for accepting it would seem morally wrong; as if to admit that god would choose such an unstable vessel.  The film also never backs up its claims with any real weight.  It never gives us explanations as to why we should keep our options open.  These few plot holes leave the ending more absolute than ambiguous, which then just comes out overly frustrated because they refuse to tie up the loose ends that they have created.However off balance the films construction and or script was, there is no denying the fact that the performances within are beyond superb.I am not a huge fan of Jane Fonda's style of acting.  It seems almost too methodic, as if she is really thinking too hard.  This comes across more here than it does in some of her other work.  That said, she is effective and at times moving, but she is not the `superb' part I was talking about.  No, it is Anne Bancroft and Meg Tilly who sum up my feelings on the films performances, and they sum them up with grace and power.  Both actresses were Oscar nominated, and rightfully so (although I tend to think BOTH actress should have been in the `Supporting Actress' category).  Bancroft plays Mother Miriam, the stern and matronly caretaker to young Agnes.  Her beliefs are strong and they play a huge role in her approach to the situation at hand.  She comes across cold and bitter yet she is at heart very loving and sincere.  Meg Tilly is even more impressive as Agnes, capturing her jaded innocence with such heart and soul.  We can see her suffering below the surface while she attempts to create a person filled with the grace of god.In the end I can say that `Agnes of God' is a good film, but it fails to become the great film it was trying to be.  I heard that the inconsistencies within the film are also present in the stage play from which this was spawned, and that is a shame.  If only a few areas were tightened up then this would be a masterpiece.",3,If only the possibilities were as richly convincing as the performances...,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,3616,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'ambiguity', 'honestly', 'think', 'movie', 'question', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'important', 'views', 'certainty', 'contemplate', 'reality', 'different', 'one', 'have', 'already', 'accepted', 'definite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'down', 'too', 'hard', 'Agnes', 'God', 'trying', 'be', 'just', 'Sadly', 'film', ""n't"", 'fully', 'accomplish', 'task', 'valiant', 'effort', 'least.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'young', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'who', 'violently', 'birth', 'child', 'then', 'baby', 'Psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Martha', 'Livingston', 'given', 'task', 'determining', 'not', 'Agnes', 'crazy', 'order', 'get', 'Agnes', 'go', 'overly', 'protective', 'Mother', 'Miriam', 'Ruth', 'Martha', 'own', 'quorums', 'faith', 'religion', 'move', 'butt-heads', 'Mother', 'Miriam', 'apparent', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'Agnes', 'just', 'see', 'different', 'answer', 'question', 'what', ""best'.I"", ""'m"", 'yelling', 'SPOILERS', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'are.The', 'problem', 'have', 'particular', 'films', 'ambiguities', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'validate', 'are', 'meant', 'believe', 'are', 'two', 'viable', 'options', 'Agnes', 'conception', 'namely', 'was', 'unfaithful', 'god', 'having', 'relations', 'man', 'was', 'divinely', 'impregnated', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'things', 'logically', 'Mother', 'Miriam', 'insistent', 'child', 'was', 'child', 'god', 'mere', 'fact', 'birth', 'resulted', 'murder', 'child', 'somewhat', 'Mother', 'Miriam', 'whole', 'argument', 'thus', 'audience', 'conflicted', 'want', 'embrace', 'possibility', 'are', 'unable', 'accepting', 'would', 'seem', 'morally', 'wrong', 'admit', 'god', 'would', 'choose', 'such', 'unstable', 'vessel', 'film', 'also', 'never', 'up', 'claims', 'real', 'weight', 'never', 'explanations', 'why', 'should', 'keep', 'options', 'open', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'leave', 'ending', 'more', 'absolute', 'ambiguous', 'then', 'just', 'out', 'overly', 'frustrated', 'refuse', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'have', 'created.However', 'off', 'balance', 'films', 'construction', 'script', 'was', 'denying', 'fact', 'performances', 'are', 'superb.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'style', 'acting', 'almost', 'too', 'methodic', 'really', 'thinking', 'too', 'hard', 'more', 'here', 'other', 'work', 'said', 'effective', 'times', 'moving', 'not', 'superb', 'part', 'was', 'talking', 'No', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'who', 'sum', 'up', 'feelings', 'films', 'performances', 'sum', 'up', 'grace', 'power', 'actresses', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'rightfully', 'so', 'tend', 'think', 'BOTH', 'actress', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'category', 'Bancroft', 'Mother', 'Miriam', 'stern', 'matronly', 'caretaker', 'young', 'Agnes', 'beliefs', 'are', 'strong', 'play', 'huge', 'role', 'approach', 'situation', 'hand', 'cold', 'bitter', 'yet', 'heart', 'very', 'loving', 'sincere', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'Agnes', 'capturing', 'jaded', 'innocence', 'such', 'heart', 'soul', 'can', 'see', 'suffering', 'surface', 'create', 'person', 'filled', 'grace', 'god.In', 'end', 'can', 'say', 'Agnes', 'God', 'good', 'film', 'become', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'heard', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'spawned', 'shame', 'only', 'few', 'areas', 'were', 'tightened', 'up', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'masterpiece']",N/A

And Meg Tilly's portrayal of the young nun, Agnes, makes for triple-play brilliance.  Call me logical, but I really would have liked to know how Agnes, the young, emotionally fragile novice in a Catholic convent (who had been abused by her cigarette-wielding mother) became pregnant with the infant she birthed and smothered in her nun's cell.  The tale of a ""him"" and his feathered wings coming to this enraptured young girl was an obvious allusion to the Christian Bible's version of Jesus' conception by the holy spirit's visitation to Mary.  I don't believe the older version, and Norman Jewison's version is no more convincing.

341181,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,6302860326,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[13, 15]","Director Norman Jewison adapted the Broadway play of the same name with an A list of performers who, despite their individual and combined magnificent talents, can't quite salvage what might be to some a disappointing resolution. Still, getting there is a provocative odyssey in defining the fine line between divine faith and science. In a usually engaging performance, Jane Fonda is a chain-smoking psychiatrist in a French-speaking Canadian territory and is appointed by the Crown to evaluate the mental stability of a novice nun, Agnes (brilliantly played by Meg Tilley in an Oscar-nominated supporting role) who gives birth and then kills her newborn in her blood-spattered convent room. Soon, with Agnes proclaiming Immaculate Conception and virgin birth, the film's premise of faith vs. science vs. rape is laid. All too soon, Fonda clashes with the protective but domineering Mother Superior (Ann Bancroft, also in an Oscar-nominated turn). With the Crown dubious about Agnes' version of how she got pregnant, it nonetheless wants the case quickly adjudicated so as not to create a battered public image associated with prosecuting a nun. Along the way, we learn that the strain between Fonda and Bancroft is the former's rejection of the Catholic faith stems from the former's bad experience with a sister during childhood. Still, the focus is on the extent of human faith and its sometimes incompatibility with science. All three actress - Fonda, Bancroft and Tilley - are captivating in their adverse positions with each other in the argument of Science vs. God. The film's resolution is consistent with contemporary dogma and leaves us somewhat puzzled but more disturbed by its hint that faith may not be enough to salvage ourselves. Then again, maybe there's not supposed to be a happily-ever-after or comfortable absolution: after all, even with the strongest of faith, not everything ends happily ever after. Nonetheless, ""Agnes of God"" remains a tantilizing film that entices its viewers to question and reaffirm their faith and whether it can survive the invasion of skepticism that comes in the name op science. Beyond that, as an entertainment piece, ""Anges of God"" is a showpiece for its three lead characters, and watching them finding the answer none of them wants is a worthy watch.",4,A collsion of science with faith,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,2306,"['Director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'adapted', 'Broadway', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'A', 'list', 'performers', 'who', 'individual', 'combined', 'magnificent', 'talents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'salvage', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'disappointing', 'resolution', 'Still', 'getting', 'provocative', 'odyssey', 'defining', 'fine', 'line', 'divine', 'faith', 'science', 'usually', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'chain-smoking', 'psychiatrist', 'French-speaking', 'Canadian', 'territory', 'appointed', 'Crown', 'evaluate', 'mental', 'stability', 'novice', 'nun', 'Agnes', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Meg', 'Tilley', 'Oscar-nominated', 'supporting', 'role', 'who', 'birth', 'then', 'newborn', 'blood-spattered', 'convent', 'room', 'Soon', 'Agnes', 'proclaiming', 'Immaculate', 'Conception', 'virgin', 'birth', 'film', 'premise', 'faith', 'vs.', 'science', 'vs.', 'rape', 'laid', 'too', 'soon', 'Fonda', 'protective', 'domineering', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Ann', 'Bancroft', 'also', 'Oscar-nominated', 'turn', 'Crown', 'dubious', 'Agnes', 'version', 'how', 'got', 'pregnant', 'nonetheless', 'case', 'quickly', 'adjudicated', 'so', 'not', 'create', 'battered', 'public', 'image', 'associated', 'prosecuting', 'nun', 'way', 'learn', 'strain', 'Fonda', 'Bancroft', 'former', 'rejection', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'former', 'bad', 'experience', 'sister', 'childhood', 'Still', 'focus', 'extent', 'human', 'faith', 'sometimes', 'incompatibility', 'science', 'three', 'actress', 'Fonda', 'Bancroft', 'Tilley', 'are', 'captivating', 'adverse', 'positions', 'other', 'argument', 'Science', 'vs.', 'God', 'film', 'resolution', 'consistent', 'contemporary', 'dogma', 'somewhat', 'puzzled', 'more', 'disturbed', 'hint', 'faith', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'salvage', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'happily-ever-after', 'comfortable', 'absolution', 'even', 'strongest', 'faith', 'not', 'everything', 'happily', 'ever', 'Nonetheless', 'Agnes', 'God', 'tantilizing', 'film', 'viewers', 'question', 'reaffirm', 'faith', 'can', 'survive', 'invasion', 'skepticism', 'name', 'op', 'science', 'Beyond', 'entertainment', 'piece', 'Anges', 'God', 'showpiece', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'watching', 'finding', 'answer', 'none', 'worthy', 'watch']",N/A

Wonderfully acted, the three dynamo actresses of this film explore faith, miracles, mental illness, abuse, and survival.  Each woman is given a well developed character, each with her own past, secrets, and beliefs.The dynamic characters clash in devastating moment when Agnes, a novice nun, is found seriously ill.  She has just given birth alone, and the infant is dead in a waste basket.  As disturbing as this initial scene is, it is nothing compared to the rest of the traumas this film exposes.  Is Agnes is crazy?  Is she a liar and a very convincing actress?  Is she a saint and the vessel of a miracle in this all too modern and secular world?  Each possibility is explored in this film, with little resolution (in my opinion).The beauty, and madness, of this film is that as uncertain as faith is, so is the ending.  The ending depends on what you believe.  One aspect I thought about later was how the ""ungodliness"" of some people, or of society, make miracles impossible.  Maybe Agnes is a saint, but what she endured in the secular world made that saintliness impossible to sustain.  Or is her ""sainthood"" a defense mechanism used to escape a hostile world?  Or maybe she just has bats in the belfry?  You decide based on the heartbreaking script that is well acted and beautifully film.

341189,A25FDX17O3QKLT,6302860326,Hallstatt Prince,"[14, 16]","This is an interesting film  that raises the questions  as to whether miracles still exist in the modern world. The movie and play were criticized  by  some  as  being an  attack on  Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. Catholics have a good reason to be wary of broadsides  from  popular culture but sometimes these condemnations take the form of a knee jerk reaction. I for one found the movie a good debate about religion and spirituality and I found the movie to be highly moving and faith affirming.The story concerns a young novitiate in a secluded convent in Canada  who becomes pregnant and whose baby is killed.The government is put in a difficult  position  since even though Canada  has a large Catholic  population a crime has been committed which must be investigated.Jane Fonda, in one of her best roles, plays the  neurotic psychiatrist Martha Livingstone who is sent to investigate the incident. The psychiatrist is not completely objective as she is what some might call ""a fallen Catholic"", someone who has unfortunately been harmed by religion. And she has an ax to grind.Her nemesis (although ""nemesis might be too strong of a word) is  the mother superior of the convent played by Anne Bancroft. Her performance  is also magnificent. Although  the  mother superior  obstructs the investigation some of the most interesting dialogue about faith is between the psychiatrist and the mother superior. Both women  almost more  interested in Agnes to justify their own vocations and points of view as they are about getting to the truth.Dr. Livingstone believe Agnes should be allowed to leave the convent and become an independent  woman with as much religious zelotry as the mother superior demonstrates in wanting Agnes to remain  at the convent.By far the most interesting character is  the nun who bore the child. She is played by Meg Tilly to perfection. She portrays a nun whose innocence is  like that of a child.We come to learn the mother superior has her reasons  for covering up some of the facts of the case, the main one  being that the innocent novitiate is the niece of the mother superior.To the shock of Dr. Livingstone Agnes  sometimes  demonstrates  stigmata (for those of you who do not believe in stigmata it is a fairly well documented  phenomena -whether it is a miracle and  proof of the existence of God is a matter of debate).The high point of the film comes when  Agnes is hypnotized. Beautiful cinematography and special effects  gives  a moving picture of what Agnes experienced.At the end of the movie we are left to draw our own conclusions.A very moving and thought provoking film.Highly recommended.Jim Connell  ""Hallstatt Prince""",5,An interesting debate about  faith and the miraculous,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,2697,"['interesting', 'film', 'questions', 'miracles', 'still', 'exist', 'modern', 'world', 'movie', 'play', 'were', 'criticized', 'being', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'general', 'Catholicism', 'particular', 'Catholics', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'wary', 'broadsides', 'popular', 'culture', 'sometimes', 'condemnations', 'take', 'form', 'knee', 'jerk', 'reaction', 'one', 'found', 'movie', 'good', 'debate', 'religion', 'spirituality', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'highly', 'moving', 'faith', 'affirming.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'young', 'novitiate', 'secluded', 'convent', 'Canada', 'who', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'killed.The', 'government', 'put', 'difficult', 'position', 'even', 'Canada', 'large', 'Catholic', 'population', 'crime', 'been', 'committed', 'must', 'be', 'investigated.Jane', 'Fonda', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'neurotic', 'psychiatrist', 'Martha', 'Livingstone', 'who', 'sent', 'investigate', 'incident', 'psychiatrist', 'not', 'completely', 'objective', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'fallen', 'Catholic', 'someone', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'harmed', 'religion', 'ax', 'grind.Her', 'nemesis', 'nemesis', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'mother', 'superior', 'convent', 'played', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'performance', 'also', 'magnificent', 'mother', 'superior', 'investigation', 'most', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'faith', 'psychiatrist', 'mother', 'superior', 'women', 'almost', 'more', 'interested', 'Agnes', 'justify', 'own', 'vocations', 'points', 'view', 'are', 'getting', 'truth.Dr', 'Livingstone', 'believe', 'Agnes', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'leave', 'convent', 'become', 'independent', 'woman', 'as', 'much', 'religious', 'zelotry', 'mother', 'superior', 'demonstrates', 'wanting', 'Agnes', 'remain', 'convent.By', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'nun', 'who', 'bore', 'child', 'played', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'perfection', 'nun', 'innocence', 'child.We', 'come', 'learn', 'mother', 'superior', 'reasons', 'covering', 'up', 'facts', 'case', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'innocent', 'novitiate', 'niece', 'mother', 'superior.To', 'shock', 'Dr.', 'Livingstone', 'Agnes', 'sometimes', 'stigmata', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'stigmata', 'fairly', 'well', 'documented', 'phenomena', 'miracle', 'proof', 'existence', 'God', 'matter', 'debate', '.The', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Agnes', 'hypnotized', 'Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'moving', 'picture', 'what', 'Agnes', 'experienced.At', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.A', 'very', 'moving', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film.Highly', 'recommended.Jim', 'Connell', 'Hallstatt', 'Prince']",N/A

The case has caused a scandal, and both the Church and Court want it resolved as quickly as possible.  But when Fonda begins questioning the young nun, Meg Tilly, and her Mother Superior, Anne Bancroft, it becomes clear that things are much more complicated than they would appear.  The film raises a lot of questions about miracles, Catholic dogma, and failings of the Church.  It also taps into that sense of secrecy in the Catholic Church, since so much happens behind close doors and in quiet, whether it be behind the walls of a convent or even the Vatican, or inside the small space of a confessional.  It doesn't answer a lot of the questions it poses, and in a certain sense, the ending was not completely satisfying.  But there's a lot to compensate for it.  The performances are quite good.  Anne Bancroft comes off best, with her stubborn, blunt Mother Superior trying to protect the young novice.  Meg Tilly is also wonderful as the innocent, enigmatic nun.  Jane Fonda is a bit one-note as the doctor, having a few good scenes along the way.  Director Norman Jewison creates a mood and atmosphere in the film that compliments the subject matter well.

AGNES OF GOD, released in 1985, is a picture for which the same might be said.Meg Tilly stars as a young woman who's recently given birth to, and apparently murdered, her baby. No surprise there, except that she also happens to be a young nun, Sister Agnes, tightly cloistered in a French Canadian convent. Agnes has no memory of the deed, so Jane Fonda plays the court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Livingston, tasked with unearthing the facts of the matter. Who was the biological father? How did he breach the convent's walls to gain access to Agnes and impregnate her? What were the circumstances of the birth and killing? Anne Bancroft plays the head of the religious house, who apparently knows more than she's telling. Livingston won't be stopped, and the Mother Superior is indomitable. It's a case of the Irresistible Force meeting the Immovable Object.All three actresses give exceptional performances in a film that pivots around two key  elements of Catholicism, the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception and the Virgin Birth, as well as the phenomenon of the Stigmata. There's even a lighter moment as the Fonda and Bancroft characters discuss what sort of cigar might have been the favorite of certain of the Apostles. (Can you envision Peter smoking a big stogie?)It's been argued that the picture, while undeniably excellent, was ultimately unsatisfying. I think such a conclusion misses the point, which is that some things, like the Immaculate Conception and the Virgin Birth, will never be proven facts, but must be accepted on faith by those so inclined. And, not all movie endings are necessarily tidy, nor should they be.

Another review will be written when I get the DVD.A very suspenseful movie with a mystery twist, 1985's Agnes of God stars Jane Fonda, Anne Bancroft, and Meg Tilly. A young nun, Sister Agnes (Tilly) gives birth to a baby girl in her convent room on the 3rd floor, but virtually has no knowledge of being pregnant and having the baby. Jane Fonda plays Dr. Martha Livingston, the psychiatrist who is appointed by the court to talk to Agnes and get whatever details she can get regarding the case (and being nagged by her colleagues for taking too long to resolve it). But, the case seems to drag on for a certain period of time, as Dr. Livingston tries to unscramble the mystery of the situation. Anne Bancroft plays the Mother Superior Miriam Ruth, who doesn't approve of Dr. Livingston's works of psychiatry. This movie's story is kind of strange as Agnes acts as though the pregnancy never happened in her life. Her behavior at first seems to give viewers the impression that she knows nothing about sex, pregnancy, what causes pregnancy, the physical difference between men and women (this obviously means that she never even took a sex ed class in school or that her mother didn't have a talk with her about the subject of sex), etc. Questions in this story that are never answered are: Who was the father of the baby? and How did a man get into the convent and have sex with Agnes? There are some disturbing details about Agnes' background in this movie, such as being molested by her mother and being made fun of, and saying that her mother ""watches and listens"". The blood scenes were very haunting and scary. The hypnosis scenes were frightening and dramatic as well. The final ruling in the court reveals that she was in no manner responsible for her actions that night. Very suspenseful movie and Norman Jewison did a great job directing it. Bancroft, Fonda, and Tilly were all excellent in their roles as well. Will get the DVD soon!!

My mom told me that was a movie for adults, so it always had some intregue for me.  Now that I am an adult (ha ha ha), it holds just as many questions and just as much mystery.Jane Fonda plays Dr. Livingston, a court appointed psychiatrist who has been called in to investigate a mysterious murder case.  A young woman has given birth and apparently killed her baby soon after.  The young woman was Sister Agnes, a novice at a French Canadian convent.  She has no memory of the event, and the Mother Superior is bent on keeping others out.  She and Dr. Livingston would clash several times.  Dr. Livingston is the voice of reason, the realist, the one who is determined to find the answers and a perfectly reasonable explination for everything.  Mother Superior is the one who has put her faith in God, trusting enough to leave some things alone to that of the whims of fate.  And Agnes, sweet, innocent little Agnes is at the center of it all.In the conversations Dr. Livinston has with Agnes, we find that she is innocent but hiding an abusive past.  She doesn't understand many things about the world, and that she had been locked in this convent all her life she had no means in which to learn.  Why would she?  This is the place where she is finding happiness away from her abusive past.  This is hard for Dr. Livingston to accept, why any young woman would want to be a nun and live this way.  Dr. Livingston has her own problems, and perhaps she wants to atone for her own mistakes by finding and answer.  We also find out that Mother Superior is not so innocent either.  She did not become a nun until later in life, had once been married, and choose to leave the world that Dr. Livingston comes from.  It is reveiled that Agnes is the Mother Superior's niece, and that she suspected that Agnes was pregnant to the point that she put a waste basket in her room for her to dispose of the child once it was born.  Mother Superior also wants to protect Agnes and keep others out from disrupting their quest for spiritual realization.  Naturally, there will be clashes.And under hypnosis, we hear about the night Agnes's child was conceived.  Per the instruction of a dying elderly nun, Sister Paul (who Agnes also said saw the mysterious man) tells her to go to the secret passage behind a statue of St. Michael in the basement.  Agnes follows the passage and goes to the barn, where she would meet HIM.  From there she cannot describe what happened.  She says she saw him from her window in the field everynight and he sang a beautiful song to her, so she knew him.  *Shudder*What fascinated me the most about this movie was the fact that Agnes was a true innocent, and as one she really did not know where babies come from, and it calls upon your faith which you thought was long since dead.  So who was the father?  If you believe in science, it was a man.  If you believe in faith, it was God.  These are the only two answers possible.  But, we will never know.  But it just can't be, your rational side says to you.  Yet, you hear Agnes's side of the story under hypnosis and you will always wonder, plus hearing her sing the song that her mysterious midnight visitor would sing to her.  Even in this day and age, there are some that are truly blessed with the ability to communicate with the spiritual world.

Not that there's anything really wrong with John Pielmier's award-winning play or its adaptation for film--in fact, most of it is quite literate.  But what elevates the film to near-greatness is the work of Norman Jewison, probably one of America's most underrated directors, and the inspired casting of Jane Fonda and Anne Bancroft, two of the world's great actresses, and the brilliant, Oscar-nominated (and Golden Globe-winning) performance of Meg Tilly as the beset young novice.Fonda is simply great (though probably miscast) as the psychiatrist trying to unravel the secrets of Agnes and her convent, receiving little help from the Mother Superior (Bancroft, also Oscar-nominated as Best Actress) or her colleagues, who simply want a quick, dismissable verdict to a non &quot;p. c.&quot; court case.  Fonda's character has some demons of her own to fight along the way (including a church-disavowed abortion and a sister who died in a convent), but so, we find out, does Bancroft's character.  The convergence of these events answer some of the questions surrounding the birth, while leaving others appropriately open to speculation (like religion itself).The direction and cinematography create a real feeling of cloister and serenity, and the lovely music by veteran Georges Delerue also contributes to the haunting effect of the movie.

Norman Jewison's film adaptation, nominated for three Oscars, is a fantastic translation featuring two established stars and one on the rise who should have been a household name after this. Everything about it points to the term ""modern classic"". So why is it that twenty-five years later, the movie has faded into obscurity? I don't know, but sometimes it seems to happen in order for people to rediscover it and make it into the classic it deserves to be later on. At least, that's what I hope is going on here.The film opens with a gruesome discovery: the body of an infant and bloody towels in the trash can of a young Catholic novitiate, Sister Agnes (Psycho II's Meg Tilly). Agnes contends the birth was miraculous, but the police aren't buying it. They send in Martha Livingston (On Golden Pond's Jane Fonda), a psychologist, to find out whether Agnes is insane; on the other side of the equation is Miriam Ruth (Blazing Saddles' Anne Bancroft), the mother superior of Agnes' convent. As the two of them dance around, Agnes almost fades into the background of the dance between Miriam and Martha, antagonists who come to grudgingly respect one another.All this true, perhaps, and yet despite both of her co-stars being stalwarts (at the time the film was made, Fonda had already won two Oscars and been nominated for a handful more, while Bancroft, who picked up another Best Actress Oscar nomination for this role, had three nominations under her belt), every time Meg Tilly appears on the screen, she not only holds her own, she steals the show entirely. No surprise, then, that Tilly also picked up a nomination here (for Best Supporting Actress, losing to Anjelica Huston in Prizzi's Honor), and well-deserved it is. The one thing that jars in the movie is that it often seems as if Tilly's performance doesn't quite belong in the same movie as Fonda's and Bancroft's do. I've been mulling on this for a while now and I haven't quite figured out why this is, but there's a different tone to the scenes with Tilly than there is with the rest of the film. Still, it is the case here--as it almost never is in such circumstances--that both pieces of this whole are equally accomplished. The trio of lead actresses all turn in incredible performances. The sets are minimalist, almost sere, but beautifully photographed, and the pacing is dead-on. If you missed this one the first time around, or are too young to have caught it when it first came out, it's well worth rediscovering. ****",4,Why Meg Tilly should have been an A-list actress.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2700,"['Agnes', 'God', 'Norman', 'Jewison', '1985', 'John', 'Pielmeier', 'play', 'Agnes', 'God', 'one', 'perfect', 'locked', 'room', 'mysteries', 'actually', 'being', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'get-go', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'film', 'adaptation', 'nominated', 'three', 'Oscars', 'fantastic', 'translation', 'featuring', 'two', 'established', 'stars', 'one', 'rise', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'household', 'name', 'Everything', 'term', 'modern', 'classic', 'So', 'why', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'faded', 'obscurity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'happen', 'order', 'people', 'rediscover', 'make', 'classic', 'be', 'later', 'least', 'what', 'hope', 'going', 'here.The', 'film', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'body', 'infant', 'bloody', 'towels', 'trash', 'can', 'young', 'Catholic', 'novitiate', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'Psycho', 'II', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'Agnes', 'birth', 'was', 'miraculous', 'police', 'are', ""n't"", 'buying', 'send', 'Martha', 'Livingston', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'psychologist', 'find', 'out', 'Agnes', 'insane', 'other', 'side', 'equation', 'Miriam', 'Ruth', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'mother', 'superior', 'Agnes', 'convent', 'two', 'dance', 'around', 'Agnes', 'almost', 'background', 'dance', 'Miriam', 'Martha', 'antagonists', 'who', 'come', 'grudgingly', 'respect', 'one', 'another.All', 'true', 'perhaps', 'yet', 'co-stars', 'being', 'stalwarts', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Fonda', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'been', 'nominated', 'handful', 'more', 'Bancroft', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'had', 'three', 'nominations', 'belt', 'time', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'screen', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'show', 'entirely', 'surprise', 'then', 'Tilly', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'nomination', 'here', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'losing', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Prizzi', 'Honor', 'well-deserved', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'often', 'Tilly', 'performance', ""n't"", 'quite', 'belong', 'same', 'movie', 'Fonda', 'Bancroft', 'do', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mulling', 'while', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'different', 'tone', 'scenes', 'Tilly', 'rest', 'film', 'Still', 'case', 'here', 'almost', 'never', 'such', 'circumstances', 'pieces', 'whole', 'are', 'equally', 'accomplished', 'trio', 'lead', 'actresses', 'turn', 'incredible', 'performances', 'sets', 'are', 'minimalist', 'almost', 'sere', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'pacing', 'dead-on', 'missed', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'caught', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'well', 'worth', 'rediscovering', '****']",N/A
341204,A27A3AZA7L12N6,6302860326,Stephen M. Bauer,"[25, 27]","Agnes of God has a very tight script, plot and cinematography.  It is gripping from end to end.  The film is not about religion but about the inter-personal and intra-personal conflicts of a psychiatrist, the mother superior of a community of nuns and one of her young nuns.Set in Montreal, the movie opens with a very young, pretty nun being discovered unconscious and splattered with a lot of blood.  A dead newborn baby is also discovered in the room.Presumably, unknown to anyone, the nun, Sister Agnes (Meg Tilly), had been pregnant, and she strangled the baby immediately upon its birth.  She is charged with manslaughter.A psychiatrist, Dr. Martha Livingston (Jane Fonda), is summoned by the court to make a diagnosis of the woman.  Initially Dr. Livingston resisted the assignment, because she said, it was an open and shut case.  The community of nuns is cloistered, and for Dr. Livingston to do her job, she must penetrate the world of the cloister.  She is not at all congenial or sympathetic towards the nuns.  It turns out she has her own emotional ax to flail against the church.Mother Miriam Ruth (Anne Bankcroft), the mother superior of the convent, is equally hostile to Dr. Livingston.  She is adamantly opposed to having a psychiatrist diagnose Sister Agnes, but she has no choice since it is a legal matter.  She is faced with the dilemma of sending her young charge go to jail or the nuthouse.  Later on, it comes out that the prioress has been keeping a few secrets of her own related to the issue.Everyone denies knowing the girl was pregnant.  No one has any idea how it happened.  Its obvious the postulate/novice is suffering from a serious psychiatric illness, or several.  She has the social and emotional development of a nave grade school child.The few surprises and plot twists are well spaced and more than enough to keep the plot flowing.  I found all of the characters and action credible.  The three main characters are all multi-dimensional.  The Mother Superior is well rounded, a mature person and leader, full of flaws and dragging a lifetime of baggage.  Sister Agnes is the epitome of innocence and purity.  She comes across as truly otherworldly.  Her singing symbolizes both.  I was a little disappointed in Dr. Livingston.  Considering she was a psychiatrist, I thought she was a too lacking in self-knowledge.  Her chain smoking was both annoying and symbolic.Dr. Livingston's assigned task is diagnosing Sister Agnes only, not cure her, but Dr. Livingston quickly channels her anger into passionately trying to help her.  She succeeds as a psychiatrist and as a human being.",4,Excellent film about a young nun who gets pregnant,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,2620,"['Agnes', 'God', 'very', 'tight', 'script', 'plot', 'cinematography', 'gripping', 'end', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'religion', 'inter-personal', 'intra-personal', 'conflicts', 'psychiatrist', 'mother', 'superior', 'community', 'nuns', 'one', 'young', 'nuns.Set', 'Montreal', 'movie', 'very', 'young', 'pretty', 'nun', 'being', 'discovered', 'unconscious', 'splattered', 'lot', 'blood', 'dead', 'newborn', 'baby', 'also', 'discovered', 'room.Presumably', 'unknown', 'anyone', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'had', 'been', 'pregnant', 'strangled', 'baby', 'immediately', 'birth', 'charged', 'manslaughter.A', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Martha', 'Livingston', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'summoned', 'court', 'make', 'diagnosis', 'woman', 'Initially', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'resisted', 'assignment', 'said', 'was', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'community', 'nuns', 'cloistered', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'do', 'job', 'must', 'penetrate', 'world', 'cloister', 'not', 'congenial', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'nuns', 'out', 'own', 'emotional', 'ax', 'flail', 'church.Mother', 'Miriam', 'Ruth', 'Anne', 'Bankcroft', 'mother', 'superior', 'convent', 'equally', 'hostile', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'having', 'psychiatrist', 'diagnose', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'choice', 'legal', 'matter', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'sending', 'young', 'charge', 'go', 'jail', 'nuthouse', 'Later', 'out', 'prioress', 'been', 'keeping', 'few', 'secrets', 'own', 'related', 'issue.Everyone', 'knowing', 'girl', 'was', 'pregnant', 'one', 'idea', 'how', 'happened', 'obvious', 'postulate/novice', 'suffering', 'serious', 'psychiatric', 'illness', 'several', 'social', 'emotional', 'development', 'nave', 'grade', 'school', 'child.The', 'few', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'well', 'spaced', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'plot', 'flowing', 'found', 'characters', 'action', 'credible', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'multi-dimensional', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'well', 'rounded', 'mature', 'person', 'leader', 'full', 'flaws', 'dragging', 'lifetime', 'baggage', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'epitome', 'innocence', 'purity', 'truly', 'otherworldly', 'singing', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'Considering', 'was', 'psychiatrist', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'lacking', 'self-knowledge', 'chain', 'smoking', 'was', 'annoying', 'symbolic.Dr', 'Livingston', 'assigned', 'task', 'diagnosing', 'Sister', 'Agnes', 'only', 'not', 'cure', 'Dr.', 'Livingston', 'quickly', 'channels', 'anger', 'passionately', 'trying', 'help', 'psychiatrist', 'human', 'being']",N/A

341206,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,6302860326,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 1]","Agnes of God was one of those little gems, which while not overlooked (both Ann Bancroft and Meg Tilly were nominated for their performances), could have received more attention. The reason it did not, I believe, is that it challenges the viewer and takes a serious look at core beliefs, thus automatically taking it out of the mainstream.The film really is about three mutually exclusive, opposing viewpoints and outlooks on life. One side is represented by Meg Tilly, playing the naive, young nun accused of murder, and who represents pure religious ecstacy. The other is played by Ann Bancroft, who plays the mother superior of the convent, and while religious, knows of and is experienced in the world. The last is Jane Fonda, who plays a court-appointed psychiatrist to determine if Meg Tilly is competent to stand trial. She represents the world of secular humanism.On one level the movie is a drama, whose underlying plot is to determine exactly what happened that night when Meg Tilly was discovered with a dead baby. On a deeper level the movie is an examination of how each position  -- humanism, religiosity, and religious ecstacy -- views the world.This film is basically an ensemble plot that pits the performances of Fonda, Bancroft and Tilly, and their respective viewpoints, against each other. It is truly a cultural clash of these three orientations where one side attempts to understand the other. Through most of the movie there is no understanding or meeting of the minds, there is conflict and there is only misunderstanding. There is conflict in the movie not just because the screen writers wanted some dramatic tension in the film. These three viewpoint indeed are different points of view where there is little common ground.The legal system must proceed, but Fonda (secular humanism), consistent with her rationalistic nature, wants very much to understand the obvious genuineness of Meg Tilly's religious fervor. Is this a reflection of her own (secular humanism's) deep seated sense of her own vacuity? She works a little harder than she would have done if this were an other case. And the viewer too wants to believe as well. The viewer does not want to believe that Tilly was molested or abused. The viewer indeed wants to believe in Meg Tilly's own purity and that she indeed did have a virgin birth. The viewer's hopes are anchored on the great depth of Tilly's faith. There is enough evidence to make the viewer believe that perhaps Tilly is pure and did not kill the baby, because when she is caught up in her religious zeal, she bleeds. Some of the most poignant scenes in the movie is where, personally confused and conflicted by all the attention paying upon her, Meg Tilly spontaneously bleeds on the palms of her hands. The establishment (Ann Bancroft) will always have an interest in clearing the matter quickly and neatly. It is only after the film progresses that the truth is revealed. Whether the film presented such a resolution only the viewer can answer. Whatever that resolution, the Jane Fonda character still wanted to believe.All performances are strong and all the main actresses were Oscar-nominated for good reason. Fonda's performance deserved a nomination as well, but she wasn't for whatever reason. The dynamics between these characters alone are enough to justify viewing the film.This movie is thought-provoking. If there was any movie not meant for casual viewing, it is this one.

I don't like Jane Fonda, but I like this film.I think Meg Tilly is wonderful as Agnes, a simple girl in every meaning of the word, who it is revealed had been abused by her mother. She is sheltered in the cloistered convent by the Mother Superior (Bancroft) who is really her aunt.Jane Fonda's character is arrogant, sceptical and sometimes annoying (that's just me)Agnes has given birth to a full term baby and when it is found, it's in a waste basket dead. She (Fonda) thinks the Mother Superior had something to do with it. Who the babies father is, is anyone's guess. The end of the film is perplexing, it didn't really clear anything up for me. But it still remains one of my favorite films.As for the stereotypical nuns, they were depicted as one might think of nuns... living in a pastoral surroundings, tending their animals and growing small crops, praying, singing hymns (that's one of the most memorable moments, when Agnes is singing..) I'm not Catholic, but it CERTAINLY didn't make me think badly of Catholics and nuns, it intrigued me...I thought it was nice :-)Great flick, see it...",5,Classic,1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,1137,"['Great', 'Film', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'Quebec', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'like', 'film.I', 'think', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'wonderful', 'Agnes', 'simple', 'girl', 'meaning', 'word', 'who', 'revealed', 'had', 'been', 'abused', 'mother', 'sheltered', 'cloistered', 'convent', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Bancroft', 'who', 'really', 'aunt.Jane', 'Fonda', 'character', 'arrogant', 'sceptical', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'just', 'Agnes', 'given', 'birth', 'full', 'term', 'baby', 'when', 'found', 'waste', 'basket', 'dead', 'Fonda', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Who', 'babies', 'father', 'anyone', 'guess', 'end', 'film', 'perplexing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'clear', 'anything', 'up', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'films.As', 'stereotypical', 'nuns', 'were', 'depicted', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'nuns', 'living', 'pastoral', 'surroundings', 'tending', 'animals', 'growing', 'small', 'crops', 'praying', 'singing', 'hymns', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'when', 'Agnes', 'singing..', ""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'CERTAINLY', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'badly', 'Catholics', 'nuns', 'intrigued', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'Great', 'flick', 'see']",N/A
