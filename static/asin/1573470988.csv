A movie can be a great movie despite its budget; any movie, regardless of budget, must achieve certain qualities to be a good movie. Good acting, good camera work, etc, all must be there, and are certainly attainable with low budget equipment. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't achieve any of those elements. I will say this is by no means the worst horror film I've seen, as it offers some redeeming qualities. It just doesn't present anything compelling; the acting is mostly very weak, and the story development is way too slow. None of this is especially annoyingly bad, but it isn't enough to overcome the terrible special effects.  The ""horror"" parts are simply awful. There's a scene of a witch stabbing people who have to be standing 20' away.

The resident 'witch' lapses into a trance, summoning forth a hag-witch ancestor who incrementally preys upon the group in kind.One by one they are dispatched and turned into zombies - their souls absorbed by the hag, until a &quot;nerdy&quot; couple finally confront her with the scientific method. A seeming statement of technology countering superstition. The prosthetics are average 'FX/CGI is most remarkable here, with many power bolts being thrown about. The hag is a bit cannibalistic / vampiric at times, seeking justice for being murdered. Of note, in one scene, one of the characters is whisked into the past to be in the place of the 'witch' being burned, that he may know what it feels like, by what his christian ancestors committed, was a nice touch.This film pretty much amounts to the plethora of movies capitalizing on the 'iwtchtryal' misjustices of the christian past, although for the record, no accused 'witches' were actually burned in America, which was the modes of execution in Europe, whereas the colonies preferred the methods of including slow-hanging, dowsing, the hand vice, and various method of torture. Of course, these were not actual &quot;witches&quot;, Satanists, etc. anyway, but victims of petty squabbled from neighbors; attractive women who refused the advances from the Witchfynders, of roving husbands that accused them of seducing them, instead of admitting to infidelity; solitary persons upon which urban legendry was projected, etc., not practicing 'witches'.

188988,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,1573470988,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","The first question to contemplate about ""Witchouse"" is: why is it one word? Why isn't it ""Witch House"" or ""Witchhouse""?The second is why anyone made this movie in the first place.""Witchouse"" is one of those so-bad-it's-hilarious movies that Full Moon Entertainment/Pictures/ Features/Whatever churned out in the '80s and '90s, usually with nonsensical scripts and entertainingly awful acting. ""Witchouse"" is one of the more hilariously awful examples of their output -- it's a pretty awful horror movie, but it's fun to laugh at the constant ineptitude. Seriously, who DOESN'T notice an evil undead witch walking five feet behind them?Several stereotypical college students (slut, jock, virgin, bad girl, stoner, nerd, mousy girl) are invited to Witchouse, an old mansion in the town of Dunwich. Their hostess is Elizabeth (Ashley McKinney), a rather strange former classmate who has decided to celebrate May Day with a creepy Halloweeny party. She also regales them with the story of her ancestress Lilith, a powerful but rather indiscreet witch who was burned by witch-hunters after she tried to sacrifice a child.Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth is actually a witch herself. And since evil powers aren't enough for her, she plans to sacrifice a pair of people she already beheaded in order to resurrect Lilith (Ariauna Albright), who now looks like a cut-rate ""Buffy"" vampire. The potential victims have all split into their own little groups, and it's up to the only people with brains to figure out why they were singled out for Lilith's vengeance.""Witchouse"" is a pretty by-the-numbers horror movie -- it's a standard supernatural-creature-wants-revenge plot, with a painfully typical cast of idiots who do all the usual things before dying/being possessed. There's not really a plot, just a lot of people wandering around and getting picked off VERY SLOWLY by the witch. It's about as horrifying as glimpsing the back of your fridge.It's also pretty clear that nobody involved in production actually cared about what they were doing. One particularly laughable scene has Elizabeth attributing some of the greatest disasters in history to May Day (uh, lady, Vesuvius erupted in LATE SUMMER). Another has an unfortunate pair of lovers being beheaded by a mysterious witch... who is clearly standing at least ten feet away, and puts no energy into her swipes.And Lilith doesn't seem to be in a hurry for her revenge. Apparently she can be stopped by a closed door, and she allows her potential victims to scheme for several minutes before actually meandering in to destroy them.And the glimpses of Puritan-era witch-burnings establish that everybody dressed in Ye Olde S&Mwear;, and for some reason they kept around a bunch of guys shaking their heads really fast.The characters are also so gloriously shallow that they may give you paper cuts. Each one has a single characteristic -- one is a stoner, one is a slut, one is a shy virgin -- and nothing more than that, although there are some feeble attempts to flesh out the most sympathetic of the gang. McKinney is particularly bad -- her character just comes across as a bratty little girl dabbling the occult, and every single word she says telegraphs, ""I am an evil witch.""And a fun fact: the tomboyish bad-girl Janet is played by Brooke Mueller, long before she became Charlie Sheen's third ex-wife. This movie will make you grateful that she didn't continue her acting career, because she has the acting ability of a rotting log -- her attempts to sound ""street"" are like listening to cats having a screech-off.""Witchouse"" is an awful, awful movie... and yet it's also strangely hilarious in its relentless badness.
