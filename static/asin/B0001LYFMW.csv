As a new high school graduate, her small-town life is in a rut, but it's a familiar rut so she continues. Then her grandpa dies, her grandma gets lung cancer, her friend Riley asks her to go on a road trip to Hollywood, and her boyfriend Dean asks her to marry him. When her Aunt and Uncle start a big argument to sell grandma's house, Jude doesn't know which way to turn. She breaks up with Dean and tells Riley she's ready to leave town right then, but Riley chickens out. Jude's mom and healed-up grandma encourage her to explore and have new adventures. The movie ends with Jude driving solo down the road to parts unexplored. Everyone will recognize something of themselves in this interesting, original film. *****",5,Making Up Her Mind,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,820,"['Pretty', 'Jude', 'hypochondriacal', 'mom', 'fussy-but-funny', 'grandma', 'kindly', 'invalid', 'grandpa', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'small-town', 'life', 'rut', 'familiar', 'rut', 'Then', 'grandpa', 'dies', 'grandma', 'lung', 'cancer', 'friend', 'Riley', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'Hollywood', 'boyfriend', 'Dean', 'marry', 'When', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'start', 'big', 'argument', 'sell', 'grandma', 'house', 'Jude', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'turn', 'up', 'Dean', 'tells', 'Riley', 'ready', 'leave', 'town', 'right', 'then', 'Riley', 'out', 'Jude', 'mom', 'healed-up', 'grandma', 'encourage', 'explore', 'have', 'new', 'adventures', 'movie', 'Jude', 'driving', 'solo', 'road', 'parts', 'unexplored', 'Everyone', 'will', 'recognize', 'something', 'interesting', 'original', 'film', '*****']",Searching for Wooden Watermelons
