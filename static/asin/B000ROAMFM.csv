1083524,A32T2H8150OJLU,B000ROAMFM,ARH,"[0, 0]","This review addresses only ""Against Her Will"".Walter Matthau plays crusty home-grown lawyer Harmon Cobb in ""Against Her Will: An Incident in Baltimore"".  Having mounted a successful case inIncident, Cobb is taken on as a partner by Judge Stoddard Bell in his private practice in Baltimore.  So Cobb, his daughtr-in-law who was widdowed during WWII, and her daughter, move from Colorado to Baltimore.  Cobb realizes that he has been taken in largely as sort of a charity, case, which rankles him, but when he becomes aware of things that may be going on in a state-funded mental hospital he starts to dig.  Before long he takes on a woman incarcerated in the hospital as his client, and they set out to try to right some hidden wrongs.I have to admit that there are very few of Matthau's movies that I like, but I like these.  His character, Harmon Cobb, is probably my favorite Matthau character ever.The acting is good.  The storyline is intruiging and engaging, and the twists and turns are sufficient to keep most viewers waiting to see what happens next.This is top-notch drama.  It relies on few if any special effects.A solid show, well worth your time!",4,"Pretty good made-for-tv drama, but not as good as the first movie in the series, ""The Incident""",1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,1159,"['review', 'only', 'Against', 'Her', 'Will', '.Walter', 'Matthau', 'crusty', 'home-grown', 'lawyer', 'Harmon', 'Cobb', 'Against', 'Her', 'Will', 'Incident', 'Baltimore', 'Having', 'mounted', 'successful', 'case', 'inIncident', 'Cobb', 'taken', 'partner', 'Judge', 'Stoddard', 'Bell', 'private', 'practice', 'Baltimore', 'So', 'Cobb', 'daughtr-in-law', 'who', 'was', 'widdowed', 'WWII', 'daughter', 'move', 'Colorado', 'Baltimore', 'Cobb', 'been', 'taken', 'largely', 'sort', 'charity', 'case', 'when', 'aware', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'state-funded', 'mental', 'hospital', 'dig', 'long', 'woman', 'incarcerated', 'hospital', 'client', 'set', 'out', 'try', 'right', 'hidden', 'wrongs.I', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'Matthau', 'movies', 'like', 'character', 'Harmon', 'Cobb', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Matthau', 'character', 'ever.The', 'acting', 'good', 'storyline', 'intruiging', 'engaging', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'sufficient', 'keep', 'most', 'viewers', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'top-notch', 'drama', 'few', 'special', 'effects.A', 'solid', 'show', 'well', 'time']",Against Her Will/Wounded Heart
1083525,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000ROAMFM,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[7, 7]","This review is about ""Against Her Will"". Aparently Walter Mathau starred in a few TV movies in the 1990s about a lawyer back in the 1940s. This is the second movie in the series. In this movie he has moved from near a POW camp at Bremen, Colorado to Baltimore, Maryland. A federal judge, played by Harry Morgan, that drafted him to defend a German at the POW camp that had been accused of murder in the first movie ""The Incident"", now wants him as a partner in a law firm. Excellent acting, story, sets, and music make this well worth owning. In this movie, he must try to get a young woman out of a state mental hospital but the hospital and state don't want to let her out because of what she knows about their care. There are two other movies in this series,IncidentandIncident In A Small Town. If you enjoyed this catchTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition).In ""Wounded Heart"" a young successful New York stock trader must return to her home town to visit her father, played by Stuart Whittman, after a stroke. She has hated him for fifteen years after her parents split up. A revisit to the ranch in Texas rekindles some feelings and some new ones develop with her stepbrother. This concerns her fiance that rushes out to Texas to keep her from staying there. Meanwhile a cutthroat company is using any means possible to get her father off the ranch so they can build an elaborate modern shopping center. Reasonably decent romance/drama. If you enjoyed this catchThicker Than Water. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. I enjoyed both movies, especially ""Against Her Will"" and I think most families would enjoy the first one and those that like romances would like ""Wounded Heart"".CA Luster",4,Against Her Will/Wounded Heart,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,1710,"['review', 'Against', 'Her', 'Will', 'Aparently', 'Walter', 'Mathau', 'starred', 'few', 'TV', 'movies', '1990s', 'lawyer', 'back', '1940s', 'second', 'movie', 'series', 'movie', 'moved', 'POW', 'camp', 'Bremen', 'Colorado', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'federal', 'judge', 'played', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'drafted', 'defend', 'German', 'POW', 'camp', 'had', 'been', 'accused', 'murder', 'first', 'movie', 'Incident', 'now', 'partner', 'law', 'firm', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'story', 'sets', 'music', 'make', 'well', 'owning', 'movie', 'must', 'try', 'get', 'young', 'woman', 'state', 'mental', 'hospital', 'hospital', 'state', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'out', 'what', 'care', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'IncidentandIncident', 'A', 'Small', 'Town', 'enjoyed', 'catchTo', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Collector', 'Edition', '.In', 'Wounded', 'Heart', 'young', 'successful', 'New', 'York', 'stock', 'trader', 'must', 'return', 'home', 'town', 'visit', 'father', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Whittman', 'stroke', 'hated', 'fifteen', 'years', 'parents', 'split', 'up', 'revisit', 'ranch', 'Texas', 'feelings', 'new', 'ones', 'develop', 'stepbrother', 'fiance', 'out', 'Texas', 'keep', 'staying', 'there', 'Meanwhile', 'cutthroat', 'company', 'using', 'means', 'possible', 'get', 'father', 'ranch', 'can', 'build', 'elaborate', 'modern', 'shopping', 'center', 'Reasonably', 'decent', 'romance/drama', 'enjoyed', 'catchThicker', 'Than', 'Water', 'Good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'replayability', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'especially', 'Against', 'Her', 'Will', 'think', 'most', 'families', 'would', 'enjoy', 'first', 'one', 'like', 'romances', 'would', 'like', 'Wounded', 'Heart', '.CA', 'Luster']",Against Her Will/Wounded Heart
1083526,A2NXLMNPSZ6P0,B000ROAMFM,Dave,"[1, 1]","Against Her Will is a favorite.  Matthau and Morgan were a great match for this series.  The DVD version has a little more than the TV version had - like when Billie tells Harmon about her new job, and what happens after ""Donald 2"" phones Harmon.  The DVD is presented in the ""full screen"" format, and has virtually no features (like subtitles, etc).Wounded Heart is so bad that I won't even attempt to rate it.

1083527,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000ROAMFM,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","Stars Walter Matthau (aged lawyer Cobb) and Harry Morgan (Judge Bell) team up again for a second part originating from the early 1990s but taking place in a filmed 1947 version of Baltimore.  An astonishing well filmed, well acted, well written, story that is so riveting and emotionally captivating that you will never touch the pause button.  The story takes on the 1940s understandings of mental illness and institutions of that period.  It's not a light subject but it is professionally produced drama that could almost serve as a documentary of misunderstandings of the times.Matthau and Morgan have become a team, first doing ""The Incident"" (read my recent 5-star review).  The are as perfect together as the odd couple, the Marx's Brothers, or Dorothy & Toto.  They seem to naturally fit together.  The chemistry works for the first WWII, 1944, POW camp murder story, as it does in this wrongful confinement situation.  Both are SO MUCH MORE than crime, courtroom, and police drama.  They are emotional family situational drama.  The complexity of plot vs characters reminds me of Harry Morgan's days in MASH.  Oh, if we only had as many Matthau/Morgan period dramas as we have MASH episodes with Col. Potter.Matthau is apparently supposed to be the main star, but the duo is so closely related in the story that Leading Actor requires both their names.  Susan Blakely returns as Billie and is equally responsible for the high standard of work shown in this series.Why this trilogy has not been put into a single set astounds me.  I bought all 3.  I award 5 stars for all 3 dramas.  The third, ""Incident in a Small Town"" takes place in Cook Co., IL, in 1953.  Check out my review of that also--under the 5 star group.  Get them all.  Watch them in order and enjoy some really well presented American 1940-50s period legal drama.
