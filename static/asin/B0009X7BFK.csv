916144,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0009X7BFK,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[2, 4]","Folks, don't expect Shakespeare here. This is not (nor do I think it was intended to be) a comedy filled with depth or messages to or about the black community, etc. It's just a pleasant, loosely connected ""story"" (series of vignettes is more accurate) about Latifah and her friends at an Atlanta (actually, just the exteriors were filmed there and a scene in a park) beauty shop with a lot of amusing moments thrown in for good measure. Latifah pulls it off with her strong personality and the actress who plays her 12 year old daughter is one to watch for, but as for the often stupid supporting characters (this is not one of Alfre Woodward's better moments) and crazy antics that don't always make sense- just relax and leave your brains at the door while you pick up a cool one and laugh after a hard day's work.At a recent academy awards ceremony, Chris Rock lampooned black movies like this and Barbershop and said ""What's next- a movie called ""laundromat?'

916145,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009X7BFK,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 7]","I absolutely love Queen Latifah.  She makes any movie worth watching in my humble opinion.  It's a shame that Latifah aside `Beauty Shop' is rather dull.  It's not that it doesn't bring the funny; it's just that it's all funny we've seen many times before.  I understand that it's harder and harder these days to find an original concept for anything, but really, watching `Beauty Shop' is like major deja vu.  I've seen this done almost word for word before, I swear it.The story revolves around Gina, a hairstylist who's fed up with working for the man (that man being the snobbish Jorge).  Gina decides it's time to take her talent to the next level and open her own salon.  Jorge of course doesn't like this much and begins working to shut her down.  Things are difficult, being a single mother and all but she has the support of her friends and this gives her strength to push through.  In the meantime Gina is given a huge opportunity when her own conditioner recipe (would it be called that?) is brought to a big wig corporation by a wealthy client.  Things look to be going up for Gina, but will they stay up?Latifah is funny as Gina.  I just love her to death and she always creates the most likable characters.  Even if her movies are all B-Grade at best (`Chicago' and 'Set it Off' aside) she always makes the experience worth it.  The real standout here though is Kevin Bacon who is obviously overjoyed to be hamming it up as Jorge.  His blonde locks and wispy attitude is just such a huge departure for him it's hilarious to see.  I don't normally like Bacon but he had me in stitches.  Alicia Silverstone also makes her return to the screen here, but her impression is less than impressive.  Her accent is obnoxious and I found myself wishing she would get off the screen.The cast is huge here with names like Andie MacDowell, Mena Suvari, Alfre Woodard and Djimon Hounsou showing up every now and then.  Everyone does a decent job with what they are given and they all seem to work well with one another, feeding off the others energy.As far as comedies go this one is funny, it's just very unoriginal.  It doesn't mean that you can't find enjoyment out of this one since the laughs are there, just know that you'll have laughed at these gags before.  If you're a fan of Latifah or anyone else in the cast then by all means check this one out.  I have yet to see either of the `Barbershop' movies but I really need too since I hear they are a laugh riot.  I'm sure they are better than this film as far as plot goes.",3,Cute and funny but nothing new or original...,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2531,"['absolutely', 'love', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'humble', 'opinion', 'shame', 'Latifah', 'aside', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'rather', 'dull', 'not', ""n't"", 'bring', 'funny', 'just', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'understand', 'harder', 'harder', 'days', 'find', 'original', 'concept', 'anything', 'really', 'watching', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'major', 'deja', 'vu', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'almost', 'word', 'word', 'swear', 'it.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Gina', 'hairstylist', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'working', 'man', 'man', 'being', 'snobbish', 'Jorge', 'Gina', 'time', 'take', 'talent', 'next', 'level', 'open', 'own', 'salon', 'Jorge', 'course', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'working', 'shut', 'down', 'Things', 'are', 'difficult', 'being', 'single', 'mother', 'support', 'friends', 'strength', 'push', 'through', 'meantime', 'Gina', 'given', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'when', 'own', 'conditioner', 'recipe', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'brought', 'big', 'wig', 'corporation', 'wealthy', 'client', 'Things', 'look', 'be', 'going', 'up', 'Gina', 'will', 'stay', 'up', 'Latifah', 'funny', 'Gina', 'just', 'love', 'death', 'always', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', 'Even', 'movies', 'are', 'B-Grade', 'best', 'Chicago', ""'Set"", 'Off', 'aside', 'always', 'experience', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'obviously', 'overjoyed', 'be', 'hamming', 'up', 'Jorge', 'blonde', 'locks', 'wispy', 'attitude', 'just', 'such', 'huge', 'departure', 'hilarious', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'like', 'Bacon', 'had', 'stitches', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'also', 'return', 'screen', 'here', 'impression', 'less', 'impressive', 'accent', 'obnoxious', 'found', 'wishing', 'would', 'get', 'off', 'screen.The', 'cast', 'huge', 'here', 'names', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'showing', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'Everyone', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'one', 'feeding', 'off', 'others', 'energy.As', 'far', 'comedies', 'go', 'one', 'funny', 'just', 'very', 'unoriginal', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'laughs', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'know', ""'ll"", 'have', 'laughed', 'gags', 'before', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Latifah', 'anyone', 'else', 'cast', 'then', 'means', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Barbershop', 'movies', 'really', 'need', 'too', 'hear', 'are', 'laugh', 'riot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'better', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'plot']",N/A

I bought this for my hair stylist because her name's Gina too.  This movie has an exceptional cast.  Who doesn't love Alicia Silverstone and Kevin Bacon.  My goodness look at his brilliant career including being such a bad guy in ""Sleepers"", a great dancer in ""Footloose"" A-List guest spots on Will and Grace a million things in between and now Jorge in this fun movie. And to say nothing of the great and powerful Alfre Woodard joining the cast just for kicks, good for her.  Fun all around and a slight moral message as well.  Well done!  Okay, I'm editing this because I've just read some of your idiotic reviews.  Get your characters and actors names and parts straight, PLEASE!  Kevin Bacon played Jorge, NOT Jerome.  Della REESE, NOT Reece, had a small cameo role as a customer who put her false teeth in a glass of water, NOT Gina's mother-in-law.  If you're going to review something, pay attention.  Also, lighten up!  With all your references to racism, booty talk, head shakin', etc.  It's just a cute, funny movie, not meant to offend anyone or Queen wouldn't be in it.

916147,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B0009X7BFK,Bitcetc,"[10, 13]","Oh, dear. How I WANTED to like this movie!!!What a cast: Queen Latifah, a beautiful woman, a great soul and a terrific entertainer; Djimon Hounsou, toweringly talented, potent, sexy, AT LAST as the romantic male lead; Alfre Woodard, always awesome, in too small a role; Alicia Silverstone, charming; Della Reece, underused in a cameo; Kevin Bacon-- hysterical!But a screenplay in the hands of Kate Lanier, whose previous ""credits"" include ""Glitter"", replays every trite and tired cliche which could be shoe-horned into this situation. These actors are too good for the script to do damage to their careers, but the characters are almost all stereotypical. All the laughs-- and there are a few-- are anticipated by the audience; we've heard the jokes, and the laughs are homage to the actors, not the script. One or two conflicts which could have been interestingly developed are de-fanged and de-clawed; for example, it has been observed that the majority of black women start off with a better physical self image than do the majority of white women, an interesting concept that gets two whole lines in the movie.  It's a very labored script; the actors are so good they should have abandoned the words on the page and done the entire movie in improvisation. The edge which  Queen Latifah brought so comically to ""Bringing Down the House"" is homogenized into blandness. This is the stale white bread version of a comedy which should have become a classic with these actors, who do their best to give us something on the stage which is clearly not on the page.Queen Latifa as Gina, hairdresser extraordinaire, is driven by the hilariously affected Kevin Bacon's ""Jorge"" to quit his fashionable salon (""you're fired!"" ""No, I quit"" dialogue is embarrassingly overused, even with the delivery talents of Queen Latifah and Kevin Bacon). So Gina ""magic make-overs"" her way into a small business loan, buying a ghetto-ized salon and homogenizing the decor and humor to accommodate both black and white customers. Hackneyed dialogue and unoriginal challenges fail to deliver even the expected ""payoff"" shots: where's the shot of Della Reece or of Jorge after their ""make-overs""? Why can the only way to get Djimon Hounsou back into the salon at the end of the movie be for him to deliver a bouquet of flowers to Gina? Why didn't they ask someone else to write the screenplay? Why, oh why?Sadly, this movie will play better on network TV, where there are commercial breaks, and boredom doesn't have so much opportunity to set in. Maybe there will be some good outtakes and improvisations on the DVD.

I didn't even enjoy the movie and told a friend of mine to think twice about going to see it. The movie is so sexist that it's not even funny. The men, especially Black men,  were portrayed negatively througout the movie. There was not one single decent Black man. Not ONE. They were shown as liars,  control freaks, cheaters, ex-cons, down lows,  sissies, abusers, as well as disrespectful. Outside of the barber shop there was always this same group of thuggish Black men chilling on the sidewalk day in and day out. Didn't any of them have jobs? Gina's love interest, Joe, wasn't even portrayed in a positive light. Yeah, he was buff and into the arts and stuff, but he was effiminate, too much of a softy. The women, on the other hand,  were shown too much as being strong, desirable, industrious,  independent achievers. Yeah, sure.And  you can't forget the racism. Lynn (the white stylist) gets no love or respect from the black hair stylists.  Why? Simply because she's being herself. To get them to respect her, she has to  style her hair in those hideous extraterrestrial weave styles, twist her neck, finger snap, and be sassy. Nonsense like this happens all the time among younger Blacks.. If you want to prove how Black you are, all you gotta do is speak in slang all the time, listen to rap/hip-hop, wear cornrows, wear your pants hanging off your butt if your a guy, prance around half-naked and shake your behind if you're a woman, and blame the White man for everything.  I'll pass on that, thank you very much.Anyway, this movie reeked and it was worse than ""Waiting to Exhale."" It's full of nonsense, too predictable,  and it puts bad ideas into women's heads. I can't support Black movies if they're going to be dumb like ""Beauty Shop.""

Most of us just grin and bear it, knowing that we need the job if we want to put food on the table. But others take a stand by telling the boss to take the job and shove it. This is the setting for this move, ""Beauty Shop"", a film starring Queen Latifah.The plot and dialogue of this movie are rather bland and most viewers will agree there is nothing exceptional to be seen or heard in this movie. There are some funny moments, but the dialogue is, for the most part, very simple and lacking in sophistication. So is the basic plot, which follows a thirty- something woman on her journey from unappreciated hair stylist for an egocentric boss to owner of her own hair styling salon.There is one exception to the ""ordinary"" aspect of this film, and that person is actor Kevin Bacon. He plays the eccentric Jorge- the guy who owns the beauty shop where Queen Latifah is originally employed. Bacon's character is an oddball and the role isn't like any other he has played. I did a double take when I first saw him in this film. I couldn't believe it was Kevin Bacon in such a weird role (for him, that is). Here he is playing this conceited, long- haired guy with an Eastern European accent. The character is too bizarre to be real, but Bacon does grab your attention with this performance, if nothing else because the character is so different for him.Queen Latifah is the other standout in this film, even though it doesn't rank among her best acting efforts. The other cast members are ok, but no one is exceptional. The only people who I believe are good and could have been better are Paige Hurd (plays Latifah's young daughter) and Djimon Hounsou (plays Latifah's love interest). Their problem in this movie is that their respective roles are too limited. They don't really get the chance to say very much or perform very much.This movie doesn't have much of a message except, perhaps, that things can be achieved with determination and a little help from one's friends.

There are ample doses of humor spread throughout the entire film, and thus Beauty Shop succeeds fairly well - albeit unevenly - as a comedy.  I actually watched this film because Mena Suvari is in it, and I just have to say: Mena, the magic is gone.  What in the world happened to bring Mena down to the level (nay, below the level) of Alicia Silverstone?The story's pretty simple.  Gina (Queen Latifah) is a hairstylist for the fabulous Jorge - until he pushes her past her breaking point and she makes a few references to certain posterior body parts and leaves.  Let's just stop and talk about Jorge.  Just when I was beginning to take Kevin Bacon seriously as an actor, he shows up in what has to be the most excruciatingly embarrassing role I've encountered in years.  Anyway, Gina decides to open her own shop.  It's rough going early on, but she and a bevy of outspoken women soon turn her dream into a reality.  Oh, there are more problems later on, of course, but it doesn't take her (and her hair crack conditioner) very long to start stealing some of Jorge's best customers away from him.  This is where Mena Suvari and Andie MacDowell come in - I don't think either one will want to put these roles anywhere near the top of their acting resumes.  Mena is particularly disappointing, and it didn't help her or the story when her character suddenly underwent a complete personality change for seemingly no reason whatsoever toward the end.  Then there's Alicia Silverstone; I don't know if she can possibly come back from this performance.  She's the white girl trying to fit in with her black co-workers, and her performance just gets more and more painful to watch as time passes (and what is with that terrible Southern accent?).  The performance of Little JJ as a little playa on constant booty patrol will help get you past the bad parts, though - he's hilarious.Naturally, there's a little romance thrown in the mix, but you'll spend more time trying to make Darnelle look like the Keshia Knight Pulliam you remember from The Cosby Show than worrying about whether Gina can make a love connection with the electrician living above the boutique.  I know I haven't said a lot of good things about the movie, but most of the good things come from the interaction of the outspoken women inside the beauty shop.  There are some real characters in that bunch, and they do keep the comedy flowing.  Basically, Beauty Shop is an average movie with a slightly better than average level of comedy.",3,Light-weight and superficial - yet funny enough to get by with it,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2812,"['examine', 'movie', 'critical', 'eye', ""'ll"", 'find', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'lot', 'superficial', 'characters', 'more', 'one', 'questionable', 'performance', 'critical', 'eye', 'can', 'not', 'gauge', 'comedic', 'beauty', 'shop', 'atmosphere', 'quantify', 'aura', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'ample', 'doses', 'humor', 'spread', 'entire', 'film', 'thus', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'fairly', 'well', 'albeit', 'unevenly', 'comedy', 'actually', 'watched', 'film', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'Mena', 'magic', 'gone', 'What', 'world', 'happened', 'bring', 'Mena', 'down', 'level', 'nay', 'level', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Gina', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'hairstylist', 'fabulous', 'Jorge', 'past', 'breaking', 'point', 'few', 'references', 'certain', 'posterior', 'body', 'parts', 'leaves', 'Let', 'just', 'stop', 'talk', 'Jorge', 'Just', 'when', 'was', 'beginning', 'take', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'seriously', 'actor', 'up', 'be', 'most', 'excruciatingly', 'embarrassing', 'role', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'years', 'Anyway', 'Gina', 'open', 'own', 'shop', 'rough', 'going', 'early', 'bevy', 'outspoken', 'women', 'soon', 'turn', 'dream', 'reality', 'Oh', 'are', 'more', 'problems', 'later', 'course', ""n't"", 'take', 'hair', 'crack', 'conditioner', 'very', 'long', 'start', 'stealing', 'Jorge', 'best', 'customers', 'away', 'where', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'put', 'roles', 'anywhere', 'top', 'acting', 'resumes', 'Mena', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'story', 'when', 'character', 'suddenly', 'underwent', 'complete', 'personality', 'change', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'end', 'Then', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'possibly', 'come', 'back', 'performance', 'white', 'girl', 'trying', 'fit', 'black', 'co-workers', 'performance', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'painful', 'watch', 'time', 'passes', 'what', 'terrible', 'Southern', 'accent', 'performance', 'Little', 'JJ', 'little', 'playa', 'constant', 'booty', 'patrol', 'will', 'help', 'get', 'bad', 'parts', 'hilarious.Naturally', 'little', 'romance', 'thrown', 'mix', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'Darnelle', 'look', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'remember', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'worrying', 'Gina', 'can', 'make', 'love', 'connection', 'electrician', 'living', 'boutique', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'said', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'most', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'interaction', 'outspoken', 'women', 'beauty', 'shop', 'are', 'real', 'characters', 'bunch', 'do', 'keep', 'comedy', 'flowing', 'Basically', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'average', 'movie', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'level', 'comedy']",N/A

916169,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009X7BFK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 11]","Many link the word conflict with war, but it can also be an opposing action or idea of an individual.  The moment of conflict creates a new and unfamiliar situation, which either is subtle, obvious, or somewhere in between when it creates a change.  For a storyteller, it is necessary to incorporate a conflict of some sort, as it awakens drama, thoughts, and direction for the story.  When conflict is missing, the story looses its appeal and the audience easily lets their attention drift into a new direction.  On occasion, a presented conflict follows a formulaic theme, which leaves the audience hanging without a clear narrative.Gina Norris (Queen Latifah) has relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, with her daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) after she has recently lost her husband.  With the help of her mother-in-law, Gina works at an upscale hair salon owned by Jorge (Kevin Bacon), while she has someone at home for Vanessa.  However, Jorge is a difficult boss and Gina decides to take her hair styling skills elsewhere.  At this moment the film becomes interesting, as it combines light humor with an interesting conflict.  Nonetheless, the conflict evaporates through the depiction of the story, as the potential struggle disappears through a push on the easy button.Several difficult situations emerge, but each time director Bille Woodruff erases Gina's predicament with another scene that solves the problem.  There is never any true problem in the story, as it gets solved as soon as it is presented.  Not that Gina deserves trouble, as she must have had a difficult time loosing her husband.  However, some form of lasting conflict would make the story a little more interesting.  For example, when Gina has electrical problems the electrician lives upstairs, when she is going through a tough time it does not feel problematic, and when she is short of money she still wears a Tiffany necklace.The film is extremely upbeat and positive, which definitely has something to do with Queen Latifah's character Gina.  Gina never sees the glass as half empty, as she always see the potential in bad hair and talent.  She is a true trooper, leader, and entrepreneur that will walk over mountains and swim oceans before giving up.  This is where the film's strength rests, unfortunately the director does not portray a problem for Gina that would illustrate her ability to lead and conquer her troubles.  This is why the film turns into an uninteresting experience, as the conflict presented is not great enough for a forceful character such as Gina.It is essential for the storyteller to present conflict that displays some form of struggle whether it is cerebral, physical, psychological, or social struggle.  Beauty Shop presents the notion of a conflict, but it is without struggle, as everything magically falls into place.  One of the positives in the film is the terrific cast, which includes talents such as Queen Latifah, Djimon Hounsou, Kevin Bacon, Alfre Woodard, Andie MacDowell, and Alicia Silverstone.  The film also has warm and welcoming cinematography that frames the flawless mise-en-scene (maybe to flawless).  Combined, the many aspects of filmmaking produce a below par film, which disappoints rather than surprises.",2,"Some Laughter and Eye Candy, But a Flat Story...",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,3235,"['Many', 'link', 'word', 'conflict', 'war', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'opposing', 'action', 'idea', 'individual', 'moment', 'conflict', 'new', 'unfamiliar', 'situation', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'somewhere', 'when', 'change', 'storyteller', 'necessary', 'incorporate', 'conflict', 'sort', 'drama', 'thoughts', 'direction', 'story', 'When', 'conflict', 'missing', 'story', 'appeal', 'audience', 'easily', 'attention', 'drift', 'new', 'direction', 'occasion', 'presented', 'conflict', 'formulaic', 'theme', 'audience', 'hanging', 'clear', 'narrative.Gina', 'Norris', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'relocated', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'daughter', 'Vanessa', 'Paige', 'Hurd', 'recently', 'lost', 'husband', 'help', 'mother-in-law', 'Gina', 'upscale', 'hair', 'salon', 'owned', 'Jorge', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'someone', 'home', 'Vanessa', 'However', 'Jorge', 'difficult', 'boss', 'Gina', 'take', 'hair', 'styling', 'skills', 'elsewhere', 'moment', 'film', 'interesting', 'light', 'humor', 'interesting', 'conflict', 'Nonetheless', 'conflict', 'depiction', 'story', 'potential', 'struggle', 'push', 'easy', 'button.Several', 'difficult', 'situations', 'emerge', 'time', 'director', 'Bille', 'Woodruff', 'Gina', 'predicament', 'scene', 'problem', 'never', 'true', 'problem', 'story', 'solved', 'as', 'soon', 'presented', 'Not', 'Gina', 'trouble', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'loosing', 'husband', 'However', 'form', 'lasting', 'conflict', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'example', 'when', 'Gina', 'electrical', 'problems', 'electrician', 'upstairs', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'time', 'not', 'feel', 'problematic', 'when', 'short', 'money', 'still', 'Tiffany', 'necklace.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'upbeat', 'positive', 'definitely', 'something', 'do', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'character', 'Gina', 'Gina', 'never', 'glass', 'half', 'empty', 'always', 'see', 'potential', 'bad', 'hair', 'talent', 'true', 'trooper', 'leader', 'entrepreneur', 'will', 'walk', 'mountains', 'swim', 'oceans', 'giving', 'up', 'where', 'film', 'strength', 'rests', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'not', 'portray', 'problem', 'Gina', 'would', 'illustrate', 'ability', 'lead', 'conquer', 'troubles', 'why', 'film', 'uninteresting', 'experience', 'conflict', 'presented', 'not', 'great', 'enough', 'forceful', 'character', 'such', 'Gina.It', 'essential', 'storyteller', 'present', 'conflict', 'form', 'struggle', 'cerebral', 'physical', 'psychological', 'social', 'struggle', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'notion', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'everything', 'magically', 'place', 'One', 'positives', 'film', 'terrific', 'cast', 'talents', 'such', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'film', 'also', 'warm', 'welcoming', 'cinematography', 'flawless', 'mise-en-scene', 'maybe', 'flawless', 'Combined', 'many', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'produce', 'below', 'par', 'film', 'rather', 'surprises']",N/A

However, I am the guy that liked BARBERSHOP 2 and DOWN WITH LOVE, so demographics don't mean much.  BEAUTY SHOP is the spin-off from the BARBERSHOP series.  Gina has packed up and moved out of the BARBERSHOP neighborhood to allow her daughter the opportunity to attend a prestigious music school.  However, Gina soon discovers that her new boss, Kevin Bacon with an over-the-top accent, is too much to deal with, so she buys her own beauty shop and the movie officially begins.  The film attempts to be a female version of BARBERSHOP with jokes now told from a woman's point of view.  Here's where the audience and I parted ways.  The audience laughed even when there didn't appear to have been a joke told.  There were, from time to time, some hefty laughs from a couple well placed cameos, but for our leading lady, Queen Latifah felt out-of-place.  Her track record proves she has the talent, but this film failed to showcase them.  That said, the audience loved it.  Well, most of it, anyway.  The female teenager a few seats over appeared to be ready to walk out a half hour before it was over.  And finally, the film couldn't be more formulaic.  Not only do you know who is going to end up doing what, but the scenes play out almost entirely like you would predict.

I have not see the ""Barber Shop"" movies, although they are somewhere in my queue.  But ""Beauty Shop"" I checked out as soon as came out on DVD because it had Queen Latifah (I did not know her character was in the second one).  Alfre Woodard being in the cast was another good sign, although given the size of the cast you knew she was going to get a bit lost in the festivities, especially since both Alicia Silverstone and Andie McDowell appear in the credits above Woodard, which is not right.  But this movie is really Queen Latifah and the members of her chorus, so everybody else is going to be given one or two good moments and then join in on the ensemble fun.Her majesty plays Gina, who started out in the south side of Chicago doing thing in the salon next door to the boys in ""Barbershop 2: Back in Business.""  Now she is in Atlanta, a widow with a young daughter who plays classical piano at a pretty good music school.  Gina is working in a salon for Jorge (Kevin Bacon), but she is too real for his pretentious and she walks.  She gets a loan to open up her own salon, mainly because she knows how to style hair, especially for women who do not know what to do with it.  As a matter of fact, this movie makes it clear that Gina can handle the business.  It is the business end of the business that threatens her slice of the American dream.  Don King hair the woman can handle; it is a bad electrical system and the local building inspector that she can do without.There are all sorts of plot elements that I could describe, as well as detailing the specific characters, but none of those matter.  Gina wants to create a successful business in an environment where everybody wants to either work or get their hair done.  Yes, there are moments of crisis and confrontation, but I really think the key scenes are when things are ""normal"" at Gina's beauty shop and all that is going on is that Gina and the girls are gabbing while they work, usually listening to DJ Helen (Adele Givens), and sometimes stopping to watch Oprah and contemplate the top of the mountain.  You know full well that Gina is going to get her shop and make it successful, and if she wants Joe (Djimon Hounsou) then she is going to get Joe.

Her fellow employees love her. Jorge is constantly on her back about how it is his salon and she represents him. On a particularly nasty day she quits telling him she's going to start her own salon. Jorge laughs not believing she can make it on her own or without him.After working her salon magic on a bank agent Gina secures a loan and buys a run down lost in the 80s beauty parlour which she remodels with what little money she has. Things are going great, the clientele is growing and her staff are happy. She might even get a huge cosmetics deal with Cover Girl. Problem is the building inspector keeps showing up and fining her for things she doesn't have the money to repair. The threat of having to close her doors looms every day.Beauty shop is produced by phenomenal woman Queen Latifah who also stars as the lead character. Other headliners are Kevin Bacon as the egotistical Jorge, Djimon Hounsou as the electrician piano player who lives above the shop, Alicia Silverstone as the quirky stylist Gina steals from Jorge's studio, Andie MacDowell who plays the rich co-dependent customer and Sheri Shepherd as a pregnant stylist who stays on when Gina takes over.This isn't a split your gut laughter kind of movie but it is a hoot. Even if just to see Kevin Bacon dressed up in sparkly clothes and permed hair. This is definitely a girl power movie with lots of positive content for plus size women. One of my favourites is in the opening when Gina is getting ready for work and asks her daughter for her opinion on how she looks.""Do you think these pants make my butt look big?"" asks Gina.""Yeah.""""Perfect!"" says Gina.Beauty Shop is a comical look at one woman's attempt to make it on her own and what she can do in the face of adversity if she has a dream, works hard, takes a chance, has friends and doesn't give up on her ideals. All while setting an example for her preteen daughter. Beauty Shop is worth watching. Reviewed by M. E.

In this spinoff from the Barbershop movies, Queen Latifah plays Gina, a single mother that has relocated from Chicago so that her daughter can attend a serious music school.  The plot is paper thin, but the efforts of Queen Latifah and Kevin Bacon make it enjoyable enough to watch.After re-establishing herself as talented hair stylist under the banner of uber-stylist Jorge (Bacon), Gina (Latifah) becomes fed up with his combination of imperious behavior and comic incompetence and wrangles a loan to buy her own shop.  There's the clean-up, setup, the initial confrontation with the old staff, troubles with the state board inspector, client challenges etc.  All in all, it's entertaining enough to keep your attention, but you won't be hitting the ""back"" button if you miss anything.  So with all of this cookie cutter plot and casting, why did they have to move Gina from Chicago to Atlanta?Latifah brings charm to almost any role she plays, as far as I'm concerned.  She has a smile that can brighten a room.  Unfortunately, she'surrounded by a cast of mostly cardboard characters.  There's the naive white girl (played by Alicia Silverstone) that's trying to fit in with the black staff of the shop; the wayward sister-in-law (Keisha Knight-Pulliam, ex-Cosby kid); precocious daughter, good customer (Andie McDowell); shallow, evil customer (Mena Suvari), hunky male stylist of questionable sexual orientation, and the upstairs love interest (Djimon Hounsou).Bacon adds the most laughs as he vamps his way through the movie as the former boss and competitor.It's fun, light entertainment.

For the overall uselessness of the movie Bringin' Down da House, that one scene where she transforms into a rich, upper class type public speaker just to show Steve Martin's character that she CAN do it, she just chooses NOT to, definitely shows a side of ""black culture"" that is much more relatable to-->the fact that (a lot/most/some?) choose that because that's how they WANT to identify themselves, and it's not meant to be confrontational at heart. It's like choosing to be a goth, or a punk, or all of those subcultures almost, conformingly anticonformist, grouping yourself in a similar minded alternative.So now we have this movie, where Queen Latifa plays Gina, a stylist whiz who feels underappreciated at her job so opens her own shop, and there she shocks and appalls the neighborhood by bringing in white clientele and white employees and letting them all enjoy the scenery. It's actually one of the strongest movies dealing with integration I think I've seen, basically because when everyone gives trouble to the the white girl, and the white girl's getting upset and disturbed by it, Gina just has to say to her, ""Hey, think how I felt in a white shop."" Indeed.Plus, when dealing with those pesky issues of representation that seems to hover over every mediated creation of ""black characters"", this one is pretty broad, from the black women who refuse to work with the white woman and leave, to the young ""white-speaking"" black girl who keeps on getting hit on by the jive-talking twelve-year-old, to the African culture versed man above them who, also, happens to know a thing or two about playing good piano.And of course it would be. From the makers of Barbershop, it has that same more critical look at black culture that loves it, and yet knows what it really is and where people on ""both"" sides take it too seriously. Barbershop was actually quite a wonderful film, mostly because of it's political incorrectness, but also because of the pale-skinned barber who points out that being black is what he wants, not what he has to be born into, and Cedric the Entertainer doing his ""Martin Luther King Jr. was a HO!"" bit was just too much.Now if only this film didn't have ... well... Kevin Bacon. I thought that having Kevin Bacon in it would make it amazing, but it really, really didn't. He's just too weird for a too lightly humored film.

I just wish it could have been in a better setting.  The concept is a good one with Queen as Gina, a widowed mother working as a hairdresser to keep her daughter in music school and deciding to go into business for herself rather than continuing to be abused and disrespected by her boss (Played surprisingly well by Kevin Bacon).  Along the way, she falls for the piano playing electrician upstairs (Djimon Honsou) and has to battle her old boss and the building inspector to keep her business going.It's just too bad the writing didn't do this film much justice.  The script was very mediocre and choppy and the ghetto Southern girl stereotypes, while occasionally funny, were very predictable.  Alicia Silverstone's portrayal of the fish-out-of-water hillbilly white girl wasn't very compelling either.  While the romance between Gina and Joe was sweet, it was predictable also.  As for Golden Brooks, if you're reading this, you are officially typecast!With better writing and a little less predictability with the stereotypes, this might have been a pretty good movie.  The premise was a good one, most of the characters were very likeable and, for the most part, it was a good clean movie.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 7]","Judging from the previews, it looked about as over the top as that stupid movie Queen Latifah did as the ex-con.  But I went to see it anyway and support a movie that had the potential to be good with actresses like Golden, Queen Latifah, and Keisha Knight Pulliam.Bad News (first):  There were the stereotypes I dreaded seeing, like the sistas with way too much attitude (especially about having a white woman as a hairstylist), the two women with terrible hairstyles (AND HAIR COLOR--ex. blue & gold hair UGH!), the white woman who couldn't vibe with black beauticians until she was advised to act black, and the rest of the white women being extremely stuck-up.  The southern accents from Alicia Silverstone and the young dude from the comedy show were terrible.  The black man going for the white girl was rather typical as well.  But my major bone was with how Queen Latifah made a song about disrespecting people by calling them out their name, but threw the word b---- around like it was normal, and had the audacity to tell the other beauticians that the n-word and b---- would not be allowed. Practice what you preach (in real life and on the set).Good news:  The love interest was not only chocolate, he was African. That's way abnormal for the typical movie, and I appreciated that.  Queen Latifah's plot about leaving one bourgeoisie beauty shop to own her own was a great way of letting people know that there are struggles and there are triumphs when starting a business.  Queen's daughter who could play the piano, listen to classical music, and still have a soul sista feel to her was interesting.  The young guy from the comedy show was hilarious, as I knew he would be, and ma-an, did he have a fan club screaming in the theater whenever he came out.  I wanted to start another club for the cutie as the ex-con/new beautician employee that had a questionable lifestyle.  I like the braids as much as his usual low cut.  And what's not fun about seeing Keisha be grown?There was a guy in the audience when I went to see Barbershop who saw the previews for this movie and responded with ""I ain't gonna see that ----"" and a guy outside the theater today talking about ""I'm sure it's great cinematography"" loaded with sarcasm.  I want to tell you men out there something!  You have got to stop judging movies by sex and more by plot.Unfortunately, these guys were right.  The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was cool. But someone offered me a bootleg copy and I didn't even want it.  I never take bootleg movies becuase I like to support the actors/actresses.  But this movie was just boring to me after the first time.  I fast forwarded to the scenes with dude from Toni Braxton's video and then turned it off.  If I could change my rating now, I'd give it a two.",4,Okay,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2788,"['Judging', 'previews', 'looked', 'about', 'top', 'stupid', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'did', 'ex-con', 'went', 'see', 'anyway', 'support', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'good', 'actresses', 'Golden', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Keisha', 'Knight', 'Pulliam.Bad', 'News', 'first', 'were', 'stereotypes', 'dreaded', 'seeing', 'sistas', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'attitude', 'especially', 'having', 'white', 'woman', 'hairstylist', 'two', 'women', 'terrible', 'hairstyles', 'AND', 'HAIR', 'COLOR', 'ex', 'blue', 'gold', 'hair', 'UGH', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'vibe', 'black', 'beauticians', 'was', 'advised', 'act', 'black', 'rest', 'white', 'women', 'being', 'extremely', 'stuck-up', 'southern', 'accents', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'young', 'dude', 'comedy', 'show', 'were', 'terrible', 'black', 'man', 'going', 'white', 'girl', 'was', 'rather', 'typical', 'well', 'major', 'bone', 'was', 'how', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'made', 'song', 'disrespecting', 'people', 'calling', 'out', 'name', 'threw', 'word', 'b', 'was', 'normal', 'had', 'audacity', 'tell', 'other', 'beauticians', 'n-word', 'b', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'Practice', 'what', 'preach', 'real', 'life', 'set', '.Good', 'news', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'chocolate', 'was', 'African', 'way', 'abnormal', 'typical', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'plot', 'leaving', 'one', 'bourgeoisie', 'beauty', 'shop', 'own', 'own', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'letting', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'struggles', 'are', 'triumphs', 'when', 'starting', 'business', 'Queen', 'daughter', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'piano', 'listen', 'classical', 'music', 'still', 'have', 'soul', 'sista', 'feel', 'was', 'interesting', 'young', 'guy', 'comedy', 'show', 'was', 'hilarious', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'ma-an', 'did', 'have', 'fan', 'club', 'screaming', 'theater', 'whenever', 'came', 'out', 'wanted', 'start', 'club', 'cutie', 'ex-con/new', 'beautician', 'employee', 'had', 'questionable', 'lifestyle', 'braids', 'as', 'much', 'usual', 'low', 'cut', 'what', 'not', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Keisha', 'be', 'grown', 'was', 'guy', 'audience', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Barbershop', 'who', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'responded', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'see', 'guy', 'theater', 'today', 'talking', ""'m"", 'sure', 'great', 'cinematography', 'loaded', 'sarcasm', 'want', 'tell', 'men', 'out', 'there', 'something', 'have', 'got', 'stop', 'judging', 'movies', 'sex', 'more', 'plot.Unfortunately', 'guys', 'were', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'someone', 'offered', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'never', 'take', 'bootleg', 'movies', 'becuase', 'like', 'support', 'actors/actresses', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'first', 'time', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'scenes', 'dude', 'Toni', 'Braxton', 'video', 'then', 'turned', 'off', 'could', 'change', 'rating', 'now', ""'d"", 'give', 'two']",N/A

916198,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009X7BFK,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","After the two successful `Barbershop' movies, MGM decided to make another one loosely related to the second one. It is `Beauty Shop' which features the character of Gina played by Queen Latifah, and the location has been changed from Chicago to Atlanta with the new characters who are mostly women. You might spot some other differences between `Barbershop' and `Beauty Shop' - such as Kevin Bacon's flamboyant hair stylist sporting faux accent - but basically you may call this film `Barbershop 3.'That is not a bad thing, I admit, but probably the material would have been more suitable for a sitcom on TV. For all the strong performance from Queen Latifah, and the sassy ladies working at the shop who are all delightful to see, the lack of story and the sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu eventually slow down the film until it really stalls.To be sure, the film tries to enliven the mood of the film with several sub-plots. You can see Gina's daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd) learning to play the piano; wannabe hip-hop artist taping the ladies in the shop (Little JJ), Gina's budding romance with laconic electrician (Djimon Hounsou) and so on. Not much really works in spite of their good acting.Just like the barbershop owned by Ice Cube. Queen Latifah's beauty shop has one white beautician Lynn (Alicia Silverstone), speaking with the Southern accent. Andie MacDowell plays an uptight lady who finds spiritual comfort, and Mena Suvari is a haughty customer who has a breast implant. Sadly none of them is funny nor rings true.All in all the film is a cozy and pleasant viewing, but except for the presence of Queen Latifah, there is no reason they should make another entry in the franchise.

I must say that while Beauty Shop is a tailor-made movie for her, the flawed script didn't offer her the right stuff to generate as much of a laugh-fest as she did in Bringing Down the House. Honestly, this movie has some great actors in the supporting roles, but most are severely underused and wasted.Beauty Shop is very much like a sitcom filled with degrading racist and sexist jokes. The characters called each other names and things at Gina's(Latifah) salon during their racial and cultural clash catfight sessions. For instance, one of the stylist thinks  Alicia Silverstone was ""Blackening"" herself so that she can blend in the all Black staffed salon. Mena Suvari gets called a ""Botox Barbie"" for having breast implant, and retaliates by calling the stylist ""Miss Hip-Hop"". Kevin Bacon had a potentially juicy role as Gina's bad ex-boss who was secretly sabotaging her business, but he's rather underexposed, and his bizzare Austrian accent and curly long hair is quite striking. Andie McDowell had a low-key role as a devoted client to Gina, and she's got some serious husband issues to deal with. Her role is probably the least funny amongst the supporting players. I think Alfre Woodard was severely miscast and wasted, and she had very little to contribute to this film. As for the all-too-serious Djimon Hounsou who played Gina's love interest, he was such a misfit in the story. He was so mesmerizing in In America last year, but he's role is just unchallenging. The kissing scene between Latifah and him was kind unconvincing, because it didn't quite developed it's momentum.Overall, this film has some funny moments, but the jokes and the physical comedy were far from classy.",3,Latifah Didn't Quite Bring Down the House this Time.,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1875,"['First', 'think', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'great', 'singer', 'comedy', 'actress', 'having', 'proven', 'roles', 'Living', 'Out', 'Loud', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Chicago', 'must', 'say', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'tailor-made', 'movie', 'flawed', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'right', 'stuff', 'generate', 'much', 'laugh-fest', 'did', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'Honestly', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'most', 'are', 'severely', 'underused', 'wasted.Beauty', 'Shop', 'very', 'much', 'sitcom', 'filled', 'degrading', 'racist', 'sexist', 'jokes', 'characters', 'called', 'other', 'names', 'things', 'Gina', 'Latifah', 'salon', 'racial', 'cultural', 'clash', 'catfight', 'sessions', 'instance', 'one', 'stylist', 'thinks', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'was', 'Blackening', 'can', 'blend', 'Black', 'staffed', 'salon', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'called', 'Botox', 'Barbie', 'having', 'breast', 'implant', 'retaliates', 'calling', 'stylist', 'Miss', 'Hip-Hop', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'had', 'potentially', 'juicy', 'role', 'Gina', 'bad', 'ex-boss', 'who', 'was', 'secretly', 'sabotaging', 'business', 'rather', 'underexposed', 'bizzare', 'Austrian', 'accent', 'curly', 'long', 'hair', 'quite', 'striking', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'had', 'low-key', 'role', 'devoted', 'client', 'Gina', 'got', 'serious', 'husband', 'issues', 'deal', 'role', 'probably', 'least', 'funny', 'supporting', 'players', 'think', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'was', 'severely', 'miscast', 'wasted', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'contribute', 'film', 'all-too-serious', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'played', 'Gina', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'such', 'misfit', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'America', 'last', 'year', 'role', 'just', 'unchallenging', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Latifah', 'was', 'kind', 'unconvincing', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'developed', 'momentum.Overall', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'jokes', 'physical', 'comedy', 'were', 'far', 'classy']",N/A
