1388714,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0047P5FTK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","These comments are only about Sapphire. My thoughts aboutThe League of Gentlemen (1960) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom] are posted there.When Sapphire Robbins, a beautiful young white woman, is murdered on Hamstead Heath, Detective Superintendent Robert Hazard gets the case. Sapphire, it turns out, was pregnant. The young man who was the father, the police quickly learn, had promised to marry her. He's an architecture student with a bright future, who has just been awarded a scholarship to study abroad. His working class dad and mum and his older sister are extremely proud of him.Then Sapphire's older brother appears from the north to talk with the police. Soon DS Hazard (Nigel Patrick) is up to his ears in not just a mystery, but in one of Britain's early (1959) social conscience movies. Dr. Robbins (Earl Cameron) is a black man, as black as Sapphire was pink. ""Our father was a doctor, white,"" he says to Inspector Hazard. ""Our mother was a singer, as black as I am. You never know which way it's going to go.""Director Basil Deardon takes us on a journey into London's tidy homes and tawdry slum flats, into shops with helpful pink clerks and basement jazz clubs with brown musicians and customers. We're there with Hazard and Phil Learoyd, his detective inspector (Michael Craig), as they question Sapphire's girl friends, boy friends and her landlady. Some are black, some are white. We get know the kind of people David Harris (Paul Massie), the man who got Sapphire pregnant and who fell in love with her, and his parents and sister are.What kind of woman was Sapphire? DS Superintendent Hazard learns that she was fun to be with, an opportunist, a good friend, a false friend, something of a chatterbox, unscrupulous, a talented student at the Royal Academy of Arts, a user. Good things are said by some whites and some blacks. Bad things are said by some whites and some blacks. They all agree that when Sapphire realized one afternoon that she could pass as white, she tried to start a new life. Is this good or bad? It kind of depends on how much ""white"" blood it takes to be white and how much ""black"" blood it takes to be black. It's apparent, without too heavy a hand, that there is enough racial prejudice to go around.""Well, we solved the case,"" says Learoyd at the end.""We didn't solve anything,"" says Hazard, ""we just picked up the pieces.""What keeps Sapphire the movie from being just another dull slog through a director's good intentions are three things, in no particular order.First, the point of the movie - that racial prejudice comes from fear, ignorance, experience and custom - is handled more-or-less matter of factly. This viewer, at least, didn't feel as if he were sitting through one more dull lecture on how awful things are. There's sly, underplayed, sardonic humor to enjoy as well, usually at the expense of the nice but prejudiced Phil Learoyd, a good copper and who doesn't care for blacks. Racial prejudice, Inspector Hazard quickly learns, goes in any direction.Second, the movie looks and moves very well. Deardon may have wanted to make a movie with a message, but he also produced a movie that is professional in the best sense of the word. The message is effective but it doesn't slow down a good mystery. There are a number of candidates for the murderer and Deardon keeps us guessing. He builds interest in just who Sapphire was and why she was killed through interviews with the people who knew her, visits to London sites, modest exposition as Hazard thinks out loud and vivid looks at some complacent, some sympathetic and some rough people. Deardon even throws in a dark, desperate night chase that looks like some sort of homage to Odd Man Out. It's out of place but it's masterfully done.Third, Nigel Patrick, who gives another of his bravura performances full of class and style. Patrick was a star English actor who radiated confidence and intelligence. He was at his best playing characters that had wit and sympathy. He could handle bravery and scamming with equal charm and equal believability. Do many remember him? If you want to sample his acting and his versatility, try Trio (as Mr. Know-all),The Browning Version (The Criterion Collection)(as Frank Hunter), Breaking the Sound Barrier (as Tony Garthwaite),Pickwick Papers, The(as Mr. Jingles) and The League of Gentlemen (as Race).Am I overselling Sapphire? Probably a little. It's still a good movie.",4,"Pink, brown or in-between?

1388716,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0047P5FTK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[17, 17]","Basial Dearden, may not be one of the bigger names of classic British Cinema but in his 30 year career, the filmmaker has created 35-films.With each film, Dearden had an emphasis on storytelling and creating an atmosphere and character but also boldly taking on sensitive issues at the time which include racism, homophobia and middle-class malaise.And while many may not be familiar with the filmmaker and possibly know more about his son James Dearden (director of ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""A Kiss Before Dying""), Basil Dearden along with writer and producer Michael Relph had managed to create a good number of films which many consider today as British cinema classics but unfortunately were not as accessible on video for viewers in America.That is until now, as The Criterion Collection will be releasing ""Basil Dearden's London Underground - Eclipse Series #25', a four DVD set which include the following films: Sapphire (1959), The League of Gentlemen (1960), Victim (1961) and All Night Long (1962).After watching Criterion Collection's ""Basil Dearden's London Underground - Eclipse Series #26', I had the utmost respect for Basil Dearden's work.Watching all four of these films, I was truly blown away because although Basil Dearden never set to become an activist, his films were so bold during a time when colored people and homosexuals had no voice.  His films created a dialogue and whether or not his countrymen supported his films, he with the support of producer Michael Relph did them because they felt it was right.""Sapphire"" was a risky a film for its time.  With the UK having to go through the 1958 Notting Hill Race Riots, who would expect a film to make a statement on race relations, interracial relationships, racism.When it comes to early films that deal with interracial relationships, It was interesting to see the connection between two 1959 films, John Cassavetes ""Shadows"" and Basil Dearden's ""Sapphire"".  Both dealt with interracial relationships and dealt with women who have a more Caucasian look than Black features.While one focused on racial relationships in America, ""Sapphire"" was rather interesting because it dealt with racism in Britain.  I'm quite familiar with cases and films that dealt with racism in America but I knew nothing about what took place in the UK, nor did I know about the 1958 Notting Hill Race Riots that influenced the making of ""Sapphire"".What I enjoyed about this film is its structure but how it was bold in showing racism from normal individuals to even one of the primary police inspectors.  But also seeing the reactions to those who were white and had Black friends.  Also, showing a scene in which a Black man was running from a gang that was chasing him and trying to get help from white men to protect him.  One calls him the ""N"" word and to get out, the others were a Black couple who tell them that his kind is what gives them a bad name and to see him being beaten by a gang of white youths.  I suppose I was not expecting to see so much racism featured in this film but being portrayed in a way to evoke a response from its viewers.This was a bold, progressive film for its time.And as the film won a BAFTA for ""Best Film"", I was not surprised to find out that the film elicited many angry notices and that British cinema would become exclusively white for some time afterward.  So, in many ways, watching this film and seeing what Dearden and Relph were able to accomplish, they knew they would create a film that would not be welcomed for many whites especially those who supported the violence that was taking place in Britain at the time.It's important to note that yes, the film is less radical if shown to people today.  In fact, some comments from younger viewers were more focused on the acting of the time.  But viewers who are watching this film for the first time should put themselves in the position of a viewer back then in 1959.  Violent riots towards immigrants, violence towards interracial relationships... ""Sapphire"" was amazingly progressive for its time and I can see its importance in classic British cinema.Whether or not you believe this should of one ""Best Film"", it is an important film and worth being a notable film in Basil Dearden's oeuvre.  There is no banality to this film because nothing was like it at the time.  No one was daring enough to push the button and expose how bad racism was in their country.  Basil Learden did.While ""The League of Gentlemen"" is more of an interesting take on a heist film.For many movie fans, when many think about a heist film with an ensemble cast, many tend to think about ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001).  But in 1960, as America had it's original version of ""Ocean's Eleven"" in theaters, the UK courtesy of Basil Deadren had ""The League of Gentlemen"".While the two have similarities in that the characters are from the World War II era, the ""Ocean's Eleven"" films were more of a vehicle to showcase America's top talents working together and was more about the talent than its story.With ""The League of Gentlemen"", these were a group of friends who owned their own production studio and have worked with filmmaker Basil Deadren in the past.  And what makes this film so much more exciting is that these characters are not trying to be cool, in fact, what makes the film so enjoyable are the characters because they are flawed.  They are criminals, deviants and former military officers who have been disciplined or busted for some reason but yet, they are put together by Lt. Col. Hyde who sees their skills as important to the goal of pulling off the ultimate heist.Each character has their distinct characteristics and the way that they were written, there is good enough character development to understand these characters, their backgrounds and how they all fit into this complex group that has been formed.While this film probably would have more of an impact on those who watched it back in 1960 in the UK and saw how Britain has changed but Dearden, never afraid to take on any controversial subjects manages to have characters that are gigolos, a con-man dressed up as a priest, a homosexual (reminding everyone that during this time, homosexuality in Britain was a crime and people used homosexuals by blackmailing them and getting payment in order to not go with threats of making their lifestyle public) and those who were quite literally con-men of the worst kind.But these were all former soldiers who could not live in society after the war.  For some, while in the military, they have done unfortunate things to their own countrymen.  The life they lived after their military service was not kind to them and thus they chose to live a life of crime (or a lifestyle that was seen as deviant) or swindle someone for their money.As for the heist, one again, very intriguing and for me it's enjoyable of how methodically, and how thorough they go through the planning phase for the actual heist.  Without having to spoil too much of the story, I will say that ""The League of Gentlemen"" is a wonderful and enjoyable film.""Victim"" was a film that was an eye-opener!Prior to watching ""Victim"", I was not aware that homosexuality was outlawed in Britain.  But after watching film, I felt that the efficacy of ""Victim was remarkably captured through Dirk Bogarde's performance and Dearden's direction.  And what makes it things so sad, even 51-years-later, despite homosexuality not being outlawed today, many gay men and women are still bullied and continue to take their own lives.""Victim"" is yet another bold and provocative film by Basil Dearden and producer Michael Relph, but it's this film that created a nationwide discussion.  Slapped with an X-rating and even in the USA, where the MPAA did not want the word ""homosexual"" to be used, Dearden was aware of what homosexuals were facing under this law and how 90% of all blackmail cases were about homosexuality.At the time, one who was gay had to make a choice...pay the blackmail the money or lose everything once your outed because homosexuality was a crime and there were harsh jail sentences for breaking the law.  So, many chose to take their own lives or live their lives paying their blackmailers.There are not too many films that have an effect on society but that is what made Basil Dearden so special.  He never looked at himself as an activist but he and Relph wanted to make a difference, creating a dialogue and hopefully make things right in their country and possibly create dialogue for countries that screen his films.""Victim"" is unique, non-formulaic, bold and provocative.  It's a true Basil Dearden film with a touch of noir, not blatantly preachy and a fascinating timepiece of British cinema.The final film in this DVD set is ""All Night Long"".""All Night Long"" is another take on an interracial relationship between a Black man and white woman.In ""Sapphire"", we had a chance to see the reverse with a half white and half Black woman who looks more like the former and was killed possibly because of her race.  ""All Night Long"" is different because it's a film that revolves around jazz music and among the listeners of jazz are a mixed group who don't mind interracial relationships.  These people love the music, they love hanging out and partying together.  A much different contrast to Dearden's 1959 film.Based on Shakespeare's ""Othello"", because the film is a London-based production despite being written by Americans and because of that, they were able to create a film that seemed like an American film and not having to worry about the Hayes Code.  This kind of film would never be made in Hollywood.  For one, you have an interracial couple, you have people at the party experimenting with drugs, you have violence towards a woman and thus the film manages to maintain a feel of reality without having to be burdened with censorship.Once again, this is a bold and provocative film at that time.  Considering how strict Hollywood was with showing any interracial relationship, drug paraphernalia, even for the UK, as the 1958 Notting Hill Race Riot was ignited because of how white youths were upset between seeing a white woman and her Jamaican husband arguing. I don't know how British audiences felt about the film but ""All Night Long"" still remains one of the highlights of Basil Dearden's oeuvre.Overall, ""Basil Dearden's London Underground"" is a fantastic DVD box set.  These films still have relevance today and although we have made strides with the acceptance of integration vs. desegregation of people of different race and more and more support for homosexuals, there is still much work to do as hate still exists.What Basil Deadren was able to bring to British cinema during the roughest times in not just in the UK but in the world, watching these films today, I was not only amazed and taken back, but I feel proud to have watched cinema that absolutely moved me.""Basil Dearden's London Underground - Eclipse Series #25' from the Criterion Collection is

1388721,AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B0047P5FTK,Mark Anderson,"[0, 0]","This package contains four late 1950s and early 1960s movies by British director Basil Dearden.One of these movies is excellent, two are very good and one is a dud.The excellent movie is The League of Gentlemen, which is the movie I bought this package to get. I have not been able to find this movie as a single DVD so I bought this 4 movie package to get it.The League of Gentlemen stars Richard Attenborough, Jack Hawkins and Nigel Patrick supported by a stellar cast of British actors. The plot is about a British Army Colonel (Jack Hawkins) who is embittered at being forced to retire from the army after a long and creditable career. He spends his last days in the army going through the files to assemble a group of former officers who were experts in communications, logistics and creating general mayhem but who were each cashiered from the army for a various offences. He uses this group to pull off an armoured car robbery. Great movie, but not a well known one.The two very good movies are Victim and All Night Long.Victim stars Dirk Bogarde as a married, but gay, London barrister in the early 1960s when homosexuality was still illegal in the UK. He comes across a blackmail scheme targeting gay men and decides to do something about it, even at the risk of destroying his marriage and career by revealing his own homosexuality. A very good movie.All Night Long is about the late 1950s/early 1960s jazz scene in London and stars Richard Attenborough as a wealthy jazz fan who throws a first anniversary party for an inter-racial couple who are both leading jazz musicians, one a pianist and the other a singer. Patrick McGoohan stars as a sociopathic drummer who wants to break up the anniversary couple so he can entice the singer into a new band he's putting together. She has put her career on hold in order to focus on her marriage; Patrick McGoohan wants to break up the marriage so she will resume her singing career, preferably with his new band. The plot centers around McGoohan's efforts to break up the marriage. Some might see shades of Othello in the plot. Cameo appearances by Dave Brubeck and Charles Mingus.The fourth movie, Sapphire, is a dud. It was shot in 1956 and was clearly intended to be an anti-racism movie. The problem is that it is very dated and is full of stereotypes that are actually quite racist. The irony here is that an overtly anti-racism movie from the 1950s is full of racial stereotypes that will be quite offensive to many 21st century viewers.Bottom line: one excellent movie and two very good British movies by director Basil Deardon from the late 1950s and early 1960s, along with a really bad Basil Deardon movie from 1956.",4,Three Very Good Basil Dearden Movies In A Four Movie Package,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,2681,"['package', 'four', 'late', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'movies', 'British', 'director', 'Basil', 'Dearden.One', 'movies', 'excellent', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'dud.The', 'excellent', 'movie', 'League', 'Gentlemen', 'movie', 'bought', 'package', 'get', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'movie', 'single', 'DVD', 'bought', '4', 'movie', 'package', 'get', 'it.The', 'League', 'Gentlemen', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Nigel', 'Patrick', 'supported', 'stellar', 'cast', 'British', 'actors', 'plot', 'British', 'Army', 'Colonel', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'who', 'embittered', 'being', 'forced', 'retire', 'army', 'long', 'creditable', 'career', 'last', 'days', 'army', 'going', 'files', 'assemble', 'group', 'former', 'officers', 'who', 'were', 'experts', 'communications', 'logistics', 'creating', 'general', 'mayhem', 'who', 'were', 'cashiered', 'army', 'various', 'offences', 'group', 'pull', 'off', 'armoured', 'car', 'robbery', 'Great', 'movie', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'are', 'Victim', 'All', 'Night', 'Long.Victim', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'married', 'gay', 'London', 'barrister', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'still', 'illegal', 'UK', 'blackmail', 'scheme', 'targeting', 'gay', 'men', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'even', 'risk', 'destroying', 'marriage', 'career', 'revealing', 'own', 'homosexuality', 'very', 'good', 'movie.All', 'Night', 'Long', 'late', '1950s/early', '1960s', 'jazz', 'scene', 'London', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'wealthy', 'jazz', 'fan', 'who', 'first', 'anniversary', 'party', 'inter-racial', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'leading', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'one', 'pianist', 'other', 'singer', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'sociopathic', 'drummer', 'who', 'break', 'up', 'anniversary', 'couple', 'can', 'entice', 'singer', 'new', 'band', 'putting', 'together', 'put', 'career', 'hold', 'order', 'focus', 'marriage', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'will', 'resume', 'singing', 'career', 'preferably', 'new', 'band', 'plot', 'centers', 'McGoohan', 'efforts', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'might', 'see', 'shades', 'Othello', 'plot', 'Cameo', 'appearances', 'Dave', 'Brubeck', 'Charles', 'Mingus.The', 'fourth', 'movie', 'Sapphire', 'dud', 'was', 'shot', '1956', 'was', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'anti-racism', 'movie', 'problem', 'very', 'dated', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'racist', 'irony', 'here', 'overtly', 'anti-racism', 'movie', '1950s', 'full', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'offensive', 'many', '21st', 'century', 'viewers.Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'excellent', 'movie', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'British', 'movies', 'director', 'Basil', 'Deardon', 'late', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'really', 'bad', 'Basil', 'Deardon', 'movie', '1956']",N/A
1388722,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B0047P5FTK,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[17, 19]","Basil Dearden was a fine journeyman British director who made some very good films over the course of his long career, though none are really deemed to be ""classics"".  A possible exception is that he directed one of the stories in the revered 1945 chiller, DEAD OF NIGHT, and he was also responsible for KHARTOUM, the 1966 epic that starred Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier.As part of their Eclipse Series, The Criterion Collection has now released a 4-disc set, entitled BASIL DEARDEN'S LONDON UNDERGROUND, which contains a quartet of Dearden films released 1959-1962.  All of the pictures are well directed, superbly acted and feature engrossing stories, primarily dealing with such controversial subjects as racism and homophobia.About the only negative comment I can say about this collection is that, because all of the films are about fifty-years-old, the ways that these contentious subjects are handled are quite dated and, in most cases, are no longer valid.  Laws and public views have changed radically since these movies were made, thus they must be viewed as products of their time.SAPPHIRE (1959) is the only color film in the collection.  It stars Nigel Patrick as a Scotland Yard detective, investigating the murder of a young pregnant woman who, as it turns out, was a mulatto passing for white.Such a revelation was quite ""shocking"" to movie audiences of that day.Essentially a police procedural mystery, the film follows the efforts of Patrick and his bigoted partner (Michael Craig) as they try to find the killer.  Is the culprit one of the girl's former black boy friends, or could it be a member of her baby's father's white family, who has just learned that the victim was of a mixed race.At the time that VICTIM (1961) was made, being a homosexual was a criminal offense in the United Kingdom, thus people of the gay persuasion were perfect fodder for blackmailers.Dirk Bogarde stars as a highly respected London barrister who has tried to put his youthful sexual preferences behind him and is now happily married to Sylvia Syms.  However, he decides to risk all when a young man that he knew commits suicide in order to protect Bogarde from the people who were extorting money from him.This is a very good mystery, with a couple of clever red-herrings, which will keep you guessing right up until the identity of the main culprit is revealed.Released the same year as the Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack film, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (1960) is sort of an OCEAN'S ELEVEN, UK-style.Jack Hawkins recruits a group of former British Army officers, each with a dubious background, to pull off a major bank robbery.  Among his cohorts in this light-hearted caper movie are Nigel Patrick, Richard Attenborough, Roger Livesey and the screenwriter (later a respected director), Bryan Forbes.  [Also look for Oliver Reed in a brief, unbilled role.]Though dated like the other movies in the collection, this clever romp was ground-breaking in its time and is a welcome  reminder that the heist movie can be more than a bunch of violent sequences enhanced by CGI special effects.Perhaps the most interesting picture in the set is ALL NIGHT LONG (1962), a powerful modern-day retelling of Shakespeare's OTHELLO, set against the background of the London jazz scene.The story takes place over the course of one eventful evening, the anniversary of married musical artists Paul Harris (the ""Othello"" role) and Marti Stevens (""Desdemona"").  For his own jealous, ambitious reasons, Harris' drummer, Patrick McGoohan (""Iago""), tries to tear the interracial couple apart, leading to an almost tragic conclusion.The excellent cast also includes Richard Attenborough, Betsy Blair and Keith Michell, as well as the talents of such jazz greats as Dave Brubeck, Tubby Hayes, Charles Mingus and Johnny Dankworth, all playing themselves.
