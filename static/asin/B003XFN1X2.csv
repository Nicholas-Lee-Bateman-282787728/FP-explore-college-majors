1370556,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B003XFN1X2,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[4, 5]","Thanks to pure coincidence, I was able to view the 2009 sex comedy ""All American Orgy"" one evening on television. I found myself pleasantly surprised by clever dialog and a few hilarious situations in this clumsy independent work. With the worst title in film history (second only toPorky's), I fully expected ""All American Orgy"" to be a tasteless romp uncomfortably lowering my IQ. Instead, it's a sexually frank, challenging film detailing the intimate frustrations of a trio of late-20-something couples hoping to spice their dreary marriages.Situated in Louisiana of all places, the three couples, friends since college, decide to meet for the weekend in the country where they'll sip mojitos and participate in group sex. The couples are a mixed bag of contrasts, including Alan and Yasmine (Adam Busch and Yasmine Kittles), a bickering yuppie pair; Gordon and Rachel (Jordan Kessler and Aimee-Lynn Chadwick), an alcoholic and a belle; and Todd and Tina (Ted Beck and Laura Silverman), a rustic, earthy twosome hosting the event. It's clear early on some have lusts for others and there's even a surprise proclamation of love. But through a comedy of errors, the orgy never really takes place, though they certainly try. If this ruins the film for you, well, go rent a porn.There's some interesting twists likely intentional, most notably one of the least exotic locales one can imagine for such shenanigans. A dilapidated Louisiana lake house with wood paneling, green couches and stained curtains is certainly not the stuff of9 1/2 Weeks. The film also made a conscious effort to tone down the attractiveness of its leads, adorned in frumpy clothes with one character sporting what appears to be polyester slacks. They are unshaven, in need of good haircuts and a bit on the chunky side. Bottom line, these are not bodies one would wish to see naked in sunlight. But aye, there's the rub and charm of ""All American Orgy.""The dialog is too explicit for its own good, with some lines so bawdy as to causeSex and the City: The Movie (Widescreen Edition)'s Samantha Jones to blush. But it's accurate. We have understated scenes of flatulence, orgasms, drug use, bulges, urination, vomiting, sniffing and toe-sucking, but very little in the way of nudity. No one, it appears, really wishes to take off their clothes. But this group loves talking sex. In fact, there's barely a line of dialog not referencing the act.The film backs itself into a corner and stumbles towards an awkward and abrupt conclusion involving an unneccesary character. But I must admit I was interested throughout and enjoyed the performances, even if several roles were not properly fleshed out. Busch and Kittles have great presence displaying the talent for future success. Beck, who plays the most obnoxious character, wrote the film's screenplay. He has a good ear for comedic dialog but needs work with vision and sublety. I suppose the best way to describe ""All American Orgy"" is a low-rent version ofBob & Carol & Ted & Alice, the wonderful 1969 Paul Mazursky film detailing sexual awakenings amidst upper middle class souls. While the conclusions of both films are similar, ""All American Orgy"" lacks the poetry and universal depth of its predecessor.",3,Some Interesting Twists...,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3234,"['Thanks', 'pure', 'coincidence', 'was', 'able', 'view', '2009', 'sex', 'comedy', 'American', 'Orgy', 'one', 'evening', 'television', 'found', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'clever', 'dialog', 'few', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'clumsy', 'independent', 'work', 'worst', 'title', 'film', 'history', 'second', 'only', 'toPorky', 'fully', 'expected', 'American', 'Orgy', 'be', 'tasteless', 'romp', 'uncomfortably', 'lowering', 'IQ', 'Instead', 'sexually', 'frank', 'challenging', 'film', 'detailing', 'intimate', 'frustrations', 'trio', 'late-20-something', 'couples', 'hoping', 'spice', 'dreary', 'marriages.Situated', 'Louisiana', 'places', 'three', 'couples', 'friends', 'college', 'decide', 'meet', 'weekend', 'country', 'where', ""'ll"", 'sip', 'mojitos', 'participate', 'group', 'sex', 'couples', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'contrasts', 'including', 'Alan', 'Yasmine', 'Adam', 'Busch', 'Yasmine', 'Kittles', 'bickering', 'yuppie', 'pair', 'Gordon', 'Rachel', 'Jordan', 'Kessler', 'Aimee-Lynn', 'Chadwick', 'alcoholic', 'belle', 'Todd', 'Tina', 'Ted', 'Beck', 'Laura', 'Silverman', 'rustic', 'earthy', 'twosome', 'hosting', 'event', 'clear', 'early', 'have', 'lusts', 'others', 'even', 'surprise', 'proclamation', 'love', 'comedy', 'errors', 'orgy', 'never', 'really', 'place', 'certainly', 'try', 'film', 'well', 'go', 'rent', 'porn.There', 'interesting', 'twists', 'likely', 'intentional', 'most', 'notably', 'one', 'least', 'exotic', 'locales', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'such', 'shenanigans', 'dilapidated', 'Louisiana', 'lake', 'house', 'wood', 'paneling', 'green', 'couches', 'stained', 'curtains', 'certainly', 'not', 'stuff', 'of9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'conscious', 'effort', 'tone', 'down', 'attractiveness', 'leads', 'adorned', 'frumpy', 'clothes', 'one', 'character', 'sporting', 'what', 'be', 'polyester', 'slacks', 'are', 'unshaven', 'need', 'good', 'haircuts', 'bit', 'chunky', 'side', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'not', 'bodies', 'one', 'would', 'wish', 'see', 'naked', 'sunlight', 'aye', 'rub', 'charm', 'American', 'Orgy', 'dialog', 'too', 'explicit', 'own', 'good', 'lines', 'so', 'bawdy', 'causeSex', 'City', 'Movie', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'blush', 'accurate', 'have', 'understated', 'scenes', 'flatulence', 'orgasms', 'drug', 'use', 'bulges', 'urination', 'vomiting', 'sniffing', 'toe-sucking', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'nudity', 'one', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'group', 'talking', 'sex', 'fact', 'barely', 'line', 'dialog', 'not', 'referencing', 'act.The', 'film', 'corner', 'stumbles', 'towards', 'awkward', 'abrupt', 'conclusion', 'involving', 'unneccesary', 'character', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'interested', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'even', 'several', 'roles', 'were', 'not', 'properly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Busch', 'Kittles', 'have', 'great', 'presence', 'displaying', 'talent', 'future', 'success', 'Beck', 'who', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'wrote', 'film', 'screenplay', 'good', 'ear', 'comedic', 'dialog', 'work', 'vision', 'sublety', 'suppose', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'American', 'Orgy', 'low-rent', 'version', 'ofBob', 'Carol', 'Ted', 'Alice', 'wonderful', '1969', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'film', 'detailing', 'sexual', 'awakenings', 'amidst', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'souls', 'conclusions', 'films', 'are', 'similar', 'American', 'Orgy', 'poetry', 'universal', 'depth', 'predecessor']",N/A

Claar ""they call me Groo""","[7, 7]","It's a good movie, well written and acted, realistic situations and personalities, but so hard to sit through (and yet I did...)  It was great to see the characters click through this difficult situation, but the difficult situation wasn't really fun to witness.  For those who are wondering, there is very little sex, so if you're looking for cheesecake, go somewhere else : )  If what the writers were hoping to get across was that real orgies are a rare and unrealistic event, then I'd say they've done a great job.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's trying to find a way to dissuade their partner from trying to set up an orgy.",4,I kind of hate the fact that I liked this movie,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,666,"['good', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'realistic', 'situations', 'personalities', 'so', 'hard', 'sit', 'yet', 'did', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'characters', 'click', 'difficult', 'situation', 'difficult', 'situation', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'fun', 'witness', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'very', 'little', 'sex', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cheesecake', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'hoping', 'get', 'was', 'real', 'orgies', 'are', 'rare', 'unrealistic', 'event', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'done', 'great', 'job', 'liked', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'dissuade', 'partner', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'orgy']",N/A
1370558,A92LD431P843F,B003XFN1X2,E. Lambeth,"[5, 8]","Here you have three couples that want to get together to have an orgy, which sounds interesting to most of them in concept, but considering the women each have a problem with having sex with one or more of the guys because of how gross/douchey they are, then the orgy has a problem getting legs.So it's not a movie that has sex in it, but rather a movie about six acquaintances trying to work themselves up into a sexual situation.You have a nerdy guy and his ski-slope nosed horny girlfriend, and they aren't getting along as a couple and they brought Platypus Wine to the party. From the start, you wonder why they're together. Nerdy guy is afraid of black people. You'd think he'd have the funny lines, like the kid in Hot Tub Time Machine, but he doesn't. None of them do.You have the skinniest guy you've ever seen who looks dorky, has a disgusting sense of humor, nothing funny to say, a drinking problem, a drug problem, sleeps all the time, and of course he has the hottest girl there. Who isn't necessarily Hot, but she's so much better looking than the others that this makes her more attractive.You have the hosts of the party. David Arquette's sleazy twin and his self-loathing wife, who doesn't want to have the orgy but likes pleasing her gross husband.This review is already way too long. The dialogue isn't funny and there's nothing sexy about this flick. It's a couple losers and a nerdy guy with women they probably don't deserve, making stupid remarks back and forth, trying to get ready to do this thing that never ends up transpiring (which is probably the only thing that's decent about the movie, because it wouldn't make sense to have these 6 having an orgy). I'm guessing the highlight of the movie is supposed to be either when they're sitting in a circle saying which body part about themselves they hate the most, which isn't funny, or when David Arquette is hitting tennis balls at his stepson's tent with the other 5 inside trying to figure out what went wrong with their evening, which also wasn't funny. In the end, our hero (the nerdy guy) professes his love to the attractive one, who seemed to be into him, but you never find out if she is going to dump her loser skinny boyfriend for the nerd, or if she's going to try finding someone on her own. And it probably doesn't matter.The something that you're waiting for in this movie never ends up happening. The conversations in the movie probably won't make you laugh once. The comparison to ""Curb your enthusiasm"" is ridiculous and very insulting to Larry David. This movie is complete crap.If uninteresting dialogue among characters you'll never care about is your thing, then enjoy.",1,The lines just aren't funny,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,2669,"['Here', 'have', 'three', 'couples', 'want', 'get', 'together', 'have', 'orgy', 'interesting', 'most', 'concept', 'considering', 'women', 'have', 'problem', 'having', 'sex', 'one', 'more', 'guys', 'how', 'gross/douchey', 'are', 'then', 'orgy', 'problem', 'getting', 'legs.So', 'not', 'movie', 'sex', 'rather', 'movie', 'six', 'acquaintances', 'trying', 'work', 'up', 'sexual', 'situation.You', 'have', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'ski-slope', 'nosed', 'horny', 'girlfriend', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'along', 'couple', 'brought', 'Platypus', 'Wine', 'party', 'start', 'wonder', 'why', ""'re"", 'together', 'Nerdy', 'guy', 'afraid', 'black', 'people', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'funny', 'lines', 'kid', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', ""n't"", 'None', 'have', 'skinniest', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'who', 'dorky', 'disgusting', 'sense', 'humor', 'nothing', 'funny', 'say', 'drinking', 'problem', 'drug', 'problem', 'time', 'course', 'hottest', 'girl', 'there', 'Who', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'Hot', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'others', 'more', 'attractive.You', 'have', 'hosts', 'party', 'David', 'Arquette', 'sleazy', 'twin', 'self-loathing', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'orgy', 'pleasing', 'gross', 'husband.This', 'review', 'already', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'funny', 'nothing', 'sexy', 'flick', 'couple', 'losers', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'women', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'making', 'stupid', 'remarks', 'back', 'forth', 'trying', 'get', 'ready', 'do', 'thing', 'never', 'up', 'transpiring', 'probably', 'only', 'thing', 'decent', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'have', '6', 'having', 'orgy', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'highlight', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'either', 'when', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'circle', 'saying', 'body', 'part', 'hate', 'most', ""n't"", 'funny', 'when', 'David', 'Arquette', 'hitting', 'tennis', 'balls', 'stepson', 'tent', 'other', '5', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'evening', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'end', 'hero', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'love', 'attractive', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'going', 'dump', 'loser', 'skinny', 'boyfriend', 'nerd', 'going', 'try', 'finding', 'someone', 'own', 'probably', ""n't"", 'matter.The', 'something', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'happening', 'conversations', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'laugh', 'once', 'comparison', 'Curb', 'enthusiasm', 'ridiculous', 'very', 'insulting', 'Larry', 'David', 'movie', 'complete', 'crap.If', 'uninteresting', 'dialogue', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'never', 'care', 'thing', 'then', 'enjoy']",N/A
