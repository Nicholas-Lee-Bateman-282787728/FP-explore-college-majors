1069927,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000PC8AKU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","A solid three stars for THE LIST.Ad executive Lewis Bond (Wayne Brady) is successful, handsome, and charming. But he's got this thing about lists. He makes a list for just about everything. So when his marriage proposal is humiliatingly shot down by his girlfriend, and, damn, on live television, too, Lewis conjures up a list which would make up his ideal woman. Items to be checked off consist of the girl having to like hockey and Thai food, singing on key (and being a Marvin Gaye fan), being well-organized and bilingual and sexy. And one hundred percent real. Easy peasy, right?Several weeks later, Lewis runs into the lovely Cecile (Sydney Tamiia Poiter,Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)) in an elevator at his ad agency, and he's intrigued. It soon becomes evident that Cecile meets just about every criteria on Lewis's list. At this point, Lewis is smitten big time and proclaiming sappy things like ""I think she's the one!"" Never mind that she won't let him walk her home, or even to her car. Or that she won't give him her number. Or that she keeps wanting to take off whenever they're together. Around this time, you'd think Lewis might buy a clue. But, no, dude's simply too busy crossing items off on that list...To cut to the chase: Cecile isn't as perfect for Lewis as Lewis thinks. So how will he react when he finally discovers this?THE LIST is meant to be a heartwarming romantic comedy so odds are, it'll probably turn out alright for Lewis. The fun lies in the journey as we tune in and enjoy Wayne Brady in his first romantic leading role and Sydney Poiter simply being Sydney Poiter, meaning that she's beautiful and talented and engaging. Sydney, by the way, exudes that cool, down-to-earth vibe like no one's business, a trait she shares with her legendary father. The camera loves that tall girl. While I wouldn't say that the chemistry between Wayne and Sydney is exactly sizzling, there's enough of a connection there to make them believable as a couple. THE LIST is pretty much a formulaic love story. Nothing new or that interesting here, plotwise, and this served to disengage me a bit. The film seems to hang its hat on the two leads' performances, which are solid. Wayne and Sydney do manage to partner up in enough ""cute"" romantic moments to get you pulling for them. If cornered, I might admit to liking the karaoke scene and the Dance Dance Revolution scene best.Wayne Brady isn't about to change his stripes, isn't about to pull a fast personality transplant (like in that classic CHAPPELLE'S SHOW episode). Wayne Brady here is what you'd expect, gregarious, appealing (if a little bland), and just plain nice. Myself, I'd never found him all that hilarious, although I do think he was brilliant in WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? (but mostly for his ad-libbed singing). In this picture, he made me smile more than laugh. That's okay, though. And it pretty much sums up THE LIST, a film which will make you smile more so than laugh. And it simply wouldn't do, of course, to have Wayne show up and not sing. So the movie contrives a scene in which he duets in a karaoke with Sydney, and to Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing,"" no less.Fellow television veterans Tatyana Ali and Malcolm Jamal Warner pop in for supporting roles. Tatyana is lovely but doesn't get to do much with her thankless role. She plays the messed-up girlfriend who rejected Lewis on live television. It was pretty fun, though, watching Tatyana go into her ""Oh, no, you didn't!"" tirade. Then, later in the film, Malcolm Jamal Warner shows up and  excels at not being funny. Illeana Douglas (Lewis's secretary) and Flex Alexander (playing Chet, Lewis's best friend) also appear and don't embarass themselves (unlike Warner). A chest bump goes out to the dude who plays Lewis's underhanded business nemesis (can't remember his name, but he was funny in spots).Here's a heads-up: Now I didn't check out THE LIST when it premiered on television (May 20, 2007) as an ABC Family original movie. But the dvd I saw contained mild profanity and one brief instance in which one male character dropped trou and hello, heinie. I doubt that PG-13 stuff was shown in its entirety on the ABC Family network. I'm just sayin', if you have young ones at home with you...Next to lastly, for something similar to this theme (but gender reversed), go and check out the funnierThe Seat Filler.And, lastly, why isn't Sydney Poitier in more films? This girl can act and she definitely deserves more face time on camera.",3,"""Why can't you like football? Or basketball, like other brothers! No, you have to like hockey.
