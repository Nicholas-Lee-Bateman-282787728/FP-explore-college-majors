On the drawing board at Paramount TV was a re-do of Mission Impossible  with a whole new cast in familar roles.The networks needed programing for it 1988 TV Season. A few network exec at paramount had an idea, according toThe Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier. This is long before cable did original programing..and Tom Cruise took over the MissionsThe classic tv showMission: Impossible - Complete Serieswas canceled in 1972, what many say was due to the Watergate breaking in. Again from the reference book, the Mission Impossible DossierSomeone at Paramount had a great idea, take some old mission scripts and gently update the original classic scripts with a new cast and film it outside  of the USA, because of the strike.Peter Graves came on board as Jim Phielps. They filmed the show in Australia (where Graves previously did the show Fury) . He started with familar australian actors to American audiences like Thaao Penghlis (later on Days of Our Lives). Jane Badler (Diana from Classic show V), and Tony Hamilton (Cover up-which isnt on DVD yet). Grant Collier, yes Barney's son was played by Phil Morris, Greg's son...nice touch!Now you got a lot of the history of this show, is the shows good is the question? If you are a fan of classic Mission is lags from the pacing of the original series. Since classic ended in 1972, this show started in 1988, some of the tech has changed. Some of thrills of the show works and some failed badly.After episode five, the show tried to make its own vibe. The new show scripts are very hit and miss. The story editors were not as good as the original shows.  The quality of the original series appears in the 88 show, but some seems too slick in comparing to the original.The transfer is not as clear in the remasting to DVD, I think that is more that the original filming of the 1988 season was filmed on video tape format,  that the show was shot as. Similar to the filming of the 1970s and 1980s episodes of Dr Who.As Mission goes, it isnt a terrible as many assume the show maybe be..worth a look..especially if you are a fan of the Classic show, not the Tom Cruise filmsBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",4,Your Mission if you choose.......,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2253,"['1988', 'tv', 'season', 'was', 'big', 'mess', 'was', 's', 'major', 'writer', 'strike', 'put', 'season', 'hold', 'drawing', 'board', 'Paramount', 'TV', 'was', 're-do', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'whole', 'new', 'cast', 'familar', 'roles.The', 'networks', 'needed', 'programing', '1988', 'TV', 'Season', 'A', 'few', 'network', 'exec', 'paramount', 'had', 'idea', 'according', 'toThe', 'Complete', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Dossier', 'long', 'before', 'cable', 'did', 'original', 'programing..and', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'took', 'over', 'MissionsThe', 'classic', 'tv', 'showMission', 'Impossible', 'Complete', 'Serieswas', 'canceled', '1972', 'what', 'many', 'say', 'was', 'due', 'Watergate', 'breaking', 'Again', 'reference', 'book', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'DossierSomeone', 'Paramount', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'take', 'old', 'mission', 'scripts', 'gently', 'update', 'original', 'classic', 'scripts', 'new', 'cast', 'film', 'USA', 'strike.Peter', 'came', 'board', 'Jim', 'Phielps', 'filmed', 'show', 'Australia', 'where', 'previously', 'did', 'show', 'Fury', 'started', 'familar', 'australian', 'actors', 'American', 'audiences', 'Thaao', 'Penghlis', 'later', 'Days', 'Lives', 'Jane', 'Badler', 'Diana', 'Classic', 'show', 'V', 'Tony', 'Hamilton', 'Cover', 'up-which', 'isnt', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Grant', 'Collier', 'yes', 'Barney', 'son', 'was', 'played', 'Phil', 'Morris', 'Greg', 'son', 'nice', 'touch', 'Now', 'got', 'lot', 'history', 'show', 'shows', 'good', 'question', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'Mission', 'lags', 'pacing', 'original', 'series', 'classic', 'ended', '1972', 'show', 'started', '1988', 'tech', 'changed', 'thrills', 'show', 'failed', 'badly.After', 'episode', 'five', 'show', 'tried', 'make', 'own', 'vibe', 'new', 'show', 'scripts', 'are', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'story', 'editors', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'shows', 'quality', 'original', 'series', '88', 'show', 'too', 'slick', 'comparing', 'original.The', 'transfer', 'not', 'clear', 'remasting', 'DVD', 'think', 'more', 'original', 'filming', '1988', 'season', 'was', 'filmed', 'video', 'tape', 'format', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'Similar', 'filming', '1970s', '1980s', 'episodes', 'Dr', 'Who.As', 'Mission', 'terrible', 'many', 'assume', 'show', 'maybe', 'look..especially', 'are', 'fan', 'Classic', 'show', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'filmsBennet', 'PomerantzAUDIOWORLD']",Mission: Impossible - The '88 TV Season

(Where the hell are the rest of the series), MacGyver and of course Mission Impossible 88. Most of these series were shot on 35mm but the original film has long been lost (I Think) so the only solution is to restore old videotapes. And you all know out there what happens to videotapes after almost 20 years. They get mouldy or lost their original picture colour and sharpness.It's a shame DVD took so long to arrive. But still, there were lots of laserdiscs in the 80's and movie studios didn't care about releasing their series because it was still profitable to sell them to European and third world countries TV Studios. Some episodes were released on VHS like the Quantum Leap series or The Flash or even Mission Impossible. I still own an ex-rental VHS tape of The Golden Serpent two hour episode.Still I'm glad that this time they put English subtitles on the episodes, since it's very hard for me to see MacGyver and Cheers without them. And I do not own a Closed Captioned device. It's too bad though the entire 88-89 series did not come in the package. I though it did. They could at least have put on the cover - ""Volume 1"".

1494473,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005MQ5840,DVD Verdict,"[4, 11]","David Johnson, DVD Verdict --My crack Internet research skills tell me that the 1988 Fall TV season was besieged by a writer's strike, forcing the highers-up to seek their small-screen entertainment from the most economical sources possible.Enter this brainstorm: Recycle established scripts from the old Mission: Impossible series, update them to fit into the new decade, recast with several attractive actors, bring back Peter Graves, and call it a day.The end result is a transparently low-cost set of episodes that is rich with '80s atmosphere (and visual effects) that somehow managed to make a huge impact on a small group of teenager girls from Plymouth, NH.See, my wife loved this show. And she had friends who loved it as well. When the DVD set appeared on the assignment list, she nearly keeled over with delight; it was the 1988 version of Mission: Impossible!!!!!!I wish I could share her enthusiasm. The show eluded me when it was first aired, so this is my first time getting a taste of the worldwide sensations (literally worldwide, as the series was the one of the first to be filmed in Australia to save money). The short of it? Mission: Impossible '88 is very much like most every overdone action show from the era, heavy on shoulder pads and Aquanet, and light on storytelling and compelling action.My favorite element of this optical time capsule is the Impossible Mission Force technology. The writers opted to go bananas with the gadgets, allowing the IMF and tech wizard Grant Collier (Phil Morris, Smallville) to produce scientific advancements not even seen today. You get the trusty standby, the perfect human mask, as well as some sweet proto-laptop usage. But as the booze and caffeine pills no doubt flowed freely in the writers room, holograms and lasers made appearances. In fact, that was the IMF's primary weapon of defeating the bad guys: screwing with their heads using special effects. Hey, if it works, it works.Mission: Impossible '88 gives us 19 episodes on five discs, transferred with very little fanfare in their original full frame aspect ratio, supplemented by a 2.0 stereo mix.

The picture has lots of artifacting.. digital noise and pixelation and fuzziness.This release looks like an amateurish job at digital transfer and menus.Not the Quality I would expect for major studio's. The Box show it's released by CBS DVD and Paramount. The quality looks comparable to a bootleg. Although I am happy to have and be able to watch the episodes again.. I do feel there is no excuse for a major studio release to come out with such amateurish quality transfers. The disc menu also look like an amateur did the job. I question the validity of those who would claim the picture quality to be excellent as some have claimed. Looks like product padding from thoes who are selling/manufacturing or distributing this box set. look at the other reviews who have also claimed the Video quality is poor.... It cant be both ways. Place your trust in us buyers who are saying the quality is not very good... we have no motive to mislead.I will send letters of complaint to Paramount pictures and CBS Studios inc. stating that the video quality is unacceptable for the quality that would be expected from products released by them. I would urge others who feel the same to do the same or the Studios will think they can just get away with releasing inferior quality products and release more compromised quality products.,3,Poor Quality Digital Transfer for top studio release,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,1427,"['great', 'season', 'return', 'great', 'show', 'feel', 'god', 'very', 'shabby', 'treatment', 'video', 'quality', 'picture', 'lots', 'artifacting..', 'digital', 'noise', 'pixelation', 'fuzziness.This', 'release', 'amateurish', 'job', 'digital', 'transfer', 'menus.Not', 'Quality', 'would', 'expect', 'major', 'studio', 'Box', 'show', 'released', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'Paramount', 'quality', 'comparable', 'bootleg', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'episodes', 'again..', 'do', 'feel', 'excuse', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'come', 'out', 'such', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'transfers', 'disc', 'menu', 'also', 'look', 'amateur', 'did', 'job', 'question', 'validity', 'who', 'would', 'claim', 'picture', 'quality', 'be', 'excellent', 'have', 'claimed', 'product', 'padding', 'thoes', 'who', 'are', 'selling/manufacturing', 'distributing', 'box', 'set', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'claimed', 'Video', 'quality', 'poor', 'cant', 'be', 'ways', 'Place', 'trust', 'buyers', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'quality', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'motive', 'mislead.I', 'will', 'send', 'letters', 'complaint', 'Paramount', 'pictures', 'CBS', 'Studios', 'inc.', 'stating', 'video', 'quality', 'unacceptable', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'products', 'released', 'would', 'urge', 'others', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'do', 'same', 'Studios', 'will', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'releasing', 'inferior', 'quality', 'products', 'release', 'more', 'compromised', 'quality', 'products']",Mission: Impossible - The '88 TV Season

Someone got the great idea to recycle old Mission""Impossible scripts and film it far away from Hollywood, in Austrailia.  I watched the original Mission:Impossible from its first episode and it is one of my 10 favorite tv series.  The quality of this show did not come near the original.The casting was adequate.The great  Peter Graves was there to hold it together as Jim Phelps.  However some of the other casting was strange.  Tony Hamilton, coming off a successful stint on the excellent '80s spy drama ""Cover Up"" and once thought of as a legitimate Bond candidate, was strangely given the Peter Lupus role as strongman Willy.  Hamilton was a leading man-type.  His casting as Willy was strange.  A Lesley Ann Warren type, Terry Markwell, was the original female lead.  However like Lesley on the original show, she was thought to be too young and was quickly killed off after Jane Badler became available after V's cancellation.  The man of many faces Theo Penglis did not make me forget Martin Landau or Leonard Nimoy and Phil Morris adequately replaced his father, Greg.Its not that this was a bad show, it was just mediocre.  Not much could compare to the original series (especially its first 3 seasons.)  You may want to check it out as a curiousity item.

Among those that appeared were old favorites of mine like Star Trek, Columbo and later the Rockford Files in a more restricted ""TV movie"" format.  In my opinion those three revivals were sadly far below the original series in quality, even though the last two had the original stars.  Rockford and Columbo, although they had highly charismatic stars as actors, failed in the revival because the actors had visibly aged and had less energy to put into their roles in addition to the fact that they knew the series could not be made without them.Fortunately, the revival of Mission: Impossible in 1988 is a whole different story. Peter Graves is back in the role of Jim Phelps as head of the IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Graves did not have the ""charismatic"" image that the other two had and, as a consequence, we see his steady hand in the role which molds the rest of the team, all of whom are new actors. I can say that this revival series, unlike all the others, remains true to the outstanding original series. The other actors all hold their own with the original stars of the series.  The one possible exception was the original woman on the team, played by Terry Markwell, who was weaker in the role, but fortunately she was replaced by Jane Badler who is a more versatile actress.  Thaao Penghlis is fine in the role originally filled by Martin Landau and later by Leonard Nimoy as the impersonator and language expert of the team.  Tony Hamilton has a much wider range as an actor playing the role of ""strong man"" originally portrayed by Peter Lupus.  Finally Phil Morris, the son of Greg Morris who played technical genius Barney Collier is actually a much better actor than his father in fulfilling the same role on the IMF team.One interesting aspect of the revival series that could have been a weakness actuallly turns into a strong point was the fact that there was a writer's strike when filming began of the revival series, so several scripts taken from the original series were simply remade with the new cast and with some minor changes. I found the new, more modern interpretation using different directors of the old stories very interesting, and not at all simply a boring rehash of the original. For example, the first episode of the revival is based on the original episode ""The Killer"" and it is superior to the original. In the original, Leonard Nimoy seemed to be distracted and did not put in a very good performance, but Thaao Penghlis, in the same role is outstanding. I would say the same about John De Lancie who is ""the killer"" and is more memorable than Robert Conrad was in the original.As the season progressed new scripts were introduced and, facing the problem that all long-running series face with the challenge of coming up with fresh material there was slippage in the quality of the series. Therefore, for someone who is new to the whole Mission: Impossible concept, I would recommend starting with the original series, particularly seaons 1-5, but this 1988 season is a worthy follow-on and I would recommend it to fans of the original series.",5,The Only TV Series Revival Worth Seeing,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,3351,"['1980', 'marked', 'beginning', 'period', 'when', 'concept', 'weekly', 'adventure/drama', 'television', 'series', 'started', '1950', 'began', 'be', 'exhausted', 'so', 'television', 'producers', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'redoing', 'popular', 'old', 'series', 'more', 'modern', 'venue', 'appeared', 'were', 'old', 'favorites', 'mine', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Columbo', 'later', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'more', 'restricted', 'TV', 'movie', 'format', 'opinion', 'three', 'revivals', 'were', 'sadly', 'far', 'original', 'series', 'quality', 'even', 'last', 'two', 'had', 'original', 'stars', 'Rockford', 'Columbo', 'had', 'highly', 'charismatic', 'stars', 'actors', 'failed', 'revival', 'actors', 'had', 'visibly', 'aged', 'had', 'less', 'energy', 'put', 'roles', 'addition', 'fact', 'knew', 'series', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'them.Fortunately', 'revival', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '1988', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'back', 'role', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'head', 'IMF', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'Graves', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'charismatic', 'image', 'other', 'two', 'had', 'consequence', 'see', 'steady', 'hand', 'role', 'rest', 'team', 'whom', 'are', 'new', 'actors', 'can', 'say', 'revival', 'series', 'others', 'true', 'outstanding', 'original', 'series', 'other', 'actors', 'hold', 'own', 'original', 'stars', 'series', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'was', 'original', 'woman', 'team', 'played', 'Terry', 'Markwell', 'who', 'was', 'weaker', 'role', 'fortunately', 'was', 'replaced', 'Jane', 'Badler', 'who', 'more', 'versatile', 'actress', 'Thaao', 'Penghlis', 'fine', 'role', 'originally', 'filled', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'later', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'impersonator', 'language', 'expert', 'team', 'Tony', 'Hamilton', 'much', 'wider', 'range', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'strong', 'man', 'originally', 'portrayed', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'Finally', 'Phil', 'Morris', 'son', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'who', 'played', 'technical', 'genius', 'Barney', 'Collier', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'father', 'fulfilling', 'same', 'role', 'IMF', 'team.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'revival', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'weakness', 'actuallly', 'strong', 'point', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'writer', 'strike', 'when', 'filming', 'began', 'revival', 'series', 'several', 'scripts', 'taken', 'original', 'series', 'were', 'simply', 'remade', 'new', 'cast', 'minor', 'changes', 'found', 'new', 'more', 'modern', 'interpretation', 'using', 'different', 'directors', 'old', 'stories', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'simply', 'boring', 'rehash', 'original', 'example', 'first', 'episode', 'revival', 'based', 'original', 'episode', 'Killer', 'superior', 'original', 'original', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'seemed', 'be', 'distracted', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Thaao', 'Penghlis', 'same', 'role', 'outstanding', 'would', 'say', 'same', 'John', 'De', 'Lancie', 'who', 'killer', 'more', 'memorable', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'was', 'original.As', 'season', 'progressed', 'new', 'scripts', 'were', 'introduced', 'facing', 'problem', 'long-running', 'series', 'face', 'challenge', 'coming', 'up', 'fresh', 'material', 'was', 'slippage', 'quality', 'series', 'Therefore', 'someone', 'who', 'new', 'whole', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'concept', 'would', 'recommend', 'starting', 'original', 'series', 'particularly', 'seaons', '1-5', '1988', 'season', 'worthy', 'follow-on', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'original', 'series']",Mission: Impossible - The '88 TV Season

1494479,AFPR2BY85DFAD,B005MQ5840,Long Time Home Theater Guy,"[12, 18]","In my personal collection is a broad range of TV series/episodes on both DVD and Blu-rays that span from the earliest days of television in the 1950's (i.e. Superman; Steve Canyon; Lone Ranger) to some of the most recent programing of this decade (Smallville; Battlestar Gallactica) so I am familiar with the very broad range of possible video and audio qualitative levels available on the television series based releases out in today's marketplace, always adjusting my expectations accordingly.It was just recently that I had the opportunity (time) to finally sit through all 7 seasons ofMission: Impossible - The Complete SeriesI've had in my video library since 2003.  What most impressed me was the exceptionally high quality of each episode's video transfer improving each season even with their original film masters now having exceeded 40 years of age each.  While not a frame by frame restoration, I consider each of these 7 season's worth of DVD's to offer some of the best image (i.e. sharpness; color clarity; color accuracy; lack of DNR use; appropriate level of film grain) transfers in relationship to all other series in my collection from the same vintage.With that as my mental and visual reference, imagine my surprise and disappointment when I inserted Disc 1 fromMission: Impossible - The '88 TV Seasonand began to watch episode 1:  ""The Killer.""  For a program that was produced using nearly two decades newer technology, the image is extremely soft in overall appearance, very flat in color saturation, filled with image and lettering ghosting throughout the entire picture field.  Facials in anything beyond a medium wide shot devolves into images making it difficult to visually distinguish whom the actual actor/actress is in any particular scene.  Apparent use of additional DNR to compensate further complicates the clarity issues removing even more picture detail.  I'm totally speculating but would almost say this looks like the result of using Australian PAL 625 line/50 Htz TV video tape masters (instead of film) to produce our NTSC 525 line/60 Htz DVD masters with much of the picture information lost during the translation leading to a very trying and altogether unsatisfactory viewing experience.Just to be sure it wasn't just a problem limited to the very first episode on the first DVD, I randomly viewed other episodes on all 5 discs of this set on two completely different home theater systems and sadly, this video problem is consistent DVD to DVD, episode to episode.  While not a comment on how this 1988 version compares to the original 1960's series in terms of acting or story; it's DVD picture quality is a very sad testament of how not to replicate a product for retail consumption.  In my entire collection, I only know of one other series which I own (The Paper Chase: Season One) that approaches or exceeds the poor image quality found here.  The unfortunate result is that it'll probably be a ""while"" until MI-88 rises far enough in my viewing priorities to continue watching the remaining 18 episodes.

The show made it to the movies in more than one part. Like the higher teck mask maker. It is real now. Jeff Dunham used it to make one of his guys. Ok it was 1988.Miss Willie. The same guy that set another weight lifting record few years ago.The people they picked did very good in the show. One lady they added to team was Jane Badler you know Diana  from the first tv show V. Good pick. Also added Barney along with Jim who was in all of 1988 shows.Bad news like SOAP they cut out some shows. Also M I  a two part show  became a one part show. I am sure they missed a show or two. Who knows why?I think I remember one two part now a one part on disc.  But if it was not for flashbacks I would not be able to remember anything.Glad I bought it.  The changed dates and crap like that  drove me crazy. I pre-ordered it. I also see they are going to make M I The 89 TV Season. Hope they don't skip stuff on it. Yes I think I will get it.

Many folks who were raised on the pale imitation movies done by Tom Cruise will be confused by these, but if you are old enough to rememeber the '60's series, you will LOVE both this season and the follow-up '89 season.  I believe it was due to Peter Graves' familiarity with the main title character (Jim Phelps), and the idea of the main storyline that the 80's series was so well-loved, despite its short 2-season run.

McRae ""woohooboy""","[6, 7]","Having been a longtime fan of the revived version of ""Mission: Impossible"", I have waited YEARS for this series to be released on DVD and now that it's here all I can say is......Hmmm.......To infer that this is a basic barebones DVD release would be a MASSIVE understatement. No bonus features, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, promos or audio commentaries is something I can live without - begrudgingly. Many television shows that are over twenty years old have little supplementary material for fans to fawn over sadly enough. What amazes me (and not in a good way I might add) is the picture quality - or lack thereof. Soft and grainy would be two apt words to describe what this series looks like on DVD. It would appear no attempt was made to improve or upgrade the look of the show which is a MAJOR disappointment. In fact, the original series looks MUCH BETTER in comparsion. Not only that, but the ""In stereo where available"" tag was left on the episodes!!!. If you didn't know that this was an official release, you would think you were watching a pirated copy. I just can't believe so little effort was put into this. CBS/Paramount have done what could be politely described as a barely adequate job with the release of this series. I'm hoping the 89 season gets better treatment, but I won't be holding my breath.Getting back to the series, ""Mission: Impossible"" (Mark II) came about as a result of the 1988 writers strike. With no new scripts to commission, ABC-TV took a gamble and decided to revive ""M:I"" which at that time had been off the air for 15 years (the original series finished in 1973). To put some distance between what was going on in Hollywood at the time, it was also decided that the series would be shot entirely in Australia (which also saved the studio a considerable amount of money as well). This is where the new version of the show was able to take full advantage of location filiming - something the original series found difficult to do as it spent most of it's time confine to the backlot of Desliu studios. With the success of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (which debut the previous year in 1987), Paramount no doubt were hoping lightning would strike twice which sadly didn't happen.Once the greenlight was given to go ahead with the series, the first move made by the production team was to rehire Peter Graves as Jim Phelps and it was a smart decision. Graves easily slipped back into the role he made famous. Granted he's older, but there is a sense of maturity in place and he leads the IMF team with the same level of cleverness, experience and confidence just as he did years earlier. Thaao Penghlis is now the team's new master of disguise and voices Nicholas Black and the actor equips himself very well. Not as showy as Martin Landau, but more naturalistic in his undercover roles. Tony Hamilton is the group's new muscle Max Harte. Unlike his predecessor in the original series Peter Lupus, Hamilton is given considerably more to do. Combining rugged looks and strength, Max has a more visible role to play in the missions. In a nod to the original, Phil Morris (son of series original Greg Morris) plays the team's electronic and gadgets expert Grant Collier (who also is the son of his father's character, Barney). The younger Morris actually shows more dramatic range than his father did and puts in some fine performances.Perhaps where the new version of Mission falters is in the casting of the female agent. Terry Markwell was the show's first choice as femme fatale Casey Randall. Whilst she was certainly pretty enough, Markwell doesn't quite have the depth of Barbara Bain and out of the cast is easily the most replaceable which is exactly what happened. Depending on what version you hear, the actress either chose to leave the show of her own accord or the producers decided to replace her (I personally think it was a bit of both). Enter Jane Badler in the episode ""The Fortune"" as the new female team member Shannon Reed. Badler is a stronger presence and like Markwell is attractive yet classy enough to lure unsuspecting targets off balance.Whilst the first few scripts were remakes, the writers strike was resolved and the production team set about to work on original stories. All the prerequisite elements are in place. The tape recordings the IMF leader recieves at the beginning of every episode are now on mini-disc (a nod to the world of technology that has happened between the original and the revivial). The debriefing at the apartment where the team discuss elements of the mission thereby giving viewers a teasing glimpse into what's about to happen and then straight into the story.Highlights from the 88 season include the premiere story ""The Killer"" (featuring John de Lancie), ""The Condemned"" (guest starring Greg Morris), ""The Fortune"" - which signals the change from Terry Markwell to Jane Badler,  ""Spy"" - where the IMF face off with an adversary who is just as cunning and knowledgeable as they are & ""Reprisal"" - going up against a former IMF member who smartly anticipates the team's every move as well as featuring the appearance of another original series cast member, Lynda Day George.Because the series was shot on film and transferred to video for editing and post-production purposes, the special effects that are occasionally used are at times glaringly obvious. This is most evident in the season two premiere story ""The Golden Serpent"" but that's another story.For those who are only familiar with the ""Mission: Impossible"" films starring Tom Cruise, this series (along with the original) may seem a little sedate for your taste. But this is what Mission is really all about. A team of highly skilled agents pooling their resources and abilities together to snare their target. For those that are already familiar with the show and are fans, well I'm preaching to the choir aren't I?.......PRESENTATION: 7/10PICTURE QUALITY: 5/10AUDIO QUALITY: 7/10EXTRAS: 0/10STORIES:
