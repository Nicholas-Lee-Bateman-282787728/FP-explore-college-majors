This movie transforms a self centered, jerky actor (Bobby Cellini) in to a person that realizes that he needs to care about others before himself. I love the part with the gentleman at the bus stop and how one person can transform another person. It is a fun, sensitive, sad, and romantic movie all rolled up into one. It is a movie that makes you smile after watching.

842834,A1OEBZNL5XOKUO,B0002PUGUW,S. D. Wright,"[26, 26]","I bought this DVD on a whim, as I'd never heard of it.  And frankly, it's a cute little low budget gem that I'm glad I came across.  The nutshell is that a has-been actor, Bobby Cellini, played smarmily by Scott Bakula, has an accident after losing out on yet another role, and disappears for 6 weeks.  He returns to Hollywood to discover his ex-wife is writing and directing a movie about his life.  His ego being slightly larger than his intellect, Cellini decides to audition for the role of himself, reasoning that nobody can play him better than himself.  Although his best friend cautions that this is a very bad idea, Cellini takes on a stage name and gets the role.What follows is reminiscent of Ebeneezer Scrooge getting a look at his life in A Christmas Carol; Cellini sees the ""high points"" of his life and his relationship with his wife, Chelsea, from her point of view, and it's not flattering.  We see not only what a selfish human being Cellini was, but also the effect of acting out the movie from Chelsea's perspective has on Cellini himself.  What's nice about the performance is that there is no ""a-ha"" moment where Cellini changes; rather, we see that he is basically a nice guy who let his self-absorption and his desire for fame ruin his marriage and make him a jerk.All the performances, from the ex-wife, to the best friend, to the very funny bus stop guy, are subtle and just on point enough to nudge Cellini in the right direction.  I kept expecting some moralizing sermon, but the film never goes there.This is a sweet film; I recommend it.",4,A Good Little Indy Film,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,1567,"['bought', 'DVD', 'whim', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'frankly', 'cute', 'little', 'low', 'budget', 'gem', ""'m"", 'glad', 'came', 'across', 'nutshell', 'has-been', 'actor', 'Bobby', 'Cellini', 'played', 'smarmily', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'accident', 'losing', 'out', 'yet', 'role', 'disappears', '6', 'weeks', 'Hollywood', 'discover', 'ex-wife', 'writing', 'directing', 'movie', 'life', 'ego', 'being', 'slightly', 'larger', 'intellect', 'Cellini', 'audition', 'role', 'reasoning', 'nobody', 'can', 'play', 'better', 'best', 'friend', 'cautions', 'very', 'bad', 'idea', 'Cellini', 'stage', 'name', 'role.What', 'reminiscent', 'Ebeneezer', 'Scrooge', 'getting', 'look', 'life', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Cellini', 'high', 'points', 'life', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Chelsea', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'flattering', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'selfish', 'human', 'being', 'Cellini', 'was', 'also', 'effect', 'acting', 'out', 'movie', 'Chelsea', 'perspective', 'Cellini', 'What', 'nice', 'performance', 'a-ha', 'moment', 'where', 'Cellini', 'rather', 'see', 'basically', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'let', 'self-absorption', 'desire', 'fame', 'marriage', 'make', 'jerk.All', 'performances', 'ex-wife', 'best', 'friend', 'very', 'funny', 'bus', 'stop', 'guy', 'are', 'subtle', 'just', 'point', 'enough', 'nudge', 'Cellini', 'right', 'direction', 'kept', 'expecting', 'moralizing', 'sermon', 'film', 'never', 'there.This', 'sweet', 'film', 'recommend']",Role of a Lifetime
