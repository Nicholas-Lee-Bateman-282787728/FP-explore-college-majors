The problem is that death follows him back home.Devon Sawa is ridiculously undertalented. He has been a shame in other movies such as &quot;Idle Hands&quot; and &quot;SLC Punk&quot;, and his terrible acting did not halt for this movie. The attraction of a star like Sawa is his Eminem-esque looks and acting, and his ablity to look like a baboon when being pursued by a stalking death. With a more talented main actor this movie would score a strong 4.The plot to this movie is a simple horror, but the way it evolves from an avoided plane crash to an unseen stalker flick is a little too great of a jump to let the story flow.

The plot is tired and the characters only exist to become death fodder.People watch films like this because they think its cool watching new, novel ways to mutilate two-dimensional characters.  If that is what the viewer wants, that is what the viewer gets.  From the first scenes to the last, characters are cut, slashed, burned, squashed, and otherwise wiped out.  The director does a better than average job of filming the gore.  Even though I don't like this type of film, I have to admit I was impressed with the creativity.  I didn't know there were so many ways to film accidents.  I never suspected that an exploding barbecue grill could do so much damage.  In this particular cut and slash film the director gets to kill off the characters more than once.  Now that's a lot of bang for the buck!I have only two suggestions.  If you are watching the film with a group of friends, get some sodas and pop corn.  If you are watching the film alone, don't waste your time going through it in the usual, slow way.  It is quit easy to predict when the cool stuff is about to happen.  Keep a finger on the remote control and zoom through the film, only slowing down for the really neat stuff.

A kid has a paranormal vision of the plane he is on going down in flames.  When he wakes he panics and soon he, and seven others, is ushered off the plane.  Then the Paris bound aircraft takes off, and then explodes.  These lucky individuals have just cheated death, but death doesn't like being cheated and so, one by one, each of the survivors are picked off in eerily mysterious (and painfully manipulated) ways.  Soon, the kid with the vision (his name in the movie is Alex) starts putting two and two together and realizes that they are being killed off in the order they would have died on the plane (really?) and so they have to work together to continually cheat death and start the cycle over again.The cast is decent, but rather uninspired when you consider the genre and the casts of other films of this nature.  None of these `stars' went on to a noteworthy career.  Sawa all but disappeared (well, he did disappear) and Ali Larter may have done `Heroes', but then she did Beyonce, or Beyonce's husband (""I'll show you crazy"") so, I mean, you get my point.  The cast is mediocre at best.When your most successful star is that pervert from the `American Pie' movies then you know you're in trouble.The film is propelled by the elaborately and ridiculously intense death scenes that layer the film.  Whether a boy is getting ready to take a shower or a teacher is preparing some hot tea, this film knows how to layer on the tension.  The deaths are all different, come textured, some shockingly sporadic (that bus came out of nowhere!) and they all hit their mark effortlessly.That's why you watch these `slasher' movies anyways, right...for the diverse death scenes.The ending (in the cabin) gets rather sloppy and a tad overdone, but for the most part this film is slick and unique.  I hate what it turned into (the sequel was decent, but the third and fourth films just feel like cheap reenactments of this film, with no real life to them), but I'm happy with this film as a whole.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it.

38775,A2QA095LQPDBJD,0780631684,Ariel Escasa,"[0, 0]","Well, what do we have here? A horror movie that really delivers the scares. Looks like the filmmakers took one look at the mess of slasher films of the past 20-30 years and said, enough already, we'll come up with something different.And they did. The story is intriguing, to say the least: six students and one teacher cheat death by getting off a plane before it takes off. Sure enough, it promptly explodes. But you see, death doesn't take too kindly to being cheated. So he goes after the seven, taking them in the order they would have gone if they had stayed on the plane. The deaths are as bizarrely creative and freaky as they come. They have to be, to drive home the point that the grim reaper himself is really after these seven.Strangely, with each addition to the body count, we react with amusement almost as much as terror. Admit it, you did chuckle at these ridiculously low-probability accidents. And that's just the reaction this movie wants to elicit. This is not the jump-out-of-your-seat, screaming-good-time type of film. It's more in the way of oh-my-God-look-at-the-way-that-poor-sucker-got-done-in fun. The producers planted their tongues firmly in their cheeks and said, let's all have a gruesome good time with this. So they did. And they succeeded where few others have succeeded before: they struck that delicate balance between terror and humor.That's what makes Final Destination so much fun. It can be terrifying, but in the end, it's really just a joke. A morbid one, sure, but a joke just the same. And when we're done laughing, we can smile and say, hey, that's one cool movie.

The cliffhanger ending is truly excellent.Among the Final Destination series, this is the best. Final Destination 2 (second best) suffered (in my opinion) from a relatively happy, hopeful ending compared to this cliffhanger ending; the new life concept seemed too hopeful.

Anyway, chalk Final Destination up as one of those films that are so bad that it's so funny. The all-around acting reeks of awfulness. Poor Seann William Scott is badly underutilized in this too. The idiocy of the plot is probably the biggest problem of Final Destination. It's hard to take all of it in and keep going further. That's why I laughed so much every minute.

It was the only Post-""Scream"" film that managed to not follow that film's style and to set out to find it's own voice. I can safely say that it succeeded. The film is about a bunch of graduating high schoolers who are heading on a plane for a graduation trip to France. Lucky students!. One of the kids has a premonition while on the plane that it explodes. When he awakes and finds that things are happening like they did in his premonition, well, he freaks, and he gets himself and a couple of other students and a teacher off the plane. When what he saw happens, the surviving people who got off the plane find themselves being hunted by Death itself. It was their time and they cheated death. But you don't cheat death. You can't. And he is making sure they know that.  The sense of doom and death, without there being a flesh and blood villain, is very creepy. It definitley works. The movie managed to do that without, like I said, a killer. That doesn't happen very often. I always believe that while it is fun to have a flesh and blood killer, and to see the likes of Freddy, Michael, and Jason, the real fear and terror is in what you don't see. This films takes that and runs with it. The actors are all good with the subject material they are given. Ali Larter is a real find. She plays Clear Rivers, a shy type who really grows and blossoms throughout the film. Kerr Smith was perfect as an annoying bully. You really wanted him to die. Does he?. Well, you'll have to watch. ""American Pie"" star, Sean William Scott, also appears in the film. As does ""Candyman"" star, Tony Todd. He and Larter are the only ones to return for the sequel. But the main star is teen pin-up, Devon Sawa. I am by no means a fan of this guy, but he does a fairly decent job as the film's main victim, Alex Browning. The movie has many clever set pieces. Some of the set ups and of the deaths are quite clever and intelligently shot. The sequel, however, went even further and the kills and inventiveness have gone up several notches. It was shot great and looks sharp. Do yourself a favor....See this!.

This film is known for the infamous plane disaster and established a killer that it is very hard to stop - death itself.  And the death scenes here are very inventive.  You will be jumping out of your skin.  This film has suspense and thrills to the perfect combination with some pretty good acting.So why the 3 stars?  This is a review of the blu ray and this is honestly a terrible blu ray transfer.  It adds nothing to the quality of the dvd and the viewing experience looses much of its impact due to its poor quality.  The 1080p video is very dark, colors have no vibrancy and there is no detail or clarity that one would expect from a blu ray.  There is graininess which is expected for a film of this age but this added with the lackluster presentation makes for a subpar viewing experince.  The audio also lacks.  It is a little better than the video but nothing to praise.  Right from the first shot you know the video is off and the plane explosion looses all impact due to the poor video transfer and audio.  I was so let down.Sadly, if you purchase this as I did hoping to watch all your favorite scenes in the vividness of blu ray you will be very disappointed.  I have never seen a blu ray transfer where the video was so dark and lacking in clarity compared to the original.

It's significantly better than the third Final Destination movie (that's the one with the carnival and roller-coaster ride segment, right?  I like this one a LOT more).The only flaw with this film is that the first 20 minutes start off rather predictable, but give the story some time to develop and I believe you'll find yourself really getting into it.Maybe it's just me, but I found it kind of disrespectful that they'd keep playing John Denver's classic ""Rocky Mountain High"" throughout the film.  The song plays whenever something bad is about to happen.It's disrespectful because, as you probably know, John Denver lost his life in an airplane accident a few years before this movie was created and released.  The writers should have honestly picked a different song.Now about the storyline.  Are you the kind of person that believes you can cheat death?  If so, do you believe if you happen to cheat death that death will rear its head shortly after in ANOTHER attempt to take your life?  These are the kind of serious and curious questions that many of us probably ask ourselves, and these same questions are the reason this kind of horror is a few steps above the generic slasher kind (and honestly, slasher flicks are the kind of horror stories have been done to the point of exhaustion by this point).I often wonder about these questions personally, though obviously it's important not to let these questions interfere with enjoying your life.

38783,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,0780631684,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[2, 2]","""Final Destination"" caught me completely by surprise. After watching the trailer I figured it to be another typical teenage driven horror movie with little substance or unique qualities to set it apart from the pack. I'm really glad I gave it a go after reading a few good reviews though, as it turned out to be so very much more than that. This is a rare and wonderful case where an at most decent idea is turned into a really fantastic film due to good performances, direction and great scripting.Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say that Alex manages to avoid death under very strange circumstances. In doing so, he also saves the lives of five of his schoolmates as well as his teacher. But when one of those near-victims then dies soon after, Alex starts to fear that perhaps by cheating death, Death itself is coming back to set things straight. Sounds silly right! Well I guess it is, but it works really well in ""Final Destination"" and that's a credit to director James Wong and his cast and crew.When any and every normal item and scenario suddenly becomes an opportunity for Death to end your existence, life itself becomes a terrifying experience. The creators of this movie had a huge amount of fun with the setup, constantly placing obvious dangers in front of the characters only to have them harmlessly pass them by. Over and over you will find yourself thinking ""he's turned the radio on in bathroom, he's gonna get it!"" or ""that gas has been on for far too long for her to light it, this is it for her!"" only to have nothing happen. There are some brilliant scenes in ""Final Destination"" based on this uncertainty and each one finishes with highly creative and often unexpected death scenes.The cast are great and in particular Devon Sawa and Ali Larter in two of the main roles. But everyone plays their part in the scenario successfully except for perhaps Seann William Scott who funnily enough went on to be the most successful actor. He hadn't quite perfected his goofball antics at this point and while he's mildly amusing, he far more regularly appears to be quite pathetic and annoying. Tony Todd (of Candyman fame) has an unforgettable cameo which was a nice touch also utilizing a legend of the genre.There's a real sense of fun to proceedings even though death is a rather serious topic and that's due to the creators not taking things too seriously themselves. They are playing with you as an audience and rather than frustrating everyone as could so easily have occurred, you'll find yourself happily going along for the ride. This movie was a complete success and with two sequels already released to both financial reward and fan praise, we may not have seen the final Final Destination just yet.",5,A decent idea turned into a fantastic horror film!,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2749,"['Final', 'Destination', 'caught', 'completely', 'surprise', 'watching', 'trailer', 'figured', 'be', 'typical', 'teenage', 'driven', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'substance', 'unique', 'qualities', 'set', 'apart', 'pack', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'gave', 'go', 'reading', 'few', 'good', 'reviews', 'though', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'rare', 'wonderful', 'case', 'where', 'most', 'decent', 'idea', 'turned', 'really', 'fantastic', 'film', 'due', 'good', 'performances', 'direction', 'great', 'scripting.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Alex', 'avoid', 'death', 'very', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'doing', 'so', 'also', 'lives', 'five', 'schoolmates', 'as', 'well', 'teacher', 'when', 'one', 'near-victims', 'then', 'soon', 'Alex', 'fear', 'perhaps', 'cheating', 'death', 'Death', 'coming', 'back', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'silly', 'right', 'Well', 'guess', 'really', 'well', 'Final', 'Destination', 'credit', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'cast', 'crew.When', 'normal', 'item', 'scenario', 'suddenly', 'opportunity', 'Death', 'end', 'existence', 'life', 'terrifying', 'experience', 'creators', 'movie', 'had', 'huge', 'amount', 'fun', 'setup', 'constantly', 'placing', 'obvious', 'dangers', 'front', 'characters', 'only', 'have', 'harmlessly', 'pass', 'Over', 'will', 'find', 'thinking', 'turned', 'radio', 'bathroom', 'gon', 'get', 'gas', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'light', 'only', 'have', 'nothing', 'happen', 'are', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'Final', 'Destination', 'based', 'uncertainty', 'one', 'finishes', 'highly', 'creative', 'often', 'unexpected', 'death', 'scenes.The', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'particular', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'two', 'main', 'roles', 'everyone', 'part', 'scenario', 'successfully', 'perhaps', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'who', 'funnily', 'enough', 'went', 'be', 'most', 'successful', 'actor', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'perfected', 'goofball', 'antics', 'point', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'far', 'more', 'regularly', 'be', 'quite', 'pathetic', 'annoying', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Candyman', 'fame', 'unforgettable', 'cameo', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'utilizing', 'legend', 'genre.There', 'real', 'sense', 'fun', 'proceedings', 'even', 'death', 'rather', 'serious', 'topic', 'due', 'creators', 'not', 'taking', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'playing', 'audience', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'everyone', 'as', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'occurred', ""'ll"", 'find', 'happily', 'going', 'ride', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'success', 'two', 'sequels', 'already', 'released', 'financial', 'reward', 'fan', 'praise', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'final', 'Final', 'Destination', 'just', 'yet']",N/A

Though even more implausiable than most other Dead Teenager Films (DTM)  including: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (Ugh!), Jason Goes to  Hell: The Final Friday (Gag!), Bride of Chucky (Pinch me am I really  awake?) and Dangerous Minds (I've fallen and I can no longer watch! ).  Wong's poetically melancholic voyage regarding the teenage conception of  human mortality, the randomness of fate, and the human philosophical  pursuit of the existence of God has much more dramatic resonsence and  emotional impact than any other other traditional slasher film in the  Scream generation of horror films. Wong allows his characters to bloom into  real terrified people that have to deal with the possibility of death  during the age of presumed teenage invurneribility. There have been several  complaints  that Final Destination indulges on self-conscious campy humor  and the overuse of conventinal Slasher movie techniques. No offense to  horror movie junkies, but the Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and Scream series have so ingrained  random teenage death into modern pop-culture that  audiences are so  conditioned to that presentation that anything similar is too convential or  petty for their viewing. As for the film's humor, it is needed to keep the  film's somber mood at bay. Get past your overdose of cinematic filth and  give this stellar movie a chance. The film is traditional in both its  pacing and conclusion, but the film's genuine interest in theology,  philosophy, and the unique design of fate transforms this movie into a  tremendously absorbing visit into the paranormal.

Now, Death has returned to reclaim the victims that escaped their fiery demise... FINAL DESTINATION: The ultimate excuse for contrived screenwriting! The FINAL DESTINATION series gave the typical Teen Slasher an all-new angle that moves away from the hockey-masked killer and into the realm of the supernatural. The films are always about surprise and anticipation, not so much in regards to who is going to die, but when and how. The first FINAL DESTINATION provides thrilling shocks in every death that defy audience expectations. Clever clues are laid out for both the characters and the audience to determine the next method of execution, and yet each death arrives with a sudden jolt. Director James Wong puts together another clean-cut cast of familiar teen faces, with Devon Sawa in the lead as the paranoid Alex Browning and Ali Larter chasing closing behind him as the stereotypically strange and misunderstood Clear Rivers.

Final Destination plays with the teen slasher conventions a little bit (before they fell into the uber-gory camp with the sequels) but ultimately it still fits and despite some problematic script issues, it's still an effective horror film at times.Alex Browning is a kid in a French class boarding Flight 180 en route to Paris. Just after takeoff, the plane's side rips off and it explodes. Of course it wasn't real as Alex just had a premonition and his erratic behavior and rantings of planes exploding is met with hostility from 5 of his classmates, his teacher and the staff and they're forced off the plane. Imagine everyone's shock when the plane actually indeed explodes in mid-air. But Death is mad as the all-powerful beings grand scheme of when people die was disrupted so he's hunting them one by one.Main issue with the script is that the premise is intriguing but let's face it: it's still an oddball concept. Why would Death have flaws in its plan, even if we could see the signs? You'd think someone who has such a foresight and knowledge of fate wouldn't have things mess up easily. Alex almost becomes a gifted crime fighter with his know-how on how to beat death but it's a horror movie and it never makes sense. Plus he catches on incredibly quick to the idea that Death is playing hitman now that it seems kinda laughable he figured it out at all.In a way, Final Destination reminds me of the first 2 Jurassic Parks while its sequels are like the third Jurassic installment: there's a sense of seriousness with this one and the Spielberg films whereas part 2 and 3 basically made it a thrill-ride and the gore almost becomes the reason to see it whereas this film was based on atmosphere and it does have a sense of foreboding.

It is the story of a 17-year old named Alex Browning (played vicariously by Devon  Sawa, who I see going somewhere) who forsees the plane of his senior class  trip exploding before takeoff.  Him and a few others are ejected from the  plane, which they saw explode from inside the terminal, and are then marked  because they had cheated death.  Alex tries to solve the pattern so they  can cheat death again.I can't say much about this film because  absolutely *nothing* can be ruined.  The deaths scenes are fascinating and  extremely elaborate.  The squeamish and/or faint of heart should probably  steer clear of this one.  The fear of the characters seems real, because  they all are sure that one will die next but never who or how.  How it  happens is unbelievably clever every single time.  Sometimes you think you  can see the method of end coming, but you will more than likely be wrong,  which is the beautiful part.  The suspense is nerve wracking and heart  skipping, and sometimes so surprising that I am still shocked.Besides  the suspense, this film also offers a deeply investigated look into the  world of death.  Alex tries to decipher the pattern and attempt to stop  death from taking the next person.  It is an intelligent premise, and is  presented with impressive results.

Devon Sawa (Idle Hands) plays Alex, a high school student on a class trip to Paris who after having a premonition that the plane's going to crash gets off along with a handful of his unwilling classmates.  When the plane actually does crash, he finds himself under suspicion by the FBI, a suspicion which grows more intense as the rest of the departed students wind up dying off one by one.  The first half hour consists of one of the best plane crashes ever caught on film and some pretty spooky stuff that allows the tension to mount until Death pays them a visit.  It's a clever spin on a movie that was originally concieved of as being your typical slasher film but thanks to X-File alum James Wong and co-scibes Glen Morgan &amp; Jeffrey Reddick averts that all-too-beaten path.  Some of the typical beheads, what-have-you plague a story that should be above that kind of stuff but it's what the kids like and with today's special effects even the most overdone scenes can be flipped on their ears.

38808,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0780631684,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Final Destination manages to find its own little niche among psychological thrillers such as Scream and The Sixth Sense.  With X-Files veterans James Wong and Glen Morgan at the helm, the movie is all but guaranteed to be entertaining and gripping.  The plot works well as a whole, but some of the minutiae and details may make your brain hurt if you try to delve too deeply into them.  Some impressive special effects and exquisite timing squeeze as much fun as possible out of the twists, turns, and thrills collected here, and the actors play their roles quite convincingly.Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) obviously does not love to fly, but he shakes off several bad omens to board the plane taking a large group of his classmates to Paris.  Just before takeoff, he has a premonition of imminent disaster and ends up getting himself, five classmates, and a teacher, thrown off the plane.  While his fellow stranded travelers tell him off and ridicule his claim to have somehow seen the plane explode after takeoff, the plane does indeed explode just as Alex predicted.  These six other people seem more upset than grateful to Alex for having essentially saved their lives, and he finds himself a social outcast and even a person of interest to the FBI.  Things only get worse from here.  His circle of seven survivors begins to die off one by one, and Alex begins to see a pattern in these events.  He comes to believe that he somehow messed up Death's plan, and now Death is coming to claim the lives of the seven who were supposed to die in the plane crash.  He figured out that plan once already, and he is determined to figure out whatever new design Death throws at him.  If he and any of his friends are to survive, Alex must outsmart the Grim Reaper yet again, a tough task indeed.There is not as much character development as I would have liked in Final Destination, but this does keep one from getting too attached to a character slated to die.  The relationship between Alex and Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is especially ambiguous.  One character really stands out in the movie, despite his relatively short appearance: Tony Todd (of Candyman fame).  He plays a disturbingly dark, strange mortician whose ruminations about death really push the horror aspects of the movie to a higher level.  The death scenes are, for the most part, quite delightful.  One in particular occurs so suddenly and out of the blue that you have to just stop and give the moviemakers a little love.  A decapitation scene came off a little unrealistically, but all of the other special effects were quite impressive.  I have to say I really love the ending of the film; it is such a rare thrill to see a cold-blooded concluding moment rather than a sappy fairy tale ending.Speaking of fairy tale endings, that is exactly what the first cut of this movie had, along with a romantic element that ultimately found itself on the cutting room floor.  Not only can you see the deleted scenes and alternate ending on the DVD, you can learn the reasons why the changes were made.  The DVD includes a short documentary discussing the screen tests done for the film; as a result of these screen tests, the movie was altered rather dramatically in order to better please the intended audience.  This documentary provides some great insight into how movies actually get made.

They fail miserably, of course, but it's fun to see them try. Bad dialogue, bad acting, and a ridiculous plot should never add up to something entertaining, yet sometimes, by some miracle they do. That's how we get guilty pleasures.&quot;Final Destination&quot; is just this type of film. The writers try to set up a debate on determinism versus free will and end up with some real howlers. Emotions are shown with a clenched face and too many uses of the f-word. Male lead Devon Sawa in particular is way too earnest in his portrayal of the precognitive high-schooler Alex, whose predictions get 7 people off a doomed plane and land them at the top of Death's list. And you would think Death would do better than to copy slasher boogeymen, but you would be wrong.But director James Wong and his cinematographers seem to understand it's all a sick joke (with, by the way, one hell of a punchline in the final second). A filmic McGyver, Wong seems to relish turning cups of vodka, computer monitors, and dishtowels into instruments of over-the-top carnage.

Litton,"[6, 9]","While most will complain about the teenage mentality behind the plot of the movie &quot;Final Destination,&quot; I find it very refreshing that the movie has an entirely new story that has never been used before, and it is executed well. Sure, the characters in the movie may all be teenagers, but at least the ones in this movie are smart enough to figure out what is happening to them and not running around screaming to give themselves away to a killer.Not many movies actually have Death as a character in them. People die, but you never think about Death being the one who is doing the killing. It's always a slasher/stalker, or some deranged psycho who feels he is owed something from the person he intends to kill. That is what makes this movie very inventive and unique, and watchable.Alex Browning and all of his senior class are going to Paris, and all is good. But once on the plane, Alex has a dream about the plane taking off and exploding in flight, killing everyone on board. He wakes up and begins thrashing and screaming that they are all going to die, which begins a fight that takes six people off the flight, five students and a teacher. As they continue arguing in the terminal, they become witness to the horrific explosion of the plane just seconds after it lifts off. Alex is terrified, while the others don't know what to make of the entire situation. Once out of the airport, they are questioned by police as to the nature of the incidents before the disaster, and the detectives begin to suspect Alex of foul play. Soon after, one by one the people who departed from the plane are being killed in mysterious ways, and when it looks like Alex is going to be charged for murder, he runs into hiding and tries to figure out a way to cheat the plan that Death has for them.The movie does have a credible amount of suspense, but ultimately will fall short in the end. One must question why so many horror/thriller movies have bad endings; it seems to be that way with a lot of movies these days. I personally don't know why they did not just leave the ending out completely and leave it at the part where they finally cheat the pattern. It would make a lot more sense. Nonetheless, the movie does deliver on the basis of original plot, acting and intensity, which is pleasant enough.Actors have been selected very nicely, and it's more than refreshing not to have to see teen horror moguls Sarah Michelle Gellar or Neve Campbell pop up here. Instead, the casting director chose to use somewhat new talents like Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith and Ali Larter, who is always a joy to watch onscreen.

He awakens startled by the lightmare,  to find that he indeed is on the same plane, as a couple of subtle cues are revealed to confirm his vision. He panics, & is escorted off the plane along with his friend, a nemesis-antagonist,  his girlfriend, & a beautiful solitary girl who decides, luckily for her, to heed his warnings, although she also has a touch of clairevoyant sensitivity herself. As they are detained by security, they all witness the said aircraft explode in the air. Subsequently, all those that are involved with the clairevoyant meet with a gruesome fate.Of note, one girl, depressed by the events, seeks to alleviate her mind with a mugful of vodka, but the mug mysteriously forms minute cracks which leaves a trail from the kitchen t the den area, where lays the PC - several drops cascade into  the monitor causing a spark, & eventually an explosion, which sends a shard of glass into her neck, causing her to bleed profusely, upon which she slips & slides on her own blood, stumbling towards the kitchen, where the cutlery falls into disarray; at this point, a shower of sparks ignites the trail of vodka, & the fire persues her until she is aflame, after which a butcher knife dislodges from its holster, dropping down, impaling her.Such scenes typify the ghoulish deaths throughout the film, all of  which are deserving of a D.O.A. {Drac's Overkill Award}. No matter how much each survivor of the plane crash tries, The Grim Reaper takes His due in abundance.Also mentionable, is the death scene of his friend, who is hanged by the bathtub shower cord - the `water' which he slipped & fell upon seemed to follow him around the bathroom as an sentient organism.The clairevoyant seems cursed from the beginning, a complete blight / pariah.His one-time nemesis now recognizes that they must cooperate together to attempt to supercede the morbid course of events, but is eventually decapitated after urinating on himself after being rescued from a deadly game of chicken with a train. As hard as they tried, the seatbelt would not disengage, & even the locks settled in to ensure his demise, but at the last moment, the clairevoyant managed to rescue him.And the very last victim is spared only because of the self-sacrifice of the clairevoyant, thus breaking the chain.This film is recommended, as it is highly amusing, & will give one a couple of moments to ponder. The death scenes are excellent, particularly in the various twists & turns upon which they come about, & leaves one ironically prognosticating what the next great overkill will be.",5,The Grim Reaper takes His due...,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2878,"['film', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'named', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'undercurrent', 'dynamic', 'occurring', 'composing', 'entire', 'plotline.A', 'planeful', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'France', 'prepare', 'take', 'off', 'one', 'students', 'morbid', 'vision', 'dozing', 'off', 'craft', 'will', 'dismember', 'burn', 'startled', 'lightmare', 'find', 'indeed', 'same', 'plane', 'couple', 'subtle', 'cues', 'are', 'revealed', 'confirm', 'vision', 'escorted', 'plane', 'friend', 'nemesis-antagonist', 'girlfriend', 'beautiful', 'solitary', 'girl', 'who', 'luckily', 'heed', 'warnings', 'also', 'touch', 'clairevoyant', 'sensitivity', 'are', 'detained', 'security', 'witness', 'said', 'aircraft', 'explode', 'air', 'Subsequently', 'are', 'involved', 'clairevoyant', 'meet', 'gruesome', 'fate.Of', 'note', 'one', 'girl', 'depressed', 'events', 'alleviate', 'mind', 'mugful', 'vodka', 'mug', 'mysteriously', 'minute', 'cracks', 'trail', 'kitchen', 'den', 'area', 'where', 'PC', 'several', 'drops', 'cascade', 'monitor', 'causing', 'spark', 'eventually', 'explosion', 'shard', 'glass', 'neck', 'causing', 'bleed', 'profusely', 'slides', 'own', 'blood', 'stumbling', 'kitchen', 'where', 'cutlery', 'disarray', 'point', 'shower', 'sparks', 'trail', 'vodka', 'fire', 'aflame', 'butcher', 'knife', 'holster', 'dropping', 'down', 'impaling', 'her.Such', 'scenes', 'typify', 'ghoulish', 'deaths', 'film', 'are', 'deserving', 'D.O.A', 'Drac', 'Overkill', 'Award', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'survivor', 'plane', 'crash', 'tries', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'due', 'abundance.Also', 'mentionable', 'death', 'scene', 'friend', 'who', 'hanged', 'bathtub', 'shower', 'cord', 'water', 'slipped', 'fell', 'upon', 'seemed', 'follow', 'bathroom', 'sentient', 'organism.The', 'clairevoyant', 'cursed', 'beginning', 'complete', 'blight', '/', 'pariah.His', 'one-time', 'nemesis', 'now', 'must', 'cooperate', 'together', 'attempt', 'supercede', 'morbid', 'course', 'events', 'eventually', 'decapitated', 'urinating', 'being', 'rescued', 'deadly', 'game', 'chicken', 'train', 'As', 'hard', 'tried', 'seatbelt', 'would', 'not', 'disengage', 'even', 'locks', 'settled', 'ensure', 'demise', 'last', 'moment', 'clairevoyant', 'managed', 'rescue', 'very', 'last', 'victim', 'spared', 'only', 'self-sacrifice', 'clairevoyant', 'thus', 'breaking', 'chain.This', 'film', 'recommended', 'highly', 'amusing', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'couple', 'moments', 'ponder', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'various', 'twists', 'turns', 'come', 'one', 'ironically', 'prognosticating', 'what', 'next', 'great', 'overkill', 'will', 'be']",N/A

When he wakes from his nightmare, he does something that he also did in his dream and in a hysteric fit, proclaims that the plane was going to explode.

I'm sure this has happened before, but let me explain why I like this stupid movie/DVD as much as I did; ** = mild spoiler.What makes it stupid?-suspend disbelief very hard.  Psychic phenomenon is pretty well documented, but never in such an extreme or systematic way as far as I know.  I really had no problem with this aspect of the film.-**A mortician who just happens to know way too much.  This guy appears in one scene out of the blue.  He basically is good friends with death and so, knows how everything works.  Oh, and he's a real nut job to boot.  This was the single most stupid and overly convenient caveat in the film.-**Death as a shadowy entity was really not necessary.  This aspect kind of dumbed things down a little too much.  I expect some dumb stuff in horror films.  This was overt and lame.-Some of these kids hate each other and we never know why.  This is probably my single biggest beef about the acting/script/story.  The whole rivalry thing was forced and over-blown (and otherwise unnecessary).-The authorities, as usual, are idiots; Very clich&eacute;.-One giant plot hole **(In what order did the other passengers die?).So, what makes it clever?-**The entire concept of cheating death and the rules that go with it.  The mortician conveniently explains the rules and the kids go with it.-**The methods of making people un-alive (here's where Rube Goldburg comes in).  One little act or defect leads to a ridiculous and entertaining chain of events.  Trying to stop death is like playing wack-a-mole the size of a pool table.  You had better be quick.-Despite the ""hate"" thing, emotions and dialogue usually seam reasonably believable.  Different personalities react differently; Decent acting for a film of this type.-Special effects are well done.  You may never again want to fly after seeing the opening sequence.-Overall, a well made quality production.About the DVD:-limited extras; lame deleted scenes, ""when will you die?"" game (always march 19th no matter what I put in), ""are you psychic?"" game, Good documentary about a psychic investigator in California.-An insert.  No, really.  An actual paper insert.  These days; stunning.-screened image on disk (again, stunning.)-good sound, good image.",4,Rube Goldburg reinvents the scythe.

When he causes a scene on the plane, he, aswell as several classmates, are also removed for variousreasons.

The concept and execution of the film, in terms of story, is excellent. It is one of the more original ""horror"" movies in that there is not an ""actual killer"" but the concept of a killer in death. I would have given this 5 Stars, except there are so many continuity issues with the film that is is hard to believe that Wong or the editor of the film did not discover them.First, let's look at the actual explosion of the plane. As the ""model"" of the plane ""explodes"" (this is when they are all in the terminal after Alex had his ""vision"") a real plane would disintegrate in a matter of seconds.  In this shot, there are ""flames"" in the sky as the plane ""explodes"" yet the plane for the entire shot it is in one piece then suddenly vanishes. This is a major error on reality, and in a scene like this there can not be any ""poetic license.""Second, the memorial scene.  As they all walk up to pay their respects, the kid in the background who is singing and playing guitar is not always doing either.  He is suppose to be the person you hear through the entire scene yet in some shots you hear him, but  as the camera touches on him at times, he is doing neither. Again, I understand ""poetic license"" but this should have been caught by Wong or the editor.  My assumption is the did not plan on someone looking at and stopping the movie to look at the details.Third, Terri's death scene with the bus.  This is the most blatant. Prior to her ""death"" you see Alex and Clear sitting outside the coffee house on the corner where Terri is to be killed.  CLEARLY across the street the road is closed due to construction. So there is no traffic coming in a perpendicular direction from where they are sitting.  When Terri gets ""hit by the bus"" the bus is clearly coming at a straight line (meaning on the closed street), as no bus can make a turn at that speed and not tip over. While a great scene it is totally inaccurate.

38831,AI345DWOQT367,0780631684,faith star,"[1, 1]","Here is a movie that maintains captivating drama and suspense, despite a premise as bizarre and absurd as thinking Trick-or-treat is an airplane. A high school kid getting ready to fly to Paris on a field trip has premonitions that the plane will crash. He and several others get thrown off as a result. When they survive as a result when the plane does crash, death comes back with a vengeance to stalk these victims it missed, and it seems their odds are grim. Perhaps the best reason to see this is to see impressive and then seemingly promising young actress Ali Larter at the zenith so far of her career. We might hope that her career will rise again, but it has some recovering to do. Before this she was wasted in the lame slashfest HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, and after this she went on to be almost as wasted as the murder defendant in the turgid misfire, LEGALLY BLOND. After that the best thing to her name is her role in JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK. That movie has offbeat charm and her role is not without its bizarre merits, but let's face it: It ain't a role with ""positive career move"" written all over it. So, here we have Ali at the once and possibly always zenith of her career, in the present movie as the bizarre-named character Clear Rivers. Watch and enjoy this suprisingly watchable flick.

38833,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0780631684,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was ""Scream"".  ""Final Destination"" has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dressed up in some kind of costume.  Using ""Death"" as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance.  There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope.  The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality.  On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.

This scene is totally unrealistic (I know it's not suppose to be real, but sheeesh)and was dragged out entirely too long, which makes it lose it's effectiveness of being a thrilling moment (I mean, how long do we expect someone to continually scream before we start looking at our watches and begin impatiently whistling).That being said, I still say this movie stands above some of the so-called thrillers out there of this type (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc). The notion that this movie promotes is that one probably shouldn't mess with fate because, in the end, it will eventually catch up with you. The high school student who sees the tragic events before they happen just does a little too much to try to secure his fate once he figures out he has this power and, before long, he is helpless against it because he has altered things.Overall, a so-so movie.

Before he enters it, he starts seeing visions, premonitions and strange allucinations that force him to believe that something is terribly wrong. That feeling is enhanced when he enters the plane, and suddently feels that it is about o explode. So, Alex goes hysterical and leaves the plane along with six people, and afterwars it (surprise!) explodes. This is just the beginning of the process, as Alex soon discovers that death will be back to take the lives of those who escaped the explosion.The concept is interesting and, although most of the movie`s strenght relies in its more nightmarish/ paranoid first twenty minutes, director James Wong (""X-Files"", ""Milennium"") still knows how to keep things going in a surprising way. The death scenes are not only creative and thrilling, but also darkly comic. The atmosphere is gloomy with some appropriate blue tones, the score efficient and the acting satisfying. The character development could be better, but it`s still decent, and the timing and suspense are good.This, like ""Scream"", is an edgy, clever picture, that also goes for the tongue-in-cheek approach (especially in the second half) and a fine horror movie about Generation X (it even has a dark, unsettling, mysterious mood).A good one.",3,Til Death Do Us Part,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1510,"['suspenseful', 'cult', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'horror', 'flicks', 'last', 'years', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'decent', 'execution.Alex', 'Browning', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'teen', 'student', 'enter', 'plane', 'order', 'go', 'Paris', 'classmates', 'seeing', 'visions', 'premonitions', 'strange', 'allucinations', 'force', 'believe', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'feeling', 'enhanced', 'when', 'plane', 'suddently', 'feels', 'o', 'explode', 'So', 'Alex', 'hysterical', 'plane', 'six', 'people', 'surprise', 'just', 'beginning', 'process', 'Alex', 'soon', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'take', 'lives', 'who', 'escaped', 'explosion.The', 'concept', 'interesting', 'most', 'movie', 's', 'strenght', 'relies', 'more', 'nightmarish/', 'paranoid', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'X-Files', 'Milennium', 'still', 'how', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'surprising', 'way', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'creative', 'thrilling', 'also', 'darkly', 'comic', 'atmosphere', 'gloomy', 'appropriate', 'blue', 'tones', 'score', 'efficient', 'acting', 'satisfying', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'be', 'better', 's', 'still', 'decent', 'timing', 'suspense', 'are', 'good.This', 'Scream', 'edgy', 'clever', 'picture', 'also', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'approach', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'fine', 'horror', 'movie', 'Generation', 'X', 'even', 'dark', 'unsettling', 'mysterious', 'mood', '.A', 'good', 'one']",N/A

The writers and production team must have had a field day planting and plotting the various little, almost subliminal 'clues' throughout the flick...which for me was the highlight, almost reminiscent of old Warner Bros. cartoons, where for example, several fast, whirling edits would reveal all the implements of, say, Daffy Duck's impending doom.  Most of the death scenes have a comic, stumbling 'snowballing' effect to them that works, for the most part (the train scene, however, fell a bit 'flat' for me)....

What sets Final Destination above so many high school-set horror films is its original premise. The killer is not some deranged madman or...cheerleader, but Death itself. Another good thing is the production values. The quality of the special effects, the locations and even the actors (they aren't Olivier, but they're believable) is pretty high for this kind of film. The writers and director (Morgan, Reddick and Wong) pay great attention to detail and are good at building tension in the story. Watching the bathroom scene puts my nerves so much on edge that I cannot watch the entire thing with my eyes open. The DVD is nice because it shows the alternate ending, and discusses the screening and previewing process. This is just a fun, but scary movie to watch at home with your folks or some friends.

38858,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0780631684,Jeffrey Leach,"[10, 13]","The first thing I would like to say about ""Final Destination"" is that it's not ""Final Destination 2."" For those of us who saw both films, you know what I'm talking about. If not, I am referring to the first ten minutes of the second film, which surely ranks as one of the finest, most breathtaking ballets of gory mayhem in American horror in the last ten years. That said, I thought the first ""Final Destination"" a good, not great film. Perhaps the best thing going for this film is its originality. While ""Final Destination"" and its sequel borrow several elements from the tried and true slasher formula, both do something quite different with this tired genre. And a tired genre it is considering the number of straight to video slashers arriving in a video store near you number roughly a couple of billion a month. Many horror fans worry that the rapid increase in the amount of by the numbers horror movies threatens the future of the genre. This concern is understandable yet premature. As long as somewhat original films like ""Final Destination"" come along from time to time, I don't think we have much to worry about. At least I hope so.""Final Destination"" begins by introducing us to Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), your typical All-American kid getting ready for a trip to Paris sponsored by his high school French club. But something doesn't seem right. Sinister warnings pointing toward an imminent disaster keep popping up. For example, the digital clock in his bedroom flashes the number of his impending flight. Once he arrives at the airport with his classmates and chaperones, it's a bit disconcerting to notice that the word ""terminated"" appears next to his flight number on the arrival/departure board. Coincidence? Maybe, but things soon get much, much worse once the kids get on the airplane and it takes off. Something horrible happens to the plane soon after lifting off the runway, namely the rapid disintegration of the aircraft into a ball of fire. We see people sucked out of a rift in the side of the plane, flames roaring through the passenger cabin, and people screaming as they burn up. Talk about seeing something that will soak you in sweat! These opening scenes successfully play on the fear most of us have about perishing in an airplane disaster. We almost feel cheated when Alex suddenly wakes up, and realizes that the disaster was nothing more than a bad dream. Or was it?Unfortunately, what Alex Browning saw in his nightmare unfolds right before his very eyes. The same conversations occur on the plane, as do the same events. He's so alarmed by the similarities between his dream and reality that he begins panicking, starting a ruckus on the plane that embroils him in a confrontation with class jerk Carter Horton (Kerr Smith). The result of this yelling match is the immediate removal of Browning, class loner Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Horton, Horton's girlfriend, and one of Alex's friends from the plane. While the authorities severely reprimand the kids for their atrocious behavior, the plane takes off and promptly blows up over the runway, killing everyone on board including the rest of Browning's classmates. Now the authorities express real interest in Browning's dream. But in the interim the survivors of the explosion assume different attitudes toward Alex Browning. Horton's hostility increases exponentially. A teacher left behind because of the fracas also expresses real suspicion about her clairvoyant student. Clear Rivers, however, becomes quite interested in Alex Browning.  What's more interesting is what happens soon after the accident. Browning's friends begin to die in horrific ways. Why? Because his dream thwarted ""death's design.""Alex and all of the survivors were supposed to perish in that plane crash. Since they lived through the catastrophe, their lives imperil the future. At least I think that's the reason. The greatest strength of ""Final Destination"" is how death must go to extraordinary measures to make sure these survivors meet their doom. In this respect the grim reaper, although never physically actualized, stands in for the typical slasher maniac. Instead of dispatching various characters with such boring and unimaginative devices as sharp farm implements, something more baroque is in order. The torturous path water takes in a bathroom results in Alex's friend slipping and falling into the shower whereupon he expires from a nasty strangulation. The best atrocity by far happens in a very sudden and unexpected encounter between a bus and Horton's girlfriend. Needless to say, the other survivors drop off one by one in extremely imaginative and painful ways. Fortunately, there is nothing painful about the production values, special effects, and acting in ""Final Destination."" Most of the actors do a good enough job with their roles, even ""Dawson's Creek"" refugee Kerr Smith. No one is going to win any awards for their performance here, but the acting is better than most of the histrionics we see in horror movies. Be sure and look for veteran horror actor Tony Todd in a small role as a creepy mortician.I ultimately enjoyed ""Final Destination,"" although not as much as I liked the sequel. In the second installment of what looks like an enduring series (there are plans to make a third entry), the filmmakers cleverly linked the two films together while at the same time ramping up the gore to horrific levels. As a big fan of sauce heavy films, I appreciated the extra effort. The second film's DVD also contains a lot more extras than this one. Still, you do get a few trailers, behind the scenes stuff, and a couple of commentary tracks on the ""Final Destination"" disc. Give this one a watch--there are worse ways to pass a couple of hours.",4,Surprisingly refreshing!,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,5745,"['first', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'Final', 'Destination',

The DVD takes the movie even further, however, by showing some of the deleted scenes and a great alternate ending (though one can understand why it was cut as it sets up for a sequel in many instances).  The only downside to the movie is that it never reveals why the main character had the flash to start with, but you become so involved with the movie (and the fact some characters die with little warning) that you never think about it until the movie is over.

However he does get on the plane and suddenly has a vision of the plane ripping apart and blowing up, wish of course frightens him and he causes enough of a scene that he gets thrown off the plane and a teacher and a few students follow him. Among them are Clear Rivers (Ali Larter, ""Obsessed"", T.V.'s ""Heroes"") and Carter Horton (Kerr Smith, TV's ""Dawson's Creek"").The plane takes off and does end up blowing up, so while he's never charged with the crime almost everyone who survived and was affected by the disaster blames him for it.

In Final Destination, Devon Sawa plays Alex Browning who -- after having a vision -- saves himself and 6 others from an exploding plane. Turns out, ""Death"" wasn't through with them. One by one, they begin to die gruesome deaths. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's plan, and save those who are barely hanging on.Final Destination was a very big sigh of relief for the horror genre after the slur of masked maniacs that had recently hit the big screen. Jeffrey Riddick's (storywriter) interesting idea was turned into a very interesting and deep movie by screenplay writer Glen Morgan and director James Wong. A very good element in Final Destination is that its characters were well developed and you cared for them by time Death made his way into their path. And the actors and actresses that made these characters all did great jobs in making us believe them. Devon Sawa - one who I personally never liked -- perfects the scared and confused but brave Alex Browning. Ali Larter - who has always been a favorite -- plays the part of Chloe, and plays it well. The remaining cast - Kerr Smith, Sean William Scott, Kirsten Cloke, Chad Donella, and more -- all did well. There's also a worthy cameo from Tony Todd, the infamous CandyMan. Great casting for this movie!The New Line Platinum Series DVD is something to be proud about. There are two commentaries: one from James Wong, and another from Glen Morgan and the cast. With the deleted scene and alternate ending, it shows a different way the story could have went, but glad they didn't. Even though it is very interesting. Two featurettes are also present. One that explains the process of the test screenings that Final Destination went through, and another about a woman who claims to have premonitions much like the ones Sawa's character experiences in the movie. Rounding out the extras are two entertaining games, the theatrical trailer, and bios.Final Destination is one to keep at the top of your list, and so is the DVD release.

It's like a slasher movie without the slasher, where literally anything can be lethal and the only limit is the writers' imaginations; that alone would be enough to set it apart from the rest of the '90s horror movies, but there's so much more to like about this movie because it's so well thought out and executed.  The plane crash at the beginning is one of the most believable disaster sequences ever caught on film, at least on the same level as the crash in Alive, and the rest of the movie holds up extremely well.  Surprisingly well-written dialogue on the nature of fate and mortality combines with meticulously arranged domino-effect deaths; despite the annoyingly perfect-looking teen leads, this is as far away from I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last and all those movies as you can get.  Still, Final Destination isn't perfect.  The funeral scene after the plane crash drags on too long, the explanations of death and &quot;the design&quot; are a bit shaky, the  FBI agents contribute nothing at all to the movie, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired (there is a more serious alternate ending on the DVD, though it still wouldn't have closed the film very well).

38875,A200FYUVU6GG4P,0780631684,"J. T. Nite ""mightybjorn""","[5, 5]","This movie takes a revolutionary approach to the teen slasher flick - remove the slasher.  Instead of a dude in a mask, our photogenic heroes are up against Death himself.  Death doesn't need a butcher knife or a fisherman's hook to kill - the instruments of death are everywhere, from the slippery tiles in the bathroom to the can of turpentine in the garage.The filmmakers make the most of style and atmospherics, loading the beginning of the film with almost subliminal foreshadowing, using subtle tricks of light, set, and sound design to enhance the feeling of foreboding.  The result is a film with a unique, look and feel to it, not another run-of-the-mill horror flick.There's also a welcome sense of morbid humor at work here.  It's not precisely the satiric post-modernism of Scream. Rather, it's the blackest kind of comedy: we have to laugh at death, because we can't do anything about it.I can't say I cared enough about the characters to have an emotional stake in what happened to them, which is the film's only flaw.  Though they're more 3-dimensional than your typical cliched teens, they weren't real enough to elicit my sympathy.Nevertheless, it's a finely crafted thriller, with genuinely disturbing scenes and grim humor amiably rubbing shoulders.  Some said this makes an inconsistent tone, I disagree.  Life itself is tragic one minute, comedic the next.  You just have to roll with it.  The comedic scenes don't diminish the horror, or vice versa.The DVD is a five-star treatment, with several deleted scenes leading up to an alternate ending that fell victim to audience testing.  It's a more philosophical ending, but almost ridiculous in its earnestness and not quite true to the spirit of the film; still, it's interesting to see.  There are also two commentary tracks, one with the filmmakers and one with the actors.  Add to that assorted documentaries and games, and you've got hours of fun.Definitely a cut above your average teen-in-peril flick.

It didn't really look all that interesting until the world got told that it was simply the most enjoyable teen horror movie since Scream. Well, even though Final Destination was a little bit off those standards, it remains a highly praised piece of horror that has a few flashes of ingeniously put-together deaths.Alex (Devon Sawa) and a group of high school students take a flight to Paris for a French class trip. Before they set off, Alex has a premonition of the plane bursting into flames minutes after take off. He tells everyone to get off the ill-fated aircraft. Moments later in the departure lounge the student see the plane explode before their very eyes. Now the FBI thinks that Alex had something to do with it and follows his every move. His friends start to believe he had something to do with it also and slowly fade out of his life. But now, each one of his friends is mysteriously being killed by something that appears to the Grim Reaper. Alex starts to believe that fate is starting to taking it's toll.It's a bizarre and unrealistic film, and the poor chase finale doesn't help it. but Final Destination is so inventive, scary and funny that you can't help but be enthralled. We haven't seen such creative deaths as this since God knows how long, and from the first minute, James Wong uses so many cool and nifty tricks that the film becomes unbearably imaginative. The cast are repeatedly watchable; it's only Dawson's Creek's Kerr Smith that is in a seriously miscast role, he overblows his character so stupidly that you'll laugh. Otherwise, this is a hip and trendy new kind of thriller that will please all audiences willing to have a good time.Finally, a horror film that can be recommended to teens and adults alike.",4,Hip and entertaining,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1843,"['Final', 'DestinationScore', '73/100Final', 'Destination', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'pretty', 'much', 'un-known', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'interesting', 'world', 'got', 'told', 'was', 'simply', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'teen', 'horror', 'movie', 'Scream', 'Well', 'even', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'standards', 'highly', 'praised', 'piece', 'horror', 'few', 'flashes', 'ingeniously', 'put-together', 'deaths.Alex', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'take', 'flight', 'Paris', 'French', 'class', 'trip', 'set', 'off', 'Alex', 'premonition', 'plane', 'bursting', 'flames', 'minutes', 'take', 'off', 'everyone', 'get', 'off', 'ill-fated', 'aircraft', 'Moments', 'later', 'departure', 'student', 'see', 'plane', 'explode', 'very', 'eyes', 'Now', 'FBI', 'Alex', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'move', 'friends', 'start', 'believe', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'also', 'slowly', 'fade', 'life', 'now', 'one', 'friends', 'mysteriously', 'being', 'killed', 'something', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Alex', 'believe', 'fate', 'starting', 'taking', 'toll.It', 'bizarre', 'unrealistic', 'film', 'poor', 'chase', 'finale', ""n't"", 'help', 'Final', 'Destination', 'so', 'inventive', 'scary', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'enthralled', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'such', 'creative', 'deaths', 'God', 'how', 'long', 'first', 'minute', 'James', 'Wong', 'so', 'many', 'cool', 'nifty', 'tricks', 'film', 'unbearably', 'imaginative', 'cast', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'watchable', 'only', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'seriously', 'miscast', 'role', 'character', 'so', 'stupidly', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'Otherwise', 'hip', 'trendy', 'new', 'kind', 'thriller', 'will', 'please', 'audiences', 'willing', 'have', 'good', 'time.Finally', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'recommended', 'teens', 'adults', 'alike']",N/A
38877,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0780631684,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 1]","Horror movies experienced a huge comeback in the 1990's and up through today, with successful hits, such as, ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", even the recent 'Halloween' sequels have fared much better than some of their predecessors.  However, as good as many of the recent crop of horror movies have been, they are all pretty much the same due to the villain being a person of flesh and blood, the only difference between them is the method the killer uses to dispatch his/her victims.  To shake things up former ""X-Files"" writer James Wong, crafted a new kind of horror film, one with the smart, sharp writing of the the 'Scream Trilogy', with talented young actors, and very unique death scenes that relied more on shock than on gore.  The biggest difference between this movie, ""Final Destination"" and all of the other successful horror movies of late, is that the killer is not some twisted individual, but rather Death itself, so it's not just a straight horror film, it's also a supernatural thriller.""Final Destination"" begins with a group of seniors in high school preparing to go on their senior trip to Europe, when one of them, a kid named Alex (Devon Sawa), experiences an intense vision of the plane exploding.  When the vision ends, Alex tries to write it off as just a bad daydream, until events in reality begin to match up with events in his dream, so Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane along with a small group of kids, some friends and the others are kids that are mad that Alex is being disruptive and were removed for their threats of violence.  After being removed from the plane, and witnessing the planes take-off occur without incident, the group believes that Alex was just crazy, but then the plane explodes and Alex's vision becomes frighteningly real.  Thinking they just survived a disaster and that their lives are now safe thanks to Alex, the kids begin to adjust back to their lives.  However, Death has a different idea for this group, it seems Death has a plan, and Alex has ruined it's plan.  Now, Death is on a mission to claim the lives of the kids that got off of the plane in order to bring balance back to Death's grand design.  Knowing that he can see when Death is coming due to premonitions, Alex and his soon to be girlfriend, Clear (Ali Larter) attempt to thwart Death and save their remaining classmates.Unique storytelling, solid performances from the entire cast, and a seamless blend of practical and CGI effects, allows ""Final Destination"" to rise above many other supernatural horror movies.  What really helps ""Final Destination"" is the fear of when Death will strike again, and since Death is an invisible force for the most part, in some scenes Death is foreshadowed by moving shadows on walls and other objects, this just adds to the thrills and chills.  Another wise move on the part of the director, James Wong, is to not use buckets and buckets of blood like most horror movies seem to do these days, instead scare the audience with the unknown, which is way more frightening.  While not everyone's type of movie, ""Final Destination"" should not be written off as just another horror movie in an already long list, but instead is more of a supernatural thriller that will at least deliver a scare or two to any viewer.""Final Destination"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Can You Escape Death...,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,3357,"['Horror', 'movies', 'experienced', 'huge', 'comeback', '1990', 'up', 'today', 'successful', 'hits', 'such', 'Scream', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'even', 'recent', 'sequels', 'have', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'predecessors', 'However', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'recent', 'crop', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'due', 'villain', 'being', 'person', 'flesh', 'blood', 'only', 'difference', 'method', 'killer', 'dispatch', 'his/her', 'victims', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'former', 'X-Files', 'writer', 'James', 'Wong', 'crafted', 'new', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'smart', 'sharp', 'writing', ""'Scream"", 'Trilogy', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'very', 'unique', 'death', 'scenes', 'relied', 'more', 'shock', 'gore', 'biggest', 'difference', 'movie', 'Final', 'Destination', 'other', 'successful', 'horror', 'movies', 'late', 'killer', 'not', 'twisted', 'individual', 'rather', 'Death', 'not', 'just', 'straight', 'horror', 'film', 'also', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'Final', 'Destination', 'group', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'preparing', 'go', 'senior', 'trip', 'Europe', 'when', 'one', 'kid', 'named', 'Alex', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'intense', 'vision', 'plane', 'exploding', 'When', 'vision', 'Alex', 'write', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'bad', 'daydream', 'events', 'reality', 'begin', 'match', 'up', 'events', 'dream', 'so', 'Alex', 'out', 'removed', 'plane', 'small', 'group', 'kids', 'friends', 'others', 'are', 'kids', 'are', 'mad', 'Alex', 'being', 'disruptive', 'were', 'removed', 'threats', 'violence', 'being', 'removed', 'plane', 'witnessing', 'planes', 'take-off', 'occur', 'incident', 'group', 'Alex', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'then', 'plane', 'explodes', 'Alex', 'vision', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'Thinking', 'just', 'survived', 'disaster', 'lives', 'are', 'now', 'safe', 'thanks', 'Alex', 'kids', 'begin', 'adjust', 'back', 'lives', 'However', 'Death', 'different', 'idea', 'group', 'Death', 'plan', 'Alex', 'ruined', 'plan', 'Now', 'Death', 'mission', 'claim', 'lives', 'kids', 'got', 'plane', 'order', 'bring', 'balance', 'back', 'Death', 'grand', 'design', 'Knowing', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'Death', 'coming', 'due', 'premonitions', 'Alex', 'soon', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'Clear', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'Death', 'save', 'remaining', 'classmates.Unique', 'storytelling', 'solid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'seamless', 'blend', 'practical', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Final', 'Destination', 'rise', 'above', 'many', 'other', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movies', 'What', 'really', 'Final', 'Destination', 'fear', 'when', 'Death', 'will', 'strike', 'again', 'Death', 'invisible', 'force', 'most', 'part', 'scenes', 'Death', 'foreshadowed', 'moving', 'shadows', 'walls', 'other', 'objects', 'just', 'thrills', 'chills', 'wise', 'move', 'part', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'not', 'use', 'buckets', 'buckets', 'blood', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'seem', 'do', 'days', 'instead', 'scare', 'audience', 'unknown', 'way', 'more', 'frightening', 'not', 'everyone', 'type', 'movie', 'Final', 'Destination', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'already', 'long', 'list', 'instead', 'more', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'will', 'least', 'deliver', 'scare', 'two', 'viewer', 'Final', 'Destination', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

38884,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,0780631684,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[14, 17]","""Final Destination"" is a pretty good flick considering that it's filed under the ""Teen Slasher"" title.  The concept of Death coming after those who have thwarted their fate seems fairly original to me.  I don't recall any other movie using this concept.As most of you probably know, the story starts out with a young man(Devon Sawa) having a vision of Flight 180, the flight he and his classmates happen to be on, exploding into a ball of flames.  He freaks out, gets himself and some of the other students and a teacher booted off of the plane and shortly thereafter, his vision becomes truth.  He's considered a prime suspect for planting a bomb on the plane.One by one, however, his classmates begin to die in some rather unorthodox ways.  The agents tailing Sawa happen to notice that he has been around when most of these deaths occur, further incriminating him.  Sooner or later Sawa, Ali Larter, and a few of the other surviviors realize that Death is hunting them down in the order that they should have died in the plane explosion.This is where the train goes off the tracks.  The plot gets a little bit loopy and things get rather silly as Death picks off the survivors one by one.  The death scenes are rather original, and some of them make you cringe for a second as Death narrowly misses his victims.  Of course, you have to wonder how Death can pull off a plane explosion, but can't manhandle a few puny high schoolers after they avert him the first time around.  Just don't take this movie too seriously, and I'm sure everything will be okay.  Look beyond the absurdities and you'll love every minute of it.Overall, this isn't a bad flick.  The story, though somewhat absurd, is original and the pacing of the film is perfect.  The acting is solid, though Sawa seems a little bit stiff compared to the others.  Ali Larter does a fine job as the loner who is the first to believe in Sawa's character.  All of the death scenes are morbidly entertaining.

There is no scary monster going to jump out and get you.  It is Death that sets off chains of events that lead to death.  (I wondered how Death could be the means and the end (death)in The Seventh Seal.  How odd that a lark of a slasher film would answer that question.)  Sometimes Death gets no one; and sometimes it gets someone else instead.As each domino in an incident falls, you're led to believe that whoever is the current focus will die in a particular way.  For example:  A man shoots at a bird on the wing (Please miss!).  The bullet misses and hits a tree branch instead (Thank heaven!).  The branch falls and breaks a power line that whips back and hits the man, who fries (That was weird!).  That is only a couple of sets of cause and effect.  Insert several sets of cause and effect between a first and last and you have each incident in Final Destinations.The fun is in being misled by the clever twists that run through the chains of events that lead to death.

38891,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780631684,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","In the final analysis ""Final Destination"" benefits from a pair of veterans from ""The X-Files,"" director James Wong and co-writer Glen Morgan, and an extremely helpful initial test screening (see the nice little feature on the DVD with regards to the latter).  This film is one of the bloodiest splatter flicks I have seen in some time (it cannot be considered a slasher flick because there is no slasher and I have to add a caveat in that I have not been watching as many films in this genre as was my wont in my younger days).  But rather than focusing on the blood and gore you are distracted by the ingenious ways the dead teenagers in this movie end up becoming dead.  There is something to said for any movie that finds Rube Goldberg to be a creative inspiration.Once upon a time there was a class of high school students who were going to take a class trip to Paris.  Before the plane takes off Alex (Devon Sawa) has a terrifying vision of the plane exploding.  When he wakes up a couple of things from his vision immediately come true and he starts yelling the plane is going to explode.  There is a big commotion and Alex, five other students and a teacher, end up getting kicked off the plane.  The good news, relatively speaking, is that the plane does indeed explode and their lives have been spared.  The bad news, which takes up the remainder of the film, is that having cheated Death the grim reaper wants to settle accounts.  Once again, Alex is ahead of the loop on this one and the question is whether he can convince the rest of the group of what is going on and figure out what to do to stop it from happening before the final credits.""Final Destination"" is a film where the characters are caught up with who is going to die next while the audience is waiting to find out how.  Not ""how"" as in what handy implement will Jason find in some ""Friday the 13th"" movie but more in the tradition of Vincent Price's ""Dr. Phibes"" films.  But the film does not overplay its hand in this respect and mixes long intricate mousetrap scenarios with startling sudden staccato scenes as well.  Bottom line: this is a splatter flick that delivers on the basis of brains as well as blood.This is not to say that the movie is without its flaws, the most notable of which is that parallel to TWA Flight 800, which also involved students on a flight to Paris.  Was there really no one involved in the making of this movie that did not notice this was in extremely bad taste and totally unnecessary?  It could have been any other city on the planet and it did not even have to be on the far side of the ocean.  However, I was wondering why Alex did not explain the two points that determined the line of logic that made him want to get off of that airplane.  Not that anybody would have believed him, but at least it was a rationale explanation for his behavior.  Also, the first post-plane death in the film is overt in a way that is not true about any of the other deaths  (i.e., the blue liquid) and seems rather out of place in retrospect.A sequel to ""Final Destination"" is currently in movie theaters but while they can certainly replicate the Rube Goldberg inspired death sequences, rehashing the metaphysical questions posed by the dilemma confronting these characters is going to be problematic (if their ""solution"" is any good, why did it not occur to Alex?).  But then sequels in this genre are always about making more money.  The exception that proves the rule is ""Scream 2,"" which was about playing with an audience's mind.  ""Final Destination"" is about using your mind to make a movie.  People who do not like splatter flicks may well like this one, which is a neat trick if you can pull it off.",5,Death is coming for you and he thinks like Rube Goldberg...,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,3706,"['final', 'analysis', 'Final', 'Destination', 'benefits', 'pair', 'veterans', 'X-Files', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'co-writer', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'initial', 'test', 'screening', 'see', 'nice', 'little', 'feature', 'DVD', 'regards', 'latter', 'film', 'one', 'bloodiest', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'slasher', 'flick', 'slasher', 'have', 'add', 'caveat', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'watching', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'was', 'wont', 'younger', 'days', 'rather', 'focusing', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'distracted', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'dead', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'dead', 'something', 'said', 'movie', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'be', 'creative', 'inspiration.Once', 'time', 'was', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'class', 'trip', 'Paris', 'plane', 'Alex', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'terrifying', 'vision', 'plane', 'exploding', 'When', 'up', 'couple', 'things', 'vision', 'immediately', 'come', 'true', 'yelling', 'plane', 'going', 'explode', 'big', 'commotion', 'Alex', 'five', 'other', 'students', 'teacher', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'kicked', 'off', 'plane', 'good', 'news', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'plane', 'indeed', 'explode', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'bad', 'news', 'up', 'remainder', 'film', 'having', 'cheated', 'Death', 'grim', 'reaper', 'settle', 'accounts', 'Once', 'again', 'Alex', 'ahead', 'loop', 'one', 'question', 'can', 'convince', 'rest', 'group', 'what', 'going', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'stop', 'happening', 'final', 'credits', 'Final', 'Destination', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'next', 'audience', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Not', 'how', 'what', 'handy', 'implement', 'will', 'Jason', 'find', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'more', 'tradition', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Dr.', 'Phibes', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'overplay', 'hand', 'respect', 'mixes', 'long', 'intricate', 'mousetrap', 'scenarios', 'startling', 'sudden', 'staccato', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'Bottom', 'line', 'splatter', 'flick', 'basis', 'brains', 'as', 'well', 'blood.This', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'flaws', 'most', 'notable', 'parallel', 'TWA', 'Flight', '800', 'also', 'involved', 'students', 'flight', 'Paris', 'Was', 'really', 'one', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'was', 'extremely', 'bad', 'taste', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'city', 'planet', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'be', 'far', 'side', 'ocean', 'However', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'Alex', 'did', 'not', 'explain', 'two', 'points', 'determined', 'line', 'logic', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'airplane', 'Not', 'anybody', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'least', 'was', 'rationale', 'explanation', 'behavior', 'Also', 'first', 'post-plane', 'death', 'film', 'overt', 'way', 'not', 'true', 'other', 'deaths', 'i.e.', 'blue', 'liquid', 'rather', 'place', 'retrospect.A', 'sequel', 'Final', 'Destination', 'currently', 'movie', 'theaters', 'can', 'certainly', 'replicate', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'inspired', 'death', 'sequences', 'rehashing', 'metaphysical', 'questions', 'posed', 'dilemma', 'confronting', 'characters', 'going', 'be', 'problematic', 'solution', 'good', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'Alex', 'then', 'sequels', 'genre', 'are', 'always', 'making', 'more', 'money', 'exception', 'rule', 'Scream', '2', 'was', 'playing', 'audience', 'mind', 'Final', 'Destination', 'using', 'mind', 'make', 'movie', 'People', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'may', 'well', 'one', 'neat', 'trick', 'can', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

As soon as they're on board, Alex has a vision: The plane explodes soon after takeoff and all aboard die. He, five of his friends and teacher Mrs. Lewton are dragged off the plane by security because Browning's panic attack. As they argue why they had to leave the plane, they are suddenly silenced by a distant explosion as the plane explodes for real. Alex Browning has saved their lives and cheated Death. Now, Death is after them for paybaxk. They chaeted him and he is not happy about it. He tries to get them all but can Alex cheat Death again? Can he save his friends?THE CAST: Co-starring Ali Larter as Clear who shares Browning's visions, Kerr Smith as Carter, a guy who blames Alex for the death of his friends and Tony Todd as the coroner who knows a little to much about the rules of Death.... The acting is actually average but... what do you expect from newcomers and Teen TV Stars? The appearence of Tony Todd is a joy for everyone who knows him and Ali Larter stands out as the best actress in this film.THE FILM: The film stands out as one of the most original horror movies of the 90's. There is no flesh and blood killer which makes the story more interesting. The death scenes are suspensful, gory and not without a sense of irony. The shock effects are rare but well planned and unexpected. The story has its flaws but the atmospheric cinematography lets you forget. You'll be on the edge of your seat from start to finish. However, the film loses its impact with repeated viewing. Also the characters are pretty flat but the story is too short for developement anyway. The reactions to this movie in the theater was awesom. So if you wnt to have a good time, invite some friends and put in this DVD.THE DVD: The DVD features include two documentaries, actor and director commentaries and isolated score with commentary by composer Shirley Walker. One of the documentaries is about how testscreenings can change a movie and that smaller companies, like New Line, have to rely on them in order to make profit. It is quite interesting to see what questions the testaudience has to answer and makes you kind of sad, that a bunch of people can change an entire movie. But it is a business and that is very well shown in this feature. The other documentary is about a female officer who fights crime with her psychic abilyties. She forsees events and can save lives through that ability like Alex in the movie. This feature also is pretty interesting, if you wanna believe in it os another question cause we know since blairwitch, that it is easy to fake something like that these days. The actor's commentary is fun to listen to cause they are pretty funny. Director's commentary is average but insightful. The 5.1 isolated music score is pretty good. Being a fan of film music I love that feature cause the score is not available to purchase. It is a mediocre score but &quot;The march of Dead&quot; is a beautiful theme which is basicly heard in different variations throughout the score.The DVD is definetly worth buying.",4,You can't cheat Death...,973814400,"11 10, 2000",2000,3152,"['PLOT', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'Alex', 'Browning', 'senior', 'class', 'are', 'boarding', 'plain', 'France', 'fieldtrip', 'As', 'soon', ""'re"", 'board', 'Alex', 'vision', 'plane', 'explodes', 'soon', 'takeoff', 'aboard', 'die', 'five', 'friends', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Lewton', 'are', 'dragged', 'plane', 'security', 'Browning', 'panic', 'attack', 'argue', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'plane', 'are', 'suddenly', 'silenced', 'distant', 'explosion', 'plane', 'explodes', 'real', 'Alex', 'Browning', 'saved', 'lives', 'cheated', 'Death', 'Now', 'Death', 'paybaxk', 'chaeted', 'not', 'happy', 'get', 'can', 'Alex', 'cheat', 'Death', 'again', 'Can', 'save', 'friends', 'CAST', 'Co-starring', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Clear', 'who', 'shares', 'Browning', 'visions', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'Carter', 'guy', 'who', 'Alex', 'death', 'friends', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'coroner', 'who', 'little', 'much', 'rules', 'Death', 'acting', 'actually', 'average', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'newcomers', 'Teen', 'TV', 'Stars', 'appearence', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'joy', 'everyone', 'who', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'out', 'best', 'actress', 'film.THE', 'FILM', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'horror', 'movies', '90', 'flesh', 'blood', 'killer', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'suspensful', 'gory', 'not', 'sense', 'irony', 'shock', 'effects', 'are', 'rare', 'well', 'planned', 'unexpected', 'story', 'flaws', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'lets', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'start', 'finish', 'However', 'film', 'impact', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'flat', 'story', 'too', 'short', 'developement', 'anyway', 'reactions', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'awesom', 'So', 'wnt', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'invite', 'friends', 'put', 'DVD.THE', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'features', 'include', 'two', 'documentaries', 'actor', 'director', 'commentaries', 'isolated', 'score', 'commentary', 'composer', 'Shirley', 'Walker', 'One', 'documentaries', 'how', 'testscreenings', 'can', 'change', 'movie', 'smaller', 'companies', 'New', 'Line', 'have', 'rely', 'order', 'make', 'profit', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'questions', 'testaudience', 'answer', 'kind', 'sad', 'bunch', 'people', 'can', 'change', 'entire', 'movie', 'business', 'very', 'well', 'shown', 'feature', 'other', 'documentary', 'female', 'officer', 'who', 'fights', 'crime', 'psychic', 'abilyties', 'events', 'can', 'save', 'lives', 'ability', 'Alex', 'movie', 'feature', 'also', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'wan', 'na', 'believe', 'question', 'cause', 'know', 'blairwitch', 'easy', 'fake', 'something', 'days', 'actor', 'commentary', 'fun', 'listen', 'cause', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Director', 'commentary', 'average', 'insightful', '5.1', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'pretty', 'good', 'Being', 'fan', 'film', 'music', 'love', 'feature', 'cause', 'score', 'not', 'available', 'purchase', 'mediocre', 'score', 'quot', 'march', 'Dead', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'theme', 'basicly', 'heard', 'different', 'variations', 'score.The', 'DVD', 'definetly', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
38899,AYQ5QOEUN2I3L,0780631684,Marie Edwards,"[2, 3]","Ok, I am new to the ""Final Destination"" horror films, as horror is not my genre. I actually saw the 3rd one first, and became intrigued by the ""cheating death or did they"" plot. Last weekened, TNT had a showing of all 3 and for a lark I recorded them all (which will nicely fit on a 6 hour DVD).I saw FD-1, and let me say, that it was interesting, and thought-provoking. It had it's moments and if you remember it's fiction, I think you will enjoy it better. As one person said, don't take it too seriously. You really don't want to keep running around scared to death and looking at everything like it's going to kill you.None of us knows how we would react if something like that would happen to us. Would we panic, go insane, be grateful we were saved, be more careful, or wonder ""was it really my time, and my selfishness to save my own butt caused the death of my friends"". So, given all of the youth ""I'm going to live forever"" ideas, young kids who don't know how to deal with death (maybe they didn't have to) and fiction, it's worth 4 stars.The movie starts out like life, you begin by thinking you got your whole life ahead of you, then you get to the airport.Yes, a plane disaster, like we haven't seen or read about them before.BUT, this one is a little different. One of the guys, Alex, is sitting in his seat for a moment (the whole numerology deal starts clicking; he was born 9-25, flight 925, ROW I (9) SEAT-25), then has a ""vision or premonition"" of the whole disaster. He freaks out & how many of us wouldn't?? He jumps up, alerting the crafts personnel and irritating a few other people (Kerr Smith's character--Carter). Teachers and students are dragged off the plane, and while chaos ensues, the crafts disembarks and explodes, as he said it would.Of course the FBI being suspicious won't stop following him, even though the cause was ""mechanical failure"". The FBI doesn't believe in premonitions or the like.That accident sets off a chain reaction to the whole death-master plan design. One by one, freakish accidents plague the survivors in the order they would have died had they stayed on the plane. Of course we don't know about such things as there are usually no surviors or instances where this has happened recently, so we don't know how true this theory is, it could make sense if you are open-minded.Since Tod lost his brother on the flight, it is assumed he committed suicide, and he's the first to die. Then, it's the antagonist's girlfriend (Terry) who was next--killed quite freakishly after telling Carter to ""drop dead"". Then, the surviving teacher's freakish accident.By this time, Alex realizes he might be able to cheat death and keep the others alive, and sets out to do just that. After saving Carter, another character (Billy) is rambling on about Carter being dead and is hit by a piece of debris from Carter's car versus train incident, leaving just Alex, Carter and the girl (Clear or Claire).As of note, doors do not lock by themselves, BUT since he was on a train track, it is feasible the vibration from the coming train caused them to lock as they were the manual locks and relied on being ""pushed down"" (gravity/velocity type of thing??).Since they figured they survived they run off, but Alex realizes Clear is next and sets out to save her, which he does. 6 months later they are in Paris (their ""final"" destination at the beginning), and after hearing the song ""Rocky Mountain High"", which preceded most of the other deaths, they realize they might not have cheated death and the movie ends with Carter sacrificing himself to save Alex.And, as predictable there are going to be sequels.FD-1 is pretty good entertainment, thought-provoking, plot is slightly recycled in the whole ""teen death/slasher"" genre, slightly over used ""edge of seat"" plot as well.Watch it on the TV first. If you're really intriugued keep it on DVR or find the DVD cheap ($10 and lower), try Walmart $5 bin or thier $7.50 stack. If you must have the whole series, buy the triology on Amazon for under $25.",4,"Don't be so serious, and remember it's ""fiction""",1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,4035,"['Ok', 'am', 'new', 'Final', 'Destination', 'horror', 'films', 'horror', 'not', 'genre', 'actually', 'saw', '3rd', 'one', 'first', 'became', 'intrigued', 'cheating', 'death', 'did', 'plot', 'Last', 'weekened', 'TNT', 'had', 'showing', '3', 'lark', 'recorded', 'will', 'nicely', 'fit', '6', 'hour', 'DVD', '.I', 'saw', 'FD-1', 'let', 'say', 'was', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'had', 'moments', 'remember', 'fiction', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'better', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'keep', 'running', 'around', 'scared', 'death', 'looking', 'everything', 'going', 'kill', 'you.None', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'Would', 'panic', 'go', 'insane', 'be', 'grateful', 'were', 'saved', 'be', 'more', 'careful', 'wonder', 'was', 'really', 'time', 'selfishness', 'save', 'own', 'butt', 'caused', 'death', 'friends', 'So', 'given', 'youth', ""'m"", 'going', 'live', 'forever', 'ideas', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'death', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fiction', 'worth', '4', 'stars.The', 'movie', 'out', 'life', 'begin', 'thinking', 'got', 'whole', 'life', 'ahead', 'then', 'get', 'airport.Yes', 'plane', 'disaster', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'read', 'before.BUT', 'one', 'little', 'different', 'One', 'guys', 'Alex', 'sitting', 'seat', 'moment', 'whole', 'numerology', 'deal', 'clicking', 'was', 'born', '9-25', 'flight', '925', 'ROW', '9', 'SEAT-25', 'then', 'vision', 'premonition', 'whole', 'disaster', 'out', 'how', 'many', 'would', ""n't"", 'up', 'alerting', 'crafts', 'personnel', 'irritating', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'character', 'Carter', 'Teachers', 'students', 'are', 'dragged', 'plane', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'crafts', 'disembarks', 'explodes', 'said', 'would.Of', 'course', 'FBI', 'being', 'suspicious', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'following', 'even', 'cause', 'was', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'FBI', ""n't"", 'believe', 'premonitions', 'like.That', 'accident', 'sets', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'whole', 'death-master', 'plan', 'design', 'One', 'one', 'freakish', 'accidents', 'plague', 'survivors', 'order', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'had', 'stayed', 'plane', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'usually', 'surviors', 'instances', 'where', 'happened', 'recently', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'true', 'theory', 'could', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'open-minded.Since', 'Tod', 'lost', 'brother', 'flight', 'assumed', 'committed', 'suicide', 'first', 'die', 'Then', 'antagonist', 'girlfriend', 'Terry', 'who', 'was', 'next', 'killed', 'quite', 'freakishly', 'telling', 'Carter', 'drop', 'dead', 'Then', 'surviving', 'teacher', 'freakish', 'accident.By', 'time', 'Alex', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'cheat', 'death', 'keep', 'others', 'alive', 'out', 'do', 'just', 'saving', 'Carter', 'character', 'Billy', 'rambling', 'Carter', 'being', 'dead', 'hit', 'piece', 'debris', 'Carter', 'car', 'versus', 'train', 'incident', 'leaving', 'just', 'Alex', 'Carter', 'girl', 'Clear', 'Claire', '.As', 'note', 'doors', 'do', 'not', 'lock', 'BUT', 'was', 'train', 'track', 'feasible', 'vibration', 'coming', 'train', 'caused', 'lock', 'were', 'manual', 'locks', 'relied', 'being', 'pushed', 'down', 'gravity/velocity', 'type', 'thing', '.Since', 'figured', 'survived', 'run', 'off', 'Alex', 'Clear', 'next', 'out', 'save', '6', 'months', 'later', 'are', 'Paris', 'final', 'destination', 'beginning', 'hearing', 'song', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'High', 'preceded', 'most', 'other', 'deaths', 'realize', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'cheated', 'death', 'movie', 'Carter', 'sacrificing', 'save', 'Alex.And', 'predictable', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sequels.FD-1', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertainment', 'thought-provoking', 'plot', 'slightly', 'recycled', 'whole', 'teen', 'death/slasher', 'genre', 'slightly', 'used', 'edge', 'seat', 'plot', 'well.Watch', 'TV', 'first', ""'re"", 'really', 'intriugued', 'keep', 'DVR', 'find', 'DVD', 'cheap', '10', 'lower', 'try', 'Walmart', '5', 'bin', 'thier', '7.50', 'stack', 'must', 'have', 'whole', 'series', 'buy', 'triology', 'Amazon', '25']",N/A
38900,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,0780631684,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another &quot;guy with a hook&quot; campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive &quot;tag-you're-dead&quot; quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.Oooh.

38901,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,0780631684,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[0, 0]","There were moments in this film where there was some signs of intelligence and imagination, but they would quickly fizzle, and I was left with the same old movie.  I think the main problem I had with the movie was the basic premise, that the time of your death was fated, and there was no way to avoid it.  While in a sense this is true, because death does eventually have to come to all of us, it was the way that this movie portrayed it that I thought was stupid.In a basic nutshell, the movie's plot is as follows, seven people are kicked off an airplane just before it takes off because the lead character has a premonition of the plane exploding shortly after it takes off.  The plane does blow up, and the seven people are spared, but then, starting shortly afterwards, they begin dying off anyway, and under mysterious ways, as if since they cheated fate at that moment, they have to pay for it by dying now.  Maybe if this were displayed as merely accidents, I could have swallowed this premise, but in the very first death, we're shown that fate is truly killing these people off because they escaped their original death.  Very farfetched, and dumb.  To illustrate, a spoiler follows where I will illuminate the first death so you know what I'm talking about.  The first character to die is in the bathroom looking into the mirror when water mysteriously begins leaking from the toilet's pipe.  It slowly flows across the floor to where he's standing, holding a sharp pair of scissors that he's using to clip his nose hairs.  We are spared this death as he puts them down, then reaches to turn off the stereo, but he doesn't get electrocuted either.  Next, he goes over to check on socks that are drying on a clothesline across the bathtub when he slips in the water, falls on the line, it wraps around his neck, and he falls into the tub.  The other end of the line stays attatched above him as he knocks over a contained of shampoo into the tub, making it slippery so he can't stand up.  Thus, he strangles to death, and then the water seeps back across the floor to disappear back into the pipe, as if it were never there.  Fate, right?  Some of the other deaths were even dumber than that one, if you can believe it.So, the rest of the movie, the other characters work at trying to figure out how their death is coming and how they can avoid it.  Some of the actors were actually decent in their roles, but could only do so much with the script they were saddled with.  With some more imagination and a decent script, something might have actually have been salvaged from this film, but as it was, it really wasn't worth my time, nor do I think it is worth yours.

He panicks after the vision and he, four other students and a teacher are forcible removed from the plane by the airline staff. The airplane takes off without them and a few seconds later, explodes just like in Alex's vision as it is ascending into the air.Thirty-nine days pass and everything seems fine, but then, after the funeral of the victims of the crash one of the survivors dies in a freak accident that is at first dismissed as suicide.

It seems such a shame that people died in such brutal fashion. Even though this is a review I can't help but think of all of those poor people. That aside this is a nifty little thriller that rises above the typical teen horror movie genre clich&eacute;'s that have ruined some horror movies (""Scream 3""). The movie tells the story of what happens when death comes a calling and you have to figure out when exactly it is coming to get you. Devon Sawa plays Alex a guy heading to France with his friends on a school trip. While on the plane Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to explode and after a major commotion is thrown off the plane along with some others. Well after you know what happens the survivors who were not on the plane find themselves the victim of Death as it comes a calling trying to kill them because as one strange character puts it ""You can't cheat death"". As the survivors die one by one Alex realizes that the killings are occurring the order of which they sat on the airplane. Now Alex must outwit death before it kills everyone including himself. The movie features allot of suspense and jolts to startle even the most fearless viewer. What bothers me about the film though is that the plot never really ends on a satisfactory level leaving us with questions that may never be answered until the unnecessary sequel (for which the film's climax sets up) Still the movie is a fairly good one if you just don't think about it too much too much.

38908,A152C8GYY25HAH,0780631684,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","There is a huge pile of movies that makes up the ones aimed at teen audiences. Mainly, it is a junk pile. Let's face it. The teen market is self-limiting for two reasons. One is that by the age of 16 or 17, one's life experience is limited, which makes it pointless to pursue a lot of subjects. This greatly reduces the number of stories that can be told. The other reason is a sad one. Because people between the ages of 14 and 24 now have such an enormous amount of money to spend, they are approached as if they were a vast a herd of sheep to be shorn by vast corporate entities. Since these giant companies are not by nature experimental or innovative, the products tend to imitate each others, and movies are no exception. They seem to get away with this simply because a new croup of young victims comes along every two or three years. Occasionally, a movie aimed at teens is much better made than its rivals, probably because some production boss wisely loosened the reigns a bit. Final Destination is one of these movies.The story is not anymore realistic than most Doomed Teenagers movies. It suffers from a problem many writers have. They come up with a great and often original premise which they are not either clever enough or imaginative enough to build upon to an equally innovative conclusion. So, the climax of Final Destination is lame. But, boy! What a wild ride it is up until that ending!A group of high school students is about to fly to Paris for their senior trip. As the movie opens, we see them arrive full of energy and excitement at a New York City airport. Aboard the plane, all seems fine until something odd happens to Alex Browning [Devon Sawa]. We share with him a truly horrific experience in which he sees the plane start coming apart in midair. It turns out that he has fallen asleep and dreamed it all. When he wakes up and sees thing occur that he saw in the dream's beginning, he demands to be let off the plane. In the ensuing chaos, several students and two teachers are escorted off. One teacher is allowed to return so he can chaparone the rest of the students. The others are forced to stay behind. They are naturally furious with Alex, but can only watch helplessly at the plane takes off. Then, suddenly, it explodes just after takeoff. No one abroad survives.Later, Alex faces all sorts of problems. The FBI is watching him day and night because, as yet, the cause of the explosion is not know. His peers think he is dangerous and very strange and want nothing to do with him. Along with the others who missed the flight, he is racked with guilt. These are just the start of his woes. He knows something is very wrong about the whole experience. Why did he have the vision? Why does he feel an unearthly presence around him? Why is he so worried about himself and the other survivors? He comes to believe that this little group somehow cheated death and that each of their numbers will soon be up. It isn't long before he is proved right.From Alex's first vision up to that all too predictable ending, the terror and suspense never let up. Director James Wong wisely keeps the pace of the movie fast and furious, so that the audience has no time for a reality check. He gives us no breathers, so we have no chance to think about how silly this all is and then to start laughing at the characters. Anyone who's attention might be wandering will be instantly brought back by the bus scene, which may be the most shocking and surprising five=second scene in all of 2000. Wong's efforts result in a triumph of style over substance. Isn't this often what good movie making is all about?The cast is sharp and attractive. Devon Sawa's Alex must go from well adjusted kid to one who is on the brink of going mad. He makes the character believable. Ali Lartner makes Clear Rivers, the only student who believes in Alex, seem both beautiful and haunted. As Carter, Kerr Smith has a fine time as the hotheaded hunk who'd rather let his fists do the talking. The director is an executive producer on The X Files, and I suspect he will become an icon of the thriller genre in the next few years.",4,"Creepy, suspenseful, way above average",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,4129,"['huge', 'pile', 'movies', 'up', 'ones', 'aimed', 'teen', 'audiences', 'Mainly', 'junk', 'pile', 'Let', 'face', 'teen', 'market', 'self-limiting', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'age', '16', '17', 'one', 'life', 'experience', 'limited', 'pointless', 'pursue', 'lot', 'subjects', 'greatly', 'number', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'other', 'reason', 'sad', 'one', 'people', 'ages', '14', '24', 'now', 'have', 'enormous', 'amount', 'money', 'spend', 'are', 'approached', 'were', 'vast', 'herd', 'sheep', 'be', 'shorn', 'vast', 'corporate', 'entities', 'giant', 'companies', 'are', 'not', 'nature', 'experimental', 'innovative', 'products', 'tend', 'imitate', 'others', 'movies', 'are', 'exception', 'seem', 'get', 'away', 'simply', 'new', 'croup', 'young', 'victims', 'along', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'Occasionally', 'movie', 'aimed', 'teens', 'much', 'better', 'made', 'rivals', 'probably', 'production', 'wisely', 'loosened', 'reigns', 'bit', 'Final', 'Destination', 'one', 'movies.The', 'story', 'not', 'anymore', 'realistic', 'most', 'Doomed', 'Teenagers', 'movies', 'problem', 'many', 'writers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'great', 'often', 'original', 'premise', 'are', 'not', 'either', 'clever', 'enough', 'imaginative', 'enough', 'build', 'equally', 'innovative', 'conclusion', 'So', 'climax', 'Final', 'Destination', 'lame', 'boy', 'What', 'wild', 'ride', 'up', 'ending', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'fly', 'Paris', 'senior', 'trip', 'movie', 'see', 'arrive', 'full', 'energy', 'excitement', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'airport', 'plane', 'fine', 'something', 'odd', 'Alex', 'Browning', '[', 'Devon', 'Sawa', ']', 'share', 'truly', 'horrific', 'experience', 'plane', 'start', 'coming', 'apart', 'midair', 'out', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'dreamed', 'When', 'up', 'sees', 'thing', 'occur', 'saw', 'dream', 'beginning', 'be', 'let', 'off', 'plane', 'ensuing', 'chaos', 'several', 'students', 'two', 'teachers', 'are', 'escorted', 'off', 'One', 'teacher', 'allowed', 'return', 'so', 'can', 'chaparone', 'rest', 'students', 'others', 'are', 'forced', 'stay', 'behind', 'are', 'naturally', 'furious', 'Alex', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'helplessly', 'plane', 'off', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'just', 'takeoff', 'one', 'abroad', 'survives.Later', 'Alex', 'sorts', 'problems', 'FBI', 'watching', 'day', 'night', 'because', 'yet', 'cause', 'explosion', 'not', 'know', 'peers', 'think', 'dangerous', 'very', 'strange', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'others', 'who', 'missed', 'flight', 'racked', 'guilt', 'are', 'just', 'start', 'woes', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'whole', 'experience', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'vision', 'Why', 'feel', 'unearthly', 'presence', 'Why', 'so', 'worried', 'other', 'survivors', 'believe', 'little', 'group', 'somehow', 'cheated', 'death', 'numbers', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'up', ""n't"", 'long', 'proved', 'right.From', 'Alex', 'first', 'vision', 'up', 'too', 'predictable', 'ending', 'terror', 'suspense', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'Director', 'James', 'Wong', 'wisely', 'pace', 'movie', 'fast', 'furious', 'audience', 'time', 'reality', 'check', 'breathers', 'have', 'chance', 'think', 'how', 'silly', 'then', 'start', 'laughing', 'characters', 'Anyone', 'who', 'attention', 'might', 'be', 'wandering', 'will', 'be', 'instantly', 'brought', 'back', 'bus', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'shocking', 'surprising', 'five=second', 'scene', '2000', 'Wong', 'efforts', 'result', 'triumph', 'style', 'substance', ""n't"", 'often', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'cast', 'sharp', 'attractive', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'Alex', 'must', 'go', 'well', 'adjusted', 'kid', 'one', 'who', 'brink', 'going', 'mad', 'character', 'believable', 'Ali', 'Lartner', 'Clear', 'Rivers', 'only', 'student', 'who', 'Alex', 'seem', 'beautiful', 'haunted', 'Carter', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'fine', 'time', 'hotheaded', 'hunk', 'who', 'rather', 'let', 'fists', 'do', 'talking', 'director', 'executive', 'producer', 'X', 'Files', 'suspect', 'will', 'become', 'icon', 'thriller', 'genre', 'next', 'few', 'years']",N/A

38910,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,0780631684,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","I'm about to get on a plane in about 2 weeks, for the second time only in my whole life, and boy, I shouldn't have watched this movie! The other night I was bored, and decided to compare my list of DVDs to my list of DVDs I've reviewed, and discovered there's about 50 that I have not reviewed! So to get the ball rolling, I thought I'd review the first ever DVD I ever got! (It was also the first commentary I ever watched, and apart from Miss Congeniality, I'll never watch one again!)I'd originally seen this at the cinema, and started to get into the whole DVD phenomenon, albeit a couple of years behind everyone else. 221 DVDs later - I don't smoke, rarely drink, or do drugs, so this is my vice, and a constant source of amusement among the people I work with! I also get very much teased about liking this movie when I started college.This movie still scares me four years on, even though I've seen it a million and one times. I get quite jumpy, and the thought of getting on a plane after seeing this sickens me (even if it is an hour long, internal flight). The extras also freak me out, especially the quiz, which tells you the exact date you're going to die. I can't remember the exact date now, but it was quite far away. It freaked me out so much the first time I did it, I've never dared do it again, to find out if the date changes. Apart from the usual generic garbage, that's the only extra I've ever truly hated on a DVD.There are quite a few great actors in this, although apart from the lovely Ali Larter, they haven't done too much else in movies, or set the box offices alight. I've seen a picture of Devon Sawa from his latest movie, and he's fairly lost his OK looks from this and starring in Eminem's ""Stan"". Apart from Dawson's Creek, the gorgeous (his cheekbones, his eyes, nice) Kerr Smith's only reasonable 'hit' has been Cruel Intentions 3, a straight to DVD sequel sequel!!! (Which I will probably get now I know he is in it) Tony Todd is also the evil mortician guy, who was originally in Candyman. Seann William Scott also appears in a small and insignificant role and he later ends up getting brutally decapitated.The only good thing about the commentary was that the amount of stuff the director points out, cool little facts & stuff. The whole 9:25 stuff is absolutely wicked, and I love how they managed to incorporate it all. The woman at the check-in desk at the airport tells Alex that the plane leaves at 9:25, which is the same as his birthday (25th September). When he gets on the plane he sits in seat I (which is the 9th letter of the alphabet) and the seat is in row 25. In scenes not shown in the final cut of the movie, but in the deleted scenes Alex and Clear's baby is born at 9.25. (Which can get confusing, as Alex & Clear's relationship suddenly turns from friendly, to a more intimate relationship, without explaining why, unless you watch the deleted scenes.) There's also a luggage cart, which has 666 written on the top of it and during the very dull opening credits, all of the deaths in the movie are foreshadowed. There is a hanging doll, a guillotine, and a picture of a knife in someone's chest. Continuously throughout, music by John Denver is played, who I'd never heard of until I 'watched' the commentary, and found out about him.I've never understood why some people don't like this movie, but prefer the second one. It's always strange when people do that.

The scene in the beginning when the plane actually DOES blow up has an apocalyptic feel to it.

So, I have to admit that when I heard about this film--co-written by this team, I was eager to check it out.And while I enjoyed the film, for the most part, I can't say it's up to their usual standard fare that they regularily offered on X-Files.  The premise is interesting enough--a group of young teens cheat death and death decides to ensure they don't escape again.  The movie has the problem of feeling a bit schitzophrenic--one moment it's dark and scary, the next moment it's a bit too light.  I can only imagine that there were some studio suits who felt Morgan and Wong's usual trick of having dark, off-beat humor might not translate well and decided to go with the campy humor we get here. And that ruins the movie in a lot of places.  Morgan and Wong aren't allowed to go far enough into the dark side and really tap the potential that's there.  Indeed, they fail to do what they usually do--creep you out in ways you never expect.One of the interesting things is that on the DVD is the documentary about the testing of the film as well as the original ending and alternate scenes.  I will admit one thing that really bugged me about the movie was the ending.  However, in seeing that original creator's ending, I'm not sure they had the best idea for how to end the movie either.  Either way, given the ability to compare and contrast the two visions is a nice touch and a good way to make use of what DVD can bring to the table in terms of extra features for the viewer.The young cast is uniformly solid with a few exceptions.  Josh Kerr never really makes his character anything more than a one-note character but otherwise, the rest is good.

High school student Alex (played by Devon Sawa) has a horrific premonition which is ultimately instrumental in saving the lives of himself and a number of others. But have they cheated death? Or is there an even more horrible fate in store for each of them?I found ""Final Destination"" to be an oddly uneven film. Director Wong helps create a genuinely creepy atmosphere; I especially liked the way ordinary household items and actions are invested with an ominous weight. But some aspects of the film struck me as inappropriately humorous, leading me to wonder if I was watching an intentional spoof or if the filmmakers were just slipping up in moments of ineptitude.I found the tone of the film inconsistent. Were they trying to create a serious psychological drama in which the viewer is meant to care about the characters, or rather should the viewer view Alex and the others as mere fodder for yet another ""slasher""-style horror pic? I was also disappointed by the ending.One of the best aspects of ""Final Destination"" is the strong work by its ensemble cast, which includes Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke. Sawa in particular makes a sympathetic leading man. His solid performance carries much of the film; he is definitely a young actor worth following.

So the Grim Reaper goes about claiming these 'lucky' teenagers in its own creatively gross ways, proving that it is more than just a force to be reckoned with.A couple of the death scenes are laughable for how ridiculous they are.

This is its downfall.This may sound a little far-fetched itself, but I found the movie a little depressing.

After endless Jasons, Freddys, Michael Myers, Scream Ghosts, it's hard to imagine a creative new bad guy. Enter &quot;Death&quot;. In the hands of lesser film-makers, we would have had to sit through a whole flick of a cloaked, dark figure a la, &quot;I know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, but here we get to see, or experience, death as a natural force. Because you can't see the figure, and because it can be ubiquitous, it makes the &quot;shock&quot; killings all that more shocking. This is a suprisingly tight, well-made movie.  It's perhaps no surprise that it's the brain child of X-Files alumni Wong and Morgan. While other reviews have balked at the mix of humor and gore, I think it plays really well. It doesn't fall into pastiche comedy-horror, but rather titilates the audience with a teasing sense of humor. While you can assure yourself that there's no Freddy or Jason under your bed and get a good night's sleep, this movie makes you realize death is on its way and there's no escape. How confrontational is that for a teenager slasher? Kudos to the film makers for something different and enjoyable. Also, the DVD provides the original ending and a documentary on the &quot;test screening&quot; process and why the ending got changed.

The plot (which may seem a bit ludicrous, just a bit...) is that Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition that the plane he and his class are boarding to France is going to explode.  After getting kicked off the plane with some other students (including Ali Larter and Sean William Scott), the plane does explode, but as we soon find out, Death hasn't forgotten about Alex and the others.  One by one the survivors are picked off by an unseen force that causes elaborate causes of death, some of which are eerie, and some others just plain ridiculous.  Veteran X-Files director James Wong carries the film at a nice pace and has a surprising sense of urgency and dread as we watch what happens to the survivors, and Sawa is surprisingly good in his role as the man looking for a way to find a pattern to cheat death.  The ending however is obviously just a quick thought of glued on afterthought to pave way for an inevitable sequel (which is due out soon) and hurts Final Destination's overall score; however the alternate ending included on the DVD I find a much, much better ending and it has a bit of emotional impact that would have really set Final Destination above and beyond the countless heap of unoriginal teen horror films of today.

Movies like Urban  Legends and I now What You Did Last Summer were simply making horror films pop-culture teen movies by adding in popular actors and actresses and throwing in some terrible humor for good measure.  Whereas the Scream franchise more or less does the same thing, I appreciate it and like it because the humor is poking fun at the movie itself, and other horror movies that came before it.  Wes Craven, a horror veteran, knew what he was talking about, and managed to make the trilogy scary and funny at the same time, something none of the other recent horror films have been able to pull off.Final Destination is different altogether.  Given, the actors and actresses are all young and popular, and there is some humor tossed in, the story is radically different than a typical slasher movie.  There isn't really a killer.  Teens are being killed off, one by one, sure, but death itself is tracking them down.  A force, not a human or a monster.

It was amazingly original and creatively twisted! Final Destination was like Sam Rami's Evil Dead.... a first time success! It has made four sequels to this day and I hope there will be more to come!Plot: After a random plane crash that has left people shocked one of the survivors (A college kid named Alex Browning) has a vision of one of the survivor's deaths and then out of no where the teen he envisioned dies! Now Alex realizes that death has a design and it's not finished and he must find a way to stop it or at least skip the next victim at there final destination!Review: Wow... this has to be one of the most confusing yet easily understandable plot sequences I have seen since ""The Butterfly Effect!"" I bet that it was a nightmare to try and come up with this plot for the writers who help create this masterpiece and I will admit that the idea is a little silly but if you don't take it too seriously you should be fine! The deaths were also very creative and brutal! The soundtrack was killer and the acting was superb this film has a lot to give to the audience and it has some deaths that you just won't see coming!Acting: Devon Sawa ""Night of the Twisters (1996)"", Ali Carter ""House on Haunted Hill (1999), Final Destination 2 (2003) and Resident Evil Parts 3 & 4 (2007/2010)"" and Kristen Cloke ""Black X-Mass (2006)"" were excellent actors and so were the rest of the cast! The Acting felt real and the actors that died did an amazing job portraying and performing there deaths!Gore: This is what I meant by the ""Weak MPAA"" statement.... it was very brutal and should've had at least strong horror violence in the rating! We get a head sliced in half, bloody stabbings, a girl gets hit by a buss (blood does splatter, but the impact is not completely shown and happens very fast), and we also get a scene with some burnt bodies!Bottom Line: Clever little flick that doesn't hold back on what it promises and builds up to! It is amazing and was totally new at the time but now it has been repeated so many times with the sequels but I can not say that all the four sequels are bad!Rated: ""R"" for violence and terror, and for languageSuggested MPAA: Rated: ""R"" for strong horror violence, terror, language, and thematic materialIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5",5,It really doesn't hold back on its intense gore... this film has a lot to offer for a weak MPAA rating!,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,2467,"['was', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'could', 'hear', 'people', 'talk', 'was', 'how', 'awesome', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'was', 'amazingly', 'original', 'creatively', 'twisted', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'Sam', 'Rami', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'first', 'time', 'success', 'made', 'four', 'sequels', 'day', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'come', 'Plot', 'random', 'plane', 'crash', 'left', 'people', 'shocked', 'one', 'survivors', 'college', 'kid', 'named', 'Alex', 'Browning', 'vision', 'one', 'survivor', 'deaths', 'then', 'where', 'teen', 'envisioned', 'dies', 'Now', 'Alex', 'death', 'design', 'not', 'finished', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'least', 'skip', 'next', 'victim', 'final', 'destination', 'Review', 'Wow', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'confusing', 'yet', 'easily', 'understandable', 'plot', 'sequences', 'have', 'seen', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'bet', 'was', 'nightmare', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'writers', 'who', 'help', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'admit', 'idea', 'little', 'silly', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'deaths', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'creative', 'brutal', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'killer', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'lot', 'give', 'audience', 'deaths', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Acting', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'Night', 'Twisters', '1996', 'Ali', 'Carter', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '1999', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', '2003', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Parts', '3', '4', '2007/2010', 'Kristen', 'Cloke', 'Black', 'X-Mass', '2006', 'were', 'excellent', 'actors', 'so', 'were', 'rest', 'cast', 'Acting', 'felt', 'real', 'actors', 'died', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'performing', 'there', 'deaths', 'Gore', 'what', 'meant', 'Weak', 'MPAA', 'statement', 'was', 'very', 'brutal', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'least', 'strong', 'horror', 'violence', 'rating', 'get', 'head', 'sliced', 'half', 'bloody', 'stabbings', 'girl', 'hit', 'buss', 'blood', 'splatter', 'impact', 'not', 'completely', 'shown', 'very', 'fast', 'also', 'get', 'scene', 'burnt', 'bodies', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Clever', 'little', 'flick', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'what', 'up', 'amazing', 'was', 'totally', 'new', 'time', 'now', 'been', 'repeated', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'sequels', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'four', 'sequels', 'are', 'bad', 'Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'terror', 'languageSuggested', 'MPAA', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'horror', 'violence', 'terror', 'language', 'thematic', 'materialIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '10For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '5']",N/A

38942,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0780631684,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","First, a word of warning. (I won't call it a spoiler.) The marketing team for this movie has been playing up Tony Todd's involvement in its ads. I gotta tell you, Tony Todd's only in one scene, for about three minutes.  However, if you're me, three minutes of one of America's Most Underrated is  worth ninety-two minutes without him. But take the advertising with a grain  of salt. (Now, back to your regularly-scheduled review.)Glen Morgan  and James Wong, the team that brought you Chris Carter's two most  successful TV outings (The X-Files and Millennium), team up for their first  big-screen outing (assuming that the other one they've co-written, _The  Mark_, hasn't seen the light of day yet; if it has, I'm unaware). Morgan  and Wong take a genre-- the hip, funky serial killer flick revitalized a  few years back by Wes Craven-- and send it up gloriously, playing the humor  over the horror and giving us another cast of uppity teens who deserve the  worst.The plot is simple and original-- a teen has a premonition  that the plane he's about to go to Paris on is going to blow up. He warns  the people on the plane, gets a punch in the schnoz for his efforts, and  the combatants, plus some others, are removed from the vehicle-- which then  proceeds to blow up. According to a nameless mortician (Tony Todd-- he's  actually in the credits with the rather amusing name 'Bludworth'), by  getting themselves off the plane, those who survived the crash cheated  death-- which is coming back for them. Great plot for a slasher film, which  is exactly what this is, except that the slasher, instead of being the  class dork who didn't get enough attention at home, is Death himself.it's a clever twist, and many previous reviews have harped on the  fact that it's the _only_ clever twist, and that the rest of the movie is  by-the-book slasher film, with every cliche in the genre since Hitch gave  us _Murders in the Rue Morgue_. And those reviewers are not in any way  wrong; I saw every death at least a few seconds before it came. (Here's a  hint, and it's an ironclad rule in slasher films: the second someone talks  about getting away from the whole thing, that person will be dead within  the next five minutes. The first known occurrence of this is in _The  Mummy_, the version starring Boris Karloff, and it's been a cliche since  about five minutes after that movie's release.) What those reviewers are  forgetting is this: because of that particular plot twist, this movie is  going to attract a slew of people who have never been to a slasher film in  their lives, and they haven't seen it all before. The audience I sat in was  full of people who didn't expect a single twist, laughed at every gallows  joke, and generally had a fine time. (The rest of us came because Tony Todd  was in it, and by default, if you like Tony Todd, you've seen Candyman,  thus lengthening the cliche line.) Don't get me wrong, I laughed in all the  same places, and even if I knew when body #2 was going to happen, it was  still filmed so effectively that I think I may have actually squealed  (warning: if you had to close your eyes during THAT scene in American  History X, this will bug you).So anyway, this one almost requires a  split-personality rating. If you've never seen a film of this type before,  you're probably going to like it more than if you can sit down with a plot  summary in hand and map the whole thing out.",3,By-the-book slasher flick... but you WANT them to die,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,3430,"['First', 'word', 'warning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', 'spoiler', 'marketing', 'team', 'movie', 'been', 'playing', 'up', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'involvement', 'ads', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'three', 'minutes', 'However', ""'re"", 'three', 'minutes', 'one', 'America', 'Most', 'Underrated', 'worth', 'ninety-two', 'minutes', 'take', 'advertising', 'grain', 'salt', 'Now', 'back', 'regularly-scheduled', 'review', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'team', 'brought', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'two', 'most', 'successful', 'TV', 'outings', 'X-Files', 'Millennium', 'first', 'big-screen', 'outing', 'assuming', 'other', 'one', ""'ve"", 'co-written', '_The', 'Mark_', ""n't"", 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'yet', ""'m"", 'unaware', 'Morgan', 'Wong', 'take', 'genre', 'hip', 'funky', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick', 'revitalized', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'send', 'up', 'gloriously', 'playing', 'humor', 'horror', 'giving', 'cast', 'uppity', 'teens', 'who', 'deserve', 'worst.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'original', 'teen', 'premonition', 'plane', 'go', 'Paris', 'going', 'blow', 'up', 'people', 'plane', 'punch', 'schnoz', 'efforts', 'combatants', 'others', 'are', 'removed', 'vehicle', 'then', 'blow', 'up', 'According', 'nameless', 'mortician', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'actually', 'credits', 'rather', 'amusing', 'name', ""'Bludworth"", 'getting', 'off', 'plane', 'who', 'survived', 'crash', 'cheated', 'death', 'coming', 'back', 'Great', 'plot', 'slasher', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'slasher', 'instead', 'being', 'class', 'dork', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'attention', 'home', 'Death', 'himself.it', 'clever', 'twist', 'many', 'previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'harped', 'fact', '_only_', 'clever', 'twist', 'rest', 'movie', 'by-the-book', 'slasher', 'film', 'cliche', 'genre', 'Hitch', 'gave', '_Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue_', 'reviewers', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'wrong', 'saw', 'death', 'least', 'few', 'seconds', 'came', 'Here', 'hint', 'ironclad', 'rule', 'slasher', 'films', 'second', 'someone', 'talks', 'getting', 'away', 'whole', 'thing', 'person', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'next', 'five', 'minutes', 'first', 'known', 'occurrence', '_The', 'Mummy_', 'version', 'starring', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'been', 'cliche', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'release', 'What', 'reviewers', 'are', 'forgetting', 'particular', 'plot', 'twist', 'movie', 'going', 'attract', 'slew', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'slasher', 'film', 'lives', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'audience', 'sat', 'was', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'single', 'twist', 'laughed', 'gallows', 'joke', 'generally', 'had', 'fine', 'time', 'rest', 'came', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'was', 'default', 'like', 'Tony', 'Todd', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Candyman', 'thus', 'lengthening', 'cliche', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'laughed', 'same', 'places', 'even', 'knew', 'when', 'body', '2', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'was', 'still', 'filmed', 'so', 'effectively', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'squealed', 'warning', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'scene', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'will', 'bug', '.So', 'anyway', 'one', 'almost', 'split-personality', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'type', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'like', 'more', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'plot', 'summary', 'hand', 'map', 'whole', 'thing', 'out']",N/A

38945,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0780631684,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","""Final Destination"" is a fairly creepy, moderately entertaining little horror film dedicated to the proposition that, although one may not be able to exactly ""cheat"" death, one may be able to beat it on its own terms fair and square - provided one can figure out the rules that is.The movie begins as a group of forty high school students and three of their teachers board a plane departing from JFK on a field trip to Paris.  Immediately before takeoff, one student receives a premonition that the plane will explode moments after becoming airborne, a vision that manages to get himself and several other passengers safely off before the inevitable occurs.  But as Alex and his fellow survivors soon discover, Death is not to be avoided quite so easily, as each becomes the target of a systematic plan of elimination.If the details of the initial premise sound familiar, it is probably because they match almost perfectly those surrounding the downing of Flight 103 back in 1996.  Waving aside questions of taste and propriety - is it really right to use the details of a real life tragedy as fodder for a silly little horror flick? - let us concede that ""Final Destination"" taps into some pretty basic fears about the uncertain, random and arbitrary nature of Death.  The idea itself is enough to make us all stop and ponder the truth of our mortality and the truly tenuous thread by which we daily cling to this thing we call life.  But like so many horror films in the modern era, the premise is better than the execution.  The various deaths depicted herein become so choreographed and preposterous in their details that they actually end up diluting some of their own ability to disturb and terrify.  Indeed, the more elaborate and high tech the death scenes become, the less creepy they seem.  We become bemused and detached when we should be cringing and empathetic.  Death simply has to work too hard in some of these scenes and the strain shows.Thus, for all its originality of premise, the film, by making Death seem like nothing more disturbing than a conventional special effects showoff, robs Man's greatest enemy of his awe-inspiring and overwhelming power and sting!",3,imaginative thriller that overdoses on special effects,984873600,"03 18, 2001",2001,2182,"['Final', 'Destination', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'dedicated', 'proposition', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'exactly', 'cheat', 'death', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'beat', 'own', 'terms', 'fair', 'square', 'provided', 'one', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'rules', 'is.The', 'movie', 'group', 'forty', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'three', 'teachers', 'board', 'plane', 'departing', 'JFK', 'field', 'trip', 'Paris', 'Immediately', 'takeoff', 'one', 'student', 'premonition', 'plane', 'will', 'explode', 'moments', 'becoming', 'airborne', 'vision', 'get', 'several', 'other', 'passengers', 'safely', 'inevitable', 'occurs', 'Alex', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'soon', 'discover', 'Death', 'not', 'be', 'avoided', 'quite', 'so', 'easily', 'target', 'systematic', 'plan', 'elimination.If', 'details', 'initial', 'premise', 'sound', 'familiar', 'probably', 'match', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'surrounding', 'downing', 'Flight', '103', 'back', '1996', 'Waving', 'aside', 'questions', 'taste', 'propriety', 'really', 'right', 'use', 'details', 'real', 'life', 'tragedy', 'fodder', 'silly', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'let', 'concede', 'Final', 'Destination', 'taps', 'pretty', 'basic', 'fears', 'uncertain', 'random', 'arbitrary', 'nature', 'Death', 'idea', 'enough', 'make', 'stop', 'ponder', 'truth', 'mortality', 'truly', 'tenuous', 'thread', 'daily', 'cling', 'thing', 'call', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'modern', 'era', 'premise', 'better', 'execution', 'various', 'deaths', 'depicted', 'herein', 'become', 'so', 'choreographed', 'preposterous', 'details', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'diluting', 'own', 'ability', 'disturb', 'terrify', 'Indeed', 'more', 'elaborate', 'high', 'tech', 'death', 'become', 'less', 'creepy', 'seem', 'become', 'bemused', 'detached', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'cringing', 'empathetic', 'Death', 'simply', 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'scenes', 'strain', 'shows.Thus', 'originality', 'premise', 'film', 'making', 'Death', 'seem', 'nothing', 'more', 'disturbing', 'conventional', 'special', 'effects', 'showoff', 'robs', 'Man', 'greatest', 'enemy', 'awe-inspiring', 'overwhelming', 'power', 'sting']",N/A

The movie opens admirably at the airport, Devon Sawa has a vision of his plane crashing before a class trip. He and several others get off the plane only to discover that it does crash, but things take a turn for the worse when they all begin to die strange deaths. Sawa, Ali Larter, and Kerr Smith all play their roles very honestly and naturally. As for the supporting characters, Kristin Cloke, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, and Amanda Detmer all turn in excellent performances. Tony Todd makes an amusing and well conceived cameo as a sinister mortician who may or may not be death himself. The death scenes are original and unexpected and the special effects are breathtaking. The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see. This movie also makes you think about destiny and how you live your life.

Half of them frankly ludicruous they may be, but you can relate  to them having read about them in the papers which makes it hit home. There  in lies it's secret that the god aweful let down Scream 3 didn't have.  Though there is the occaissional bit of gore, Final Destination plays off  suspense more (especially during the opening which will put you off flying  for a few weeks). OK so it's not exactly primal fear and yeah i know that  films like The Omen and amityville tried a few years ago, but you can  relate to some of the deaths in this one much more.This isn't the usual  rip off or 'homagised' style suspense as some like to call it either. There  is a 'shock horror !' shred of originality in Final Destinations concept  and the way it's pulled off. No stupid thumping pop soundtrack either, in  fact thank god there is not one ironic refference or pop culture related  iconography in the picture at all. Final Destination gets back to what  horror is about before it turned to audience friendly trash - scares. Not  jumps, but scares. It may not be Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The  Left or The Evil Dead btu it's certainly better than most recent offerings  and at least tries to hurt the audience rather than just make them giggle.I saw this movie at the cinema thinking 'pop cultre scream clone',  thakfully it wasn't.

FINAL DESTINATION, a great piece of cinematic junk food, opens with one of the most frightening depictions of airplane disaster you've ever seen, and if you can get past that, you'll be shoveling the popcorn in, begging for more.Devon Sawa and his really white classmates board a plane for an end-of-the-year field trip. Among them are ""Dawson's Creek"" star Kerr Smith as your garden-variety jock jerk and Ali Larter as that most head-scratching of movie constructs, the gorgeous geek who's obviously the coolest chick in school. Sawa has a vision of the aircraft going up in flames, so of course he causes a scene and gets himself, his buddy, Smith, Smith's girlfriend, Seann William Scott and a teacher thrown off. Larter follows -- because she's got second billing -- and Smith throws a hissy fit until they see the plane become a fireball in mid-air. Sawa rationally concludes that they were all supposed to die, and that Death will soon be tracking them down.Is he psychic? The movie doesn't seem to care, so why should we?And here's where we get down to the nitty gritty: Death dispatches pouty starlets and mouth-breathers with a creativity we haven't seen since Jason Voorhees left the cineplex. A groovy variation on the teen-slasher movie, FINAL DESTINATION turns even the most mundane household items into torture devices. Director James Wong has a blast making us second-guess what he'll use to off his characters, and we wouldn't dream of spoiling any of the jolts for you. It's also nice to see a post-SCREAM thriller get laughs not from a more-ironic-than-thou aesthetic, but from horror-movie camp laid on as thick as your grandma's fruitcake. (Seconds after a friend is decapitated, a straight-faced Larter tells Sawa, ""Get your head together!"")The DVD extras play like a slumber party, with kooky interactive games helpfully revealing the date of your death (to the hour) and the amount of clairvoyant ability you possess, as well as the story of a real-life psychic! (Cue the ""Twilight Zone"" theme.) On a more intriguing note, the filmmakers include a documentary about the test-screening process, and how it saved FINAL DESTINATION from being as pretentious as the latest Michelle Pfeiffer snooze-fest. We're all for directors keeping their work pure, but let's get real: no one would mistake FINAL DESTINATION for an art film.

Now, having escaped death, they discover that they were intended to die on that plane and are now being hunted by the Grim Reaper himself. Much toilet sitting, obscene language and gory accidental deaths follow.Basically a cross between DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY(or rather DEATH GOES TO WORK), THE OMEN and the Room for One More segment from DEAD OF NIGHT, the film is basically a series of accidental death sequences as the various teens either buy it or not. Supposedly set on Long Island, the film is geographically unconvincing and its idea of Jones Beach is dubious at best.The problem of dead teenagers movies is that the dead teenagers are usually unlikable and disposable and modern dead teenagers are, if this is possible, even more unlikable and dispoable than their 70s and 80s predecessors. The film suffers from a lack of a strong villain. Death is just a briefly glimpsed invisible cloud. A bit of Fredric March would have gone a long way. Tony Todd is fun in one scene as a mortician but ultimately the picture has a dramatic void at its center. And for a film about death and cosmic fate, the film is surprisingly devoid of any presence of Christianity. Still it moves reasonably well. Is not bad nor terribly good. Amazingly there were two sequels which beggars the imagination since the first film seems so empty of anything to justify a continuation. This viewer will not be seeing them.

38974,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,0780631684,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","The ""Final Destination"" series started off with this low-key and middle-budget suspense film. Cast with a bunch of young actors in a twist on the old slasher formula, except this time, the mad killer is old Grimm himself. It makes this movie a minor classic, in that there's never anyone chasing these kids through the woods (so to speak). You don't need to set up a story about the killer that got killed by the angry mob or tormented by nasty classmates. Death doesn't need that kind of contraption, Death just is.Of the actors, only Sean William Scott (aka ""Stifler"") andHeroes'Ari Larter have moved up from this series starter. Then one of the kids - Devon Sawa - has a premonition that gets him and six classmates plus one teacher booted from the flight. Said plane then explodes upon take-off. This team of cast-offs realize they've cheated death...or did they? Seems Death's Design isn't to crazy about being disrupted, and comes back for the stragglers. This is where ""Final Destination"" slips back into formula, and became more inventive in the way the teens get killed off.

38975,A2B7LP1CE8DN5Q,0780631684,"Timothy Rhodes ""ronin1272""","[3, 3]","This was the first time that I bought a movie based on friends recommendation.  I wanted to see it in the theater, but missed it.  I am happy to say that I really enjoyed the movie and the few features that were included on the DVD.  The features may be few in quanity, but are unique in quality.  Besides the norms, there is a &quot;Death Clock&quot;, that after you answer a few questions, it will tell you, up to the day, when you will die.  I know its only for fun and based on medical facts, but its kind of cool, too.  The other unique feature is the actual test that was created, in the 50's, I believe, to see if people have any psychic abilities.  There is a series of 60 questions, based on the &quot;symbol&quot; cards that I am sure you have all see at one time or another.  After answering the questions, you will be told if you have the &quot;third eye&quot;.  Apparently, I don't, which is a shame, it would save me $8.00 a pop at the theaters for movies that stink!  Ok, for those of you who haven't seen it, a quick synopsis.  A high school kid going on a school trip discovers that he has psychic abilites when he sees the plane blowing up.  He manages to get himself off the plane along with some other students and his teacher.  That turns out to be a mistake as death does not like to be cheated.  The rest of the movie consists of him trying to figure out how to interpret his visions and hints to save his friends from deaths' grasp.  Very original and suspenseful, a great movie.  Oh, I almost forgot, there are two deleted scenes linked to an alternate ending included on the DVD.  All in all, if you have seen the movie and liked it, buy it.  If you haven't, take a chance and buy it, its worth the average price tag.

This is one of, if not the smartest, horror movies to come along in a very long time. This film is set up brilliantly, with many death scenes flawlessly laid out.  There are many points in this movie that you can not believe what has just happened. There are scenes that will make you look at everyday items in a different way. For example, a tile floor will be looked at with a little more skepticism from the fearful few that can believe that this will happen.  This film is very well acted, and there is not a point that you get sick of all of the actors, as you do in other teenager horror films. You may start to hate a character, but this will only want you to watch to see what happens next, to see if his/her number will be the next one up. The DVD offers numerous interesting features, including a game that will tell you when you are expected to die, and one that will test your skills at the paranormal.

Now, having cheated death and that which was meant to happen, the seven survivors are left to be stalked by the menacing powers of fate. They only have so much time to figure out the pattern that death has set before them and how to prevent the powers that be from deciding their ultimate fate.I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't anything too involved and nothing you really had to think too hard about, and that's exactly what I was looking for. It presented an interesting idea of escaping the path that is set before us and taking control of the things that are often beyond our grasp, if but for a mere instant.The entire movie looked and felt like an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and that probably added to some of my enjoyment.

Everything leading up to the plane crash and its aftermath was amazingly well done - a mix of humor, Hitchcockian suspense and foreboding.

I was impressed by how detailed this attention was to the loss of human life in what presumably is a typical teenage horror film. From this high point, however, the film degenerated and became a typical slasher film, absurd and rather silly. By the end of the film I had lost interest and it became nonsensical.

Those who were removed from the plane, including him (Alex), were left frightened and confused.  The rest of the story involes how they &quot;cheated death&quot; by getting off the plane and not dying there where they were supposed to, and then being picked off by some supernatural source to make sure they die like they were supposed to.  So, Alex finds out &quot;who's next&quot; and it's a race against evil for survival.
