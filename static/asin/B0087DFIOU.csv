1547313,AVEAF1857NCYR,B0087DFIOU,,"[0, 0]","Get the Gringo is a crime thriller starring Mel Gibson. I don't remember it getting a wide release, probably due to Gibson being poisonous in Hollywoood, but it's a good movie and worth watching.Gibson plays a professional criminal who commits a multi-million-dollar robbery and ends up in Mexico.  Corrupt Mexican cops take the money and throw him in ""El Pueblito,"" a prison/city ruled by criminals.  Families, including children, live with the prisoners inside the walls.  Life in El Pueblito is nasty and brutish.  Luckily, Gibson's character is a real brute.His character is not a nice man.  He's mean enough to steal from a blind guy, and the sort of thug who has removed his own fingerprints and berates a heist partner for inconveniencing him by getting gut-shot.  Still, he has Gibson's charm, and he makes friends, including a kid played by professional scene-stealer Kevin Hernandez, and the kid's hot mom, played by Dolores Heredia. The Gringo is struggling to survive and at the same time scheming to get his money back.  Meanwhile, we become aware that criminals on both sides of the border are after the money, and will stop at nothing to get it.The plot requires some leaps of faith, some very convenient coincidences.  Still, that doesn't subtract too much from a slam-bang action thriller that barrels along at a relentless pace.  If you watch this movie, I expect you will be sucked in.

1547317,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B0087DFIOU,,"[0, 0]","In recent years Mel Gibson has successfully self destructed and taken his career along with himself into a black hole. Which is a terrible shame as he is one of the best and most charismatic actors to ever grace the screen, but personal demons and a less than friendly public demeanor has all but destroyed his once glorious star power. Get the Gringo should have helped set things right, if not karmicly at least financially,  but a poor release strategy has kept many people from seeing the film. Now out on DVD and Blu-ray, this film from first time director Adam Grunberg is a surprising little gem lost in the summer glut.Gibson stars as Reginald T. Barnes, if we are to believe that is his name, an ex-sniper turned career criminal. The movie opens with he and an accomplice dressed as clowns and fleeing American law enforcement. A robbery the two were involved with goes south, so does he, escaping across the border only to land in police custody on the other side. Relieved of his booty and sent to  El Puebilto, a Mexican prison, on trumped up charges. He is forced to change his game strategy, not only to survive, but to also get a little payback.Once inside, he finds the Mexican prison system to be a little unusual. The prison is run by one man, Javi (Daniel Gimez Cacho), who deals in everything from prostitution to drugs inside. He discovers that whole families are living inside, non convicts are free to come and go. There he unlikely befriends a ten year-old kid (Kevin Hernandez) and his mom (Dolores Heredia), who as it turns out have a score to settle with Javi.Gibson triumphantly returns to the kind of role and screen persona that made him such a popular action star in the 80's and 90's. Displaying oodles of charm, sarcasm and bravado tough guy attitude. A role he knows so well, not just because he has mastered it, but because he is also one of the screenwriters along with director Grunberg and Stacy Perskie.Get the Gringo has a great sense of parody, you could say it takes place in an extreme prison. Filled with great looking action scenes, sharp editing (by Steven Rosenblum),  and keen photography (from Benoit Debie). Shot on a relatively low budget, Mel used to get twenty-million a movie, now he stars in movies that cost twenty-million to make. The picture never looks cheap or shoddy.Originally titled ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"", the ironic title better describes the concept healthier than the more expletive genre title does. A loose and very funny modern crime picture that is sure to appeal to a large audience, once word gets out and the general public finds it. Of course, there may have to be some forgiveness granted to Gibson, which for some will be too tall an order.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,should coulda woulda been a contender,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2766,"['recent', 'years', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'successfully', 'self', 'destructed', 'taken', 'career', 'black', 'hole', 'Which', 'terrible', 'shame', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'personal', 'demons', 'less', 'friendly', 'public', 'demeanor', 'destroyed', 'once', 'glorious', 'star', 'power', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'should', 'have', 'helped', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'not', 'karmicly', 'least', 'financially', 'poor', 'release', 'strategy', 'kept', 'many', 'people', 'seeing', 'film', 'Now', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Adam', 'Grunberg', 'surprising', 'little', 'gem', 'lost', 'summer', 'glut.Gibson', 'stars', 'Reginald', 'T.', 'Barnes', 'are', 'believe', 'name', 'ex-sniper', 'turned', 'career', 'criminal', 'movie', 'accomplice', 'dressed', 'clowns', 'fleeing', 'American', 'law', 'enforcement', 'robbery', 'two', 'were', 'involved', 'south', 'so', 'escaping', 'border', 'only', 'land', 'police', 'custody', 'other', 'side', 'Relieved', 'booty', 'sent', 'El', 'Puebilto', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'trumped', 'up', 'charges', 'forced', 'change', 'game', 'strategy', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'payback.Once', 'inside', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'system', 'be', 'little', 'unusual', 'prison', 'run', 'one', 'man', 'Javi', 'Daniel', 'Gimez', 'Cacho', 'who', 'everything', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'inside', 'whole', 'families', 'are', 'living', 'non', 'convicts', 'are', 'free', 'come', 'go', 'unlikely', 'ten', 'year-old', 'kid', 'Kevin', 'Hernandez', 'mom', 'Dolores', 'Heredia', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'score', 'settle', 'Javi.Gibson', 'triumphantly', 'kind', 'role', 'screen', 'persona', 'made', 'popular', 'action', 'star', '80', '90', 'Displaying', 'oodles', 'charm', 'sarcasm', 'bravado', 'tough', 'guy', 'attitude', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'just', 'mastered', 'also', 'one', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'Grunberg', 'Stacy', 'Perskie.Get', 'Gringo', 'great', 'sense', 'parody', 'could', 'say', 'place', 'extreme', 'prison', 'Filled', 'great', 'looking', 'action', 'scenes', 'sharp', 'editing', 'Steven', 'Rosenblum', 'keen', 'photography', 'Benoit', 'Debie', 'Shot', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'Mel', 'used', 'get', 'twenty-million', 'movie', 'now', 'movies', 'cost', 'twenty-million', 'make', 'picture', 'never', 'cheap', 'shoddy.Originally', 'titled', 'How', 'Spent', 'My', 'Summer', 'Vacation', 'ironic', 'title', 'better', 'concept', 'healthier', 'more', 'expletive', 'genre', 'title', 'A', 'loose', 'very', 'funny', 'modern', 'crime', 'picture', 'sure', 'appeal', 'large', 'audience', 'once', 'word', 'out', 'general', 'public', 'course', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'forgiveness', 'granted', 'Gibson', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'tall', 'order.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A
1547318,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0087DFIOU,,"[0, 0]","Mel Gibson is back in action. In ""Get the Gringo"" (also titled as ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"") Gibson plays a hardened criminal (credited only as Driver) with stolen money. While running away from the law, the ""driver"" literally jumps across the Mexican border and ends up being caught and sent to El Pueblito, a real-life prison that looks more like a sort of a small town.There, while learning how to survive the chaotic community rife with corruption and violence, Mel Gibson's ""Driver"" befriends a ten-year-old cigarette-smoking boy (Kevin Hernandez) and his upright mother (Dolores Heredia). The Driver soon finds that tough and street-smart as he is, the boy needs protection from the gangsters, which the Driver provides. But that means mixing up with the Mexican mobsters as well as American ones.The premise sounds interesting, but don't expect Elmore Leonard. Characters, especially the criminals, are caricatures, not given personalities enough distinct to tell one from another.

1547322,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B0087DFIOU,,"[0, 1]","First-time director Adrian Grunberg partners with action veteran Mel Gibson on this Mexico-set crime thriller which stars Gibson as an American career criminal on who finds himself doing hard time in an outrageously-corrupt Mexican prison. Once I saw the first trailer for this film, I knew it was going to be an interesting, albeit fun, and wild ride.Ok, I have to start by admitting I needed to look up the word Gringo prior to writing this review. I've heard the term before, and in the context I've heard it in it has always seemed derogatory. Gibson's character is the Gringo, or white foreigner in a Spanish-speaking place. From his arrival into the shady prison, it's clear he's unwelcome. Looks can be deceiving though, as we soon learn that the gringo wields certain skills that improve his chances of survival in the pen.Driver, as Gibson's character is credited (he goes by a few names in the film), landed in jail after driving off with what we are led to believe is at least two million dollars. The corrupt Mexican officials take advantage of their find and leave Driver to the sharks in jail. As it turns out however, the stolen money belonged to some very high-powered individuals who want it back. To top things off, the jail houses one particular inmate who runs the show behind the scenes who may cause trouble for Driver.While in prison, Driver befriends a young boy living with his jailed mother (entire families can live in this jail...I was as shocked as you are). The kid (Kevin Hernandez) reminds Driver of himself a bit, and the two help each other out. The boy and his mother (Dolores Heredia) also have a few secrets that tie them to the prison's kingpin Javi (Daniel Gim&eacute;nez Cacho). While the Driver is a loner who from the get-go just wants to leave with his money, he is drawn to the mother and son and finds himself getting stuck into a much stickier situation.Get the Gringo met my expectations and more. I knew that it would contain over-the-top scenarios, wild action and good amounts of humor. It delivered those things, and even exceeded my expectations in some respects. Say what you will about the man's personal affairs, but Mel Gibson woos and entertains, especially in these types of action roles. His character is a badass with an ironic sense of humor. The action scenes are exciting, often shocking, and definitely prevalent. I was in disbelief about the whole prison situation, but that only added to the quirkiness of the picture.I knew this would be a fun flick and it certainly was. The story was surprisingly clever and had a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming. Grunberg impresses with his first feature, adding a gritty and energetic style. Combined with Gibson's charisma, adrenaline-filled action, and enough sub-plots to keep you from pulling your hair out in boredom, Get the Gringo is sure to be the sleeper action flick of the year.Source: criticnic.com 17-July-2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",4,A wild and fun ride,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2982,"['First-time', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Grunberg', 'partners', 'action', 'veteran', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Mexico-set', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Gibson', 'American', 'career', 'criminal', 'who', 'doing', 'hard', 'time', 'outrageously-corrupt', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'Once', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'fun', 'wild', 'ride.Ok', 'have', 'start', 'admitting', 'needed', 'look', 'up', 'word', 'Gringo', 'prior', 'writing', 'review', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'term', 'context', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'always', 'seemed', 'derogatory', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Gringo', 'white', 'foreigner', 'Spanish-speaking', 'place', 'arrival', 'shady', 'prison', 'clear', 'unwelcome', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'though', 'soon', 'learn', 'gringo', 'certain', 'skills', 'improve', 'chances', 'survival', 'pen.Driver', 'Gibson', 'character', 'credited', 'few', 'names', 'film', 'landed', 'jail', 'driving', 'off', 'what', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'least', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'corrupt', 'Mexican', 'officials', 'take', 'advantage', 'find', 'leave', 'Driver', 'sharks', 'jail', 'out', 'however', 'stolen', 'money', 'belonged', 'very', 'high-powered', 'individuals', 'who', 'want', 'back', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'jail', 'houses', 'one', 'particular', 'inmate', 'who', 'show', 'scenes', 'who', 'may', 'cause', 'trouble', 'Driver.While', 'prison', 'Driver', 'young', 'boy', 'living', 'jailed', 'mother', 'entire', 'families', 'can', 'live', 'jail', 'was', 'as', 'shocked', 'are', 'kid', 'Kevin', 'Hernandez', 'Driver', 'bit', 'two', 'help', 'other', 'out', 'boy', 'mother', 'Dolores', 'Heredia', 'also', 'have', 'few', 'secrets', 'tie', 'prison', 'kingpin', 'Javi', 'Daniel', 'Gim', 'eacute', 'Cacho', 'Driver', 'loner', 'who', 'get-go', 'just', 'leave', 'money', 'drawn', 'mother', 'son', 'getting', 'stuck', 'much', 'stickier', 'Gringo', 'met', 'expectations', 'more', 'knew', 'would', 'contain', 'over-the-top', 'scenarios', 'wild', 'action', 'good', 'amounts', 'humor', 'delivered', 'things', 'even', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'respects', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'man', 'personal', 'affairs', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'woos', 'entertains', 'especially', 'types', 'action', 'roles', 'character', 'badass', 'ironic', 'sense', 'humor', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'often', 'shocking', 'definitely', 'prevalent', 'was', 'disbelief', 'whole', 'prison', 'situation', 'only', 'added', 'quirkiness', 'picture.I', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'flick', 'certainly', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'clever', 'had', 'few', 'twists', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Grunberg', 'first', 'feature', 'adding', 'gritty', 'energetic', 'style', 'Combined', 'Gibson', 'charisma', 'adrenaline-filled', 'action', 'enough', 'sub-plots', 'keep', 'pulling', 'hair', 'out', 'boredom', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'sure', 'be', 'sleeper', 'action', 'flick', 'year.Source', 'criticnic.com', '17-July-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",N/A

1547325,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0087DFIOU,,"[1, 1]","It's unfortunate that in recent years you rarely hear Mel Gibson's name mentioned outside of the tabloids. After all, the man has enjoyed a successful acting career for decades and is an Oscar-winning director. This is his ""third"" comeback of sorts. He had already stirred up controversy when he returned to the screen for the first time in six years for 2010's Edge of Darkness. More personal controversy followed and his next role was supposed to be his dramatic comeback, but 2011's The Beaver was underwhelming. Now we have Get the Gringo, a crime caper co-written by Gibson himself, which made it into a few theaters but was ultimately treated as a VOD release. Gibson chalks this up to VOD being ""the future,"" but the timing is a little suspicious. I bring this up only because this is a prime example of the necessity of setting aside the art from the artist. No matter what occurs in Gibson's personal life, this film is proof that he's still a capable actor and screenwriter with plenty of good work left in him. Get the Gringo isn't exactly an unsung masterpiece, but it's supremely pleasing entertainment.The film opens with two men dressed as clowns in a high-speed police chase along the Mexico border after what appears to be a botched robbery. The driver (Gibson), the gringo of the title, is eventually caught and sent to a Mexican prison that is unlike any prison moviegoers and the character himself have encountered. The driver is a career criminal and he begins wreaking havoc in the prison to make money and stay alive. Inside he befriends a 10-year-old boy (Kevin Hernandez) who knows the ropes and has a rare blood type that the guy in charge of the prison requires for a liver transplant. Gibson also provides a dryly humorous narration of the proceedings.The film is directed by Adrian Grunberg, with a script he co-wrote with Gibson and Stacy Perskie. With a 90-minute running time, the script is very tight and ingeniously plotted. It allows Gibson to flex his muscles as a writer with a relatively straight-forward comedy/crime-caper, as well as allowing him to remind moviegoers what a talented actor he is.As the highly resourceful and sympathetic tough-guy, Gibson shows he still has a charming screen presence and his performance is gleefully entertaining. There's energy and spark that we haven't seen form him in sometime that seems to indicate he got bit by the acting bug again in a substantial way. He's not going to win awards for this role, but it's a high-energy and very funny performance that is a joy to watch.The film itself is essentially a glorified B-movie, but it's great, fast-moving entertainment. Simultaneously funny with exciting, over-the-top action sequences that move the film along quickly. The only misstep on a technical level is Benot Debie's cinematography, which is shoddy and murky enough that it recalls straight-to-video fare and cheapens the overall look. With fine supporting appearances by Peter Stormare and Dean Norris (best known as Hank in Breaking Bad), there is nothing remarkable about Get the Gringo but it's breezy, fun entertainment that shows Gibson is ready to be taken seriously again.GRADE: B+",4,An Entertaining Crime-Caper,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,3175,"['unfortunate', 'recent', 'years', 'rarely', 'hear', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'name', 'mentioned', 'tabloids', 'man', 'enjoyed', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'decades', 'Oscar-winning', 'director', 'third', 'comeback', 'sorts', 'had', 'already', 'stirred', 'up', 'controversy', 'when', 'returned', 'screen', 'first', 'time', 'six', 'years', '2010', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'More', 'personal', 'controversy', 'followed', 'next', 'role', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dramatic', 'comeback', '2011', 'Beaver', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'Now', 'have', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'crime', 'caper', 'co-written', 'Gibson', 'made', 'few', 'theaters', 'was', 'ultimately', 'treated', 'VOD', 'release', 'Gibson', 'up', 'VOD', 'being', 'future', 'timing', 'little', 'suspicious', 'bring', 'up', 'only', 'prime', 'example', 'necessity', 'setting', 'aside', 'art', 'artist', 'matter', 'what', 'Gibson', 'personal', 'life', 'film', 'proof', 'still', 'capable', 'actor', 'screenwriter', 'plenty', 'good', 'work', 'left', 'Get', 'Gringo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'unsung', 'masterpiece', 'supremely', 'pleasing', 'entertainment.The', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'dressed', 'clowns', 'high-speed', 'police', 'chase', 'Mexico', 'border', 'what', 'be', 'botched', 'robbery', 'driver', 'Gibson', 'gringo', 'title', 'eventually', 'caught', 'sent', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'prison', 'moviegoers', 'character', 'have', 'encountered', 'driver', 'career', 'criminal', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'prison', 'make', 'money', 'stay', 'alive', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'Kevin', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'ropes', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'guy', 'charge', 'prison', 'liver', 'transplant', 'Gibson', 'also', 'dryly', 'humorous', 'narration', 'proceedings.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Adrian', 'Grunberg', 'script', 'co-wrote', 'Gibson', 'Stacy', 'Perskie', '90-minute', 'running', 'time', 'script', 'very', 'tight', 'ingeniously', 'plotted', 'Gibson', 'flex', 'muscles', 'writer', 'relatively', 'straight-forward', 'comedy/crime-caper', 'as', 'well', 'allowing', 'remind', 'moviegoers', 'what', 'talented', 'actor', 'highly', 'resourceful', 'sympathetic', 'tough-guy', 'Gibson', 'still', 'charming', 'screen', 'presence', 'performance', 'gleefully', 'entertaining', 'energy', 'spark', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'form', 'sometime', 'indicate', 'got', 'bit', 'acting', 'bug', 'again', 'substantial', 'way', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'role', 'high-energy', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'glorified', 'B-movie', 'great', 'fast-moving', 'entertainment', 'Simultaneously', 'funny', 'exciting', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'move', 'film', 'quickly', 'only', 'misstep', 'technical', 'level', 'Benot', 'Debie', 'cinematography', 'shoddy', 'murky', 'enough', 'straight-to-video', 'fare', 'overall', 'look', 'fine', 'supporting', 'appearances', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'best', 'known', 'Hank', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'breezy', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'Gibson', 'ready', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'again.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

1547329,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B0087DFIOU,,"[1, 2]","All my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from Standard Def DVD quality to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant. In this case, I did not see Get the Gringo in theaters nor did I have the Standard Def version prior to buying this film on Blu Ray so the review is just about the quality of the video and audio on BR.  There are plenty of other reviews on Amazon that provide you with opinions on the acting, plot, summaries and Mel's personal battles, losses and victories so I will dispense with those. My rating of 4 stars is strictly based upon the quality of the actual Blu Ray and not on my opinion regarding the movie itself.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO.....I was surprised that the video imaging was as clean as it was.  With a relatively high Mbps rate in the low 30s as an average, there were no artifacts, dropouts or banding during the course of the film.  There were plenty of darker and shadow scenes but details were not lost due to over crushing the blacks.  Color grading was, to me, unnatural in that the editors used the same golden, yellow color grading that you usually see in films taking place in the Mid-East.  Neither Mexico nor the Mid-East looks that way but for some reason that is the color grading editors seem to adhere to with these type of films.  However, skin tones appeared fairly natural during closeups and there was no blurring or ghosting during any fast moving action scenes.  Much of the dialogue is in Spanish with white subtitles that can, in a few scenes, be difficult to see when placed over a background that does not offer sharp contrast to the lettering.  The video imaging does deserve a 4 for its quality.AUDIO....The audio is a DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack that provided clean and easy to hear dialogue.  This transparency lends itself to nicely used steering of foley audio fx between the left and right surrounds in the front audio stage.  The rears are, more often than not, used primarily for low volume ambience with little discreet directionality coming from them.  However, and especially early in the film, there was some very nice panning between the front and rear sound stages.  During the prison scenes where much is going on all around, the surrounds are not used nearly as much as they could have been.  Your LFE channel does have frequent moments of use but never needs to get down deep in Hz.EXTRAS...Once again you are forced to pay for 4 or 5 previews of other films and an ad espousing the greatness of Blu Ray.  I really do hate these things as they take up room on the disc demanding that even more compression be added to the video encoding as well as making us pay good money for advertisements.With that rant out of the way,  there are several extras which are really chapters covering 'The Making of'.  This type of thing is getting more and more common with Blu Rays.  They produce one 'Making of' documentary and break it up into 10 minute chapters or topics making you think you are getting a bunch of extras rather than just the one.  Never the less, I found them interesting.There are no deleted scenes or blooper reels.There is supplied a digital hard copy DVD which can be downloaded to either PC or Mac's iTunes.  I always prefer using iTunes to things like Ultra Violet and the download went very smoothly.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

1547335,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0087DFIOU,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","Basically blacklisted by Hollywood for his reprehensible anti-Semitic utterances, Mel Gibson has decided to continue his movie career without the support of the major film studios (this movie was not released theatrically in the United States). In Get the Gringo, this has resulted in a film with an over the top, not holds barred violence that would almost certainly have been toned down if released by a major studio.Gibson is an American (his real name is never given in the film) who is captured by the Mexican police when he is fleeing American authorities in a car chase along the border. With two million dollars in the car. He is send to El Pueblito, a prison that seems more like a third world slum market hellhole than a place of incarceration. The prisoners live among their families in slum housing conditions, and there is a big square inside with market stands. Of course not every prisoner is equal - basically the prison is run by the top gangster Javi, the prison warden being an employee of him.

I'm not going to tell more about the plot, but it involves very violent goings-on, including an over the top Peckimpah-style shootout in the prison plaza.Some might criticize Gibson for making Mexico looks very bad - though nothing here shows the brutality of the present drug war there - yet the American characters are not very good either (the most likable characters in the film are Mexican, the 10 year old boy and his mother).For its style and good storytelling (the director is Adrian Grunberg, in his movie debut; Grunberg and Gibson co-wrote), I recommend this - though it is obviously not for everyone.",4,Violent and stylish action film is well made - though not for everyone,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1938,"['Basically', 'blacklisted', 'Hollywood', 'reprehensible', 'anti-Semitic', 'utterances', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'decided', 'continue', 'movie', 'career', 'support', 'major', 'film', 'studios', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'theatrically', 'United', 'States', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'resulted', 'film', 'top', 'not', 'barred', 'violence', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'released', 'major', 'studio.Gibson', 'American', 'real', 'name', 'never', 'given', 'film', 'who', 'captured', 'Mexican', 'police', 'when', 'fleeing', 'American', 'authorities', 'car', 'chase', 'border', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'car', 'send', 'El', 'Pueblito', 'prison', 'more', 'third', 'world', 'slum', 'market', 'hellhole', 'place', 'incarceration', 'prisoners', 'live', 'families', 'slum', 'housing', 'conditions', 'big', 'square', 'market', 'stands', 'course', 'not', 'prisoner', 'equal', 'basically', 'prison', 'run', 'top', 'gangster', 'Javi', 'prison', 'warden', 'being', 'employee', 'learning', 'who', 'top', 'whom', 'two', 'friends', 'jail', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'whom', 'cigarette', 'kind', 'scene', 'unlikely', 'be', 'released', 'major', 'studio', 'mother', 'little', 'boy', 'very', 'important', 'personal', 'grudge', 'Javi', 'plot', 'next', 'moves', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'very', 'violent', 'goings-on', 'including', 'top', 'Peckimpah-style', 'shootout', 'prison', 'plaza.Some', 'might', 'criticize', 'Gibson', 'making', 'Mexico', 'very', 'bad', 'nothing', 'here', 'brutality', 'present', 'drug', 'war', 'yet', 'American', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'Mexican', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'mother', 'style', 'good', 'storytelling', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Grunberg', 'movie', 'debut', 'Grunberg', 'Gibson', 'co-wrote', 'recommend', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A

1547344,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0087DFIOU,DanD,"[9, 10]","The title of this review pretty much sums up GET THE GRINGO: a violent, darkly humored noir piece.  (A friend of mine described it as PAYBACK'S ""spiritual prequel."")  The film starts with a masked thief (Gibson) making his getaway across the desert.  He ends up crashing (literally) across the border, and winds up stuck in El Pueblito, a Mexican prison run more like a small town.  He befriends a kid (the excellent Kevin Hernandez) and his mother (Dolores Heredia), while at the same time trying to get his money back, protect the boy (who is basically a living organ farm), dealing with a corrupt U.S. official (Peter Gerety), and the mobster he stole the money from in the first place (Peter Stormare doing his crazy thing).As you can tell, there's a lot going on here.  Too much so, perhaps.  The film feels too much like Gibson's previous PAYBECK (basically, it's the same thing, except half the film is in Spanish); this is both in terms of tone (very dark in spots, very humorous in others) and plot.  Gibson is great, as usual; say what you want to about the man, but as an actor, no one does likeable sleaze better.  He's still got some bite to him, and there's never any knowing what his character will do next.  The direction, too, is solid; the problems lie with the script, which tries to do too much.  The subplots stumble over each other; this is, at its core, a simple story, like PAYBACK (I'm thinking the Director's Cut here), and should not go off on so many tangents.  Still, in terms of grit and fun, GET THE GRINGO offers plenty of both.  And, let's face it, it's nice to see Mel Gibson sinking his fangs into a dirty role again.  Who knows--if he somehow cleans up his public image, he could be having blockbusters again.  (Well, maybe not; but at least he's still got the chops to pull them off.)",3,"""Don't bleed on the money!""",1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1821,"['title', 'review', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'GET', 'GRINGO', 'violent', 'darkly', 'humored', 'noir', 'piece', 'friend', 'mine', 'described', 'PAYBACK', 'spiritual', 'prequel', 'film', 'masked', 'thief', 'Gibson', 'making', 'getaway', 'desert', 'up', 'crashing', 'literally', 'border', 'up', 'stuck', 'El', 'Pueblito', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'run', 'more', 'small', 'town', 'kid', 'excellent', 'Kevin', 'Hernandez', 'mother', 'Dolores', 'Heredia', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'protect', 'boy', 'who', 'basically', 'living', 'organ', 'farm', 'dealing', 'corrupt', 'U.S.', 'official', 'Peter', 'Gerety', 'mobster', 'stole', 'money', 'first', 'place', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'doing', 'crazy', 'thing', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'Too', 'much', 'so', 'perhaps', 'film', 'feels', 'too', 'much', 'Gibson', 'previous', 'PAYBECK', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'Spanish', 'terms', 'tone', 'very', 'dark', 'spots', 'very', 'humorous', 'others', 'plot', 'Gibson', 'great', 'usual', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'man', 'actor', 'one', 'likeable', 'sleaze', 'better', 'still', 'got', 'bite', 'never', 'knowing', 'what', 'character', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'direction', 'too', 'solid', 'problems', 'lie', 'script', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'subplots', 'stumble', 'other', 'core', 'simple', 'story', 'PAYBACK', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Director', 'Cut', 'here', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'tangents', 'Still', 'terms', 'grit', 'fun', 'GET', 'THE', 'GRINGO', 'plenty', 'let', 'face', 'nice', 'see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'sinking', 'fangs', 'dirty', 'role', 'again', 'Who', 'somehow', 'up', 'public', 'image', 'could', 'be', 'having', 'blockbusters', 'again', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'least', 'still', 'got', 'chops', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

This is, plain and simple, a tough guy film. But it has a lot of smarts to back up the brawn.Here's the scoop. Mel Gibson and a partner have pulled off a big heist but his partner gets shot and killed in the ensuing chase and Mel ends up in a bizarre Mexican prison. Corrupt Mexican cops steal the booty, a corrupt American official wants a cut of said take and the guys whose money he took want it back. This is a very sticky situation. He befriends a young kid and the kid's mom in the prison (like I said this is a bizarre place) and needs to do right by everyone including himself.That the opening scene here is nearly identical to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" pretty much  tells you what you're in for, and it delivers the goods big time. Mel's character has been around and is not easily intimidated. He keeps his eyes open to get the lay of the land and determine how best to profit from the situation. Yes he's a criminal that has done time, but he only does bad things to bad guys. The friendship he builds with the kid and the kid's mother is contrived but you like it all the same because you like them. The bad guys are all sweaty sleaze who need to get their collective butts kicked. You love seeing Mel play these guys. He knows them and their types and he knows what to do to pull them apart. He spews out great tough guy patter. This is very cleverly written with a lot of great lines, and, like all good scripts, there are a lot of surprises. Some are big, some are small but they come with great regularity. The end is way over the top. You can't believe it for a minute but it's directed really well.Gibson has had his trials and tribulations as of late, and isn't the draw he used to be, but he does as good a job here as I've ever seen him do. The film is directed well, cut well and all the production values are of high order. It has a cool soundtrack and is just overall a good time.

1547350,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0087DFIOU,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[14, 14]","Ah, how the mighty have fallen. Mel Gibson, once the world's highest-paid actor (after receiving an at-the-time-record-breaking $30 million payday for his role in THE PATRIOT) and beloved by millions, got drunk one night, said some bad things, was drowned in REALLY negative press (some very deservedly so), and he went from superstar to pariah in just a few weeks. And here, he's co-written his own (essentially) Direct to Video star vehicle called GET THE GRINGO, a return to form into the kind of role that made him famous: The Violent Rascal. This is the type of role he helped to create the archetype for in the LETHAL WEAPON series and that he brought to many other films as well. But his character here is a little edgier, a little darker, a little more clever if not as violent and incendiary as Martin Riggs.The film opens with a car chase through the desert along the American/Mexican border. Two police cars are chasing a car driven by a character only known as ""Driver"" (Gibson). Seeing no way out on this side of the border, he crashes through the fence onto the Mexican side of the border, but it's straight out of the frying pan and into the fire as the corrupt Mexican federales see bags loaded with millions of dollars in the car and they dump Driver, obviously a career criminal, in a prison referred to El Pueblito, which is NOT like the prisons you see in The U.S. of A; in The Driver's words, ""Is this a prison, or the crappiest mall on Earth?"". There are non-prisoners amongst the population, such as wifes and children and some are allowed to come and go. There are also small but lucrative businesses in the prison; drugs, guns, prostitution, but also little food stands and bodegas that sell cigarettes, candy, soda pop and beer. The Driver is a man constantly on the move and on the make. He makes the observations of a thief and of someone intimately familiar with the prison system and hierarchy and sees the easiest way to get at the goods. It is during one of these observations that he sees Javi (Daniel Gimenez Cacho), the kingpin of El Pueblito and also during one of his thefts that he finds an ally in a tough 10-year-old boy, simply called ""Kid"" (Kevin Hernandez) who lives in the prison with his equally-tough mother (Dolores Heredia, also simply credited ""Kid's Mom""), an inmate busted for drug trafficking some time before. Kid and Javi are on a collision course for reasons that I won't spoil here, but with Driver finding a friend in the kid and the mother, Driver has more personal reasons for staying.There are other fun sub-plots involving a corrupt U.S. Consulate official, the mobster Driver stole the money from, and various other shady individuals doing various shady things. The major cast is made up mostly of unknowns to American audiences and the performances by Kevin Hernandez and Cacho are pretty layered and exciting, but it is also populated with various other character actors, such as Dean Norris, Bob Gunton, Patrick Bauchau and Peter Stormare in very small roles. The director is Adrian Grunberg, a former assistant director making his feature directing debut. He's worked with Mel in the past on films like APOCALYPTO and EDGE OF DARKNESS, but his influence from others is more felt from his work on films like MAN ON FIRE, TRAFFIC and JARHEAD. Grunberg directs the film with some gusto and urgency, but make no mistake though: this is Mel's movie through and through. The character of Driver is very similar to his likable bad guy Porter in the original cut of 1998's PAYBACK (because the ""Final Cut"" released a few years back on DVD, his character is much darker). It's obvious that Mel's having a really good time making this film, and it's obvious that he co-wrote this (with director Grunberg and co-producer Stacy Perskie, a PA who worked with Grunberg on a few other films) to give himself a star vehicle that felt more like what we used to see him in, as opposed to the extremely dark EDGE OF DARKNESS or the heavier drama of THE BEAVER. All of the violent acts he commits have a cartoony action film feel to them and they're mostly committed with a glint in his eye, particularly a bravura sequence with two hand grenades and an umbrella.Despite what you may think about Mel Gibson personally, it hasn't diminished his capabilities as a consumate performer who does his best to engage the audience in his films. This film shows how much of a badass Mel can still be, but he's also gotten to a point where he's starting to wear his age well. I know (and I believe Mel knows as well) that he will never get back to where he was with star vehicles like GET THE GRINGO, but at least we can still get films where we get to see Mel kick some tail and have some fun with him along the way.3.5/5 Stars",4,"Cool, slick, wild and tailor-made for Gibson.",1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,4764,"['Ah', 'how', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen', 'Mel', 'Gibson',

1547356,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B0087DFIOU,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 1]","Get The Gringo follows The Gringo (Mel Gibson) as he escapes into Mexico after stealing a large amount of money from a crime boss; he ends up in a city-like prison in Mexico, where he meets and helps a young boy who is wanted for his rare blood type liver. The story is a bit deeper than that, but I don't want to spoil or prolong this review anymore.The story is great; it blends action, drama, and dark humor with excellence. The action is beautifully shot, the drama is well told, and the comedy doesn't feel forced. The movie is serious, but knows the right time to be fun; consequently, the film's pace is fast and balanced. Mel Gibson does an excellent job as The Gringo; he does a great and amusing Clint Eastwood impression in the movie, as well. The rest of the cast was also great. Tradition Mexican music is played often during the film, and I enjoyed it because it effectively complimented the settings, which was also very well used. The ending doesn't stray far from what we've seen before, but it's not bad; in fact, the final sequence in the prison is action-packed and suspenseful. Also, the film is in both English and Spanish (with subtitles), it's mostly English, though.Overall, Get The Gringo is an amazing action/drama/comedy film that effectively blends and balances all of these genres. As of 11/4/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also recommended.Get The Gringo has strong violence and gore.

1547357,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B0087DFIOU,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[2, 2]","I rented this movie several months ago because no matter what, in my opinion, Mel Gibson is a very talented, excellent actor, writer, and director. After an eight year absence, it was truly wonderful to see him make a comeback in this movie (which he also wrote). One thing this movie teaches us is that no matter how crazy a person gets in real life, if they've truly &#34;got it,&#34; it doesn't go away. The title tells you nothing, so you just have to go by the reviews on this one and it still consistently gets four stars because it is just that good. The storyline is a bit unbelievable, but that's not what makes this movie worth watching. What is worth watching is Mel Gibson doing what he does best - transforming himself into the character with perfect timing, touches of just the right amount of humor, and never straying or allowing the action to overwhelm the story or the characters involved in the story.Story run down: he ends up in a Mexican prison, this weird sort of shanty town city inside of prison walls filled with corruption, drugs, prostitutes, odd sorts of restaurants and housing from District 9. In the midst of all of this, he meets a 10 year old boy who he sort of takes under his wing. Actually, the boy teaches Mel, and in the end, Mel does what Mel does best. In his wonderful playfully mischievous way, reminiscent of his earlier films, he saves the day (sort of). This film is quite violent and the language is colorful, so it is not for the kids.But for those of us who remember Mel from Mad Max, the brilliant Lethal Weapons, Payback. Conspiracy Theory, Ransom and so many more, he is back! I'd really like him next to make a movie like We Were Soldiers, The Patriot and perhaps my favorite Mel Gibson movie ever - Braveheart, but I am just happy to see his brilliance shine through once again in Get the Gringo. I highly recommend this movie whether you are a fan of Mel Gibson or not. It is so much better than most of what Hollywood is offering these days.",4,Good Movie - Don't Let The Mel Issues Stop You From Watching This Wonderful Movie,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1997,"['rented', 'movie', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'very', 'talented', 'excellent', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'eight', 'year', 'absence', 'was', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'see', 'make', 'comeback', 'movie', 'also', 'wrote', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'person', 'real', 'life', ""'ve"", 'truly', '34', 'got', '34', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'title', 'nothing', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'reviews', 'one', 'still', 'consistently', 'four', 'stars', 'just', 'good', 'storyline', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'watching', 'What', 'worth', 'watching', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'transforming', 'character', 'perfect', 'timing', 'touches', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'never', 'straying', 'allowing', 'action', 'overwhelm', 'story', 'characters', 'involved', 'story.Story', 'run', 'down', 'up', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'weird', 'sort', 'shanty', 'town', 'city', 'prison', 'walls', 'filled', 'corruption', 'drugs', 'prostitutes', 'odd', 'sorts', 'restaurants', 'housing', 'District', '9', 'midst', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'sort', 'wing', 'Actually', 'boy', 'teaches', 'Mel', 'end', 'Mel', 'what', 'Mel', 'best', 'wonderful', 'playfully', 'mischievous', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'films', 'day', 'sort', 'film', 'quite', 'violent', 'language', 'colorful', 'not', 'kids.But', 'who', 'remember', 'Mel', 'Mad', 'Max', 'brilliant', 'Lethal', 'Weapons', 'Payback', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'Ransom', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'back', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'next', 'make', 'movie', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Patriot', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'ever', 'Braveheart', 'am', 'just', 'happy', 'see', 'brilliance', 'shine', 'once', 'again', 'Get', 'Gringo', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'offering', 'days']",N/A

1547360,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0087DFIOU,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","Mel Gibson has become the movie star folks love to kick around. First when he made PASSION OF THE CHRIST folks in Hollywood laughed at him...until the movie became a blockbuster. When he went through his public divorce he was ridiculed. Arrested on drunk driving charges and making anti-Semitic remarks? Screaming at an ex-girlfriend and mother of his youngest child? Yep he was guilty of all these things. And yet he continues to work and make movies. But we're a society more interested in the lifestyles of the rich and famous than their movies. Me? I could care less. I want to know if the movies he makes are good. GET THE GRINGO, his latest, is fantastic.Gibson stars as a bank robber on the run as the film opens. With a wounded partner and the border patrol on his tail, he heads for the Mexican border and jumps the fence there. When the Mexican border guards find the money in his back seat, they take custody of him. Carted off to jail without his money (that the guards have taken for themselves), Gibson is tossed into one of the worst jails of all times.The jail is a city unto itself. If guards exist here you never see them with the exception of the walls. Instead a crime boss named Javi controls everything in the prison from where you live to the drugs or guns you want. Living in his own mansion of sorts, he has family members run his business for him. As he navigates this prison, Gibson's character (never given a name) takes note of everything that goes on around him. He knows his only chance for survival is to make himself useful to Javi.Gibson also gets to know someone who can help him understand what's going on and help him on this path. The Kid (Kevin Hernandez) is a low level hustler who Javi always seems to protect. There is a reason for this that becomes apparent later on (I won't surprise you here). As Gibson finds his way in the prison, he takes the kid under his wing as well. The kid's mother (Delores Heredia) isn't pleased at first, but eventually she takes a liking the Gibson.While Gibson is making his way through this new territory the men he robbed to start the film off are looking for him. They track down the border cops and torture them to find out where he is. And with enough money behind them, the find their way into the prison armed to the teeth to take Gibson out. What follows is one bloody battle that you won't forget and the need for Gibson to make his move earlier than he intended to.There are several things that make this movie work, first and foremost Mel Gibson. As he's aged Gibson has a weathered look about him that suits the character in this movie. This is a man who has seen hard times and in so doing knows how to accomplish his goals no matter who he has to use to do so. His character is all about self preservation and nothing more. But as the film progresses we notice his character begin to open a bit and to find a certain fondness for the kid.The setting of the story plays a major role in the success of this film. You've never seen a prison like this before and hopefully never will in person. The core of the film was based on the true stories of prisons like this in Mexico, some of which have been closed down. How people survive here, how Gibson finds his way around and the interaction between characters in the prison adds to the film.The last thing that makes this film stand out is the script. Well written much of the story unfolds through the sarcastic narration of Gibson's character. His world weary ways present themselves as he begins with ""hello kids..."" telling his tale. I once read that many found this character to be much like the character of Porter from Gibson's film PAYBACK. It is very much like that character, a hard core criminal that for some reason you seem to like. This film could easily be a follow up to that film. It would make a great double feature anywhere.If you like Gibson you'll find this to be one of his better films. The range of emotion he displays through subtle looks and gestures makes this one of his best performances.

He was no doubt given this role in a Freudian hope to further damage his public persona.  Despite all the bad press and the mess he manages to make of his personal life from time to time (as most of Hollywood eventually does by the way) he takes the darkness of this movie and wraps it around himself as a blanket.  Behind the grit and sarcasm of his character he manages to show a heart down underneath it all as only Mel can do.
