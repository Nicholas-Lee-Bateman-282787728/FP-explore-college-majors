1595938,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B009EOMNSA,Amit Talpade,"[3, 3]","In my lifetime, there has been only a single actor who could fill movie theaters and drive audiences to hysteria and that was Amitabh in the 70's. Each of his releases were met with frenzy and box office success. Rajneekanth from the south, aslo creates the same excitement but I have heard not expereicned it. In recent years, Salman Khan creates rabid fans and rewrites box office collections with each subsequent film. his streak started with Wanted, and was followed by Dabanng, Ready, Bodyguard. As I write this Ek Tha Tiger has become the second highest grosser in the history of Indian Cinema.Ek Tha Tiger is about Tiger( Salman Khan), a spy for the RAW unit of Indian Itelligence. his boss gives him an assignment to trail an Indian scientst at the Trinity College in Dublin, who is also being pursued by the ISI for his work on Nuclear research. In Dublin, Tiger meets a music student who is a parttime housekeeper ( Katrina Kaif)at the professors house.He falls in love and Tiger turns in to a pussy cat.The film is engaging and has a engaging first half, however the pace slackens a bit when the leads fall in love. The action and the plot takes tiger all over the world from Iraq, Turkey, Dublin and Cuba and that makes the film fun to watch.The direction is adequate and so are the action scenes. Music is very,very mediocre.Salman Khan kicks major booty and Katrina and him share a lot of chemistry.I enjoyed the film ( not plot wise but for the the experience of watching it in a crowded movie theater whilst experiencing the Salman hysteria) but still fail to understand the unprecedented euphoria accompanying the film. As I exited the theater, I overheard a conversation between two men. Did you enjoy the film? said one of the men. The other man replied "" The movie was average but I just came to see my brother Salman and sister in law, Katrina"" That probably sums up his Salmans popularity in his legion of fans.. Four stars. 8/26/2012",4,Could be the highest grossing movie of all time?

1595942,AH6SP95KPHMRX,B009EOMNSA,eclectic,"[1, 3]","Ahh.. Ek  Tha  Tiger - the long awaited film for me after having enjoyed the CD very much before getting the movie. I wasn't totally, absolutely, out-of-this-world blown away after watching the movie even though Salman was up to expectation  doing his kick-ass cool bit with great screen presence as usual. Katrina was a pleasant surprise to me this time,finally getting to see her stretching some decent acting skills as I've written her off as a fluffy bit of cotton candy in her other movies! Movie started off great with Salman making quite an entrance but it went a bit dull as the story unfolds when they start falling in love.Kabir Khan could have made it more interesting and kick up the tempo along here,but instead it was a bit of a drag until the courting bit was out of the way and the pace went up a few notches when the action resumed. Chemistry between Salman and Katrina is undeniable and I have to remind myself that this is a romance story first and foremost, built around a background of espionage and subterfuge rather than the other way round. If you can get this bit around your head then sit back and enjoy the fantastic sceneries, great song numbers and the euphoria of watching Salman Khan in action. Does this Tiger really roar? It doesn't whimper either.",4,Ek Tha Tiger DVD,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1281,"['Ahh..', 'Ek', 'Tha', 'Tiger', 'long', 'awaited', 'film', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'CD', 'very', 'much', 'getting', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'absolutely', 'out-of-this-world', 'blown', 'away', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'Salman', 'was', 'up', 'expectation', 'doing', 'kick-ass', 'cool', 'bit', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'usual', 'Katrina', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'time', 'finally', 'getting', 'see', 'stretching', 'decent', 'acting', 'skills', ""'ve"", 'written', 'off', 'fluffy', 'bit', 'cotton', 'candy', 'other', 'movies', 'Movie', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'Salman', 'making', 'quite', 'entrance', 'went', 'bit', 'dull', 'story', 'unfolds', 'when', 'start', 'falling', 'love.Kabir', 'Khan', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'kick', 'up', 'tempo', 'here', 'instead', 'was', 'bit', 'drag', 'courting', 'bit', 'was', 'way', 'pace', 'went', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'when', 'action', 'resumed', 'Chemistry', 'Salman', 'Katrina', 'undeniable', 'have', 'remind', 'romance', 'story', 'first', 'foremost', 'built', 'background', 'espionage', 'subterfuge', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'round', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'head', 'then', 'back', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'sceneries', 'great', 'song', 'numbers', 'euphoria', 'watching', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'action', 'Tiger', 'really', 'roar', ""n't"", 'whimper', 'either']",Ek Tha Tiger

Salman Khan plays the hero.  Katrina Kaif plays the object of the hero's love.  There is a little singing and dancing, but this is not your typical Bollywood movie.The movie really is action packed.  There are several fight scenes.  It takes about half the movie for the two main characters to fall in love.

1595948,A1PPAEHY7VZ4LB,B009EOMNSA,"Kawa Jaan ""THE GAMER""","[2, 6]","From the fact that this movie has done very well at the box office and has had some positive reviews, I feel truly sad for Indian film audiences in that they lack better entertainment options.I have been very disappointed by the latest batch of ""Bollywood"" movies, but as soon as I saw this movie being available on Netflix, I made myself watch it since I liked what I had seen from the promos and the songs of ""Ek Tha Tiger."" However, as I found out, those were just great marketing ploys and that the movie is nowhere near as good as it's hyped up to be.The plot has more holes than a rat-infested old house, and the acting and direction are sub-par, at best. An example of the holes in the plot is the romance that develops between the main characters. Tiger meets Zoya, they have some awkward conversations about his age and his not-so-funny jokes, he is shy to ask her out (he's very shy around her despite being a world-class spy?), and after just one date, they both declare that they are very much in love with each other. The characters don't develop and they don't get to know each other, but we are forced to just accept the fact that these two individuals are madly in love and they will go as far as dying and betraying their countries for each other. Despite being a real-life couple, I didn't sense any chemistry between Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaif. Either that chemistry doesn't really exist, or that this film just failed to capture and portray it!There are more examples of the holey plot points, but as I said, I wouldn't want to waste my time mentioning all of them here. I would just like to end my review with this: If you heard the songs and liked what you heard, you would be right in that the music IS good in this movie. Also, the camera-work is good and I liked the use of different settings and locations. But overall, this is one movie that should have been better written and better directed because all the great music and beautiful locations don't make for a great movie. They might make for good, enjoyable (brief) scenes, but not a whole good movie. Good writing, acting and directing are needed to produce a truly good film and this film, unfortunately, is not one.",2,Ek Tha Time-Waster!,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2194,"['fact', 'movie', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'positive', 'reviews', 'feel', 'truly', 'sad', 'Indian', 'film', 'audiences', 'lack', 'better', 'entertainment', 'options.I', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'latest', 'batch', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'movie', 'being', 'available', 'Netflix', 'made', 'watch', 'liked', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'promos', 'songs', 'Ek', 'Tha', 'Tiger', 'However', 'found', 'out', 'were', 'just', 'great', 'marketing', 'ploys', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'hyped', 'up', 'be.The', 'plot', 'more', 'holes', 'rat-infested', 'old', 'house', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'sub-par', 'best', 'example', 'holes', 'plot', 'romance', 'main', 'characters', 'Tiger', 'Zoya', 'have', 'awkward', 'conversations', 'age', 'not-so-funny', 'jokes', 'shy', 'ask', 'out', 'very', 'shy', 'being', 'world-class', 'spy', 'just', 'one', 'date', 'declare', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'forced', 'just', 'accept', 'fact', 'two', 'individuals', 'are', 'madly', 'love', 'will', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'dying', 'betraying', 'countries', 'other', 'being', 'real-life', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'sense', 'chemistry', 'Mr.', 'Khan', 'Ms.', 'Kaif', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'film', 'just', 'failed', 'capture', 'portray', 'are', 'more', 'examples', 'holey', 'plot', 'points', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'mentioning', 'here', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'end', 'review', 'heard', 'songs', 'liked', 'what', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'music', 'good', 'movie', 'Also', 'camera-work', 'good', 'liked', 'use', 'different', 'settings', 'locations', 'overall', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'written', 'better', 'directed', 'great', 'music', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'might', 'make', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'brief', 'scenes', 'not', 'whole', 'good', 'movie', 'Good', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'needed', 'produce', 'truly', 'good', 'film', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'one']",Ek Tha Tiger

Zoya warns him not to fall in love with her, though, of course, he does. By the time Tiger learns the reason, he and Zoya find themselves trapped in a web of international espionage.Well, in fact, ""Ek Tha Tiger"" is a mindless romantic action movie where, like ""The Tourist"" starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, both romance and action try to amaze us, but somehow fail. The beautiful cinematography provides us with an attractive backdrop for the story to unfold, but unfortunately they forgot to provide an interesting story.The stars are not to be blamed for the slack pace. They both did s great job here. Action scenes (clearly inspired by one recent James Bond film) are decent, but not very special. I'm fine with the obvious use of body doubles, but when action sequences (that are few and far in between) lack creativity and imagination, the film really disappoints.""Ek Tha Tiger"" is an OK action romance with nice photography.
