1109058,A1L9JLD1DS97L8,B000WFW12S,"A. Cox ""Look""","[3, 3]","This show was quite a bit of fun to watch. The plots were great with a love triangle running through the show made it interesting. The triangle is Mick, Beth and the problem of Mick's being a vampire and Beth being human.  Alex O'Louglin as Mick was the most interesting man to hit any screen in a long time with just the right amount of sex appeal. The rest of the cast (Jason Dohring Sophia Myles) were great and blended to make this really a hit.  CBS really made a mistake when they didn't continue this for another season and heads should have rolled at CBS for that decision. I think MOONLIGHT should be given another chance with cast intact. It is more fun and interesting to watch than TWILIGHT OR TRUE BLOOD or ANGEL.  It has CSI theme, Law & Order progression, AND romance of true love.  It's  great DVD to own and watch over and over.  I rate it a 10 or 5 stars.  CBS really messed up on this show. The whole family can see this show.

To replace it with ""****"" like True Blood, for example?Some of the show elements have been used before. Some are a bit ...cheesy? Like the eyes that go white and the wide open fanged mouth - that has been the downfall of a - not otherwise bad - Canadian show Foreever Knight. Next time somebody does a vampire show, why don't they try to make ""killing frenzy eyes"" go smth like luminous emerald green? Like cats' eyes - that would be smth novel and also attract a huge audience of cat lovers... Just kidding here.In fact that is the best vampire show right now. The cancelled one. It is smart, it got some really nice humor in it. Plot lines are not stupid - they are not always brilliant but when was the last time you tried a vampire show or a book for the literary and logical brilliance of it? There is a good chemistry between the heroes and even if Mick is not always convincing in his hatred for his v-nature, the plot and dialogue lines are never trashy and always stay whithin the logic of the world created.So the recommendation is - if you like a good vampire show, not a trashy adolescent soft porn, buy this one. There is some good acting as an additional bonus - who would expect it from a vampire show?I have a friend who has a hilarous and very true expression for all good movies - those that were not created counting on an army of school free teens as the target audience - he calls them ""adult movies"".

Well, I'm not old enough, but I have seen many seasons of Forever Knight (thanks to Netflix).  It's hard to see how anyone could prefer it except for nostalgia.  Yes, Forever Knight and Moonlight has many of the same storylines, so this is definitely a remake of sorts.  However, writing is only part of it.  The other big part, especially in a show like this, is how the actors connect with their characters, and  Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles definitely bring it to the table.  The main actors on the show have gone on to be much better at their craft than we see them here (for example, Jason Dohring has always been a presence on screen, but his acting was not at his best here), but the combination of them here was just magic somehow.This is a vampire show, and it doesn't shy from that - Mick and Josef drink blood as we might drink water, and Josef drinks straight from the source, as it were.  However, it does have a slick, urban detective edge that makes it more appealing for those in the audience who might not go for a heavy paranormal bent (a la Angel).  There's a lot here for an audience to gravitate toward.  On the surface, we have a crime drama - Mick is a detective, after all.  There's also the romance between Mick and Beth, a romance many years in the making, as well as Josef's star-crossed tragedy.  The big interests, though, are the characters of Josef and Mick - they have so much history, and the few glimpses we got are very intriguing, especially where Josef was concerned.Overall, this was and is a truly great show with great potential to be something special.  Unfortunately, between this having not been around long enough to garner a loyal audience and the Writers' Strike, there was never a second season, and the TV landscape is definitely poorer for it, especially with all of the newly minted paranormal shows being geared toward the younger audiences, leaving those of us who have graduated from YA fiction looking for something with a little bit more edge and finding nothing.But that's the story of Moonlight.  By this point, chances are good that if you're looking at this DVD set, you've seen the show and you want to know what the extras are.  Unfortunately, there's nothing here for you.  There are no extras at all.  Nothing.  The 4-DVD set, as of this date, contains the 16 episodes and nothing more.  I'm not certain why considering that, at the time, surely they could have gotten at least one of the main actors to do an interview or something.  Anything.  However, the choice was made, but at least lovers of this show got a DVD set.

But, Moonlight is a great sci-fi/supernatural show that builds upon itself and was very worthy of second season.The first episodes are slow. I will be honest. But, once the characters and plot are established, things take off. You've got a bit of everything in each episode: action, plot development, romance, and comedy. A good episode in the first half of the show is ""Fever."" It lets the actors shine early on, and show that they can play these characters believably. Then, there is a crescendo in the series (in my opinion) at episode 11, ""Love Lasts Forever,"" where we really get to see some major character development. This episode also showed the audience that the writers were not afraid to kill off someone. That is something newer shows are afraid of doing once an actor gets big. Another amazing episode is ""What's Left Behind."" Again, you are given a slice of why this show is so enduring to the fans. The writers since of character and plot development permeate in this episode. You feel for the characters, and by the end of the episode can feel yourself rooting for the best possible thing to happen. Finally, the last episode of the series is the most heartwarming and bittersweet. After a long season of watching our characters, we get a resolution and a cliffhanger all in one. The way it ends will leave you screaming. There is no more, and will not be (unless you take a dive into fanfiction).Overall: The show gets off to a slow start. The characters all seem to be fumbling around: looking for motivation and trying to get into each others lives without much success. In the first few episodes, the production value is a bit shabby. You will find yourself cringing at the substandard fight scenes, the shaky camera angles, and the blurred city landscapes. But, as the show progresses, everyone seems to find their place in the vampire world of the series. The episodes, as stated, begin to build on themselves. And, as you start to see the characters back stories unravel, the drama and romance begins to deliver something special and sweet to the audience. The best thing about this show is that they writers knew how to unveil a storyline, they knew how to develop plot. And, for those of you who are immersed in the impatient way shows are shot now, you will be turned off. This show never got the attention it deserved. To fans of the series, this is disheartening as we sit back and watch subpar shows like ""The Vampire Diaries"" take off. A hint of advice: If you like the current vampire genre, take time to watch this show.

After turning to Amazon and finally viewing this show, I can see why Moonlight doesn't stay on the retailer shelf.  Instead of viewing vampires as all-powerful beings of the night, Moonlight recasts vampires as ultimately flawed creatures full of passion, regret, and lust. . . for blood.Using an excellent main lead Alex O'Loughlin as the private investigator/vampire Mick St. John, the show explores the lives of vampires in the hip and stylish city of Los Angeles.  These creatures lead ordinary public lives, and there is a code of conduct that is followed to ensure the secrecy of vampires ""living"" among humans.  The 16 episode series follow Mick St. John as he navigates from one mystery case to the next, and resolving issues in his own life as a human and as a vampire.The female lead Sophia Myles plays an online tabloid reporter named Beth Turner, who has a painful but forgotten past with Mick.  Part of the show follows her struggles to find out the truth buried deep in forgotten memories.  Sophia bares a strong resemblance to a young, Oscar Award winner Kate Winslet.  And the writers behind Moonlight uses her character to help explain characteristics of vampires in the show, their habits, lifestyles, weaknesses, etc.The show lasts an unusually short 16 episodes due to the Writers Guild strike, and leaves you wanting more.

When the episode run down for Moonlight was first floated, people said, ""Yes, but 'Angel' and 'Forever Knight'?  This has already been done.""  Not quite.  Moonlight started slow (I admit after the first episode I told people the show would never make it), but once it found the groove, it caught on fast.  Mick St. John (Alex O'Loughlin) is a vampire PI, but without as much angst as Angel or Nick Knight...Mick has a grasp of his situation and even a black sense of humor about it.  His best friend and much older vampire Josef, played to the hilt by Jason Dohring, loves being what he is with all it has to offer.  Josef has some of the best, snarkiest dialog in the show; he and Mick play off each other wonderfully.  Beth Turner (Sophia Myles), the woman Mick has watched from afar for years and finally enters fully into her life, is at first a slight amusement/annoyance, then a close friend, then something more...things get complicated in LA when tabloid journalist Beth taps handsome PI Mick to help her with her stories (or she interjects herself in his cases) and they become closer and closer, bringing them both under fire from both the mortal and the immortal world.  There are several other things that come into play along the way...like Mick's supposedly dead ex-wife and sire, the beautiful vampire Coraline, and the things she brings into his life.If you start watching Moonlight, you won't be able to stop.

I am not one given to expounding the virtues of ANY show but, as soon as I got episode one under my belt, I was hooked. ""Moonlight"" has something for just about everyone; drama abounds, forbidden love hovers just out of reach, morphing from human to vamp lurks - just waiting to be unleashed, and the action is meted out in just the right doses.While the 'vampire detective' theme, along with many other vampire concepts, has been done before, none have been done with such a twist as this. ""Moonlight"" has taken the vampire theme to another level in its story line by resetting the vamp rules .. stake in the heart only paralyzes them, they can tolerate sunlight for a short time, they don't sleep in coffins - they sleep in freezers, holy water doesn't turn them into a sputtering heap of ash. At the beginning of episode one, our hero Mick StJohn does a similated 'interview with a vampire' that gives a basic explanation of the premise of this show's basic vamp do's and don't's which 'sets the stage' quite nicely.Beyond that, the charisma of the main characters, Alex O'Loughlin, Sophia Myles and Jason Dohring, gives the show an appeal that is unmatched anywhwere. The chemestry between Alex and Sophia on screen is beautiful to watch and keeps one wanting more and more. The lighting, sets, special effects and music are exceptional. All of these elements bring together a mesmerizing saga that keeps one glued to the television for every minute of each episode and leaves one wanting the next episode NOW!Many have tried to compare ""Moonlight"" to other vamp shows, but there IS no comparison. This one is unique in its concept and delivery, and should be viewed with an open mind, leaving behind the old concepts to embrace this new and exciting way of seeing, hearing and feeling the New Vamp In Town.",5,BUYERS BEWARE - THIS SHOW IS ADDICTIVE!,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1898,"['tv', 'series', 'Moonlight', 'doubt', 'most', 'addictive', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'given', 'expounding', 'virtues', 'ANY', 'show', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'episode', 'one', 'belt', 'was', 'hooked', 'Moonlight', 'something', 'just', 'everyone', 'drama', 'forbidden', 'love', 'hovers', 'just', 'reach', 'morphing', 'human', 'vamp', 'lurks', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'unleashed', 'action', 'meted', 'out', 'just', 'right', ""'vampire"", 'detective', 'theme', 'many', 'other', 'vampire', 'concepts', 'been', 'done', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'twist', 'Moonlight', 'taken', 'vampire', 'theme', 'level', 'story', 'line', 'resetting', 'vamp', 'rules', '..', 'stake', 'heart', 'only', 'can', 'tolerate', 'sunlight', 'short', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'coffins', 'sleep', 'freezers', 'holy', 'water', ""n't"", 'turn', 'sputtering', 'heap', 'ash', 'beginning', 'episode', 'one', 'hero', 'Mick', 'StJohn', 'similated', ""'interview"", 'vampire', 'basic', 'explanation', 'premise', 'show', 'basic', 'vamp', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'stage', 'quite', 'nicely.Beyond', 'charisma', 'main', 'characters', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'show', 'appeal', 'unmatched', 'anywhwere', 'chemestry', 'Alex', 'Sophia', 'screen', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'keeps', 'one', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'lighting', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'exceptional', 'elements', 'bring', 'together', 'mesmerizing', 'saga', 'one', 'glued', 'television', 'minute', 'episode', 'one', 'wanting', 'next', 'episode', 'NOW', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'compare', 'Moonlight', 'other', 'vamp', 'shows', 'comparison', 'one', 'unique', 'concept', 'delivery', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'open', 'mind', 'leaving', 'old', 'concepts', 'embrace', 'new', 'exciting', 'way', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'feeling', 'New', 'Vamp', 'Town']",N/A

Beth does not remember this for a while in the series given the trauma involved.Coralene is Mick's now ex-wife and appears in several episodes.

Pretty interesting plots for the most part.I thought the dialogue a bit unbelievable at times.

1109119,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000WFW12S,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 5]","""Moonlight"" begins with a laid-back vampire PI being interviewed in his mind: ""I don't hunt innocents. But there's predators out there that need to be dealt with.""It's a quirky reversal of Anne Rice tradition, and it sets the tone for a very unique blend of vampire tale and urban mystery -- and sadly it ended too soon. Especially since Alex O'Loughlin is an absolutely inspired vampire detective, and the quick direction, good CGI and snappy writing save this from being another cheesy vampire story.Mick St. John (O'Laughlin) is a vampire detective in L.A. -- where there has recently been a vampiresque murder of a college student. But though the student was obsessed with vampires, Mick soon realizes that she wasn't murdered by one. And with the assistance of Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) -- who insists he looks familiar -- Mick uncovers a weird little vampire-obsessed cabal at Hearst college, and a professor whose infatuation with undeath goes beyond mere fanaticism.And there are plenty of other nasty cases -- an ex-con gunning for the vampire detective, a forced stay in the desert, ""Black Crystal,"" a feral newbie vampire, a hooker-killing teenage vampire, a supposedly-dead cult killer, a killer gang going after Beth's boyfriend, a Hollywood starlet, an attempt to kill Mick's mentor, and a vampire who threatens to ""out"" every single vampire in L.A.But no vampire story is complete without the nasty pasts and romantic tension -- Beth discovers Mick's true nature, and finds herself drawn to him until she's hit by a terrible personal tragedy. And Mick is confronted by a woman who looks suspiciously like Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) -- his dead ex-wife, and the woman who made him a vampire.Most vampire stories, whether on TV or in movies, are so abysmally cheesy that you could slice them up and serve them with wine and crackers. Fortunately ""Moonlight"" is more subtle -- not a lot of vampiric superpowers (beyond enhanced senses and healing), fangs and glowing eyes. The writers even poke fun at some of the old cliches (""Garlic... is good on pizza"").The weakest part of ""Moonlight"" is the crimes themselves -- most are fairly ordinary murder mysteries. But the series does succeed in balancing out the vampire stuff with the private eye plots. Quick swooping camerawork, fast-moving plots, some nice nasty action. And these vampires are done with tongue in cheek, whether it's their un-cliche living conditions (sleek minimalist apartments and mansions) or their easy use of modern technology (""If I hadn't become a vampire I would have missed out on the Internet, TIVO, World of Warcraft and GPS"").That slightly offbeat style is helped by the dialogue (""Can you fly?"" ""Just like Superman."" "" Really?"" ""No.... it would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?""). For the record, the best lines are all from Josef (""Well, the blood lust can be pretty heavy when you're first turned. And you could really lose it. I know I did. Damn, those were good times!"").Alex O'Loughlin is excellent as a vampire PI haunted by his past and his vampiric nature (""monsters don't get happily ever after""), but handling it with a wry sense of humor, brains, and enhanced senses. Myles is pretty decent as the pretty reporter who begins to wonder if a human and a vampire can find love, and Sossamon is brilliant as the mysterious Coraline. And Jason Dohring absolutely steals the show as the witty, happily amoral Josef (""She's delicious. '82 was a good year""), who nevertheless has his own sad past.""Moonlight"" manages to avoid the cheeze factor, and this all-too-brief series succeeds in being a unique blend of vampire love story and murder mystery.

It's Mick's intriguing bond with his vamp friend Josef, well played by Jason Dohring. Then there is the blue-eyed, fanged growl that sends me to the moon.  The action scenes with vamp flying and quicker than sight movement leave me wanting more. Mick's love for Beth (Sophia Myles)is more than any woman could ask for.  That he loved Coraline so deeply that his broken heart is still mending is a testament to the true male spirit. These are characters that continually suprise me.

I thought the romance angle with these two really worked.  As Mick and Beth are starting to get comfortable, he meets a woman named, Morgan (Shannyn Sossamon), who is a doppelganger for his dead vampire ex-wife, Coraline. If Morgan has secrets, she is not revealing, and Mick becomes obsessed with learning the truth.  Needless to say, this causes some problems with his relationship with Beth.That's all I'll say - watch to see how it resolves!

I hate most vampire stories (especially Vampire/Detective stories), the trailers for this show sucked and had displayed some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard.....thankfully the show is not at all reflective of the hype.What first caught me off-guard is the maturity of the characters. The vampires are NOT weepy, melodramatic goth-types (ala Buffy, True Blood etc....). In fact the main character, dispite a somewhat tragic past is almost zen-like (and hard-boiled) in his approach to different situations. The female lead is a human and there is a love-story between these two, but again it's believeable and never weepy or too sappy. The actors (all of them) do a very compitant job of bringing their characters to life.The special effects are also suprisingly impressive. The vampires grow fangs, float, run-fast etc without looking silly.If there's one thing off-putting about the show, it's the dialogue. Some people might be turned away at some of the silly things the characters say (you'll NEVER hear anyone in real-life saying things like this). Thankfully the actors do a great job in their delivery that it makes these scenes bareable.So, even if you're like me and not a vampire fan this show is well worth a look (especially at Amazon's low-price).

The programs greatly benefit from the lack of commercial interruption.Second, despite decent ratings success and an established fan base, this series was cancelled by CBS after the first season. IMO, this was a stupid decision, but it was surprising to me that a series of this quality would appear on one of the ""commercial networks.""The season begins with an interesting and compelling premise. We have a mysterious and compelling main charachter, Mick St. John, who is a member of an underground vampire community in Los Angeles who functions as a private investigator and wants to overcome his vampire nature, and who would love to be turned mortal again (those of you noting plot similarities to the old ""Forever Knight"" get honorary fangs). He was turned into a vampire in the 1950s by his wife, against his will. Although he loved her, he kills Coraline after she kidnaps a four years old girl . . . whether for food or in some attempt to create a family is unclear.The young girl has grown up to become an ""investigative reporter"" for an internet ""zine"" named Beth Turner. In the process of saving the now adult Beth, Mick's true nature is discovered by Beth. She is not repelled, but becomes a friend, and over the course of several episodes, realizes Mick saved her as a child, and has always been the ""protector"" she sensed in the background. While the early episodes are interrupted by nagging flashbacks to aspects of the back story, overall the series had great production values, good acting and directing, and compelling characters. Mick's character gradually moves from believing that human-vampire relations are unworkable to falling in love with Beth. After the murder of her D.A.-boyfriend, those feelings are admitted by Beth. Coraline (Mick's ex-wfe whom he believes he had killed when saving Beth as a four years old, makes a fascinating return to the series, and convincingly portrays the ambiguity of whether she is there for revenge or to make amends. The final episodes explore the deepening relationships of Mick to Beth and his vampire friends and also his past with an increasingly self-assured writing and directing. A new plot twist is introduced that someone knows about the vampire clique and wants to expose them. The replacement for Beth's dead boyfriend wants to exploit his capacity as D. A. in furtherance of the plot, which is excellently set up for the following season that never was filmed.My only criticism of the production is that in each episodes, there are lengthy periods of gratuitous helicopter shots, night and day, of Los Angeles. The writers did a good job of avoiding the episodal formula that seems to plague so many programs today, so each episode stands up pretty well on its on, despite having interconnected threads to preceding episodes.Overall, the series is very entertaining and dramatically satisfying. The actors progress in the interpretation of their increasingly complex characters, and the season's finale is very satisfying in its own right.

The sun doesn't make them burst into flames (or make their skin ""sparkle like diamonds""), but it does hurt them and drain them over time and will eventually kill them like a human would die of hypothermia.  They don't sleep in coffins, they sleep in freezer like contraptions.  But these are changes I like.  It makes the vampire more relatable, more human-like.

I am a big fan of the Vampire genre, pretty much anything Vampire including the old time Vampire movies from the 1930's, and 40's staring Bella Lugosi, and also from the 60's and early 70's starring Christopher Lee (one of the greatest actor's of all time).  What drew me to Moonlight was the fact that Sophia Myles from the Underworld movies was in the series.  Sophia Myles is one of the most beautiful women on this planet, PERIOD.  And she was incredibly beautiful in Underworld.  Moonlight is a very good series and has some very interesting plots in each of the episodes and the series is generally entertaining and very watchable.  I would watch an episode or two and then take a break and come back to the series a few days later rather than trying to watch the entire series in one day.  Overall, for the $13 I paid for the DVD set, it was WELL worth it.  For the price of one DVD, I think anyone would enjoy this series, even more so by people who enjoy the Vampire genre.  You just can't go wrong with purchasing this series.  It's a shame that this series did not continue on into more seasons, they really had a good television series here.  I'm just not sure why this show did not make it.  Maybe it was the fact it was not shown on of the the ""big three"" networks or FOX or WPN?  I can't say enough good things about this show.  It's stars are good actors and the series is definitely worth every penny of the low low price that it sells for on Amazon or other sites or stores.  BUY IT, you won't be disappointed, I assure you.  In fact, BRING THIS SHOW BACK!  Rehire the original stars of the show and put it on a big network, and I would assure you, this show would be a HIT, especially with all the Vampire hype of the modern day.  If I had to compare this show to others, it would be similar to ""Nick Night"" played by Rick Springfield many years ago or ""Forever Knight"" which too was a great series.",4,"Moonlight is a fantastic series, especially for fans of the Vampire genre",1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2013,"['took', 'year', 'buy', 'series', 'was', 'Amazon', 'wish', 'list', 'long', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Vampire', 'genre', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'Vampire', 'including', 'old', 'time', 'Vampire', 'movies', '1930', '40', 'staring', 'Bella', 'Lugosi', 'also', '60', 'early', '70', 'starring', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'one', 'greatest', 'actor', 'time', 'What', 'drew', 'Moonlight', 'was', 'fact', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Underworld', 'movies', 'was', 'series', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'planet', 'PERIOD', 'was', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Underworld', 'Moonlight', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'very', 'interesting', 'plots', 'episodes', 'series', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'very', 'watchable', 'would', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'then', 'take', 'break', 'come', 'back', 'series', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'rather', 'trying', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'day', 'Overall', '13', 'paid', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'WELL', 'worth', 'price', 'one', 'DVD', 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Vampire', 'genre', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'purchasing', 'series', 'shame', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'more', 'seasons', 'really', 'had', 'good', 'television', 'series', 'here', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'big', 'three', 'networks', 'FOX', 'WPN', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'stars', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'penny', 'low', 'low', 'price', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sites', 'stores', 'BUY', 'IT', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'assure', 'fact', 'BRING', 'THIS', 'SHOW', 'BACK', 'Rehire', 'original', 'stars', 'show', 'put', 'big', 'network', 'would', 'assure', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'HIT', 'especially', 'Vampire', 'hype', 'modern', 'day', 'had', 'compare', 'show', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'Nick', 'Night', 'played', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'series']",N/A

Hayes ""bibliophile""","[3, 4]","""When darkness falls, a hero will rise . . .""Mick St. John (Alex O'Loughlin) is a private investigator in a town where there is little that surprises anyone - Los Angeles, California.  But Mick has a secret that might surprise a few people - he's a vampire.  Welcome to his world.The death of a college co-ed brings BuzzWire internet reporter Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) into Mick's life - she's traipsing barefoot through a freezing fountain at 2 am in order to get a photo of the corpse.  And on that corpse are what appear to be two bite marks.  It seems to be the work of a vampire, assuming one believes in them.  Mick's and Beth's paths keep crossing, as each tries to solve this mystery, for different reasons - what more logical than that they work together?  Despite the fact that Mick tells her that he works alone.  Why does Mick look familiar to Beth?  She swears that she has seen him before.It seems that Mick has a connection with Beth which goes back some 22 years, to the kidnapping of a 4 year old child.  He protected her then from the very monster who was responsible for his being what he is - his ex wife Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) -  and he's protecting her now.  He has a mentor named Josef (Jason Dohring), a 400 year old vampire who is a real wiz at business, although his people skills leave something to be desired, and Mick has a connection who works in the morgue, Guillermo (Jacob Vargas), one that supplies him with donated Red Cross blood.  You see, Mick has principles, and one of them is that he will not drink human blood, voluntarily given or otherwise, directly from the source, and he will not kill humans, unless he has to.The one season series revolves around Mick and Beth and their developing relationship.  She struggles to remember where she knows him from, and when she thinks she recognizes him from the time of her abduction, he leads her off on other tangents.  She has a relationship with a young man named Josh, who works in the DA's office. They've been together for a while.  And yet it's obvious that she feels something for Mick, something that she cannot deny.  And he would do anything for her.Due to unexpected circumstances, Beth learns Mick's secret, and promises to keep it.  The fact that she trusts him, and he trusts her with his secret,  only serves to deepen their relationship.  As the series progresses, this relationship sometimes puts her at odds with her assistant district attorney boyfriend, Josh, but she refuses to give up on Mick or their friendship, as they battle a crazed killer, a rogue vampire, a vicious ex and more.  Tragedy nearly engulfs them -  will what they have withstand it?Commentary:I was smitten with Moonlight from the first episode.  With Mick, with him and Beth, and with their love story, not to mention with the entire series.  Mick St. John is an anti-vampire vampire.  He refuses to kill for the sake of killing, he is swift to protect humans and vamps alike. He does his job as a private investigator and he does it well - watching him follow the scent at any given crime scene is amazing, not to mention he moves with an elegant grace all his own - but he also holds himself aloof, away from most others, except for Josef.  Mick is a very multi-layered character, and he has an intriguing story, not the least of which is his relationship with Beth Turner, whom he first rescued as a small child from a crazed kidnaper, whom we learn was his ex, Coraline.  He watched her grow over the next 22 years, and protected her, and when he came face to face with her, he fell deeply in love, although he tries desperately to hide that fact.  Beth is a bright, lovely ambitious young woman with a nose for news and a high sense of morality.  Their mutual attraction is inevitable.Josef is a great foil for Mick - he is several times Mick's age, he's been around quite a bit, and he's very wealthy, but he does have something of an attitude problem.  As Mick reminds him when he says, ""I'm the only friend you have that doesn't like you for your money,"" to which Josef replies, ""Oh yeah.""  One of my favorite episodes actually centers around Josef, combining a threat on his life with a trip into his past, for a very character revealing story, showing a more compassionate side of the cynical vampire.Mick's relationship with the morgue attendant, Guillermo, has definite moments of humor, as Guillermo not only supplies Mick with the blood he needs to survive, from the donor supply, but also gives him access to the bodies in the morgue, which becomes very helpful in the course of his investigations.  Beth has the same relationship with him, and she and Mick meet a few times that way, by chance.  During a brief respite in Mick's vampire status, Guillermo complains that he has no one to sell Mick's preferred blood to, since he isn't consuming any - and the compassionate Mick helps him out of his bind.The situation in the desert which marked the watershed of their relationship occurs in the desert, where Mick almost dies and Beth must take drastic measures to keep that from happening (naturally the desert is anathema to a vampire)  A tragedy in Beth's life forces her to reevaluate her priorities and she takes a step back from Mick, blaming him not for what happened but not doing what she felt he could do about it, but of course it doesn't last.  A person from Mick's past is also a threat to their happiness.  Another one of my favorite lines is when Josef explains to Beth that in another life, Coraline was a courtesan, and Beth exclaims, ""Oh, a hooker!""The writing is very good, and the acting is wonderful, it's an excellent cast. Although before the series began, when it was still in the talk stage, Bruce Willis had been considered for the lead.  What a different show that would have been.  I like Bruce and all, but he does not have the same sexy presence that Alex O'Loughlin does, not by a long shot.Over the course of the series, the writers developed their own vampire mythology, which was pretty unique as such things go.  Their vamps walked in daylight, but it weakened them.  Fire and silver were their enemies.  Silver is generally reserved for those of the lycan persuasion - or werewolves. Fire - well, that makes sense, goes along with the whole weakened by the sun thing and heat in general.  Garlic, holy water and crucifixes are no more powerful against vamps than humans.  Mick does not sleep in a coffin, but in a large freezer.  In the very first episode, Mick is speaking with a reporter, as if he is being interviewed, as we are introduced to him, and he actually lays all of the myths to rest in this unique and candid interview.It's a shame that there are only 16 episodes of this wonderful series, it had many places yet to go, but its death can be attributed to the writer's strike that year.  It wasn't the only casualty.  Hope remained that there would eventually be a revival of the series, but I think those are long extinguished, as Alex O'Loughlin is busy with his new series, Hawaii 5-0, on CBS, and doing well.  But at least we have these 16 episodes to remember it by, and even if the 16th wasn't meant to be a last one, it possesses its own form of closure, as we bid Mick and Beth a fond farewell.",5,"An

1109164,A1ZPB7M2DLKJAL,B000WFW12S,La Coccinelle,"[4, 4]","I decided to watch the entire Moonlight series recently, since the summer season has a dearth of decent programming.  I'd caught most of the episodes during the series' original run, but there were a few that I'd missed.  It was great to watch them all in quick succession, seeing the story unfold.Moonlight was not entirely original, nor was it exceptionally well-written or critically acclaimed.  It is, however, a lot of fun.  The stories held my interest, and the slowly developing relationship between Mick (the vampire) and Beth (the human) was sweet.I think what made Moonlight work as well as it did was the main character.  Mick St. John is a lot more interesting than a certain sparkly vampire who seems to be the immortal du jour.  Instead of being a ""professional student"", Mick has actually decided to do something with his eternity, becoming a private investigator.  And while he hates being a vampire, we don't see the sort of emo self-hatred exhibited by that aforementioned immortal.  He gets on with his life, accepting (for the time being) that he can't help what he is, and that he must make the best of it.  Luckily for him, Beth isn't nearly as needy or demanding as that other heroine.  She isn't interested in becoming a vampire, and she's a strong character in her own right.  She has a career and a social life (that often gets put on the back burner thanks to her career, but at least it's there).  Watching the relationship between these two develop (especially after knowing about their shared history) was interesting.  I just wish it had been allowed to go further.And that's the main problem with the whole series: it just wasn't long enough.  Thankfully, the first season ended without too much of a cliffhanger; there were some unanswered questions, but it wasn't a thoroughly frustrating ending that left you dangling (and wanting to hurl your shoe at the TV when you realized you'd never get any sort of resolution).  It's disappointing that this series was cancelled, since it looked like it was going in an interesting direction.

They have normal lifestyles-including careers, relationships, lost, and money.  One character, Josef (played brilliantly by Jason Dohring) is a wealthy business man who is well known as a philanthropist and one with power.  These vampires within this community are different only because they didn't eat food, sleep in a bed, or stay outside (though they can be exposed to sunlight with limit).  One vampire introduced in one episode was a college cheerleader.  She put it this way, ""Nobody guestions my sleeping all day and guys are too drunk to realize the hickeys on their necks are alittle different"".The main character, Mick St. John, is a private investigator who happens to be a vampire.  He was ""turned"" on his wedding night by his new bride.  Even though he has to live as a vampire, you become to realize that given a choice, he would turn back.  You see another side of being a vampire-the emotional toll on someone who is one. In one episode, St. John finds a cure and becomes mortal again.  You experience with him; the joy of eating hot dogs and donuts, having a picnic on the beach (even gets a tan)and sleeping on a couch (he doesn't have a bed).  But, you also see him realize the consequences-the loss of strength, the instant healing and ultimately, St. John decides to ""turn"" again in order to save his love interest, Beth.""Moonlight"" is an original and intriguing series that will win your heart.

When someone can cancel or someones cancel something so HOT and think Firefly here too folks. Couldn't once they realized this....couldn't they get the cast and writers back? Since then I haven't enjoyed a single thing these actors have been in. Their magic was THIS show at THIS time & the oportunity of THIS window being wide open....for the Market~the hype~the awards...that now will never be. The actors and writers for their part are so vindicated. Those who choose poorly should hang their heads in shame forever. And yes EVER more. Just amazing that another network or station didn't pick this up...is it really too late to bring it back? Think Firefly too while you are at it. Anyone at the network actually ever read these reviews? They do give the Sunday cartoons lots of stuff to work with though. And while I'm on this rage.....something similar with the Golden Compass Movie series too.

If you are a fan of the Vampire genre and if you like love stories you will like Moonlight. Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles are wonderful together as Mick and Beth and their chemistry is spot on. Vampire Alex is great as the moody, intense, heartbroken, sympathetic, protective, Private Investigator and Sophia is wonderful as Beth, the girl he saved as a child, protected and fell in love with as she became a woman.  As a reporter, Beth was courageous, resolute and determined. As a woman, she was conflicted between two men until an untimely death brought her to her true love, Mick St. John. She nurtured, protected and even saved his life.  There is suspense, blood, violence, revenge, love, hope and and humor. There are some crazy Vampire moves that have you cheering on Mick as he works to right the wrongs in the lives he is trying to save.  Vampire, Business man Josef(Jason Dohring)is Mick's closest friend and the love and humor between them make you laugh and fall in love with them all at once.

Brooks,"[2, 2]","Being of the 40 something generation, I have felt overwhelmed with the teenage, tweenage, mindless fluff that has permeated television i.e. the Vampire Diaries and so on.  Moonlight was a very promising series, that was cancelled before it could truly be fleshed out.  There was simply not enough time to make the characters more real, and so the show does seem a little one dimensional.  However, for those of us who are comfortable with our maturity it spoke well to our sense of romance and adventure.It was nice that the series played on the sexual tension rather than outright sexcapades.  However they tended to hold back too much at times.  Beth Turner's character in particular seemed an emotional coward when it came to her attraction to St. John. Turner's boyfriend was definitely a fifth wheel, and his demise was too convenient making the final union of Turner and St. John fall flat.Still there very good moments between them. Coraline was a random element who made some spicy complications, and forced Turner's character to fight for the love she truly wanted.  Of all, Josef was the best. The writers made Josef so ""in"" to who and what he was, that I often liked him better than St. John. His own love-gone-wrong would have made a fascinating future embelishment to his character.

Yeah, yeah, you can say ""watch the rest and THEN make your verdict,"" but I already know what this show is just from watching the first episode. I love vampire shows, Buffy, Angel, True Blood, but those shows have constant flashes of creativity and originality with actual ""bite"" to it, and the pilot episode of Moonlight never managed to meet that kind of criteria. I liked the opening part because the set of the freezer was cool and I thought it would be great and cool just like the first minute, but then it ended up being bland (if a bit stylistic) and with average writing and average acting. Other vampire shows have had longer runs and are so much richer, complex and sexy at the same time, why waste money and time to watch this show that only lasted a few months on TV? I mean, I know people love this show, and I respect that, totally, but I just don't really understand why. There's nothing really new here, all of the characters really do seem soulless--you certainly can't relate to any of them, unlike Buffy where the characters went to high school and college and life just like we all do and actually have distinguishable personalities. I know the show has all the right intentions of trying to be cool and sexy and dark, but Angel already accomplished that with more complexity and apparent love put into it. This show just feels cold and almost phony, trying to live off of used material. I guess it's a decent way to fill the gap between other vampire shows, but I definitely don't think it stands well as an original, engrossing piece of TV entertainment. I give the pilot a 5/10. And the rest of the show is of no interest to me.

De Taeye,"[3, 3]","I hesitated between a four and a five star review for this series mostly because it's a first season (and only) that leaves many open ends and questions unanswered... frustrating, really. However, the entertainment value of the series is such that it deserves the 5 stars.I never watched it on CBS when it was out and I got to hear, read actually - about it here on amazon. The vast majority of rave reviews convinced me I should give it a try. No regret there; it was a hit for me in spite of the fact that, to my opinion, it should have been an HBO project to allow a little more ""edge"" and more wits at all levels. But for network TV, it's top quality.Alex O'Loughlin (portraying the yummy ""anti-vampire"" vampire Mick Saint John who tries to do good in spite of feeling bad for what he is) gives the top of the performances in the show, with Shannyn Sossamon (as the beautiful vampire ""ex"" Coraline) and Jason Dohring (as vampire friend Josef Kostan)sharing some really interesting parts in the series. I'm not crazy about Sophia Myles' choice for Beth, the human love interest of the sexy vampire Mick but it's not because she's not good; it's just that I would have expected a little something more from her, physically speaking. As attractive -  and a very good actress - as Myles is, I would have expected her character Beth to be a little more special, unique. Her Beth is a little too ""girl next door"" for me. Anyway, Myles and O'Loughlin work well together and their interaction is more romantic than when Mick and Morgan/Coraline share a scene. Then it is plain hot and burning! The contrast is clear, thanks to the casting.As often in network television, the rythm of each episode may seem a little formulaic at times but the characters' development make the story as much as the story itself.As a whole the blend of action and romance is very well-balanced, and there's is enough humor too to keep the series entertaining and addictive enough to watch it more than once.

Beth is human, Coraline a vampire and Mick's ex. If you enjoy vampire stories you will find this to be the best ever told - and even if you are not a fan of the genre, you will love Moonlight.  I am so happy to have it on DVD. This is a show to watch over and over, and I guarantee you will never get tired of it. After watching this DVD, you will be craving more Moonlight.  Let's hope and pray that someone is watching the DVD sales and decides to bring this incredible show back for many more seasons.

Some differences are that Mick (unlike Nick) is able to move about in the daylight and for a vampire, he is relatively young (only 85 or so compared to centuries old vampires Nick Knight and Angel).  When we see Mick's backstories, they are more current as he was ""turned"" more recently.  Several plot similarities between Moonlight and Forever Knight are... Both Mick and Nick abandon the vampire ways and seek to become human again. Both Mick and Nick are in love with humans--Mick/Beth and Nick/Natalie. Coraline (Mick's onetime love) is temporarily human while Janette (Nick's onetime love on Forever Knight) becomes human for a time but must later be turned again by Nick to save her life. Mick becomes human for a while but Josef must turn him again to save Beth's life.  Nick Knight also manages to become human for a time due to a drug and he, like Mick, immediately eats all the food in sight. Mick has a much older vamp mentor in Josef, Nick has a much older vamp mentor in Lacroix.  Both characters (Mick and Nick) are detectives, although Nick is with the police and works the night shift.  Both characters eyes change when they become their vampire personas, no real face changes like Angel or Spike (other than their vamp teeth).  Although Moonlight is an engaging series (albeit too brief), I have to give the edge to Forever Knight.  It was much richer in character development and had such interesting backstories, given the fact that they had centuries of history to use.  The vamps in Moonlight seem much more modern (and comfortable in the human world) and less intimidating to humans than the Forever Knight vamps. Both shows, however, are very entertaining, romantic and most definitely worth watching.",4,Great show but a bit of a rehash,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1893,"['liked', 'series', 'found', 'main', 'characters', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'also', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'saw', 'virtually', 'same', 'type', 'plot', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'differences', 'are', 'Mick', 'Nick', 'able', 'move', 'about', 'daylight', 'vampire', 'relatively', 'young', 'only', '85', 'so', 'compared', 'centuries', 'old', 'vampires', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'Angel', 'When', 'see', 'Mick', 'backstories', 'are', 'more', 'current', 'was', 'turned', 'more', 'recently', 'Several', 'plot', 'similarities', 'Moonlight', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'are', 'Mick', 'Nick', 'abandon', 'vampire', 'ways', 'seek', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'Mick', 'Nick', 'are', 'love', 'humans', 'Mick/Beth', 'Nick/Natalie', 'Coraline', 'Mick', 'onetime', 'love', 'temporarily', 'human', 'Janette', 'Nick', 'onetime', 'love', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'human', 'time', 'must', 'later', 'be', 'turned', 'again', 'Nick', 'save', 'life', 'Mick', 'human', 'while', 'Josef', 'must', 'turn', 'again', 'save', 'Beth', 'life', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'also', 'become', 'human', 'time', 'due', 'drug', 'Mick', 'immediately', 'food', 'sight', 'Mick', 'much', 'older', 'vamp', 'mentor', 'Josef', 'Nick', 'much', 'older', 'vamp', 'mentor', 'Lacroix', 'characters', 'Mick', 'Nick', 'are', 'detectives', 'Nick', 'police', 'night', 'shift', 'characters', 'eyes', 'change', 'when', 'become', 'vampire', 'personas', 'real', 'face', 'changes', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'other', 'vamp', 'teeth', 'Moonlight', 'engaging', 'series', 'too', 'brief', 'have', 'give', 'edge', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'was', 'much', 'richer', 'character', 'development', 'had', 'such', 'interesting', 'backstories', 'given', 'fact', 'had', 'centuries', 'history', 'use', 'vamps', 'Moonlight', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'comfortable', 'human', 'world', 'less', 'intimidating', 'humans', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'vamps', 'shows', 'however', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'romantic', 'most', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Since my purchase I have watched the Complete Series several times over and I have yet to be disappointed in this show - in fact I am only more convinced that this show should never have been cancelled!!!!  CBS made a ""BIG MISTAKE"" when they cancelled Moonlight especially when right after the cancellation the ""Vampire Craze"" went wild with all kinds of copy cat shows and movies on Vampires showing up such as ""The Twilight Saga"" or ""The Vampire Diaries"".  All the other Vampire shows and movies are OK but certianly lack what Moonlight had going for it, they hook the kiddie crowd.  Moonlight was by far the very best of all of those Vampire shows and the viewers were more than happy to let CBS know this fact.  Too bad CBS was too dumb to realize their mistake and correct it.  Moonlight never disappointed its viewers and I am no exception.Moonlight was a show that was be on amazing, the cast of people on that show (Alex O'Loughlin, Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and all the others) worked so super together.  The show was so well written, with the funny and scary moments blending in together perfectly but the best part of all was the slow progressing romance between Beth and Mick.  The series ending (also the last show sadly) was the best, no question about it!!!!  That last show no matter how many times I see it always leaves me hanging as to how the romance would have continued to develop between Beth and Mick if the show had been given the chance for a second season.  I still hope CBS will resume the show in the near future but I doubt they will.  I will continue to re-watch the Moonlight Series I purchased many times again in the future.  This is a series I am totally hooked on and would recommend anyone to purchase.

You may need to give it a couple episodes...there was a slight stiffness and occasional over-acting in the first couple episodes until they hit their stride and grew together.But after that, the show blossoms...keeps a nice modicum of suspense throughout the season. The character development and plot intricacies really pulled you in from one episode to another. Some unique twists to the typical vamp characteristics. They do a good job of contrasting an old soul like Josef - who lives more of a life of debauchery and typical vamp excesses with Mick who resents having been turned to a vamp and has dedicated his life to righting wrongs.Even Josef, we find, has a depth of feeling and soul throughout the series, and we begin to understand the friendship between them.I lost all my episodes when my DVR died, so I am so excited this is coming out soon.

1109235,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000WFW12S,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[66, 73]","To be honest, I settled for watching episodes of Moonlight (originally titled Twilight, but no doubt retitled due to the upcoming Twilight movie based on Stephenie Meyer'sTwilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)) online because I don't have a TV, and I was bored. I'm a huge fan of vampire mythology and lovedForever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)andInterview with the Vampire, and more recently Blood Ties. As I read about the show's inauspicious beginnings (the presentation pilot was universally panned, the cast recast, and two showrunners have jumped ship), I approached the pilot with apprehension.Mick St. John is a private investigator who happens to be a vampire. Mick's friend Josef Kostantin (Jason Dohring,Veronica Mars - The Complete First Season) is a much older vamp with a taste for the finest that money can buy, but he's hiding several skeletons in his deep freezer, so to speak. Mick's ex-wife Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) is the one who unwillingly turned him into a vampire on their wedding night in 1952, and she makes several appearances throughout the season. Guillermo works in the morgue and procures blood for Mick, and other vamps such as the Cleaners take care of messy vamp deaths that threaten to otherwise expose the vamp community.Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) is a reporter for the internet tabloid BuzzWire, and makes a living reporting on sensational cases involving grisly murders. Beth has the strangest sensation of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about Mick, which turns out to be a pivotal point in later episodes. Mick meets Beth while the two are researching the same murder case, and they eventually team up. In the tradition of Anne Rice's Louis, Mick loathes being a vampire, mainly because he wasn't given a choice in the matter.Frankly, at first Moonlight left me unimpressed, beginning with the vampire clich&eacute;s that Mick deadpans, and the cheesy special effects in the first couple of episodes (along with forgettable villains). However, Moonlight oozes style from every pore,  with eyecatching set design (Mick's crystal-burning fireplace is eye-popping) and decent vamp effects (eerie ice-blue contacts, the ability to move quickly and jump great heights). The prerequisite angsty alternative soundtrack includes Evanescence's ""My Immortal"" (Fallen), Mazzy Star's ""Into Dust""(So Tonight That I Might See), Nine Inch Nails ""Mr. Self Destruct"" (The Downward Spiral), Maroon Five's ""Can't Stop"" (It Won't Be Soon Before Long) and Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"" (School's Out) are prominently featured, suiting the gorgeous aerial shots of LA (a vast improvement over the nighttime ultralight panoramas of Toronto featured in Forever Knight).And Moonlight turns some vamp conventions on their head; Mick's able to walk about during the day for limited amounts of time, for one, and instead of coffins, vamps sleep in deep freezers (I pity the houseguest who goes looking for frozen peas in *that* deep freezer!).  Also, the flashbacks are generally well done, particularly the vintage music such as Louis Jordan's ""Ain't that Just Like A Woman"").The show improved and changed my opinion of it, and it's a pity that it was cancelled. I look forward to owning Moonlight on DVD. If you're a fan of Moonlight, you'll also want to check out the excellent Canadian seriesBlood Ties: The Complete Series, which features a human PI paired with a vampire as the two explore paranormal cases.",4,"Despite inauspicious beginnings, a glimmer of potential",1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,3429,"['be', 'honest', 'settled', 'watching', 'episodes', 'Moonlight', 'originally', 'titled', 'Twilight', 'doubt', 'retitled', 'due', 'upcoming', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'based', 'Stephenie', ""Meyer'sTwilight"", 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Book', '1', 'online', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'TV', 'was', 'bored', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'vampire', 'mythology', 'lovedForever', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'Part', '1', '1992', '1993', 'andInterview', 'Vampire', 'more', 'recently', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'read', 'show', 'inauspicious', 'beginnings', 'presentation', 'pilot', 'was', 'universally', 'panned', 'cast', 'recast', 'two', 'showrunners', 'have', 'jumped', 'ship', 'approached', 'pilot', 'apprehension.Mick', 'St.', 'John', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'be', 'vampire', 'Mick', 'friend', 'Josef', 'Kostantin', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'much', 'older', 'vamp', 'taste', 'finest', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'hiding', 'several', 'skeletons', 'deep', 'freezer', 'so', 'speak', 'Mick', 'ex-wife', 'Coraline', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'one', 'who', 'unwillingly', 'turned', 'vampire', 'wedding', 'night', '1952', 'several', 'appearances', 'season', 'Guillermo', 'morgue', 'procures', 'blood', 'Mick', 'other', 'vamps', 'such', 'Cleaners', 'take', 'care', 'messy', 'vamp', 'deaths', 'threaten', 'otherwise', 'expose', 'vamp', 'community.Beth', 'Turner', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'reporter', 'internet', 'tabloid', 'BuzzWire', 'living', 'reporting', 'sensational', 'cases', 'involving', 'grisly', 'murders', 'Beth', 'strangest', 'sensation', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'Mick', 'out', 'be', 'pivotal', 'point', 'later', 'episodes', 'Mick', 'meets', 'Beth', 'two', 'are', 'researching', 'same', 'murder', 'case', 'eventually', 'team', 'up', 'tradition', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Louis', 'Mick', 'being', 'vampire', 'mainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'choice', 'matter.Frankly', 'first', 'Moonlight', 'left', 'unimpressed', 'beginning', 'vampire', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Mick', 'deadpans', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'forgettable', 'villains', 'However', 'Moonlight', 'style', 'pore', 'eyecatching', 'set', 'design', 'Mick', 'crystal-burning', 'fireplace', 'eye-popping', 'decent', 'vamp', 'effects', 'eerie', 'ice-blue', 'contacts', 'ability', 'move', 'quickly', 'jump', 'great', 'heights', 'prerequisite', 'angsty', 'alternative', 'soundtrack', 'Evanescence', 'Immortal', 'Fallen', 'Mazzy', 'Star', 'Into', 'Dust', 'So', 'Tonight', 'Might', 'See', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'Mr.', 'Self', 'Destruct', 'Downward', 'Spiral', 'Maroon', 'Five', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Soon', 'Long', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'School', 'Out', 'School', 'Out', 'are', 'prominently', 'featured', 'suiting', 'gorgeous', 'aerial', 'shots', 'LA', 'vast', 'improvement', 'nighttime', 'ultralight', 'panoramas', 'Toronto', 'featured', 'Forever', 'Knight', '.And', 'Moonlight', 'vamp', 'conventions', 'head', 'Mick', 'able', 'walk', 'day', 'limited', 'amounts', 'time', 'one', 'instead', 'coffins', 'vamps', 'sleep', 'deep', 'freezers', 'pity', 'houseguest', 'who', 'looking', 'frozen', 'peas', '*that*', 'deep', 'freezer', 'Also', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'particularly', 'vintage', 'music', 'such', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'that', 'Just', 'A', 'Woman', '.The', 'show', 'improved', 'changed', 'opinion', 'pity', 'was', 'cancelled', 'look', 'forward', 'owning', 'Moonlight', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Moonlight', ""'ll"", 'also', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'excellent', 'Canadian', 'seriesBlood', 'Ties', 'Complete', 'Series', 'human', 'PI', 'paired', 'vampire', 'two', 'explore', 'paranormal', 'cases']",N/A

Just the right amount of trepidation and feistiness and deal-with-it acceptance that what is, is. Alex O'Laughlin does a super great job also, creating a vampire character (Mick) who seems totally believable despite the total impossibility of it all. Same for the supporting characters. The scene where Beth's boyfriend dies is brilliantly done! Too bad the series was cancelled. It is so much better than, say, ""Vampire Diaries.""That being said, there is the problem of the DVD production. The intro track and episodes 2 and 3 on disk #1 are a mess of jumbled pixels, so those parts of the DVD are lost. I returned the set three times trying to get one that was not defective, with no luck. However, Amazon.com gave me a gratis rebate of $25 for my trouble, so I kept the 3rd set and just live with the defects. Too bad one of the damaged episodes is the one where Mick and Beth are stuck in the desert and Mick is near death from sun exposure. I remember seeing that when it was airing on TV and it was really good. At any rate,  14 good episodes out of 16 is OK with me, given that Amazon.com made up for it with that rebate.

1109251,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000WFW12S,Tim Janson,"[2, 13]","If you're not familiar with Moonlight, you're not alone.  The short-lived CBS series ran for only 16 episodes before being canceled in 2008.  The show centers on the activities of L.A. private investigator, Mick St. John (Alex O' Laughlin) who also happens to be a vampire.  He's usually joined in his investigations by Beth Turner, a reporter for an Internet tabloid news show called ""Buzz Wire"".  Mick's best friend is Josef Kostan, a wealthy businessman and centuries old vampire.Moonlight does away with a lot of popular vampire mythology.  Vampires can go about during the day although the sun irritates them; hence Mick is normally wearing sunglasses outside.  Stakes through the heart and silver do not kill them but paralyze them.  Only beheading or fire can completely kill the vampire.  Holy water, crosses, and garlic are all useless.  The vampires don't sleep in coffins but rather in chilled compartments.The show kicked off with the episode ""No Such Things as Vampires"", introducing all the main characters.  Mick is a reluctant vampire at best, living on retail blood from blood banks as opposed to feeding on humans.  Despite being a vampire for over fifty years he still longs to be human.  Mick and Beth have an immediate connection in more ways than one.  Early on its revealed that when Beth was just a little girl, Mick rescued her from his wife Coraline.  It was Coraline who turned Mick into a vampire on their wedding night.The scripts in Moonlight were often woefully mundane.  One episode has Mick tracking a vampire who was turned as a teenager.  Pimply-faced and nerdish, this vamp is out killing call girls.  In other episodes Mick is hired to protect a young actress from aggressive Paparazzi, and try to find a vampire who has gone rogue, feeding indiscriminately and threatening to expose L,A.'s vampire community.The problem with Moonlight is that shows like ""Forever Knight"" and ""Angel"" have already beaten them to the vampire detective idea and they did it far better.  Alex O' Laughlin is a good-looking guy and he almost certainly brought in the female viewers, but he just wasn't that interesting of a character.  The romantic tensions between he and Beth seemed clumsy and forced.  There were also wild inconsistencies in the show.  In one episode, Mick is walking through an office building and dodging the sun's rays as they shine through the windows...and yet in another episode, he's walking along a beach boardwalk on a bright, sunny day and putting his hand over his eyes for shade!The show did manage to hit a few high points.  In the episode ""Love Lasts Forever"", Beth's boyfriend, an Assistant DA, is kidnapped and shot by thugs of a ruthless drug dealer.  Beth pleads with Mick to turn him into a vampire to save him and Mick is left with a decision that will have implications throughout the rest of the series.  Unfortunately, there were just not enough episodes like this to keep the show from cancellation.Moonlight was not even allowed the courtesy of bowing out gracefully as the show ended on a sour note with Mick investigating the death of a local basketball star who was having an affair with one of the city's well known vampires.One positive throughout the series' run was Jason Dohring as the wealthy and wisecracking Josef.  He breathed life into the show every time he was in a scene.  Ultimately, the show failed due to a lack of originality and uninspired writing.",3,VAMPIRES ARE NOT ROMANTIC!!!,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,3430,"[""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Moonlight', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'short-lived', 'CBS', 'series', 'ran', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'being', 'canceled', '2008', 'show', 'centers', 'activities', 'L.A.', 'private', 'investigator', 'Mick', 'St.', 'John', 'Alex', 'O', 'Laughlin', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'vampire', 'usually', 'joined', 'investigations', 'Beth', 'Turner', 'reporter', 'Internet', 'tabloid', 'news', 'show', 'called', 'Buzz', 'Wire', 'Mick', 'best', 'friend', 'Josef', 'Kostan', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'centuries', 'old', 'vampire.Moonlight', 'away', 'lot', 'popular', 'vampire', 'mythology', 'Vampires', 'can', 'go', 'day', 'sun', 'hence', 'Mick', 'normally', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'outside', 'Stakes', 'heart', 'silver', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'paralyze', 'Only', 'beheading', 'fire', 'can', 'completely', 'kill', 'vampire', 'Holy', 'water', 'crosses', 'garlic', 'are', 'useless', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'coffins', 'rather', 'chilled', 'compartments.The', 'show', 'kicked', 'off', 'episode', 'Such', 'Things', 'Vampires', 'introducing', 'main', 'characters', 'Mick', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'best', 'living', 'retail', 'blood', 'blood', 'banks', 'opposed', 'feeding', 'humans', 'being', 'vampire', 'fifty', 'years', 'still', 'be', 'human', 'Mick', 'Beth', 'have', 'immediate', 'connection', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Early', 'revealed', 'when', 'Beth', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'Mick', 'rescued', 'wife', 'Coraline', 'was', 'Coraline', 'who', 'turned', 'Mick', 'vampire', 'wedding', 'night.The', 'scripts', 'Moonlight', 'were', 'often', 'woefully', 'mundane', 'One', 'episode', 'Mick', 'tracking', 'vampire', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'teenager', 'Pimply-faced', 'nerdish', 'vamp', 'out', 'killing', 'call', 'girls', 'other', 'episodes', 'Mick', 'hired', 'protect', 'young', 'actress', 'aggressive', 'Paparazzi', 'try', 'find', 'vampire', 'who', 'gone', 'rogue', 'feeding', 'indiscriminately', 'threatening', 'expose', 'L', 'A', 'vampire', 'community.The', 'problem', 'Moonlight', 'shows', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'Angel', 'have', 'already', 'beaten', 'vampire', 'detective', 'idea', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'Alex', 'O', 'Laughlin', 'good-looking', 'guy', 'almost', 'certainly', 'brought', 'female', 'viewers', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'character', 'romantic', 'tensions', 'Beth', 'seemed', 'clumsy', 'forced', 'were', 'also', 'wild', 'inconsistencies', 'show', 'one', 'episode', 'Mick', 'walking', 'office', 'building', 'dodging', 'sun', 'rays', 'shine', 'windows', 'yet', 'episode', 'walking', 'along', 'beach', 'boardwalk', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'putting', 'hand', 'eyes', 'shade', 'show', 'did', 'manage', 'hit', 'few', 'high', 'points', 'episode', 'Love', 'Forever', 'Beth', 'boyfriend', 'Assistant', 'DA', 'kidnapped', 'shot', 'thugs', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Beth', 'Mick', 'turn', 'vampire', 'save', 'Mick', 'left', 'decision', 'will', 'have', 'implications', 'rest', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'show', 'cancellation.Moonlight', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'allowed', 'courtesy', 'bowing', 'out', 'gracefully', 'show', 'ended', 'sour', 'note', 'Mick', 'investigating', 'death', 'local', 'basketball', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'one', 'city', 'well', 'known', 'vampires.One', 'positive', 'series', 'run', 'was', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'wealthy', 'wisecracking', 'Josef', 'breathed', 'life', 'show', 'time', 'was', 'scene', 'Ultimately', 'show', 'failed', 'due', 'lack', 'originality', 'uninspired', 'writing']",N/A

He spends his days trying to help humans out by being a private eye - apparently setting your own hours is really helpful when it comes to being undead. Mick has friends, foes, and some people that would be hard to place in a corner but, in the end, it is a tabloid reporter that catches his eye. During a ""vampire kiler"" story this newbie reporter is writing, Mick notices her and he remembers something that ahppened years ago - something that altered his life forever.When you talk about series that were great for TV and that you hated to see cancelled, this is one of those for me. Sure, Mick had some cases that were not beautiful and, sure, he wasn't really good at being a vampire. He had a lot of weakness in him because he didn't like the idea of drinking the living and, as a result, he spent a lot of his episodes against a wall while picking splinter sout of his skin. Still, mick was nobody's punk and he took it and he deals it out just the same and that is likeable.What was also likeable was the way the rules were changed to vampires. The coffin trick was not the metho a lot of vamps liked, the drinking of blood was optional, and the sunlight was not the damnation of vampires.

Times may have changed, with television dramas of the 21st century sometimes reaching (or even surpassing) the production quality of films, but Moonlight tries a different approach: it goes on the cheap. And it shows. The lackluster production quality, combined with an ineffectual lead actor as lead vampire, results in a pretty dull show. Even Sophia Myles, who was outstanding on an episode of Doctor Who and rather good in Underworld, is unable to save this mess -- perhaps because she first has to reign in her English accent. Another recognizable face is Jason Dohring, who seems to pick up exactly where his character of ""Logan"" in the fantastic series Veronica Mars left off -- still perpetually stuck in a fancy room, only now he's a vampire; if you can tell the difference raise your hand. The lack of chemistry between all these characters is appalling, and the stories that drive each episode rarely rise to the level of 1970s Aaron Spelling product. Not a surprise this show was cancelled. The only actor who seems on the ball is Alias' Kevin Weisman (""Marshall"" on Alias), but he's only a supporting part here.",2,Production values of Forever Knight -- today!,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,1185,"['low', 'production', 'values', 'Forever', 'Knight', '1992', 'today', 'Times', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'television', 'dramas', '21st', 'century', 'sometimes', 'reaching', 'even', 'surpassing', 'production', 'quality', 'films', 'Moonlight', 'different', 'approach', 'cheap', 'lackluster', 'production', 'quality', 'combined', 'ineffectual', 'lead', 'actor', 'lead', 'vampire', 'results', 'pretty', 'dull', 'show', 'Even', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'who', 'was', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'rather', 'good', 'Underworld', 'unable', 'save', 'mess', 'perhaps', 'first', 'reign', 'English', 'accent', 'recognizable', 'face', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'character', 'Logan', 'fantastic', 'series', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'left', 'off', 'still', 'perpetually', 'stuck', 'fancy', 'room', 'only', 'now', 'vampire', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'raise', 'hand', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'appalling', 'stories', 'drive', 'episode', 'rarely', 'rise', 'level', '1970s', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'product', 'Not', 'surprise', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'ball', 'Alias', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marshall', 'Alias', 'only', 'supporting', 'part', 'here']",N/A

This is actually quite an engaging and interesting tv series and is one of my favorites (the others being ""Forever Knight"", ""Angel"", and ""True Blood"").  Alex O'Loughlin plays Mick St. John, a PI based in LA who has been living as a vampire for the past 50 or so years, after being turned by his vampire bride on their wedding night (Shannyn Sossamon). In the first episode, Mick is investigating some murders that appear to be vampire-related, and encounters a young reporter, Beth (Sophia Myles). Unknown to Beth, Mick was the same man who rescued her from being the victim of a vampire when she was a child. Throughout this first season, the relationship between these two progresses slowly but surely, and is one the highlights of the show. Every episode is well put-together, with credible acting and dialogue, though honestly, I did not think the stories were all that fresh (probably because I've watched way too many vampire-themed stories). But, things do take an interesting turn when Coraline, Mick's vampire bride (whom he had believed dead) returns as Morgan, and possesses new knowledge that may have the potential to make Mick human again. This DVD set has a total running time of 692 minutes (16 episodes in all) on 4 discs. Unfortunately, there are no extras (I'm guessing this is because it was a one season series).
