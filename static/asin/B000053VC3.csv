Oh well.It was nice to see her as the lead, as well as Jon, who gives a very funny Vince Vaughn type performance, similar to the comedy seen today, the Seth Rogan style of incessant, well delivered innuendo. Janssen is good also. She's beautiful, but a bit more out of place with the racy material.It's not entirely explained how she went from the cute girl we see in the beginning to the slut she becomes, and the same is true of Jon becoming a slut after being in a relationship with her. This movie seems to support my sinking suspicion that most couples are in a relationship for no reason (and speak of the devil, the imdb says this film is autobiographical.) The film has both elements of its title, but not much else, which is dissapointing.This is a 2000 film.

566041,A3DSTOJPRMV674,B000053VC3,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[7, 15]","The inappropriately titled ""Love and Sex"" would be more accurately termed ""Love and Rocky Relationships,"" but with the popularity of HBO's ""Sex and the City,"" one can forgive the writers/filmmakers for trying to forge a connection between the two. But there are many similarities between this 2000 film and the HBO series. Both deal with a well-to-do writer trying to come to terms with the frustrations of modern-day relationships and dating. Both are told from a female perspective. And eventually, both are eerily accurate documents on the at-times heartbtreaking frustrations of dating in the new millennium.Make no doubt, ""Love and Sex"" is a charming film blessed with a witty screenplay and two talented and extremely appealing leads in Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau. Where this film eventually trips up - and where ""Sex and the City"" never does - is to tie up everything by the conclusion with a sweet bow of a happy ending. Quite frankly, this would never happen in real life. But this film was made in Los Angeles, and the last time a flick with anything but a happy ending came out of that factory was probably around 1979.The relationship between Janssen and Favreau, a magazine writer and artist most likely in their late 20s/early 30s, has the ring of truth throughout. And their chemistry will delight the most jaded viewer. Their eventual breakup and how they deal with the pain of moving on will absolutely strike a chord in viewers. Alertly captured, never has the dysfunction of a relationship's breakup seemed more honestly accurate. From tears and beers to bad dreams and self-inflicted isolation, the painful steps these former lovers go through should be instantly identifiable.The comedy is strong, and viewers will undoubtedly laugh heartily at several of the situations. But as the film progresses, it is apparent this failed couple has completely moved off from each other. So much so, that the very thought of rekindling their love would appear to be the furtherest thing from their minds. Thus, the contrived happy ending rings with the hollow truth of a wooden nickel.Sure, we would all like to daydream a similar happy ending with ex lovers/partners, especially the one painted with such Hollywood-like strokes by the filmmakers of ""Love and Sex."" But a film that claims to cut to the nitty gritty of love, relationships and sex in the modern era doesn't stay true to form, and practically sabotages itself with its incredibly contrived ending. And so a film most single viewers should initially relate to will eventually violate their trust. Frankly, the final scene of ""The Way We Were"" (for better or worse one of the great relationship movies of all time) had a more truthful resolution than this flick does.""Love and Sex"" is not a bad film. It has charm, wit and appeal. It is an honest attempt at documenting modern-day relationships.

It has been about a year since I saw this film, so forgive me if I am wrong. I do know they at least end up as friends.

566046,AP18F4HV5L3BG,B000053VC3,face02,"[8, 9]","This was a very good ""romantic comedy"".  I hesitate to use that term, because it usually conjures up visions of cheesy Chick-Flicks.  This is a romantic comedy the way it should be, with more comedy and honesty and less cliched moments.What really drives this movie is the great chemistry between Favreau and Janssen.  There are some great, great moments between them, that unlike most romantic films, didn't seem fake or rehearsed.The film is basically the story of Janssen's character reminscing about all her past relationships, start to finish, and what went wrong.  The film doesn't sugar coat relationships, it shows them in an honest, but humorous, light.  Her most important relationship was with Favreau's character, and provides the most humor, pleasure, and pain for the viewer.This was a very well written film, with overall good performances.I have a few complaints though.  First, like everyone else, I wanted more of Janssen and Favreau - they were just that good together.  Secondly, the dvd cover shamelessly flaunts it's most recognizable star (Oteri) even though she only has MAYBE five minutes of screen time, and is in no way important to the film.  Also, some of the relationships were overviewed too quickly.  The film was only 90 minutes long, and could have been another 20 or so and still been very entertaining.Other than those problems with the film, I would have loved a commentary track on the dvd.  I would love to know how much of Favreau's lines were improvised.  Also, with a 90 minute movie, I'd imagine there are deleted scenes floating around somewhere, and it would have been nice to see some of them.If you are looking for a dvd with a lot of great features, plus a very good film, you may want to stay away and try to find it to rent first.But, if you don't mind getting a bare-bones disc, buy it.

Mainly the female character is doing a lot of experimenting.The situations shown in the movie are sort of cameos in a way that only represent the underlying issues that can really happen.  Many complications that can arise are not addressed such as for example someone quitting their job because they don't believe in what they're doing, etc..Also a beautiful woman is probably not going to be randomly running around having sex for free in the real world.After 13 relationships I'm not sure where 'experimentation' becomes something else.  But as I said it's more of the underlying issues that are being represented as the story shows what can often go wrong (i.e. the guy is really married, etc..).  Maybe the number '13' is like a symbol for bad luck in the movie.The main question I think is what is it that causes a relationship to be successful over the long term.The answer to that is I suppose related to what the individuals want.  If they don't want the same things problems can arise.  There's a miscarriage in the story which perhaps indicates that she didn't want to start a family at that particular time.Another point is that a purely physical relationship may not last.  Rather there must be an intellectual and / or spiritual connection.It also gets into the idea of 'love at first sight'.  Sometimes when we meet another person we may get the feeling that we have 'known them forever'.

Blake ""Super Reader""","[5, 5]","Romantic Comedy,SynopsisKate Welles (Famke Janssen) is a writer at Monique magazine whose editor assigns her an article on the perfect relationship. She is supposed to draw on personal experience, but Kate is so unlucky in love that she refers to herself as a ""relationship leper."" As she sifts through the emotional debris of her past, however, flashbacks reveal that she did once meet a great guy--Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), a painter who swept Kate off her feet and fell in love with her in return. Their relationship ended because Adam didn't feel experienced enough for Kate; now he dates bimbos or, if they're intelligent, ""bimbo savants."" This romantic comedy about neurotic people pays homage to the Woody Allen and Nora Ephron films that paved its way, but director Valerie Breiman makes the story new with an honest, even blunt, script that speaks to a different generation of dating singles.

In this romantic comedy,  both Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau absolutely shine. their on-screen chemistry is superb, and seems amazingly natural. Favourite scenes of mine, include the first date (where Jon comments on Famke's history of men with the line &quot;you're...like a whore!&quot;), the farting in bed scene (- hilarious, and Famke's reaction to Jon looks so natural it's hard to believe she was acting!), and an excellent cameo from David Schwimmer towards the end of the film. Also worth pointing out is the Robert De Niro wannabe, who just loves to impersonate his favourite actor. I haven't seem many films starring either of the two leads featured here, but both Jon and Famke give top-notch performances. My only criticism of the film - and this is nit-picking really - is that it's too short.

Or not worth the money you paid for the magazine. But this seemed tempting, as it was a romance (my favourite kind), and had Famke Janssen and the brilliant Jon Favreau in it.When I started watching it, I was entranced straight away. Despite having loads of piracy trailers before the actual movie, and not having much else in the way of extras (only a trailer), I found myself laughing, and nearly in tears at points.Everyone knows (or at least, I know) Jon Favreau from Friends - he played Monica's millionaire boyfriend, Pete, who then tried to become a World Fighting Champion. He was fantastic in this. Playing an artist this time, who does very surreal paintings. (Someone pulling a severed head out of somewhere for example!) He was fantastically funny, brilliantly neurotic, and apart from the awful side burns, and the curly goatee (not both at the same time thankfully), was also kinda cute looking. In a way where you want to give him a cuddle. Not knee-trembling gorgeous.Famke Janssen starts off in the film, as a 9-year-old girl, who is in love with the guy who bullies her. (Right) She's kinda geeky looking, and not what you'd call pretty, but what children ever are? She's totally `in love' with this guy, until she tells all to her big-mouthed friend, and ends up in tears when he dumps her. After this, she quite happily admits to having relationships with thirteen men (I'm falling WAY behind by her standards), which she admits to Adam's character over lunch/dinner/something. Later he tells her that he's only been with two women. (Very reminiscent of a scene in an early season of Friends when Monica and Richard are together, and are telling each other how many people they've slept with. Monica's is less than a ballpoint, and Richard's is two) By the end of the movie, this number has risen up to 14 - having a relationship with a Not-So-Bright-Porn-Star-Robert De Niro- loving actor. The whole point of this movie is that Famke's character is a journalist, and has to write an article about relationships - in which she knows more about, how shall we say, giving guys `pleasure', than actual relationships. Most of the movie is done in flashback, as she goes through most of the bad/good relationships she's had, with narration, as the article gets written through her experiences - with lots of cheesy/romantic lines thrown in along the way!This film goes into what relationships are all about, and how you have to go through a lot of guys before you find the perfect one. It also briefly touches the painful subject of unwanted pregnancy, and then losing the baby anyway. There's also some strange scenes, where they realise they haven't had slept together for 3 weeks, try, and then realise they're ""too tired"". And then the all too painful break-up. You can work out what happens from there on.This is a terrific film, to watch as a couple (the guys will probably like Famke, as she appears wearing very little most of the time), or to watch alone, and think about the pain of relationships. Or the good things about relationships. Depends what mood you're in really. The DVD is definitely worth keeping, full of fun, happiness, and sadness all at the time. Once in a blue moon, you will get a free DVD, that is actually really good! It will be a good addition to my growing collection.Watch out for an uncredited `cameo' by David Schwimmer (Ross from Friends) too!",4,You Have To Kiss Many Frogs Before You Find A Prince,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,3527,"['got', 'DVD', 'free', 'magazine', ""'m"", 'normally', 'very', 'wary', 'DVDs', 'get', 'handed', 'out', 'so', 'freely', ""'re"", 'normally', 'really', 'bad', 'not', 'money', 'paid', 'magazine', 'seemed', 'tempting', 'was', 'romance', 'favourite', 'kind', 'had', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'brilliant', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'it.When', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'entranced', 'straight', 'away', 'having', 'loads', 'piracy', 'trailers', 'actual', 'movie', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'else', 'way', 'extras', 'only', 'trailer', 'found', 'laughing', 'nearly', 'tears', 'points.Everyone', 'knows', 'least', 'know', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Friends', 'played', 'Monica', 'millionaire', 'boyfriend', 'Pete', 'who', 'then', 'tried', 'become', 'World', 'Fighting', 'Champion', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Playing', 'artist', 'time', 'who', 'very', 'surreal', 'paintings', 'Someone', 'pulling', 'severed', 'head', 'somewhere', 'example', 'was', 'fantastically', 'funny', 'brilliantly', 'neurotic', 'apart', 'awful', 'side', 'burns', 'curly', 'goatee', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'thankfully', 'was', 'also', 'kinda', 'cute', 'looking', 'way', 'where', 'want', 'give', 'cuddle', 'Not', 'knee-trembling', 'gorgeous.Famke', 'Janssen', 'film', '9-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'guy', 'who', 'Right', 'kinda', 'geeky', 'looking', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'pretty', 'what', 'children', 'ever', 'are', 'totally', 'love', 'guy', 'big-mouthed', 'friend', 'up', 'tears', 'when', 'quite', 'happily', 'having', 'relationships', 'thirteen', 'men', ""'m"", 'falling', 'WAY', 'standards', 'Adam', 'character', 'lunch/dinner/something', 'Later', 'only', 'been', 'two', 'women', 'Very', 'reminiscent', 'scene', 'early', 'season', 'Friends', 'when', 'Monica', 'Richard', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'telling', 'other', 'how', 'many', 'people', ""'ve"", 'slept', 'Monica', 'less', 'ballpoint', 'Richard', 'two', 'end', 'movie', 'number', 'risen', 'up', '14', 'having', 'relationship', 'Not-So-Bright-Porn-Star-Robert', 'De', 'Niro-', 'loving', 'actor', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'Famke', 'character', 'journalist', 'write', 'article', 'relationships', 'more', 'how', 'shall', 'say', 'giving', 'guys', 'pleasure', 'actual', 'relationships', 'Most', 'movie', 'done', 'flashback', 'most', 'bad/good', 'had', 'narration', 'article', 'written', 'experiences', 'lots', 'cheesy/romantic', 'lines', 'thrown', 'way', 'film', 'what', 'relationships', 'are', 'how', 'have', 'go', 'lot', 'guys', 'find', 'perfect', 'one', 'also', 'painful', 'subject', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'then', 'losing', 'baby', 'anyway', 'also', 'strange', 'scenes', 'where', 'realise', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'slept', 'together', '3', 'weeks', 'try', 'then', 'realise', ""'re"", 'too', 'tired', 'then', 'too', 'painful', 'break-up', 'can', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'on.This', 'terrific', 'film', 'watch', 'couple', 'guys', 'will', 'probably', 'Famke', 'wearing', 'very', 'little', 'most', 'time', 'watch', 'alone', 'think', 'pain', 'relationships', 'good', 'things', 'relationships', 'what', 'mood', ""'re"", 'really', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'keeping', 'full', 'fun', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'time', 'Once', 'blue', 'moon', 'will', 'get', 'free', 'DVD', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'growing', 'collection.Watch', 'out', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Ross', 'Friends', 'too']",N/A
