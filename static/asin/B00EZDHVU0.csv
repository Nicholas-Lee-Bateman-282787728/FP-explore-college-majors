Sisti ""ftt meditator""","[0, 1]","It is extremely difficult to find fault with Sir Michael Caine's work even when he is attempting to bring his masterful characterization capabilities to a looming tragedy being played out in the story.The other two principals in the movie do an adequate job with their roles as the muse/with daddy issues and the son with daddy issues, but only adequate. I will admit that there was just one moment when the son is told something important to the story line that the actor manages to let his facial facade drop and you can actually see that, for that very brief moment, he was in complete tune with the story. Unfortunately, that was one moment in the entire movie that was not dependent on Michael's performance.I would offer that if the writer had been really bold they might have attempted to tell the story of the recently (3+ years), widowed professor with only one character - Michael, and the story would have been more powerful, but more difficult to write, for taking that bolder path than the more maudlin path chosen.That having been said, the story does play out as a more average tale of lost love and coming to grips with that loss in a manner that is more frequent and mundane. The story tries to push the audience to understand that one scene will lead to a more intense, but similar scene, in the very near future in the piece and I personally find that unreal mechanism to be annoying. After all the viewing audience may be brighter than the writer and director can fathom.If you enjoy Caine's work than this movie will only add to your pleasure but if you are looking for a less-than-heavy-handed attempt to deal with such a poignant reality as meeting the end of the road then you might go elsewhere.",3,"There Is A Lot To Like In The Story And Also ""Not""",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1720,"['extremely', 'difficult', 'find', 'fault', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'work', 'even', 'when', 'attempting', 'bring', 'masterful', 'characterization', 'capabilities', 'looming', 'tragedy', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'story.The', 'other', 'two', 'principals', 'movie', 'do', 'adequate', 'job', 'roles', 'muse/with', 'daddy', 'issues', 'son', 'daddy', 'issues', 'only', 'adequate', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'son', 'told', 'something', 'important', 'story', 'line', 'actor', 'let', 'facial', 'facade', 'drop', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'very', 'brief', 'moment', 'was', 'complete', 'tune', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'one', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'dependent', 'Michael', 'performance.I', 'would', 'offer', 'writer', 'had', 'been', 'really', 'bold', 'might', 'have', 'attempted', 'tell', 'story', 'recently', '3+', 'years', 'widowed', 'professor', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'Michael', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'more', 'difficult', 'write', 'taking', 'bolder', 'path', 'more', 'maudlin', 'path', 'chosen.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'story', 'play', 'out', 'more', 'average', 'tale', 'lost', 'love', 'coming', 'grips', 'loss', 'manner', 'more', 'frequent', 'mundane', 'story', 'push', 'audience', 'understand', 'one', 'scene', 'will', 'lead', 'more', 'intense', 'similar', 'scene', 'very', 'near', 'future', 'piece', 'personally', 'find', 'unreal', 'mechanism', 'be', 'annoying', 'viewing', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'brighter', 'writer', 'director', 'can', 'fathom.If', 'enjoy', 'Caine', 'work', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'pleasure', 'are', 'looking', 'less-than-heavy-handed', 'attempt', 'deal', 'poignant', 'reality', 'meeting', 'end', 'road', 'then', 'might', 'go', 'elsewhere']",Last Love

It seemed as if Michael Caine who plays the lead was as depressed as his character. The storyline dragged as his character, a retired professor who was trying to recover from the death of his beloved wife. Although they lived in Paris, there was no joy after she died. He met a young woman, Pauly, played by Clemenceau Poesy, who was also all alone, and their misery brought them together.It is not until a trauma occurs that the film picks up. Matthew's self absorbed daughter, Karen, played by Gillian Anderson and his son, Miles played by Justin Kirk, come to Paris to save him that the pace picks up. But, really, the film is all about lost love, words unsaid and the disjointed families trying to find their way.But, then, again, the film slows and becomes the cliche it is.

1669869,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00EZDHVU0,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","Sandra Nettelbeck (""No Reservations"", ""Helen"") wrote the screenplay and directed this small movie rich in emotion.  In this we are looking at how people love, all types of loving relationships, not solely romantic.  Nettelbeck makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall while you are seeing everything and experiencing these things right along with these characters.  This is also how I felt when I first saw her movie, ""Helen"".  Another heartrending movie full of emotion and very patient in love.When the film begins, Matthew (Michael Caine, who is phenomenally understated in this) meets Pauline (Clemence Poesy) by happenstance on a city train and they quickly form a bond. He has been extremely lonely since his wife, Joan (Jane Alexander), passed away some years - about 3 - ago.  Joan and Matthew's son, Miles (Justin Kirk), and daughter, Karen (Gillian Anderson), immediately get out to France and meet Pauline, who by now has strong feelings for their father and his towards her.  Karen seems like she is not phased by anything while Miles is filled with contempt towards his father, then turns it on Pauline.  Working out that anger becomes a major issue for Miles; he doesn't have all the facts about certain life-altering information that he should know.  Matthew is grieving so hard and also has his feelings all mixed up with Pauline's.  He has just undergone a horrible tragedy with the death of his wife and Miles thinks it is way too early for his father to be involved with someone that could be his granddaughter.We see Joan as Matthew sees her, in the present, when she comes and advises him, snuggles next to him in their bed, or is with him so he is not alone.  You see the loving relationship that they had in their long term marriage and are now seeing him with Pauline as they are starting to open up with each other.  Things grow quite slowly in the film, it takes its time with the character development and the different relationships to form.  Growing them to fruition?  I wouldn't want to spoil this movie.  I enjoyed its slow pace and lackadaisical feel.  There are times when it will speed up, but always downshifts quickly.  This isn't a movie with action, suspense, physical fighting, it is more for your thoughts; cerebral if you will.  You could call this story emotional and moodily thoughtful.  It certainly made me think about my relationships and how important are second chances, and third, and fourth ...",5,"""You Wear Your Heart On Your Sleeve"" - Matthew",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2450,"['Sandra', 'Nettelbeck', 'Reservations', 'Helen', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'small', 'movie', 'rich', 'emotion', 'are', 'looking', 'how', 'people', 'love', 'types', 'loving', 'relationships', 'not', 'solely', 'romantic', 'Nettelbeck', 'feel', 'are', 'fly', 'wall', 'are', 'seeing', 'everything', 'experiencing', 'things', 'right', 'characters', 'also', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'Helen', 'heartrending', 'movie', 'full', 'emotion', 'very', 'patient', 'film', 'Matthew', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'phenomenally', 'understated', 'Pauline', 'Clemence', 'Poesy', 'happenstance', 'city', 'train', 'quickly', 'form', 'bond', 'been', 'extremely', 'lonely', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'passed', 'away', 'years', 'about', '3', 'ago', 'Joan', 'Matthew', 'son', 'Miles', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'daughter', 'Karen', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'immediately', 'get', 'out', 'France', 'meet', 'Pauline', 'who', 'now', 'strong', 'feelings', 'father', 'towards', 'Karen', 'not', 'phased', 'anything', 'Miles', 'filled', 'contempt', 'towards', 'father', 'then', 'Pauline', 'Working', 'out', 'anger', 'major', 'issue', 'Miles', ""n't"", 'have', 'facts', 'certain', 'life-altering', 'information', 'should', 'know', 'Matthew', 'grieving', 'so', 'hard', 'also', 'feelings', 'mixed', 'up', 'Pauline', 'just', 'undergone', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'death', 'wife', 'Miles', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'father', 'be', 'involved', 'someone', 'could', 'be', 'granddaughter.We', 'see', 'Joan', 'Matthew', 'present', 'when', 'next', 'bed', 'so', 'not', 'alone', 'see', 'loving', 'relationship', 'had', 'long', 'term', 'marriage', 'are', 'now', 'seeing', 'Pauline', 'are', 'starting', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'Things', 'grow', 'quite', 'slowly', 'film', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'different', 'relationships', 'form', 'Growing', 'fruition', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'slow', 'pace', 'lackadaisical', 'feel', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'will', 'speed', 'up', 'always', 'downshifts', 'quickly', ""n't"", 'movie', 'action', 'suspense', 'physical', 'fighting', 'more', 'thoughts', 'cerebral', 'will', 'could', 'call', 'story', 'emotional', 'moodily', 'thoughtful', 'certainly', 'made', 'think', 'relationships', 'how', 'important', 'are', 'second', 'chances', 'third', 'fourth']",Last Love
