1366176,A1B0V3K3KU2SUA,B003UH3RQO,Mag,"[0, 0]","I have purchased many exercise tapes and DVD's over the years, including one or two Yoga presentations.  At last I have found one that works and doesn't drive me nuts with a 20-something yelling for half an hour.  No, the instructor has a very soothing voice, the other two people working with her are totally silent throughout the tape, and there is NO music!  Thank God!  The first day, I was quite frustrated trying to do as she directed and did not finish the work-out.  The second day, I got most of it down due to better concentration, and the third day (today) I got almost all of it by really listening to &#34;right/left&#34; commands.I bought this DVD because I've had a rotten ski season due to pain in my left hip/lower back area.  I move my furniture around a lot, so probably twisted the wrong way at some point.  One day last week, I went skiing even though I was hurting, got up there and found I could not take more than one run because I was in such pain, even having taken an Aleve that morning.  I stretched when I got home, used and ice pack on the hip, and took Aleve again, all to no avail, and I was miserable in bed.  I've been in pain until yesterday when I did most of the Yoga routine on this dvd and was totally amazed and shocked that my pain went away, and I woke up this morning feeling normal.  In fact, I felt good enough to ski, but did not because I wasn't organized enough to go.Well, I did this routine again tonight, and really feel good.  One other reviewer said they felt great after they did the tape only once, and, really, I thought &#34;this can't be&#34;, but I found out it really does work if you apply the instructor's directions and are serious about finishing the whole workout.  I now wish I had started Yoga 40 years ago.  I am almost 68, but have always been in good shape for the most part.  I do not like exercise in general, like what you get at gyms (I belong to 3), and I hardly use my 2 pieces of exercise equipment because it is too boring.  But this workout is fabulous.  It is easy and difficult at the same time; there is no sweating or pounding, but somehow it works.  I thought my ski season was over, but now I plan to go at the first opportunity when we get more new snow.  I also plan to look into other dvd's by this wonderful instructor who I found on PBS.  I am so thankful I was able to fix my problem with this yoga workout instead of going to a doctor, followed by more boring therapy.  Try it; you will be amazed if you have the patience to get through the first day.
