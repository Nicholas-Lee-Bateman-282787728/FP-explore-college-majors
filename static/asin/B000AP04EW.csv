930109,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000AP04EW,Alistair McHarg,"[19, 30]","Interestingly enough, this plot was made into a movie several years ago using real actors. Prizzi's Honor, with Jack Nicholson and a then scrumptious Kathleen Turner was smart, sophisticated, funny, and surprising.By contrast, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, little more than a vehicle for two well recognized faces, is dumb, puerile, drab, and almost frighteningly predictable. The meager hopes of this packaged Hollywood frozen dinner rest exclusively on the shoulders of its co-stars, and any alleged ""chemistry"" between them. That there is none dooms the effort, even the ""hot reconciliation scene"" in the kitchen looks staged and false, creating enough warmth perhaps for a weak cup of tea but not quite enough to poach an egg.Angelina Jolie's lips seem to be on the verge of taking over her entire face, while Brad Pitt, who still looks like he's about 12 years old, is unconvincing in a part clearly written exclusively for him. Viewers are expected to forgive far too much in this glossy bubble of vapor. The plot is beyond ludicrous, the performances lethargic, frequently the scenery threatens to walk off with the movie.Mission Impossible settings and a pretty darn good car chase prevent one from going to sleep, but cannot redeem this effort.

Again I'm having So much fun with Halloween this year I had to celebrate early planning my Illyria stories with costumes (celebrate the holiday for more then 1 day) okay movie. One of my favorite things; casting. They just make the best spy couple, me and my friends have been talking about this for days I've even been writing story parts for the ballroom scene for like 3 stories. I thought that joke where Brad said he had an ex(although no offense cause I like those actresses....not her exes though) and she said jokingly that he was her problem then asked for the address and he jokingly said no you're not going to kill her...plus that's during an awesome fight scene!  And I liked that they actually did know that they were spies (plus even in a movie how could you not) I thought Brad Pitts best friend was really funny...You live with your mom....carrying joke. And I thought that ballroom scene was great, and kinda batman returns like....with the knife in that Brad threw in the wall during the sexy spy dance....then we find out they're gonna stay together....(good cause I really liked those two together in this movie.) But I'm not done, not just yet I have a few more parts I liked. First there's the elevator scene. That is so funny I grew up on that joke (corny music in a dramatic scene) when I was a kid.

The first session at the start of the film introduces the characters John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) who are facing difficulties in their marriage of 5 years (John) or 6 years (Jane).  And we have a flash back to their first meeting, whirlwind romance, and marriage. One of the big draws is that each has a career that requires frequent and unexpected travel; he's a construction engineer and she's a computer consultant.  However, as we soon learn, they are actually highly skilled assassins.Then they are each assigned the same target, foul the other up, and are expected to take out the assassin that foiled the hit. Then they discover the other assassin was their spouse. Then begins the misunderstandings, distrust, and havoc. There's lots of one liner quips, explosions, and neat action sequences. Eventually, as the realization that they really do love each other overcomes their trained suspicions, they begin to work together and you can see them go from not understanding the hand signals, beaming each other with equipment to smooth handoffs of ammunition cartridges and working as a team. The movie ends with another marriage counselor sequence where they are happily finding their marriage works.It's not deep, but it's fun and full of excitement.

930115,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000AP04EW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Despite the fact that this movie received more attention due to its stars off-screen relationship and most likely destroyed the box-office because of it, there is really no denying that on-screen these two are impeccable together.  Honestly, watching them together is so natural and pleasant that if their home life is anything like their film life then I completely understand why they're together.  They interact so effortlessly together, so naturally and beautifully that it transcends acting altogether.  That really is the biggest draw to `Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.  This is one of those cases where the actors really elevate the body of the film.  `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has is detractors, but overall this is such a fun film that those faults are easily forgiven.  Angelina Jolie has never been more radiant then she is in this film (I'm telling you, I don't get the Golden Globe `Comedy/Musical' Actress snub at all!!!), and Brad Pitt has never been more charming (some may disagree, but I'm sticking with that statement for the time being).  That coupled with Adam Brody and Vince Vaughn serving up some hilarious supporting performances and you get a well rounded good time.So the movie finds our two stars in a loveless marriage if that is at all believable.  The first scene has them arguing calmly before a marriage councilor.  In a sense they are bored.  They've been married for five or six years and within those years their lives have become so routine, so predictable that they can't stand each other.  What each fails to realize is that their lives are the furthest things from routine, for they really don't know each other at all.  In fact, both John and Jane Smith are assassins working for conflicting agencies, and when they are both hired to assassinate the same target they end up confronted with the truth about each other, and their marriage starts to heat up as they are instructed to take each other out.The film's major detractor is its running length.  While it is only a two hour film and that in itself may not seem like a long time, with a film of the genre it can seem to drag a bit.  I know that seems odd but action films, like comedies, are generally shorter than your dramas and biopics.  By the time you get to the final stretch of `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' you may feel a bit worn out, but it's only a mere few minutes away from the credits so hold in there.  Aside from that minor complaint I really can't say too many bad things about this film.  At times it is a bit clich&eacute;d, but what film isn't these days.  The acting, like I said, really makes up for any and all issues with the film.  Aside from Pitt and Jolie there is Vince Vaughn who is just hysterical here as John's best friend Eddie, and Adam Brody is spot on as Benjamin Danz, a kid who may know more than he's letting on.  I would have loved to see Kerry Washington used a little more than she is.  Her role is really thankless, and she is so very talented.The action sequences are great here, but obviously censored.  The film's original rating was R, at least that's what I had gathered at the time of release, and that significant cuts where made (especially in that already steamy love scene) and I'm sure those cuts inched there way over into some of the violent sequences.  That said, it's not anything too drastic for enjoyment.  The fight/love scene in particular is so breathtakingly done that it is the immediate highlight of the film.  Not that I'm an advocate for spousal abuse (lord knows I'm the farthest thing from) but that particular scene looks like a lot of fun.  Anyways, moving on, the film is entertaining in just about every respect and is more than just a celebrity gossip piece.  So what if this spawned the most widely talked about Hollywood romance in the history of Hollywood romances, that's the furthest thing from the point.  When the dust settles and the paparazzi get their pictures (and those crazy fans get their hugs) we're left with an entertaining, enjoyable and crowd pleasing good time, and that my friends is exactly what we're looking for.",4,"A lot of fun indeed, proves that not every celebrity couple produces a `Gigli'...",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,4077,"['fact', 'movie', 'received', 'more', 'attention', 'due', 'stars', 'off-screen', 'relationship', 'most', 'likely', 'destroyed', 'box-office', 'really', 'denying', 'on-screen', 'two', 'are', 'impeccable', 'together', 'Honestly', 'watching', 'together', 'so', 'natural', 'pleasant', 'home', 'life', 'anything', 'film', 'life', 'then', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', ""'re"", 'together', 'interact', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'together', 'so', 'naturally', 'beautifully', 'acting', 'altogether', 'really', 'biggest', 'draw', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'one', 'cases', 'where', 'actors', 'really', 'elevate', 'body', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'detractors', 'overall', 'such', 'fun', 'film', 'faults', 'are', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'radiant', 'then', 'film', ""'m"", 'telling', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Comedy/Musical', 'Actress', 'snub', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'charming', 'may', 'disagree', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'statement', 'time', 'being', 'coupled', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'serving', 'up', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'performances', 'get', 'well', 'rounded', 'good', 'time.So', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'believable', 'first', 'scene', 'arguing', 'calmly', 'marriage', 'councilor', 'sense', 'are', 'bored', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'years', 'lives', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'routine', 'so', 'predictable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'What', 'realize', 'lives', 'are', 'furthest', 'things', 'routine', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'fact', 'John', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'are', 'working', 'conflicting', 'agencies', 'when', 'are', 'hired', 'assassinate', 'same', 'target', 'end', 'up', 'confronted', 'truth', 'other', 'marriage', 'heat', 'up', 'are', 'instructed', 'take', 'other', 'out.The', 'film', 'major', 'detractor', 'running', 'length', 'only', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'genre', 'can', 'seem', 'drag', 'bit', 'know', 'odd', 'action', 'films', 'comedies', 'are', 'generally', 'shorter', 'dramas', 'biopics', 'time', 'get', 'final', 'stretch', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'may', 'feel', 'bit', 'worn', 'only', 'mere', 'few', 'minutes', 'away', 'credits', 'so', 'hold', 'there', 'minor', 'complaint', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'times', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'what', 'film', ""n't"", 'days', 'acting', 'said', 'really', 'up', 'issues', 'film', 'Aside', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'just', 'hysterical', 'here', 'John', 'best', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'spot', 'Benjamin', 'Danz', 'kid', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'letting', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'role', 'really', 'thankless', 'so', 'very', 'talented.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'great', 'here', 'obviously', 'censored', 'film', 'original', 'rating', 'was', 'R', 'least', 'what', 'had', 'gathered', 'time', 'release', 'significant', 'cuts', 'where', 'made', 'especially', 'already', 'steamy', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'cuts', 'inched', 'way', 'violent', 'sequences', 'said', 'not', 'anything', 'too', 'drastic', 'enjoyment', 'fight/love', 'scene', 'particular', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'done', 'immediate', 'highlight', 'film', 'Not', ""'m"", 'advocate', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'lord', ""'m"", 'farthest', 'thing', 'particular', 'scene', 'lot', 'fun', 'Anyways', 'moving', 'film', 'entertaining', 'just', 'respect', 'more', 'just', 'celebrity', 'gossip', 'piece', 'So', 'what', 'spawned', 'most', 'widely', 'talked', 'Hollywood', 'romance', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'furthest', 'thing', 'point', 'When', 'dust', 'settles', 'paparazzi', 'get', 'pictures', 'crazy', 'fans', 'get', 'hugs', ""'re"", 'left', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'good', 'time', 'friends', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking']",N/A

It has action, sexy scenes but done with class and not for just the sake of having it there.  The chemistry between Pit and Angela is fantastic.  It is a serious movie, but has humor in almost every single scene. There is one scene where they are both in a van trying to escape and they are angry with each other and she is just going nuts on Pitt while driving and on a highway!  It was serious but amazingly funny at the same time. They are both contract killers but they don't that each of them do that for a living. So through a lot of the movie they don't know and it makes for a very interesting romance and interaction between the two right up until the point where they find out.  In a weird way why they are going crazy when  they find out, it is like a psycho courtship for the two all over again. Then they accept who they really are and then they become a team because who they work for forbid people to get married while doing this as a career. If you don't mind action films, sexy scenes but you don't see actually see anything, and a little bad language, you will love this film. Now, I am not a big fan of either Brad Pit or Angela but I purchased this film and have watched it countless times. It is a great film to watch with your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife.  It was a very refreshing film in that it has been a while since I have seen a film where there was such chemistry like this. The humor is so different, which we have to give credit to the writers for this. Absolutely a 5 star for the writing and even better the way the actors lift that writing to even bigger heights.  For me, there is now way you cant love this film if you like some of the things I have listed. And if you are a fan of either of these actors, then you are doing yourself an injustice by not giving this a try. I believe anyone who rents this, most will buy it.  I happened to rent it on Amazon just because I was bored one day. What a huge surprise for me!!  The movie is not rushed, it moves at a regular pace then picks up speed and before you know it, they have the pace flying to the point you are at the edge of your seat but again, they maintain humor throughout and it is not a comedy but they are able to just place that sarcastic humor in there and both actors just bring it home in a big way. I cant think of one thing I did not love about this film. It is cheap to rent and I say give it a try. You will love it. I wish they had a part 2 to this movie but how they would ever top the first one is beyond me.  So for the action, fight scenes, car chases, all the while they are juggling a relationship and trying to find out who each of them are and if they really are in love with each other. But it is not like the &#34;Notebook&#34; type of love story here. This is a fun, fast, action packed film in which both Pit and Angela do their best work.

930120,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000AP04EW,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[3, 3]","To start, I have to say I'm not much of a fan of either Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. The only Pitt movies I liked were ""Fight Club"" and, because I'm a nerd for ancient history and mythology, Troy. Angelina is, on the other hand, notoriously bad at finding good movies to act in. The only movie I like, and this is self-explanatory, is Taking Lives. So, needless to say, I was skeptical of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This was not even a purchase I made, but one of a family members. If not for Christmas, I wouldn't have touched this movie.Well, thank you Santa. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a surprisingly funny and action-packed movie. The movie never goes out of its way to force laughs, but kind of just lets it happen through implication and dry humor. The action itself, though it's very difficult to make an action movie in today's saturated market, is done with freshness, with car-chases and gun-fights and explosions galore. Nowhere is the action and comedy better than when Pitt and Jolie are together. It makes for some classic stuff.The story, if you don't already know, is of a married couple who are assassins-for-hire, though neither know that about each other in the beginning. They go about acting as a regular married couple, what with perfectly timed dinners, gettogethers with other couples, and those suburban vehicles. But on those occasions when a job comes, they are as proficient as killers could be, and go about their job professionally and with enough time to get back for dinner. Things twist, however, when they finally discover each others secret, and they must eliminate each other or else suffer elimination themselves.Like I said before, I'm not fond of either actor, but I am convinced that this movie couldn't have been done without these two. Pitt plays that same cool character he does in most of his movies, but it works here with the comedy as it kind of balances him out, makes him a bit more real. Angelina plays the tough-chick like no other high-powered actress (if you don't believe, try picturing Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, or Renee Zellweger in her spot).If you liked True Lies, this is a movie for you. If you like solid action (like what's in Desperado or Kill Bill), then I'd also recommend this movie for you. Also, if you are fans of Pitt or Jolie, as I'm slowly becoming, then go with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, because it is one of the finest movies, I think, either of them played a part in.",4,All Around Good,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,2435,"['start', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'only', 'Pitt', 'movies', 'liked', 'were', 'Fight', 'Club', ""'m"", 'nerd', 'ancient', 'history', 'mythology', 'Troy', 'Angelina', 'other', 'hand', 'notoriously', 'bad', 'finding', 'good', 'movies', 'act', 'only', 'movie', 'like', 'self-explanatory', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'purchase', 'made', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'not', 'Christmas', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'touched', 'movie.Well', 'thank', 'Santa', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'action-packed', 'movie', 'movie', 'never', 'way', 'force', 'laughs', 'kind', 'just', 'lets', 'happen', 'implication', 'dry', 'humor', 'action', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'action', 'movie', 'today', 'saturated', 'market', 'done', 'freshness', 'car-chases', 'gun-fights', 'explosions', 'galore', 'Nowhere', 'action', 'comedy', 'better', 'when', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'are', 'together', 'classic', 'stuff.The', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'assassins-for-hire', 'know', 'other', 'beginning', 'go', 'about', 'acting', 'regular', 'married', 'couple', 'what', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'dinners', 'gettogethers', 'other', 'couples', 'suburban', 'vehicles', 'occasions', 'when', 'job', 'are', 'as', 'proficient', 'killers', 'could', 'be', 'go', 'job', 'professionally', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'dinner', 'Things', 'twist', 'however', 'when', 'finally', 'discover', 'others', 'secret', 'must', 'eliminate', 'other', 'else', 'suffer', 'elimination', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'actor', 'am', 'convinced', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'two', 'Pitt', 'same', 'cool', 'character', 'most', 'movies', 'here', 'comedy', 'kind', 'balances', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'real', 'Angelina', 'tough-chick', 'other', 'high-powered', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'try', 'picturing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'spot', '.If', 'liked', 'True', 'Lies', 'movie', 'like', 'solid', 'action', 'what', 'Desperado', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'then', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Also', 'are', 'fans', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', ""'m"", 'slowly', 'becoming', 'then', 'go', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'think', 'played', 'part']",N/A

930126,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000AP04EW,A. Schneider,"[24, 38]","Well I wasn't expecting too much when I went to go see Mr. & Mrs. Smith at a friend's house, after all it features two decent actors, one of which (Brad Pitt) who has been in really bad films as of late. To top it off, putting the words ""spy"" and ""comedy"" together, at the most I was hoping for was a laugh or two and a lot of action.Unfortunately this film doesn't even deliver the small amount of goods necessary to make it a decent action picture.As reviewers have mentioned before the sound on the DVD is atrocious, in fact it's so bad that I can understand if people got up and left in the middle of the theater. My friend has a decent sound system hooked up to his DVD player and television and still we were straining to hear it. The problem with the audio doesn't end there though; the dialogue itself is what you'd expect from a modern day spy comedy... just downright idiotic. Based on the dialogue alone the movie was obviously made simply to give nods to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.Well so the film is just one of those actor-fan-flock type movies, how about the actual story? It wasn't terrible it could have been presented much better though. You have two assassins that are married that are under the assumption that their spouse has a relatively normal job. The problem occurs when we're given silly scenarios such as Angelina Jolie coming home and changing from a dominatrix outfit beside Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt seemingly not noticing simply because he's a few feet away. Doesn't he know she owns that kind of clothing? Are we to take it for granted that he questions her loyalty in the relationship merely because they are seeing a marriage councilor?I suppose if you like Mr. No Personality Brad Pitt then you won't mind his character, who like him has absolutely no personality (I don't mean to disrespect Brad Pitt entirely, he's been in some wonderful films but as of late he seems to be developing amnesia because he keeps forgetting that his characters should have /some/ personality). As for Angelina Jolie? Absolutely stunning as always, flashing smiles, big round lips... well, that's exactly what you got here, no other character personality traits can be described because there are none to mention!I suppose in the end what matters is whether or not this comedy delivers both from as a decent action film as well as a comedy. The cinematographers and artistic designers must have been hard at work, because admittedly the sets were very pretty (and that's all that could be said about them), but that alone doesn't carry a movie - the action sequences were absurd, too fast, without justification, and probably required no more than half a second worth of movement on the part of the actors.The comedy in the movie is what got me really upset though... what exactly was so enjoyable about anything the characters did or said? The fact that Angelina has her weapons inside the kitchen sink, is that supposed to be laugh-out-loud-funny? Is it funny that she is whipping a masochist, playing the S&M; bit while trying to obtain information from him right before she assassinates him? That isn't the least bit humorous to me. The lines in this movie are not witty, cute, or funny... at the very least they are insulting to the average intelligent viewer. I read one reviewer describe how they feel that two assassins attending a marriage councilor was, in and of itself, a real ""hoot,"" no offense but that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.Many more reviewers state that this movie at least had a lot of ""sexual"" undertones, and was a ""sexy"" movie in the way the characters acted and the way it was presented. If you find Angelina Jolie wearing sexy clothing to be sexy, as many people do, then you'll undoubtedly find this movie ""sexy."" If like me you think ""sexy"" in a movie refers to an intellectual sort of lustily appeal, than you will no doubt find these comments to be ridiculous, maybe in the 70s and 60s they were stylish and sexy but in a movie like this they just come across as pathetic.Of course this review is going to generate a lot of ""Not Helpful"" remarks simply because people disagree with me, not because they actually find my opinion helpful or not (a common practice on Amazon when you disagree with someone, silence out the opposition).

While the former relied upon outrageous behavior and very good dialogue and the later on action and explosions, Mr. and Mrs. Smith relies more on over-the top violence.

But the tabloid fodder that this pairing created, along with Jennifer Aniston, will forever be linked to this film, casting a shadow over it. I know some people who refuse to even see this movie because of what happened. I'm not saying you should see this movie, even though I liked it, but you should see it for yourself instead of letting outside forces rule your choices. As far as simple mindled summer/popcorn films go, this one is actually pretty good. It's definitley not great, but it's not bad. It could of been a lot better and they definitley could of taken it a lot further. What I wasn't expecting from the film was the humor. I just didn't think of it being there. But it was and it was nice to have. Kind of a ""Lethal Weapon"" funny, but not as much. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as husband and wife. John and Jane Smith. Can it get any more blander and average?. Both seem to be living the normal upscale suburban life with both of them having careers. What neither of them know is that both are top assassins, and when they leave for work in the morning, they are killing people and blowing things up. Things get a little nasty when both of their agencies find out about their marriage and decide that it's not good image-wise, and set up a plan for the two to take each other out. The duo find out and start battling, until they realize they really love each other and team up to stay alive. The premise of the movie is pretty fun and it definitley has potential for a lot of great set up. Fortunatley, some of that potential is here. Unfortunatley, it's not enough. The movie moves along pretty quickly and once things really kick in, there is not a real dull moment. But the movie is not as big and explosive and memorable as it wants, or should, be. The direction is pretty slick though and well done, and our two stars are game. I haven't seen a lot of Brad Pitt films, but he fits real well into his role. Jolie is a little more cold. However, she is incredibly sexy here. Vince Vaughan has a small suppoting role as a friend/co-worker of Pitt's, and Adam Brody from ""The O.C."" puts in a small side role as well.

Anyone who is married has gone through ups and downs in their relationship - and everyone knows marriage can be dull at times.  Angelina and Brad get far more spice than they bargain for when it's revealed that they're both assassins hired to kill each other.The dialogue is reminiscent of the old school detective movies, quick and layered with double meanings.  Both leads are sleek, with sexiness oozing from their pores (as if anyone doesn't know this).  Their house (the primary set) is full of ""Jetson"" type gadgets and enough weapons to wage a war, yet remained comfortable and tasteful (a humorous combination).I was impressed with the stunts and car chases; however the shoot outs got to be a bit much at times.  The knock down, drag out fight between the leads is comic brilliance - they really don't hold back and the result is well, as you can imagine, better than make up sex.Vince Vaughn is memorable as an assassin living with his mother.  He delivers his one liners with comic ease and leaves the rest of the cast members in his wake.I'm sure if I wanted to probe, I'd find a few plot holes, but who would want to go and ruin such a perfect cheese.

930142,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000AP04EW,Boss Fan,"[1, 6]","I avoided this movie in theatres because of all the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jollie tabloid crap.  I saw them on five different magazines every day, and every week a new one with similar picture on each cover, so I had no desire to shell out 9 bucks to see them smirk at one another for two hours.  These are two ""actors"" I never much respected anyway.Plus the movie looked really dumb.But removed from all that sickness, after checking it out at home a few months later, I would never call it a great movie and technically, yep, its pretty dumb, but it has moments and I have to admit the stars are likeable in spite of their constant public over-saturation.He's a spy/killer, she's a spy/killer, and they are married, but he doesn't know what she does and she doesn't know what he does (riiiiight), but 5 years into their marriage, one day they put two and two together (the same day, at the same time.... after 5 years - again, riiiiight) and on this day so do the different contacting agencies they work for.  So now they have to kill each other, or get taken out by their respective employers.(It took the geniuses in intelligence at those firms five years to figure out they were married?  You'd think you'd know all there is to know about your super-spy employees before you entrust them with government secrets or worse; and what's with them all suddenly getting a clue at the same time?)At first they are content to kill each other (each had been treating the marriage as a cover story so no real feeling should exist) and this results in some humorous banter and husband on wife and vise-versa beatings (if that's your bag), but wouldn't ya know they actually do love each other (an epiphany that is awakened after beating the crap out of each other turns them on so much that they stop fighting long enough to screw on shards of broken glass) and soon it's them against their agencies.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!But true to form those geniuses are pretty easy to beat.  At least that's what the abrupt ending that doesn't explain anything leads us to believe.  So they wiped out the baddies that were after them that night.  Wouldn't they send more the next day?  In the last scene the couple says all is well and they redid the house they blew to sh*t earlier.  So they are living in the same place?  Why wouldn't someone just blow there house up again?I'll do it!So, yeah, it's that kind of movie.  But I did smile a lot.  The premise, dumb, no scratch that, absolutely impossible as it - I mean this isn't like, 'oh, he couldn't get shot that many times and survive,' or 'he wouldn't survive that fall' - I mean none of this would ever, ever happen - still makes way for lots of clever gags.  Imagine if your significant other was this person and so were you.  The movie plays that to the hilt and is better for it.  If you're going to stray this far from reality and still expect us to care about the characters then you better go for broke and make sure you play every other angle and possibility up as much as you can.  For the most part, this movie takes full advantage.  I liked how they both had guns and bombs hidden all over the house, in places the other doesn't go and when they are fighting against one another, I liked their banter and the way they knew how to get to one another, whether it be because of their training or because they are husband and wife; often the two reasons are one in the same.  And when they join forces there is the predictable power struggle.  There is a scene where they compare body counts the way couples compare their number of sex partners.  And the scenes with their shrink that bookend the film and set the jokey tone are funny.Most importantly and most surprisingly the two leads are solid and likeable and that goes a long way in a dumb movie like this.  If we can't buy them and we sure as hell can't buy this premise, then we can't by the movie.  Their characters are a little clich&eacute;d and under-developed.  She is the by-the-book, team player who is good at throwing knives, while He is the somewhat goofy frat-guy who, judging by the evidence submitted, enjoys kicking people and hitting them with objects he finds around the room.  Hey, one more caricature and they'd be Charlie's Angels!There is Vince Vaughn, but he is underused and doesn't appear much in a kick-ass mood.Though the movie explores and exploits most of the possible fun scenarios to come out of a situation like this, I would argue the action sequences come up far shorter.  There are really only three, one is a car chase that is not staged with any real zest or originality and is completely sunk by the two leads' constant sarcastic addressing of each other as ""dear,"" or ""honey"" before giving an instruction or ribbing one another.  We get it, you're a married couple and you are shooting at people!  Shut up and shoot!Blame the director.  I know the guy did ""The Bourne Identity,"" and that was generaly well-received, but here he has no style and his attempts at it range from shaky camera work when it is not needed (like early scenes with Brangelina in a hotel room) to slow-mo editing and camera twirls as in the generic shoot-out finale.  All the actions scenes are pretty generic.  The car chase I mentioned pales in comparison to not only great film chase sequences, but doesn't have the excitment and inovativeness, or the hard edge of, say freeway chase in ""Lethal Weapon 4"" or even the hot, flashy cars and big pile-ups of crash-wizard Michael Bay's ""Bad Boys II"" (or any of his films for that matter).  There is just nothing special, unique or exciting going for any of the action in this movie.  It's a shame it didn't try harder.  Those two titles (and many others) are proof you can be a ""dumb action comedy"" and still blow audiences away.So zero logic and poor direction sink its chances of being much more than a guilty pleasure.  But thanks to the charismatic leads and some clever bafoonery, it is a pleasure all the same.",3,"VERY DUMB AND COULD HAVE USED BETTER DIRECTION, YET...",1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,5972,"['avoided',

And I'll tell you why:When this was released, a lot of drama appeared in the tabloids regarding Brad and Angelina's then illicit affair. Many cynics (including myself) knew this was a cheap move on both actors' parts to promote a movie they felt insecure about letting stand on its own virtues.Srangely enough, they didn't have anything to worry about, although I suspect nobody (actors, producers, marketing people, director) knew any better, except for perhaps the script-writers.Many critics were distracted by the press storm Brangelina generated, and let that taint their opinion of this movie. And of course it drew the gossip-mongers and celebrity-worshippers among us to this movie in generous numbers.What they found (and what you'll find, once you ignore the hype) is a well-thought out movie about couples therapy!The clever writers of this movie managed to work into the plot an entire cycle of rebuilding the trust in a relationship back from nothing. Every requisite action sequence, sex scene, and conversation fits nicely within the context of an estranged married couple taking steps toward reconciliation.For all the hype and unfortunatly unimaginative branding of this movie (suffering from luddite marketing, like ""Mean Girls"" only worse) this is a highly entertaining movie about the not-so-happy subject of repairing a relationship.For this reason, I strongly recommend this one as a good choice for both male and female audiences, particularly married ones.

930149,A18Z33BM3GZE9R,B000AP04EW,"Carl Cannella ""alec_of_kerry419""","[146, 154]","Many people have been ripping this release apart without so much as a glance at the product itself. While the DVD may fall short of other recent Collector's Edition DVDs, such as the Alien films, this is a superb presentation, with some genuinely interesting Special Features.What has sparked the most debate about this release is easily the ""Unrated"" cut itself. The film is largely the same, running only 6 minutes longer than the original cut. The added scenes are interesting - additional dialogue with the counsellor in the opening, a few extra dialogue sequences between Pitt and Jolie before they learn each others identities, and a handful of alternate takes for certain sequences. Perhaps the most notable - and  most controversial - is the extended love scene halfway through the film. The scene is very steamy, but those expecting excessive raunch or skin from the gorgeous stars will be disappointed. This is a love scene, not a sex scene, and there is only the tiniest hint of skin from both actors, with Pitt (or Pitt's body double, as the shot in question is from the neck down) showing the most.And far the the SPECIAL FEATURES go, the disc is very careful not to double-dip. It includes: (1) Deleted Scenes, including an alternate ending. None of the deleted scenes are repeated from the original reelase, and many are well worth a watch. (2) A feature-length commentary from director Doug Limon that, while informative, offers little insight not mentioned in the original release's commentaries. (3) Doug's Film School. This section is essentially a breakdown of abandonded concept and sequences that never made it on film. Of note is a lengthy alternate version of the Desert sequence, located at a snowy mountaintop and ending in a hand-to-hand battle between a masked Pitt and Jolie, as well as several animatics for various sequnces throughout the films. Also of note is the inclusion of the deleted ""villain"" sequences mentioned of the commentary of the first release's commentary. (4)Confidential Files. This is actually where the deleted scenes are located. Also included in the ""file"" is a 4-minute gag reel, and a hidden Easter Egg (another deleted scene). (5) Behind the scenes documentary. This 30-minutes featurette offers more insight than that of the original release, as well as a significat amount of B-Roll footage from several of the film's major set piees, including the in-house battle and the desert scene.

Chow,"[0, 5]","I hate to say it but `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' was entertaining, to a point.The sheer fact that anything involving Brad Pitt or and Angelina Jolie could be remotely watchable is in itself a great achievement. I cannot think of a couple on earth I hate more. OK maybe Benifer.With decent editing, lighting and cameras which stay in focus, `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' far surpasses most films of the year.Although the actors are pathetic, the plot is intriguing. Married assassins target each other. The first 30 minutes are a poorly edited hodgepodge of flashbacks intended to set the premise of a yuppie couple each working as assassins without the other one knowing, but which leave us totally confused. If not for the trailer's synopsis we would have no idea what the hell is going on.The plot does start to take off when Pitt and Jolie's rival agencies target each other. This provides us with an amusing and exciting series of scenes with the two arguing while trying to blow each up via, RPGs, machine pistols, and vehicle chases.Ultimately Pitt and Jolie Team up to take a stand against their shadow agencies. Nothing is explained as to why these intelligence franchises which put 007's Royal Navy and CTU to shame would go to such extremes to assassinate their own agents and then simply give up allowing them to live normal lives. But by the end we are not expecting too much. In fact nothing is explained as to who or what these agencies are. The only other employees we see are Vince Vaughn for some comic relief and a brief voice cameo by Keith David.Why it worked: Well I guess you have to be a 2nd Amendment nut like me to appreciate Jolie using a pump shotgun, MP5K, and an M4 Carbine all at once to kill her husband. There are some impressive action scenes with some impressive weapons. They really like HKs. Although 9mm are out of date. The final action sequence involves the two using Glock 18s with custom nickel slides. The same kind on `24's season finale.In conclusion, the movie is fun to a point if even a Pitt Jolie hater like me could stand them anyone can.",3,A Guilty Pleasure,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2067,"['hate', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'was', 'entertaining', 'point.The', 'sheer', 'fact', 'anything', 'involving', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'could', 'be', 'remotely', 'watchable', 'great', 'achievement', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'couple', 'earth', 'hate', 'more', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Benifer.With', 'decent', 'editing', 'lighting', 'cameras', 'stay', 'focus', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'far', 'most', 'films', 'year.Although', 'actors', 'are', 'pathetic', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'Married', 'target', 'other', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'poorly', 'edited', 'hodgepodge', 'flashbacks', 'intended', 'set', 'premise', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'working', 'assassins', 'other', 'one', 'knowing', 'leave', 'totally', 'confused', 'not', 'trailer', 'synopsis', 'would', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'on.The', 'plot', 'start', 'take', 'off', 'when', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'rival', 'agencies', 'target', 'other', 'amusing', 'exciting', 'series', 'scenes', 'two', 'arguing', 'trying', 'blow', 'RPGs', 'machine', 'pistols', 'vehicle', 'chases.Ultimately', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'Team', 'up', 'take', 'stand', 'shadow', 'agencies', 'Nothing', 'explained', 'why', 'intelligence', 'franchises', 'put', '007', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'CTU', 'shame', 'would', 'go', 'such', 'extremes', 'assassinate', 'own', 'agents', 'then', 'simply', 'give', 'up', 'allowing', 'live', 'normal', 'lives', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'nothing', 'explained', 'who', 'what', 'agencies', 'are', 'only', 'other', 'employees', 'see', 'are', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'comic', 'relief', 'brief', 'voice', 'cameo', 'Keith', 'David.Why', 'worked', 'Well', 'guess', 'have', 'be', '2nd', 'Amendment', 'nut', 'appreciate', 'Jolie', 'using', 'pump', 'shotgun', 'MP5K', 'M4', 'Carbine', 'once', 'kill', 'husband', 'are', 'impressive', 'action', 'scenes', 'impressive', 'weapons', 'really', 'HKs', '9mm', 'are', 'date', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'two', 'using', 'Glock', '18s', 'custom', 'nickel', 'slides', 'same', 'kind', '24', 'season', 'finale.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'fun', 'point', 'even', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'hater', 'could', 'stand', 'anyone', 'can']",N/A

930160,A3IY28PW12MSVN,B000AP04EW,Christine Wong,"[4, 7]","I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was - very much so. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, ""I missed you."" She replies, matter-of-factly, ""I missed you, too."" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie.Despite its flaws, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but worth a rental, at least. 4/5.",4,entertaining - great chemistry between the leads; funny one-liners; best when it tends more toward comedy than action,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,3070,"['went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'entertained', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'very', 'well', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'ridiculously', 'good-looking', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'film', 'John', 'Pitt', 'Jane', 'Jolie', 'Smith', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'apparently', 'magic', 'gone', 'marriage', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'truthfully', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'skilled', 'assassins', 'when', 'are', 'hired', 'do', 'hit', 'other', 'truth', 'unravels', 'plot', 'rather', 'brainless', 'realized', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.The', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'successful', 'second', 'part', 'mainly', 'fun', 'watch', 'Smiths', 'not', 'realize', 'truth', 'other', 'then', 'dance', 'eggshells', 'other', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'truth', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'filled', 'great', 'one-liners', 'double', 'entendres', 'Take', 'example', 'when', 'John', 'Jane', 'return', 'home', 'dinner', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'John', 'response', 'Jane', 'question', 'why', 'returned', 'early', 'so-called', 'business', 'trip', 'missed', 'matter-of-factly', 'missed', 'too', 'movie', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'most', 'laughs', 'come', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'generic', 'couple', 'stuff', 'seeing', 'counselor', 'eating', 'dinner', 'home', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'etc.', 'Mr', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'mostly', 'chemistry', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'have', 'spades', 'sex', 'appeal', 'literally', 'screen', 'wish', 'film', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'laboring', 'couple-stuff', 'do', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'explosions', 'action', 'Jolie', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'more', 'hypnotically', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'why', 'Pitt', 'character', 'almost', 'instantly', 'also', 'thought', 'Jolie', 'was', 'great', 'making', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'quiet', 'poignancy', 'role', 'John', 'Smith', 'Pitt', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'excellent', 'best', 'lines', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'lines', 'would', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'corny', 'Pitt', 'character', 'believable', 'extremely', 'likable', 'supporting', 'characters', 'played', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'seem', 'bit', 'wasted', 'Brad', 'Angelina', 'show.My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'excessive', 'often', 'plodding', 'action', 'scenes', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'look', 'sexy', 'doing', 'cool', 'stunts', 'tiring', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'primary', 'reason', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'witty', 'entertaining', 'earlier', 'moments', 'film', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'were', 'less', 'physical', 'explosions', 'mindless', 'action', 'more', 'explosive', 'chemistry', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'Pitt', 'Jolie.Despite', 'flaws', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'wonderful', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'theatre', 'Not', 'movie', 'anyone', 'demanding', 'real', 'plot', 'serious', 'depth', 'rental', 'least', '4/5']",N/A

930164,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B000AP04EW,Classic Movie watcher,"[1, 2]","This is a highly entertaining movie - the 2 hours at the cinema just flew away. On the movie, Brad Pitt and Anglina Jolie looked cool, intelligent and made for each other. The music score was as exciting as the action quickenened the heartbeat. The director(Bourne Identity) succeeded to maintain the pace and tension throughout the movie. He was clever to make full use of Angelina's strengths - determined look and physical prowess built in Lara Croft movies. Brad Pitt had excellent lines and a big heart.What makes this movie better than other summer blockbusters is the focus on the romance part and the attention to fine details in the script - well-written dialogues, timely gags, looks exchanged. There is chemistry between Brad and Angelina.The best scene was when Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both professional killers for different companies, were at the dinner table figuring out whether the other one was the rival player and how much the other knew already. At the same time, they were wary of all sorts of potential dangers - sharp words, knives, poison, guns, car chase etc.  Watch for the crucial moment when Brad Pitt gave a final test to Angelina and she fell for it. From then on, they were at each other's throat and their relationship changed drastically - only for the better as their love for each other was rekindled.Differences between men and women were implicated in the movie. Consider how Mr. and Mrs. Smith work, Jane's sorority vs John's pair, how Jane outsmarted John in the search of the house. Not to mention the head count between Jane and John. The marriage counsel meeting at the beginning and at the end of the movie was a delightful twist.A movie with excellent lines, laughs and action.

930167,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000AP04EW,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Despite being a fun and sexy romp, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will probably go down in history as the film that made Brad Pitt go from Jennifer Aniston to Angelina Jolie. Like a lot of films, the press behind it seemed to interest more people than the actual film itself, although it did a good number at the box office. While it's a bit problematic, this film wasn't designed to get your kleenex going or your mind working; it just wants to have fun and fun it has. This is the unrated edition so there's more stuff put in (or in some cases, taken out) but by and large, it's still the same rollickingly fun movie.While in Columbia, John and Jane meet and soon a relationship blossoms and they get married. But despite being insanely attractive, they don't really get along but seeing as how they're both hired assassins for separate agencies with none the wiser about the other's ""real"" profession, it's a good thing. But soon they find out and want to kill each other until there's a hit put out on the 2 of them so they have to team up and survive together and maybe even fall in love, and for real this time.Whether the meeting of the co-stars did result in the breakup of a marriage, you have to admit these 2 have huge time chemistry on-screen; so much so that the idea that their sex life is on the fritz seems almost laughable. It's also good that their acting is up to snuff and while they don't feel like completely realized characters, they more than pull it off. There's also some roles by always likable Adam Brody and scene-stealer Vince Vaughn.The action scenes are the highlight although they're none too inventive (although, the use of the dual sliding doors on SUV's was funny) but that's what we came to see: people getting shot at in MTV-style moves. My one complaint is that certain plot elements seem dropped, like the writer didn't want to write TOO much for the movie so he just wrote the bare minimum, even if certain things don't even get explained. But then again, this is a movie meant to be a blockbuster ""good times had by all"" kind of movie so it's kind of hard to complain when that was the point, no?It might not be the best action movie of that year or any year but if you ever pick it up, you might just enjoy yourself which is the whole point.",4,Ain't marriage grand?,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,2272,"['being', 'fun', 'sexy', 'romp', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'film', 'made', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'go', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'lot', 'films', 'press', 'seemed', 'interest', 'more', 'people', 'actual', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'number', 'box', 'office', 'bit', 'problematic', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'designed', 'get', 'kleenex', 'going', 'mind', 'working', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'fun', 'unrated', 'edition', 'more', 'stuff', 'put', 'cases', 'taken', 'out', 'large', 'still', 'same', 'rollickingly', 'fun', 'movie.While', 'Columbia', 'John', 'Jane', 'meet', 'soon', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'get', 'married', 'being', 'insanely', 'attractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'along', 'seeing', 'how', ""'re"", 'hired', 'assassins', 'separate', 'agencies', 'none', 'wiser', 'other', 'real', 'profession', 'good', 'thing', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'want', 'kill', 'other', 'hit', 'put', 'out', '2', 'have', 'team', 'up', 'survive', 'together', 'maybe', 'even', 'fall', 'love', 'real', 'meeting', 'co-stars', 'did', 'result', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'have', 'admit', '2', 'have', 'huge', 'time', 'chemistry', 'on-screen', 'so', 'much', 'idea', 'sex', 'life', 'fritz', 'almost', 'laughable', 'also', 'good', 'acting', 'up', 'snuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'completely', 'realized', 'characters', 'more', 'pull', 'off', 'also', 'roles', 'always', 'likable', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'scene-stealer', 'Vince', 'Vaughn.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'highlight', ""'re"", 'none', 'too', 'inventive', 'use', 'dual', 'sliding', 'doors', 'SUV', 'was', 'funny', 'what', 'came', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'MTV-style', 'moves', 'one', 'complaint', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'seem', 'dropped', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'TOO', 'much', 'movie', 'just', 'wrote', 'bare', 'minimum', 'even', 'certain', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'explained', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'good', 'times', 'had', 'kind', 'movie', 'kind', 'hard', 'complain', 'when', 'was', 'point', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'action', 'movie', 'year', 'year', 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'might', 'just', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'point']",N/A

930174,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000AP04EW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","If you can get through the rather tedious first half hour or so, Mr. and Mrs. Smith finds its legs and makes for plenty of entertaining action and adventure.  That first half hour can be pretty rough, though, as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really seem to sleepwalk through their roles.  Doubtlessly, this is due in no small part to the nature of their characters, two highly-ranked assassins going through the motions of a normal husband and wife in order to hide their real jobs from one another.  I think it goes deeper than the script, though.  Jolie has always gone all out for her characters, but for quite a while I just didn't think she put her heart into this particular role - ironic, given the fact that she and Pitt began their little love affair during filming.  I have to admit that the whole real-life romantic triangle thing dampened my enjoyment of the film, to a certain degree.  For me, there's a definite ick factor in watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, since in a sense you're watching a real-life adulterous affair play out right in front of your eyes.The plot is pretty basic and nothing we haven't seen before.  Girl meets boy, girl marries boy, girl and boy try to kill each other.  For the first six years of their marriage, John Smith (Pitt) and his lovely wife Jane (Jolie) are completely unaware that their partner is, like themselves, a high-level assassin.  How they go traipsing all over the world killing people and still manage to return in time for 7:00 dinner every night is just one of many questions the writer chose to blissfully ignore.  They really have little reason to suspect one another, though, because their suburban home lifestyle is exceedingly boring.  Whatever spark of romance they once shared, it's long gone by this point.  Everything changes, however, when they get in each other's way on separate missions centered on the same target.  Neither can afford to let the other blow his/her cover, so their respective agencies quickly pit them against one another.  Of course, things get a little more involved after that, but you can see where this whole thing is going.  Finally, once the Smiths stop being so painfully civil to one another, their characters finally begin to show signs of life.  Too many attempts to be funny during the heat of battle only reinforces the weakness of the entire script, however, leaving you unable to enjoy all of the mayhem and things that go boom as much as you think you should.  Sure, some of the dialogue is funny, but most of the time it just seems terribly contrived.With all of its explosions, big guns, and all-around violence, Mr. and Mrs. Smith should manage to satisfy those who just can't get enough movie mayhem, and Angelina Jolie - even though she's not at her best here - still makes any movie she's in worth watching.  Clearly, though, something is just missing here.  Thanks largely to a relatively weak script, Pitt and Jolie never really bring you in to their characters' world, which means you are never able to forget that you're watching a movie.  As a result, the film entertains but never really satisfies.

930175,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B000AP04EW,Danielle Turchiano,"[14, 18]","I'm utterly fascinated. ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" is on my Top Ten List; last summer I saw it three times in theaters and ran out and bought the DVD and the soundtrack immediately. Now I have two versions of the DVD, and it is well worth the $[...]I have spent over all (toilet paper when you consider the millions the production spent on elements that would never have seen the light of day but for the technological revolution that made special feature DVD so popular). I already loved the film, but I love it that much more now that I've seen what the production threw on the cutting room floor. They made GREAT choices: most of America-- fans, audiences, tabloids news shows, and critics included-- only focused on the casting choice of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (and by the way, the candid commentary on their work ethic and attitudes on set is awesome, as well). However, and this may be because I am a filmmaker, I think it only adds to the validity of final cut to see what they were working with: it's almost as if you have the Avid file in front of you, and you can see what's in the trash bin and what is still on the timeline.I was amazed to see how little control Doug Liman seemed to have with his own creativity going into filming the movie. There's always a struggle with the suits in the studio, I'm aware of that, but the extent to which their power trips will take it...and the amount of money they are willing to throw at their own ego rubs...is just insane! As a filmmaker myself (who unfortunately has shied away from directing in the past few years), to watch the battle of wits is really interesting: to see where a creative mind gives and takes and compromises (or in this case, just seems to placate: did you know the car scene was only considered ""optional"" by the studio suits?  sure, but by all means, we need to have two options for other fight sequences) really teaches you a lot.  I feel like I got more out of sitting on my couch today, eating Haagen Daz directly out of the gallon (you heard me correctly), staring at the television for three hours, than in all three years of college, paying forty grand to listen to some old white guy drone on and on about mise-en-scene.  Hell, we even got to see some of Doug's animated storyboards!The second disc of that DVD set is all special features, including a gag reel, an alternate ending, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and sessions with Doug, where he shows more deleted scenes and explains them. Now I understand how the script grew to 250 pages and why that translated into reshoots and the production team running out of film: he shot A LOT of crap he didn't use. ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" is a long movie as it is, but scenes were shot in multiple versions, and additional sequences (not moments, lines, or scenes, but full-on sequences: practically subplots) were shot, as well. The thing could have become an epic...or at least a miniseries if everything was used. For one thing, the characters of Mother and Father (which are in the film for all of nine seconds) were first shot with Jacqueline Bissett and Terence Stamp and then reshot with Keith David and Angela Bassett, and still none of the footage ended up in the final cut. Full scenes. Full LONG scenes. The desert scene was shot as both what you see in the film and as a snowy ravine sequence. The studio tried to convince Doug he needed voice over and created a complete B-plot with Adam Brody and Estella Warren in order to set him up as a central enough character to be accepted as that narrator, which wasn't used either. There were moments when dialogue (""okay so it's a crap marriage"") was reused and then turned into a brief monologue...and truth be told, I actually kind of liked those moments as individual clips because they made the allegory about marriage that much more in your face, but I understand-- as the DVD tries to show you-- why it wasn't necessary in the final cut.This DVD is worth buying even if you already have the film from it's first DVD release back in November; the second disc is worth the price alone. It's not a step-by-step script-to-screen of the film, but it's the closest thing I've seen on a DVD of extras. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, the sessions with Doug Liman will give you new perspective on what it takes to make it in this industry, and if you're just a fan of Brad and/or Angelina, you will get to see them in many, many new moments that may not be as color-corrected as the final cut of the film but still look amazing. And the alternate ending is adorable! Not right for the flow of the film, but I loved it anyway.  However, I am not saying this should be a replacement for the original DVD.  After all, the feature film version on this is not what was release in theatres originally, and the new ""unrated"" version changed some stuff I thought detracted from its greatness-- such as leaving out the first half of Adam Brody's material and leaving in some top lines that made the transitions less smooth and succienct.  Of course, what makes it unrated is that they left in the full sex scene, something which you cannot find as even a deleted scene on the original DVD.  And it's hot ;)",5,GREAT Choices,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,5180,"[""'m"", 'utterly', 'fascinated', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Smith', 'Top', 'Ten', 'List', 'last', 'summer', 'saw', 'three', 'times',

However, it's not quite that simple.  Jane (Jolie's character) thinks her husband John (Pitt's character), is in construction.  John is under the impression that he is married to a director of a Wall Street systems manager.  What they both don't know is that each is a professional assasin working for a rival firm.  They each take on a job to take out the same target, and the secret is revealed.This was a very interesting movie.  There is a ton of action.  Pitt and Jolie engage in fisticuffs and firefights, first with each other, and then with those sent to get them.  There is a great chase scene and some wonderful explosions.There is plenty of eye candy.  Pitt is suave and dashing in his tuxedo.  The guys get to drool over Jolie.  The onscreen chemistry between the two is quite good.Then there is the examination of marriage.  I thought this was well done.  The movie starts with John and Jane in a marriage counselor's office as they examine their relationship after five or six years of marriage (inside joke, watch the movie).  They both know there is something that is standing in the way of their relationship.  We, the viewers, know about their secret lives, but there is more than that.

Six years pass by and they never discover their respective identities.  Please, stop me when this sounds ridiculous.  Early on in this film I was rolling my eyes and searching for anything credible in this outlandish yarn to hang my proverbial hat on.  Alas, this is a Hollywood film through and through.  Big stars, big explosions, exciting ""Alias""-style getaways and fight scenes.  After about twenty minutes into this forced epilepsy it occurred to me to shut off my brain and just try to enjoy the film.  After that breakthrough decision, the film flowed by virtually unnoticed.  Well, I didn't hate the movie, but I have seen all of this generic filmmaking before.  However, the two lead actors (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) show tremendous chemistry and they somehow manage to keep this listing vessel afloat regardless of my many protestations.  Brad Pitt, in particular, shows as much charm and power and gravitas as any actor could with this type of overblown character.  Angelina Jolie has her moments, as well, but mostly she plays off of Brad Pitt and his scene-stealing gesticulations and playful looks.

While the lovely Angelina has removed her clothes in other films (see GIA), she sadly keeps them on all the way thru this one.As for the plot, what came to mind as I was watching this film was someone taking a round-trip from New York to L.A. just to pick up a gallon of milk.  That's how circuitous it seemed.  To say it is far-fetched would be a major understatement.Of course, the selling-point of this film is not the absurd plot but the entertainment value.  On that mark, this movie does just fine.  There is plenty to like about two professional assasins who just-so-happen to be married & how they go after each other.  Surprisingly, it makes for some very funny moments, albeit in a sadistic sort of way.The biggest point of this movie, however, are the two actors.  Just about every male not named Tom Cruise would love to be Brad Pitt.  And, just about every non-lesbian woman would love to be WITH Brad Pitt.  Likewise, just about every woman not named Catherine Zeta-Jones would love to be Angelina Jolie.  And, of course, she is the kind of woman who visits the dreams of men such as myself.  So, it is this idea of two ""perfect"" people being married & yet trying to kill each other that is a big draw.  The fact that this movie spurred on a real-live romance only adds to the intrigue.So, if you're a fan of action movies, action comedies,  Brad Pitt and / or Angelina Jolie, this movie is certainly worth a look.

It certainly helps that director Doug Liman (who did a superb job on the underrated ""Go"" in 1999) has cast two ludicrously attractive leads whose intertwining personal lives would eventually overshadow their onscreen shenanigans. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in the title roles, John and Jane Smith, and things start promisingly with Simon Kinberg's scattershot screenplay setting them up as typically upscale married suburbanites who both try to manage professional demands in light of a sagging marriage.As it turns out, they are both highly paid assassins who of course, are hired to rub the other out. This revelation is hardly surprising, but I didn't know it would signal a significant decrease in creativity for the rest of the film even as the fireworks get more explosive. The special effects and swift gunplay can be dazzling but are left on overkill mode, but by far, the worst scene is an overextended fight scene between the two that eschews its black comedy elements in favor of a commercial for domestic violence. But even this would be forgivable if Liman and Kinberg could figure out how to end the story. It seems to breathe on high-octane but strangely remains devoid of any real suspense and then abruptly stops with no real denouement.Pacing is a major problem with the movie as it feels like it goes on for far too long. Luckily, the stars have enough charisma to maintain some interest throughout. Both often lend a nice comic spark to their performances, though neither knows how to convey irony without an irritating wink-wink manner. As Eddie, Mr. Smith's cohort, Vince Vaughan seems to be the only one who seems completely adept at black comedy. Kerry Washington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague. Even though he shows off an impressive set of six-pack abs, Pitt seems particularly lost at times, but Jolie manages to dominate the pairing with her stunning beauty and take-no-prisoners attitude.

930209,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B000AP04EW,Godly Gadfly,"[2, 17]","Marriage is a beautiful and rich gift - when it works.  In the real world, because of fallen human nature, it's sometimes more about killing each other.  Usually it's just looks that kill and words that bite, but in this romantic action comedy film, the two main characters are real-life assassins who turn against each other in a very real bid to take each other out.Mr and Mrs John and Jane Smith (played by real life husband and wife Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) begin the film like many a married couple - on a couch, discussing their marital woes and observing how there seems to be so much distance between them.  The distance turns out to be far more than both of them could ever have imagined.  For over five years of marriage, they have both kept much of their real lives hidden from each other, including the fact that they are skilled assassins working for different companies.  It's while on assignment that they discover their true identities, but now they are commissioned to eliminate each other.  The first part of the film sets up this conflict, then moves into some stirring action sequences, with the highlight being a frenzied and violent battle between both protagonists in their home, until the very last moment when love triumphs over hate, and they lay down their guns and team up.  Then just when you thought the film was over, it switches gears, and the last part of the story sees them working together as a team against both their firms, who pull out all stops to terminate both of them.  The PG-13 rating is accounted for mostly by all the gunfire, bloodshed, explosions and the high body count needed to make this happen, as well as considerable sexual innuendo.For me the film just didn't work.  Marriage is intended to be a beautiful thing, and to see a married couple's strife escalate to the point where they are trying to kill each other was just painful to watch, even worse than watching  a train wreck.  Seeing the intense violence of a husband and wife kicking and punching and shooting each other in an all out effort to murder the other is not my idea of fun.  This wasn't helped by the fact that the film trivialized the conflict by taking on a comic tone, which minimized the very real  difficulties that some couples can experience in their relationships - and when it happens, it's no laughing matter.  The fact that the film was a comedy also didn't rescue the fact that the story-line was so unbelievable, particularly the critical and totally ridiculous point where the Smiths move from turning against each other to working together.  In real life, pulling out all stops to kill each other doesn't bring back the spark of love or inflame passion.  And it becomes just a bit too much to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief even further in the action sequences which follow, where our heroes take out a gazillion highly trained soldiers, while barely breaking into a sweat or getting a scratch.Rather than succeeding as a comedy, for me this film was a real tragedy, and epitomizes how Hollywood sometimes gives superficial treatment to very serious issues in the real world.  Even the `happy' ending doesn't make up for this.  Regrettably, for me the comic story of Mr & Mrs Smith just left me feeling disappointed.  There are many very real Mr & Mrs Smiths out there who experience the tragedy of this film in their marriages, and sadly it's no laughing matter. - GODLY GADFLY",2,It's no laughing matter when a married couple are out to murder each other,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,3429,"['Marriage', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'gift', 'when', 'real', 'world', 'fallen', 'human', 'nature', 'sometimes', 'more', 'killing', 'other', 'just', 'kill', 'words', 'bite', 'romantic', 'action', 'comedy', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'real-life', 'assassins', 'who', 'turn', 'other', 'very', 'real', 'bid', 'take', 'other', 'out.Mr', 'Mrs', 'John', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'begin', 'film', 'many', 'married', 'couple', 'couch', 'discussing', 'marital', 'woes', 'observing', 'how', 'there', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'distance', 'distance', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'five', 'years', 'marriage', 'have', 'kept', 'much', 'real', 'lives', 'hidden', 'other', 'including', 'fact', 'are', 'skilled', 'assassins', 'working', 'different', 'companies', 'assignment', 'discover', 'true', 'identities', 'now', 'are', 'commissioned', 'eliminate', 'other', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'up', 'conflict', 'then', 'stirring', 'action', 'sequences', 'highlight', 'being', 'frenzied', 'violent', 'battle', 'protagonists', 'home', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'when', 'love', 'triumphs', 'hate', 'lay', 'down', 'guns', 'team', 'up', 'Then', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'gears', 'last', 'part', 'story', 'working', 'together', 'team', 'firms', 'who', 'out', 'stops', 'terminate', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'accounted', 'mostly', 'gunfire', 'bloodshed', 'explosions', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'needed', 'make', 'happen', 'as', 'well', 'considerable', 'sexual', 'innuendo.For', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Marriage', 'intended', 'be', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'see', 'married', 'couple', 'strife', 'escalate', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'was', 'just', 'painful', 'watch', 'even', 'worse', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'Seeing', 'intense', 'violence', 'husband', 'wife', 'kicking', 'punching', 'shooting', 'other', 'out', 'effort', 'murder', 'other', 'not', 'idea', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', 'film', 'trivialized', 'conflict', 'taking', 'comic', 'tone', 'minimized', 'very', 'real', 'difficulties', 'couples', 'can', 'experience', 'relationships', 'when', 'laughing', 'matter', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'comedy', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'fact', 'story-line', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'particularly', 'critical', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'point', 'where', 'Smiths', 'move', 'turning', 'other', 'working', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'pulling', 'out', 'stops', 'kill', 'other', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'spark', 'love', 'inflame', 'passion', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'viewers', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'even', 'further', 'action', 'sequences', 'follow', 'where', 'heroes', 'take', 'out', 'gazillion', 'highly', 'trained', 'soldiers', 'barely', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'getting', 'scratch.Rather', 'succeeding', 'comedy', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'tragedy', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'sometimes', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'real', 'world', 'Even', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'Regrettably', 'comic', 'story', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Smith', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'disappointed', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'real', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Smiths', 'who', 'experience', 'tragedy', 'film', 'marriages', 'sadly', 'laughing', 'matter', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

SMITH is slick and loud and a bit empty and maybe even obnoxious, but since it features perhaps the most beautiful couple in the world, I tend to overlook the movie's excesses and transgressions. You just about have to, with films like this which run on sheer glamorous star power and make you cave with its oodles of sex appeal.The movie starts off cute, borrowing a morsel from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, that bit where married couples are being interviewed. Immediately we catch on that, after five or six years of gradually eroding togetherness, the Smiths' marriage has stagnated. John Smith is a professional engineer. Jane Smith troubleshoots iffy corporate computer servers. They know this about each other. But what each doesn't know is that the other is secretly an elite contract assassin. And their hidden worlds are about to collide.Essentially MR. & MRS. SMITH is a screwball from the hitman's perspective and it's marked with such a heightened sense of fun and cool and style that I half anticipated cameos from Pitt's Ocean's Eleven cronies. It's more lighthearted thanPrizzi's Honorand not as dark asThe War of the Roses. The action pieces are super-charged and over-the-top; the undercover assassin elements are handled well. Is the movie as gritty as, say, the Bourne flicks? No, but it's obvious that this movie isn't going for that grittiness. It's half a dose of provocative marriage-on-the-rocks romance, and half John Woo-inspired bullets ballet.- Jane Smith to her husband John: ""Baby, you couldn't find the button with two hands and a map.""MR. & MRS. SMITH frames Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt at their banterful best, their caustic, suggestive exchanges perhaps giving us a whiff of what really went on behind the scenes on set (if you buy all those rumors). Jolie and Pitt are Hollywood royalty, and this film capitalizes on their star power and showcases their spectacular chemistry. And it's hard not to get the vapors, watching their sensual dance in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia or that home-wrecking domestic brawl they get into. This film isn't as good asTrue Liesbut it's way sexier (and this is with mad respect to Jamie Lee Curtis's hotel room strip scene).And sometimes the curse of being too beautiful kicks in. Pitt and Jolie are so gorgeous that we sometimes forget that these two have got very good acting skills. They're so natural and charismatic at playing these types of roles that one tends to dismiss the work that goes into the portrayal. These guys can act. Props, also, to the scoring. The droll, easy-breezy score is indispensable, transforming what would otherwise have been an unbearable study of a stifling marriage into something that comes across more as a series of comedic domestic squabbles.But, yes, okay, it does feel at times as if the film is trying too hard. There's a bit of overkill.But, dang, look at all the pretty.This Unrated edition comes in two discs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and Director Doug Liman's film commentary. Disc 2 has the following:- ""Confidential Files"" features 12 deleted scenes - including Adam Brody's funny extraction scene and a pretty neat (but predictable) alternate ending - and the screenplay of yet another alternate ending, and almost four minutes of gag reel.- ""Domestic Violence: Shooting MR. & MRS. SMITH"" - the 33-minute Behind-the-Scenes documentary (a worthwhile look, and I liked the break down footage of several scenes, including the two dance pieces).- ""Doug's Film School"" - Director Doug Liman introduces seven segments: ""Framing Device"" tracks Adam Brody's providing narration as a framing device for the story (although the studio eventually decided not to go this route). ""Mother & Father"" is a series of deleted cutaway scenes featuring John and Jane's respective bosses (Jacqueline Bisset and Terrence Stamp, later replaced with Angela Bassett and Keith David). The lengthy ""Snowy Ravine"" segment features the previsualization and live shooting of the ravine sequence (where you can see Brad Pitt get in a firefight with a cartoon); the ravine sequence later became the desert sequence, the shooting of which is also included (plus the screenplays for both sequences). We see the animated storyboarding Liman used to prep for the ""Hood Jump"" sequence (where Jane runs over John with her car); screenplay included. ""Underground Garage"" presents an alternate take of the Smiths' ""run or fight"" conversation which, in the movie, took place under a sewer grate but in this bonus scene is set in an underground garage; screenplay included. ""HomeMade"" focuses on the alternate front-end sequence to the big firefight climax (taking place this time in the HomeMade depot center during business hours instead of KostMart at night); also included, two storyboard sequences and the screenplay.

Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[1, 5]","Jameson Thottam with a mediocre rating of ""Mr and Mrs. Smith""Mr. and Mrs. Smith was just out and we decided that would be our choice so off we went. After such a long night and a big lunch at the Olive Garden I could've gone to sleep right there in the theater but we did manage to stay awake during the show.Rationale for this movie? Jameson ThottamI wonder, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith's opening weekend ($51 million), how much of that was the movie and how much was curiosity to see the movie that broke up Pitt and Aniston's marriage? Personally, I think it had a lot to do with it but hey, that's just my opinion. I think, after seeing the film, that Pitt and Jolie have good chemistry and it came through on screen. Where this led off screen, they're being coy about, but we all can connect the dots.On The Players: Jameson ThottamPitt plays John Smith and Jolie plays Jane Smith (not exactly original names for undercover operatives huh?). They're both are assassins working for competing government agencies who don't know what the other does. John's cover is as a contracting engineer and Jane's is as a head of a computer firm on wall street. They live the upper middle class dream with a huge house in the suburbs and a Benz and a Cadillac in the garage. To all outward appearances they have it all except that the spark that ignited their marriage no longer exists. They're just going through the motions enroute to the inevitable divorce. In fact, the movie opens with them at a marriage counseling session.I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that eventually they both uncover each other's secret identity when they are each given a contract to kill the other. A hilarious scene ensues when they're eating dinner while each is trying to figure out if the other is trying to kill them.Opinions: Jameson Luke ThottamPitt and Jolie are likable actors and the script plays up their strengths and they both display a deft comic touch. They have good lines and an easy banter that is believable for a husband and wife. It's also very funny to hear then try to unravel their past and separate the lies from the truth about who they really are. Unfortunately, all the other characters are underdeveloped and the script has some huge holes. It's never really explained why competing government agencies would want to eliminate what appears to be their top operatives. They are, after all, on the same side although the agency Jolie works for seems a little more high tech than Pitt's agency.Last thoughts: Jameson ThottamIn the end, this is definitely a summer movie and probably the only Academy Awards this film will be up for are sound effects since my ears were definitely ringing when I left the theater. The film certainly looks and sounds good but don't examine the plot too carefully because it can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny. I was especially disappointed in the ending which never really resolved anything and left a major plot thread hanging.

I went into this with high hopes, although not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I knew the man had delivered previously, and Angelina Jolie, even with her few flops, can be a good actress, and let's face it, this chick is smokin' hot!!! But as usual with myself getting ""jiggy"" for a movie, I was again let down, you'd think I'd be used to this by now. But, anyway, Let's begin with Mr. Pitt, shall we? Obviously one of Hollywood's golden boys, this man has made some huge hits, and this was one of them, and he is, um, OK in this, not great, but OK. I felt that during the comedic moments in this film he was really good, he can make you laugh pretty easily and has a gift for physical comedy, but when the serious, emotional scenes play out, I found him boring and lacking. Don't worry ladies, you get to see the world famous abs and pecs, I'm a strong enough man to be able to say this guy is hot and it'e easy to see why the ladies like him.Now for Angelina Jolie, wow does this woman look hot in a bra, which, among other lingerie items, she seems to be in alot of during this 123-minute movie. She too has a knack for some funny moments, and her chemistry with Pitt is decent, not memorable, but decent. Let's face it, Jolie has not done a decent acting job since Gia or Original Sin, and 'Smith"" is no exception, she looks  sexy as hell, but that's about all I can give her, sorry.Now my biggest complaint, Vince Vaughn. One of the funniest men In Hollywood, with huge hits recently like Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, you'd think he might have a chance in saving this. Nope, didn't happen, the man can't be funny and charming if he isn't given good material to work with, and except for one funny scene when he is yelling at his mother while carrying a rather big gun in his hands, the jokes here feel forced and really don't work.There are a couple of above-average action scenes, but way too many shoot-outs, most of them shot very choppy, scenes moving so quickly, I was wishing they would just slow down, you know, take your time in your killing, put on a show and all....I'm guessing alot of people are going to disagree with my review, In talking to some of my customers at work, alot of them were excited about this, raving on how the action really worked and Pitt and Jolie were excellent together, and that's fine. I guess I just want a little more with my action films these days, maybe a little more Sin City and Punisher and alot less Sahara and XXX2acting.........2.5 stars, Pitt and Jolie LOOK great, Vaughn bitesdirecting.......2 stars, Poorly done, little more editing OK?special effects.....3 stars, Stunts are pretty cool, but gun play is well over-doneaction rating......2.5 stars, Some cool action...here and therequality........2.5 stars, Felt like an MTV video at timesaction",2,"Sorry to all Pitt and Jolie fans, but  a big  'yawn'...............",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2885,"['few', 'cute', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'rather', 'poorly', 'done', 'action', 'flick', 'went', 'high', 'hopes', 'not', 'huge', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'fan', 'knew', 'man', 'had', 'delivered', 'previously', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'even', 'few', 'flops', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'let', 'face', 'chick', 'smokin', 'hot', 'usual', 'getting', 'jiggy', 'movie', 'was', 'again', 'let', 'down', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'used', 'now', 'anyway', 'Let', 'begin', 'Mr.', 'Pitt', 'shall', 'Obviously', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'boys', 'man', 'made', 'huge', 'hits', 'was', 'one', 'um', 'OK', 'not', 'great', 'OK', 'felt', 'comedic', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'can', 'make', 'pretty', 'easily', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'when', 'serious', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'found', 'boring', 'lacking', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'ladies', 'get', 'see', 'world', 'famous', 'abs', 'pecs', ""'m"", 'strong', 'enough', 'man', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'guy', 'hot', 'e', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'ladies', 'him.Now', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'wow', 'woman', 'look', 'hot', 'bra', 'other', 'lingerie', 'items', 'be', 'alot', '123-minute', 'movie', 'too', 'knack', 'funny', 'moments', 'chemistry', 'Pitt', 'decent', 'not', 'memorable', 'decent', 'Let', 'face', 'Jolie', 'not', 'done', 'decent', 'acting', 'job', 'Gia', 'Original', 'Sin', 'exception', 'sexy', 'hell', 'can', 'give', 'sorry.Now', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'One', 'funniest', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'huge', 'hits', 'recently', 'Dodgeball', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', ""'d"", 'think', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'saving', 'Nope', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'charming', ""n't"", 'given', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'one', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'yelling', 'mother', 'carrying', 'rather', 'big', 'gun', 'hands', 'jokes', 'here', 'feel', 'forced', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'work.There', 'are', 'couple', 'above-average', 'action', 'scenes', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'shoot-outs', 'most', 'shot', 'very', 'choppy', 'scenes', 'moving', 'so', 'quickly', 'was', 'wishing', 'would', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'know', 'take', 'time', 'killing', 'put', 'show', '.I', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'alot', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'disagree', 'review', 'talking', 'customers', 'work', 'alot', 'were', 'excited', 'raving', 'how', 'action', 'really', 'worked', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'were', 'excellent', 'together', 'fine', 'guess', 'just', 'want', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'films', 'days', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'Sin', 'City', 'Punisher', 'alot', 'less', 'Sahara', 'XXX2acting', '2.5', 'stars', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'LOOK', 'great', 'Vaughn', 'bitesdirecting', '.2', 'stars', 'Poorly', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'editing', 'OK', 'special', 'effects', '..3', 'stars', 'Stunts', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'gun', 'play', 'well', 'over-doneaction', 'rating', '2.5', 'stars', 'cool', 'action', 'here', 'therequality', '..2.5', 'stars', 'Felt', 'MTV', 'video', 'timesaction']",N/A

Munson,"[3, 3]","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations.Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage.  Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn).  They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say.  They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors.  But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye.Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations.  They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody).  Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane.  The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them.Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband.  What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife?  Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle?  Will John and Jane join forces to save each other?I thought this was a very good movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes.  There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are perfect together, and the film will keep you on your toes throughout.

The story starts out with the telling of why the Smith's marriage is failing apart. Thru the eyes of a marriage counselor. The Smiths who both are assassins for hire. Both discover their mates' true nature then the sparks fly. Vince Vaughn, whom I truly enjoyed, plays a fellow assassin and John Smith best friend.The ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic to me and closure between them was missing something. The movie just falls apart at the end just a little. They argue and talk about their marriage during shoot-outs which can be annoying at times. Then there's a time that the shoot out last too long which makes it unrealistic.  Seriously I mean the movie just ends after a shoot-out that's not that involving or believable.The movie probably needed a main villain. The movie is just about their marriage though and I guess it would've lost focus a little if their was a main villain. Still though it needed something besides them just killing soldier after soldier that come after them. I really liked this movie and I'm happy that I purchased the DVD.

930234,A2FPTKHLSR8YRX,B000AP04EW,J. Essinger,"[6, 8]","How on earth can anybody watch this amazing, thoughtful, subtle, moving, sexy, challenging, disturbing movie and not love it for evermore? Reading some of the other amazon reviews makes me wonder whether the reviewers saw the same movie, or if perhaps they were too tired, or jaded by life, to appreciate it.Director Doug Liman and his two astonishing stars (plus a fantastic supporting task including the laconic but always watchable Vince Vaughn and the extraordinarily beautiful Michelle Monaghan in a great cameo as Gwen the laptop pathologist) have created one of the finest movies I have ever seen.The point about 'Mr and Mrs Smith' is that it really makes you think. Yes, when maybe you first see it you imagine you are just seeing another good action movie with some dollops of sex appeal thrown in. But PLEASE, remember that the people who worked on this movie spent hundreds of man (and woman)-years making it for you, so watch it again. I GUARANTEE you will start to see new, very brilliant and highly entertaining stuff in it. Like, to take just one example, the way the Smiths put their wedding rings back on when they return to the house, as if their secret lives were a kind of infidelity, which of course they are. Like the way what is REALLY happening in the film is that the violence and bad guys etc are just a wonderful and dramatic metaphor for the private, closedness that so many couples (or maybe all of us?) bring to marriages and relationships and which are utterly bound to kill the relationship stone dead. This is a movie about a couple who fall in love with each other's bodies and then, accidentally, really get to know each other and at last fall in love for real. The fact that to do this they have, in effect, to destroy their house, their careers and - almost - each other is really by the by.The movie is also astonishingly sexy. This is where you will find real sexiness; in this movie, not in nonsensicial porn movies with no plots and bored, unjoyous actors and actresses. 'Mr and Mr Smith' is incredibly sexy because the sexiness is brainy sexiness: the kind that is the sexiest of all. Quite apart from the fact that the stars are filmed really well by this highly talented director (note, for example, the sheer beauty of the way Jane is lit when we first meet her in action in Bogota) the situations themselves have a fantastic inherent sexiness. For instance, the scene where Jane kills the arms dealer who thinks she is just a dominatrix is very sexy because of how it dramatises the strange deadliness of female sexuality: didn't someone (Rudyard Kipling, I think) say that the female is deadlier than the male? This scene would have stunned Kipling but it proves his point. And then Jane goes home in her fishnet stockings to a nice bourgeois all-American drinks party at the Colemans: notice the way this scene suggests the implicit wilful sexual energy and potency that underpins superficially bourgeois family life.I could go on, but I don't want to give away anything crucial about the plot.

930235,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B000AP04EW,JLind555,"[1, 2]","I didn't expect to like this movie. By the time I finally got around to catching it on cable TV I was Brangelina'ed out. Feh. But ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is so much fun to watch, never mind that it is completely and totally unbelievable, that you can't help hanging in for the ride and enjoying almost every minute of it.So: He's John. She's Jane. They're both gorgeous. (Being Pitt and Jolie, what else would you expect?) They meet in Bogota, Colombia in the middle of some government mess, and it's love at first sight. Flash forward to five or six years later (they're not sure which), when they are contentedly if boringly settled in suburbia, each going about their daily business. She thinks he's the head of an engineering firm. He thinks she's the head of a computer company. What neither of them knows is that each is a top agent for rival companies of international assassins, and each company has contracted them to take out the same target, a young hunk named Benjamin Danz a/k/a ""The Tank"", nicely played by Adam Brody. Through a series of mis-steps, each gets in the other's way and the target escapes. Their respective companies are not pleased. Now they're each assigned to do away with the hindrance, and they find themselves with 48 hours to kill each other.From there, the craziness multiplies exponentially. ""Do you know you're ticking?"" asks an incredulous bystander, warning John just in time that an explosive device is about to detonate in his jacket pocket. ""That's TWO TIMES you've tried to kill me!"" shouts John into his cell phone while racing Jane home in a purloined limousine. ""Oh come on, it was just a little bomb,"" she sniffs as she zooms down the highway towards home, where an enraged John is headed and all hell is about to break loose. And amid gun battles, exploding houses, car chases and general mayhem, they discover that their respective firms are not pleased to learn that they are married (sleeping with the enemy is a no-no), and set up the Tank mission all along as a trap for them to take each other out.The plot is so off the wall that it would defy the belief of a five-year-old, but this movie doesn't ask to be taken seriously, as if anybody would. It's a fun movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. We see the Smiths going about their daily (or nightly) assignments as he is sent to assassinate a guy named Lucky at his poker game; when he returns home, Jane asks John how the game went; John replies, ""I got Lucky."" Har-de-har-har. While John has been off bumping off Lucky, Jane herself has gone to the hotel suite of a notorious gun-runner with a taste for S & M. ""Have you been selling big guns to bad people?"" she coos as she strokes his hair and takes hold of his neck. Twist. Snap. Thud. Out the door just in time to make it to the Colemans' cocktail party. Typical life in suburbia.But what really makes this movie is the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. From their first scene together, these two set off sparks. Their magnetic attraction to each other, even while they're doing their level best to kill each other (or at least to keep from getting killed by the other) hold them and the movie together. Pitt has some nice comic turns (""Honey, you're overreacting!"" he shouts at her while she tries to run him down with her car. ""We don't want to go to bed angry!"") and a couple of tired comic turns as a klutz who keeps making noises dropping things when silence is essential), but it's Jolie who holds our attention more. She sizzles and smolders and her eyes speak volumes; this lady hardly needs words to communicate with eyes like hers. But the movie is almost stolen by Vince Vaughn as John's colleague Eddie, a loser who still lives with his mother because she's the only woman in the world he can trust, even while he yells at her for keeping tabs on him. An assassin and a momma's boy? Hilarious -- and as unlikely as the rest of the film. The movie hits total disbelief through the final gun battle with their firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Well, hey, it's only a movie.When all is said and done, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" treats us to two hot actors in very nice performances, lots of comedy, loads of action, and not a whole lot else. It doesn't demand anything out of you except to suspend belief and enjoy the ride. Pass the popcorn.Judy Lind",4,Dodging bullets and other hazards of married life,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,4460,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'time', 'finally', 'got', 'catching', 'cable', 'TV', 'was', ""Brangelina'ed"", 'out', 'Feh', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'never', 'mind', 'completely', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hanging', 'ride', 'enjoying', 'almost', 'minute', 'it.So', 'John', 'Jane', ""'re"", 'gorgeous', 'Being', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'meet', 'Bogota', 'Colombia', 'middle', 'government', 'mess', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Flash', 'forward', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'when', 'are', 'contentedly', 'boringly', 'settled', 'suburbia', 'going', 'daily', 'business', 'head', 'engineering', 'firm', 'head', 'computer', 'company', 'What', 'top', 'agent', 'rival', 'companies', 'international', 'assassins', 'company', 'contracted', 'take', 'out', 'same', 'target', 'young', 'hunk', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'Danz', 'Tank', 'nicely', 'played', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'series', 'mis-steps', 'other', 'way', 'target', 'escapes', 'respective', 'companies', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'Now', ""'re"", 'assigned', 'do', 'away', 'hindrance', 'find', '48', 'hours', 'kill', 'other.From', 'there', 'craziness', 'multiplies', 'exponentially', 'Do', 'know', ""'re"", 'ticking', 'incredulous', 'bystander', 'warning', 'John', 'just', 'time', 'explosive', 'device', 'detonate', 'jacket', 'pocket', 'TWO', 'TIMES', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'kill', 'John', 'cell', 'phone', 'racing', 'Jane', 'home', 'purloined', 'limousine', 'Oh', 'come', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'bomb', 'sniffs', 'down', 'highway', 'home', 'where', 'enraged', 'John', 'headed', 'hell', 'break', 'loose', 'gun', 'battles', 'exploding', 'houses', 'car', 'chases', 'general', 'mayhem', 'discover', 'respective', 'firms', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'learn', 'are', 'married', 'sleeping', 'enemy', 'no-no', 'set', 'up', 'Tank', 'mission', 'all', 'along', 'trap', 'take', 'other', 'out.The', 'plot', 'so', 'wall', 'would', 'defy', 'belief', 'five-year-old', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ask', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'anybody', 'would', 'fun', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'see', 'Smiths', 'going', 'daily', 'nightly', 'assignments', 'sent', 'assassinate', 'guy', 'named', 'Lucky', 'poker', 'game', 'when', 'home', 'Jane', 'John', 'how', 'game', 'went', 'John', 'replies', 'got', 'Lucky', 'Har-de-har-har', 'John', 'been', 'off', 'bumping', 'off', 'Lucky', 'Jane', 'gone', 'hotel', 'suite', 'notorious', 'gun-runner', 'taste', 'S', 'M.', 'Have', 'been', 'selling', 'big', 'guns', 'bad', 'people', 'coos', 'hair', 'hold', 'neck', 'Twist', 'Snap', 'Thud', 'door', 'just', 'time', 'make', 'Colemans', 'cocktail', 'party', 'Typical', 'life', 'suburbia.But', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'first', 'scene', 'together', 'two', 'set', 'off', 'sparks', 'magnetic', 'attraction', 'other', 'even', ""'re"", 'doing', 'level', 'best', 'kill', 'other', 'least', 'keep', 'getting', 'killed', 'other', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'Pitt', 'nice', 'comic', 'turns', 'Honey', ""'re"", 'overreacting', 'run', 'down', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'bed', 'angry', 'couple', 'tired', 'comic', 'turns', 'klutz', 'who', 'making', 'noises', 'dropping', 'things', 'when', 'silence', 'essential', 'Jolie', 'who', 'attention', 'more', 'smolders', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'lady', 'hardly', 'words', 'communicate', 'eyes', 'hers', 'movie', 'almost', 'stolen', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'John', 'colleague', 'Eddie', 'loser', 'who', 'still', 'mother', 'only', 'woman', 'world', 'can', 'trust', 'even', 'keeping', 'tabs', 'assassin', 'momma', 'boy', 'Hilarious', 'as', 'unlikely', 'rest', 'film', 'movie', 'total', 'disbelief', 'final', 'gun', 'battle', 'firms', 'combined', 'hit', 'team', 'John', 'Jane', 'take', 'out', 'agent', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'bother', 'hit', 'team', 'acts', 'Gang', 'That', 'Could', ""n't"", 'Shoot', 'Straight', 'Well', 'hey', 'only', 'movie.When', 'said', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'two', 'hot', 'actors', 'very', 'nice', 'performances', 'lots', 'comedy', 'loads', 'action', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'else', ""n't"", 'demand', 'anything', 'suspend', 'belief', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'Pass', 'popcorn.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A

John is supposedly in construction while Jane is supposedly in computer maintenance.  Their secret lives are much different.  They each thought the marriage would provide good cover for their own covert actions but are now going to a marriage counselor.  We get a good look at how they started together and how they got where they are.  Then they are both hired for the same hit and get in each others way.  Now they each have forty-eight hours to eliminate the other before their companies eliminate them.They manage to track each other down and are surprised to learn their spouse is now what they thought.  A misunderstanding then drives them into a series of maneuvers where they keep trying to kill one another.  But all of this give each of them a chance to explore what their feelings really are for each other.  Honesty begins to be a part of their communication and things get more complex.  As the relationships build so does the action until everything is neatly wrapped up.This is not another True Lies although there are some obvious similarities.  The therapy framework as well as the flashbacks and humor help make the film unique and not a retreatment of old ideas.  The change in personas between the real and the cover personalities is also very well done and believable.  This helps cement the rest of the film.

For the story, it talks about Brad Pitt (John Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) is a couple that have been married for 6 years and things appear to be normal. But it appears that things are changing, they might be in trouble.  So, they are seeing a marriage counselor. However, nobody including themselves knows is that they are professional assassins. However, they are both assigned by their employers to kill the same person. When they each try to take out the target, they get in each other's way and blow the job. Now they are told to go after the person who made them miss the target. And when they learn about each other, they try to take each other out.  After that, they get back each other and decide to get rid of their enemies in the end.  For the story, it is quite perfect.  It is well written.  For the acting, all of them are so good.  For Brad Pitt, he has his very cool acting attitude like usual.  This movie is no exception.  So, when he appears in every movie that I watched, he never disappoints me.  For Angelina Jolie, she is actually quite a very good actress.  For this movie, she is the bomb as well as Brad Pitt.  For the direction, it is going well in this movie.  It has no doubt about it.  For the visuals, it is very good.  The scene of Angelina Jolie jumps off from the roof in the building.  It is fantastic.  The scene of the house-explosion scene in the middle, it is good.  Also, the scene of the final explosive battle in the store during the night, it is absolutely fantastic too.  So, the visuals are very good from head to toe.  For the music, it is very good and has a very exciting feeling.  For the sound effects, it is very tense between scenes to scenes.  Also, not only mention a lot of action scenes in this movie, the love scenes between Brad and Angelina are very good.  For example, the scene when they first met in Columbia.

As it stands, the movie seems to be thumbing its nose at young Brody, featuring him in the second reel for about 1 minute and a half, when the boss calls him into the office and his officious secretary knocks him down to size by not letting him cross the threshold.  The audience isn't given the chance to know what this is all about, and he's completely forgotten till about an hour later, when he pops up in a car, being transported to a highsecurity federal prison.  Do we ever find out why?  It doesn't matter, we never really care about his character.  When Brad Pitt threatens him with physical pain, and when Angelina Jolie hits him across the face with a telephone, there's not much at stake, for we still don't know who he is or how he got suckered into appearing in the movie.  Was it to give the project some teen credibility, the way John Wayne was forced into hiring Ricky Nelson or Frankie Avalon in minor roles in his later Westerns?  If so, how ludicrous, because all Adam Brody brings to the part is a trademark dorkiness which makes us think that a cheeky smirk is all he has to offer.  He should fire all his advisors who had him take this role.  Yeah, how's that screen career coming, Seth Cohen?Other than this miscalculation, the star power of Pitt and Jolie burns like a city on fire.  They are perfectly matched and no wonder they fell in love or whatever!  She has never been better and her acting, here a series of mumbles, smirks and fleeting realizations, could almost be mistaken for a lost performance by the divine Louise Brooks.  Asked how long they've been together, Pitt says, ""Five years,"" and Jolie mutters, ""Six.""  This exchange happens over and over, and it's funnier each time.  (I know it doesn't sound very funny but believe me, in context it is.)  And I know the Hitchcock comedy from 1941 isn't actually the original of this movie, but Liman outdoes Hitchcock at the comedy of manners, heretical as it may be to say.

Part of the problem most big-ticket movies have had in the last several years is that they have been pretentious on the surface and hollow at the core.  ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is just big, supremely dumb, and gobs of fun.If you've seen the previews you know the basic story.  A married couple has settled into bland co-existence, each unaware that the other is a top-flight assassin.  When the two of them are given the same assignment and botch each other's plans, they are forced to train their sights on each other.That's it.  There are no layers, no profound themes.  Though a serious critic could get a great deal out of the fight scenes, which transparently conflate sex and violence, that's all smoke and mirrors.  This movie is about lush visuals, gorgeously choreographed combat, and coarse humor.It's true that the two leads don't put a lot into the acting.  Did you expect anything more from these two?  They deliver servicable lines and allow the camera to admire their stylish fighting technique.  That's all the movie demands, and that's all you and I need.It's not world-changing.

930253,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AP04EW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 1]","Some 60 years after Hitchcock made the marriage troubled screwball comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 1941 with Carole Lombard in the female lead and Robert Montgomery opposite her the film has received an action-packed makeover.  This remake casts Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as Jane and John Smith.  The film certainly gives the audience a fireworks spectacle comparable to many Schwarzenegger and Stallone films from the 1980s and early 1990s.  It even has a touch of James Bond and Mission Impossible with its secret compartments and its cool approach to the hush-hush missions.  However, the remake still possesses some of the same screwball humor, as the new Smiths struggle with their marriage.There are both similarities and differences in both the original and the remake.  The original opens in a messy hotel room to which the arguing couple has withdrawn to deal with their relationship issues while the 2005 version delivers a more contemporary solution through a visit to a marriage counselor.  Hitchcock applies a detailed mise-en-scene and terrific performances by the cast to accentuate the character's lives while Jane and John offer information on their relationship through brief verbal testimonials.  However, the most obvious difference is the subtlety of threats in Hitchcock's film while director Doug Liman is much rougher (maybe a clear underestimation) in his depiction of a marriage in trouble.It is in the presentation where the remake highlights the differences with the original film, as both Jane and John live secret double lives.  They are professional killers that serve the highest bidder.  Successfully, they have hidden their secrets from each other for the last five-six years (they do not seem to be able agree on how long they have been married.)  This is also the second time that the theme of a couple having secret double lives emerge, which it also done in James Cameron's 1994 box office hit True Lies.  However, the difference here is that both are secret killers.Jane and John are constantly watching over their shoulder in order to maintain the normal front of marriage.  Often they come close to uncovering one another, but never do. It did not start this way between them, as they once were happily in love.  Over time, their never-ending series of intricate lies and deceits has begun to wear on them.  The weariness has worn out their lustful desire and loving appetite for each other's lips and created an indifference.  Despite their apathy, they both try to maintain the illusion of happiness by doing the things married people do such as eating supper together and going to dinner parties.  The apathy also forges a strong silence between them, which never seems to be broken through any kind of quarrel.  Still, these emotions must surface in order for the relationship to continue, as Hitchcock so well portrayed through his 1941 version.The truth is about to come out when they both take on a job of assassinating the same person.  The question only is how it will affect their relationship, as they both carry years of repressed resentment.  It is a strong bitterness that will affect their reaction to the truth of their identities and fake foundation of their marriage.  Also, they realize that they are competitors living together, and the awareness of one another might just have lethal consequences and bring a love quarrel to another level disguised in blades and bullets.Married couples always encounter some moments in their lives when their relationship might seem weakened.  Some successfully survive the rough spots while others seek divorce.  Jane and John will propel the thought of splitting up into an entertaining action film that will have the audience laugh and rock in their seats, as the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie seek the ultimate ending of a relationship.  In addition, Liman has previously made the witty Swingers (1996), exciting Go (1999), and the suspenseful Bourne Identity (2002) and shows in Mr. & Mrs. Smith his eye for thoughtful and quick action, which displays much promise for future films.  Unfortunately even though the film is amusing and has some flashy action sequences that will draw attention, it never reaches the innovative quality of Hitchcock.",4,Amusingly Hostile Remake Illustrates the Epitome of Marriage Trouble...,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,4258,"['60', 'years', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'marriage', 'troubled', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', '1941', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'female', 'lead', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'film', 'received', 'action-packed', 'makeover', 'remake', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jane', 'John', 'Smith', 'film', 'certainly', 'audience', 'fireworks', 'spectacle', 'comparable', 'many', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone', 'films', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'even', 'touch', 'James', 'Bond', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'secret', 'compartments', 'cool', 'approach', 'hush-hush', 'missions', 'However', 'remake', 'still', 'same', 'screwball', 'humor', 'new', 'Smiths', 'struggle', 'marriage.There', 'are', 'similarities', 'differences', 'original', 'remake', 'original', 'opens', 'messy', 'hotel', 'room', 'arguing', 'couple', 'withdrawn', 'deal', 'relationship', 'issues', '2005', 'version', 'more', 'contemporary', 'solution', 'visit', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'Hitchcock', 'detailed', 'mise-en-scene', 'terrific', 'performances', 'cast', 'accentuate', 'character', 'lives', 'Jane', 'John', 'offer', 'information', 'relationship', 'brief', 'verbal', 'testimonials', 'However', 'most', 'obvious', 'difference', 'subtlety', 'threats', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'much', 'rougher', 'maybe', 'clear', 'underestimation', 'depiction', 'marriage', 'trouble.It', 'presentation', 'where', 'remake', 'differences', 'original', 'film', 'Jane', 'John', 'live', 'secret', 'double', 'lives', 'are', 'professional', 'killers', 'serve', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Successfully', 'have', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'other', 'last', 'five-six', 'years', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'agree', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'also', 'second', 'time', 'theme', 'couple', 'having', 'secret', 'double', 'lives', 'emerge', 'also', 'done', 'James', 'Cameron', '1994', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'True', 'Lies', 'However', 'difference', 'here', 'are', 'secret', 'killers.Jane', 'John', 'are', 'constantly', 'watching', 'over', 'shoulder', 'order', 'maintain', 'normal', 'front', 'marriage', 'come', 'close', 'uncovering', 'one', 'never', 'do', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'way', 'once', 'were', 'happily', 'love', 'time', 'never-ending', 'series', 'intricate', 'lies', 'deceits', 'begun', 'wear', 'weariness', 'worn', 'out', 'lustful', 'desire', 'loving', 'appetite', 'other', 'lips', 'created', 'indifference', 'apathy', 'try', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'happiness', 'doing', 'things', 'married', 'people', 'do', 'such', 'eating', 'supper', 'together', 'going', 'dinner', 'parties', 'apathy', 'also', 'strong', 'silence', 'never', 'be', 'broken', 'kind', 'quarrel', 'Still', 'emotions', 'must', 'surface', 'order', 'relationship', 'continue', 'Hitchcock', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', '1941', 'version.The', 'truth', 'come', 'out', 'when', 'take', 'job', 'assassinating', 'same', 'person', 'question', 'only', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'relationship', 'carry', 'years', 'repressed', 'resentment', 'strong', 'bitterness', 'will', 'affect', 'reaction', 'truth', 'identities', 'fake', 'foundation', 'marriage', 'Also', 'realize', 'are', 'competitors', 'living', 'together', 'awareness', 'one', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'lethal', 'consequences', 'bring', 'love', 'quarrel', 'level', 'disguised', 'blades', 'bullets.Married', 'couples', 'always', 'encounter', 'moments', 'lives', 'when', 'relationship', 'might', 'seem', 'weakened', 'successfully', 'survive', 'rough', 'spots', 'others', 'seek', 'divorce', 'Jane', 'John', 'will', 'propel', 'thought', 'splitting', 'up', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'audience', 'laugh', 'rock', 'seats', 'characters', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'seek', 'ultimate', 'ending', 'relationship', 'addition', 'Liman', 'previously', 'made', 'witty', 'Swingers', '1996', 'exciting', 'Go', '1999', 'suspenseful', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '2002', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'eye', 'thoughtful', 'quick', 'action', 'much', 'promise', 'future', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'film', 'amusing', 'flashy', 'action', 'sequences', 'will', 'draw', 'attention', 'never', 'innovative', 'quality', 'Hitchcock']",N/A

He left his lovely wife for a new cutie that he met while making this movie.  Both actors were boring and so was the script.  I thought I'd seen it all, but this one takes the cake.  The plot (what plot?) was a disaster.  You think, at first, they are just an average rich couple bored with each other and marriage.  And why not?  They barely talk to each other!  But soon you realize that this couple are each secret assassins married to each other, but neither one knows what the other does, despite the fact that all the high tech assassin stuff is hidden all over the house, in the oven, in the garage, under the kitchen cabinets, the microwave, the cutlery drawer, and anywhere a movie director and a computer geek can think of to hide it.These assassins are very, VERY  high tech.  (All of Jolie's associates are very sexy women)  In one scene Jolie escapes like a scene from Spider Man, where she slides down a very tall building on a thin little cord.  At that point, I nearly turned it off.Finally the two discover the profession of the other, and that they are working for two different organizations.  What kind?  We don't know.  Organizations that murder people, whoever they're supposed to be.  Then they get an assignment in which they are both going after the same person (but it's not too clear, why).  Never is.  Anyway, on this mission they spot each other on opposite sides, so they figure out that each of them is in the same business.  At first they decide to kill each other, and at that point it becomes totally ridiculous as they chase each other around the house and down the road.While preparing for the End Time, a few kids come up to Pitt and ask ""What are you doing?""  Answer:  ""Uh, preparing for a block party.""  (or something like that. Don't remember.)At some point, the two change their minds about killing each other and from there the movie is just a jazzed up chase film.  I don't know how it ends, because at that point, I turned it off, and my husband had already fallen asleep.Personally I think films that resemble Spider Man or Batman should remain cartoons.

Their life has become routine and boring.  They've fallen out of love.What they don't know is that each of them has a secret.  In fact, it's the same secret.  Both of them are assassins who have been hiding what they really do from each other since the moment they met.  Their respective bosses have figured it out, however, and their next assignment is to kill each other, or become a target together.To be honest, I was intrigued by the premise, but really knew nothing else about the film.  I was almost turned off by the gossip surrounding the leads, but went with some friends to see it anyway.We loved it!  This is a black comedy with lots of action and suspense.  And great one-liners.  We laughed ourselves silly at the dialog from the very first scene.  The funniest scene by far was the scene where John and Jane were fighting around their house.  Their lines were exactly the opposite of what they were really feeling, but the actors did a great job of delivering the lines in a way that captured the absurdity of the situation.That's not to say the movie isn't without some flaws.  The beginning, while laying much needed background, is also a little slow.  And the climax is completely unbelievable.  Still, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously.  If you watch it looking for logic, you will be disappointed.  If you disengage your brain, you'll enjoy a fun time.The DVD features the standard stuff we've come to expect these days.  In addition to the movie, there are three audio commentaries with various members of the crew, including one with the director.

You get just a taste of how tough a serious marriage-counseling session can be. Tension builds up, as if much is being hidden. Don't get worried, there's not too much of that. Now for the fun part!Instead of committing box-office suicide and continuing as a witty, battle-of-the-sexes, marriage-manners comedy of half a century ago, like The Philadelphia Story, or His Girl Friday, this film explodes into a slick, glossy, speedy, zooming catharsis that will keep you buzzed unless you turn the sound off and close your eyes.The marriage-counseling motif is interjected in spurts throughout, even through the hectic, multi-thread closing finale. It is psycho-babble amidst the gunfire, but the director does not let it get in the way of the violent, cathartic flow. Rather, the babble anaesthetizes one to the violence of the beautifully choreographed action.For those who like allusions, this film is rich in allusions. John Huston's 1985 mob flick, Prizzi's Honor, also featured a marital problem that runs into an assassination assignment. In James Cameron's, True Lies, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a family man hiding his job as a top spy from his wife. Jolie flies in some scenes, in a reference to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. A scene from His Girl Friday with Cary Grant plays on a TV to remind up we are watching a battle-of-the-sexes movie. At another moment Jeopardy! appears on the TV, showing the contrast between Jolie and Vanna White. There is even a scene reminiscent of The Blues Brothers, although I'm not sure why. All this keeps the brain busy while to visceral gets its workout.Jolie and Pitt are talented, beautiful people and it is a pleasure to watch them perform.

930292,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B000AP04EW,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 8]","I've had high expectations for this film for so long now. And what happened? I was disappointed. Not with Angelina, she was fabulous as always, but Brad pulled the whole film down around him.This is basically True Lies, but without the greatness that was True Lies. Even down to the tango dance scene. But while True Lies had terrific action scenes from the start, this film starts with marriage counselling (much like in When Harry Met Sally), and Brad comes across as really stupid. It drags most of the way through, broken up with lots of shoot outs, and a highly unbelievable car chase section.There's something about Brad that I've never got. Every other woman out there swoons whenever he appears, but there's just no appeal there for me. Just a wee bit in Thelma & Louise, but I've never felt it in any other film. He's just too clean cut, but I can see why he may have been enticed for Angelina. Who wouldn't? But his character, and now him in real life, is unlikeable. He's lost whatever magic he used to have that every other woman could see, and I can't.Angelina only just about saves this film, and although it's not one of her best, it's still good to watch her. The girl knows she's hot as hell, and can do just the simplest thing to make a guy or girl swoon. I'm straight, I have a boyfriend, but if Angelina was offering ... Whereas Brad knows too damn well that women think he's sexy, and it's gone straight to his head. He's so cocky it's unbelievable.There's a few tongue in cheek jokes, but the only one I really got was the fact John Smith mentioned he'd been married once before, in Vegas. Angelina & Billy Bob did get married in Vegas. I think that's what it meant, although it maybe me jumping to conclusions.Vince Vaughn appears in what looks like an extended cameo, and he's irritating as hell. I don't know what's going there, but his character was pointless, and could have been written out quite easily, and never been missed.There's no real ending to this movie, and you're left with the feeling that there should be something more, with the Smiths shooting at nothing, and not getting hit at all. Some of the action scenes can come across as quite dodgy, especially when John Smith gets stabbed in the leg, pulls it out, with barely a grimace, and then runs. Uh huh of course.I wouldn't recommend this film, unless you're an Angelina fan, and willing to sit through a not great film just to watch her. If you're that desperate, then sure go ahead. Just don't say I didn't tell you. Thankfully I didn't pay money for this. I got it as a Christmas present. Ask for it as a present, and you won't end up being disappointed.",2,Watch purely for Angelina,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2651,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'so', 'long', 'now', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'Angelina', 'was', 'fabulous', 'always', 'Brad', 'pulled', 'whole', 'film', 'down', 'him.This', 'basically', 'True', 'Lies', 'greatness', 'was', 'True', 'Lies', 'Even', 'down', 'tango', 'dance', 'scene', 'True', 'Lies', 'had', 'terrific', 'action', 'scenes', 'start', 'film', 'marriage', 'counselling', 'much', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Brad', 'really', 'stupid', 'most', 'way', 'broken', 'up', 'lots', 'shoot', 'outs', 'highly', 'unbelievable', 'car', 'chase', 'something', 'Brad', ""'ve"", 'never', 'got', 'other', 'woman', 'swoons', 'whenever', 'just', 'appeal', 'there', 'Just', 'wee', 'bit', 'Thelma', 'Louise', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'other', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'clean', 'cut', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'enticed', 'Angelina', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'character', 'now', 'real', 'life', 'unlikeable', 'lost', 'magic', 'used', 'have', 'other', 'woman', 'could', 'see', ""can't.Angelina"", 'only', 'just', 'saves', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'girl', 'hot', 'hell', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'simplest', 'thing', 'make', 'guy', 'girl', 'swoon', ""'m"", 'straight', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'Angelina', 'was', 'offering', 'Whereas', 'Brad', 'too', 'damn', 'well', 'women', 'think', 'sexy', 'gone', 'straight', 'head', 'so', 'cocky', 'unbelievable.There', 'few', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'jokes', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'fact', 'John', 'Smith', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'been', 'married', 'once', 'before', 'Vegas', 'Angelina', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'did', 'get', 'married', 'Vegas', 'think', 'what', 'meant', 'maybe', 'jumping', 'conclusions.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'what', 'extended', 'cameo', 'irritating', 'as', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'there', 'character', 'was', 'pointless', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'out', 'quite', 'easily', 'never', 'been', 'real', 'ending', 'movie', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'Smiths', 'shooting', 'nothing', 'not', 'getting', 'hit', 'action', 'scenes', 'can', 'come', 'quite', 'dodgy', 'especially', 'when', 'John', 'Smith', 'stabbed', 'leg', 'out', 'barely', 'grimace', 'then', 'runs', 'Uh', 'huh', 'course.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', ""'re"", 'Angelina', 'fan', 'willing', 'sit', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'just', 'watch', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'then', 'sure', 'go', 'ahead', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'money', 'got', 'Christmas', 'present', 'Ask', 'present', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed']",N/A

The premise of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is pretty interesting: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith, a couple that has been married for five (or six) years and finds themselves stuck in a bit of a rut. John and Jane are both assassins, but neither of them are aware of their spouse's real profession. The truth comes out in a big way when their careers suddenly cross paths and their respective agencies order them to take each other out. Half of the movie revolves around the couple shooting at each other, but then they're both ultimately turned on by all the violence, which rekindles the passion in their marriage. Then their respective agencies decide that both assassins pose a conflict of interest because they're married, and the second half of the movie revolves around the Smiths working together to stay alive.I was pretty disappointed with this movie. It has a lot of potential because the premise is so interesting, and also because Pitt and Jolie have an undeniable onscreen chemistry. However, the script SUCKS! All these characters do is run around and shoot at people.

The movie opens with the Smiths sitting on a couch being questioned about their marriage by a psychologist who we never see (but is played by William Fichtner: Invasion, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon). When John and Jane met they had instant chemistry, drinking themselves blind and making out in the rain. After a few weeks they tied the knot. ""Five or six"" years later they fell into the suburb routine of getting up, going to work, having dinner and very little (if any) sex.They have both perfected their skills as liars and as deadly assassins. They botch a mutual job and in so doing learn that the other is also a hired killer. Even though they both lied, each feels deceived by the other but their relationship is the least of their problems. Because of this botch they have 48 hours to clean up the mess. Part of the mess involves getting rid of the other spouse. Sparks begin flying along side the many bullets they rain on one another.Right from the beginning I was laughing at their interaction between Jolie and Pitt. They are very funny, even when they are working (killing people, which sounds horrendous). The nattering between these two is reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant.

Then it goes on to showing how the 2 met in Bogota Columbia, how they fell in love and how 5 or 6 years later after their married, both find out that they are assassins...hmmm..what makes it even worse is that they were sent to whack each other off, not the target they both were after. So, the 2 try to kill each other, punching each other, shooting at each other, slapping, smashing each others heads into a wall or glass and in the end they find that their getting off on the fact their trying to kill one another...interesting. Doug Liman, has done comedy and action before but this is the first time he has meshed those 2 categories together which let's down some of the fun. The fact of the matter is, is that both stars have their moments but for me, it doesnt cut it at all. Vince Vaughn (Swingers, Wedding Crashers) who plays Pitt's boss is best out of the wasted supporting characters, who lives with his mom still (""Mom, I almost just killed you right there!). Adam Brody (Grind, TV'S THE O.C) wearing a Fight Club t-shirt when the man who starred in it was sitting across from him, yeah, ok. Another thing I hated was that it got to boring when they would find guns in hidden compartments...I mean, enough already. Also starring Kerry Washington (She Hate Me, Ray).

In this case both spouses are agents, neither one know about the other, and most of the film surrounds what happens after they find out.  The two things that make the movie work as well as it does is that it is very well written, mostly tongue in cheek, and the great chemistry between Pitt and Jolie.  The two played off each other perfectly whether it was with comments or even looks which made the dark comedy moments great.The supporting cast is good, but very minimal.Vince Vaughn is in the role when he really does the best, as the sidekick wisecracking buddy.  Adam Brody of The OC fame and Jennifer Morrison from House and Once Upon a Time have small roles in the movie as well.  There are two great action scenes in the movie, one a total spoof on The War of the Roses, and the second a great car chase sequence.As far as extras on the special edition DVD goes, there are about 8 min of deleted scenes, and 8 min making of feature, and the trailers.  There are also three separate commentary tracks on the film from the various film makers.  Nothing too extensive, but okay for what is there.

930307,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000AP04EW,mirasreviews,"[1, 3]","""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is part shoot'em up action flick, part romantic comedy that succeeds on the charisma of its stars and on its humor. John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith met in Columbia five or six years previously and married after a whirlwind romance. Unbeknownst to each other, John and Jane are both professional assassins working for competing agencies. They lie to each other about their jobs, hide their unusual talents, and live a sedate suburban life. So sedate, in fact, that their marriage has gotten stale. That all changes when they are both assigned the same target. Now they're gunning for each other -which sure does spice up their marriage.Not surprisingly, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" doesn't make much sense. It's never clear why John and Jane want to kill each other or if they really do. But they make quite a show of it. I couldn't figure out if they worked for private or government agencies, which are equally unlikely given the sort of action in this film. Jane's injuries disappear between scenes. The high-tech gadgets are more comical than cool. But neither action films nor comedies stake their success on realism. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" realizes that, and director Doug Liman takes everything over the top. Even so, the action and cute banter would wear thin if the film didn't have 3 cycles in which John and Jane's situation changes. That shakes things up a bit and keeps the audience interested. There is a whole lot of violence in this movie purely for entertainment purposes. And it's not graphic; it's fun -which some people won't like. But ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is energetic fluff with 2 appealing stars bickering and shooting and generally looking like movie stars.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include one featurette, 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a teaser, a soundtrack promotional spot, and 3 audio commentaries. ""Making a Scene Featurette"" (8 minutes) is a short documentary from Fox Movie Channel about creating the action scene in which John and Jane first confront each other as Jane speeds away in her car. The thought of listening to 3 audio commentaries was so daunting that I didn't listen to any, so I will just say: The first commentary is by director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The second commentary is by producers Akiva Goldman and Lucas Foster. The third commentary is by editor Michael Tronick, production designer Jeff Mann, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Elam.

What neither of them knows is that they are both assasins, working for rival groups, and one day they are hired to off each other.  We see a series of events unfolding as they are off on their missions independently, then as their paths cross and realize they are not so boring after all.

First, romantic comedy is something I really don't like admitting to enjoying, (no matter how many guns they have). This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I had a real hoot watching it, (and many times since).The humour is verbal with some very good lines, but this is also made punchier by the plethora of situational gags exploiting the contexts they are used it. Sounds dull and dry the way I say it, but what it amounts to is a complex comedy that works. The tentative questions about ""how many"" are given a whole new twist with the Smiths.Pitt and Jolie have an on screen chemistry that works in most scenes. There are a couple of fizzled points, but for the most part, they really spark well and add to the laughs. Jolie's line ""Are you still alive, Baby?"" is a classic. Pitt once again demonstrates his ability for comedy, and Jolie also has a knack for it.Having two enemy assassins married to each other was an inspired innovation, and it really goes off with people like Pitt and Jolie in the lead roles. Vince Vaughn still plays much the same character as in other movies such asWedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)andDodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Widescreen Edition).

That is kind of true to their personal lives.Yes, Angelina's lips are way too large and sometimes that's all you see, but her character was self-assured, confident, smart and take no B.S. off anyone. Very refreshing coming from Hollywood which depicts women as wusses who turn their ankles in nearly every chase scene and must be carried out by the hero!I hated the ending.

The premise of the movie is this: John and Jane Smith, after five (or six) years of rather lackluster marriage, visit a marriage counselor for a ""tune-up."" During their session, they admit to keeping ""little secrets"" from one another. We later learn that they are both assassins for hire, maintaining a secret life apart from one another. Their professional worlds collide, however, when they are both assigned to the same hit.In the ensuing scenes, the couple realizes the duplicity of their marriage as both are assigned to kill each other. A few rollicking shoot outs later, the two decide that perhaps their union is worth saving after all, and they decide to flaunt their employers and fight for one another. (I realize that this plot is not exactly brain surgery. However, how many moody, wordy, deep dramas can one watch? Sometimes a little mindless entertainment is exactly what is needed.)Aside from the physical perfection of both Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) and Brad Pitt (John Smith), their on-screen chemistry is great. In addition to great physical work in this movie, they both flex their comedic muscles to great effect. (I loved lines like, ""You still alive down there, baby?"" What a hoot!) And while the story line follows a very familiar path, it is still fully enjoyable.While violent, the carnage in this movie is not particularly graphic; it lives up to its PG13 rating.

It's a clever concept, but it suffers from script problems, absurd action sequences, and gaping plot holes.  While Angelia Jolie and Brad Pitt work together well, their characters are empty ciphers.  They are so boring in the film that there doesn't seem to be much of a marriage worth saving, and you don't even really know how they could have stayed together long enough to figure out they were both contract killers.  Even then, why would their first instinct be to kill each other?  Who do they work for?  Is the same hit man agency employing them both?  That seems to be what's implied.  Wouldn't it be easier to tell them?  The idea of a Husband and Wife hit man team is infintiely better than what ended up on screen.  For that, we must balme the script, which relies entirely on it's own sense of cleverness to try and hold the floundering story together.  But the concept isn't enough.  Save for one car chase sequence, the movie never really captures any magic or true sense of fun.  It was designed to be fun, and that it is actually boring is what makes it even harder to stomach.  That Doug Liman, who so expertly crafted ""The Bourne Identity"" directed this thing is a tragedy.  The action set pieces are mostly generic, with the final store shoot out looking more like a video game montage.  The story movies from plot point to plot point without giving us any real reason to root for the Smiths, and by the time the entirely anticlamactic fianle shows up, I felt like I had been ripped off.

The movie that lingered in the background of the countless tabloid articles that graced our newstands. The movie that brought Brad Pitt together with Angelina Jolie and her kids. In fact, so many things have been surrounding this movie that people tend to miss one very important thing...simply put, this movie ROCKS!The movie's premise is pretty straightforward. A couple's marriage is on the rocks. But the fact that eludes both of them is that they are both assassins. One day however, Jane is asked to kill a target, that John is supposed to kill as well. They then learn the true identity of each another and because their cover is blown, are ordered to eliminate each other. The story ensues...The story is pretty simple. Hardly anything extremely intelligent or thought-provoking. One thing I loved about the movie however, was the on screen chemistry between not just the two leads, but everyone involved. It helps that the movie had some of the best, most sarcastic dialogue I've heard in a long time. The banter and quick quips between John and Jane was highly entertaining. They were a joy to watch. Doug Liman has been churning out great movies like Swingers, Go and The Bourne series and he continues the tradition here. He has a gift for identifying what the audience wants, and if you realize he has dabbled in movies from different genres and pulling them all off with his own style.The acting, especially between Brad and Jolie definitely made the movie much more than it actually was. The passion comes full force when they try to outdo and kill each other. There's a certain sensuality they bring to the characters. This is more sexy than romantic, and I'm not really surprised they fell for each other after the making of this movie. I don't know about real life, but they made a fantastic couple here, neither backing down and both exchanging creative insults. Add a healthy dosage of one of my favorite comedians of all time, Vince Vaughn and you already have a killer movie (no pun intended).Of course, the movie had it's share of absurdity and unrealistic action sequences, but Doug Liman knows this. That's why he never pretends to take the movie seriously because he knows it's all in the name of fun. And that's what makes the movie a blast.

But it's also one of those movies that, while you're watching it, you're having such a good time you just don't care.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as John and Jane Smith, have this great on-screen chemistry that's just irresistable. Even when they're beating the tar out of one another (and yes, they both get in some good licks), you get the feeling that they're enjoying every minute.As for the action, there's a lot of it, and it's great fun. From a car chase down a freeway involving three matching bulletproof BMW sedans chasing down a minivan, to some pretty serious indoor gunfights, including a final showdown with John and Jane Smith against just a small army of agents in a sporting goods store, it all flows together into a high-octane flow of visceral fun.The movie is quite funny as well, not only in the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but with some extra amusement supplied by Vince Vaughn, who plays up his role as John's irreverent friend and business partner. I was laughing almost all the way through, as I think was intended.My only real complaint (a minor one) was that I wished that the trailers for the movie had not given away so much of the premise. There's a full 30 minutes or so that is spent exploring the surface-level relationship of John and Jane Smith, in which you get only gradual hints to their ""other lives."" It would have been even more fun to have discovered this along the way, rather than going into the knowledge from the trailers of what the rest of the movie is about. But, that's more of a quibble with how the movie was marketed, not so much how it was made.In itself, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is exciting and fun. It's not a thinking-person's movie by any means, but just a movie to enjoy for what it is.

I don't see it honestly. These two did not in this film feel compatiable at all. I tried to see it, but I didn't. They just did not look like a belivable couple on- screen. They seemed like two over- hyped sex idols placed together in a film so critics can call it sexy as well as full of action and get a bunch of worshippers of these sex idols to come see the movie. And it works so well too, that's why they did it for they knew Pitt and Jolie had many worshippers.Yet honestly this movie was not good. It wasn't the most awful movie I had ever seen, and in the ending it did get somewhat better, but not enough. The beginning of the movie was drop dead boring, and again Brangelina did not to me make a belivable couple. I kept seeing nothing but two sex idols trying to look like the ultimate couple and it doesn't work honestly for me. Then shocker they're both liars and have secretive jobs where they use guns. The movie could have made it more interesting but they didn't. Like I said the ending got better- (especially when Brad and Angelina drop their guns and start fighting that is the only really good part of the movie)- but by then I was so bored of the lame jokes they made throughout the movie and all of a sudden they showing this great love for each other that seemed so forced that the movie couldn't be saved. If you cannot believe the relationship, and that is what the whole movie is centered on, then the movie is weak. And this movie is. I had good expectations for at least Pitt to carry out the movie well, as he usually does...but I don't know Pitt failed in this movie to me...too bad maybe next film Brad.But yeah I wanted to write this review to warn the readers that even though the plot sounds exciting- two highly paid sex idols given guns is not as good as it sounds.

Brad & Angelina are two high-priced contract killers - practically superheroes.  The biggest and baddest in the business, neither has any idea of the other's true identity.  It was only a matter of time before they crossed paths, but even odds that they would do so under circumstances that allowed each to stay secret from the other.  The joke is that neither of the two has a real life besides meting exotic forms of execution, so it's no surprise that their marriage is as sexless as the movie.  Eventually, they learn the truth, and become each other's highest-priced targets.  After they've destroyed just about everything else of their lives but each other, they realize that their own bosses aren't happy about their pairing, and will eagerly finish the two of them off if they can't oblige themselves.  Thus, we've got some car chase, lots of gunplay, and too many sub-machinegun-men-in-black to count.In varied parts, you can see that the producers of ""Smith"" intended to make a romantic comedy thriller - or parts of such movies rolled up into one.  Unfortunately, ""Smith"" fails at each juncture.  The action is canned - lots of obvious stunts that the script telegraphs or sometimes fails to telegraph at all.  (There's a raid on a courthouse in which it's virtually impossible to follow the action.)  Also, the screenplay has neglected to supply a convenient villain - the ""Hans Gruber"" that puts the human face on all those black-clad & sub machinegun-armed toadies.  All that inaction wouldn't hurt the story that much as the backdrop to a romantic comedy about the Smiths, but the leads have absolutely no chemistry - in fact, most of the time, it's hard to tell what they're even saying. They don't so much as speak their lines, but deliver them - which we can probably blame on a script that's already obviously in need of the leads' star-power.  In fact, ""Smith"" is so dependent on who's starring in it, that the whole thing begins to look like one of those movies that indie-moviemakers have been warning us about for years, the overpriced, over-cast, overproduced pure-Hollywood production about nothing.",1,"whatever you've expected, prepare for a disappointment",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,2362,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'suffered', 'E', 'specials', 'maybe', 'read', 'celebrity-worship', 'zines', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'yet', 'nothing', 'can', 'quite', 'prepare', 'just', 'how', 'plainly', 'nonsensically', 'unentertaining', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'really', 'Brad', 'Angelina', 'are', 'two', 'high-priced', 'contract', 'killers', 'practically', 'superheroes', 'biggest', 'baddest', 'business', 'idea', 'other', 'true', 'identity', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'crossed', 'paths', 'even', 'odds', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'circumstances', 'allowed', 'stay', 'secret', 'other', 'joke', 'two', 'real', 'life', 'meting', 'exotic', 'forms', 'execution', 'surprise', 'marriage', 'as', 'sexless', 'movie', 'Eventually', 'learn', 'truth', 'become', 'other', 'highest-priced', 'targets', ""'ve"", 'destroyed', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'lives', 'other', 'realize', 'own', 'bosses', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'pairing', 'will', 'eagerly', 'finish', 'two', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'oblige', 'Thus', ""'ve"", 'got', 'car', 'chase', 'lots', 'gunplay', 'too', 'many', 'sub-machinegun-men-in-black', 'count.In', 'varied', 'parts', 'can', 'see', 'producers', 'Smith', 'intended', 'make', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'parts', 'such', 'movies', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'Smith', 'juncture', 'action', 'canned', 'lots', 'obvious', 'stunts', 'script', 'telegraphs', 'sometimes', 'telegraph', 'raid', 'courthouse', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'follow', 'action', 'Also', 'screenplay', 'neglected', 'supply', 'convenient', 'villain', 'Hans', 'Gruber', 'human', 'face', 'black-clad', 'sub', 'machinegun-armed', 'toadies', 'inaction', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'story', 'much', 'backdrop', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Smiths', 'leads', 'have', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'fact', 'most', 'time', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'even', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'speak', 'lines', 'deliver', 'can', 'probably', 'blame', 'script', 'already', 'obviously', 'need', 'leads', 'star-power', 'fact', 'Smith', 'so', 'dependent', 'who', 'starring', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'one', 'movies', 'indie-moviemakers', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'years', 'overpriced', 'over-cast', 'overproduced', 'pure-Hollywood', 'production', 'nothing']",N/A

Whole chunks of the plot aren't just missing - they've gone fishing. Don't fool yourself: The end of this movie is some cobbled-together compromise of a disastrous shoot; it resolves nothing, it's about nothing and involves no clear villain. Whatever it is writer Simon Kinberg created with this script, director Doug Liman used about half of it. The rest is bullets, Pitt's blue slushie eyes and Jolie's alien physique. This puppy's ""Gigli"" with nifty guns.John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) have hit a lull in their marriage. They're bored with each other, predictably so, since they're contract killers for rival death squads and neither spouse knows the other's profession. Not-so-coincidentally they're led to the same place for the same job, after which they discover each other's identities. Then they fight, a lot, trash their house, blow it up, make up, and then realize they're bosses are targeting them. Cue up elaborate car chase and final showdown in, yes, a sporting goods store against a slew of masked men. End of picture.Once upon a time ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" starred Keith David and Angela Bassett as Jolie and Pitt's respective bosses. Their roles have been lopped off. Gone. Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington, the best friends, play no role in the final act. It could be said we have no idea who the masked men are in the final scene, or who hired them. They don't speak, they get shot. Movies aren't required to have plausible stories, but if a contract squad is after you, much less two, chances are they'd be a little more subtle about it than this.The leads have requisite chemistry, but this Jolie ""blue steel"" persona is getting a little old. Here's a woman with pedigree and talent wasting time as the ice queen in forgettable B-movies. Pitt slums, too - it's been six years since ""Fight Club"" - but he has a humor about it.

They aren't the typical driving through a busy street car chase kind of action scenes, which makes them interesting.  Plus you have two very attractive actors, who are very good at playing the role of super-spies.  The story was a little cheesy - two secret agents are married but they don't know their spouse is also a secret agent until they are pitted against each other in their missions - but you can forgive the cheesiness because it was a great movie.But the movie is funny, too!  To add a bit of humor, most action movies have really buff men making terrible plays on words, and it would have just been better to leave it out.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a bit more personality.  There is a plotline (though not exactly fleshed out) about their domestic relationship that adds a ton of humor that is actually funny!  I definitely laughed out loud multiple times during this movie.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are very funny people, and they carried the jokes off really well.

But since I don't deal with salacious news, I won't comment on any off the off screen happenings or the irony that the movie that stared Jennifer Aniston's future ex-husband also featured future (alleged) husband. Nope, not gonna talk about that kind of stuff.The plot features something I'm sure more than a few people can relate to with a married couple in a stale marriage that is filled with lies, except their lies are a lot bigger than most couples in that they both are hired assassins. In the beginning we spend some time watching their mundane lives which is, well mundane to watch.  Movies about assassins should never be boring at any point. Seriously, is it that hard when you run into a down spot to just randomly have a cut scene with some dude getting off-ed in some creative way?Another problem early in the film was the introduction of the Adam Brody from The O.C. as some random dude who seemed important and just disappeared. His storyline gets resolved late in the movie, but I spent the middle part wondering if I missed something. Also not given enough screen time was Vince Vaughn as ironically Pitt's buddy/co-worker. Another way they could have solved the mundane scenes was inject more Vaughn throughout the movie. At least he faired better compared to Jolie's buddies/co-workers who had less screen time and then had divide the time with four other actresses. How you don't exploit a group of female assassins in beyond me.But with all those complaints, when the movie did kick into high gear it was gripping. Each action sequence is more jam packed then the next all peppered with the right amount of humor and violence. This is highlighted by when the Smiths go after each other in there own home. And when they both lose their weapons there, the battle only gets better because well, guns are for wusses; real men (or women) will beat you down with their hands. There is also a great car chase where with a soundtrack of oddly enough of Making Love Out of Nothing at All (which the person I watch it with wrongly tried to argue Meatloaf when I said it was Air Supply; a lesson to all, never question my knowledge of cheesy music). Mr. and Mrs. Smith may have some down points but at the very least it's a good waste of ninety minutes.",3,"Wait, Why Do I Get the Girl Gun?",1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2418,"['movie', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'off', 'set', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'then', 'what', 'happened', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'deal', 'salacious', 'news', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'off', 'off', 'screen', 'happenings', 'irony', 'movie', 'stared', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'future', 'ex-husband', 'also', 'featured', 'future', 'alleged', 'husband', 'Nope', 'not', 'gon', 'talk', 'kind', 'stuff.The', 'plot', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'married', 'couple', 'stale', 'marriage', 'filled', 'lies', 'lies', 'are', 'lot', 'bigger', 'most', 'couples', 'are', 'hired', 'assassins', 'beginning', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'mundane', 'lives', 'well', 'mundane', 'watch', 'Movies', 'assassins', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'boring', 'point', 'Seriously', 'hard', 'when', 'run', 'down', 'spot', 'just', 'randomly', 'have', 'cut', 'scene', 'dude', 'getting', 'off-ed', 'creative', 'way', 'problem', 'early', 'film', 'was', 'introduction', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'O.C', 'random', 'dude', 'who', 'seemed', 'important', 'just', 'disappeared', 'storyline', 'resolved', 'late', 'movie', 'spent', 'middle', 'part', 'wondering', 'missed', 'something', 'Also', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'ironically', 'Pitt', 'buddy/co-worker', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'solved', 'mundane', 'scenes', 'was', 'inject', 'more', 'Vaughn', 'movie', 'least', 'faired', 'better', 'compared', 'Jolie', 'buddies/co-workers', 'who', 'had', 'screen', 'time', 'then', 'had', 'time', 'four', 'other', 'actresses', 'How', 'do', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'group', 'female', 'assassins', 'me.But', 'complaints', 'when', 'movie', 'did', 'kick', 'high', 'gear', 'was', 'gripping', 'action', 'sequence', 'more', 'jam', 'packed', 'then', 'next', 'peppered', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'violence', 'highlighted', 'when', 'Smiths', 'go', 'other', 'own', 'home', 'when', 'lose', 'weapons', 'there', 'battle', 'only', 'better', 'because', 'well', 'guns', 'are', 'wusses', 'real', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'beat', 'down', 'hands', 'also', 'great', 'car', 'chase', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Making', 'Love', 'Out', 'Nothing', 'All', 'person', 'watch', 'wrongly', 'tried', 'argue', 'Meatloaf', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'Air', 'Supply', 'lesson', 'never', 'question', 'knowledge', 'cheesy', 'music', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'may', 'have', 'down', 'points', 'very', 'least', 'good', 'waste', 'ninety', 'minutes']",N/A

Then it turns into a sexy dark comedy and action romp that never looses sight of the relationship.The unrated version sticks more to exploring the relationship.  Two examples, the scenes exploring the sparks when they meet are longer and the scene when you see them together after you find out they are both assassins is different.  In the unrated version you see them both dressed for the neighbors party waiting outside the door a typical bored married couple with nothing to say to each other.  In the theater release instead of this you have a shot of Angelina almost being caught in her sexy domanatrix costume.  The unrated scene works better because the audience knows they have so much in common and would be connected if they only knew about their common profession.This movie blends genres not unlike Beverly Hills Cop I and II or War of the Roses.

I watched until within about 10-15 minutes of the end, when I finally just couldn't take it anymore and had to turn it off. It is pretty darn bad when I of all people turn a movie off, especially one I was looking forward to seeing. I am puzzled as to why an actor and actress of Angelina & Brad's status and talent would even take on such a stupid, predictable and unrealistic flick.Angelina Jolie portrays a sickeningly perfect working wife who juggles her high profile job as a vixen mercernary (which she lies to her husband about, as he does her) and keeps a sickeningly perfect house and puts stiff, formal 5-star resturaunt meals on the table for her husband every night, complete with the mundane, meaningless conversation of two sexpot acquaintances with their oh-so-perfect life gone wrong. Think ""American Beauty"" marriage with passion and sex and lies about things as important as what the couple does for a living.Then there is the supposedly hot ""make up sex"" scene between Pitt and Jolie at the end where their whole multi-million dollar mansion along with the very expensive furnishings and pricey green drapes is blown up to smithereens, and all they can think of is getting it on, tacky pick up lines and all. All as a result of their stupid coincidental misunderstanding and mistrust of one another. When they are tearing each other's clothes off after days of trying to kill each other and destroying their magnificent home as a result is just too much for me. This is the point where the television gets switched to ""off"".I am not a picky movie person, but this was a waste of the $5 I spent on the movie rental for it.The bottom line? This is a stupid, predictable, unrealistic movie in extremely bad taste with a mediocre script and famous actors.

At night, the two are opposing international spies, jetting across the globe killing bad guys, trying to make it home before dinner. When a routine hit goes wrong, and John and Jane's double lives are revealed, the two go on the defensive, looking to kill each other out of fear of betrayal. However, when a death warrant is put on the couple, they must set aside their differences to stay alive, reengaging their passion for each other in the process.  It is an insipid idea for a film, yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals and as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal, the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a ""wouldn't it be cool if ..."" moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a ""James Bond"" movie, the result is like ""The War of the Roses"" on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent.As the Smiths, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry, most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. But as they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions, gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then, even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths, the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to, but totally failing at, explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.  Ultimately, the film has no real point, as it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss (marriage, suburban home, mini-van, etc. ) one suspects that the original screenplay for ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" hoped to join the ranks of ""The War of the Roses""; ""Divorce"",  and even ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions, with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics.

930413,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AP04EW,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","The brief opening scenes are reminiscent of one romantic comedy. Probably you know the film. The scene is similar to the delightful conversations by the married couples talking directly to the camera about their marraiage. Yes, it's `When Harry Met Sally.' In `Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' however, we see how the husband and wife rekindle their love by trying to kill one another.[IT'S JUST A COMEDY] Maybe you have heard many times that `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is an action film. It is true that there are several (perhaps one too many) explosions and a few shoot-outs, and one car chase sequence, but few of them are intended as hair-raising thrills. Director Doug Liman has an explicit goal of making the entire film not too serious about itself, even though the two central characters, married couple of professional assassins, attempt to kill each other after knowing the truths about their spouses.`Mr. & Mrs. Smith' looks like curious mixture of `Prizzi's Honor' and `The War of the Roses.' This Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt film is sexier than those two films, but it has no darker tone of the former film, and less farcical touch of the latter.Now I am not complaining. `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has often disarmingly charming characters Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Pitt and Jolie, and Mr. Smith's co-worker Vince Vaughn. I believe Angelina Jolie is still looking for a better script to do, and Pitt is just being Pitt himself - nice guy, really down-to-earth - but he doesn't need to explore the darker side as in `12 Monkeys.'

However, sentiment for the film will remain high because MR. AND MRS. SMITH will always be looked upon as the film that brought stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together (despite having probably been involved together before working on the production).  The film opens with John and Jane Smith (Pitt and Jolie) discussing their life together and looking back on the rather bored domesticity they shared in the early years of their marriage.  Originally they found each other attractive and compatible.  But, more importantly, the marriage was a convenience for both John and Jane are top international assassins.  Their relationship enters completely different territory when both John and Jane are both sent to assassinate the same target.  They end up getting in each others' way and the man they were sent to assassinate gets away.  They vow to get rid of the other assassin.  Upon discovering that they are trying to kill each other, John and Jane have to decide whether the love they have for each other is real and worth fighting for or to keep fighting until they kill each other.MR. AND MRS. SMITH is slightly better than the usual action flick.  Much of this is because of the film's stars.  As much as I hate to admit it, Brad Pitt is a decent actor and Angelina Jolie is not a terrible actress.  They are both known more for their looks than their talent, but unlike many of the pretty faces that show up in movies they have some acting chops.  However, looks and talent aside, the real reason that MR.AND MRS. SMITH stands out from other similar action movies is because of the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie.  The weakest scenes in the movie are when their characters try to prevent each other from finding out what they really do for a living and when each of their characters ""struggles"" with how they feel for each other.  They like each other.  They like each other a lot and their passion is white smoking hot.Not being a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, MR. AND MRS. SMITH wasn't a film I was very excited to watch.  I will admit that it was slightly better than I thought it would be.  The story isn't especially strong and there are some scenes that make many James Bond films seem plausible and realistic.  The acting is much better than in many action flicks.  I especially enjoyed Vince Vaughn's supporting role as one of John's co-workers, Eddie.  Even though I know most will be drawn to the film because of either Pitt or Jolie or both, I was more impressed with the secondary actors in the film.  Unfortunately, they receive very little screen time at all.  Highly recommended for fans of Pitt and Jolie.

Vince Vaughn was his usual motormouth funny self as Brad Pitts sidekick. I liked the concept too. Two spys/assassins from different companies who are living a cover of happily married people with neither knowing the other is what he/she is. I also loved the fact that they were boring, bored repressed married people who when they found out the truth found out they had a lot in common. One of those things being that they got a rush and sexual thrill out of taking out their frustrations on each other while beating the *ell out of each other. And while this is all going on they find that they are more attracted and turned on than they have ever been to one another and that they are secretly soulmates and they didn't even know it.Brad Pitt does his usual good job and adds that little goofey funny stuff that is just hilarious along with his maniacle strange laugh that is just great. Jolie is perfect for the role in that she can play the button up frustrated tight *ss house wife who has the evil, wicked, sex kitten underneath.

It's simply a fun and entertaining movie. That was what it was meant to be, nothing more or less. Angelina and Brad were a great match for this film, they have awesome chemistry, and there is plenty of action and violence if you are interested in that kind of thing. However, I don't think this movie necessarily had to be 2 hours long! At first the plot of the movie was funny, interesting, and very amusing. But then I couldn't help but feel as if the movie was one big joke that was milking its punch line for all its worth. The story seems to drag along, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith's bickering, sly remarks, and attempts at killing each other (literally) starts to get old, boring, and a tad bit overdone and ridiculous. And some parts of the movie seemed to be confusing and rushed as well. First they hate each other, than act nice with each other (after nearly 20 mins of them trying to shoot and cut each others throat!), then chase each other in speeding cars, and so on. It gets exhausting and boring very quickly. But despite its flaws, you have to give the screenwriters credit for at least making the attempt to write an original action film. And it is a fun movie either way.

Rogers,"[3, 17]","First, I didn't see Mr. & Mrs. Smith at the theater, but I did see a particular trailer to the movie which showed Angelina Jolie putting on a pair of nylon stockings.  That scene in the trailer (I don't know if it was actually in the theatrical release or not) is pretty much the only reason I purchased the video.  To the young, middle-aged, and old guys out there like me who may also be buying the video for the same reason, the scene has been cut, or deleted.  Now, all you see is Angelina walking around in a white bra and half-slip.  Of course, you can see the garter tabs and the tops of the stockings through the slip when she stands in the light.  You can also see a brief still of her adjusting one of the garters in the ""Making of a Scene"" feature.  I hate it when the director, or studio, does this to the male fans!  I've never forgiven Lawrence Kasdan for a scene he cut out of Body Heat, and that was twenty-five years ago.  My guess is that a longer version of the video (Director's Cut, Special Edition, Collector's Edition, New Extended Edition, etc.) will be out in six-to-eight months so that the guys will buy the new version in the hope of seeing the beautiful Angelina putting on her nylons.  Most women have never understood what a powerful affect that has on a male.  As to the rest of the movie, rent it, or wait till the longer version comes out.  There's no resolution at the end with regards to the killers that are sent out after this couple and what the CIA's final solution is to the problem.  I suspect an Alternate Ending will be attached to the newer version in a few months.  I will say that the bantering between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt was fun to watch.

If you just want to kill a few hours, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are the ones to do the job for you.//wiredweird",4,Great action/comedy,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,1040,"['one', 'Hollywood', 'freakier', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'inserting', 'genes', 'domestic', 'comedy', 'DNA', 'action', 'thriller', 'real', 'surprise', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'viable', 'lively', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'keep', 'moving', 'humor', 'over-familiar', 'couple', 'what', 'really', 'worthwhile', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'coupled', 'more', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'recognize', 'signs', 'affectionate', 'gestures', 'so', 'habitual', ""'re"", 'almost', 'invisible', 'not-quite-listening', 'most', 'what', 'said', 'daily', 'routine', 'rut', 'little', 'secrets', 'keep', 'other', 'ill', 'intent', 'there', 'just', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'other', 'worry', 'about', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'harder', 'discuss', ""'re"", 'worth', 'example', 'little', 'thing', 'international', 'assassinations', 'are', 'grand', 'themes', 'here', 'just', 'entertainment', 'lots', 'action', 'enough', 'wit', 'keep', 'paying', 'attention', 'just', 'want', 'kill', 'few', 'hours', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'are', 'ones', 'do', 'job', 'you.//wiredweird']",N/A

The dialog tries to be snappy but came off to me as forced.  And the acting, well, both stars seemed to walk through their parts.  Jolie as Mrs. Smith just gives us her Laura Croft character and where, oh where, is that over the top acting the Brad Pitt does so well?  Both actors needed to crank it up a notch and give us some sizzle.The writer and director's gimmick of having the couple appear before a marriage counselor recaps the wonderful ""When Harry Met Sally"".  Yet it fails at humor.  Where there was chemistry between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, there is ho-hum between Pitt and Jolie.Then there is the fight scene.  I don't think I'm giving much away because this part has been in the media.  I have rarely seen a more vicious and bad humored physical encounter between a man and a woman on screen; and this occurs in a movie which is trying to be tongue in cheek, if not actually humorous!  This would have been a great moment for a slapstick fight and some of those wonderful facial expressions that both Pitt and Jolie do really well.  This would have portrayed a couple who were angry but still in love.I wish I could find something to complement about the film.  Alas, the picture of Pitt and Jolie on the DVD box is better than the movie itself.",2,"Actually, I like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,1359,"['Actually', 'like', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'dialog', 'be', 'snappy', 'came', 'off', 'forced', 'acting', 'well', 'stars', 'seemed', 'walk', 'parts', 'Jolie', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'just', 'Laura', 'Croft', 'character', 'where', 'oh', 'where', 'top', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'so', 'well', 'actors', 'needed', 'crank', 'up', 'notch', 'give', 'sizzle.The', 'writer', 'director', 'gimmick', 'having', 'couple', 'appear', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'wonderful', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'humor', 'Where', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'ho-hum', 'Pitt', 'Jolie.Then', 'fight', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'part', 'been', 'media', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'more', 'vicious', 'bad', 'humored', 'physical', 'encounter', 'man', 'woman', 'screen', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'not', 'actually', 'humorous', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'moment', 'slapstick', 'fight', 'wonderful', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'do', 'really', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'portrayed', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'angry', 'still', 'love.I', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'something', 'complement', 'film', 'Alas', 'picture', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', 'DVD', 'box', 'better', 'movie']",N/A
