1566959,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUS5A,,"[0, 0]","Catching Fire is the second installment in the Hunger Games franchise.  Catching Fire, in my opinion, is a touch better than The Hunger Games, but still not without its notable issues.  I have many of the same problems with this film that I had with The Hunger Games.  I did not read the books so I cannot make any comparisons but I did hear that they cut a lot out.The film takes place a year after The Hunger Games.  Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her friend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who were the victors of the last Hunger Games are on tour of all the Districts.  Everyone sees Katniss as a light of hope due to her actions in the Hunger Games.  Rebellions start to break out in all of the Districts.  The president, played by Donald Sutherland is not happy about this, because this could trigger a full-scale revolution.  He tries to get Katniss to her side.  Katniss herself does not want to be a symbol and only wishes to keep her and her family safe.  However, the president forces her and Peeta to participate in the 75th Hunger Games.  This time the victors of previous games will face off.The first issue I have is with the first 30-45 minutes.  I personally found it a little boring.  The first 45 minutes is Katniss and Peeta on tour and her being a symbol of hope for the people while trying to please the president so he does not kill everyone in her District.  I know why it is there, but I just got a little bored after a while.  I heard in the book that plotline took even longer.  However once they announce the Hunger Games and we are introduced to the other combatants then things pick up again.  I did not find the first part of this film quite as boring as the first part of the Hunger Games.  I found the first part of the Hunger Games to drag on a bit too long and it is clich&eacute;.  It was not bad, but it was too long.  Here I was less bored.Another issue I had was the shaky-cam during the fight scenes.  I had this problem with the Hunger Games as well.  During the fights the camera moves too much and I could barely make out what was happening.  In fact I found there to be more shaky came here than the Hunger Games.Aside from Katniss and Peeta, the rest of the cast gets very little development, like in the last film.  However, I did like the supporting cast more here and they get a bit of development, which is more than I can say for Hunger Games.  I also found that the ending was too abrupt.However, despite all of that Catching Fire is still a good film and I do like it a bit more than the Hunger Games.  The main reason is that the story is stronger.  The Hunger Games mainly focused on introducing us to the character and setting up the world.  It mostly focused on the games themselves.  Here it focuses more on Katniss herself and her being a symbol of hope for the people.  It also deals with the inevitable revolution and introduces key characters that are relevant later.  I also like the supporting cast more.  I felt that they had more life and energy even if they do not have much development.  I also like the design of the actual games more this time around as well.  Some of the obstacles they put in are very creative.The effects are amazing.  Again the design and obstacles of the Hunger Games itself are very well done.  I like how there is more future tech used here.  The world they are in still looks amazing.  I did not see this movie in 3D so I cannot say how good the 3D is.Overall, if you like the Hunger Games, then you should like Catching Fire.  I did like the Hunger Games quite a bit despite everything I said about it earlier.  I did think that this was a good film as well despite the problems I had.  The effects are great, the cast is great, and the acting is on point.",4,Better Than the First One!,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,3745,"['Catching', 'Fire', 'second', 'installment', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'franchise', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'opinion', 'touch', 'better', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'still', 'not', 'notable', 'issues', 'have', 'many', 'same', 'problems', 'film', 'had', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'comparisons', 'did', 'hear', 'cut', 'lot', 'out.The', 'film', 'place', 'year', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Katniss', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'friend', 'Peeta', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'were', 'victors', 'last', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'tour', 'Districts', 'Everyone', 'Katniss', 'light', 'hope', 'due', 'actions', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Rebellions', 'start', 'break', 'out', 'Districts', 'president', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'not', 'happy', 'could', 'trigger', 'full-scale', 'revolution', 'get', 'Katniss', 'side', 'Katniss', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'symbol', 'only', 'wishes', 'keep', 'family', 'safe', 'However', 'president', 'Peeta', 'participate', '75th', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'time', 'victors', 'previous', 'games', 'will', 'face', 'first', 'issue', 'have', 'first', '30-45', 'minutes', 'personally', 'found', 'little', 'boring', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'tour', 'being', 'symbol', 'hope', 'people', 'trying', 'please', 'president', 'so', 'not', 'kill', 'everyone', 'District', 'know', 'why', 'there', 'just', 'got', 'little', 'bored', 'while', 'heard', 'book', 'plotline', 'took', 'even', 'longer', 'However', 'once', 'announce', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'introduced', 'other', 'combatants', 'then', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'quite', 'as', 'boring', 'first', 'part', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'found', 'first', 'part', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'drag', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'Here', 'was', 'less', 'bored.Another', 'issue', 'had', 'was', 'shaky-cam', 'fight', 'scenes', 'had', 'problem', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'as', 'well', 'fights', 'camera', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'barely', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'fact', 'found', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'shaky', 'came', 'here', 'Hunger', 'Games.Aside', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'little', 'development', 'last', 'film', 'However', 'did', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'here', 'get', 'bit', 'development', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'also', 'found', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'abrupt.However', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'do', 'bit', 'more', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'main', 'reason', 'story', 'stronger', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'mainly', 'focused', 'introducing', 'character', 'setting', 'up', 'world', 'mostly', 'focused', 'games', 'Here', 'more', 'Katniss', 'herself', 'being', 'symbol', 'hope', 'people', 'also', 'inevitable', 'revolution', 'introduces', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'relevant', 'later', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'felt', 'had', 'more', 'life', 'energy', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'development', 'also', 'design', 'actual', 'games', 'more', 'time', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'obstacles', 'put', 'are', 'very', 'creative.The', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'Again', 'design', 'obstacles', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'how', 'more', 'future', 'tech', 'used', 'here', 'world', 'are', 'still', 'amazing', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', '3D', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'good', '3D', 'is.Overall', 'like', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'did', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'quite', 'bit', 'everything', 'said', 'earlier', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'problems', 'had', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'acting', 'point']",N/A
1566960,A1R3ADS1PGTH9Q,B008JFUS5A,,"[0, 0]","Catching Fire the movie was so much better than Catching Fire the novel (and I have never in my life said anything like that before!  The movie is almost always never better than the novel).  That&#8217;s not to say that the novel wasn&#8217;t good, however some of the problems with the novel version weren&#8217;t introduced in the theatrical version; in the novel Katniss became such a cry baby &#8211; someone who kills to survive and is the leader of her household should not have been so easily blindsided when it came to the Capital.  Also, banging your head crying over unrequited love (maybe unrequired love because she still doesn&#8217;t know which love she wants) is eye-rolling over dramatic.All that aside, since the filmmakers didn&#8217;t introduce those blaring character discrepancies into the movie, I really enjoyed Catching Fire.  Jennifer Lawrence has proved again that she is perfect as Katniss &#8211; so much so, that I prefer her portrayal of Katniss better than Suzanne Collin&#8217;s rendition of Katniss.  The other actors (Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, Liam Hemsworth as Gale and Jenna Malone as Johanna) are absolutely solid.  Jenna Malone&#8217;s portrayal of Johanna actually made me empathize with her character (empathy was not something Johanna eluded in the novel).  The scenes where the citizens of the Districts risked life and limb to give Katniss the show of solidarity was emotionally stirring &#8211; because you could feel the oppressive nature of the Capital&#8217;s governing.I highly recommend this movie (I also recommend the book.  It is still a really good read).  I am so glad that with the Hunger Games franchise we are presented with a heroine who is strong (but not superwoman), smart and kind.  I will say that the &#8220;who will she pick scenario&#8221; is tired and makes Katniss selfish (since she&#8217;s placing two other people&#8217;s feelings on hold while she decides which one she wants).",4,Better than the book!,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,1950,"['Catching', 'Fire', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'novel', 'have', 'never', 'life', 'said', 'anything', 'movie', 'almost', 'always', 'never', 'better', 'novel', '8217', 'not', 'say', 'novel', 'wasn', '8217', 'good', 'however', 'problems', 'novel', 'version', 'weren', '8217', 't', 'introduced', 'theatrical', 'version', 'novel', 'Katniss', 'became', 'such', 'cry', 'baby', '8211', 'someone', 'who', 'survive', 'leader', 'household', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easily', 'blindsided', 'when', 'came', 'Capital', 'Also', 'banging', 'head', 'crying', 'unrequited', 'love', 'maybe', 'unrequired', 'love', 'still', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'know', 'love', 'eye-rolling', 'dramatic.All', 'aside', 'filmmakers', 'didn', '8217', 'introduce', 'blaring', 'character', 'discrepancies', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'proved', 'again', 'perfect', 'Katniss', '8211', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'prefer', 'portrayal', 'Katniss', 'better', 'Suzanne', 'Collin', '8217', 's', 'rendition', 'Katniss', 'other', 'actors', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Peeta', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Gale', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'Johanna', 'are', 'absolutely', 'solid', 'Jenna', 'Malone', '8217', 'portrayal', 'Johanna', 'actually', 'made', 'empathize', 'character', 'empathy', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'Johanna', 'eluded', 'novel', 'scenes', 'where', 'citizens', 'Districts', 'risked', 'life', 'limb', 'give', 'Katniss', 'show', 'solidarity', 'was', 'emotionally', 'stirring', '8211', 'could', 'feel', 'oppressive', 'nature', 'Capital', '8217', 'governing.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'also', 'recommend', 'book', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'read', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'franchise', 'are', 'presented', 'heroine', 'who', 'strong', 'not', 'superwoman', 'smart', 'kind', 'will', 'say', '8220', 'who', 'will', 'pick', 'scenario', '8221', 'tired', 'Katniss', 'selfish', '8217', 'placing', 'two', 'other', 'people', '8217', 's', 'feelings', 'hold', 'one']",N/A

1567017,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008JFUS5A,,"[0, 0]","People gonna rise up and take what's theirs. They're talkin' bout a revolution. It sounds like... a mockingjay.I found this second, more serious and much darker &#34;Hunger Games&#34; film, even BETTER than the first one. Below more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.First let's say that this film sticks to the book very closely. Of course there is no way you can show during 145 minutes everything that a book contains (and therefore the character of Bonnie and Twill among others are not shown), but I believe virtually everything important is included. And that is a precious thing.All actors did great. Jennifer Lawrence who plays Katniss Everdeen is of course THE STAR of this film, but everybody around her performed also flawlessly.The best performance is offered by Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta Mellark, a young boy madly in love with Katniss and linked to her by most complex links since a long time. This role is the most difficult in all film as Peeta is a most complex character: a baker's son, weaker than many of other young males around and definitely not born to be any kind of hero he nevertheless soldiers on through all the hardships and relentlessly pursues the woman of his life through all the nine circles of hell - and beyond...Much more attractive, stronger and very manly Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsowrth) is by comparison a little bit easier to play, but the events put him also in a position not easy at all... All of this gives a quite interesting love triangle.Young actors who play new characters of Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) were very well selected. He is an extremely handsome and very vain young hunk - with brains and a plan. She is not very appealing physically, but she got enough character, potty mouth and (bad)attitude to spread amongst a battalion of more average girls - and still have enough for her own needs...)))Older actors give also a great show and we have a lot of them. Donald Sutherland is of course the greatest of them and we all know how much he enjoys playing characters which are odd and also sometimes evil - and here he gives us a great show portraying the aged supreme master of Panem, president Coriolanus Snow, a man both odd AND evil... Haymitch has more screen time in this film than in the previous one and Woody Harrelson plays him splendidly - and that is a huge compliment coming from me as I usually don't like this actor. At all.Effie Trinket (a really splendid and so appropriate last name by the way) also appears more in this film and we come to know her as a person who is similarly grievously annoying, heavily ridiculous, enragingly insufferable and beautifully pathetic - and Elizabeth Banks plays her just like it should be done. Lenny Kravitz offers a surprisingly good and serious performance as Cinna. Stanley Tucci is of course a treasure as Caesar Flickerman, a TV show host and great regime propagandist whom we want to strangle from the second he appears on the screen...)))And last but not least there is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head Gamemaker of 75th Hunger Games, successor of the most unfortunate Seneca Crane who &#34;choose to stop breathing&#34; in the previous film...In smaller but important roles we have Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny from &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34;) as Wiress and Lynn Cohen (Ukrainian baby sitter Magda in &#34;Sex and the city&#34;) as Mags. And also Patrick St. Esprit as Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Honestly, as dissuasion and pacification tools go, the face of this guy alone is worth a whole Panzer division - and then there is still all the rest of him...A digression here about Peacemakers in general and their weapons. First, it was a great idea (and I think also a tribute to Star Wars) to follow George Lucas and dress the bad guys in white...))) Also, firearms maniacs will appreciate the Peacemakers being armed with Belgian 5,7 mm FNP90, an indeed very futuristic looking weapon, but actually in service since 1990 and presently used by more than 40 countries. This weapon, which has a rate of fire so high that it is possible to cut a man in half with a short burst, was actually used by the troops of one bloodthirsty tyrant, overthrown and killed by insurgents - Muammar Gaddafi... End of digression.Willow Shields who plays Primrose Everdeen appears only briefly and her character has in fact only one line to say - but when says it, this is a GREAT moment! And then there is little Erika Bierman, barely 12 years old (but looking 9), who plays president's Snow granddaughter, a lovely little thing who speaks only like twice in this film, every time hurting and scaring her dear Grandpa worse than ten thousands armed rebels could ever do...)))Although not appearing as a character, in this film there is also Rue, the cute little girl from District 11. As we know she was killed in the previous games - but her picture appears in a couple of moments in this film an every time it does so it is an indictment of the Capitol, stronger than an 10 000 words accusation act...The Arena built for those very special 75th Hunger Games is a really hellish place. Suzan Collins must be quite a kinky gal for inventing such a perversely twisted tool of torture and murder... The whole games are therefore a pretty dramatic thing, albeit ultimately not as dramatic as those portrayed in the previous film (guess we are now more used to the whole thing).But the reason why I believe this film is SUPERIOR to the previous one resides in all parts which take place BEFORE the games themselves - and they constitute more than half of the film. The feeling of omnipresent TERROR all around the Panem is portrayed very well indeed - and all those who, like me, once lived under an authoritarian repressive regime (I grew up in communist Poland) will fully appreciate it.The mixture of oppression, repression, censorship, shortage of everything when in the same time regime's nomenklatura lives in opulence, black market as a coping mechanism, the violence of little local tyrants serving the regime, the feeling of powerlessness - it is all there. And then come the whispers of something going on, then some official flags are ripped off at night, then appears the first writing on the wall, the first stone is thrown against a patrolling police car, first signs of rebellion appear and with them HOPE - but also the first dead... It is all there.The second &#34;Hunger Games&#34; is therefore for my personal taste a darker, more serious (sometimes even sinister) treat, very usefully reminding especially the younger viewers what exactly an oppressive regime LOOKS and FEELS like and how difficult and COSTLY it is to regain the freedom once it was lost - or even worse forfeited... And this part of the film definitely overshadows the adventure/action scenes and any kind of love triangle.The very LAST scene, not involving any actors but just some graphics, is simply GREAT and so full of promise for the next film that I simply cannot wait to see it - and see it I will, as surely as I will buy this one on DVD, as soon as it is available. Definitely. Catch this film as long as it is still playing in theaters - it is worth it. Enjoy!",5,People gonna rise up and take what's theirs. They're talkin' bout a revolution.

The main actors, Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence, were even better in this film than they were in the first Hunger Games film. Two years I had been waiting to see this movie, and it was well worth the wait!As with the first Hunger Games film, not all parts of the book could be included in the movie, and some things were changed. I think that the biggest or most obvious change would be the reason why the Head Peacekeeper whipped Gale. In the book, it is because he was caught hunting illegally, but in the film, it was because he interfered with a Peacekeeper who was trying to harm another citizen for breaking a rule. Gale is certainly not my favorite character, but I gained respect for him in that moment of the film because what he did, knowing that he would be punished severely for it, was a very unselfish thing to do.Sam Claflin was perfect for the role of Finnick! He made the 'beautiful darling of the Capitol' truly come alive. Seeing Sam as Finnick made me appreciate and love his character even more, and now I am dreading what might be done to him in the Mockingjay films.I also loved the subtle humor in the film. I couldn't believe it when Effie pointed out mahogany when she was inside President Snow's mansion! A very small yet amusing reference back to the first Hunger Games film. And when Plutarch Heavensbee was introduced to Peeta and Katniss as 'the successor to Seneca Crane' and Peeta said &#34;that's a tough act to follow!&#34; I had to laugh! I had not expected a comment dripping with sarcasm but at the same time dripping with truth to come from Peeta.Once again, this film exceeded my expectations, and now it is going to be very difficult to wait to see the Mockingjay films!

1567051,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008JFUS5A,,"[0, 3]","Story similar to the first: same gruff, self-sacrificing heroine, this time it is Peeta who must live no matter what, as lead experiences the bounty of loving and being loved by two fine young men; same villain, this time displaying hints of paranoid insanity (never like when the villain is insane, just doesn't work for me), a new group of killers supposedly pitted against one another in a new game. A main problem for me is film doesn't show how the rebellion got it's key players and how they're organized. Another problem is the villain: how did the rebels manage to survive the Donald Sutherland character's hyper-vigilant eye, right under his nose.  Also, don't think it's a good idea to have the lead outside the story, i.e., ignorant of the rebellion; she should be in the thick of the rebellion as the Capitol is making her life and the lives of all she knows, hell.Because this story presented the rebellion as a fate accompli and didn't show the nuts and bolts of how it came to exist, rebellion not believable.The film story is missing a level in the Capitol's hierarchy, the character who would be Donald Sutherland's aid, the first officer, the person who'd actually enforce Donald Sutherland's edicts.  Donald Sutherland's organization is too thinly presented here. Where are his spies, where are the citizens wanting to curry favor, and do so by presenting him with any morsel of intel? No Capitol intrigue, no Capitol competitors josling for position. Where are the ambitious characters who, knowing the Donald Sutherland character dislikes Katniss, attempt to have her killed to get into his good graces? As presented there seems to be Donald Sutherland, and the military; he appears alone at the top: isolated, old, crazy, vulnerable, cruel and ruthless - such a leader seems ripe for rebellion, but worse storywise, he's not frightening (as he doesn't even know who his own enemies are) or believable. What is the source of his power that he can hold all the presumably millions of people to a system which clearly serves so few of them? This is crucial information the screenwriter fails to provide.As written, the Donald Sutherland character doesn't work, for me, as a villain: he's not smart - he unknowingly chooses a games master who is plotting his downfall, yet he spends his time bullying a teenager and murdering and terrifying untold numbers of citizens.  Why is he the ruler, what is the source of his power, why has he organized his world and his people the way that he has, and why is his behavior tolerated?  The screenwriter doesn't say.  The villain is paranoid and crazy, but a power mad, insane villain is lazy writing. It begs the question, how does he remain in power? And when the screenwriter provides no answer the audience disconnects.A competent villain, someone who is frightening and intelligent, is at the top of their game. As played, I wonder why this villain has remained in power.  Why 13 districts, why some held in abject poverty while others live in luxury, what purpose that serves, and why the majority of the citizens on that world accept the system? I understand why the poor, disenfranchised do, they have little choice, but why everyone else seems to is a mystery to me. So I guess what I'm saying is the world order in the story makes no sense to me, and it's never a good thing when the story makes no sense.Regarding Katniss she is aided time and again and in a more believable story she'd have been murdered long ago by Donald Sutherland's assassins, considering his power, his fixation on her and his total antipathy towards her.  Since apparently she's going to be the rallying point for her people, a source of hope, not a good idea storywise to have her come to the attention of her far more powerful competitor when she has little more than a bow and arrows to defend her. My sense is she's alive in this story because she's the heroine (sort of like in a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible film where the Tom Cruise character performs impossible stunts and get's perhaps a scratch and survives because he's the hero - Katniss is like a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible lead here). Film stories where the lead survives impossible odds simply because they've got top billing don't work for me - prefer better written stories. (I like Tom Cruise's work, just not a big fan of the Mission Impossible franchise because the lead is never at risk: he's the hero, he will survive. Similar problem with the Fast & Furious franchise's over the top stunts where it's impossible for two characters to be ejected from two speeding vehicles, meet in midair over a bridge and land safely. When humans repeatedly survive death defying stunts, I'm pushed right out of the story, even when the actresses/actors themselves are appealing. There's not enough appeal in the world to explain survival when an ordinary person experiencing such events would die. The leads, if they are human characters and not magical beings, simply don't have the skill set to defeat death, no matter what other talents they possess. I wish screenwriters would make their fictitious worlds operate along the same lines of reality as my world. When they don't, I'm unable to enjoy the story.)A young female lead works best in a well written, well structured, well executed, story. This film is none of those. It's strength is it's actresses/actors. Also good costume design, set design and cinematography.",3,where's the villain's posse?

How to deal with that issue, and that for poor Peeta it wasn't an act, is unfortunately the least of her problems.  Intentionally or not, Katniss has become the face of the resistance, and President Snow feels that she has to be neutralized.The fact that the next Game is going to be a ""Quarter Quell"", meaning a special event which occurs every twenty five years and for which the rules are altered for the occasion, gives Snow an opening.  He declares that the next reaping will consist of past victors - forcing Katniss into automatic competition as the only surviving female victor of her district.  Peeta immediately volunteers as their district's male Tribute, angling to both support Katniss and spare their mentor Haymitch from participation in one shot.  So it is that they both descend into hell again, facing other Tributes who are no novices but have also managed to outlast 23 other contestants in at least one previous Game.The veterans will naturally have a number of brutal Career Tributes among them, but there are also a number of competitors with whom Katniss and Peeta may be able to do business.  Among the more relatively humane contestants whom they put on their potential ally shortlist are Finnick, a Twentysomething who was the Game's youngest victor in his teens; Finnick's former mentor Mags, a mute Octogenarian who nobly offered herself in place of Finnick's mentally traumatized girlfriend Annie; techno-geeks Beetee and Wiress, who won their respective games on brainpower; and Johanna, a loose cannon who seems to be around Katniss' age and isn't afraid to say exactly what she thinks about Snow and the Capitol.Moral dilemmas abound.  Do Katniss and Peeta throw in with some folks who might have fewer skills to offer but might be less likely to stab them in the back?  What happens if and when the point comes that the Career Tributes are gone and they're dealing with inevitably having to kill other Tributes who are also fighting only to keep their loved ones from being tortured and/or killed?  We're also given a glimpse of the struggles some of the others are facing.  Particularly poignant is Finnick's effort to keep Mags with him in spite of the painfully obvious long odds of her lasting through the tournament at her age.

1567063,A365BJAGU86XY8,B008JFUS5A,,"[1, 2]","Just watched this movie a today on the movie theater. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It has plenty of action and for the most part it is very entertaining. It follows the story from the book pretty religiously. If you are planning to watch this movie it is highly recommended that you read the book before. It definitely fills up a lot of the details that are missing in the movie. I found the beginning of the movie to be lacking in details as opposed to the book. There is a lot more detailed when it comes to the internal struggle that Katniss is having adjusting back to her regular life. The book also spends more time describing the tributes and their personalities. The movie does this to a certain extend but i guess there is always going to be limitations when you are talking about 2 hour movies. Once the movie starts to go more into the actual &#34;games' the action really picks up.I found the acting job to be pretty darn good. If you like the first movie you are going to enjoy this one a lot. Jennifer Lawrence proves once again that she is not just a pretty face. She definitely has talent. Woody Harrelson once again did a master job reprising his role of Haymitch. I love the cast. There are no complains here.Overall, i have to say i enjoyed the movie. I do have to reiterate again that if you want to get the full experience of the movie that you read the book first so you actually understand the story better. If i had never read the books myself i would have probably gave it 3 stars simply because i felt that the movie was rushed a bit. Not to say it is bad but just lacks that something that made the book so appealing.

President of the oppressive government knows what he is doing, and hires a new game master (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Now the symbol of people&#8217;s power, Katniss knows the game is no longer just about her and Peeta&#8217;s survival.The first sequel (two more are in production) spends more time on describing the complicated relationships between the three characters Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), as well as the psychological changes that Katniss as a reluctant heroine undergoes. That means that those who are looking for action may not like the way the story unfolds, which is pretty slow in the first sixty minutes. The pre-game section takes time, perhaps more than necessary.One of the best things of the first sequel (two more are in production) is the new characters, especially the &#8220;tributes&#8221; played by Jena Malone, Amanda Plummer and Jeffrey Wright. Their unpredictable personalities are more interesting than the game itself.As I said, there would be two more sequels coming in 2014 and 2015 respectively.

Sure it has some great visuals and action here and there, but it severely lacked flow, cohesion, and a proper intellectual plot.  It was far too simple and so predictable.  I could guess most conversations before they talked.  No real surprises.  More of a Class B or C mindless movie, you watch it and say okay that was fun BUT where was the beef?  And the ending?  None.  You realize instantly at the end, what this little movie was really all about.  It was just a big set up for the future Part 3 that surely will come.

I read the trilogy of books but it's been a while (18 months, if not longer). There are several unclear plot points in ""Catching Fire"" (the movie), which are probably dealt with in greater detail in the book, none more so that Katniss and Peeta's decision to not get married, after having gotten engaged ""live"". But it's a minor point in the end.Once we get to the actual Hunger Games in ""Catching Fire"", the action is amazing and pretty much non-stop. I was impressed by the elaborate production design and the special effects were top-notch too.As to the performances, as it happens, in the previews before ""Catching Fire"" there was the trailer for ""American Hustle"", in which Jennifer Lawrence plays a major role. Couldn't help but think as I saw ""Catching Fire"" that Lawrence (a 23 year old woman) is getting too old for the role of Katniss (a 16 year old girl), and in any event it's hard to see her playing Katniss when we've seen her in a more mature role like in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" last year, and now in the upcoming ""American Hustle"".All that nit-picking aside, ""Catching Fire"" is a careful and faithful adoption of the book, delivering all the razzle dazzle that we had been hoping for.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great games-master and played a convincing role so much so I didn't really anticipate the big twist. Catching Fire has a good mix of intrigue, action, and emotion. It is a rare sequel which eclipses the original, but with that cast and story up on the big screen it wasn't even really a contest. Anyone who like the Hunger Games series, or just wants to see a good fun movie should go and see this film.",5,"Better than the first film, Catching Fire will catch your interest",1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,885,"['movie', 'incredible', 'Two', 'half', 'hours', 'fly', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'how', 'faithful', 'anything', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'thought', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'one', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'did', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'first', 'movie', 'away', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'headlined', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'very', 'conflicted', 'strong', 'heroine', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'great', 'games-master', 'played', 'convincing', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'anticipate', 'big', 'twist', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'good', 'mix', 'intrigue', 'action', 'emotion', 'rare', 'sequel', 'original', 'cast', 'story', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'contest', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'series', 'just', 'see', 'good', 'fun', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'see', 'film']",N/A
1567076,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B008JFUS5A,,"[2, 4]","When Hunger Games came out I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it had Jennifer Lawrence in a role that would obviously make a star, an excellent overall cast, good writing, and not bad everything else. It was a throw-back to the old post-apocalyptic films of the 70's and 80's, and for once, an Indie feeling film with an experimental soundtrack and shaky-camera actually felt like a pretty good fit. It all felt rather...real.And on the other hand, the first Hunger Games is quite a downer of a film. Kids thrown into an arena to kill each other or die by various other means is hardly a fun topic, and you have to feel a bit guilty by being...entertained. But the whole point of the film was not to glorify that sort of thing, but rather to draw attention to the kind of world we have could perhaps make in the future, and what people are willing to do to survive, and to hold onto their humanity no matter what.Ultimately the first film didn't really have a climax exactly, It just kind of...ended. It kind of left you hanging in the air, obviously in anticipation of the sequels to come. And come they shall.This film is to the first Hunger Games what Thor:The Dark World was to Thor. It's more fleshed out, higher budget, has been writing, more character development, more style, FAR better cinematography, and and  more block-buster type special effects, sound mixing, and musical score. Is it better for it? I think so.The first film made us feel like we were in Appalachia and then whisked away to Rome for the gladiator arena. Everything to do with District 12 had a poverty-stricken, folksy feel about it that made it all very gripping and heart-breaking. And when the troops from the Capital poured in for a Reaping, it really felt like the technological overlords were coming down from on high to made examples out of the serfs. The games themselves were the hammer driving the nail home, with a resonating message that a nobody from nowhere could single-handedly make a difference, simply because they refused to play the game.Fast forward to now, and our perception of the world has changed as Katniss' perception has changed. She can't hide from the horribleness of the world anymore, because her actions have brought the world crashing down. She wanted to just return to her old way of life and forget the nightmare, but the old way of life is gone forever, and the nightmares are not going away. What is there left to do but face them?The first half of the first Hunger Games dragged a bit for me, but this sequel rockets through the film's setup in District 12, moving forcefully through the events that lead to the Quarter Quell. Everything is in-character. There are less quiet moments to contemplate and dream, because the world that lead to those quiet moments and dreams has been shattered. Everything is slicker, more futuristic, because the Capitol has made it's presence known. There is no need for quiet character development in slow-moving flashbacks, because the future is coming quickly, and things are unraveling fast.The Quarter Quell itself is of course the cornerstone of the film, the thing which would inevitably make or break it. Could the makers of the film get the characters of Joanna and Finnick right? Could they nail the puzzle of the arena and the traps it contains? Yes. Yes they did. I found myself willingly accepting the characters as they are introduced, and getting wrapped up in their fates all over again. And the conclusion...was perfect. And was handled in a way that only Jennifer Lawrence could make happen. She continues to carry the series.The first film had some CGI special effects and the sequel has more. The first film had action sequences and this film has more. The drama has been kicked up a notch (a bit cheesier or melodramatic for some people I am sure). There are more characters, and the characters we have are deeper. The dialog is better. The music is more cinematic. There is some gorgeously framed shots that are high class film-making. This is a film to see more than once in a theater.I watched the first film before reading the books. And I do not like the books. I never really wanted to own the first film though I have watched it several times and gotten a lot out of it. Now...I am glad the final book will be two films because the story needs time to unravel and have the required emotional impact. I'm not a fan of the books, but the first film was better than the book, the second film is even better than the first (and MUCH better than the book, which was my favorite of the series). I cannot wait to see what is done with the final two films, because while Katniss was an empty protagonist who stumbled her way through tumultuous times in the books, here she a complex character whose story is very gripping indeed.

1567078,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B008JFUS5A,,"[2, 5]","The fact that the Hunger Games stories are not crushed by their own weight is mystifying, and an achievement.It seems crazy that a film whose ideology is as savagely brutal as the fictional Games would become such a hit. Despite all its violent connotations and tyrannical regimes, the film comes off as the year&#8217;s pinnacle of entertainment. Maybe the allure lies in ourselves? We project ourselves on screen. We are Katniss fighting back against the oppressors. The film&#8217;s core audience is essentially the same demographic that would be sacrificed if such games were ever to become a reality, so maybe everyone is really just preparing for the future? When the Games start, we&#8217;ll know what to expect.According to IMDB, Post-apocalyptic thrillers are not particularly big money makers; The Hunger Games franchise being the only series that nearly approaches real commercial heavy weights. The first two Hunger Games installments together hold the top grossing spots in the genre, but even then, they don&#8217;t come near grossing anything like the top 50 overall films. Avatar and Titanic are the top two. Both have over two billion worldwide gross. Still, Hunger Games has a hard-core devoted fan base that rivals even Twilight.At the Los Angeles premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, young fans camped out for three days just to be front and center on the red carpet, catching glimpses of the film&#8217;s stars.The best scenes of the film visually were the ones shot in the districts. The New Yorker review describes these scenes like &#8220;Eastern-bloc depression&#8230;drained of vitality,&#8221; but Katniss is exactly the opposite. As a hero she is so strong that alleviates the vitality drainage. Once we leave the districts, the filmmakers deflect the intensity of the subject matter using Katniss as a distraction. Katniss keeps the film from being engulfed into an R-rated abyss. I love R-rated abysses, but they don&#8217;t draw fans like Jennifer Lawrence&#8217;s strong performances in these PG-13 flicks.There were some weaknesses. The coincidence that Katniss and Peeta would be drawn back into the turmoil was too much, an obvious excuse just to get Katniss back in the ring. How is that we didn&#8217;t hear of these conflicts in the past film? Surely Katniss and Peeta would have the known the traditions of the world they live in.Also, why are all the people in the capital dressed so outlandishly? How do they assemble for all public events in perfect symmetry? Why is the President&#8217;s only concern with the games? Doesn&#8217;t he have other duties?What the story lacks in depth, and it certainly does lack, it makes up for in action-packed, well-shot scenes. Despite an appearance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the gamemaker, the curves thrown at the participants in this rendition of the Games weren&#8217;t as exciting as the first film.The most annoying thing in the film was Peeta Malark. He is a weakling and not an interesting character. On the battlefield he hardly contributes. He seems to function only as a male counterpart to Katniss in the political spectrum as Katniss ends up fighting battles for two in the forest.Overall The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was worth the price of admission, and at 2 hours 26 minutes, it flies by quick.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",4,"Fun, action-packed Film",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3345,"['fact', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'crushed', 'own', 'weight', 'mystifying', 'achievement.It', 'crazy', 'film', 'ideology', 'savagely', 'brutal', 'fictional', 'Games', 'would', 'become', 'such', 'hit', 'violent', 'connotations', 'tyrannical', 'regimes', 'film', 'off', 'year', '8217', 's', 'pinnacle', 'entertainment', 'Maybe', 'allure', 'project', 'screen', 'are', 'Katniss', 'fighting', 'back', 'oppressors', 'film', '8217', 'core', 'audience', 'essentially', 'same', 'demographic', 'would', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'such', 'games', 'were', 'ever', 'become', 'reality', 'maybe', 'everyone', 'really', 'just', 'preparing', 'future', 'When', 'Games', 'start', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'expect.According', 'IMDB', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'thrillers', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'big', 'money', 'makers', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'franchise', 'being', 'only', 'series', 'nearly', 'approaches', 'real', 'commercial', 'heavy', 'weights', 'first', 'two', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'together', 'hold', 'top', 'grossing', 'spots', 'genre', 'even', 'then', 'don', '8217', 'come', 'grossing', 'anything', 'top', '50', 'overall', 'films', 'Avatar', 'Titanic', 'are', 'top', 'two', 'have', 'over', 'two', 'billion', 'gross', 'Still', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'hard-core', 'devoted', 'fan', 'base', 'rivals', 'even', 'Twilight.At', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'premiere', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'young', 'fans', 'camped', 'out', 'three', 'days', 'just', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'red', 'carpet', 'catching', 'glimpses', 'film', '8217', 'stars.The', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'visually', 'were', 'ones', 'shot', 'districts', 'New', 'Yorker', 'review', 'scenes', '8220', 'Eastern-bloc', 'depression', '8230', 'drained', 'vitality', '8221', 'Katniss', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'hero', 'so', 'strong', 'vitality', 'drainage', 'leave', 'districts', 'filmmakers', 'deflect', 'intensity', 'subject', 'matter', 'using', 'Katniss', 'distraction', 'Katniss', 'film', 'being', 'engulfed', 'R-rated', 'abyss', 'love', 'R-rated', 'abysses', 'don', '8217', 'draw', 'fans', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', '8217', 'strong', 'performances', 'PG-13', 'flicks.There', 'were', 'weaknesses', 'coincidence', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'back', 'turmoil', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'obvious', 'excuse', 'just', 'get', 'Katniss', 'back', 'ring', 'How', 'didn', '8217', 'hear', 'conflicts', 'past', 'film', 'Surely', 'Katniss', 'Peeta', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'traditions', 'world', 'live', 'in.Also', 'why', 'are', 'people', 'capital', 'dressed', 'so', 'outlandishly', 'How', 'do', 'assemble', 'public', 'events', 'perfect', 'symmetry', 'Why', 'President', '8217', 'only', 'concern', 'games', 'Doesn', '8217', 'have', 'other', 'duties', 'What', 'story', 'depth', 'certainly', 'lack', 'up', 'action-packed', 'well-shot', 'scenes', 'appearance', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'gamemaker', 'curves', 'thrown', 'participants', 'rendition', 'Games', 'weren', '8217', 'as', 'exciting', 'first', 'film.The', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'Peeta', 'Malark', 'weakling', 'not', 'interesting', 'character', 'battlefield', 'hardly', 'function', 'only', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Katniss', 'political', 'spectrum', 'Katniss', 'up', 'fighting', 'battles', 'two', 'forest.Overall', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', '2', 'hours', '26', 'minutes', 'quick.More', 'reviews', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

Anyway, they have to pretend that they still are in love with each other and will have to always do that. But the president is still smarting over their ability to stay alive. So he plots. He sets up the games so that the victors of each of the past games has to fight each other instead of new people being chosen.

1567081,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008JFUS5A,,"[3, 5]","[ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW: My discussion of the plot occurs in the fourth paragraph following this one, and should represent no more ""news"" than you'd get in the trailer.]This is an absolutely faithful and extremely well-made adaptation of the second book in the trilogy, and for those who are fans of the books (and the preceding film) rest assured; you're going to like this movie. The only caveat I offer is this: CATCHING FIRE concerns itself less with characterization than it does with plot. Big things are happening, and it is the furtherance of those elements that will carry us from The Hunger Games [HD], the first book, to the dramatic events of Mockingjay, the final one.I had really been wondering about this entry in the series, and it was more than just the fact that it was the pivotal entry: I really had a few questions after having read the book. What in fact would this warring arena look like--particularly concerning its ""boundaries""? Were Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair going to meet my expectations? How different will this movie look and feel under the direction of Francis Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer)--who was primarily a music video director, though he directed I Am Legend and Water For Elephants (and will helm the next two parts of MOCKINGJAY, the trilogy's conclusion)?Well, I was pleasantly surprised in all three cases, and more. Not only did the arena hold up well--though I would have liked a little more physical clarity in its climactic scene--but I felt Jena Malone as Johanna and Sam Claflin as Finnick both hit it out of the park. And I found no real faults with Lawrence's direction either; the movie had a suitably different sense this time around, certainly, but I wasn't overly aware that it was any more a directorial choice than it was a narrative one.The plot is only a little different this time around. A very imperious commander-in-chief, President Coriolanus Snow (played by a malevolent Donald Sutherland) is sick not only of Katniss' popularity following her (and Peeta's) survival of the 74th Hunger Games, but also of how that popularity seems to be empowering a rebellious foundation. Believing that her victory came from more strategy than any real prowess, he has decided to do away with her once and for all: he will fill the new year's games with those who survived their own games, and feels sure one of them will be able to end her existence once and for all.I found the movie this time around really came around to three acts: the first concerned the?? , who orders our heroine Katniss to be more convincing at selling the romantic angle between Peeta and herself, OR ELSE. The second act concerned the preparation for the games, and a pretty grim recounting of the various champions Katniss and Peeta will now be forced to face. The final act comes down to the game itself, and how uniquely it will evolve.So, to those who were disappointed by the movie's de-emphasis of characterization, I must admit I am puzzled; the second book was not ABOUT characterization. The only real fleshing out of personalities occurs in terms of what those opponents from the other districts will bring to the game...and one doesn't expect to learn all that much about any one of them. This movie is more about strategies: it is concerned with President Snow's demand that this year's game will serve up Katniss' head on a platter, and he has made himself even MORE sure of that fact by hiring a new Game Master: a self-assured Plutarch Heavensbee (played self-assuredly by Philip Seymour Hoffman). That her death is believed to be so guaranteed is made clear by the plans Katniss and Peeta themselves make with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who is portrayed less comically and more scrupulously this time around).What this movie also lets us see more openly and with a little better focus is the true manner of the police state that makes up the twelve districts, and the ugliness of despotic rule. The numbing effect of Snow's terrifying rule is clarified through not only the fish-belly grey machines and armored men who rule the districts, but also through the morphing portrayals of many of the continued secondary and tertiary characters, none better than in the albeit-so-slight evolution of the uber-flippant Effie, played especially well by Elizabeth Banks.Ultimately, I found this to be an entirely fitting second movie. I've heard others claim it was too long, but I felt just the opposite, and wished it could have been longer. I was shocked when the end came, and I read the book. I so badly wanted more that I hoped the movie would continue past the all-telling nature of Katniss' transforming expression.When all is said and done, I think that might be the truest sign of a motion picture's success.

It is a better than the first movie and is definitely worth seeing.In this movie, Katniss and Peeta's defiance at the end of the first film has evoked feelings of revolution throughout the districts.  This has caused President Snow to be very concerned.  The districts are rising up and the Peacekeepers are having trouble maintaining control.Because Katniss is now a symbol of freedom, Snow feels the need to kill her.  He cannot do it openly, so one of his advisers figures out a more clever way.  The upcoming games will feature only individuals from each district who are past winners.  Because Katniss is the only female from District 12 ever to win, she is automatically entered into the newest Hunger Games.This film is about two and a half hours long.  What is good about this movie is that it moves along fairly quickly so that you do not feel like you have watched a film that long.  Watching this film in a theater was a great experience and was worth the price of admission.As far as comparing it to the first film, Catching Fire is better than the original.  They are both great movies, but that should tell you how good the sequel is.  My only problem with the film is that the ending could have been better, but it is passable.Well worth watching and it is a movie you should watch in the theater.

It had atmosphere, reason and dynamicsI do realize that the second movie ends at a cliffhanger which supposed to be continue in part 3 and 4, but still the magic of the first movie wasn't quite there. The first part of the movie (pre-game) was too long, and a bit boring - I do give them credit for showing main characters ""trip"" and its purpose, etc, but it felt a bit too long, specially considering the second half of the movie.Now the second half of the movie is where it actually went worse. The action was ... lost. There was no tension of the first movie. No crazy drive to run and hide and just try to survive the madness that the games are (as it was shown in first movie) - the game turn from the blood fest it should have been, in mostly running from artificial hazards, which while powerful, were not very intelligent. Also main character getting so many allies willing to protect her and die for her, made everything seem ""easy"". How many other players actually threatened her directly? I think it was just 2 or 3. It no longer felt like hopeless survival race that it was in the first movie. I do understand that this group of allies protecting her was all part of a PLAN, but from action genre stand point it was a little dull.I am still looking forward to next movie, but unless things improve a lot, I won't be getting this one of DVD like I immediately did with the first one.",3,"Ok, but not as good as the first one",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1509,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'honestly', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'needed', 'judge', 'movie.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'reason', 'dynamicsI', 'do', 'realize', 'second', 'movie', 'cliffhanger', 'supposed', 'be', 'continue', 'part', '3', '4', 'still', 'magic', 'first', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'pre-game', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'boring', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'showing', 'main', 'characters', 'trip', 'purpose', 'etc', 'felt', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'specially', 'considering', 'second', 'half', 'movie.Now', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'where', 'actually', 'went', 'worse', 'action', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'tension', 'first', 'movie', 'crazy', 'drive', 'run', 'hide', 'just', 'try', 'survive', 'madness', 'games', 'are', 'was', 'shown', 'first', 'movie', 'game', 'turn', 'blood', 'fest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mostly', 'running', 'artificial', 'hazards', 'powerful', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'intelligent', 'Also', 'main', 'character', 'getting', 'so', 'many', 'allies', 'willing', 'protect', 'die', 'made', 'everything', 'seem', 'easy', 'How', 'many', 'other', 'players', 'actually', 'threatened', 'directly', 'think', 'was', 'just', '2', '3', 'no', 'longer', 'felt', 'hopeless', 'survival', 'race', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'do', 'understand', 'group', 'allies', 'protecting', 'was', 'part', 'PLAN', 'action', 'genre', 'stand', 'point', 'was', 'little', 'dull.I', 'am', 'still', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'movie', 'things', 'improve', 'lot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'one', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'did', 'first', 'one']",N/A

It's probably been a few years since I heard the audio CD. The movie's almost good enough to make me want to return to it, but I remember loathing the third book.Rumors said this movie was better than the first and I agree 100%. I remember the first starting out with a needless bout of shaky cam that just ticked me off. This one started out with a sweeping view of rich, green forests.It's got a nice mix of action and story building to keep you from checking your watch too many times, though there was a time or two I checked. Katniss is beautiful and defiant. Gale's not in it a whole heap but we assume he's off doing his thing. Peeta's there and pulls off the wounded semi-lover thing well.It's a good enough stand alone movie, I'm tempted to buy it just 'cause.Update: I've seen it twice now, so I can say that it does have replay value, which is probably something you want to hear if you're considering buying the dvd or blu-ray when it comes out. The second time around, I got to pay more attention to the details, like the particulars of each of Effie's outlandish outfits. BTW, I'm not a huge fashion guru, but one of my favorite scenes during Caeser's interview of Katniss when her dress does its thing. Very powerful moment in the story.Update (12/2/13): I've seen it 3 times. Some of the slower parts were a little more painful this time around, but I'm happy to report that I still enjoyed the overall experience. Also, this time around, I got to focus on a lot of side details. I've come to appreciate Effie's character development a bit more.

The movie is really loyal to the book, which is hard to find nowadays (almost half of the things that happen before the Games are deleted, but most of them aren't really important so I didn't care), but it's a great adaptation. Even some lines are exactly the same. The performances are awesome too; Jennifer shows her talent again, Josh and the rest of the cast were great too. I thought that the actors they picked for the new characters were great, you don't think ""I think he/she was the wrong person for the character"", everyone embodies their character so well!

1567088,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B008JFUS5A,,"[5, 9]","NO SPOILERS!It isn't often that a sequel outdoes it's predecessor in nearly every way, but The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, does just that. Granted, sequels have the benefit of not having to establish the world and characters, but that's what makes Catching Fire so unique. While the world is setup, as are the core set of characters, the story still leaves so much to be explored, as well as introduce wonderful new characters.Suzanne Collins' novel increases the size and scope of Panem as well as the dramatic events bubbling under the surface in the districts. Director Francis Lawrence steps in for Catching Fire (and the two sequels, Mockingjay Parts 1 & 2), and does an extraordinary job. The movie never feels rushed, or too slow, and takes its time to build the tension. Panem now feels huge, and more of the Capitol is explored. Coming off the success of the first film, you can clearly see that the nearly doubled budget ($140 million) was used to it's full extent (sets, costumes, visual effects, special effects).Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss (no surprise there) and there are a few key scenes where Lawrence allows her eyes to speak volumes of emotions. The supporting cast in this film gets a major step up as well thanks to the help of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffery Wright and expanded roles for Elizabeth Banks and Donald Sutherland. Donald Sutherland in particular stands out as President Snow. Snow fumes hate and anger every time he is on screen, but Sutherland buries it and portrays it just through intense stares and devious smiles. While Hoffman's role as Plutarch Heavensbee isn't as fleshed out as much as it should have been, it's established that he's smart, cunning and strategic. Snow trusts him and that's all the power he needs.Visually, Catching Fire is a big improvement over The Hunger Games. Threats in the arena looks significantly more real than in the original (I'm thinking of the bad CGI mutts). The CGI is much improved and the sets and visual effects are just as impressive. The new arena is beautiful (filmed on Oahu) and the threats are very real. The practical sets for the arena, as well as natural landscape give the film a real sense of danger and immerse the audience into a world that feels authentic.As mentioned previously, the pacing is nearly perfect. Slowly building the shrouded tension in the outlining districts, amping-up the consequences for each character and demonstrating that under Snow's hate, no one is safe. By the time the film reaches the climax, the audience is gripped to their seats and reacting to each dramatic event in real time with the characters.

1567089,A2NJRBJFBTF54A,B008JFUS5A,,"[6, 24]","Catching Fire makes a number of improvements over its lackluster predecessor and is a much better film for it. After a very strong first half though, it takes a bit of a dive and by the end I was left a little underwhelmed.Before I get to that though- the positives. One of my biggest problems with the first film was that it took a weighty, horrific, and tragic concept and turned it into a film that felt too light and easily digestible. It could be the fault of the source material (I haven&#8217;t read any of the novels), but it felt like so much thematic potential was wasted on flimsy, poorly choreographed action sequences and a hackneyed love plot. After a promising half-hour, the film quickly devolved into a standard action/thriller affair that barely scratched the surface of the intriguing concept. Catching Fire definitely rectifies this for the most part. It feels appropriately weighty and more solemn that the first film with public executions and other atrocities of the Capitol put on clear display. It also delves more into the psychology of fear and how it can be used to oppress which is a welcomed bit of depth.The excellent cast helps to sell all of these heavier moments. The acting in the film is uniformly excellent, and once again Stanley Tucci steals every scene that he&#8217;s in. The award for most improved character unequivocally goes to Katniss though. In the first film I felt that she came off as overly stoic and enigmatic. I realize that these traits are supposed to be elements of her character, but on screen it didn&#8217;t translate well and she seemed emotionally flat and distant. Katniss in Catching Fire is a much more dynamic character with clear moments of desperation, helplessness, strength, and resolve. Thanks to the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence and the improved script, she feels like a much more fully realized character with the power and charisma to properly carry the film.Like its predecessor though, Catching Fire is still a very front-loaded film. Essentially every great scene in the movie is over by the time it reaches the halfway point. One scene in particular I found to be particularly well done was the scene where Katniss and Peta are broadcast to the Capitol for the first time outside of their houses in Victors&#8217; Village. The scene jumps back and forth between the bright, glittery stage of the Capitol where the broadcast is being played and the barren, dark, and dreary village. It creates a poignant visual metaphor that very successfully conveys the superficiality of the games that comes across it a subtle and tasteful way. I sensed a bit of social commentary in this scene as well concerning our own entertainment in the real world and how superficial and plastic it so often is.The weighty, intriguing scenes like this though slowly but surely gave way to a final act that once again left me wanting more. The hunger games themselves were definitely better in this film than they were in the last. The participants felt a little more fleshed-out and had their own distinct personalities rather than the one-dimension villainous participants we were treated to in the first film. The action sequences were also choreographed and filmed much more coherently. Still though, I felt the portion of the movie that takes place in the hunger games once again disrupted the flow of the film and deadened the narrative tension that had been building up until that point. Once the games start, there is almost no attention paid to any of the characters other than those inside the dome. All of the thematically interesting, morally thought-provoking scenes are left behind for uninspired action sequences which just drag on and on. We basically just watch Katniss and friends run away from poison fog, rabid apes, tidal waves and other dangerous things over and over. It&#8217;s a jarring transition from all of the political intrigue and dramatic, weighty character interactions that came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb.Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but there&#8217;s still undoubtedly room for improvement. It once again fails to fully impress with the actual hunger games portion of the film but there&#8217;s also a lot of powerfully acted and poignant moments as well before it enters that final slog. These are the moments that give me hope that the series will be able to truly deliver on its interesting premise in future films.3.5/5",3,"Better than the first, but there&#8217;s still room for improvement.",1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,4484,"['Catching', 'Fire', 'number', 'improvements', 'lackluster', 'predecessor', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'first', 'half', 'bit', 'dive', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'little', 'underwhelmed.Before', 'get', 'though-', 'positives', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'took', 'weighty', 'horrific', 'tragic', 'concept', 'turned', 'film', 'felt', 'too', 'light', 'easily', 'digestible', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'source', 'material', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'novels', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'thematic', 'potential', 'was', 'wasted', 'flimsy', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'action', 'sequences', 'hackneyed', 'love', 'plot', 'promising', 'half-hour', 'film', 'quickly', 'devolved', 'standard', 'action/thriller', 'affair', 'barely', 'scratched', 'surface', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'definitely', 'most', 'part', 'appropriately', 'weighty', 'more', 'solemn', 'first', 'film', 'public', 'executions', 'other', 'atrocities', 'Capitol', 'put', 'clear', 'display', 'also', 'more', 'psychology', 'fear', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'oppress', 'welcomed', 'bit', 'depth.The', 'excellent', 'cast', 'sell', 'heavier', 'moments', 'acting', 'film', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'once', 'again', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'steals', 'scene', '8217', 's', 'award', 'most', 'improved', 'character', 'unequivocally', 'Katniss', 'though', 'first', 'film', 'felt', 'came', 'off', 'overly', 'stoic', 'enigmatic', 'realize', 'traits', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'elements', 'character', 'screen', '8217', 't', 'translate', 'well', 'seemed', 'emotionally', 'flat', 'distant', 'Katniss', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'much', 'more', 'dynamic', 'character', 'clear', 'moments', 'desperation', 'helplessness', 'strength', 'resolve', 'Thanks', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'improved', 'script', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'power', 'charisma', 'properly', 'carry', 'film.Like', 'predecessor', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'still', 'very', 'front-loaded', 'film', 'Essentially', 'great', 'scene', 'movie', 'time', 'halfway', 'point', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'found', 'be', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Katniss', 'Peta', 'are', 'broadcast', 'Capitol', 'first', 'time', 'houses', 'Victors', '8217', 'Village', 'scene', 'back', 'forth', 'bright', 'glittery', 'stage', 'Capitol', 'where', 'broadcast', 'being', 'played', 'barren', 'dark', 'dreary', 'village', 'poignant', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'very', 'successfully', 'conveys', 'superficiality', 'games', 'subtle', 'tasteful', 'way', 'sensed', 'bit', 'social', 'commentary', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'concerning', 'own', 'entertainment', 'real', 'world', 'how', 'superficial', 'plastic', 'so', 'often', 'is.The', 'weighty', 'intriguing', 'scenes', 'slowly', 'surely', 'gave', 'way', 'final', 'act', 'once', 'again', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'hunger', 'games', 'were', 'definitely', 'better', 'film', 'were', 'last', 'participants', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'had', 'own', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'rather', 'one-dimension', 'villainous', 'participants', 'were', 'treated', 'first', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'also', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'much', 'more', 'coherently', 'Still', 'felt', 'portion', 'movie', 'place', 'hunger', 'games', 'once', 'again', 'disrupted', 'flow', 'film', 'deadened', 'narrative', 'tension', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'point', 'games', 'start', 'almost', 'attention', 'paid', 'characters', 'other', 'dome', 'thematically', 'interesting', 'morally', 'thought-provoking', 'scenes', 'are', 'left', 'uninspired', 'action', 'sequences', 'just', 'drag', 'basically', 'just', 'watch', 'Katniss', 'friends', 'run', 'away', 'poison', 'fog', 'rabid', 'apes', 'tidal', 'waves', 'other', 'dangerous', 'things', '8217', 's', 'jarring', 'transition', 'political', 'intrigue', 'dramatic', 'weighty', 'character', 'interactions', 'came', 'just', 'sticks', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb.Ultimately', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'lot', 'steps', 'right', 'direction', '8217', 'still', 'undoubtedly', 'room', 'improvement', 'once', 'again', 'fully', 'impress', 'actual', 'hunger', 'games', 'portion', 'film', '8217', 's', 'also', 'lot', 'powerfully', 'acted', 'poignant', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'slog', 'are', 'moments', 'give', 'hope', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'truly', 'deliver', 'interesting', 'premise', 'future', 'films.3.5/5']",N/A

1567100,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B008JFUS5A,Anthony L.,"[168, 199]","Nothing could have prepared me for Catching Fire; it was, quite simply, an astonishment on every level. It is so much more than just an action movie; it is also a thought-provoking look at hope, revolution, rebellion, and the importance of government. It's themes encompass grand ideas and touchy subjects with utter fearlessness.Let us examine what sets The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a cut above the rest:1. CAST: Surrounding the amazing Jennifer Lawrence (who has matured into a riveting young actress) is a supporting cast to die for. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth give good roles, but it is the incomparable Donald Sutherland, who oozes quiet menace from every pore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who chews the scenery with a subtle performance, and the amazing Jeffrey Wright who truly astonish. Look also for Jena Malone as Johanna Mason in a brilliant, scene-stealing performance of incredible charisma.2. CINEMATOGRAPHY: Filled with gorgeous and eye-catching shots, Joe Willems's cinematography fills Panem with striking, practical, gritty, but never dour visuals. From the browns and greys of District 12 to the lush, green, cramped hell of the arena, Catching Fire is one of the best photographed films of the year.3. COSTUMES AND SET DESIGN: Catching Fire offers, courtesy of small genius Trish Summerville, some of the most luscious, gorgeous, and eye-catching dresses this side of Lord of the Rings. Look for the marked contrast between the grit and the ash of District 12 with the gleam and color of the Capitol. THG's realistic set design and costuming brings a whole new field of ""real"" to the game.4. ACTION: The perfect blend of psychological build-up and riveting action, the last hour of Catching Fire is an absolute powerhouse of action. Prepare to be glued to the edge of your seat as poisonous fog, lightning, monkeys, psychological torture, and floods beset our heroes. The stakes are raised, and the action is upped, but GONE is the shaky-cam that plagued the first film. Catching Fire has matured in every way.5. THEMES: This is what astonished me the most; the subtle, devious, brilliantly convoluted game of cat-and-mouse (""moves and counter moves"") played by President Snow, Plutarch Heavensbee, and Katniss Everdeen over the course of the film. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a thought-provoking and stimulating look at fascism, revolution, revolt, and the dangerous side effects of hope. Bravo for the decision to insert such smart material into a film of this calibre.On the whole, the cons of Catching Fire are few, and it's pros are many.

1567117,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUS5A,Chris Kennison,"[4, 6]","There is an unsettling trend that has festered its way into Hollywood. I guess you could say it has been going on for years, but this is a little different. An author writes a trilogy (or more) of books geared toward young adults, they become popular and then Hollywood milks the public dry with movies that have no ending until they actually make the final movie; which could be delayed longer and longer, depending upon how much milking takes place. ""Harry Potter"" was the poster child for this trend and that was followed by the ""Twilight"" series, both of which split their final books into two movies for more milking.I call this an unsettling trend because often what happens is bad film-making; movies with no payoff, stories that are interrupted for months or years until they film and release the next chapter, movies that their entire purpose for existence is a side-story and finally, payoff after 4,5, or 7 movies that makes you realize that 4,5 or 7 movies was really unnecessary. I say this because ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those franchises' of films and you should be fully aware of these downsides that I just listed.Fortunately for ""Hunger Games"", it is spectacular film-making. Most importantly though, it is gifted with an amazing actress that effortlessly achieves the one thing that I think is the greatest asset that any movie can; empathy. Katniss Everdeen is an unwilling and sympathetic anti-hero and if you as an audience member don't feel the emotions that she is going through or are moving in your seat as she runs, dives and survives, you may need to check your pulse.""Catching Fire"" is more than the action movie that you would expect. It is brilliantly thought-provoking. Each character is drawn to complexity with great thought and performed with vigor by great actors. When Woody Harrelson's character Haymitch tells Katniss that the upcoming exercise is to find allies, the message is clear to her and to you the audience. From that point on, you the audience member and Katniss Everdeen are one in the same. You are studying the characters and your heart is racing when the events begin to unfold. Who does she trust? Who do you trust?You'd have to have been in a Turkish prison not to know that ""Catching Fire"" is the middle book of a three-book series and the second of a four-movie series. Therefore, despite its qualities, the movie builds you to a boiling point, the screen drops to black and on the screen comes the crackling burning mockingjay icon, signifying credits and a wink to you that you'll have to wait until November 2014 for part 1 of the rest of the story and November 2015 for the concluding film. Thanks for your cash! See you then! Hope you live that long!On the good side, rather than make you mad, the movie achieves its desired goal and lights an appropriate fire in your gut.

1567151,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUS5A,FNDNreview,"[12, 13]","After more than a year and a half, the seemingly endless wait has finally come to an end.  The Hunger Games sequel, Catching Fire, is here.  If anticipation could literally kill people, this film would have whipped out tens of millions - not dissimilar from a Harry Potter or Twilight sequel.  Regardless, the difference between The Hunger Games and Harry Potter or Twilight is the target audience of The Hunger Games is limitless.  While the first film nearly broke the $700 million barrier worldwide, this franchise has picked up so much momentum that there shouldn't be any stopping it, right?  Well, it's not like we aren't all aware of the dreaded ""curse of the sequel,"" but rest assured Hunger Games fans - there's nothing to fear here.The Hunger Games director, Gary Ross, steps aside for the sequel as the reigns fall on the shoulders of highly-acclaimed music video and occasional film director, Francis Lawrence (Water for Elephants, I Am Legend).  Catching Fire, based on the novel sequel of the same name by Suzanne Collins, picks up in the aftermath of the Hunger Games victory by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).  Back in District 12, the pair attempts to reclaim their lives of normalcy while still dealing with the emotional backlash of being forced to murder people for the benefit of entertaining a legion of disassociated onlookers.With the residents of the twelve districts becoming more and more agitated and on the verge of a revolution, President Snow places the blame on the actions of Katniss and her refusal to kill Peeta.  Snow instructs her to sell her sham of a love affair with Peeta in order to unite the people and threatens her family and friends if she continues to defy the Capitol - evident in a kiss she shares with her close friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).  In the meantime, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to each district to pay tribute to their fallen Hunger Games opponents, including an emotional tribute to Rue - which only intensifies the rebellion.  Snow takes notice and sends in Peacekeeper soldiers to execute members of the forming resistance.As the violent acts of the Peacekeepers intensifies, so does Snow's intent to murder Katniss.  However, Snow's new adviser, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hatches a plan to evoke the Third Quarter Quell on the 75th Anniversary of the Hunger Games.  Instead of drafting new competitors for this anniversary contest, the lottery includes only former Hunger Games victors from each district, including Katniss, and Peeta.  As the only female victor of District 12, Katniss must once again take arms in the Hunger Games, and is instantly forced to leave for the capitol - escorted by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).  On a side note, Banks' costumes are even more elaborately outlandish in this film than the last.  Still, just amazing costume designs all around.Let me first say that I don't read a whole lot of fiction (often spending my time watching it, instead), so the criticism coming from me are only in regards to the film itself.  With that being said, there's nearly nothing to criticize about this film anyway.  Honestly, after watching nearly half of this film, I was fully prepared to hammer this film for being nothing more than a slight reimaging of the first film.  After watching the first film prior to watching the sequel, both films progress almost verbatim.  The film begins with Katniss and Gale in the restricted zone hunting, followed by a slow progression of re-introducing characters from the previous film.  As the story goes on, you'll notice slight variations from scenes in the first film when she arrives to the Capitol.  Once more, Katniss and Peeta are paraded around (with combustible outfits), go through the interview process with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and begin the same old training process.  Only, instead of shooting an apple out of pig's mouth, Katniss is forced to be more creative (since this time they've installed a force field).There are plenty of new characters introduced as opponents in the Hunger Games, including Gloss (Alan Ritchson), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Mags (Lynn Cohen), and the undeniably charming Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones).  Initially, you're led to believe this will be just another round of one-on-one violence as in the first film - but it's not.  These games are so much more evolved and clever in comparison to the last film.  Obviously, the battle sequences are major spoilers, so there's no need to discuss them in too much detail here other than to say the actual Hunger Games themselves make this movie into an absolute pleasure to watch.  For the individual characters themselves, the other 23 competitors are not the prominent threat anymore.  This time around, the unpredictability of their environment will have you zoned into this flick to the extent that you'll feel like you're sitting right next to these characters and sharing their experiences with them as they occur.Obviously, some new characters have more screen time than others, but the screen time is largely devoted to Jennifer Lawrence and her emotional journey - a role in which Lawrence visibly excels.  This film starts out with her character still recovering from the traumatizing events of her Hunger Games experience.  From there, all the way to final moments of this sequel, Katniss is being slowly emotionally drained.  The climax of this film is momentary build-up of her character saying enough is enough.  She's surrounded by death and the idea that she's a symbol of hope (a theme is constantly mention over the course of the film), and frankly, that's bound to take its toll on anyone.  At the same time, she's half-heartedly being courted by two different male suitors, one of which is her close friend (Gale) and the other she's supposed to marry for the good of ""the people.""  And, while this romantic triangle is mildly entertaining, I like the fact that it's not at the forefront.  To be honest, the chemistry between Lawrence, Hemsworth, and Hutcherson isn't all that believable in the first place.Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a film that starts off slowly but eventually puts a stranglehold on your attention, making it one of the best sequels in recent memory.  For those worrying about it not living upto  the first film, rest assured:  the sequel is better than its predecessor.  You can't say that very often, yet in this case the sequel is far superior in nearly every facet of storytelling, acting, production, and design.  If I had to generate a guess, Catching Fire will impress moviegoers so much that it will land itself in a club with The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather II, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day as one of the best sequels ever made.  The thematic elements alone, discussing events that run rampant on the world today, including politics, revolution, media bias, wealth vs. poverty, and powerful people doing anything to maintain their power, all contribute to the success and progression of this story.  By now, you're likely aware the two part final chapter, Mockingjay Part 1 & 2, are on their way, and the final scenes of Catching Fire provide a cliffhanger that have already made Mockingjay one of the most anticipated sequels of both 2014 and 2015.Also, if you happen to listen to modern music, you should definitely check out the Catching Fire soundtrack.  You won't be disappointed.GRADE:  A-FNDNreview.com",5,'Catching Fire' amongst the greatest sequels in film history,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,7555,"['more', 'year', 'half', 'seemingly', 'endless',

1567168,A10H47FMW8NHII,B008JFUS5A,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[14, 17]","Admit it. Some of you have been waiting for this one. I know I have. If you saw ""The Hunger Games,"" you will remember that in this battle to the death, our two representatives from District 12 had to pretend to be in love in order to get sponsors to provide some much-needed supplies necessary for their survival (and victory). Now the Panem government wants to see them marry to prove that it wasn't a hoax.The problem is, The Capitol senses a rebellion brewing and thinks our heroine may be the inspiration, so they announce The Quarter Quell which will pit contestants drawn from previous winners. She is certain to have her name drawn as she is the only female winner from District 12 in the past quarter century. So much for that ""lifetime of plenty"" she was promised.Some of these are returnees from the first episode:* Jennifer Lawrence (Oscar for ""Silver Linings Playbook"") is back as Katniss, the role model I wish tweens would emulate: Her first instinct always is to help; she is genuine; she's smart; and she's resourceful. AND she has become the unwitting symbol of rebellion in Panem.* Josh Hutcherson (""Red Dawn"") is Peeta, her partner, and, to make their story look real, her fiance. This guy is steadfast, strong and soooo much in love with her....* Liam Hemsworth (""The Last Song"")  is Gale, her first love, still working in the mine back in District 12, taking care of her mother and sister and trying to ignore the publicity about Katniss and Peeta's pending nuptials.* Sam Claflin (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") is Finnick, one of the other contestants. Is he an ally they can trust or an enemy who will stab them in the back?* Lenny Kravitz (""Precious"") is the wonderful Cinna, the designer who created the marvelous dress that launched Katniss as the Girl on Fire. This year's design is even more provocative. Wait until you see it!* Donald Sutherland (""The Hunger Games"") returns as President Snow, walking a fine line between assassinating Katniss outright (which might inflame the rebels) and trying to outwit her (which he's fairly confident he can do).* Stanley Tucci (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") once again is the perfect television host: smarmy, overly enthusiastic and completely despicable.* Elizabeth Banks (""Pitch Perfect"") This time her Effie Trinket seems to have grown a heart. Whew!*  Woody Harrelson (""Seven Psychopaths"") still is Haymitch (and he still drinks too much). He's the only former winner of the Hunger Games from District 12 still living and as such, serves as a mentor for our two contestants.This is a battle of wits, guts and gumption. It is PG-13 because of the grisly idea behind the games, although we rarely see blood. There is a sprinkle of profanity but it is warranted when used. We mostly see resourceful (and loyal) young adults in a battle for their lives. They remind each other, ""Remember who the enemy is.""This is exciting, involving and we have a LOT of people to root for. I haven't named all the principal characters in this 146-minute epic, but I must warn you, there are no dull spots when you can take a quick break, so do NOT drink too many liquids!I'm looking forward to the third (and fourth) episodes, ""Mockingjay.""

1567170,A11LBH38IDQNXN,B008JFUS5A,Jean M.,"[10, 11]","This movie was excellent!  I loved the first Hunger Games book, but I found the movie to be just okay.  I had high hopes for Catching Fire because it changed directors and because it's my favorite book in the series.  I had high expectations and boy, did this movie meet them!One thing worth mentioning why Catching Fire was so good is the fact that it get's rid of all the flaws I had with the first movie.  I had a huge problem with the shaky cam.  I know Gary Ross - the director of the first movie -  wanted to get a realistic feel of District 12 and the  Games, but I thought he went a little too overboard.  Catching Fire gets rid of the shaky cam entirely.  There's a little bit during the action sequences, but it was a huge improvement compared the first movie.Another thing worth mentioning is the relationship between Katniss and Peeta felt a more natural.  The &#34;love triangle&#34; it tried to set up in the first movie felt forced and in this one, I actually cared more about Peeta and Katniss' relationship.And I think that's the best part of the movie.

1567175,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B008JFUS5A,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[7, 9]","What a prophetic title Catching Fire is for the sequel to 2012's The Hunger Games the first film based on the series of novels by author Suzanne Collins. After the surprise huge success of the nearly seven hundred million dollar worldwide box office gross of The Hunger Games Collin's dystopia sci-fi series truly caught fire launching the popularity of the novels, films, and Jennifer Lawrence to new heights never thought possible. The fire ignited by The Hunger Games continues in Catching Fire as the sequel is a major step up from its predecessor in every way.When we last saw Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark had just finished winning or better yet surviving the 74th Hunger Games, and were returning home to District 12. Katniss revealed to Peeta that everything in the games was an act, and President Snow was not happy with the results of the Games which led to an unhappy end for head game maker Seneca Crane, and now months on the eve of the Victory Tour an annual event after the Hunger Games where the Victors tour the other districts on the way to the capital Katniss and Peeta have an icy relationship, and both suffer from PTSD. Both of their lives have gone back to relative normality until just hours before the Victory Tour President Snow pays Katniss a visit explaining how things are going to be if Katniss wants Gale, and her family to continue to breath. Katniss and Peeta are forced to act like a happy couple to help appease the unhappy citizens of the other districts only to have their stiff and unconvinced act antagonize the people for leading Snow to make changes to the Third Quarter Quell and 75th Hunger Games as he decides to have the tributes chosen from the exciting victors of each district as he hopes to rid himself of Katniss, and the other tributes who Snow views as instigators who believe they are above the law, and can get away with anything.It's rare for film adaptions to surpass its source material with Out of Sight, Blade Runner, and The Silence of the Lambs such a few that were better than the source material yet The Hunger Games series has done it twice with the first film, and now with Catching Fire. Directed Francis Lawrence, and screen writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt had some tough decisions adapting Catching Fire. They had to both make fans of the novel happy as well as the ordinary people whose only knowledge of the novel series is what they learned from the first film, and as a fan of Catching Fire I believe they did that. Beaufoy and Arndt streamlined Catching Fire omitting certain elements and characters from the novel. They didn't do a perfect job as I felt they should have at least like in the first films included scenes of Peeta's family. They didn't have to have lines in the film, but I felt they should have been there or more scenes with Haymitch who won the second Quarter Quell, and shows Peeta and Katniss his time in the games, but those are small complaints for me as the two screen writers added all the important themes in the film from class warfare to the effects of war and violence has on people and an society to simple fear, and self-preservation over revolution and change, and scenes like Gales whipping, the scene in district 11, the games, and the beautiful moment on the beach between Katniss and Peeta. The only other real complaint I would have would be the scenes with Snow and his daughter. I know the screen writers wanted to show the impact Katniss was having in the capital and Snow's daughter, but the scenes weren't necessary and took away from the film. Outside of that Beaufoy and Arndt did a wonderful job adapting the novel to film, and getting me to love the film more than I do the novel.While I loved first Hunger Game film it did have its problems in particular in the acting department. Perhaps it was the lack of screen time or just plain lackluster acting, but Liam Hemsworth was forgettable as Gale Hawthorne, Josh Hutcherson did a good job as Peeta, but seemed stiff and unemotional compared to Jennifer Lawrence, and outside of Rue and Cato the tributes weren't that well casted or acted. Catching Fire has some small issues with acting, and in particular with Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee. The award winning actor just seemed disinterested in most of his scenes. Hopefully that will change in the two upcoming Mockingjay films. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna was also a minor hindrance as he spoke with no emotion and in a robotic tone, and thankfully he won't be around in the sequels.Besides those two the acting was again a major step up from the first film. Liam Hemsworth came into his own has Gale who hates the capitol, and after hearing about uprising in other districts wants to rebel as well. Sam Claflin and Jena Malone were perfectly casted as Finnick Odair and Johanna Mason. The two actors in their roles just capture the essence of their characters perfectly and draw the cameras to them. Elizabeth Banks gives such a great performance as Effie Trinket it's hard to separate the two, and in Catching Fire, Elizabeth Banks shows that Effie is more than just a vain capital born citizen. Donald Sutherland does another solid acting performance as President Snow, and in particular his short scene with Lawrence. The young Hutcherson comes into his own in Catching Fire showing both his and Peeta's growth as an actor and character in particular with his scenes and chemistry with Katniss/Lawrence. Catching Fire certainly does have some great acting, but with that said Catching Fire and The Hunger Game films are made boom or bust by its star Jennifer Lawrence who since her breakout performance in first Hunger Games, and her Oscar winning performance in Silver Linings Playbook has become America's sweetheart. Lawrence is gorgeous, funny, smart, humble, and a tremendously talented actress who's willing to make fun of herself, and her star will continue to rise after her performance in Catching Fire. Lawrence is so effortless in her acting that it's as if the character and actress are one and the same. Jennifer Lawrence perfectly displays the wide ranging emotions of Katniss from her PTSD nightmares to hatred for Snow and the capitol, and growing love for Peeta. Lawrence drives the Hunger Games and continues to in Catching Fire displaying why she is an Oscar winning actress, and the one of if not the best actress of this current generation.With Gary Ross out as director, and Francis Lawrence brought in the director for Catching Fire, and the two Mockingjay films changes in style were made to Catching Fire that was added by estimated one hundred and thirty million dollar budget. Out was the shaking camera style that many critics hated in the first film as Francis Lawrence brought a more visual, and darker element to Catching Fire that benefited the film. Lawrence did a superb job in bringing Catching Fire to life, and I look forward to his vision of the two Mockingjay films. I have been purposely vague about the action scenes and the games themselves, as I don't want to give anything away or ruin it for those who haven't read the novels, but the action is masterfully done, and directed, and no the action is not just a retread of the action of the first film.I know some, and in particular men will refuse to see Catching Fire, and The Hunger Games films because of the Young Adult label is cursed to be attached to the dreaded Twilight books and films as well as crappy romance, and screaming girls or some ill-conceived notion that The Hunger Games is a rip off of the overrated Battle Royal manga series that was in itself heavily influence by Lord of the Flies, but they'd be missing out on a truly special film, and films that is far more than the labels given to it. Yes The Hunger Games novels are under the YA label, but the Y has really nothing to do with the novels. There are no vampires that sparkle, crappy magic elements or a female lead that has no personality or goals outside of the men, and in most cases the two men in her live. The Hunger Games novels strived to be more than that, and are as there is actually real depth, and themes in the story. Yes there is romance, and a sort of love triangle in the novels, but the romance is extremely well done, and isn't the predominate factor in the series. The lead character Katniss is an actual character with feelings, emotions, and a strength that doesn't make her reliant on a man to protect her or hold her up. The Hunger Games, and author Suzanne Collins wanted instead of playing it safe to instead challenge the young reader and audience members to think about the themes in the novels and the world as a whole.It would be a shame for people to let preconceived notions keep them from missing out on The Hunger Games, and Catching fire as Catching Fire is a great film one of the best of the year as well as a one of the best sequels in years with a brilliant adapted screenplay, great directing, with a well casted cast that did a splendid job in their roles, great action, cinematography, and of course the great Jennifer Lawrence giving another marvelous performance as Katniss. Catching Fire is a brilliant film that shouldn't be missed.",5,"""Remember who the real enemy is.""",1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,9198,"['What', 'prophetic', 'title', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'sequel',

The duplicitous President Snow and the Panem Capital have decided to send the victors of the Hunger Games (promised a life of peace and exclusion from further ""tribute"") to a special Games in honor of the 75th year. Every 25 years is a ""Quarter Quell"" and this one is being used to take down Katniss, now the symbol of rebellion.The action is well-handled, the supporting cast of victors (Mags, ""Nuts"", ""Volts"", Johanna and Finnick each are well-cast, well-scripted and make for an exciting ensemble cast.) The character of the new Gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee is excellent. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman plays him a bit ambiguously. Is he on the side of Snow, a sadistic creator of impossible-to-win situations, or is he secretly sympathetic with the rebels? He was perfectly cast and it's a shame he died before completing the next film (Mockingjay) though he did shoot a fair number of scenes. A loss of a talented actor.My only complaint is similar to the one I have now in the trend to serialize novels. It ends on a cliffhanger and of course we're waiting for the next film.

Unfortunately their retirement to a life of `luxury' is short lived. The Capitol is concerned at the unrest in the districts and at Katniss' popularity in particular. The subsequent 75th Hunger Games is thus designed to put an end to her and re-establish control over the twelve districts. Accordingly, the previous winners of the Games are committed to another round which should see Katniss dead and hope crushed. While this is all conveyed well enough, this installment does not stand alone. You really need to be familiar with the books or at least to have seen the first film in the series.  Even so, things are a little confusing at times. The human dynamics are a bit more complex this time round and much that happens is to set up the next film. I felt this served to let this film down a bit and it all seemed a bit rushed towards the end. Overall the focus is less on the Game itself and more on the rebellion, though it is still pretty good entertainment. There is also some powerful emotional moments at times. It is not too gory and if anything the violence has been toned done a bit. The fact that most of the participants are adults makes it less unsettling than the first installment. Recommended but it needs to be viewed as an episode rather than a self-contained story.

I wasn't as impressed with the second one. Thou I did like it. SPOILER ALERT:: I called it from the start of the movie that the guy runing the games was in on the revoluation, the way he was talking to Catness, it just gave it away. My big problems with this movie. I never really beleived that Catness and Petta really loved eachother. In the first one they used his affection for her to try and set them up to kill eachother in the end. However I never really beleived that Catness really had any feeling for Petta it seemed mostly the other way around. I don't like Petta I think he is a 5th wheel. In the first one he had cool como and he was trying to survive on his own, but in this one he is just pathidic. He doesn't have a cool weapon, or any special ability. Catness is the kickass zena warrior with the godly bow, and the amazing quiver that never runs out of arrows. I thought the writers never got a hand of Catness Charecter, in the first part of the movie she was cold, devoted to her orginal bf, and I felt that was more of her charecter, but towards the end she was just a crying, whining, and it was a drastic change that I didn't get into. I felt Jennifer Lawrence was good but the writers never got a strong hold on the charecter. I thought they had a good idea at the start of the movie when Catness accidently killed the guy while hunting was a really good idea. It has the ablity of derailing the whole revaloution, but they never used it. The Pressident could have found out and used it to blackmail her. I hope they don't forget about it for the third movie.All that said, I did really like the movie. I liked seeing the people fight back. When it comes to a sudden suprise ending with a twist, linonsgate always delivers on that one. I see lionsgate movie and I just expect a crazy twist from someone that sat through all the saw movies. I thought the story was well done, it really did a good job of making you feel for the people, and set up the revolt well. It was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat, for all around I felt it was well done. I am very excited to see how the third movie is done and how it will end.

As in the old riddle &#34;What is a date that is also a command?&#34;Gets me thinking that they picked that date for a reason.Anyways.....This movie is awesome!!!!!!When I see the run time of a movie being over 2 hrs., I tend to cringe. Usually it's a story that will just drag on. But not this one. The time flew as I was increasingly on the edge of my seat and plain exhausted by the end. Wow! Such an amazing movie! No need for me to go over the story line as others have gone into great detail already.This is a must-see movie. There are loads of details that I'm sure that I missed so I will be ordering the Blu-ray right away. It is a marked improvement of the first which was also a good movie, but was more focused on the young adult crowd. This world and story has been expanded and opened up a lot of possibilities for the upcoming adventures.For me, this one was close to the same kind of experience I had with watching the original Star Wars movie in the theater.  I never thought that I would see another movie like that again.Some notes that I should add:If you haven't seen the first, you really need to see it before seeing this movie.

What the movie presented was all that I had to judge. And I was so sorely disappointed. All that hyperbole had raised my expectation something akin to cinematic tumescence. Energy wasted.Not that I was only seeking bloodshed, but let's be bluntly honest here and say 'Hunger Games' was an insipid powderpuff of a film. I half expected a bunch of vendors outside the theater hawking t-shirts and toy figurines to the kiddies. One of the films I recommended in my original review in the hopes that future installments of the franchise would achieve a similar experience was 'The Condemned' - a digital Roman Colosseum with brutal games of death for the sick pleasure of the anonymous multitude. My fears for the second installment, thankfully, was put to rest quickly. This was an exponential improvement. Going way beyond some marginal refinement by touching up the corners of an already weak product.Gary Ross left the project or was shown the door - either way - I'm terribly grateful.The new filmmakers exceeded my limited expectations.Simultaneously - and in true 'Rollerball' fashion - exposing the social plague that is ""cultural popularity"" and the hidden manipulation by the elites as they use entertainment to divert, distract and appease the unruly angry masses. In case you missed it - that's you, me, and all the other 99% regular folk. It's important to remember the elite's mantra for centuries has been:""Keep them occupied with bread and circuses.""As the powerful have unhappily discovered that Katniss' popularity is working against their purpose, they have decided to break her the same way they made her - by way of the games. And despite promises of a life carefree of such demands, the establishment has devised a twist to bring back past victors in a battle royal. This time no pair will emerge - one lone survivor will be crowned all-time champion. And Katniss Everdeen cannot and will not be that champion. Designed specifically to break her spirit, and by association, the spirit of the people who have discovered in her their own long suppressed voice screaming for freedom.And we finally get to see the actress who won the Academy Award at age 22. Jennifer delivered a superlative performance as the district youngster growing up much too soon. The long dark shadow that one carries inside as one murders a way to false fame and fortune. Katniss finally having to deal with the reality that she killed other children. The true price of her survival now eating away at her soul.Further, by showcasing the revolting clownish existence of Celebrity - a pathetic new world made acceptable by empty-headed twits like the Kardashians and their reality-tv ilk; finally exposing that world for the whorish fame-seeking lifestyle it is. Sadly, unlike this fictional vision, has already infected the current and upcoming generation of Americans. &lt;smh>Yes, this is the movie I was hoping for.Finally, given the processed pre-digested PowerPoint presentation of the first film, I had no choice but to dismiss Josh Hutcherson as nothing more than a juvenile automaton; a walking, talking cardboard cut-out. But Director Francis Lawrence gave the young man an actual role to fill; a real performance to execute. And he did so with adroitness. Ditto Elizabeth Banks who, in a few scant scenes, revealed a depth of character and thespian skill peering beyond the garish pancake. A pair of unexpected pleasant surprises to go along with with so many other wonderful elements found in this exceptional sequel.Overall, I'm really, really pleased. It gives one hope that some executive producers are not completely self-involved in their own navels; the ability see things honestly - without consulting lying marketing departments and their pimps - where things have gone wrong and having the proper insight on how to fix the problem is a very rare thing in cinema.Internally debated this movie review for several days, but I'm now comfortable to defend = five stars.Personal Note:- This is what comes of finding the right director for a project. Not just name-branding or submitting to the rantings of the internet mob - but strength of will to do the right thing. Replacing Gary Ross was a game changer - and the absolute right thing. Francis Lawrence captured, what I understand from perusing forums where hardcore fans congregate, what the Games are truly about; he understood what the writer was attempting. A decisive cleave at the poorer functionary to find the right vision in the right hands of the right creative helm.And this is a perfect example of why I give Disney Corp and their subsidiary Marvel Entertainment such a look of incredulity. You have two major winning franchises in 'Iron Man' and 'Thor'. So what do you do? Change directors and produce infinitely less enjoyable films. Why?Stealing defeat from the jaws of victory.What business school did those morons attend? They could learn something from the Hunger Games team.",5,"""Keep them occupied with bread and circuses.""",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,5128,"['Now', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'when', 'screened',

Tresca ""Talien""","[7, 8]","&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; series is theoretically a young-adult series about one girl's struggles in a post-apocalyptic world where food is scarce and children battle for the entertainment of the upper classes. &#34;Catching Fire&#34; gives us a window into that world that &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; only hinted at.  It is an alternately thrilling and depressing view of a world burning with hope that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) inadvertently started by simply surviving her first Hunger Games.It all starts with President Snow (Donald Sutherland) openly threatening Katniss' family.  She must keep up appearances by smiling and delivering on the fairy tale ending promised by the conclusion of the first film.  But her victory tour, with her faux romantic interest Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) at her side, slowly peels back layer after layer of just how bad things are.  Anyone even showing a hint of support for Katniss is executed.  The whirlwind press tour featuring Katniss and Peeta only further inflames the rebels to fight against the hierarchy of Panem. So Snow hatches up another plan with a new gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And that plan is another Hunger Games.And so we have the centerpiece of the film, which is in fact a small part of a much larger narrative -- people fighting in a hostile environment. This Hunger Games is different; the contestants are all survivors of previous games, and they're pretty pissed off to find government reneging on its promise of keeping them safe after surviving the last one.A motley crew of contestants are assembled, some perfect for the role like Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and others like the mute grandmotherly Mags (Lynn Cohen).

1567224,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUS5A,M. Oleson,"[3, 4]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.There are a couple major changes in this second film of the Suzanne Collins novels.  First, thanks to the success of the original 2011 movie, the production budget doubled.  Second, Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") takes over from Gary Ross as director.  And while the money shows up on the screen in terms of special effects, costumes and sets, the film's brilliance remains centered with the actors, especially the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.The film picks up where the first left off.  Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have returned victorious to District 12, believed to be in love.  At least by the population of Panem (a stand in for a future North America).  In reality, Katniss is conflicted.  While she has feelings for Peeta, she is also drawn to her lifelong friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).  In the novels, Katniss speaks in the first person so we get an inside look at her confusion and inexperience with romantic love.  In the film, it is up to Ms. Lawrence to convince audiences of her confusion.  She is pulled in both directions by actors Hutcherson and Hemsworth.  We get it.  And we believe it.Promised to be safe from further battlefield Games, we quickly learn it is not to be for Katniss, Peeta and their mentor, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson).  While on their victory tour throughout the districts, there is an unease in the population.  They see the survival of two instead of just one in the last Games as a sign of rebellion against the Capitol and their leader President Snow (Donald Sutherland).  Snow along with the new Games Director, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) design something special for the 75th Games known as the Quarter (as in century) Quell.  This time, the pool of previous district winners will be used for those chosen to fight to the death.Since Katniss is the only female winner from District 12, she's a lock to go again.  When Haymitch is chosen in the lottery, Peeta quickly volunteers, essentially to help the girl he loves.  The movie lingers artfully getting to the Games as Lawrence and his writers (Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt) take their time further developing the relationships, especially between Katniss and Peeta.  The middle section of the film is heartbreaking.For the Games themselves, the film creates a cadre of allies which includes another hunky fighter (Sam Claflin), the wise-ass Johanna (terrific Jena Malone) and others.  As most people know, this terrific film works as a place-setter for the concluding chapter which will be broken up into two films.  With that in mind, it ends somewhat abruptly and contains a plot thread that didn't make sense to me, either in the book or the movie.  Having said that, ""Catching Fire"" is a modest improvement over the excellent first film and a faithful adaptation of the book.  It looks better on screen and the relationships are deepened.  This is good stuff.",5,4 1/2 stars.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","The first half of the movie was more interesting to me, because it delved much deeper into the politics of the dystopian kingdom of Panem, where a totalitarian central government lords it over the capitol and 12 districts...the mysterious 13th District having been reportedly destroyed. We learn from President Snow (a menacing Donald Sutherland) that there may be a ground swell of rebellion in some of the districts..and that Katniss Everdeen is a source and inspiration for rebellion. So Katniss has to walk on thin ice, so to speak, while carrying on her bogus relationship with Peeta Mallark, and hiding her true feelings for Gale Hawthorne. Yet it appears that no matter how careful she is, her life and those who are nearest to her are still in jeopardy. This is an exceptionally well made follow-up to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, and is adapted from the second book in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Jennifer Lawrence reprises her Katniss Everdeen characterization; and as with all her performances I've seen, she totally immerses herself in the character. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth also reprise their characters of Peeta and Gale and do well. Woody Harrelson is back again, perfectly cast as Haymitch; as is Elizabeth Banks as the silly but loyal Effie Trinket. As for new characters, look for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in a superb performance as the Master of the Games, Plutarch Heavensbee; and Jena Malone as the cunning, Johanna Mason, one of the tributes allied with Katniss and Peeta during the Quarter Quell games, which pits former Hunger Games victors against each other.

1567268,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B008JFUS5A,Steven Aldersley,"[7, 10]","My review of The Hunger Games was a little negative due to the weak acting of the supporting cast, but that's vastly improved in Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence, who impressed me with I Am Legend, replaces Gary Ross, and I'm happy with the result. Lawrence will also direct the final two installments.As in the opening movie, Jennifer Lawrence is the key ingredient. Remove her from the project and it just wouldn't be as good. She rightly received an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and has to show a whole range of emotions in Catching Fire. You'll see what I mean during the opening scene in which she has a flashback to events we witnessed in the previous movie. If I had to list the most promising actresses under the age of 30, Lawrence would clearly be right at the top. In fact, there are few actresses of any generation that I would rather watch.For the purposes of this review, I'm going to assume that you have seen the first installment. If you haven't, don't attempt to see Catching Fire before you know how the story begins. You'll miss some of the references for sure.We learned in The Hunger Games that victorious tributes could look forward to a better life. Hunger and poverty were supposed to be a thing of the past, and the fear of being asked to fight for survival could be removed forever. But it wouldn't be much of a sequel if Katniss just rode around waving to the crowds, would it? President Snow (Donald Sutherland) devises a scheme to get her in a new battle, only this time it's bigger and better than ever. Without giving away too much, let's just say that there are no tributes that are easy to kill in this sequel; those involved are generally older and more experienced.The different tributes aren't the only characters who are new to Catching Fire. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and his questionable facial hair has been replaced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Hoffman gives a typical multifaceted performance, and the motivations of his character are hard to guess. During a conversation with Katniss, he claims to have volunteered for the position of Head Gamemaker, even though the life expectancy is not great. Does that mean that Seneca Crane wasn't the only one who was punished for disappointing President Snow in the past? Have other tributes caused trouble for Snow?The main difference between this sequel and the first installment is the depth of story and the quality of the acting. We learn a lot more about Katniss. Who does she love, and to what degree? What sacrifices must she make in her life to fit in and protect the people she loves. If you think about it, we all do similar things in our own lives. We socialize for the sake of our families or our careers, when a lot of the time we would rather spend our free moments pursuing things that we enjoy. Many of us give up things for our children or ailing relatives. We can identify with Katniss, even though we won't be asked to fight to the death. As for the acting, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and others, give the characters more depth than in the first movie. We are also given more information about Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). I wonder how much of this is due to Simon Beaufoy's part in the screenplay? He's on a roll after writing Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.One of the best scenes comes early in the movie as Katniss and Peeta deviate from their prepared agenda during a tour of the other districts. Instead of mouthing the carefully prepared scripts, they choose to make a more meaningful contribution. I won't reveal what happens, but it's a memorable scene.The Capitol is portrayed as being particularly evil in this sequel, just in case you were in any doubt. Its dubious agenda is enforced by stormtroopers who look like they stepped straight out of Star Wars. Although some of the first 90 minutes is fairly predictable fare, I welcomed the chance to explore this world and its characters in more depth. It's hard to care about someone if you don't understand who they are, or what they are fighting for. Francis Lawrence did a great job of avoiding clumsy exposition in I Am Legend, and he avoids that trap in Catching Fire too. Instead of spelling out the reason for every little action, he allows scenes to naturally unfold so that we can see their significance for ourselves.Fans of action might be disappointed with Catching Fire. It takes a long time for the tributes to make it into the arena, and once there, they rely more on alliances than before. This story is more about teamwork and figuring out who is good or evil than it is about slaughtering everyone in sight. It's a richer story overall.Another reason for disappointment might be the abrupt ending. Like The Lord of the Rings, the story is split into several parts, and this second installment of four won't have a conclusion that neatly resolves all of the conflict. For that, you'll need to see the next two movies.I think that Francis Lawrence has improved upon the first installment significantly, and I'll be seeing how things pan out. I might even read Suzanne Collins' trilogy before I see Mockingjay Part 1 next year.",4,More depth and characterization than the first movie,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,5238,"['review', 'Hunger',

I guess if you are around 12 it would be the best thing ever, but having read the book I thought it stunk! The plot is poorly developed, the acting was wooden, and if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't have any idea what was going on.Okay, in all fairness, there were some good points.  But why suddenly introduce the extreme amount of coolness between Katness and Peeta.  That was barely alluded to in the first film but, whoa, they hate each other in this film?  What's up with that?  And this film implies that Katness had two lovers, Peeta and Gale.  The book makes this much clearer.  The relationship with Gale was strong but they were not lovers. Also the relationship with Petta was more like gradual acceptance.  She does not suddenly take him to bed  The kissing with Gale and taking Petta to bed is too confusing. It happens in the book but in a much difference context. The sudden takeover of district 12 was also much clearer in the book.  The scenes in the arena make no sense and even though we know there's another movie in the trilogy what kind of ending was that?  The gamemaker is suddenly on the good side?  And the comment by Haymitch, &#34;That's why we don't let you make the plans&#34;, is in context in the book, but what does it mean in the movie?.The book &#34;Catching Fire&#34; is excellent, perhaps the best of the three.  It is rich in plot development, the characters, especially Haymitch, are much more real, and the arena makes more sense.A couple of more comments-How come the picture of Rue is still on the floor when the book makes it clear it was cleaned up and the writing &#34;Senna Crane' Is barely visible on the dummy.I agree with President Snow.

1567276,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUS5A,The People's Critic,"[14, 20]","Four years ago, I was having a conversation with some of my high school students regarding what books they like to read.  One fairly astute young man, whom I held in high regard, told me he was reading a book called The Hunger Games.  He said it was about a supposed utopian North American society that holds annual organized battles to the death to maintain order throughout the numerous districts.  It sounded interesting, but I was not that impressed as my critical mind, still reeling from the absurdity that was (and still is) the Twilight &#8220;saga,&#8221; began its prejudicial routine of condemning most young-adult literature as being dumbed down versions of classics in order to make cash grabs at an increasingly illiterate reader-population.  However, this one particular student&#8217;s recommendation obliged me to forgo my rant about Brave New World, The Giver, 1984, and the host of other &#8220;Big Brother is watching you&#8230;&#8221; examples and give this one a try.  Now, as the adaptation of the book series&#8217; second novel comes to the big screen, I confess myself as a fan awaiting the return, with millions of others, of Katniss Everdean to the big screen.2012&#8217;s The Hunger Games was a tremendous hit automatically green lighting the entire film franchise and splitting its final entry, Mockingjay, into two separate films.  This year&#8217;s film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (or Hunger Games: Fire by some people &#8211; you know who you are) is based on perhaps the best book of the trilogy and finds our heroine, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) back home in District 12 awaiting the annual victory tour that follows the 74th Hunger Games and precedes the 75th.  President Snow (Donald Sutherland) remains none too pleased as Katniss and Peeta&#8217;s (Josh Hutcherson) risky move in the previous games showed an unexpected weakness in his control and has sparked a sort of uprising in some of the poorer districts.  The 75th Hunger Games offers Snow an opportunity, as every 25 years marks a quarter-quell, a special competition that gives Snow and his new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a chance to even the score.Much of what makes The Hunger Games: Catching Fire work comes from the source material.  This entry in the series has many more tricks up its sleeve than the previous film.  That being said, the trio of screen writers (including author Suzanne Collins herself) and new director, Francis Lawrence have noticeably shifted the film&#8217;s focus away from the characters and more to the atmosphere, themes, and events set in action from the first film.  In fact, the writing is bit edgier leading to some extra spirited dialogue especially from Peeta and Heavensbee.  Accordingly, this film has a different feel and agenda, which keeps the series fresh, but also may disquiet fans who want more Katniss.  That is not to say, Ms. Everdeen is not the film&#8217;s shining star, she is, and her love triangle between Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta continues to be provocative rather than stale and arbitrary.  Lawrence continues down her path to being the most beloved starlet of her generation by authentically representing Katniss&#8217;s struggle between newfound fame and inherent defiance.  Furthermore, she is supported by a very recognizable A-List cast.  However, saying much more about the cast or plot would ruin some of the film&#8217;s best surprises.One surprise worth ruining is Jena Malone&#8217;s role in the film.  It should come as no surprise that there is another reeping, and there is another host of tributes.  Malone plays the highly anticipated Johanna Mason from District 7, and she steals every scene she&#8217;s a part of &#8211; possibly making her the best new element of the film.Altogether, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a fine adaptation of Collins&#8217;s novel, and it is a highly entertaining film as well, ascetically edging out its predecessor.

I really like the Hunger Games trilogy of books, and have been impressed overall with the two movies I've seen, and look forward to the first half of Mockingjay.

I would not have been sorry to have seen Catching Fire broken into two movies, or at least a longer first movie.

1567278,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFUS5A,Todd Smith,"[2, 3]","Fans of the Hunger Games were dissapointed with the first movie and rightfully so. The film was pretty good, but didn't do the book justice, as it was extremely toned down and nowhere near as in depth as the book was. With a new director for the second book, they did not make the same mistake twice. As someone who has read all the books, I can tell you that Catching Fire is page for page exactly like the book. It was so amazing how much of the book is captured on the screen, as I actually saw the scenes play out the exact same way they did in my head when I first read Catching Fire. Everything down to the last detail is perfect! Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson return and are both fantastic, so good in fact, that I really wonder if Suzanne Collins had them in mind when she wrote this series. The casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, and the direction is perfect. For those of you who never read the series and didn't really see what was so special about the first film, I really suggest that you give this film a chance. I won't give anything away, but this isn't what you expect, especially the ending, and while there are two more films remaining, this will be your last look inside the arena. After Catching Fire, the series turns into something completely different and that's what I love about it. It would have been simple to have three books about the games, but the games are actually a small part of the second film, and won't take place in the next two films. Rarely do I give a film 5 stars, but the second Hunger Games film is done so much better than the first. They don't hold anything back in this one, and you are introduced to a whole other set of unique characters, that you will be seeing in the other films. The cast is brilliant and new Director, Francis Lawrence, manages to capture essence of the book and bring it to life on the big screen, with unbelievable detail. If you didn't read the books and just don't understand what's so great about this series, go see this movie.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,2021,"['Fans', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'were', 'dissapointed', 'first', 'movie', 'rightfully', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'was', 'extremely', 'toned', 'down', 'nowhere', 'near', 'depth', 'book', 'was', 'new', 'director', 'second', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'twice', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'tell', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'page', 'page', 'exactly', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'book', 'captured', 'screen', 'actually', 'saw', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'head', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'Everything', 'down', 'last', 'detail', 'perfect', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'return', 'are', 'fantastic', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'really', 'wonder', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'series', 'casting', 'perfect', 'acting', 'perfect', 'direction', 'perfect', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'suggest', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""n't"", 'what', 'expect', 'especially', 'ending', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'remaining', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'look', 'arena', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'series', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'what', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'have', 'three', 'books', 'games', 'games', 'are', 'actually', 'small', 'part', 'second', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'Rarely', 'do', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'second', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'film', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'anything', 'back', 'one', 'are', 'introduced', 'whole', 'other', 'set', 'unique', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'other', 'films', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'new', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'capture', 'essence', 'book', 'bring', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'unbelievable', 'detail', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'series', 'go', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

1567286,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008JFUS5A,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[101, 127]","While not perfect, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is that rarity among sequels:  it is decidedly better than the first film.  Credit for this achievement goes deservedly to the new team behind Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence (Water For Elephants, I Am Legend) brings a surer hand to the action and the pacing, and cinematographer Jo Willems gives the world of Hunger Games a feel of seamless reality that seemed missing from the first film.  But the biggest credit should go to the veteran (and Academy Award-winning) writers, Simon Beaufoy (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and The Full Monty) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3) who not only managed to produce a tighter and more vivid screenplay from Suzanne Collins' novel, they also managed to compensate for the principal problem with the second novel, i.e. that much of the plot device-wise was a repeat of the first novel. One of the most noticeable ways the writers dealt with this was in how they gave the actors more opportunities to give depth to their characters, so that even though the core dilemma was the same, the events mattered because we cared more about the characters.Anyone who has read the novels already knows most of the plot as Catching Fire, like Hunger Games, follows the book on which it was based for the most part.  Note: if you haven't read the first book or seen the first movie, make sure you do at least one before seeing Catching Fire. Seriously. Background is important here and Catching Fire - quite rightly - doesn't waste a lot of time on flashbacks or lumpy exposition. For anyone who's only seen the first movie, I'm going to say very little about the plot to avoid any potential spoilers.The film picks up things shortly after where Hunger Games ended.  Despite all odds and against all precedent, both Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) managed to survive the 74th annual Hunger Games, games in which there is not supposed to be - and previously never had been - more than a single victor, i.e. survivor.  They return home to District 12, the poorest sector in the country of Panem, thinking that it's all over.  But just before Katniss and Peeta are to start a mandatory ""Victory Tour"" (read 'propaganda tour') of the country for the Capitol, Katniss receives an unexpected - and highly unwanted - visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who is quite angry with her for upsetting the rules and breaking precedent. In defying  the Capitol - on nationwide television no less! -  Katniss has unwittingly inspired rebellion in the districts.  Snow tells Katniss that she and Peeta must continue to pretend to be desperately in love on their Victory Tour, to preserve the illusion of government compassion, with the warning that failure to do so will result in her family being killed.  And so Katniss and Peeta set out, hoping that the tour will go smoothly. But things swiftly begin to unravel, and when the government announces that the 75th Hunger Games will be something called a Quarter Quell with a new very special rule added, they find out that far from being out of danger, the Hunger Games were only the beginning of their troubles.Without revealing anything else about the plot, I do have to say that Catching Fire really delivers with the ending, and the last shot of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss just by itself will leave you itching for Mockingjay Part I to come out.The acting in Catching Fire definitely gets cranked up a notch, again largely because the script gives the actors the chance to bring some depth to the characters but also because of a highly talented supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook, Winter's Bone) brings a certain subtlety to Katniss, coming across as awkward and almost reluctant to be in front of the camera at times. The thing is, this is exactly the Katniss portrayed in the books: awkward in social situations, thrust into a spotlight she never wanted, only feeling truly natural when she's bow-in-hand focused on survival, of others as well as her own. Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids Are All Right) remains perfect as Peeta, effortlessly inhabiting the role of the supportive and surprisingly creative nice guy whom fate continues to treat with ironic cruelty by tying him physically to Katniss but leaving her emotionally always out of reach.As always, Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, No Country For Old Men) steals every scene he's in as Haymitch, Katniss and Peeta's slovenly and hard-drinking coach who nonetheless actually gives them very solid advice.  I swear, Harrelson can take the most ordinary lines and turn them into absolute gems simply by the way he looks at people when he delivers them. More than any other actor I know, Harrelson seems to truly enjoy himself when acting and it really comes through in his performances. Much the same can also be said of Stanley Tucci (The Devil Wears Prada, Shall We Dance) who reprises his role as Caesar Flickerman, Panem's grandly over-the-top talk show host, who in turn was one of the best things in the first film. And special notice should be given to Elizabth Banks (Pitch Perfect, The Next Three Days) whose Effie Trinket was also a stand-out in the first film because this time around the script lets Banks bring some emotional depth to her character in subtle but very effective ways.Among the new characters that get introduced, Philip Seymour Hoffman has arguably the toughest job, walking a fine line as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new master of games who rose to his position after his predecessor in Hunger Games had an unfortunate encounter with some berries. The standout performances however are mostly among the veteran tributes from other districts. Jeffrey Wright (Boardwalk Empire) and Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction, The Fisher King) deliver as Beetee and Wiress, the two brainy tributes from the hi-tech District 3. Sam Claflin (The Pillars of the Earth, Snow White & the Huntsman) gives surprising depth to Finnick Odair, the seemingly perfect got-it-all-and-knows-it tribute from District 4. And Jena Malone (Sucker Punch) is awesome as Johanna Mason, the kick-ass attitude-to-the-max tribute from District 7. But personally I found the most moving performance was given by Lynn Cohen (Sex and the City) as Finnick's elderly fellow tribute, Mags. With no lines of dialogue, Cohen has to convey everything through her face and physical gestures, and she does this superbly, making you see what Katniss sees in her.On the somewhat minus side, Liam Hemsworth (Empire State) doesn't do much as Gale - Katniss' District 12 hunting partner and ostensible love-interest - but this is less the fault of the actor than it is simply that the demands of the plot don't allow him much on-screen time. AndDonald Sutherland's President Snow never quite seems to rise much above the level of stock villain, but this too is less the fault of the actor than a reflection of the fact that the character in the books was in truth rather sketchy and never really rose above stock villain level either.Overall, highly recommended as a better-than-expected follow-up to the first Hunger Games film and as a good solid action film in its own right.",4,Catching Fire catches fire,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,7275,"['not', 'perfect', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'rarity', 'sequels', 'decidedly',

At the end of the last Games, Catniss thumbed her nose at the sadistic power structure - something that President Snow took in a very personal way. That act of defiance (it looked more like survival at the time, but became a symbol of defiance) ignited something in the vast underclass, something that Snow needs to extinguish at any cost ...The first movie came across as teen power fantasy, thinly coated with chaste romance. Personalities get stronger in this one, like the quiet bravery of Catniss's sister, in her determination to support Caniss. Even the populace takes on a personality - wronged, hurt, looking for something better, and so bad off already that nothing can be worse. Effie, that outrageously costumed media figure, best known for being well known (sound familiar?) sees something too, in her pitiful attempts to ride Catniss's coat-tails. Her neediness becomes palpable in the ""We're a team, right?"" moments. Even Snow's grand-daughter, a ten-ish girl innocently following pop trends, takes on a deeper meaning when Catniss is the trend.Saying more would say too much, but there's something much bigger and deeper under way, something that doesn't become apparent until late in the story. It's doesn't give anything away to say that Catniss prevails, and on her own terms, and in a way that makes a sequel not just inevitable but necessary.

The movie was like the books - trapped with a logical progression into a predictable pattern and mindset.  Some of the action is obviously fake and some of the effects are very nice.

This is a teenager movie of daring do and fantasy.  In reality things just don't happen like this.

1567294,AP3B615GM191G,B008JFUS5A,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 3]","The first &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie's popularity to each person ran roughly equal to their enjoyment of the written works.  Essentially, how much you liked/disliked the book was exactly how much you liked/disliked the movie.  With &#34;Catching Fire&#34;, however, director Francis Lawrence actually turns in what may very well be a superior product to Suzanne Collins' tome.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Catching Fire&#34; sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back from their original Hunger Games experience now living on &#34;Panem's dime&#34; while on the promotional tour for the next games.  When President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesn't like the symbol that Katniss may be turning into, he rigs the upcoming Quarter Quell (75th edition of the Games) with a special new set of rules unprecedented in the history of the event.While the first &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie was impressive in its own right, I believe that &#34;Catching Fire&#34; is superior because it is a bit more &#34;versatile&#34;.  The original movie was very dark in tone and serious throughout.  I have read all the books, so I completely realized that the tone is quite serious, but I really appreciated the lighter moments of &#34;Catching Fire&#34;, those moments when I felt like it was okay to laugh or smile at something that was transpiring.The main cog in making the machine work is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss.  Other great performances from characters like Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) are packed with subtle nuances all their own, but it is truly Lawrence who holds this whole thing together.  Her screen presence alone is a force to be reckoned with.  Even if her portrayal of Katniss is quite a bit different (at least physical) from how she is portrayed in the books, Lawrence has easily made the character entirely her own.Thus, while the first movie in this series whetted my appetite for more, &#34;Catching Fire&#34; satiated the hunger by mixing some brevity and wit into some deadly serious subject matter.  It changes the style of the series-so-far while also staying pretty true to the source material.",5,Style Improves & Still True To Book,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,2298,"['first', '34', 'Hunger', 'Games', '34', 'movie', 'popularity', 'person', 'ran', 'roughly', 'equal', 'enjoyment', 'written', 'works', 'Essentially', 'how', 'much', 'liked/disliked', 'book', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'liked/disliked', 'movie', '34', 'Catching', 'Fire', '34', 'however', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'actually', 'what', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'superior', 'product', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'tome.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Catching', 'Fire', '34', 'sees', 'Katniss', 'Everdeen', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Peeta', 'Mellark', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'back', 'original', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'experience', 'now', 'living', '34', 'Panem', 'dime', '34', 'promotional', 'tour', 'next', 'games', 'When', 'President', 'Snow', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', ""n't"", 'like', 'symbol', 'Katniss', 'may', 'be', 'turning', 'upcoming', 'Quarter', 'Quell', '75th', 'edition', 'Games', 'special', 'new', 'set', 'rules', 'unprecedented', 'history', 'event.While', 'first', '34', 'Hunger', 'Games', '34', 'movie', 'was', 'impressive', 'own', 'right', 'believe', '34', 'Catching', 'Fire', '34', 'superior', 'bit', 'more', '34', 'versatile', '34', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'tone', 'serious', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'completely', 'realized', 'tone', 'quite', 'serious', 'really', 'appreciated', 'lighter', 'moments', '34', 'Catching', 'Fire', '34', 'moments', 'when', 'felt', 'was', 'okay', 'laugh', 'smile', 'something', 'was', 'transpiring.The', 'main', 'cog', 'making', 'machine', 'work', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Katniss', 'Other', 'great', 'performances', 'characters', 'Haymitch', 'Abernathy', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Gale', 'Hawthorne', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Effie', 'Trinket', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Caesar', 'Flickerman', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Primrose', 'Everdeen', 'Willow', 'Shields', 'are', 'packed', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'own', 'truly', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'screen', 'presence', 'alone', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Even', 'portrayal', 'Katniss', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'least', 'physical', 'how', 'portrayed', 'books', 'Lawrence', 'easily', 'made', 'character', 'entirely', 'own.Thus', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'more', '34', 'Catching', 'Fire', '34', 'satiated', 'hunger', 'mixing', 'brevity', 'wit', 'deadly', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'style', 'series-so-far', 'also', 'staying', 'pretty', 'true', 'source', 'material']",N/A
