864421,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0006A9FIM,,"[0, 0]","Wimbledon is one of those simple sweet love stories that are pretty good on a Saturday afternoon. The story has been told a million times, it is predictable, and is just a nice piece of romantic comedy.The tag line is told over a few too many times, he was ranked 14th but is no 119th in tennis. She is a new rising star in the tennis world. It seems like this should be A Star Is Born all over again (he's an old star that is on his way down, he discovers her, she turns into a superstar while he wallows in defeat). In fact, it isn't that story at all. It is a simple story - they are just two sweet people that meet and start a relationship. There isn't nearly as much conflict, and that is a good thing.Kirsten Dunst is sweet as Lizzie the hot new tennis star. Paul Bettany as Peter Cole the former tennis star seems miscast at first. He looks old in the earlier parts of the film. Later on he seems to get younger and more handsome. The two don't make a perfect couple, just a decent one. The two grew on me. The supporting cast was good. Jon Favreau makes an appearance as an agent in the film. He didn't add much to the film. His character distracted and confused the main plot line.The tennis scenes are acceptable. There are a few moments where players do things nobody would ever do on a tennis court. Neither actor is a tennis player that would be at Wimbledon, their form is off enough. On the other hand, this is a fluffy story, so I could excuse some lapses of realism. Overall, they didn't juice up the tennis play too much.The film is rated PG-13 but might be better off for slightly more mature younger viewers. There is no nudity in the film, apart from Kirsten Dunst's beautiful naked profile hinted at through a foggy shower door. Sex is hinted at a lot, including somebody watching Deep Throat while riding a bike. The act is never shown, just hinted and a lot of sound effects. There is some strong language. There is no violence or gore.As a simple, predictable, fluffy romantic story, this film works just fine. I liked the film more at the end.

864426,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B0006A9FIM,,"[1, 1]","I play tennis frequently and like to watch it on TV, and my wife likes romantic comedies, so this movie was a very good blend for our tastes. On top of that, I really enjoyed the film and found it an above average comedy, since it delivers great laughs in an unexplored topic with good actors.Everything starts with Peter Colt (Bettany) playing in one of the tournaments that serve as a preparation for Wimbledon. He is in the declining stage of his career, since he is thirty-one and lately he has been consistently crushed by up and coming young players. This explains his current ranking, 119th in the world, which has dropped considerable from his best at 11th. In most people's mind he has another point against him, he is a rich kid, and it is common belief that you need to be really hungry to be a top player and succeed.Wimbledon looks like Peter's last chance to achieve his dream (same as every pro player in the world has), and the experience starts better than he expected, right from the moment he arrives at his hotel. A mix-up with the room assignments ends up with him going into the room of Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst), an American star expected to win the female singles. After seeing her in the shower, Peter's day clearly improves. When later they start a relationship, the plot evolves around whether it is possible for them to have this and still be focused on the tournament or not.Having Pat Cash as an advisor certainly helped to make the tennis aspects more believable, for example we get to see how superstitious tennis players are. When Peter starts winning he does not want to change to a better hotel room, similar to what Gustavo Kuerten did when he was an unknown player and ended up winning Roland Garros. Some other aspects of the movie also shown similarities with the real world of pro tennis, like Lizzie's relationship with her controlling father, bringing to mind the cases of many famous females players in the tour.The movie is an above average comedy because the subject matter is original and it has the power of keeping us interested throughout the almost two hours it runs for. Dunst and Bettany are very good in their roles, and I was surprised when I found out that none of them had played tennis before. Even though in the scenes showing games the ball was not actually directed by the hitting of the actors, but rather through CGI, they had to mimic the strokes, and for beginners these were pretty good (Pat Cash's influence again). For many couples out there in which the guy does not really like romantic comedies, and the gal does not like sports, this may be a perfect compromise.",4,"""Hit this one and I'll sleep with you""",1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,2631,"['play', 'tennis', 'frequently', 'watch', 'TV', 'wife', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'blend', 'tastes', 'top', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'above', 'average', 'comedy', 'great', 'laughs', 'unexplored', 'topic', 'good', 'actors.Everything', 'starts', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'Bettany', 'playing', 'one', 'tournaments', 'serve', 'preparation', 'Wimbledon', 'declining', 'stage', 'career', 'thirty-one', 'lately', 'been', 'consistently', 'crushed', 'coming', 'young', 'players', 'current', 'ranking', '119th', 'world', 'dropped', 'considerable', 'best', '11th', 'most', 'people', 'mind', 'point', 'rich', 'kid', 'common', 'belief', 'need', 'be', 'really', 'hungry', 'be', 'top', 'player', 'succeed.Wimbledon', 'looks', 'Peter', 'last', 'chance', 'achieve', 'dream', 'same', 'pro', 'player', 'world', 'experience', 'better', 'expected', 'right', 'moment', 'hotel', 'mix-up', 'room', 'assignments', 'up', 'going', 'room', 'Lizzie', 'Bradbury', 'Dunst', 'American', 'star', 'expected', 'win', 'female', 'singles', 'seeing', 'shower', 'Peter', 'day', 'clearly', 'improves', 'When', 'later', 'start', 'relationship', 'plot', 'possible', 'have', 'still', 'be', 'focused', 'tournament', 'not.Having', 'Pat', 'Cash', 'advisor', 'certainly', 'helped', 'make', 'tennis', 'more', 'believable', 'example', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'superstitious', 'tennis', 'players', 'are', 'When', 'Peter', 'winning', 'not', 'want', 'change', 'better', 'hotel', 'room', 'similar', 'what', 'Gustavo', 'Kuerten', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'unknown', 'player', 'ended', 'up', 'winning', 'Roland', 'Garros', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'also', 'shown', 'similarities', 'real', 'world', 'pro', 'tennis', 'Lizzie', 'relationship', 'controlling', 'father', 'bringing', 'mind', 'cases', 'many', 'famous', 'females', 'players', 'tour.The', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'comedy', 'subject', 'matter', 'original', 'power', 'keeping', 'interested', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'Dunst', 'Bettany', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'none', 'had', 'played', 'tennis', 'Even', 'scenes', 'showing', 'games', 'ball', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'directed', 'hitting', 'actors', 'rather', 'CGI', 'had', 'mimic', 'strokes', 'beginners', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Pat', 'Cash', 'influence', 'again', 'many', 'couples', 'out', 'there', 'guy', 'not', 'really', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'gal', 'not', 'like', 'sports', 'may', 'be', 'perfect', 'compromise']",N/A

864429,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0006A9FIM,,"[1, 1]","Paul Bettany's rangy, startling looks make him difficult to pigeonhole into any one sort of role.  He's mostly known for period pieces and unsettling baddie parts.  So it's refreshing to see him as the romantic lead in this frothy confection set in the high echelons of pro tennis.  His Peter Colt, a fading player facing down his 30s reflects with much interior angst on the impending demise of his disappointing professional tennis career, in which the high point was once briefly being ranked 11th in the world.  Having unexpectedly won a wild-card slot at Wimbledon, he's resigned to losing in the first round and announcing his retirement, upon which he will be forced to coach randy country club cougars for a living.  But then, in a Meet Cute that could only happen in this kind of movie, he encounters rising American tennis sensation Lizzie Bradbury (think McEnroe in a skirt), and an unlikely romance ensues.  What starts as a carnal fling over fish and chips develops into something deeper; even more surprising, Peter keeps winning his matches,  astounding himself even more than the whole of England.  Is Lizzie his soul mate--or a human good luck charm?  Or both?  Bettany effortlessly slips on the mantle of self-deprecating charmer unaware of his own appeal from Hugh Grant, but with a good deal less bumbling than Hugh Grant used to do.  He is, after all, supposed to be an elite athlete, and he looks the part of a professional tennis player quite convincingly.  He towers over his petite, considerably younger co-star, who is over-matched in both the tennis and acting departments, but these two sell their quirky blond pairing, and it works.  What sets this project a cut above other attempts at `sporty romances' (think `Cutting Edge') is its air of authenticity:  shot on location at Wimbledon and stuffed with real tennis talent, you can't fake this kind of detail.  Is it realistic to think that a player languishing at 119th could win a berth in the men's final at Wimbledon, AND find true love on the grass courts with a brash Yankee gal he's known for all of 2 weeks?  No on both counts--but that's precisely why we watch these movies, because in the rom-com universe, these kinds of happy accidents are the norm, and we can imagine they could happen to us.  By film's end, Bettany has convinced us that they couldn't have happened to a more deserving bloke.  From the producers of ""Notting Hill"" and the Bridget Jones movies, this one also boasts their hallmark bubbly score and views of a cheerful, affluent London where the sun actually shines more than it rains.

864431,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006A9FIM,,"[1, 1]","This is a now familiar trinity of film companies -- Universal, Canal Plus, and Working Title joined forces again to produce a romantic comedy featuring Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst.  The film is made with golden formula -- two likeable characters, one from America meets the other from England, both falling in love with each other.  Though 'Wimbledom' is no 'Four Wedding' or 'Nottinghill,' it is still very charming in its own way, largely thanks to Bettany who keeps on surprising and amusing audiences with his down-to-earth persona.Though you think Ms. Dunst is the star of the film (after her 'Spider-man' success), the film is virtualy about one Peter Colt (Bettany), English veteran professional tennis player who is thinking about retirement.  When Paul wearily participates in Wimbledom tournament using wild card, thinking this is his last entry in this prestigious games, he meets a young, lovely, upcoming star of the court, Lizzie (Dunst).Like Hugh and Julia in 'Nottinghill,' she falls in love with him, a bit too suddenly.  There are some obstacles between them including the media and the lack of confidence on Englishman's side -- like 'Nottinghill' again -- but the old-fashioned ending is there, you can see it from miles away.  Paul is surrounded by unique characters, his daddy living in the tree house, his brother always betting on his opponents, and the ladies at tennis club, as 'occupational hazzards.'  At first look, the film's script seems done by someone like Richard Curtis, but in fact it is not.  (It is by Adam Brooks, 'Practical Magic,' the sequel to 'Bridgit Jones' and Jennifer Flackett & Mark Levin.)Richard Loncraine helms the whole film fairly well, but the film's charms all come from the two leading actors, especially Paul Bettany.  His apparently tired attitudes suddenly change into unexpected defiance, expressing the subtle moment of life when you choose the quiet resignation or the smallest hope.  In short, he is an old underdog who is allowed to win for the last time, and his acting is superb enough to cover the lack of  chemistry between him and Dunst.The story is predictable, but that's nothing bad in this film.  You wish Paul Colt to win the game, and Lizzie's love too, and you certainly get what you want.

But what that really means is this - 118 guys out there are faster, stronger, better and younger. And it gets you thinking"".The plot of this movie is simple: two professional tennis players meet at Wimbledom, and start falling in love. One is Peter Cort (Paul Bettany), playing his last tournament before retirement, and very accustomed to losing. The other is Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), a budding tennis star playing her first Wimbledom, a young woman that loves to win and is good at it. Their relationship starts to have unexpected results, as Lizzie impresses on Peter some of her on-court aggressiveness, and he stars to win, to the amazement of everybody (including himself). Of course, there is more to the plot of this film than that, but what would be the point of watching it then?.All in all, I can say that I was unexpectedly surprised by this film.

Paul Bettany is playing a pro that was once ranked number eleven on the tennis circuit and has fallen to 119th at the beginning of the movie. Paul's character has given up on his professional tennis career but has drawn the wild card spot at Wimbledon.Our two stars have great chemistry on film and it flows through to the characters. And of course Wimbledon is a co-star of this film. Besides the romantic comedy this movie is supposed to be, it also does a wonderful job of showing the inner workings of Pro Tennis. The tennis through out this movie looks real. The director has succeeded in making the actors look like great players. And the stress and determination it takes to play the game at this level.This movie is actually two movies combined into one.

She is like a sunnier Claire Danes to me (both are horribly underrated as actresses).  I'll pretty much watch her in anything.Paul Bettany is one of those actors who has garnered a huge fan base even if he has yet to really break out into the mainstream.  He has graced quite a few great films, and has proven to be a steady and in-depth supporting actor, delivering great comic relief (`A Knights Tale'), supportive reliability (`A Beautiful Mind', `Master and Commander') and even disturbing romantic tension (`Dogville').  He is, in a word, brilliant.Both of these actors are far better than `Wimbledon'.This is not a bad film, at all, but it is not a great one either.  It misses a lot of opportunities to give us something special, especially with the cast it has.  It offers us nothing new, and the storyline is so predictable and clich&eacute; ridden that it is really a very unnecessary film.  The one highlight here is the delightful performances by the two leads.  Dunst and Bettany are stunning together and really elevate this `been-there-done-that' tale of two star-crossed lovers.Bettany plays Peter Colt, a one time tennis champ (11th in the world) who has had a long string of bad luck leaving him ranking in the triple digits.  Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) is a young and vibrant player who is doing remarkably well.  When all feels lost, Colt meets and falls for Bradbury.  As to be expected, his game improves thanks their love affair while hers suffers.The film is funny and it has charm, thanks to the impressive cast.  Bettany and Dunst are not the only noteworthy actors here.  Sam Neill proves yet again that he is criminally underused in Hollywood, and the young (and now extremely adored) James McAvoy makes a really nice addition to the cast, proving why he is on the cuffs of major stardom.  I enjoyed this film, and I'm sure that you will too.  I just wish that it could have broken out of the conventional romantic comedy mold.  I wish that the script could have had the same spice and texture that the lead actors brought to their roles.If this had stared two actors less competent and engaging I would have given this a C+, but the chemistry between the two leads alone brings my grade up to a B.

What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game.  Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain.  The problem is that, as Peter`s game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie`s seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple`s burgeoning relationship.Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen.  It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!).  Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned.  It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it.  And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.""Wimbledon"" is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story.

The catch is that Peter's game seems to drastically improve the more he sees Lizzie while her game begins to worsen.Like I said, it's nothing we haven't seen but Kirsten is delightful as always and a joy to watch interact with Paul, who while he isn't the strongest leading man still offers up the same wit and charm that we saw him develop in `A Knights Tale'.

From what I read, Colt meant to be played by Hugh Grant too but due to his commitment elsewhere, Brittany took his place instead.  In fact, the Colt's character suited him to the dots and tees.  Colt was a retiring professional tennis player that had passed his prime and someone who's talented but lacking of self-belief and conviction.  Then, his world was turned upside by meeting the feisty but talented female tennis player in the form of Kirsten Dunst.  They fall for one another instantly to much the dismay of Kirsten's character's ambitious father, suitably played by Sam Neill.  Talking about art imitates art!!  Haven't we read about Mary Pierce's father, Jelena Dokic's father and even Maria Sharapova's father?  That gives the reader an idea, no?  Anyway, inspired by his new found flame, Colt became a more rounded player whilst Kirsten's character's game was falling apart.  This is a classic feel-good movie where in fictitious term, England gets to finally  win the silver plate back and that the top guy wins his girl.  Originally, I thought the movie would be dull but surprisingly, it's fun and gripping to watch.  In the end, I really vouched for Colt to win.  Simplicity in this movie is deceptive and the extra features showed how to make the actors and actresses into professional players, the significance of CGIs.  Professional players such as McEnroe, Everts gave this movie some credibility and technical advisor in the form of Pat Cash helped too.  The players commented that what made this movie real to them was the fact that the inner voices that kept talking to them and that's when they need to focus preventing themselves from being choked at the crucial moments.

864455,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006A9FIM,,"[4, 10]","Was the purpose of this Hollywood film to see how just how many clich&eacute;s they could fit into a two hour timeframe?  Perhaps it was just I, but I counted nearly twenty in the first hour.  From the accidental meeting to the overuse of the ""good luck charm"" theme, Hollywood successfully packed in these and a bunch more for this little British film.  With clich&eacute;s weighting down the truck of this ride, we also have two actors helming it that need more skill in the romantic comedy genre, or else they may find themselves veering off the road and down a steep hill crashing into more and more poor films.  Bettany was not a substitute for the Hugh Grant style of British acting that this film desperately needed, while Kirsten Dunst is not aging well at all.  Her acting seems to be depleting with her charm and looks, causing us to actually watch the tennis games in this film instead of their performances.  Thankfully, we had these CGI tennis matches to watch, which was the only eye-catching element to this entire film.  It covered the element that Bettany and Dunst were lacking, which was talent.So, was I too harsh with the beginning paragraph?  I don't think so.  What could have been a decent film with better British actors and a stronger leading lady, eventually fell apart with the nonchalant emotion of Bettany and the ""collecting my paycheck"" style of acting from Dunst.  Even veteran actor Sam Neill couldn't escape the clutches of clich&eacute; as he played the same father-esque figure that we have seen time and time again in this genre of film.  I hope his paycheck will go to the reconstruction of the broken nerves in his face that were unusable in this film thus giving us a reason why his character did not smile nor show any form of emotion towards his daughter or boyfriend.  It was as if he was rehearsing for a role in The Stepford Wives instead of this movie.  These three actors literally gave the worst performances of their career.  They never broke their own mold, but simply followed the lines and direction given to them from the script.  If the script itself could have done its own acting, this may have been a better film.  Instead we are lead on an emotional carriage ride that has squares for wheels and seems to be lost the entire time.  If I had to give a reason as to why this film was not as successful in the box office as it could have been, I would have to say it was the acting.  It really slumped this film deeper into a darkened corner.If one can look past the acting, there really isn't anything else to see.  Lacking the excitement from a sports film, even if it is tennis, director Richard Loncraine follows the same route as every other sports film released by Hollywood.  Imagination was not a prerequisite for making this movie.  From the overplayed underdog story, to the forced connection between Dunst and Bettany, to finally the unemotional ending, Loncraine gives nothing short of disaster.  When these films are being produced by the dozens in Hollywood, it is your job as the director to give us something new.  Either a fresh face, or a fresh course of events.  Do not fall into the same clich&eacute;s over and over again, as it seems that Loncraine has opted to do (referencing my comment about packing as many clich&eacute;s as possible into this film).If I must note only one good thing about this film, I would have to go with the use of CGI.  Apparently, the graphics department was ordered to use their imagination to give us a new perspective on the game and to freshen up the look of tennis.  This was successful as I thought that the uses of CGI to capture the effects of the ball on the court were outstanding.  It is an element not used often enough in sporting films, so it provided some ease to my eyes that were swollen from the rest of this picture.  As I think about it, even the CGI was a bit disappointing because it proved that the actors were not actually playing the sport, thus only destroying whatever believe we had in their feeble characters.  Oh well, I tried.Finally, I would like to say that I was a bit disturbed by the idea of Bettany and Dunst together.  I felt that their relationship was built upon Bettany doing better at the game.  She was his good luck charm.  He knew that from the beginning, yet decided to stay with her to help him reach new heights of fame and fortune.  He, in other words, used her.  Director Richard Loncraine does a fantastic job of avoiding this issue and placing the entire emphasis on love.  That is all fine and dandy, but we need reality to take into effect her and demonstrate that without Dunst, Bettany would have ultimately failed.  Loncraine tries to give us some explanation at the end of the film (not to give anything away), but is unsuccessful because of the clich&eacute; surrounding it.  I personally thought there was no emotion between the two love interests, only this dark addiction to being victorious that kept these two together (or at least one rushing after the other).  Think about this as you watch the movie.Overall, this film was pitiful.  Nothing in it was spectacular, nothing was imaginative, and nothing sparked any bit of creativity or excitement for me to pick up a tennis ball and begin playing again.  Bettany and Dunst gave the worst performances of their careers as they stumbled through the emotions and lines of this film.  With these two hardly showing any skill it was only a matter of time that the remaining elements followed suit.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"I'll jump!

However, was I ever surprised at the film I got.  First of all, Dunst does give us one of her better performances.  She's a driven tennis player with a smart mouth and eagerness to win at all costs.  As with most parts she plays, even the ones she's not so good at, Dunst is able to draw us into the psyche of the character.  However, the real breakout in this film is Paul Bettany.  Bettany gives us an insider's view of a tennis player in his 30s who is getting too old to win against the teenage up-and-comers.  This Wimbeldon tournament will be his last and he hopes to take home the tropy for himself and his country.  It is this behind the scenes view of the tennis world that makes the film most interesting and you really start to root for Bettany's underdog character to take home the championship.  Along the way, you also start to root for the burgeoning relationship between Dunst and Bettany's charatcers.  One other great thing about this film is its English setting and the quirky English actors throughout.  James McAvoy as Bettany's brother is absolutely hilarious; although, it is hard to believe that the dark-haired, several inches shorter actor could be Bettany's brother.  Also fabulous are Bernard Hill (Lord of the Rings' King Theoden) and Elanor Bron as Bettany's parents.  Although the ending is a little too saccharine, it doesn't deter from an otherwise great film.  Bettany and Dunst has great chemistry together and the insider's view of tennis, of Wimbeldon, is very interesting.

Paul Bettany plays an old man in a young mans game, in this his last Wimbledon tournament as a ""wild card"" entry, before fading into obscurity as a Tennis Pro for a nouveau riche London country club. Enter Kirsten Dunst, as a vibrant young superstar in the making, fiercely guarded by coach and father Sam Neill, who has aspirations for her to be the next big thing. An unlikely chemistry appears between these two very different players, who almost fall unwittingly fall into a pre match ""workout"" style fling. His game improves ten fold, whilst hers begins to suffer under the unwelcome (as seen by her father) distraction of a boyfriend of any kind. One or two little tiny comic subplots lace the back story, and we are kept guessing as to the outcome of it all, however apparent it may seem to begin with. Is Ms Dunst just having fun? Is this love at first stroke? Will she lose? Will he win against all odds? Much fun is had along the way at a little under two hours in an old fashioned love tug sort of way, with some inventive camerawork and direction, and wonderful cameos from the likes of John McEnroe, and Chris Evert. Bettany is excellent, and a believable tennis pro (considering he couldn't play before filming) and although Ms Dunst hardly has to delve into her acting bag of tricks, the film has more in the merit than complaints department, for me anyway. Probably not huge on the repeat viewing scale once you know the end of the movie, but if you are looking for some clean romantic fun, a good story, and good acting, look no further. 4 stars is a little generous, but still a lot of fun.

This one has a tennis theme, so naturally I checked it out as soon as it became available on DVD.British journeyman pro Peter Colt, played in a bit of stellar casting by Brit actor Paul Bettany, has never quite made it to the top, and is now resigned to the end of a long career. He's got a wild card for Wimbledon, and plans to announce his retirement after the prestigious tournament ends. When a mistaken room assignment brings him to the suite of American star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) - romantic sparks fly as the repartee flows - she behind the frosted shower glass, he bags in hand in the hall. It's all great fun, and we know right away this one's gonna be good.When in a surprise, Peter wins his first match on court 17, things begin to look up for him. The romance is right on track too, as the two discuss the merits of fooling around on the night before a big match - over fish and chips, no less.For Peter, fooling around seems to have hurt his game. His second round match is a budding disaster. He's headed for defeat until who should show up but Lizzie to cheer him on. In a stunning turn of events, he plays for her and wins. A streak that continues when in round 3 Peter dispatches his best friend and practice partner Nikolaj (Dieter Prohl) - despite the increasingly evident disapproval of Lizzie's driven father and coach, Dennis (Sam Neill), and the re-appearance of Peter's long absent agent Ron (Jon Favreau).Meanwhile, Peter's dysfunctional family add really great touches of color. His feuding mother and father (Bernard Hill and Eleanor Bron)have reached the point where his father has moved to the treehouse in the back yard of the mansion, and his younger brother Carl (James McAvoy) provides comic relief as to the disgust of the bookies at the betting shop he bets against his brother(""He's been on such a good losing streak."").All told, Wimbledon is a light-hearted love story with a strong sports angle filled with great one-liners and several nice little plot threads that add up to an outstanding whole.

As a big fan of both BRIDGET JONES' DIARY and NOTTING HILL I suspected the decision would mean few hours of precious sleep before stumbling out of the house on the way to work this morning.Yep, I sat their engrossed in the unfolding drama, and yes it meant I was still happily glued to the movie as my alarm clock slid past 2 a.m., but this movie not only met my expectations but exceeded them in all its free-spirited warm fuzzies.The story has been done before - boy meets girl, girls father attempts to keep them apart, boy loses girl and then well - you need to watch the movie for that answer. However this movie is a winner because the backdrop (Wimbledon) provides for some nerve wrenching moments and tension and the other movies of this ilk did not star Paul Bettany (the same actor who proved great comic timing in A KNIGHT'S TALE) and Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has never particularly impressed me before and I never found her terribly attractive, yet she looks stunningly gorgeous in this movie and plays her part of the young tennis prot&eacute;g&eacute; to perfection.Bettany plays the part of a has-been tennis player named Peter Colt who (after being ranked #11 in the world some years before) wins a wildcard spot at Wimbledon which he accepts as a last hurrah before taking on the tennis pro position at a snooty English social club. There he meets up with aspiring young tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) who is competing in her first Wimbledon under the watchful eye of her father (played by Sam Neill sporting a horrible American accent).Following a mix up over rooms and some other comic  misadventures the two gradually fall in love (although neither seems ready to admit it) and as Colt's game improves and he advances further into the tournament, Lizzie's game deteriorates.I'm not sure if I bought Bettany and Dunst as a couple, the two certainly have a chemistry and Bettany is his usual charming self, but something about it didn't quite gel for me. But this is a minor quibble because everything else works perfectly and I don't think I have ever seen tennis portrayed so dramatically on screen. The movie also features a number of tennis greats in front of the camera (including Chris Evert and John McEnroe) to add a further sense pf realism to the proceedings.Adding to this movie on DVD is a nice set of special features that include three short featurettes. They focus on the movie in general, the use of Wimbledon as a location and the tennis training that all the actors had to undertake (incredibly neither Bettany or Dunst were tennis players before starting work on this picture). There is also the theatrical trailer and a nicely relaxed commentary supplied by director Richard Loncraine and Bettany. You know you are in for a fun ride when Loncraine jokingly explains that Bettany insisted on being present so he (Loncraine) would not take all the credit for the movie.This is a great movie and I will probably find myself watching it a second time before the weekend arrives - though at a more sensible time of the day.",5,If you loved Notting Hill you will adore this movie,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,3170,"['knew', 'was', 'probably', 'making', 'mistake', 'late', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'WIMBLEDON', 'DVD', 'player', 'big', 'fan', 'BRIDGET', 'JONES', 'DIARY', 'NOTTING', 'HILL', 'suspected', 'decision', 'would', 'mean', 'few', 'hours', 'precious', 'sleep', 'stumbling', 'house', 'way', 'work', 'morning.Yep', 'sat', 'engrossed', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'yes', 'meant', 'was', 'still', 'happily', 'glued', 'movie', 'alarm', 'clock', 'slid', 'past', '2', 'a.m.', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'met', 'expectations', 'exceeded', 'free-spirited', 'warm', 'fuzzies.The', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girls', 'father', 'attempts', 'keep', 'apart', 'boy', 'girl', 'then', 'well', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'answer', 'However', 'movie', 'winner', 'backdrop', 'Wimbledon', 'nerve', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'tension', 'other', 'movies', 'ilk', 'did', 'not', 'star', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'proved', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'A', 'KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Dunst', 'never', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'never', 'found', 'terribly', 'attractive', 'yet', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'part', 'young', 'tennis', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'perfection.Bettany', 'plays', 'part', 'has-been', 'tennis', 'player', 'named', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'who', 'being', 'ranked', '11', 'world', 'years', 'wildcard', 'spot', 'Wimbledon', 'last', 'hurrah', 'taking', 'tennis', 'pro', 'position', 'snooty', 'English', 'social', 'club', 'up', 'aspiring', 'young', 'tennis', 'star', 'Lizzie', 'Bradbury', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'competing', 'first', 'Wimbledon', 'watchful', 'eye', 'father', 'played', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'sporting', 'horrible', 'American', 'accent', '.Following', 'mix', 'up', 'rooms', 'other', 'comic', 'misadventures', 'two', 'gradually', 'fall', 'love', 'ready', 'admit', 'Colt', 'game', 'further', 'tournament', 'Lizzie', 'game', 'deteriorates.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'bought', 'Bettany', 'Dunst', 'couple', 'two', 'certainly', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Bettany', 'usual', 'charming', 'self', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'minor', 'quibble', 'everything', 'else', 'perfectly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tennis', 'portrayed', 'so', 'dramatically', 'screen', 'movie', 'also', 'number', 'tennis', 'greats', 'front', 'camera', 'including', 'Chris', 'Evert', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'add', 'further', 'sense', 'pf', 'realism', 'proceedings.Adding', 'movie', 'DVD', 'nice', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'three', 'short', 'featurettes', 'focus', 'movie', 'general', 'use', 'Wimbledon', 'location', 'tennis', 'training', 'actors', 'had', 'undertake', 'incredibly', 'Bettany', 'Dunst', 'were', 'tennis', 'players', 'starting', 'work', 'picture', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'nicely', 'relaxed', 'commentary', 'supplied', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'Bettany', 'know', 'are', 'fun', 'ride', 'when', 'Loncraine', 'jokingly', 'Bettany', 'insisted', 'being', 'present', 'so', 'Loncraine', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'credit', 'movie.This', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'weekend', 'though', 'more', 'sensible', 'time', 'day']",N/A

Here was another film with Kirsten Dunst as the star, getting all the attention, while everyone else falls at her feet.  But this movie is really about Paul Bettany and his not so quiet end to his tennis career at the biggest stage pro tennis has- Wimbledon.  Bettany plays Paul, an aging pro who has slipped from the top 15 of the rankings (I was eleventh!) to 119, barely enough to get a wildcard entry into his last tournament.  After a quick defeat, he will go be the tennis pro at a local club.Upon arriving, he is given the key to a gorgeous suite, which he thinks is odd.  When he enters the room, he sees Dunst in the shower and quickly leaves.  But of course, they will meet again, and even have a fling which becomes love.  He seems bolstered by the relationship, but she seems to lose focus on her game.Oh, that's right.  She is a tennis player too.  I forgot to mention this at the beginning, because frankly, I can't figure out what the point of having her be a pro tennis player was.  She has about 2 scenes where she actually is playing, and while I am no tennis expert, I can tell you without doubt that she has zero game.  However, she is not only a pro, she is an American phenom who is appearing in her first Wimbledon.  But the movie smartly avoids seeing her on the court much, because she is terrible at tennis.  Paul Bettany is better, and looks more like he can play, which is why he gets the lion's share of time on the courts.Is the ending predictable?  Of course.  It goes without saying that the ending will be happy on both fronts.  It is cute, and watchable, and in the end, it has some charm.  I do want to mention, however, that I don't really like the direction PG-13 movies are heading these days.  This one has that rating, yet it features the following:  A full body silhouette of Dunst in the shower, well lit, several shots of Bettany's behind, naked, and an affair which starts about 10 minutes after the main characters have introduced themselves to each other.  They are seen in bed, obviously naked, more than once, and I just can't see the point in showing that to a 13 year old.  The movie was just as good without any of that, so why is it there?

864466,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B0006A9FIM,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[17, 22]","Director Richard Loncraine delivers a sweet romantic comedy about two pro tennis players who fall for each other on the grass courts of Wimbledon.  When Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is accidentally given the wrong room key, he meets brash, ambitious Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), one of the top women players on the tour.  Lizzie is the darling of tennis fans and the press while Peter is on the way out, about to retire and start a life as a pro at a local club.  The two decide to have a fling, no strings attached, but (of course) they find themselves caring a lot more than they expected.  The problem is that Peter distracts Lizzie from her game even though she increases his focus, and Lizzie's controlling father (Sam Neill) is furious.  After all, Lizzie is a star, and Peter is not.Tennis players will cringe watching the technique of Kirsten Dunst because there is NO way that motion is going to deliver the killer serve she supposedly has.  The same is true of her ground strokes.  Bettany is slightly more believable.  Still, if you can get past the amateur tennis technique, this is a sweet, if predictable, movie about the unpredictability of love and sports.  The computer graphics make the games exciting, both visually and by triggering the rush of the game.

It is just about exactly what you'll expect it to be, going in, if you expect a harmless romance-comedy with a light sports theme to give it form.Kirsten Dunst, while always cute, is slightly weak in her role, but that is more than made up for by Bettany, who will one day catch the right part, in the right movie, and become a household name. He shines wherever he goes.The tennis action is servicable (intended) and the romance is more or less believable--their chemistry works. We honestly do root for their relationship in the end, even though Dunst's character is a little questionable. The supporting parts run are all pretty fun, but sometimes a little over-the-top (for example, the sports agent). The editing/camera tricks, with its slow motion, freeze frames, hyper-color and voice-over narration don't really add anything and, at times, distract. Certain aspects, like Bettany's relationship to a ball boy, are a little syrupy and unnecessary.Overall, this movie will not set your world on fire, and it has some flaws, but they don't prevent the film from being a cute and worthwhile romance.

864470,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006A9FIM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","Paul Bettany has been carving out a rather impressive career as a supporting player in recent movies.  He was the scene stealing Geoffrey Chaucer in ""A Knight's Tale,"" part of a strong ensemble cast in ""Dogville,"" and has twice played a strong second fiddle to Russell Crowe in first ""A Dangerous Mind"" and then ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.""  Clearly, he is not going to be a leading man, which is one of the reasons it is nice to see him essay such a part in a movie like ""Wimbledon.""  The actor will not receive many such opportunities, but this story provides him with the perfect opportunity.Bettany is Peter Colt, a British tennis player who has fallen to 119th in the world, having once been 11th, and who has decided that this Wimbledon fortnight is to be his last.  Usually the phrase would be ""win or lose,"" but Peter has never won a tournament let alone a Grand Slam event like Wimbledon, so losing is all he has ever known.  He tries to announce his planned retirement, but the press is distracted and so it seems that the only one who knows this is Peter's last hurrah is Peter himself.  But when he shows up at the hotel for the tournament he ends up being given the key to the room of Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), the rising infant terrible of American tennis.  If seeing her in the shower is not enough to get Peter interested, she manages to run into him again.Neither Peter or Lizzie is sure about what is going on, although she certainly expresses more confidence in the relationship, which makes sense because she has more sense in her tennis game as well.  But Peter finds that he has feelings for Lizzie, and he also becomes aware that he is winning tennis matches he should not be winning.  Of course, her father (Sam O'Neill) thinks Peter is distracting Lizzie from the task at hand, and so besides his matches and her matches there is daddy dearest to deal with as well.  But as Peter's confidence in his tennis game increases, cracks start to appear in Lizzie's, and it is clear that for both of them what is happening off the tennis court is affecting what is happening on the grass of Wimbledon.Those familiar with tennis might think that this particular story is based on the ""Love Bird Double"" pulled off by Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert when they were dating back in the 1970s, or even the romance between Evert and John Lloyd, the British player that she actually ended up marrying, but if anything this story is more in keeping with what Connors did at the U.S. Open in 1991 when he was ranked #174 in the world and made it to the semi-finals.  Of course there is a little bit of all of these things in this story, and all that is really important is that what Colt does is not so far fetched given what we have seen happen on tennis courts in our life time.""Wimbledon"" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but the best parts of this 2004 film from director Richard Loncraine are when Colt is on the court playing tennis.  More specifically, it is when Colt is thinking about playing tennis, as the script by Adam Brooks, Jennifer Flackett, and Mark Levin gives him lots of opportunities to pysch himself up (and sometimes out) as he gets ready for the next point.  It is from listening to these internal monologues that we get a sense of how Colt is on the edge, relying on brains, sheer well, and the good thoughts of people like his favorite ball boy (Jonathan Timmins) to make it through the next key point and then do it all over again.A lot of this movie is predictable, but that is a common complaint about sports films, whether you are talking true stories like ""Seabiscuit"" or making them up as was the case with ""The Natural.""  Bettany's performance makes this one work because we get a sense for how much of a physical and mental effort it is for him to play in this tournament.  Yes, the tennis ball is computer generated, but the drama of sports is always the human element more than what happens with the ball.  That is why the big question in ""Wimbeldon"" is not whether Peter Colt will get the girl, but whether he will win the tournament.",4,Paul Bettany gets his one chance to play a leading man,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,4111,"['Paul', 'Bettany', 'been', 'carving', 'out', 'rather', 'impressive', 'career', 'supporting', 'player', 'recent', 'movies', 'was', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'part', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Dogville', 'twice', 'played', 'strong', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'first', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'then', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'Clearly', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'one', 'reasons', 'nice', 'see', 'essay', 'part', 'movie', 'Wimbledon', 'actor', 'will', 'not', 'receive', 'many', 'such', 'opportunities', 'story', 'perfect', 'opportunity.Bettany', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'British', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'fallen', '119th', 'world', 'having', 'once', 'been', '11th', 'who', 'decided', 'Wimbledon', 'fortnight', 'be', 'last', 'Usually', 'phrase', 'would', 'be', 'win', 'lose', 'Peter', 'never', 'won', 'tournament', 'let', 'alone', 'Grand', 'Slam', 'event', 'Wimbledon', 'losing', 'ever', 'known', 'announce', 'planned', 'retirement', 'press', 'distracted', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Peter', 'last', 'hurrah', 'Peter', 'when', 'up', 'hotel', 'tournament', 'up', 'being', 'given', 'key', 'room', 'Lizzie', 'Bradbury', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'rising', 'infant', 'terrible', 'American', 'tennis', 'seeing', 'shower', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'Peter', 'interested', 'run', 'again.Neither', 'Peter', 'Lizzie', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'certainly', 'more', 'confidence', 'relationship', 'sense', 'more', 'sense', 'tennis', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'Peter', 'feelings', 'Lizzie', 'also', 'aware', 'winning', 'tennis', 'matches', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'winning', 'course', 'father', 'Sam', ""O'Neill"", 'Peter', 'distracting', 'Lizzie', 'task', 'hand', 'so', 'matches', 'matches', 'daddy', 'dearest', 'deal', 'as', 'well', 'Peter', 'confidence', 'tennis', 'game', 'increases', 'cracks', 'start', 'appear', 'Lizzie', 'clear', 'what', 'happening', 'off', 'tennis', 'court', 'affecting', 'what', 'happening', 'grass', 'Wimbledon.Those', 'familiar', 'tennis', 'might', 'think', 'particular', 'story', 'based', 'Love', 'Bird', 'Double', 'pulled', 'off', 'Jimmy', 'Connors', 'Chris', 'Evert', 'when', 'were', 'dating', 'back', '1970s', 'even', 'romance', 'Evert', 'John', 'Lloyd', 'British', 'player', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'anything', 'story', 'more', 'keeping', 'what', 'Connors', 'did', 'U.S.', 'Open', '1991', 'when', 'was', 'ranked', '174', 'world', 'made', 'semi-finals', 'course', 'little', 'bit', 'things', 'story', 'really', 'important', 'what', 'Colt', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'given', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'happen', 'tennis', 'courts', 'life', 'time', 'Wimbledon', 'supposed', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'best', 'parts', '2004', 'film', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'are', 'when', 'Colt', 'court', 'playing', 'tennis', 'More', 'specifically', 'when', 'Colt', 'thinking', 'playing', 'tennis', 'script', 'Adam', 'Brooks', 'Jennifer', 'Flackett', 'Mark', 'Levin', 'lots', 'opportunities', 'pysch', 'up', 'sometimes', 'out', 'ready', 'next', 'point', 'listening', 'internal', 'monologues', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'Colt', 'edge', 'relying', 'brains', 'sheer', 'well', 'good', 'thoughts', 'people', 'favorite', 'ball', 'boy', 'Jonathan', 'Timmins', 'make', 'next', 'key', 'point', 'then', 'do', 'again.A', 'lot', 'movie', 'predictable', 'common', 'complaint', 'sports', 'films', 'are', 'talking', 'true', 'stories', 'Seabiscuit', 'making', 'up', 'was', 'case', 'Natural', 'Bettany', 'performance', 'one', 'work', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'physical', 'mental', 'effort', 'play', 'tournament', 'Yes', 'tennis', 'ball', 'computer', 'generated', 'drama', 'sports', 'always', 'human', 'element', 'more', 'what', 'ball', 'why', 'big', 'question', 'Wimbeldon', 'not', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'will', 'get', 'girl', 'will', 'win', 'tournament']",N/A

However, this film more than any other proves to me that personal taste is completely unpredictable.I should'nt like this film - I play tennis every week and used to play for the county when younger - and neither leads look like they could actually hit a four year old chipanzee off the court, let alone have a ranking. Admittedly, Paul Bettany's character carries off the ball skills a little better (what is Kirsten Dunst's service action supposed to be doing?), but the chances of him winning any match are fairly slim.I'm English - a film that focuses and sort of celebrates our complete inablity at producing a tennis champion seems a little like a kick in the b**ls. That he only succeeds because he finds inspiration from an American lass is like grabbing my nipples whilst kicking me in the ba**s.I live in Wimbledon - just two minutes away from the All England Club, and every year I curse the arrival of thousands of tourists, eagerly clogging up the streets, clutching their ticket to experience what is essentially two people hitting a pressurised rubber ball at each other. The sudden and frequent down pours and extortionate strawberries only seem to increase their enjoyment.I grew up in Brighton (the seaside town where Peter keeps his flat) - how romantic it all looks, all lovely Victorian lamps and run down tennis courts in prime reality. So where di they hide all the brides-to-be that are found running around town every weekend with a kiss-me-quick hat on and an L plate attached to her back? Cos without them, this isn't the Brighton I know.Also, the flat that Peter keeps.....Sussex Square. Where Cate Blanchett lives...house and flats going at 2m plus. His furniture maybe IKEA but he hasn't done too badly from his 'playing' to earn enough for that pad.But the funny thing is. It doesn't matter, any of it. I like this film and I have no idea why.

The romantic comedy is an aside to the real plot of how an aging tennis player who never had a taste for the jugular deals with winning and losing -- on the losing side of a long career.  Paul Bettany plays this scenario well, and his internal dialogue as he hits those critical match points make this movie alone worth watching. As a romantic lead, he's winning, if not overpowering.  He and Kirsten Dunst have a nice chemistry, and make an attractive couple,  though the romance and comedy plots seem secondary to the main theme of winning.  You don't have to know anything about tennis to find this movie worth watching.  Not a strong five star romance, comedy or sports movie, as it tried to be a little of each, and thus can't succeed overwhelmingly on any one of the three.  But it combines them credibly, and should provide something for everyone.  Mostly it is memorable for the wonderful portrayal of athletes in clinch moments and the discussion of how they deal with them. Dunst is somewhat less driven than you'd expect her to be, and her father, portrayed by Sam Neill is the least credible of the trio -- you are expecting a stage/tennis dad, and he is far more easy-going than seems believable.

864473,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B0006A9FIM,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[5, 5]","It's hard to define what makes 'Wimbledon' work so well where the vast majority of other romantic comedies are such utter flops.  The ending is somewhat predictable, the story follows the same basic line, there's the usual healthy interspersing of sex and jokes. But still, there's something special about this movie that makes it simply a joy to watch.Certainly, the chemistry between Paul Bettany (as the seasoned tennis pro) and Kirsten Dunst (as the enfant terrible of the game) goes a long way toward what makes 'Wimbledon' so worth watching. Whenever these two are on the screen together, from their first meeting to the final shot of the film, they seem utterly meant to be together.  They seem to share a genuine warmth and easy attitude together, never a put-on or an act. Rarely have I seen an on-screen couple that seemed so natural and unforced.The humor of the film is also of a higher caliber than most similar movies. Always clever and sharp but never overdone, the laughs in the movie are many, and they are also remarkably genuine.The style of the film, capturing the tempestuous game of tennis both on and off the court, helps a great deal as well.  Most romantic comedies don't go the extra mile of capturing their subject so well, but I came away at the end of 'Wimbledon' energized equally by the sportsmanship I'd seen (an illusion remarkably well pulled off for the movie) as I was by the flowering romance essential to the story.  From dynamic, 'follow-the-ball' camera shots to timed-exposure and uniquely dramatic angles and editing, I found myself enjoying the film for its technical wizardry as much as the story -- and I didn't even realize until it was over and I watched some of the DVD extras just how much of the film was crafted after the fact!'Wimbledon' is the sort of movie that you can get caught up in easily. Truly warm, charming, and funny, it's just the sort of pick-me-up movie that can lighten the darkest of spirits, and make you feel good about love and life.

864474,A1NRCH7YAGZ07B,B0006A9FIM,"Terren3i ""Terren3i""","[3, 3]","this movie is somewhat cheesy but, BUT effective. once again I wish to tell people the greatest performance are not from those actors just seemed trying so hard to spray that so ""wow"" performance of their on screen, but from those who play so involved with their character and so make them fun while you are watching them play. I admit I'm toward to like Dunst's movies but she always allow me to like her be in her role as she pretty much deliver her ""involveness"" on her character most of times ( may be except for spiderman series). You must admit in usual terms american stars and british stars don't look quite bright toghether, its either the american actor try too hard to be british or the other way around. In this one Dunst jsut play herself all the time which WORKS. The movie doesnt really ask you to think of the possibility how those2 actually loves each other but it simply telling you they speak differently and they do like each other and that's just how it works, even Notting Hill that got me doubt about the2 but this one is essential enough. Works on me.matching scene are predictable but the camera works quite well and I didnt raise any complaints. What I dont like is the story is very very apparently benefits the male side, I'm a male I do like to be the hero all the time but I guess I'm decent enough to see that the movie pretty pity on the prize is not just as important for the girl as for the guy. IT is not the question whether which racial side but the problem is Dunst's character doesnt seem like one taht would give it up so easily, the only flaw in the movie, overall is jsut enjoyfull",5,it's got some moments,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1623,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'BUT', 'effective', 'once', 'again', 'wish', 'tell', 'people', 'greatest', 'performance', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'just', 'seemed', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'spray', 'so', 'wow', 'performance', 'screen', 'who', 'play', 'so', 'involved', 'character', 'so', 'make', 'fun', 'are', 'watching', 'play', 'admit', ""'m"", 'like', 'Dunst', 'movies', 'always', 'allow', 'like', 'be', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'involveness', 'character', 'most', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'spiderman', 'series', 'must', 'admit', 'usual', 'terms', 'american', 'stars', 'british', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'quite', 'bright', 'toghether', 'american', 'actor', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'british', 'other', 'way', 'one', 'Dunst', 'jsut', 'play', 'time', 'WORKS', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'really', 'ask', 'think', 'possibility', 'how', 'those2', 'actually', 'other', 'simply', 'telling', 'speak', 'differently', 'do', 'other', 'just', 'how', 'even', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'got', 'doubt', 'the2', 'one', 'essential', 'enough', 'Works', 'me.matching', 'scene', 'are', 'predictable', 'camera', 'quite', 'well', 'didnt', 'raise', 'complaints', 'What', 'dont', 'story', 'very', 'very', 'apparently', 'benefits', 'male', 'side', ""'m"", 'male', 'do', 'be', 'hero', 'time', 'guess', ""'m"", 'decent', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'pretty', 'pity', 'prize', 'not', 'just', 'important', 'girl', 'guy', 'IT', 'not', 'question', 'racial', 'side', 'problem', 'Dunst', 'character', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'one', 'taht', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'easily', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'overall', 'jsut', 'enjoyfull']",N/A
864475,A15XXOVX6ZNNRO,B0006A9FIM,"William D. Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No...","[4, 4]","This is one of the better sports movies to come out in the last ten years.  The plot is very similar to For the Love of the Game, with an aging star making a last stand supported by the love of a woman.  In this case the star is Paul Bettany, who has never quite risen to the top of the tennis world.  He falls in love with Kirsten Dunst, an up and coming American star who is at her first Wimbledon.The plot doesn't really have a lot of twists and turns - if you are looking for a movie with suspense, you will be sorely disappointed when you've figured out where the movie is going based on the first 15 minutes.  That is not necissarily a bad thing - everyone knows Romeo and Juliet will meet a tragic end, but it is still an enjoyable play.The drawbacks to the film mostly revolve around Dunst's acting and her charachter.  The acting is subpar, particularly compared with the classically trained British/Australian contingent around her (including a solid but not spectacular turn by Sam Neill as her father).  She doesn't look particularly comfortable playing tennis, while Bettany looks like he's been playing all his life.  Most disturbing is the fact that Dunst's character's age is never addressed - most females play in their first Wimbledon in their mid to late teens, giving a creepy veneer to Bettany's 31-year-old falling in lust, then in love with her.There are a couple of solid cameos in this film, including a surprisingly witty John McEnroe commenting that he'd 'be burning the stadium down' after a bad call.  The film has several funny parts that help keep the mood light; during the commentary Bettany says that he and Dunst made a choice early on to have some sort of light moment at the end of each one of the romantic scenes, which keeps the film from being too full of itself.  There's a thematic element with a comet that has returned that is horribly overdone and could easily have been edited out, but that is the exception rather than the rule.The DVD has a commentary with the director and Bettany which is mildly amusing but nothing spectacular.  There are four featurettes that all basically boil down to different aspects of making the film.  The technical effects one is particularly interesting since you would never guess that most of the tennis balls that are batted around in the film are actually CGI - this film is actually a case study in not having your effects and special camera shots get in the way of a good story line.The most imporatant thing about this film is that it is a love story set against a backdrop of tennis instead of a tennis movie with a love story.  Even if you don't appreciate the finer aspects of the game the story, unlike in For the Love of the Game, is strong enough to sustain the film without the action on the tennis court.",4,"You have to like love stories, but not tennis, to enjoy it",1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2797,"['one', 'better', 'sports', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'plot', 'very', 'similar', 'Love', 'Game', 'aging', 'star', 'making', 'last', 'stand', 'supported', 'love', 'woman', 'case', 'star', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'risen', 'top', 'tennis', 'world', 'love', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'up', 'coming', 'American', 'star', 'who', 'first', 'Wimbledon.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'lot', 'twists', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'suspense', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'when', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'based', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'not', 'necissarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'everyone', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'will', 'meet', 'tragic', 'end', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'play.The', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'mostly', 'revolve', 'around', 'Dunst', 'acting', 'charachter', 'acting', 'subpar', 'particularly', 'compared', 'classically', 'trained', 'British/Australian', 'contingent', 'including', 'solid', 'not', 'spectacular', 'turn', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'father', ""n't"", 'look', 'particularly', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'tennis', 'Bettany', 'been', 'playing', 'life', 'Most', 'disturbing', 'fact', 'Dunst', 'character', 'age', 'never', 'addressed', 'most', 'females', 'play', 'first', 'Wimbledon', 'mid', 'late', 'teens', 'giving', 'creepy', 'veneer', 'Bettany', '31-year-old', 'falling', 'lust', 'then', 'love', 'her.There', 'are', 'couple', 'solid', 'cameos', 'film', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'witty', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'commenting', ""'d"", ""'be"", 'burning', 'stadium', 'down', 'bad', 'call', 'film', 'several', 'funny', 'parts', 'help', 'keep', 'mood', 'light', 'commentary', 'Bettany', 'Dunst', 'made', 'choice', 'early', 'have', 'sort', 'light', 'moment', 'end', 'one', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'full', 'thematic', 'element', 'comet', 'returned', 'horribly', 'overdone', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'exception', 'rather', 'rule.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'director', 'Bettany', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'are', 'four', 'featurettes', 'basically', 'boil', 'down', 'different', 'aspects', 'making', 'film', 'technical', 'effects', 'one', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'most', 'tennis', 'are', 'batted', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'CGI', 'film', 'actually', 'case', 'study', 'not', 'having', 'effects', 'special', 'camera', 'shots', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'story', 'most', 'imporatant', 'thing', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'backdrop', 'tennis', 'instead', 'tennis', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'finer', 'aspects', 'game', 'story', 'Love', 'Game', 'strong', 'enough', 'sustain', 'film', 'action', 'tennis', 'court']",N/A
