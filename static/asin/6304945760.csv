440702,A12YVS06GZEFZE,6304945760,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[21, 21]","You hear about all these workout videos and how you can have great buns, great abs, great everything, although, by the time you're through working out, you don't have a very great attitude.  Well, David Carradine's Tai Chi video is wonderful.  I'm a pretty large person, and I have a hard time keeping up with fast workout tapes.  David Carradine goes through the Tai Chi movements slowly and professionally, and where I can keep up with him.  After I complete the tape, or whatever portion I finish up with, I feel relaxed and renewed, like a new woman.  I've dropped 20 pounds in a month.  I had lost 70 pounds before that with a diet drink, but then I reached a plateau.  Since I'm so large, my doctor suggested I exercise, but nothing too strenuous.  I have a hard time walking because of the bumpy streets, and I walk with the help of a cane.  But with the use of my cane helping hold me up, and my David Carradine Tai Chi video in the TV VCR, I can exercise in the comfort of my home, and not get all tired out.  It has even gotten where I can do many of the movements without my cane.  Maybe one day I'll be able to throw it away.If you are large, or just have a hard time moving around, I guarantee you that if you use this video, you WILL feel more relaxed and sure of yourself.  You'll feel great because you're able to actually exercise without passing out.Thank you David Carradine for this video.I give this workout tape 5 stars because it has been so helpful to me.",5,Great workout video,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1479,"['hear', 'videos', 'how', 'can', 'have', 'great', 'buns', 'great', 'abs', 'great', 'everything', 'time', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'great', 'attitude', 'Well', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'wonderful', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'large', 'person', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'up', 'fast', 'tapes', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'movements', 'slowly', 'professionally', 'where', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'complete', 'tape', 'portion', 'finish', 'up', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'renewed', 'new', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'dropped', '20', 'pounds', 'month', 'had', 'lost', '70', 'pounds', 'diet', 'drink', 'then', 'reached', 'plateau', ""'m"", 'so', 'large', 'doctor', 'suggested', 'exercise', 'nothing', 'too', 'strenuous', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'walking', 'bumpy', 'streets', 'walk', 'help', 'cane', 'use', 'cane', 'helping', 'hold', 'up', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'TV', 'VCR', 'can', 'exercise', 'comfort', 'home', 'not', 'get', 'tired', 'out', 'even', 'gotten', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'many', 'movements', 'cane', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'throw', 'are', 'large', 'just', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'moving', 'around', 'guarantee', 'use', 'video', 'WILL', 'feel', 'more', 'relaxed', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'great', ""'re"", 'able', 'actually', 'exercise', 'passing', 'out.Thank', 'David', 'Carradine', 'video.I', 'give', 'workout', 'tape', '5', 'stars', 'been', 'so', 'helpful']",N/A

440704,AXTS0PEDIRUIX,6304945760,"""shofar""","[17, 17]","This was the first Tai Chi video that I tried out.  Basically I bought it because I liked David Carradine as an actor and thought I would enjoy his  instruction style.  It is a beautifully produced video with soft music and  nature scenes to get you into the mood.  David's teaching style is very  appealing and soothing.  As a beginner, I appreciated the fact that there  are only nine moves to learn and that they are repeated on both sides of  your body for even development.While I really enjoyed the teaching and  music, I did find it somewhat difficult to learn some of the moves because  you are watching for the most part from the front and have to reverse the  moves to be going the same direction as the instructor and students.  Another thing is that David is teaching the Chen style, which I found  difficult to find on another video for further study (that was before I  found amazon.com.)  I tried a few more Tai Chi videos and found the one  that was the easiest to follow was the Tai Chi for Health with Terrence  Dunn.  He has a video on both the long and short form of Yang style Tai  Chi.  His instruction is excellent and slow, you view him from two angles  simultaneously, and you get 108 positions in the long form which should  keep you busy and you will not have to spend more money on a Tai Chi video  for quite some time.",4,appealing and soothing instruction,966729600,"08 20, 2000",2000,1347,"['was', 'first', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'tried', 'out', 'Basically', 'bought', 'liked', 'David', 'Carradine', 'actor', 'thought', 'would', 'enjoy', 'instruction', 'style', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'video', 'soft', 'music', 'nature', 'scenes', 'get', 'mood', 'David', 'teaching', 'style', 'very', 'appealing', 'soothing', 'beginner', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'are', 'only', 'nine', 'moves', 'learn', 'are', 'repeated', 'sides', 'body', 'even', 'development.While', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'teaching', 'music', 'did', 'find', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'learn', 'moves', 'are', 'watching', 'most', 'part', 'front', 'have', 'reverse', 'moves', 'be', 'going', 'same', 'direction', 'instructor', 'students', 'thing', 'David', 'teaching', 'Chen', 'style', 'found', 'difficult', 'find', 'video', 'further', 'study', 'was', 'found', 'amazon.com', 'tried', 'few', 'more', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'videos', 'found', 'one', 'was', 'easiest', 'follow', 'was', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Health', 'Terrence', 'Dunn', 'video', 'long', 'short', 'form', 'Yang', 'style', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'instruction', 'excellent', 'slow', 'view', 'two', 'angles', 'simultaneously', 'get', '108', 'positions', 'long', 'form', 'should', 'keep', 'busy', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'quite', 'time']",N/A

I also took Tai Chi, the Yang short form for over a year while in my massage school. I was looking for a refresher, to learn more about the benefits & philosophy of the moves and/or other forms.This is one of the better Tai Chi style videos I have tried. Some bored the ... out of me. I tried a 1987 one of David's that was horrid with everyone having no experience & horrible form including David.Daivd does a much better job at narrating, telling you what the move is called, what to visualize, better on describing how to move, and the benefits for the body. The blue background to play videos was a nice artistic touch though it can be very distracting when trying to following along people's forms especially when the camera angle has them lined up almost right behind the other one.They start with David leading the Asian-style slow, gentle stretching warm-up movements.The camera kept cutting from person to person so that you couldn't focus well to really see which way to move your hands. They always showed David & the STUDENTS first & then Arnold Tayam LAST which is absurd. You'd want to learn from the most experienced, not the people who have sloppy form. The Lotus Kick was laughable. Instead of trying to kick the knee as high as you can to the extended arm at shoulder height to increase balance & muscle control, David & the other students all looked like they were in a Country music concert strumming/slapping their knee. The director also didn't show Arnold Tayam long enough & though it's good to see him from the back, they didn't show him from the front enough in the learning section.Also I hate is that they show you the move doing it towards the left, then the right, then left, etc. many times. Why can't they show the left 3-5x in a row so that you can understand the nauances of exactly how to have your hand facing, etc. before doing it to the opposite side? Most fitness & etc. do that which annoys me.I'm happy to report after they show each move several times, they put together all the movements together IN HALF TIME with the camera more focusing on Arnold.After that they then show Arnold doing it regular speed from the back. They show him again in normal speed from the LEFT which was a VERY good idea. Left is easier to copy then facing front. I applaud that camera angle idea.I should give this dvd less stars... I only did it the 1x because it was a rental from the library & I don't remember is this was a real form of real Tai Chi or BS. Considering his other videos, I say buyer beware.",4,Much better form then from his Tai Chi attempt in 1987.,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,2642,"['start', 'have', 'taken', 'martial', 'art', 'classes', 'not', 'many', 'few', 'months', 'time', 'several', 'times', 'life', 'also', 'took', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Yang', 'short', 'form', 'year', 'massage', 'school', 'was', 'looking', 'refresher', 'learn', 'more', 'benefits', 'philosophy', 'moves', 'and/or', 'other', 'forms.This', 'one', 'better', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'style', 'videos', 'have', 'tried', 'bored', 'tried', '1987', 'one', 'David', 'was', 'horrid', 'everyone', 'having', 'experience', 'horrible', 'form', 'including', 'David.Daivd', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'narrating', 'telling', 'what', 'move', 'called', 'what', 'visualize', 'better', 'describing', 'how', 'move', 'benefits', 'body', 'blue', 'background', 'play', 'videos', 'was', 'nice', 'artistic', 'touch', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'distracting', 'when', 'trying', 'following', 'along', 'people', 'forms', 'especially', 'when', 'camera', 'angle', 'lined', 'up', 'almost', 'right', 'other', 'one.They', 'start', 'David', 'leading', 'Asian-style', 'slow', 'gentle', 'stretching', 'warm-up', 'movements.The', 'camera', 'kept', 'cutting', 'person', 'person', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'focus', 'well', 'really', 'see', 'way', 'move', 'hands', 'always', 'showed', 'David', 'STUDENTS', 'first', 'then', 'Arnold', 'Tayam', 'LAST', 'absurd', ""'d"", 'want', 'learn', 'most', 'experienced', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'sloppy', 'form', 'Lotus', 'Kick', 'was', 'laughable', 'Instead', 'trying', 'kick', 'knee', 'as', 'high', 'can', 'extended', 'arm', 'shoulder', 'height', 'increase', 'balance', 'muscle', 'control', 'David', 'other', 'students', 'looked', 'were', 'Country', 'music', 'concert', 'strumming/slapping', 'knee', 'director', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Arnold', 'Tayam', 'long', 'enough', 'good', 'see', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'front', 'enough', 'learning', 'section.Also', 'hate', 'show', 'move', 'doing', 'left', 'then', 'right', 'then', 'left', 'etc', 'many', 'times', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'left', '3-5x', 'row', 'can', 'understand', 'nauances', 'exactly', 'how', 'have', 'hand', 'facing', 'etc', 'doing', 'opposite', 'side', 'Most', 'fitness', 'etc', 'do', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'show', 'move', 'several', 'times', 'put', 'together', 'movements', 'together', 'IN', 'HALF', 'TIME', 'camera', 'more', 'focusing', 'Arnold.After', 'then', 'show', 'Arnold', 'doing', 'regular', 'speed', 'back', 'show', 'again', 'normal', 'speed', 'LEFT', 'was', 'VERY', 'good', 'idea', 'Left', 'easier', 'copy', 'then', 'facing', 'front', 'applaud', 'camera', 'angle', 'idea.I', 'should', 'give', 'dvd', 'less', 'stars', 'only', 'did', '1x', 'was', 'rental', 'library', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'real', 'form', 'real', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'BS', 'Considering', 'other', 'videos', 'say', 'buyer', 'beware']",N/A
