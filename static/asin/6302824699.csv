He goes unjustly through the court and prison systems. His attitude is taken into account more than his actions. The radical mood of the movie is typical of its time. Barbara Hershey plays a supporting role as his pretty girlfriend. Ruth White gives a somewhat funny performance as his bigoted grandmother. 2.5 out of 3.,3,ok early 70's picture,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,425,"['Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'fine', 'performance', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'accidently', 'pedestrian', 'car', 'unjustly', 'court', 'prison', 'systems', 'attitude', 'taken', 'account', 'more', 'actions', 'radical', 'mood', 'movie', 'typical', 'time', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'supporting', 'role', 'pretty', 'girlfriend', 'Ruth', 'White', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'performance', 'bigoted', 'grandmother', '2.5', '3']",N/A

It played for a week in L.A., then disappeared for several years until it showed up on commercial television.  A lot of good people in it.

339874,A3D4EF8TDKS0BS,6302824699,"Stephen Courts ""StephenJames""","[0, 0]","Having seen this movie shortly after it was released, I was in the Army serving in South Korea at the time. As I was very young at that time, and away from home for the first time, the influences of my older college educated and drafted friends I was serving with had significance as I became better read and independent from my family. Something besides the beautiful Barbara Hersey in this movie moved me. Being somewhat idealistic, the movie plot engaged me more than any other I viewed (and we had movies every night), This movie was one of the turning points in my political thinking. As I became more open minded and progressive in early adulthood, the conundrum William Popper faced made me have to think about the law, justice, the establishment and the consequences of doing the right thing. I had never forgotten this movie and VHS taped it a number of years ago. I watched it a couple nights ago and could still find the same emotions I had as a 19 year old. The VHS tape was adequate but I am going to buy the DVD because I still love the movie and will watch it again. Perhaps it is nostalgia, but I found the scenery and the music as well as the acting to be excellent.Stephen CourtsMay 2, 2014",5,Terrific Acting & A Very Good Story,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1208,"['Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'shortly', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'Army', 'serving', 'South', 'Korea', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'time', 'away', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'influences', 'older', 'college', 'educated', 'drafted', 'friends', 'was', 'serving', 'had', 'significance', 'became', 'better', 'read', 'independent', 'family', 'Something', 'beautiful', 'Barbara', 'Hersey', 'movie', 'moved', 'Being', 'somewhat', 'idealistic', 'movie', 'plot', 'engaged', 'more', 'other', 'viewed', 'had', 'movies', 'night', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'turning', 'points', 'political', 'thinking', 'became', 'more', 'open', 'minded', 'progressive', 'early', 'adulthood', 'conundrum', 'William', 'Popper', 'faced', 'made', 'have', 'think', 'law', 'justice', 'establishment', 'consequences', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'had', 'never', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'VHS', 'taped', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'couple', 'nights', 'ago', 'could', 'still', 'find', 'same', 'emotions', 'had', '19', 'year', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'was', 'adequate', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'DVD', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'nostalgia', 'found', 'scenery', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'be', 'excellent.Stephen', 'CourtsMay', '2', '2014']",N/A

A bit dated but certainly the story is still relevant - a young guy (the ""rebel"") stands up for what he believes and gives up a privileged life as the price for his beliefs.

339876,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6302824699,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","Ignore the somewhat mocking suggestion of camp by the ""Martini Movies"" logo -- this is a fine movie about the American state of mind circa 1971, especially for a young man no longer sure of anything, other than his disdain for & despair over the phoniness of society. As portrayed by Michael Sarrazin in an understated but subtly intense performance, Billy Popper, unwilling scion of old money, has reached the point where even protest no longer seems worthwhile. The sheer absurdity of a life built on lies & empty appearances has worn down his soul.And then his life is altered forever, as he accidentally runs down an old woman in a driving rainstorm one night. Suddenly his entire future is on the line -- but he seems to be the only one who doesn't much care, seeing this as one more accident in a universe that's apparently an accident. He's something of a more naive American cousin to Camus' Meursault, in a way.I'll say nothing more about the story, except that it constantly goes in directions I didn't expect, wonderfully subverting the tired cliches of the standard Hollywood plot. Ably supported by a lovely Barbara Hershey as his girlfriend & Robert Klein as a slightly loose cannon of a best friend, struggling to negotiate the labyrinth of family & the law as represented by Arthur Hill, E. G. Marshall, Sada Thompson & Ruth White's acerbic firecracker of an obsecenely rich grandmother, Billy finally arrives at the only answer for him. It's one a lot of us will identify with, especially if we've had enough & too much of contemporary society ourselves.It never made much of a splash, and it's been pretty much forgotten over the decades -- but here's a film that's honest about life in 1971, while managing to speak quite eloquently to the present as well -- recommended!",4,"Quiet, perceptive little film that sadly got away - 4 & 1/2 stars",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,1790,"['somewhat', 'mocking', 'suggestion', 'camp', 'Martini', 'Movies', 'logo', 'fine', 'movie', 'American', 'state', 'mind', 'circa', '1971', 'especially', 'young', 'man', 'no', 'longer', 'sure', 'anything', 'other', 'disdain', 'despair', 'phoniness', 'society', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'understated', 'subtly', 'intense', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Popper', 'unwilling', 'scion', 'old', 'money', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'protest', 'no', 'longer', 'worthwhile', 'sheer', 'absurdity', 'life', 'built', 'lies', 'empty', 'appearances', 'worn', 'down', 'soul.And', 'then', 'life', 'altered', 'forever', 'accidentally', 'down', 'old', 'woman', 'driving', 'rainstorm', 'one', 'night', 'Suddenly', 'entire', 'future', 'line', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'seeing', 'one', 'more', 'accident', 'universe', 'apparently', 'accident', 'something', 'more', 'naive', 'American', 'cousin', 'Camus', 'Meursault', 'way.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'story', 'constantly', 'directions', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'wonderfully', 'subverting', 'tired', 'cliches', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'Ably', 'supported', 'lovely', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'girlfriend', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'slightly', 'loose', 'cannon', 'best', 'friend', 'struggling', 'negotiate', 'labyrinth', 'family', 'law', 'represented', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'E.', 'G.', 'Marshall', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'Ruth', 'White', 'acerbic', 'firecracker', 'obsecenely', 'rich', 'grandmother', 'Billy', 'finally', 'only', 'answer', 'one', 'lot', 'will', 'identify', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'too', 'much', 'contemporary', 'society', 'ourselves.It', 'never', 'made', 'much', 'splash', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'decades', 'here', 'film', 'honest', 'life', '1971', 'managing', 'speak', 'quite', 'eloquently', 'present', 'as', 'well', 'recommended']",N/A
