Infact, I have a whole new appreciation for it. Some time ago I ran across it quite by accident on the Disney Channel...it was then that I realized that it was now my mission to return to watch it from the beginning the next showing and tape it. And tape it I did! I can't begin to tell you how many memories it brought back! And the songs were just inspiring! The song &quot;Flying With The Eagles&quot; has renewed my lust for travel.And every other song on this movie is an animated treasure.

49811,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783222726,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I remember watching this cartoon as a kid and absolutely loving every minute of it.  I was a huge fan of `The Chipmunks' and watched their cartoon's religiously, so it's only expected that with the birth of my first child right around the corner I would seek out and purchase some cartoons that I myself adore.  `The Chipmunk Adventure' I can honestly say still stacks up even in its old age.  It's funny and entertaining and enjoyable even in my adulthood.  The animation may not be as flashy and realistic as we have today but there's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned cartoon every once in a while.  The storyline is engaging, the characters are likable and the entire feel of this cartoon, the vibe and atmosphere is sure to excite and entertain any child.  There are a few things I found a little annoying but there's not enough here to really complain about.First let's discuss the storyline.  Dave, the Chipmunks father figure, is traveling to Europe on business and is leaving the boys in the hands of absent minded babysitter Miss Miller.  Alvin is none to happy with this arrangement for he wants to travel with Dave and see the wonders of the world.  He soon gets his opportunity when two shady strangers overhear a conversation, or a fight, between Alvin and Brittany (leader of the Chipettes) in regards to who could really win a race around the world.  It just so happens that these two strangers, Klaus and Claudia, are in need of some transporters to smuggle their stolen diamonds.  They devise a plan rather rapidly to send the Chipmunks and the Chipettes on a race around the world, having them deposit dolls stuffed with diamonds at certain checkpoints along the way.  Of course this group of young rodents doesn't realize the dolls are carrying precious cargo and just feel that these two creepy adults are rich and bored, and besides, the winner will receive $100,000 and that's about all the persuading Alvin and Brittany need.  So, Alvin, Simon and Theodore set off in one direction while Brittany, Jeannette and Eleanor set off in the other and each of them meet danger in varying ways.The film is filled to the brim with action and adventure and musical numbers.  The musical numbers, as hilarious as they are, present my first lukewarm feeling.  First of all, maybe it's just me, but was it easier to understand what they were singing when we were younger.  I had the hardest time figuring out the words to the songs.  Maybe children can hear at a higher octave than adults can.  Secondly, some of the songs are not songs I'd want my children to sing, some of them are somewhat suggestive (""get lucky with you"") and just not for children.  I know this was the 80's and these songs were popular, but as a soon-to-be parent I find myself a little more judgmental of things.  Like I said though, this is not enough for me to really complain about.I also would have liked to see the boys really understand the danger in what they did, leaving home unchaperoned, trusting strangers...things of that nature.  Other than Theodore mentioning the guilty feeling once and Simon somewhat bickering in the beginning the boys never really acknowledge how wrong their actions were, nether does Dave for that matter.  I know this is a cartoon, but cartoons are notorious for morals and lessons learnt and I feel that this one could have established those a little better.  Regardless, this is still a fun time and not something I would hesitate to place before my daughter.  It remains a highlight of my youth and I'm hoping it becomes a highlight of hers.",4,Favorite from my youth reestablishes itself as a favorite of my adulthood...,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,3573,"['remember', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'kid', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'minute', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Chipmunks', 'watched', 'cartoon', 'religiously', 'only', 'expected', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'right', 'corner', 'would', 'seek', 'out', 'purchase', 'cartoons', 'adore', 'Chipmunk', 'Adventure', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'still', 'up', 'even', 'old', 'age', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'adulthood', 'animation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'flashy', 'realistic', 'have', 'today', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cartoon', 'once', 'while', 'storyline', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'entire', 'feel', 'cartoon', 'vibe', 'atmosphere', 'sure', 'excite', 'entertain', 'child', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'found', 'little', 'annoying', 'not', 'enough', 'here', 'really', 'complain', 'about.First', 'let', 'discuss', 'storyline', 'Dave', 'Chipmunks', 'father', 'figure', 'traveling', 'Europe', 'business', 'leaving', 'boys', 'hands', 'absent', 'minded', 'babysitter', 'Miss', 'Miller', 'Alvin', 'none', 'happy', 'arrangement', 'travel', 'Dave', 'see', 'wonders', 'world', 'soon', 'opportunity', 'when', 'two', 'shady', 'strangers', 'overhear', 'conversation', 'fight', 'Alvin', 'Brittany', 'leader', 'Chipettes', 'regards', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'win', 'race', 'world', 'just', 'so', 'two', 'strangers', 'Klaus', 'Claudia', 'are', 'need', 'transporters', 'smuggle', 'stolen', 'diamonds', 'devise', 'plan', 'rather', 'rapidly', 'send', 'Chipmunks', 'Chipettes', 'race', 'world', 'having', 'deposit', 'stuffed', 'diamonds', 'certain', 'checkpoints', 'way', 'course', 'group', 'young', 'rodents', ""n't"", 'realize', 'dolls', 'are', 'carrying', 'precious', 'cargo', 'just', 'feel', 'two', 'creepy', 'adults', 'are', 'rich', 'bored', 'besides', 'winner', 'will', 'receive', '100,000', 'persuading', 'Alvin', 'Brittany', 'need', 'So', 'Alvin', 'Simon', 'Theodore', 'set', 'off', 'one', 'direction', 'Brittany', 'Jeannette', 'Eleanor', 'set', 'off', 'other', 'meet', 'danger', 'varying', 'ways.The', 'film', 'filled', 'brim', 'action', 'adventure', 'musical', 'numbers', 'musical', 'numbers', 'as', 'hilarious', 'are', 'present', 'first', 'lukewarm', 'feeling', 'First', 'just', 'was', 'easier', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'singing', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'had', 'hardest', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'words', 'songs', 'Maybe', 'children', 'can', 'hear', 'higher', 'octave', 'adults', 'can', 'Secondly', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'songs', ""'d"", 'want', 'children', 'sing', 'are', 'somewhat', 'suggestive', 'get', 'lucky', 'just', 'not', 'children', 'know', 'was', '80', 'songs', 'were', 'popular', 'soon-to-be', 'parent', 'find', 'little', 'more', 'judgmental', 'things', 'said', 'though', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'complain', 'about.I', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'boys', 'really', 'understand', 'danger', 'what', 'did', 'leaving', 'home', 'unchaperoned', 'trusting', 'strangers', 'things', 'nature', 'Other', 'mentioning', 'guilty', 'feeling', 'once', 'Simon', 'somewhat', 'bickering', 'beginning', 'boys', 'never', 'really', 'acknowledge', 'how', 'wrong', 'actions', 'were', 'nether', 'Dave', 'matter', 'know', 'cartoon', 'cartoons', 'are', 'notorious', 'morals', 'lessons', 'learnt', 'feel', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'established', 'little', 'better', 'Regardless', 'still', 'fun', 'time', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'hesitate', 'place', 'daughter', 'highlight', 'youth', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'highlight', 'hers']",The Chipmunk Adventure VHS

Boomers (and maybe even a few of their parents)will more than likely remember Alvin and his brothers from the 1958 novelty Christmas hit; Gen-Xers, from the show that ran in the 1980s, and for the new generation, this is a great time to introduce the kids to a classic.  (WARNING--POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Originally released in 1987, the story begins when David Seville, the chipmunks' guardian, goes off to Europe ona business trip, leaving the boys at home with a neighbor as a babysitter.  Ever the schemer, Alvin dreams of world travel on his own, and seems more upset at being left at home than he is oer the departure of his ""parent"".  Enter two sinister, ""Euro-trash"" international smugglers.  A borther and sister pair, they need someone who can deliver 5 million dollars worth of diamonds to their customers overseas without arousing the suspicion of the authorities.  the pair finds in the chipmunks and their girlfriends the perfect couriers, and arranges the diamonds to  be delivered under the guise of a hot-air balloon race around the world with a one-million dollar prize at stake.  The boys and their girlfriends enter the race, not realizing what they were getting themselves into.  Meanwhile, the interpol authorities are tracking the boys, both with the intent of getting the kids home safely and catching the smugglers in the process.while the movie is largely tame by today's standards, parents should be aware that there are a few racial stereotypes depicted, for example, at a Mexican fiesta, almost all the people are wearing sombreros; in Egypt, the Arabs are decpicted as riding on camels.  While harmless in the 80's, these images have deeper implications for today.  Parents might wish to use these images to prompt discussion regarding international relations and stereotypes.  Parents should also be aware that the female villain, Claudia furstein, smokes regularly and in one scene, sips a martini.But these detractors are mionor--for many young children in the 80's, this movie was their first exposure to famous world monuments, such as the canals of Venice, Machu Picchu and the pyramids.

So far only one video has been released from the show on VHS through Buena Vista (Disney), along with releases from the later and better-known Alvin and the Chipmunks (with the Chipettes). As most viewers know, there have been a few Alvin specials, mostly with monster/ Halloween type themes. But we've all been awaiting the arrival of this little-seen film which had a limited box office run.Numerous live action and cartoon take-offs have been spun from Jules Verne's tale ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" some of which are quite lackluster and tedious. One of the better recent versions starred Sylvester and Tweety in a prelude to their comeback in Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, which I hope also makes it to DVD. The Great Chimpmunk Adventure, as it is alternately called, takes off from Verne's tale but doesn't stick slavishly to the story, launching instead into a wild flight of fancy.From the original ""Chipmunk Song"" which spun the chattering trio into the limelight, the Bagdasarians have kept the highest standards for Alvin, Simon and Theodore (and Dave) in radio, TV and film.

It is as gorgeous to look at as it is fun to watch! Oh, and I have to mention one of the two criminals, the brother Klaus, who is simply hilarious! And who could forget the comic bantor over the phone between Miss Miller and Dave! Some of it was right out of Abbot and Costello! This is one of those films that reminds you that the 80's wasn't a total loss, at least not when it comes to animation. But where's our merchandise? I want a Brittany doll like in the movie! I know some merchandise was put out, more based on the show, but it was hard to aquire then, and it's almost impossible today, even with the internet! Anyway, show! In this film we see the two aspiring musical acts in a hot air baloon race around the world, unwittingly playing the roles of diamond smugglers for a pair of unscrupulous criminal siblings. The Chipmunks are at their best in this completely entertaining film, but the Chipettes are better than ever! With the bigger budget animation we see art and movement that is a vast improvement over the TV version. What can I say, in this movie, the girls are adorable!!! I mean, a thousand times moreso than on TV, especially the lovely Brittany! This is one of those handful of movies that proves that non-Disney, non-Anime animation can still be GREAT!!!! The movie has very effective comedy, Excellent songs, and is surprisingly well animated. Not as perfect as from Disney, but the musical numbers are given special effort and come off spectacular! There are a few sightings of choppy animation in the film, but very few. For the most part this a great movie!
