As English courtroom dramas go, it is not as satisfying as &#34;Witness for the Prosecution,&#34; made just a couple of years earlier. I'd characterize Dirk Bogarde's performance as good and in some moments, very good, but not as impressive as his performance in &#34;Victim&#34; made a couple of years later. I greatly enjoyed Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the barristers. &#34;Libel&#34; is certainly worth watching and I'm a fan of the director, Anthony Asquith, but it's not a great film.",3,"Good, But Not Great",1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,565,"['entertaining', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'English', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'go', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', '34', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', '34', 'made', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', ""'d"", 'characterize', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'performance', 'good', 'moments', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'performance', '34', 'Victim', '34', 'made', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Wilfrid', 'Hyde-White', 'barristers', '34', 'Libel', '34', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'fan', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Asquith', 'not', 'great', 'film']",Libel

1414178,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B004LUKI9I,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","""Libel,"" (1950), is an interesting British film, a mystery/courtroom drama, and a midcareer turning point for its star, Sir Dirk Bogarde, in which he turned away from playing his matinee idol looks to more ambiguous, ambitious, possibly gay-themed fare.  LIBEL was directed by the very well-born Anthony Asquith, (PYGMALIAN, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST, THE BROWNING VERSION), written by the equally well-born Anatole de Grunwald (PIMPERNEL SMITH, THE WINSLOW BOY).  And, before the handsome, significantly well-born actor's career was done, he  would makeThe Servantand ACCIDENT with Joseph Losey;Death in Veniceand THE DAMNED, with Luchino Visconti;The Night Porter (The Criterion Collection), with Liliana Cavani; and  VICTIM, with Basil Dearden, a picture which dealt with openly gay subject matter when homosexuality was still illegal in Great Britain.In LIBEL, Bogarde plays Sir Mark Lodden, baronet, a soldier returned from World War II with undiagnosed post-stress disorder, then called simply shell shock. Jeffrey Buckenham (Paul Massie) a Canadian commercial pilot happens to see a telecast in London of a Richard Dimbleby (played by himself) interview with Sir Mark at his stately home. The Canadian is convinced that the baronet is a fraud, that he is actually a look-alike actor named Frank Welney, with whom he and the baronet roomed at a German prisoner of war camp.  The trio had escaped together; but one of them never came back. Was the missing man Sir Mark or Welney? The tabloids do their thing with the Canadian's accusations.  Lady Margaret (Maggie) Loddon, played by the equally well-born Olivia de Havilland, urges her husband to sue for libel and engage the distinguished barrister Sir Wilfred, played by Robert Morley, with Hubert Foxley,  played by Wilfred Hyde-White, as opposing, but collegial counsel.  The film devolves into a courtroom drama, with  Richard Wattis as the judge. The case is long drawn-out, made complex by the fact that Sir Mark himself is not quite sure of his identity: he was injured in the war, stutters on occasion and has difficulty remembering. Testimony and evidence go back and forth; it begins to appear that the current Sir Mark is an impostor and the possible murderer of the missing baronet. Even the lord's wife is convinced of his guilt and turns against him.De Havilland was rather well-born herself: she was best-known, of course, forGone with the Wind, also her Oscar-winning performance inThe Snake Pit.  Paul Massie, a Canadian, was best known for his performance in the title role of THE TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL.  Morley was best known forThe African Queen,Beat the Devil, and AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. Hyde-White was best known forMy Fair Lady,The Third Man, THE BROWNING VERSION and LETS MAKE LOVE, with Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand.The film is well-acted, but given the greatest energy by the dueling byplay of its comic veterans, Morley, Hyde-White, and Wattis.  It was based on an original 1935 theater production, ""Libel"" that was directed by Otto Preminger years before he made his debut as a Hollywood film director.  The play was based on the actual medieval French story upon which Gerard Depardieu's THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE was based: Jodie Foster'sSommersbywas an American remake.  The picture does leave lingering doubts in the viewer's mind.  Whatever happened to the men's' dog tags--didn't British troops have them in World War II?  There's some odd business about a leather jacket.  And, bottom line, didn't somebody commit grievous bodily harm upon somebody, possibly killing them?  The scriptwriters, the director, and Bogarde have done a good job of maintaining ambiguity, and I for one watched the closing credits not  completely convinced that the man calling himself Sir Mark was actually Sir Mark.",3,"The Beginning of His More Ambitious, Ambiguous Work",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3803,"['Libel', '1950', 'interesting', 'British', 'film', 'mystery/courtroom', 'drama', 'midcareer', 'turning', 'point', 'star', 'Sir', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'turned', 'away', 'playing', 'matinee', 'idol', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'ambitious', 'possibly', 'gay-themed', 'fare', 'LIBEL', 'was', 'directed', 'very', 'well-born', 'Anthony', 'Asquith', 'PYGMALIAN', 'THE', 'IMPORTANCE', 'OF', 'BEING', 'ERNEST', 'THE', 'BROWNING', 'VERSION', 'written', 'equally', 'well-born', 'Anatole', 'de', 'Grunwald', 'PIMPERNEL', 'SMITH', 'THE', 'WINSLOW', 'BOY', 'handsome', 'significantly', 'well-born', 'actor', 'career', 'was', 'done', 'would', 'makeThe', 'Servantand', 'ACCIDENT', 'Joseph', 'Losey', 'Death', 'Veniceand', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'Luchino', 'Visconti', 'Night', 'Porter', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Liliana', 'Cavani', 'VICTIM', 'Basil', 'Dearden', 'picture', 'openly', 'gay', 'subject', 'matter', 'when', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'still', 'illegal', 'Great', 'Britain.In', 'LIBEL', 'Bogarde', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'Lodden', 'baronet', 'soldier', 'returned', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'undiagnosed', 'post-stress', 'disorder', 'then', 'called', 'simply', 'shell', 'shock', 'Jeffrey', 'Buckenham', 'Paul', 'Massie', 'Canadian', 'commercial', 'pilot', 'happens', 'see', 'telecast', 'London', 'Richard', 'Dimbleby', 'played', 'interview', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'stately', 'home', 'Canadian', 'convinced', 'baronet', 'fraud', 'actually', 'look-alike', 'actor', 'named', 'Frank', 'Welney', 'whom', 'baronet', 'roomed', 'German', 'prisoner', 'war', 'camp', 'trio', 'had', 'escaped', 'together', 'one', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'Was', 'missing', 'man', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'Welney', 'tabloids', 'do', 'thing', 'Canadian', 'accusations', 'Lady', 'Margaret', 'Maggie', 'Loddon', 'played', 'equally', 'well-born', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'husband', 'sue', 'libel', 'engage', 'distinguished', 'barrister', 'Sir', 'Wilfred', 'played', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Hubert', 'Foxley', 'played', 'Wilfred', 'Hyde-White', 'opposing', 'collegial', 'counsel', 'film', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Richard', 'Wattis', 'judge', 'case', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'made', 'complex', 'fact', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'identity', 'was', 'injured', 'war', 'stutters', 'occasion', 'difficulty', 'remembering', 'Testimony', 'evidence', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'appear', 'current', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'impostor', 'possible', 'murderer', 'missing', 'baronet', 'Even', 'lord', 'wife', 'convinced', 'guilt', 'him.De', 'Havilland', 'was', 'rather', 'well-born', 'herself', 'was', 'best-known', 'course', 'forGone', 'Wind', 'also', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'inThe', 'Snake', 'Pit', 'Paul', 'Massie', 'Canadian', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'THE', 'TWO', 'FACES', 'OF', 'DR.', 'JEKYLL', 'Morley', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'forThe', 'African', 'Queen', 'Beat', 'Devil', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'IN', '80', 'DAYS', 'Hyde-White', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'forMy', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Third', 'Man', 'THE', 'BROWNING', 'VERSION', 'LETS', 'MAKE', 'LOVE', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Montand.The', 'film', 'well-acted', 'given', 'greatest', 'energy', 'dueling', 'byplay', 'comic', 'veterans', 'Morley', 'Hyde-White', 'Wattis', 'was', 'based', 'original', '1935', 'theater', 'production', 'Libel', 'was', 'directed', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'years', 'made', 'debut', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'director', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'medieval', 'French', 'story', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'THE', 'RETURN', 'OF', 'MARTIN', 'GUERRE', 'was', 'based', 'Jodie', ""Foster'sSommersbywas"", 'American', 'remake', 'picture', 'leave', 'lingering', 'doubts', 'viewer', 'mind', 'happened', 'men', 'dog', 'tags', 'did', ""n't"", 'British', 'troops', 'have', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'odd', 'business', 'leather', 'jacket', 'bottom', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'somebody', 'commit', 'grievous', 'bodily', 'somebody', 'possibly', 'killing', 'scriptwriters', 'director', 'Bogarde', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'ambiguity', 'one', 'watched', 'closing', 'not', 'completely', 'convinced', 'man', 'calling', 'Sir', 'Mark', 'was', 'actually', 'Sir', 'Mark']",Libel
