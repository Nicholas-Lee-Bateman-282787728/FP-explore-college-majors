The only thing I noted was some of the lighting colors looked somewhat odd at times.  Also, when they did some smoke effect on the stage the picture got rather &#34;flat&#34; but I've noticed that on other Blu-Ray concerts when they use smoke on stage with lighting or lasers.I very much enjoyed the performance.  I'm not sure why they went with the 3D effect for this production but it worked ok for me in the end.",5,Works for me on my non 3D rig,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,548,"['have', 'Sony', 'KDS-60A2000', 'HD', '1080p', 'TV', 'Sony', 'Blu-Ray', 'BDP-S550', 'player', 'neither-3D', 'disc', 'played', 'major', 'issues', 'only', 'thing', 'noted', 'was', 'lighting', 'colors', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'times', 'Also', 'when', 'did', 'smoke', 'effect', 'stage', 'picture', 'got', 'rather', '34', 'flat', '34', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'other', 'Blu-Ray', 'concerts', 'when', 'use', 'smoke', 'stage', 'lighting', 'lasers.I', 'very', 'much', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'went', '3D', 'effect', 'production', 'worked', 'ok', 'end']",The Scorpions: Get Your Sting & Blackout Live in 3D

I do not have a 3D TV, but it plays perfect with stunning picture quality in regular 2D mode.  The audio is perfect (it's perfectly in sync with the video and the mix is great).  The performance is awesome, and best of all, the camera work is really great (no hyper fast editing like on most modern concert videos).  This Blu-ray is extremely well done in all respects.

I do have to say that it has a remarkably clear picture, and I can get a sense of what I've read from other reviewers regarding the advantageous close ups with various members of the group and how those scenes must really pop in 3D. Great choice of a setlist, not bogged down at all, and a good cross-section of old and new.VERY cool guitars,especially Rhythm guitarist Rudolph Schenker's automobile-themed guitars.Also very eye-catching were the Flying V and Explorer styled acoustic guitars played by Schenker and Lead Guitarist Mathias Jabs.A very good punchy audio surround mix makes this show a keeper.It's a shame that these guys are about to hang it up, as they appear to have a lot of mileage left,but it's better to go out on top,I suppose.
