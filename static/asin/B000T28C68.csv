I have watched her for years and she always brings a smile to my face. So, of course, I was looking forward to watching her first DVD release.Actually, I wish they would have put out a ""Season One"" DVD and then proceeded in chronological order. But instead this is a ""best of"" collection of 9 cases compiled from various seasons. For me the last two cases were the most interesting. The 8th case involved an alcoholic hillbilly trying to claim he wasn't driving drunk when he smashed into another family's vehicle. The best part was the hilarious video tape which showed the boozed up fool tripping and falling to the ground. The final case wasn't so much funny as pathetically sad. It shows a woman suing her neighbor over a wrecked truck. But it was the woman's own irresponsible actions, giving the keys to her 14 yeard old son, that allowed the neighbor's 14 year old daughter to die in the accident. This woman has to be one of the most selfish, cold hearted individuals I have ever seen. Fortunately, Judge Judy let her have it exactly as she deserved. Another case involving a very hotheaded Colorado hunter is also worth watching. The guy might have actually been in the right. But he behaved like such a clown that Judge Judy clearly wasn't going to give him the benefit of the doubt.This DVD also includes several ""extras"" such as Judge Judy's two 60 Minutes interviews and a scene showing her receiving her star on the Hollywood ""Walk Of Fame"". As I said earlier, I would have preferred a ""Season One"" DVD. But this is worth at least a rental for those who love Judge Judy, her inimitable style, clever remarks and passion for the truth.",4,The Wit And Wisdom of Judge Judy,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,1783,"['world', 'full', 'people', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'nice', 'have', 'someone', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'call', 'out', 'idiots', 'tell', 'have', 'watched', 'years', 'always', 'smile', 'face', 'So', 'course', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'first', 'DVD', 'release.Actually', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'then', 'proceeded', 'chronological', 'order', 'instead', 'best', 'collection', '9', 'cases', 'compiled', 'various', 'seasons', 'last', 'two', 'cases', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', '8th', 'case', 'involved', 'alcoholic', 'hillbilly', 'trying', 'claim', 'was', ""n't"", 'driving', 'drunk', 'when', 'smashed', 'family', 'vehicle', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'hilarious', 'video', 'tape', 'showed', 'boozed', 'up', 'fool', 'tripping', 'falling', 'ground', 'final', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'funny', 'pathetically', 'sad', 'woman', 'suing', 'neighbor', 'wrecked', 'truck', 'was', 'woman', 'own', 'irresponsible', 'actions', 'giving', 'keys', '14', 'yeard', 'old', 'son', 'allowed', 'neighbor', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'die', 'accident', 'woman', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'selfish', 'cold', 'hearted', 'individuals', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Fortunately', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'let', 'have', 'exactly', 'deserved', 'case', 'involving', 'very', 'hotheaded', 'Colorado', 'hunter', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'guy', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'right', 'behaved', 'clown', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'several', 'extras', 'such', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'two', '60', 'Minutes', 'interviews', 'scene', 'showing', 'receiving', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Walk', 'Fame', 'said', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'worth', 'least', 'rental', 'who', 'love', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'inimitable', 'style', 'clever', 'remarks', 'passion', 'truth']",Judge Judy: Justice Served

Many seem to find the show's biggest attraction in how Judge Scheindlin humiliates the litigants, so the choice of cases and participants is critical in determining how entertaining the show will be.  I find the litigants' psychoses and desperate self-justification even funnier than Judy's acerbic comments.  Unfortunately, I could easily remember quite a few cases more interesting than those on this DVD.  The only really great one here is the young woman who, failing to get out of a speeding ticket, wrote a complaint against the LAPD officer who stopped her.  You can really get a more enjoyable serving of Judge Judy on YouTube, although with the release of this DVD, perhaps the show's producers will soon have those on YouTube removed.  I'm hoping that this is a mere trial to see whether there's enough of a market to produce more JJ collections on DVD.

There aren't many episodes I haven't seen, except for the early years, but I had seen all nine on this DVD. Only two episodes, and possibly a third were, in my opinion, deserving of a ""best"" collection. Having seen the show more times than I should admit, there were much better episodes than at least six of the episodes chosen.This DVD also contains the two specials that 60 Minutes did on her. The first was before she became ""Judge Judy"", and likely is what got her the job. It showcased a tough as nails family court judge who brooked no ""nonsense"" and was firmly in control of her court room at all times. The second was well after she had become Judge Judy, and showed us a bit of what fame had given her (a few homes, a few ""extra parts"", as she said, and it looks like her husband, the judge on People's Court for two years) had a bit of work done too. If you ever saw him on People's Court - I saw him a couple of times - he was funny. To one lady he once said, ""You have a hot temper. And I know something about hot tempers."" Obviously referring to his wife, this drew great laughs from the audience.There's a segment on her ""isms"", and, well, it's not terribly entertaining, unless you haven't seen her show that often and want to see what makes her unique, or you really, really enjoy her and can't get enough of her. For even the casual fan, it's only mildly interesting to watch.What frustrated me personally was that the DVD was neither captioned nor subtitled. It stuns me that as 2007 comes to a close, DVDs are still being released without captions or subtitles. Do they not want deaf or hearing impaired people to buy the DVD? It's not terribly expensive to have something captioned, and her TV shows are all captioned, so the exclusion on the DVD was disappointing. Being hearing impaired, I guess it was a good thing that I had seen all of the episodes before. But, that's why I have these:TV Ears. They work marvelously.Aside from hearing impaired people, there were no Spanish subtitles either, so I guess they weren't interested in the Spanish-speaking population - a large one - buying this either.I wouldn't mind seeing a second DVD, so long as they caption it, and are more judicious in their selections.",3,Served lukewarm,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2341,"['enjoy', 'watching', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'TiVo', 'regularly', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'allow', 'time', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'early', 'years', 'had', 'seen', 'nine', 'DVD', 'Only', 'two', 'episodes', 'possibly', 'third', 'were', 'opinion', 'deserving', 'best', 'collection', 'Having', 'seen', 'show', 'more', 'times', 'should', 'admit', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'episodes', 'least', 'six', 'episodes', 'chosen.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'two', 'specials', '60', 'Minutes', 'did', 'first', 'was', 'became', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'likely', 'what', 'got', 'job', 'showcased', 'tough', 'nails', 'family', 'court', 'judge', 'who', 'brooked', 'nonsense', 'was', 'firmly', 'control', 'court', 'room', 'times', 'second', 'was', 'well', 'had', 'become', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'showed', 'bit', 'what', 'fame', 'had', 'given', 'few', 'homes', 'few', 'extra', 'parts', 'said', 'husband', 'judge', 'People', 'Court', 'two', 'years', 'had', 'bit', 'work', 'done', 'too', 'ever', 'saw', 'People', 'Court', 'saw', 'couple', 'times', 'was', 'funny', 'one', 'lady', 'once', 'said', 'have', 'hot', 'temper', 'know', 'something', 'hot', 'tempers', 'Obviously', 'referring', 'wife', 'great', 'laughs', 'audience.There', 'segment', 'isms', 'well', 'not', 'terribly', 'entertaining', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'often', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'unique', 'really', 'really', 'enjoy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'watch.What', 'frustrated', 'personally', 'was', 'DVD', 'was', 'captioned', 'subtitled', '2007', 'close', 'DVDs', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'released', 'captions', 'subtitles', 'Do', 'not', 'want', 'deaf', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'people', 'buy', 'DVD', 'not', 'terribly', 'expensive', 'have', 'something', 'captioned', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'captioned', 'exclusion', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Being', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'guess', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'had', 'seen', 'episodes', 'why', 'have', 'TV', 'Ears', 'work', 'marvelously.Aside', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'people', 'were', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'guess', 'were', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Spanish-speaking', 'population', 'large', 'one', 'buying', 'either.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'second', 'DVD', 'so', 'long', 'caption', 'are', 'more', 'judicious', 'selections']",Judge Judy: Justice Served

It starts out with a case involving a fight over Tupperware. The plaintiff is hilariously dramatic and I can watch this one over and over. Other highlights are the silly platinum blonde who complained to the LAPD after getting a speeding ticket  (""You're a big baby"", Judy tells her) and the drunken man who backed into a couple's car then tripped and fell in their garden. Less entertaining is the very long case of the Yorba Linda teens who sued a limo company who were late on their prom night. The DVD ends with an unusually serious case about a woman who's suing the mother of a girl who died in a car accident, for damages to her car.So the collection is a mixed bunch. Some of them are hilarious, others are not. Entertaining for the most part, but could have been better.On to the extra features. There are some promotional pieces for her show, not very interesting. A short segment from when she got her star on the Walk of Fame, and a very interesting 1993 story on Family court judge Judith Sheindlin.
