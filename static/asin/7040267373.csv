486799,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,7040267373,A Customer,"[9, 11]","German with English subtitles. I'll summarize what's on the cover.Alex and his family live in East Germany. His mother, a devoted Communist, goes into a coma. When she awakens, the Berlin Wall has fallen, but Alex hides this from her. She still has a weak heart, and the shock of Capitalism might be too much.What a wonderful angle for approaching the reunification of Germany. A memorable blend of the dramatic and the comic. Not ""laugh track"" comic. Wit and a delicious sense of irony. Is that ""East German humor"" or just the filmmaker's sense of humor? Whatever it is, I love it. It's so unlike what I'm used to seeing.Also, lest we forget, I live in a country that has opened to the West and is, for the most part, communist only in name now, so I'd like to laud the realism. When East met West in Germany in 1989, at times they seemed to be from two different planets. It's not like that in China, although it probably was when Nixon came to town. This is a remarkable film, well worth watching.I've reviewed one other film about a pretense, by the way, but I didn't tell you about the pretense because I didn't want to spoil the surprise. It was LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, by an Italian director. In it, some Jews get sent to a concentration camp, but our hero convinces his son it's a voluntary trip to an exclusive holiday resort. Wow!To continue digressing, to such a degree that Dr Z might be proud, I started writing a book where my hero had a specific type of amnesia. He lost 18 years, I think it was. When asked who the president was, he answered Bush, but he meant the first one. My little joke. I really wanted to do the time warp here, and how you'd do things differently if you suddenly became the person you were 20 years ago. Then 9/11 came along. I didn't want to write about it. Plus, the original project was getting boring, so I just scrapped it.",5,"Good Bye, Lenin!",1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1862,"['German', 'English', 'subtitles', ""'ll"", 'summarize', 'what', 'cover.Alex', 'family', 'live', 'East', 'Germany', 'mother', 'devoted', 'Communist', 'coma', 'When', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'fallen', 'Alex', 'still', 'weak', 'heart', 'shock', 'Capitalism', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much.What', 'wonderful', 'angle', 'approaching', 'reunification', 'Germany', 'A', 'memorable', 'blend', 'dramatic', 'comic', 'Not', 'laugh', 'track', 'comic', 'Wit', 'delicious', 'sense', 'irony', 'East', 'German', 'humor', 'just', 'filmmaker', 'sense', 'humor', 'love', 'so', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing.Also', 'lest', 'forget', 'live', 'country', 'opened', 'West', 'most', 'part', 'communist', 'only', 'name', 'now', ""'d"", 'like', 'laud', 'realism', 'When', 'East', 'met', 'West', 'Germany', '1989', 'times', 'seemed', 'be', 'two', 'different', 'planets', 'not', 'China', 'probably', 'was', 'when', 'Nixon', 'came', 'town', 'remarkable', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.I', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'pretense', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'pretense', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'was', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'Italian', 'director', 'Jews', 'get', 'sent', 'concentration', 'camp', 'hero', 'son', 'voluntary', 'trip', 'exclusive', 'holiday', 'resort', 'Wow', 'continue', 'digressing', 'degree', 'Dr', 'Z', 'might', 'be', 'proud', 'started', 'writing', 'book', 'where', 'hero', 'had', 'specific', 'type', 'amnesia', 'lost', '18', 'years', 'think', 'was', 'When', 'asked', 'who', 'president', 'was', 'answered', 'Bush', 'meant', 'first', 'one', 'little', 'joke', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'time', 'warp', 'here', 'how', ""'d"", 'do', 'things', 'differently', 'suddenly', 'became', 'person', 'were', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Then', '9/11', 'came', 'along', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'original', 'project', 'was', 'getting', 'boring', 'just', 'scrapped']",N/A

486801,AGEIT17HENDIS,7040267373,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 5]","Some things are painful in life. As a life-long anti-Stalinist, pro-socialist militant the demise of the Democratic Republic of Germany and its theory of ""socialism in half a country"" and later, on its heels, the demise of the Soviet Union and its theory of ""socialism in one country"" were nevertheless social disasters of historic proportions for me. One result is that we live in the age of the one superpower world dominated by the United States and its genuine capacity for making trouble, militarily unchecked by any other power. Friends there is nothing good about that. Witness Iraq and many other hot spots in the world.But enough of that because, despite my obvious different political take on what happened in East Germany in late 1989 and early 1990, this film Good Bye, Lenin is a very interesting view on what happened to one fictionalized family of mixed political and social sensibilities during that period. The film has been advertised as a comedy, and although there are some funny moments like the various attempts by some of the characters, including the main character son Alex, to create alternate social universes, there is more than a hint of satire (and sometimes localized `insider' satire) here. And satire is a very precious commodity in an age where everything is taken literally, whether it should be or not. Thus, a good prescription is -fight hard for your politics but take a minute to see humor in the sometimes absurd ways of this wicked old world.The device used to create the central plot in this film has a long pedigree, although I believe that it might be the first time that it has been used in an attempt to preserve socialist reality. Quickly outlined, a son (the previously mentioned Alex) attempts, almost manically at times, to create ""socialism in one bedroom"" for his ailing mother who upon awaking in 1990 after eight months from a coma induced by a heart attack after witnessing him being beaten by the Statsi needs to, on doctor's advise, avoid any `excitement' on pains of relapse (and possible death). The dramatic tension revolves around an ever-widening and bizarre conspiracy (including drawing in his skeptical Russian girlfriend, his sister, her boyfriend, the neighbors, former colleagues, etc.) to keep mom in the dark about everything that has gone on during that time.A subplot, however, reveals that Mom, in need of illusions as she might be, has secrets of her own in relationship to the whereabouts of her husband who left for West Germany in the past without his family, mainly because she balked at going for her own reasons. There are, additionally, many sight gags or things that pass for sight gags in a society that had a very limited exposure to the `virtues' of Western consumer society. But enough said, get this film if you want a very smart look at what happens when cultural changes come fast and furious. Not everyone can, or should, adjust accordingly. But also get it, if I may add, so that you can begin to understand why mother wanted to stick with the old socialist ways, as she understood that concept. And maybe fight for them, as well.",5,"On ""Socialist"" Lies",1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,3121,"['things', 'are', 'painful', 'life', 'life-long', 'anti-Stalinist', 'pro-socialist', 'militant', 'demise', 'Democratic', 'Republic', 'Germany', 'theory', 'socialism', 'country', 'later', 'heels', 'demise', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'theory', 'socialism', 'one', 'country', 'were', 'nevertheless', 'social', 'disasters', 'historic', 'proportions', 'One', 'result', 'live', 'age', 'one', 'superpower', 'world', 'dominated', 'United', 'States', 'genuine', 'capacity', 'making', 'trouble', 'militarily', 'unchecked', 'other', 'power', 'Friends', 'nothing', 'good', 'Witness', 'Iraq', 'many', 'other', 'hot', 'spots', 'world.But', 'enough', 'obvious', 'different', 'political', 'take', 'what', 'happened', 'East', 'Germany', 'late', '1989', 'early', '1990', 'film', 'Good', 'Bye', 'Lenin', 'very', 'interesting', 'view', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'fictionalized', 'family', 'mixed', 'political', 'social', 'sensibilities', 'period', 'film', 'been', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'various', 'attempts', 'characters', 'including', 'main', 'character', 'son', 'Alex', 'create', 'alternate', 'social', 'universes', 'more', 'hint', 'satire', 'sometimes', 'localized', 'insider', 'satire', 'here', 'satire', 'very', 'precious', 'commodity', 'age', 'where', 'everything', 'taken', 'literally', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'Thus', 'good', 'prescription', '-fight', 'hard', 'politics', 'take', 'minute', 'see', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'absurd', 'ways', 'wicked', 'old', 'world.The', 'device', 'used', 'create', 'central', 'plot', 'film', 'long', 'pedigree', 'believe', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'been', 'used', 'attempt', 'preserve', 'socialist', 'reality', 'Quickly', 'outlined', 'son', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Alex', 'attempts', 'almost', 'manically', 'times', 'create', 'socialism', 'one', 'bedroom', 'ailing', 'mother', 'who', 'awaking', '1990', 'eight', 'months', 'coma', 'induced', 'heart', 'attack', 'witnessing', 'being', 'beaten', 'Statsi', 'doctor', 'advise', 'avoid', 'excitement', 'pains', 'relapse', 'possible', 'death', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'ever-widening', 'bizarre', 'conspiracy', 'including', 'drawing', 'skeptical', 'Russian', 'girlfriend', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'neighbors', 'former', 'colleagues', 'etc', 'keep', 'mom', 'dark', 'everything', 'gone', 'time.A', 'subplot', 'however', 'reveals', 'Mom', 'need', 'illusions', 'might', 'be', 'secrets', 'own', 'relationship', 'whereabouts', 'husband', 'who', 'left', 'West', 'Germany', 'past', 'family', 'mainly', 'balked', 'going', 'own', 'reasons', 'are', 'additionally', 'many', 'sight', 'gags', 'things', 'pass', 'sight', 'gags', 'society', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'exposure', 'virtues', 'Western', 'consumer', 'society', 'enough', 'said', 'get', 'film', 'want', 'very', 'smart', 'look', 'what', 'when', 'cultural', 'changes', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'should', 'adjust', 'accordingly', 'also', 'get', 'may', 'add', 'can', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'mother', 'wanted', 'stick', 'old', 'socialist', 'ways', 'understood', 'concept', 'maybe', 'fight', 'as', 'well']",N/A

I was very interested in the topic of the movie. I like the portrayal of the different takes. You have the older people who miss some of the stability of their previous life, those who wouldn't necessarily go back but don't like all of the trappings of western society, and the young who adapt to western culture even though it isn't as perfect as it might have seemed. The premise of the story is interesting too. It's funny to see how the son tries to maintain the appearance of the old East Germany even as it slips away.

In light of that success, it was disappointing to have to wait well over a year for it to arrive in U.S. theaters.The U.S. trailer depicts a goofy comedy, but this is actually a touching movie about one family in the former East Germany struggling through the changes brought on in 1989 by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the DDR state.  In addition, it's a great little history lesson - there are great intermingled clips of East German leaders Erich Honecker, Egon Krenz and of other leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev and Helmut Kohl.  Footage of ""Ossies"" stampeding into friendly Embassies right before the Wall tumbles are turned inside-out and artfully presented as Westerners clamoring to get into the ""socialist paradise.""Even though this is Daniel Bruehl's movie (as the lead character 'Alex,' he appears in everyone of the scenes), it's his comic foil (and new 'Wessie' pal) Denis (as wonderfully played by Florian Lukas) who stands out.  Whether it's his unbridled delight at sneaking his low-budget '2001' homage into a wedding video, or his portrayal as a spot-on, faux East German network newsreader, Lukas' brand of humor is one that transcends any language gap.  He must have had them howling in the theaters in Germany.To get a real sense of the German experience since 1989, I highly recommend you catch 'Goodbye Lenin' while it's still in theaters.",5,Not the goofy comedy depicted in the trailer,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,1516,"['Wolfgang', 'Becker', 'Goodbye', 'Leinin', 'was', 'phenomenon', 'Germany', 'packing', 'theaters', 'sweeping', '2003', 'European', 'Film', 'Awards', 'Berlin', 'light', 'success', 'was', 'disappointing', 'have', 'wait', 'well', 'year', 'arrive', 'U.S.', 'theaters.The', 'U.S.', 'trailer', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'actually', 'touching', 'movie', 'one', 'family', 'former', 'East', 'Germany', 'struggling', 'changes', 'brought', '1989', 'fall', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'collapse', 'DDR', 'state', 'addition', 'great', 'little', 'history', 'lesson', 'are', 'great', 'intermingled', 'clips', 'East', 'German', 'leaders', 'Erich', 'Honecker', 'Egon', 'Krenz', 'other', 'leaders', 'Mikhail', 'Gorbachev', 'Helmut', 'Kohl', 'Footage', 'Ossies', 'stampeding', 'friendly', 'Embassies', 'right', 'Wall', 'tumbles', 'are', 'turned', 'inside-out', 'artfully', 'presented', 'Westerners', 'clamoring', 'get', 'socialist', 'paradise', 'Even', 'Daniel', 'Bruehl', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', ""'Alex"", 'everyone', 'scenes', 'comic', 'foil', 'new', ""'Wessie"", 'pal', 'Denis', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Florian', 'Lukas', 'who', 'out', 'unbridled', 'delight', 'sneaking', 'low-budget', ""'2001"", 'homage', 'wedding', 'video', 'portrayal', 'spot-on', 'faux', 'East', 'German', 'network', 'newsreader', 'Lukas', 'brand', 'humor', 'one', 'language', 'gap', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'howling', 'theaters', 'Germany.To', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'German', 'experience', '1989', 'highly', 'recommend', 'catch', 'Lenin', 'still', 'theaters']",N/A
486804,A2EL3990HXOMZB,7040267373,Antonio Robert,"[21, 23]","With films like ""Good Bye, Lenin!"", both the critics' and viewers' darling in Europe (winner of Felix for Best European Film and French Cesar for Best EU Film of 2003), you should put your logic to rest -- this is a black comedy which crumbles under strict common sense; but when you try to understand its point of view, you may relish in the ""American Beauty""-lite distorted story with lots of truth hidden inside.Alex (Daniel Bruehl) is a 20-something young man, whose mother, on the surface a devoted citizen of communist East Germany, suffers a heart attack, having witnessed a protest in October 1989. After she 'wakes up' eight months afterward, the communist regime is gone and the unification of Germany after 42 years of split is pending. But Alex, afraid of a crushing blow this reality would mean for her, takes great pains to persuade his bed-ridden mom that German Democratic Republic is still a reality -- he gets out-of-use groceries for her, shows her old-times video footage and gets 'enthusiastic' neighbors playing their roles to achieve the goal. Yet we feel that the moment the mother Christiane (Katrin Sass) finally finds out what's going on, is imminent.Director Wolfgang Becker skilfully and un-pathetically intertwines two layers of a story -- the real fate of this particular family is far from happy and is in a strange, thought-provoking contrast with the comedian bulk of the story. The film's sober bitter-sweetness confirms that almost nothing in this world is only black or only white.Although the potential of the movie to let outsiders feel what it really meant for ordinary people to live on the wrong side of Berlin Wall is a bit questionable (although favored, ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" was snubbed at Oscar nominations), it's already one of the definitive film (and artistic) statements of Germany's unifying process and may well prove essential for students of German and maybe even Eastern Europe's history in the 20th century.",4,"Bye Lenin, Welcome Unified Germany...

486807,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,7040267373,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[4, 5]","""Goodbye, Lenin"" provides not only an entertaining story, but a glimpse into East Germany as it existed prior to unification.  The premise is straightforward: a woman slips into a coma a few days before the Berlin Wall comes down. We find out that she is a committed socialist who'd thrown herself into party work years before, after her husband had escaped to the West. While she is unconscious, everything changes, and changes rapidly.  We see through the eyes of her son, Alex, the new possibilities open to East Germans as they are free to travel and have access to consumer goods.  When Alex's mother wakes up, Alex is told that she must not be exposed to any shock.  Thus, he re-creates in their apartment East Germany as it existed until a few months before -- complete with created ""news"" programs played on a secret VCR, ""Young Pioneers"" serenading her on her birthday, East German interior design, and inferior products no longer available in supermarkets.Keeping this up, however, takes a lot of work and a lot of ever-more-complicated lies.  (O, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!) As Alex continues this venture, he is drawn further and further into the socialist dream held by his mother.  While the film has been criticized for not showing the darker side of East German life, the bad is not ignored entirely: the Stasi make a brief appearance; the reasons for Alex's father's escape to the West are revealed; the circumstances surrounding mother's job are revealed; the shoddy construction of the apartment is apparent.  The point, though, is that Alex is constructing a fantasy world that is built on a lie.  And indeed, East Germany itself was built on a communist fantasy that was never realized.The film also provides a taste of the shock that all East Germans must have experienced as they moved abruptly from a socialist state to a free-market economy and, in less than one year, were unified with their former Cold War enemy.  The story is well-told and well-acted.  It is funny, poignant, and thought-provoking.  The ending is moving.

486809,A20IIR0422G3A5,7040267373,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","This German film represents to me the constant question of what European movies by the likes of Fellini, Truffaut, Renoir and Bergman have that American movies don't which make these movies seem so much better than many American movies, while lacking many niceties sported by Hollywood movies which make them shine with a surface quality the European films lack. Why else would we bother to watch these flicks while keeping one eye on the action and another on the subtitles.Fortunately, I know German, so I could keep both eyes on the action, checking the subtitles occasionally to check the accuracy of the translation. While not perfectly literal, it was a good translation into colloquial English, with even the occasional curse word properly translated, although there was rarely anything stronger than the German `Sheise'. The movie's `R' rating is a total mystery to me. There is some very brief nudity and sex, but hardly any language 13 year olds have not already heard aplenty. My best explanation for it is that the setting of the brief incidents is so believable that it may have a much stronger impact on a young viewer than sex or violence in an implausibly plotted Hollywood product. This is like `Lord of the Rings' receiving a PG-13 for `epic battle sequences and story images'.There is little suspense in the story as much of it is summarized on the back of the jewel case, so I have no qualms in outlining it here. The story is all about a family of four living in East Berlin. In 1979, the doctor father leaves an East German family, nominally to live with a girlfriend in West Germany after leaving the East to attend a medical convention in Dusseldorf. The shock of the seeming abandonment sends the mother into a catatonia. After treatment at an East German sanitarium, she returns filled with zeal and idealism about East German socialism, vigorously following this path for eight years until 1989, when she has a heart attack upon seeing her son being arrested in a protest march against the Berlin wall. The attack is not treated as quickly as it should have been, so the mother remains in a coma for eight months. In this time, the East German communist party dissolves the Berlin wall is demolished and East and West Berlin and East and West Germany become one country. At this point, the mother awakes from her coma and doctors say she can experience no shocks, as they would probably drive her to a relapse. Since the son believes that hearing of the fall of the GDR (East Germany) would probably be such a shock, he insists on taking his mother home and editing everything she sees and hears with the help of a colleague who is a budding television producer. The chum gets old television newsreels and the two of them create new ones in a makeshift studio. One new newsreel has to be created when the mother sees a giant Coca-Cola banner on the wall of a tall building just outside their window. The cover story is that the poor giant Atlanta company had to have help from a large East German bottler to make their European bottling quotas. A second, more elaborate ruse must be constructed when the mother manages to wander out onto the street filled with western autos and, of all things, IKEA ads for `Billy' bookshelves on kiosks. The story is complicated by the sister's involvement with a West German and the drunken former principal at her school and mercenary former students bribed into singing for the mother in East German Pioneer scarves. The resolution with the family's father is something of a surprise, as is the resolution of the ruse about the East German regime.There is certainly a lot of intentional humor in this movie, but it is really hard to call it a comedy. One of the most subtly funny moments was the `quote' from Fellini's `La Dolce Vita' where the mother sees the top half of a statue of Lenin being hauled off to some ignominious fate by a low flying helicopter. Writers and Director Wolfgang Becker replaced Fellini's statue of Christ with a statue of Lenin, leaving the viewer to make the connection. There are no gags and there is plenty of emotional pain and pathos, although the ending is logical and satisfying. The acting by the cast totally unknown to American experience is uniformly terrific. The other side of the coin is that it has the typically European lack of Hollywood veneer on its production values. The editing and direction are all good, but there are virtually no subtle touches in set decoration, set design, or cinematography. But, the story is so good, you hardly miss them.The packaging proudly proclaims that the movie won 15 German and European film awards and was nominated for best foreign film by both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. I must look up the winner of those awards, as a film better than this one would be something to see.As long as you have some taste for foreign films with subtitles, or know German, this movie will reward your watching it. Unlike a very select few foreign films like `La Femme Nikita' and `Run, Lola, Run', the movie may not have the kind of energy to overcome an aversion to subtitles, but I recommend it anyway. The version I saw in letterbox format had all subtitles below the film in the lower black bar, so there was absolutely no problem reading them, if you need them.Highly recommended.",5,Delicate Humor

Many thought Mr. Reagan hopelessly naive for even questioning the status quo with regard to Berlin, but down it came, showing us once again how history sometimes is less evolutionary than subject to punctuated equilibrium.  Think of geological plate tectonics---ie., earthquakes & volcanoes.  The Berlin Wall was an anachronism (likewise the division of Germany).  We---in the West, at least---knew it had to eventually come down, but never expected it to do so until it did. ""Goodbye, Lenin"" doesn't address whether east Germans believed similarly or not, but it is grounded in the abruptness with which the Berlin Wall did fall.  And it captures the essence of such most effectively, and does so in such a unique manner.  Most of the film takes place AFTER the Berlin Wall has been breeched, but---at one and the same time---the story ingeniously provides us, ie., the viewers, a  window into the east BEFORE this dramatic development.  Mind you, save for one exception, it doesn't concern itself with the dark side of the German ""Democratic"" Republic, ie., secret police activities, informers within society, and the like.  (If you are interested in such, have a look at Timothy Garton Ash's book, ""The File."" It's about how the Stasi security services kept tabs on this British journalist, as well as on millions of its own citizens.)  ""Goodbye Lenin,"" nonetheless, does give one a taste of East Berlin and that it does so in such a whimsical way makes for an entertaining film (the details of which I assume you have already familiarized yourself with above.) In addition, the acting herein is more than above average, and the direction is most able--in particular, a scene of a moving Lenin statue is accomplished with great effect; and is, to boot, hilarious.  (If you think Reagan was the incarnation of the devil & simply wish to register that view---although it has nothing to do with this film---then go ahead and ignore this well made film; otherwise do have a look at this film & do listen to the director's commentary on this DVD as well.  It will clue you in to a lot---after watching this film---that you didn't even know you missed, but did!)

As Alex says in the film, he ends up portraying East Germany as how he wishes it was, rather than how it had been.

""Good bye, Lenin!"" is an improbable farce about an East Berlin family at the dawn of reunification.  Hannah is a devoted Marxist whose greatest pleasures are volunteering at Pioneer Camp and writing letters of protest to shoddy East German manufacturers.  Her son Alex covets the more ""bourgeois"" pleasures to be found on the West side of the wall.  But when Mutti has a heart attack and falls into a coma, her doting son will go to extremes to resurrect the defunct regime.  During the eight months that Hannah lay unconscious, the wall has fallen and her ""Socialist Paradise"" has forever changed.  But her doctors warn that the abrupt culture shock could kill the fragile invalid.  So Alex enlists the aid of mom's neighbors and students and even some of her heroes to carry out the illusion that everything is still the same.  Maintaining the hoax becomes frustrating as familiar products become scarce, but the big challenges are yet to come.  Soon gigantic statues of Lenin start coming down and gigantic billboards for CocaCola going up.  And how to explain the massive influx of ""Wessies"" into their neighborhood?  With the help of his friend, a brilliant film-student, Alex devises some absurd but convincing propaganda.  His efforts are both touching and hilarious.  For all its comedy, this film is very poignant.  We realize that, despite the awful conditions, life in East Germany was not entirely miserable.  Many of Hannah's neighbors are also poorly adjusting to the onslaught of capitalism.  And as Alex strives to protect his mother from the truth, he discovers that she has been concealing a devastating secret of her own.  Watching this film was a roller coaster experience.

Tell her just like that? Or else pretend that nothing had happened? Such is the unusual dilemma facing young Alex Kerner (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), whose mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), as seen in (suitably grainy) family footage, immersed herself in anything to do with the Communist Party and its activities, including the Young Pioneers (the socialist equivalent of Scouts and Guides) shortly after her husband had fled to the West at a time when the German ""Democratic"" Republic (GDR) was rapt in the first flight of a citizen, Sigmund J&auml;hn, into space on board the then-extant Soviet space station, Mir.On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Alex joins many citizens calling out ""Keine Gewalt!""

Christiane, meanwhile, is on her way to a party meeting, but gets caught up in the demo and witnesses her son being dragged away by the ""Volkspolizei"" (GDR police). Son's and mother's eyes meet momentarily, and she collapses in the street. Alex wants to help her, but he is unceremoniously dragged on board a truck and beaten as he and others are taken to the local jail.

He also discovers later that a girl he met at the demo just happens to be a nurse called Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) with whom he eventually falls in love.Events move fast, and the Wall comes down the month after Alex's mother had slipped into her coma. Change is so rapid that Alex, whose love for his mother is as unswerving as hers is for the socialist homeland, fears that she may even die from the shock of realizing that her beloved socialist homeland has been replaced by a capitalist one. With the need for East Germans and West Germans to co-operate, Alex joins a satellite TV company from the western side and becomes part of an East-West team with Denis (Florian Lukas). It turns out that Denis is a wizard at making movies, so he hits upon the idea of fooling his mother with fake TV programmes (connected to hidden video recorders) that convey the idea that his mother's beloved socialist homeland was still very much alive.They make arrangements to ensure that everything is as normal as possible, including redecorating an entire room to look exactly like her mother's old bedroom and finding old bottles, glass jars and tins with familiar food labels on it - pickles from Holland won't do, so Alex must look in the most unlikely places for them! As she comes ""home"" after eight months in a coma, everything really does seem to be as normal - so long as she never leaves the bedroom. Aspects of ""old"" GDR life are seen as Alex persuades young and old, including disillusioned old Party activist Herr Ganske (J&uuml;rgen Holtz), to celebrate his mother's birthday by singing patriotic socialist songs about the homeland, though the game is almost given away by the untimely unfurling over a tall neighbouring apartment block wall ... of a Coca-Cola ad! Alex and Denis quickly dream up a way to provide a plausible explanation for the presence of this capitalist drink - a faked documentary that convinces Christiane that Coca-Cola actually came from the East!Later on, while Alex sleeps in the apartment, Christiane slips out of bed and into a world which has, indeed, changed, and she stares incredulously at the sight of West German Mercedes and Audi cars parked in the street, a billboard advertising IKEA furniture and at a statue (without legs) of Lenin, right arm outstretched, being carried under a helicopter, presumably to be scrapped, figuratively symbolizing the impending death of Communist rule in the GDR. The statue, in a somewhat bizarre way, appears to beckon to this disbelieving socialist stalwart as the helicopter flies past her. A shocked Alex and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) manage to hustle their wayward mother back to bed, but it is clear that the game has to end at some point.Just as Alex is about to reveal the deliberate deception during a family outing to the countryside, however, Christiane, in turn, makes a startling confession as to what really happened to her husband Robert (Burghart Klaussner) - and the alternative choice that she could have made for herself and her family, only for her to get cold feet and turn it down. So, now the shoe was proverbially on the other foot, as she begged forgiveness from her family from having lied to them all this time, unaware of the lies that Alex and company had been telling her.Having suffered yet another timely heart attack, she is taken to hospital again where, thanks to Denis, the deception ends with one last fake TV programme, which, given it does include genuine news archive footage of the momentous events surrounding the fall of the Wall, apparently convinces Christiane that many West Germans had found life on the western side too materialistic and shallow for their liking and seemed ready to embrace the socialist ideal, conveying the idea that there was more to life than just buying things. Christiane seems to be so happy, and she eventually dies just three days after the reunification of West and East Germany. Alex is both sad at his mother's death, but happy that she died happy, still apparently convinced that the socialist dream was intact even now. However, what Alex does not know was that she had, in fact, found out about the deception - through Lara, of all people. In a complete reversal of roles, she, in effect, becomes the deceiver rather than the deceived by deceiving her son into thinking that she had not known anything, yet she realises that he had done what he did to protect her, so she does this to ""protect"" him from his own ""reality"".Along with Bernd Lichtenberg, who wrote the screenplay, Wolfgang Becker co-wrote and directed this German movie, made by X Filme Creative Pool, the same company that made ""Run Lola Run"" (see my review), but distributed by Warner Bros for a worldwide audience. In total contrast to Winfried Bonengel's ""F&uuml;hrer Ex"" (see my review), this movie almost romanticizes what life was like in the socialist GDR, thus perhaps adding to the idea that socialism, for people like Christiane, really was a perfect dream for ordinary people - and, indeed, Alex helped to perpetuate that dream, even if the brutal realities of Communist life in the GDR go no further in this movie than the brief scene of rows of detainees with hands behind their heads in the prison itself before he is released.A parallel could be drawn between this movie and ""F&uuml;hrer Ex"": Tommy and Heiko from ""F&uuml;hrer Ex"" embrace neo-Nazism after their brutal treatment in jail whereas, before, they had never harboured such political ideology. Christiane, in this movie, had never embraced the socialist ideal before the Stasi (the GDR secret police) came looking for her absent husband. It seems that she had adopted this ideological stance as a kind of ""mask"", as if trying to hoodwink people (and, ultimately, herself) into thinking that she had fully embraced socialism and that her husband had fled because he had the ""wrong"" attitude. However, it seemed that it had gone so far over a period of over a decade that she really did believe in the ideal, thus indicating that one might eventually believe an ideal if it suits their situation where circumstances warrant.",4,How to fool your mother when your country has gone,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,7754,"['Many', 'sides', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'were', 'only', 'too', 'ready',

486815,A4K1SSFWR495O,7040267373,"C. M. Cotton ""Chris Cotton""","[2, 2]","I came across the super comedy a number of years ago when I was staying in Germany. I have a number of friends from Rostock Eastern Germany and as a lecturer in International Relations in the USA, have talked endlessly about life in the former Warsaw Pact countries with Czech, Polish and German friends. This film looks at the collapse of the GDR from one family's perspective in a way that mirrors what I was told happened by my friends.The plot is simple but intriguing. It begins in the closing days of the GDR. The narrative is given by Alexander (Daniel Bruhl), who is an unhappy young man living in a claustrophobic system, which he feels is oppressing him. He lives with his mother, a devout communist since her husband fled to the West and sister in a small communist flat in East Berlin. Alexander is involved in a demonstration and gets arrested in front of his mother. The shock of his arrest brings on a heart attack which leaves her in a comma for a number of months. Whilst the mother is in the comma the GDR collapses, the wall comes down, western goods and eventually money flood into the East, the sister finds a West German boyfriend, the family flat gets a western make over and many peoples lives change. When the mother awakens, the doctors are afraid a shock may kill her, so being a devout communist and fearing finding out there is no GDR any more, Alexander decides to keep what has happened secret from his mother, with hysterical consequences.Whilst the film is humorous it is also quite a sad and reflective film. It shows that not everything changed for the best and all things western had their personal and societal costs. The tension between East and West Germans, which I felt when I lived in Wurzburg in 1990 and Luneburg in 1992, comes across brilliantly. The characterisations used in the film are all sublime. The cost to East German society is left wide open so all can see in terms of, unemployment, alcoholism and the consequences for the family of an escapee to the West. I actually use this film in my USA International Relations classes, to show students that not everything was bad behind the Iron Curtain and that there was a severe societal cost to the wall coming down and the westernisation process.I think this film is sublime representation on life in an Eastern Bloc country and how the country changed due to westernisation. It is a comedy but it also shows the negative side to all the changes that happened in 1989 and 1990. I think this is the best German comedy I have seen in many years.

It is also well done. But there's more.The people who panned the film because it showed East Germany in a good light missed the point. This is a film about illusions: those of the DDR and its leaders and citizens; those of the mother after her husband leaves and she cannot follow; those of the son to protect his mother; those of the film-maker friend and his involvement in the deception; those of the makers of this film in recreating East Berlin several years before and flying Lenin down the street; those of the daughter dropping out of college to sell burgers; those of the first German cosmonaut now driving a taxi for a living; perhaps even those of us in the West and our illusion of consumption-based happiness and fulfillment.This is a far deeper look at much more that just what was wrong with East Germany, or a mother-son relationship. It has depths that reward multiple viewings. It forces us to ask about whether we are perceiving reality or whether we are part of a different mass-illusion. If you think it lets the DDR off the hook, watch it again. The film basically accuses the DDR of being a huge illusion foisted on a subject people, a total denial of reality. If you think that the film is saying that the DDR was a good thing, wake up and look at the film more closely.Enjoyable on many levels and recommended for all sorts of good reasons.",5,Beyond the chains of illusion,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1499,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'comments', 'film', 'most', 'positive', 'agree', 'positives', 'film', 'funny', 'warm', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'more.The', 'people', 'who', 'panned', 'film', 'showed', 'East', 'Germany', 'good', 'light', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'illusions', 'DDR', 'leaders', 'citizens', 'mother', 'husband', 'leaves', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'son', 'protect', 'mother', 'film-maker', 'friend', 'involvement', 'deception', 'makers', 'film', 'recreating', 'East', 'Berlin', 'several', 'years', 'flying', 'Lenin', 'street', 'daughter', 'dropping', 'college', 'sell', 'burgers', 'first', 'German', 'cosmonaut', 'now', 'driving', 'taxi', 'living', 'perhaps', 'even', 'West', 'illusion', 'consumption-based', 'happiness', 'fulfillment.This', 'far', 'deeper', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'East', 'Germany', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'depths', 'reward', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'ask', 'are', 'perceiving', 'reality', 'are', 'part', 'different', 'mass-illusion', 'think', 'DDR', 'hook', 'watch', 'again', 'film', 'basically', 'DDR', 'being', 'huge', 'illusion', 'foisted', 'subject', 'people', 'total', 'denial', 'reality', 'think', 'film', 'saying', 'DDR', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'wake', 'up', 'look', 'film', 'more', 'closely.Enjoyable', 'many', 'levels', 'recommended', 'sorts', 'good', 'reasons']",N/A
486817,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,7040267373,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 3]","Wolfgang Becker's 2003 film, Good Bye Lenin!, is not a great film, but it is far better than the usual Hollywood tripe, as well as being a cut above most independent films released by filmmakers not named John Sayles. The two hour long film was written by Becker, Bernd Lichtenberg, Hendrik Handloegten, Christoph Silber, and Achim von Borries, and has a unique, if strained premise- that as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 a devout East German Communist flunky, Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sa&szlig;), who lived in East Berlin fell into a coma after a heart attack and when she woke eight months later, her whole world changed, but her devoted son decides to recreate the fallen state so as to not be such a great shock to his mother's system.While the machinations that the son, Alex Kerner (Daniel Br&uuml;hl- a better looking Ashton Kutcher), his girlfriend Lara (Chulpan Khamatova)- a Russian nurse who was tending to Christiane, sister Ariane (Maria Simon), brother-in-law Rainer (Alexander Beyer), and neighbors go to reveal an occasional chuckle, the film could really have been something special- and great, had it played the drama closer to reality. This is not to say that there are not sweet and funny moments, but they cannot compare with such a great premise and the potential for a real exploration into the human psyche and politics' place within it could have provided. That said, the film, as is, is a very good one, and the acting is stellar. So is how the film deftly avoids falling into being a screed or one dimensional propaganda piece against Communism. We can see the failings of that system when we see how Alex struggles to get a certain type of pickle brand, Spreewald pickles, so his mother will not know the difference. When we see him and his friend Denis (Florian Lukas) ridiculously try to simulate old East German tv newscasts we see how self-defeating a system that denies ingenuity and individuality is. To wave that about as a club is bastardizing the art of the film. If only more artists would learn what Becker's film knows.What makes Good Bye Lenin! work as a film is not its political implications, nor the political setup, but the human moments, and it is the relative lack of them vis-&agrave;-vis the film's length that make the film both a joy and bit of a disappointment, for it seems to be a mix of the old television movie of the week formula from the 1970s and a European arts film, and does not fully succeed either way. The film's lack of poesy is its greatest flaw. But, taken as it is, Good Bye Lenin! is a most worthwhile film and a good chronicle of a clan in an era now passed, long passed, it seems.

After she awakens, he tries to make her believe the communist sistem is still there, for the doctor has said she wouldn`t stand another heart attack.This film is a funny comedy, not a slow one, as someone said in another review.  Didn't seem to me, at least.  Didn't notice the two hours.  It is, of course, a different sort of film, in everything, and that`s what is refreshing about it.  That`s probably because is a german film.  And this very important part of History is told from the point of view of germans.  From the point of view of people who lived it.  And of common people.  The fact that the main theme is the love of this man for his mother, and not romance (that is present also), as in most films, makes it different too, in a good way.It is a lovely film, with lovely characters.

486820,A2P49WD75WHAG5,7040267373,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 4]","As Goodbye Lenin opens, we learn that Christiane Kerner is a mother of two children, Alexander and Ariane, living in East Berlin in 1978.  Following the flight of her husband to the West for another woman, she focuses on raising her children and being a dedicated German socialist.  In other words, she becomes the bride of East Germany, being a teacher and helping dictate letters of complaint.Eleven years later, on the eve of a demonstration in October 1989, she sees her son Alex being arrested, and collapses from a heart attack.  However, she ends up in a coma due to her not being resuscitated in time.  When she wakes up eight months later, she is in for a surprise...Or at least that would've been the case.  Under orders from the doctor, to keep her from anything stressful or exciting lest she suffer a second and ultimately fatal heart attack, Alex, with the aid of his new West German friend Denis Domaschke, with whom he works flogging off satellite dishes in the newly liberated East Germany, contrives to make sure that in her eyes, nothing has changed.  This means restoring her bedroom back the way it was, furnishings and all, with no radio and TV.This becomes a vehicle for Denis, who aspires to be a feature film director, to edit some news footage and himself as news anchor, for the East German news videos for Christiane's eyes only.  When Christiane accidentally catches sight of a Coca Cola banner outside her window, Denis comes up with a propaganda news broadcast that it was actually East Germany that had invented Coca Cola!  This is just a series of well-meaning lies Alex constructs to keep his mother alive, to the consternation of Ariane, who is put out with the inconvenience of having to live back into a Stalinist East Germany by choice after having a taste of real freedom.  He also tries to get a few of his mother's old colleagues to go along with the farce, not to mention paying off some kids to dress up like the Young Pioneers, the communist youth, and sing communist songs to his mother.Yet while Christiane has been sleeping like Rip Van Winkle, she misses the resignation of General Secretary Erich Honecker, the collapse of the Wall, which led to a ""unique recycling project,"" her son's newly found liberation, such as going to the West, and meeting Lara, a beautiful Russian student nurse.  Ariane, in the meantime, drops out of college to become part of ""economic circulation,"" translation:  ""thank you for choosing Burger King.""  She herself finds a new flame, her co-worker Rainer.  The country itself becomes transformed, its supermarkets into ""gaudy consumer paradises, where the consumer was king,"" and in addition to Germany being the center of world attention, the country's victories in the World Cup adds to the excitement, where West Germany eventually beat Argentina 1-0 in the finals.  So when Alex goes to the supermarket to find Spreewald pickles and Mocca Fix Gold coffee, he's SOL.Speaking of music, if the piano during the scene when Christiane is being taken to the countryside is familiar, it's because it's by Yann Tiersen, who did the music for Amelie.  In fact it's the same music used in the open title sequence of Amelie!  What was that earlier about recycling?It's apparent that the old East Germany before the wall is symbolized by the well-meaning Christiane, and the new liberated East Germany, soon to be unified Germany on 3 October 1990, by Alex, Ariane, and Lara, for whom the future is bright.  But along with capitalism comes higher crime, greed, and decadent entertainment the likes of which had never seen the light of day since Weimar Germany.  A wonderful cast is led by Daniel Bruhl (Alex),  and Katrin Sass (Christiane).  Goodbye Lenin is an important film on Germany's history, not to mention a sweet yet sad comedy on rolling with the winds of change, and celebrating one's mother and motherland.",5,The winds of change blow not in Christiane's bedroom,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,3888,"['Goodbye', 'Lenin', 'learn', 'Christiane', 'Kerner', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'Alexander', 'Ariane', 'living', 'East', 'Berlin', '1978', 'Following', 'flight', 'husband', 'West', 'woman', 'raising', 'children', 'being', 'dedicated', 'German', 'socialist', 'other', 'words', 'bride', 'East', 'Germany', 'being', 'teacher', 'helping', 'dictate', 'letters', 'complaint.Eleven', 'years', 'later', 'eve', 'demonstration', 'October', '1989', 'son', 'Alex', 'being', 'arrested', 'heart', 'attack', 'However', 'up', 'coma', 'due', 'not', 'being', 'resuscitated', 'time', 'When', 'wakes', 'up', 'eight', 'months', 'later', 'surprise', 'least', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'case', 'orders', 'doctor', 'keep', 'anything', 'stressful', 'exciting', 'lest', 'suffer', 'second', 'ultimately', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'Alex', 'aid', 'new', 'West', 'German', 'friend', 'Denis', 'Domaschke', 'whom', 'flogging', 'off', 'satellite', 'dishes', 'newly', 'liberated', 'East', 'Germany', 'make', 'sure', 'eyes', 'nothing', 'changed', 'restoring', 'bedroom', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'furnishings', 'radio', 'TV.This', 'vehicle', 'Denis', 'who', 'be', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'edit', 'news', 'footage', 'news', 'anchor', 'East', 'German', 'news', 'videos', 'Christiane', 'eyes', 'only', 'When', 'Christiane', 'accidentally', 'sight', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'banner', 'window', 'Denis', 'up', 'propaganda', 'news', 'broadcast', 'was', 'actually', 'East', 'Germany', 'had', 'invented', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'just', 'series', 'well-meaning', 'lies', 'Alex', 'constructs', 'keep', 'mother', 'alive', 'consternation', 'Ariane', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'inconvenience', 'having', 'live', 'back', 'Stalinist', 'East', 'Germany', 'choice', 'having', 'taste', 'real', 'freedom', 'also', 'get', 'few', 'mother', 'old', 'colleagues', 'go', 'along', 'farce', 'not', 'mention', 'paying', 'off', 'kids', 'dress', 'up', 'Young', 'Pioneers', 'communist', 'youth', 'sing', 'communist', 'songs', 'mother.Yet', 'Christiane', 'been', 'sleeping', 'Rip', 'Van', 'Winkle', 'resignation', 'General', 'Secretary', 'Erich', 'Honecker', 'collapse', 'Wall', 'led', 'unique', 'recycling', 'project', 'son', 'newly', 'found', 'liberation', 'such', 'going', 'West', 'meeting', 'Lara', 'beautiful', 'Russian', 'student', 'nurse', 'Ariane', 'meantime', 'college', 'become', 'part', 'economic', 'circulation', 'translation', 'thank', 'choosing', 'Burger', 'King', 'herself', 'new', 'flame', 'co-worker', 'Rainer', 'country', 'transformed', 'supermarkets', 'gaudy', 'consumer', 'paradises', 'where', 'consumer', 'was', 'king', 'addition', 'Germany', 'being', 'center', 'world', 'attention', 'country', 'victories', 'World', 'Cup', 'excitement', 'where', 'West', 'Germany', 'eventually', 'beat', 'Argentina', '1-0', 'finals', 'So', 'when', 'Alex', 'supermarket', 'find', 'Spreewald', 'pickles', 'Mocca', 'Fix', 'Gold', 'coffee', 'SOL.Speaking', 'music', 'piano', 'scene', 'when', 'Christiane', 'being', 'taken', 'countryside', 'familiar', 'Yann', 'Tiersen', 'who', 'did', 'music', 'Amelie', 'fact', 'same', 'music', 'used', 'open', 'title', 'sequence', 'Amelie', 'What', 'was', 'earlier', 'recycling', 'apparent', 'old', 'East', 'Germany', 'wall', 'symbolized', 'well-meaning', 'Christiane', 'new', 'liberated', 'East', 'Germany', 'soon', 'be', 'unified', 'Germany', '3', 'October', '1990', 'Alex', 'Ariane', 'Lara', 'whom', 'future', 'bright', 'capitalism', 'higher', 'crime', 'greed', 'decadent', 'entertainment', 'likes', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Weimar', 'Germany', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'led', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Alex', 'Katrin', 'Sass', 'Christiane', 'Goodbye', 'Lenin', 'important', 'film', 'Germany', 'history', 'not', 'mention', 'sweet', 'yet', 'sad', 'comedy', 'rolling', 'winds', 'change', 'celebrating', 'one', 'mother', 'motherland']",N/A

486822,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,7040267373,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","In 2003, director Wolfgang Becker's film ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" (written by Bernd Lichtenberg and Becker) became a major success in the box office making over $79 million worldwide and the film won six European Film Awards and a winner of nine German Film Awards.  The film would feature cinematography by Martin Kukula and music by Yann Tiersen (""Am&eacute;lie"", ""Night Shift"", ""In Your Wake"").VIDEO:""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Picture quality varies as there are some parts that utilize old archived footage of East and West Germany ala 1989-1990 and tries to mix them with the more modern cinematography.  Modern cinematography is good but at times, I did see some parts with some haloing issues.  The film does utilize CG for a variety of scenes in order to make current Germany ala 2001 look like German in 1990, so the filmmakers and crew had a lot of work in trying to recreate that time period.Picture quality is good for DVD but I hope this is one title that Sony Pictures Classics considers for a possible Blu-ray release in the near future.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is presented in German Dolby Digital 5.1.  The dialogue and music is clear and understandable through the center and front channels.  Good use of surround channels for fireworks and other sound effects.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Good Bye, Lenin!"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Wolfgang Becker - Director Wolfgang Becker gives us the breakdown of how certain scenes were created, making the film look authentic and working with the various talent.* Cast Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Katrin Sa&szlig;.  The two talk about their scenes and joke around about their look and performance.* Deleted Scenes -(44:02) There are ten deleted scenes with a few that include optional commentary by Director Wolfgang Becker and editor Peter R. Adam.  Both talk about the challenge of editing the film down from 3 hours to 2 hours.* Lenin Learns to Fly Visual Effects Featurette - (20:32) Interviews with director Wolfgang Becker and the 3D team behind ""Good Bye, Lenin!"".  The crew discuss the challenges and work they did in trying to make the film look authentic and filming in 2001 but capturing how Germany looked in 1990.  From eliminating certain advertising areas, using advertisements of that time and a lot of CG work that had to be implemented throughout the film.* Mini Making-Of Featurette - (1:26) A short behind-the-scenes making of the film video montage.* Uncut ""Aktuelle Kamera"" Broadcasts - (7:53) The full uncut broadcasts of Denis's faux news casts.* Previews - Upcoming Sony Pictures Classics trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:""Good Bye, Lenin!"" was no doubt a major hit in Germany, especially for those who are nostalgic by the sight of familiar foods to the various news footage of that time.  Although I'm sure I'm missing out on certain details that Germans would easily pick up, I did find myself quite entertained by the actual ruse and how long can Alex keep it going for his mother.While described as a comedy film, it's important to note that it is not comedy in the American sense, and if anything, I would call it more of a black comedy with a mixed style of elements as it also is a coming-of-age film, a dramatic film and also a tragic film.I may not fully understand how it was like living in East Germany, let alone the West but I can feel sympathy to the characters in that life has changed so much for them during the unification.  Used to the GDR way, GDR products and government services, all was gone during the unification and in many ways, it was a new beginning. And I've read that the film's popularity resides within the nostalgia of the benefits from those services back then.But for me, I just found it so entertaining of how far Alex would go to keep his mother alive, to not scare her and to make her final year of living as comfortable as possible.  This is a son's love for his mother, having to see what had happen to her without their father, to see her suffer a nervous breakdown and I'm sure that sense of guilt has haunted him in the fact that he is responsible for his mother being hospitalized and putting her in a coma.The faux news broadcasts created by Alex and Denis was very clever and the overall performance by Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Katrin Sa&szlig; was fantastic.  Also, one of my favorite German actors Burghart Klau&szlig;ner (""The White Ribbon"", ""The Edukators""), despite a shorter role, did a tremendous job playing the father who makes his return.  I felt that Wolfgang Becker did a wonderful job in making sure to convey to the 3D artists of capturing that 1989-1990 look especially in 2001 and also giving us that sense that the film had taken place long ago.  Wonderfully edited and the music by Yann Tiersen was also as noticeable.I know I am reviewing this DVD a little late in 2010 versus 2003 but it's still a wonderful film from Sony Pictures Classics which I hope is released on Blu-ray in the near future.  As for the DVD, print quality is good (not great), audio quality is good (love the use of the surrounds for this film) and there are a good number of lengthy special features and two commentary tracks as well.""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is not a political film, nor does it try to be.  But there is a political message.  If anything, the film has an entertaining storyline that hooks people due to nostalgia and also serves as a goodbye to a belief one had to the past but also a goodbye as we know the mother, the inspiration of the ruse, does not have much time left in this world.  But also to see Alex reconstructing Germany that his mother can understand and possibly appreciate.Once again, I'm sure this film probably hits home to a lot of Germans and probably for those who lived in East Germany.  To see how consumerism and the changes in society came upon them quite quickly and it was a perspective of life that I have never really thought about until I watched this film.  So, I actually enjoyed the fresh storyline and enjoyed this film a lot.Overall, ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" is a very good film and Sony Pictures Classics really gave this film an awesome release on DVD back in 2003.  But hopefully the reconsider this film for a Blu-ray release in 2010/2011.  Definitely worth watching!",4,"Awesome film and a solid, well-rounded DVD with a good amount of lengthy special features.",1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,6362,"['2003', 'director', 'Wolfgang',

486824,A31WE0G828ZWY5,7040267373,Eric J. Lyman,"[3, 3]","Goodbye Lenin! is like a breath of fresh air -- the rare comedic farce that avoids Hollywood's addiction to formula, love story that sidesteps sentimentalism, and political commentary that isn't boring.The story line is wonderfully simple: a woman lapses into a coma in the former East Germany and when she awakes, the Berlin Wall had come down and the communist state she served has been dissolved.

It is all the more amazing to watch as a piece of history: the action takes place from immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall to its aftermath eight months later. The story is simple: an East German family has lost the head of the household for (apparently!) fleeing to West Germany for the love of another woman. The wife (Katrin Sass) is dumbstruck but survives and continues her activist activities as a Socialist/Communist, teaching children and workers the good points of being an East German Socialist. One evening her son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) takes part in a demonstration against the government's curfews and ends up being beaten by the police. The mother, seeing this happen, falls in the street having suffered a cardiac arrest. She is hospitalized, and is in a coma for eight months during which time her son Alex sits by her bedside, hopeful she will recover. During the coma, of course, the Berlin Wall falls, Germany is united, and socialism of the Cold War is over. When the mother awakens, Alex is told that her condition is delicate and she must be spared any shocks. To this end, Alex and his sister and friends the mother home, change the house to resemble the pre-Berlin Wall fall, effect bogus broadcasts to make the mother feel that the East German philosophy has triumphed and the West Germans are moving into the better socialistic climes of East Germany! How this charade plays out with all of the consequences of the good intentions of Alex ties the movie together. Far from being a preachy political satire or documentary, this tender movie is more about family bonds than anything else. The direction by Wolfgang Becker is superb, as is the acting by all involved. Watching this film will entertain you, inform you of critical historical events, and leave you with a lovely afterglow.

Initially, the ruse is seamless, but as time goes on, Alex must work harder and harder to narrow an ever-widening gap between the past and present.While the clever premise is irresistable and would seem the perfect vehicle for an ever-escalating farce, Becker takes a far more difficult (but ultimately more satisfying) route into a touching exploration of memory and the lives we create for ourselves and one other.The cast is uniformly strong, and the romance between Alex and Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse who cares for his mother, is sweet.

The high jinks that surround her re-emergence are worth every minute of the movie.Daniel Bruhl, who plays Alex, the son, is the chief ""overseer"" of his mother, played by Katrin Sass.

Slowly she begins to question the changes and in one scene, Mutter wanders outside of her apartment, undetected by Alex, to see for herself those unbelievable capitalist changes that have occurred.  Recaptured by Alex and his sister, Alex then plots, with the help of his video-making friend, to revamp the story to one that the East German government has let in thousands of West Germans who want to be rid of western goods and ideas.

On her way to receive an honor for her service to the German Democratic Republic, Mom witnesses her boy's apprehension and has a heart attack that thrusts her into a coma, which lasts until June 1990. By then, The Wall has effectively been breached, Western capitalism has invaded East Berlin with a vengeance, Christiane's teenage daughter Ariane (Maria Simon) has dropped out of the university to get a job at the new Burger King, where she's taken up with a &quot;Wessie&quot; (a West Berliner), and Alex has fallen for Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse from the USSR.After Alex insists that his mother be released for at-home convalescence, the doctor makes clear that any shock to the patient's system will likely kill her. Since Communism is all that Christiane has ever known, Alex contrives an elaborate scheme to shield his bed-ridden mother from all evidence of The Wall's collapse and the West's victory of materialism over her socialist world. What is she to think of that gigantic Coca-Cola advert hanging from the apartment building opposite her window?The improbable prospects for the con's success aside, GOOD BYE LENIN is a witty, clever, and sometimes poignant look at the wave of change which swept through East Berlin after the surprisingly sudden meltdown of Die Mauer, carrying forward the young and resilient with the flow, but leaving many bitter, old guard stranded in unfamiliar territory .Bruehl, resembling a young Christopher Reeve, is enormously engaging as the young man trying to do the right thing for his Mom, especially as it was his civil disobedience that catalyzed her physical debilitation in the first place. Christiane elicits much sympathy from the viewer. But she, too, has a secret that she's been keeping from her children for years.As a child of the Cold War era - born in 1949 - I gazed transfixed at the TV images in the closing weeks of 1989 as Die Mauer was danced upon and assaulted by raucous Berlin crowds from both the East and West. After all, I'd grown up with The Bomb, the Evil Empire, and Nikita's shoe-pounding at the U.N., and had myself navigated Checkpoint Charlie on a couple of occasions. GOOD BYE LENIN is a glimpse of The Wall's demise from the other side, and with a humorous twist. One only need visit the Berlin of today, pass through the once off-limits Brandenburg Gate, and walk down the Unter den Linden to witness the startling transformation enabled by that event.",4,F&uuml;r Mutter,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,2674,"['October', '1989', 'East', 'Berliner', 'Alex', 'Kerner', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'teenage', 'son', 'Communist', 'Party', 'stalwart', 'Christiane', 'Katrin', 'Sa', 'szlig', 'arrested', 'peaceful', 'demonstration', 'streets', 'approaching', 'Wall', 'way', 'receive', 'honor', 'service', 'German', 'Democratic', 'Republic', 'Mom', 'boy', 'apprehension', 'heart', 'attack', 'coma', 'June', '1990', 'then', 'Wall', 'effectively', 'been', 'breached', 'Western', 'capitalism', 'invaded', 'East', 'Berlin', 'vengeance', 'Christiane', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Ariane', 'Maria', 'Simon', 'dropped', 'university', 'get', 'job', 'new', 'Burger', 'King', 'where', 'taken', 'up', 'quot', 'Wessie', 'quot', 'West', 'Berliner', 'Alex', 'fallen', 'Lara', 'Chulpan', 'Khamatova', 'student', 'nurse', 'USSR.After', 'Alex', 'mother', 'be', 'released', 'at-home', 'convalescence', 'doctor', 'clear', 'shock', 'patient', 'system', 'will', 'likely', 'kill', 'Communism', 'Christiane', 'ever', 'known', 'Alex', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'shield', 'bed-ridden', 'mother', 'evidence', 'Wall', 'collapse', 'West', 'victory', 'materialism', 'socialist', 'world', 'What', 'think', 'gigantic', 'Coca-Cola', 'advert', 'hanging', 'apartment', 'building', 'window', 'improbable', 'prospects', 'con', 'success', 'aside', 'GOOD', 'BYE', 'LENIN', 'witty', 'clever', 'sometimes', 'poignant', 'look', 'wave', 'change', 'swept', 'East', 'Berlin', 'surprisingly', 'sudden', 'meltdown', 'Die', 'Mauer', 'carrying', 'forward', 'young', 'resilient', 'flow', 'leaving', 'many', 'bitter', 'old', 'guard', 'stranded', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', '.Bruehl', 'resembling', 'young', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'enormously', 'engaging', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Mom', 'especially', 'was', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'catalyzed', 'physical', 'debilitation', 'first', 'place', 'Christiane', 'much', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'too', 'secret', 'been', 'keeping', 'children', 'years.As', 'child', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'born', '1949', 'gazed', 'transfixed', 'TV', 'images', 'closing', 'weeks', '1989', 'Die', 'Mauer', 'was', 'danced', 'assaulted', 'raucous', 'Berlin', 'crowds', 'East', 'West', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'Bomb', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'Nikita', 'shoe-pounding', 'U.N.', 'had', 'navigated', 'Checkpoint', 'Charlie', 'couple', 'occasions', 'GOOD', 'BYE', 'LENIN', 'glimpse', 'Wall', 'demise', 'other', 'side', 'humorous', 'twist', 'One', 'only', 'need', 'Berlin', 'today', 'pass', 'once', 'off-limits', 'Brandenburg', 'Gate', 'walk', 'Unter', 'den', 'Linden', 'witness', 'startling', 'transformation', 'enabled', 'event']",N/A

When Alex is released from prison and finds out that his mother is in a coma and while she is in this coma the Berlin Wall falls.  Germany unites at the same time as Coca Cola, MacDonalds, and other western multinational companies enter the former DDR.  It is a tough time for the people of the former DDR as they are forced into deflation of currency, unemployment, and poverty.  The world as Alex's mother once knew is suddenly gone when she miraculously awakened from her coma.  An unqualified doctor that has remained within the former DDR informs Alex that his mother could die from sudden shock.The mothers condition leads the film into a comical, yet serious roller coaster where good intentions, fear, and love drive Alex's decisions.  The decisions that Alex makes brings to the film a nostalgia of the former DDR's good intentions in politics as well as Alex's own vision of utopia.  The utopia that Alex creates is based on equality, fairness, and goodness without Stasi, the former secret police in DDR that functioned by having one informant per 100 citizens.  Alex even fabricates the idea that Coca Cola is an invention by the DDR in order to protect his mother's health.Good Bye Lenin! is a warm film with the notion of a better world projected in order to save one person.  This idea is noble and it works very well as it brings the audience a sincere idea of utopia.

He has also played in ""Ladies in Lavender"" with Maggie Smith & Judy Dench and ""The Borne Ultimatum.""  The European Film Academy named him Best Actor for ""Goodbye Lenin"".  He does an excellent job as the young man shouldering responsibility long before he's ready.Katrin Sass plays his mother Christiane.  As an actress, she won the Silver Bear Best Actress award from the Berlin International Film Festival in 1982 for ""Burgschaft ein Jahr"" and won the James People's Choice Award as Best Actress for this film.  Sass turns in an excellent performance in the greatly varied role from political activist to invalid.The story of the film revolves around the family whose father has apparently left them.  The mother raises her children in East Germany.  She is quite attached to her country and suffers a heart attack as she watches her son at a protest rally.  Falling into a coma, she awakes 8 months later to a reunified Germany where the wall has fallen.  However, since her heart is very fragile, Alex concocts a huge fantasy to keep from his mother the fact that Germany has changed because he fears it would be too great a shock.  This results in all sorts of hilarious antics such as searching for East German pickle jars and telling his mother that thousands of West Germans have been scaling the walls to get into East Germany and escape capitalism.Chulpan Khametova plays his sister Lara who is busy having babies with her boyfriend Rainer played by Alexander Beyer.  There is a hilarious scene where Beyer bears all as he tries to fix window blinds before bothering to dress.  Meanwhile Alex falls for Ariane played by Maria Simon who appeared in the filmLuther.  Alex enlists his coworker Denis to help fake news broadcasts so they can play the tapes on his mother's TV.  Florian Lukus as Denis is a stitch, wearing fake moustaches and pretending to be a TV news anchorman.  Lukas won the Best Supporting Actor from the German Film Awards for his role.

486847,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,7040267373,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 6]","This 2003 German import has an intriguing story line.  It's set in East Berlin in 1990, at the time of the fall of the Berlin wall.  A young man and his sister have been raised by their mother who truly believes in the socialist ideal.  She has a heart attack and is in a coma for 8 months.  When she awakes, the world has changed.  Her beloved East Germany is no more and there is a rapid influx of western influences.  However, since the doctors say that the mother has to remain calm, the brother and sister decide to make believe that these changes didn't happen.  And, along with a friend who makes videotapes, they contrive to keep the mother believing that nothing has changed.This is an allegory, of course.  And at first it seems very funny.  But the film is a full two hours long, and the joke soon fades.  I found myself looking at the clock and wishing the story would move faster.  Soon it all turns into a soap opera.  Even when the mother tells a long, suppressed truth of her own, the deception never ceases.  The acting was good and I liked the theme though.  And I also liked being picked up and put down in the middle of an historic year in this very special place.  I learned a bit about socialism and the way of life under that regime.  In that sense I did enjoy the film.There was a good extra on the DVD too, in which the filmmakers very carefully explained all the technical effects.  As the film was recently shot, they had had to use computer animation to make it look like 1990.

Situated in the turmoil of a major historical event as the unification of Germany, it gives the viewer a deep insight on how social & political changes affect individual subjects.The film has a comedic tonality, but do not let that deceive you; the main core is an acute inquiry on social, family and personal issues.The plot is as follows: Mother (an excellent and shrewd Katrin Sa&szlig;) is an East German housewife whose husband, an eminent physician, deserts to the West living her with her two little kids. She suffers a nervous break down and remains six month in psychiatric clinic. When she recovers she launches herself into a communist militant life.On one special celebration night, Mother sees his young son Alex (Daniel Br&uuml;lh), arrested during an anti-government demonstration and suffers a brain attack that leaves her unconscious for eight months. These months are critical for Germany. The communist regime goes down and the reunification is a reality. When she regains consciousness the doctors tell Alex she must remain in the hospital, because any emotional alteration may be fatal.Notwithstanding Alex decide to bring his mother back home. But home has changed adapting to new times: new furniture, new kitchen tools, new... everything. Alex & his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) dismantle all and reconstruct the ""old home"". Mother is installed in her bedroom and Alex with the help of his friends ""create"" for her a virtual pre-change ""reality"". Alex's efforts to mend ""reality intrusion"" give way to incredible funny situations.On this backdrop many interesting questions arises: What is reality? Were changes beneficial to ordinary people?  Could the mass media alter our perception of what's going on? Each viewer will have his own answers. The film is undoubtedly a thought provoking one.Love at the interior of a family nucleus, shows up as a healing tool of great power.A very moving film to enjoy & discuss!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Misleading Her Mother!,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,2029,"['Good', 'Bye', 'Lenin', '2003', 'great', 'film', 'transcend', 'anecdote', 'Situated', 'turmoil', 'major', 'historical', 'event', 'unification', 'Germany', 'viewer', 'deep', 'insight', 'how', 'social', 'political', 'changes', 'affect', 'individual', 'subjects.The', 'film', 'comedic', 'tonality', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'deceive', 'main', 'core', 'acute', 'inquiry', 'social', 'family', 'personal', 'issues.The', 'plot', 'Mother', 'excellent', 'shrewd', 'Katrin', 'Sa', 'szlig', 'East', 'German', 'housewife', 'husband', 'eminent', 'physician', 'West', 'living', 'two', 'little', 'kids', 'nervous', 'break', 'down', 'six', 'month', 'psychiatric', 'clinic', 'When', 'communist', 'militant', 'one', 'special', 'celebration', 'night', 'Mother', 'young', 'son', 'Alex', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'arrested', 'anti-government', 'demonstration', 'suffers', 'brain', 'attack', 'unconscious', 'eight', 'months', 'months', 'are', 'critical', 'Germany', 'communist', 'regime', 'down', 'reunification', 'reality', 'When', 'consciousness', 'doctors', 'tell', 'Alex', 'must', 'remain', 'hospital', 'emotional', 'alteration', 'may', 'be', 'fatal.Notwithstanding', 'Alex', 'decide', 'bring', 'mother', 'back', 'home', 'home', 'changed', 'adapting', 'new', 'times', 'new', 'furniture', 'new', 'kitchen', 'tools', 'new', 'everything', 'Alex', 'sister', 'Ariane', 'Maria', 'Simon', 'dismantle', 'reconstruct', 'old', 'home', 'Mother', 'installed', 'bedroom', 'Alex', 'help', 'friends', 'create', 'virtual', 'pre-change', 'reality', 'Alex', 'efforts', 'mend', 'reality', 'intrusion', 'give', 'way', 'incredible', 'funny', 'situations.On', 'backdrop', 'many', 'interesting', 'questions', 'arises', 'What', 'reality', 'Were', 'beneficial', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Could', 'mass', 'media', 'alter', 'perception', 'what', 'going', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'answers', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'one.Love', 'interior', 'family', 'nucleus', 'up', 'healing', 'tool', 'great', 'power.A', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'enjoy', 'discuss', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

Burns,"[4, 4]","If you're a sucker for the ethereal, transcendent music of Yann Tiersen (Amelie), then you'll be drooling within the first minute of this warm, endearing import that sidesteps a few minor issues to be a sweet look at family, dedication, and Socialism. Daniel Bruhl stars as Alex Kerner, a young man (19ish) who had lived under the Socialist uprising within Germany, pre-Wall falling. The reason: his mother was a hardcore comrade, and right before Socialism dies, she falls into a coma and wakes up after Democracy has set in. The problem: she can't have any huge emotional trauma or she'll croak. So the stage is set for an often-hilarious little farce that guides the movie through plenty of physical comedy, wild setups, but an unfortunately long third act that could have used some trimming. I doth protest too much - Lenin is a sweet film that is much a silly farce as a look at the lengths a son will go to save his mother and an examination of post-dissolution Germany. The movie seems like it's all mapped out in the beginning, but by the nostalgic finale, it has gone in some unexpected places and developed characters that seem insignificant at first (especially an early subplot of Alex having the hots for a nurse, whom he soon dates - a refreshing twist for once). It's the kind of movie, much like Amelie, that will have you walking out of the theater smiling and forgetting its shortcomings. If a third-act subplot of a long-lost father had been excised from the movie, I'd be going nuts about it. As is, I'm still elated from seeing this enjoyable foreign film.

Crammer,"[4, 4]","This German movie may have elements that Americans miss, but the underlying story is universal -- what a young man who loves his mother will do.  The film is set in East Berlin and begins right before the reunification (the destruction of the Berlin Wall).  The young man (Alex) has a mother who is a faithful Communist Party member who was abandoned by their father, who left for the West.  After she has a heart attack that leaves her in a coma for months before finally regaining consciousness, he wants to take her home to care of her.  The doctors warn him that any shock could kill her, and he thinks that hearing about the collapse of communism in Germany might do it.  So he brings her home and sets about creating an environment for her in which East and West Germany are still separate.  Even though she's bedridden, it's not easy.  He insists that the radio is broken but she wants to watch TV, so he has to create news broadcasts for her to go in with the videotapes they are using to simulate television.  She wants her favorite brand of East German pickles -- no longer available.  He jumps through all kinds of hoops keeping up this charade despite the pleas of his sister and his girlfriend to tell his mother the truth.Obviously a lot of this movie is about the politics of Germany -- and it raises some questions about what constitutes the good life.  Is it free access to Coca-Cola or is a less stressful life better?My only criticism would be that the movie is perhaps a bit long.

We watch a family, in the opening credits, in which the father has escaped to the West, leaving behind his wife, and two kids.  Alex, the son, is the character who tells the story and we watch as the mother, broken and in pain from her husband dumping them, embraces socialism to the point where she is totally loyal to its ideals.In 1989 she has a heart attack, falls into a coma, and misses the most important eight months in world history.  The fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of communism, frankly everything she believes in dies a swift, total death.  Then she comes out of the coma and her son is warned by the doctor that ANY shock might bring another heart attack.  Any shock.  So her son has to make her think that NOTHING has changed.The film is one of the funniest Non-English flicks I have EVER seen.  The son has to find food she likes (that no longer exists), has to set up the TV with a VCR so she only watches shows from before the collapse and even has to organize her birthday with people who know that they have to pretend that history hasn't passed her by.  Yet it has a serious underlining message about the importance of family that is touching (and sad at the same time) and I think a slight poke at materialism.  Coca-Cola must have paid millions to get its name in so many scenes!But Alex is not the only one making up lies.  The mother has woven some lies of her own which end up coming out.

Moore,"[2, 2]","I like movies that take me to faraway places, and Wolfgang Becker's ""Good bye, Lenin!"" takes us to a place few Americans can even conceive of: East Germany just before and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For those of us raised in Cold War hysteria, it's instructive to see a portrayal of an average East German family, whose patriotism toward their Communist government was motivated by simple idealism, not by diabolical terrorism. ""Good bye, Lenin!"" focuses on Christiane, a teacher and youth counselor in East Berlin who suffers a massive heart attack. The end of Communism and the tearing down of the Wall occur during her eight-month coma, and when she wakes, her doctor warns her son Alex that any severe shock will kill her. Thereafter, Alex moves heaven and earth to ensure Christiane never finds out that the Socialist experiment she adored is no more. This obviously is easier said than done: how does Alex explain to Mom the Coca-Cola banner outside her bedroom window? Or find the old East German food brands and newscasts Mom expects to see? Or hide the fact that his sister Ariane now works at a Burger King? The film's farcical elements are not ignored, but it's to Becker's credit that the farce isn't all there is to ""Good bye, Lenin!"" He makes some tart observations about the brutality of the Communist system and the vulgarity of the consumer culture that replaced it. Even more, he emphasizes the drama within the family--particularly when Christiane drops a bombshell secret of her own. More poignant than funny overall, ""Good bye, Lenin!"" is at its best when it emphasizes the deep love between mother and son, their common traits and their deep desire to protect each other. Politics may have shaped their lives, but love is all that matters in the end. The German cast--none of whose members was previously familiar to me--is splendid, particularly the actors who play Christiane and Alex: Katrin Sass, an actress of the most refined mature beauty, and Daniel Bruhl, Germany's answer to (and improvement on) Ashton Kutcher.

Veiluva ""sputnik99""","[11, 12]","""Godbye Lenin"" was one of the best foreign films released in 2004, which combined a love story and farce against the backdrop of the last days of the German Democratic Republic.  The plot is ingenious: to prevent his frail mother, a mid-level loyal appratchika, from suffering a second and fatal heart attack, her son must create a historical ""bubble"" in her appartment to keep her convinced that the Communist regime is alive and well, and the universe has not changed.The fantasy world created by her son reflects the actual paper-mache universe that was East Germany.  The Wall must stay up; dumpsters must be scoured for old food cans with the right labels, and mediocre laminate furniture recovered.  His job is made more difficult as the real world and its billboards inevitably intrude, to which he and a friend respond by taping fake talking-head broadcasts which look like the real dull as bricks productions.  I had always suspected that Coca Cola was invented in the GDR and stolen by the West....Some have unfairly criticised this movie by being too ""soft"" on the East German regime, and in its sympathetic portrayal of the mother as a loyal adherent to the system.  That was not the point of this movie.  Waking up on a November 2000 morning to find that Bush, and not Gore, was declared president was significant enough; the millions who saw the Wall collapse and have their entire society change must have been thousands of times more traumatic.  Many, many people who were not ideologues still had a stake in the old system, such as university professors, teachers, and factory workers.  Their world, like that of the East German astronaut, was turned upside down without any fault of their own.

This curiosity led to my checking out books on the topic and reading about it, and being called a ""commie"" by my fellow Americans, as if curiosity about someone our government tells us is ""our enemy"" makes me one of them!I was thrilled when I read a movie like this had come out, showing life in the last days of East Germany and the euphoria of a new world opening up for people who pretty much lived in a prison all their lives.  Of course, the initial rush of euphoria in newfound freedom left a harsh wake up call as differences in work ethics, standards of living, and cultural references became more and more apparent after reunification of the two Germanys.  In personal terms, think of what it would be like if separated twins discovered each other late in life...one a Wall Street stockbroker, the other a trailer park living low wage slave.  A clash in more ways than one, right?The performances of Daniel Bruhl as the idealistic son and of Katrin Sass as the mother who always believed in Marxism, both performances really stand out and are Oscar-worthy.  The lengths the son goes to, to prevent his mother from falling into another coma over the shock of the demise of East Germany provides much of the humor.  My favorite scene is when the mother, tired of being cooped up in the bedroom, decides to go for a walk outside and its like walking through Wonderland for her.  The look of complete bafflement on her face as she watches a statue of Lenin fly through the air, in a salutatory departure, is pure joy to watch.  Just her look alone perfectly conveys the confusion of a world being turned upside down.This film addresses the issue of ""Ostalgie"" that has gripped some former East Germans in the late 1990s as they have found that the materialism of the West hasn't replaced a sense of community for them.  Under the iron fisted rule of Honecker, they might not have had much, but they suffered together and had a genuine sense of community...although any one of their neighbors could have turned them in to the state for any number of ""violations.""  Watching this film, one can see the draw of culture on a person and the void left behind when the culture is stripped away or proven false.  Does longing for the familiar products of one's youth actually mean a desire to return to the way things were?  I don't think so...but culture is something we'll always carry with us.  It's who we are.The brilliance of this film for me, is that we get to look at East Germans as people with no control over their form of government.  In America, we were taught that the Russians and Eastern Europeans were our ""enemies"" and a lot of people bought into it.  But in reality, they are people just like us.  People who believe their government over a foreign government they're not familiar with.  Are we any different?  I like that this film shows an idealistic young East German and his yearning for freedom, idolizing a Cosmonaut, and who loves his mother so much that he dares not tell her the truth about what happened to their country since she fell into and out of a coma.  This deception strains his relations with his sister, but provides much humorous situations before reaching a satisfying conclusion.  I have no complaints about this film.  It's flawless and brilliant.  The acting and humor are first rate and Oscar-worthy.  I would rate ""Goodbye Lenin!"" as the best film I've seen so far in 2004.",5,Best Film of 2004!,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,3731,"['Finally', 'film', 'satisfied', 'lifelong', 'curiosity', ""'ve"", 'had', 'people', 'age', 'who', 'lived', 'other', 'side', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'elementary', 'school', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'unfortunate', 'be', 'born', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'East', 'Germany', 'two', 'harshest', 'communist', 'states', 'curiosity', 'led', 'checking', 'out', 'books', 'topic', 'reading', 'being', 'called', 'commie', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'curiosity', 'someone', 'government', 'tells', 'enemy', 'one', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'read', 'movie', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'showing', 'life', 'last', 'days', 'East', 'Germany', 'euphoria', 'new', 'world', 'opening', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'lived', 'prison', 'lives', 'course', 'initial', 'rush', 'euphoria', 'newfound', 'freedom', 'left', 'harsh', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'differences', 'work', 'ethics', 'standards', 'living', 'cultural', 'references', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'reunification', 'two', 'Germanys', 'personal', 'terms', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'separated', 'twins', 'discovered', 'other', 'late', 'life', 'one', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stockbroker', 'other', 'trailer', 'park', 'living', 'low', 'wage', 'slave', 'clash', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'right', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'idealistic', 'son', 'Katrin', 'Sass', 'mother', 'who', 'always', 'believed', 'Marxism', 'performances', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Oscar-worthy', 'lengths', 'son', 'prevent', 'mother', 'falling', 'coma', 'shock', 'demise', 'East', 'Germany', 'much', 'humor', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'mother', 'tired', 'being', 'cooped', 'up', 'bedroom', 'go', 'walk', 'walking', 'Wonderland', 'look', 'complete', 'bafflement', 'face', 'statue', 'Lenin', 'fly', 'air', 'salutatory', 'departure', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'Just', 'look', 'alone', 'perfectly', 'confusion', 'world', 'being', 'turned', 'down.This', 'film', 'issue', 'Ostalgie', 'gripped', 'former', 'East', 'Germans', 'late', '1990s', 'have', 'found', 'materialism', 'West', ""n't"", 'replaced', 'sense', 'community', 'iron', 'fisted', 'rule', 'Honecker', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'suffered', 'together', 'had', 'genuine', 'sense', 'community', 'one', 'neighbors', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'state', 'number', 'violations', 'Watching', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'draw', 'culture', 'person', 'void', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'culture', 'stripped', 'away', 'proven', 'false', 'longing', 'familiar', 'products', 'one', 'youth', 'actually', 'mean', 'desire', 'return', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'culture', 'something', ""'ll"", 'always', 'carry', 'who', 'are.The', 'brilliance', 'film', 'get', 'look', 'East', 'Germans', 'people', 'control', 'form', 'government', 'America', 'were', 'taught', 'Russians', 'Eastern', 'Europeans', 'were', 'enemies', 'lot', 'people', 'bought', 'reality', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'People', 'who', 'believe', 'government', 'foreign', 'government', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Are', 'different', 'like', 'film', 'idealistic', 'young', 'East', 'German', 'yearning', 'freedom', 'idolizing', 'Cosmonaut', 'who', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'country', 'fell', 'coma', 'deception', 'relations', 'sister', 'much', 'humorous', 'situations', 'reaching', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'have', 'complaints', 'film', 'flawless', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'humor', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Oscar-worthy', 'would', 'rate', 'Goodbye', 'Lenin', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', '2004']",N/A

On her insistence, we watched it and I was very pleasantly surprized - here is a comedy, at turns political and personal, but always with an edge of realism and irony.  If you are interested in the personal side of reunification, this is also very good evocation and provides food for discussion, also very good for learning.The story is about a broken East German family:  the father went to the West and disappeared, leaving his wife and two children in the East.  The mother had a nervous breakdown, coming out of it gradually to become a leader.  During the upheaval 10 years later, she has a heart attack and falls into a coma, just when E Germany collapses.  When she wakes up, to avoid life-threatening trauma, they don't tell her about the reunification and go to increasingly absurd lengths to hide it from her.  A lot of this is funny, but after a while it becomes a terrible strain.  As life goes on, they work to resolve many issues, all the time struggling in the new society under development.

Zwick,"[4, 6]","Just as Rip Van Winkle slept through the American Revolution and woke up twenty years later to find himself a citizen of a brand new country, so Kathrin Sass, an East German woman, slips into a coma on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall only to wake up eight months later a member of a capitalist society.  This is the premise of ""Good Bye Lenin,"" a clever and affectionate tale about truth, love and family ties that transcends all national borders and boundaries.Kathrin, a woman who has dedicated her life to the perpetuation of Communist Party ideology, suffers a major heart attack that plunges her into a comatose state a few months prior to the dissolution of the land she knows as East Germany.  While she is ""asleep,"" governments tumble, barriers crumble and a whole new tide of Western goods and values comes flooding eastwards to a ravenous, eagerly awaiting public.  Then she wakes up.  Fearing that the shock of finding such a radically changed world will lead to a second heart attack, her loving son, Alex, devises an elaborate scheme to shield her from the truth and to make her believe that the world she lives in now is the same world she knew eight months before (the basic premise is not that different from the one in ""Jacob the Liar"").""Good Bye Lenin!"" is an amusing regional comedy that derives its laughs from two basic sources: the near-slapstick nature of the charade Alex is attempting to perpetrate, and the script's satirical view of a society rushing madly to embrace the joys of unbridled consumerism they have been so long denied.  Given its gimmicky premise, ""Good Bye Lenin!"" could have emerged as a one-joke comedy were it not for the fine sense of irony and absurdity that writer/director Wolfgang Becker (working with co-writer Bernd Lichtenberg) has brought to the project.  In addition, young Daniel Bruhl as Alex and Katrin Sab as Kathrin deliver expert, moving performances that go to the very essence of the mother/child relationship.I must confess that this film, despite its generally upbeat tone, brings with it a certain rueful sadness that the filmmakers may not exactly have intended.  Could it really have been a mere fifteen years ago that the events depicted in this film actually happened - a mere fifteen years ago that the future of the human race seemed so full of joy, hope and promise?  Now, in a post 9/11 world - where sectarian hatred and international terrorism rule the day - this image of people coming together to cast off the shackles of bondage and embrace freedom seems already like a quaint memory from the long distant past.  In a strange way, the film has become something of a relic in its own time, outstripped by a world that has long since moved on to bigger and more dire concerns.

To write a farce-melodrama that's also about the impact of reunification on life in the former GDR is a bit more than this 2-hour film can bring off well for someone from somewhere else. There are moments of inspired brilliance, especially the home-made TV news broadcasts created to perpetuate the ruse that the GDR is not only still intact but has become the refuge of thousands fleeing the West. And that idea works on more than one level. It's a sitcom contrivance that also resonates with social and political significance, given the use of ""news"" to shape public opinion by portraying anything as something other than what it is, no matter how far-fetched.Finally there are too many ideas in the movie, which is not always a criticism I'd make, but when they operate on different levels of credibility, it's hard to know how much disbelief to suspend in some scenes. Irony may be the surer ground for working out narrative conflicts like this, but the film loses its footing when it has trouble being serious and comic at the same time. And as another reviewer has pointed out, the excesses of the GDR are an unacknowledged shadow in the background that complicates the more light-hearted intentions of the film.

486863,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,7040267373,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 5]","If nothing else, this is easily the sweetest film ever made about life in the DDR before and after the Berlin Wall came down. Katarin Sass is a heartily loyal party member in 1980's East Germany. A true believer, she rules a family of premature adults - forced to mature when their father fled to the West, never to be heard from again. There are signs of tension between children and mom, but her loyalty to the state provides a safety valve - they can attack her through devotion to the state and obviate more direct lines of assault. As the 80's draw to a close, the GDR's governing regime is already out of steam, and soons grinds to a halt. Seeing one of her kids assaulted during a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, Mom has a stroke and falls into a coma.When she awakes, the Wall has fallen, and her Socialist Police State is no more.  However, the demise of the GDR is a secret kept from her by kids desperate to avoid precipitating another stroke. Instead, with the help of friends, her family manufactures a fantasy in which the GDR is not only still around but (to explain all the reunification hype) the victor of the cold war. (The conspirators create phony news reports using footage of people streaming across the wall - apparently *from* the west, rather than desperately lunging towards it as we'd been led to believe; the formula for Coca-Cola was apparently developed in East Germany.) The effects are actually quite funny - especially when one realizes that the kids have to enlist an ever wider circle to maintain their illusion, making the fantasy GDR more of people's revolution than the ""real"" one it replaced. However as the mirage is prolonged - against all odds - the family finds that it must confront the inner demons that GDR deprivation and oppression had bottled up.""Goodbye Lenin"" isn't apologia for the East any more than a praise for the triumph of the west. The leads react perfectly with that European deadpan set against the great political upheaval of the early 1990's.  It's a bitingly funny and bittersweet exploration of how common people use political dogma to keep from having to construct real lives and, in this case, have to create fake lives when their dogmas prove illusory.",4,The Revolution will be Televised,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2228,"['nothing', 'else', 'easily', 'sweetest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'life', 'DDR', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'came', 'down', 'Katarin', 'Sass', 'heartily', 'loyal', 'party', 'member', '1980', 'East', 'Germany', 'A', 'true', 'believer', 'rules', 'family', 'premature', 'adults', 'forced', 'mature', 'when', 'father', 'fled', 'West', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'are', 'signs', 'tension', 'children', 'mom', 'loyalty', 'state', 'safety', 'valve', 'can', 'attack', 'devotion', 'state', 'obviate', 'more', 'direct', 'lines', 'assault', '80', 'draw', 'close', 'GDR', 'governing', 'regime', 'already', 'steam', 'soons', 'grinds', 'halt', 'Seeing', 'one', 'kids', 'assaulted', 'crackdown', 'pro-democracy', 'protesters', 'Mom', 'stroke', 'coma.When', 'Wall', 'fallen', 'Socialist', 'Police', 'State', 'more', 'However', 'demise', 'GDR', 'secret', 'kept', 'kids', 'desperate', 'avoid', 'precipitating', 'stroke', 'Instead', 'help', 'friends', 'family', 'fantasy', 'GDR', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'explain', 'reunification', 'hype', 'victor', 'cold', 'war', 'conspirators', 'create', 'phony', 'news', 'reports', 'using', 'footage', 'people', 'streaming', 'wall', 'apparently', 'west', 'rather', 'desperately', 'lunging', 'towards', ""'d"", 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'formula', 'Coca-Cola', 'was', 'apparently', 'developed', 'East', 'Germany', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'kids', 'have', 'enlist', 'ever', 'wider', 'circle', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'making', 'fantasy', 'GDR', 'more', 'people', 'revolution', 'real', 'one', 'replaced', 'However', 'mirage', 'prolonged', 'odds', 'family', 'must', 'confront', 'inner', 'demons', 'GDR', 'deprivation', 'oppression', 'had', 'bottled', 'up', 'Goodbye', 'Lenin', ""n't"", 'apologia', 'East', 'more', 'praise', 'triumph', 'west', 'leads', 'react', 'perfectly', 'European', 'deadpan', 'set', 'great', 'political', 'upheaval', 'early', '1990', 'bitingly', 'funny', 'bittersweet', 'exploration', 'how', 'common', 'people', 'use', 'political', 'dogma', 'keep', 'having', 'construct', 'real', 'lives', 'case', 'have', 'create', 'fake', 'lives', 'when', 'dogmas', 'illusory']",N/A

There is little doubt that this awareness will shock and amaze you. It is exactly this situation that Alex Kerner desires to avoid. After his mother, Hanna, suffers from a heart attack and slips into a coma for eight months the doctors warned her family to avoid any stressful events that can injure her recovery. The problem is that Hanna is a devout believer of the socialist government of East Germany and while she was in her coma the Berlin Wall came down and the two Germanys reunited. Confident that the news will cause harm to his mother Alex is determined that his mother remain ignorant of the obvious changes that dominate East Berlin. As a result he develops some brilliant and resourceful schemes to make his mother believe that time hasn't changed such as filming his own news programs and changing the labels on the food jars. GOOD BYE, LENIN! is a funny yet poignant film that is sure to delight and entertain. Although there are many laugh-out-loud moments included there are also underlying issues and concerns that are on a more serious note. As the plot develops each member of the Kerner family realizes that their particular sense of reality is not as they believe. This particular family has been through a lot emotionally and psychologically, and I felt inspired watching their dramas unfold. The acting was superb, the plot was entertaining, and I walked away with a new perspective of this socio-political event and life in general.

In this charming story, we learn not all the DDR's residents resisted socialism.  Nor was reunification an unmodified blessing for all.  A half-century of Western propaganda's view of the East has blinded us to such people as Christiane Kerner.  Abandoned by her husband, who's fled to the West, she ""marries"" the socialist state, becoming a dedicated worker.  Seeing her son pummeled by Stasi agents during a demonstration, Christiane suffers a heart attack, lapsing into a coma.  Alexander, as devoted to her as she is to socialism, strives to assist her survival.  The surrounding world strives to defeat him.Honecker's DDR is collapsing around the family leaving Alexander with the task of trying to restore the past.  His mother's survival, when she awakens, depends on his success.  As the ""man of the family"" he struggles to keep his sister, her boyfriend, his own new girlfriend and his mother's colleagues on stage in his bizarre scenario.  Food jars are re-labelled, TV news is contrived and the new world of ""freedom"" is kept away.  However, the pressure of Coca Cola and Burger King is strong - and Alexander must cope with them all.Ironies abound in this stunning presentation of ""the other side"".  Alexander describes the DDR military as ""the world's last great shooting club"".  A demonstration becomes people ""getting together for a little exercise"".  Christiane's dedication, which has nothing to do with politics or philosophy, is intense, but not absolute.  She hungers for what she already has, but remains unfulfilled.  Socialism isn't perfect - she streams complaint letters to the authorities.  Her ""marriage"" to the ideal is reminiscent of Christian nuns.  Will she die ""in the Faith"" as so many others have done?  Becker uses this and other images masterfully.  The red banners of the DDR merge deftly those of Coca Cola, Germany's most recent invader.Becker's imagery and dialogue presentation is vivid and subtle at once.  He uses his characters brilliantly - Hitchcock would approve, even if there's no mystery to unveil.  With a contrasting mix of slow and fast action, Becker depicts the upheavals surrounding the collapse of German socialism with stunning clarity.  As the Special Features reveal, this film was cut by a third and the missing scenes are tantalising.  An film worthy of all its awards and attention.  Watch it and see ""the other side"" as it was.

It is told through the perspective of Alex Kerner (played by Daniel Bruhn) who tells the story of his mother (Kathryn Sass), a loyal member of the Communist party who is abandoned by her husband and has to raise her children alone. The mother has had some difficulties in the past and the children become very protective of her, especially Alex. Like many young people, Alex is involved in protests against the oppressive East German regime and when his mother witnesses his arrest, she has a heart attack and is comatose for eight months. She misses the major historic upheavals, including the fall of the Berlin Wall. When she awakens, her doctor recommends a no stress lifestyle and her children decide that the best way for this to happen is to make it as if the Berlin Wall never fell, and try to create a mini communist nation in the family's apartment. The antics of Alex provide for humorous situations. He quickly becomes westernized but reverts to former ways when he is at home. He and a friend devise ways to rebroadcast old news stories and slowly brace the mother for the changes. While clever humor is found throughout the film, it never becomes silly, a credit to skillful writing. We also see the bonds of love between the Kerner family, particularly mother and son, and get a glimpse of the heart wrenching decisions people had to make during the bleak years of Communist rule in a divided Germany.Critics can say that the film is implausible at best, yet the combination of the acting and writing, as well as the lighting and atmosphere of the film make it entirely believable.

Since the pace of change to Western values and fashions has been so rapid that means finding their apartment's long discarded drab furniture, seeking out now discontinued East German brands of pickles and coffee and even faking DDR news reports with his fellow satellite TV installer as he tries to recreate the old East Germany within the borders of his mother's bedroom (not so easy with Coca Cola setting up shop just across the road), in the process gradually creating the more reasonable DDR he wished had existed. The laughs are there but less frequent than you'd expect, and often underlined with the sadness of a country suddenly forced to confront years of deprivation and betrayal: his sister's revelation of the first words their long-absent father spoke to her is initially funny but genuinely tragic on reflection, and the film manages to pull off both reactions without over-milking them.

Now, Alex is an ordinary boy living in East Germany with his sister and mother.  Just before the big social changes happen, however, Alex's mother collapses because of heart attack and is hospitalized in coma.Luckily, she wakes up again after eight months, but the dcotor warns that any shock could be fatal to her condition.  The problem is, she was a devoted member of the former regime (which is rapidly going) and the products from the West are rushing into the place where Alex and his mom are living.  In short, a red Coca Cola logo could kill her instantly.So Alex starts to lie before his mother, pretending that the former commune is still healthily going on, even faking up the news reports on TV (with a help from his friend who wants to be a film director).  But can Alex keep on this pace forever before the huge social changes that would sweep up the whole nation?The premises are slightly contrived, I admit, but the film works well because of the credible portraits of the mother and the son.  The actors are doing exceptional jobs, especially Daniel Bruhl playing Alex, whose ideas of ""for the sake of mother"" goes beyond the normal territory, but who remains still a likable and charming fellow all through the film.  Katrin Sass who plays his mother is also great, whose fragile portraits of the mother easily convince us of the reason her son should care for her so much.Another strength is the charming music by acclaimed musician Yann Tiersen, whose name might be remembered as the one behind the lovely score of lovely French film called ""Amelie.""There are lots of funny scenes in the film, but the sad tone is always felt behind the hilarious moments.  And that is right when we come to realize that after all this is a story about a mother and her son, and the understanding between them, as the surprising ending suggests to us.

486873,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,7040267373,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[6, 7]","'Goodbye, Lenin!' is wonderful social satire and refreshingly unique, telling a story of a woman, Christiane (Katrin Sa&szlig;), who loses her husband to adultery and politics, finds solace in her East German party, but collapses into a coma mid-heart attack after seeing her son attacked by East German troops amidst a demonstration gone wrong. The bulk of the film centers around not the mother, but her son Alex (played compellingly by Daniel Br&uuml;hl). It is the year 1989, and throughout his mother's coma he has seen her life collapse into West Germany as the Wall falls and capitalism takes over. In an endearingly witty sequence, we also see him transform into a loving, mature man as he takes care of her and falls in love with her nurse. When his mother wakes, the doctors inform him of her weak heart: she must not be distressed or excited, lest she have another heart attack, this time fatal. He fears the changes may dangerously provoke her, so he takes her home, hides her from the world, and goes the extra mile to turn their apartment (and her old friends) back in time to East Germany before the fall of Communism. This is an interesting premise, and thanks to fine writing, acting, and direction, the gimmick does not get old, but only more interesting. And though it loses its focus toward the very end and begins to stretch further than it needs to, the film as a whole is so thoughtfully made that its end does not become less moving as a result, but remains memorable and innovative, much like its first two thirds.",4,"Entertaining, smart, sweet: highly recommended",1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,1539,"[""'Goodbye"", 'Lenin', 'wonderful', 'social', 'satire', 'refreshingly', 'unique', 'telling', 'story', 'woman', 'Christiane', 'Katrin', 'Sa', 'szlig', 'who', 'husband', 'adultery', 'politics', 'solace', 'East', 'German', 'party', 'coma', 'mid-heart', 'attack', 'seeing', 'son', 'attacked', 'East', 'German', 'troops', 'amidst', 'demonstration', 'gone', 'wrong', 'bulk', 'film', 'centers', 'not', 'mother', 'son', 'Alex', 'played', 'compellingly', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'year', '1989', 'mother', 'coma', 'seen', 'life', 'collapse', 'West', 'Germany', 'Wall', 'falls', 'capitalism', 'over', 'endearingly', 'witty', 'sequence', 'also', 'see', 'transform', 'loving', 'mature', 'man', 'care', 'love', 'nurse', 'When', 'mother', 'wakes', 'doctors', 'inform', 'weak', 'heart', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'distressed', 'excited', 'lest', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'time', 'fatal', 'changes', 'may', 'dangerously', 'provoke', 'home', 'world', 'extra', 'mile', 'turn', 'apartment', 'old', 'friends', 'back', 'time', 'East', 'Germany', 'fall', 'Communism', 'interesting', 'premise', 'thanks', 'fine', 'writing', 'acting', 'direction', 'gimmick', 'not', 'get', 'old', 'only', 'more', 'interesting', 'focus', 'very', 'end', 'stretch', 'further', 'film', 'whole', 'so', 'thoughtfully', 'made', 'end', 'not', 'become', 'less', 'moving', 'result', 'memorable', 'innovative', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'thirds']",N/A
486874,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,7040267373,Wheelchair Assassin,"[8, 11]","If you've ever had a burning desire to see a German-language comedy centering around the collapse of communism in the Eastern Bloc, Good Bye, Lenin just may be the answer to your prayers. This is one of those rare movies that succeed on all levels, as it's hilarious at some points and genuinely effecting at others, all incorporated into some of the most important historical events of our time.  Director Wolfgang Becker pulls off this deceptively difficult trick with an effortless charm that's hard to find on either side of the Atlantic, as he does little more than examine the reactions of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances.  It's hard to think of a movie I've seen lately that's brought together as many disparate elements as seamlessly as this one.While Good Bye, Lenin is somewhat of a one-joke movie, that joke is far funnier and more original than just about anything else you'll see these days.  When Alex Kerner's mother sees him being taken off by cops during a protest in the final days of East Germany, she promptly has a heart attack and goes into an eight-month coma.  By the time she awakes Germany is one country again and loads of new consumer goods are flooding the East.  Normally one would have a hard time figuring out what the problem is with a flood of cheap new goods (there's even more than one brand of pickles now), but since Alex's mother has been devoted to the socialist state ever since her husband headed west and never came back, Alex fears that the shock of this brave new world could bring on another attack.  Since this next attack could finish her for good, Alex goes to every length imaginable to hide the truth from his bedridden mother, which isn't easy as the former East Germany has suddenly become a much more colorful place.  Not to mention, his sister Ariane, a single mother who's given up her studies for a position at a brand-new Burger King, isn't always on board with the plan.  Alex's devotion is certainly heartwarming, but it's also extremely stubborn and a bit crazy, and the unusual nature of Alex's commitment is the basis for much of the movie's humor.This ingenious plot device paves the way for what's easily one of the most intelligent and insightful movies to come along in a while.  There are plenty of laughs to be had as Alex's put-on becomes ever more elaborate, but the movie also has a lot to say about the way people deal with change, especially since change effects different people in different ways.  By focusing in on one family's undoubtedly unique experiences during this tumultuous period, Good Bye, Lenin provides insight into the colossal shock of communism's collapse at the same time as it gives the whole event a human dimension.  It's this combination of historical scope (even in dealing with events that happened a mere 15 years ago) and minute detail that makes this such an intriguing movie.  Becker's directon is constantly shifting tone from lighthearted to deadly serious, but it never stops focusing on the heavy emotional stakes involved in trying to maintain an entire vision of the world that no longer exists.  Good Bye, Lenin isn't just a period piece, or a family drama, or a comedy; it's all of the above wrapped into one.  And it doesn't hurt that the Russian nurse who becomes Alex's love interest is just about the hottest woman alive.Anyway, as capitalism continues making inroads and it becomes increasingly tough for Alex to hide the truth from his mother, he finds himself forced to construct a whole alternate reality, complete with fabricated newscasts explaining why there are so many Coke signs and westerners in ""East Germany"" now.  And the more Alex manipulates reality, the more attached he grows to the idealized notions that socialism represented.  The real East Germany may have been a dull, drab place, but the East Germany Alex creates for his mother is a paragon of community and opportunity, a place where people will eventually come searching for a more meaningful life.  Since communism was always more about idealism than realism anyway, it's not too hard for Alex to deceive his mother about the collapse of her beloved State.  He just shows her what she wants to see.Although I can't give it away, even the ending to this movie is surprisingly satisfying, even if it is a bit too sympathetic to socialism for this libertarian's taste.  It's not quite what you might be given to expect, but since Good Bye, Lenin is one decidedly unconventional movie maybe that's as it should be.  At any rate, if you're outgrowing Adam Sandler movies but you're not quite pretentious enough for the indie scene, Good Bye, Lenin is more than worth the two hours of your time.  While it doesn't contain the level of action I often like to see in a movie, it's more than impressive enough to get by without it.",5,The best (and only) German movie I've ever seen,1102636800,"12
