It is about America _after_ Columbus, specifically the transformation of North America's ecology due to the impact of European settlement.The video's production quality is excellent, with beautiful photography and a competent but introductory-level story line. Most people who have read some history won't find anything new here, since the information is presented at about a junior-high-school level. However, the video can be effortlessly enjoyed by the general public, and would also be a suitable introduction to the Columbian Exchange for supplementary use (about grades 6-10) in the classroom or homeschool.",4,Introducing the Columbian Exchange,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,724,"['spite', 'misleading', 'title', 'National', 'Geographic', 'video', ""n't"", 'really', 'America', 'Columbus', 'America', '_after_', 'Columbus', 'specifically', 'transformation', 'North', 'America', 'ecology', 'due', 'impact', 'European', 'settlement.The', 'video', 'production', 'quality', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'competent', 'introductory-level', 'story', 'line', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'history', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'information', 'presented', 'junior-high-school', 'level', 'However', 'video', 'can', 'be', 'effortlessly', 'enjoyed', 'general', 'public', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'suitable', 'introduction', 'Columbian', 'Exchange', 'supplementary', 'use', 'grades', '6-10', 'classroom', 'homeschool']",National Geographic: America Before Columbus
