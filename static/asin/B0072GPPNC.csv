Based on the 1982 children's novel of the same name, which also inspired a stage production, War Horse follows the travails of a spirited horse named Joey during World War I as he is raised by a farmboy, sold off to a soldier, and marched into the middle of battle. Joey endures various hardships but endures through it all, inspiring those around him to greater things. Characterized by polished filmmaking, old-fashioned storytelling, and a certain trademark sentimentality, War Horse won many fans when it opened during the holiday season and six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.

1524403,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0072GPPNC,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","What is there not to like about a movie (even if based, or maybe particularly because it is based on a children's novel) about a man (okay, a boy starting out) and his horse, their bonding together, their trials and tribulations and their successes (if that is an appropriate term in the midst of bloody carnage).Well, nothing, nothing on this good green earth (and the slice of England portrayed in the film is a very good example of that).Nothing, except man getting in the way of an obviously smarter member of the animal kingdom, one Joey the horse. Why?  Well, man and horse come of age just around the time of World War I when ""civilized"" Europe decided that a war to end all wars (they came up a little short, about 300 plus wars somewhere on the planet short since, on that proposition) was necessary to sort things out. So England and its colonies, France and its colonies, Russia and its colonies, and German and its colonies, decided to tear up half of continental Europe to see who the king hell king was anyway. And this war to end all wars happened to occur at just that point when humankind had exponentially increased its technological capacity to kill, to murder, and to maim at will.But not at 2012 levels, so one Joey the horse got ""drafted"" into the war and wound  up ""serving,"" one way or the other, both sides as beast of burden. But modern wars are not kind to those military whizzes who lived (pardon the expression) in the ""horse and buggy era,"" in the thinking of the last war, and so produced sickeningly destructive trench static warfare complete with barbed wire, maddened gas attacks, cavalry charges against fixed machine gun positions and used horse, including Joey (and his horse friend) to lug artillery into position. Madness, pure and simple.And that is where Joey, unlike the Brits, Germans, etc. showed he was smarter than all those guys who knowingly and hopelessly kept going up over those bloody trenches without a murmur. When he had the chance he ran like hell, he ""deserted"" like any sane person would. And lived to tell about it (or have it told). Chalk one up for the horse set.

Much more things happen, and its young owner, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), itself a soldier in the conflict, will try to get reunited to his beloved horse. Well made, entertaining. Perhaps the film&#8217;s best scene has the British troops charging over the Germans in a forest. The photography showing the pretty countryside of England and France helps a lot.

1524411,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0072GPPNC,Andrew Ellington,"[17, 41]","I'll admit, I wasn't walking into this film with the highest of expectations.  Even from the trailer, the film looked like a misguided campfest complete with overly saccharine elements and cringe worthy plot points.  What I got was pretty much what I expected, so I guess I shouldn't be so let down.  I guess what really upsets me the most here is that despite my initial assumptions about the film, part of me wanted to believe that the trailer misrepresented what Spielberg constructed and so there was a small part of me that expected to be proved wrong.`War Horse' suffers from a lot of things.  In fact, I'm scrapping the bottom of the barrel trying to find something of merit here, but even the obvious (""wow, it is so pretty to look at"") can be debunked when scrutinized (I'll get to that in a minute).First things first though; this story is ridiculous.  I know that many a story has been told about the effect an animal will have on a household or a community or just a young boy.  Most of these stories revolve around dogs and so it has become almost acceptable for that to be the case.  Lap it up, because we all bawl our eyes out when Old Yeller gets `put down'.  There is something odd though about the fixation formed on this horse.  Sure, horse movies aren't new and there are some told with true affection, but nothing about the relationship formed between Albert and his horse Joey feels genuine.  I blame the script and or Spielberg's shoddy direction for that.  I mean, there is no relationship developed here at all.  Because of that, we could really care less about the rest of this movie.  Sure, sell the horse.  Let is gallivant through the war touching lives like Forrest Gump.  Problem is, you've got scattered segments showing very little in the way of character development that the horse because nothing but a pretty prop.  When an elderly man makes a claim that Joey was the light of his granddaughter's life I'm left shrugging my shoulders because I saw her pet the thing once and ride it for all of thirty seconds before some soldiers took it away from her.  Basically, I don't care how she felt about the horse because it wasn't shown to me here.And then you just have the uncomfortable way in which Albert's affections for the horse are displayed.  It makes young Albert appear to be a simpleton.  I mean, I understand that he is younger than he looks (he attempts to pass for nineteen so as to stay alongside Joey when he's sold to a soldier) but he is still supposed to be a teenager of driving age and yet he basically wets himself when a soldier mails him a drawing he made of the horse.  It just feels so, unnatural.  It isn't compelling and it doesn't endear him to us.  Beyond the fact that I saw no reason to be attached considering that Spielberg didn't even try to add weight to the relationship between the boy and the horse, I just found his pining annoying.Then you have the heavily manipulated ending, which was nauseating in its forcible sentimentality.  The whole tone of the film is a miss, considering that parts feel like it was reaching for family comedy (that goose) and other parts trying for tense drama (fail) and yet other parts were so embarrassing I felt like I was watching a fake film, like those created for `Tropic Thunder'.The acting by everyone outside of Jeremy Irvine is very good, I will say.  Problem is, no one is really on screen long enough to build a character (outside of Irvine, Mullan and Watson who carry the film's first hour).  And then you have the cinematography, which is the `obvious' part I was referring to on the outset of my review.  I'm sorry, but this was too much.  I love a good showy celluloid frame.  I mean, films like `Atonement' and `The Tree of Life' are just so catching and heartstopping.  `War Horse' tries to go there.  The trailer alone was basically an FYC add for the film's cinematographer.  Instead though, the film's canvas seems ripped from other films and the way the shots are framed is almost comical.  Is it just me or does everyone in the first hour appear to be dwarfs?  The framing is ghastly!  It gets better, but then it goes all `Gone With the Wind' in the final frames (seriously) and I had to roll my eyes again.Having now seen all of the nominated films from Oscar's Best Picture ballot last year, I'm baffled this was included.I mean, HOW?",1,A boy and his...horse?,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,4362,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'walking', 'film', 'highest', 'expectations', 'Even', 'trailer', 'film', 'looked', 'misguided', 'campfest', 'complete', 'overly', 'saccharine', 'elements', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'plot', 'points', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'let', 'down', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'most', 'here', 'initial', 'assumptions', 'film', 'part', 'wanted', 'believe', 'trailer', 'misrepresented', 'what', 'Spielberg', 'constructed', 'so', 'was', 'small', 'part', 'expected', 'be', 'proved', 'wrong.', 'War', 'Horse', 'suffers', 'lot', 'things', 'fact', ""'m"", 'scrapping', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'merit', 'here', 'even', 'obvious', 'wow', 'so', 'pretty', 'look', 'can', 'be', 'debunked', 'when', 'scrutinized', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', '.First', 'things', 'first', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'know', 'many', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'effect', 'animal', 'will', 'have', 'household', 'community', 'just', 'young', 'boy', 'Most', 'stories', 'revolve', 'dogs', 'so', 'become', 'almost', 'acceptable', 'be', 'case', 'Lap', 'up', 'bawl', 'eyes', 'out', 'when', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'put', 'down', 'something', 'odd', 'fixation', 'formed', 'horse', 'Sure', 'horse', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'are', 'told', 'true', 'affection', 'nothing', 'relationship', 'formed', 'Albert', 'horse', 'Joey', 'genuine', 'blame', 'script', 'Spielberg', 'shoddy', 'direction', 'mean', 'relationship', 'developed', 'here', 'could', 'really', 'care', 'less', 'rest', 'movie', 'Sure', 'sell', 'horse', 'Let', 'gallivant', 'war', 'touching', 'lives', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Problem', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scattered', 'segments', 'showing', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'horse', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'prop', 'When', 'elderly', 'man', 'claim', 'Joey', 'was', 'light', 'granddaughter', 'life', ""'m"", 'left', 'shrugging', 'shoulders', 'saw', 'pet', 'thing', 'once', 'ride', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'soldiers', 'took', 'away', 'Basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'felt', 'horse', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'here.And', 'then', 'just', 'have', 'uncomfortable', 'way', 'Albert', 'affections', 'horse', 'are', 'displayed', 'young', 'Albert', 'appear', 'be', 'simpleton', 'mean', 'understand', 'younger', 'pass', 'nineteen', 'so', 'stay', 'alongside', 'Joey', 'when', 'sold', 'soldier', 'still', 'supposed', 'be', 'teenager', 'driving', 'age', 'yet', 'basically', 'when', 'soldier', 'drawing', 'made', 'horse', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'unnatural', ""n't"", 'compelling', ""n't"", 'endear', 'Beyond', 'fact', 'saw', 'reason', 'be', 'attached', 'considering', 'Spielberg', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'add', 'weight', 'relationship', 'boy', 'horse', 'just', 'found', 'pining', 'annoying.Then', 'have', 'heavily', 'manipulated', 'ending', 'was', 'nauseating', 'forcible', 'sentimentality', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'miss', 'considering', 'parts', 'feel', 'was', 'reaching', 'family', 'comedy', 'goose', 'other', 'parts', 'trying', 'tense', 'drama', 'fail', 'yet', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'so', 'embarrassing', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'fake', 'film', 'created', 'Tropic', ""Thunder'.The"", 'acting', 'everyone', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'say', 'Problem', 'one', 'really', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'build', 'character', 'Irvine', 'Mullan', 'Watson', 'who', 'carry', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'have', 'cinematography', 'obvious', 'part', 'was', 'referring', 'outset', 'review', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'good', 'showy', 'celluloid', 'frame', 'mean', 'films', 'Atonement', 'Tree', 'Life', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'catching', 'heartstopping', 'War', 'Horse', 'tries', 'go', 'there', 'trailer', 'alone', 'was', 'basically', 'FYC', 'add', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'Instead', 'film', 'canvas', 'ripped', 'other', 'films', 'way', 'shots', 'are', 'framed', 'almost', 'comical', 'just', 'everyone', 'first', 'hour', 'appear', 'be', 'dwarfs', 'framing', 'ghastly', 'better', 'then', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'final', 'frames', 'seriously', 'had', 'roll', 'eyes', 'again.Having', 'now', 'seen', 'nominated', 'films', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'ballot', 'last', 'year', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'was', 'included.I', 'mean', 'HOW']",N/A

1524434,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B0072GPPNC,Blago Jones,"[3, 4]","Pros: Steven Spielberg. War movie.Cons: I don't mean the above in some sort of, ""That's all that needs to be said"" mentality. That's actually all that can be said. Only the above is still misleading. When I say ""Steven Spielberg,"" I mean that someone traveled back to the 1950's to find a Spielberg still in grade school who does not yet know how to identify good plots or scripts or make them into good movies, and then had him make this movie. And when I say ""war movie,"" I mean that if any war was in this movie, I guess that part ended up on the cutting room floor. When it finished, my roommate Jeff asked, ""Did I just watch a PG war movie?"" No, Jeff. Somehow, against all odds, this movie stumbled its way into a PG-13 rating. My guess is that the more severe rating was the result of, ""Contains no rainbows or lollipops. Allusions to violence and less happy places.""I'm sorry, but I need to take a moment here. The fact that Spielberg directed this movie is really hurting my heart. Since the 80's, if he wasn't making movies that will literally change your life upon watching (e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List), he was at least making movies that were endlessly fun to watch (e.g. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park). Seriously, look at his directing filmography. Seven of my forty favorite movies had Spielberg at the helm. And the rest (that I've seen) are at least highly rated, if not top rated. So why the hell did he make this movie? It's killing me. No matter how many times I check the IMDB page, his name is still right there, under ""director.""The horse is the character that you care about the most, which I guess is the point. The problem is that the previous statement really isn't saying much, and I actually worded it wrong. What I meant to say was, ""The horse is the only character that you care about at all."" The whole movie attempts to be one big stab at sentimentality, but it falls flat on its face, because sentiment is best saved for, you know, things that you care about.I'm pretty sure the only reason this movie got any positive press (and... *sigh*... an Oscar nomination) is because it's about a horse, which apparently gives it some sort of credibility. If you were to take the exact same plot, characters, script, and actors, but replace the horse with another, less traditionally revered animal, it almost certainly would be laughed out of every movie house in existence.Separated by war. Tested by battle. Bound by friendship... War Goat.Overall: The best that I can say for it is that I never really looked at the clock. But I'm pretty sure at this point that the main reason I never looked was because I was waiting with baited breath for this to turn into a Spielberg movie (i.e. a movie that I enjoy watching). Right up to the moment when the screen turned black for the closing credits, I was convinced that Spielberg was just toying with me, and that the good part of the movie was right around the corner. Then the closing credits came, followed by all those copyright things at the very end for things like Dolby sound and Technicolor, and then the screen went black, and then... Steven Spielberg forced me to disgrace him with a 4 out of 10.

She told me it was written from the viewpoint of the horse. Well, with that information in mind I concluded before the movie even started that it was going to be a waste of time, and it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan for movies about horses.As soon as the movie started with Joey the horse being born and showed him fresh out of the womb, I was hooked. It follows Joey's life, from the point he was separated from his mother to a more experienced animal that understands life more so than most human beings. Joey proved to be very loyal and very brave. Even when the world was in complete hell around him and sometimes let him down, this horse never gave up. Joey stepped in for his friend, the black horse [don't know his name] time and time again, and he took the hurt and pain just so his friend wouldn't have to endure. This movie was not so much about the human caretakers, in my opinion, but the undying love, loyalty, and pain of this beautiful animal. After all, it is called War Horse, not War Human.I am glad I sat down to watch this movie. I like Spielberg movies anyway, and he won me over with this one, too. I laughed, I cried, and I was amazed.

1524454,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0072GPPNC,Chris Kennison,"[25, 33]","""War Horse"" is an epic film that has a grand scale and sweeping colorful horizons and golden skylines, reminding me instantly of the way movies of the 40s were shot, most particularly ""Gone with the Wind"". It has an old movie feel to it, and that, to me, was maybe its most shining attribute. Movies like ""War Horse"" don't exist anymore, so maybe that is why director Steven Spielberg chose to remind us of why maybe they should and why we miss them so much.While there are large scale, World War I battle scenes, ""War Horse"" proves what truly has power of influence over movie audiences; heart, personality and relationship to characters (and horses) that we empathize with. Steven Spielberg isn't one of Hollywood's greatest director's for no reason. He knows, and has known for years that you can destroy things, make scenes rapid and exciting and full of spectacle, but if the audience doesn't have feelings for the characters, it is all for nothing.The movie begins with the birth of a foal in a field with a young Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) watching on. From that moment on, Albert has found his love in life, a horse he later names Joey. The movie then follows the life of Joey as he changes hands, is given different names and experiences the joys and hardships of life. It is a fair comparison to the same ups and downs that humans experience. Joey is loved by Albert and a young girl named Emilie (newcomer Celine Buckens), but also faces terrible hardships as he dealt back and forth between soldiers at war.""War Horse"" is at times a little overdone in the emotional category. In the later parts of the movie, it seems Joey is treated with some soft of respect that comes out of nowhere with people who haven't been privy to the journey the horse has taken. The reaction to the `miracle' horse is more for the audience then realistic as men drop everything their doing to come to the aid of one horse in the middle of a grand war.That being said, the movie works if you don't think too much about it. ""War Horse"" works mostly for me just because Spielberg brought back some of the beauty of old style filmmaking, with bright horizons, dramatic dialogue and sweeping music that made you feel nostalgic, even though you were watching a movie made right now, in the 21st century.",4,Little too overblown,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,2293,"['War', 'Horse', 'epic', 'film', 'grand', 'scale', 'sweeping', 'colorful', 'horizons', 'golden', 'skylines', 'reminding', 'instantly', 'way', 'movies', '40s', 'were', 'shot', 'most', 'particularly', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'old', 'movie', 'feel', 'was', 'maybe', 'most', 'shining', 'attribute', 'Movies', 'War', 'Horse', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'so', 'maybe', 'why', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'chose', 'remind', 'why', 'maybe', 'should', 'why', 'miss', 'so', 'are', 'large', 'scale', 'World', 'War', 'battle', 'scenes', 'War', 'Horse', 'what', 'truly', 'power', 'influence', 'movie', 'audiences', 'heart', 'personality', 'relationship', 'characters', 'horses', 'empathize', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', ""n't"", 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'director', 'reason', 'known', 'years', 'can', 'destroy', 'things', 'make', 'scenes', 'rapid', 'exciting', 'full', 'spectacle', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'feelings', 'characters', 'nothing.The', 'movie', 'birth', 'foal', 'field', 'young', 'Albert', 'Narracott', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'watching', 'moment', 'Albert', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'horse', 'later', 'names', 'Joey', 'movie', 'then', 'life', 'Joey', 'hands', 'given', 'different', 'names', 'joys', 'hardships', 'life', 'fair', 'comparison', 'same', 'ups', 'downs', 'experience', 'Joey', 'loved', 'Albert', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Emilie', 'newcomer', 'Celine', 'Buckens', 'also', 'terrible', 'hardships', 'back', 'forth', 'soldiers', 'war', 'War', 'Horse', 'times', 'little', 'overdone', 'emotional', 'category', 'later', 'parts', 'movie', 'Joey', 'treated', 'soft', 'respect', 'nowhere', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'privy', 'journey', 'horse', 'taken', 'reaction', 'miracle', 'horse', 'more', 'audience', 'then', 'realistic', 'men', 'everything', 'doing', 'come', 'aid', 'one', 'horse', 'middle', 'grand', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'War', 'Horse', 'mostly', 'just', 'Spielberg', 'brought', 'back', 'beauty', 'old', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'bright', 'horizons', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'sweeping', 'music', 'made', 'feel', 'nostalgic', 'even', 'were', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'right', 'now', '21st', 'century']",N/A
1524455,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B0072GPPNC,Christopher Schwinger,"[4, 4]","Steven Spielberg is a grade above most contemporary directors because he keeps his priorities right, on the story and relationships.  I hardly ever see movies in theaters today because most of them are crass and confusingly edited.  This movie's cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) is rich and creative, and close-ups are used effectively to help you bond with the characters.  John Williams' music is once again enriching.  It is a movie about the adventures of a horse in World War I, but it's even more about the struggle to adapt and maintain stable relationships in war.  The horse is, for some of the characters, their closest companion.  Kind of like ""Sarah, Plain and Tall:  Winter's End"", War Horse's theme is about the need to build relationships as the fragility of life is impressed upon us.  In fact, at one point, the horse brings together the opposing sides in friendship in the ""no man's land"" between the trenches, reminiscent of the widespread real-life Christmas Truce which occurred in 1914.  Another thing that impresses me is the way it shows violence.  There's no blood on the whole movie that I saw, and powerful emotions of fear and relief are created through making you feel attached to the characters, not through graphic violence.  As a John Ford aficionado, I could see Ford's influence in Spielberg's storytelling, with the camera angle and position sometimes depicting an emotional closeness with the land and an ending told without words, like the end of Ford's movie The Searchers.

1524457,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0072GPPNC,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","There are scenes in Steven Spielberg's 2011 film ""War Horse"" so extraordinary you will have difficulty catching your breath. Filmed with such artistic imagination, one could argue they are some of the most unforgettable celluloid moments ever realized. A cavalry charge through a field of wheat, an execution framed by a windmill and a horse fighting through a battlefield's barbed wire are just a few incredible images Spielberg has forged from his naturally creative genius. At times I was awestruck by this family film, and disagree with many critics who argue it's too violent for children (maybe in the decades before 24-hour cable violence). But don't get me wrong, this is not a great Spielberg film as it suffers serious miscalculations.Foremost, I found the performance of Jeremy Irvine in the teenage lead of Albert Narracott to be distractingly overwrought. I've read this was his debut, so it's puzzling filmmakers would cast someone so inexperienced for such a crucial role. He's practically on the verge of tears in every scene and never for a moment do I believe his angst. And did he have to look like a GQ model? As has been Spielberg's trademark, he enjoys casting unknown but usually talented actors for his films. The habit has succeeded more often than not (""Jaws,""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition),Empire of the Sun). It's clear Steven was attempting to recreate the glorious eras of old-fashioned Hollywood, with strokes reminiscent ofThe Quiet Man (Collector's Edition),Gone with the Wind,Ben-Hurand, what the heck, let's throw inThe Yearlingfor good measure. But those sweeping technicolor epics had larger-than-life actors John Wayne, Clark Gable and Charlton Heston, and ""War Horse"" is in desperate need of such on-screen presence.On the eve of World War I, a rural English farming family is struggling to survive in a green valley. Father Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), suffering from alcoholism in jovial Darby O'Gill tradition, gets into a bidding war over a horse with his well-scrubbed landlord. Rather than a plow horse, he brings a beautiful chestnut thoroughbred to his doorstep, and Mother Narracott (Emily Watson) is incensed at such costly folly. They're now in danger of losing the farm, but misty-eyed Albert loves the magical animal and teaches it to plow a rocky field. The turnip crops abruptly fail, war breaks out and Father Ted must sell the horse to the British Army to survive.Thus begins an aggressively episodic series of chapters focusing exclusively on the regal horse as it attempts to survive the rigors of cavalry charges, machine guns and trench warfare. Albert enlists in the army and dreams of finding his equine pet. Yes, this is a fairy tale in the Walt Disney vein, and it is indeedThe Incredible Journey. The film is based on a British children's novel by Michael Morpurgo (War Horse), which was adapted into a popular play, but the stark chapters erode emotional momentum and I had difficulty in relating to the horse's plight.I appreciated the abrupt chapters, as we are introduced to a noble British captain (Tom Hiddleston), youthful German brothers (Leonard Carow, David Kross), and a French man and his granddaughter (Niels Arestrup, Celine Bukens) who make jam while cannons thunder on the horizon. Any one of these chapters would have made a fine film, but are shoehorned into a frantic two-plus hour running time and disappear far too quickly.

1524458,ACJVGDN8G386P,B0072GPPNC,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 0]","At the forefront of a compelling movie are the characters and a gripping storyline, and War Horse certainly has both. At the same time, all or at least most of the crucial events need to be believable if the film is to escalate into the higher echelons. Unfortunately, War Horse juxtaposes between the starkly real and forced sentimentality. While some episodes were edge-of-your seat mesmerizing, other parts felt like the storytellers were forcing the issue. Particularly at two or three of the most vital scenes of the film, &#34;oh you can't be serious&#34; brought the movie out of its believability and into overt melodrama, such as in &#34;Sleepless in Seattle&#34; and &#34;Forrest Gump&#34;. The film could have been a genuinely profound statement of survival and redemption if it hadn't lowered its standards in a few places, particularly at the end. Instead, it tries to make the audience merely feel good, which is at odds with so much of the rest of film.The main thrust is the tried-and-true formula of two kindred spirits attempting to be re-united; in this case a boy and his beloved horse. A family only a couple of generations removed from a medieval-like existence in Northern England are on the brink of starvation and eviction when the drunkard father bids for a horse. Only the amount is about 3 to 4 times the horse's worth. And worse yet, he outbid his own landlord who is owed several months back rent. This beginning worked fine for me as it sets up the ideas of bad judgment and desperation. Somehow they have to make their animal bring a return on their investment by using it to plow their barren fields, or they'll be out in the snowy streets. How this unfolds works, more and less, until mother-nature destroys their plans. In the meantime, the boy Albert bonds with the horse as only young adults and horses can, as we have seen in other stories like &#34;the Black Stallion&#34; and &#34;National Velvet&#34;. The bonding was a bit forced and at one point I knew immediately one element of their relationship would be recapitulated later. But even given that I was willing to run with it. However, one problem with clich&eacute; is ultimately it's boring.Next, the boy wakes up one morning to find the stable empty. He races to town where his horse has been sold to a regiment in the British Army about to embark in the conflict known then as the Great War, now called World War I. The horse has been sold for near its asking price to a young colonel. At this point, I felt the film had disrobed its cloak of sentimentality and the real story begins. The horse also befriends another black stallion owned by another young officer, and the two become almost like the animal-equivalent of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn engaging in unimaginable adventures.What makes War Horse interesting from this point forward, and ultimately saves it as a film, is that we follow the horse and his friend as the main characters of the story. We experience the war literally through the horses' eyes as it travels to the European Continent, fights in battles, changes hands, finding enemies and friends on both sides. The horses even find an alley or two among the Germans. At one point, we know a bond has developed between the two horses. Several times, the horses are employed to assist in the transportation of decidedly 20th-century technology; the old technology helping out the new. Another quite compelling moment involves the main horse trapped in the middle of so-called No-Mand's Land between the English and German trenches. These episodes were so un-clich&eacute; that I was riveted at every moment.However, about 3/4's through the story, the young Albert re-appears, now as a low-rank soldier in the conflict. And here, for me, it began to go downhill. Of course, we as the audience desire the horse and the boy to be re-united. But how this plays out seemed just too convenient to be believable. At one moment when it appears all is lost, the story took an obvious favorable turn and I didn't buy it. I found myself shaking my head and saying &#34;oh brother&#34;. I wished I could have grabbed the script and given the work a better ending. Unfortunately, the ending rang more of a clich&eacute; you might find in a Harlequinn Romance than a compelling story about a horse during World War I.Still, there are many good things in War Horse, and much to praise, but it also made the entire experience feel like the film didn't know which way it wanted to travel, a sentimental &#34;feel good&#34; paved street or the much more profound dirt road of thwarted desires because of human conflict. Which makes its obvious weakness all the more frustrating. When Claude Rains says &#34;Round up the usual suspects&#34; in &#34;Casablanca&#34; or the boy in &#34;Empire of the Sun&#34; is finally re-united with his parents, you never once think it was contrived, that the writers forced the story into a particular direction. It all feels natural. The ending of War Horse was disappointing because so many other aspects lacked the cooked-up feel of the end. For this reason endings are not always easy, and finding the ending which is both satisfying and natural makes the difference between a good film and a great one. This one could have been great but ranks as only merely good.

1524460,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B0072GPPNC,Cool Breeze,"[4, 10]","Perhaps it is me, but I find it extremely difficult to enjoy movies directed by Stephen Spielberg. Yes, Spielberg is a legendary filmmaker, whose films have grossed billions of dollars over a four decade span. He has won loads of Oscars and brought joy to billions of people; and his achievements have made him one of the most influential people in earth's history. Yet despite all of that, I usually cannot bring myself to watch a Spielberg film in a movie theatre. Why is this? Well, apart from ""Schiendler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", the majority of his films are steeped in treacly sentiment, and I cannot abide it any longer. Spielberg's purpose as a filmmaker is to provide the movie goer with a conduit to their childhood. In order for him to successfully do this, he directs films that are centered around a chaste love story of some kind; or there might be a film where a ""cute"" relationship between a child and a pet/robot/alien will be longingly examined. Some of you may remember that the direction of the movie ""A.I"" was inherited by Spielberg after Stanley Kubrick died during the making of that film. The half of the movie that was directed by Kubrick was excellent and lauded by fans and critics alike. Instead of continuing Kubrick's vision, Spielberg usurped the film, injected his own sensibility into its direction, and crafted a second half of a movie that confused and disoriented critics and movie goers. The end of ""A.I"" was too sentimental and cloying, and engendered some enmity towards Spielberg. As a movie lover, I like to watch dramatic movies that are emotionally honest even if the subject matter is fantastical. Apart from the two period pieces that I mentioned(which are based on historical events) he seems incapable of doing so.The film ""Warhorse"" is a typical Spielberg film.  Set during the period of the first World War, the movie begins as a story about a boy(Albert) and his horse(Joey). Albert's father and mother are wilting beneath excessive financial burdens. However, the father fails to take these financial responsibilities into account when he purchases Joey at an auction.  There is just something about that horse that compels the father to continue bidding at his own peril. He buys the horse at a price that is way beyond his means, and after the initial euphoria at the purchase of the horse wanes, he realizes that he has spent all of his money on a horse that cannot plow the field. Upon seeing the horse, Albert also falls in immediate love with the animal and firmly resolves to take it under his wing. The purchase of the horse has left the family without money for rent, and their cruel and callous landlord will soon be coming to collect.  The only hope for the family is if the boy can teach the horse to plow so that the land on which the family lives can be cultivated for crops.  After much effort by Albert, and derision and doubt from the father and the landlord, Albert is able to teach the horse to plow the farm.  The land is subsequently cultivated, the family has hopes of selling the crops for profit, and paying of the landlord and keeping their farm.  Unfortunately, there is a rainstorm and the crops are washed away in the storm.  With no hope left, the father absconds away with the horse and sells it to the British army.  It is the advent of the 1st World War(1914)and horses are of great value to the British army. Devastated, Albert begs his father to rescind the transaction. He even offers to enlist as a soldier in the army so that he may stay with his horse. But Albert's youth makes him ineligible for service, and he is forced to say a tearful goodbye to his beloved pet.Joey becomes a ""War Horse"" during WWI. He is originally used by the officer who purchased him from Albert's father as a cavalry horse. That is until the officer is killed by the German army, and Joey, along with another black horse, effectively becomes an orphan during the war. Not to worry though. As a tandem, Joey and his friend melt the hearts of the people with whom they come into contact as they wander aimlessly through war torn Europe. Some of these caretakers are soldiers, others are civilians. It doesn't really matter who because all who come into contact with the two horses immediately succumb to their charms. The horses bring out the best in their caretakers during this war, as they all exhibit courage, love, and sacrifice during the most difficult circumstances. The horses act as a common thread in this film, a thread that when touched by human beings transforms them into better people.Joey's equine friend eventually dies of a lame leg, but Joey marches onward. During the war's duration, Albert is able to enlist as a soldier in the British army. After Albert is injured during a firefight that temporarily blinds him, and Joey is brought to a military camp by a soldier who rescues him from being entangled in barb wire, the two friends eventually reunite. As a consequence of their reunion, Albert and Joey are able to go home together after the conclusion of the war.I watched this movie after having previously watched ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in the same movie theatre. These movies could not be more dissimilar except for one similarity: they are both long movies. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" runs for 2 hours 38 minutes, while ""War Horse"" runs for 2 hours 26 minutes. That said, the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" felt like a shorter movie than ""War Horse"", and that is part of the reason why ""Dragon Tattoo"" was so much better.  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" seems to zip by while ""War Horse"" seems to plod along like a Clydesdale towing a romantic couple through the park. ""War Horse"" feels like a movie that is all of 2 hours 26 minutes long. The excessive length of this movie caused me to repeatedly stir in my seat, and I began to wonder when and if it would ever end.Don't get me wrong. ""War Horse"" is well made. The acting is very good by all who are involved, and I am a sucker for adventurous and/or epic period pieces.  Still, the movie reeks of convention and that signature Speilberg sentiment. The movie's ending wraps everything up too nicely, and I was left unfulfilled as a result.  Still, if you are a fan of Spielberg's more sentimental work, this is the movie for you.",3,Treacly Spielberg,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,6305,"['Perhaps', 'find', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'enjoy',

1524463,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0072GPPNC,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 3]","Firstly, I think it might be appropriate to share what ""War Horse"" is not.  It is not ""Saving Private Ryan in World War I"".  The realism and horror of war shown in Private Ryan, and for that matter Schindler's List, is not evident here.  No, the Great War of this film harkens further back into Spielberg's past, perhaps most closely akin to ""Empire of the Sun"".  Like the prison camp of Empire, this WWI is ... I'm not sure of the right word. Sanitized? Idealized?  No man's land is full of mud, but not of rats and body parts, and there's no incessant noise from shelling.  When an artillery shell does hit a trench full of men, bodies are thrown about whole.  Even in the much-talked about scene (minor spoiler!) of the horse trapped in the razor wire, there is very little blood, especially not on the face, and the horse doesn't ""scream"" in terror, a sound often mentioned in war memoirs as being the most horrifying sound on a battlefield.It will sound like a criticism to start a review this way, but that was not my intention.  I think Spielberg deliberately toned down the horror of war (and by all accounts, the WWI trenches were more horrifying than the Normandy beaches) because those horrors would not necessarily register with a horse.  Would a horse recognize a disembodied arm?  Would it care about rats crawling in No Man's Land?  Unlikely.  Therefore, this really is the story of the titular War Horse (named, innocently, Joey).  We are meant to watch Joey.  We are meant to see things through Joey's eyes.  In one telling scene (another minor spoiler!) of a cavalry charge, we see large numbers of horses go careening through the enemy lines without their riders, who have been shot off.  Only briefly do we see any dead horses, and then they look like they might be sleeping.  In fact, all parts of the film are almost stereotyped - the cast seem almost to a man (and woman) to overact just a little.  This is clearly a deliberate choice of the director, if only because Emily Watson is unimpeachable in her talents, and she's just as bad (or good!) as the rest.  Now consider the cinematography - Janusz Kaminsky's pastoral settings of rural England and France (behind the lines) are bold over-saturated colours of yellows, browns, and greens.  Presumably this represents the ideal setting for Joey.  In contrast the war scenes, where Joey is forced to pull artillery, surrounded by death and destruction, the palate is completely washed out grey.  There is none of the usual Kaminsky subtlety here, again a deliberate use of colour to emphasize mood more in keeping with a simple horse's point of view than that of an Oscar-winning DP.  Even John Williams's score is often too bold, with brassy, upbeat rythms that are compulsively musical, not what you'd expect for a Great War film.The film is skillfully made.  But is it a ""good"" film?  I suspect opinions will vary widely.  At one end, the horse's ""acting"" is a truly astonishing achievement.  Even so, for a Spielberg film, for me it falls somewhere behind his true classics (from Jaws through Raiders of the Lost Ark to Saving Private Ryan).  I don't think it ever really pulled me in completely.  This might partly be because of its episodic nature - Joey is the only constant, he moves from owner-to-owner right up to the last 15 minutes of the film.  In that last 15 minutes there are some reappearances of former owners (I will not say which ones!), but it's not enough.  True, the very end (the last 2 minutes, say) are emotionally moving and even uplifting, but with a cloying sentimentality - surely a deliberate choice - that seems manipulative in hindsight.  Again, perhaps like Empire of the Sun, this film hovers at the boundry of adult fare and ""family"" fare - not wanting to go too far into realism, but too much for the kids to enjoy.Overall it's a good film, but not one that I would compulsively watch if it came on TV late at night.  Perhaps I'm just too much a product of the ""cynical era"" to be able to totally enjoy a thickly troweled sentiment, no matter how skillfully made it is (and ""thickly troweled"" is rather cynical of me, isn't it?). In a rating system of 5 stars, I find it falls in the middle of the 3-star and 4-star range.  So why did I go with 3/5?  Because of the Blu-ray extras.  There are very few here.  A roundtable with a few of the actors and producers, a 3-minute short on the extras, and that's it.  I, for one, would love to have seen how the movie was created - especially the scenes of the horses at the front.  Was it a combination of computer graphics and live-action?  If so, it was totally seamless.  If it was all live action, how could you possibly get a horse to do what they did and still have healthy, living horses at the end of the shoot?",3,"More of a ""horse"" film than a ""war""

Spielberg is well qualified to deal with such subjects: I have just finished watching The Pacific and it's interesting to make the comparison. Typically Spielbergian camera shots abound, the choreographing of the battlefield scenes is exquisite and the attention to military details is obvious. Nevertheless this is, unlikeSaving Private Ryanfor instance, a family film and while it doesn't shy away from the nastiness of the war, it remains sensitive to its younger audience members. I did take exception to Albert's rather miraculous recovery from what must obviously have been a fairly light gassing and I wondered at the sight of a Devonshire infantry regiment going ""over the top"" to the accompaniment of the bagpipes.While the camerawork is excellent, the same cannot be said of other aspects of the production, with some glaring continuity errors and some appaling lighting work with characters casting three or four shadows in many scenes. Perhaps I'm too harsh and younger viewers may not notice these things.My wife observed that the film remained faithful to the original story and while some inevitable editing had taken place, the main story elements were preserved and there was little mucking about from the screenwriters.  I however I felt that the film tended to lose the book's focus on Joey the horse and the film was as much, if not more, about the human characters (Albert in particular).In the end, this is a decent piece of cinematic story telling, engaging, exciting and emotional. It is quite appropriate for younger viewers but they will need some adult help in understanding the issues raised. To a more critical eye however, it's clear that Spielberg took his eye off the ball with this one and it's by no means one of his best. I guess it will depend on the viewer but I found it to be a bit of a disappointment after the hype. My wife enjoyed it far more than I did.And neither of us cried!",3,Not one of Spielberg's best,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2234,"['Michael', 'Morpurgo', 'wrote', 'Thisclassic', 'children', 'storywhich', 'found', 'way', 'stage', 'anamazing', 'play', 'now', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'brought', 'big', 'screen.The', 'story', 'strength', 'equine', 'human', 'spirits', 'face', 'what', 'are', 'now', 'almost', 'unimaginable', 'privations', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Spielberg', 'well', 'qualified', 'deal', 'such', 'subjects', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Pacific', 'interesting', 'make', 'comparison', 'Typically', 'Spielbergian', 'camera', 'shots', 'abound', 'choreographing', 'battlefield', 'scenes', 'exquisite', 'attention', 'military', 'details', 'obvious', 'Nevertheless', 'unlikeSaving', 'Private', 'Ryanfor', 'instance', 'family', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'nastiness', 'war', 'sensitive', 'younger', 'audience', 'members', 'did', 'take', 'exception', 'Albert', 'rather', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'what', 'must', 'obviously', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'light', 'gassing', 'wondered', 'sight', 'Devonshire', 'infantry', 'regiment', 'going', 'top', 'accompaniment', 'bagpipes.While', 'camerawork', 'excellent', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'aspects', 'production', 'glaring', 'continuity', 'errors', 'appaling', 'lighting', 'work', 'characters', 'casting', 'three', 'four', 'shadows', 'many', 'scenes', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'too', 'harsh', 'younger', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'notice', 'things.My', 'wife', 'observed', 'film', 'remained', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'inevitable', 'editing', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'main', 'story', 'elements', 'were', 'preserved', 'was', 'little', 'mucking', 'screenwriters', 'however', 'felt', 'film', 'tended', 'lose', 'book', 'focus', 'Joey', 'horse', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'human', 'characters', 'Albert', 'particular', 'end', 'decent', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'story', 'telling', 'engaging', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'need', 'adult', 'help', 'understanding', 'issues', 'raised', 'more', 'critical', 'eye', 'however', 'clear', 'Spielberg', 'took', 'eye', 'ball', 'one', 'means', 'one', 'best', 'guess', 'will', 'depend', 'viewer', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'hype', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'more', 'did.And', 'cried']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[115, 125]","The courage of a horse and its bond with a young man amid the horrors of war serves as the backdrop to a saga of loyalty and survival in Warhorse, Steven Spielberg's take on World War I and its effect on a British family.  Adapted from a novel and inspired by the stage play of the same name, this is old fashioned filmmaking that could have easily been made 50 years ago back when epic war dramas like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago ruled the screens.A teenage boy, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), and a colt, Joey, form a bond amid the English countryside. Albert's mother (Emily Watson) worries over the house being repossessed as his father (Peter Mullan), an alcoholic and war veteran, struggles to harvest crops from the harsh land.  Threatened with eviction, Joey is sold to the army to assist in the fighting in Europe during World War I.  Heartbroken, Albert vows to find Joey and be reunited.  We can see early on that Joey is a special horse who is smart and brave whether he submits to being a plow horse, outracing a motor car, or lugging German war machines up a mountain.  As the years pass from 1914-1918 and the war amasses its destructive toll on men and animals on both sides, Joey's ownership changes hands, but through it all, he finds a succession of kind souls to watch over him.  When Albert joins the battle, an unlikely series of events will bring him closer to Joey.Joey is an allegory to slavery as he is being sold as a commodity to hard labor and taken as property by either side in the war.  The story is primarily told through his eyes, and each set of people Joey encounters has a personal story: the British officer who makes a promise to bring Joey back to his rightful owner, a young German soldier who dotes protectively over his brother, or a German farm girl who is cared for by her grandfather. In wartime, making friends and losing them is a way of life, and Joey is no different whether it is a human or fellow mare.  Some common themes emerge from all these people, namely their affection for Joey and the toll that war exacts on loved ones.Production values are superior especially the vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who employs color schemes especially at the end that emulate the palettes of Gone with the Wind.  Irvine is ideally cast as the son who refuses to give up on his horse and friend.There are not a lot of the trademark Spielberg moments that you expect; Clint Eastwood could have been the director without much difference.  There are memorable scenes that resonate including a tragic charge by British cavalry on a German position and an auction with an army `band of brothers' pitching in for a worthy cause.  Then there is the harrowing, desperate escape by Joey that culminates in him getting tangled in barbed wire in No Man's Land and help coming from an unlikely source which results in a most unusual standoff.  Such scenes may seem clich&eacute;d but register nonetheless.The ending does have an emotional payoff, but there are some missed opportunities along the way.  There are relationships that could have been developed more like Albert's father who is a one dimensional character but has suffered trauma from a previous war.  The possibility of romance for Albert during a race between Joey and a car carrying a pretty girl never develops.

1524472,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B0072GPPNC,Daniel A. Brown,"[3, 6]","""War Horse"" begins with the kind of sunlit bucolic scene one would expect from Steven Spielberg, followed by the inevitable bonding of a splendidly handsome horse named Joey with a splendidly handsome young man (Jeremy Irvine). Behind the sentiment is the portrayal of rural life in pre-WW I which hadn't changed much from the 17th century. Electricity and running water don't exist; plowing is still done gruelingly by hand behind a horse. All these harsh realities are complimented by evil landlords, callow heirs, weak, haunted fathers and sturdy, indomitable women, (especially Emily Watson, excellent as the only name actor in the film). The opening sequence of man and boy proving their mettle is clich&eacute;d but still packs emotional and visual power. The film, however, takes off as World War I erupts and the horse is sold to the British Army. This sequence begins much as the war did, with cheering crowds and beautifully uniformed soldiers riding off to an unimaginable hell. Spielberg's portrayal of that horror is perfectly nuanced and he wisely resists the urge to graphically replicate ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is no splattering blood or flying limbs. The hardest scenes to watch, judging from my audience's reaction, involve the brutality suffered by the horses as they are either shot to death by machine gun fire or worked to death hauling Krupp howitzers up endless, muddy ridges. The soldiers, once so enthusiastic, have been reduced by the filth, terror, and hopelessness of trench warfare. Although some have pegged ""War Horse"" as an anti-war film, it doesn't bludgeon the message as World War I is now universally viewed as one of the most wasteful and unnecessary wars in human history. The Germans and Brits are equally responsible for this carnage and equally the victims of it. The Germans are not so much evil (that will come with the next war) but methodical, executing deserters (two young brothers in one of the sadder scenes) and looting French farmers (one portrayed as a Jean Valjean look-alike) in a dispassionate, business-like manner. In fact, one of the most sympathetic characters in the film is a German horse wrangler trying futilely to protect his charges from destruction. World War I has always been overshadowed in films by its successor, but with the centennial coming up, maybe that will change. Spielberg's one vivid battle scene captures the horror emphatically. The most poignant scene in the film, of lone German and British soldiers cooperating in No Man's Land to free a barbed wire entangled Joey, makes the film worth the watch. Unfortunately, from there, Spielberg drops the ball, staging a sappy reunion with horse and boy followed by an embarrassing reunion with boy and family, lit by the most exaggerated sunset in film history. Still, this being Spielberg, even that cannot ruin what is a well-staged tale, with some of the most glorious cinematography available.",3,"""Saving Private Seabiscuit""",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2931,"['War', 'Horse', 'kind', 'sunlit', 'bucolic', 'scene', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'followed', 'inevitable', 'bonding', 'splendidly', 'handsome', 'horse', 'named', 'Joey', 'splendidly', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'sentiment', 'portrayal', 'rural', 'life', 'pre-WW', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', '17th', 'century', 'Electricity', 'running', 'water', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'plowing', 'still', 'done', 'gruelingly', 'hand', 'horse', 'harsh', 'realities', 'are', 'complimented', 'evil', 'landlords', 'callow', 'heirs', 'weak', 'haunted', 'fathers', 'sturdy', 'indomitable', 'women', 'especially', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'excellent', 'only', 'name', 'actor', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'man', 'boy', 'proving', 'mettle', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'still', 'emotional', 'visual', 'power', 'film', 'however', 'off', 'World', 'War', 'erupts', 'horse', 'sold', 'British', 'Army', 'sequence', 'much', 'war', 'did', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'beautifully', 'uniformed', 'soldiers', 'riding', 'off', 'unimaginable', 'hell', 'Spielberg', 'portrayal', 'horror', 'perfectly', 'nuanced', 'wisely', 'urge', 'graphically', 'replicate', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'splattering', 'blood', 'flying', 'limbs', 'hardest', 'scenes', 'watch', 'judging', 'audience', 'reaction', 'involve', 'brutality', 'suffered', 'horses', 'are', 'shot', 'death', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'worked', 'death', 'hauling', 'Krupp', 'howitzers', 'up', 'endless', 'muddy', 'ridges', 'soldiers', 'once', 'so', 'enthusiastic', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'filth', 'terror', 'hopelessness', 'trench', 'warfare', 'have', 'pegged', 'War', 'Horse', 'anti-war', 'film', ""n't"", 'bludgeon', 'message', 'World', 'War', 'now', 'universally', 'viewed', 'one', 'most', 'wasteful', 'unnecessary', 'wars', 'human', 'history', 'Germans', 'Brits', 'are', 'equally', 'responsible', 'carnage', 'equally', 'victims', 'Germans', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'evil', 'will', 'come', 'next', 'war', 'methodical', 'executing', 'deserters', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'one', 'sadder', 'scenes', 'looting', 'French', 'farmers', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'look-alike', 'dispassionate', 'business-like', 'manner', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'film', 'German', 'horse', 'wrangler', 'trying', 'futilely', 'protect', 'charges', 'destruction', 'World', 'War', 'always', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'films', 'successor', 'centennial', 'coming', 'up', 'maybe', 'will', 'change', 'Spielberg', 'one', 'vivid', 'battle', 'scene', 'horror', 'emphatically', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', 'film', 'lone', 'German', 'British', 'soldiers', 'cooperating', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'free', 'barbed', 'wire', 'entangled', 'Joey', 'film', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'there', 'Spielberg', 'ball', 'staging', 'sappy', 'reunion', 'horse', 'boy', 'followed', 'embarrassing', 'reunion', 'boy', 'family', 'lit', 'most', 'exaggerated', 'sunset', 'film', 'history', 'Still', 'being', 'Spielberg', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'ruin', 'what', 'well-staged', 'tale', 'most', 'glorious', 'cinematography', 'available']",N/A

Yes, it was nice how Albert bonded with the horse Joey and they defied the odds when it came to plowing a field. But Albert still didn't feel three-dimensional to me and he was the one character besides Joey which the movie spent the most time on.I went in with the feeling that everything would work out just fine, so despite the setting being World War I, I never had a sense of danger. I expected a lot of sorta crazy things to happen if the two were to somehow get through the war together; however, there were too many unbelievable moments, not just mere coincidences. My favorite scenes were the grandfather and little girl in France who found the horse in their windmill. But how in the world did they not hear the regiment of German troops over the hill when he sent her off riding up the hill? The scene where a British soldier and a German soldier work together to save the horse in no man's land was almost laughable to me, when I'm sure it was meant to be touching.

1524485,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0072GPPNC,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","Mark Twain's observation is a fitting title for a review of this rousing screen production with which Stephen Spielberg has gifted us.Based on a stage play of the same name, it follows the World War I adventures of a brown mare named Joey, born and raised on a farm in Devon, England by farm boy Albert Narracott( Jeremy Irvine), who lives on a family farm with his father(Peter Mullan)and mother(Emily Watson).They endure a challenging relationship with their land owner,David Lyons(David Thewlis in his first film since the close of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise), but young Albert impresses Mr. Lyons and the other landowners  with his ability to use Joey to plow a challenging plot of land. But soon the financially strapped Mr. Narracott sells  Joey to Captain Nicols(Tom Hiddleston), despite the pleas of a devastated Albert as World War I begins and many horses from local farms are recruited for the fight. The now-tattered banner carried by Mr. Narracott in a previous war, will be the distinguishing artifact identifying Joey as his perilous adventure begins.The throughbread is attracted to a beautiful black mare  who will share many of his wartime escapades by the name of Topthorn.The two have an exhilarating race against each other as part of their and their officer's basic training.Soon they are in France facing combat against the Germans, and Joey rushes through the forest sans his rider under heavy artillery fire only to end up in German custody with Topthorn.The dual equine adventure continues as two brothers in the Kaiser's Army(David Kross and Leonard Carrow) use them in an ill-fated attempt to desert.Left in a windmill by the brothers, they are found by a sickly French orphan named Emilie(Celine Buckens)who lives on the farm where the windmill is situated with her grandfather(Niels Arestrup).Tending to the horses brightens the young girl's life. But while she was initially able to save them from confiscation when the German Army raided their farm and home for food, to her great devastation, Emilie fails to shield them from another attempted confiscation. The Hippie Era  slogan, ""War is unhealthy for children, and other living things"" receives more than enough visual emphasis in this scene.With their furlough from battle all too abruptly ended, they are made to pull heavy German artillery, and the conflict becomes more brutal.Joey will grieve a loss and gallop around, over, and through the trenches to get past the human madness of artillery fire in a scene that makes one have further regrets how Man's shameful inability to solve disputes peacefully has such terrifying impact on all living creatures. War is the ultimate stupid human trick!But there is a brief moment of unity when two officers from opposite sides of the conflict help free Joey from entanglement in barbed wire.By this time, Albert has joined the conflict and despite the odds of finding him, is looking for Joey with a moving sense of dogged determination.A post Harry-Potter era Matthew Lewis appears as a soldier in the trenches, and Liam Cunning plays an Army doctor presiding over a fateful decision involving Joey.Viewers can learn the ultimate fate of the two-legged and four-legged combatants against a beautiful golden twilight.-A serene and solemnly triumphant ending!",5,"Man Is the Only Animal That Blushes, Or Needs To!",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,3293,"['Mark', 'Twain', 'observation', 'fitting', 'title', 'review', 'rousing', 'screen', 'production', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'gifted', 'us.Based', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'World', 'War', 'adventures', 'brown', 'mare', 'named', 'Joey', 'born', 'raised', 'farm', 'Devon', 'England', 'farm', 'boy', 'Albert', 'Narracott', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'who', 'family', 'farm', 'father', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'mother', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'endure', 'challenging', 'relationship', 'land', 'owner', 'David', 'Lyons', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'first', 'film', 'close', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'young', 'Albert', 'Mr.', 'Lyons', 'other', 'landowners', 'ability', 'use', 'Joey', 'plow', 'challenging', 'plot', 'land', 'soon', 'financially', 'strapped', 'Mr.', 'Narracott', 'Joey', 'Captain', 'Nicols', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'pleas', 'devastated', 'Albert', 'World', 'War', 'many', 'horses', 'local', 'farms', 'are', 'recruited', 'fight', 'now-tattered', 'banner', 'carried', 'Mr.', 'Narracott', 'previous', 'war', 'will', 'be', 'distinguishing', 'artifact', 'identifying', 'Joey', 'perilous', 'adventure', 'begins.The', 'throughbread', 'attracted', 'beautiful', 'black', 'mare', 'who', 'will', 'share', 'many', 'wartime', 'escapades', 'name', 'Topthorn.The', 'two', 'have', 'exhilarating', 'race', 'other', 'part', 'officer', 'basic', 'training.Soon', 'are', 'France', 'facing', 'combat', 'Germans', 'Joey', 'rushes', 'forest', 'sans', 'rider', 'heavy', 'artillery', 'fire', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'German', 'custody', 'Topthorn.The', 'dual', 'equine', 'adventure', 'two', 'brothers', 'Kaiser', 'Army', 'David', 'Kross', 'Leonard', 'Carrow', 'use', 'ill-fated', 'attempt', 'desert.Left', 'windmill', 'brothers', 'are', 'found', 'sickly', 'French', 'orphan', 'named', 'Emilie', 'Celine', 'Buckens', 'who', 'farm', 'where', 'windmill', 'situated', 'grandfather', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', '.Tending', 'horses', 'young', 'girl', 'life', 'was', 'initially', 'able', 'save', 'confiscation', 'when', 'German', 'Army', 'raided', 'farm', 'home', 'food', 'great', 'devastation', 'Emilie', 'shield', 'attempted', 'confiscation', 'Hippie', 'Era', 'slogan', 'War', 'unhealthy', 'children', 'other', 'living', 'things', 'more', 'enough', 'visual', 'emphasis', 'scene.With', 'furlough', 'battle', 'too', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'are', 'made', 'pull', 'heavy', 'German', 'artillery', 'conflict', 'more', 'brutal.Joey', 'will', 'grieve', 'loss', 'gallop', 'around', 'trenches', 'get', 'human', 'madness', 'artillery', 'fire', 'scene', 'one', 'have', 'further', 'regrets', 'how', 'Man', 'shameful', 'inability', 'solve', 'disputes', 'peacefully', 'such', 'terrifying', 'impact', 'living', 'creatures', 'War', 'ultimate', 'stupid', 'human', 'trick', 'brief', 'moment', 'unity', 'when', 'two', 'officers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'conflict', 'help', 'free', 'Joey', 'entanglement', 'barbed', 'time', 'Albert', 'joined', 'conflict', 'odds', 'finding', 'looking', 'Joey', 'moving', 'sense', 'dogged', 'determination.A', 'post', 'Harry-Potter', 'era', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'soldier', 'trenches', 'Liam', 'Cunning', 'Army', 'doctor', 'presiding', 'fateful', 'decision', 'involving', 'Joey.Viewers', 'can', 'learn', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'two-legged', 'four-legged', 'combatants', 'beautiful', 'golden', 'twilight.-A', 'serene', 'solemnly', 'triumphant', 'ending']",N/A

1524488,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0072GPPNC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the children's fiction novel ""War Horse"", a story set during the outbreak of World War I.The book received its film adaptation courtesy of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and screenwriters Lee Hall and Richard Curtis and was released in theaters on Christmas day of 2011 and would earn over $173 million in the box office and in April 2012, the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD.""War Horse"" would reunite Steven Spielberg with the top talents in the film industry such as cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Minority Report""), editor Michael Kahn (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), sound designer Gary Rydstrom (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Minority Report"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") and also reunited Spielberg with legendary composer John Williams (known for creating the soundtracks for the ""Star Wars"" films and ""Harry Potter"" films).The film marks a new beginning for Steven Spielberg.  One, this is the first film in which Spielberg directed a film about a horse as the main character and portraying him at various stages of the horse's life.  The film also marks Spielberg's first time cutting the film digitally.""War Horse"" would go on to earn six Academy Award nominations including ""Best Picture"" and would win the American Film Institute Award for ""Film of the Year 2011'.VIDEO:""War Horse"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:40:1).  When Steven Spielberg brought in cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, you get one of the best in the business.  A man who knows how to capture the shot and in this case, to capture the beauty of Dartmoor but also to capture the essence of peace and serenity via pre-war but also the darkness and fear during the war.  There are wonderful, breathtaking shots that are seen throughout the film with vibrant colors to lush greenery of the area.There is also wonderful detail when it comes to the closeups of the horses and black levels were nice and deep.  I didn't catch any banding, artifacts or any problems with the overall video.  If anything, picture quality for ""War Horse"" is outstanding!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""War Horse"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHZ/24-bit), French 7.1 DTS-HD HR and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  Dialogue is crystal clear and there is amazing use of the surround channels.  From the beginning as Joey is plowing the field to the use of music courtesy of John Williams.  But the film shows how wonderful it could sound via lossless once we get to the war.As one would expect from a film with war scenes, the film is absolutely immersive as you hear machine guns, tanks, cavalries and their horses marching and stomping to bomb blasts via LFE.  There is good use of the rear surround channels and panning through the surround channels and I was quite impressed by how the overall mix was.  ""War Horse"" has an amazing lossless soundtrack!Also, the musical soundtrack is wonderful.  The music is inspired by the serenity of the British landscapes and manages to capture that feel of adventure but also the horse as it goes through its adventures.  John Williams approach was to utilize brass instruments.The brass is the key to the music of ""War Horse"", creating emotion and feeling of the horse trough the ages.  Steven Spielberg said in the booklet notes of William's composition, ""I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by my many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of what you're going to hear.  I'm not sure what I can give John in return, other than a promise of more films to come...for as many more years as we both can imagine!"".Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""War Horse"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:War Horse: The Journey Home - (19:35) Featuring interviews with Steven Spielberg and the cast and a second roundtable interview with the creative team and crew.An Extra's Point of View - (3:06) A featurette about extra Martin D. Dew and his involvement in the film.DISC 2:A Filmmaking Journal - (1:04:13) A more in-depth featurette on the screen adaptation of ""War Horse"", the casting and shooting on location.Editing & Scoring - (8:53) Editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams discuss their involvement with ""War Horse"" and their longtime collaboration with Steven Spielberg.The Sounds of War Horse - (7:13) Gary Rydstrom talks about the sounds of ""War Horse"" and his goal to make the film sound authentic.Through the Producer's Lens - (4:04) Producer Kathleen Kennedy talks about the photos she took on location during the filming of ""War Horse"".EXTRAS:""War Horse"" comes with a slipcover case, two Blu-rays (one for the film and the other for the special features), the DVD version of the film and a digital copy of the feature film.JUDGMENT CALL:""War Horse"" is a film that captures the human spirit but most of all, Steven Spielberg ability to capture the relationship and emotions may it be an animal to an extra-terrestrial, it's one thing that Spielberg has been wonderful in doing.We have seen Spielberg create a heartfelt film with ""E.T."", we have seen him recently capture human and animal relationships through adventures with ""The Adventures of Tin Tin"", but ""War Horse"" is a challenge that the filmmaker was ready to take on.How would you be able to create a film based on a horse?  It's one thing to get the actors to be emotional and caring towards a horse but you have to capture the horse being interested as the actions must seem natural to the viewer.  And sure enough, with amazing trainers, the reactions by Joey the horse as it goes through a lot during its adventures is nothing short of amazing.""War Horse"" is no doubt a collaborative film.  In order to make this film work, you would need a wonderful location, wonderful cinematography, costume and set design, music, sound design and talent and many extras in order to create this sense of dire during World War I.  Characters who come across the horse Joey and eventually are touched by it.  And of course, the trainers responsible in making the horse meet its mark (there are possibly over a hundred of horses used in this film, especially during the war scenes).For one, ""War Horse"" is a gorgeous film.  Spielberg brought in his top guns for this film, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn.  They have had a long working relationship with Spielberg and part of the believability of this film is its look.  From the peaceful pre-war landscapes to the muddy trenches during World War I.  You have the cinematography and editing there, you have the look courtesy of Lee Sandales on set decoration and Joanna Johnston via costume design.  Every soldier on opposing sides have a uniform and you eventually get the sense of how grand this film is.And of course, when it comes to emotion, to help tie the characters to Joey, you have the wonderful music of John Williams.  And also the sound courtesy of sound designer Gary Rydstrom is absolute amazing.  If you are an audiophile, you will literally hear how immersive this lossless soundtrack truly is on Blu-ray.  It's one of the best lossless soundtracks that I have heard on Blu!For the most part, everything came together for this film and I was quite impressed.As for the Blu-ray release, the video and audio is absolutely magnificent.  There are many special features as well on two Blu-ray discs and you also get the DVD and digital copy version of the film with the 4-disc combo pack.Overall, ""War Horse"" is a beautiful, moving and wonderful film capturing a horse and its ability to bring out the human spirit with the many people it comes across.  While it may not be as emotional as Robert Bresson's 1966 film ""Au hasard Balthazar"" nor do we see the cruelty the horse must go through from owner to owner, the film is not about the cruelty of man towards horse.  Nor is ""War Horse"" a war film.  It's about a horse that brings out the human spirit no matter who the owner is or whatever side the horse is being utilized.  The hope of one young man being reunited with his horse and that hope and even a bit of luck exists, even during dire circumstances.Steven Spielberg and his crew once again has done a wonderful job and for those contemplating on this Blu-ray release, it really is magnificent.  Not just the film itself but its presentation, its picture quality and its fantastic lossless soundtrack.""War Horse"" is highly recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""War Horse"" is

1524498,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B0072GPPNC,dv_forever,"[7, 12]","I am not a big admirer of Steven Spielberg overall but I respect his vast technical skills as a filmmaker and I'm always happy to see another of his productions. He hasn't directed a film since 2008's ""Indiana Jones 4"", a movie that got a lot of flak from critics and audiences. I thought it was an entertaining summer adventure film that ultimately didn't capture the magic of the terrific Indy trilogy from the 1980s.Now Spielberg is back with two films that were released in the span of one week in December 2011. I haven't seen ""Adventures of Tintin"" just yet, instead I opted to watch ""War Horse"", the more serious of the two pictures. Spielberg is really going for the classic Hollywood look and feel here. Partially inspired by David Lean with it's Englishness, the main parallel in style would seem to be John Ford. Sweeping vistas, landscapes and the glory and toil of the farm life. The film is also one of the most blatant, emotionally manipulative Spielberg has ever made. Think of E.T. but with a horse and you've got the outline of this film already. John Williams turns in one of his most heart tugging scores. Every little moment and plot point is underpinned by a musical touch to bombard the audience with the message. I didnt enjoy E.T. when I saw it as a child or when I saw it as an adult. I understand that many in the audience do enjoy this kind of manipulation but I'm not one of them. War Horse has the same underlining feel but it's expansive and visually diverse enough to hold one's attention.The cinematography is stunning throughout. Almost too perfect, a kind of postcard quality. The acting is on pitch for every character. The pacing is taut and judicious, the action scenes thrilling. The technical aspects are always A+ with a mature Spielberg movie. The film is very episodic however as we follow the birth and life of ""Joey"", the war horse. Raised on an English farm, then sold to a British captain... Joey is then captured by the Germans, later he finds his way into the life of an elderly man and his granddaughter living on a farm in the French countryside... then recaptured by the Germans which leads to a harrowing escape scene, which is one of the most dramatic sequences in the whole film. Like a present wrapped in a neat ribbon, all comes to a happy conclusion in the end.The film reminded me a little bit of ""Au Hasard Balthasar"" a French film from the early 1960s directed by Robert Bresson. In that film, a donkey is the star and goes through life from one owner to another. It's the human condition as viewed through the eyes of an animal. War Horse has a similar feel to it, as if Joey is suffering humanity's sins, a Christ like figure. Of course Bresson and Spielberg are like night and day. Bresson's film is depressing, heartfelt and honest... Spielberg's film is manipulative and sentimental but exciting. I just make a note of it for audiences... if you want to see another take on this story structure but from a ""high art"" angle, check out ""Au Hasard Balthasar"".Putting negatives aside, I would say that War Horse does it's job and is exactly the kind of film it aspires to be. This is the first WWI movie for Spielberg so that gives him plenty of room to film trench warfare and chaotic battle scenes. All expertly done as one would except from the director of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Don't expect any blood as this is a strictly PG-13 portrayal of the conflict. Ultimately I don't think that War Horse will be remembered as a Spielberg classic in years to come but it's a solid picture in the crowded holiday marketplace and worthy of your time and money.",3,"Spielberg is just as sappy and sentimental as he's always been.

1524531,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0072GPPNC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","There are many detractors for this very long (146 minutes) film, complaining that it is too emotional, too melodramatic, too 'Lassie Come Home', to over the top as a tearjerker, too Steven Speilberg and John Williams, et cetera. Well, it has all those elements but depending on the emotional vulnerability of the viewer the film can easily become a catharsis during this period of time when very little makes sense and the need for positive input into matters of the heart has rarely been more keen. Not having seen the stage play based on the book of the same name by acclaimed children's writer Michael Morpurgo, adapted for stage by Nick Stafford, this viewer is at a disadvantage in judging the story alone as here it is enhanced by gorgeous cinematography and amazingly realistic battle scenes. Lee Hall and Richard Curtis created the screenplay and seem to have allowed a proscenium stage story to expand into the spaces a play can only describe, and Steven Spielberg has taken it from there.The time of the story in set in Devon, England. To his wife Rose's (Emily Watson) dismay war injured and silenced farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan)  buys a thoroughbred horse rather than a plough animal that might save their leased farm form landowner Lyons (David Thewlis), but when his teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains the horse and calls him Joey, the two becoming inseparable, Albert does indeed manage to train Joey how to plough fields. When his harvest fails due to rain, Ted has to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I the British cavalry and he is shipped to France. After a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed in a scene between a British soldier and a German soldier that is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Joey is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey. However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off. The results of the final auction seals the fate of the extraordinary lad and horse relationship in a most touching way.There are many, many cameo roles in the film that though brief are extremely well delivered: Niels Arestrup is the wise grandfather to the young Emilie (Celine Buckens) who rescues Joey for a while; Toby Kebbell is excellent as Geordie Soldier as is David Kross as the kind German soldier Gunther whose younger brother Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) he protects, and Hinnerk Sch&ouml;nemann shines as the German solder who helps rescue Joey from the barbed wire in No Man's Land. Leonard Carow, Matt Milne, Robert Emms, and Eddie Marsan are likewise memorable.The breathtaking cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the at times lugubrious musical score is by longtime Spielberg associate, composer John Williams. The story aims for the heart and finds its mark - and there is nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps this film is much needed right now.

It's a DreamWorks film, and all of the studio's live action films are released by Walt Disney Pictures.The film combines elements of the book and the stage production, but unlike the other versions, it is not told completely from the viewpoint of Joey, the horse, whose literal narration would not work as well in a film -- but the skill of the trainer, horse and director bring out remarkable ""acting"" in the lead equestrianWar Horse the movie is perhaps the most Disneyesque motion picture to come from director Spielberg. Especially in its opening segment, taking place in the rugged, breathtaking landscape of Devon and recalling the Disney sagas of yore such as The Three Lives of Thomasina, Darby O' Gill and especially the films Walt Disney produced entirely in the U.K.It's very intense at times, since it is a war film, but the war scenes are heavy on spectacle and light on gore. The most difficult scene to watch, at least in our house, was the fate of the two very young German soldiers, which takes place on camera (and shot in a very evocative way at sunrise in the face of a windmill).Every shot of War Horse is an experience in expert composition, art direction, authenticity and often understated acting. Spielberg, as seen in the very generous bonus materials, is an extremely collaborative filmmaker and knows how to best utilize the finest talent in front and behind the lens, from the superb cast to the stirring music of longtime collaborator John Williams.Rather than have an audio commentary or a simultaneous online compliment to the film itself, the second disc in this four-disc combo is loaded with background material, including a feature length documentary about the making of the film and several shorter items about specific collaborators. Spielberg himself hosts a short round table on camera with members of the cast and crew.Storywise, War Horse suggests an earlier British children's classic, Black Beauty, in that is chronicles the various owners, friends and foes of one particular horse, with a grand coincidence to tie it together. I have to say -- without a trace of irony or sarcasm -- that it also reminds me, in part, of the song ""Snoopy's Christmas,"" in which the WWI Flying Ace and the Red Baron suspend their deadly battle for a brief time because of a shared affinity (you'll know which scene I'm referring to if you saw the film already).Since Spielberg and his creative team has meticulously crafted such a sweeping, magnificent film, it follows that it's particularly nice to see it on Blu-ray, which brings out every crag in the rugged countryside and the sheer size of the battle scenes, as well as some very lovely moments at a French country home.This is the kind of movie that folks say isn't made anymore and can be a rich experience to share with family and friends.",5,"""What did you do in the war, Horsey?""",1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3043,"['War', 'Horse', 'started', 'children', 'novel', '1982', 'more', 'recently', 'became', 'acclaimed', 'stage', 'show', 'BBC', 'radio', 'drama', 'course', 'full', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'treatment', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'epic', 'DreamWorks', 'film', 'studio', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures.The', 'film', 'combines', 'elements', 'book', 'stage', 'production', 'other', 'versions', 'not', 'told', 'completely', 'viewpoint', 'Joey', 'horse', 'literal', 'narration', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'skill', 'trainer', 'horse', 'director', 'bring', 'out', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'lead', 'equestrianWar', 'Horse', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'most', 'Disneyesque', 'motion', 'picture', 'come', 'director', 'Spielberg', 'Especially', 'opening', 'segment', 'taking', 'place', 'rugged', 'breathtaking', 'landscape', 'Devon', 'recalling', 'Disney', 'sagas', 'yore', 'such', 'Three', 'Lives', 'Thomasina', 'Darby', 'O', 'Gill', 'especially', 'films', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'produced', 'entirely', 'U.K.It', 'very', 'intense', 'times', 'war', 'film', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'heavy', 'spectacle', 'light', 'gore', 'most', 'difficult', 'scene', 'watch', 'least', 'house', 'was', 'fate', 'two', 'very', 'young', 'German', 'soldiers', 'place', 'camera', 'shot', 'very', 'evocative', 'way', 'sunrise', 'face', 'windmill', '.Every', 'shot', 'War', 'Horse', 'experience', 'expert', 'composition', 'art', 'direction', 'authenticity', 'often', 'understated', 'acting', 'Spielberg', 'seen', 'very', 'generous', 'bonus', 'materials', 'extremely', 'collaborative', 'filmmaker', 'how', 'best', 'utilize', 'finest', 'talent', 'front', 'lens', 'superb', 'cast', 'stirring', 'music', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'John', 'Williams.Rather', 'have', 'audio', 'commentary', 'simultaneous', 'online', 'compliment', 'film', 'second', 'disc', 'four-disc', 'combo', 'loaded', 'background', 'material', 'including', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'several', 'shorter', 'items', 'specific', 'collaborators', 'Spielberg', 'short', 'round', 'table', 'camera', 'members', 'cast', 'crew.Storywise', 'War', 'Horse', 'earlier', 'British', 'children', 'classic', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'various', 'owners', 'friends', 'foes', 'one', 'particular', 'horse', 'grand', 'coincidence', 'tie', 'together', 'have', 'say', 'trace', 'irony', 'sarcasm', 'also', 'part', 'song', 'Snoopy', 'Christmas', 'WWI', 'Flying', 'Ace', 'Red', 'Baron', 'suspend', 'deadly', 'battle', 'brief', 'time', 'shared', 'affinity', ""'ll"", 'know', 'scene', ""'m"", 'referring', 'saw', 'film', 'already', '.Since', 'Spielberg', 'creative', 'team', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'sweeping', 'magnificent', 'film', 'particularly', 'nice', 'see', 'Blu-ray', 'out', 'crag', 'rugged', 'countryside', 'sheer', 'size', 'battle', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'lovely', 'moments', 'French', 'country', 'home.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'folks', 'say', ""n't"", 'made', 'anymore', 'can', 'be', 'rich', 'experience', 'share', 'family', 'friends']",N/A

Teslovich,"[8, 27]","An overbearing lack of attention to detail and facts by the writers and directors made the farming and horse behaviors seem more Hollywood and NY fictional than real world. The animal (Joey) deserved a lot more honest attention and quality writing.Positive:Costumes.Negatives: A few of the film fantasies.(1.) The movie would have benefited from showing how challenging it is to train a wild animal even from an experienced trainer. The one trick scene of the human not showing predator eyes did not do training a horse any justice.(2.) The first scenes showed a heavily stone strewn field for the horse to pull through which for a first time collar use would have bloodied the animal especially after 12+ straight hours. The stones would have broken the iron plow and probably injured the animal. The larger stones should have been picked out first. That's why the adjoining house and walls are made of stone.(3.) The continual hand broadcasting of handfuls of turnip seeds into a small areas is wasteful and not why the furrows were created.(4.) A son being shown his father's war medals for the first time at age 17 didn't make any sense. Father was simplistically portrayed as distant and cold.(5.) The portrayal of the Germans, for the most part, as ruthless killers stretched credulity. Even the reversal of roles in saving the horse was too Hollywood - bolt cutters anyone.(6.) The french farm girl, Emilie,  while farming was wearing a hair bow, makeup and a perfectly clean dress. The perfect English made her seem more actress than farm girl. That she had never ridden before yet gallops off across fields on her first try is not real. If she doesn't fall the horse would sense an inexperienced rider and throw her. Her death was a wasted storyline. As well as still  another horse auction with her grandfather showing up to bid what would have been a fortune. Just bizarre storytelling and movie editing.(7.) The tank chasing after and projectiles exploding around Joey was just visual fictional cheapening of the animal. A director whose first priority is his own filming recognition.(8.) Final scene of the horse and trainer just happening to be in the same medical staging area was far fetched. And, in his blinded condition, the trainer knew that the horse's markings were covered by mud. That Joey didn't approach his trainer in a natural horse-to-trainer manner didn't look right.(9.) Presenting WWI as trenches, barbed wire and muddy landscape is as old as movies have been around. I've seen the same barbed wire and sand bags for the past 90 years. You would think there would be a lot more to that war.

On the other hand, the characters are underdeveloped, and there's no resolution to the initial problem with the landlord. It's long, but not long enough. And the stories never intersect with each other with Joey being the sole focus of the film. Not a bad idea in principal, but in theory, it doesn't work. The film should have shown Emilie at the end with her grandfather, Joey and the Narracott family.  And the score by John Williams was powerful as always. A comeuppance for the landlord's arrogant (and apparently womanizing) son should have been shown, along with a romance for the young Narracott boy.The finale, though, was beautifully filmed.

He took a long-loved youth's book written in 1982, and transformed it into a film so beautiful it reminded me of the English Countryside painter Thomas Gainsborough 18th century. Having been educated to teach visual art, I was captivated with the continual perfection of composition of very scene, seemingly every frame. I am an avid British film/TV viewer, but `War Horse' cinematography meets the highest of anything I have seen to date. The period sets, scenery, and costuming are perfection transforming the viewer into a time capsule of 1914 to the end of WWI. Stunning aesthetic mastery.Janusz Kaminski must get some credit with Spielberg for the cinematography perfection.I did read the book first and was confident (viewing the film proved me correct) that Spielberg would be true to the book. It's about as close as a film can get to a book. Being a shorter book, written for ages 11-13 originally, and the movie length (146 min) helped provide all of the needed key points of the story of the amazing red bay Joey. One could say plenty about the fine acting but it is the story, and the compelling adventures of the horse, told through the view-point of Joey (akin to Black Beauty) that makes this a must see, and once available, for me will be a MUST OWN.The viewer literally rides through all kinds of situations, some heart wrenching, some heart stopping, some heart breaking, some heartache, while others end heart warming. Is it the horse that has all the heart and pours out from the screen; or is it the mastery of another Steven Spielberg directing/producing production that makes your pulse rise and fall in alarming changes? This is the first film in many a year that actually left me on the brink of tears. The end was so stunning that my wife and I could not move, could not get up and leave during the credits, and that was a plus since the credits footage contain some beautiful music that revives one's spirit after such an experience.Yes, there is warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately. But even the battles were so beautifully filmed.

The visual strength of some scenes overcomes my little inner man's protests: this is kitsch, man! He says without much conviction that he can make me listen.Albert, a teen in Devon, raises a horse and they become best friends, on a struggling farm. Against all odds, the horse even agrees to pull the plough. Alas, dad drinks and needs to sell the horse to pay the rent. Horse ends up in English cavallery, then WW1 starts, the Brits attack a German position on horse back (outrageous idea), horse gets confiscated by the huns, stolen by a deserter, briefly repossessed by a French farmer's teen granddaughter, confiscated again by the huns, coerced into forced labor pulling artillery.In the meantime, Albert has grown up and is a trench soldier.

The first part of the story lasts the longest, but unfortunately contains, in my opinion, the poorest acting--Jeremy Irvine playing the main (human)character. He has a primary expression that he uses over and over again, he seems overly earnest and naive, and I never quite felt the feeling that he had for his horse. David Thewlis is a hoot as the landlord and it is a treat to see several other well known British/Irish actors.  Their parts,however,are so small that they are on the screen one minute and gone the next.  Tom Hiddleston is very good as the British officer who initially buys the horse.  His voice and  facial expressions convey the fear mixed with resolve of someone who is going to battle.  Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Kennedy, Liam Cunningham, Julian Wadham, Eddie Marsan and Pip Torrens all make brief appearances. The other main character, of course, is the horse.  I felt for the horse in the scenes where he is overworked and in the scene where he is caught in the wire, but the shots where he is a ""hero"" seem a bit forced and phony.  There is one scene where a British soldier and a German soldier come together to help the horse, and this scene is very well written and performed, if you can believe that it would actually happen in the first place.  Be prepared to suspend belief for many other scenes (German soldiers who speak flawless English--to each other even!,horses who apparently calming and quietly climb stairs in a cottage, the grandfather who hears about the ""miracle horse"" and somehow travels many miles and has a lot of money to buy it, an untrained horse who plows a huge, rock-filled field, a girl who gallops over a hill and supposedly runs into many German troops--what she couldn't hear them on the other side of the hill?, a horse that gallops through trenches filled with men--weren't war time trenches zig-zagged, by the way?) Although some scenes where hardened soldiers feel tender toward the horses are touching, many other scenes are so overly sentimental that they are cringe worthy (they have crowds of people standing around with gaping mouths and, of course, maudlin music in the background). In the end, War Horse is an okay movie, but I would suggest renting it or checking it out of the library.

Even though 'Hugo' was another great film, War Horse clearly won Best Cinematography in my book! This film really is a big Old Fashioned picture with actual characters that are not cardboard thin! The Sound is very great, the battle scenes take full advantage of all the speakers! The music by John Williams is very moving! It seems that they followed the strategy from E.T. by letting the music score breathe and add the film later! It makes one of the most moving and powerful endings like the end of E.T.! On all technical points: Acting, Photography, Story, Editing, this film is a powerful experience. It is clearly on the top lists of 'Horse' movies! Spielberg is really maturing as a film maker.I am deeply hurt by the negative reviews I have seen! ""Dull"" ""Boring"" It proves to me how corrupted the movie going audience has become. I think they should flick their 600 tv channels while they play with their cell phone menus.

As the young horse and young man grow up together they see each other often but the colt is indifferent to Albert's attentions.  Albert's alcoholic father goes to a horse auction in the village and gets in a bidding war with the landlord of his farm.  He overbids and buys the colt as a plow horse even though he is a thoroughbred.  Now after overpaying for the horse they are unable to pay the rent on the farm and face eviction by the domineering landlord.Albert tells is mom and dad that he will train and break the horse and help to use it to save the farm.  Albert names the horse Joey and an unbreakable bond is made between Albert and Joey.  Albert trains Joey to plow a rocky field to help save the farm as they have committed to plant turnips and pay the landlord his rent or be evicted.  After a major rainstorm and the loss of the crop, Albert's father sells Joey to the English Cavalry as WW I is just starting.Joey is off to war and Albert is heartbroken that he has lost his horse and his friend. Albert is to young to join the army but a short time later, Albert is in the army fighting in the hell of WW I and trench warfare over no-man's land...This movie is a wonderful and terrifying story about the bond between a man and his horse and the horrors of WW I.  Both fight to survive the cruelties of war and Albert's never ending search to find his prized horse are heart warming.  Both man and beast suffer terribly during the war and this movie brings forth the story of never giving up and finding your dream.While the book is touted as a children's story the movie is rated PG-13 and contains graphic violence and cruelty.  Just be aware of this if you want to watch this with younger children. Millions died fighting WW I and the movie pulls no punches while filming the horrible aspects of trench warfare and the use of artillery, machine guns and poisonous gas.

1524575,A245AST0T0AZTJ,B0072GPPNC,J. Lindner,"[11, 14]","I just saw this movie last night.  It was a very fine movie.  It tells the story of a thoroughbred horse who never really was able to live his life as a thoroughbred horse should.  Instead of racing he was made to plow fields.  Instead of living a life with other thoroughbreds, he gets shipped off to the horrors of World War One.  But joey, the horse, is a survivor and a leader.  He is quick to learn how to plow a field and then is quick to learn how to perform in a cavalry charge in the face of machine guns.  He then shows the other horses how to pull artillery through muddy fields.  The only thing this horse never learns is how to jump.The inability to jump leads the horse to become entangled in barbed wire which then leads to a rather unlikely peaceful meeting between a British and a German soldier as they try to untangle Joey.  They are successful and Joey somehow avoids the mercy bullet of the matter-of-fact sergeant.  But the entire movie shows how Joey's most remarkable character trait consistently reappears, his ability to win over the admiration of those around him.Joey first won the respect of Ted, a farmer and former soldier of earlier conflicts.  He then won over Albert, Ted's son.  In succession Joey wins the love of a cavalry officer, a German deserter, a young local girl, another war horse, another German soldier, and eventually two opposing armies in the field.  Through it all he wins the hearts of everyone in the movie theater.Steven Spielberg did his usual fine job of directing a cast of newcomers and no-names to create a film worthy of Best Picture nomination.  It did not win the Academy Award, but it is still an excellent movie well worth the time it takes to watch it.  It shows the horros of World War One and how an animal can be the main character of a major motion picture.

Very often, though,  I feel as if he's being too crafty, too manipulative, and too obvious.  Take, for example (spoiler alert!), the happy ending of ""War Horse.""  I felt like saying, ""Jeez... ease up a bit, Steven,"" when he set it against a spectacular, melting, water color sunset... just in case, maybe, some in the audience might not get that it was, in fact, a happy ending.I also have at least one or two other bones to pick with ""War Horse.""  I thought Mr. Spielberg clearly trivialized and glossed over the unprecedented brutality of WWI, just for the sake of the feel-good story he wanted to tell.  And it was an insult to my intelligence that he asked the audience to believe that gassed, maimed and psychologically ravaged soldiers (from both sides) would be able to shove all those horrors into some corner of their consciousnesses just to care about the plight of a horse.  Sorry... that was a bit too much artistic license for my tastes.Nevertheless, I have to admit that from the opening scenes, I cared about and rooted for Joey (the name of the war horse). But, then, I believe that was because I'm into horses... not due to any movie-making skills that Mr. Spielberg may or may not possess.

It's easy to imagine it being a John Ford film or, because of the way Spielberg treats each frame like a canvas, perhaps a film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The use of color, the story, and even the score hearken back to Old Hollywood, but the story has all the elements of a Hallmark film and that's what ultimately restrains it. The story, while epic in scope, is nothing we haven't seen before. In fact, we've seen it done thousands of times. If released in the 1940s, War Horse would be hailed as a masterpiece. Now, it's just an extraordinarily well-made film with familiar story arcs and motifs; an idealistic fairy tale set during WWI that is crowd-pleasing, uplifting, sentimental, and sappy. The heavy drama is kept contained, let loose just enough to tug at the heartstrings of the audience. This could have been a failure of unfathomable proportions, but Spielberg is too talented a filmmaker to allow that. Here, he's made an old-fashioned tearjerker that works incredibly despite reeking of familiarity.Based on a children's book by Michael Morpurgo, the film is essentially told from the perspective of Joey, the thoroughbred horse of the title. Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a farmer, buys the horse at an auction for 30 guineas, intending to use him as a plough horse. His decision also stems from spite, as his landlord Lyons (David Thewlis) attempted to outbid him on the horse. Now, Ted is unable to pay rent to Lyons. Ted's son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) names the horse Joey and begins training it for the plough. Soon, with WWI looming and in imminent danger of losing their farm, Ted sells Joey to a young soldier, with Albert promising the horse that they will see each other again. The film follows Joey as he drifts from owner to owner, separated from each new one by the tragedies of war. The people who inherit him are the kind-hearted stock characters you expect to find in such a blood-soaked timeframe.Alas, sometimes breaking new ground is not necessary in telling a good, albeit familiar story. Be aware that War Horse is quite heavy on the sap, going for easy emotional sentiment that has worked with audiences consistently for years. It takes no risks, does nothing we haven't seen before; but even at its most eye-rolling, generic moments it comes together wonderfully. At nearly 2 hours, it moves quickly and the stock characters give you something to immediately latch onto. Furthermore, while it's rooted heavily in drama, there are some intensely exciting (horse-related) sequences. The scene where Joey gallops through a warzone, ending up trapped in no-man's land may be one of the most thrilling sequences Spielberg has ever filmed.It really is too strong an achievement to dismiss. Predictable it may be, even with that needless, last-minute dramatic conflict, it's a hard film not to enjoy. While the cynic in me tried to fight it, the film did bring me close to tears and I have to applaud Spielberg for trying to tell these classic, cinematic stories while maintaining the feel of them. Some will complain that the film is too generic; expecting more from Spielberg, but it also may become one of those family-friendly movies that achieve ""classic status"" among suburban America. It's great entertainment, exquisitely made and nostalgic. While it follows a predictable path, War Horse has plenty of heart and feels commandeered from a long-gone era of films and filmmaking. For this, I both admire and respect it. In many ways, it's one of the most congenial films of 2011.GRADE: A-",5,A Tearjerker That Hearkens Back to Old Hollywood,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,3625,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Horse', 'boat', 'being', 'masterpiece', '70', 'years', 'easy', 'imagine', 'being', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'frame', 'canvas', 'perhaps', 'film', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'Emeric', 'Pressburger', 'use', 'color', 'story', 'even', 'score', 'hearken', 'back', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'elements', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'what', 'ultimately', 'story', 'epic', 'scope', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'thousands', 'times', 'released', '1940s', 'War', 'Horse', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'masterpiece', 'Now', 'just', 'extraordinarily', 'well-made', 'film', 'familiar', 'story', 'arcs', 'motifs', 'idealistic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'set', 'WWI', 'crowd-pleasing', 'uplifting', 'sentimental', 'sappy', 'heavy', 'drama', 'kept', 'contained', 'let', 'loose', 'just', 'enough', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'audience', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'failure', 'unfathomable', 'proportions', 'Spielberg', 'too', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'allow', 'Here', 'made', 'old-fashioned', 'tearjerker', 'incredibly', 'reeking', 'familiarity.Based', 'children', 'book', 'Michael', 'Morpurgo', 'film', 'essentially', 'told', 'perspective', 'Joey', 'thoroughbred', 'horse', 'title', 'Ted', 'Narracott', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'farmer', 'horse', 'auction', '30', 'guineas', 'intending', 'use', 'plough', 'horse', 'decision', 'also', 'spite', 'landlord', 'Lyons', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'attempted', 'outbid', 'horse', 'Now', 'Ted', 'unable', 'pay', 'rent', 'Lyons', 'Ted', 'son', 'Albert', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'horse', 'Joey', 'training', 'plough', 'Soon', 'WWI', 'looming', 'imminent', 'danger', 'losing', 'farm', 'Ted', 'Joey', 'young', 'soldier', 'Albert', 'promising', 'horse', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'film', 'Joey', 'owner', 'owner', 'separated', 'new', 'one', 'tragedies', 'war', 'people', 'who', 'inherit', 'are', 'kind-hearted', 'stock', 'characters', 'expect', 'find', 'such', 'blood-soaked', 'timeframe.Alas', 'sometimes', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'not', 'necessary', 'telling', 'good', 'familiar', 'story', 'Be', 'aware', 'War', 'Horse', 'quite', 'heavy', 'sap', 'going', 'easy', 'emotional', 'sentiment', 'worked', 'audiences', 'consistently', 'years', 'risks', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'even', 'most', 'eye-rolling', 'generic', 'moments', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'quickly', 'stock', 'characters', 'give', 'something', 'immediately', 'latch', 'Furthermore', 'rooted', 'heavily', 'drama', 'are', 'intensely', 'exciting', 'horse-related', 'sequences', 'scene', 'where', 'Joey', 'warzone', 'ending', 'up', 'trapped', 'no-man', 'land', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'sequences', 'Spielberg', 'ever', 'filmed.It', 'really', 'too', 'strong', 'achievement', 'dismiss', 'Predictable', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'needless', 'last-minute', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'hard', 'film', 'not', 'enjoy', 'cynic', 'tried', 'fight', 'film', 'did', 'bring', 'close', 'tears', 'have', 'applaud', 'Spielberg', 'trying', 'tell', 'classic', 'cinematic', 'stories', 'maintaining', 'feel', 'will', 'complain', 'film', 'too', 'generic', 'expecting', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'also', 'may', 'become', 'one', 'family-friendly', 'movies', 'achieve', 'classic', 'status', 'suburban', 'America', 'great', 'entertainment', 'exquisitely', 'made', 'nostalgic', 'predictable', 'path', 'War', 'Horse', 'plenty', 'heart', 'feels', 'commandeered', 'long-gone', 'era', 'films', 'filmmaking', 'admire', 'respect', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'congenial', 'films', '2011.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (based on Michael Morpurgo's novel & the play) by Richard Curtis & Lee Hall is brilliant.The music by John Williams is brilliant. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is brilliant. The film editing by Michael Kahn is brilliant. The casting by Jina Jay is brilliant. The production design by Rick Carter is brilliant. The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow, Alastair Bullock, Molly Hughes, Kevin Jenkins, Neil Lamont & Gary Tomkins is brilliant. The set decoration by Lee Sandales is brilliant. The costume design by Joanna Johnston is brilliant. The make-up design by Lois Burwell is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Ben Morris & the special effects supervised by Neil Corbould is brilliant.This is a beautifully, well-crafted and well-made film that is also well-paced and emotionally well-acted. This is also a different film that nobody has done or seen in a while, different even for Spielberg, which is brilliant. This is also a film that will keep you entertained after the movie ends. This is one of the best films of last year (of the Christmas holiday season, as well) and of Spielberg's resume.",5,"""War Horse"" is brilliant!",1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1705,"['War', 'Horse', 'brilliant', 'how', 'story', 'friendship', 'horse', 'named', 'Joey', 'young', 'man', 'called', 'Albert', 'who', 'When', 'are', 'forcefully', 'parted', 'horse', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'changing', 'inspiring', 'lives', 'British', 'cavalry', 'German', 'soldiers', 'French', 'farmer', 'granddaughter.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Rose', 'Narracott', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'Ted', 'Narracott', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'Albert', 'Narracott', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Michael', 'Morpurgo', 'novel', 'play', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Lee', 'Hall', 'brilliant.The', 'music', 'John', 'Williams', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'brilliant', 'film', 'editing', 'Michael', 'Kahn', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'Jina', 'Jay', 'brilliant', 'production', 'design', 'Rick', 'Carter', 'brilliant', 'art', 'direction', 'Andrew', 'Ackland-Snow', 'Alastair', 'Bullock', 'Molly', 'Hughes', 'Kevin', 'Jenkins', 'Neil', 'Lamont', 'Gary', 'Tomkins', 'brilliant', 'set', 'decoration', 'Lee', 'Sandales', 'brilliant', 'costume', 'design', 'Joanna', 'Johnston', 'brilliant', 'make-up', 'design', 'Lois', 'Burwell', 'brilliant', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Ben', 'Morris', 'special', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Neil', 'Corbould', 'brilliant.This', 'beautifully', 'well-crafted', 'well-made', 'film', 'also', 'well-paced', 'emotionally', 'well-acted', 'also', 'different', 'film', 'nobody', 'done', 'seen', 'while', 'different', 'even', 'Spielberg', 'brilliant', 'also', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Spielberg', 'resume']",N/A

I loved many moments of War Horse; the horse is indeed magnificent, and some of the acting is very good. But holy cow is this overblown.Spielberg is so good at tugging heart strings by now that it often feels manipulative. The overuse of filters and fey lighting effects to evoke precisely the emotion he wants out of you is starting to feel more and more cheesy, never more so than in some scenes here. It's just way too in your face and obvious, without the subtleties that make a truly great film.And nothing is more overblown here than the music, which is by far Williams' most over the top, saccharine score. The man is a genius, no doubt, but you would never hear Herrman or Morricone stooping to such obvious cues as some of these. His music often telegraphs what we're supposed to feel way before the script and actors do, and I hate that sort of manipulation, even from a master. Or perhaps particularly from a master.And while most of the acting is at least solid, the only role that leaps to majestic life, besides the horse's, is Niestrup's. That guy can act! I really felt him, in the close way that Spielberg wants us to feel everyone here. But he's the only guy who underplays enough to compensate for SS's overblown everything else. Very nicely done, sir.All in all, War Horse is 20 or 30 minutes too long, and just too cheesy to be as great as it very clearly wants to be. But, I love its love for animals (though animal and especially horse lovers, be warned: there are more animals killed here than will be comfortable for most), and its heart is certainly in the right place.But while the blu-ray transfer is very fine, there are few extras, mainly a 20-minute interview bit with SS and longtime co-workers, wherein many of them look very uncomfortable and wondering why they have to sit there while Steve coaxes something quotable from them, and, failing that, speaks for them (as they wince mildly, reminding themselves that this is Spielberg after all, and future work with The Master means putting up with such cheese).But then as Monty Python reminds us, blessed are the cheesemakers, andat this point in his career there are no directors of fine dairy cinema who can hold a tallow candle to Steven Spielberg, master manipulator and artisanal cheese purveyor.",3,A fine slice of Spielberg cheddar,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,2355,"['3.5', 'starsSpielberg', 'Disneyfied', 'war', 'film', 'sums', 'one', 'up', 'loved', 'many', 'moments', 'War', 'Horse', 'horse', 'indeed', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'holy', 'cow', 'overblown.Spielberg', 'so', 'good', 'tugging', 'heart', 'strings', 'now', 'often', 'manipulative', 'overuse', 'filters', 'fey', 'lighting', 'effects', 'evoke', 'precisely', 'emotion', 'starting', 'feel', 'more', 'more', 'cheesy', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'scenes', 'here', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'face', 'obvious', 'subtleties', 'make', 'truly', 'great', 'film.And', 'nothing', 'more', 'here', 'music', 'far', 'Williams', 'most', 'top', 'saccharine', 'score', 'man', 'genius', 'doubt', 'would', 'never', 'hear', 'Herrman', 'Morricone', 'stooping', 'such', 'obvious', 'cues', 'music', 'often', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'way', 'script', 'actors', 'do', 'hate', 'sort', 'manipulation', 'even', 'master', 'perhaps', 'particularly', 'master.And', 'most', 'acting', 'least', 'solid', 'only', 'role', 'majestic', 'life', 'horse', 'Niestrup', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'really', 'felt', 'close', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'feel', 'everyone', 'here', 'only', 'guy', 'who', 'enough', 'compensate', 'SS', 'overblown', 'everything', 'else', 'Very', 'nicely', 'done', 'sir.All', 'War', 'Horse', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'too', 'cheesy', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'very', 'clearly', 'be', 'love', 'love', 'animals', 'animal', 'especially', 'horse', 'lovers', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'more', 'animals', 'killed', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'comfortable', 'most', 'heart', 'certainly', 'right', 'place.But', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'very', 'fine', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'mainly', '20-minute', 'interview', 'bit', 'SS', 'longtime', 'co-workers', 'wherein', 'many', 'look', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'wondering', 'why', 'have', 'sit', 'there', 'Steve', 'coaxes', 'something', 'quotable', 'failing', 'speaks', 'wince', 'mildly', 'reminding', 'Spielberg', 'future', 'work', 'Master', 'putting', 'up', 'such', 'cheese', '.But', 'then', 'Monty', 'Python', 'blessed', 'are', 'cheesemakers', 'andat', 'point', 'career', 'are', 'directors', 'fine', 'dairy', 'cinema', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'tallow', 'candle', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'master', 'manipulator', 'artisanal', 'cheese', 'purveyor']",N/A

The last 20 minutes of the film, although reminiscent of `Gone With The Wind' and `The Wizard of Oz', are amazingly touching in the Spielbergian way - but the rest f the two hours....yawn. With a lot of long shots, a lot of green-screens and a lot of `what's this story about', going on in my head...I was disappointed.Starring a relatively unknown cast it's the story of a young man (Jeremy Irvine of BBC TV's `Life Bites') meeting, gaining and growing up with `Joey' a beautiful thoroughbred horse with a distinctive white marking on its head. His mother and father (Emily Watson of `Corpse Bride' and `Red Dragon' and Peter Mullan of `Braveheart' and `Trainspotting') having a small farm and WWI looming around the corner end up selling this horse to the British war efforts. This same horse ends up being a surviving `hero' and helping, loading and lifting the spirits of various aspects of what WWI did to the English countryside families and their homes.There are some really great scenes, especially between a German soldier and a British soldier trying to free Joey from an incredibly filmed escape scene where the horse literally runs through barbed wired fences and traps himself. Amazing stunt work in this sequence.All-in-all it ends in the Spielbergian way that's obviously meant to grab yoru heartstrings - however - it is a little clich&eacute; for me. And, the photography seemed artificial - noticeable - almost unreal in parts. It just distracted me. I would suggest seeing other far more entertaining and better done films like `Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' or `The Muppets' before this one!

1524627,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B0072GPPNC,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[46, 57]","More recently  as Steven Spielberg has become a more active producer, his directing credits are becoming less common.In 2011 he produced the brillantSuper 8, one of my favorites, directed by JJ Abrams, the creator, writer and occasional director of Lost, and the recent Star trek. Super 8 is a great nostalgia piece evoking the early eighties, a movie within a movie, and an homage to Spielberg's earliest movies. Spielberg also produced Cowboys and Aliens, a somewhat weird meshing of two genres.Now with Warhorse Spielberg directs, and shows his masterful touches throughout. In fact, if you are like me you can see traces of many great movies of the past. The early portions of the movies showing English countryside scenes, and the musical soundtrack of John Williams are reminiscent of John Ford's The Quiet Man. Trench warfare scenes are reminiscent of that all time classic All Quiet on the Western Front. Incidents relating to deserting soldiers are thematically reminiscent of Kubrick's Paths of Glory.War, as bad as it is, somehow seems worse when an innocent animal is involved, which ultimately makes Warhorse the ultimate anti war polemic. And we have a love story between a young boy Albert, and a horse named Joey. As the movie begins we see the horse being born.Later Albert's alcoholic father instead of buying a proper plough horse, foolishly pits himself agaainst his own landlord in bidding for the flash horse Joey, instead of a huge Clydesdale, making his tenancy precarious, and imperiling his families limited fortunes. Joey faces many trials and tribulations adjusting to the plough. Here we have a wonderful perforamnce from Emily Watson as the mother, cruelly snubbed during awards season.When the war happens the father impulsively sells the horse to the military, despite Albert's protests. Albert, understandably distressed, too young to join the military, vows to be reunited with Joey. Meanwhile Joey goes to the front, and we have a poignant scene with his new owner. He and another horse escape the war briefly, and are adopted by a teenage girl. It's not long before the war interferes again, and Joey has a series of adventures.My favorite scene is when he gets trapped in No Mans land, and both sides have to cooperate to free him. I loved the wire clippers flying scene. I also loved the sub story about the two young German brothers, and the parallel structure about how the British deal with a similar situation.Ultimately the horse is a silent witness to the horror of war, becoming an effective storytelling metaphor.Later in the movie one scene I thought was a little overdone, the moment of blindfold recognition. I like to feel emotions in a movie, but not to have them evoked in a contrived way.Warhorse certainly deserves to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, yet I cannot help thinking that actors who vote for awards would prefer as I do to have the story centered around a human character. Nevetheless, when I was a child or young teen I loved watching movies like this, particularly Lassie Goes to war.Another movie I recommend if you don't mind subtitles is the French movieA Very Long Engagement (English Subtitled), starring Audrey Tautou, and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard. A girl seeks her boyfriend believed killed by being sent over the trench deliberately into no mans land for breaking military regulations. It has huge parallels with Warhorse except the protagonists are human, and also operates as a polemic. A beautifully filmed touching love story set against the war.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,A long faced look at war,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,3614,"['More', 'recently', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'become', 'more', 'active', 'producer', 'directing', 'credits', 'are', 'becoming', 'less', 'common.In', '2011', 'produced', 'brillantSuper', '8', 'one', 'favorites', 'directed', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'writer', 'occasional', 'director', 'Lost', 'recent', 'Star', 'trek', 'Super', '8', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'piece', 'evoking', 'early', 'eighties', 'movie', 'movie', 'homage', 'Spielberg', 'earliest', 'movies', 'Spielberg', 'also', 'produced', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'somewhat', 'weird', 'meshing', 'two', 'genres.Now', 'Warhorse', 'Spielberg', 'directs', 'masterful', 'touches', 'fact', 'are', 'can', 'see', 'traces', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'past', 'early', 'portions', 'movies', 'showing', 'English', 'countryside', 'scenes', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Williams', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Ford', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Trench', 'warfare', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'time', 'classic', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Incidents', 'relating', 'deserting', 'soldiers', 'are', 'thematically', 'reminiscent', 'Kubrick', 'Paths', 'Glory.War', 'as', 'bad', 'somehow', 'worse', 'when', 'innocent', 'animal', 'involved', 'ultimately', 'ultimate', 'anti', 'war', 'polemic', 'have', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'Albert', 'horse', 'named', 'Joey', 'movie', 'see', 'horse', 'being', 'born.Later', 'Albert', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'instead', 'buying', 'proper', 'plough', 'horse', 'foolishly', 'pits', 'own', 'landlord', 'bidding', 'flash', 'horse', 'Joey', 'instead', 'huge', 'Clydesdale', 'making', 'tenancy', 'precarious', 'imperiling', 'families', 'limited', 'fortunes', 'Joey', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'adjusting', 'plough', 'Here', 'have', 'wonderful', 'perforamnce', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'mother', 'cruelly', 'snubbed', 'awards', 'season.When', 'war', 'father', 'impulsively', 'horse', 'military', 'Albert', 'protests', 'Albert', 'understandably', 'distressed', 'too', 'young', 'join', 'military', 'vows', 'be', 'reunited', 'Joey', 'Meanwhile', 'Joey', 'front', 'have', 'poignant', 'scene', 'new', 'owner', 'horse', 'war', 'briefly', 'are', 'adopted', 'teenage', 'girl', 'not', 'long', 'war', 'again', 'Joey', 'series', 'adventures.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'trapped', 'Mans', 'land', 'sides', 'have', 'cooperate', 'free', 'loved', 'wire', 'clippers', 'flying', 'scene', 'also', 'loved', 'sub', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'German', 'brothers', 'parallel', 'structure', 'how', 'British', 'deal', 'similar', 'situation.Ultimately', 'horse', 'silent', 'witness', 'horror', 'war', 'becoming', 'effective', 'storytelling', 'metaphor.Later', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'overdone', 'moment', 'blindfold', 'recognition', 'like', 'feel', 'emotions', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'evoked', 'contrived', 'way.Warhorse', 'certainly', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'actors', 'who', 'vote', 'awards', 'would', 'prefer', 'do', 'have', 'story', 'centered', 'human', 'character', 'Nevetheless', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'young', 'teen', 'loved', 'watching', 'movies', 'particularly', 'Lassie', 'Goes', 'war.Another', 'movie', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'French', 'movieA', 'Very', 'Long', 'Engagement', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'A', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'believed', 'killed', 'being', 'sent', 'trench', 'deliberately', 'mans', 'land', 'breaking', 'military', 'regulations', 'huge', 'parallels', 'Warhorse', 'protagonists', 'are', 'human', 'also', 'polemic', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'war.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

1524630,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B0072GPPNC,Luke Killion,"[1, 2]","For me, ""War Horse"" was a very powerful movie, but not entirely what I had expected knowing Speilberg's other war projects such as Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and The Pacific. One of the most obvious decisions was the PG 13 rating and age appropriate content.  After seeing Private Ryan many times, I realized that any movie attempting to show the stark reality of war would probably require an R rating.  While there is a touch of the realism of Private Ryan in this film through the character of Albert Naricott, it comprises a relatively small portion of the movie.  There are numerous omissions of the horror of WWI that if included, would certainly require an R rating. At first I was a bit dissapointed at the scarcity of combat scenes, there are only really two, but they go a long way in showing the transition that occured during WWI from mobile Napoleonic tactics to the misery of the trenches.I have read other comments stating the exact opposite of my views, believing that there was too much violence in this movie.  Even though it might be disturbing for animal lovers(I count myself as one) to watch the casualties of war, I don't think most of Spielberg's fans would've been happy with a ""Hallmark"" made for Tv movie. The balance he struck between creating a marketable movie that could be watched by the whole family (as it was released at Christmas time) and a journey through both sides of WWI was a pretty good one. In that compromise I'm sure the studio and producers were much more pleased with the revenues, compared to an approach that featured the blood and gore of Spielberg's other war epics, and would have limited audience age.Although the conclusion of this movie isn't hard to figure out considering the rating, I still found the way it devloped was very moving.  I saw it in the theatre, but once I rented it, I picked up on alot of subtleties concerning the horse that I really missed the first time around. I was looking more for the historical side of how the scenes related to the war, rather than the basic commentary upon human and anmial nature that is displayed through the tribulations Joey the horse underwent.I definately enjoyed this film (which perhaps isn't the most realistic feeling that you're supposed to get from a war movie), but there were a few details that I thought could've been better.  One was the use of English throughout, even though there were German and French characters. It always seems unrealistic to me when actors are meant to portray people of a certain nationality and don't speak the language. The other was that despite the ability to show how the war degenerated from glorious charges to filthy trenches, the movie starts in 1914 and there is an abrupt transition to the Somme in 1918.  The viewer isn't quite sure of when and where some of the events are supposed to take place, though the two major battles were referenced. The middle of the film could've been tighter, and perhaps they might have added characters of the French army, which covered most of Western Front for the majority of the war. Again, Spielberg was trying to walk the line between commericial viability and realism, which is done well, but for me personally, I would've enjoyed a bit more realism, despite the discomfort it gives to certain viewers.  After all it is a war movie, but one with an uplifting note of triumph. A ""feel good"" WWI movie might not aptly describe the sentiments the veterans of both sides took away from the fighting.  But all in all, it tells the story of a miracle horse, and if you have believe in miracles, you will be satisfied by this film.",4,"No ""Saving Private Ryan"" ,but a nice balance between marketable movie and WWI realities",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3622,"['War', 'Horse', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'not', 'entirely', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'knowing', 'Speilberg', 'other', 'war', 'projects', 'such', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Pacific', 'One', 'most', 'obvious', 'decisions', 'was', 'PG', '13', 'rating', 'age', 'appropriate', 'content', 'seeing', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'many', 'times', 'realized', 'movie', 'attempting', 'show', 'stark', 'reality', 'war', 'would', 'probably', 'require', 'R', 'rating', 'touch', 'realism', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'character', 'Albert', 'Naricott', 'relatively', 'small', 'portion', 'movie', 'are', 'numerous', 'omissions', 'horror', 'WWI', 'included', 'would', 'certainly', 'require', 'R', 'rating', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'scarcity', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'really', 'two', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'showing', 'transition', 'occured', 'WWI', 'mobile', 'Napoleonic', 'tactics', 'misery', 'trenches.I', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'comments', 'stating', 'exact', 'opposite', 'views', 'believing', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'movie', 'Even', 'might', 'be', 'disturbing', 'animal', 'lovers', 'count', 'one', 'watch', 'casualties', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'Spielberg', 'fans', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'happy', 'Hallmark', 'made', 'Tv', 'movie', 'balance', 'struck', 'creating', 'marketable', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'watched', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'released', 'Christmas', 'time', 'journey', 'sides', 'WWI', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'compromise', ""'m"", 'sure', 'studio', 'producers', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'pleased', 'revenues', 'compared', 'approach', 'featured', 'blood', 'gore', 'Spielberg', 'other', 'war', 'epics', 'would', 'have', 'limited', 'audience', 'conclusion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'considering', 'rating', 'still', 'found', 'way', 'devloped', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'saw', 'theatre', 'once', 'rented', 'picked', 'up', 'alot', 'subtleties', 'concerning', 'horse', 'really', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'historical', 'side', 'how', 'scenes', 'related', 'war', 'rather', 'basic', 'commentary', 'human', 'anmial', 'nature', 'displayed', 'tribulations', 'Joey', 'horse', 'underwent.I', 'definately', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'most', 'realistic', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'get', 'war', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'details', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'One', 'was', 'use', 'English', 'even', 'were', 'German', 'French', 'characters', 'always', 'unrealistic', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'meant', 'portray', 'people', 'certain', 'nationality', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language', 'other', 'was', 'ability', 'show', 'how', 'war', 'degenerated', 'glorious', 'charges', 'filthy', 'trenches', 'movie', '1914', 'abrupt', 'transition', 'Somme', '1918', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'when', 'where', 'events', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'two', 'major', 'battles', 'were', 'referenced', 'middle', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tighter', 'perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'characters', 'French', 'army', 'covered', 'most', 'Western', 'Front', 'majority', 'war', 'Again', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'trying', 'walk', 'line', 'commericial', 'viability', 'realism', 'done', 'well', 'personally', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'more', 'realism', 'discomfort', 'certain', 'viewers', 'war', 'movie', 'one', 'uplifting', 'note', 'triumph', 'feel', 'good', 'WWI', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'aptly', 'describe', 'sentiments', 'veterans', 'sides', 'took', 'away', 'fighting', 'story', 'miracle', 'horse', 'have', 'believe', 'miracles', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'film']",N/A

I would never consider suggesting anyone allow a child to see this as it is full of ugly bloody scenes as well as emotionally wrenching ones.

1524649,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B0072GPPNC,M. Bullions,"[2, 5]","Trailers for ""War Horse"" reminded me that I hadn't seen anything of Spielberg's in a while, lately. He had taken some time off, I suppose, and he had returned this year with two films, the animated ""Adventures of Tintin"" (which I had no interest in seeing), and ""War Horse"", an adaptation of a British stage show, which had just come to Broadway. Admittedly, ""War Horse"" is not my kind of film, yet, when a film is made correctly, it doesn't have to be one's cup of tea for that person to thoroughly enjoy it.""War Horse"" is overstuffed with emotion and pathos, sweeping beautiful landscapes, and a narrative that is pieced together in an interestingly non-traditional way, considering how old-fashioned it is, as a whole. Almost everything about this film is old fashioned, throwing back to a different generation of filmmaking that our generation had seemingly forgotten how to do. A film like this hasn't been done in a while, which made the overall tone kind of refreshing in a weird way.""War Horse"" is the story of a boy and his pet horse. It is set in pre World War I Britain, and follows the horse as he is sold to be in the war, and the question is ""will he ever make it home again?"" The film follows the beautiful thoroughbred and for an animal character, we learn a lot about him over the course of the film. He reminds the men in the war of their humanity, and moves the hearts of everybody.The film is almost sickeningly wholesome, but it's going for the heartwarming, tearjerker effect, and it for the most part, nails it. Spielberg can make anything work, and here is why. This film is not my cup of tea. I don't particularly care for war films that aren't crazily unrealistic (ex. ""Inglourious Basterds"" as one that I adored), and depict the setting realistically - but this isn't really a war film at all. While hundreds of men are dying in this war, the horse is symbolic. He reminds them that some things in the world are not hopeless, and there may be a better day to come.While John William's beautiful score and the obvious attention to imagery that is played certainly help, the film doesn't have any big-name actors to back it up - but it doesn't need them. It also is about 30 minutes too long. I understand it wanted to achieve what is thought of as ""epic"" length (146 minutes), but I can think easily of four scenes off the top of my head that dragged the plot along longer than it should have. In a lot of ways, the double-narrative following two stories that eventually DO come together in the end is gimmicky and done-before, but I was able to forgive it being slightly contrived, because the final product is quite nice.In the end, some parts of this movie are emotionally brutal and difficult to watch, but it has a very nice and beautiful ending that redeems it. While I wouldn't call this a ""must see"" kind of movie, it was a very nice way to spend a few hours in the dead of winter. Don't forget the tissues, though.Grade: B",4,A good film that could have been great,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,2957,"['Trailers', 'War', 'Horse', 'reminded', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'Spielberg', 'while', 'lately', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'suppose', 'had', 'returned', 'year', 'two', 'films', 'animated', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'War', 'Horse', 'adaptation', 'British', 'stage', 'show', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'Broadway', 'Admittedly', 'War', 'Horse', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'yet', 'when', 'film', 'made', 'correctly', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'one', 'cup', 'tea', 'person', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'War', 'Horse', 'overstuffed', 'emotion', 'pathos', 'sweeping', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'narrative', 'pieced', 'together', 'interestingly', 'non-traditional', 'way', 'considering', 'how', 'old-fashioned', 'whole', 'Almost', 'everything', 'film', 'old', 'fashioned', 'throwing', 'back', 'different', 'generation', 'filmmaking', 'generation', 'had', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'how', 'do', 'A', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'while', 'made', 'overall', 'tone', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'weird', 'way', 'War', 'Horse', 'story', 'boy', 'pet', 'horse', 'set', 'pre', 'World', 'War', 'Britain', 'horse', 'sold', 'be', 'war', 'question', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'home', 'again', 'film', 'beautiful', 'thoroughbred', 'animal', 'character', 'learn', 'lot', 'course', 'film', 'men', 'war', 'humanity', 'hearts', 'everybody.The', 'film', 'almost', 'sickeningly', 'wholesome', 'going', 'heartwarming', 'tearjerker', 'effect', 'most', 'part', 'Spielberg', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'work', 'here', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'war', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'crazily', 'unrealistic', 'ex', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'one', 'adored', 'depict', 'setting', 'realistically', ""n't"", 'really', 'war', 'film', 'hundreds', 'men', 'are', 'dying', 'war', 'horse', 'symbolic', 'things', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'hopeless', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'day', 'come.While', 'John', 'William', 'beautiful', 'score', 'obvious', 'attention', 'imagery', 'played', 'certainly', 'help', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'big-name', 'actors', 'back', 'up', ""n't"", 'need', 'also', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'understand', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'what', 'thought', 'epic', 'length', '146', 'minutes', 'can', 'think', 'easily', 'four', 'scenes', 'top', 'head', 'dragged', 'plot', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'lot', 'ways', 'double-narrative', 'following', 'two', 'stories', 'eventually', 'DO', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'gimmicky', 'done-before', 'was', 'able', 'forgive', 'being', 'slightly', 'contrived', 'final', 'product', 'quite', 'nice.In', 'end', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'emotionally', 'brutal', 'difficult', 'watch', 'very', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'must', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'dead', 'winter', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'tissues', 'though.Grade', 'B']",N/A

In many ways, this movie seems to honor their contributions.  Best of all, it is one of the few movies that actually appreciates horses and portrays them as something other than veterans of the race track.  The only other movies that accomplish this are The Black Stallion and Black Beauty.War Horse does an excellent job of exposing the many horrors of war that the soldiers and horses both faced.  It has all the unique elements of World War I such as no mans land, poison gas, tanks, and machine guns.  All of which were a novelty before World War I.

1524658,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0072GPPNC,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","Most of us have read about dogs that after a distant separation from their human families, find their way back home. There are also cinematic versions. I recall ""Homeward Bound: An Incredible Journey"", and a Lassie film from the 1940's and I think Rin-Tin-Tin; but that might have been TV. In any case, director Steven Spielberg ups the ante, this time with a horse named Joey.An English farmer, out of spite for his landlord (David Thewlis), buys a young horse at an auction. He needed a larger horse for purposes of plowing but was a wee bit tipsy at the time. The son, Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises the horse that is unusually smart, strong and sociable. Eventually, in need of cash, the father (Peter Mullan) sells the horse to a young army officer (Tom Hiddleston) at the dawn of World War I. Spielberg then sets events in motion that follow Joey and his fellow horse through numerous battles, arduous labor, escapes and engagements with English and German armies and French farmers. Aided by longtime partner, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg paints a beautiful portrait of landscapes, sunrises and sunsets.The film does stretch believability at times. Would a horse volunteer for duty to pull a canon up a hill in place of a fellow horse? It also would have made more sense to have Germans speak German and French speak French but I guess subtitles over even small sections of film would scare off some audiences. This is old fashion movie making and even with some bleak battle scenes and animal mistreatment, will attract families. Sure it's sentimental and even cheesy at times, but it has a strong moral foundation and it ultimately uplifting.The Blu ray disc is of course a 1080p conversion.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio which makes the spectacular cinematography really shine.  The audio comes in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 24 bit surround, so those with a serious home theater system will be rewarded.",4,3 1/2 stars for some good old fashion moviemaking,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1935,"['Most', 'have', 'read', 'dogs', 'distant', 'separation', 'human', 'families', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'are', 'also', 'cinematic', 'versions', 'recall', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'Lassie', 'film', '1940', 'think', 'Rin-Tin-Tin', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'case', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'ante', 'time', 'horse', 'named', 'Joey.An', 'English', 'farmer', 'spite', 'landlord', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'young', 'horse', 'auction', 'needed', 'larger', 'horse', 'purposes', 'plowing', 'was', 'wee', 'bit', 'tipsy', 'time', 'son', 'Albert', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'horse', 'unusually', 'smart', 'strong', 'sociable', 'Eventually', 'need', 'cash', 'father', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'horse', 'young', 'army', 'officer', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'dawn', 'World', 'War', 'I.', 'Spielberg', 'then', 'events', 'motion', 'follow', 'Joey', 'fellow', 'horse', 'numerous', 'battles', 'arduous', 'labor', 'escapes', 'engagements', 'English', 'German', 'armies', 'French', 'farmers', 'Aided', 'longtime', 'partner', 'cinematographer', 'Janusz', 'Kaminski', 'Spielberg', 'beautiful', 'portrait', 'landscapes', 'sunrises', 'sunsets.The', 'film', 'stretch', 'believability', 'times', 'Would', 'horse', 'volunteer', 'duty', 'pull', 'canon', 'up', 'hill', 'place', 'fellow', 'horse', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'have', 'Germans', 'speak', 'German', 'French', 'speak', 'French', 'guess', 'subtitles', 'even', 'small', 'sections', 'film', 'would', 'scare', 'off', 'audiences', 'old', 'fashion', 'movie', 'making', 'even', 'bleak', 'battle', 'scenes', 'animal', 'mistreatment', 'will', 'attract', 'families', 'Sure', 'sentimental', 'even', 'cheesy', 'times', 'strong', 'moral', 'foundation', 'ultimately', 'uplifting.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'course', '1080p', 'conversion', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'really', 'shine', 'audio', 'form', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '7.1', '24', 'bit', 'surround', 'serious', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded']",N/A

Doyle ""film buff""","[14, 18]","WAR HORSE conjures up feelings I had when I first read BLACK BEAUTY years ago, the saga of a horse who went from owner to owner amid a series of mostly unhappy circumstances. The difference here is the background (World War I), the luscious farm scenes that start the tale, the colorful faces of the village folk, and at the center of the tale, an earnest and good-looking lad (Jeremy Irvine) who adopts the horse and must turn it into a plow horse so his family can retain their farm.And when the war comes, the grim scenes of battle offer a stark contrast to the sentimental scenes at the start, as the horse proves himself to be a fine specimen until he is caught in a barbed wire situation that requires the assistance of British and German soldiers to put aside the war while they free him from suffering and pain.The usual bombastic score that John Williams gave many of Spielberg's action films is missing here. Instead, there are delicate melodies played brilliantly on flute for the lighter moments and impressive richer sounds for the dramatic highlights. It's a lovely piece of craftsmanship.So is the film, which shows a high level of craftsmanship throughout, the settings and costumes realistic, the performances beyond reproach, and the sentimental happy ending so welcome after all the audience has been through with the brave war horse. Credit must go to Steven Spielberg for his detailed direction and to his cinematographer for the stunning camera work.By all means, one of the best Spielberg films to come along in a long time. Jeremy Irvine is perfectly cast in the leading role and all of the supporting players are well cast, particularly Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Neil Arestrup and Benedict Cumberbatch.Solid entertainment, it holds the interest throughout despite its length.

However I could not get the film out of my mind. Images from the film kept appearing in my head. A second viewing made me realize why the film was one of the Best Picture nominations for 2011. As with other Best Picture nominations, academy members are attracted to and recognize high quality filmmaking. There should be no doubt that 'War Horse' qualifies as an example of outstanding production and acting. In lesser hands, 'War Horse' would have been an average attempt at epic filmmaking, but Spielberg is an artist and it shows in this production of beautifully staged set pieces.'War Horse' is a film about a rural English family in the early part of the Twentieth Century that buys a thoroughbred horse that they name Joey for an exorbitant price that they cannot afford. They also needed a quarter horse, a work horse, and not a race horse for farm work. The young son of the family convinces his parents that he can make the horse productive and help save the farm. His efforts fail and Joey is sold to the army at the beginning of WW I. The son, Albert, vows that he and Joey will someday be reunited. We then follow Joey through 4 years of war and different owners.Joey is the centerpiece of an episodic plot line which is how the original book and play was presented. Some film goers may be turned off by this. But if they look at the film in terms of plot they are missing what this film is really about. This is a film about a horse and the lives of the people he influences. There is no romance, no sex. This is a PG-13 film. War violence is present but understated. Several times, the camera looks away or conceals by foreground objects scenes that would have earned the film an 'R' rating. This is a film that could have been filmed as an historical epics of the 1960's. The retro feel of the film is just what this movie is about. Spielberg set out to create a 1960's-like film such as one that might have been made by David Lean.The film is old fashioned in that it takes its time to tell the story. No digital camera here. It was all filmed on celluloid. No CGI except for a brief animal scene. All animal scenes are real. The camera lingers on every scene.The pastoral beauty of Southwestern England and the trenches of WW I is captured without digital fakery.I recommend this film as one of the best of 2011.",4,Another Great Example of Filmmaking,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2431,"['first', 'thoughts', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'positive', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'However', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'film', 'mind', 'Images', 'film', 'kept', 'appearing', 'head', 'second', 'viewing', 'made', 'realize', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominations', '2011', 'other', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominations', 'academy', 'members', 'are', 'attracted', 'recognize', 'high', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'should', 'be', 'doubt', 'Horse', 'qualifies', 'example', 'outstanding', 'production', 'acting', 'lesser', 'hands', 'Horse', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'average', 'attempt', 'epic', 'filmmaking', 'Spielberg', 'artist', 'production', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'set', 'pieces', 'Horse', 'film', 'rural', 'English', 'family', 'early', 'part', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'thoroughbred', 'horse', 'name', 'Joey', 'exorbitant', 'price', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'also', 'needed', 'quarter', 'horse', 'work', 'horse', 'not', 'race', 'horse', 'farm', 'work', 'young', 'son', 'family', 'parents', 'can', 'make', 'horse', 'productive', 'help', 'save', 'farm', 'efforts', 'fail', 'Joey', 'sold', 'army', 'beginning', 'WW', 'son', 'Albert', 'Joey', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'reunited', 'then', 'follow', 'Joey', '4', 'years', 'war', 'different', 'owners.Joey', 'centerpiece', 'episodic', 'plot', 'line', 'how', 'original', 'book', 'play', 'was', 'presented', 'film', 'goers', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'look', 'film', 'terms', 'plot', 'are', 'missing', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'film', 'horse', 'lives', 'people', 'romance', 'sex', 'PG-13', 'film', 'War', 'violence', 'present', 'understated', 'Several', 'times', 'camera', 'away', 'conceals', 'foreground', 'objects', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'historical', 'epics', '1960', 'retro', 'feel', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Spielberg', 'set', 'out', 'create', ""1960's-like"", 'film', 'such', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'David', 'Lean.The', 'film', 'old', 'fashioned', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'digital', 'camera', 'here', 'was', 'filmed', 'celluloid', 'CGI', 'brief', 'animal', 'scene', 'animal', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'camera', 'lingers', 'scene.The', 'pastoral', 'beauty', 'Southwestern', 'England', 'trenches', 'WW', 'captured', 'digital', 'fakery.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'best', '2011']",N/A

It is breath-taking both for the scope of the story and the broad panoramic scenery displayed for the viewers. A friend and I watched it recently at her house, and after it was over there was a long silence. 'I'm now going to adopt five senior horses for my rescue shelter', my friend finally said in a tremulous voice. 'This is surprising coming from you', I replied attempting to steady my voice and added: 'I thought you weren't too keen on horses; you've never mentioned them before these beautiful and courageous animals'. 'War Horse' made me think of all the many centuries through history when horses have been sent into deadly combat. The legendary Bucephalus came to mind, the mighty scar-battled stallion that Alexander the Great rode through many conquests to create his vast empire until the charger died of his wounds in 326B.C. The young Emperor went on to found the City of Bucephala in memory of his horse, whom he deemed immortal. And, then there are the unsung heroes symbolized by Joey the horse in Spielberg's movie. A colt raised on a farm lovingly by an adolescent boy, Joey and Albert are eventually swept up together in the terror of war, and it's all about the loyalty, courage and the noble bond shared between man and horse.

I didn't become attached to any character, indeed I felt emotionless towards all, including the horse. This morning I decided to put pen to paper when I had this epiphany that Warhorse reminded me of two other filmsLassie Come HomeandThe Butterfly Effect. Creepy, but think about it. The story arc is a boy and his horse (read: dog) and how the horse is finally returned to its master and home and how people's lives are affected by others' everyday decisions. I love this comparison and I haven't read any reviews that have made a similar statement. Funny, but I really enjoy both of those films.Regarding animal cruelty; I would say that there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish squirm slightly (my attempt at alliteration...). My wife is a horse-lover and the scenes of cruelty to the innocent horses because of war didn't bother her too much. Spielberg's portrayal of war is tame compared to the ultra-violentSaving Private Ryan. Naturally where Spielberg shines is his beautiful cinematography and music. It used to be that Spielberg could wrap you up in his stories, but as of late, not so much. I wish that Spielberg had expounded upon the young-french girl, who fell in love with the horse and took her first horseback ride, despite her health affliction. That parting scene between her grandfather and Albert was trite and seemed forced. Weak.The auction scene and the character of Ted, Albert's alcoholic father was well done and boded promise for the rest of the film. Sadly, the film falls flat and never rebounds. The final scene is a typical Spielberg tug at your heart-strings. But if you are going to tug at my heart-strings, at least give me characters that I care about.This is certainly not a bad movie, indeed it's an ok movie. Just not a great movie.

However, Steven Spielberg's direction for War Horse comes close to becoming a semi-epic film, especially with its running time of over two hours.  But what is notable about the film is the meticulous production and exceptional cinematography and multiple storylines interwoven almost like a short story anthology centered upon a horse named Joey and his faithful owner Albert (Jeremy Irvine) about the time that World War I erupts in Europe.  The film grows and grows as it proceeds with each separate encounter that Joey meets, but the horse is merely a backdrop and the people that happen to have him within their possession help to contribute to the care and compassion that they show towards Joey.War Horse builds upon the various relationships that are established between man and horse.  Viewers will see about seven separate encounters that are finely intertwined within the film that will eventually reconnect when the movie concludes.  Indeed, one cannot deny the cinematography and the soundtrack that are compatible with each scene.  They are highly effective in invoking emotion and sincerity between each character.  And as viewers follow along with Joey's journey, especially during the beginning of the film, it is the symbolism and metaphors that are identifiable - the special emblem that Joey carries with him that is symbolic of Albert's father's heroism doing the Boer Wars in South Africa that happens to come into the possession of each new character that adds much sentimental value in terms of remembrance and memory as well as Joey finding his way back home; being this is a film that resonates much camaraderie during wartime and fellow man, Spielberg has much experience within that department having produced Saving Private Ryan. His drive for authenticity are clearly evident in War Horse, but not to compare this film to a list of other wartime depictions, there is also an inkling of Legends of the Fall that shows within this film that extremely tugs with the emotions; catch the scenes of the no man's land at the Battle at Marne or Battle of the Somme that captured the ravages of war wound with barbed wire fences that even a horse gets entangled but not succumbed to the challenge.Overall, it was a delight to have watched War Horse.  And not to dwell on other comparisons, but one more footnote comes to mind that relates to films or depictions between man and all living creatures.

The story is set in early 1900s in England just before an onset of the Great War.  A young man from rural England finds himself training a horse to plow fields in the area that is clearly hostile to any agricultural endeavor.  The horse itself is a magnificent animal.  He is not a work horse; he is smaller and more fit to be a race horse than anything else.  His personality is amazing and before long, young man Albert and this new horse he names Joey create unbreakable bond.As Wold War I breaks out and Germany declares war on England, Joey is sold to the British army to help out during the war.  His young caretaker is heartbroken from being separated from the animal that is clearly his great companion.  Joey first becomes officer's horse, but as war goes on his destiny leads him from British to German and then French population.  Joey makes friendhip with another horse as equally beautiful and honorable as himself.  As story evolves, we see how at times of war people of all backgrounds and all generations are able to connect with this amazing animal that allows them to connect with their own humanity.  Joey is able to give them back their dignity, love and understanding that even humans lose touch with after seeing all the horrors of the war.I will not retell the movie, because it will spoil the viewing of another Steven Speilberg's hearwarming story.  This film is meant for all generations.  It has moments that are touching and deeply emotional.

1524707,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B0072GPPNC,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[524, 550]","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. After seeing it at the theater I came onto Amazon, as I often do, to add it to my wishlist. I then read the unexcited reviews that were found on the product page and thought I should write a review to posit a counter opinion. The other reviews posted didn't seem to have enjoyed the film, two major criticisms being that they found it melodramatic and heavy handed, comments like these make me wonder if audiences have become so cynical that they view any attempt at displaying open/honest emotion to be an attempt at manipulation. Everyone has differing opinions but I feel this film will appeal to anyone who enjoys stylistically well made films and/or anyone who enjoys stories about bonds/will being tested. In a general sense Spielberg uses the story of this horse to explore the human condition and explore some very well done set pieces/environments.As I saw it, the horse is a metaphor for hope and how it can be shared and spread, how it can inspire and endure. I don't mean this in an over sentimental way but just in a very real way. We are all hopeful for different things, big and small, and this film is about how under the right conditions and with the right persistence that hope can avoid being snuffed out or lost.The film, based on a play I have not seen and cannot compare it to, is episodic as the horse goes from owner to owner during the years of World War 1. The fact that the film was episodic didn't make it feel chopped up or give it the feel of a broken narrative. I felt the through line of the film was the human condition and the traveling horse facilitated the telling of several viewpoints while exploring the excellent recreation of a time period. The acting was top notch by everyone seen on screen. To counter another criticism, the main human character, a boy named Albert, does show strong affection for the horse, a character in the film quips ""come on now boy, it's not as if he were a dog"". I didn't find this relationship to be strange, the horse simply becomes very important to Albert because as we see he doesn't have much to his life and the horse is something he gets that then works to make his life better. Perhaps I also never found it strange as I always found the horse to be representative of hope rather than as just some random animal.The writing in terms of dialogue flowed and felt incredibly natural, as it does in most Spielberg films. John Williams score, while clearly a John Williams score, is the perfect mix of innocence, action/adventure and drama as the story calls for it. I would strongly compare the pacing and acting to Catch Me if You Can, as that film also had several major settings that shifted as the film progressed. I found War Horse to actually be better paced as it has a few more settings (about 5, possibly 6 in total?) and each one is shorter than the ones in the aforementioned film. Best of all the film actually ends when it ends, the story concludes and there are no tacked on or forced endings for the sake of pandering or over explaining as many recent films have had.As far as the directing, I don't know if one can compare anything to the seeming effortless magic he created in his early films or certain efforts from the 90's but this would be Spielberg above his recent best and closer to those older films in quality. Everything unfolds visually in such an easy to follow an familiar way while still being unique and involving. There are some masterful shots that recall the opening of Saving Private Ryan but in an artistically different way. This is unquestionably due in part to the fact that this film has been made family friendly, while that could serve as a criticism I didn't find the film to be aimed specifically at families, though it has been made to facilitate viewing by younger children. Rather than illustrating the pure violence of battle as he did in SPR, Spielberg spends his time in this film showing the brutality of war in a creative fashion that suggests the horror more than displaying it. There is one such scene in particular where mounted soldiers ride into battle and on the other end of the shot their empty horses emerge without many of the riders they once carried.In a sea of films about special effects, high concept stories or big names here is a film that is a complete film on its own without any gimmicks, as fun as gimmicks can be (Mi4 for example). This film is an actual experience for those who are open to it. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellently crafted film that pushed the dark and grittiness, War Horse is a excellently crafted film that pushes the lighter elements but both are equally enjoyable and excellently made. Watching a good Spielberg film is like watching the epitome of what film is. It's like more recently watching Christopher Nolan's films, there are always flaws in any film but films such as theirs are so carefully and purposefully made as films that they are engaging and fully engrossing.One potential weakness I will admit, though I feel a reviewing of the film would diminish it, is that the film doesn't have as strong an arc as most films. The characters change but so much of it is internal here. The horse's first owner does change but he is absent through the middle of the film, the various other owners also change in varying ways but all during their own vignettes. The horse itself has changed in much the same way as his owner as suggested by the final shot of the film, but perhaps critical audience members won't pick up on this. That said, one could (and I would say should) view this subtlety as purposeful. The film isn't as much about how the boy or the horse has changed but how despite all they've been through they managed to stay so much the same, they maintain what could easily have been lost.I dunno, I personally love it (5 Stars) but for objectivity I'll give it 4/5 for general audiences, I think most everyone I described at the beginning of this review will like this film if they view it. For those who feel it is heavy handed and melodramatic go and watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, its also an excellent film but there is no overt display of emotion to be found there.

It is also a historical drama portraying some of the most horrifying aspects of The Great War (WW I) as seen through the horse's eyes. It is adapted from a childrens' novel written by the excellent author of childrens' literature, Michael Morpurgo. To those who believe the plot is too simplistic, sappy or childish and the animals too anthropomorphic, well HELLO...remember the original target audience. That does not mean this movie is for children only...in fact, since it depicts some rather gruesome aspects of war, judgement should be used in taking children to see it. Except for the very young, it should appeal to all age groups. As with most Spielberg films the cinematography is outstanding...especially the scenery shot in Devon which is absolutely breathtaking. The John Williams soundtrack too, perfectly sets the mood for the story. The casting, both human and animal, is spot-on.

But if you are a horse lover (as I am) it will likely be difficult for you to watch.The movie follows a beautiful Thoroughbred named Joey through various phases of his life.  Unfortunately, the horse has a very difficult life, changing owners numerous times and going through some really harrowing experiences.  I thought some of the ugliness of war would be toned down since this movie will likely appeal to a wide audience especially because of how the ads play up the bond between the horse and the boy.  While there's not a lot of blood and gore, it is still very violent and at it is very much a war movie.One of the first war scenes depicts a cavalry battalion (with Joey being towards the front) ambushing a group of unsuspecting soldiers.  A group of 100+ soldiers on horses rush toward the encampment and cut down several soldiers, some of them in the process of shaving and getting dressed.  But there are machine guns hidden in the trees and almost the entire battalion of horse and riders is cut down by machine gun fire as they head towards the trees.  Only a few horses (Joey included) survive.  This was a very difficult scene to watch and countless dead horses on the ground gave you an idea of how badly horses generally fared in wartime situations.There is another very difficult scene to watch in which Joey is running away from a tank and runs in a blind panic over and around several bunkers, and eventually runs head long into several strands of barbwire.  He gets so bogged down in the barbwire that he flips end over end and is completely unable to free himself.  It was heartwrenching and terrible to watch.  However, the scene that follows was one of the most moving of the movie, where two soldiers from the opposing camps come together to free him.One of the tired, but true, war adages that came to mind while watching this movie was ""war is hell.""  This proves to be true for pretty much everyone in the movie, especially the horse.

Surely with the budget Spielberg can command he could have hired some specialists to tell him how horses behave and respond?  I read the novel first, and that was bad enough.  Are horses amazing?  Yes.  Do they act like the trained horses in this movie, when they're being themselves?

Told in an epic and episodic form, this movie tries to reach back into the past of cinematic wonders like those epic spectacles that David Lean was so famous for. In many ways, this sort of ambition is doomed to fail outright, few filmmakers today can pull this off, but Spielberg should be one them. So, the real trouble I would guess lies in the story, it's too epic for the movie that was made.The movie begins with an excruciatingly dull first quarter, filled with bland characters and cliched situations we've seen since the dawn of the cinema. I don't want to sound bloodthirsty, but the movie doesn't find it's footing until we get into the war, once this part of the movie begins the epic journey and adventures soon follow, this is where Spielberg is comfortable. The bulk of the movie is rousing and thrilling, but it's all undermined by a finale of such gross sentimentality and ""a you've got to be kidding me"" reunion, that I could hear chuckles, at least in my head.""War Horse"" is beautiful to look at, gorgeous photography by Spielberg's long time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski assists the movie greatly. A fine cast of great British character actors (Emily Watson, Peter Mullen, David Thewlis, Liam Cunningham, Benedict Cumberbatch) populate the supporting roles, but make no mistake the film is about and rightfully belongs to Joey, the war horse of the title: neat trivia, Joey is played by the same horse who also played Seabuscuit a few years back. Add a rousing score by John Williams and as expected, this is one well made movie.The story based on Michael Morpurgo's book is long, drawn out, rather sad, and I doubt the audience intended for this, that being the family film audience, will have the patience for this. I have very conflicting feelings for this movie, on one hand it is big and glorious to look at, and on the other it's too long and too slow, too uninvolving.

1524757,A3L14D8BAREUSV,B0072GPPNC,SteamaZon,"[2, 2]","This review is SPOILERSThe boy raises the horse (Joey) up and off it goes to war, sold without his consent to save the family farm.  The empathetic officer  who understands Joey's real value buys the horse and pledges the boy he will take good care of the horse.  Money paid is considered  rent and the fine animal will be returned once he comes back from the war.A few weeks / months later, the boy receives the sketchbook of the officer and learns he was killed in action. To the now distraught boy, upset that Joey might have been killed as well console their son saying it was possible Joey was nowhere near the the officer. Therefore Joey may still be alive and perfectly fine.  Meaning the boy cared more about the horse than the dead officer.  In retrospect this is perhaps ""natural,"" it is a movie about a horse and after all, the boy knew the officer for all of 5 minutes while doting over the animal for several years.Plot holes exist for dynamic effect, the girl gallops up a hill and is in the middle of a horde of German solders.  Could she not hear or at worst, see the Germans as she poked her head above the rise then turn about before she was in the middle of them?  Perhaps in the real world, yes, but that does not make for swell movie dramatics.As the Germans retreated, the Joey finds himself trapped by a traveling British tank (possibly a Mark V).  The tank was alone, no other troops nearby, odd since such tanks usually have supporting infantry with them.  The horse reaches the a dead end blocked by wire and high steep embankments on all sides.  No way out for the horse.  No way out for the tank and its crew either, perfect spot for a German ambush, or get stuck.  WHERE in the HECK was that tank going?!?  One might think the crew would get a clue from Joey the Panicked Horse who was trying to escape.The creepiest scene in my view was the towing of the German artillery.  The huge metal wheels and peculiar design of the heavy cannon ( possibly a 21 cm M&ouml;rser 10) made it a nightmarish weapon to behold.  The film makers did an exceptionally good job in depicting this behind the scenes horror.I felt the most sympathy for the two German brothers.  The movie gave up a bit about their background and their family, concern for the younger brother, only 14 years old.  When the two became separated, the elder brother to take care of the horses and the younger, to march to the front, the elder boy, takes it upon himself to snatch the younger to protect him from possible death and spare their mother the grief of loss.  It ended badly for both of them, a haunting ""what if;"" they followed orders, like they signed up to do, for now that poor German mother would have no sons returning from the war.Overall, I liked the movie, a good way to introduce aspects of World War I, its absurdities,  conundrums and overall unpleasantness.  The film asks us to stretch our  limits of believability at times , where no one wants to put out of its misery, a wired up suffering horse in the middle of no-man's land.  It might be possible to believe a German and an English solder, working to accomplish a mutually beneficial task, (they got together for Christmas back in 1914,) but uber-dark realism does not make for a good family movie about a horse.OH YEAH, I LIKE it when my Germans / Japanese/ Africans and other non English speakers cite the Queens English perfectly.

I was unexpectedly surprised and very satisfied with Spielberg's latest film (his best since Catch Me If You Can a decade ago), based on the critically-acclaimed play of the same name.It has a charming enough beginning and premise: a young man takes in an injured horse and trains him to plow, hoping to raise enough money to save his family's farm. As World War I breaks out, however, the family is forced to sell the horse and the movie truly begins.While I expected a standard narrative, the film functioned in a much more interesting way: the horse passed between different parties, British and German soldiers, a young French girl, and others throughout the course of the war. I won't give any spoilers but the ending is incredibly moving and satisfying.The movie seems to drag on during the second hour (clocks in at almost 150 minutes), but the payoff is well worth it. The wide variety of characters are able to come together in a believable scenario, illustrating how much the horse and the war has changed all of them.It is in this last ten minutes or so that the film truly blew me away; the characters gave incredibly stirring speeches, evoking themes of sacrifice, loss, and redemption.In addition to the wonderful emotional power of this film, it is also very well shot and produced. The stunning imagery is often reminiscent of Gone With the Wind, of characters in desperate situations silhouetted against a fiery orange sky.

Uncharacteristically (for Spielberg) poor editing contributes to a rather chopped-up storyline which lacks the usual powerful and engaging narrative continuity found in the films of this erstwhile great magician of the silver screen. The story is all there; it just isn't realised very well.The film has many positives. Spielberg's classic large-scale cinematography is at times truly breathtaking; the horses are magnificently trained & highly photogenic; the soundtrack is good; the attention to period detail exemplary - as far as this non-expert reviewer can tell.However the film's failings make for quite a list: poor casting, unconvincing acting, some peculiar and not-quite-right British regional accents, Germans unfortunately speaking English to each other with German accents (is the audience really judged to be so dumb that they can't read subtitles?), some beyond-believable plot devices which verge on the embarrassing, excessive sentimentality - one of Spielberg's consistent failings but usually offset by his excellent narrative storytelling - together with the poor editing and deficiencies in script make for an uninvolving viewing experience.The film's main failing, however, remains that it is unsure of its audience. Is it a feel-good film for kids? The war scenes are surely too bloody, violent and upsetting for small children. At the same time it's too simplistic, predictable and cheesy to succeed as a serious film for grown-ups. Either way we don't care enough about the characters - except maybe the horse. This unfortunately condemns the film as one of the director's less successful efforts, and will probably deny it `classic' status in future years.

There is a lot of substance here--family bonds, the bond between an animal and a human, and history. My 10-year-old (the war lover) really enjoyed it, while my 12-year-old (the horse lover) did not. However, both had a lot of questions and a lot of opinions about the situations in the movie. In my book, the good ""family"" movie is not necessarily one that everyone enjoys and wants to see again, but one that is rich in plot and details and will stimulate family discussion afterwards.

To me, it is about the heroic triumph of the human spirit, as manifested by the individuals whom the horse, Joey, encounters during his lifetime. At each crossroad the horse encounters, with peril and death on one side and salvation on the other, an individual arises to assist the horse and facilitate his survival, often at great risk to themselves.SPOILER ALERT: Albert and his father save Joey from an ignominious life. The English officer selects Joey as his personal mount, promising to protect him. The German brothers shelter and protect Joey while in German hands. The Grandfather and his granddaughter rescue Joey from the Germans temporarily. Once back in German hands, the horse is again sheltered and protected by the enlisted man in charge of horses. In a pivotal scene, both a German and English soldier risk their lives to extricate Joey from barbed wire. The horse is spared from euthanasia by a caring English doctor, sensing the special bond between Joey and Albert....etc. etc. It should be noted that saviors arise from all walks of life and on both sides of the wartime conflict. In this respect it is much more even-handed than most productions, thus making its message more universal.Secondly, there are no real ""villains"". War is depicted as a futile horror, but the people involved in it do not inflict needless harm on the horse. Joey is forced to pull a huge cannon (with human assistance) to the top of a hill, but this is not done out of cruelty but rather perceived necessity by the soldiers who possess him. In addition, this bit of ""cruelty"" is no worse than that inflicted by Joey's initial saviors when he was forced to plow a hard and rock-strewn field...again, perceived necessity. Unlike most traditional ""noble animal"" stories, no one goes out of their way to inflict suffering on the horse, he, like the humans he coexists with, suffer together.In conclusion, the horse demonstrates great nobility during his adventures, but so do the humans he encounters. Indeed, without them to guide and assist him on his way, his story would have been much shorter....and much less noble. For this reason, I feel this story was elevated far above the standard ""animal in peril"" tearjerker. It presents scenarios in which good people risk their lives to do good deeds for a good animal, and thus portrays a triumph of the spirit of both humans and horse.",5,A Story That Is More About People Than Horses,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2522,"['Once', 'again', 'am', 'taking', 'different', 'angle', 'movie', 'surface', 'be', 'heroic', 'triumph', 'exceptional', 'horse', 'heroic', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'manifested', 'individuals', 'whom', 'horse', 'Joey', 'encounters', 'lifetime', 'crossroad', 'horse', 'encounters', 'peril', 'death', 'one', 'side', 'salvation', 'other', 'individual', 'arises', 'assist', 'horse', 'facilitate', 'survival', 'often', 'great', 'risk', 'themselves.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Albert', 'father', 'save', 'Joey', 'ignominious', 'life', 'English', 'officer', 'selects', 'Joey', 'personal', 'mount', 'promising', 'protect', 'German', 'brothers', 'shelter', 'protect', 'Joey', 'German', 'hands', 'Grandfather', 'granddaughter', 'rescue', 'Joey', 'Germans', 'temporarily', 'Once', 'back', 'German', 'hands', 'horse', 'again', 'sheltered', 'protected', 'enlisted', 'man', 'charge', 'horses', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'German', 'English', 'soldier', 'risk', 'lives', 'extricate', 'Joey', 'barbed', 'wire', 'horse', 'spared', 'euthanasia', 'caring', 'English', 'doctor', 'sensing', 'special', 'bond', 'Joey', 'Albert', '.etc', 'etc', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'saviors', 'arise', 'walks', 'life', 'sides', 'wartime', 'conflict', 'respect', 'much', 'more', 'even-handed', 'most', 'productions', 'thus', 'making', 'message', 'more', 'universal.Secondly', 'are', 'real', 'villains', 'War', 'depicted', 'futile', 'horror', 'people', 'involved', 'do', 'not', 'inflict', 'needless', 'harm', 'horse', 'Joey', 'forced', 'pull', 'huge', 'cannon', 'human', 'assistance', 'top', 'hill', 'not', 'done', 'cruelty', 'rather', 'perceived', 'necessity', 'soldiers', 'who', 'possess', 'addition', 'bit', 'cruelty', 'worse', 'inflicted', 'Joey', 'initial', 'saviors', 'when', 'was', 'forced', 'plow', 'hard', 'rock-strewn', 'field', 'again', 'perceived', 'necessity', 'most', 'traditional', 'noble', 'animal', 'stories', 'one', 'way', 'inflict', 'suffering', 'horse', 'humans', 'suffer', 'together.In', 'conclusion', 'horse', 'great', 'nobility', 'adventures', 'so', 'do', 'humans', 'Indeed', 'guide', 'assist', 'way', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'shorter', '.and', 'much', 'less', 'noble', 'reason', 'feel', 'story', 'was', 'elevated', 'far', 'standard', 'animal', 'peril', 'tearjerker', 'scenarios', 'good', 'people', 'risk', 'lives', 'do', 'good', 'deeds', 'good', 'animal', 'thus', 'triumph', 'spirit', 'humans', 'horse']",N/A

Set in rural England and Europe during World War I, it's the story of a horse, Joey, and young Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who tames and trains him to plow the fields of his family's modest farm.  When the army wants horses for the war effort, Joey and Albert are parted and we follow Joey's adventures on the front, in battle, and undergoing the horrors of modern warfare.  Joey encounters a British cavalry officer, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter before an emotional climax.Spielberg has given ""War Horse"" great spectacle.  The war scenes are realistic and harrowing in their brutality.  That horses were used at all when machine guns could mow down a brigade of charging cavalry in seconds is testament to the thoughtless cruelty of war.The four-disc Combo Pack contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, a 60-minute making-of documentary, behind-the-scenes looks at sound recording and editing, stills gallery, and a profile of one of the many extras brought in for the movie that details how ""atmosphere people"" are cast and why they are essential to a film's believability.",4,Spielberg Puts His Trademark Stamp on This Spectacle,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1208,"['War', 'Horse', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Morpurgo', 'Tony', 'Award-winning', 'play', 'Set', 'rural', 'England', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', 'story', 'horse', 'Joey', 'young', 'Albert', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'who', 'plow', 'fields', 'family', 'modest', 'farm', 'When', 'army', 'horses', 'war', 'effort', 'Joey', 'Albert', 'are', 'parted', 'follow', 'Joey', 'adventures', 'front', 'battle', 'undergoing', 'horrors', 'modern', 'warfare', 'Joey', 'British', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'German', 'soldiers', 'French', 'farmer', 'granddaughter', 'emotional', 'climax.Spielberg', 'given', 'War', 'Horse', 'great', 'spectacle', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'harrowing', 'brutality', 'horses', 'were', 'used', 'when', 'machine', 'guns', 'could', 'mow', 'down', 'brigade', 'charging', 'cavalry', 'seconds', 'testament', 'thoughtless', 'cruelty', 'war.The', 'four-disc', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'versions', '60-minute', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'behind-the-scenes', 'looks', 'sound', 'recording', 'editing', 'gallery', 'profile', 'one', 'many', 'extras', 'brought', 'movie', 'details', 'how', 'atmosphere', 'people', 'are', 'cast', 'why', 'are', 'essential', 'film', 'believability']",N/A

1524777,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B0072GPPNC,Tom Birkenstock,"[6, 7]","Just as Spielberg released both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List in the year of our lord, 1993, so too has he released The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse within a few weeks of each other in 2011.  To quote another film, perhaps he is ""trying to suggest something about the duality of man,"" and that man is Spielberg himself.  War Horse is destined to become an essential entry into Spielberg's oeuvre, a sumptuous piece of filmmaking that forms part of a conversation between Spielberg and the epics from Hollywood's golden age.  If the film has a central protagonist, then it is Joey, the stallion who makes his way from pastoral England to the war torn continent.  As the film begins, Ted Narracott, a well meaning drunkard, is searching for a suitable horse to plow an arid but rock filled plot of land.  He travels into town with the intention of bidding on a solid work horse, but a little too much drink and a betting match between Ted and his seedy landlord leads him to buy a young stallion, a horse that, as his friends note, is completely unsuitable for the grueling work of plowing a field.When Ted returns home to his wife, she, quite understandably, becomes upset and tells her husband he will have to return the horse immediately.  Ted's son, Albert, becomes taken with the horse and convinces his parents that he will be able to train the horse to take a harness and pull a plow.  As Albert trains his horse, Joey, the two of them form a bond.  Spielberg gets plenty of drama out of the nearly wordless communication necessary to teach Joey to eat out of a bucket, to stay or come on command, or to remain still as Albert fits a harness over his head.  Of course, Spielberg has a distinct knack for communicating sans words.  My guess is that if one were to watch War Horse with the sound off, it wouldn't take much to follow the ups and downs of the story.  Albert does manage to get Joey to plow the once useless plot, if only after the ground has been softened by the English rain.  But this doesn't end the hardships of the Narracotts.  Shortly after planting their crops, a thunderstorm upends their crops, and Ted must find some way to make the rent.  World War I has just broken out, and he decides to lease Joey to the English army.  Joey will be returned, if he survives.From here, Joey makes his way from owner to owner, crisscrossing a war ravaged Europe.  He begins in the care of an English officer, but ends up in the hands of two underage German brothers, a young French girl and her grandfather, and a German caretaker.  For a film that borrows so heavily from traditional Hollywood cinema, War Horse has a plenty of experimental elements.  And while Joey serves as a constant, each new set of characters he encounters function as a kind of vignette, as if Spielberg had connected several short films into a full length.  These vignettes allow the film to get away from the protagonist versus antagonist narrative found in most war films.  Because Joey traverses borders, our sympathies lie not with nation-states, the English versus the Germans, but with individual characters.  If there is a villain in the film, then it is the war itself.  This structure seems especially suited to WWI, perhaps one of the most singularly idiotic wars ever waged.Spielberg is borrowing heavily from the epics of the mid-twentieth century.  There's plenty of John Ford, Akira Kurosawa, Mikhail Kalatozishvili, David Lean, and early Stanley Kubrick in the DNA of War Horse.  He takes from these artists a painter's sense of how to fill up a canvas.  Here Spielberg is painting every little corner of the screen, to the extent where seeing the film in your living room is a completely different experience from viewing the film on the big screen.  Perhaps one of the most interesting choices in the film is the decision to obscure most of the violence when portraying one of the world's goriest wars.  This is an especially intriguing decision when you consider that Spielberg taught an entire generation how to recreate military violence in Saving Private Ryan.  And yet, just as many people were enraptured by Ryan's violence as were repulsed.  One particular scene in War Horse is arguably a more effective representation of violence than all of Ryan's gobs of blood.  In what is most likely a scene influenced by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, Spielberg cuts back and forth between images of English cavalry charging, German machine guns firing, and a slew of riderless horses.  The audience can easily fill in what occurs between each cut, perhaps more effectively than any filmmaker could.In War Horse we have a perfect coalition between Spielberg the craftsman and Spielberg the student of film.  Watching War Horse it becomes evident why the 1970s were the golden years of American cinema.  These directors were formally trained in film school where they were introduced to criticism that dissected the classics.  These directors didn't watch movies; they studied them.  And yet the movie isn't just fodder for film buffs to pick apart.  Any casual fan of Spielberg's work will find plenty of affecting moments in War Horse.  I saw the film over the holidays with my family, and at the conclusion of the movie, my mother turned to me and, rebuffing common assumptions, said, ""He made it like they used to.""  She's absolutely right, in a way.  This is a film that looks to the past for inspiration, but at the same time it cannot be mistaken for the work of anyone other than Spielberg himself.",5,A Lost Hollywood Epic,1331424000,"03 11,

This was a movie I was actually looking forward to mainly because it was a Spielberg movie. I really did end up liking it quite a bit.

I really enjoyed that and it made it feel shorter then it was. For those worried about this being like ""In Pursuit Of Honor"" I have to say that there is really no horse abuse in this at all so it's OK to watch this.

1524781,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0072GPPNC,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 1]","Movie - 4.5I think the bond between man and animal is often taken for granted these days. Just like parents bear children or people have friends, animals essentially serve the same role. They require our nurturing and care, cost us money, keep us company, and expose us to any number of emotions when they do something good or bad and especially when we gain or lose them in life. But when you break it down, the strength of that bond and the longtime results of that sustained relationship are what make the journey and experiences worthwhile. And then you have war. For whatever disagreement that couldn't be solved with diplomacy, people start fighting, things get ugly, and lots of people usually get hurt or die in the process. War Horse is the story about a young lad named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) whose father one day inherits the ownership of an equally young horse, which they'd name Joey. In raising Joey to work on their farm, Albert develops a very strong bond with the trusted stallion, until WWI and other financial circumstances force his father to sell Joey for the war. With Albert swearing to enlist and someday find his loyal steed, Joey, in the meantime would embark on a very tumultuous journey with nothing but friendship and the kindness of various strangers to keep him steady along the way.I think it's safe to say that war (in the broadest sense of nation vs. nation) has garnered a pretty negative connotation for itself. It causes pain and suffering to soldiers and non-soldiers alike, has a tendency for creating collateral damage, and a lot of things/people get lost in the chaos. Some could argue that war is a necessary evil, but it doesn't change the fact that the sheer amount of loss can be a painful thing to endure. What I find remarkable about this particular movie, though, is that Spielberg manages to show, not only the atrocities of war, but the spiritual strength of bonding. Whether it be Albert and Joey or the various other couplings we see throughout the film, I commend him for an outstanding effort in illustrating that before, and even throughout the events of war, that the power of friendship and comradery can prevail. Some reviews will argue that this film doesn't have a main character, but it does, and it's a very interesting one at that: Joey (yes, the horse). The multiple subplots between all the couplings (both man and animal) and the overall gamut of emotions that amount from all these experiences are vital in understanding just how valuable a bond can be, with the war illustrating the obvious flip-side. But even amidst the fighting, pay special attention to the meeting between an English and German soldier towards the end, as I feel that was the most pivotal point in proving the importance of bond and friendship to our humanity. The film is a true emotional roller coaster that, really, only could've better had the war scenes been more graphic. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful story.Video - 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1Director Steven Spielberg and DP (director of photography) Janusz Kaminski return for, yet another, collaboration. The last, and most recent, movies of theirs that I'd seen on BD were Minority Report and War of the Worlds. Suffice it to say, various people that aren't professional reviewers or aren't as well-versed in cinematography weren't happy with the bleach bypass technique used to give both films that trademark ""silvery shimmer."" With that being the case, viewers will be happy to know that the photography for War Horse is much simpler and less futuristically-stylized. The palette in this period piece is very down-to-earth with a lot of natural browns, burgundies, and other Fall colors giving it that dated, yet warm feeling. When the war hits, the look becomes considerably murkier with lots of low lighting, various blacks and grays, and yes, even one or two instances of bleach bypass. In terms of framing, though, I have to say that with the horse playing such a vital role in the story, it equates to a lot of very wide shots to accommodate him and the surrounding people, which in turn, only goes to accentuate the grandness of the atmosphere and the period itself even more (as witnessed in the big war scenes towards the end).In terms of the actual transfer, the movie was shot on 35mm then digitally processed at 4K resolution, which really shows in the video quality. The beginning of the film (on the farm before the war) has some amazing clarity in terms of coloring, blacks, and just the right amount of contrast that really help the audience build some empathy between Albert and Joey. The setting of the farm felt spacious enough as it was from just the camera angles alone, but the look of it (in terms of lighting, coloring, etc.) really did something for me. I've never been on a farm, personally, but through my various viewings and imaginations of it, the closeness of the people and animals on such a wide-open range is something I've always been fond of, and this particular presentation did a great job conveying that. Alternatively, when the tone of the movie changes to wartime, black levels take much more precedence giving the film a darker look, but showing razor-sharp details in the soldiers' uniforms, the dirt and mud of the earth, and the battered bodies of the men and animals in exchange. There's a little bit of intentional softness during these shots, but it's not enough for me to deny the greatness in the rest of the presentation.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1- French: DTS-HD HR 7.1- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles- English SDH, French, SpanishBeing a relatively high-budget film, not to mention a war movie, the sound mixing should come as no surprise to people expecting a great audio presentation. First and foremost, I have to commend the sound crew for the film's subtlety. The first half of the film is pretty much a kind of family drama with lots of low-volume effects, town and farmland ambiance, and some wonderful pieces of music by the legendary John Williams. It works to the effect of helping build that bond between Albert and Joey showing their innocence, growth, and eventual departure from one another. Likewise, the second half of the film becomes expectedly more aggressive through the madness of war with soldiers scurrying around, weapons being fired, and explosions popping up all over the place. Much like the first half in its successful attempt at creating a lighter mood, the second half achieves the polar opposite effect in creating a much darker one. I think a 5.1 mix would've sufficed enough, but War Horse was nominated for both Sound Mixing and Editing, with this 7.1 track being the proof in the pudding as to why.Dialogue is clear and mostly discernible (if you're not that great at understanding European accents, anyway) from the center channel and has the perfect level of volume to keep you in the story. It's never too loud or soft enough to be drowned out by everything else and is actually a welcome change to one of the BDs I recently watched that had this problem (that BD being Enemy of the State, where the surrounds are WAY louder than the dialogue can match in terms of volume). The front left and right speakers do a majority of the work, but the sides do an excellent job complimenting noises off-screen such as chatter, clutter, weapons firing, etc. with great directionality and separation. I was thoroughly impressed by rear speaker activity, though, as they put a lot of emphasis into the effects and music making the mix a very enveloping experience. Then, of course, there's the bass. LFEs (low frequency effects) are what I'm actually referring to when I say the sound mix has ""subtlety."" Horse galloping, thunder rumbling, and war noises have such a precise quality to them, that I absolutely recommend you listen to this movie on a good surround sound setup and prepare to have your room shake. My favorite aspect of the audio, however would have to be the score. As I said about Williams' score (also nominated for an Oscar, by the way), the music really does help make the story that more endearing, and it was a wonderful thing to hear in a 7-channel mix. Definitely show this disc of to your friends if they have any doubts about lossless audio.Extras - (n/a)This is actually a rental from Netflix at the moment. I could review the extras from the first disc, but I'm a bit of a completionist and would rather have the entire set to review, so I'll edit this whenever I own the entire 4-disc set.Overall - 5.0War Horse really caught me by surprise. I thought very little of this film from the initial trailers, but I'm so glad it exceeded my expectations. Instead of being just a story about a boy and his horse, it goes so much more beyond that. It's about bonding and the strength it give us to endure through tough, difficult situations like separation, loss, and other hardships we may encounter through life. But as long as the bond stays strong and we continue to drive ourselves, that feeling can go even beyond human perception and show through animals. The message itself is a great one, and my only real gripe with the film is that the wartime stuff wasn't graphic enough to really show how horrible it is. Then again, I could just watch grittier stuff like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. But with a very moving story, reference video and audio, and I guess a healthy amount of extras whenever I actually get around to reviewing them, War Horse comes highly recommended.",5,War Horse

1524787,A2GXKHLB4F48CW,B0072GPPNC,"trastevere ""trastevere""","[1, 1]","On paper, this film must have appeared to be a tired contrivance-- so many cliches, so little to hold it together. Yet, somehow, after making films for 40 years, Spielberg continues to get better and better at what he does better than anybody else. One might say that the Spielberg film is a contradiction to the phrase ""they don't make them like they used to."" Well, Spielberg does-- and in some ways better than anybody ever has. That isn't to say a movie like War Horse is going to offer new insights into the human condition, but it does breathe new life into the hopeful, sugar coated miracle stuff that Hollywood lives and breathes on.The images in this film are truly breathtaking. And, it should be said, they go beyond cliche and achieve poetry. It may be a kind of commercial poetry, but it is beautiful nonetheless. And though many of the situations feel fake (especially one with a sick child and her kindly grandfather), and some of the sequences just reek of manipulation, most of them work wonderfully. As much as I resisted, I teared up a couple of times. Cynics may disagree, but I think Spielberg has an extraordinary and authentic emotional sense-- and I choose to believe its genuine. The camera movement, the blocking-- the very conception of so many shots -- all function to communicate straight to the heart.Just contrast the simple emotion in this film to a much more famous-- but much more fraudulent film-- Forest Gump. Both films, of course, are wonderfully executed pieces of cinema magic. But while both are fairy tales, and both play upon our desire for wishes to come true, there's a big difference. In this film (like most of Spielberg's movies), the simple emotion comes from basic truths. People make fools of themselves, horses (and farms) get lost to the boss man and to war. Hard work means a lot but it doesn't always produce the desired result. But sometimes, you get back what you lose. Life isn't random, but it does spin off many colors. In Forest Gump, on the other hand, the meek not only inherit the earth, they also get to own their own conglomerate! And not only that-- those who work the hardest for change are shown up as fools. Thus, Forest Gump turns out to be based on a Big Lie -- the lie that Reagan sold to America-- that brains and creative thinking-- and daring-- were the road to death (Jennie) or disfigurement (Dan). Of course we know now that Reagan and his Big Lie actually destroyed the middle class-- and ruined our country. But Big Business keeps propping up the Reagan brand since his laissez-faire narrative made them rich at everyone else's expense.Spielberg's film, as mentioned before, is also a fairy tale. But it doesn't pretend (as does Forest Gump) to offer a new spin to a key decade in history. Gump is a travesty of the '60s-- and a slap in the face of real heroes like MLK and Robert Kennedy. War Horse's connection with WW1 is purely casual. This is not a film about a moment in time-- it is just a series of warm and fuzzy dreams that show us as we would like to be, and remind us that life is better when we are humble, kind, and a little brave. No-- we don't get Bubba Gump Shrimp company t-shirts or the Porsche that Bob Zemeckis probably drives around in. What we get-- and keep-- are our souls.So-- don't go see War Horse expecting a serious work of art (unless you accept Damien Hirst's definition of art as ""anything done super well."") But do go if you want to experience Hollywood magic (for better or for worse) at its finest.",4,Spielberg in fine form,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,3515,"['paper', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'appeared', 'be', 'tired', 'contrivance', 'so', 'many', 'cliches', 'so', 'little', 'hold', 'together', 'somehow', 'making', 'films', '40', 'years', 'Spielberg', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'what', 'better', 'anybody', 'else', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'contradiction', 'phrase', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'used', 'Well', 'Spielberg', 'ways', 'better', 'anybody', 'ever', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'War', 'Horse', 'going', 'offer', 'new', 'insights', 'human', 'condition', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'hopeful', 'sugar', 'coated', 'miracle', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'lives', 'breathes', 'on.The', 'images', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'go', 'cliche', 'achieve', 'poetry', 'may', 'be', 'kind', 'commercial', 'poetry', 'beautiful', 'nonetheless', 'many', 'situations', 'feel', 'fake', 'especially', 'one', 'sick', 'child', 'kindly', 'grandfather', 'sequences', 'just', 'reek', 'manipulation', 'most', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'As', 'much', 'resisted', 'teared', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'Cynics', 'may', 'disagree', 'think', 'Spielberg', 'extraordinary', 'authentic', 'emotional', 'sense', 'choose', 'believe', 'genuine', 'camera', 'movement', 'blocking', 'very', 'conception', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'function', 'communicate', 'straight', 'heart.Just', 'contrast', 'simple', 'emotion', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'much', 'more', 'fraudulent', 'film', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'films', 'course', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'executed', 'pieces', 'cinema', 'magic', 'are', 'fairy', 'tales', 'play', 'desire', 'wishes', 'come', 'true', 'big', 'difference', 'film', 'most', 'Spielberg', 'movies', 'simple', 'emotion', 'basic', 'truths', 'People', 'make', 'fools', 'horses', 'farms', 'get', 'lost', 'boss', 'man', 'war', 'Hard', 'work', 'lot', ""n't"", 'always', 'produce', 'desired', 'result', 'sometimes', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'lose', 'Life', ""n't"", 'random', 'spin', 'off', 'many', 'colors', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'other', 'hand', 'meek', 'not', 'only', 'inherit', 'earth', 'also', 'get', 'own', 'own', 'conglomerate', 'not', 'only', 'that', 'who', 'work', 'hardest', 'change', 'are', 'shown', 'up', 'fools', 'Thus', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'out', 'be', 'based', 'Big', 'Lie', 'lie', 'Reagan', 'sold', 'America', 'brains', 'creative', 'thinking', 'daring', 'were', 'road', 'death', 'Jennie', 'disfigurement', 'Dan', 'course', 'know', 'now', 'Reagan', 'Big', 'Lie', 'actually', 'destroyed', 'middle', 'class', 'ruined', 'country', 'Big', 'Business', 'keeps', 'propping', 'up', 'Reagan', 'brand', 'laissez-faire', 'narrative', 'made', 'rich', 'everyone', 'else', 'expense.Spielberg', 'film', 'mentioned', 'also', 'fairy', 'tale', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'offer', 'new', 'spin', 'key', 'decade', 'history', 'Gump', 'travesty', ""'60s"", 'slap', 'face', 'real', 'heroes', 'MLK', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'War', 'Horse', 'connection', 'WW1', 'purely', 'casual', 'not', 'film', 'moment', 'time', 'just', 'series', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'dreams', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'remind', 'life', 'better', 'when', 'are', 'humble', 'kind', 'little', 'brave', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Bubba', 'Gump', 'Shrimp', 'company', 't-shirts', 'Porsche', 'Bob', 'Zemeckis', 'probably', 'around', 'What', 'get', 'keep', 'are', 'souls.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'War', 'Horse', 'expecting', 'serious', 'work', 'art', 'accept', 'Damien', 'Hirst', 'definition', 'art', 'anything', 'done', 'super', 'well', 'do', 'go', 'want', 'experience', 'Hollywood', 'magic', 'better', 'worse', 'finest']",N/A
1524788,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0072GPPNC,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","Based on a book by Michael Morpurgo and adapted by two Oscar-nominated writers Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" has a lot of great footage in it. Every scene is beautifully shot and most actors deliver solid performances. Battle scenes are fierce. The no man's land scene is poignant and even humorous. All these sequences are fine, showing what Spielberg can do. However, as a whole, ""War Horse"" just doesn't work well.It is a story of a thoroughbred named Joey and a young boy Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) living in Devon, England. When the World War I breaks out, Joey is sent across the Channel with British soldiers to the battlefield. Albert, still too young to enlist the army, vows that he will find Joey no matter what it takes.It is an uplifting story, I admit, but some part of the filmed adaptation just doesn't convince. Why does Mr. Narracott (Peter Mullan) insist on purchasing Joey, a thoroughbred, when he knows this is not a good idea to plough for his farm? Why does the French grandfather let his granddaughter ride the horse alone on the hill when he should know it is still wartime?All these things would not be a big problem if the story is told from Joey's viewpoint, but on a big screen, they serve to no purpose but to further the story, which becomes very sentimental. Spielberg is after all a master of audience manipulation (and I don't think it's a bad thing), but compared with his past works like ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,"" his hand to manipulate is too conspicuous here.Finally, the film is basically a war movie and includes a combat scene. Unlike his ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the mass carnage of World War I is toned down, but I am not sure ""War Horse"" should be called a family picture. ""War Horse"" is certainly a touching film, but that is partly because there are so many who are not as lucky as the film's heroes.",3,"(3.5 STARS) It's a Spielberg Movie, For Better or Worse",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1934,"['Based', 'book', 'Michael', 'Morpurgo', 'adapted', 'two', 'Oscar-nominated', 'writers', 'Lee', 'Hall', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Horse', 'lot', 'great', 'footage', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'most', 'actors', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'fierce', 'man', 'land', 'scene', 'poignant', 'even', 'humorous', 'sequences', 'are', 'fine', 'showing', 'what', 'Spielberg', 'can', 'do', 'However', 'whole', 'War', 'Horse', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'well.It', 'story', 'thoroughbred', 'named', 'Joey', 'young', 'boy', 'Albert', 'Narracott', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'living', 'Devon', 'England', 'When', 'World', 'War', 'breaks', 'out', 'Joey', 'sent', 'Channel', 'British', 'soldiers', 'battlefield', 'Albert', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'enlist', 'army', 'will', 'find', 'Joey', 'matter', 'what', 'uplifting', 'story', 'admit', 'part', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'just', ""n't"", 'convince', 'Why', 'Mr.', 'Narracott', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'insist', 'purchasing', 'Joey', 'thoroughbred', 'when', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'plough', 'farm', 'Why', 'French', 'grandfather', 'let', 'granddaughter', 'ride', 'horse', 'alone', 'hill', 'when', 'should', 'know', 'still', 'wartime', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'problem', 'story', 'told', 'Joey', 'viewpoint', 'big', 'screen', 'serve', 'purpose', 'further', 'story', 'very', 'sentimental', 'Spielberg', 'master', 'audience', 'manipulation', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'compared', 'past', 'works', 'E.T', 'Extra-Terrestrial', 'hand', 'manipulate', 'too', 'conspicuous', 'here.Finally', 'film', 'basically', 'war', 'movie', 'combat', 'scene', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'mass', 'carnage', 'World', 'War', 'toned', 'down', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'War', 'Horse', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'family', 'picture', 'War', 'Horse', 'certainly', 'touching', 'film', 'partly', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'lucky', 'film', 'heroes']",N/A
1524789,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0072GPPNC,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","In Dartmoor, England a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), watches in fascination as a thoroughbred colt is born. The baby horse is a beautiful animal and watching the equine run through the fields soon becomes Albert's new hobby. The day comes when the horse is taken to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) comes to market to buy a plow horse, but when he sees the magnificent beast and spots his landlord smirking on the other side of the fence he ends up paying a small fortune to purchase the animal. Albert names the horse Joey and sets to training the animal. When the landlord threatens to take the family farm, Albert trains the animal to wear a horse collar and plow a field. However, when a destructive storm ruins the family's turnip crop, Ted is forced to sell the horse to the British cavalry for the war that has just been declared (1914). The animal is purchased by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who promises Albert that Joey will be his personal mount and he will return the horse to him after the war. It's off to France and after a foolish offensive Joey loses his mount and is captured by the Germans. What follows is an extraordinary journey for Joey as he changes hands from one owner to the next. The horse has a remarkable spirit of determination and raises to every challenge that comes before it. Meanwhile, Albert has joined the Army and is fighting on the Western front and carries with him an illustration of Joey. He's convinced they will find each other again.WAR HORSE is an impressive movie. Visually, the film is a cinematic kaleidoscope of stunning wonder. It's like watching a Terrence Malick film, but with an actual story and lots of action.The main character in the story is Joey, so if you don't like horses, you might not like the film. However, the human actors all do a fine job. Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes in a couple of scenes, but each of them excellently portrays the emotional depth of their characters. There are some who might say that the movie is filled with characterizations and no real acting, but this isn't the case. Most of the acting in the movie isn't done in broad gestures and over articulation. Instead, the real acting happens in the small moments: the way the eyes light up, the gentle turn of the head, etc. For instance, there is a scene where a German regiment invades a small farm and takes everything away from the farmer and his granddaughter who live there. There really isn't much action that happens in this scene and there aren't many words. However, volumes are spoken between the characters in how they say things and in the little things they do. WAR HORSE is filled with scenes like that.Even if you aren't a horse or animal person, you can take a lot away from WAR HORSE. Though a horse is the main and title character, the movie is really about hope, perseverance, and determination. It is a story about the deep friendship between two kindred spirits. It's an ancient story that's been told again and again throughout history (the Biblical story of Joseph, ODYSSEY, THE AENIED, E.T., etc.). It's a story that resonates because it touches something deep within each of us. It's a grand old story, but in WAR HORSE it's just told through the eyes of a horse and his boy.",5,A Horse and His Boy,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,3301,"['Dartmoor', 'England', 'teenage', 'boy', 'named', 'Albert', 'Narracott', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'watches', 'fascination', 'thoroughbred', 'colt', 'born', 'baby', 'horse', 'beautiful', 'animal', 'watching', 'equine', 'run', 'fields', 'soon', 'Albert', 'new', 'hobby', 'day', 'when', 'horse', 'taken', 'auction', 'Albert', 'father', 'Ted', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'market', 'buy', 'plow', 'horse', 'when', 'magnificent', 'beast', 'spots', 'landlord', 'smirking', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'up', 'paying', 'small', 'fortune', 'purchase', 'animal', 'Albert', 'horse', 'Joey', 'sets', 'training', 'animal', 'When', 'landlord', 'take', 'family', 'farm', 'Albert', 'animal', 'wear', 'horse', 'collar', 'plow', 'field', 'However', 'when', 'destructive', 'storm', 'family', 'turnip', 'crop', 'Ted', 'forced', 'sell', 'horse', 'British', 'cavalry', 'war', 'just', 'been', 'declared', '1914', 'animal', 'purchased', 'Captain', 'Nicholls', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'who', 'Albert', 'Joey', 'will', 'be', 'personal', 'mount', 'will', 'return', 'horse', 'war', 'France', 'foolish', 'offensive', 'Joey', 'mount', 'captured', 'Germans', 'What', 'extraordinary', 'journey', 'Joey', 'hands', 'one', 'owner', 'next', 'horse', 'remarkable', 'spirit', 'determination', 'challenge', 'Meanwhile', 'Albert', 'joined', 'Army', 'fighting', 'Western', 'front', 'illustration', 'Joey', 'convinced', 'will', 'find', 'other', 'again.WAR', 'HORSE', 'impressive', 'movie', 'Visually', 'film', 'cinematic', 'kaleidoscope', 'stunning', 'wonder', 'watching', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'film', 'actual', 'story', 'lots', 'action.The', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'Joey', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'horses', 'might', 'not', 'film', 'However', 'human', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'are', 'only', 'screen', 'few', 'minutes', 'couple', 'scenes', 'excellently', 'emotional', 'depth', 'characters', 'are', 'who', 'might', 'say', 'movie', 'filled', 'characterizations', 'real', 'acting', ""n't"", 'case', 'Most', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'done', 'broad', 'gestures', 'articulation', 'Instead', 'real', 'acting', 'happens', 'small', 'moments', 'way', 'eyes', 'light', 'up', 'gentle', 'turn', 'head', 'etc', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'German', 'regiment', 'small', 'farm', 'everything', 'away', 'farmer', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'scene', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'words', 'However', 'volumes', 'are', 'spoken', 'characters', 'how', 'say', 'things', 'little', 'things', 'do', 'WAR', 'HORSE', 'filled', 'scenes', 'that.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'horse', 'animal', 'person', 'can', 'take', 'lot', 'away', 'WAR', 'HORSE', 'horse', 'main', 'title', 'character', 'movie', 'really', 'hope', 'perseverance', 'determination', 'story', 'deep', 'friendship', 'two', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'ancient', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'again', 'again', 'history', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Joseph', 'ODYSSEY', 'THE', 'AENIED', 'E.T.', 'etc.', 'story', 'something', 'deep', 'grand', 'old', 'story', 'WAR', 'HORSE', 'just', 'told', 'eyes', 'horse', 'boy']",N/A

Suffice it to say that although the book is a bit melodramatic, it is far more believable and touching  than this wreck of a movie.  As usual, Spielberg's bigotry towards the German people seeps through and I can't help but wonder if part of the change in storyline from book to movie was driven by his unwillingness to show Germans in a positive light.  The acting is adequate, but I have to say that none of the actors ever had me convinced of their love for the title animal.  It is surprising that the director who gave us some of the most moving combat footage ever in a movie in Saving Private Ryan, seemed far less capable in communicating the terror and horror associated with trench warfare.

Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" is based on a similar concept...only instead of a bench-sitting, story-telling Southerner, this time the journeyer is of the equestrian variety.For a basic plot summary, ""War Horse"" is a conglomeration of tales surrounding a rather remarkable horse.  Raised by a young boy as a plow horse in an Irish farm, the horse eventually finds itself in the thick of World War I, where it changes hands on a number of occasions, building drama along the way.At its core, ""War Horse"" is two things:First, it is a World War I period piece, which it succeeds at just fine.  The battle scenes are intense, the time period looks/feels about right, and the impact of the war on the surrounding territories is a nice addition that usually isn't covered in these sorts of flicks.Primarily, though, ""War Horse"" is a human-centered drama that tells its story through the travels of the horse.  Every person who comes into contact with the horse has an interesting backstory of their own, and Spielberg does a good job of fleshing them all out and still keeping them relevant in the end.The only reason this isn't a five-star film is because some of the situations the horse encounters fall (at least in my opinion) widely beyond the realm of possibility (in favor of high drama, of course).Overall, ""War Horse"" is a solid film that will attract a wide variety of audiences.  Whether you prefer action/adventure, romance, human drama, animal tales, or war stories, this movie has something you will enjoy.  The film can also be enjoyed by all but the youngest of children (as the war scenes are not too graphic as to scare off grade-schoolers).",4,If Forrest Gump Were A Horse,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,1801,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'are', 'familiar', 'concept', 'journey', 'being', 'more', 'resolution', 'film-making', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Horse', 'based', 'similar', 'concept', 'only', 'instead', 'bench-sitting', 'story-telling', 'Southerner', 'time', 'journeyer', 'equestrian', 'variety.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'War', 'Horse', 'conglomeration', 'tales', 'surrounding', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'horse', 'Raised', 'young', 'boy', 'plow', 'horse', 'Irish', 'farm', 'horse', 'eventually', 'thick', 'World', 'War', 'where', 'hands', 'number', 'occasions', 'building', 'drama', 'way.At', 'core', 'War', 'Horse', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'period', 'piece', 'just', 'fine', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'time', 'period', 'looks/feels', 'right', 'impact', 'war', 'surrounding', 'territories', 'nice', 'addition', 'usually', ""n't"", 'covered', 'sorts', 'flicks.Primarily', 'War', 'Horse', 'human-centered', 'drama', 'story', 'travels', 'horse', 'Every', 'person', 'who', 'contact', 'horse', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'own', 'Spielberg', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'still', 'keeping', 'relevant', 'end.The', 'only', 'reason', ""n't"", 'five-star', 'film', 'situations', 'horse', 'encounters', 'fall', 'least', 'opinion', 'widely', 'realm', 'possibility', 'favor', 'high', 'drama', 'course', '.Overall', 'War', 'Horse', 'solid', 'film', 'will', 'attract', 'wide', 'variety', 'audiences', 'prefer', 'action/adventure', 'romance', 'human', 'drama', 'animal', 'tales', 'war', 'stories', 'movie', 'something', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'youngest', 'children', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'graphic', 'scare', 'off', 'grade-schoolers']",N/A
