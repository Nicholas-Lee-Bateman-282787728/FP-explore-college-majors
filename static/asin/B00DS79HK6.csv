I was unfamiliar with the actors involved, but the majority of them are Country music singers from Canada. So, the music in the film is good, and I am glad they incorporated it into the story. I know I usually review faith-based films, so I think I need to mention that is one is not. However, it is family-friendly and clean and one that does cover forgiveness and the importance of family and friends who become like family. There are poignant moments, but also romance and comedy in the mix. It's not a great, sure to be a classic, but it is a good film for your personal dvd library to have on hand to watch with friends and family.Disclaimer: I received a copy of the dvd from Flyby Promotions for review purposes.

1660885,A6D07P6DHMXIP,B00DS79HK6,"L. Courtney ""Book Mom""","[7, 7]","I chose to review this DVD with some trepidation. I can never tell about Christmas movies. I either love them or hate them. I can't seem to remain neutral. I have a few old favorites, but Coming Home for Christmas looked like it may be a good addition to my collection.Sisters have been estranged for five years. When their parents decide to separate, the girls begin to come together. With the help of some new friends they plan a Christmas in their old house and invite both parents. Unfortunately it seems as if all may fall apart and the family may never have a chance to reconnect.This made my good Christmas movie list. It was really enjoyable. Here are some of my favorite things about Coming Home For Christmas.*It was very family friendly. I don't have any reservations about sharing it with my kids as a family Christmas movie.*It was sweet without being too sappy (most of the time). There were a few times it bordered the sappy line, but mostly it was just sweet.*The characters were &#34;real&#34; people and didn't seem sugary sweet or unreal. They were sometimes not nice. They didn't always tell the truth. They didn't always make the best decisions. But I found it easy to relate to them.*The ending was good (sorry for the spoiler) but not so perfect as to seem unbelievable.It really was a Christmas movie I could like. I can definitely recommend this one.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this movie in exchange for an honest review.

Until one day when Kate did what Melanie deemed to be unforgivable. Five years later, the girls still aren&#8217;t talking, which is taking a toll on their parents, who decide to separate.Kate decides to make it her mission to not only bring her parents back together for Christmas, but also to restore the loving friendship she once shared with her sister and best friend. Kate longs for the days when her family was close and the fond memories they shared in a house her parents have since lost due to the bad economy.But will her plan succeed?Melanie seems to have the perfect life. She married into money, has a 5,000 square foot home, indulges in spa days, and has a seemingly wide circle of influential friends. But is everything as it seems? When Kate discovers her sister&#8217;s real life, will she be able to convince Melanie to make amends?Throw into the mix a budding romance with a handsome soldier, some humor, the loss of a father, and the sad background of one who never had a family and you&#8217;ve got an interesting mix meshed into a delightful story.While Coming Home for Christmas is not a Christian movie, it is a feel-good, fun-to-watch show that highlights some great discussion topics, such as,Forgiveness &#8211; can Melanie ever forgive Kate for what she did? The Bible tells us to forgive others in various passages in the Bible, including Matthew 6:15.Importance of family &#8211; Kate and Melanie grew up in a family that shared a lot of love for each other. They spent time together, sang together, and made each other a priority. God highly values family.Grief &#8211; throughout the story, we see the grief of a young boy who has lost his father. He&#8217;s not the only one who has suffered loss. Enter Mike who knows firsthand all about grief and loneliness. The Bible discusses how we can comfort others after knowing firsthand the way God comforts us in our time of need. (2 Cor 1:4).Marriage &#8211; Can Kate and Melanie&#8217;s parents move past their differences and once again experience the deep love they had for each other? Marriage is of utmost importance to God.I highly recommend Coming Home for Christmas, especially for those mom-daughter nights or movie nights with the girls.

Such is the case for sisters Kate ( Carly McKillip) and Melanie (Britt McKillop) O'Brien who have remain close despite their differences at least while they were young. Kate has always lived in the shadow of her sister Melanie, who was outgoing in school, always had plenty of boys who wanted to date her and has always been beautiful and successful at anything that crosses her path. Quite different from Kate who was shy and didn't see herself as beautiful when hidden behind the glasses she needed to wear. During a family Christmas, the O'Brien family decided to incorporate a time capsule to be opened at a later date. It was during that time that the division in the O'Brien family began. When Kate buried her beloved sisters favorite marionette in the backyard as her contribution. In order to discover the time capsule, all members of the family must be present because they each possess a portion of the clue to find it again.Only the family never dreamed that years later, their family would be torn apart. When Kate discovers that Melanie's soon-to-be husband is busy flirting at their wedding with a bridesmaid, Kate storms out telling her sister she can't be a part of watching her destruction of the perfect life. Without telling her the specifics, she abruptly leaves and places the parents at odds now that the girls are much older. Somehow the parental authority doesn't hold much weight. When faced with the dismiss of their daughters relationship, even Al (George Canyon) and Wendy( Amy Jo Johnson) begin to fall apart in their marriage beginning when the family home goes into foreclosure and they end up in another home. Now faced with no longer having anything in common, Wendy and Al decide a separation and divorce are their only hope for a future.However when the girls learn that their parents are divorcing based on the problems stemming from Kate and Melanie's conflict, they decide to see if one last family Christmas in their old home will be just the right about of kindling to fan the flames of restoration for all of them. Only now the family home has been sold to Mike (Ben Hollingsworth) a Marine veteran and woodworker. Is is possible to pull off the ultimate Christmas miracle? You'll have to pick this one up to find out.I received Coming Home for Christmas by director Vanessa Parise and Fly By Promotions for my honest review and did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review. This is such a heart warming family movie that I believe everyone can relate to. For me, even though my brother and I were close, we had our moments that undoubtedly tested our parents resolve. I love how they are willing to work together despite their differences and try hard to work through things without finding forgiveness with one another first. We see how well that works later in the movie. This is a movie about hope, faith and forgiveness despite how things may initially look on the outside and is a wonderful warm movie to begin the Christmas season with. I'd rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and will look forward to incorporating this into our Christmas movie time each year. Finally a great movie with a message that is perfect for families.",5,A perfect movie for the Christmas Season with a powerful message!,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,3316,"['As', 'long', 'have', 'siblings', 'are', 'bound', 'come', 'point', 'where', 'conflict', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'relationship', 'Such', 'case', 'sisters', 'Kate', 'Carly', 'McKillip', 'Melanie', 'Britt', 'McKillop', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'have', 'remain', 'close', 'differences', 'least', 'were', 'young', 'Kate', 'always', 'lived', 'shadow', 'sister', 'Melanie', 'who', 'was', 'outgoing', 'school', 'always', 'had', 'plenty', 'boys', 'who', 'wanted', 'date', 'always', 'been', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'anything', 'path', 'Quite', 'different', 'Kate', 'who', 'was', 'shy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'beautiful', 'when', 'hidden', 'glasses', 'needed', 'wear', 'family', 'Christmas', ""O'Brien"", 'family', 'decided', 'incorporate', 'time', 'capsule', 'be', 'opened', 'later', 'date', 'was', 'time', 'division', ""O'Brien"", 'family', 'began', 'When', 'Kate', 'buried', 'beloved', 'sisters', 'favorite', 'marionette', 'backyard', 'contribution', 'order', 'discover', 'time', 'capsule', 'members', 'family', 'must', 'be', 'present', 'possess', 'portion', 'clue', 'find', 'again.Only', 'family', 'never', 'dreamed', 'years', 'later', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'torn', 'apart', 'When', 'Kate', 'Melanie', 'soon-to-be', 'husband', 'busy', 'flirting', 'wedding', 'bridesmaid', 'Kate', 'out', 'telling', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'watching', 'destruction', 'perfect', 'life', 'telling', 'specifics', 'abruptly', 'parents', 'odds', 'now', 'girls', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'Somehow', 'parental', 'authority', ""n't"", 'hold', 'much', 'weight', 'When', 'faced', 'dismiss', 'daughters', 'relationship', 'even', 'Al', 'George', 'Canyon', 'Wendy', 'Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'marriage', 'beginning', 'when', 'family', 'home', 'foreclosure', 'end', 'up', 'home', 'Now', 'faced', 'longer', 'having', 'anything', 'common', 'Wendy', 'Al', 'decide', 'separation', 'divorce', 'are', 'only', 'hope', 'future.However', 'when', 'girls', 'learn', 'parents', 'are', 'divorcing', 'based', 'problems', 'stemming', 'Kate', 'Melanie', 'conflict', 'decide', 'see', 'one', 'last', 'family', 'Christmas', 'old', 'home', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'kindling', 'fan', 'flames', 'restoration', 'Only', 'now', 'family', 'home', 'been', 'sold', 'Mike', 'Ben', 'Hollingsworth', 'Marine', 'veteran', 'woodworker', 'possible', 'pull', 'off', 'ultimate', 'Christmas', 'miracle', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'find', 'out.I', 'received', 'Coming', 'Home', 'Christmas', 'director', 'Vanessa', 'Parise', 'Fly', 'Promotions', 'honest', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'favorable', 'review', 'such', 'heart', 'warming', 'family', 'movie', 'believe', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'brother', 'were', 'close', 'had', 'moments', 'undoubtedly', 'tested', 'parents', 'resolve', 'love', 'how', 'are', 'willing', 'work', 'together', 'differences', 'try', 'hard', 'work', 'things', 'finding', 'forgiveness', 'one', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'later', 'movie', 'movie', 'hope', 'faith', 'forgiveness', 'how', 'things', 'may', 'initially', 'look', 'outside', 'wonderful', 'warm', 'movie', 'begin', 'Christmas', 'season', ""'d"", 'rate', 'one', '5', '5', 'stars', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'incorporating', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'time', 'year', 'Finally', 'great', 'movie', 'message', 'perfect', 'families']",Coming Home for Christmas
