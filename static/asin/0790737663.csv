106405,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0790737663,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I love Whoopi Goldberg. Haley Joel Osment is adorable, and Gerard Depardieu is a charming Frenchman. How could this movie lose?Albert (Osment) is left without family when his mother is killed in a car accident in Las Vegas. He had plenty of friends in the circus (du Soliel, I think), but no family at all. But in his mother's will, she named her foster sister and best friend from her childhood, Harriet (Whoopi) as Albert's godmother and guardian. Harriet had not seen her in years, didn't even know she had a son, and as she put it, didn't have a motherly bone in her body.So who is Bogus? He was originally a drawing in the coloring book the stewardess gave Albert during the flight from Las Vegas to Newark, New Jersey, where Harriet lived. Once Albert drew him a mouth, he started to talk to him. When his seat-mates (both adults) asked him who he was talking to, he said ""nobody,"" and took his coloring book with him to the restroom. There he started crying because he missed his mother so much, and Bogus called to him in a muffled voice from the pages of the coloring book. Finally he asked to come out, and turned out to be a tall Frenchman who became Albert's best friend. Only problem was, nobody could see him or hear him but Albert.Or can they?The individual incidents in the story are not all that big, except from the perspective of a little boy, but they add up to a very touching story which oddly combines fantasy and reality in such a way as to be really quite consistent and believable. In fact, at one point the babysitter falls asleep in front of a TV that is playing ""Harvey,"" thus giving us all a reference point for the thread of the story. Harvey was sort of real, too.I'd call Bogus a guardian angel, except that he never has wings and is not at all pious. He's quite playful, although he does warn Albert when what he's doing is a ""very bad idea.""Have a box of tissues handy, although the laughs are more frequent than the tears.",5,"Funny, Tenderhearted, Magical and Fine",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1958,"['love', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'adorable', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'charming', 'Frenchman', 'How', 'could', 'movie', 'lose', 'Albert', 'Osment', 'left', 'family', 'when', 'mother', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'had', 'plenty', 'friends', 'circus', 'du', 'Soliel', 'think', 'family', 'mother', 'will', 'named', 'foster', 'sister', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Harriet', 'Whoopi', 'Albert', 'godmother', 'guardian', 'Harriet', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'son', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'motherly', 'bone', 'body.So', 'who', 'Bogus', 'was', 'originally', 'drawing', 'coloring', 'book', 'stewardess', 'gave', 'Albert', 'flight', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Newark', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'Harriet', 'lived', 'Once', 'Albert', 'drew', 'mouth', 'started', 'talk', 'When', 'seat-mates', 'adults', 'asked', 'who', 'was', 'talking', 'said', 'nobody', 'took', 'coloring', 'book', 'restroom', 'started', 'crying', 'missed', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'Bogus', 'called', 'muffled', 'voice', 'pages', 'coloring', 'book', 'Finally', 'asked', 'come', 'out', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'tall', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'became', 'Albert', 'best', 'friend', 'Only', 'problem', 'was', 'nobody', 'could', 'see', 'hear', 'Albert.Or', 'can', 'individual', 'incidents', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'big', 'perspective', 'little', 'boy', 'add', 'up', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'oddly', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'really', 'quite', 'consistent', 'believable', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'babysitter', 'asleep', 'front', 'TV', 'playing', 'Harvey', 'thus', 'giving', 'reference', 'point', 'thread', 'story', 'Harvey', 'was', 'sort', 'real', 'too.I', ""'d"", 'call', 'Bogus', 'guardian', 'angel', 'never', 'wings', 'not', 'pious', 'quite', 'playful', 'warn', 'Albert', 'when', 'what', 'doing', 'very', 'bad', 'idea', 'Have', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'laughs', 'are', 'more', 'frequent', 'tears']",N/A
106406,AY12DBB0U420B,0790737663,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain rack DVD movie was ""Bogus"" starring Whoopi Goldberg and Gerard Depardieu. The movie had to do with a lady in Las Vegas, a cultural oasis on the great American desert, who died suddenly in a car accident. She had a little boy and no relatives, husband or known father of the boy.  Now, what do you do with the sweet little boy? Well, in her will she suggested that a caretaker might be her orphanage sister (read roommate) who happened to be Whoopi Goldberg and who was living in Newark, New Jersey, the garden spot of the eastern seaboard. So, the poor frightened little boy took his first plane trip to this wonderful uplifting location. Well, he developed an unseen (to anyone but him) friend, Bogus. The boy, Bogus and Whoopi shared an apartment and gradually developed a friendship. Whoopi, after a few months with the boy, even finally was able to see Bogus. So, If I was asked what I thought of this little story, I'd have to say that the word sappy came to mind. The movie is humorous in places. I was delighted to see Newark again, after a relaxing break of 50 years. I particularly enjoyed all of Whoopi's difficulties with the parking police. I've known people just like that!. All in all, the movie seemed rather long and I kept looking at my watch and wondering when it would finally be over..Gary Peterson",3,The Movie Seemed Rather Long.,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1339,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain', 'rack', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'Bogus', 'starring', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'movie', 'had', 'do', 'lady', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'cultural', 'oasis', 'great', 'American', 'desert', 'who', 'died', 'suddenly', 'car', 'accident', 'had', 'little', 'boy', 'relatives', 'husband', 'known', 'father', 'boy', 'Now', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'sweet', 'little', 'boy', 'Well', 'will', 'suggested', 'caretaker', 'might', 'be', 'orphanage', 'sister', 'read', 'roommate', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'Newark', 'New', 'Jersey', 'garden', 'spot', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'So', 'poor', 'frightened', 'little', 'boy', 'took', 'first', 'plane', 'trip', 'wonderful', 'uplifting', 'location', 'Well', 'developed', 'unseen', 'anyone', 'friend', 'Bogus', 'boy', 'Bogus', 'Whoopi', 'shared', 'apartment', 'gradually', 'developed', 'friendship', 'Whoopi', 'few', 'months', 'boy', 'even', 'finally', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Bogus', 'So', 'was', 'asked', 'what', 'thought', 'little', 'story', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'word', 'sappy', 'came', 'mind', 'movie', 'humorous', 'places', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'Newark', 'again', 'relaxing', 'break', '50', 'years', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Whoopi', 'difficulties', 'parking', 'police', ""'ve"", 'known', 'people', 'just', 'movie', 'seemed', 'rather', 'long', 'kept', 'looking', 'watch', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'over..Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A
