815083,ANP46RYUYH2BH,B0001WTVJ8,Gloria J. Green,"[8, 8]","If you are a fan of romance and romantic movies, this is a keeper.  If you are a fan of Tim Matheson (major fan here) and Jaclyn Smith this is the movie for you.  Basically it is the girl meets boy/boy meets girl and they don't get along.  He can't stand her and thinks she is just some city reporter who has no clue of what life is like in a remote area.  She thinks he is arrogant, conceited etc...  Of course, one of the village women plays cupid and matchmaker and to see how it all comes together you have to watch the movie.  It is a wonderful romance movie with a beautiful ending.  There is much more in the middle, but I don't want to ruin it or give it all away.  Watch it, you won't regret it.""Navigating the Heart""",5,Ahhhh Romance!!!!,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,726,"['are', 'fan', 'romance', 'romantic', 'movies', 'keeper', 'are', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'major', 'fan', 'here', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'movie', 'Basically', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy/boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'just', 'city', 'reporter', 'who', 'clue', 'what', 'life', 'remote', 'area', 'arrogant', 'conceited', 'etc', 'course', 'one', 'village', 'women', 'cupid', 'matchmaker', 'see', 'how', 'together', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'romance', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'middle', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'give', 'away', 'Watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'Navigating', 'Heart']",Navigating the Heart

There is a storm scene on the boat where it looks like they might drown. The guy is in his underwear and is under a blanket with the girl with his legs around her.  Also, the movie has a sex scene in it later on. Profanity consists of ""hell"" and ""damn.""
