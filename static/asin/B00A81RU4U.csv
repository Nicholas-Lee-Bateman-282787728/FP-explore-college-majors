1606730,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B00A81RU4U,Addicted2Amazon!,"[37, 42]","The Ballet Physique Workout does NOT fool around!  If you want to get muscle definition, you WILL get it with this!This collection contains two killer ballet barre-style workouts:  the 60-minute ""Signature Sculpt,"" and the 45-minute ""Amped Up,"" billed as a shorter but more intense workout.  You use a barre (no need to buy one, a chair that's high enough is a perfect subsitute), light weights, the inflatable medicine ball that comes with the DVD...and good old gravity! The moves all ballet/dance based:  a lot of plies, leg lifts forward and back, hip rolls, tucks, pulsing on bent legs...You get the idea.  There's video of it online; check it out!Though it's a pricier DVD program, you actually get plenty for your buck:  2 well-produced, incredibly challenging and effective workouts and an inflatable medicine ball (referred to here as a playground ball).I wanted to try this style of workout because I so enjoy pilates and dance-based sculpting workouts (for example, I LOVE Tracy Anderson's sculpting workouts and the Exhale Core Fusion workouts).  I like using a chair and my own body weight to sculpt that long, lean look.  Soo...this was my first barre-style workout...and I think it may be my last.  I'll explain why.My biggest issue with the workout is what it did to my body.  Mind you, I only used this once a week, for 3 weeks, when I noticed a difference in my body.  I am a high intermediate exerciser, and am happy with my body the way it is and pretty much work out for maintenance.  Within just a few performances of this workout, I noticed that I started to get RIPPED.  My abs, though already toned with nice lines, began to actually develop, if not yet a 6-pack, then definitely a 4-pak!  :-)  My thighs became thicker, albeit with muscle, and my calves started to get a muscular ripple in them (all those darn releves!!).  All of this would have made me astoundingly ecstatic...IF I desired those changes!  However, I loved the challenge, but did NOT want to develop my muscle tone beyond where it currently is.  I have nothing against very, very developed feminine muscle, but it's just not for me.  It's not a look I'm personally interested in. I was actually surprised at these results, because there is so much beautiful stretching in between the exercises.So...for this reason alone, I have already, regrettably, retired the Ballet Physique DVDs.  But I AM going to keep them!  You never know when I may need an aggressive but gentle toning workout to jump-start a lazy physique (like post-pregnancy!!)  :-)I highly recommend this workout; it does what it claims and is fun and challenging...but unfortunately, it's just not for me.",4,"Undoubtedly The TOUGHEST, Most SERIOUS Sculpting Workout I've Done!!",1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2664,"['Ballet', 'Physique', 'Workout', 'NOT', 'fool', 'around', 'want', 'get', 'muscle', 'definition', 'WILL', 'get', 'collection', 'two', 'killer', 'ballet', 'barre-style', 'workouts', '60-minute', 'Signature', 'Sculpt', '45-minute', 'Amped', 'Up', 'billed', 'shorter', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'use', 'barre', 'need', 'buy', 'one', 'chair', 'high', 'enough', 'perfect', 'subsitute', 'light', 'weights', 'inflatable', 'medicine', 'ball', 'DVD', 'good', 'old', 'gravity', 'moves', 'ballet/dance', 'based', 'lot', 'plies', 'leg', 'lifts', 'forward', 'back', 'hip', 'rolls', 'tucks', 'pulsing', 'bent', 'legs', 'get', 'idea', 'video', 'check', 'out', 'pricier', 'DVD', 'program', 'actually', 'get', 'plenty', 'buck', '2', 'well-produced', 'incredibly', 'challenging', 'effective', 'workouts', 'inflatable', 'medicine', 'ball', 'referred', 'here', 'playground', 'ball', 'wanted', 'try', 'style', 'workout', 'so', 'enjoy', 'pilates', 'dance-based', 'sculpting', 'workouts', 'example', 'LOVE', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'sculpting', 'workouts', 'Exhale', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'workouts', 'like', 'using', 'chair', 'own', 'body', 'weight', 'sculpt', 'long', 'lean', 'look', 'Soo', 'was', 'first', 'barre-style', 'workout', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'last', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'why.My', 'biggest', 'issue', 'workout', 'what', 'did', 'body', 'Mind', 'only', 'used', 'once', 'week', '3', 'weeks', 'when', 'noticed', 'difference', 'body', 'am', 'high', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'am', 'happy', 'body', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'work', 'out', 'maintenance', 'Within', 'just', 'few', 'performances', 'workout', 'noticed', 'started', 'get', 'RIPPED', 'My', 'abs', 'already', 'toned', 'nice', 'lines', 'began', 'actually', 'develop', 'not', 'yet', '6-pack', 'then', 'definitely', '4-pak', 'thighs', 'became', 'thicker', 'muscle', 'calves', 'started', 'get', 'muscular', 'ripple', 'darn', 'releves', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'astoundingly', 'ecstatic', 'IF', 'desired', 'changes', 'However', 'loved', 'challenge', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'develop', 'muscle', 'tone', 'where', 'currently', 'have', 'nothing', 'very', 'very', 'developed', 'feminine', 'muscle', 'just', 'not', 'not', 'look', ""'m"", 'personally', 'interested', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'results', 'so', 'much', 'beautiful', 'stretching', 'exercises.So', 'reason', 'alone', 'have', 'already', 'regrettably', 'retired', 'Ballet', 'Physique', 'DVDs', 'AM', 'going', 'keep', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'may', 'need', 'aggressive', 'gentle', 'toning', 'workout', 'jump-start', 'lazy', 'physique', 'post-pregnancy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'what', 'fun', 'challenging', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'not']",The Ballet Physique DVD Collection

These workouts are so fun to do and I feel worked afterward.  Just when you think you can't possibly do another rep, the exercise changes.  There are some exercises that really get into the muscle and I noticed a slimness to my core and legs after doing these consistently with some other cardio DVD's.

1606734,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00A81RU4U,Leanne,"[7, 8]","I bought this set based on a previous review that said that adding in these workouts helped that person shape up really quickly.  I already own all of the Physique 57 workouts, the Pop Physique set, and Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre workouts, but I feel like this is a nice set, and I'm really happy to add it to my collection!This set comes with two DVDs and a ball, but not a pump.  I wasn't sure if I needed the ball, but it's a bit smaller than my Physique 57 ball and works perfectly for the workouts.  To do the workouts, you'll also want  a pair of lighter and heavier weights (I've been using 3's and 5's), a mat, and a ballet barre or chair.The two women who lead the workouts are both excellent instructors, and they give exceptional curing in their workouts. Also, each workout has an optional form pointers section that you can watch before you do the workout.  The tips they cover are really useful.On its DVD cover, Signature Sculpt says that it's 60 minutes long, but it's really 107 minutes, and, while Amped Up purports to be 45 minutes long, it's really 52 minutes.  I don't mind the longer workout times, but just be forewarned.These are definitely tough workouts, but there is a modifier in each one and you can follow along with that person if you need to.Overall, these are really nice barre workouts, and I can tell that I'll use them a lot.UPDATE ON 4-8-14:  I haven't used these for awhile because I noticed that when I was just using them, I gained some girth in my thigh measurements.  I had the same problem when I was just doing the Physique 57 workouts (and no other workouts).  I'm an hourglass, so I think it's because of my body type. I still think that these are great workouts, but would be careful if you're an hourglass and if you tend to put on weight in your lower  half easily.",5,Two fun workouts with exceptional cueing,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1816,"['bought', 'set', 'based', 'previous', 'review', 'said', 'adding', 'workouts', 'helped', 'person', 'shape', 'up', 'really', 'quickly', 'already', 'own', 'Physique', '57', 'workouts', 'Pop', 'Physique', 'set', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'workouts', 'feel', 'nice', 'set', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'add', 'collection', 'set', 'two', 'DVDs', 'ball', 'not', 'pump', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'needed', 'ball', 'bit', 'smaller', 'Physique', '57', 'ball', 'perfectly', 'workouts', 'do', 'workouts', ""'ll"", 'also', 'want', 'pair', 'lighter', 'heavier', 'weights', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', '3', '5', 'mat', 'ballet', 'barre', 'chair.The', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'lead', 'workouts', 'are', 'excellent', 'instructors', 'give', 'exceptional', 'curing', 'workouts', 'Also', 'workout', 'optional', 'form', 'pointers', 'section', 'can', 'watch', 'do', 'workout', 'tips', 'cover', 'are', 'really', 'useful.On', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Signature', 'Sculpt', '60', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', '107', 'minutes', 'Amped', 'Up', 'be', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', '52', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'longer', 'workout', 'times', 'just', 'be', 'forewarned.These', 'are', 'definitely', 'tough', 'workouts', 'modifier', 'one', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'person', 'need', 'to.Overall', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'barre', 'workouts', 'can', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'use', 'lot.UPDATE', 'ON', '4-8-14', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', 'awhile', 'noticed', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'gained', 'girth', 'thigh', 'measurements', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'Physique', '57', 'workouts', 'other', 'workouts', ""'m"", 'hourglass', 'think', 'body', 'type', 'still', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'workouts', 'would', 'be', 'careful', ""'re"", 'hourglass', 'tend', 'put', 'weight', 'lower', 'half', 'easily']",The Ballet Physique DVD Collection
1606735,A34NB82XZ0PE4E,B00A81RU4U,slh,"[9, 13]","I have many barre DVDs, but these two workouts impressed me right away and have become favorites.  The instructors are very competent and provide good form tips.  However, there is a separate section if you need more indepth instruction.  Kristen Zurek leads Signature Sculpt, which is a 60-minute workout.  Amped Up is led by Kristin Skordahl, and even though it is shorter in length at 45 minutes, I would rate this as the more intense of the two DVDs.  However, both are tough, advanced barre workouts.  Each instructor is joined by three background exercisers, and one person shows modifications.  The production quality is quite good; nice, airy studio with wooden floors, exposed brick walls and windows in the back.  The music is generic but high energy.  Cueling is done live, not voiceover.  The pacing is perfect - not too fast or slow.  Even if you have an extensive barre collection, you will find many unique movements.  I received a very sturdy ball with my two DVDs although I was not able to blow it up because I did not have a pump.  Instead, I used a small, squishy mini-Fitball that I already had on hand and that seemed to work very well.",5,Wow!,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1158,"['have', 'many', 'barre', 'DVDs', 'two', 'workouts', 'impressed', 'right', 'away', 'have', 'become', 'favorites', 'instructors', 'are', 'very', 'competent', 'provide', 'good', 'form', 'tips', 'However', 'separate', 'section', 'need', 'more', 'indepth', 'instruction', 'Kristen', 'Zurek', 'Signature', 'Sculpt', '60-minute', 'workout', 'Amped', 'Up', 'led', 'Kristin', 'Skordahl', 'even', 'shorter', 'length', '45', 'minutes', 'would', 'rate', 'more', 'intense', 'two', 'DVDs', 'However', 'are', 'tough', 'advanced', 'barre', 'workouts', 'instructor', 'joined', 'three', 'background', 'exercisers', 'one', 'person', 'modifications', 'production', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'nice', 'airy', 'studio', 'wooden', 'floors', 'exposed', 'brick', 'walls', 'windows', 'back', 'music', 'generic', 'high', 'energy', 'Cueling', 'done', 'live', 'not', 'voiceover', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'slow', 'Even', 'have', 'extensive', 'barre', 'collection', 'will', 'find', 'many', 'unique', 'movements', 'received', 'very', 'sturdy', 'ball', 'two', 'DVDs', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'blow', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pump', 'Instead', 'used', 'small', 'squishy', 'mini-Fitball', 'already', 'had', 'hand', 'seemed', 'work', 'very', 'well']",The Ballet Physique DVD Collection
