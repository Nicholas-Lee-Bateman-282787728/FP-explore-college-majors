995059,A1Q0ESWUCFKQFV,B000FS9NXM,Daniel J.,"[0, 0]","If this movie demonstrates anything, it is that material currently coming out of Hollywood is simply a trainwreck. In contrast, &#34;Farewell to the King&#34; is OUTSTANDING, and one of the finest movies I've seen in over 50yrs. of television. The music, scenery, casting, and acting are far above average. I stumbled upon it by accident, while channel-surfing with my TV, but the Westland &#34;Lysander&#34; caught my eye quickly, being a fan of W.W.II aircraft. The interesting variety of weaponry would fascinate most gun owners, and adds realism. I had previously only seen Nick Nolte paired with Eddie Murphy in &#34;48 Hours&#34; & &#34;Another 48hrs.,&#34; and though he was very good in both of those, he does a superior job in this one. The only drawback is that his wife is a casualty of the plot, but overall, this is an inspiring story. Stories not based on fact must have a special quality to be worthwhile, and this type of fiction actually comes close enough to reality to be believable, in an escapist sort of way.

It is not only a compelling tale from a historical point of view, it has heart. I think this is one of John Milius' sometimes overlooked strong points. He'll hook you with the manly-man action and then punch you in the gut when you least expect it with honesty and heart.(Spoiler?) At one point in the film, Nolte has to save the &#34;stiff-assed Brit&#34; from the Japanese soldiers, (and without giving anything up to whosoever is reading this), one can plainly see why he IS king.

A journey through a man deepest experiences during the horror that was war, Some criticize that it could have been &#34;enhanced&#34; digitally or audibly but I found no problem with its experience. It's deep on many levels and thoughtful, and you'll find yourself viewing it differently the next time you get the urge. It's one of those kind of films. &#34;...Farwell to the king...I think he lives out there somewhere...&#34; Two thumbs up as a must have.
