1013061,A37S7O2K1I4450,B000HD1MV6,blueyed.dancer,"[1, 1]","I purchased this video so I could inject some spanish flavor into my dance practice. The video will teach you two dances; Gypsy Tango and Farruca. The Gypsy Tango is a fun, folky kind of dance, with feminine hand movements. The Farruca is quite opposite, being a bold toreador style masculine dance that will definitely appeal to those who like drama. (The latter is definitely the more challenging dance!) Puela gives thorough, clear instructions on how to perform the sequence of steps and the camera stays focused in one place (I hate jumping/zooming cameras on exercise or dance vids!!) so you can see her whole body and therefore how she is moving her limbs, so this is perfect for beginners. She has a pleasant personality and a beautiful spanish accent as well as being an accomplished dancer. I especially enjoyed watching her perform the Farruca which she executed wonderfully.Bottom line: Its a fun video for those of us new to flamenco at a price you can't beat. The name ""makeover"" in the title might lead some to believe this is a workout video but I found it to be more instructional than a workout video, although you will get exercise by doing the routines of course.Ole!",5,Flamenco for beginners,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,1187,"['purchased', 'video', 'could', 'inject', 'spanish', 'flavor', 'dance', 'practice', 'video', 'will', 'teach', 'two', 'dances', 'Gypsy', 'Tango', 'Farruca', 'Gypsy', 'Tango', 'fun', 'folky', 'kind', 'dance', 'feminine', 'hand', 'movements', 'Farruca', 'quite', 'opposite', 'being', 'bold', 'toreador', 'style', 'masculine', 'dance', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'who', 'like', 'drama', 'latter', 'definitely', 'more', 'challenging', 'dance', 'Puela', 'thorough', 'clear', 'instructions', 'how', 'perform', 'sequence', 'steps', 'camera', 'focused', 'one', 'place', 'hate', 'jumping/zooming', 'cameras', 'exercise', 'dance', 'vids', 'can', 'see', 'whole', 'body', 'therefore', 'how', 'moving', 'limbs', 'perfect', 'beginners', 'pleasant', 'personality', 'beautiful', 'spanish', 'accent', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'accomplished', 'dancer', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'perform', 'Farruca', 'executed', 'wonderfully.Bottom', 'line', 'fun', 'video', 'new', 'flamenco', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'name', 'makeover', 'title', 'might', 'lead', 'believe', 'workout', 'video', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'instructional', 'workout', 'video', 'will', 'get', 'exercise', 'doing', 'routines', 'course.Ole']","Dance Today!

1013062,A29UATAQB4AV3Q,B000HD1MV6,"desertdancer ""desertdancer""","[59, 60]","I've been looking for a DVD like this one for years! I've been dancing Middle Eastern for years, but have always been fascinated by gypsy and flamenco dance. I've bought several videos, some of them better than others, but with one exception (and that DVD only offered a few steps), they don't break down the posture, hand movements, upper body/lower body steps, etc.Lunaris' DVD is completely the opposite! Lunaris breaks down both dances into combinations, which she then carefully breaks down still further, beginning with the absolute basic -- how to get your skirt up to your hand. From there, she explains posture and attitude, separates and explains upper and lower body steps and hand movements, and then demonstrates how to put it all together.On top of this, Lunaris is lovely, and her demeanor and accent are delightful. She provides additional personal commentary on a few steps, too -- for instance, she describes how, in Spain, children learn one hand movement as ""picking an apple, eating the apple, throwing the apple away."" The DVD is so detailed and careful, I'd happily pay this much for a video that provided just *one* of these dances!I also *love* the way Lunaris explains dance as a language. She teaches the steps as ""vocabulary,"" then suggests that once you know the vocabulary, you can improvise to music.My only complaint with this video -- and it's slight enough, I still wish I could give this DVD a dozen stars! -- is that she faces the viewer and uses terms like ""this leg"" instead of ""right leg.""Nevertheless, this DVD is an absolute must-buy if you've ever been intrigued by Spanish dance, whether gypsy or flamenco. It's a fantastic addition for Middle Eastern dancers who would like to add a little flair to their dance. When I'm finished with this review, I'm going to buy both of Lunaris' other videos!",5,Deserves far more than 5 stars!!,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1839,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'DVD', 'one', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dancing', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'years', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'gypsy', 'flamenco', 'dance', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'several', 'videos', 'better', 'others', 'one', 'exception', 'DVD', 'only', 'offered', 'few', 'steps', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'posture', 'hand', 'movements', 'upper', 'body/lower', 'body', 'steps', 'etc.Lunaris', 'DVD', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Lunaris', 'down', 'dances', 'combinations', 'then', 'carefully', 'breaks', 'down', 'still', 'further', 'beginning', 'absolute', 'basic', 'how', 'get', 'skirt', 'up', 'hand', 'there', 'posture', 'attitude', 'separates', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'steps', 'hand', 'movements', 'then', 'how', 'put', 'together.On', 'top', 'Lunaris', 'lovely', 'demeanor', 'accent', 'are', 'delightful', 'additional', 'personal', 'commentary', 'few', 'steps', 'too', 'instance', 'how', 'Spain', 'children', 'learn', 'one', 'hand', 'movement', 'picking', 'apple', 'eating', 'apple', 'throwing', 'apple', 'away', 'DVD', 'so', 'detailed', 'careful', ""'d"", 'happily', 'pay', 'much', 'video', 'provided', 'just', '*one*', 'dances', 'also', '*love*', 'way', 'Lunaris', 'dance', 'language', 'steps', 'vocabulary', 'then', 'once', 'know', 'vocabulary', 'can', 'improvise', 'music.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'video', 'slight', 'enough', 'still', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'DVD', 'dozen', 'stars', 'viewer', 'terms', 'leg', 'instead', 'right', 'leg', 'Nevertheless', 'DVD', 'absolute', 'must-buy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'intrigued', 'Spanish', 'dance', 'gypsy', 'flamenco', 'fantastic', 'addition', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'dancers', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'little', 'flair', 'dance', 'When', ""'m"", 'finished', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'Lunaris', 'other', 'videos']","Dance Today!

This is my first Flamenco DVD so who knows if it gets any better. Some moves I wish she would go over a few more times as I am not a dancer. That I mean by this is some of the turns I wish she would go over the footwork so that my timing is better.

I was very excited to purchase this DVD after reading all the reviews.  No doubt she is knowledgeable and a fantastic performer however I dont rate this as a good DVD to learn Flamenco if you are a beginner.  Here's my feedback.....a) a small annoyance is she is very fair skinned and teaching on a bright white background and perhaps it was my screen but this really hurt the eyes to concentrate on basically white on white.b) I love her routines but i just dont understand who devised the way of putting this instructional DVD together.  The menu says learn the step or learn the steps with music. She is covering way too much content or detail in one hit - there is no revision of the step unless you keep rewinding the dvd.c) in this day and age everyone she be offering a front and back view on their teaching dvd - if not teach infront of a mirror so that students can still choose their view. With so much footwork and intricate turns etc it gets very confusing as a beginner especially since she dosent really review the steps at tempo repeatedly.d) that would be my biggest criticism.... teach the steps, then review them slowly, then at tempo several times each to give people a chance to drill and get it in their head.  It feels like she just wants to teach the routine.  Then if you are teaching in sections teach, review, drill, at tempo WITH THE MUSIC, repeat.iI have done this DVD once and thrown it on the desk to collect dust it was super frustrating and i cannot see how a beginner who wants to learn this style would not feel even worse.Fire the director I say.  She is super talented and the choreography is beautiful - the format this is taught will see it staying on my bookshelf until i feel like punishing myself again.  I bought her other Flamenco DVD and Im not even motivated to open it if this is anything to show.
