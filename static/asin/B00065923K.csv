I've watched it twice now, and in my opinion this is one of the finest music DVD's to be released in years.It goes without saying that there is more musical talent in a Q-tip full of Nora Jones' earwax than in any three of the current crop of silly, belly-baring ""stars"" that have been manufactured for our consumption, and this DVD highlights her talent perfectly.The fantastic group of musicians that she so graciously introduces to us, (both in her band and appearing as special guests,) only add to the experience.  This is stage playing at its very best, and everyone involved seems to be inspired to deliver their all, simply because they are playing with Nora.Finally, the arrangements, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction are all at or near top-notch.  I simply can't think of any complaints; even blurring is used artistically during some of the shot changes, and along with wide-angles and closeups, we get a cornucopia of ""musicians"" shots of fingers and hands at work on strings and keys.If you like Nora Jones even a little bit, buy this DVD and after watching it, you'll like her a lot more.And finally, to those reviewers who seem to feel compelled to comment on her appearance:  In my book, she sounds and plays so well that it wouldn't make any difference if she looked like W.C. Fields.  That she is beautiful is just a minor and almost irrelevant fringe benefit to being able to watch her genius in action.",5,Absolutely beautiful DVD,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1529,"['connoisseur', 'music', 'DVD', 'am', 'puzzled', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'remarks', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'now', 'opinion', 'one', 'finest', 'music', 'DVD', 'be', 'released', 'years.It', 'saying', 'more', 'musical', 'talent', 'Q-tip', 'full', 'Nora', 'Jones', 'earwax', 'three', 'current', 'crop', 'silly', 'belly-baring', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'manufactured', 'consumption', 'DVD', 'talent', 'perfectly.The', 'fantastic', 'group', 'musicians', 'so', 'graciously', 'introduces', 'band', 'appearing', 'special', 'guests', 'only', 'add', 'experience', 'stage', 'playing', 'very', 'best', 'everyone', 'involved', 'be', 'inspired', 'deliver', 'simply', 'are', 'playing', 'Nora.Finally', 'arrangements', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'direction', 'are', 'top-notch', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'complaints', 'even', 'blurring', 'used', 'artistically', 'shot', 'changes', 'wide-angles', 'closeups', 'get', 'cornucopia', 'musicians', 'shots', 'fingers', 'hands', 'work', 'strings', 'keys.If', 'Nora', 'Jones', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'like', 'lot', 'more.And', 'finally', 'reviewers', 'who', 'seem', 'feel', 'compelled', 'comment', 'appearance', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'looked', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'beautiful', 'just', 'minor', 'almost', 'irrelevant', 'fringe', 'benefit', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'genius', 'action']",N/A

Lizzi,"[4, 4]","Compared to the Norah's ""Live in New Orleans"" DVD from 2002, this ""Live in 2004"" performance shows the artist as a more personable, comfortable and musically diverse musician.  Personally, I didn't prefer this lineup of songs as much as the tunes from the New Orleans concert, but that's a credit to the awesome, hit laden ""Come Away With Me"" album.  Overall, this is a solid, easy to watch, concert DVD that should be enjoyable to anyone, especially Norah fans.Here's more detail:1) Performance.  Nothing earth shattering in the way of grandiose stage settings, over-the-top lighting, mind-blowing solos or even surprise renditions of songs.  Rather, it's just straight Norah:  smooth, easy to listen to, and ever grateful to play on a famous stage (Nashville's Ryman Auditorium) with gifted artists.  The Handsome Band is characteristically tight, as always, and there is a decent showcase for their improvisation and soloing.  The newest addition, Robbie McIntosh, adds some nice acoustic and resonator guitar work.  There are five special guests:  Dolly Parton, Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, Richard Julian and Kevin Breit.  Each of them adds a special energy to the performance, but I can't help but feel that there is a musical diversion away from the Norah that I found so special in the New Orleans show, i.e., I'm not sure a more diverse Norah is as musically fulfilling.  The concert footage is interspersed with video clips that look like practice sessions for sound checks.  They're interesting.2) Sound.  Well done; no one overpowers anyone else, and the mix of instrumentation makes perfect sense for this type of music.3) Videography.  This is the subject that I'm most picky about, and I'm happy to say that there were no glaring disappointments, which means that the edits weren't too quick and the camera selection had me looking pretty much at who I wanted to see almost all the time.  Also, there were very few instances where prowling cameramen were in view in the background.4) Extras.  Much better than the last DVD.  This one has added concert footage (including a song from the New Orleans concert filmed for the prior DVD), outtake tracks and videos, mini-documentaries (interviews with band members), and a ""guitar tour"" hosted by the two guitarists, Adam Levy and McIntosh.",4,Solid performance; enjoyable DVD overall,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,2302,"['Compared', 'Norah', 'Live', 'New', 'Orleans', 'DVD', '2002', 'Live', '2004', 'performance', 'artist', 'more', 'personable', 'comfortable', 'musically', 'diverse', 'musician', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'lineup', 'songs', 'as', 'much', 'tunes', 'New', 'Orleans', 'concert', 'credit', 'awesome', 'hit', 'laden', 'Come', 'Away', 'Me', 'album', 'Overall', 'solid', 'easy', 'watch', 'concert', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'especially', 'Norah', 'more', 'detail:1', 'Performance', 'Nothing', 'earth', 'shattering', 'way', 'grandiose', 'stage', 'settings', 'over-the-top', 'lighting', 'mind-blowing', 'solos', 'even', 'surprise', 'renditions', 'songs', 'Rather', 'just', 'straight', 'Norah', 'smooth', 'easy', 'listen', 'ever', 'grateful', 'play', 'famous', 'stage', 'Nashville', 'Ryman', 'Auditorium', 'gifted', 'artists', 'Handsome', 'Band', 'characteristically', 'tight', 'always', 'decent', 'showcase', 'improvisation', 'soloing', 'newest', 'addition', 'Robbie', 'McIntosh', 'nice', 'acoustic', 'resonator', 'guitar', 'work', 'are', 'five', 'special', 'guests', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Gillian', 'Welch', 'David', 'Rawlings', 'Richard', 'Julian', 'Kevin', 'Breit', 'special', 'energy', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'musical', 'diversion', 'away', 'Norah', 'found', 'so', 'special', 'New', 'Orleans', 'show', 'i.e.', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'more', 'diverse', 'Norah', 'musically', 'fulfilling', 'concert', 'footage', 'interspersed', 'video', 'clips', 'look', 'practice', 'sessions', 'sound', 'checks', ""'re"", 'interesting.2', 'Sound', 'Well', 'done', 'one', 'anyone', 'else', 'mix', 'instrumentation', 'perfect', 'sense', 'type', 'music.3', 'Videography', 'subject', ""'m"", 'most', 'picky', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'were', 'glaring', 'disappointments', 'edits', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'quick', 'camera', 'selection', 'had', 'looking', 'pretty', 'much', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'almost', 'time', 'Also', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'prowling', 'cameramen', 'were', 'view', 'background.4', 'Extras', 'Much', 'better', 'last', 'DVD', 'one', 'added', 'concert', 'footage', 'including', 'song', 'New', 'Orleans', 'concert', 'filmed', 'prior', 'DVD', 'outtake', 'tracks', 'videos', 'mini-documentaries', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'guitar', 'tour', 'hosted', 'two', 'guitarists', 'Adam', 'Levy', 'McIntosh']",N/A

Never having seen Norah live, I was most impressed by her gracious and giving nature onstage.  She gives credit to her accompanying musicians and uses many songs that they have written.  Particularly impressive is the drummer Andrew Borger whose broad smile and enthusiasm for Norah and her music brighten the stage.  Borger had worked with Chuck Prophet and Tom Waits, which may explain why Norah does a Waits' song co-written with Kathleen Brennan called ""The Long Way Home.""  He also composed ""Above Ground"" from the ""Feels Like Home"" CD that appears in this set.  Robbie McIntosh was a favorite of mine from his 3 Compass CDs including one of my favorite tunes ""Emotional Bends,"" which was a title track of one release.  McIntosh has toured with Paul McCartney & the Pretenders; so his addition to Norah's band is exquisite.  ""Moon Song"" that was not included on the ""Feels Like Home"" CD is a beautiful tune; so it is a joy to hear here.  I thought that I & 70 people from New York City (including Art Garfunkel) were probably the only Richard Julian fans on the planet.  One of his tunes, ""Siberia,"" went to #1 on my personal top ten last year.  His joining Norah on a John Prine song ""That's the Way the World Goes Round"" is an utter treat here about a guy who beats his wife with a rubber hose & then takes her out to buy new clothes.  With Prine's wry sense of humor & Norah's delightful mischievous side that shines through, this is a great track.  Kevin Breit who wears a funky fedora onstage has left the band and released his own CD that depending on the listing sometimes appears as ""John & the Sisters"" or ""Kevin Breit & the Sisters,"" wrote ""Humble Me"" that Norah performs beautifully.  Norah is wonderfully gracious to the sparkling Dolly Parton who guests on Borger's ""Creepin' In.""  At 60, Dolly's got incredible energy & style and seems to have a genuine chemistry with Norah, despite a great difference in their stage manner.  Norah is equally as giving to guests Gillian Welsh & David Rawlings who guest on Townes Van Zandt's ""Loretta.""  Whether on the ""Oh Brother"" DVD that was also filmed at Nashville's Ryman or on this set, I always get a kick out of David Rawlings' stage enthusiasm.  Daru Oda is a delight singing backup.  I also greatly enjoyed Norah's version of The Band's ""Life Is A Carnival.""  This is an excellent concert DVD!

Her Country is great.She of course has an intimate and authentic sense of phrasing along with her distinctive smokey voice, and can sing anything.She mixes in ballads with country and jazz, but half of her output is her at the piano with minimalist back up on this DVD.She also is at her best in duets.  Such as with Willie Nelson, Gillian Welch, Tony Bennett etc.Anything that spices up her usual sound.  After all she has perfected it and she should move on.Her latest cd has done this to an extent I should add by adding electronica and a different style of mix with more upbeat material.Few singers will ever have the substance and gravitas of many of the old torch singers, like Peggy Lee, Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. But of contemporary ones some think Madeleine Peyroux surpasses Norah in her selections and varied approaches with combinations of few instruments, though nowhere near as popular.And though she sounds like Billy Holiday, it is more of an influence than a repetitive, similar style.Cat Edmundson I think is great too but she is more of a retro singer than Peyroux or Nora.All are great.",4,Great singer with too much sameness here,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1365,"['Norah', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'massively', 'popular', 'not', 'commercialized', 'quality', 'music.And', 'more', 'jazz', 'pop', 'singer', 'mostly', 'what', 'gone', 'be', 'as', 'varied', 'singer', 'too', 'Country', 'great.She', 'course', 'intimate', 'authentic', 'sense', 'phrasing', 'along', 'distinctive', 'smokey', 'voice', 'can', 'sing', 'anything.She', 'mixes', 'ballads', 'country', 'jazz', 'half', 'output', 'piano', 'minimalist', 'back', 'up', 'DVD.She', 'also', 'best', 'duets', 'Such', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Gillian', 'Welch', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'etc.Anything', 'up', 'usual', 'sound', 'perfected', 'should', 'move', 'on.Her', 'latest', 'cd', 'done', 'extent', 'should', 'add', 'adding', 'electronica', 'different', 'style', 'mix', 'more', 'upbeat', 'material.Few', 'singers', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'substance', 'gravitas', 'many', 'old', 'torch', 'singers', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'Dinah', 'Washington', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'contemporary', 'ones', 'think', 'Madeleine', 'Peyroux', 'Norah', 'selections', 'varied', 'approaches', 'combinations', 'few', 'instruments', 'nowhere', 'popular.And', 'Billy', 'Holiday', 'more', 'influence', 'repetitive', 'similar', 'style.Cat', 'Edmundson', 'think', 'great', 'too', 'more', 'retro', 'singer', 'Peyroux', 'Nora.All', 'are', 'great']",N/A

The original wasn't DTS...but this one should have been (as should every Music/Concert DVD).  The vocals are too hot in relation to the rest of the mix.  While Norah sounds great (and looks so much better - style, makeup, poise) the mix is just a bit too forward with her vocals.  The recording of the instruments is nearly on par with New Orleans with the stand-up bass being more articulate and controlled than before.  Keep in mind most people who complain about boomy or exaggerated bass on a music DVD are just ignorant of the fact that their system is poorly tuned to their room.  Subwoofer/Bass tuning is very tricky without the right tools and knowledge.  When you get it right, discs that sounded bad before will sound great and you won't find yourself adjusting bass levels disc to disc as much as before.  In addition, no one should ever complain about the surrounds being just used for room ambience and crowd noise.  That is all it should ever be used for on a concert DVD...unless the live event actually had musicians behind the audience (highly unlikely).  Playing cute games with surround mixes is as pass&eacute; as fast-paced video work that leaves you dizzy from never being able to focus on a single scene for more than 2 seconds.  These two things are the mark of amateurs without good taste and they always destroy an otherwise great concert DVD.The video isn't reference quality, but far superior to New Orleans with lighting.  Overall the video was not distracting, but neither was it overly impressive.  Could have been better with today's technology.Finally, although she seems nervous Norah is not profusely sweating in the previous New Orleans DVD.  She has glitter on her face.  The poor/harsh lighting and extreme close-ups in that DVD make it look like she is sweating, but it is just the glitter and her complexion that you are seeing. Take another look.Overall the second DVD is decent.  For the third, the production staff should aspire to even higher technical quality in both video and audio by building on the good aspects of this second effort.",4,The Good and The Bad and The Correct,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,2206,"['First', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'audio', 'mix', 'not', 'being', 'quite', 'as', 'splendid', 'previous', 'New', 'Orleans', 'release', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'DTS', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'Music/Concert', 'DVD', 'vocals', 'are', 'too', 'hot', 'relation', 'rest', 'mix', 'Norah', 'great', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'style', 'makeup', 'poise', 'mix', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'forward', 'vocals', 'recording', 'instruments', 'nearly', 'par', 'New', 'Orleans', 'stand-up', 'bass', 'being', 'more', 'articulate', 'controlled', 'before', 'Keep', 'mind', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'boomy', 'exaggerated', 'bass', 'music', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'system', 'poorly', 'tuned', 'room', 'Subwoofer/Bass', 'tuning', 'very', 'tricky', 'right', 'tools', 'knowledge', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'sounded', 'bad', 'before', 'will', 'sound', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'adjusting', 'bass', 'levels', 'disc', 'disc', 'as', 'much', 'before', 'addition', 'one', 'should', 'ever', 'complain', 'surrounds', 'being', 'just', 'used', 'room', 'ambience', 'crowd', 'noise', 'should', 'ever', 'be', 'used', 'concert', 'DVD', 'live', 'event', 'actually', 'had', 'musicians', 'audience', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'Playing', 'cute', 'games', 'surround', 'mixes', 'pass', 'eacute', 'fast-paced', 'video', 'work', 'dizzy', 'never', 'being', 'able', 'focus', 'single', 'scene', 'more', '2', 'seconds', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'mark', 'amateurs', 'good', 'taste', 'always', 'destroy', 'otherwise', 'great', 'concert', 'DVD.The', 'video', ""n't"", 'reference', 'quality', 'far', 'superior', 'New', 'Orleans', 'lighting', 'video', 'was', 'not', 'distracting', 'was', 'overly', 'impressive', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'today', 'technology.Finally', 'nervous', 'Norah', 'not', 'profusely', 'sweating', 'previous', 'New', 'Orleans', 'DVD', 'glitter', 'face', 'poor/harsh', 'lighting', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'DVD', 'make', 'look', 'sweating', 'just', 'glitter', 'complexion', 'are', 'seeing', 'Take', 'look.Overall', 'second', 'DVD', 'decent', 'third', 'production', 'staff', 'should', 'aspire', 'even', 'higher', 'technical', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'building', 'good', 'aspects', 'second', 'effort']",N/A
