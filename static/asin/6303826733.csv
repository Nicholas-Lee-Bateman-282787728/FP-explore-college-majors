I was a member (proudly) of The Gumby Fan Club back in the mid 80's when Gumby was on Channel 5 and 9.  He disapeared for a long time.  I was in college when I saw that &quot;Gumby:The Movie&quot; was playing, and was sorry that I couldn't see it on the big screen.I didn't rent it- I bought it ASAP!  Great for kids, and die hard fans, but too long and it doesn't know when to quit. Still it's hard not to love Gumby.Magical, as Gumby enters the story books and meets adventure at everyturn.  You'll see scenes re-created by Gumby and Pokey from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Terminator&quot;.  Why this didn't come out in the 80's when Gumby was riding high, is a mystery.  Still, I'm glad Gumby finally made it to the big screen.

386145,A2NI58B62O48WZ,6303826733,James Fieser,"[3, 4]","This is a clever Gumby movie, created in the mid 1990s, with lots of interesting characters. It has somewhat of a low budget feel to it, and not as sophisticated as the claymation of Nick Parks's Wallace & Gromit or Chicken Run. The music soundtrack is largely a one-man synthesizer, with the exception of the rock songs played by Gumby and the Clayboys, which are slick. The audio mixing is a little annoying since the sound engineer pumped the character voices through a cheesy digital effect, thus making the characters sound like they're talking into a tin can. Nevertheless, the movie plot holds up well and, most importantly, my kids love it and use the story line as a springboard for imaginary play. My copy of the video had a small Gumby action figure included under the shrink wrap.",5,Great Gumby vehicle that your kids will love,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,792,"['clever', 'Gumby', 'movie', 'created', 'mid', '1990s', 'lots', 'interesting', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'not', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'claymation', 'Nick', 'Parks', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'largely', 'one-man', 'synthesizer', 'exception', 'rock', 'songs', 'played', 'Gumby', 'Clayboys', 'are', 'slick', 'audio', 'mixing', 'little', 'annoying', 'sound', 'engineer', 'pumped', 'character', 'voices', 'cheesy', 'digital', 'effect', 'thus', 'making', 'characters', 'sound', ""'re"", 'talking', 'tin', 'can', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'plot', 'up', 'well', 'most', 'importantly', 'kids', 'love', 'use', 'story', 'line', 'springboard', 'imaginary', 'play', 'copy', 'video', 'had', 'small', 'Gumby', 'action', 'figure', 'included', 'shrink', 'wrap']",Gumby VHS

I was unsure about what the director's cut would do to this movie and, despite not seeing it for a while, I knew what was going to be in it.For the most part, the Director's Cut was a an improvement over the original. Art Clokey and the editor that helped him knew what to cut and how to do it without calling attention to itself. There were a few cuts that felt abrupt and, knowing what was supposed to come next made it obvious for me what was cut. Also, a few continuity bloopers came about due to the cutting. However, these new bloopers are not more noticable than the bloopers that were present. Most importantly, this new cut gets rid of scenes that, quite frankely, just bogged the film down and were never needed. This film works without the cut scenes and is more enjoyable than the first cut, which I enjoyed very much as well. My only big complaint was that it cut out No Buckle's (the yellow Clayboy with white hair) first big scene and he doesn't get a line until the middle of the film. For the most part, however, this film rocked (and to be fair, most fans of Gumby are tuning in for Gumby, Goo, Pokey, and Prickle, not the new characters).If you're reading this and sweating that you're favorite scenes were cut, never fear, because they are all included in a deleted scenes section. Between the movie and the deleted scenes section, the first cut is included on the DVD. There's an added treat, as a scene that was never a scene in the movie is included (it's a scene with Minga and Gumba, right before Gumby is seen cleaning the fire truck).The greatest special feature are the four Gumby episodes. It includes one from the 50s and three 80s ones. They're were all enjoyable, and two of the 80s ones included Denali the mastadon and Tilly the Chicken. Very good episodes.If you're a Gumby fan, you'll want this DVD. I absolutly love this movie and this DVD is a great tribute to Gumby. Buy it.I almost forgot...it includes a little Gumby toy. How much better can it get?

386154,AJJ6LTT2NCRS6,6303826733,Steven T. Siegert,"[0, 0]","I remember this movie when it came out. I originally owned this movie on VHS. I was in elementary school at the time and loved Gumby, so I had my parents buy it the moment I found it. Now, even as a young child, I was more partial to the 1950's and 1960's episodes and did not care so much for the 1980's episodes. However, this movie, while a continuation from the 1980's formula, is just great in many ways I just can't describe. It is too bad that those 1980's episodes had to be made when they were. Perhaps they would've made a better impression if those episodes were made after a feature film such as this one was produced.As for the movie, Gumby has a new band, ""The Clayboys"". The mascot of the band is a dog named Lowbelly, not to be confused with Gumby's original dog Nopey, who only says ""no"". While giving a concert in the park, the Blockheads discover that Lowbelly cries pearls when Gumby and his band performs. So, the troublesome duo plot to kidnap Lowbelly, Gumby and the Clayboys and try to get rich quick off of pearl sales. Of course, Gumby prevails with help from his friends Pokey, Prickle, Goo and a new friend (romantic interest) named Tara.The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is because it is not exactly as I remember seeing it. This is supposedly the Director's Cut. If that is really the case, then why wasn't this version the one originally released. I do agree that some of the scenes cut were not significant, but some of the cuts do take away plot elements that will only leave the viewer asking questions if they had not seen the version originally released on VHS.As for the special features, all the deleted scenes from the original are present, plus one scene that never made it to the original. There are also 4 episodes from the TV series, being ""Tree Trouble"" from the 1950's, in which Gumby and Pokey go searching for buried treasure, but instead learn a lesson through a fable told by a wise old owl. The other three episodes are from the 1980's, being ""Melon Felons"", ""As the Worm Turns"" and ""Robot Farm"", which I honestly don't think are all that great. They certainly could've made better choices in selecting bonus episodes.",4,What the 1980's series should have been,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,2184,"['remember', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'originally', 'owned', 'movie', 'VHS', 'was', 'elementary', 'school', 'time', 'loved', 'Gumby', 'had', 'parents', 'buy', 'moment', 'found', 'Now', 'even', 'young', 'child', 'was', 'more', 'partial', '1950', '1960', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'so', 'much', '1980', 'episodes', 'However', 'movie', 'continuation', '1980', 'formula', 'just', 'great', 'many', 'ways', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'too', 'bad', '1980', 'episodes', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'when', 'were', 'Perhaps', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'better', 'impression', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'such', 'one', 'was', 'produced.As', 'movie', 'Gumby', 'new', 'band', 'Clayboys', 'mascot', 'band', 'dog', 'named', 'Lowbelly', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Gumby', 'original', 'dog', 'Nopey', 'who', 'only', 'giving', 'concert', 'park', 'Blockheads', 'discover', 'Lowbelly', 'pearls', 'when', 'Gumby', 'band', 'performs', 'So', 'troublesome', 'duo', 'plot', 'kidnap', 'Lowbelly', 'Gumby', 'Clayboys', 'try', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'pearl', 'sales', 'course', 'Gumby', 'help', 'friends', 'Pokey', 'Prickle', 'Goo', 'new', 'friend', 'romantic', 'interest', 'named', 'Tara.The', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'exactly', 'remember', 'seeing', 'supposedly', 'Director', 'Cut', 'really', 'case', 'then', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'version', 'one', 'originally', 'released', 'do', 'agree', 'scenes', 'cut', 'were', 'not', 'significant', 'cuts', 'do', 'take', 'away', 'plot', 'elements', 'will', 'only', 'leave', 'viewer', 'asking', 'questions', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'version', 'originally', 'released', 'VHS.As', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'are', 'present', 'one', 'scene', 'never', 'made', 'original', 'are', 'also', '4', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'being', 'Tree', 'Trouble', '1950', 'Gumby', 'Pokey', 'go', 'searching', 'buried', 'treasure', 'instead', 'learn', 'lesson', 'fable', 'told', 'wise', 'old', 'owl', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', '1980', 'being', 'Melon', 'Felons', 'Worm', 'Turns', 'Robot', 'Farm', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'great', 'certainly', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'better', 'choices', 'selecting', 'bonus', 'episodes']",Gumby VHS
