Since this won't be released until July, 2005, I can only give it a rating based on anticipation.  I was exuberantly pleased with the Disney Treasury that contained the first week of the original MM Club and hope the marketing gurus will release the complete series.  I'd also like to see DVDs released of the original ""Spin and Marty"" and ""The Applegate Treasure,"" as well as other serials that appeared on the original MM Club show.  These are classics and should be made available to the public!  And yes, I'd even buy the ""new"" MMC shows too (70s or 80s): as they are nostalgic and classic in their own right.

I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. ""Spin and Marty"" and ""The Hardy Boys"" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly.

That incredibly colorful, well-produced, dazzlingly choreographed and magnificently scored version of the NMMC has been hiding in the vaults for way too long.  The energetic, super-talented kids (all 12 of them!) rival ANY of their 50's counterparts for talent and personality.  Also, that was the first Mickey Mouse Club to feature Mouseketeers of color, and their cast album was the highest selling children's album of 1977.  Sure a few episodes were shown on Vault Disney in the wee hours of the morning several years ago, but there are many of us who'd love to share that great show with the children in our lives.

896315,A1N8WMNX7KV2GE,B0007Z9QXK,Judith Molly,"[53, 55]","I want to be very kind in writing this because Jimmie was kind. I don't believe that he would feel like his former employer did their very best when putting out this DVD. Let me explain why. For one thing, I was expecting the very same visual quality that we have on ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey Mouse Club"". It's not there. If you have that DVD set you probably know how crisp everything looks. Obviously, a great deal of clean up went on with those shows. In this DVD, all five shows, at least in my opinipn look dingy and dirty. Not at all clear. The sound quality is not nearly as good as The Walt Disney Treasures. Now, pertaining to the shows that they used, if you own the ten volume VHS set that Disney put out several years ago, you already own all five of these episodes. You would think that someone would use some creativity and go way back in the vaults and use some rarities that were not within the ten volume set.  It appears to me that they just grabbed what was convenient and slapped it together. I honestly don't feel like anyone who knows and loves ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" put this together. I feel as though someone who knows and loves money put it together. Disney, you proved within ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey Mouse Club"" that you can do some excellent work pertaining to putting this show on DVD. Disney, were you really trying to do your best, as you did with that set, when you put this DVD together or did you just want to make a quick buck? Disney, would Walt be proud of this? He always wanted to provide the very best for people. Disney, would Jimmie be proud of this? He was always urging us to do our very best. I really wanted to be kind when I started this review. However, sometimes, telling the truth is the kindest thing to do because maybe it will persuade Disney to do their very best the next time. I hope that there is a next time with everything that I mentioned incorporated within it.It appears as if this thing was just slapped together and what a shame because that's not the legacy of Walt Disney nor would Jimmie Dodd approve because it shows that Disney was not doing its best.",1,Do your best mouseketeers in everything that you do.,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2147,"['want', 'be', 'very', 'kind', 'writing', 'Jimmie', 'was', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'feel', 'former', 'employer', 'did', 'very', 'best', 'when', 'putting', 'out', 'DVD', 'Let', 'explain', 'why', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'expecting', 'very', 'same', 'visual', 'quality', 'have', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'not', 'there', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'probably', 'know', 'how', 'crisp', 'everything', 'looks', 'Obviously', 'great', 'deal', 'clean', 'up', 'went', 'shows', 'DVD', 'five', 'shows', 'least', 'opinipn', 'look', 'dingy', 'dirty', 'Not', 'clear', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'Now', 'pertaining', 'shows', 'used', 'own', 'ten', 'volume', 'VHS', 'set', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'already', 'own', 'five', 'episodes', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'use', 'creativity', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'vaults', 'use', 'rarities', 'were', 'not', 'ten', 'volume', 'set', 'just', 'grabbed', 'what', 'was', 'convenient', 'slapped', 'together', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anyone', 'who', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'put', 'together', 'feel', 'someone', 'who', 'money', 'put', 'together', 'Disney', 'proved', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'can', 'do', 'excellent', 'work', 'pertaining', 'putting', 'show', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'did', 'set', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'together', 'did', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'Disney', 'would', 'Walt', 'be', 'proud', 'always', 'wanted', 'provide', 'very', 'best', 'people', 'Disney', 'would', 'Jimmie', 'be', 'proud', 'was', 'always', 'urging', 'do', 'very', 'best', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'kind', 'when', 'started', 'review', 'However', 'sometimes', 'telling', 'truth', 'kindest', 'thing', 'do', 'maybe', 'will', 'persuade', 'Disney', 'do', 'very', 'best', 'next', 'time', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'everything', 'mentioned', 'incorporated', 'it.It', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'slapped', 'together', 'what', 'shame', 'not', 'legacy', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'would', 'Jimmie', 'Dodd', 'approve', 'Disney', 'was', 'not', 'doing', 'best']",The Best of the Original Mickey Mouse Club

896317,A2YVB5SRC1GP87,B0007Z9QXK,"Mark Myword ""Multi-Media Freak""","[4, 4]","I was enormously disappointed in this DVD. I had just reached the age of 5 when they were announcing the Mickey Mouse Club show. I don't think I ever missed an episode. I loved it, (had an enormous crush on Annette--but what boy at that time didn't?) What you have here are 5 half hours shows from the last season. Sadly even Talent Roundup Day was missing the great beginning of the earlier seasons when they sang ""Saddle your pony, here we go!""... Forget it... the tap-dance routine from Monday is shown instead.  I can never figure why they totally screwed up Circus Day's intro scene with Mickey. I recall distinctly that Mickey was saying ""Today is, ... uh... uh..."" and the kids in the background shouting ""Circus Day!"" to which he responded ""RIGHT!""... they've somehow or other dubbed it to a sequence making no sense at all, he greets the mousketeers then goes silent (while clearly still saying SOMETHING) then he shouts ""Right""! Go figure!  Also, the so-called ""dates"" for the 5 shows is completely false. I have no clue what those dates represent, but according to the menu, some are from the 60's, and the last year it showed on air was 58-59. These half-hour butcher jobs of the one hour MMC are pretty pitiful. But it's still nice to see the kids I sang and just plain enjoyed in those innocent days of the mid to late 1950's. Another disappointment was that while they had Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk INTRODUCE the NEW Hardy Boys serial (The Mystery Farm --or something akin to that)... not ONE serial show was on any of these.  All you get are 5 daily 30 minute (22 minutes sans commercials) shows--none of which link together cohesively. There was Monday (not sure if it actually was Fun with Music) then Tuesday: Guest Star Day  Wednesday: Anything can happen day -- Thursday -- Circus Day -- and Friday --Talent Roundup.  I gave it two stars simply on the nostalgia value.  As a good representation of what was a great show I would LOVE to have the complete season of-- I'd have given it a single star--and that would've been charity.",2,Bits and Pieces do NOT a MMC make!,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2054,"['was', 'enormously', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'had', 'just', 'reached', 'age', '5', 'when', 'were', 'announcing', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'missed', 'episode', 'loved', 'had', 'enormous', 'crush', 'Annette', 'what', 'boy', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'What', 'have', 'here', 'are', '5', 'half', 'hours', 'last', 'season', 'Sadly', 'even', 'Talent', 'Roundup', 'Day', 'was', 'missing', 'great', 'beginning', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'when', 'sang', 'Saddle', 'pony', 'here', 'go', 'Forget', 'tap-dance', 'routine', 'Monday', 'shown', 'instead', 'can', 'never', 'figure', 'why', 'totally', 'screwed', 'up', 'Circus', 'Day', 'intro', 'scene', 'Mickey', 'recall', 'distinctly', 'Mickey', 'was', 'saying', 'Today', 'uh', 'uh', 'kids', 'background', 'shouting', 'Circus', 'Day', 'responded', 'RIGHT', ""'ve"", 'somehow', 'other', 'dubbed', 'sequence', 'making', 'sense', 'mousketeers', 'then', 'silent', 'clearly', 'still', 'saying', 'SOMETHING', 'then', 'Right', 'Go', 'figure', 'Also', 'so-called', 'dates', '5', 'shows', 'completely', 'false', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'dates', 'represent', 'according', 'menu', 'are', '60', 'last', 'year', 'showed', 'air', 'was', '58-59', 'half-hour', 'butcher', 'jobs', 'one', 'hour', 'MMC', 'are', 'pretty', 'pitiful', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'kids', 'sang', 'just', 'plain', 'enjoyed', 'innocent', 'days', 'mid', 'late', '1950', 'disappointment', 'was', 'had', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'INTRODUCE', 'NEW', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'serial', 'Mystery', 'Farm', 'something', 'akin', 'not', 'ONE', 'serial', 'show', 'was', 'get', 'are', '5', 'daily', '30', 'minute', '22', 'minutes', 'sans', 'commercials', 'none', 'link', 'together', 'cohesively', 'was', 'Monday', 'not', 'sure', 'actually', 'was', 'Fun', 'Music', 'then', 'Tuesday', 'Guest', 'Star', 'Day', 'Wednesday', 'Anything', 'can', 'happen', 'day', 'Thursday', 'Circus', 'Day', 'Friday', 'Talent', 'Roundup', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'simply', 'nostalgia', 'value', 'good', 'representation', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'would', 'LOVE', 'have', 'complete', 'season', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'single', 'star', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'charity']",The Best of the Original Mickey Mouse Club

896319,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0007Z9QXK,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 4]","It's no Disney Treasures set, and it's certainly no season set. What we do get here is just a sampler, one episode for each weekday, of the 22 minute episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club. 22 minute episodes means these are episodes from the third season (1957) and from the later, recycled material seasons of the early 60s. It's not ideal, and it is hard to believe that this ""Best of the Mickey Mouse Club"" DVD truly carries some of the best episodes, but it's still nice for nostalgia's sake. We hardcore Disney fans, of course, still want some serious sets. On the bright side, unlike the existing Mickey Mouse Club Disney Treasures set (that holds the first 5 episodes of the show, 1 hour each), this DVD features Cheryl Holdridge episodes. I realize most guys at the time had a crush on Annette, but I was always a Cheryl guy (and no, I didn't grow up in the 50's, I was born in '75 and grew up on reruns... along with really cheesy reimaginings). She's adorable as usual here, though we really don't ever see her being featured beyond roll call.Anyway, here's what we do get:Fun With Music Day: A corny as heck musical number featuring Darlene in a pet shop, an intro to the upcoming Hardy Boys serial, ""Mystery of Ghost Farm"", and Doreen and Jimmie singing some Word to Grow By.Guest Star Day: An Olympic ice skating medalist does a very unpleasant comedy routine in drag and then cleans up for some regular tricks, our Mousekartoon is ""Ferdinand the Bull"", and Jimmie gives us more wise words with a Safety First song.Anything Can Happen Day: We start this one off with some fun entertainment by Disney animators' Dixieland band ""The Fire House 5 + 2"" along with music and antics from the Mouseketeers, then we get a Mousekartoon: ""Mickey's Nightmare"".Circus Day: After a fun roll call, we see a juggling performance, then Mousekartoon ""The Pied Piper"".  Jimmie ends things with some words of wisdom.Round-Up Day: Our last episode features a talent showcase by singer and Honorary Mouseketeer Cheryl Weinberg and her partners. Pretty weak by today's talent standards, but probably pretty impressive back then. We then get a Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel about Hawaiian culture seen on a visit by some Mouseketeer representatives, and finally, Jimmie gives us a Mouseke-fable.Overall, these aren't very spectacular episodes, but they are pleasant and entertaining for fans of the show, especially when the only other option is the Disney Treasures set of the very first 5 episodes. The weak points of this release are easy to point out. For one thing, these episodes are so short that much of the time is taken up by bad quality playings of cartoon shorts and, in the case of the first program, an intro to a serial that just makes us want to see it. I also feel like there were better guest and musical performances to be shared out there, though I don't have a great memory of the show to be more specific. Bottom line, a DVD of the Mickey Mouse Club really would work better with some hour long episodes if you're not going to give us complete seasons (which you really should, Disney). What the fans desire is more of the Mouseketeer performances (even if I called the Darlene one corny, as most of them are by today's standards) and the complete serials to view.  However, this doesn't mean we want them edited out of the show and presented on their own. That's... okay with the serials, but for the Mickey Mouse Club, we do want complete episodes (I enjoy the newsreels and other aspects of the show also), but preferably in chronological order and bigger bulk. C'mon, if some of the awful shows out there from television history get full DVD releases, why can't this one? And while you're at it, stop sitting on the Disney Afternoon shows too, and the Disney anthology show, and Honey I Shrunk the Kids the TV show... These ""Best Of"" discs just make the fan base that would be interested in purchasing them kinda mad. It works somewhat for Mickey Mouse Club though, since it's a variety show and not a situation program like, say, Goof Troop (which had one DVD release that was a joke), but those folks who will pay for this sample of the show they grew up loving will just as willing pay more for a larger collection, so give it to us already! The Treasures set was nice, but it was still just 5 episodes.Oh, and before I forget, there are zero bonus features on this DVD.

I thought maybe they'd throw in the color version of the animated opening. Nope.  The only thing in color are the obnoxious previews Disney puts on every product.  Even the color cover with Walt and the Mouseketeers leads you to believe there might be some color.  And yes, the prints are dingy.  Each episode appears to clock in at a little over 20 minutes.  Was something cut from each one?  They didn't show as many commercials in the 50s, so I can't imagine they were this short. And it is inexplicable why they give air dates of the 1960s for three of the five shows. I believe it  was off the air by 1959.  Look, for this price I don't expect perfection.  Notice the cover says Digitally Mastered, not Remastered.  But you do kind of expect a little bit more out a Disney product.  These barely rise above the level of kinescopes you have to view for a lot of 50s material. I didn't get the box set because I don't need that much, but this was a poor substitute.  If you just want to show a youngster what the show was like, you know, the famous songs at the beginning and end, then this is for you.
