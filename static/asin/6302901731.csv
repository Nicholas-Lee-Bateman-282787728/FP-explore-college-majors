And then another victim is killed in a similar fashion. There are still no clues. Suddenly, a correlation appears to surface: the women bought their cars from the same dealer. Morse and his crew spring into action swiftly to bring their man to justice. Ignoring procedures, protocols, and even the law, they rush to judgment.""Driven to Distraction"" is a fine piece of mystery writing but the saddest of the Morse episodes. Without revealing too much, we find our lovable curmudgeon a little less lovable. He takes on a decidedly more human (i.e. flawed character) than before. There is a reflective sadness about this episode that is rather haunting.",5,Intricate. Unexpected. Thought-Provoking.

344609,A2EXZ4N9INMT6O,6302901731,William J. Thor,"[3, 3]","This entry provides another variation of stories in the Morse series.  The apparent unrelated murder of three women challenges Morse to find a common denominator which will tie the deaths together. With no apparent link, Morse begins to reach for clues.  The music of Cole Porter is our background sound track as Morse becomes obsessed with an auto dealer as the culprit.  To this end homes are entered and searched without a warrant and an arrest is made without probable cause - all of which incurs the wrath of Superintendent Strange - so much so that he pulls Morse off the case.  Lewis is also upset with the irregularities and withdraws from assisting Morse.  As usual Morse continues, unofficially, along with a police specialist, who deals in crimes against females.  With only two other legitimate suspects we are in for quite an ending.  Along the way Morse attends driving school and discusses his Jaguar at length.  The story is straight forward; a solid four star effort.",4,Let's Talk Cars,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,984,"['entry', 'variation', 'stories', 'Morse', 'series', 'apparent', 'unrelated', 'murder', 'three', 'women', 'Morse', 'find', 'common', 'denominator', 'will', 'tie', 'deaths', 'together', 'apparent', 'link', 'Morse', 'reach', 'clues', 'music', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'background', 'sound', 'track', 'Morse', 'obsessed', 'auto', 'dealer', 'culprit', 'end', 'homes', 'are', 'entered', 'searched', 'warrant', 'arrest', 'made', 'probable', 'cause', 'wrath', 'Superintendent', 'Strange', 'so', 'much', 'Morse', 'case', 'Lewis', 'also', 'upset', 'irregularities', 'withdraws', 'assisting', 'Morse', 'usual', 'Morse', 'unofficially', 'police', 'specialist', 'who', 'crimes', 'females', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'legitimate', 'suspects', 'are', 'quite', 'ending', 'way', 'Morse', 'driving', 'school', 'Jaguar', 'length', 'story', 'straight', 'forward', 'solid', 'four', 'star', 'effort']",N/A
344610,A1S56U8GV9C8F9,6302901731,Wilson Smith,"[16, 16]","Like a lot of the Inspector Morse films, a big clue to cracking the case is contained in the title. Including Morse and Lewis, there is a third person who plays an equally significant part in the investigations in this film: DS Maitland, an expert on crimes against women, of which this case is. She just happens to be one, too. This is perhaps the most straightforward storyline, with only a few twists and turns, one of which crops up at the very end, turning the investigation upside down, and also causing everything to fall into place and make sense. Morse is adamant he has his man from the very start and his contempt for the individual, not only an arrogant car salesman but a blackmailer and convicted wifebeater to boot, blinds his judgment. There are many red herrings in this case and the general rule in writing a ""whodunit"" - i.e. make the last person the viewer would expect to have done it, do it - is employed cunningly. Overall, this is another shining example of the classy series, brilliantly written by Academy Award Winner Anthony Minghella and directed by Sandy Johnson. It is not difficult to see why this is one of the Morse films Colin Dexter selected as his favorites.",5,Driven to the Wrong Conclusion,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,1195,"['lot', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'films', 'big', 'clue', 'cracking', 'case', 'contained', 'title', 'Including', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'third', 'person', 'who', 'equally', 'significant', 'part', 'investigations', 'film', 'DS', 'Maitland', 'expert', 'crimes', 'women', 'case', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'too', 'perhaps', 'most', 'straightforward', 'storyline', 'only', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'one', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'turning', 'investigation', 'upside', 'down', 'also', 'causing', 'everything', 'fall', 'place', 'make', 'sense', 'Morse', 'adamant', 'man', 'very', 'start', 'contempt', 'individual', 'not', 'only', 'arrogant', 'car', 'salesman', 'blackmailer', 'convicted', 'wifebeater', 'boot', 'judgment', 'are', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'case', 'general', 'rule', 'writing', 'whodunit', 'i.e', 'make', 'last', 'person', 'viewer', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'done', 'do', 'employed', 'cunningly', 'Overall', 'shining', 'example', 'classy', 'series', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'directed', 'Sandy', 'Johnson', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'Morse', 'films', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'selected', 'favorites']",N/A
344611,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6302901731,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","This is a great episode in the Inspector Morse series, but also one of the most frustrating. A serial killer is targeting single young women and Morse hones in one suspect - owner of a car dealership who also happens to be married yet carries on with affairs. Morse dislikes the smooth talker on sight and quickly jumps to the conclusion that the auto dealer is his man. Morse's prejudice causes him to be blind to all other clues regarding the case and it is only with the persistence of Lewis and a female sergeant, Maitland that they manage to get Morse back on track and pursuing clues leading to the real killer. The process though is long and laborious and it is only towards the end of the episode that the identity of the real killer is made known.As always, the acting is top notch and John Thaw is amazing as Inspector Morse and Kevin Whately is wonderful as the ever loyal Lewis. The music is another highlight of this show and this episode features some wonderful tracks.",5,"Morse, Lewis, and a female DS try to catch a serial killer",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,983,"['great', 'episode', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'frustrating', 'serial', 'killer', 'targeting', 'single', 'young', 'women', 'Morse', 'hones', 'one', 'suspect', 'owner', 'car', 'dealership', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'married', 'yet', 'affairs', 'Morse', 'smooth', 'talker', 'sight', 'quickly', 'jumps', 'conclusion', 'auto', 'dealer', 'man', 'Morse', 'prejudice', 'be', 'blind', 'other', 'clues', 'regarding', 'case', 'only', 'persistence', 'Lewis', 'female', 'sergeant', 'Maitland', 'manage', 'get', 'Morse', 'back', 'track', 'pursuing', 'clues', 'leading', 'real', 'killer', 'process', 'long', 'laborious', 'only', 'end', 'episode', 'identity', 'real', 'killer', 'made', 'known.As', 'always', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'John', 'Thaw', 'amazing', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'wonderful', 'ever', 'loyal', 'Lewis', 'music', 'highlight', 'show', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'tracks']",N/A
