1599986,AGEIT17HENDIS,B009NNM9OA,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I seem of late to be on a baseball story spree having just reviewed director Billy Crystal&#8217;s homage to Roger Maris (and Mickey Mantle) in the film 61* (the silly asterisk denoting until much later that Roger had done his record- breaking deed in a 162 game season and the immortal Babe Ruth&#8217;s 60 in 154. Such are the number powers, statistical numbers powers, and inanities that drive sports, particularly baseball). There I noted as I do here since the time period of the film under review, 42, the story of Jackie Robison&#8217;s heroic efforts to integrate major league baseball in 1947, a time before television drew crowds away, baseball was indeed something like the national pastime for sports aficionados. I also noted there that was a time before 24/7/365 ESPN all-sports-all-the-time when there were distinct seasons to sport and not so much overlapping. A time when, for example, the World Series in baseball was over before the chilly winds of November snow-delayed games in northern climes. A time when the national pastime was indeed the national pastime and life was, or seemed to be, slower, slow enough to listen or watch a game for a couple of hours or occasionally go out to the ballpark and not put a big dent in your monthly discretionary budget. Hey, if you don&#8217;t believe me just as your fathers, or ouch, grandfathers they will tell you true. All this can serve as backdrop to give an idea of how controversial, how shocking in some quarters, Jackie Robinson&#8217;s deed was since all previous premises in baseball were based on its displaying the white man&#8217;s athletic prowess. Blacks (and Latinos, at least open Latinos unlike Ted Williams) were okay to watch the game (and in the South in the &#8220;colored&#8221; sections) but not to be on the same ball field as whites.All this sports talk, baseball talk is a somewhat unusual subject for this writer to discuss since unlike almost every other kid in my growing working-class neighborhood of North Adamsville I did not play the game when I was tall enough to wave a bat or don a glove. Reason: no skill, no athletic skills (although that has not stopped generations of &#8220;no skill&#8221; kindred from being critical sportswriters, play-by-play broadcasters and barroom experts). Oh sure, as a kid I would  collect the baseball cards that came with the bubblegum we would cadge money for in order to go to the local mom and pop variety store and chance our luck to see if we could get Ted/Mickey/Willie/Jackie and all in our packet, and to trade our duplicates. And sure, as well, I used to &#8220;flip&#8221; cards against the school house wall to try to win some coveted card and also use any loose duplicates to stick with clothespins on my bicycle to make it sound like a junior motorcycle. But I did not play, did not go to professional games at Fenway (home of the 1950s lowly Red Sox) or pay attention to the game much in the newspapers (except to see how far the Sox were out of first place occasionally). I also knew, 1950s knew, that there were black baseball players around which seemed a natural thing. So it was somewhat disconcerting years later, a fact which got confirmed by viewing this fine film, when I found out that major league baseball had only been integrated in 1947. And that integration was a close thing dependent on the spunk of Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (played by old codger, now old codger, Harrison Ford) and one super black baseball player Jackie Robinson (played by Chadwick Boseman).Unlike the story line in 61* where the subject entailed pursuit of a legendary record, the home run record, which captured the nation&#8217;s attention, or at least baseball nation&#8217;s attention this integration question cut to the core. Almost every aspect of national pastime baseball came into play in this integration process starting in the Mister Jim Crow South where most major leagues teams had their spring training and where, as one graphic scene showed, black ballplayers could not legally be on the same filed as whites, ditto drinking fountains, restrooms, hotels, restaurants, hell, even airline flights. And it did not get much better heading north, including in Brooklyn and, of course within the Dodger organization. Damn, no, double damn.I mentioned in the 61* review that I would have been much more sympathetic to Maris&#8217; struggle if I had known some of the details presented in the film about how the fans, hell, even Yankee fans, trashed him because they did not want to see Babe&#8217;s record fall or would rather have seen the Mick get it. That was kids&#8217; stuff compared to what Jackie faced. This film shows Robinson&#8217;s perseverance in the face of all those pressures from fans, from the parasitic sportswriters following the saga (except the lone black reporter/friend/chauffer present), and the effect it had on him personally and on his family. Funny baseball has changed a lot in the past fifty years since Jackie&#8217;s feat brought slews of black, Latinos and Asian players to the majors. But from all reports gnarly sport-writers and rabid fans (and here not meaning devoted) are still with us.",5,When The National Pastime Really Was the National Pastime,1402099200,"06 7,

First, it did a good job of depicting the attitudes and opinions of people in and about baseball and segregation in the post WWII-years.  Second, it contains, IOM, the best acting I have ever seen by Harrison Ford.  Again, IMO, it is Oscar-worthy.Don't get me wrong, Harrison Ford is larger than life as Han Solo and Indiana Jones, but in ""42"" he hit his full stride as an actor, showing that he's much, much more than an action-adventure icon.This film does a great modeling the battle between civil rights/decency and bigotry/""JIm Crow"" America using Jackie Robinson and MLB.  I was deeply impressed by the treatment of the subject and the quality of people it took to take it on.  They all had their own reasons for doing so, but in the end, they collectively did this country a great service.  Plus, Robinson and others previously banned from MLB due to race, made significant contributions that improved the game and increased its stature in American culture - and I'm not even a baseball fan.If you thought this was ""just a baseball movie"" you'd be mistaken.

1600013,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009NNM9OA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","If you're a baseball fan, this is a can't miss movie.  It accurately shows the difficulties of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier to be accepted in what was then a sport only whites participated in, that being baseball in the mid to late 40's.  42 is an extraordinary film on an emotional level.  Then many struggles Jackie had to overcome isn't fully shown in all its distasteful display until almost halfway through the film.  Everything up to this point is typical stuff you probably already knew.I had NO idea a guy named Ben Chapman, manager of the Phillies at the time was such a disrespectful moron.  This actually bothers me on a personal level since the Phillies are my hometeam and I have to support them no matter what.  However, I can't possibly support this guys racist attitude and inability to stop shouting insults at a defenseless Jackie whenever he stepped up to the plate to bat.  Talk about inappropriate and obnoxious.  If a manager or player ever did such a thing nowadays he'd be fired on the spot and rightfully so.Ben Chapman stinks!  Maybe there's a reason I didn't know about this individual despite being a huge baseball fan all these years- it's better to ignore and never acknowledge such terrible people.  I do have to warn viewers, especially African Americans- this part of the movie with Ben insulting Jackie is *extremely* hard to watch because he relentlessly and shamelessly insults Jackie by calling him every name in the book, and I mean *every* name.  I recommend ignoring the part of the movie when the Brooklyn Dodgers face the Phillies.  This is hurtful to me as a Phillies fan.  I can't support someone like Ben Chapman and hopefully nobody else would either.  Living near Philadelphia all my life, and despite the hundreds of Phillies games I've watched over the years, it is amazing Ben's name hasn't been brought up even once.  He must have been as awful as he's portrayed in 42.Other than this, the movie shows other white players occasionally voicing their frustration concerning Jackie being a part of their team, or having to pitch against him on the opposing teams, but nothing and I mean NOTHING was as bad as Ben Chapman's involvement in that one segment.  The part with the Pittsburgh Pirates player hitting Jackie with a fastball is hard to watch too.It's absolutely honorable that Jackie Robinson, despite being treated unfairly on numerous occasions, would get back into the game time and time again and sometimes even smile.  He was mentally a very strong person, stronger than me and perhaps most people out there.  Though he almost broke down in one segment where he walked down the stairs of the dugout and went ballistic breaking his baseball bat into pieces, he held it together with some much needed encouragement just enough to make a name for himself and become the first African American player in the history of baseball.  That's why players wear number 42 once a season every April.  Baseball players nowadays have it made in comparison to what Jackie Robinson had to persevere.  What a moving movie.It does honestly take a while to get going and has its share of dry periods (such as Jackie's relationship with his wife which was nothing particularly interesting) but the second half completely changes all that and makes this a must-watch recommendation for baseball fans.",5,"if you ever wanted to know why the number 42 is retired, watch this movie",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,3352,"[""'re"", 'baseball', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'accurately', 'difficulties', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'breaking', 'color', 'barrier', 'be', 'accepted', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'sport', 'only', 'participated', 'being', 'baseball', 'mid', 'late', '40', '42', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'emotional', 'level', 'Then', 'many', 'struggles', 'Jackie', 'had', 'overcome', ""n't"", 'fully', 'shown', 'distasteful', 'display', 'almost', 'halfway', 'film', 'Everything', 'up', 'point', 'typical', 'stuff', 'probably', 'already', 'knew.I', 'had', 'NO', 'idea', 'guy', 'named', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'manager', 'Phillies', 'time', 'was', 'such', 'disrespectful', 'moron', 'actually', 'personal', 'level', 'Phillies', 'are', 'hometeam', 'have', 'support', 'matter', 'what', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'support', 'guys', 'racist', 'attitude', 'inability', 'stop', 'shouting', 'insults', 'defenseless', 'Jackie', 'whenever', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'bat', 'Talk', 'inappropriate', 'obnoxious', 'manager', 'player', 'ever', 'did', 'thing', ""'d"", 'be', 'fired', 'spot', 'rightfully', 'so.Ben', 'Chapman', 'Maybe', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'individual', 'being', 'huge', 'baseball', 'fan', 'years-', 'better', 'ignore', 'never', 'acknowledge', 'such', 'terrible', 'people', 'do', 'have', 'warn', 'viewers', 'especially', 'African', 'Americans-', 'part', 'movie', 'Ben', 'insulting', 'Jackie', '*extremely*', 'hard', 'watch', 'relentlessly', 'shamelessly', 'insults', 'Jackie', 'calling', 'name', 'book', 'mean', '*every*', 'name', 'recommend', 'ignoring', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'face', 'Phillies', 'hurtful', 'Phillies', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'support', 'someone', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'hopefully', 'nobody', 'else', 'would', 'either', 'Living', 'Philadelphia', 'life', 'hundreds', 'Phillies', 'games', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'years', 'amazing', 'Ben', 'name', ""n't"", 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'even', 'once', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'awful', 'portrayed', '42.Other', 'movie', 'other', 'white', 'players', 'occasionally', 'voicing', 'frustration', 'concerning', 'Jackie', 'being', 'part', 'team', 'having', 'pitch', 'opposing', 'teams', 'nothing', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'involvement', 'one', 'segment', 'part', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'player', 'hitting', 'Jackie', 'fastball', 'hard', 'watch', 'too.It', 'absolutely', 'honorable', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'being', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'sometimes', 'even', 'smile', 'was', 'mentally', 'very', 'strong', 'person', 'stronger', 'perhaps', 'most', 'people', 'there', 'almost', 'broke', 'down', 'one', 'segment', 'where', 'walked', 'down', 'stairs', 'dugout', 'went', 'ballistic', 'breaking', 'baseball', 'bat', 'pieces', 'held', 'together', 'much', 'needed', 'encouragement', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'name', 'become', 'first', 'African', 'American', 'player', 'history', 'baseball', 'why', 'players', 'wear', 'number', '42', 'once', 'season', 'April', 'Baseball', 'players', 'nowadays', 'have', 'made', 'comparison', 'what', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'had', 'persevere', 'What', 'moving', 'movie.It', 'honestly', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'share', 'dry', 'periods', 'such', 'Jackie', 'relationship', 'wife', 'was', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'second', 'half', 'completely', 'must-watch', 'recommendation', 'baseball', 'fans']",42

1600044,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B009NNM9OA,Chris Kennison,"[3, 7]","What is it about baseball that touches our emotions and runs so synonymous with our American culture? In the new movie ""42"", about the early career of Jackie Robinson, the first African-American professional baseball player, the culture of the mid-1940's is explored. At a time when racism was rampant, a man named Branch Rickey, an executive with the Brooklyn Dodgers, changed baseball forever. He wanted to win and he saw a flood of untapped talent in the Negro Leagues.Much of what Jackie Robinson became as a man and as a baseball player can be attributed to Rickey, but nobody had to face the fire like Robinson. Chadwick Boseman plays the legendary Jackie Robinson and for lack of better words, he hit it out of the park. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey. For a long while, it is sort of strange to see Ford as a older, puffy, weathered and worn old baseball executive. Yet, he also delivers a top-notch performance as the guy behind the scenes, pulling the string, knowingly orchestrating the future.""42"" is beautifully filmed and accurately filmed. In fact, it may be one of the most authentically filmed baseball films ever. The ballparks are recreated beautifully. Everything is authentically detailed from the gloves, to the practice fields and even the lack of lights at the Negro League games. To list all the things that the movie creators did to authenticate their film, would take up my entire review.While the movie is beautifully film and authentically filmed, I felt that it played out too much like a historical timeline document. The film covers the first two years of his time in the Dodgers organization and it is essentially a by the numbers sort of story arch. He did this and then this happened and then this did, etc. There were some powerful scenes where we see Robinson's steel faade crack a bit, but as a whole the movie never came close to effecting my emotions like other baseball or sports movies have. The bad thing is, this one should have because it is real and the story deserved that emotional impact.Jackie Robinson's story is an amazing one and an important one. In many ways, Robinson changed the culture of America more than Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks. He carried himself with honor and he was part of something that America loved and those that didn't like it, could do nothing about; baseball. For that, ""42"" is an essential film and a good one. Unfortunately for ""42"" though, Roy Hobbs batting despite a knife wound and Ray Kinsella playing catch with his father are still the benchmark for baseball movie moments.

I liked it a lot and am glad I saw it, and will await the DVD.  The movie tells the story of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball because of the conviction of his manager Branch Rickey, who is played by Harrison Ford.  Rickey felt called by the Bible to hire a black baseball player to the Brooklyn Dodgers to battle segregation.  I agree with some professional movie critics that Harrison Ford does the most risk-taking in the movie (that is, steps outside of a safe formula).  He plays a character with even a different voice than he normally has, as well as a different kind of personality.  Branch Rickey is a tough guy with outspoken moral conviction, what people would call a ""Bible-thumper"".  I like it that when his religious conviction becomes part of the humor of the movie, the humor doesn't disrespect religion, but just contrasts his conviction with the lackadaisical attitude of others.  I also like it that unlike a lot of movies, crude language wasn't just thrown into this movie in a carefree way.  For the most part, the language occurred when racial tensions were high, instead of just as a part of normal conversation.The relationship between Jackie and his wife is an enjoyable one, and the movie shows a rewarding change in the attitude of the Dodgers team toward Jackie.  In storytelling, the only thing which I felt was missing in this movie was a sense of direction at the end.  The storyline ends with Jackie gaining acceptance by his team and a set of images depicting successive games with a fanfare soundtrack, and I think it could have had a little more closure.  My overall two impressions of the movie are:  1. Inspires you to fight for your convictions and 2.

I want to say that having Harrison Ford play him was a great choice. Now the baseball fan I've loved the sport for the last 12 years I like the psychological aspects of baseball and really the facets that many people don't understand. And I knew about Branch Rickey because I had watched the Ken Burns documentary Baseball and he was highlighted really as somebody who really helped baseball step out of its racist shadow.I recommend watching that if you haven't it's available on Amazon prime.Our GameIt's also available on DVD here:Baseball: A Film by Ken Burns (Includes The Tenth Inning)But with that in mind when they tell you about 42 because before the Ken Burns documentary I didn't really understand what Jackie Robinson went through and how much of a hero he needed to be. And after I'd watched the Ken Burns documentary and then I saw that this movie was coming out I was really excited. I'm somebody who likes bio pics especially if I already know the history (the accurate history that is) of the events.  And I think 42 delivers as a solid biopic that really introduces you to interesting time/sad time in recent American history.I think the acting and this was top-notch just a great movie all around and if you're a fan of baseball or fan of seeing white crackers be stupid redneck honkies you will not be disappointed.

However, ten years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in the segregated south, Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers had to endure the kind of abuse and cruelty most of us today regard as vicious, unconscionable, and even unforgivable. The heroism of Robinson is summed up by the film &#34;42&#34; which is also credits the man who decided to allow the first African-American baseball player to don a uniform of a team in the White Major Leagues, Branch Ricky. (The so-called Negro Leagues were as professional and quite profitable prior to Robinson's crossing the racial barrier.)In the words of George Will as stated in Ken Burns' documentary &#34;Baseball&#34; Jackie Robinson, played by Chadwick Boseman in an academy-award caliber performance, was the first heroic figure of what will become the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Robinson, according to Will, was nearly as important to the movement as Dr. King. This outstanding biopic chronicles the man who challenged current status quo while playing highly competitive athletic competitions amidst jibes, curses, and epithets. To understand what Robinson endured and still be able to compete in professional baseball at the highest levels, is no less than an extraordinary achievement in the human drama of any age of history, according to Wills.The story is presented from three perspectives: mostly from Jackie Robinson's eyes, occasionally from his wife's (played by Nicole Beharie), and from the perspective of the man who made the controversial move, Branch Rickie, played by Harrison Ford in possibly the finest performance of his career. (My hope is both Boseman and Ford will be nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars, respectively.) According to the film, Robinson had two gifts, his ability as an outstanding athlete by any standard, and his ability to take the blows of hatred without retaliation. In Ricky's words, Robinson had to be man enough and big enough to turn the other cheek, as Gandhi did in South Africa and India, and as Martin Luther King Jr and the civil rights protesters did shortly thereafter.On one level the film is a triumph of the human spirit but also a sobering indictment of what America had been prior to the Civil Rights Movement: a racially intolerant nation. Some of the most heroic moments are when Robinson is the target of such vitriolic abuse that he nearly breaks down but finds the courage to rise and take the field again amidst the mockery of opponents and spectators. Nearly as compelling are when his teammates begin to stand up for him and point out the cowardice of his abusers. Even Branch Ricky in one memorable scene, acknowledges that he doesn't know the pain of the abuse thrown at Robinson, and he supports Robinson as if they are both enduring these tests of character together to some degree. In a poignant moment, Ricky reveals why he made the first step towards integrating White Major League Baseball. &#34;42&#34; is without question the best offering in film thus far in 2013. Hopefully, the Academy of Motion Pictures will bring deserved nominations to all the leads, and hopefully the film will garner a few wins. Robinson deserves another home run because he made American Baseball truly the &#34;national&#34; pastime rather than the segregated sport it had been.",5,Outstanding Docudrama of the Man Who May Have Single-Handedly Ushered in the Civil Rights Movement,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,3555,"['often', 'associate', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'United', 'States', 'events', 'such', 'Montgomery', 'Alabama', 'Bus', 'Boycott', '1950', 'marches', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', '1960', 'However', 'ten', 'years', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'refused', 'give', 'up', 'seat', 'bus', 'segregated', 'south', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'had', 'endure', 'kind', 'abuse', 'cruelty', 'most', 'today', 'regard', 'vicious', 'unconscionable', 'even', 'unforgivable', 'heroism', 'Robinson', 'summed', 'up', 'film', '34', '42', '34', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'decided', 'allow', 'first', 'African-American', 'baseball', 'player', 'don', 'uniform', 'team', 'White', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'Branch', 'Ricky', 'so-called', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'were', 'professional', 'quite', 'profitable', 'prior', 'Robinson', 'crossing', 'racial', 'barrier', 'words', 'George', 'Will', 'stated', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', '34', 'Baseball', '34', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'played', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'academy-award', 'caliber', 'performance', 'was', 'first', 'heroic', 'figure', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'United', 'States', 'Robinson', 'according', 'Will', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'important', 'movement', 'Dr.', 'King', 'outstanding', 'biopic', 'man', 'who', 'challenged', 'current', 'status', 'quo', 'playing', 'highly', 'competitive', 'athletic', 'competitions', 'amidst', 'jibes', 'curses', 'epithets', 'understand', 'what', 'Robinson', 'endured', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'compete', 'professional', 'baseball', 'highest', 'levels', 'less', 'extraordinary', 'achievement', 'human', 'drama', 'age', 'history', 'according', 'Wills.The', 'story', 'presented', 'three', 'perspectives', 'mostly', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'eyes', 'occasionally', 'wife', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Beharie', 'perspective', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'controversial', 'move', 'Branch', 'Rickie', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'possibly', 'finest', 'performance', 'career', 'hope', 'Boseman', 'Ford', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'respectively', 'According', 'film', 'Robinson', 'had', 'two', 'gifts', 'ability', 'outstanding', 'athlete', 'standard', 'ability', 'take', 'blows', 'hatred', 'retaliation', 'Ricky', 'words', 'Robinson', 'had', 'be', 'man', 'enough', 'big', 'enough', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'Gandhi', 'did', 'South', 'Africa', 'India', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'civil', 'rights', 'protesters', 'did', 'shortly', 'thereafter.On', 'one', 'level', 'film', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'also', 'sobering', 'indictment', 'what', 'America', 'had', 'been', 'prior', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'racially', 'intolerant', 'nation', 'most', 'heroic', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Robinson', 'target', 'such', 'vitriolic', 'abuse', 'nearly', 'breaks', 'down', 'courage', 'rise', 'take', 'field', 'again', 'mockery', 'opponents', 'spectators', 'Nearly', 'compelling', 'are', 'when', 'teammates', 'begin', 'stand', 'up', 'point', 'out', 'cowardice', 'abusers', 'Even', 'Branch', 'Ricky', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', ""n't"", 'know', 'pain', 'abuse', 'thrown', 'Robinson', 'Robinson', 'are', 'enduring', 'tests', 'character', 'together', 'degree', 'poignant', 'moment', 'Ricky', 'why', 'made', 'first', 'step', 'towards', 'integrating', 'White', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', '34', '42', '34', 'question', 'best', 'offering', 'film', 'thus', 'far', '2013', 'Hopefully', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'will', 'bring', 'deserved', 'nominations', 'leads', 'hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'garner', 'few', 'wins', 'Robinson', 'home', 'run', 'made', 'American', 'Baseball', 'truly', '34', 'national', '34', 'pastime', 'rather', 'segregated', 'sport', 'had', 'been']",42

However, over the course of history, there may be no story of greater importance than that of Jackie Robinson, the lone man who broke through Major League Baseball's color barrier and changed the sport, as well as our nation, forever.42 tells the story of these amazing figures and the trials they endured to make Jackie Robinson the first African-American player in the game. In the film, the legendary athlete is played by newcomer Chadwick Boseman who does a terrific job given the weight and importance of the man he's portraying, and whose performance is earnest and inspirational. Of course, Robinson's journey couldn't have happened without Branch Rickey, the GM of the Brooklyn Dodgers who risked everything to take a stand against prejudice. That man is played by Harrison Ford, who plays the part fantastically. The pair have some great on-screen moments and really add to the film's authenticity. All-in-all it's a very well-rounded cast with some strong supporting roles, including John C. McGinley as Red Barber and Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese.This film is a fantastic biopic of one of sports's most important figures. The performances are great and there's some really good baseball action as well. The film also contains more humor than I would have expected, most of which comes from Robinson's Dodger teammates.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[1, 2]","""42"" about Jackie Robinson, the first African American major league baseball player, is a beautiful, inspirational, must-see movie. ""42"" has been accused of being corny. For heaven's sake, it IS corny. Jackie Robinson was a true hero, as was Branch Rickey, the white man who decided to break the color line in baseball. This is an old-fashioned, all-American, even Christian story that makes you tear up and get goosebumps. ""42"" is about good v evil. The bad guys in this movie are repellant scum. The good guys are true heroes of historic proportions. I wish more people would see this film.It's the late 1940s. America has defeated Nazism. It's time for the Civil Rights movement to defeat white supremacy in the US. Baseball executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) selects Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to be the first African American player on a major league team. This choice puts Robinson's life at risk.Pitchers attempt to hit Robinson in the head with their balls. Base-runners drive their spiked heels into his legs. Philadelphia Phillies' Ben Chapman hectors Robinson when he is at bat. Chapman repeats ugly, disgusting insults. Robinson is powerless to silence Chapman. Hotel owners won't allow any members of the same team as Robinson to rent rooms. Robinson's own teammates shun him and sign a petition protesting his inclusion. Robinson must wait until his teammates are done in the shower room before he can shower. While his teammates are given lockers, he is given only a peg with a hanger. Toughs arrive at his house and threaten him so badly he must be driven out of town. Letter writers threaten to harm his wife and child.Robinson's heroism in facing all this is the inspiration. Branch Rickey is also a hero. He was a devout Christian. He chides an interlocutor, ""Love they neighbor as thyself. That is repeated eight times in the Bible, more than any other commandment.""""42"" isn't an especially deep film. It does not probe deeply into any of its characters. It presents the history of baseball's integration in a fairly straightforward, easy to follow way. Production values are high. The 1940s era is captured in vintage clothes, cars, ballpark ads and architecture.Chadwick Boseman is handsome, heroic, and stoic as Jackie Robinson. Nicole Beharie is incredibly beautiful as his wife Rachel. Harrison Ford is a bit hammy as Branch Rickey, but he's Harrison Ford, so he can get away with it.I loved this movie and I wish everyone would see it.

There are always going to be people who think more needed to be added and that certain things that were of vast importance were left out.  With ""42"" I think the right mix was hit upon to convey the basics of the Jackie Robinson story in the time frame that they had.The movie looked beautiful, portraying the time period in a way that movies of that era might have looked which I think helped capture the moment well.  The ballpark scenes were vivid and alive and looked like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.  Of course, the illusion of that is shattered when you have the fans in the stands yelling racially charged statements at a player.  Whether intentional or not, it struck a chord with me to have something so ugly going on in such an idyllic setting.I've read reviews that say the movie is full of inaccuracies, and if you're looking for a hard-core research movie this certainly isn't for you, but it even states at the beginning that the movie is based upon real events, it doesn't pretend that word for word and scene for scene is actually how Jackie Robinson's life actually happened.  I have read other reviews that complain that Robinson is put on too much of a pedestal in this movie.  So what?

As a child I used to devour tales of the great baseball players of the past and the history of the game.  It goes without saying that I'm well versed in the story of Jackie Robinson's integration of major league baseball in 1947.  The significance of this event is so apparent to me that in 1997 I went to the game where my beloved Phillies retired his number with his widow Rachel in attendance.  Those who view this film won't miss the irony because the Phillies may have been Robinson's worst tormentors when he first started playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Writer-director Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for co-scripting ""L.A. Confidential"" with Curtis Hansen, is fully aware that hardcore baseball fans and students of history know the intricacies of Robinson's ordeal and is at pains to give an accurate portrait.  The film follows Robinson from his time in the Negro Leagues until the end of the Dodgers 1947 season when they won the National League pennant.  Helgeland gets all the arcana correct but he's careful not to give us a dry history lesson.  Chadwick Boseman is fine as Robinson and he is supported magnificently by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, general manager of the Dodgers.  Ford's turn as the curmudgeonly Rickey is so good it would be an injustice if he weren't nominated for an Oscar.  A testament as to what a good film this is that you want more.  The running time is 128 minutes and you probably could add 20 more minutes to flesh out Robinson's story to better know this incredible man.  As a sidebar I'd like to digress and relate my reminisces when Hank Aaron was challenging Babe Ruth's homerun record in 1974.  It was an exciting time for me as a young baseball fan.  It wasn't until years later that I found out that Aaron was receiving death threats for being an African American challenging the Great Bambino's record.

1600092,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B009NNM9OA,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","We're all familiar with Jackie Robinson's story, how he was the first African-American to break the ""color barrier"" of major league baseball, making history in 1947 as first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Yet the highly inspiring film 42 takes away the nuance of such a statement and gives the viewer the stark, brutal, ugly racism that Robinson endured--not only from a skeptical public, but from his very own teammates.  There are several scenes that are downright jarring, and through all the hostility it was Robinson himself who had to exercise herculean self-control.  (Easily the most jarring scene takes place while Robinson is at bat and simultaneously being viciously taunted by Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, played by Alan Tudyk.)  Yet it's Robinson's playmaking abilities on the field that begin to win hearts and minds, as the Dodgers come together as a team and make their historic pennant run in the summer of 1947.  So in addition to the historical ramifications 42 is also a compelling, highly entertaining sports movie.Chadwick Boseman gives a commanding performance in the lead role, depicting Jackie Robinson as a determined, gritty professional focused on not only making the team, but succeeding at the highest level of baseball.  Nicole Beharie is solid as Rachel, Jackie's always-supportive, constantly-worrying wife.  Yet the cast excels by veteran actor Harrison Ford's portrayal of Dodgers GM Branch Rickey, a compassionate, yet tough-as-nails pioneer determined to bring the first black ballplayer to major league baseball.  Sporting shaggy eyebrows and constantly holding a half-smoked cigar, Ford's Rickey sets the National League on its proverbial ear, and is it fun to watch.  Finally, I also enjoyed Christopher Meloni as my-way-or-the-highway Dodgers manager Leo Durocher.  Meloni gives his white players a spring training dress-down that had me grinning ear to ear.  42 has everything, from compelling drama to outstanding baseball action to absolute inspiration.

A fine and convincing script also helps to make this film the success that it is.Still, the scope of the film has its limitations. ""42"" would have been enhanced by a more all-inclusive biography of Robinson in regard to his earlier life and service in WWII. While in high school and junior college, Robinson excelled at four different sports: Baseball, basketball, football, and track.

Instead of simply having one of the characters tell us that, while serving as an army officer, he had been court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a military bus, it would have been nice to see that happen via flashback.

On the very few occasions where we see cracks in Robinson's veneer, the film is intensely interesting. That's the real draw, to me, how a fiery man struggled to tame his very loud emotions in the pursuit of an insurmountably lofty, important ideal. 42 only gives us a brief taste, sadly, choosing instead to invest its time in tired, overplayed vignettes (hey, it turns out southerners were resistant to integration) and a thin, after-school-special grade performance from its cast. Harrison Ford is a lot of fun as the brash, cocksure executive Branch Rickey, who chose to integrate MLB on his own volition, but he's so makeup caked and under-inspected that it's tough to see the role as more than just a particularly eccentric joyride.

I actually thought there would be more racism. It seemed like it may have been toned down a bit for ratings. Still, some scenes were pretty uncomfortable to watch. I know it&#8217;s important to know this history, but it&#8217;s difficult to watch. Seeing people being treated inhumanly brings out a lot of emotions.

1600121,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009NNM9OA,FNDNreview,"[2, 2]","When debating the greatest baseball players to ever step foot on the field, the same names usually enter the discussion.  More often than not, the number one slot will belong to Babe Ruth or possibly even Willie Mays, but after that - it's all wide open.  What does this have to do with film?  You can usually tell a baseball player is amongst the greatest of all-time if his lifelong tale is depicted on the big screen.  Shoeless Joe Jackson is a favorite amongst filmmakers, since he's one of the most controversial players in the history of the game - being portrayed in Field of Dreams, Eight Men Out, and was one of the inspirations behind the main character in The Natural.  Babe Ruth (The Babe), Roger Maris & Mickey Mantle (61*), and Ty Cobb (Cobb) are just a few of the baseball legends that have also been chronicled on film - along with Jackie Robinson in the film, 42.Directed by Brian Helgeland (The Order), 42 stars Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, a Negro league baseball player that becomes the first African American to play in Major League Baseball.  Signed by Brooklyn Dodger owner, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Robinson works against the racial segregation of the late 1940s and early 1950s in the United States.  Not only does Robinson have to work to overcome the racism of the baseball crowds, he must learn to co-exist with his teammates, coupe with the endless death threats, and prove to doubters that can work his way up from the minors to become an everyday starter in the Major League.  Nicole Beharie, Andre Holland, and Christopher Meloni also star in supporting roles.From start to finish, Chadwick Boseman carries the film on his back as the legendary baseball great, Jackie Robinson.  Boseman manages to leave an everlasting and emotional impression about the difficulties Robinson had to contend with when he entered the major leagues.  In all honesty, it's nearly impossible to imagine having to walk into the fire of Major League Baseball at a time when the idea of an African American playing on the same field as a white man was appalling to the masses.  After time and for the most part, Robinson's teammates grew accustomed to him and eventually accepted him, including his first major league manager, Leo Durocher.  Portrayed by Christopher Meloni, Durocher gives a very moving speech to his players about how their negative (racist) behavior towards Robinson would not be tolerated.  However, the only outstanding inaccuracy from the film also revolves around Durocher and his suspension from baseball - with the film depicting the suspension due to a marital affair, when it really had to do with gambling (sensitive subject, apparently?).Speaking of memorable portrayals, Harrison Ford also brings his A-game to the field in 42.  At this point, it's hard to call anything Ford does a disappointment (even though he's had some easily forgettable roles), but Ford's portrayal of Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey is flat out enjoyable and entertaining.  Ford brings a light-hearted charisma, not to mention a great deal of laughter, as the over-the-top owner, who was looking to make waves in baseball.  While Jackie Robinson did become the first African American to play in the majors, it wouldn't have been possible without owner, Branch Rickey.  Determined to desegregate the game of baseball, Rickey ignored the ""unwritten rule"" of not allowing Negro players in the major leagues, and kick the door open for equal rights in baseball - which is honorably displayed in the film.Falling in love with a film is difficult, but being pulled into a wonderful plot with enjoyable actors is always a treat - especially when biographical films potentially try to re-write history to make it more exciting for the big screen.  With that being said, this film gets history right and honors the acts of both Robinson and Rickey in the process.  42 is a film less about baseball, and more about one man having the desire to prove that he has the right to play baseball.  The baseball diamond is nothing more than a backdrop for this film, with the real emotions coming out in the dugout hallway, locker room interactions, and Rickey's office.  Although, one major scene from the film does take place on the field, which involves the verbal abuse being dished out by Philadelphia Phillies manager, Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk), while Robinson is at bat.Overall, 42 pays homage to the memory of Jackie Robinson - a man that was not only a great baseball player, but was also a role model for everyone.  He displayed tolerance and patience in an unimaginably difficult environment, thus paving the way for the diversity and equality we have in today's world.  This is an absolutely enjoyable film, but it also sends a thematic message about the importance of equality (especially during a time when bullying has become such a hot button issue).Overall Film

Just when we think we have a handle on racism, complete with a Black President etc, the ghosts of the past deny being forgotten. This film hopefully, now on television, will put things back into perspective if just enough people watch. Brian Helgeland wrote and directed a solid hit with a fine cast, but this is a painful film to watch on the one hand, and a celebration of one of the first cracks in the racism veneer of this country.Briefly the story can be summarized as follows: `In 1946, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. To that end, Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League player. As both anticipate, this proves a major challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it.'The supporting cast is strong: the beautiful Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson, Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, Andre Holland as Wendall Smith, and Ryan Merriman, Lucas Black , Alan Tudyk, Hamish Linklater, Brad Beyer, James Pickens Jr. and on and on. At times the direction is lax and the story seems to be sidetracked, but it is the powerful performance of Chadwick Boseman that keeps the spirit of the story vital.

This wonderful movie plays like a dramatic documentary of Jack Roosevelt Robinson's path to the major leagues and into the annals of social/civil rights history. The film, 42: The Jackie Robinson Story features Chadwick Boseman in the title role.  Boseman brings tenderness, strength, enthusiasm and hope to the historical man and presents him as a man who pursued his dream and was willing to play a role in a drama orchestrated by Branch Rickey.  Harrison Ford is amazing as Branch Rickey down to his gravel voice.  The two men bring the love-able losing Brooklyn Dodgers to the forefront by having a previously untried plan to integrate the national game of baseball.  Along the way, they find inner strength, fight society, deal with hate and seek to see this experiment to its end.  This is an amazing drama set against the baseball world of the 1940s.

1600164,A366S12KCZ280V,B009NNM9OA,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 1]","""42: The Jackie Robinson Story"" is a film anyone and everyone needs to see at least once. It is a film that will touch the heart while it brings out in the viewer every emotion there is to have. Yes the movie is about baseball and if you don't like the game please don't let that stop you from watching ""42"" because it is so much more then about that. It is about one man, Jackie Robinson, who had the chance to make a change for the good not only for the game of baseball but for the country as well and for mankind. It would be a terrible burden he would have to take in order to overcome the prejudice and stereotypes that many Americans had about blacks. Not an easy task. But for the benefit of us all Jackie Robinson was up to that task.Of course Jackie couldn't take this on or even start this task without help to get events underway. That help would come from Branch Rickey the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers who had made up his mind he was going to do whatever he had to break the unwritten rule that existed in major league baseball that prevented blacks from playing the game. The unwritten rule first went into effect back in 1887. Until then there had actually been some blacks who played professional baseball in the U.S. until the baseball owners got together and decided to put into place the infamous unwritten rule. What Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey did in 1947 was to help finally break that unwritten rule and open the door for other great black baseball players to come into the major leagues.It would not be an easy door to open as ""42"" shows. Jackie Robinson faced all kinds of discrimination, taunting and ridicule not only from the other teams in the National League but at first from his own teammates as well. It would be brutal what he went through made all the harder by an agreement he made with Branch Rickey that no matter what was done to him Jackie Robinson could not fight back. Rickey knew that there would be many people not only routing to see his idea of intergrading baseball fail but would do what they could to see it fail. That is why he needed the right person to be able to accomplish bringing an end to the unwritten rule. He would find that person in Jackie. Knowing however that those against any black man playing in the major leagues would do all they could to stop that from happening Rickey had to place the stipulation to Jackie that no matter what they said or did to him he could not fight back because to do so would give the opponents the argument they needed to stop the intergradation of baseball.The movie ""42"" not only shows however what Jackie faced on the baseball field but what he faced outside the game as well. Especially what he would face coming to the south for the first time for spring training compared to the more open mindedness towards race he and his wife Rachel knew in California. It also showed what it did to him inside as he faced those taunts and ridicule from people who opposed him simply for the color of his skin. It would effect him greatly but with Branch Rickey's help he would overcome those who opposed him and he would go on to change the game of baseball forever.Jackie Robinson in the movie is played by Chadwick Boseman and gives a brilliant performance. He is totally believable as Jackie Robinson and makes you understand perfectly just what Jackie went through that rookie year of 1947. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey and I rate this one of his stellar performances as an actor. While nowhere near the same as what Jackie Robinson went through Rickey had his own problems to encounter in bringing down the unwritten rule but nothing or no one would stop him. Just as Boseman is believable as Robinson Ford is just as believable as Rickey.The movie itself is wonderfully directed and written to play on all your emotions as you watch it. There are certainly moment that will bring anger forth as you see events that are happening to Robinson as well as pride as he overcomes those same events to some light hearted moments on the screen which are certainly added to help the viewer have some relief from the ugliness being portrayed in the film. Being a fan of the history of baseball as well as a fan of the game itself I was aware of the story behind what took place in bringing Jackie Robinson into baseball before seeing the film and I can say this movie does a good job of showing the events how they happened to be pretty accurate. There were some minor changes here and there for story line purposes I am sure but what you see take place in ""42"" is a good account of just what Jackie Robinson went through including some of the most distasteful things that will make you cringe. From the racial taunting from the Philadelphia Phillies manager towards Jackie to the intentional injury done to Jackie in St Louis by Enos Slaughter these events really happened. Yet through it all Robinson may have bended a bit from all that occurred he never broke and kept his promise he made to Rickey.This is a truly inspirational movie that everyone should see at least once. As I mentioned earlier it doesn't matter if you are a baseball fan or not. In the end this is not about baseball. It is about the courage one man had to face the oppression that existed to bring a change for the better for the country and for all of us regardless of what the color of our skin may happen to be.",5,Much More Then About Baseball,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,5386,"['42', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Story', 'film', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'needs', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'film', 'will', 'touch',

Yes, the Boys of Summer are at it again and this time, I learned a LOT about where American baseball has been and the fundamental changes that have happened in my lifetime. Even though we already know how it ends, thanks to a terrific PG-13 script by Brian Helgeland (Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"") this insight into the Great American Pastime is an excellent reminder of how far we have come, thanks to courageous trail blazers like Jackie Robinson, who integrated professional baseball in 1945 at the instigation of Branch Rickey, a baseball executive who loved the game.We cringe at the language used to attack our hero, we are saddened by the refusal of hotels and restaurants to serve a team that includes a black man, we are enraged by the racist heckling that takes place and we cheer when we see a man quietly rise above the rancor and ""just play ball.""Here is a sample of the (huge) wonderful cast:* Chatwick Boseman (""The Express"" and lots of TV) is heroic as the legendary Jackie Robinson, whose Brooklyn Dodgers uniform boasts a ""42"" on the back. Despite Jim Crow laws, blatant racism and a potential lynch mob, he staunchly maintains, ""I'm just here to play baseball.""* Nicole Beharie (""Shame"") is Robinson's gentle wife, Rachel, who is the calm at the center of his storm. The Robinsons are from Pasadena, so neither of them had ever encountered segregation; they had only read about it.* Harrison Ford (""Ender's Game"" SOON!) is marvelous as Branch Rickey, the man who first brings a black man (Robinson) into Big League Baseball. He pulls no punches when he lays out what is in store for Robinson; he gives excellent advice. He explains that ""God is a Methodist.""* Christopher Meloni (""True Blood"") as Dodger coach Leo Durocher, Jackie Robinson's first defender on the team. He blasts the rebellious Dodger teammates who threaten to boycott until Robinson is fired: ""If Robinson can help us win, then he's gonna play on this ball club.""* Alan Tudek (""Firefly"" and LOTS of TV) as Ben Chapman, the racist Philadelphia coach whose vile heckling of Robinson finally turns the tide. The crowd can't help but sympathize with his victim.* Lucas Black (""Seven Days in Utopia"") playing Southerner Pee Wee Reese, another legend who had to come to grips with his own prejudice. Eventually he tells Robinson, ""Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear a 42 on our uniforms, that way nobody will be able to tell us apart."" (This has become an annual event.)* Hamish Linklater (""Lola Versus"") is Ralph Branca, the teammate who tries to invite Robinson to shower with the team.

Baseball movies are not really about baseball. We know the broad generalities of Jackie Robinson's story & this movie, viewed by many kids across the country in special showings brings his story to a new audience. Racism in baseball was simply a reflection of the larger America. The ignorant players, managers & players were not extremists, many of them not really thinking about racism. They were content to cater to & please white baseball fans.It took Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, & well done by Harrison Ford, to bring MLB, kicking & screaming into a new era. Rickey was no civil rights leader. He was a hard headed capitalist with a instinct for profit. His target: millions of black baseball fans convinced that players in the black Negro leagues were as good, or better than white players. He signed Robinson to a major league contract for the start of the 1947 season. It could have easily blown up in his face. He faced overwhelming resistance from fellow owners, managers, & players who threatened boycott. But he had chosen his man well. In a key scene, Jackie asks Rickey, ""You want someone with the courage to fight?"" Rickey counters with: ""I want someone with the courage not to fight."" Jackie Robinson was a World War II vet, a star athlete at UCLA & was once arrested for refusing to move to the back of the bus. The amazing thing is he did not fight back while being provoked in every major league park he played. I'm an old salt & I flinched at the most arresting scene I've seen in a family movie. During an at bat, Robinson was subjected to the most withering string of racial taunts from Phillies manager, Ben Chapman. It was not a short scene, it continued for some time. I imagined the impression it made on the young kids viewing it from the safety of a darkened movie theater.Production values were excellent & I can see an AA nomination for Harrison Ford.

Chadwick Boseman proves that any newcomer to acting can bring life and a balanced tone to any character and my friends, he does just that with his portrayal as Jackie Robinson. Harrison Ford is my pick for Best Supporting Actor already; he did a supremely fine job playing Branch Rickey. His character wanted things to change for the better, and i admired and appreciated that aspect in the movie. It has been a long time since I last saw Lucas Black in a movie, but he did a great job as Pee Wee Reese. Christopher Meloni(the guy from Law and Order Svu) has a supporting role. The other remaining cast all gave terrific performances. After watching 42, I can say that: Jackie Robinson is one of my heroes. Not just because he was the first African American to play Major League Baseball, but because through all the adversity, name calling, etc. he never gave up. He WAS destined for greatness. Thank god that this movie was made.To close out my review, 42 is the much-needed uplifting, inspiring film that I absolutely can not wait to buy on dvd.

But my baseball heroes were Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins, to me they were always just baseball players, their being black wasn't a factor in either my liking or disliking of them, and ""42"" brings home the truly heroic effort and forces Jackie Robinson had to overcome.""Sports movies"" are best when they're a metaphor for other areas of our lives. ""Field of Dreams"" isn't really about baseball, ""Rocky"" isn't really about boxing, and ""Hoosiers"" really isn't about basketball. What those movies speak to are other forces in our lives that hopefully bring out the best in us, and while ""42"" isn't metaphorical it speaks directly to our views of race and racism.""42"" takes place between 1946 and 1948 when Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) brought Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the Brooklyn Dodgers and integrated baseball. The plot is as simple as that, the story isn't. Robinson was virtually alone, Martin Luther King Jr was still a high school student, Rosa Parks hadn't yet refused to sit at the back of the bus (although Robinson had and was court-martialed for it in the military), those who believed in him were his wife Rachael (Nicole Beharie) and Rickey. Robinson didn't even have the backing of his teammates who started a petition refusing to play with Robinson, slowly Robinson won over their respect. The way Robinson won over their respect, besides being a great ballplayer was to smile while epithets and threats were hurled at him, to get back up after players on opposing teams purposefully injured him. Robinson is a man with a temper but he knows history is watching and whether the integration of baseball happens or not rests on how he acts, and in public he was a tower of strength and ""42"" is brave enough to show Robinson's private moment of doubt and wanting to strike back at his attackers.The cast and acting of ""42"" is superb, Chadwick Boseman resembles Robinson so much the only thing better would have been Robinson playing himself. Boseman exudes Robinson's strength smiling in the face of those who don't want him in baseball while showing the pain that lies just under Robinson's surface. Ford's Branch Rickey is a hero apart from the characters of overt action Ford has played in the past and Ford summon's Rickey's unshakeable faith in the integration of baseball because of his sense of what is right and his religious views make Rickey a pillar against which the waves of racism wash against and try to erode but ultimately fail. It may be to early in the year but this may be a Oscar worthy performance for Ford. Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson is Jackie's pillar of strength, it's a clich&eacute;d role but it is no way clich&eacute;d or rote acting, Beharie conveys the tender support Rachel Robinson did for Jackie and as she still does carrying on his legacy. Christopher Meloni is great as Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and he brings the menace and ultimate authority that Durocher had as a manager, it's a shame history took Durocher out of the game so early in Robinson's story Meloni steals the screen in his scenes. As Durocher's replacement Max Gail plays Burt Shooten, the position and character are place holders in history and the movie, but it's kind of cool to see Max Gail in a film.Today all sports and teams are integrated, all races participate in all sports, we don't even think of it as integration any more, it's just the fact that if you rise to a certain level of achievment you can play professional sports no matter your ethnic background or heritage. There are also reminders for us that ""42"" isn't dead history, throughout the movie we hear the rejoinder of ""this isn't the America I know"" echoes of which we've heard in our recent past. ""42"" even offers a choice, when the Dodgers play in Cincinnati we see a father and son in the stands, the father relating seeing his baseball hero Honus Wagner as a kid, a touching moment that has probably been repeated millions of times in the 100 year plus history of professional baseball. But when Jackie Robinson takes the field the father starts calling him ""n-----"" the son at first looks stunned at the change in his father, then following his father's example starts using the same epithets until his hero Pee-Wee Reese comes up to Robinson and puts his arm around him for all to see and the camera cuts back to the confused look on the kids face, he has a choice to make in life. That is why ""42"" is a special movie that reminds of us a time that wasn't so long ago (well within the confines of a life time) and how we got to where we are, it's a history to remember and not let the forces of ignorance and hate take us backwards.",5,Tale of Real Life Heroism,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,4745,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'were', 'history',

This is how the story goes: In 1946, Branch Rickey put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking -- ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.The cast led by Chadwick Boseman (as Jackie Robinson) & Harrison Ford (as Branch Rickey) is excellent. The directing & screenplay by Brian Helgeland is excellent.The music by Mark Isham is excellent. The cinematography by Don Burgess is excellent. The film editing by Kevin Stitt & Peter McNulty is excellent. The casting by Victoria Thomas is excellent. The production design by Richard Hoover is excellent.

The set decoration by Cindy Carr, set dressings by Dann Brauckmann, Brit Doyle, Sarah Falls, Troy Faruk, Ryan Kutch, Jessica Lang & Andy Rusk, set designs by Danny Brown, Forest P.

The chemistry of the two of them on screen will tug at your heartstrings if not for their talent, but for the abuse and persecution they received in a very dark era of equality in the United States.Now the best performance, although, rough, timid and yet extremely quick witted came from baseball team owner, Branch Ricky, incredible personified by the marvelous talents of Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones, Star Wars). Harrison was amazing to watch and full of conviction with his support of standing out above everyone else and being a leader in integrating colored and white players in the professional leagues.  The camera loves Harrison and as usual, he creates a character with layers and compassion.Many real and memorable performances came from actors like; Christopher Meloni (Oz, Law & Order) as the original coach Leo Durocher.

Pretty much any baseball fan knows that Robinson was the first African-American major league player and sees 42, the jersey number Robinson wore with the Brooklyn Dodgers, hanging among the retired numbers at the baseball stadium. Far too few know the details of how this came about or how much fortitude and forbearance both Robinson and Rickey needed to break something far stronger than a written law--an unwritten social code--and survive 1947.Christian idealism (Rickey opposed racism on religious and moral grounds, even more so after blacks had fought side by side with whites in World War II), good business sense (there were African-American baseball fans to whom the Dodgers could sell tickets, and opportunities to recruit top talent at affordable salaries from Negro League teams) and the desire to make the Dodgers champions motivated Rickey. He selected Robinson from among a number of possible Negro League players based on his combination of baseball talent, relative youth and character. Robinson, a solid family man not prone to vices of drink, gambling or womanizing, had the guts, as Rickey put it, to stand up and stay focused on the game rather than fighting back in the face of the taunting and abuse he would have to endure, not only on the field but in the media and the communities where the Dodgers traveled. ""42"" provides important insight into the tremendous courage it takes to change a culture, especially for today's children who have grown up taking for granted that an African-American can be president.Write-director Brian Helgeland serves up a fast-paced, intense tale of heroism, with many vivid depictions of the virulent prejudice Robinson and his wife Rachel endured, both in the deep south during spring training and in still-tribal cities north of the Mason-Dixon line like Philadelphia. It's not easy to play a saint, but Chadwick Boseman manages to bring warmth, humor, charm, and human vulnerability to his portrayal of the stoic Robinson. Harrison Ford offers a DeNiro-esque immersion performance as Branch Rickey and may net himself his first Academy Award nomination since ""Witness."" Nicole Beharie manages to sparkle in the relatively thankless role of Robinson's supportive wife. Add an enjoyable soundtrack of pop hits from the 40s and 50s and beautiful photography, and ""42"" offers an inspiring, educational, wholly enjoyable night at the movies for the entire family.",5,"Intelligent, Entertaining  Baseball History Drama--Take the Kids",1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2654,"['42', 'wo', ""n't"", 'garner', 'buzz', 'innovative', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'dramatic', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'how', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'General', 'Manager', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'broke', 'color', 'line', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'Pretty', 'much', 'baseball', 'fan', 'Robinson', 'was', 'first', 'African-American', 'major', 'league', 'player', '42', 'jersey', 'number', 'Robinson', 'wore', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'hanging', 'retired', 'numbers', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'Far', 'too', 'few', 'know', 'details', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'much', 'fortitude', 'forbearance', 'Robinson', 'Rickey', 'needed', 'break', 'something', 'far', 'stronger', 'written', 'law', 'unwritten', 'social', 'code', 'survive', '1947.Christian', 'idealism', 'Rickey', 'opposed', 'racism', 'religious', 'moral', 'grounds', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'blacks', 'had', 'fought', 'side', 'side', 'whites', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'good', 'business', 'sense', 'were', 'African-American', 'baseball', 'fans', 'whom', 'Dodgers', 'could', 'sell', 'tickets', 'opportunities', 'recruit', 'top', 'talent', 'affordable', 'salaries', 'Negro', 'League', 'teams', 'desire', 'make', 'Dodgers', 'champions', 'motivated', 'Rickey', 'selected', 'Robinson', 'number', 'possible', 'Negro', 'League', 'players', 'based', 'combination', 'baseball', 'talent', 'relative', 'youth', 'character', 'Robinson', 'solid', 'family', 'man', 'not', 'prone', 'vices', 'drink', 'gambling', 'womanizing', 'had', 'guts', 'Rickey', 'put', 'stand', 'up', 'stay', 'focused', 'game', 'rather', 'fighting', 'back', 'face', 'taunting', 'abuse', 'would', 'have', 'endure', 'not', 'only', 'field', 'media', 'communities', 'where', 'Dodgers', 'traveled', '42', 'important', 'insight', 'tremendous', 'courage', 'change', 'culture', 'especially', 'today', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'taking', 'granted', 'African-American', 'can', 'be', 'president.Write-director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'up', 'fast-paced', 'intense', 'tale', 'heroism', 'many', 'vivid', 'depictions', 'virulent', 'prejudice', 'Robinson', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'endured', 'deep', 'south', 'spring', 'training', 'still-tribal', 'cities', 'north', 'Mason-Dixon', 'line', 'Philadelphia', 'not', 'easy', 'play', 'saint', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'bring', 'warmth', 'humor', 'charm', 'human', 'vulnerability', 'portrayal', 'stoic', 'Robinson', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'DeNiro-esque', 'immersion', 'performance', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'may', 'net', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Witness', 'Nicole', 'Beharie', 'sparkle', 'relatively', 'thankless', 'role', 'Robinson', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Add', 'enjoyable', 'soundtrack', 'pop', 'hits', '40s', '50s', 'beautiful', 'photography', '42', 'inspiring', 'educational', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'night', 'movies', 'entire', 'family']",42

Oleson,"[6, 7]","Appropriately timed for the anniversary of Jackie Robinson's first appearance in a Major League baseball game, the long-in-development movie about the years leading up to it are finally presented.  Robinson is nicely portrayed by Chadwick Boseman who is a dead ringer for the young Jack.  Very convincing as the tough baseball player who must hold back against insults and more, as the first black man to play in the Majors.With equal parts moral justice and economic enhancement, Branch Rickey (superb Harrison Ford), the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers decides it's time to make changes to the roster.  Director and writer Brian Helgeland gives us a couple memorable scenes which do a great job showing the courage of Robinson and others as the idea of blacks playing on the same teams as whites begins to materialize.In a hard to watch scene, the manager of the Phillies (Alan Tudyk) berates Robinson at bat by calling him the full scope of racial epithets.  Jack comes close to losing it, especially when his wife (Nicole Beharie) is included in the insults.  It is also the time when several of Robinson's still biased teammates begin to support him.  The owner of the Phillies also begins to get bad press for being so openly prejudiced.In another scene, the Dodgers are heading to Cincinnati to play.  Kentucky fans are flocking to see their Louisville native, Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black), play.  Earlier Reese had been sent a letter, the writer upset that Reese would play baseball on the same team with Robinson.  When he shows the mildly offensive letter to Rickey, he chuckles and pulls out a file cabinet drawer full of death threats to Robinson and his family.  The scene shows a father and his young son, both espousing the greatness of Reese.  When Robinson is introduced the boy joins his father in boos and racial slurs.  Then Reese walks over to Robinson and puts his arm around Jack and the boy stops and his facial expression changes from anger to acceptance.  Things are beginning to change.The acting is solid by everyone, but Ford's Rickey is truly memorable.  The film does a fine job creating an honest depiction of one of the great heroes in American history.  It does it in a way that will seem familiar with many biopics, however.  Several scenes use swelling orchestral offerings and slow motion trots around the bases, often seen before.

Randall,"[9, 12]","""42"", the story of Jackie Robinson's historic journey to become the first black man to play Major League Baseball in the modern era, is a solid, but strictly by-the-numbers, biopic.  There are definitely some inspired casting choices, such as Harrison Ford as the visionary Brooklyn Dodgers GM, Branch Rickey; Christopher Meloni as the irascible Leo Durocher; and Alan Tudyk has racist Phillies manager, Ben Chapman.  Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie turn in strong performances as Jackie and Rachel Robinson, respectively.Unfortunately, the rest of the film plays like a series of anecdotal snapshots from the Jackie Robinson history that we have all learned throughout the years.  We already know about how Rickey tested Robinson's ability to remain calm in face of the abuse he would face by subjecting him to a racial epithet-laced tirade (though it is portrayed much more tamely in the film); we also know about the racial incidents such as Chapman's vicious racial taunts and Dixie Walker's attempt to rebel against integration; we even know about Pee Wee Reese public showing his support (in the midst of backlash from his own southern hometown) by putting his arm around Jackie Robinson while in the infield before a game.No new ground is broken in this look at Robinson's life and times.  For those who are not very familiar with the story (and baseball's long, troubled history with race), this is a good place to start.",3,"Solid, if unspectacular, account of Jackie Robinson",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1433,"['42', 'story', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'historic', 'journey', 'become', 'first', 'black', 'man', 'play', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'modern', 'era', 'solid', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'biopic', 'are', 'definitely', 'inspired', 'casting', 'choices', 'such', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'visionary', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'GM', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'irascible', 'Leo', 'Durocher', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'racist', 'Phillies', 'manager', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'Nicole', 'Beharie', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'Jackie', 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'respectively.Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'plays', 'series', 'anecdotal', 'snapshots', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'history', 'have', 'learned', 'years', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'Rickey', 'tested', 'Robinson', 'ability', 'remain', 'calm', 'face', 'abuse', 'would', 'face', 'subjecting', 'racial', 'epithet-laced', 'tirade', 'portrayed', 'much', 'more', 'tamely', 'film', 'also', 'know', 'racial', 'incidents', 'such', 'Chapman', 'vicious', 'racial', 'taunts', 'Dixie', 'Walker', 'attempt', 'rebel', 'integration', 'even', 'know', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Reese', 'public', 'showing', 'support', 'midst', 'backlash', 'own', 'southern', 'hometown', 'putting', 'arm', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'infield', 'game.No', 'new', 'ground', 'broken', 'look', 'Robinson', 'life', 'times', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'baseball', 'long', 'troubled', 'history', 'race', 'good', 'place', 'start']",42

Zwick,"[0, 0]","It would be easy to be cynical about a movie like &#8220;42,&#8221; but the best thing about this biopic of Jackie Robinson is that it&#8217;s not ashamed to embrace its own squareness. Indeed, it celebrates it, rendering cynicism a not very viable reaction to it or the people who made it.The movie fits comfortably in the tradition of consciousness-raising social dramas that are often derided by critics as &#8220;Oscar-bait.&#8221; Garnering awards may have been the intention of those who made &#8220;42&#8221; and it may not have been, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter because the movie knows exactly what it&#8217;s doing - and does it beautifully.Robinson was, of course, the Negro League shortstop (later first baseman) handpicked by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey to be the first African-American to play in the major leagues. Though he broke the &#8220;color barrier,&#8221; Robinson never saw himself as a &#8220;hero&#8221; or a historical figure, just a man who wanted to play ball. Like many before him and many since, Robinson never set out to change the world, but he was willing to rise to the challenge when history called upon him to do so.But it was far from a smooth road to victory for the young man. Robinson had to weather stiff opposition from fans, fellow teammates, Jim Crow laws and the sport itself, and all this is captured effectively in the screenplay by director Brian Helgeland, which neither romanticizes the do-goodism of the action nor overstates the struggle just for dramatic effect (we are shown that there were plenty of people - both intimates and strangers, blacks and whites - who were rooting for Robinson to succeed).In a star-making turn, Chadwick Boseman delivers the goods as the young Robinson, a man, we are told, with a sizable temper but who manages to rein in his emotions to an almost super-human degree in order to deny his goading detractors just the opportunity they&#8217;re looking for to bring him down. But amidst a hail of almost nonstop verbal and racist abuse, Robinson retains his dignity by making the bigots look like fools and small-minded bullies in the long run. And it indeed was a long game he was playing, a fact that Rickey consistently reminds Robinson of when things get really bad both on the field and off. And speaking of Rickey, the real scene-stealer of the movie is Harrison Ford playing the gravel-voiced, deeply religious man whose blazing sense of justice and love of baseball converged to alter not only the sport but the world as we would forever after know it.Helgeland has directed the film with solid conviction, often going for the small, intimate moment over the more obvious dramatic confrontation to impressive effect. Helgeland clearly trusts his material and doesn&#8217;t feel the need to shout when a whisper will do. Yet even with all this restraint, what&#8217;s amazing is how shocked we are to realize that all this happened a mere 66 years ago. And to see how far we&#8217;ve come.And special note should be made of the scenes on the diamond, which beautifully capture the look and feel of the era and the pulse of the game.To call this movie &#8220;inspirational&#8221; is not to denigrate it. On the contrary, &#8220;42&#8221; honestly earns every single tear, goose-bump and throat lump it elicits from its audience.

A stunning movie, filled with lots of action and deep emotion. It's truly a frightening eye opener, to see how creepy and racist this country was back then! I'm so glad I never had to experience such a dark and evil time like that in this country! ""Thank God it's a new day"".

1600348,A38X3820MO0TAN,B009NNM9OA,Sony XL,"[1, 1]","At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal that he can't get off.Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says--he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, ""My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,"" she told TMZ. ""I was not raised in that type of home."" How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball",3,42 Errors faces a myth......,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,4182,"['what', 'point', 'film', 'biography', 'become', 'hagiography', 'Yes', 'course', 'know', 'took', 'tremendous', 'courage', 'do', 'what', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'did', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'writer/director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'tries', 'ultimately', 'pit', 'placing', 'legendary', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'pedestal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off.Helgeland', 'well', 'introducing', 'Jackie', 'legend', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'Robinson', 'man', 'really', 'was', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'done', 'perhaps', 'hands', 'better', 'writer', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'leave', 'digging', 'facts', 'who', 'are', 'privy', 'real', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Robinson', 'career', 'interactions', 'amongst', 'players', 'management', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers.Still', 'Helgeland', 'touch', 'basic', 'history', 'what', 'Robinson', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'when', 'entered', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'whole', 'affair', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'virulent', 'racists', 'baseball', 'time', 'was', 'bad', 'publicity', 'press', 'actually', 'got', 'front', 'office', 'Philadelphia', 'Phillies', 'force', 'Chapman', 'publicly', 'act', 'nice', 'Robinson', 'Note', 'Robinson', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'taking', 'picture', 'Chapman', 'holding', 'bat', 'Robinson', 'justifiably', ""n't"", 'want', 'shake', 'hand', 'Chapman', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'what', 'just', 'doing', 'orders', 'bosses', '.Helgeland', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'good', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'one', 'Robinson', 'must', 'suppress', 'rage', 'being', 'taunted', 'Chapman', 'counseled', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'not', 'let', 'racist', 'manager', 'provoke', 'him.Historically', 'Robinson', 'struggle', 'racism', 'epic', 'battle', 'dramatically', 'difficult', 'illustrate', ""n't"", 'one', 'antagonist', 'Robinson', 'must', 'fight', 'exciting', 'climax', 'film', 'end', 'Instead', 'documentary', 'style', ""'re"", 'treated', 'series', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'designed', 'explain', 'why', 'should', 'feel', 'elevated', 'Robinson', 'achievement.Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'fine', 'job', 'Robinson', 'limited', 'script', 'mainly', 'Robinson', 'internal', 'struggle', 'keep', 'lid', 'own', 'justified', 'anger', 'raw', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'illustrating', 'celebrated', 'moves', 'base', 'paths', 'Robinson', 'relationship', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fleshed', 'Robinson', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'interacted', 'life', 'Helgeland', 'Nicole', 'Behaire', 'little', 'do', 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'Robinson', 'devoted', 'wife', 'one', 'wondering', 'Helgeland', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'part.Bill', 'Madden', 'NY', 'Daily', 'News', 'sports', 'columnist', 'points', 'out', 'film', 'full', 'factual', 'errors', 'example', 'Leo', 'Durocher', 'was', 'not', 'suspended', 'marital', 'infidelities', 'gambling', 'also', 'how', 'Robinson', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'walk-off', 'home', 'run', 'opponent', 'home', 'park', 'daughter', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirate', 'pitcher', 'Fritz', 'Ostermueller', 'father', 'never', 'hit', 'Robinson', 'head', 'pitch', 'merely', 'was', 'throwing', ""'brush"", 'back', 'pitch', 'What', 'more', 'insisted', 'dad', 'knowledge', 'was', 'not', 'racist', 'told', 'TMZ', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'type', 'home', 'How', 'much', 'research', 'did', 'Helgeland', 'actually', 'do', 'film', 'Ralph', 'Branca', 'asking', 'Robinson', 'join', 'shower', 'Branca', 'never', 'happened', 'Sure', 'writer', 'can', 'take', 'dramatic', 'license', 'least', 'write', 'something', 'mildly', 'plausible.If', 'want', 'basic', 'history', 'lesson', 'how', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'became', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'first', 'black', 'ballplayer', ""'re"", 'also', 'interested', 'seeing', 'good', 'performance', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Branch', 'Rickey', ""'42"", ""'touching"", 'bases', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', 'nowhere', 'near', 'that.Jackie', 'Robinson', 'early', 'demise', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'tragic', 'was', 'only', '53', 'when', 'diabetes', 'heart', 'disease', 'took', 'life', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'also', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'film', 'fact', 'equally', 'as', 'important', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'great', 'achievements', 'baseball']",42

1600356,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B009NNM9OA,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 2]","I'm not baseball expert. My deepest knowledge of the sport comes from attending a couple of games in-person and watching Ken Burns' awesome documentary. Based on what I learned from that documentary, I wanted to learn more about this chapter of history. And while I don't really have much of an idea about how historically accurate it may be, I do know that it seems to get some of the details and emotion of the story very right indeed.This film chronicles Jackie Robinson's journey as the first person of his background to play Professional Baseball, and if you know ANYTHING about him, baseball, or the prejudices of the era, you know it's not going to be a pretty picture. That's pretty much the story from the get-go. We KNOW from the start, just as Jackie knows from the start, that he is going to have to take more abuse than any reasonable person should possibly undergo in one lifetime. And the picture is not painted rose-colored, in real life or in this picture. According to the documentary Baseball, Jackie became very bitter late in life from the effects of what he endured. I can believe it. My wife said the movie wasn't too rough to watch, but I personally felt a bit traumatized by the end (maybe I led too much of a sheltered life, or maybe i just take these things too personally).The film itself isn't a stand-out for direction, cinematography, music, or anything like that. The film is carried by the strength of the acting all-around. But in particular Harrison Ford gives what is in my opinion his finest performance. He will makes you laugh with his comic timing, but on several occasions during the film my mind's eye imagined a scene I was watching playing before his Academy Award Nomination. When he gives Jackie a speech on the field likening him to a Messiah, telling him that he HAS to do what no one else could, you can feel how deeply he wishes he could take his place on the field and spare him the humiliations and fire of people's hatred. Grand stuff. But everyone else is no slouch either. You may find certain characters to be stand-outs, but I in general found everyone else in the film to be SOLID, giving realistic performances.If you care about this story, this film is a must-see.

1600367,A2LHMP07OFU6JW,B009NNM9OA,Texas Reader,"[6, 10]","I saw this film last night and it was a good film.  For the reasons written below, I cannot call it a great film.They have this loser Ben Chapman in the film.  He was one of the worst trash talkers in the game.  Till the day he died, he never thought his actions were wrong.  You can go online and read the interviews.  What's funny is that I have read in reviews around the net that the Chapman trash talking scene was over the top.  It actually is not.  He was that way. Kudos to the film for not watering him down and showing him for the person he was.What I think the filmmakers should have added is what the stars at the time thought of playing with a black ballplayer.  Ted Williams is portrayed by many in history to support Jackie, however that is not the truth.  In Jackie's book, ""The Way we Were"", he is highly critical of Ted and how he spoke out against him.  To only focus on the Dodgers and his teammates is not enough in my opinion.  It would have been interesting to see what Italian ballplayers thought of him as well as the great Hank Greenberg, who faced antisemitism while he was playing.The film also leaves out a very important topic.  How did Negro League players feel about Jackie being the first? Josh Gibson, the greatest Negro League player of all time, felt slighted that he was not first along with the great Satchel Paige. They felt they were superior to Robinson and that he did not have a spotless record while he was in the military.  The greatest film I have ever scene on this topic is ""Soul of the Game"".  By the way, that film is superior to this one in almost every way.  I highly urge people to watch that film.  It is one of the greatest baseball films I have ever seen.There is one other thing that could have been added to this film.  Yes, he was a guy who had to take the racial insults for a while, however that was not for his entire career.  He actually went on to become a very outspoken person.  It just was not in baseball.  He spoke out in many political venues for the Republican party.  To just portray him as a silent guy really does a disservice to Jackie.  He was an extremely well-spoken ballplayer and was very educated unlike most of his white peers who did not have past a high school education.Overall, I give the film 3 stars.

1600370,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B009NNM9OA,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","""42"" is the story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who, in 1947, became the first African-American baseball player in the major leagues. The movie focuses mostly on Robinson's rookie season with the Brooklyn Dodgers, a year after being signed by team executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford).The partnership between Rickey and Robinson is the most interesting aspect of this otherwise standard sports biopic. Rickey knew that there was a wealth of untapped talent in the Negro Leagues and needed the right man to break the color barrier.  Robinson would be a pioneer, having to endure insults, indignities, and racial slurs without losing his cool -- in other words, a model of calm and reserve whose prowess on the field would eventually earn him the respect of fellow players, fans, and the general public.Boseman resembles the young Robinson but lacks the fire and resolve that drove Robinson to persevere.

1600371,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B009NNM9OA,The People's Critic,"[6, 7]","ilms about sports are as old as the modern screen narrative gets.  It seems most movie fans have a favorite sports movie, even people who hate sports.  The reason for this is that a great sports movie is often not really about the game.  A great sports movie is about life, passion, talent, and determination.  These films strive to inspire, and the great ones usually do.  42 brings the epic story of Jackie Robinson to the big screen, and if you don't tear up at this one, there's something wrong with you.Robinson's story is fairly well-known, especially to baseball fans.  What may be a slightly lesser-known facet of Robinson's story is the role Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey plays in it.  Together Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) and Rickey (Harrison Ford) attack the prejudice inherent in post-WW II America by using America's pastime as a weapon for unity.  This is not unlike the strategic move Nelson Mandela took in terms of using a nation's love for Rugby as an equalizer in post-apartheid South Africa.  The film opens with Robinson already a star of the Negro League.  He is summoned by Rickey to join the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm organization with the expectation that he would be brought up to the majors, breaking the color barrier and becoming the first African-American ever to play major league baseball.  Rickey senses that Robinson is the potential game-changer that he needs because he has both the talent for the game as well as the personal strength to withstand the firestorm that his presence in the majors will inevitably cause.  Rickey represents a dogmatic, purist love for something that has seemingly been soiled.  His motivation is fueled by love and respect  in a time when both of these qualities are in short supply (in terms of race relations).Robinson's story is treated with great respect in 42.  Director Brian Helgeland does not sugar-coat America's racist past, but it could be said that he stereotypes it a bit.  Nonetheless, he uses the game of baseball as a way to survey the various racial perspectives shared throughout different regions and classes in mid-20th century America.  This helps 42 rise slightly above a standard bio-pic into something of an American culture expose.  Robinson is not simply pitted against ""racism.""  He is doubted by timid hypocrites like Rickey's associate Harold Parrott (T.R. Knight).  He is hated by southern simple-folk who are frightened by change like Phillie's manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk).  He is isolated by skeptical teammates who feel under-valued like Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman).  He is also anxious about what his presence means to other struggling African-Americans like journalist, Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) and idolizing child-fan Ed Charles (Dusan Brown).  Robinson's wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) effectively reveals the source of much of Robinson's strength against many of these different and difficult stresses.Consequently,42 is one of the best films of a young 2013, and it is certainly an excellent addition to a long line of great sports movies.  It does rely on stereotype and simplification from time to time, and Robinson is also depicted as a virtually flawless individual.

It also depicts how love and friendship can prevail over hate and bigotry. Most of us know the Jackie Robinson story, and how his courage and poise helped him successfully break the color line in baseball, thus paving the way for the civil rights movement. This film focuses on the period of 1945-47, in which Jackie is sought after by Branch Rickey and eventually gets to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. At no time is Jackie's journey a pleasant one, and this film emphasizes it. Harrison Ford does a stellar job of playing Rickey, who's religious and philosophical, and provides Jackie with a calming presence and guidance. Jackie's wife (Rachel) is played magnificently, as she was always the graceful and strong woman, and keeps his spirits up throughout his turbulent times. This movie isn't top-notch, but still good. It would've been more interesting to have a more comprehensive movie about Jackie, rather than just a two year period, but I understand why it was told that way.",4,"Good Movie, Whether You Know The Story Or Not",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1158,"['42', 'few', 'key', 'messages', 'human', 'race', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'overcoming', 'incredible', 'odds', 'adversity', 'blaze', 'trail', 'common', 'dignity', 'equal', 'rights', 'also', 'how', 'love', 'friendship', 'can', 'prevail', 'hate', 'bigotry', 'Most', 'know', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'story', 'how', 'courage', 'poise', 'helped', 'successfully', 'break', 'color', 'line', 'baseball', 'thus', 'paving', 'way', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'film', 'period', '1945-47', 'Jackie', 'sought', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'eventually', 'play', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'time', 'Jackie', 'journey', 'pleasant', 'one', 'film', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'stellar', 'job', 'playing', 'Rickey', 'who', 'religious', 'philosophical', 'Jackie', 'calming', 'presence', 'guidance', 'Jackie', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'played', 'magnificently', 'was', 'always', 'graceful', 'strong', 'woman', 'spirits', 'up', 'turbulent', 'times', 'movie', ""n't"", 'top-notch', 'still', 'good', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'have', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'rather', 'just', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'told', 'way']",42
1600383,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B009NNM9OA,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Everyone knows that Jackie Robinson was the man who broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, but few know why he was the one that was chosen. Robinson wasn't the best black player out there, he wasn't even a superstar, what he was, was well educated and understood that people attacked him out of fear and ignorance. He never took it personally and knew fighting back would accomplish nothing, and against all odds, no matter what was thrown at him, Robinson was able to brush it off. In 42, he's portrayed by newcomer Chadwick Boseman, who wasn't just fantastic, but also gracious for the opportunity to portray a true American hero. I am a big Jackie Robinson fan and through everything I've seen, Boseman has given the most clear and accurate portrayal of the man to date. His co-star is Harrison Ford, playing the legendary Branch Ricky. Throughout his life, Ricky was outspoken against segregation and didn't just help in breaking baseball's color barrier, eight years later, he broke the Latino barrier as well. What I love about Harrison Ford is that he's so predictable, you know you will always get a tremendous performance out of him and that he will go to extreme lengths to be as real to the story as possible. This film was outstanding, from top to bottom, but my one knock on 42 is that it didn't go beyond the 1947 season. Robinson played for nine years after that and was a key member of the civil rights movement after baseball. I would have liked to have seen how in 1955, at age 36, he led the Dodgers to their only championship in Brooklyn, with an improbably steal of home against the Yankees. I also would have liked to have seen how he became the first black broadcaster, or how he marched with Dr. King in Washington. 42 is one of the clearest, most accurate depiction of two years in the life of Jackie Robinson, and while it was terrific, I would have like to have seen them take it a step further.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1936,"['Everyone', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'broke', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'color', 'barrier', '1947', 'few', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'chosen', 'Robinson', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'black', 'player', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'superstar', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'well', 'educated', 'understood', 'people', 'attacked', 'fear', 'ignorance', 'never', 'took', 'personally', 'knew', 'fighting', 'back', 'would', 'accomplish', 'nothing', 'odds', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'thrown', 'Robinson', 'was', 'able', 'brush', 'off', '42', 'portrayed', 'newcomer', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'fantastic', 'also', 'gracious', 'opportunity', 'portray', 'true', 'American', 'hero', 'am', 'big', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'fan', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Boseman', 'given', 'most', 'clear', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'man', 'date', 'co-star', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'playing', 'legendary', 'Branch', 'Ricky', 'life', 'Ricky', 'was', 'outspoken', 'segregation', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'help', 'breaking', 'baseball', 'color', 'barrier', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'broke', 'Latino', 'barrier', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'love', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'so', 'predictable', 'know', 'will', 'always', 'get', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'will', 'go', 'extreme', 'lengths', 'be', 'as', 'real', 'story', 'possible', 'film', 'was', 'outstanding', 'top', 'bottom', 'one', 'knock', '42', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', '1947', 'season', 'Robinson', 'played', 'nine', 'years', 'was', 'key', 'member', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'baseball', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'how', '1955', 'age', '36', 'led', 'Dodgers', 'only', 'championship', 'Brooklyn', 'improbably', 'steal', 'home', 'Yankees', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'how', 'became', 'first', 'black', 'broadcaster', 'how', 'marched', 'Dr.', 'King', 'Washington', '42', 'one', 'clearest', 'most', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'two', 'years', 'life', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'was', 'terrific', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'take', 'step', 'further']",42
1600384,A4JHEO7H330AF,B009NNM9OA,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","FORTY-TWO is a ""bio-pic"" about baseball legend, Jackie Robinson.  The movie is fast-paced, and there are no sequences near the middle of the picture, where not much happens (as is the case with many other movies).  Despite the fact that sports movies are a popular film genre, this movie manages to avoid cliches.  Every so often, one encounters a movie that has a moment, perhaps occurring at the half-way point, or perhaps near the end, that is compelling in the way it discloses a lesson in morality.  TWELVE ANGRY MEN, with Henry Fonda and Telly Savalas, and MEN OF HONOR, with Cuba Gooding, are two such movies.  In contrast, it is the case in FORTY-TWO that a compelling moment that discloses a gripping lesson in morality occurs at a frequency of every ten minutes or so.This film will be of attractive to folks with the following interests:(1) Baseball.  I think that if I had a knowledge of some of the more technical aspects of baseball, that I would have appreciated this film a tad more.(2) American history.  This film would make an excellent teaching aid for disclosing events in history in the post-WWII era, that is, in the era when the baby-boomers were busily being conceived.(3) Retro from the 1950s.  This film provides excellent visuals of retro trivia, for example, colorful billboards of Schaefer Beer, Mobilgas, Esquire Shoe Polish, Texaco wings logo, Ballantine Beer, Gem Esquire Razor Blades, Buluva watches, and period automobiles.  Some of these products were once icons of the American landscape, but have largely disappeared.  Period urban neighborhoods were reconstructed, and these were also interesting to watch in this film.(4) Profiles in Courage.  I never read Mr. John F. Kennedy's book of this title, but Forty-Two provides an uncompromising lesson in courage.  In fact, courage under fire is the most prominent theme in this movie.  The following are a few quotations, which demonstrate courage, and which demonstrate thoughts of racist aggression. ""I want a player who's got the guts not to fight back"" (said by Rickey); ""If a man's got the goods, he deserves a fair chance. Ma'am.""  (said by municipal worker who, at first seems to be another redneck interested in a confrontation, but surprisingly is one of the enlightened); ""He does not have the ice water in his veins to play big league baseball"" (said by redneck baseball player). ""I don't quit sir"" ""Only on yourself, apparently"" (exchange between two ball players); ""Physiologically they have a longer heel bone, gives them an unfair speed advantage"" (then Robinson bats a home run) ""Was that because of his heel bone was longer?"" (exchange between two journalists); ""leave your hat on the ground, maybe somebody will put some money in it"" (racist baiting against Mr. Robinson); ""Maybe tomorrow we'll all wear 42, that way they won't tell us apart"" (triumphant remark made near end of film); ""you . . . you let me love baseball again"" (Mr. Rickey says this to Mr. Robinson).  This last comment is similar to that in AS GOOD AS IT GETS, where Mr. Nicholson says, ""You make me want to be a better man.""(5) Cinematography.  As is the case with many movies, this film can be used for teaching interesting techniques in cinematography.  For example, in a scene when Mr. Durocher (a married man) is on the telephone, he is busy in bed with his girlfriend.  Branch Rickey is on the other end, and Mr. Rickey quotes from the Bible, relating to all people creating equal.  The phone call is about the issue of Mr. Robinson being allowed on an all-white team.  At the very end of the call, Mr. Rickey quotes another part of the Bible, that teaches against adultery.  This particular technique is repeated again, when Leo Durocher is again on the telephone, and when the call is ended, we hear the sound of a mosquito, and Mr. Durocher quickly slaps his hand in the air and squashes it.  I am not sure what this technique is called, but it could be called, ""The technique of ending a phone call with an amusing non sequitur.""  Another interesting technique in cinematography occurs where Mr. Robinson picks up a newspaper, where the headline declares a victor of the Brooklyn Dodgers.  The camera points upwards, and above Mr. Robinson is an elevated urban train, and in the few seconds of this particular scene, we see a train whizzing by on the overhead tracks.  I am not sure what this technique is called, but it could be called, ""The technique of adding a moving object that is customary for that particular scene.""Conclusion.  This is one of the finest movies that I have ever seen, e.g., because of its portrayal of moral lessons.  But a word of warning  --  the ""n word"" occurs at least 50 times in this movie.  Thus, it is possible that this movie might give some people a headache.  On the plus side, a rewarding aspect of the movie is the turnaround in attitude of one or two of the racist characters.  This sort of turnaround is also brilliantly portrayed in two films starring Cuba Gooding,TUSKEGEE AIRMEN (the film also starring Laurence Fishburne) and MEN OF HONOR.  All of these movies, that is, MEN OF HONOR, TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, and FORTY-TWO, also disclose characters who are life-long devoted racists who become even more racist as the film progresses.",5,A gripping

For over 50 years baseball (like the rest of the country) was a white man's game. After just missing the world series the previous year Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey (Ford) decides to shake up his team, as well as the world by signing the best Negro league baseball player to a MLB contract. For Jackie Robinson (Boseman) it just wasn't as easy as putting on a uniform and playing. As many of you know I am a huge baseball fan and I love true stories so I was very much looking forward to seeing this. Even with my high expectations the movie was still better then I was hoping. Besides the movie being one of the best I have seen in a long time Harrison Ford turns in what I think is the best performance of his career and I don't think an Oscar win for him finally is a stretch. The racism shown in this movie is bad but I'm sure it's not even a quarter of what it actually was. That fact alone makes your respect for Robinson leap up from its already high mark. Even if you aren't a huge baseball fan this is a movie you should see. It's more a movie about the human condition and the limits you can reach if you believe in something. Overall, best movie of 2013 so far and best movie I have seen in awhile. I easily give it an A+.",5,A movie not just about baseball but about the human condition.

1600394,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B009NNM9OA,Turfseer,"[13, 29]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal, that he can't get off.Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says--he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, ""My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,"" she told TMZ. ""I was not raised in that type of home."" How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer in the modern baseball era, and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball field.",2,"Average biopic ably covers Robinson the legend, but not so much the man",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,4280,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', '5.0At', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'biography', 'become', 'hagiography', 'Yes', 'course', 'know', 'took', 'tremendous', 'courage', 'do', 'what', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'did', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'writer/director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'tries', 'ultimately', 'pit', 'placing', 'legendary', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'pedestal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off.Helgeland', 'well', 'introducing', 'Jackie', 'legend', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'Robinson', 'man', 'really', 'was', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'done', 'perhaps', 'hands', 'better', 'writer', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'leave', 'digging', 'facts', 'who', 'are', 'privy', 'real', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Robinson', 'career', 'interactions', 'amongst', 'players', 'management', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers.Still', 'Helgeland', 'touch', 'basic', 'history', 'what', 'Robinson', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'when', 'entered', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'whole', 'affair', 'Ben', 'Chapman', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'virulent', 'racists', 'baseball', 'time', 'was', 'bad', 'publicity', 'press', 'actually', 'got', 'front', 'office', 'Philadelphia', 'Phillies', 'force', 'Chapman', 'publicly', 'act', 'nice', 'Robinson', 'Note', 'Robinson', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'taking', 'picture', 'Chapman', 'holding', 'bat', 'Robinson', 'justifiably', ""n't"", 'want', 'shake', 'hand', 'Chapman', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'what', 'just', 'doing', 'orders', 'bosses', '.Helgeland', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'good', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'one', 'Robinson', 'must', 'suppress', 'rage', 'being', 'taunted', 'Chapman', 'counseled', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'not', 'let', 'racist', 'manager', 'provoke', 'him.Historically', 'Robinson', 'struggle', 'racism', 'epic', 'battle', 'dramatically', 'difficult', 'illustrate', ""n't"", 'one', 'antagonist', 'Robinson', 'must', 'fight', 'exciting', 'climax', 'film', 'end', 'Instead', 'documentary', 'style', ""'re"", 'treated', 'series', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'designed', 'explain', 'why', 'should', 'feel', 'elevated', 'Robinson', 'achievement.Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'fine', 'job', 'Robinson', 'limited', 'script', 'mainly', 'Robinson', 'internal', 'struggle', 'keep', 'lid', 'own', 'justified', 'anger', 'raw', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'illustrating', 'celebrated', 'moves', 'base', 'paths', 'Robinson', 'relationship', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fleshed', 'Robinson', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'interacted', 'life', 'Helgeland', 'Nicole', 'Behaire', 'little', 'do', 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'Robinson', 'devoted', 'wife', 'one', 'wondering', 'Helgeland', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'part.Bill', 'Madden', 'NY', 'Daily', 'News', 'sports', 'columnist', 'points', 'out', 'film', 'full', 'factual', 'errors', 'example', 'Leo', 'Durocher', 'was', 'not', 'suspended', 'marital', 'infidelities', 'gambling', 'also', 'how', 'Robinson', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'walk-off', 'home', 'run', 'opponent', 'home', 'park', 'daughter', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirate', 'pitcher', 'Fritz', 'Ostermueller', 'father', 'never', 'hit', 'Robinson', 'head', 'pitch', 'merely', 'was', 'throwing', ""'brush"", 'back', 'pitch', 'What', 'more', 'insisted', 'dad', 'knowledge', 'was', 'not', 'racist', 'told', 'TMZ', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'type', 'home', 'How', 'much', 'research', 'did', 'Helgeland', 'actually', 'do', 'film', 'Ralph', 'Branca', 'asking', 'Robinson', 'join', 'shower', 'Branca', 'never', 'happened', 'Sure', 'writer', 'can', 'take', 'dramatic', 'license', 'least', 'write', 'something', 'mildly', 'plausible.If', 'want', 'basic', 'history', 'lesson', 'how', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'became', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'first', 'black', 'ballplayer', 'modern', 'baseball', 'era', ""'re"", 'also', 'interested', 'seeing', 'good', 'performance', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Branch', 'Rickey', ""'42"", ""'touching"", 'bases', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', 'nowhere', 'near', 'that.Jackie', 'Robinson', 'early', 'demise', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'tragic', 'was', 'only', '53', 'when', 'diabetes', 'heart', 'disease', 'took', 'life', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'also', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'film', 'fact', 'equally', 'as', 'important', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'great', 'achievements', 'baseball', 'field']",42

1600400,A4YXKE5F62II8,B009NNM9OA,Visual Bureau,"[0, 0]","""42 deals with the story of Jackie Robinson, the first black baseball player in the major leagues. The story itself follows much in the conventions of a TV drama where moments of surprise, shock, sadness, and enlightenment kick into gear in every one of the five acts with some creative licenses from the truth.42, however, manages to make you feel that there is something more to talk about than just the basic story and much of the narrative deals with his conflict to the rest of the world and the trust that his wife and Branch Rickey, a fellow financier of the Dodgers themselves, built to him during the course of this tough journey. Not surprisingly, much of the film also examines the struggle he dealt through being a black sportsman and the continual hurls of racial abuse (stronger language than the f-word, to some) and hate will surely disturb and upset more sensitive viewers. Nonetheless, it is contextual to the plotline and the history of the predicament.Thankfully, 42 doesn't dwell on the negatives but moreover a positive message about resilience and triumphing through adversity in the face of negligence. Christian audiences may also find the film approving with its Methodist characters and discussion about him from above rejecting those who show their hate and ignorance upon others. Its portrayals of famous baseball characters feels genuine and homely and the film does not take too much of a sentimental direction even if it is hinted toward the end and the cinematography is as solid as any film of in the genre should be.A much better sports film than Moneyball, 42 strikes and scores a homerun for this round. Jackie Robinson would be proud but would know the inner struggle even more than many would now.

1600404,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B009NNM9OA,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[35, 40]","42, written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is based on the real-life story of Jack Roosevelt ""Jackie"" Robinson, the first African-American baseball player to play in the major leagues.  Robinson's story is well known to many, but to anyone who isn't, 42 (Robinson's number when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers) will serve to acquaint them with the man and his achievements against the backdrop of the times he lived through.  The cast is excellent and give outstanding performances, particularly when recreating the feel of the times and the way it felt to watch Robinson play.The story begins in 1945, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (a deftly turned performance by Harrison Ford) makes the decision that his team is going to be the first major league baseball team to recruit and field a black player. He takes his time, going over the various prospects with his staff, and finally settles on a short-stop currently playing for a black league team, the Kansas City Monarchs, Jackie Robinson (terrifically played by Chadwick Boseman). The film then follows Robinson's career, starting with his being signed to Rickey's minor-league Montreal Royals for the 1946 season, and then his move up to the big league Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.One of the best things about 42 is that it does show just how racially divided American was in the years following WWII and how openly hostile - and acted upon - the racism was in those days. This is absolutely vital to the film in order to show just how daring - and risky - Rickey's decision was, and how daunting the challenge was for Robinson to was to step up to the plate and face the hostility of not only the crowds but also that of his own teammates as well.As I said, the cast is excellent and there are too many fine performances to list them all. Harrison Ford is visibly having a ball in his best role in years as the garrulous, cigar-chomping but never wavering in determination Branch Rickey. Christopher Meloni (best known from TV's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) delivers in spades as the larger-than-life Dodgers manager, Leo Durocher. And Lucas Black turns in a deft performance as Robinson's Dodgers teammate, baseball legend Pee Wee Reese. Alan Tudyk gets the thankless - but important - job of playing Ben Chapman, the Philadelphia Phillies' manager who openly race-baits Robinson during a game. And to his credit, Tudyk carries it off brilliantly, filling the screen with everything that so desperately needing changing in America at that time. On the other side, Andre Holland's African-American sportswriter Wendell Smith, who has to sit with his typewriter balanced on his knees in the bleachers because they don't allow blacks in the news booth, is there to remind Robinson in his soft-spoken but clear-eyed way that ""This isn't just about you."" And Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson is supportive grace personified as she gives Jackie a calm center to turn to amid the storm swirling all about him.But it is above all Chadwick Boseman's masterful portrayal of Robinson himself that carries the film, from the way in which he brings out the man behind the legend to the way in which he vividly recreates the way Robinson played the game. The scenes where Robinson repeatedly gets the best of one pitcher after another with his visually taunting, hands-twitching stealing of bases are almost worth the price of admission just by themselves.My only complaint is in regard to Helgeland's direction and script.  While there are many scenes and moments in 42 that are beautifully rendered, as a film it feels somewhat choppy, moving in a paint-by-numbers fashion to fill in one episode after the other but with no real smoothness or flow to it.  And too often Helgeland seems to lack confidence in the story, choosing to gild the lily with scenes that are decidedly ham-handed in contrast to the moments of sheer grace that Robinson's story has in abundance. (I swear, some scenes are so heavy-handed one almost expects Keenan Ivory Wayans to suddenly appear on-screen shouting ""Message!"" the way he did in the over-the-top spoof Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood). That said however, please take all this with a grain of salt.  42 _is_ a good film.  It might even be a very good film.  But given the truly history-making nature of the story, and the remarkable performances by the highly talented cast, it could have been a _great_ film. I know that Helgeland has done excellent work as a screenwriter in the past, from 1998's L.A. Confidential for which he won an Academy Award to 2003's Mystic River for which he was nominated, with A Knight's Tale and Payback, which he also directed, in between.  But his record since then has been decidedly spotty, with his only directing credit being the 2003 box-office bomb The Order and writing credits for less than stellar films like Man On Fire, the 2009 remake of The Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, 2010's Robin Hood and Green Zone.  While 42 will hopefully do better than any of those, it unfortunately only seems to continue Helgeland's slump as a writer and/or director.Highly recommended to anyone wanting to know more about a critical era in major league sports and about the men who changed it forever.",4,A great story and outstanding performances but hampered by ham-handed paint-by-numbers directing,1366156800,"04 17,

Despite the fact that such an inspirational tale SHOULD be known and loved by all, part of the reason for the disparity is because the last mainstream-media version of the story was produced in 1950...just three years after Jackie broke the color barrier and starring Mr. Robinson as himself!  Though a nice film in its own right, ""42"" truly captures the poignancy of the story using Hollywood drama.For a basic plot summary, ""42"" recounts how Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), with the help of Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Along the way viewers are introduced to other key players in the Robinson saga including wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie), manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni), and fellow teammates like Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) and Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman).In terms of telling the basics about the Jackie Robinson story, ""42"" is a superb rendition.  All of the important events are touched upon and in their proper places, while even the little details (like what the old-time stadiums looked like) are replicated.  You'll feel like you are truly back in late 1940's America, warts and all.What truly makes this film stand out, though, is the acting from pretty much all the main characters.  Ford especially shines with his spot-on Rickey, while Boseman embodies the courage, grace, and often torment that Robinson perpetuated on a day-to-day basis.  On one occasion, Alan Tudyk (playing a particularly galling opposing manager) shines in his portrayal of the kind of racism that was hurled at Jackie from ballpark to ballpark.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars?  Simplicity.  This is very much a ""by the basics"" type of movie and thus if (like me) you already know the ins-and-outs of the Robinson story, it won't have you thinking about anything new or touch any emotions that you haven't already felt.  This is very much a film for those you know nothing about Robinson.Overall, though, ""42"" is an excellent choice of film-making if only because it revives a subject in desperate need of a face-lift.  The experience can be enjoyed by the entire family (children all the way on up) and pretty much every segment of the population.
