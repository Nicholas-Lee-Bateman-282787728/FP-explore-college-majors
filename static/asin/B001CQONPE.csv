1177288,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001CQONPE,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 4]","It's about time THE BOYS IN THE BAND DVD has been released. Fans can rejoice!Based on the Mart Crowley play, THE BOYS IN THE BAND was such a bold film when it premiered in 1970. The movie was about a group of friends who happen to be gay men, that gather together to celebrate one of their birthdays. As the night progresses--and the booze and the pot flow--the party starts to tailspin downward into a devastating series of events that leave most of the guests emotionally shattered.Each time I watch the movie, it takes my breath away. It's riveting! The dialogue is both caustic and humorous; the acting is top notch; and Friedkin's direction is right on target.And the film looks better than ever on DVD. It's been remastered and there are special features included. I love the pop art cover, featuring each of the ""boys,"" within the subtle colors of the rainbow flag.Anyway, it seems like people either love or hate this movie. If you haven't seen it, I would definitely suggest renting it. This is one of those classic ""gay"" films that are a must have, not because they are gay, but because they're that good.==========SPECIAL FEATURES=========Feature-Length Audio Commentary By Director William Friedkin3 FEATURETTES:ACT ONE--THE PLAY--14-MinutesInterviews with writer Mart Crowley, Executive Producer Dominick Dunne, Actors Laurence Luckinbill ""Hank"" and Peter White ""Alan"" and writer Tony Kushner about the how the play (The Boys in the Band: 40th Anniversary Edition) came about.ACT TWO--THE FILM--24:40-MinutesInterviews with the above people and Director William Friedkin on the making of the film.ACT THREE--40 YEARS OF BOY IN THE BAND--5:30-MinutesLegacy of BITB and tribute to the actors who have passed away.=======================================I wish there was some more special stuff like a deleted scene between ""Hank"" and ""Larry"" where they kiss and makeup after an emotional confrontation, but it's not included. But the DVD is well worth it and fans of the movie will be sure to buy it and put those VHS tapes to rest!",5,FINALLY!!!

1177290,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B001CQONPE,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[5, 6]","THE BOYS IN THE BAND is a handsome DVD transfer of what in 1970 was a controversial play and an even more controversial film.  Tight writing and performances lend a winning integrity to what in many respects is a ""lifeboat"" movie, collecting and then sealing up eight gay New York men, ages roughly 28 - 38, who have gathered one sultry summery night for a birthday party.Like any lifeboat picture each of the cast represents some aspect of gay life, circa late Sixties: the promiscuous high-fashion photographer and his soon-to-be-divorced partner; the birthday boy, a self-described ""thirty-two-year old pockmarked Jew fairy"" (Leonard Frey, whom movie buffs may remember from FIDDLER ON THE ROOF); an African-American book clerk; a rentboy with ""unnatural natural beauty""; nellie Emory; Donald, described as a ""hard-workin' fag who don't owe anybody nothin'.""  Or so he is described as the host, Michael, who is unemployed but lives in a chic co-op and exists on an uneasy juggle of debt, religious devotion and guilt.  Michael gets most of the lines, the witty and the self-loathing included.** PLOT SPOILERS** Before the Birthday Boy himself arrives, his ""present"" shows up early in the form of a hustler -- a real Midnight Cowboy -- in Michael's words ""straight out of a William Inge play."" Into this gay stew comes uninvited Michael's old college roommate, who is straight and (probably) doesn't know Michael is gay. Effeminate Emory (Cliff Gorman, cast against type as a tough-as-nails, in-your-face queen) camps and verbally provokes and lisps the unwelcome ""socialite nun"" into a fit of what back then was called ""homosexual panic"" and now more usually is termed ""homophobia"".  The interloper physically attacks Emory and, to everyone's surprise, draws non-metaphorical blood.Various plot devices are used to keep the chief set, Michael's living room, the focus of attention.  The cast are forced there by a vicious summer rainstorm that destroys all the decorations and most of the appetizers on Michael's terrace.  Later, Michael concocts a paticularly challenging game of truth or dare that keeps the cast around the telephone (I won't elaborate).  William Friedkin, who offers at least a few cogent DVD Commentary remarks about the film he directed, speaks of the difficulties he had in ""opening up"" the play into a film yet retaining the hothouse, claustrophobic element this comedy/drama needed to succeed.When THE BOYS IN THE BAND first circulated theatrically the MPAA gave it an ""X"" rating based simply on its topic, homosexuality; the new DVD gets an R-rating, which is about right for dialog that includes (as so many modern R-rates also do) f-bombs, the s-word and [this will annoy many present-day viewers] much sniping with the misogynistic four-letter ""c"" word.  On the lighter side, lots of quick wit enlivens, the kind that back then was viewed as homosexual irony but today is just ""edgy"" in a post-Seinfeld, self-conscious kind of way. (References to 1940s movie stars will send even sophisticated film buffs hunting for their copy of the Maltin guide.)  The fun, and the real guts this American vanguard of ""out"" gay men show in their lives, are the parts that have worn best and still amuse and enlighten.Are these types stereotypes?  Yes, but to be fair that's inherent in this deliberately claustrophobic sub-genre, which is more based in character development than plot. Did anyone complain when Alfred Hitchcock's film LIFEBOAT was released, during World War II, that the Tallulah Bankhead character was over-the-top outspoken and glamorous, or that the lone German was sneaking precious water?  In BOYS, Birthday Boy tells off Michael for his generally boorish behavior (see my caption above); Michael himself gets the closing, self-loating final speech (""If we could all just not hate ourselves quite so much"").Such negativity was almost enough to sink the film in the eyes of many of the gay male baby-boomers who formed the largest segment to see THE BOYS IN THE BAND back in 1970.  I myself remember that it provoked reactions from ""I don't know those people,"" to ""Why would anyone want Michael for a friend?""  Even the character of Donald, who came closest to a bellwether of ""normality,"" is smart enough to speed-read the novels of Doris Lessing yet works at a crummy job for low wages and is in therapy.To me, condemning this production is more than a little unfair. Mart Crowley's adaptation for the screen is an excellent adaptation of his own play.  Friedkin's directing never fails dramatically (if I wanted to be picky, I would point out an overreliance on the zoom lens for ""tight shots"" but that was part and parcel of Sixties cinematography).On balance and IMHO, BOYS is a excellent film that deserves to be seen, or re-seen. In one sense it is indeed a period piece, but many of its concerns are universal:  the struggle to conform vs. to individuate, the straining against negative stereotypes and assumptions, and indeed, the meaning of honor in an urban gay setting. (In a instance of life imitating art, most of the actors were gay and most lost their agents for insisting on being cast in the film, which was thought by the Broadway and Hollywood establishments of the time to be a real career-killer.)  Many of us will find Emory's in-your-face effeminacy and camping annoying, perhaps insultingly so. But plays without gay characters but with irony, games-playing and scathing wit were already going there: just think of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, Edward Albee's most commercially succesful play, then movie (1966).  I should point out that Michael's guilty ""icks"" are usually counterbalanced by those characters who have found the self-acceptance, and the confidence, to show themselves as they are to the straight world, come what may.The photo transfer works well if not magnificently. I agree that much of Friedkin's DVD Commentary is meretricious, but even here there are some useful nuggets to be mined, such as the role Natalie Wood played in getting this film made.  Thank God this film was made but also thank God it wouldn't be made with nearly so much guilt and insecurity today!Trivia Note: The origin of the title is from 1954's A STAR IS BORN, when Norman (James Mason) urges Esther (Judy Garland) to pretend she's singing at 3:00 a.m., ""just for yourself and the boys in the band.""",5,"""You are a sad and pathetic man, Michael.  You are a homosexual and you don't want to be.""",1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,6360,"['BOYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'BAND', 'handsome', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'what', '1970', 'was', 'controversial', 'play',

1177291,A2AGQHF6JICYZQ,B001CQONPE,Amazon Customer,"[16, 17]","I, as well, eagerly acquired a fullscreen DVD of this film from a VHS master. I discovered this play via the film when I was a teenager. (I had a VERY progressive-minded grandma, for an old-world Russian immigrant, who took me to see it -- and her only question, when it was over, was, ""If you're with people like that, could you be like them?"" I assured her it didn't work like that, which she seemed to need to hear. Over her, happily many, remaining years she could not have been warmer to my gay friends and colleagues.) I thought it was just swell, bought the cast album (which I still own) and while I agree it can be viewed as an artifact of another time, it was pretty powerful stuff for a young and naive straight male to see IN its time, because it was really the first compassionate, coherent mainstream presentation of a subset of society that had otherwise been marginalized, ridiculed, handled dismissively or simply inaccurately. The film is a somewhat darker experience than the play (Friedkin and/or Crowley introduce an unexpected rainstorm into the proceedings, which forces a patio party into the living room where Michael's claustrophobic variation of the Truth game takes place) but it sure is something to experience the energy of those original guys.A good number of the play's original cast (and its director, Robert Moore) did indeed perish of AIDS-related illnesses, as reported here by others, but not all. Cliff Gorman (Emory), married and hetero (whose biggest claim to fame was playing Lenny Bruce in Julian Barry's play LENNY on Broadway, not long after the film of TBITB put him in the public eye), died of non-AIDS related cancer; Laurence Luckinbill (Hank), former husband of Robin Strasser, currently husband to Lucie Arnaz, is very much alive, and has remained active as actor, writer, director and producer (he has played historical figures in one-man shows, some of which he authored, including Lyndon Johnson, Teddy Roosevelt and Clarence Darrow); and Peter (Alan) White (orientation unknown to me) has pretty much never stopped working as a ubiquitous TV character actor.For those interested, Crowley wrote a published and Amazon-purchaseable sequel to this play called THE MEN FROM THE BOYS (in a volume called THE ""BAND"" PLAYS). The sequel is set 30 years later and, though interesting, really depends on your knowing the first play for any genuine impact.",5,There Are Straight Fans Too,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2399,"['as', 'well', 'eagerly', 'acquired', 'fullscreen', 'DVD', 'film', 'VHS', 'master', 'discovered', 'play', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'had', 'VERY', 'progressive-minded', 'grandma', 'old-world', 'Russian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'took', 'see', 'only', 'question', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'was', ""'re"", 'people', 'could', 'be', 'assured', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'seemed', 'need', 'hear', 'happily', 'many', 'remaining', 'years', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'warmer', 'gay', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'swell', 'bought', 'cast', 'album', 'still', 'own', 'agree', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'artifact', 'time', 'was', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'young', 'naive', 'straight', 'male', 'see', 'IN', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'compassionate', 'coherent', 'mainstream', 'presentation', 'subset', 'society', 'had', 'otherwise', 'been', 'marginalized', 'ridiculed', 'handled', 'dismissively', 'simply', 'inaccurately', 'film', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'experience', 'play', 'Friedkin', 'Crowley', 'introduce', 'unexpected', 'rainstorm', 'proceedings', 'patio', 'party', 'living', 'room', 'where', 'Michael', 'claustrophobic', 'variation', 'Truth', 'game', 'place', 'sure', 'something', 'experience', 'energy', 'original', 'guys.A', 'good', 'number', 'play', 'original', 'cast', 'director', 'Robert', 'Moore', 'did', 'indeed', 'perish', 'AIDS-related', 'illnesses', 'reported', 'here', 'others', 'not', 'Cliff', 'Gorman', 'Emory', 'married', 'hetero', 'biggest', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'playing', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Julian', 'Barry', 'play', 'LENNY', 'Broadway', 'not', 'long', 'film', 'TBITB', 'put', 'public', 'eye', 'died', 'non-AIDS', 'related', 'cancer', 'Laurence', 'Luckinbill', 'Hank', 'former', 'husband', 'Robin', 'Strasser', 'currently', 'husband', 'Lucie', 'Arnaz', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'remained', 'active', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'played', 'historical', 'figures', 'one-man', 'shows', 'authored', 'including', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'Peter', 'Alan', 'White', 'orientation', 'pretty', 'much', 'never', 'stopped', 'working', 'ubiquitous', 'TV', 'character', 'actor.For', 'interested', 'Crowley', 'wrote', 'published', 'Amazon-purchaseable', 'sequel', 'play', 'called', 'THE', 'MEN', 'FROM', 'THE', 'BOYS', 'volume', 'called', 'THE', 'BAND', 'PLAYS', 'sequel', 'set', '30', 'years', 'later', 'interesting', 'really', 'knowing', 'first', 'play', 'genuine', 'impact']",N/A

1177297,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B001CQONPE,Charles S. Houser,"[4, 5]","At long last, Mart Crowley's ""The Boys in the Band"" is available on DVD (I can finally discard the VHS tape I have held onto for so long fearing it would warp or degrade over time). The play the film was based on was penned just over forty years ago, and the film was released thirty-eight years ago. Because the camera work, direction, and acting are so contemporary in feeling the film sometimes feels like it was made yesterday. But then, as I was watching it and enjoying it, I realized that when I saw the movie when it first came out I was about half the age of most the characters; now I'm twice their age!The film is remarkable on a number of levels. First, this story about a group of gay men was brought to the stage just a year before the Stonewall riots in New York, when the gay community led by its most frequently maligned subgroup (the drag queens) openly rebelled against police harassment, a rebellion that ushered in the gay liberation movement. Most large cities today have Gay Pride parades and celebrations in late June marking this historical event. Even with backlash from the religious right, Western society in general has continued to move in an increasingly tolerant direction. So it may be hard for younger people, or indeed, for anyone who has come of age since Stonewall, to identify or accept the level of paranoia, bitterness, and self-loathing the characters in this film sometimes display. But, allowing for the theatrical device of exageration, these characterization reflect a reality that existed. And, as anyone who came of age prior to Stonewall can attest, Crowley does a good job of capturing the compensating loyalty and humor upon which gay men (the film, alas, only tells the male side of the pre-Stonewall era) relied for coping in a hostile world. After Stonewall there was a period when ""Boys in the Band"" fell out of favor and was unjustly accused of perpetuating stereotypes. (Crowley himself has gone on record as apologizing for the play's depiction of the self-loathing homosexual. In the featurettes included on the DVD,however, he seems to have moved beyond his earlier embarrassment and is again taking pride in his materpiece.)Another thing that makes this film remarkable is that the producers refused to replace the original off-Broadway cast with big name Hollywood stars. Also, director William Friedkin resisted the temptation to ""open up"" the play for the screen. (Anyone who has seen both the brilliant off-Broadway stage production of ""Steel Magnolias"" and the banal film version should give a big ""thank you!"" for this.) Without statically filming a staged production of the play (and by taking full advantange of the skills of DP Arthur Ornitz), Friedkin was able to exploit the claustrophobia and building tension of nine people trapped in the birthday party from hell. (In fact, the only scenes shot outside of host's apartment are the character-establishing shots of each of the party guests leaving his adaptive environment in New York City and making his way to the party. These accompany the opening credits and are a luscious and all-too-brief reminder of what New York was like in the good old days.)The film has also been criticized for being too vicious, with the characters being much too hell-bent on tearing one another down. But to these critics I would respond that ""Boys in the Band"" is a late example of a well-established trend in 1960s theater (consider, for example, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and ""The Lion in Winter""). This mean-spiritedness is the shadow side of the much-touted American optimism and I think it has as much to do with the American culture's emergence from the buttoned-down 1950s as with anything specifically attributable to closeted gays. It wasn't just gay men who were learning (albeit imperfectly and ineptly) to express themselves in the 1960s--it was everybody. This mean-spiritedness has its roots in post-WWII playwrights Miller and Williams and its successors in Shepherd and Mamet. Its causes and effects are clearly something worth depicting and thinking about.The DVD includes three excellent featurettes (Act One: The Play; Act Two: The Film; Act Three: 40 Years of Boys in the Band) which include interviews with Crowley and Friedkin as well as the two surviving members of the cast (Laurence Luckinbill and Peter White). The director's and screenwriter's commentary is a little less gratifying (both Friedkin and Crowley speak at length on a number of interesting issues, much of which was also used to create the featurettes and consequently not new information after you've watched the featurettes. Also, Friedkin's and Crowley's comments come from separate interviews so there is no interaction between these two men who obviously respected each other and enjoyed working together. Crowley's comments on Natalie Wood's support and friendship were especially interesting and worth hearing.) But all in all, the DVD producers have done an excellent job of packaging and presenting a groundbreaking and compelling work.",5,Turning ...

Back then it had that off-putting unpleasantness that repels you when you're pelted with too much information about people, language and customs that are weird and foreign.  At the same time its display of a neat sociological spectrum of gay types was stagey and obvious.  I expected things to get a lot creepier - kissing, perhaps - so I turned it off.I should have left it on because the story is manifestly about universals, not the specifics of gay culture.  It gets to this point through a kind of gay over-exposure, and I'll bet the author was keenly aware of how this would deliver the audience to an unexpected destination.  The limp-wristed flailing of the queerest character had nowhere to go after two or three cringe-inducing lines, and every possible synonym for gay is flung out for our edification.  This seems very dated in its pushiness, but at the same time it quickly brought me the feeling that I sort of knew these people.  After cycling through every possible variety of cattiness or kindness between every combination of characters, it finally precipitated a dramatic movement with something important to say.The way it culminated was ingenious and moving, even if I saw it coming about ten seconds before the big gasp.  If a clumsy line had telegraphed this possibility, say, a minute or two too soon the revelation would have been corny.  In the theater (which is where I wish I could have experienced this) the immediacy of live actors would likely have prevented even ten seconds of prescience.  This moment was the work of a very skilled writer.However, despite its strong resolution, the build-up was awfully repetitive.  The bitchy comments were too clever by half, too on-the-nose and too frequent.  Even in 1968 a thoroughly gay audience must have groaned at a lot of this.The most dating aspect of this play/film is the absence of any discussion or worry about AIDS.  Sex is either flippant or funny or an obvious concomitant of the melodrama of straight sex.  It's never scary or foreboding in a life-or-death sense, but only difficult and maddening in a happy-or-despairing sense.  Somebody might at least have mentioned the inconvenience of herpes or gonorrhea.The documentary features are excellent.  Interviews with Crowley, Friedkin and two actors give a lively historical context to the production of the play and the film.  They are honest about the film's outdated aspects but also generously enthusiastic regarding its lasting dramatic and cultural impact.Wikipedia says that five of the six gay actors have died of AIDS, a cruel fact that went unmentioned in the respectful but brief dedications at the very end.",5,Dated but Universal,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2750,"['remember', 'seeing', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'maybe', 'late', 'seventies', 'Back', 'then', 'had', 'off-putting', 'unpleasantness', 'repels', 'when', ""'re"", 'pelted', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'people', 'language', 'customs', 'are', 'weird', 'foreign', 'same', 'time', 'display', 'neat', 'sociological', 'spectrum', 'gay', 'types', 'was', 'stagey', 'obvious', 'expected', 'things', 'get', 'lot', 'creepier', 'kissing', 'perhaps', 'so', 'turned', 'off.I', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'story', 'manifestly', 'universals', 'not', 'specifics', 'gay', 'culture', 'point', 'kind', 'gay', 'over-exposure', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'author', 'was', 'keenly', 'aware', 'how', 'would', 'deliver', 'audience', 'unexpected', 'destination', 'limp-wristed', 'flailing', 'queerest', 'character', 'had', 'nowhere', 'go', 'two', 'three', 'cringe-inducing', 'lines', 'possible', 'synonym', 'gay', 'flung', 'out', 'edification', 'very', 'dated', 'pushiness', 'same', 'time', 'quickly', 'brought', 'feeling', 'sort', 'knew', 'people', 'cycling', 'possible', 'variety', 'cattiness', 'kindness', 'combination', 'characters', 'finally', 'precipitated', 'dramatic', 'movement', 'something', 'important', 'say.The', 'way', 'culminated', 'was', 'ingenious', 'moving', 'even', 'saw', 'coming', 'about', 'ten', 'seconds', 'big', 'gasp', 'clumsy', 'line', 'had', 'telegraphed', 'possibility', 'say', 'minute', 'two', 'too', 'soon', 'revelation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'corny', 'theater', 'where', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'immediacy', 'live', 'actors', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'prevented', 'even', 'ten', 'seconds', 'prescience', 'moment', 'was', 'work', 'very', 'skilled', 'writer.However', 'strong', 'resolution', 'build-up', 'was', 'awfully', 'repetitive', 'bitchy', 'comments', 'were', 'too', 'clever', 'half', 'too', 'on-the-nose', 'too', 'frequent', 'Even', '1968', 'thoroughly', 'gay', 'audience', 'must', 'have', 'groaned', 'lot', 'this.The', 'most', 'dating', 'aspect', 'play/film', 'absence', 'discussion', 'worry', 'AIDS', 'Sex', 'flippant', 'funny', 'obvious', 'concomitant', 'melodrama', 'straight', 'sex', 'never', 'scary', 'foreboding', 'life-or-death', 'sense', 'only', 'difficult', 'maddening', 'happy-or-despairing', 'sense', 'Somebody', 'might', 'least', 'have', 'mentioned', 'inconvenience', 'herpes', 'gonorrhea.The', 'documentary', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'Interviews', 'Crowley', 'Friedkin', 'two', 'actors', 'give', 'lively', 'historical', 'context', 'production', 'play', 'film', 'are', 'honest', 'film', 'outdated', 'aspects', 'also', 'generously', 'enthusiastic', 'regarding', 'lasting', 'dramatic', 'cultural', 'impact.Wikipedia', 'five', 'six', 'gay', 'actors', 'have', 'died', 'AIDS', 'cruel', 'fact', 'went', 'unmentioned', 'respectful', 'brief', 'dedications', 'very', 'end']",N/A

It's an amazing realistic depictions of a painful, harsh, cruel world--the world of a group of pre-Stonewall (and thus pre-AIDS) gay men in New York City.  They are hurt, damaged, raging, hyper-sexualized, insecure, and to varying degrees out of the closet.  They despise the straight world--yet often struggle to emulate it.  They despise themselves--yet so easily and comfortably torture each other verbally and emotionally--in the most vicious of ways.  They are brilliant and witty--yet adolescent in their genius.  They are competitive and nasty--yet also desperate for each other's love.  They wield thick and powerful facades--yet have an amazing capacity for dropping their guards and being honest.It's not an easy movie to watch--because of the overt expressions of internalized homophobia and cruelty--but, damn, this movie is brilliant.  And what's most amazing about it to me is that although the movie is dated in some ways (it originally came out in 1970), it's shocking how little has changed.  How many gay men still have radical internalized homophobia, still have terror coming out of the closet, still marry women and have kids because they can't handle the rejection of their family and friends and disturbed society, still act out sexually in the worst of ways despite the risks and the horror, still abuse external substances to deal with their internal pain, still wish they were straight, still try to dissociate through religion, still play the camp game to defend against their self-hatred, and still despise and torment other gay men even worse, half the time, than do straight people.Our world, both gay and straight, still has a lot of growing up to do, and that fact that so much has stayed the same in over forty years should be one hell of a wake-up call.",5,"A painful, immature world--portrayed brilliantly",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1852,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'time', 'did', 'disappoint', 'amazing', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'painful', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'world', 'world', 'group', 'pre-Stonewall', 'thus', 'pre-AIDS', 'gay', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'hurt', 'damaged', 'raging', 'hyper-sexualized', 'insecure', 'varying', 'degrees', 'closet', 'despise', 'straight', 'world', 'yet', 'often', 'struggle', 'emulate', 'despise', 'yet', 'easily', 'comfortably', 'torture', 'other', 'verbally', 'emotionally', 'most', 'vicious', 'ways', 'are', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'yet', 'adolescent', 'genius', 'are', 'competitive', 'nasty', 'yet', 'also', 'desperate', 'other', 'love', 'wield', 'thick', 'powerful', 'facades', 'yet', 'have', 'amazing', 'capacity', 'dropping', 'guards', 'being', 'honest.It', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'overt', 'expressions', 'internalized', 'homophobia', 'cruelty', 'damn', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'what', 'most', 'amazing', 'movie', 'dated', 'ways', 'originally', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'shocking', 'how', 'little', 'changed', 'How', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'still', 'have', 'radical', 'internalized', 'homophobia', 'still', 'have', 'terror', 'coming', 'closet', 'still', 'marry', 'women', 'have', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'rejection', 'family', 'friends', 'disturbed', 'society', 'still', 'act', 'out', 'sexually', 'worst', 'ways', 'risks', 'horror', 'still', 'external', 'substances', 'deal', 'internal', 'pain', 'still', 'wish', 'were', 'straight', 'still', 'try', 'dissociate', 'religion', 'still', 'play', 'camp', 'game', 'defend', 'self-hatred', 'still', 'despise', 'torment', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'even', 'worse', 'time', 'do', 'straight', 'people.Our', 'world', 'gay', 'straight', 'still', 'lot', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'stayed', 'same', 'forty', 'years', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'hell', 'wake-up', 'call']",N/A

They are all very comfortable with the material and I cannot imagine another cast. I am so thrilled that this is comming out on DVD and has been restored by William Friedkin himself.

Originally written and produced before the Stonewall Riots that shaped the gay rights movement of the 1970s, the play transposes the psychology-heavy drama of Edward Albee, Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neill, et al. into a gay milieu, albeit into the catty, queeny world of the pre-gay-lib era.Within the LGBT world, the film is controversial due to the lacerating self-loathing seen in and among many of the principal protagonists, and the perception that the characters are simply a stable of gay stereotypes. The negative psychological portraits are as much a product of the genre (intellectualized 1960s stage plays) as they are a critique or caricature of gay culture, and the stereotypes, such as they are, exist in part because of the truth they evoke.(Indeed, if you read some of the negative reviews on this film on Amazon, you'll find that they seem to be from younger viewers, who came of age in the 1980s, '90s and '00s, when gay culture was considerably less conflicted and immeasurably more free than in the earlier era when so many strides were made -- these viewers seem to have little empathy for or knowledge of what life was like before LGBT lifestyles became so much a part of the mainstream. Without an appreciation for the stifling conditions of the Mattachine Society era, they feel free to condemn this film, which seems like a relatively honest, if hyperbolic, presentation of life as it was, several decades ago.

However, it is done extraordinarily well too in places and that makes it worth getting. Leonard Fry's performance as the birthday boy is truly superb for the precision with which he (and not without provocation), dispenses his character's venom and drives the knives in. He is ironically very likeable for it because in doing so he stoically confronts the ghosts in his own character and those which his guests will not face in theirs.",4,Worth Getting,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,746,"['plot', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'birthday', 'party', 'where', 'skeletons', 'begin', 'fall', 'closet', 'alcohol', 'pot', 'begin', 'pry', 'doors', 'open', 'Originally', 'stage', 'production', 'doubt', 'fiendishly', 'difficult', 'piece', 'perform', 'such', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'However', 'done', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'too', 'places', 'worth', 'getting', 'Leonard', 'Fry', 'performance', 'birthday', 'boy', 'truly', 'superb', 'precision', 'not', 'provocation', 'character', 'venom', 'knives', 'ironically', 'very', 'likeable', 'doing', 'so', 'stoically', 'ghosts', 'own', 'character', 'guests', 'will', 'not', 'face']",N/A

1177307,A9I40WFF40R4,B001CQONPE,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 3]","I have seen ""The Boys In The Band"" three times and am glad it is now available on DVD. Practically everyone has an opinion about the movie, and the emotions are never lukewarm. It has been scorned by some gay activists as being politically incorrect, not positive about gay people, homophobic, etc., etc., etc. It is best understood if you look at the time it was produced (1970) and consider what the terrain was like for gays during that time. The Stonewall Riots occurred in 1969 in New York when a group of drag queens said enough was enough to police brutality and fought back. A novel like Gordon Merrick's THE LORD WON'T MIND (1970) was being touted by its publisher as a book about gay people that has a happy ending, i.e., no character gets killed or commits suicide. The police routinely raided gay bars-- in the provinces things were a lot worse than in big cities like New York-- and gay people went to bars often under the cover of darkness. Psychiatrists-- at least some of them-- still believed that homosexuality was a sickness, sex betweeen two members of the same sex was a crime in every state except Illinois, and churches preached that homosexuality was a sin. Gay people lost their jobs if there was a rumor that they were homosexual; they would have been evicted-- and still can be in Georgia-- from an apartment if a landlord thought thought they were gay. Given this climate-- and yes, he certainly is a mess-- perhaps we can cut a little slack for Michael (Kenneth Nelson), the recovering alcoholic who unravels in this movie set in the 1960's. He and the eight other characters in this film version of Malcolm Cowley's off-Broadway play spend an evening together celebrating the birthday of Harold (Leonard Frey) who makes an entrance, by the way, rivaled by none; Also in attendance are Emory (Cliff Gorman), the flaming interior decorator; Michael's friend Donald (Frederick Combs) who is straight out of ""After Dark,"" a popular magazine at the time, in his attire; Bernard (Rueben Greene), the token black gay friend; the soon-to-be divorced teacher Hank (Laurence Luckinbill); his lover Larry (Keith Prentice) who has difficulty being monogomous; Alan, Michael's so-called straight friend (Peter White); and Harold's birthday gift of the evening Cowboy (Robert La Tourneaux.)I admit that I saw glimpses of some of my friends and me as well as considerably more than a glimpse of some of the people I have known in these characters. At the time I owned a purple sweater like Michael's that I purchased on credit and still have that same poster of Marlene Dietrich somewhere in my attic. I also was at a party in Atlanta in about 1972 when a straight neighbor showed up uninvited-- I suppose he had heard the noise-- only to find two of the men at the party in matching kaftans dancing together. A lot of us have known someone like Emory-- one friend from that era said that ""Mary"" is a boy's name; and on a more positive note, I knew at this time a man who left his wife for the man who became his lover and they are still together.Of course these men are in the closet-- were not many of us then?-- and find it difficult to feel good about themselves. On the other hand, there is a resilience about them-- after a really harrowing evening when the characaters act like Edward Albee's George and Martha when the party gets mean rather quickly-- no one kills himself or anyone else, and each of them will pick himself up in the morning and, in the words of T. S. Eliot, put on a face to meet the faces. So before there was ""Brokeback Mountain"" and dozens of other movies that portray gay people in a positive light, there was ""The Boys In The Band."" And, yes, we have come a long way when Barney Frank can speak openly of his partner in the halls of the U. S. Congress. But with all the things that may make you cringe in this film, if you were not alive when it was released, you will have difficulty understanding what it meant to  those of us who saw it for the first time. Here was a movie written by a gay man  about gay characters where gay men were willing to play those gay characters, something that was totally unheard of in 1970. You can hardly expect the characters to be signing up for domestic partner benefits.Included with the DVD are interviews with the writer Malcolm Cowley, the director William Friedkin who directed ""Cruising,""-- not my favorite movie on earth-- Tony Kushner of ""Angels in America"" fame as well of two of the surviving members of the cast.

I get more out of it each time.Sadly, most of the cast is no longer with us:Robert La Tourneaux passed away June 3, 1986. AIDS. Age: 46.

The vocals can be heard inCasino Royale (1968) [HD].All men should see this film.The DVD version offers a beautiful, fresh print of the movie in brilliant colors. Much more superior than any horrible VHS print or broadcast television print.Any broadcast version you may have seen has only shown it in its edited-down version.This DVD version includes the shocking language of 1970, but now all too commonly used in the 2010's.Special Features: Interviews with Mart Crowley, William Friedkin, Laurence Luckinbill and Peter White.There is no mainstream film about male friendship/relationship so deep and well-written.

1177309,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B001CQONPE,James Morris,"[195, 196]","I have been waiting for this film on DVD for years; apparently the people at the studio have no idea how important a piece of gay history this film really is.There is no denying that Boys in the Band is controversial.  Among gay men, it seems to provoke either fierce defense or intense outrage.  Indeed, there seem to be just as many people who praise it for its honesty, humor and status as a ground-breaking film, as there are people who condemn it for its stereotypes and self-hating negative images.  There seems to be no middle ground.  Many people who know me well might be surprised to find that I am one of its defenders.Although I was only 16 years old in 1970, I was already totally ""out"" as a gay person in most aspects of my life.  As such, I had heard about this film (but couldn't get in to see it) almost as soon as it came out.  But you can bet I acquired a copy of the play shortly thereafter, and what I found thrilled me.  Yes, ""thrilled"" is the only way to describe my initial reaction to The Boys in the Band.  I guess when you're used to being totally ignored, having your life acknowledged, even in a negative way, can be surprisingly positive.First of all, BITB was the first mainstream Hollywood film whose main subject matter was homosexuality; that in itself was a giant step forward.  In 1970, depictions of gay men in Hollywood movies were unheard of, unless we were presented as swishy stereotypes or evil predators.  And yes, that's precisely what the controversy is about - back in 1970, as today, many gay men felt that Boys in the Band presented nothing more than a rehash of the same, tired stereotypes that Hollywood had been foisting on us for years.  But I am not at all sure that I agree.After a superficial look, you will find that The Boys in the Band contains several characters that do not fit the description of stereotypes or negative portrayals.  In fact, if one overlooks the characters of Michael (self-hating, bitchy, self-destructive) and Emory (swishy, swishy, SWISHY) the characters in Boys in the Band are about as positive as one could expect for 1970.  And for all his limp-wristed excess, the character of Emory is ultimately presented as forthright, honest and tough.  For several years following the birth of gay liberation, a lot of gay men wanted to pretend that people like Emory didn't exist.  Now we know - or should know, anyway, that some people (even some straight people) don't fit the mold of what society has come to expect from their born gender.  Aren't we supposed to be enlightened enough to know that people have the right to be who they are?  Yes, there are gay AND straight men who are every bit as effeminate as Emory.  I have met quite a few of them in my day.  So what?As for the character of Michael, a lot of us seem to forget what it was like in those days.  In the Pre-stonewall world of the 1960's when Boys in the Band was written, many gay men swallowed the heterosexual propaganda that gay people were mentally ill, unstable, and just plain weird.  In fact, early homophile meetings were often consumed by debates on whether or not the psychiatric community was correct in labeling us as sick.  It should therefore not be surprising that yes, some of the dialogue in Boys in the Band is certainly outdated; thank goodness gay men no longer waste time on endless analysis, absorbing psycho-babble about why we are ""that way"", and wasting even more time re-hashing and debating the same drivel with their friends in an efforts to justify our existence.  But in 1970, we DID debate these things, and we DID think that way, because mainstream society spent so much time cramming us into closets and demonizing our very existence.  But we had to start somewhere, and if nothing else, The Boys in the Band is a startling reminder of how far we've come.  Up until the time the film was released (and to some extent, even today) much of the heterosexual world tried to convince us that we are deranged, child-molesting sociopaths, hell-bound and totally immoral.  And guess what?  Far too many of us listened to the lies, and a great many of us were damaged by it.  These are the roots of internalized homophobia, and the characters in The Boys in the Band are, in a very real sense, accurate depictions of the results of decades (if not centuries) of society-sanctioned homophobia.  At the time the play was written, there were a lot of gay men who did resemble the characters in it (I know; I was one of them).  Rather than being embarrassed at the mess society wrought on some of our psyches, we should be proud that so many of us have been able to overcome decades of repression.And the most important underlying theme in The Boys in the Band is frequently overlooked by its critics.  Michael's closing speech in the play, ""If only we could learn not to hate ourselves quite so much"" is a powerful indictment and, dare I say, revolutionary rebuttal to the self-absorbed indifference that characterized much of the gay community prior to 1970.  And the overall message (which I heard loud and clear in 1970) is that we (gay men) must realize that we are not the sickos that some portions of society wants us to think we are, and we must come to terms with exactly who we are without reservation before we can ever hope to make any progress.In the end, I know this much - I saw the off-Broadway revival of the stage version of The Boys in the Band in 1996, and the audience was composed almost entirely of gay men.  The laughter was loud and frequent, and the abundant applause made it clear that many in the modern gay audience recognized themselves or their friends among the characters presented, even if only as pieces of nostalgia.

1177310,A106016KSI0YQ,B001CQONPE,Jay Dickson,"[2, 3]","William Friedkin's 1970 adaptation of THE BOYS IN THE BAND preserved so much of the original Mort Crowley play that it's almost a filmed testament of that incredibly important off-Broadway play about a group of gay men at a birthday party. Except for the fascinating credits sequence, which opens out the play to the rest of New York as the men travel through Manhattan to prepare for the party, the entirety of the film is confined to Michael's city apartment and its patio (which were owned in real life by the Broadway actress Tammy Grimes), which allows Friedkin to retain the play's overheated atmosphere. Crowley also did the screenplay, and kept almost all of his lines from the play; best of all, Crowley insisted the film retain the excellent cast of nine men who performed the play off-Broadway and who all did themselves honor here with their layered performances. So it's as exact a realization of the play as one might hope for, yet the actors scale down their performances for the screen quite adeptly and Friedkin imagines to make the film quite cinematic, as when the bizarre character of Harold, the party's birthday boy, makes his showstopping entrance halfway through the movie: Friedkin introduces him by closeups on his shoes, ring and velvet jacket, which arrests the whole proceedings and alerts you to how important and powerful this character is going to be to the rest of the film.This is a landmark gay film, and was greatly criticized during the Eighties as retrograde and weakening for the gay cause; even today many gay men will complain about this film and object that it portrays gay men as self-loathing and cruel, and that it shows nothing of the more positive aspects of the late twentieth-century American gay community. Yet other gay men have argued that it shows an important side of who urban American gay men not only were in the years before Stonewall (the film is set in 1967) but even since. The fact that it can generate such controversy was part of Crowley's clear original intention, and part of the intelligence in the film is its ambivalence regarding certain key points germane to the films politics: why did Alan call Michael in tears in the first place? What is the nature of Harold's relationship with Michael, and what did Michael write on the engraved photo he gives Harold as a gift? What is the nature of Donald's complex friendship with Michael?The entire cast is uniformly superb, although Leonard Frey as the alarming Harold (who gets most of the film's best lines) really outdoes himself and makes the greatest impression. The screenplay (like the play's script before it)  owes too much in terms of its structure to WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, particularly in its last fifteen minutes of monstrous games, shattering revelations, and (most regrettable of all) sobbing catharses, but the film still overcomes that structural drawback.",5,The landmark gay film of the Stonewall era,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,2898,"['William', 'Friedkin', '1970', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'BOYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'BAND', 'preserved', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'Mort', 'Crowley', 'play', 'almost', 'filmed', 'testament', 'incredibly', 'important', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'birthday', 'party', 'fascinating', 'credits', 'sequence', 'out', 'play', 'rest', 'New', 'York', 'men', 'travel', 'Manhattan', 'prepare', 'party', 'entirety', 'film', 'confined', 'Michael', 'city', 'apartment', 'patio', 'were', 'owned', 'real', 'life', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'Tammy', 'Grimes', 'Friedkin', 'retain', 'play', 'overheated', 'atmosphere', 'Crowley', 'also', 'did', 'screenplay', 'kept', 'almost', 'lines', 'play', 'best', 'Crowley', 'insisted', 'film', 'retain', 'excellent', 'cast', 'nine', 'men', 'who', 'performed', 'play', 'off-Broadway', 'who', 'did', 'honor', 'here', 'layered', 'performances', 'exact', 'realization', 'play', 'one', 'might', 'hope', 'actors', 'scale', 'down', 'performances', 'screen', 'quite', 'adeptly', 'Friedkin', 'imagines', 'make', 'film', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'when', 'bizarre', 'character', 'Harold', 'party', 'birthday', 'boy', 'showstopping', 'entrance', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Friedkin', 'closeups', 'shoes', 'ring', 'velvet', 'jacket', 'whole', 'proceedings', 'alerts', 'how', 'important', 'powerful', 'character', 'going', 'be', 'rest', 'film.This', 'landmark', 'gay', 'film', 'was', 'greatly', 'criticized', 'Eighties', 'retrograde', 'weakening', 'gay', 'cause', 'even', 'today', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'will', 'complain', 'film', 'object', 'gay', 'men', 'self-loathing', 'cruel', 'nothing', 'more', 'positive', 'aspects', 'late', 'twentieth-century', 'American', 'gay', 'community', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'have', 'argued', 'important', 'side', 'who', 'urban', 'American', 'gay', 'men', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'years', 'Stonewall', 'film', 'set', '1967', 'even', 'fact', 'can', 'generate', 'such', 'controversy', 'was', 'part', 'Crowley', 'clear', 'original', 'intention', 'part', 'intelligence', 'film', 'ambivalence', 'regarding', 'certain', 'key', 'points', 'germane', 'films', 'politics', 'why', 'did', 'Alan', 'call', 'Michael', 'tears', 'first', 'place', 'What', 'nature', 'Harold', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'what', 'did', 'Michael', 'write', 'engraved', 'photo', 'Harold', 'gift', 'What', 'nature', 'Donald', 'complex', 'friendship', 'Michael', 'entire', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Leonard', 'Frey', 'alarming', 'Harold', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'really', 'greatest', 'impression', 'screenplay', 'play', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'terms', 'structure', 'WHO', 'AFRAID', 'OF', 'VIRGINIA', 'WOOLF', 'particularly', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'monstrous', 'games', 'shattering', 'revelations', 'most', 'regrettable', 'sobbing', 'catharses', 'film', 'still', 'structural', 'drawback']",N/A

Rather than being thrilled by the drama I was embarrassed. These characters not only didn't resemble anyone I knew they barely resembled anyone human.  If the sad, pathetic, self loathing homosexual is what appeals to you then by all means have a wallow with the boys in this band, but please don't think you are gaining any insight into the so-called homosexual lifestyle (whatever that is).  I must admit, however, that I will try to watch this movie again once the dvd is released.  It's been many years since I've seen it and I will watch it again to see if, with the passing of years, I have more tolerance for this relic of what is, thankfully, a bygone age.Update:  I have seen the film since it's release on dvd and my memory served me well. In fact, I find that the film is even worse than I had remembered. Whatever sociological value this play may have had doesn't change the fact that the writing is trite and cliched and about on par with a Lifetime Channel movie. And some of the acting is simply atrocious. Kenneth Nelson gives one of the worse performances I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad that it probably makes the rest of the film seem even worse than it might have otherwise. The only interesting performance is Leonard Frey's.

Reason enough alone to buy it even if you own the VHS version. However Friedkin is not kidding at all about the high quality of the video - especially as compared to the VHS.The DVD is actually 16:9 widescreen, not 2.35:1 as listed on this Amazon page. I loaded both the VHS and DVD into my home cinema system and switched between the two to compare the 4:3 full screen VHS to the 16:9 widescreen DVD and found that both formats offer a very similar amount of detail: the VHS has extra detail top and bottom and the DVD has extra detail on the sides. The DVD is vastly superior to the VHS in clarity, contrast and colour. Perfect in fact.The other immediately noticeable quality advantage in the DVD is that it is bona fide stereo and sounds beautiful and pristine. The VHS tape was labelled as ""HiFi Stereo"" but was really only HiFi mono and it had huge problems with extraneous noise.I first saw Boys In The Band as a midday movie on TV when I was about 16 (ca 1972). I remember that it forced me to be fully aware of the reality and permanance of my homosexuality - especially Harold's stunning ""ready or not"" admonishment to Michael on the futility of self-loathing and repression which ends with: ""You may very well one day be able to know a heterosexual life. If you want it desperately enough. If you pursue it with the fervour with which you annihilate. But you'll always be homosexual as well. Always Michael. Always. Until the day you die.""That scene was also wonderfully filmed.The Boys In The Band helped empower me to have a confident, self-accepting and happy life.

Viewed in the new century, with American voters having just freshly refuted the possibility that homophobia was creeping into extinction, Boys stirs the same ambivalent feelings expressed by queer critic Vito Russo in his book The Celluloid Closet (both ""a freak show"" and ""the best and most potent argument for gay liberation ever offered in a popular art form""); the dishy wit and behavioral truths of its late-'60s demimonde of sophisticated New York homos doesn't dilute the unnerving shame and emotional warfare that explode in its scabrous second act.After a title sequence that represents the major attempt to ""open up"" Crowley's play (Manhattan location shots of the characters shopping, cruising and working, now superfluous but for a glimpse of the still-surviving Julius tavern), Michael, a furtively practicing Catholic and debt-ridden globetrotter who has newly sworn off booze, prepares his East Side duplex apartment and patio for a birthday party, aided by a coolly critical friend-with-benefits (Frederick Combs). The other thirtysomething guests soon follow: the indefatigable queen Emory (Cliff Gorman), ""a butterfly in heat""; a coupled teacher and fashion photog (Laurence Luckinbill and Keith Prentice) quarreling over monogamy; a genial black bookstore clerk (Reuben Greene) who absorbs Michael and Emory's racial jokes with an inner grimace; and two outsiders, a young whore in cowboy drag (Robert La Tourneaux) hired for the honoree, and that WASPy college friend/lawyer in crisis (Peter White) who recoils from and then strikes out at the circle of alien ""pansies."" Finally, stoned, pockmarked ""Jew fairy"" Harold (Leonard Frey, introduced with a grotesque trio of heels-to-'fro, creature-feature close-ups) arrives at his fete just in time to provide a scathing play-by-play on internecine bloodletting that culminates in a brutal telephone truth game.Friedkin shoots the theatrical action--largely verbal parrying and combat, with one physical assault--fluidly, fresh off adapting another stagey Birthday Party (Harold Pinter's). The sizzle of the bon mot-tossing ensemble, intact from the stage original, is bracing and fuels the film's momentum, along with Crowley's lacerating dialogue, some of which has passed into knowing pop lexicons similar to those the party boys draw on in reflexively invoking Suddenly, Last Summer and Bette Davis (the lasagna-toting Emory's ""Hot stuff, comin' through!"" made it into The Simpsons's gay steel-mill episode). But comedy recedes in the long climactic sequence, where an off-the-wagon, vicious Michael forces his friends to ""phone the one person you've truly loved,"" buried grief is exhumed, and lingering jealousies and resentments stoke accusations and betrayals.The film stood accused by Russo in 1981 of presenting ""perfunctory, easily acceptable stereotypes"" and ""lots of zippy fag humor that posed as philosophy."" All of that, and the option of focusing on Michael's sadism and hatefulness as emblematic of the Life, is still arguably evident. The non-swishy lovers played by Luckinbill and Prentice, who come to a tender, hopeful understanding amid the cruelty, are generally denied the attention critics grant the acid-tongued flamboyance of Michael, Harold and Emory; they're the movie's strongest channel to a socially accepting day yet to come. (If one imagines the characters' bond enduring, they could be the subjects of contemporary media stories on decades-long same-sex partners marrying, however temporarily.)Crowley's is not a great play, owing a significant debt to the bitter gaming of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for its melodramatic act-two truth-telling. Shot in the year of Stonewall, Boys is indeed a time capsule of its era's mores, but if Crowley's limited palette of self-loathing and camp-drenched cattiness made it an instant ""period piece"" per Russo, the notion that it blames these men for their fears and lies (which sat well with moralists viewing it as a cautionary tale) seems a clear misreading. The partygoers are caught in the tragedy of the pre-liberation closet, a more crippling and unforgiving one than the closets that remain. Michael's final wish--""If we could just learn not to hate ourselves quite so very much""--has been largely fulfilled. Not quite so very much.Image/SoundThe transfer is spiffy for a low-budget, nearly 40-year-old film. Michael's stylish, kitsch-strewn apartment and balcony glow rather warmly in the festive first half, and when the party crashes with nightfall and the sadistic game playing, the tones go cool and the actors' faces, starkly lit in close-up, are framed by deep, rich shadows. Late in William Friedkin's commentary, he gives a revelatory description of how this disc's look was created by blending an oversaturated color print of the film with a black and white version. The stereo mix is good if unshowy, except when the revelers noisily execute the mashed potato to ""Heat Wave.""ExtrasThree mini-docs trace the mounting of Mart Crowley's play (which even close friends and colleagues thought was too forthright to be staged commercially), its adaptation to the screen, and how the backlash against its ""negative"" images eventually receded. Crowley and Friedkin detail their determination to retain the original theatrical cast rather than fish for risk-taking stars. The two surviving actors, Luckinbill and White, recall the camaraderie of the cast and how they ignored warnings of career-wrecking typecasting. The commentary track features mostly Friedkin and a bit of Crowley, both clearly drawn from the same interviews used in the featurettes rather than a scene-by-scene analysis session. Friedkin is eloquent on his process with the cast and seems to have embraced making the film for all the right reasons, but some of his remarks on advances in social tolerance seem askew (e.g., ""No one in their right mind"" cares about sexual orientation today. But a lot of them vote in California, Florida and Arizona). Crowley intriguingly confesses a lifelong obsession with Hitchcock's Rope, and calls his play ""[Rope] turned inside out.""(By which I HOPE he means that 1) the actors can act and 2) truths are entertainingly told. I HATED ""Rope""!--JMV)Representing Crowley's dramaturgical descendants, Tony Kushner (""Angels in America""--JMV) acknowledges his debt to ""the first gay play"" and vividly remembers getting Emory's ""sssslide rule"" joke at age 13. No deleted scenes (are included--JMV), not even the excised intimate kiss described by Friedkin as a source of debate among the filmmakers and the actors and their agents.OverallCamp it up, Mary, the

1177319,A25FOKK65M7HTW,B001CQONPE,Koreatown Krooner,"[4, 5]","I don't think this play is just about being gay in 1968.  It's about being human and believing your oppressor too much.  It's about smart men with low self-esteem, some of whom drink too much, who are persecuted by an unaccepting society. These men are actually very kind to each other when they're sober.The triumph in the marketplace was that gay subject matter could become mainstream.  Period.  Mart Crowley did this in a monumental way.  I think this play is a masterwork.  These characters are profoundly human.  They may not be any comfort to gay people in provincial, repressed rural communities today.  But these characters still exist now, and they certainly existed in a more widespread way in 1968.  Most readers here live in the modern western world of 2011.  But in many places all over the world, gays are still treated as 2nd and 3rd class citizens.During the play's initial run, Edward Albee said that he saw increasing audiences of straights feeling superior to these characters in this play and film when he watched it.But I'm straight and I never felt superior to these characters.  I thought these characters were excellent men with superior wit, wisdom, radical empathy, courage and a great love for each other.  They were funny and intelligent men who had the chutzpah to find their community when society did not encourage them to do anything but kill themselves.Yeah, the characters in this drama are mostly wealthy Greenwich village whiners in psychoanalysis that are more privileged than the average person struggling with their sexuality or self-esteem in poor or provincial communities.  But the characters are still undeniably human.  The characters of Donald and Bernard represent the working class well, even though they don't have as much to say.Mart Crowley's writing is amazing here.  He relies a lot on humor, but that was the only lubricant that could get this outrageous play into the marketplace at the time.  He was a genius and very brave to push this out there with his name on it in 1967-68 when coming out was no badge of honor and career suicide in show business.  Give the play, the film and all the artists involved their due credit.Also, I can't say enough about the acting.  I don't have words for it right now.  Kenneth Nelson might seem over-the-top to someone who doesn't understand the play, but if you are a bust-out drunk with serious anxiety issues, you might be that loud and scary too.  Cliff Gorman will break your heart with his tender performance as Emory.  Leonard Frey is supernatural as Harold. Both guys, Cliff Gorman and Leonard Frey should have been nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar.Lastly, and I may be alone in this, but my interpretation was: When Alan McCarthy left the room, he had been schooled about what it was to be gay, whether he was going back into the closet or not.  He stuck around to learn something about himself.  What he exactly learned, we can't be sure, but that's the brilliance of the play.I love this film!

And it's the religious and societal brainwashing that teaches homosexuality is evil that lead to the self-loathing that is depicted in the film, which is the main criticism of the film by many.

Several gay men who live and work in the city have a birthday party for one of their friends. The preparation with all of the interaction of these men is well done. When it comes to the party itself events play out from phone calls made and received by these men. Storm showers which affect the affair add to the drama. Even the hiring of a street hustler is played well in this movie. Remember lots of stereotypes are played.

1177324,AYWIO6OYAGFGQ,B001CQONPE,"pm444 ""pm444""","[7, 8]","I first heard the play on LPs in the listening room at my college library in the late 1960's. It was my first exposure to what seemed at the time to be ""real"" gay people in a play written by a gay man, and I listened to it over and over. When the movie came out, I went with friends to see it in a nearby large city (the film didn't get wide distribution).  The theater was almost empty, but I sat totally enthralled throughout the entire film.I've seen it many times since then, and of course I realize why younger gay people are put off by it, because it's so far removed from their reality.  Not only that, but today there are hundreds of films that portray positive gay characters who effectively confront a variety of situations.  But in the context of its time, this was a breakthrough film.  Up until that time, there had been very few films with openly gay characters, and when a gay character did appear in a mainstream film, it was as a figure to be feared, scorned, pitied, or derided.  There had never been a Hollywood film in which all the main characters were gay or bisexual.It's true that many of the characters in the film were extreme stereotypes, but at least some of them were portrayed sympathetically, and that was a first.  The dialogue may seem campy and dated, but it has a certain wit and intelligence that haven't faded.  Furthermore, whether we want to admit it or not, the film accurately depicted the self-loathing that plagued certain gay men of that generation. Before blaming some of the characters in this film for failing to accept their homosexuality, let's not forget that suicide among gay teens continues to be an issue of concern.  Clearly, even in more enlightened times, very few people find it easy to deal with their homosexuality.  So the film can serve to remind us not only of how far we have come, but how far we still have to go.Reading some of the other reviews here, it's good to know that I'm not the only one upon whom this film had such a powerful impact.  While it was many years before I was able to acknowledge my own sexual orientation, this film was one of the first steps that allowed that process to occur at all.  For that reason alone, it will always be a landmark film for me, and not just a historical artifact.",5,A landmark film,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,2276,"['first', 'heard', 'play', 'LPs', 'listening', 'room', 'college', 'library', 'late', '1960', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'what', 'seemed', 'time', 'be', 'real', 'gay', 'people', 'play', 'written', 'gay', 'man', 'listened', 'over', 'When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'went', 'friends', 'see', 'nearby', 'large', 'city', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'wide', 'distribution', 'theater', 'was', 'almost', 'empty', 'sat', 'totally', 'enthralled', 'entire', 'film.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'then', 'course', 'realize', 'why', 'younger', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'reality', 'Not', 'only', 'today', 'are', 'hundreds', 'films', 'portray', 'positive', 'gay', 'characters', 'who', 'effectively', 'confront', 'variety', 'situations', 'context', 'time', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'openly', 'gay', 'characters', 'when', 'gay', 'character', 'did', 'appear', 'mainstream', 'film', 'was', 'figure', 'be', 'feared', 'scorned', 'pitied', 'derided', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'gay', 'bisexual.It', 'true', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'extreme', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'were', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'was', 'first', 'dialogue', 'may', 'seem', 'campy', 'dated', 'certain', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'have', ""n't"", 'faded', 'Furthermore', 'want', 'admit', 'not', 'film', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'self-loathing', 'plagued', 'certain', 'gay', 'men', 'generation', 'blaming', 'characters', 'film', 'failing', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'suicide', 'gay', 'teens', 'be', 'issue', 'concern', 'Clearly', 'even', 'more', 'enlightened', 'times', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'find', 'easy', 'deal', 'homosexuality', 'film', 'can', 'serve', 'remind', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'how', 'far', 'still', 'have', 'go.Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'good', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'upon', 'whom', 'film', 'had', 'powerful', 'impact', 'was', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'able', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'steps', 'allowed', 'process', 'occur', 'reason', 'alone', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'landmark', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'historical', 'artifact']",N/A

The details, as well as the written play, are readily available. Finally this classic gay film is available on DVD; and it's a masterpiece in every way imaginable. As William Friedkin & Mart Crowley have said, this is the best looking print of ""The Boys in the Band"" ever produced ... better than any theatrical print in existence. The bonus features are icing on the cake. They are presented in three featurettes, one dealing with the play, one with the film and the final one with what happened to the film and the cast during the nearly forty years since it was released.For those of you who've heard that the film is negative, please don't be put off by this. It's a look at gay life prior to the era of gay liberation. Certainly, and thankfully, things have improved greatly since the setting of the film, the late 1960's. Seeing the film gives you a look at those times. After seeing the film, I believe you will know two things. 1) Even though none of us would want to go back to a time when the closet was the rule for most gay men, it is still important to know that life was not all misery then. Gay men still found each other and came together to enjoy their lives, forming friendships and relationships just as they do now. 2) Even though we've come so far, we have a long way to go. If you're really honest with yourself, you will have to admit that you know someone in your group of associates who is just like each of these men. The film is not that dated.A few years ago, there was a study that involved showing the film to three different groups. One group was in their forties, one in their thirties and another in their twenties. The forty-somethings thought that the film was dated and didn't identify with the characters very much. The people in their thirties admitted they knew some people just like the boys in the film. Strangely the youngest group said the characters in the film were just like many of their friends ... or even themselves. What does this tell us? It tells us that self-acceptance and the development of self-respect is a journey. The people in their forties had lived twenty years longer and had completed their journey to a greater extent than the middle and youngest groups. We can be hopeful  that Michael had arrived at the first step toward his journey at the end of the film.",5,A Must See!,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2445,"['Most', 'gay', 'men', 'many', 'heterosexual', 'people', 'have', 'heard', 'seen', 'Boys', 'Band', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'story', 'details', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'play', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'Finally', 'classic', 'gay', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'masterpiece', 'way', 'imaginable', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Mart', 'Crowley', 'have', 'said', 'best', 'looking', 'print', 'Boys', 'Band', 'ever', 'produced', 'better', 'theatrical', 'print', 'existence', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'icing', 'cake', 'are', 'presented', 'three', 'featurettes', 'one', 'dealing', 'play', 'one', 'film', 'final', 'one', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'cast', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'was', 'released.For', 'who', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'negative', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'look', 'gay', 'life', 'prior', 'era', 'gay', 'liberation', 'Certainly', 'thankfully', 'things', 'have', 'improved', 'greatly', 'setting', 'film', 'late', '1960', 'Seeing', 'film', 'look', 'times', 'seeing', 'film', 'believe', 'will', 'know', 'two', 'things', '1', 'Even', 'none', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'closet', 'was', 'rule', 'most', 'gay', 'men', 'still', 'important', 'know', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'misery', 'then', 'Gay', 'men', 'still', 'found', 'other', 'came', 'together', 'enjoy', 'lives', 'forming', 'friendships', 'relationships', 'just', 'do', 'now', '2', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'come', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', ""'re"", 'really', 'honest', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'know', 'someone', 'group', 'associates', 'who', 'just', 'men', 'film', 'not', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'study', 'involved', 'showing', 'film', 'three', 'different', 'groups', 'One', 'group', 'was', 'forties', 'one', 'thirties', 'twenties', 'forty-somethings', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'dated', 'did', ""n't"", 'identify', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'people', 'thirties', 'admitted', 'knew', 'people', 'just', 'boys', 'film', 'Strangely', 'youngest', 'group', 'said', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'many', 'friends', 'even', 'What', 'tell', 'self-acceptance', 'development', 'self-respect', 'journey', 'people', 'forties', 'had', 'lived', 'twenty', 'years', 'longer', 'had', 'completed', 'journey', 'greater', 'extent', 'middle', 'youngest', 'groups', 'can', 'be', 'hopeful', 'Michael', 'had', 'arrived', 'first', 'step', 'journey', 'end', 'film']",N/A
