701013,A33F2NHAO6HX5E,B00006676F,Blackworm,"[7, 7]","THE OTHER BROTHER centers around baby boy Martin Blaze (Hapless), a self-sufficent young man who can handle his business and his close friendship with his brother's ex-girlfriend, Ronnie.  His downfall is his attempts to reconnect with the female population after catching his girlfriend having an affair.  His style is a little too conservative, bending on a little rude.  When he finds a connection with a woman, instead of addressing her, he stares.  His courage comes in the form of older brother, Junnie (Hopeless).  All that Martin lacks, Junnie has in spades.  Confidence overflows with this guy, yet it's his lack of responsibility that makes him a very shallow man.  Using his looks for his gain, he is not above sweet-talking the clerk at a dry cleaners to get his attire cleaned for free, and all the meaningless sex he can get by lying his [head] off.  Both characters change when Martin meets his dream girl and Junnie hits rock bottom when his lazy ways catch up with him and start to wreck his life.  A pretty good movie with an alternate ending that could have been added to the main feature, since it wouldn't have altered the tone of the movie at all.",4,The story of Hapless and Hopeless.,1033344000,"09 30, 2002",2002,1169,"['OTHER', 'BROTHER', 'centers', 'baby', 'boy', 'Martin', 'Blaze', 'Hapless', 'self-sufficent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'business', 'close', 'friendship', 'brother', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Ronnie', 'downfall', 'attempts', 'reconnect', 'female', 'population', 'catching', 'girlfriend', 'having', 'affair', 'style', 'little', 'too', 'conservative', 'bending', 'little', 'rude', 'When', 'connection', 'woman', 'instead', 'addressing', 'courage', 'form', 'older', 'brother', 'Junnie', 'Hopeless', 'Martin', 'lacks', 'Junnie', 'spades', 'Confidence', 'guy', 'lack', 'responsibility', 'very', 'shallow', 'man', 'Using', 'looks', 'gain', 'not', 'sweet-talking', 'clerk', 'dry', 'cleaners', 'get', 'attire', 'cleaned', 'free', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'can', 'get', 'lying', '[', 'head', ']', 'off', 'characters', 'change', 'when', 'Martin', 'dream', 'girl', 'Junnie', 'hits', 'rock', 'bottom', 'when', 'lazy', 'ways', 'catch', 'up', 'start', 'wreck', 'life', 'A', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'alternate', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'main', 'feature', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'altered', 'tone', 'movie']",The Other Brother

But Mekhi Phifer (Martin) isn't very convincing as a nerd and some of the cinematography leaves much to be desired. I even saw the boom mic in the shot when Martin and Paula went back to the park and saw their favorite artist. This film feels extremely straight-to-video. -EJR,3,Pretty good,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,383,"['quot', 'Other', 'Brother', 'quot', '2001', 'storyline', 'was', 'okay', 'were', 'even', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'nerd', 'cinematography', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'even', 'saw', 'boom', 'mic', 'shot', 'when', 'Martin', 'Paula', 'went', 'back', 'park', 'saw', 'favorite', 'artist', 'film', 'extremely', 'straight-to-video', '-EJR']",The Other Brother
