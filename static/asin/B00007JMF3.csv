I saw part of this program on television (entitled there as ""Happy Christmas, Miss King"") and was taken by the setting and the tartar, Miss King.  Just got around to viewing it today and loved it.  Of course, I had no background of the players from the series, but a look at Wikipedia and a second viewing caught things up sufficiently for a unique Christmas special.  I really liked the King family, enjoying Hettie even before her softening, when ""life's vicissitudes"" (one of her phrases) came her way.  Rachel was listed as a town gossip and sometimes friend/sometimes enemy of Hettie, but she was very pleasing here as the housemate.

729630,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,B00007JMF3,Reliable Reviews Too,"[1, 2]","""Avonlea Christmas"" is missing the wonderful charm of seasons 1-6 of ""Road to Avonlea"".I highly recommend seasons 1-5 of ""Road to Avonlea"", season-6 is good, but does not reach the heights of the earlier seasons. The episodes are written by different writers. The focus of the ""Avonlea Christmas"" episode, is one dispute to the next, rather than predicaments for the characters to display their personalities, and their ultimate warmth. The little kids are grown, so the same arguments are no longer cute. This episode-writer was unfamiliar with the true personalities of the characters previously established in the mind of the audience. My favorite episode writers of the early seasons of ""Avonlea"", Heather Conkie, Suzette Couture, and Hart Hanson, who set a high standard for the series, did not write ""Avonlea Christmas"".Has the same technical proficiency in costumes, lighting, and good morals; but something is missing. It is not the same. Likewise, the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies were great, (with the script lifted from the books) but the third Anne movie, during World-War-I, was unsatisfying, as here, written by a different writer, taking us to a place we did not wish to go, with characters we do not know.If you do not expect to continue ""Road to Avonlea"", and do not mind more conflict, then you may enjoy this.

729634,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00007JMF3,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""An Avonlea Christmas"", also known as ""Happy Christmas Miss King"" reunites some of the beloved cast members from the Road to Avonlea series,Road to Avonlea: The Complete First SeasonthroughRoad to Avonlea: The Complete Seventh Volume. Unfortunately, many of the familiar cast members are missing from this stand-alone episode - Jasper Dale, Olivia's husband was not featured; Gus Pike (Felicity King's husband) is in Halifax; the Pettibone's are not in it; and, Felix King only appears in several short scenes on account of being away at war.I was quite disappointed that the producers decided to focus on the First World War and how it affected the inhabitants of Avonlea. Though this may be historically accurate, I wanted to see a light-hearted episode of one of my favorite family shows. Instead, the tone is dark from the very beginning when we see Felix King in a battle scene. The mood in Avonlea is also low-spirited - many inhabitants have sent their young men off to fight in the war thousands of miles away, including Alec and Janet King, and though the planning for the Christmas festivities continue as usual, some obviously do not have their hearts in it. Janet misses her son; Olivia stews over Jasper's absence; and Felicity King ponders her uncertain future when the foundling house she started with Gus Pike is closed down.Hetty King, the stalwart of tradition, continues as though nothing is amiss. She oversees the Avonlea concert for Christmas, and gets into a bitter argument with both Olivia (for constantly criticizing Jasper) and Janet (for not showing more compassion over Felix's MIA status). When Hetty is diagnosed with a possible life-threatening condition, she gets plenty of time to reflect upon her own actions.Though this was not the best effort in the RTA series, I am just glad they made a reunion movie of sorts (the series proper ended in 1996, and this was released in 1998).
