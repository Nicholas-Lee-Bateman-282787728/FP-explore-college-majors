872229,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0006Q941Y,David E. Levine,"[12, 14]","I saw this movie on ESPN several times. It is an eye opener, if factually correct. Tom Sizemore plays Pete Rose and depicts him getting stooges to place bets for him. Rose's complicity in gambling on baseball is no longer in question, indeed, the movie closes with actual footage of Rose making admissions. What was a revelation to me was the depiction of Rose as a totally self centered user. Dash Mihok is very convincing as a sucker Rose uses to place bets for him and, as Rose gets more deeply involved, Rose cajoles him into laying out money on his behalf. Rose was smooth and he was adept at sucking others in and assuring them that all is OK with breezy assurances and back slapping. He had no real friends, only poor suckers who, starry eyed at being part of a celebrity's inner circle, were taken advantage of. They were Rose's ""friends"" only so long as they were useful to him. Otherwise, Rose would dump them and not return their calls.Rose comes across as a prize BS artist who, cajoles and gets  the celebrity stricken hanger on, played by Mihok, to do his dirty work. Rose's sin of betting on baseball, and particularly the Reds, was unforgivable but, not nearly as unforgivable as was his use of others. He ends up smooth talking his stooge rather than paying him back the money he owed. In fact, through his lawyer, Rose attempted to make it appear that he was doing the poor guy a favor when he paid back only a portion of the debt. Being involved in gambling was not half as bad as dragging others in with him and then attempting to leave them holding the bag. I am fully aware that filmakers resort to dramatic license but, if Rose's amoral use of others is subtanially true, then he certainly should never, ever, be allowed into baseball again. Perhaps, he should be allowed into the hall of fame, so long as his plaque does not gloss over his misdeeds. However, he should never be allowed on a baseball field in any official capacity.",5,Eye opening,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1955,"['saw', 'movie', 'ESPN', 'several', 'times', 'eye', 'opener', 'factually', 'correct', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'getting', 'stooges', 'place', 'bets', 'Rose', 'complicity', 'gambling', 'baseball', 'longer', 'question', 'indeed', 'movie', 'actual', 'footage', 'Rose', 'making', 'admissions', 'What', 'was', 'revelation', 'was', 'depiction', 'Rose', 'totally', 'self', 'centered', 'user', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'very', 'convincing', 'sucker', 'Rose', 'place', 'bets', 'Rose', 'more', 'deeply', 'involved', 'Rose', 'laying', 'out', 'money', 'behalf', 'Rose', 'was', 'smooth', 'was', 'adept', 'sucking', 'others', 'assuring', 'OK', 'breezy', 'assurances', 'back', 'slapping', 'had', 'real', 'friends', 'only', 'poor', 'suckers', 'who', 'starry', 'eyed', 'being', 'part', 'celebrity', 'inner', 'circle', 'were', 'taken', 'advantage', 'were', 'Rose', 'friends', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'were', 'useful', 'Otherwise', 'Rose', 'would', 'dump', 'not', 'return', 'calls.Rose', 'across', 'prize', 'BS', 'artist', 'who', 'cajoles', 'celebrity', 'stricken', 'hanger', 'played', 'Mihok', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Rose', 'sin', 'betting', 'baseball', 'particularly', 'Reds', 'was', 'unforgivable', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'unforgivable', 'was', 'use', 'others', 'up', 'smooth', 'talking', 'stooge', 'rather', 'paying', 'back', 'money', 'owed', 'fact', 'lawyer', 'Rose', 'attempted', 'make', 'appear', 'was', 'doing', 'poor', 'guy', 'favor', 'when', 'paid', 'back', 'only', 'portion', 'debt', 'Being', 'involved', 'gambling', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'dragging', 'others', 'then', 'attempting', 'leave', 'holding', 'bag', 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'filmakers', 'resort', 'dramatic', 'license', 'Rose', 'amoral', 'use', 'others', 'subtanially', 'true', 'then', 'certainly', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'allowed', 'baseball', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'hall', 'fame', 'so', 'long', 'plaque', 'not', 'gloss', 'misdeeds', 'However', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'baseball', 'field', 'official', 'capacity']",Hustle

872235,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0006Q941Y,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","He's not in the Hall of Fame, nevertheless, Pete Rose was still one of the best players in Baseball history. He played for an amazing 27 years, setting the all-time hits record, but this film ignores all of that. I'm a baseball fanatic and I find bio-pics, like this one, to be a great tool for learning more about the people who came before my time. Hustle was unfortunately very one sided and focuses entirely on Rose's activities after his playing career. Tom Sizemore stars as Rose and makes this film worth watching, he really does do a tremendous job, and that's the only reason this film is rated ad highly as it is. After doing some research, it turns out that the events in this film are historically accurate, but blown way out of proportion. Hustle makes Pete Rose look like a junior gangster, running around Cincinnati, ripping people off, and using anyone that he can find. The truth is that Pete Rose was a sick man with a gambling addiction. He got in over his head and yes, he started betting on his own sport and even the team he managed. Rose was never buddy buddy with the mafia, he never bet hundreds of thousands of dollars at one time, and he was never involved with drugs. This film makes a case that Pete Rose was a small time gangster in a baseball uniform and that's simply not true. The man had an addiction that he's been treated for. This addiction cost him his career, his status, and even his family. 25 years later, he's admitted to what he's done and has sincerely apologized. I personally think, it's been long enough and it's time to put the man in the Hall of Fame. It's also time for someone to do an accurate film depiction of Rose, that shows the good along with the bad, something Hustle simply doesn't do.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1746,"['not', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'nevertheless', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'players', 'Baseball', 'history', 'played', 'amazing', '27', 'years', 'setting', 'all-time', 'hits', 'record', 'film', ""'m"", 'baseball', 'fanatic', 'find', 'bio-pics', 'one', 'be', 'great', 'tool', 'learning', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'time', 'Hustle', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'entirely', 'Rose', 'activities', 'playing', 'career', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'stars', 'Rose', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'rated', 'ad', 'highly', 'doing', 'research', 'out', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'blown', 'way', 'proportion', 'Hustle', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'look', 'junior', 'gangster', 'running', 'around', 'Cincinnati', 'ripping', 'people', 'using', 'anyone', 'can', 'find', 'truth', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'was', 'sick', 'man', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'got', 'head', 'yes', 'started', 'betting', 'own', 'sport', 'even', 'team', 'managed', 'Rose', 'was', 'never', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'mafia', 'never', 'bet', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'never', 'involved', 'drugs', 'film', 'case', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'was', 'small', 'time', 'gangster', 'baseball', 'uniform', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'man', 'had', 'addiction', 'been', 'treated', 'addiction', 'cost', 'career', 'status', 'even', 'family', '25', 'years', 'later', 'admitted', 'what', 'done', 'sincerely', 'apologized', 'personally', 'think', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'time', 'put', 'man', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'also', 'time', 'someone', 'do', 'accurate', 'film', 'depiction', 'Rose', 'good', 'along', 'bad', 'something', 'Hustle', 'simply', ""n't"", 'do']",Hustle
