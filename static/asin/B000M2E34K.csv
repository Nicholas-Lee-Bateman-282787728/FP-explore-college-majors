South Korea has hosted the Olympic Games in Seoul, its growing Christian population has tensions with Buddhists, and Korean pop has become a worldwide sensation... while North Korea, sealed off by the DMZ, remains the Hermit Kingdom.National Geographic traveled inside North Korea with correspondent Lisa Ling, as she went with a doctor who healed the blind. As it is, North Korea is dependent on the outside world for sustenance (like foreign food aid), despite its teaching of juche (self-reliance) The doctor struggles to give sight in hospitals that lack the necessities. National Geographic shows the worship of the Kims (Jong-Il and Il-Sung) that's a part of daily life. The recently deceased Kim Jong-Il is treated as a living god. Ling goes from interviewing North Koreans who daily bow to their Beloved Leader, to those who heroically escaped by crossing the DMZ, risking everything for freedom.""Inside North Korea"" is a good introduction, butA State of Mindis a superior documentary on life within the North Korean regime.

It doesn't get too heavy with information and seems to be a good spring board for wanting to learn more about North Korea, Korea in general and the Korean War.  It touches on all of these things lightly.  I would have loved more background on how North Korea ended up how it has, but I know more than I did before I watched this--which is a good litmus test for a documentary.Ling enters Korea under the pretext of documenting a doctor's eye surgery clinic:10 days, over 1,000 surgeries to restore sight.  Even if this documentary had just been about him and his mission it actually would have been pretty interesting.It is pretty fast paced, has a strong narrative thread that Ling keeps coming back to, with the eye surgery cover story, as she also explores other facets of North Korea.It is frighting to realise that concentration camps and the like still exist in the world.

1042119,A28IK698VHKLUK,B000M2E34K,A. O. Sheepfielder,"[12, 21]","A unique and very interesting look inside one of the most bizarre and cruel societies on Earth.  Content wise, I really enjoyed ""Inside North Korea,"" but I have to admit, I felt pretty guilty about enjoying it.  Here's why . . . .I have to question the wisdom and journalistic ethics of making this documentary in the stealthy way that the folks at National Geographic Channel did. They basically used a desperately needed humanitarian relief organization to sneak in Western reporters, which are otherwise absolutely forbidden by the paranoid and ultra-secretive North Korean government. Didn't it occur to Lisa Ling and National Geographic that, by cloaking themselves in the mantel of humanitarian aid to film a forbidden documentary, they might severely jeopardize any future humanitarian efforts? Did they think that after Kim Jong Il found out he'd been suckered and embarassed, he would ever let another international relief agency into his country to care for his long-suffering populus?Even more disturbing is the life-and-death peril into which this production knowingly placed the official North Korean guides assigned to Lisa Ling and company. Throughout the program, Ling repeatedly comments on the terrible consequences of visitors asking the wrong questions, taking the wrong pictures or doing anything that might in any way be perceived as critical of or disrespectful to the North Korean government. But these consequences aren't so much for the foreign visitors themselves; they're for the visitors' guides, government-appointed handlers who face severe repercussions if the foreigners in their care step out of line, including being sent to concentration camps where they would almost certainly die.  Was making a one-hour documentary for cable TV worth knowingly sacrificing these people? This isn't like some American corporate stooge getting fired for saying too much to Michael Moore. If Lisa Ling's narration is to be believed (and I can think of no reason to doubt it), because they made this documentary in the clandestine way that they did -- using lies, subterfuge, and trickery --, their North Korean guides (AND their guides' entire families) are going to suffer and maybe even die. Cheers, National Geographic Channel.

1042121,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B000M2E34K,CGScammell,"[0, 1]","I watched this short video twice last night.  This 50-minute video is a great introduction to North Korea, but leaves the viewer wanting more.  In defense of National Geographic, the North Korean government is perhaps one of the most secretive and exclusive governments out there-,- that getting any video from inside the country is nearly impossible.  EVERYTHING gets censored, and even the NatGeo crew was constantly being followed during the filming of this video.Some things, however, stand out.  North Koreans are malnourished.  They are shorter in stature and weigh less than their South Korean counterparts.  They are trained from birth to thank their ""Great Leader"" (whatever nutjob is in power, as is the current Kim Jong il and his equally nutjob son Jong-un).  Everytime a North Korean gets food s/he must thank the ""Great Leader"" and the more dramatic the tears, the more favorable that person is to North Korean officials.  Yet North Koreans are not allowed access to the internet or free TV or radio.  The people live in a closed society and are controlled through fear and intimidation.  The North Korean government doesn't even trust its own officials, which is why they always appear in groups of three.  This is akin to the old nutjob East German government, another Stalinist state bordering a free western society.The NatGeo crew had limited access to anything worth documenting.  There were a few North Korean defectors with harrowing stories to tell.  Most who try to escape end up dying in the process or are caught by North Koreans.  A few doctors were allowed special access to perform medical surgeries, as cateracts are common in a country whose people don't get enough nutritional food to eat; blindness and other vision problems are prevalent where basic vitamins are lacking.  Yet even though non-Korean doctors (German, Nepalese) are performing the quick eye surgery, the patient must scream out fake praise for their ""Great Leader,"" perhaps only perhaps the great leader allowed the doctors into the country in the first place.The weakness of this video is that so much was not shown.  There were no city scenes of people lying comatose in the streets from malnutrition.  No dead or dying elderly videotaped in the streets of the big cities.  What the viewer has to do is instead watch these shorter videos that are released by various agencies and make their own educated opinion of how truly bad the North Koreans have it.  There are no political prisons shown, no sweeping countrysides depicted in this video.  Perhaps this just reinforces the fact that the North Korean government's control over its people and its image to the outside world is truly powerful.This video covers only the tip of the iceberg.  It is well done from a short medical-humanitarian side, but there is so much left unseen for the curious mind.  This is not to say what is shown in this documentary isn't disturbing.  To see these people suffer needlessly is heart-wretching.",4,There needs to be a Part II,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,2985,"['watched', 'short', 'video', 'twice', 'last', 'night', '50-minute', 'video', 'great', 'introduction', 'North', 'Korea', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'defense', 'National', 'Geographic', 'North', 'Korean', 'government', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'secretive', 'exclusive', 'governments', 'there-', 'getting', 'video', 'country', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'EVERYTHING', 'censored', 'even', 'NatGeo', 'crew', 'was', 'constantly', 'being', 'followed', 'filming', 'video.Some', 'things', 'however', 'stand', 'out', 'North', 'Koreans', 'are', 'malnourished', 'are', 'shorter', 'stature', 'weigh', 'less', 'South', 'Korean', 'counterparts', 'are', 'trained', 'birth', 'thank', 'Great', 'Leader', 'power', 'current', 'Kim', 'Jong', 'il', 'equally', 'nutjob', 'son', 'Jong-un', 'Everytime', 'North', 'Korean', 'food', 's/he', 'must', 'thank', 'Great', 'Leader', 'more', 'dramatic', 'tears', 'more', 'favorable', 'person', 'North', 'Korean', 'officials', 'North', 'Koreans', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'access', 'internet', 'free', 'TV', 'radio', 'people', 'live', 'closed', 'society', 'are', 'controlled', 'fear', 'intimidation', 'North', 'Korean', 'government', ""n't"", 'even', 'trust', 'own', 'officials', 'why', 'always', 'appear', 'groups', 'three', 'akin', 'old', 'nutjob', 'East', 'German', 'government', 'Stalinist', 'state', 'bordering', 'free', 'western', 'society.The', 'NatGeo', 'crew', 'had', 'limited', 'access', 'anything', 'worth', 'documenting', 'were', 'few', 'North', 'Korean', 'defectors', 'harrowing', 'stories', 'tell', 'Most', 'who', 'try', 'escape', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'process', 'are', 'caught', 'North', 'Koreans', 'A', 'few', 'doctors', 'were', 'allowed', 'special', 'access', 'perform', 'medical', 'surgeries', 'cateracts', 'are', 'common', 'country', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'nutritional', 'food', 'eat', 'blindness', 'other', 'vision', 'problems', 'are', 'prevalent', 'where', 'basic', 'vitamins', 'are', 'lacking', 'even', 'non-Korean', 'doctors', 'German', 'Nepalese', 'are', 'performing', 'quick', 'eye', 'surgery', 'patient', 'must', 'scream', 'out', 'fake', 'praise', 'Great', 'Leader', 'perhaps', 'only', 'perhaps', 'great', 'leader', 'allowed', 'doctors', 'country', 'first', 'place.The', 'weakness', 'video', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'were', 'city', 'scenes', 'people', 'lying', 'comatose', 'streets', 'malnutrition', 'dead', 'dying', 'elderly', 'videotaped', 'streets', 'big', 'cities', 'What', 'viewer', 'do', 'instead', 'watch', 'shorter', 'videos', 'are', 'released', 'various', 'agencies', 'make', 'own', 'educated', 'opinion', 'how', 'truly', 'bad', 'North', 'Koreans', 'have', 'are', 'political', 'prisons', 'shown', 'sweeping', 'countrysides', 'depicted', 'video', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'fact', 'North', 'Korean', 'government', 'control', 'people', 'image', 'outside', 'world', 'truly', 'powerful.This', 'video', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'well', 'done', 'short', 'medical-humanitarian', 'side', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'unseen', 'curious', 'mind', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'shown', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'disturbing', 'see', 'people', 'suffer', 'needlessly', 'heart-wretching']",N/A

1042129,A3DTHQIPBY0NI7,B000M2E34K,M. Feldman,"[4, 9]","This film might be useful for someone who knows little about North Korea; it's a good starting point. I use the film myself with high school students who are studying George Orwell's ""1984."" However, there are a few caveats. The film emphasizes scenes of people bowing before portraits and statues of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader. In one stunning segment, blind people who've had corrective surgery (the film makers come in pretending to be part of a medical team) pull the bandages from their eyes and immediately begin praising the Dear Leader and kowtowing before his portrait. An ominous soundtrack adds to the surrealism. The implication (since this is the last segment in the film) is that all North Korean citizens have been completely brainwashed. As O'Brien, speaking of the Party, says to Winston in 1984, ""We shall fill you with ourselves."" Then the camera cuts away to images of ICBM's---and the implication clearly is that nuclear weapons are in the hands of a nation that is impervious to reason. North Korea is a bizarre, dangerous, and chilling place (read the recent memoir of the American deserter Charles Jenkins). But to summon up old canards about hordes of Asians in thrall, drone-like, to  fanaticism is to suggest that such people would be immune to diplomacy----and we know where that takes us. If you use this film in class (or just see it yourself), bring along a little skepticism about the choices film makers make to tell a good story. An interesting (and better) film  to see in conjunction with this one is Daniel Gordon's ""A State of Mind,"" about two girls preparing for the North Korean mass games.",3,A Beginner's Guide to North Korea,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,1640,"['film', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'North', 'Korea', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'use', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'studying', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'caveats', 'film', 'scenes', 'people', 'bowing', 'portraits', 'statues', 'Great', 'Leader', 'Dear', 'Leader', 'one', 'stunning', 'segment', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'had', 'corrective', 'surgery', 'film', 'makers', 'come', 'pretending', 'be', 'part', 'medical', 'team', 'bandages', 'eyes', 'immediately', 'begin', 'praising', 'Dear', 'Leader', 'kowtowing', 'portrait', 'ominous', 'soundtrack', 'surrealism', 'implication', 'last', 'segment', 'film', 'North', 'Korean', 'citizens', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'brainwashed', ""O'Brien"", 'speaking', 'Party', 'Winston', '1984', 'shall', 'fill', 'Then', 'camera', 'away', 'images', 'ICBM', '-and', 'implication', 'clearly', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'are', 'hands', 'nation', 'impervious', 'reason', 'North', 'Korea', 'bizarre', 'dangerous', 'chilling', 'place', 'read', 'recent', 'memoir', 'American', 'deserter', 'Charles', 'Jenkins', 'summon', 'up', 'old', 'canards', 'hordes', 'Asians', 'thrall', 'drone-like', 'fanaticism', 'suggest', 'such', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'immune', 'diplomacy', 'know', 'where', 'use', 'film', 'class', 'just', 'see', 'bring', 'along', 'little', 'skepticism', 'choices', 'film', 'makers', 'make', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'better', 'film', 'see', 'conjunction', 'one', 'Daniel', 'Gordon', 'A', 'State', 'Mind', 'two', 'girls', 'preparing', 'North', 'Korean', 'mass', 'games']",N/A

This film offers a rare chance for the world to see what really lies behind the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone.An eye surgeon from Nepal who travels the world teaching surgeons techniques in eye surgery and healing as many people as he can while he's there has received permission from Kim Jong-Il to travel the secluded country to do 1000 cataracts surgeries in 10 days time. Lisa Ling and her camera crew are able to get permission to accompany the surgeon in order to film his work. In addition, they are able to use this time in North Korea to learn what life there is really like for it's citizens.They are guarded 24hrs a day by ""minders"" the whole time they are in the country. These same minders take them to the homes of some of North Korea's most privileged residents for interviews. Quickly you realize how controlled this country is. No one dare speaks anything but praises of Kim Jong-Il. They worship him as almost a god.The movie also includes interviews from previous North Korean defectors. They give incite into the horrors people there really face. Concentration camps for the family members of anyone who flees the country, punishments for the slightest mistakes made and a nation filled with starving children are just some of the hardships. Yet through all their suffering, they still adore their ""Great Leader"", as they call him.National Geographic also spent time filming the intricacies of the Demilitarized Zone borders. With both North and South Koreans standing guard facing each other every day, 24 hours a day. It shows how they are literally so close they could pull soldiers from one side to the other.A really well done movie that gives us a chance to see into a nation cut off from the rest of world.

With their cover in place, the team takes a look at the elusive country and their dedicated (brainwashed?) civilians.  What the team witnesses is extremely troubling: North Korea is in poor condition, with many of the citizens near starvation, while these conditions are only intensified by Kim Jong Il's rejection of foreign aid.  I was extremely disturbed upon hearing of an entire generation so malnourished that they have actually been stunted in growth and development.Meanwhile, Kim Jong Il is revered as a God within his country.  The same man that is to blame for the lack of medical services is celebrated when he allows a doctor to attend to his people.  Whether the worship of Kim Jong Il is genuine or out of fear is debatable.  Either way, it is somewhat disturbing.""Inside North Korea"" is tough to swallow.  There are so many disturbing facets of North Korean life that go unresolved because of the dictatorship, that the folks at National Geographic couldn't have possibly documented (mostly due to time constraints).  The documentary is not all disturbing; there are many parts of the film that leave the audience with a sense of hope.I highly recommend ""Inside North Korea"" for its educational content as well as its entertainment value.  I can honestly say that before this documentary, I was ignorant to what life is like in North Korea.
