Well, no wonder! I think the main reason for that is some smart executive actually watched it and felt too horrified to release it into wide circulation. I couldn't believe how poorly it was done, and despite the charm of the stars - Michelle Pfeiffer looks radiant and Paul Rudd is quirky cute as usual, I could not keep watching it. I think it took 30 minutes before I returned the DVD back to Netflix, and I tried, I really really tried. I think the character of Mother Nature (played by very annoying here Tracy Ullman) who occasionally shows up eating chips should have been the first clue to turn it off. There seemed to be no plot and little point besides telling us that every age is beautiful in its own way. I was just about to comment on pacing, and I realized there was none.

1124928,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00109KN0M,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Romantic comedies abound, so I was hesitant to retry the genre with yet another film starring Michelle Pfeiffer. She seems to love the genre; not necessarily all comedy but definitely the romantic part. Ever sinceOne Fine Day(1996) where she starred alongside the then and future heart-throb George Clooney (Michael Clayton), she's been consistently on the romance movie radar screen (that's been 12 years as of this review).But Pfeiffer does an okay job once again as an aging screenwriter named Rosie, trying to keep her job, her sanity, and her teen daughter all from imploding. Circling around these troublesome times is Rosie's growing awareness of her age (mid-40s) and her lack of any new romantic prospects. Her ""battle scenes"" with her daughter's Ken and Barbie dolls are pretty darn funny, too, which also aided in the darker side of the comedic need to understand one's own age. Her daughter Izzie (Saoirse Ronan,Atonement) has just got her period and is full into what she believes to be womanhood. Rosie's daughter's blossoming adulthood triggers Rosie's own sense of love and she finds it in the unlikely arms of a much, much younger man/actor named Adam (Paul Rudd,Knocked Up).Difficulties abound thanks to Rosie's passive-aggressive secretary Jeannie (Sarah Alexander) who does everything to thwart Rosie's possibilities at a love life; and thanks to Rosie's ex-husband Nathan (Jon Lovitz) who's always having some body part of his remade via plastic surgery. There's another ""force"" battling Rosie and it is Mother Nature herself (Tracey Ullman,Corpse Bride) come to life in the form of a nymph-like creature that talks to Rosie about the need to follow nature's path.The Mother Nature portions of the story are undoubtedly the weakest and easily could've been tossed out without losing anything within the story of I COULD NEVER BE YOUR WOMAN.The outlandish dancing and over-acting of Paul Rudd helped keep the story light and laugh-out-loud interesting. Even Lovitz was a bit of a surprise in that he helped move the storyline along with some decent comedic punch.But if you're looking for anything new within the genre, you won't find it here.

The spectacular Dance sequence, and his intro sequence are worth the cost of the DVD.

The Chemistry between them does not work (unlike Object of My affection with Jennifer).  The story line about the secretary has been told a thousand times before - so it does not work with any credibility.  Nevertheless Paul Rudd is amazing - and I trust that his star will continue to shine.  the scenes of his screen tests (look at the bags under his eyes, make him dress in the same colour so that he looks thin) are hilarioius and remind me of the Judy Garland makeup sessions in A STAR IS BORN.

1124932,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00109KN0M,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 12]","Even before the obligatory clip is shown ofThe Graduate, I was thinking how great Michelle Pfeiffer would be as the predatory Mrs. Robinson in a remake. Unfortunately, while the plot takes its cues from the complications of an older woman-younger man affair, there is little else that director/screenwriter Amy Heckerling's 2007 comedy has in common with Mike Nichols's seminal 1967 classic except for a mostly winning cast. The whole venture feels very scattered and rather dated in its cultural references (the production was shelved for over two years), and Brian Tufano's washed-out cinematography, in particular when the lens is on Pfeiffer, is disappointing. On the upside is Pfeiffer herself, who manages to look sensational at 47 despite the technical deficiencies and appears relaxed and assured despite the unimaginative ways Heckerling drives the clich&eacute;-driven story.Set in LA (though filmed primarily in London), the film stars Pfeiffer as Rosie, both a successful TV sitcom producer in a cruelly youth-oriented industry and a recently divorced mother raising her adolescent daughter Izzie through puberty. Similar to the set-up of Jake Kasdan'sThe TV Set, Rosie uses her daughter as a litmus test for a teen sitcom called ""You Go Girl"", which seems like a cross betweenSaved by the BellandThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. In a casting call, she meets the boyishly charming Adam, and sparks inevitably fly despite an age gap of at least fifteen years. Naturally, complications ensue when Adam becomes a breakout star. Moreover, throughout the story, Rosie's conscience shows up in the scabrous form of Mother Nature who is lightning-quick with her ""I-told-you-so"" invectives.There are a variety of supporting characters and subplots to track in this melee, much the same way Heckerling handled the shenanigans in her fondly rememberedFast Times at Ridgemont High. One funny conceit that Heckerling exploits is the casting of jaded older actors as the teens in the sitcom, and in that spirit, she recruits Stacey Dash and Paul Rudd, both from 1995'sClueless, to play two of the actors. At forty, Dash looks great and completely convinces as a self-absorbed Lindsay/Britney-wannabe. Showing off the comic chops he displayed with aplomb in Judd Apatow's mega-comedies,The 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up, Rudd steps up to the plate as Adam and has genuine chemistry with Pfeiffer. As Izzie, Saoirse Ronan (currently winning raves in Joe Wright's Atonement) is terrifically winsome.Smaller roles are filled in expertly by Jon Lovitz as Rosie's surgery-obsessed ex-husband, Fred Willard as a nasty network suit, and Sarah Alexander (who played one of Pfeiffer's witchy sisters inStardust) as an unscrupulous secretary. While I generally like Tracey Ullman a lot, her role as Mother Nature feels so wedged in that I just wish Heckerling could have trusted the material more to avoid such a tired movie ploy. Lastly, the production company apparently did such a poor job brokering the film that it went straight to DVD without a theatrical release, a shame since Pfeiffer, Rudd and Heckerling all deserve better. The extras on the 2008 package are rather spartan with Heckerling and producer Cerise Hallam Larkin providing a genial, ramshackle commentary track. There are also three deleted scenes, as well as the trailer which I assume was never shown in theaters.",3,"A Winning Cast Led by a Welcome Pfeiffer Is Cast Adrift in a Scattered, Inconsequential Comedy",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,3373,"['Even', 'obligatory', 'clip', 'shown', 'ofThe', 'Graduate', 'was', 'thinking', 'how', 'great', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'would', 'be', 'predatory', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'remake', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'cues', 'complications', 'older', 'woman-younger', 'man', 'affair', 'little', 'else', 'director/screenwriter', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', '2007', 'comedy', 'common', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'seminal', '1967', 'classic', 'mostly', 'winning', 'cast', 'whole', 'venture', 'feels', 'very', 'scattered', 'rather', 'dated', 'cultural', 'references', 'production', 'was', 'shelved', 'two', 'years', 'Brian', 'Tufano', 'washed-out', 'cinematography', 'particular', 'when', 'lens', 'Pfeiffer', 'disappointing', 'upside', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'look', 'sensational', '47', 'technical', 'deficiencies', 'relaxed', 'assured', 'unimaginative', 'ways', 'Heckerling', 'clich', 'eacute', '-driven', 'story.Set', 'LA', 'filmed', 'primarily', 'London', 'film', 'stars', 'Pfeiffer', 'Rosie', 'successful', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'producer', 'cruelly', 'youth-oriented', 'industry', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'raising', 'adolescent', 'daughter', 'Izzie', 'puberty', 'Similar', 'set-up', 'Jake', ""Kasdan'sThe"", 'TV', 'Set', 'Rosie', 'daughter', 'litmus', 'test', 'teen', 'sitcom', 'called', 'Go', 'Girl', 'cross', 'betweenSaved', 'BellandThe', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'casting', 'call', 'boyishly', 'charming', 'Adam', 'inevitably', 'fly', 'age', 'gap', 'least', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Naturally', 'complications', 'ensue', 'when', 'Adam', 'breakout', 'star', 'Moreover', 'story', 'Rosie', 'conscience', 'up', 'scabrous', 'form', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'who', 'lightning-quick', 'I-told-you-so', 'are', 'variety', 'supporting', 'characters', 'subplots', 'track', 'melee', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Heckerling', 'handled', 'shenanigans', 'fondly', 'rememberedFast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'One', 'funny', 'conceit', 'Heckerling', 'exploits', 'casting', 'jaded', 'older', 'actors', 'teens', 'sitcom', 'spirit', 'Stacey', 'Dash', 'Paul', 'Rudd', ""1995'sClueless"", 'play', 'two', 'actors', 'forty', 'Dash', 'great', 'completely', 'convinces', 'self-absorbed', 'Lindsay/Britney-wannabe', 'Showing', 'off', 'comic', 'chops', 'displayed', 'aplomb', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'mega-comedies', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Up', 'Rudd', 'up', 'plate', 'Adam', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'Pfeiffer', 'Izzie', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'currently', 'winning', 'raves', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Atonement', 'terrifically', 'winsome.Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'expertly', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Rosie', 'surgery-obsessed', 'ex-husband', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'nasty', 'network', 'suit', 'Sarah', 'Alexander', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'Pfeiffer', 'witchy', 'sisters', 'inStardust', 'unscrupulous', 'secretary', 'generally', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'lot', 'role', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'so', 'wedged', 'just', 'wish', 'Heckerling', 'could', 'have', 'trusted', 'material', 'more', 'avoid', 'tired', 'movie', 'ploy', 'Lastly', 'production', 'company', 'apparently', 'did', 'such', 'poor', 'job', 'brokering', 'film', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'release', 'shame', 'Pfeiffer', 'Rudd', 'Heckerling', 'deserve', 'better', 'extras', '2008', 'package', 'are', 'rather', 'spartan', 'Heckerling', 'producer', 'Cerise', 'Hallam', 'Larkin', 'providing', 'genial', 'ramshackle', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'trailer', 'assume', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'theaters']",N/A

Straight to DVD is where it belongs, no matter what Entertainment Weekly tells you.  (They had an interesting article recently on this movie and why it was denied theatrical release.  The article was a lot more interesting than this awful movie.)The main problem is the script.  It's not funny.  I laughed a couple of times, but that was mostly in Paul Rudd's dance scene.  I'm a huge fan of his, but even his massive amounts of charm, talent and dorky good looks could not save this movie.  He and Saoirse Ronan were the only things that kept this movie from getting just one star.  She's a very good young actress, and it was refreshing to see a normal kid in a movie, and not one who has to be extra-cute or weirdly precocious.The worst part of this movie is Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature.  She's the narrator who also talks to Michelle Pfeiffer's character when other people are around.  She's distracting, she's overly lit and she's not remotely funny.  I don't know if they were trying to make her physically tolerable or ""ethereal"" by lighting her face up like a pinball machine, but either way, Ullman as an actress is UNBEARABLE.  Maybe she's funny with her own material, but it's hard to believe that anyone thought she'd really be good in this role.I am sorry that Amy Heckerling's career has come to this.  I am and always will be a huge fan ofClueless (Special Whatever! Edition), but even though she got half the cast from that movie to appear in this one, it's not even a fourth as good.  She obviously has statements she wants to make about women in modern society and how they're treated.  The parody songs Ronan sings are amusing, but I prefer it when a movie doesn't try to whack you over the head with its political agenda.The deleted scenes are boring, and deleted for good reason.  The trailer is terrible, and another reason this movie wouldn't have gotten very far in theaters if it had been given a release.  And the director's commentary is boring, a must to avoid.

This film was just beginning, and I don't know why, I was just so appalled by the spectacle of Tracey Ullman as ""Mother Nature"" insisting on the primacy of Nature and reproduction over civilization, illustrated with horrid, graphic photos of people being prepped for plastic surgery, then the way they look afterwards like Nicollette Sheridan, well, I just lost track of time.  My wife came in, opera tickets and gloves in her hand, and sat down on the chair beside me, intrigued by the bizarre, early cinema look of the cinematography, that made everyone look overexposed.  Before we knew it the movie had introduced Michelle Pfeiffer as Rosie, the LA-based producer of the imaginary sitcom ""You Go Girl,"" and little Saoirse Ronan as her daughter Izzy, and the next thing I knew, it was about forty five minutes later and for all I know, the fat lady sang without us.The movie is without a doubt one of the best Michelle Pfeiffer has ever appeared in, but I can see that other reviewers have mixed opinions, which I'm trying to understand.  Give Amy Heckerling credit for trying something new.  And yes, she does mix in some agitprop, the scene where Pfeiffer slugs the affected casting agent who thinks Meg ryan and Sharon Stone too old for the movies is like something from a Lizzie Borden film.  But hey, romantic comedy is big enough for politics too, it's not some tiny little category that can only take the sweet.In fact we liked the show so much I wish it was a whole TV series of its own.

The chemistry between Michelle Pfeiffer's Rosie and Paul Rudd's Adam seemed real, if not steamy, certainly funny.  Pfeiffer has three Oscar nominations (""Dangerous Liaisons,"" ""The Fabulous Baker Boys,"" ""Love Fields"") without a win.  Her gorgeous looks and lighthearted disposition serve her well in the film.  Paul Rudd who was inThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition)is HYSTERICAL!

Saoirse Ronan plays Rosie's daughter Izzie.  This was her first film before her Oscar-nominated role inAtonement (Widescreen Edition).  Her final song in the film is an exquisite scene stealer.  Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature plays the oddly present role with comic flair.  Jon Lovitz as Rosie's ex-husband Nathan is great as he keeps stealing vases and other things from her house.  Stacey Dash who was in ""Clueless"" plays the prima donna sit-com star with ludicrous intensity.  Sarah Alexander who worked with Pfeiffer inStardust (Widescreen Edition)plays the devious secretary who tries to short-circuit the Rosie/Adam love affair.

1124948,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00109KN0M,Only-A-Child,"[4, 4]","If not exactly a one-hit wonder, Amy Heckerling is certainly a mystery. After directing the highly successful ""Fast Times at Ridgement High (1982) and writing/directing an excellent modern adaptation of Jane Austins's ""Emma""- insert ""Clueless"" (1995) here - it appeared that she had a unique connection with both teenage viewers and those nostalgic about their teenage years.Then she spectacularly crashed and burned with the appropriately named ""Loser"" (2000). That career breaker would be in the running for a ""worst film of all time"" designation, were it not for its modest scale. Nonetheless it exposed huge deficiencies in Heckerling's writing talents, acting for the camera directing skills, and basic judgment.Six years and no films later she was finally able to cobble together another modest scale film ""I Could Never Be Your Woman"", which is much closer to ""Loser"" in concept and execution than to her successful films.Heckerling is at heart an expressionistic movie-maker; a fine quality except that mainstream audiences, used to a steady diet of movie realism, sometimes just don't get it. Her two main successes were situations where the surreal stuff was an ironic undercurrent masked by a realistic facade. With ""Loser"" her elements went out of balance and she repeats this same mistake in the main storyline here; a blend of the Hollywood insider story Altman did so well in ""The Player"" and the standard Lifetime Channel exploration of female angst, aging, and discontent.Fortunately there is parallel storyline involving the main character's middle school daughter, which allows Heckerling to get back to what she does best. And even more fortunate is the casting of newcomer Saoirse Ronan in this role. Ronan has since broken out with her Oscar nominated performance in ""Atonement"" (2007). ""I Could Never Be You Woman"" was her first feature film, which she easily steals. So much so that you are tempted to fast- forward through the scenes in which she is not present. Heckerling should have recognized what she had here and initiated major script revisions to amp up Ronan's screen time; especially more scenes of her playing off Paul Rudd (her mother's boyfriend) and Jon Lovitz (her father). Even so this will be become a minor cult classic on the strength of this one performance.Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd (who played Cher's stepbrother in ""Clueless"") play the film's May-December romantic couple. Their chemistry is not bad and the romance is mostly played for its comic qualities. This stuff is good enough to keep and certainly not one of the film's fatal weaknesses. These can be found in some ill-conceived expressionistic elements: Tracey Ullman as an extremely boring Mother Nature, Fred Willard as an unfunny version of his Ron Albertson ""Waiting for Guffman"" (1996) character, and Sarah Alexander as a kind of concentration of all the irritating qualities of Jenny McCarthy. The one expressionistic element that does work is the ""Head of the Class"" style television show that Pfeiffer's character is producing; complete with tacky production design and middle age actors playing high school students.The film might just be the highest-profile motion picture ever to take the direct-to-DVD route, due to bad financial practices rather than the marketability of the final product. Then again when you try to figure out the film's target audience you realize that it is even narrower than the standard ""chick flick"", and unlike Heckerling's hit films there is nothing here of interest to the teen demographic.Rosie (Pfeiffer) is a middle age TV writer/producer whose once popular TV series needs a talent transfusion, and whose main occupation seems to be staying young. Adam (Rudd), a 28 year-old actor, is added to the cast and it is quickly apparent that he and Rosie are soul mates despite the age differential. Middle school daughter Izzie (Ronan) has a crush on a boy at her school and Rosie must adjust to her daughter growing up.

1124949,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00109KN0M,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[3, 4]","I Could Never Be Your Woman has got to be one of the most corny films to date from Writer and Director Amy Heckerling (Fast Times At Ridgemont High and Clueless fame).  It is an unusual film that pairs seasoned actress, Michelle Pfeiffer (Rosie) with astoundingly quirky actor, Paul Rudd (Adam).  Thus far, Rudd's almost improvised performance is genuine and the highlight of the film.The film focuses on Rosie, a forty-something divorced single mom and Hollywood TV producer who happens to fall head over heels for Adam, a late twenty-something up and coming comic-actor, during the production of a teen oriented sitcom, ""You Go Girl,"" which is somewhat a play on the 1990s show ""Saved By The Bell.""  While Rosie is going through the motions of having to deal with the generation gap between she and Adam, she also has to deal with her daughter, Izzie (Saoirse Ronan) who is experiencing her growing pains of maturity from a little girl to a young woman.  Also in the film is Jon Lovitz (Nathan) who plays the ex-husband who passes his time going through one cosmetic surgery after another and Tracey Ullman who plays the doting Mother Nature character who resembles the 1970s Chiffon margarine commercial Mother Nature.And with most romantic comedies, all fairs well in the end.  There is plenty of comic relief from Rudd, which keeps the film rolling along with a barrel full of laughs; undoubtedly he is hilarious in the dance scene, and it appears that the rest of the cast looked like they were having fun making the film too. But as a forewarning, the opening credits may make one cringe with the sight of the Hollywood past time of makeovers cavorting the screen.  Otherwise, this straight to DVD film most likely will appeal to many viewers.",3,Hamming it up for the cameras,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,1750,"['Could', 'Never', 'Be', 'Your', 'Woman', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'corny', 'films', 'date', 'Writer', 'Director', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Clueless', 'fame', 'unusual', 'film', 'pairs', 'seasoned', 'actress', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Rosie', 'astoundingly', 'quirky', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Adam', 'Thus', 'far', 'Rudd', 'almost', 'improvised', 'performance', 'genuine', 'highlight', 'film.The', 'film', 'Rosie', 'forty-something', 'divorced', 'single', 'mom', 'Hollywood', 'TV', 'producer', 'who', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'Adam', 'late', 'twenty-something', 'up', 'coming', 'comic-actor', 'production', 'teen', 'oriented', 'sitcom', 'Go', 'Girl', 'somewhat', 'play', '1990s', 'show', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'Rosie', 'going', 'motions', 'having', 'deal', 'generation', 'gap', 'Adam', 'also', 'deal', 'daughter', 'Izzie', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'experiencing', 'growing', 'pains', 'maturity', 'little', 'girl', 'young', 'woman', 'Also', 'film', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Nathan', 'who', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'time', 'going', 'one', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'who', 'doting', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'character', 'who', '1970s', 'Chiffon', 'margarine', 'commercial', 'Mother', 'Nature.And', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'fairs', 'well', 'end', 'plenty', 'comic', 'relief', 'Rudd', 'film', 'rolling', 'along', 'barrel', 'full', 'laughs', 'undoubtedly', 'hilarious', 'dance', 'scene', 'rest', 'cast', 'looked', 'were', 'having', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'too', 'forewarning', 'opening', 'credits', 'may', 'make', 'one', 'cringe', 'sight', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'time', 'makeovers', 'cavorting', 'screen', 'Otherwise', 'straight', 'DVD', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'viewers']",N/A
1124950,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00109KN0M,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Rosie (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a 40 year old single mom writing for an urban high school T.V. show. Her preteen daughter Izzie (Saorise Ronan) is deep into her first crush and Rosie does her best to coach her through it. She hasn't had much experience in that field since splitting with her ex husband (Jon Lovitz). All of that changes when she meets an actor named Adam (Paul Rudd) who auditions for a part on the show. He's a goofy guy and Rosie is attracted to him immediately. Adam is likewise smitten and starts flirting with her. Rosie is put off by this but even more worried about the age difference between them: Adam is only 29. She eventually gives in and the two start dating. Rosie still has her reservations but she slowly opens up to Adam's charm and lets loose. Things go well for the new couple until Rosie's spiteful assistant doctors some photos to make it look like Adam is seeing the show's star (Stacey Dash). This development proves too much to handle for an already insecure Rosie and she ends their relationship. This is where the movie stops being fun and clever. Cue the endless montage (set to the Cure) of Adam trying to win her back. The film loses any of it's wit and intelligence and becomes another by the numbers romantic comedy. This is only one of the film's many problems. For one, the leads don't quite work. Pfeiffer is still beautiful but her character is too insecure and grows grating whenever bringing up the age difference. Rudd is way too goofy and over the top. I assume Heckerling was trying to get him to be charming but she gets him to be annoying. What works the best is the performance of Ronan as Izzie. She steals the show with her intelligence and humor. The supporting cast, consisting of Lovitz, Dash, Graham Norton, and Fred Willard, shoulder the burden and provide lots of the laughs whenever Rosie and Adam are bickering. The character that needed to be cut completely is that of Mother Nature played by Tracey Ullman. Ullman is funny and her introductory scene is amusing but after that anytime she appears it's only to put down Rosie and make her more insecure. It drags the movie down. All of these elements make this film such a frustrating watch because it has so much talent in front and behind the camera. Amy Heckerling, whose 'Clueless' was so smart and funny, got screwed on this one. The producers promised her a theatrical release but then reneged at the last minute and dumped the film on DVD. I honestly don't know if it would have worked in theaters or what kind of reviews it would have gotten. It would have been interesting to find out. As it stands it's certainly flawed and frustrating but it's definitely more intelligent and better cast than any of the romantic comedies that do find their way to theaters each week.",3,Wanted to Like It More,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2795,"['Rosie', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', '40', 'year', 'old', 'single', 'mom', 'writing', 'urban', 'high', 'school', 'T.V', 'show', 'preteen', 'daughter', 'Izzie', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'deep', 'first', 'crush', 'Rosie', 'best', 'coach', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'experience', 'field', 'splitting', 'ex', 'husband', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'changes', 'when', 'actor', 'named', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'part', 'show', 'goofy', 'guy', 'Rosie', 'attracted', 'immediately', 'Adam', 'likewise', 'smitten', 'flirting', 'Rosie', 'put', 'off', 'even', 'more', 'worried', 'age', 'difference', 'Adam', 'only', '29', 'eventually', 'two', 'start', 'dating', 'Rosie', 'still', 'reservations', 'slowly', 'up', 'Adam', 'charm', 'lets', 'loose', 'Things', 'go', 'well', 'new', 'couple', 'Rosie', 'spiteful', 'assistant', 'doctors', 'photos', 'make', 'look', 'Adam', 'seeing', 'show', 'star', 'Stacey', 'Dash', 'development', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'already', 'insecure', 'Rosie', 'relationship', 'where', 'movie', 'being', 'fun', 'clever', 'Cue', 'endless', 'montage', 'set', 'Cure', 'Adam', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'film', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'numbers', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'problems', 'one', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Pfeiffer', 'still', 'beautiful', 'character', 'too', 'insecure', 'grating', 'whenever', 'bringing', 'up', 'age', 'difference', 'Rudd', 'way', 'too', 'goofy', 'top', 'assume', 'Heckerling', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'be', 'charming', 'be', 'annoying', 'What', 'best', 'performance', 'Ronan', 'Izzie', 'steals', 'show', 'intelligence', 'humor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Lovitz', 'Dash', 'Graham', 'Norton', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'shoulder', 'burden', 'provide', 'lots', 'laughs', 'whenever', 'Rosie', 'Adam', 'are', 'bickering', 'character', 'needed', 'be', 'cut', 'completely', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'played', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Ullman', 'funny', 'introductory', 'scene', 'amusing', 'anytime', 'only', 'put', 'down', 'Rosie', 'make', 'more', 'insecure', 'movie', 'down', 'elements', 'make', 'film', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', ""'Clueless"", 'was', 'so', 'smart', 'funny', 'got', 'screwed', 'one', 'producers', 'promised', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'reneged', 'last', 'minute', 'dumped', 'film', 'DVD', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'theaters', 'what', 'kind', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'certainly', 'flawed', 'frustrating', 'definitely', 'more', 'intelligent', 'better', 'cast', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'do', 'find', 'way', 'theaters', 'week']",N/A

It was so hard to sit through the excruciating 97 minutes that I had to pause the movie and flip to CNN a few times just to give my brain a jump-start. And after this movie one need never see another one with Tracey Ullman (who must have used up all her talent somewhere else and was out-performed here by Jon Lovitz(!).
