733100,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B000083C7Z,J. Lizzi,"[78, 80]","Simply put, this is the Dixie Chicks performing their latest CD, ""Home.""  When I got this DVD, I had not yet heard any of the songs from the CD save for their cover of ""Landslide,"" but I still enjoyed the music and had a great time watching the Chicks perform.  They display excellent musical versatility (supporting band included), mixed with fun songs and a great rapport with the audience.This performance was recorded on August 16, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, just weeks after ""Home"" was released.  The Chicks play every one of the twelve songs from the CD in the exact same order.  This might be a plus for those who are already in the habit of listening to the entire CD, so you'll know what to expect.  For me, I appreciated the way the songs were introduced, as explained most often by lead vocalist Natalie Maines.  In addition to the ""Home"" songs, there are four others:  three from the previous CD, ""Fly,"" plus the title track to ""Wide Open Spaces.""  Overall, the song count is seven more than what was seen on the original television broadcast.  I would have preferred that the three albums were more equally represented, but I guess the point was to promote ""Home"" so . . . they gave us the whole thing!  The Dixie Chicks are known for engaging the crowd, and that was definitely the case here.  The crowd at the Kodak was definitely amped throughout the performance, and I was equally drawn in.In terms of sound quality, this is a top-notch DVD.  The mixers (one of whom was Lloyd Maines, Natalie's dad and a member of the band) did a virtually perfect job of balancing all the instrumentation so that not one musician either got drowned out or overwhelmed any of the others.  I was perfectly content to have my system set on CD Stereo and to listen to superb sound through a nice subwoofer and satellite system.  Dolby 5.1 is also available.The camera work was excellent and highlighted a multitude of angles and perspectives.  My only [slightly] negative criticism is with the video editing, which was far too rapid for my taste.  Too many times, the camera selection changed faster than once per measure, which, over entire songs, became a little dizzying.  The good news is that the DVD picture quality is awesome:  sharp images and vivid colors.  Extra features include a biography, discography and a twelve-page liner note booklet.",5,"Very enjoyable LIVE performance of the ""Home"" album",1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2364,"['Simply', 'put', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'performing', 'latest', 'CD', 'Home', 'When', 'got', 'DVD', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'heard', 'songs', 'CD', 'save', 'cover', 'Landslide', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Chicks', 'perform', 'display', 'excellent', 'musical', 'versatility', 'supporting', 'band', 'included', 'mixed', 'fun', 'songs', 'great', 'rapport', 'audience.This', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'August', '16', '2002', 'Kodak', 'Theatre', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'weeks', 'Home', 'was', 'released', 'Chicks', 'play', 'one', 'twelve', 'songs', 'CD', 'exact', 'same', 'order', 'might', 'be', 'plus', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'habit', 'listening', 'entire', 'CD', 'so', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'appreciated', 'way', 'songs', 'were', 'introduced', 'explained', 'most', 'often', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'Natalie', 'Maines', 'addition', 'Home', 'songs', 'are', 'four', 'others', 'three', 'previous', 'CD', 'Fly', 'title', 'track', 'Wide', 'Open', 'Spaces', 'Overall', 'song', 'count', 'seven', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'original', 'television', 'broadcast', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'three', 'albums', 'were', 'more', 'equally', 'represented', 'guess', 'point', 'was', 'promote', 'Home', 'so', 'gave', 'whole', 'thing', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'are', 'known', 'engaging', 'crowd', 'was', 'definitely', 'case', 'here', 'crowd', 'Kodak', 'was', 'definitely', 'amped', 'performance', 'was', 'equally', 'drawn', 'in.In', 'terms', 'sound', 'quality', 'top-notch', 'DVD', 'mixers', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'Lloyd', 'Maines', 'Natalie', 'dad', 'member', 'band', 'did', 'virtually', 'perfect', 'job', 'balancing', 'instrumentation', 'so', 'not', 'one', 'musician', 'got', 'drowned', 'out', 'overwhelmed', 'others', 'was', 'perfectly', 'content', 'have', 'system', 'set', 'CD', 'Stereo', 'listen', 'superb', 'sound', 'nice', 'subwoofer', 'satellite', 'system', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'also', 'available.The', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'excellent', 'highlighted', 'multitude', 'angles', 'perspectives', 'only', '[', 'slightly', ']', 'negative', 'criticism', 'video', 'editing', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'rapid', 'taste', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'camera', 'selection', 'changed', 'faster', 'once', 'measure', 'entire', 'songs', 'became', 'little', 'dizzying', 'good', 'news', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'awesome', 'sharp', 'images', 'vivid', 'colors', 'Extra', 'features', 'include', 'biography', 'discography', 'twelve-page', 'liner', 'note', 'booklet']",N/A

That ladies and gentlemen takes a lot of guts.  It is a tribute to the talent of these women to see how well all of the songs go over, even though for the most part no one has ever heard them.  I love good musicians and Emily and Martie rank right up there with some of the best.  Because this is essentially an unplugged concert both women truly shine and there are plenty of moments where they demonstrate their instrumental prowess.Natalie has only improved as a performer.  I thought she was tentative in the early days of the Chicks, but those days are gone.  She has great stage presence and has the audience completely enthralled with every word.  It is also easy to see how this very outspoken woman often gets herself in trouble.  In the intro to Godspeed she starts off on a tirade about parental rights in Tennessee and quickly stops herself.  I think we all got her point anyway, which makes the whole Chicks/President Bush thing even more absurd.  Yes, she is outspoken and yes she is going to say things that can be controversial. But folks, that's America and that's freedom.  I hope she never tones it down.The only negatives I have with the DVD are the camera work.  The cameraperson on the right front seems to have a problem with balance.  Everytime they switch to that camera it is wobbling all over the place(think Blair Witch project).  Fortunately the producer realizes that also and after a few songs they give up on him(or her).  Some fans will be dissapointed to see so many of the hits missing since this is mostly a celebration of the Home album, but sooner or later there will be another Chicks DVD and I have the feeling this is the only place you will ever hear some of these songs live.

Period!There is certainly a tinge of bluegrass (mostly in ""Long Tinme Gone""? I keep forgetting!) in their music, and being the professional and talented artistes they are, they have continually redefined their ""sound"" which is not a bad thing at all! How many times have we heard of those pop-bands that sound all alike (and we're not talking across albums, but across bands!!!)The tracks I like a lot are (I like all of them actually) ""Travelin' Soldier"", ""A Home"" (I really don't know what they meant by ""DVD/Video Version""???), ""More Love"", ""Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)"", ""Top Of The World"".The playlist here at Amazon.com mentioned ""Live From the Kodak Theater"" which seems to suggest that they played at different venues. But, for the life of me, I couldn't make out the difference; it all looked like one single venue performance to me.The ""old treats"" are as great as usual though I must admit I have never been a fan of ""Sin Wagon"".The interaction between the Chicks themselves, and with the audience were wonderful. The audience seem to go wild everytime Martie does that thing with her fiddle-n-a-violin.Coming to the fumbling: check out when the DVD time counter reads 1:02:37, ""Top of the world"". Natalie croones ""I wish I could have stood, where you ..."" and she fumbles the lyrics, mutters something unintelligible, and continues with the song! ha ha!The audio is available in 16-bit PCM format (CD Stereo format) as well as Dolby Digital 5.1. The sound is extra clear and refined in the PCM mode while the Dolby format itself does a commendable job. The channel seperation in Dolby 5.1 is satisfactory with the audiences' claps and cheers taking up the surround channels and the vocals and instruments dominating the front three channels. Personally, I prefer the PCM audio stream which is clearer, sweeter, and leagues ahead of the Dolby stream!",5,Lovely DVD though Natalie fumbled the lyrics,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,2252,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'fans', '[', 'Hold', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'fumbling', 'end', 'review', ']', 'have', 'heard', 'lot', 'Home', 'album', 'being', 'departure', 'style', 'previous', 'two', 'albums', 'were', 'fears', 'largely', 'unfounded', 'Chicks', 'might', 'lose', 'fans', 'earned', 'debut', 'sophomore', 'albums', 'perish', 'thought', 'Period', 'certainly', 'tinge', 'bluegrass', 'mostly', 'Long', 'Tinme', 'Gone', 'keep', 'forgetting', 'music', 'being', 'professional', 'talented', 'artistes', 'are', 'have', 'continually', 'redefined', 'sound', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'heard', 'pop-bands', 'sound', 'alike', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'albums', 'bands', 'tracks', 'like', 'lot', 'are', 'like', 'actually', 'Travelin', 'Soldier', 'Home', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'meant', 'DVD/Video', 'Version', 'More', 'Love', 'Godspeed', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'Top', 'World', '.The', 'playlist', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'mentioned', 'Live', 'Kodak', 'Theater', 'suggest', 'played', 'different', 'venues', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'difference', 'looked', 'one', 'single', 'venue', 'performance', 'me.The', 'old', 'treats', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'usual', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Sin', 'Wagon', 'interaction', 'Chicks', 'audience', 'were', 'wonderful', 'audience', 'seem', 'go', 'wild', 'everytime', 'Martie', 'thing', 'fiddle-n-a-violin.Coming', 'fumbling', 'check', 'when', 'DVD', 'time', 'counter', '1:02:37', 'Top', 'world', 'Natalie', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'where', 'lyrics', 'mutters', 'something', 'unintelligible', 'song', 'ha', 'ha', 'audio', 'available', '16-bit', 'PCM', 'format', 'CD', 'Stereo', 'format', 'as', 'well', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'extra', 'clear', 'refined', 'PCM', 'mode', 'Dolby', 'format', 'commendable', 'job', 'channel', 'seperation', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'satisfactory', 'audiences', 'claps', 'cheers', 'taking', 'up', 'surround', 'channels', 'vocals', 'instruments', 'dominating', 'front', 'three', 'channels', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'PCM', 'audio', 'stream', 'clearer', 'sweeter', 'ahead', 'Dolby', 'stream']",N/A
