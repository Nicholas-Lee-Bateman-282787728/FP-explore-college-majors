675470,AHHO5V9W8M58Z,B00005QJJC,Daniel Hoenisch,"[23, 23]","This is actually a really good movie.  It's a made for T.V. movie.  I saw it for the first time on Lifetime, which isn't a station I would normally watch.  It's a movie based on alien abductions.  A mother and daughter are confronted with this.  At first, it starts with the daughter's loss of time and memory.  Later on in the movie, the mother goes to counceling and finds that she was abducted as well.  The plot thickens, but I would really hate to give it away.  This would probably be a good movie for anyone interested in aliens.  I'd say for the price of the DVD $$$go for it.  There aren't any extras on this DVD, but I would assume there would be on the one that will cost you a little more $$$",4,Very Well Done,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,704,"['actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'T.V', 'movie', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'Lifetime', ""n't"", 'station', 'would', 'normally', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'alien', 'abductions', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'confronted', 'first', 'daughter', 'loss', 'time', 'memory', 'Later', 'movie', 'mother', 'counceling', 'finds', 'was', 'abducted', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'thickens', 'would', 'really', 'hate', 'give', 'away', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'aliens', ""'d"", 'say', 'price', 'DVD', 'go', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'DVD', 'would', 'assume', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'cost', 'little', 'more']",Visitors of the Night

I don't know about the rest of you- but I remember when they made fantastic movies for television. The networks don't do it anymore. I guess things have changed. This one grabs you from the very beginning with the horses running wild in the streets - but, from WHAT? Markie and Candace are both so lovely, and a very believable Mom and daughter, and the always way more than adequate Dale Midkiff as the Sheriff and would be suitor for Mom. The acting is first rate, even ""Elvis"" the family dog, the sets are lush and beautiful, but also very small town and ""folksey"". But there is something very, very sinister going on! There is alot of suspense, then resolution - then wait, that's it - a truly SHOCKING end that I did not see coming! I know I haven't really given too much away about the plot. When I watch this and other great made for TV movies I have purchased on DVD an absolute WAVE of nostalgia washes over me for some sentimental reason.

675477,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00005QJJC,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 0]","I've read that VISITORS OF THE NIGHT was a made-for-cable TV move. Specifically, it was made for the Lifetime -- ""Television for Women"" -- Channel.Alas, it shows. Being a TV movie it's fullscreen, but I can live with that. Worse, however, is that the ""horror"" is diluted by the domestic drama.Judith (Night Court's Markie Post) is a single mom who has nightmares about being abducted by aliens as a child. Now her own daughter, Katie, is wandering off at night, returning with blackouts, so she has no idea where she's been. Katie only recalls just having left the house -- yet it's three hours later! (Of course, we know Katie's being abducted by aliens too -- like mother like daughter.)This being a 1995 TV movie (shot in Canada), I suppose it was an attempt to cash-in onThe X-Files, which was very hot at the time. However, this also being a Lifetime TV movie, there's no gore and scant scares.I don't need gore for my horror, butThe X-Fileshad much creepy tension and suspense. VISITORS OF THE NIGHT, not so much. Instead there's much domestic drama. Mother and daughter argue a lot, a result of their fears from suppressed memories of alien abduction. Occasionally, one of them wanders into a light, but that's mostly it for ""scares.""We do FINALLY get aboard the alien spacecraft. It's potentially scary, at first. But it falls apart into the sort of crappy ""feel good"" message to be found inE.T.orCocoon. Seems these aliens aren't so bad after all. Judith explains love to them, and how it's wrong to separate people, especially a mother and child.This being a Lifetime movie, the women come off better than the men. Judith's divorced hubby is consumed with his career, never around. He's running for City Council. Luckily for him, his smart daughter turns his campaign around by educating him about environmental issues.VISITORS OF THE NIGHT has lots of ""feel-good"" messages. But not so many scares.If you're looking for alien abduction scares, the best film remainsFire in the Sky, althoughThe Fourth Kindis also very good.",2,a little too warm & fuzzy & feel-good,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,2033,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'VISITORS', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'was', 'made-for-cable', 'TV', 'move', 'Specifically', 'was', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'Television', 'Women', 'Channel.Alas', 'Being', 'TV', 'movie', 'fullscreen', 'can', 'live', 'Worse', 'however', 'horror', 'diluted', 'domestic', 'drama.Judith', 'Night', 'Court', 'Markie', 'Post', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'nightmares', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'child', 'Now', 'own', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'wandering', 'off', 'night', 'returning', 'blackouts', 'idea', 'where', 'been', 'Katie', 'only', 'just', 'having', 'left', 'house', 'three', 'hours', 'later', 'course', 'know', 'Katie', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'too', 'mother', 'daughter', 'being', '1995', 'TV', 'movie', 'shot', 'Canada', 'suppose', 'was', 'attempt', 'cash-in', 'onThe', 'X-Files', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'time', 'However', 'also', 'being', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'gore', 'scant', 'scares.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'gore', 'horror', 'butThe', 'X-Fileshad', 'much', 'creepy', 'tension', 'suspense', 'VISITORS', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Instead', 'much', 'domestic', 'drama', 'Mother', 'daughter', 'argue', 'lot', 'result', 'fears', 'suppressed', 'memories', 'alien', 'abduction', 'Occasionally', 'one', 'wanders', 'light', 'mostly', 'scares', 'do', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'potentially', 'scary', 'first', 'apart', 'sort', 'crappy', 'feel', 'good', 'message', 'be', 'found', 'inE.T.orCocoon', 'aliens', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'Judith', 'love', 'how', 'wrong', 'separate', 'people', 'especially', 'mother', 'child.This', 'being', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'women', 'come', 'better', 'men', 'Judith', 'divorced', 'hubby', 'consumed', 'career', 'never', 'around', 'running', 'City', 'Council', 'Luckily', 'smart', 'daughter', 'campaign', 'around', 'educating', 'environmental', 'issues.VISITORS', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'lots', 'feel-good', 'messages', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'scares.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'alien', 'abduction', 'scares', 'best', 'film', 'remainsFire', 'Sky', 'althoughThe', 'Fourth', 'Kindis', 'also', 'very', 'good']",Visitors of the Night

Some outdoor scenes (highlights) are ""blown out"", i.e. too bright. Although I don't necessarily agree with the basic tenet of many screenplays in this genre that ""aliens from outer space"" are behind this phenomena, something paranormal is certainly occurring to these unfortunate victims. Could the lack of prayer be a reason why certain families are victimized by these entities? Lastly, ""Visitors In The Night"" would probably only be ""scary"" to a victim.
