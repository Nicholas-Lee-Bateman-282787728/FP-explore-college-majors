While only a modest hit, Wayne received good reviews, and Republic prepared it's own big-budget 'debut' for the new superstar, ""Dark Command"". This is an important title in Wayne's emerging career...(4 stars out of 5)""Reunion in France"" (1942): With most of Hollywood's leading men in uniform, Wayne's availability and rising popularity made him a very hot commodity, and MGM was quick to 'borrow' him for Joan Crawford's first 'war-themed' drama. While in a supporting role, he received billing above Crawford's actual leading man, Philip Dorn, and Wayne's image was LARGER than either Crawford or Dorn in much of the film's advertising! A routine film, but Wayne's presence guaranteed box office... (2 1/2 stars out of 5)""Without Reservations"" (1946): Released just months after the war's end, this RKO-Claudette Colbert vehicle, while not top-notch, was directed by the legendary Mervyn LeRoy, and provided the Duke a chance to do his first service comedy...and he was excellent! Teamed with veteran comic actor Don DeFore, he'd offer intellectual author Colbert a taste of the 'real world'; their growing romance, if convoluted, was charming...and don't miss Cary Grant's brief 'cameo'! (3 1/2 stars out of 5)""Tycoon"" (1947): Most of Wayne's films of the late forties were westerns, and this inept 'action/drama' may be a reason why! As an engineer dynamiting a railroad tunnel through a mountain, he steamrolls through romance and friendships to become the 'heel' he perfected in ""Pittsburgh"", and neither critics nor fans liked either him, or the film. It would take Howard Hawks to make Duke's 'dark side' believable, and sympathetic, in ""Red River"". (1 1/2 stars out of 5)""Big Jim McLain"" (1952): Wayne's 'love letter' to the House Un-American Activities Committee, and proof that ""Homeland Security"" isn't the first time the government has trampled on civil liberties in the name of patriotism. Duke attempted to justify the 'witch hunt' with this flag-waving piece of propaganda; Commies were all secret agents of the Kremlin, and Duke, at his brawling, romancing 'best', was the Committee investigator out to stop them, in Hawaii. It's sad, it's silly, but it does reflect the paranoia of the times...and offers a warning for today. (2 stars out of 5)""Trouble Along the Way"" (1953): Released 8 months after ""McLain"", this delightful comedy/drama, offering one of Wayne's most rounded performances, was largely ignored by critics. As a disgraced college coach who uses illegal methods to attempt to save a small Catholic school, and retain custody of his daughter, Wayne is completely natural and believable, with a first-rate cast and legendary director Michael Curtiz, in a small gem...(4 stars out of 5)If you want a more 'complete' view of the Duke, 'warts and all', away from his westerns and war movies, you'll never find a better collection!",4,A Centennial Birthday Present for John Wayne Fans!,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,3454,"['part', 'celebration', 'John', 'Wayne', '100th', 'birthday', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Film', 'Collection', 'unusual', 'fascinating', 'collection', 'titles', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'sight', 'not', 'best', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'Allegheny', 'Uprising', '1939', 'contract', 'Republic', 'much', 'Wayne', 'value', 'was', 'loan-out', 'other', 'studios', 'when', 'United', 'Artists', 'March', 'release', 'John', 'Ford', 'Stagecoach', 'was', 'hit', 'RKO', 'snapped', 'up', 're-teamed', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'prayed', ""'Colonial"", 'lightning', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'week', 'Ford', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'November', 'only', 'modest', 'hit', 'Wayne', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'Republic', 'prepared', 'own', 'big-budget', ""'debut"", 'new', 'superstar', 'Dark', 'Command', 'important', 'title', 'Wayne', 'emerging', 'career', '4', 'stars', '5', 'Reunion', 'France', '1942', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'men', 'uniform', 'Wayne', 'availability', 'rising', 'popularity', 'made', 'very', 'hot', 'commodity', 'MGM', 'was', 'quick', ""'borrow"", 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'first', ""'war-themed"", 'drama', 'supporting', 'role', 'received', 'billing', 'Crawford', 'actual', 'leading', 'man', 'Philip', 'Dorn', 'Wayne', 'image', 'was', 'LARGER', 'Crawford', 'Dorn', 'much', 'film', 'advertising', 'routine', 'film', 'Wayne', 'presence', 'guaranteed', 'box', 'office', '2', '1/2', 'stars', '5', 'Reservations', '1946', 'Released', 'just', 'months', 'war', 'end', 'RKO-Claudette', 'Colbert', 'vehicle', 'not', 'top-notch', 'was', 'directed', 'legendary', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'provided', 'Duke', 'chance', 'do', 'first', 'service', 'comedy', 'was', 'excellent', 'Teamed', 'veteran', 'comic', 'actor', 'Don', 'DeFore', ""'d"", 'offer', 'intellectual', 'author', 'Colbert', 'taste', ""'real"", 'world', 'growing', 'romance', 'convoluted', 'was', 'charming', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'brief', '3', '1/2', 'stars', '5', 'Tycoon', '1947', 'Most', 'Wayne', 'films', 'late', 'forties', 'were', 'westerns', 'inept', ""'action/drama"", 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'engineer', 'dynamiting', 'railroad', 'tunnel', 'mountain', 'romance', 'friendships', 'become', ""'heel"", 'perfected', 'Pittsburgh', 'critics', 'fans', 'liked', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'make', 'Duke', ""'dark"", 'side', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'Red', 'River', '1', '1/2', 'stars', '5', 'Big', 'Jim', 'McLain', '1952', 'Wayne', ""'love"", 'letter', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'proof', 'Homeland', 'Security', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'government', 'trampled', 'civil', 'liberties', 'name', 'patriotism', 'Duke', 'attempted', 'justify', ""'witch"", 'hunt', 'flag-waving', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'Commies', 'were', 'secret', 'agents', 'Kremlin', 'Duke', 'brawling', 'romancing', ""'best"", 'was', 'Committee', 'investigator', 'stop', 'Hawaii', 'sad', 'silly', 'reflect', 'paranoia', 'times', 'warning', 'today', '2', 'stars', '5', 'Trouble', 'Way', '1953', 'Released', '8', 'months', 'McLain', 'delightful', 'comedy/drama', 'offering', 'one', 'Wayne', 'most', 'rounded', 'performances', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'critics', 'disgraced', 'college', 'coach', 'who', 'illegal', 'methods', 'attempt', 'save', 'small', 'Catholic', 'school', 'retain', 'custody', 'daughter', 'Wayne', 'completely', 'natural', 'believable', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'legendary', 'director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'small', 'gem', '4', 'stars', '5', 'want', 'more', ""'complete"", 'view', 'Duke', ""'warts"", 'away', 'westerns', 'war', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'better', 'collection']",The John Wayne Film Collection (Without Reservations / Allegheny Uprising / Tycoon / Reunion in France / Big Jim McLain / and more)

1062156,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000O599XA,calvinnme,"[13, 14]","This is a good collection of perhaps lesser known films starring John Wayne that show a wide range of roles for the actor. This is not one of Warner Bros. ""Signature Collections"", so don't expect extras other than a vintage short and cartoon for each movie.""Allegheny Uprising""(1939) was made before Wayne's break-through role in ""Stagecoach"", but released afterwards, thus Claire Trevor is billed ahead of Wayne. Wayne actually didn't look back very fondly on this film or his role in it, but it has its good points. It's basically a western set east of the Mississippi concerning Pennsylvania settlers in pre-Revolutionary times who are angry that they are being attacked by Indians supplied by white traders. The settlers prevail upon the British to outlaw trading with the Indians, and the British oblige. The businessmen and the settlers go back and forth over this issue both inside and outside the law. The businessmen's sentiment - ""What's the government for if not to protect business? Certainly not to interfere with it!"" - is one that is still timely.""Reunion in France"" (1942) again has Wayne being second billed to the other lead, Joan Crawford. This is a film that was obviously targeting a wartime audience with the objective of building patriotism and morale, so you have to look at the miscasting in the context of the times. Joan Crawford plays a French woman who seems to be plumbing the depths of shallowness in her high-rolling lifestyle until the Germans invade. She returns to Paris to find her fancy home confiscated, her boyfriend helping the Germans, and her inner patriotism aroused. She runs across an RAF pilot (Wayne) who has been shot down, and she must play up to her boyfriend and his German friends in order to help Wayne evade capture. Forget the fact that the actors playing Frenchmen don't sound French, that Wayne doesn't sound British, and that the Germans are portrayed as not being smart enough to find Berlin on a map, and just have fun with it.""Without Reservations"" (1946) is a romantic comedy that is much like ""It Happened One Night"" with a twist - with Claudette Colbert even costarring. In this version, however, Colbert is playing an analog of  Gable's old role - she's an author - and Wayne is first the object of her professional attention and then her romantic attention. This doesn't sound like it could work on paper, but in the end Colbert and Wayne have amazing chemistry.""Tycoon"" (1947) was actually RKO's biggest failure of the year. This movie has Wayne playing an engineer who is building a railroad bridge across a gorge. He and his financier partner in this effort dislike each other intensely with spats that range from the inadequate financing of the project to the shotgun wedding of Wayne's character to the tycoon's daughter. This is where The Duke completely breaks from the hero he normally plays and acts like a spoiled child who believes that he who dies with the most toys wins. He and the tycoon's spat escalate to the point that sabotage is occuring and lives are being lost. There's some beautiful cinematography in this one, and although the plot just didn't work for me, Wayne's acting did. Most people don't like this film at least in part because Wayne convincingly plays someone completely unlikeable - and that's the point. He's given a role completely out of step with what he usually plays and does a good job.""Big Jim McLain"" (1952) has Wayne back playing the heroic patriotic persona that most of his fans will recognize. However, this is clearly a propaganda film that will have most people rolling their eyes in light of what has been revealed to be the truth about this episode in history. Thus, this is another Wayne film you must look at in the context of the times in which it was made. John Wayne plays the title role of Jim McLain, a federal agent working for the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee in search of a pesky ring of Communists believed to be operating in Hawaii. I resist the urge to call this movie good campy fun mainly because of all of the lives and careers that were ruined in the actual investigations. However, history aside, it is an entertaining film perhaps for all the wrong reasons. Notice that the people hunting the Communists are all good-looking, athletic, and well-liked while the Communists, on the other hand, look like they spent to much time indoors as children and are unlikeable introverted types. And Alan Napier, the beloved Alfred of the 60's Batman TV series, as the murderous Sturak? Holy (retrospective) strange casting decision Batman!""Trouble Along the Way"" (1953) shows the sentimental side of Wayne as he plays a former professional football coach recruited to put together a winning football team for a Catholic college that is short on funds. The head of the college, played by Charles Coburn, thinks that a winning football team is the thing to open the checkbooks of the alumni, and believes that Steve Williams (Wayne) is the man for the job. I was surprised to find that the old football quote ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing"" actually was first said by Wayne's character in this movie. The other plot in this film is that of Wayne trying to keep custody of his little daughter. Williams has to be employed to keep his ex-wife from winning her case, and Wayne's scenes with Sherry Jackson in the role of Williams' daughter are quite touching. To me, this film was the best of the six. It had many opportunities to turn into an melodramatic potboiler, and yet it didn't.This collection, purely on the merit of being six random films, would rate about four stars. On the merit of displaying the range of John Wayne's acting abilities in a wide variety of roles I would give it 4.5 stars. I round up to give it my five star rating.",5,Showcases John Wayne in a wide variety of roles,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,5796,"['good', 'collection', 'perhaps', 'lesser', 'known', 'films',

He plays a riveting role as a rebel bent on setting the wrong right with a strong cast of supports who pull you into this awesome story.The videoHere we have black and white Full frame its one of the better transfers simply because it was already restored once and colorized. It runs smoothly without grain or degradation of the picture.The AudioHere is a disappointment its only 1.0 mono where a 5.1 surround sound update would have really made this and epicThe ExtrasThe Bill of rightsA nice piece on the revolution it wasn't cleaned though and is a damaged print. It is in color and moves a long quite nicely. Shot in august of 1939 it runs 21 minutes and I didn't notice the time as it went.The Land of the Midnight FunA story of Alaska a cartoon of course which I surprising me personally I had never seen. It starts in New York on a cruise ship and ends in New York on a cruise ship.SummaryOf John Wayne's films this is a must have. It is and epic on par with gone with the wind. It moves at a pace that is solid its story is well written it is superbly acted and one I have watched many times before owning this DVD. The only thing I wonder why is missing on this DVD is the colorized print. Not a necessity but would have been a nice extra just to see the difference between the two.Trouble Along The WayThe MovieA story about saint andrews church. From the very begining its clear the plot is that st andrews church needs money and teh duke is the man they think can provide. He plays Steve a former football coach who was thrown out for being dishonest. He also has a daughter who he is raising.Along comes Donna Reed as a social worker and the plot thickens.The Videoit doesn't have the DisneyTreatment but is watchable on my 42 inch plasma. It has mments of grain and goes out of focus in some frames but its brief and barely a distraction.it is presented in. It is in Black & White and is full frame.The AudioIt is mono 1,0 nothing that is going to rattle the walls but it works for this movie.The ExtrasSo You Think You Can't Think Sleep.A charming story of a man who can't sleep its runs about 15 minutes and is very looney tunes. I enjoyed it not sure i watch it again but was entertaining once.Muscle TusleA Merrie melodies cartoon with daffy duckIts the one wher a muscle bound duck keeps stealing daffy's gall and he tries to beef up to compete. Most viewers have seen this one many timesTheatrilce TrailerLike most older trainlers it doesn't really tell you what the movie is about. It is not restored it looks very bad with the white blips but it is a piece of the dukeMy OpinionIt turns out to be one of the more enjoyable non cowboy pictures of the duke. I bought this in the six disc set. For those who have seen it is worth a new viewing for those who havn't its a worth while effort.Reunion in FranceThe MovieBasically it's the occupation of France with John Wayne in it. It on par with his B pictures it's not very well paced nor is it very interesting to watch. I personally think this may have been and attempt to squash the dukes guilt at not being able to serve in WWII. He is the only bright spot on this horrible movie.The VideoIn need of a restoration, it has some grain issues and focus problems. It is in black and white full frame and shows its age.The Audio1.0 mono no extra treatment hereThe ExtrasWe Do It BecauseA look at the customs of manners and there origins they came from. This feature is actually better than the movie.War DogsHere a cartoon about dogs in boot camp and there training just a propaganda film for our side I had not seen this one before but did enjoy it.Without ReservationsThe MovieThis movie has obviously been influenced by Singing in the Rain, which isn't a bad thing. It takes the formula without of course the musical and runs with it 2 guys one gal the main guy falls for the girl she falls for him and yes it even rains on them go figure......lol.  It's a story of a writer Christopher Madden who rights a book the book is bought to be made a movie. She boards a train and bam there the duke. From there the fun begins. This movie shows the lighter side of the duke which is always fun to watch.The Video:Made in 1944 it is black and white full frame. It's nothing spectacular. It could use a cleaning, but it watch able.The AudioPresented in 1.0 mono so it's and old movie that's not been updated.The ExtrasI Love My Husband ButA very Looney tunes episode like story about the different types of husbands and the wife who deal with them. I have no real idea why this is here. It was made in 1947 and Without Reservations was made in 1946 so I am not sure why it is here. It is silly and something to watch once.Holiday for ShoestringsThis is the shoemaker and the elves story from Merrie Melodies that ran before this movie aired it is a charming cartoon. One that I am sure many of us have seen many many times a very nice addition to the collection.Summary:All in all a good picture nothing to go crazy over but as for a duke picture it's a nice ride for a couple of hours. The DVD is well done with nice menus and a couple of extras that make it a night at the movies.TycoonThe MovieHere we have the Duke as a railroad man blasting tunnels thru a mountain. He falls for a weird rich mans daughter. Then all the drama begins. It takes a long time to get to it too. It is slow paced not edited well and not one of the dukes best films. That's not to say its bad it just doesn't move along and doesn't pull you into the storyThe VideoThe video is bright lots of color in full frame. It has some damage here and there but all in all a watch able print.The AudioMono 1.0 no update which is a shame with all the dynamite it been nice to have a 5.1 mix too rattle the windows.The ExtrasHollywood WonderlandSixteen minutes of a musical about Hollywood made in 1947. I am not sure what this has to do with the movie but its here it's a Disney like parade of music and dance with some cameos interesting once but like most extras never watched twice.Red Hot RangersA Tex Avery cartoon with two bears trying to put out a forrest fire. Most of us have seen this one before but due to the smoking in the first scene it is not shown on regular tv anymore.SummaryAs for my collection of duke movies it is a most. For the casual fan it's a rent if u can find it. For six bucks though it is priced right.Big Jim McClainThe MovieHere we have John Wayne in a propaganda film about why you should hate communists. He plays and agent of homeland security bent on breaking the communist groups of America. It comes off as a hate film to be honest and as a fan of the Duke I don't like this side of him at all. It is easy to see why they took so long to release this film to DVD. Its one not a very good movie and two full of stereo types that in its day I guess was necessary.The VideoIt's presented in Full Frame Black and white.

1062166,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B000O599XA,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[3, 5]","This six disk collection gathers together some of John Wayne's movies that have not been available on DVD or VHS before, and for that reason alone deserves space in the collection of Wayne fans. John Wayne made over 100 movies, yet the same twenty or so keep getting release while the bulk of his work is ignored, so it is nice to see some of his ""forgotten"" movies seeing the light of day.These movies are from an interesting period in John Wayne's career. They were made as he was transitioning from a second-rate actor into a star. The first - ""Allegheny Uprising"" - dates from the same year as his breakout hit ""Stagecoach"" which elevated him from a low-rate cowboy serial actor into a hot studio property. It is interesting to note that in both movies, Claire Trevor actually had higher billing than John Wayne - something that seems odd to those of us who grew up watching movies in the years when he was a superstar. ""Allegheny Uprising"" is probably the best movie in this collection.The second movie in the collection ""Reunion in France"", from 1942, is from the War era, when John Wayne was one of the few movie stars who did not join the armed services, as a result he found himself in demand both as a supporting actor and leading man and, as he said in interview after the war years - he started making money for the first time, and had a family to support. ""Reunion"" is interesting in that Wayne is, once again, not the star of the movie, and seems to be hired mainly for his rugged good looks rather than his acting ability. He doesn't even get the girl.The third movie in this set is a romantic comedy ""Without Reservations"", from 1946, and is one of the last few movies Wayne made in which he did not receive top billing. It is one of a handful of comdedies John Wayne made over the years, and people who were surprised at his comedic performances in ""True Grit"" and ""Rooster Cogburn"" probably weren't paying attention. The Duke had a gift for dry comedy, which is demonstrated in this film.The fourth movie in the set is ""The Tycoon"" and is the first in which he has top billing. It is an interesting railroad story burdened with an added-on romance that makes the movie drag. Movies like this were probably one of the reasons John Wayne began to want full control over his career. That would come a few years later after he starred in John Ford's cavalry trilogy, which turned him into a star who could write his own destiny.The fifth movie in this collection is ""Big Jim McLain"" fromn 1952, and is an early product of John Wayne's Batjac Productions. It is one of two pure propaganda films that he made in order to put his personal political opinions before the public. This was made during the Macarthy era, when the House Unamerican Committee, under the leadership of Joseph Macarthy, was trampling citizen's rights and accusing anybody who disagreed with them of being a communist. Many Holliwood actors, directors and workers ended up being blacklisted because they refused to testify before the committee. John Wayne supported witch-hunt looking for commies under every rock, and this film was his way of trying to turn people who were trampling human rights and creating hysteria for their own political ends into heroes. ""Big Jim"" is actually much more watchable than his second propaganda film - The Green Berets - in which he tried to portray the Vietnam war as a ""Good War"" like World War II and utterly failed. ""Big Jim"" is worth watching as a warning against those who tell us ""If you are not with us, you are with our enemies"" and then try to subvert our constitutional rights.The final movie of the set is ""Trouble Along the Way"" - the second comedy in the collection. This 1953 gem was made after Wayne finally became a first rate star and could write his own ticket. The great Cavalry Trilogy is now behind him, and his best work (as well as some of his worst work) are yet ahead of him. Wayne plays a single father and defrocked football coach who is called upon to rescue a failing Catholic college by turning a pathetic football team into winners, while trying to keep custody of his tomboy daughter and romancing the girl's social worker (Donna Reed). Sherry Jackson, playing Wayne's daughter, steals the show and turns what might have been a second rate movie into a little gem.This collection is worth adding to your library because the films fill a void in available Wayne movies. But the extras - a featurette and cartoon or comedy short of the same vintage as each film, are icing on the cake. They bring back the days when you went to the movies for fifty cents and got a B-movie, a featurette, a cartoon and a main feature for your money. None of the movies are great, but they are all worth watching.",4,the Duke pays his dues,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,4746,"['six', 'disk', 'collection', 'gathers', 'together', 'John', 'Wayne',
