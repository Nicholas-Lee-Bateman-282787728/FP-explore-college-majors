1193268,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001G43C1S,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Slacker Uprising, 2004 filmThis story begins in July 2004. John Kerry was reported ahead of George W. Bush in the polls. Could this be changed with advertising? Only if Kerry failed to respond to the smear campaign. [What would Truman do?] ""How did this happen?"" [One way to fix an election campaign is for an opponent to take a dive.] One film maker tried to turn the situation around. [Waiting until the last weeks is way too late.] We see a rally of political support on election eve, and then the preceding weeks. There are twenty states that can decide the election - they want the 50% that don't vote to vote in this election. Volunteers will try to raise more votes. Since 1968 only 50% of those eligible have voted. [Maybe they know the fix is in, the Ruling Class ignores the voters.] Free underwear and noodles? Is this a crime in your state? Does the corporate media lie to people? You can avoid this by not watching TV news; they mostly just read a paper report.There is a song for entertainment. Michael Moore makes a speech about the ""Swift Boat"" ads, and parodies them. [Who was behind them?] Should the press represent the people and tell what is happening? We hear another song, then Moore speaks again. A poor man in a rich man's war? Isn't that how it usually works? Others speak out against the War on Iraq. [Didn't it decrease the supply of oil and drive up the cost of oil and gasoline?] REM speaks against the war. There are counter-demonstrators, they also speak in this film. Guess who the Bush family likes? Moore can handle criticisms. ""Who would Jesus bomb?"" Should Moore be banned from colleges? Will the American people take it anymore? [Yes.] Another song. Moore speaks in San Diego too. Joan Baez sings (she has aged). Moore visits Kent State in Ohio and its memorial to slain students. Can Bush win Ohio? A Hollywood actor speaks. Moore warns against apathy. [Who cares?]In the last days four states would decide the election. More rallies in support of Kerry. Then only two states to decide the election. [Notice a trend? Was there a hired spoiler to attract votes from one candidate?] Moore speaks in Florida. Roseanne Barr speaks in a sarcastic manner. Does it convince you? [Moore needs to lose about eighty pounds, and learn how to appeal to voters over forty.] ""Kerry lost by only one state - Ohio - and 100,000 votes."" Close as in 2000; if Gore won his home state he would have been President. Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction (like the news on television). The selection of facts provides a point of view. Lies are best propagated via ""half-truths"", facts that do not represent a whole reality. If you don't like Moore's selection just buy another product. [Moore succeeded in going from an auto assembly line job to a magazine editor to a millionaire film producer (he uses investor's money, like others in his line of work).",3,Moore's Last Stand Against Bush,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2894,"['Slacker', 'Uprising', '2004', 'filmThis', 'story', 'July', '2004', 'John', 'Kerry', 'was', 'reported', 'ahead', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'polls', 'Could', 'be', 'changed', 'advertising', 'Only', 'Kerry', 'failed', 'respond', 'smear', 'campaign', '[', 'What', 'would', 'Truman', 'do', ']', 'How', 'did', 'happen', 'One', 'way', 'fix', 'election', 'campaign', 'opponent', 'take', 'dive', ']', 'One', 'film', 'maker', 'tried', 'turn', 'situation', 'around', '[', 'Waiting', 'last', 'weeks', 'way', 'too', 'late', ']', 'see', 'rally', 'political', 'support', 'election', 'eve', 'then', 'preceding', 'weeks', 'are', 'twenty', 'states', 'can', 'decide', 'election', 'want', '50', '%', 'do', ""n't"", 'vote', 'vote', 'election', 'Volunteers', 'will', 'try', 'raise', 'more', 'votes', '1968', 'only', '50', '%', 'eligible', 'have', 'voted', 'Maybe', 'know', 'fix', 'Ruling', 'Class', 'voters', ']', 'Free', 'underwear', 'noodles', 'crime', 'state', 'corporate', 'media', 'lie', 'people', 'can', 'avoid', 'not', 'watching', 'TV', 'news', 'mostly', 'just', 'read', 'paper', 'report.There', 'song', 'entertainment', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'speech', 'Swift', 'Boat', 'ads', '[', 'Who', 'was', ']', 'Should', 'press', 'represent', 'people', 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'hear', 'song', 'then', 'Moore', 'speaks', 'again', 'A', 'poor', 'man', 'rich', 'man', 'war', ""n't"", 'how', 'usually', 'Others', 'speak', 'out', 'War', 'Iraq', '[', 'Did', ""n't"", 'decrease', 'supply', 'oil', 'drive', 'up', 'cost', 'oil', 'gasoline', ']', 'REM', 'speaks', 'war', 'are', 'counter-demonstrators', 'also', 'speak', 'film', 'Guess', 'who', 'Bush', 'family', 'likes', 'Moore', 'can', 'handle', 'criticisms', 'Who', 'would', 'Jesus', 'bomb', 'Should', 'Moore', 'be', 'banned', 'colleges', 'Will', 'American', 'people', 'take', 'anymore', '[', 'Yes', ']', 'song', 'Moore', 'San', 'Diego', 'too', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'sings', 'aged', 'visits', 'Kent', 'State', 'Ohio', 'memorial', 'slain', 'students', 'Can', 'Bush', 'win', 'Ohio', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'speaks', 'Moore', 'apathy', '[', 'Who', ']', 'last', 'days', 'four', 'states', 'would', 'decide', 'election', 'More', 'rallies', 'support', 'Kerry', 'Then', 'only', 'two', 'states', 'decide', 'election', '[', 'Notice', 'trend', 'Was', 'hired', 'spoiler', 'attract', 'votes', 'one', 'candidate', ']', 'Moore', 'Florida', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'sarcastic', 'manner', 'convince', 'Moore', 'needs', 'lose', 'eighty', 'pounds', 'learn', 'how', 'appeal', 'voters', 'forty', ']', 'Kerry', 'lost', 'only', 'one', 'state', 'Ohio', '100,000', 'votes', 'Close', '2000', 'Gore', 'won', 'home', 'state', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'President', 'Documentaries', 'continuum', 'fact', 'fiction', 'news', 'television', 'selection', 'facts', 'point', 'view', 'Lies', 'are', 'best', 'propagated', 'half-truths', 'do', 'not', 'represent', 'whole', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moore', 'selection', 'just', 'buy', 'product', 'Moore', 'succeeded', 'going', 'auto', 'assembly', 'line', 'job', 'magazine', 'editor', 'millionaire', 'film', 'producer', 'investor', 'money', 'others', 'line', 'work']",N/A

1193272,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B001G43C1S,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Yes, another Michael Moore film. And what's more, one with a lot of ego-enhancement for Michael. And also one of blatant liberalism. So if any of that offends you, don't bother with it.The movie chronicles what many might think was a failure for Moore: his 62-city tour in 2004 to incite ""slackers"" to get out and vote. And quite specifically, to vote against George Bush. Along the way, he had his share of hassles, as when he was charged with ""bribing"" people to register by offering free Raman noodles and clean underwear. A variety of musicians, speakers and comediennes (notably Roseanne Barr, pretending to be a conservative) joined Moore along the route, adding not only to the tour but to the movie. Among the speakers was a lady whose son was killed in Iraq, three diplomats who quit because they could not stomach supporting Bush's policies, and several more whose appeal was almost entirely emotional.I have to remind myself that appeals to emotional responses are not considered too tacky for politics, and that the other side certainly does their share. But there are also serious discussions with the press about their failure to expose the lies coming out of the White House, where Moore showed very clearly that he understands exactly what is going on. Moore is a defender of our Constitutional rights, and even if you think he's little more than a fat buffoon, he's very effective. Still, Kerry did not win in 2004, and so whether this movie will actually galvanize people to register for the 2008 election remains unknown.A personal highlight for me in the film was Joan Baez singing the Finnish National Anthem. It is remarkable in that it does not concentrate on Finland exclusively, but firmly places the country as a part of a world where peace is the number one issue. That's a very high grade of patriotism, and the Finns should be very proud.

This film is all about Michael Moore and his narcissism which he exhales with every gargantuan shuffle. This is a rich man's tale showcasing his 20 state 2004 college tour. The venture was a crusade to stop George W. Bush from getting reelected. His name is up in lights at every locale...and the camera documents these events enthusiastically. The college students seem much taken with Moore which is not surprising as emotion charged thinking and self-absorption are hallmarks of youth. Hopefully, as the kids progress in life they will discover the truth about the world on their own. It's never too late to grow up--unless you're Eddie Vedder that is. There's about five minutes here devoted to that reed of cultural effluvia and he parroted all the standard soundbytes about the president. My favorite line from the film was when Moore proclaimed, ""They have God on their side and we have Ben Affleck."" Agreed! And thank you.The press asks him softball questions like, ""Do you believe what you're saying or are your films propaganda?"" Guess how he answered? Yep, he said he's countering manufactured news and that he's anti-propaganda. However, the only conservatives he depicts in this film are straw men who mention Jesus somewhere in their statements. This is in keeping with Moore's disdain for Christians. He taunts protestors saying: ""You're not going to do the whole rosary up there?"" and ""Who would Jesus bomb?"" Speaking of clich&eacute;s, Moore is endorsed by all manner of empty headed celebrity. Having REM, Viggo Mortensen, Gloria Steinem, and Joan Baez support you means ...nothing because a collection of bobbleheads remain a collection of bobbleheads.Overall, Democratic partisans everywhere will cherish Slacker Uprising as it confirms and redistributes numerous Democratic talking points from the last election such as John Kerry's getting ""swiftboated."" What is dubbed swiftboating is actually the act of Kerry's former comrades telling the truth about the way he behaved while in Vietnam. Pretending that his failed candidacy was a product of conspiracy is how the left chooses to recast history. Ultimately though, if his labors were so effective, then why did John Kerry lose the election? Answer: he was an unsuitable candidate who did not connect with the people and did not reflect their needs. Most conservatives refuse to watch Moore's films and I cannot blame them.

It's a film with everything -- laughs, music, stirring calls to honor free speech and conflict -- everything, alas, but a happy ending, as the Democrats went down to defeat. But that's not a surprise, since Moore starts off the film by blaming Kerry for waiting 15 days before fighting back against the Swift Boat attacks on his character and record as a military man. Moore's campaign is an attempt to save the Democrats from themselves.Moore includes footage of enormous crowds who filled auditoriums to hear him, listen to musicians (Eddie Vetter, REM, Rage Against The Machine, Joan Baez and more) and enjoy the words of actors and activists (Viggo Mortensen, Glori Steinem and Roseanne Barr) who appear at his rallies. Moore receives rock star treatment by his adoring young fans, and both enjoys the attention and the chance to connect with students who have not voted. He gets laughs by showing hilarious ""anti-Kerry"" mock commercials and he generates fear and outrage among Republicans and businessmen who actually offer to pay colleges up to $100,000 to cancel his appearances. One college that accepted the offer has it misfire when the appearance is moved down he street to an even larger venue.Moore, as America's rabble-rouser in chief, does not shy from confrontations. And he is one of the few scourges of the docile national media. At several press conferences, he scolds the media for not doing their job.

1193278,A28E1OQD45QE9Y,B001G43C1S,Mike C.,"[4, 14]","First off: I'm a libertarian and I hated Bush and Kerry pretty evenly.when I sat down to watch this dvd I had a pad of paper with me.  I was going to write down each valid reason the movie gave to vote for Kerry over Bush.  I could have used a post-it note.The beauty of this documentary is that Bush won and so you can look at people's fear of 4 more years of Bush and see that they aren't valid.  One lady said she had to vote for Kerry because Bush would take away her social security.  Didn't happen.  Eddie Vetter and another musician hinted that Bush would use the draft.  Didn't happen.  Al Gore won the popular vote.  Irrelevant.  They talked about how Bush is immoral while trying to get people to vote for a VP who had multiple affairs while his wife was suffering from cancer.The complaints about the war and the national debt were the only valid arguments made against Bush.  Of course using these two arguments to convince people to vote for Kerry is pointless.The movie says Kerry lost by only 100,000 votes but he lost by over 3,000,000.  But I guess if you were looking for accurate information you wouldn't watch a michael morre movie.It's just sad to see people get fired up about how crappy government is and then put that momentum into supporting someone like Kerry.  If you want something different you need to vote for someone different.  Again, I was indifferent to either Bush or Kerry but as you watch the movie and listen to the idiotic Michael Moore drones with their che guevera t'shirts it makes you feel good that they failed.on a side note: Is michael moore so fat that he demands special recliners on every stage for him to sit on?",2,failed opportunity,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1663,"['First', ""'m"", 'libertarian', 'hated', 'Bush', 'Kerry', 'pretty', 'evenly.when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'dvd', 'had', 'pad', 'paper', 'was', 'going', 'write', 'down', 'valid', 'reason', 'movie', 'gave', 'vote', 'Kerry', 'Bush', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'post-it', 'note.The', 'beauty', 'documentary', 'Bush', 'won', 'so', 'can', 'look', 'people', 'fear', '4', 'more', 'years', 'Bush', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'valid', 'One', 'lady', 'said', 'had', 'vote', 'Kerry', 'Bush', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'social', 'security', 'Did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Eddie', 'Vetter', 'musician', 'hinted', 'Bush', 'would', 'use', 'draft', 'Did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Al', 'Gore', 'won', 'popular', 'vote', 'Irrelevant', 'talked', 'how', 'Bush', 'immoral', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'vote', 'VP', 'who', 'had', 'multiple', 'affairs', 'wife', 'was', 'suffering', 'cancer.The', 'complaints', 'war', 'national', 'debt', 'were', 'only', 'valid', 'arguments', 'made', 'Bush', 'course', 'using', 'two', 'arguments', 'convince', 'people', 'vote', 'Kerry', 'pointless.The', 'movie', 'Kerry', 'lost', 'only', '100,000', 'votes', 'lost', '3,000,000', 'guess', 'were', 'looking', 'accurate', 'information', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'michael', 'morre', 'movie.It', 'just', 'sad', 'see', 'people', 'get', 'fired', 'up', 'how', 'crappy', 'government', 'then', 'put', 'momentum', 'supporting', 'someone', 'Kerry', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'need', 'vote', 'someone', 'different', 'Again', 'was', 'indifferent', 'Bush', 'Kerry', 'watch', 'movie', 'listen', 'idiotic', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'drones', 'che', 'guevera', 'feel', 'good', 'failed.on', 'side', 'note', 'michael', 'moore', 'so', 'fat', 'special', 'recliners', 'stage', 'sit']",N/A

It documents Michael Moore's 2004 Tour to get the ""slackers"" to register and vote. He travels to college campuses giving speeches, giving away slacker necessities (clean underwear and ramen noodles) and getting people to register.Across the country, he goes to the key states, along with a number of famous guests (R.E.M., Eddie Vedder, Tom Morello, Viggo Mortensen, etc.). As he goes along this Tour of the country he encounters strong opposition, especially in the conservative states. As businessmen try to bribe student government with money to ban Michael Moore from college campuses (Free Speech anyone?!), and some actually succeed in banning him (in California of all places), Moore goes on trying to reach out to students.This is probably the least biased of Moore's documentary and shows his trip throughout the country as he gathers supporters for the Kerry campaign. This is a very interesting documentary released as the 2008 Election nears, maybe merely for effect. But, maybe also to raise some consciousness about a citizen's right and duty to vote, which ultimately, Moore's main message.",4,"Moore charging the students, trying to get people to vote",1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,1166,"['Slacker', 'Uprising', 'very', 'good', 'revealing', 'documentary', 'documents', 'Michael', 'Moore', '2004', 'Tour', 'get', 'slackers', 'register', 'vote', 'college', 'campuses', 'giving', 'speeches', 'giving', 'away', 'slacker', 'necessities', 'clean', 'underwear', 'ramen', 'noodles', 'getting', 'people', 'register.Across', 'country', 'key', 'states', 'number', 'famous', 'guests', 'R.E.M.', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'Tom', 'Morello', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'etc.', 'Tour', 'country', 'strong', 'opposition', 'especially', 'conservative', 'states', 'businessmen', 'try', 'bribe', 'student', 'government', 'money', 'ban', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'college', 'campuses', 'Free', 'Speech', 'anyone', 'actually', 'succeed', 'banning', 'California', 'places', 'Moore', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'students.This', 'probably', 'least', 'biased', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'trip', 'country', 'supporters', 'Kerry', 'campaign', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'released', '2008', 'Election', 'nears', 'maybe', 'merely', 'effect', 'maybe', 'also', 'raise', 'consciousness', 'citizen', 'right', 'duty', 'vote', 'ultimately', 'Moore', 'main', 'message']",N/A

1193284,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001G43C1S,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 4]","Michael Moore was trying, during the 2004 election, got the ""slackers"" off their tails to get out and vote. He focused on predominatly college campuses in upwards of 60 cities, got people all riled up, and got 'em out.Yeah, yeah, Kerry lost. But--as the film points out at the end--not by very much. (Moore didn't go into any detail on how the Ohio vote may have been stolen, so I won't pursue that here).Critics complain about Moore. He's ""biased."" He shows the viewers what they want to see at the expense of what really happened. I'm shocked. SHOCKED! Actually, I think Moore critics resent him because he's talented. While countless ""documentaries"" have been released, most of them have teatime audiences, ladies watching such films during a break in their canasta game. Moore has attracted a mass audience and that really riles those of an opposite ideology. So they sling mud, and more mud, and Moore mud.This film was released in time to encourage a Barack vote in the 2008 election. Young people particularly could watch the film and comment, ""My God, we almost won in 2004. What can we do this time around?"" If that was its purpose, I think it served its purpose.Mind you, at the beginning of the film already, there were a few challenges to the Kerry campaign. What I remember now, a week after seeing the film, is that Kerry didn't respond ""in a timely manner"" to the Swift Boat allegations. (That he was a bad campaigner has been acknowledged by many, even those I know who campaigned for him). But Moore went from campus to campus, riling up the ""slackers.""In this film, he went to a community college in Utah. There's a whole film on that subject, ""This Divided State,"" which covers details not shown in ""Slackers."" I recommend that film too.On one campus in California, the school administration chose to disinvite Moore but the students then arranged for Moore to speak at a local fairgrounds--where the audience was much, much greater than it would have been on campus. And Moore made substantially more in contributions, which he offered as a scholarship to someone who'd challenge the school's administration.Brilliant.Moore had the showbiz/music personalites to add some color to the campaign. Roseann Barr was hystrical.Moore had been passing out packages soup and clean underwear to students who'd pledge to vote in 2004. Some GOP activists tried to sue him for ""bribery"" for that act, a case which I don't believe did them any PR good, let along any legal victory.One memorable element of the film was the Moore opponents on one campus. They were calling him an ""Communist,"" and an ""anti-American."" Now, I have little doubt there were some who're not fond of Moore who were less fanatical. But I'm glad Michael showed the eccentrics. One hears incessantly from the ""right"" about the ""left's"" penchant for the ""politically correct."" But one seldom hears of those correctitudes for which the right is responsible. Moore exposed them for what they are: intolerant eccentrics who believe in fairy tales, and condemn those who don't!I have the DVD version of the film which also has a few extras. One I like is Moore on stage commenting on Bill O'Reilly's book for kids. That's a few minutes not to be missed.I don't consider this a great Moore film. But, again, it served its purpose. (If the 2008 election were limited to younger people, Barack would have won by something like 4 to 1!)Enjoy it, bless those who released the film for its magnificient timing, and get some ideas for the future!",4,Served its purpose,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3513,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'was', 'trying', '2004', 'election', 'got', 'slackers', 'off', 'tails', 'get', 'out', 'vote', 'focused', 'predominatly', 'college', 'campuses', 'upwards', '60', 'cities', 'got', 'people', 'riled', 'up', 'got', 'out.Yeah', 'yeah', 'Kerry', 'lost', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'end', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'Moore', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'how', 'Ohio', 'vote', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'here', '.Critics', 'complain', 'Moore', 'biased', 'viewers', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'expense', 'what', 'really', 'happened', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'SHOCKED', 'Actually', 'think', 'critics', 'resent', 'talented', 'countless', 'documentaries', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'most', 'have', 'teatime', 'audiences', 'ladies', 'watching', 'such', 'films', 'break', 'canasta', 'game', 'Moore', 'attracted', 'mass', 'audience', 'really', 'opposite', 'ideology', 'sling', 'mud', 'more', 'mud', 'Moore', 'mud.This', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'encourage', 'Barack', 'vote', '2008', 'election', 'Young', 'people', 'particularly', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'comment', 'God', 'almost', 'won', '2004', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'purpose', 'think', 'served', 'purpose.Mind', 'beginning', 'film', 'already', 'were', 'few', 'challenges', 'Kerry', 'campaign', 'What', 'remember', 'now', 'week', 'seeing', 'film', 'Kerry', 'did', ""n't"", 'respond', 'timely', 'manner', 'Swift', 'Boat', 'allegations', 'was', 'bad', 'campaigner', 'been', 'acknowledged', 'many', 'even', 'know', 'who', 'campaigned', 'Moore', 'went', 'campus', 'campus', 'riling', 'up', 'slackers', 'film', 'went', 'community', 'college', 'Utah', 'whole', 'film', 'subject', 'Divided', 'State', 'details', 'not', 'shown', 'Slackers', 'recommend', 'film', 'too.On', 'one', 'campus', 'California', 'school', 'administration', 'chose', 'disinvite', 'Moore', 'students', 'then', 'arranged', 'Moore', 'speak', 'local', 'fairgrounds', 'where', 'audience', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'greater', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'campus', 'Moore', 'made', 'substantially', 'more', 'contributions', 'offered', 'scholarship', 'someone', 'who', ""'d"", 'challenge', 'school', 'administration.Brilliant.Moore', 'had', 'showbiz/music', 'personalites', 'add', 'color', 'campaign', 'Roseann', 'Barr', 'was', 'hystrical.Moore', 'had', 'been', 'passing', 'out', 'packages', 'soup', 'clean', 'underwear', 'students', 'who', ""'d"", 'pledge', 'vote', '2004', 'GOP', 'activists', 'tried', 'sue', 'bribery', 'act', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', 'PR', 'good', 'let', 'legal', 'victory.One', 'memorable', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'Moore', 'opponents', 'one', 'campus', 'were', 'calling', 'Communist', 'anti-American', 'Now', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'were', 'who', ""'re"", 'not', 'fond', 'Moore', 'who', 'were', 'less', 'fanatical', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Michael', 'showed', 'eccentrics', 'One', 'incessantly', 'right', 'left', 'penchant', 'politically', 'correct', 'one', 'seldom', 'hears', 'correctitudes', 'right', 'responsible', 'Moore', 'exposed', 'what', 'are', 'intolerant', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'believe', 'fairy', 'tales', 'condemn', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'also', 'few', 'extras', 'One', 'like', 'Moore', 'stage', 'commenting', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'book', 'kids', 'few', 'minutes', 'not', 'be', 'missed.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'great', 'Moore', 'film', 'again', 'served', 'purpose', '2008', 'election', 'were', 'limited', 'younger', 'people', 'Barack', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'something', '4', '1', 'bless', 'who', 'released', 'film', 'magnificient', 'timing', 'get', 'ideas', 'future']",N/A
