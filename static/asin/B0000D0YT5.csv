776702,A1E37DNGUC3GCI,B0000D0YT5,"Jason Mierek ""uniqueness is ubiquitous""","[10, 10]","This documentary essentially consists of William Gibson, SF author and inventor of the term/concept ""cyberspace,"" riding in a car, smoking cigarettes, and talking about scads of interesting topics. Gibson's monologue ranges from the interpenetration of humans and technology and the futility of seeking a return to ""noble savagery,"" the writing of William Burroughs, the role of mediation in our postmodern lives and the practice of living in a present moment embedded in this hyper-mediation. Whether or not you agree with his ideas, they are definitely intriguing and well-worth contemplating.Alas, the visuals used in the production of the film were less than stellar. Sometimes the producers relied on the lightning fast MTV-cuts and driving drum'n'bass that were typical of the mid- to late-90s, and at other times they used such tired tricks as overexposing the film again, and again, and again. I guess the producers figured that a video of one man talking and smoking would not be compelling enough without these visual gewgaws. I respectfully disagree. Gibson's ideas, with or without any special effects, would keep me watching---and thinking---the entire time.",4,"Gibson's ideas, with or without any special effects, would keep me watching---and thinking---the entire time",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1171,"['documentary', 'essentially', 'William', 'Gibson', 'SF', 'author', 'inventor', 'term/concept', 'cyberspace', 'riding', 'car', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'talking', 'scads', 'interesting', 'topics', 'Gibson', 'monologue', 'interpenetration', 'humans', 'technology', 'futility', 'seeking', 'return', 'noble', 'savagery', 'writing', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'role', 'mediation', 'postmodern', 'lives', 'practice', 'living', 'present', 'moment', 'embedded', 'hyper-mediation', 'not', 'agree', 'ideas', 'are', 'definitely', 'intriguing', 'well-worth', 'contemplating.Alas', 'visuals', 'used', 'production', 'film', 'were', 'less', 'stellar', 'producers', 'relied', 'lightning', 'fast', 'MTV-cuts', 'driving', 'drum', ""n'bass"", 'were', 'typical', 'mid-', 'late-90s', 'other', 'times', 'used', 'such', 'tired', 'tricks', 'overexposing', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'guess', 'producers', 'figured', 'video', 'one', 'man', 'talking', 'smoking', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'compelling', 'enough', 'visual', 'gewgaws', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'Gibson', 'ideas', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'keep', 'watching', '-and', 'thinking', '-the', 'entire', 'time']",William Gibson - No Maps for These Territories

The documentary is 90 minutes of listening to Gibson talk -- which suited me! He has fascinating insights into the Internet, into the changing concepts of ""Time and Space"" in our reality. He is reflective and insightful ... I realized as I watched we really don't know exactly where we are headed or what our reality will become as we travel faster and faster into the unknown.At one point Gibson compares our age to the Victorian Age and as he described it I imagined Victorians had their world view blown away the first time they traveled by train; getting somewhere in a day when previously it would have taken a week. A Changing Concept of Time and Space (and of Reality) happened then, and it is happening to us now.The filming looks casual.(it seems often Gibson forgot he was being filmed) It gave me the feeling of what it would be like to listen to Gibson in person.

776704,A35A0BG4ZUWVOI,B0000D0YT5,Neodoering,"[0, 0]","Recently I finished reading ""Distrust That Particular Flavor,"" the new book of William Gibson essays covering about 30 of his nonfiction pieces for various magazines.  I'd read short interviews with Gibson before, but ""Distrust"" really got me to wondering about this man and his ideas and what ends up in his books.This documentary is an excellent introduction to William Gibson the man and the writer.  He covers a lot of topics in his 88 minutes, including a number you've heard him talk about before, like the mediated world and his drugs habits when younger, and some topics you probably haven't heard him talk about before, like pornography as a prime mover of mass media.  He talks a good bit about his writing background, how he got started and how he got famous, and he gives interesting insights into how his writing process works.  There are readings of some of his works by Bono of U2 and others interspersed into the interview, which grounds Gibson's comments with his written words as opposed to spoken words.Other reviewers havn't liked the visual tricks the filmmakers employed in their documentary, but I did like them; they seemed appropriate to the subject matter and weren't over the top, as far as I was concerned.  The moving car added visual interest to what was essentially a talking head interview, and the fast takes and video clips of the world outside the car tied the words to the world.  I thought they could have done something more with computers, since computers are such a part of his earlier works, like pictures of computers firing up, or network maps, etc.  There is some imagery of search functions which works with the subject of the film, but I thought there could have been more.Overall this documentary gives good insight into an important writer's creative process and the ideas that move him to write what he does, and how he does.  Some of it I have picked up on before in Gibson's written works and interviews, but the documentary is mostly fresh and stimulating.  If you've read some of Gibson's work and are curious about the man behind the words, this is a great way to get that information with a small investment on your part.
