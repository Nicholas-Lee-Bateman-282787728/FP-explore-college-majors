Bob Goldwait does some wacky stuff including dress up in a Godzilla suit and cause panic and destruction that will earn a few laughs. Moore plays a struggling singer as in ""No Small Affair"" that can't seem to get the money together in time to keep her house.

The 1980s were a time when Film makers would take a chance, and while they weren't the best examples of fine cinema, they were a great way to pass time on a dreary indoor weekend. The first time I saw this film was on TV. I was a fan of Bobcat Goldwait's, so I had to see this movie. The movie was so much more, a hysterically memorable script by Savage Steve Holland, John Cusack's character, and a young un-hollywood spoiled Demi Moore.The story follows a guy who just can't find love, and the way it's told through his cartoon drawings is great. It follows him to Nantucket for the summer, where he and his family meet all kinds of locals, the crazy mechanics, as the seem to be in an odd competition/feud with the town's local Yuppies.

After all, it's the same director/writer, the same wacky worldview, the same absurdist comedy, even many returning cast members, including lead John Cusack, basically playing the same character. Gotta be a hoot, right?Sadly, no.  Not that One Crazy Summer doesn't have its moments.  There are still some inspired surreal gags and goofy, hammy performances by quasi-lunatic characters. But everything feels forced this time:  the timing and editing aren't as tight; there are fewer surprises;  the acting *too* broad (except Cusack, who sails through this asylum deadpan as always, barring those occasions when his imagination takes full animated flight -- altho' even these aren't as inspired as in the first film); and a too-big cast of supporting sidekicks diffuses the energy and plot objectives.  There is too much distracting Classic Rock  music shoehorned into the soundtrack  and I suspect that if you find Eighties comic Bobcat Goldthwait's schtick  as unfathomable and tiresome as I do, you will resent the amount of screen time spent on him.Not a bad movie by any means, and it has a decent message underneath and young Demi Moore is cute and appealing in a way she would seldom be again, so I'm going to goose it up a star more than I think it merits based purely on amused chuckles and a good heart.  In spite of the craziness of this summer, it seems far tamer and straighter than the meta-satire of Better Off Dead, and disappointed me while the earlier film never grows stale.",3,Pallid follow-up to Better Off Dead falls flat,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1623,"['huge', 'fan', 'Savage', 'Steve', 'Holland', 'brilliant', 'mapcap', 'debut', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'when', 'cued', 'up', 'One', 'Crazy', 'Summer', 'same', 'director/writer', 'same', 'wacky', 'worldview', 'same', 'absurdist', 'comedy', 'even', 'many', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'lead', 'John', 'Cusack', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'Got', 'ta', 'be', 'hoot', 'right', 'Sadly', 'Not', 'One', 'Crazy', 'Summer', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'still', 'inspired', 'surreal', 'gags', 'goofy', 'hammy', 'performances', 'quasi-lunatic', 'characters', 'everything', 'feels', 'forced', 'time', 'timing', 'editing', 'are', ""n't"", 'tight', 'are', 'fewer', 'surprises', 'acting', '*too*', 'broad', 'Cusack', 'who', 'asylum', 'deadpan', 'always', 'barring', 'occasions', 'when', 'imagination', 'full', 'animated', 'flight', 'altho', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'inspired', 'first', 'film', 'too-big', 'cast', 'supporting', 'sidekicks', 'energy', 'plot', 'objectives', 'too', 'much', 'distracting', 'Classic', 'Rock', 'music', 'shoehorned', 'soundtrack', 'suspect', 'find', 'Eighties', 'comic', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'schtick', 'unfathomable', 'tiresome', 'do', 'will', 'resent', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'him.Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'decent', 'message', 'underneath', 'young', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'cute', 'appealing', 'way', 'would', 'seldom', 'be', 'again', ""'m"", 'going', 'goose', 'up', 'star', 'more', 'think', 'based', 'purely', 'amused', 'chuckles', 'good', 'heart', 'spite', 'craziness', 'summer', 'far', 'tamer', 'straighter', 'meta-satire', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'disappointed', 'earlier', 'film', 'never', 'stale']",N/A

One day I threw it in the VCR and surprised myself by laughing almost nonstop through the whole thing.Sure, it seems a cookie-cutter comedy from the eighties, and it is, but look! the craziness!The brilliance of the movie is how it's situations keep slowly escalating into pure comic insanity.  Sure everybody remembers Bobcat Goldthwait rampaging in a Godzilla costume, but the seeds for the scene were presented about fifteen minutes ago and there was an uninterrupted continuity that took us from there to here.  This is pretty amazing for a &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; comedy.Really, it's this sense of mayhem that keeps bringing me back to the movie.  Mayhem.
