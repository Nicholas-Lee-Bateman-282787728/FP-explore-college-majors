Somebody in the production team should be slapped, I'm not kidding. I read somewhere that Ford and Pitt tried to distance themselves from this stinker, and I'm not surprised. Shame on them for taking the big Bucks in the first place. A case of two pampered actors adding fuel to a (then) fire that really needed no fuel adding to it, from a safe distance, whilst doing themselves a lot of good in the process. To just say it's confused, etc, is really letting it off the hook. It's awful, but if you're into 'pro Irish/anti British' you'll probably put this right next to the copies of Braveheart and The Patriot you already have on your shelf.

6152,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,0767802578,Bstrassell0001,"[0, 0]","&#8220;It&#8217;s not an American story, it&#8217;s an Irish one,&#8221; Brad Pitt&#8217;s Frankie Maguire (under the alias of Rory Devaney) tells Harrison Ford&#8217;s Tom O&#8217;Meara about the greatest tragedy of his life: seeing his father, at age eight, gunned down in front of him, his mother, and his sister. Just before that, Tom asks &#8220;Rory&#8221; &#8220;if they got the f*****s,&#8221; not realizing that he&#8217;s talking to a wanted terrorist who, in seeking vengeance against his home country, has caused other eight-year old boys to lose their own fathers in childhood, also. But, it will be a matter of time before Tom realizes it.His life, you could say, was dramatic until the man he believed was Rory Devaney came along, with a wife and three daughters. One of the first things he says to &#8220;Rory&#8221; upon his arrival into the O&#8217;Meara household is, as a matter of fact, that it&#8217;s &#8220;good to have someone in this house that pees standing up!&#8221; Tom, when not a husband and father by morning and night, is a New York City police officer by day, about to face a moral job dilemma with longtime friend and partner Eddie (Ruben Blades).As for Frankie Maguire? Frankie, after losing not only his father, but also his comrades to the country of Ireland, is about to give the country the greatest lesson of its life with stinger missiles. With the help of Judge Peter Fitzsimmons (George Hearn), Frankie is sent to New York City and placed in the O&#8217;Meara household, as he speaks with arms dealer Billy Burke (Treat Williams) to make arrangements for the missiles to be given to him and be put on a boat and be taken back to Ireland with him. The Irish way is not the American way, as Frankie never tires of pointing out, and when his ways do not mesh with Billy&#8217;s&#8212;all hell will break loose, on him and on the family that has trusted him with their lives and hearts.This is where the character psychology of The Devil&#8217;s Own comes in, and gets very fascinating. Late director Alan J. Pakula (RIP), through Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, begins to challenge audiences in their thinking at this very point. Through Ford&#8217;s Tom O&#8217;Meara and Pitt&#8217;s Frankie Maguire, in a particular scene, the two high demand actors go at it with each other and give the audience a great point-counterpoint to think about: Pitt&#8217;s Maguire causing other eight-year old boys to watch their fathers gunned down in front of them (as Ford&#8217;s O&#8217;Meara points out) and his holding Ireland accountable for gunning down a man in front of his family ***only*** for his politics as an Irish Republican sympathizer. More is built from this point onward, in the sympathy Ford develops in O&#8217;Meara for his co-star&#8217;s Frankie Maguire, so much to the point that he isn&#8217;t even thinking like a cop ***entirely***.The downside here, however, is where it all stops&#8212;and it does stop before the movie stops, if not entirely. If you read about production of The Devil&#8217;s Own, particularly on IMDB and Wikipedia, you will see how many changes the original screenplay went through before the final produced film was, you got it, &#8220;watered down.&#8221; Some of it is obvious. For example, the very beginning of the picture, before getting settled on the story and going at a normal pace, constantly skips between Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt and doesn&#8217;t know who to settle on between the two: and, as you will read from doing research, producers did not know who to make the picture&#8217;s bigger attraction between Ford and Pitt. The character psychology is more present with Pitt/Maguire than with Ford/O&#8217;Meara, and is cut off with the latter character around the time of the &#8220;revenge business&#8221; scene with Ruben Blades&#8217; Eddie character. In fact, nothing more is ever heard from it again, and it is right there when it becomes understandable as to what Brad Pitt meant when he referred to The Devil&#8217;s Own as &#8220;the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking-if you can even call it that-that I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;But, aside from flaws&#8212;important flaws&#8212;such as these, The Devil&#8217;s Own has some pretty admirable strengths, even if it still would&#8217;ve been better with the original screenplay. I highly recommend it.",4,"Incomplete, but not as bad as they say...",1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,4355,"['8220', '8217', 'not', 'American', 'story', '8217', 'Irish', 'one', '8221', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '8217', 'Frankie', 'Maguire', 'alias', 'Rory', 'Devaney', 'Harrison', 'Ford', '8217', 'Tom', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'greatest', 'tragedy', 'life', 'seeing', 'father', 'age', 'eight', 'gunned', 'down', 'front', 'mother', 'sister', 'Just', 'Tom', '8220', 'Rory', '8221', '8220', 'got', 'f*****s', '8221', 'not', 'realizing', '8217', 'talking', 'wanted', 'terrorist', 'who', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'home', 'country', 'caused', 'other', 'eight-year', 'old', 'boys', 'lose', 'own', 'fathers', 'childhood', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'matter', 'time', 'Tom', 'it.His', 'life', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'dramatic', 'man', 'believed', 'was', 'Rory', 'Devaney', 'came', 'along', 'wife', 'three', 'daughters', 'One', 'first', 'things', '8220', 'Rory', '8221', 'arrival', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'household', 'matter', 'fact', '8217', '8220', 'good', 'have', 'someone', 'house', 'standing', 'up', '8221', 'Tom', 'when', 'not', 'husband', 'father', 'morning', 'night', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'officer', 'day', 'face', 'moral', 'job', 'dilemma', 'longtime', 'friend', 'partner', 'Eddie', 'Ruben', 'Blades', '.As', 'Frankie', 'Maguire', 'Frankie', 'losing', 'not', 'only', 'father', 'also', 'comrades', 'country', 'Ireland', 'give', 'country', 'greatest', 'lesson', 'life', 'stinger', 'missiles', 'help', 'Judge', 'Peter', 'Fitzsimmons', 'George', 'Hearn', 'Frankie', 'sent', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'placed', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'household', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'make', 'arrangements', 'missiles', 'be', 'given', 'be', 'put', 'boat', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'way', 'not', 'American', 'way', 'Frankie', 'never', 'pointing', 'out', 'when', 'ways', 'do', 'not', 'mesh', 'Billy', '8217', '8212', 'hell', 'will', 'break', 'loose', 'family', 'trusted', 'lives', 'hearts.This', 'where', 'character', 'psychology', 'Devil', '8217', 'Own', 'very', 'fascinating', 'Late', 'director', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'RIP', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'challenge', 'audiences', 'thinking', 'very', 'point', 'Ford', '8217', 'Tom', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'Pitt', '8217', 'Frankie', 'Maguire', 'particular', 'scene', 'two', 'high', 'demand', 'actors', 'go', 'other', 'give', 'audience', 'great', 'point-counterpoint', 'think', 'Pitt', '8217', 'Maguire', 'causing', 'other', 'eight-year', 'old', 'boys', 'watch', 'fathers', 'gunned', 'down', 'front', 'Ford', '8217', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'out', 'holding', 'Ireland', 'accountable', 'gunning', 'down', 'man', 'front', 'family', '***only***', 'politics', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'sympathizer', 'More', 'built', 'point', 'onward', 'sympathy', 'Ford', 'O', '8217', 'Meara', 'co-star', '8217', 'Frankie', 'Maguire', 'so', 'much', 'point', '8217', 't', 'even', 'thinking', 'cop', '***entirely***.The', 'downside', 'here', 'however', 'where', '8212', 'stop', 'movie', 'not', 'entirely', 'read', 'production', 'Devil', '8217', 'Own', 'particularly', 'IMDB', 'Wikipedia', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'changes', 'original', 'screenplay', 'went', 'final', 'produced', 'film', 'was', 'got', '8220', 'watered', 'down.', '8221', 'obvious', 'example', 'very', 'beginning', 'picture', 'getting', 'settled', 'story', 'going', 'normal', 'pace', 'constantly', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'know', 'who', 'settle', 'two', 'will', 'read', 'doing', 'research', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'make', 'picture', '8217', 'bigger', 'attraction', 'Ford', 'Pitt', 'character', 'psychology', 'more', 'present', 'Pitt/Maguire', 'Ford/O', '8217', 'Meara', 'cut', 'off', 'latter', 'character', 'time', '8220', 'revenge', 'business', '8221', 'scene', 'Ruben', 'Blades', '8217', 'Eddie', 'character', 'fact', 'nothing', 'more', 'ever', 'heard', 'again', 'right', 'there', 'when', 'understandable', 'what', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'meant', 'when', 'referred', 'Devil', '8217', 'Own', '8220', 'most', 'irresponsible', 'bit', 'filmmaking-if', 'can', 'even', 'call', '8217', 'ever', 'seen.', '8221', 'aside', 'flaws', '8212', 'important', 'flaws', '8212', 'such', 'Devil', '8217', 'Own', 'pretty', 'admirable', 'strengths', 'even', 'still', 'would', '8217', 'been', 'better', 'original', 'screenplay', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

6154,ACBFF25XJC2T7,0767802578,Choice Critic,"[1, 1]","The Devil's Own is the kind of taut, well-paced action thriller that a viewer can sit back and enjoy-until it moves you to the edge of your seat.  For some reason, Brad  Pitt does his best work wirh older alpha males like Harrison Ford added to the mix. No movie can ever explain the historical complexities of an epoch like The Troubles.  This movie does, however, do what the movies do at their best-show that there are no simple answers to complex problems.Harrison Ford as New York Irish cop, Tom O' Meara, welcomes Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) into his family as a boarder from the old country, not knowing that he is an IRA operative and assassin. Frankie has seen things that children should not see in the struggle between Irish Catholics and Protestants in Belfast. This is vividly displayed in the movie's opening scene.  Frankie is emotionally scarred for life when his father meets a violent  end in a place that is normally every child's final refuge.  His cold, handsome eyes reflect the trauma throughout the remainder of the movie.Bringing danger into an innocent happy home is an effective dramatic device that will engage the viewer without fail.  And the gradual revelation, and its realization by a credulous Harrison Ford, is developed well.  Treat Williams is excellent as an amoral arms dealer.  He generates the kind of dislike that any audience member can feel, even if they find the plot confusing.  Williams gives the kind of performance here that shows the unfulfilled potential he appeared to have  when he first appeared in the movies.Pitt's death scene is one of the best in quite a while.  It's done with a poignant machismo which returns the audience to the movie's beginning.  There are things that are not fit for a child's eyes.

It has to be one of Pitt's best performances.. Ford plays a New York City cop and an honest, good one at that, which is nice to see in a modern-day film in which filmmakers prefer to show corrupt policemen. Another very strong point of this film was the ending. When you read someone writing it was ""unsatisfactory,"" don't believe it. Morally, the only objection I had to this film - other than the Lord's name in vain - was too much credence given to Pitt's revenge and violent lifestyle being ""understandable"" under the circumstances.

It sends a mixed message. On one hand it shows how the IRA is motivated into fighting by the atrocities they have lived for several centuries : rejection, assassinations, segregation, even apartheid because they are catholic and Irish by origin and roots. It shows the ruthlessness of the British forces, their principle that you do not have to capture opponents but to kill them since they are not fighting for their freedom but are only terrorists, a word that is used haphazardly and that excuses the protestant militias, the British secret services and even the British armed forces and police. On the other hand it is entirely biassed and only show how these IRA people are to be rejected and have to be rejected and tracked by normal people including normal Irishmen, particularly in the US. It is an Irish cop in New York who unknowingly lodges and covers the militant from Ireland with a pack of lies arranged by an Irish judge in New York too. The deal the Irish militant is in New York for gets sour and he has to clean up the plate of the arm-traffickers and smugglers. But then the British secret services and the FBI get into the picture. So the Irish NYPD cop tries to capture the militant himself to avoid his being coldbloodedly slaughtered by the British secret services. Hence the confrontation of the two. The NY cop has a duty, though he understands the motivations of his opponent, his alter ego. The militant has a duty too, and he will have to be killed not to perform it. And what has to happen happens. Though we are told it is not an American story (implied : that ends well) but an Irish ballad (implied : that ends in blood and tears), it is both an Irish ballad ending in blood and tears and an American story because the good ending is also a happy ending but for the British secret services and for the establishment that refuses any armed struggle against oppression and qualifies it as terroristic. Order is thus saved even if some millions of catholic people are still submitted to a century-old oppression by protestant foreigners.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,A biassed image of the Irish struggle for freedom,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,2257,"['Ireland', 'Irish', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'mystery', 'film', 'fight', 'independence', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'sympathetic', 'hostile', 'point', 'view', 'mixed', 'message', 'one', 'hand', 'how', 'IRA', 'motivated', 'fighting', 'atrocities', 'have', 'lived', 'several', 'centuries', 'rejection', 'assassinations', 'segregation', 'even', 'apartheid', 'are', 'catholic', 'Irish', 'origin', 'roots', 'ruthlessness', 'British', 'forces', 'principle', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'capture', 'opponents', 'kill', 'are', 'not', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'are', 'only', 'terrorists', 'word', 'used', 'haphazardly', 'protestant', 'militias', 'British', 'secret', 'services', 'even', 'British', 'armed', 'forces', 'police', 'other', 'hand', 'entirely', 'biassed', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'IRA', 'people', 'are', 'be', 'rejected', 'have', 'be', 'rejected', 'tracked', 'normal', 'people', 'including', 'normal', 'Irishmen', 'particularly', 'US', 'Irish', 'cop', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'militant', 'Ireland', 'pack', 'lies', 'arranged', 'Irish', 'judge', 'New', 'York', 'too', 'deal', 'Irish', 'militant', 'New', 'York', 'sour', 'clean', 'up', 'plate', 'arm-traffickers', 'smugglers', 'then', 'British', 'secret', 'services', 'FBI', 'get', 'picture', 'Irish', 'NYPD', 'cop', 'tries', 'capture', 'militant', 'avoid', 'being', 'coldbloodedly', 'slaughtered', 'British', 'secret', 'services', 'Hence', 'confrontation', 'two', 'NY', 'cop', 'duty', 'motivations', 'opponent', 'alter', 'ego', 'militant', 'duty', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'killed', 'not', 'perform', 'happen', 'happens', 'are', 'told', 'not', 'American', 'story', 'implied', 'well', 'Irish', 'ballad', 'implied', 'blood', 'tears', 'Irish', 'ballad', 'ending', 'blood', 'tears', 'American', 'story', 'good', 'ending', 'also', 'happy', 'ending', 'British', 'secret', 'services', 'establishment', 'armed', 'struggle', 'oppression', 'terroristic', 'Order', 'thus', 'saved', 'even', 'millions', 'catholic', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'submitted', 'century-old', 'oppression', 'protestant', 'foreigners.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Pakula, the director who has given us such memorable films as KLUTE and MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, helms an atmospheric and brooding story of loyalty, honor, trust and friendship.  Brad Pitt stars as Franky McGuire, an IRA member, who saw his father brutally murdered at the dinner table; Franky was only eight years old.  As an adult, he continues a fierce mission for freedom and ends up in New York to buy missiles from creepy entrepreneur Treat Williams (coldly efficient in a role-reversal).  Arrangements are made for him to room at a NYC cop's pad.  The cop is the indefatigable Harrison Ford, whose honor and conscience are tested when his partner (Ruben Blades) cold bloodedly shoots a running target, who had no weapon.  Things go wrong for Pitt when Ford's wife is almost killed when they interrupt a bunch of thugs looking for something from Pitt.  The inevitable showdown is a good one.Pitt and Ford are very good in their roles, although Pitt's Irish brogue is sometimes a little hard to understand.  Margaret Colin as Ford's wife is good, but is given little to do in the movie.  However, Natasha McElhone is wonderful as Pitt's girl friend, bringing a sensitive strength to her role as Megan.Pitt's plight is tragic, and Ford's knowledge of this makes for the emotional struggle by the film's end.A good, but not easy, film.",5,THE DEVIL'S OWN,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,1339,"['Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'director', 'who', 'given', 'such', 'memorable', 'films', 'KLUTE', 'MIDNIGHT', 'EXPRESS', 'helms', 'atmospheric', 'brooding', 'story', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'trust', 'friendship', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Franky', 'McGuire', 'IRA', 'member', 'who', 'saw', 'father', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'dinner', 'table', 'Franky', 'was', 'only', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'adult', 'fierce', 'mission', 'freedom', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'buy', 'missiles', 'creepy', 'entrepreneur', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'coldly', 'efficient', 'role-reversal', 'Arrangements', 'are', 'made', 'room', 'NYC', 'cop', 'pad', 'cop', 'indefatigable', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'honor', 'conscience', 'are', 'tested', 'when', 'partner', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'cold', 'bloodedly', 'running', 'target', 'who', 'had', 'weapon', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Pitt', 'when', 'Ford', 'wife', 'almost', 'killed', 'when', 'interrupt', 'bunch', 'thugs', 'looking', 'something', 'Pitt', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'good', 'one.Pitt', 'Ford', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'Pitt', 'Irish', 'brogue', 'sometimes', 'little', 'hard', 'understand', 'Margaret', 'Colin', 'Ford', 'wife', 'good', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'movie', 'However', 'Natasha', 'McElhone', 'wonderful', 'Pitt', 'girl', 'friend', 'bringing', 'sensitive', 'strength', 'role', 'Megan.Pitt', 'plight', 'tragic', 'Ford', 'knowledge', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'film', 'end.A', 'good', 'not', 'easy', 'film']",N/A
6172,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,0767802578,mitchell5954,"[1, 2]","The Devil&#8217;s Own is very much a mixed bag for me.  There are some really good things about it, but others that are off the mark to counterbalance them.  It has great actors, although some are regrettably miscast.  The beginning and ending were quite exciting (especially the beginning) but the middle portion really dragged it down.The movie starts out with an Irish kid named Frankie and his family at a dinner table.  A gunman then comes in and kills Frankie&#8217;s father right in front of him.  Then it cuts to many years later.  Frankie has grown into a grown man played by Brad Pitt.  He is an ex-Irish republican army soldier.  He defected and has started a war to change the system there.  However, after a big shootout with the military he is forced to flee to America on a boat with a load of cash on hand.  Frankie intends to purchase a stock of missiles from an underground dealer named Billy Burke, played by Treat Williams.  While there arranges to stay at the home of a cop named Tom O&#8217;Meara (Harrison Ford) and his family.  Tom eventually finds out who he really is and now the hunt is on.As I said before the movie has a very strong start.  With the scene of Frankie&#8217;s father getting shot and the firefight right after I was thinking that this would be a very deep and action-packed crime drama.  Harrison Ford gives a great performance as always.  Tom&#8217;s interaction with Frankie is the highlight of the movie.  The ending was also good with Tom finding out who Frankie is and their ideals clash.Tom is very much a boy scout who believes in the system.  He believes that criminals should be locked up no matter what, but he also believes in second chances.  He does not like to kill or even lie because he thinks it is a betrayal of his position as a cop and his values.  It is very black and white for him.  Frankie believes that the only way to change things you have to step over the moral line and get your hands dirty.  Frankie sees the world in shades of grey.  I really liked seeing those to conflicting personalities go at it.  I also like that Tom and Frankie had become friends throughout the film and they do not want to kill each other, but their conflicting ideals propel them to.  That is great stuff.However, there are issues with the film and they are major sadly.  Firstly Brad Pitt was horribly cast in this film.  He is a good actor but he just did not fit the part.  Frankie is supposed to be Irish.  Why did they not get an Irish actor?  Brad Pitt is not Irish and nothing is worse than American actors trying to play a character with an accent.  His accent is incredibly forced and I could hardly understand him most of the time.  Brad Pitt is just cast because he is a big name and nothing else.There is also a sub-villain placed at the end of the middle portion named Billy Burke.  He is incredibly bland and pointless.  He is basically there to extend the running time.Lastly the middle portion of the film is what really brought the film down.  The film started off running then suddenly halted to a slow crawl.  The middle is painfully slow and is basically just filler.  Nearly half of this movie is filler.  After Frankie meets Tom and the family the next forty to fifty minutes is dedicated to Tom going on police jobs that are unrelated to the main plot, Tom&#8217;s family and Frankie&#8217;s interaction with them.  Every now and then it goes back to the main plot a bit by having Frankie meet with his friend, his girlfriend and Billy the sub-villain.  However, those meetings are brief and do not go very far.  In short, the plot moves at the speed of molasses.On top of that, the film&#8217;s tone shifts during the middle portion.  With a title like the Devil&#8217;s Own I expected it to be a very deep and dark film.  The film starts out dark and the ending is fairly dark, but the middle is not that dark, at least by comparison.  It felt like I stepped into another movie.The only good aspect about the middle is the interaction between Tom and Frankie.  Even though Brad Pitt was a bad casting choice Frankie is still a good character and the way he interacts with Tom is pretty good.Overall, Devil&#8217;s Own does have some good aspects like Harrison Ford, the beginning and ending, and the interaction between Tom and Frankie.

Harrison Ford's character turns out in the end of have been totally skippable, perhaps something written only to inflate his screen time as the 20-million-per-film star. There's a whole dog and pony show with him questioning his own police career after a sour NYC cop incident, etc etc, but it's hard to see how this really made the tiniest dent in the story.Brad Pitt can't get over his typical I'm-so-suave look that appeals to the middle aged ladies of the world. Simply scrambling your vowel sounds and saying &quot;fook's seek&quot; frequently doesn;t quite make you sound, what,Oirish! It does make you painfully insufferable though.Thirdly, even more laughable than the accents are the action scenes, which are so poorly choreographed and edited, it's hard to believe the film is a Hollywood product. First there is Sean and Frankie's shootout with &quot;half the fookin' army,&quot; which they predictably win -- with a shotgun. Then they escape because the British forget to watch the back door. Hmm. Then, there is the mysterious appearance of a vast forest in the middle of downtown Belfast, into which IRA terrorists can conveniently ease into when cornered. Next there is the shootout with Billy Burke, in which Frankie somehow manages to fire three rounds from a double-barrelled shotgun (taking out a sniper who, oddly enough, falls forward from the impact of a shot in the chest), retrieves his pistol and fires the same shot twice--hitting Billy Burke, who for some reason counted to ten before lunging for his own gun.Long and short of it, this is a passable movie you could consider renting, but keep your expectations low.

6179,ADLN37B0153N,0767802578,Silmarwen,"[20, 23]","Francis 'Frankie' McGuire (Brad Pitt) is one of the most wanted IRA terrorists in Belfast, Ireland.  He is wanted for the murder of several police officers and army soldiers, among others.  But now his group is raising the stakes.  They are no longer going to waste their time with guns - they are going for missiles. So Frankie heads to New York City under the alias Rory Devaney.  An Irish judge sets him up to live with the O'Meara family, headed by Sergaent Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford), one of New York's finest.  As Frankie works to overhaul a boat and deal with the slimy arms dealer, Billy Burke (Treat Williams), he finds himself growing attached to the O'Meara family and wishing that he had the opportunity to lead such a life.  When Billy Burke sends men to the O'Meara house looking for his money, Frankie knows that it is time to go before he ends up harming the family who made him a part of their home for a short time.  But once Tom O'Meara discovers Frankie's real identity, he isn't about to let him go...I will be the first to admit that I didn't understand everything that was going on in the plot, but Brad Pitt's character said that &quot;If you aren't confused [about the situation in Ireland], you don't know what is going on,&quot; and I found that to be pretty true for the whole story line.  In fact, it was more of a slice of life and time passing than a story with an actual beginning and end.  Aside from the plot, the movie really shines with the superb acting in the film.  I truly cared for these characters, even though one of them was a terrorist shown killing several men.  Harrison Ford was excellent as a cop who had to live with slightly tarnished honor to cover for his friend and he did a fine job portraying his character's inner struggle as he tried to decide what to do with Frankie.  Brad Pitt was gorgeous, as usual, and I thought that his Irish accent was quite charming.  Of course, I don't really know what a real Irish accent sounds like, but when Brad spoke in a soft, melodic ripple of sound, it convinced me.  The supporting characters were also great, led by Margaret Colin, who played Sheila O'Meara, Harrison Ford's wife and his 'daughters' including Julia Stiles as Bridget, a snotty, always on the phone teenager who refused to admit she had a crush on Frankie, Ashley Carin as Morgan, who fell head over heels for Frankie and the charming Kelly Singer as Annie, who is the youngest and had the most interaction with the main characters.  One of the best things about the film was the music, composed by James Homer.  It was just beautiful and had a wonderful Irish feel to it to help draw you in.  There is also a heartbreakingly beautiful song written and performed by Melissa Etheridge during the closing credits.  I have to admit that the ending wasn't what I wanted it to be, but there really was no way to end this movie in a way that made it a happy &quot;American&quot; ending.  As the movie ends, Frankie reminds us that it is an Irish story, not an American one - only American stories always have happy endings.  All in all, the movie may be a bit muddled and perhaps could have been improved and cleared up, but I still think that this is a movie worth watching - especially if you are a fan of either of the leads.",4,"If You Aren't Confused, You Don't Know What's Going On",1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,3285,"['Francis', ""'Frankie"", 'McGuire', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'one', 'most', 'wanted', 'IRA', 'terrorists', 'Belfast', 'Ireland', 'wanted', 'murder', 'several', 'police', 'officers', 'army', 'soldiers', 'others', 'now', 'group', 'raising', 'stakes', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'going', 'waste', 'time', 'guns', 'are', 'going', 'missiles', 'So', 'Frankie', 'heads', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'alias', 'Rory', 'Devaney', 'Irish', 'judge', 'sets', 'up', 'live', ""O'Meara"", 'family', 'headed', 'Sergaent', 'Tom', ""O'Meara"", 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'finest', 'Frankie', 'overhaul', 'boat', 'deal', 'slimy', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'growing', 'attached', ""O'Meara"", 'family', 'wishing', 'had', 'opportunity', 'lead', 'life', 'When', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'men', ""O'Meara"", 'house', 'looking', 'money', 'Frankie', 'time', 'go', 'up', 'harming', 'family', 'who', 'made', 'part', 'home', 'short', 'time', 'once', 'Tom', ""O'Meara"", 'Frankie', 'real', 'identity', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'go', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'plot', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'said', 'quot', 'are', ""n't"", 'confused', '[', 'situation', 'Ireland', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'quot', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'true', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'slice', 'life', 'time', 'passing', 'story', 'actual', 'beginning', 'end', 'Aside', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'superb', 'acting', 'film', 'truly', 'cared', 'characters', 'even', 'one', 'was', 'terrorist', 'shown', 'killing', 'several', 'men', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'excellent', 'cop', 'who', 'had', 'live', 'slightly', 'tarnished', 'honor', 'cover', 'friend', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'inner', 'struggle', 'tried', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'Frankie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'usual', 'thought', 'Irish', 'accent', 'was', 'quite', 'charming', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'Irish', 'accent', 'sounds', 'when', 'Brad', 'spoke', 'soft', 'melodic', 'ripple', 'sound', 'convinced', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'led', 'Margaret', 'Colin', 'who', 'played', 'Sheila', ""O'Meara"", 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'wife', ""'daughters"", 'including', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Bridget', 'snotty', 'always', 'phone', 'teenager', 'who', 'refused', 'admit', 'had', 'crush', 'Frankie', 'Ashley', 'Carin', 'Morgan', 'who', 'fell', 'head', 'heels', 'Frankie', 'charming', 'Kelly', 'Singer', 'Annie', 'who', 'youngest', 'had', 'most', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'music', 'composed', 'James', 'Homer', 'was', 'just', 'beautiful', 'had', 'wonderful', 'Irish', 'feel', 'help', 'draw', 'also', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'song', 'written', 'performed', 'Melissa', 'Etheridge', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'admit', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'really', 'was', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'way', 'made', 'happy', 'quot', 'American', 'quot', 'ending', 'movie', 'Frankie', 'Irish', 'story', 'not', 'American', 'one', 'only', 'American', 'stories', 'always', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'muddled', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'cleared', 'up', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'leads']",N/A

Seeing it again on DVD really helped my comprehension of it.I thought the story was told well. The filmmakers showed the contrast between the sad bitterness and violence that Brad Pitt's character endures (and embraces), and the warm loving home that Harrison Ford opens to him. We the viewers sympathise with Pitt's character, even though we know -- he's gone too far.  Where can he go when he's already gone too far?The story was well-told, the acting well-done. I am no expert on Irish accents, but I wasn't overly bothered with Brad Pitt's. I thought he did a fine job, in both his acting and his accent. Harrison Ford, as usual, gives an excellent performance. I wished I could have seen more scenes with Margaret Colin (who plays Ford's wife) because she's always good. Treat Williams did a fine job as a menacing arms dealer.Special kudos go out to James Horner for the musical score. The first time I saw this film, I was so impressed by the music so I trotted out and bought the CD soundtrack; it's been one of my favorites ever since. Horner isn't always my #1 favorite film composer (but he's usually fine) but this beautiful Irish-themed score is something special.

6182,A27ZPBY2NSTD63,0767802578,"SockPuppetTheatre ""hammerscholar""","[3, 7]","This is one tired film... bland, boring and sermonising (bit like this review... if sermonising is a word) it's chief interest lies in its representation of the northern irish problemBrad Pitt's IRA terrorist seems to belong to the cult of the Hollywood Irish republican 'freedom fighter', he is good looking, mild mannered and thoroughly naive in the ways of oraganised crime as represented by Treat Williams (oh Hollywood if you only knew!). Like Richard Gere in 'the Jackal' Pitt is not a bomber but a 'soldier', it seems Hollywood (and they are not alone) believes one to be less human than the other, witness Tommy Lee Jone's 'mad bomber' in the hilarious 'Blown Away'. This is pretty lazy thinking, is it beyond them to write a complex human being capable of taking civilian lives yet who is not a blood thirsty gestapo like sadist? it always strikes me that the american novelists i have read are totally incapable of writing a believable terrorist... well Hollywood has bypassed this problem by not writing a terrorist! I mean i know they are frightened of alienating the audience but it doesn't do 'the troubles' (heh, imagine the israeli-palestine conflict being referred to as 'a spot of bother') and the plight of the northern irish people much justice to be presented with these ridiculous stereotypes, consider this: the IRA have bombed so many civilian targets, their organisation saw this as the most effective method of warfare (and given the British and American tactics in WW2 its hard to square the condemnation of these acts by people in Britain with the popularity of Winston Churchill and the public statue of 'Bomber' Harris) not to mention the amount of civilians they have shot dead  (both deliberate and through bungling) and abducted and murdered is it really believable that in such a (relatively) small oragnisation obsessed with causing such atrocities neither the Gere or Pitt characters have been involved in such actions? Besides, sniping at and killing troops whose original purpose was to protect the catholic population from murderous protestants (shades of iraq), is that really so much better than detonating bombs? Well, maybe, the troops were also probably there to reinforce the status quo and following bloody sunday scared, crazed and trigger happy would describe a portion of the British armed forces present in the province (i should imagine most were scared). But better believe you'll never see a Hollywood movie star playing an IRA terrorist who burns down the homes of members of the SDLP (i doubt you'll ever see a palestinian who shoots israeli soldiers in a positive light in a hollywood film either). The talks that lead to the good friday peace accords revealed one of the most intelligent and humane people at the table to be David Ervine, a former protestant terrorist convicted of explosives offences who had broken the cycle of violence that had either began with or been further cultivated by IRA bombings of protestant civilians. While imprsioned he gained an education and realised the full extent of the oppresion of the catholic population.... It would be interesting to see a Hollywood film about protestant terrorists, i get the impression from certain films (like the rancid Kevin Spacey mega flop 'Ordinary decent criminal') that Hollywood is determined to avoid portraying these unpleasant people, they appear in the Devil's Own to kill Pitt's father at the beginning then never seen again, you'd think it was just the british army, intelligence services and the IRA involved in this conflict the way some of these films represent it (seems pretty common for mainland europeans to know the IRA but to not even know of the existence of the groups on the other side).Aside from this, the fresh faced innocent look of the IRA members (not the hard faced intense stares of those you see released from the Maze prison, don't be fooled, these guys are hard men) and the pantomime MI6/MI5 villain 'I've been tracking these murderous baahstaards...'(but then out of all parties involved i hate british intelligence more than any of the rest... the rest i can understand) what is there to really upset people so much? The relentless oirish pipes on the soundtrack and the Guinness obsession? Brad Pitt's accent? I've heard much worse... With all the fuss surrounding this film it surprises me people don't absolutely slaughter that wretched slanderous piece of fiction that was Titanic where the English (upper class) brutalise the Irish (working class) by chaining them in the lower decks while the ship sank and a british hero is turned into a coward murderer (nice to see they apologised for that afterwards, heh) in order to give the film some kind of deeper meaning and relevant social and political dimension (and a bigger box office).The film itself isn't much to talk about really... a simple plot is bloated by a good deal of pontificating and is dragged out for 30 minutes longer than it merits, Harrison Ford is his usual concerned and righteous self (he furrows his brow alot and screws up his face), oh for another indiana jones film to rescue him from 'serious' tripe like this, and not much really happens except 2 dimensional characters go around firing guns... But, the reviews on these pages are a real eye opener, in Britain the whispers are that Americans are ignorant of the realities of the IRA campaign and situation in Northern Ireland and deeply biased. Yet I keep reading how people are moved by this film to the point where they intend to investigate and read about Northern Ireland, and that at the moment they cannot offer an intelligent opinion. Its almost a paradox that this is the attitude of the viewer of a film while the views of american and british readers of books on the subject are so repulsive and ignorant (check out the reviews of the Peter Taylor book 'Loyalists' for an example). I thought it was supposed to be the other way round!! Like the previous reviewers have said this is much too complex a situation to expect a Hollywood blockbuster to do justice to it, you must read, and with the initial outlook of newcomers to this subject both at home (Britain and Ireland) or abroad on this page the chances of the current peace being a lasting one are greatly increased",3,Not really that 'offensive' at all...,1057017600,"07 1,
