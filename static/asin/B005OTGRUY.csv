From the old-school video games sounds in the beginning to the mentions of The Wiz to the dance-off at the end, I was hooked.  If you liked (or loved) Welcome to the Dollhouse and/or Napoleon Dynamite, this movie is for you.I loved that the characters dressed in late 80s/early 90s garb.  That doesn't mean the film is set in that era; they speak frequently of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.Sure, much of the overall plot is easy to figure out, but the way it is presented is entirely unique.  The fact that Spork is a hermaphrodite is certainly new.  The fact she has a dong isn't, by any means, the focus of the movie.

It's a fine mix of ""is it terrible"", ""is it awesome"", ""so terrible it IS awesome"". Not everyone is willing to sit around to find out. Some people are going to love it, some are gonna hate it, and some will be left going ""What did I just watch?"". Which granted was my reaction at first.That said, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. From the first moments I braced myself for a theme of trying too hard to be cool and what eerily reminded me of ""Napoleon Dynamite""..On the surface this movie may seem shallow, taking a cheap shot at trying to be different and over the top. Give it a chance because while it's kind of weird, we're all kind of weird (sometimes). Embrace your closet strangeness and look for the deeper message.

1496820,ABUZCXVWZLHC9,B005OTGRUY,J. T. Sheldon,"[0, 0]","If you like quirky, cute, odd movies about misfits/underdogs, you'll enjoy Spork. It reminds me of two other movies I enjoy, Napoleon Dynamite (the best movie to compare it to) and Welcome to the Dollhouse.The music is fun (Thing-A-Ling is now my ringtone) and the story is random. I know a lot of people who loved Napoleon Dynamite and I know just as many people who hated it. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite I would suggest giving this movie a chance.There are a few stereotypes in the movie (the ghetto black neighor who sprays her hair with afro-sheen and has a daddy in jail anyone?) but despite this I don't think the movie intended to be hurtful. Spork's brother is in fact, white trash. I think it's just a movie about being diferent, finding who you are, and learning to love yourself despite what other people think. Spork comes from a broken home, is considered by her classmates as a white trash loser hermaphrodite freak but she makes friends and learns that wishing to be someone else is pointless and dumb. Love yourself.My favorite part is when Tootsie Roll is talking to Spork after she hurts her leg and is talking about dancing. I tried to look up the quote and couldn't find it, but it's something to the affect of ""When I'm out there, nothing matters. I can be whoever I wanna be, ya know? I'm somewhere far, far away from this shithole.""It's a fun movie, but you can't help but feel the longing Spork and Tootsie Roll feel to be, well, ""far, far away from this shithole.""",4,The Female Napoleon Dynamite,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1492,"['like', 'quirky', 'cute', 'odd', 'movies', 'misfits/underdogs', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Spork', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'best', 'movie', 'compare', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse.The', 'music', 'fun', 'Thing-A-Ling', 'now', 'ringtone', 'story', 'random', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'know', 'just', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'liked', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'would', 'suggest', 'giving', 'movie', 'chance.There', 'are', 'few', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'ghetto', 'black', 'neighor', 'who', 'hair', 'afro-sheen', 'daddy', 'jail', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'hurtful', 'Spork', 'brother', 'fact', 'white', 'trash', 'think', 'just', 'movie', 'being', 'diferent', 'finding', 'who', 'are', 'learning', 'love', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'Spork', 'broken', 'home', 'considered', 'classmates', 'white', 'trash', 'loser', 'hermaphrodite', 'freak', 'friends', 'wishing', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'pointless', 'dumb', 'Love', 'yourself.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'Tootsie', 'Roll', 'talking', 'Spork', 'leg', 'talking', 'dancing', 'tried', 'look', 'up', 'quote', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'something', 'affect', 'When', ""'m"", 'there', 'nothing', 'matters', 'can', 'be', 'whoever', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'ya', 'know', ""'m"", 'somewhere', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'shithole', 'fun', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'longing', 'Spork', 'Tootsie', 'Roll', 'feel', 'be', 'well', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'shithole']",Spork
1496821,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005OTGRUY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 9]","There is no denying that the whimsical ""Spork"" is an underdog story that you really want to root for. Even with its over-the-top performances, rampant quirkiness, and confrontational humor, it really abides by every expected mean girl versus misfit cliche that you can imagine. Yet with its amateur and homemade appeal and its willingness to wallow in bad taste heaven, it feels like a middle school variation of John Waters' ""Hairspray"" (you know, prior to the musical version). I mean that as a compliment, sort of. The film lacks a professional polish that might make it a mainstream crossover. It just seems so inexpensive, so underground, but I'm confident that was the filmmaker's intention. It embraces its badness and tackiness with zealous glee. Some people will find that outrageously entertaining, some might find the picture garish and obvious. I'll admit, I laughed in equal proportion to the amount of time I spent rolling my eyes. I might have more whole-heartedly embraced the lunacy if the screenplay had ever veered from its preordained (and very familiar) plot course. A few surprises would have been nice amidst the inventive combination of bad taste and wistfulness.At the heart of the movie is Savannah Stehlin as Spork. Stehlin has a pleasing deadpan as the bedraggled and relatively lifeless middle school outcast. Taunted and just trying to survive, she must contend with the regular tribulations of junior high existence. There is a ruthless clique of mean girls, a sexually ambiguous love interest, and a sassy neighbor who pushes Spork to participate more fully in the world. At home, Spork lives an impoverished life with her brother and imagines being reunited with her dead mother. She sees her opportunity to make her dreams come true with a school dance competition and, as unlikely as it seems, she faces the challenge head-on. Will pluck and determination be rewarded? Will the mean girls get their comeuppance? Is it possible for Spork to succeed and be accepted? While I won't reveal any surprises--I suspect you'll already know the answers.With every actor embracing loud caricatures of existing stereotypes, it sometimes seems challenging to get to the real heart of ""Spork."" And yet, as the movie progresses, we do get to see the truth behind some of the characters. A late scene between Spork and her brother seems ill-fitting with the rest of the outrageousness, but it is an unexpectedly nuanced moment that adds a needed dimension. Of all the actors, it is the ridiculously upbeat Sydney Park (of course named Tootsie Roll) that manages to steal her every scene. I don't know that I always believed her, but she executed her lines and attitude with hysterical precision. If you like these underdog stories, there are easy reasons to recommend ""Spork."" I, personally, wished the screenplay had been more focused on character but I still had a relatively good time.

1496822,A245I8OVRXDE7X,B005OTGRUY,"melvinmoormanwriter ""I-love you forever JL""","[0, 0]","Spork was a well written story about teenage friendship. The language was a little raw, but getting past that was simple. Tootsie Roll was my favorite character. She expressed strong friendship with Spork and was sympathetic to her as a friend. Those two girls had a communication with one another that did not exist between Spork and the other girls. The patience  Tootsie Roll displayed for Sporks bumbling dancing revealed how close they were. The winnings she gave to Tootsie Roll showed Sporks compassion for her friend. Spork was no doubt concerned that Tootsie Roll have the money to visit her imprisioned father. How many friends do that for ya'. Tootsie Roll was the kind of friend who did not give up on the issues Spork had.All in all Spork the movie kept my interest and entertained me with the comedic characters including her strange brother and his host of friends. The young person in the household here enjoyed the movie so much that she dressed up as Tootsie Roll for Halloween. The likeness was done quite well! She has already watched Spork about 5 times.

This is about a young girl growing up in middle America with over frizzy hair, no friends, no parents, living in a trailer park that some trash would turn their noses up at, with her red neck brother called `Spit'. As if that wasn't enough she is also a hermaphrodite so is endowed with both male and female bits.She is relentlessly picked on or ignored in school and has a life that is as tolerable as being forced to watch community cable channel, in Russian. Yes it is that bad, but no she does have a friend in the uber cool and street wise Tootsie Roll (Sydney Park) she and her ho's are into urban street dance and taking on the Britney wannabes that are the nemesis of Sporks life called `the bee atches'.Then a `Dance Off' is announced and Spork decides that she just has to enter it to prove she isn't a loser and to help Tootsie with the prize money. Problem is she dances as well as my dad at a wedding after 15 pints, and a whisky chaser. So Tootsie and the crew endeavour to help her.This is really funny it is deliberately potty mouthed the whole time, it throws in loads of themes we even have a boy who's parents are gay men and he is subsequently bullied for that, it really makes life at that school seem one step below catching salmonella on the `things I really ought not to do scale'. There is lots of music not just `street' jungle etc but a fair mixture there is gratuitous choreography, explicit taxidermy and full frontal bad make up shots, oh and a De lorean makes an appearance.
