The base of the movie is comedy but I also found myself being anxious and moved to tears, especially at the end.  It's actually a very happy ending, but it makes you cry.  It's also got some nice stunts and a cool car chase.The Christian message of salvation is wonderfully done in this movie and I think appeals to everyone.  I highly highly recommend this movie for your collection and to give to others who need some joy and hope in their lives.",5,Awesome entertaining entertaining comedy with a message,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,615,"['simply', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'moved', 'watching', 'base', 'movie', 'comedy', 'also', 'found', 'being', 'anxious', 'moved', 'tears', 'especially', 'end', 'actually', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'cry', 'also', 'got', 'nice', 'stunts', 'cool', 'car', 'chase.The', 'Christian', 'message', 'salvation', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'movie', 'think', 'appeals', 'everyone', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'collection', 'give', 'others', 'who', 'need', 'joy', 'hope', 'lives']",Road to Redemption VHS

Reminding us that we never know when our time is up. A great movie about a grandfather who desires to get to know his long lost granddaughter, when she finds herself in need of some serious money, then remembers her grandfather who she remembers has LOTS of money. When one scheme turns bad, she is running from the mafia (her boss), and plans another scheme to get money from her grandfather...one thing leads to another, in the end she gives her life over to God...and things change completely. Great movie, lots of action, but short scenes of mild violence, shooting, tense momments. Best for older children or while watching with parents who can explain.",5,Awesome movie!

I'm always looking for good family entertainment and this sounded like a winner, but we were sadly disappointed with this movie.  The acting was poor (except for the main character who is a veteran of film and TV) and the script way below average.  All of my family walked out on this one; I stayed with it till the end and lo and behold the last 5 minutes were the best part of the movie.  Finally the dialogue and people stopped being too cute and too forced and became ""real"".

Botha ""claude777""","[36, 37]","It's always a risk to buy a DVD sight unseen, but I bought this gem based on some reviews I've read and the fact that it's made by Worldwide Pictures who have produced some great movies (Vow to Cherish, Something to sing about).Road to Redemption tells of a young couple Amanda Tucker (the lovely Julie Condra) and Alan Fischer (Jay Underwood) who are sick of struggling along financially so ""borrow"" some money from Amanda's boss who also happens to be a Mob boss, along with the money comes racing tips for some fixed races so off they go to the racing track. All does not go to plan and Amanda finds herself having to leave town to track down her Grandfather Nathan (Pat Hingle) in order to hit him up for some cash so she can pay back her boss.There are some excellent performances put in by the lead actors as well as the supporting mobsters Tony Longo as Vincent the enforcer is very amusing as it Wes Studi as Frank Lightfoot. There are some real funny set pieces in this film and some of it reminded me of the also excellent Dumb and Dumber (minus the crudeness).Road to Redemption  is a family friendly comedy with real heart. It's extremely amusing and a joy to watch. It also very moving and touching as well as Amanda gets to know her Grandfather and learns about what is most important in life. I recommend it whole-heartily for anyone needing a good laugh and it's refreshingly free from smut, foul language and jokes made in bad taste.Enjoy this film and thanks for reading.",5,Very funny and moving,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,1489,"['always', 'risk', 'buy', 'DVD', 'sight', 'unseen', 'bought', 'gem', 'based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'fact', 'made', 'Worldwide', 'Pictures', 'who', 'have', 'produced', 'great', 'movies', 'Vow', 'Cherish', 'Something', 'sing', 'about', '.Road', 'Redemption', 'tells', 'young', 'couple', 'Amanda', 'Tucker', 'lovely', 'Julie', 'Condra', 'Alan', 'Fischer', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'struggling', 'along', 'financially', 'borrow', 'money', 'Amanda', 'boss', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Mob', 'boss', 'money', 'racing', 'tips', 'fixed', 'races', 'so', 'go', 'racing', 'track', 'not', 'go', 'plan', 'Amanda', 'having', 'leave', 'town', 'track', 'down', 'Grandfather', 'Nathan', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'order', 'hit', 'up', 'cash', 'can', 'pay', 'back', 'boss.There', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'put', 'lead', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'mobsters', 'Tony', 'Longo', 'Vincent', 'enforcer', 'very', 'amusing', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'Frank', 'Lightfoot', 'are', 'real', 'funny', 'set', 'pieces', 'film', 'reminded', 'also', 'excellent', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'crudeness', '.Road', 'Redemption', 'family', 'friendly', 'comedy', 'real', 'heart', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'joy', 'watch', 'also', 'very', 'moving', 'touching', 'as', 'well', 'Amanda', 'know', 'Grandfather', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'life', 'recommend', 'whole-heartily', 'anyone', 'needing', 'good', 'laugh', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'smut', 'foul', 'language', 'jokes', 'made', 'bad', 'taste.Enjoy', 'film', 'thanks', 'reading']",Road to Redemption VHS

For Christian movie, this subject is rare, it is a comedy and a road trip movie. If you are not a Christian, you will still enjoy this movie. In the story Amanda (Julie Condra) works for a guy that is probably a mob boss, and her live in boyfriend Alan (Jay Underwood) takes money from her bosses safe. They are broke, and use the money at the race track to no good end. Amanda and her boyfriend face death if they cannot deliver the cash, so she goes on the road to locate her rich grandpa (Pat Hingle) that she has not spoken to since she was a kid. The mob boss orders his thugs to track her down, and Wes Studi is great in this as a mob hit man that seems to telepathically find his prey. When she finds Grandpa, he puts some conditions on helping her, and along the way she comes to learn that even though she has had a very empty life full of sin, God is always there offering redemption.

It's a great insight on following the road to Christ. It's about a couple, Amanda (Julie Condra) and Alan (Jay Underwood) who found stolen mob money. They decide to gamble the money on horse racing and lose the money. The gangsters find out about this and go after the couple. The grandaughter, Amanda seeks the help of her wealthy grandpa Nathan (Pat Hingle) for the money she needs to pay back the mob. But grandpa has plans. It seems he &quot;got religion&quot; and is willing to give her the money. But she has to drive him to visit his favorite fishing hole some 800 miles away. There are some breathe-taking scenes of Utah. So they're all on the run from the mob and along the way learn a valuable lesson of choices and consequences. In the meantime, God gets Amanda's attention and God gives the mob a run for their money. The movie is rated PG for thematic elements and mild violent content, but still a clean Christian movie. It's advised that very young children shouldn't view this. For older teens and adults may find a lesson to be learned that doing something you know is wrong can only get you into deeper trouble. Billy Graham's 'Road to Redemption' is really a great movie with a great message to lead those to Christ.",5,Is the Mob after you?
