164510,A2PYMYL11MW8N5,0800141660,Aaron Wooldridge,"[1, 1]","I found myself in the mood for both a classic ""chick flick"" and a visual introduction to the novels of Jane Austen; so I rented this movie to watch with my fiancee. She enjoyed it, but I think I liked it a lot more. I'm old enough now that I can enjoy movies like this, but I certainly would not have appreciated or enjoyed it 10 years ago when still in my late teens.If you are a man looking for a reason to watch this movie, here's one. It stars 3 people who later became Harry Potter professors: Emma Thompson (amazing actress who played Professor Trelawny and also co-starred with Will Ferrell inStranger Than Fiction), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape who is famous for playing villains inDie HardandQuigley Down Under- it is weird seeing him in this unusal good guy role), and the woman who plays Professor Delores Umbridge, whom we all love to hate in the Harry Potter movies. Also there is a small role for Dr House before he wasHouse, M.D.: Season One, cranky even then because his character was married to Delores Umbridge! And in case you are worried about watching this movie because you hate Hugh Grant from his typical clean-cut British loverboy roles likeNine Months, don't worry about it. He still plays a clean-cut British loverboy in this movie, but he is actually sort of likeable here. It also stars Kate Winslet fromEternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition).I am not going to get into the plot of this movie because you can find that anywhere. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie so much that now I want to read Jane Austen's books.",5,3 Harry Potter professors and Dr House = chick flick a man can enjoy,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,1575,"['found', 'mood', 'classic', 'chick', 'flick', 'visual', 'introduction', 'novels', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'so', 'rented', 'movie', 'watch', 'fiancee', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'liked', 'lot', 'more', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'now', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'appreciated', 'enjoyed', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'still', 'late', 'teens.If', 'are', 'man', 'looking', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'here', 'one', '3', 'people', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'professors', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'amazing', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Professor', 'Trelawny', 'also', 'co-starred', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'inStranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'who', 'famous', 'playing', 'villains', 'inDie', 'HardandQuigley', 'Down', 'Under-', 'weird', 'seeing', 'unusal', 'good', 'guy', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'Professor', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'whom', 'love', 'hate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Also', 'small', 'role', 'Dr', 'House', 'wasHouse', 'M.D', 'Season', 'One', 'even', 'then', 'character', 'was', 'married', 'Delores', 'Umbridge', 'case', 'are', 'worried', 'watching', 'movie', 'hate', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'typical', 'clean-cut', 'British', 'loverboy', 'roles', 'likeNine', 'Months', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'still', 'clean-cut', 'British', 'loverboy', 'movie', 'actually', 'sort', 'likeable', 'here', 'also', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'fromEternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'plot', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'anywhere', 'Suffice', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'now', 'want', 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'books']",Sense & Sensibility
164511,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,0800141660,A Customer,"[8, 9]","Jane Austen was so wonderful at creating reality on the printed page. She sent up society by spot-on accurate portrayals of it. I feel like stressing this point. It sends up pretension by accurately portraying it. It is humour and realism at the same time. I can think of nobody better at doing this.But, that isn't the only reason her writing survives and thrives today. If I, a 21st century American guy, had half her literary gifts, and could do absolutely anything at all with my literary ability, I'd choose to focus it upon the very same issues that Austen did. Meaning, she's every bit as relevant as she was back then.How does that translate to film? In this instance, flawlessly. Emma Thompson wrote an excellent screenplay, Ang Lee directed it wonderfully, everything about this production was equally top-notch, and I'm quite impressed.We look at some events from one character's point of view, then another. Both feel so real, yet they contradict each other in some way. Who's right? Austen was so excellent at capturing those dilemmas. We learn from this. We think about this. And, it's for damn sure we enjoy this.Forgive me for the cliche, but it fits. You see the characters in Austen's novels or this film and you think, ""I know him. I know her."" And, if you're receptive, you notice, ""I do that. Why?"" This is why we write, folks. It's also why we read. We want that feeling, and it stays with us for days.You know I love good dialogue. It's damn hard to get right, isn't it? Jane Austen got it right, every time. You feel what isn't said as much as you do what is said, and it always rings 100% true.Jane Austen also had quite a clever wit. I challenge you to watch this film without laughing at something that is so accurate that you simply have to laugh. You can't do it.Do I need to tell you this one's a keeper? Nah, you probably guessed as much. But I can tell you this. Now I also understand why Jane Austen is so popular in China. Or anywhere else she happens to be popular. This is life, folks.

I hated to see it end, in fact; I could have gone on watching the marvelous cast much longer, and that's saying something. Based on the Jane Austen novel (and deftly adapted by Emma Thompson), the plot is uncomplicated, but never tedious or boring. We can thank a terrific cast for that. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet shine as the Dashwood sisters, Hugh Grant quietly charms, and the supporting cast adds depth and, in some cases, hilarity.Director Ang Lee has quite a wide and accomplished repetoire (&quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;), yet I would not hesitate in listing this film among his best. His accomplishments with this thoroughly British film are even more considerable since he is Asian.

This movie did not disappoint me. The actors and actresses all fit so perfectly into their roles. It was like magic to see them perform.The Dashwood women, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret with along with their mother are forced to leave a life of luxury when Mr. Dashwood dies and they move into a cottage in the country. (Women have no rights to inherit when a man dies.) The money usually is given to the eldest sons in the family. The women must find another means to survive unless the one who inherits is generous enough to allow them to stay on. In this case, the greed of the son's wife overrules the son and the women are pressed upon to leave very quickly.The oldest daughter develops a romantic interest in her half brother's wife's brother-in-law, but the sister-in-law makes certain that they are separated so that nothing more can develop.The younger of the two oldest daughters abandons sensible conduct and rushes headlong into folly with a rake.The two sisters are then taken into London for a season, and the truth is known about both men on their lives. One is already secretly engaged (entrapped is more like it)and the other has proposed to a wealthy woman because of his own bad debts.Everything works out for the best and everyone gets what they deserve in the end.

Even though she's a little too old for Elinor's nineteen, she played the part very well indeed.  The Dashwoods,  under the recent loss of the father, lose their beloved Norland to the  half-brother, John.  John and his selfish wife, Fanny quickly take over.  While still in residence, the Dashwoods are introduced to Fanny's visiting  brother, Edward.  He is shy, but witty.  Hugh Grant plays the part well.  Edward and Elinor form an attachment, but Fanny does not approve.  Her only  wish is to get the Dashwoods out of her house and separate ther brother  from Miss Dashwood.  Recieving a cottage by Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, the  family depart Norland to take up residence in the more affordable home,  surrounded by beautiful countryside and sea side.  Elinor we know is  saddened, but she doesn't show it.  Their landlord, Middleton and his  mother-in-law Mrs. Jennings are overly friendly.  Mrs. Jennings is an  annoying busy body who would be better off learning to mind her own  business.  Sometimes I just wanted to slap her and tell her to shut up!  The best thing to come out of the too-friendly landlord is that the  Dashwoods become aquainted with Colonel Brandon.  Marianne's infatutation  with Willoughby, after he rescues her and carries her home after a tumble  developes into an intense love.  Willoughby  appears to feel the same, but  I got the impression while watching that he didn't care for Marianne as  much as he acted.  Willoughby receives some news and must away, in essence  deserting Marianne.  Her hurt at this terrible loss is touching.  And it  takes her a long time to get over it.  I won't go on and summarize ALL of  the events.  Just watch it yourself.  And forget about Elinor and Edward.  Theirs is a nice little story, but I was far more moved by the storyline  involving Marianne and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman, playing the Colonel  to perfection).  His love for her is amazing.  He is so patient, unselfish,  quietly loving her as she herself is indifferent to him.  Though not as  dashingly handsome as Willoughby, he has more character and is by far the  better man.  I found him much more likeable.  I loved the moment at  Marianne's sickbed when after Colonel Brandon fetches Mrs. Dashwood,  Marianne says &quot;thank you&quot; to him. Anyone who watches this movie  will guess the outcome.  Jane Austen was all about happy endings and having  the right couples get together.  Love conquers all, it's said, and it  certainly does is this film.  And since &quot;Marianne could never love by  halves&quot;, I was very happy with the ending.

164524,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,0800141660,Andrew Raker,"[2, 4]","For being a motion picture and not a miniseries, this 1994 adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is quite good. It does eliminate many scenes, some characters, and alters certain minor elements of plot. However, Thompson does so in probably the most practical manner possible to maintain the overall integrity of the major story: Elinor and Marianne's romances. For people who claim the plot is boring, my only response is (1) that it isn't particularly Austen but (2) it is very interesting for individuals who have never read the novel, so much so that Thompson won an academy award for best screenplay.One other point: some people might consider Thompson too old to play 19-20 year old Elinor Dashwood. From the cover of the DVD case, I'll allow you to make that decision for yourself.Finally, if you are an Austen afficiando and you desire to know exactly where and how the film deviates from the novel, I have provided the following summary. If you have not read ""Sense and Sensiblity"" at least once in its entirety, what follows will not assist you. Also, what follows reveals certain plot details.Changes:Margaret is 11 years old rather than 13.Colonel Brandon is named Colonel Christopher Brandon.Lucy Steele has no sister.Willoughby does not visit Marianne at the Palmers when she is ill.Mrs. Ferrars (i.e. Edward's mother) is never physically shown in the film.Below is a list of changes from the novel. One may assume that items not mentioned as having been changed accurately follow the novel.Mrs. John Dashwood has no children.Mrs. John Dashwood is not as manipulative of her husband as in the novel. She does not properly assist him in lowering and lowering what he plans to do for the Dashwood sisters. (In fact, Mrs. John Dashwood is portrayed as very selfish and rather stupid.)Edward Ferrar's behavior is a little too romantic for the period. Also, Edward almost tells Elinor of his prior engagement to Lucy but then is called away by his mother to London.Barton Cottage is a bit too large and fine, although this is not too obvious.Sir John Middleton has no wife and children.Mrs. Jennings does not ask Marianne to play a song after Marianne has just finished playing the same song.Mrs. Jennings talks to Elinor about Brandon's past love life - details Brandon is supposed to provide at a later date.Willoughby's behavior is also more modernized then it should be. At times, he behaves exceedingly childish and rude (more so than the novel would permit).Lucy Steele does not arrive with her sister to Barton Park. In this film, Lucy has no sister.Lucy does not confide her engagement secret to Elinor outside Barton Cottage but after a diner party at Barton Party.Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings AND the Palmers, since in the film, they ALL travel to London at the same time.Mrs. Jennings, Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne travel to London together. There is not evidence of Marianne being quiet/pensive on the trip because so little time is spent on the carriage ride from Barton Cottage to London. (This also mitigates, in the mind of the viewer, the very long distance between Barton Cottage and London.)[Time between arriving at London and the ball where Marianne sees Willoughby is very minimal.]The ball scene does not show Mrs. John Dashwood's treatment of favoritism toward Lucy at the expense of Elinor.Miss Williams is given the first name of Beth.Elinor tells Marianne about Willoughby's sexual escapades with Beth (i.e. Miss Williams) immediately after learning of them from Colonel Brandon, rather than waiting until the very end of the novel.Lucy returns from the John Dashwood family (where she was a guest) to see Elinor. While Elinor and Lucy are talking, Edward arrives. Instead of Elinor going to fetch Marianne, Marianne, herself, enters. They are only together for a matter of moments before Edward claims he has to leave to perform an errand on Fanny's behalf. Lucy accompanies him.Lucy, herself, tells Mrs. John Dashwood of her love for Edward Ferrars after Mrs. Dashwood claims Lucy is going to marry well.Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he wishes to give the Dellaford living to Edward. However, this conversation takes place outdoors and is very short. Also, Mrs. Jennings is not present to misunderstand their conversation.When the party goes to the Palmers country residence, Mrs. Jennings remains behind.[Time between Willoughby's cruel letter and trip to the Palmers does not adequately show Marianne's decline in health.]When Marianne wanders around outside the Palmers during a thunderstorm, she actually walks across fields, all the way to Willoughby's estate. While looking down upon the estate, she quotes Shakespeare's sonnet, ""Love is not love which alters...""Marianne falls ill and is brought back to the Palmers by Colonel Brandon.Mrs. Palmer is hysterical when Dr. Harris says that Marianne's fever is infectious and that she should remove her baby from the house.Willoughby does NOT visit the Palmers during Marianne's illness to justify his behavior. He doesn't appear at all.Immediately after Colonel Brandon arrives with Mrs. Dashwood to Marianne's bedside, the scene shifts back to Barton Cottage where Colonel Brandon is reading poetry to Marianne, who is still recovering her strength.Colonel Brandon gives Marianne a small piano for Barton Cottage.A double marriage occurs at the same time between Colonel Brandon and Marianne Dashwood & Edward Ferrars and Elinor Dashwood.Scene with Willoughby looking down upon the cottage - seems to be with an air of regret.Film ends with Colonel Brandon throwing handfuls of coins into the air for the villages (and others) who came to help celebrate his marriage to Marianne Dashwood.FINAL THOUGHTS:While I have pointed out basically everything that I completely diehard literalist might find uncharacteristic, this film is certainly NOT a bad one. While absolute literalists might prefer the Davies' adaptation of 2008, I certain recommend this adaptation as worthy or watching. Even Austen literalists should be able to appreciate this work, even though, like me, they might make of list (either literally or mentally) of all the changes.",4,Better than I

164527,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,0800141660,anna-joelle,"[24, 25]","Don't miss this movie! It's a brilliant adaptation of the Jane Austen classic and simply lovely to watch. Emma Thompson did an excellent job on the screenplay, and deservedly won an Oscar for her efforts.I agree that  in the age department, Emma Thompson was not suited to carry the role of  Elinor Dashwood (who's supposed to be only 19). However, Ms Thompson's  acting was brilliant and flawless, and as the story unfolds and draws you  in, you hardly remember to notice or care about the age factor anymore. I  thought Emma Thompson's portrayal of Elinor was not unlike the character of  Margaret Schlegel (which she played in &quot;Howards End&quot;) who's also  a kind gentlewoman who loves too much and suffers inwardly.As a story,  &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (S&amp;S) has a far more serious premise  compared to 2 other Austen works ie. &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Mansfield  Park&quot;. Perhaps this partly explains why S&amp;S is the more  highly-acclaimed movie (it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars)  compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's &quot;Emma&quot; and Frances O'Connor's  &quot;Manfield Park&quot;. In S&amp;S, there are very sad scenes involving  unrequited love, quiet suffering (Elinor's and Col. Brandon's) and long  illness (Marianne's). Many scenes will make you reach for that box of  tissues eg. when the always calm-and-collected Elinor burst into  uncontrollable tears the moment she hears the (happy) truth concerning  Edward Ferrar's situation, and when Marianne (still lying ill in her bed)  thanks Col. Brandon softly (for all his help and kindness).I also admire  Alan Rickman's acting. He is perfect as Col. Brandon, a very good man whose  love for Marianne is (sadly) unrequited. His love is of the best kind - he  doesn't court with (empty) flowery words, instead he displays so much care,  concern, lovingness and tenderness by his every look towards Marianne and  by his every action to make her well and happy. I was nicely surprised that  in the movie, Col. Brandon looks more dashing and handsome than John  Willoughby (to me anyway).Kate Winslet's &quot;Marianne&quot; is  adorable as well. She sings beautifully and has such grace and beauty that  it's no wonder men fell in love with her at first sight.I shall not give  away the ending, of course. But for the benefit of any viewer who have not  read the novel but wish for a better and more satisfying understanding of  the final scene involving Marianne, just remember the following sentence  which I quote from the novel:&quot;Marianne could never love by  halves.&quot;",4,Loved It!,958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,2579,"['Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'simply', 'lovely', 'watch', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'screenplay', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'efforts.I', 'agree', 'age', 'department', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'not', 'suited', 'carry', 'role', 'Elinor', 'Dashwood', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'only', '19', 'However', 'Ms', 'Thompson', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'flawless', 'story', 'unfolds', 'draws', 'hardly', 'remember', 'notice', 'care', 'age', 'factor', 'anymore', 'thought', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'portrayal', 'Elinor', 'was', 'not', 'character', 'Margaret', 'Schlegel', 'played', 'quot', 'Howards', 'End', 'quot', 'who', 'also', 'kind', 'gentlewoman', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'suffers', 'inwardly.As', 'story', 'quot', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'S', 'amp', 'S', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'premise', 'compared', '2', 'other', 'Austen', 'ie', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'Perhaps', 'partly', 'why', 'S', 'amp', 'S', 'more', 'highly-acclaimed', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars', 'compared', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'quot', 'Manfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'S', 'amp', 'S', 'are', 'very', 'sad', 'scenes', 'involving', 'unrequited', 'love', 'quiet', 'suffering', 'Elinor', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'long', 'illness', 'Marianne', 'Many', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'reach', 'box', 'tissues', 'eg', 'when', 'always', 'calm-and-collected', 'Elinor', 'burst', 'uncontrollable', 'tears', 'moment', 'happy', 'truth', 'concerning', 'Edward', 'Ferrar', 'situation', 'when', 'Marianne', 'still', 'lying', 'ill', 'bed', 'thanks', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'softly', 'help', 'kindness', '.I', 'also', 'admire', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'acting', 'perfect', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'love', 'Marianne', 'sadly', 'unrequited', 'love', 'best', 'kind', ""n't"", 'court', 'empty', 'flowery', 'words', 'instead', 'so', 'much', 'care', 'concern', 'lovingness', 'tenderness', 'look', 'Marianne', 'action', 'make', 'well', 'happy', 'was', 'nicely', 'surprised', 'movie', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'more', 'dashing', 'handsome', 'John', 'Willoughby', 'anyway', '.Kate', 'Winslet', 'quot', 'Marianne', 'quot', 'adorable', 'as', 'well', 'beautifully', 'such', 'grace', 'beauty', 'wonder', 'men', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'sight.I', 'shall', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'course', 'benefit', 'viewer', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'wish', 'better', 'more', 'satisfying', 'understanding', 'final', 'scene', 'involving', 'Marianne', 'just', 'remember', 'following', 'sentence', 'quote', 'novel', 'quot', 'Marianne', 'could', 'never', 'love', 'halves.', 'quot']",Sense & Sensibility

I don't understand why they made the decision to cast her as 19 year old Elinor, she just doesn't pull it off, and i found it distracting. If you are an Austin purist, and you haven't watched either version, my advice would be......start with the movie.

However, as it stands, Emma Thompson deserved her distinction as being not only a gifted actor but also an award winning screenwriter. I wish there were more people in Hollywood like her! Ang Lee is probably one of the most talented directors today. He reminds me of Stanley Kubrick in the fact that he likes to tackle different genres of film. Lee went from a contemporary Asian family-drama (Eat Drink Man Woman) to a Jane Austen period piece (Sense & Sensibility) and pulled it off. It is a shame that he does not have one Academy Award for his directorial efforts because he is more talented than some winning directors are. The acting is wonderful, with Kate Winslet really giving a passionate performance. Emma Thompson played Elinor well (despite the age of the character being much younger). To me she displayed wonderfully Elinor's sensibleness and self-control, until a very uplifting scene at the end.

Well, this splendid adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel did just that in 1996, combining fabulous writing (and acting) of Emma Thompson and great directing of Ang Lee (""The Wedding Banquet"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").Other performances are also first-class. Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant shine (personally, I've never seen a role to be so fitting for Grant, although ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""About a Boy"" came close). The whole cast is flawless.When the film came out, even the self-proclaimed film saviour Quentin Tarantino could not help himself but quip: ""Who the F... is Jane Austen?"" Yes, this English author who lived 200 years ago wrote only romantic novels about girls (and men) who are in want of a spouse. But she achieved perfencion in this very limited space (the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" is probably the best). In this movie, the very human side -- the desire not to be alone, to spend a lifetime with the One -- is described with power. Finding the true love was the prime thing for the two Dashwood sisters. But, is it still not true for most of us, even in this cold, material world?Emma Thompson, already an Oscar winner for her leading role in ""Howards End"" (1992), won the Oscar for this film's adapted screenplay, becoming the first artist ever to achieve such a feat -- winning the Academy Awards for both acting and writing.Apart from saving all important aspects of the story, Thompson included very poignant and sharp moments in the script. When her character Elinor and Edward Ferrars (played by Grant) are on a cruise ride, she says, 'you inherit your money. We cannot even make it,' hinting at the situation of middle class women two centuries ago, when their fortunes depended heavily either on inheritance from father or property of husband -- and it was imaginable they should go to work. A great social commentary.Beatifully shot, with delicate music score by Patrick Doyle, ""Sense and Sensibility"" is predominantly an entertaining film. But its social and human undertones are undeniable. It did win Berlin festival and the Golden Globe, but lost the Oscar race to ""Braveheart"". Maybe for the lack of great human topic that would rank it along ""Schindler's List"" or ""The English Patient"". Yet I feel that there was not the film in 1995 to deserve the big Oscar more than this one.If you have sense and sensbility, you will laugh and you will cry.

164533,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,0800141660,A_Plain_Janeite,"[1, 1]","This movie was my first taste of Jane Austen.  I have to admit, when it first came out I was a kid, so I wrote it off as boring and didn't bother to watch.  In my teens I realized that I actually liked period drama's, and this movie quickly became a favorite of mine!The movie itself, as a period drama is first class!  Although it isn't completely faithful to the book, it is my favorite of the adaptations I've seen ('07, and '81).  The casting is superb (although 2 of the actors were a bit older than their book counterparts); and their acting leaps & bounds better than the '81!  The scenery, and stately homes are stunning!!  Also, the soundtrack fits the period, and compliments the storyline very well.Most likely, if the viewer hasn't read the book, the alterations, and missing characters shouldn't affect their opinion much._______**SPOILER ALERT**As for the (most notable) missing scenes/parts:- Willoughby's visit, and conversation with Elinor at Cleveland (during Marianne's sickness).  The movie tried to rectify it by way of Col. Brandon.  After his revealing Willoughby's seduction of his ward to Elinor, he proceeds to tell her he inquired, and has reason to believe that Willoughby's intentions were not entirely as dishonorable toward Marianne...It's not quite as satisfying as hearing it come from Willoughby himself though.- Edward's week stay, not long after they arrived (on his way back from visiting Lucy in Plymouth).  The book scene conveyed the troubled mind of Edward, and his internal conflicting feelings as regards Elinor, and Lucy.And provided a hint of what was to come, with the lock of hair seen by all in his ring (which he passed off as Fanny's, and the Dashwood sisters supposed he somehow obtained a lock of Elinor's without her knowing).- The dinner party with Mrs. Ferrars & Jennings, the Dashwood's, Steels', and Middleton's.  Not a major loss there, being that Fanny made it clear at the beginning that their mother expected Edward to marry a woman of means and fortune, otherwise suffer being disinherited.And before revealing her engagement, Lucy told Elinor she finally met Mrs. Ferrars (after being invited to stay with the J. Dashwood's in London).______The missing characters:I personally don't mind the fact that Lady Middleton (& children) were left out (the movie stated Sir John was a widower).In the book, Miss Austen describes her as ""(though perfectly well bred,) she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place enquiry or remark"".With that said, it wasn't that much of a loss to leave her out being that she and Mrs. (John) Dashwood were so much alike (""there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathized with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanour, and a general want of understanding"").In the book, all she really did was dote on her children, and play hostess.They also left out the other Miss Steel, which wasn't a big deal either.  They just had Lucy out herself to Fanny instead.",5,"""Sense & Sensibility"" Condensed",1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3054,"['movie', 'was', 'first', 'taste', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'have', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'kid', 'wrote', 'off', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'teens', 'realized', 'actually', 'liked', 'period', 'drama', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'mine', 'movie', 'period', 'drama', 'first', 'class', ""n't"", 'completely', 'faithful', 'book', 'favorite', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'07"", 'casting', 'superb', '2', 'actors', 'were', 'bit', 'older', 'book', 'counterparts', 'acting', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'better', ""'81"", 'scenery', 'stately', 'homes', 'are', 'stunning', 'Also', 'soundtrack', 'period', 'storyline', 'very', 'well.Most', 'likely', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'alterations', 'missing', 'characters', 'should', ""n't"", 'affect', 'opinion', 'much._______**SPOILER', 'ALERT**As', 'most', 'notable', 'missing', 'scenes/parts', 'Willoughby', 'visit', 'conversation', 'Elinor', 'Cleveland', 'Marianne', 'sickness', 'movie', 'tried', 'rectify', 'way', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'revealing', 'Willoughby', 'seduction', 'ward', 'Elinor', 'tell', 'inquired', 'reason', 'believe', 'Willoughby', 'intentions', 'were', 'not', 'entirely', 'dishonorable', 'Marianne', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'satisfying', 'hearing', 'come', 'Willoughby', 'though.-', 'Edward', 'week', 'stay', 'not', 'long', 'arrived', 'way', 'back', 'visiting', 'Lucy', 'Plymouth', 'book', 'scene', 'conveyed', 'troubled', 'mind', 'Edward', 'internal', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'regards', 'Elinor', 'Lucy.And', 'provided', 'hint', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'lock', 'hair', 'seen', 'ring', 'passed', 'off', 'Fanny', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'supposed', 'somehow', 'obtained', 'lock', 'Elinor', 'knowing', '.-', 'dinner', 'party', 'Mrs.', 'Ferrars', 'Jennings', 'Dashwood', 'Steels', 'Middleton', 'Not', 'major', 'loss', 'there', 'being', 'Fanny', 'made', 'clear', 'beginning', 'mother', 'expected', 'Edward', 'marry', 'woman', 'means', 'fortune', 'otherwise', 'suffer', 'being', 'disinherited.And', 'revealing', 'engagement', 'Lucy', 'told', 'Elinor', 'finally', 'met', 'Mrs.', 'Ferrars', 'being', 'invited', 'stay', 'J.', 'Dashwood', 'London', '.______The', 'missing', 'characters', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'Lady', 'Middleton', 'children', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'stated', 'Sir', 'John', 'was', 'widower', 'book', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'perfectly', 'well', 'bred', 'was', 'reserved', 'cold', 'had', 'nothing', 'say', 'most', 'common-place', 'enquiry', 'remark', '.With', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'loss', 'leave', 'out', 'being', 'Mrs.', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'was', 'kind', 'cold', 'hearted', 'selfishness', 'sides', 'mutually', 'attracted', 'sympathized', 'other', 'insipid', 'propriety', 'demeanour', 'general', 'want', 'understanding', '.In', 'book', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'dote', 'children', 'play', 'hostess.They', 'also', 'left', 'out', 'other', 'Miss', 'Steel', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'just', 'had', 'Lucy', 'out', 'Fanny', 'instead']",Sense & Sensibility

I was really blown away by her performance and her portrayal of the passionate, idealistic and beautiful Marianne! She was so convincing in her role that Marianne has become one of my favourite heroines by Jane Austen after Elizabeth Bennet and Anne Elliot!'to die for love, what could be more glorious than that?!' This is what Marianne says to her mother very early in the movie. And with this statement, Marianne already gives a glimpse of the passionate side of her character, how far she can go for love, to win the heart of the dashing Willoughby. But this statement also raises some important question about the meaning of true love? 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Is it better to love like Marianne intensely, passionately and to be so blinded by it that you don't even see the flaws of the person that you love? Doesn't passionate love involve some pain sometimes? The film gives us some answers implicitly and it is up to you to see if the answer is to your liking.Kate Winslet is surrounded by an impressive cast, Allan Rickman (what a man!!!, great performance and his intense looks towards Marianne!) as Colonel Brandon, Emma Thompson as Elinor, Greg Wise (I think) as Willoughby (the ultimate heartbreaker, he embodies the tall-dark-handsome womanizer to the perfection) and Hugh Grant (not spectacular but still worth it). Nothing bad to say about all these wonderful actors. They know their job. Plus, they are in a Ang Lee film...Ang Lee`s filming technique (Brokeback Mountain) is seen again throughout this adaptation, in the camera long shots of the actors, horse- riding or walking in the countryside, in the setting too..I just have one more thing to add, E. Thompson's screenplay is brilliant, she has managed to give a sexy, very manly touch to the male characters.

I think it captures much of the spirit of Austen's book, if not exactly faithful to her words.  I think the one thing the movie perhaps cannot convey or which falls a bit short is the Lucy Steele/Edward connection.  In the book, it is quite obvious that Lucy is only interested in Edward for his position and money.  Hugh Grant plays a charming, handsome, likable Edward whom Lucy might really have loved.  A large part of Elinor's story is missed by downplaying Lucy & her awareness of Elinor as a rival.  I missed that aspect.

If you are a Jane Austen fan, then by all means pick this film up.The book was very good as well though long and confusing in the beginning at least. I dare say though that just like Pride and Prejudice, you should see the film first before reading the book. It will make the reading so much easier for you in the end.The story is simple enough. It's about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Marianne is basically open to everyone about everything and Elinore keeps her emotions and feeling in deep check.

Wilson ""Atheen""","[2, 2]","While Pride and Prejudice,Pride And Prejudice, is my favorite Austin novel, Sense and Sensibility,Sense and Sensibility (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N; Classics), comes in a close second, and this film version is my favorite.  How could one complain with such a stellar cast?Nearly every character is played by a seasoned veteran of British television, theater and cinema.  Hugh Grant plays a very convincing and understated Mr. Edward Ferrars.  His pregnant pauses and stuttered responses suggest a man so overwhelmed by society that he is afraid to utter anything at all.  Emma Thompson's Miss Elinor Dashwood, the tower of strength her family depends upon to keep the family circumstances afloat, is a total triumph.  The finale, where she finally comes unglued, is so in keeping with the tension with which the character has been dealing throughout the story.  Kate Winslet, while generally not my favorite actress, does a fantastic portrayal of Maryann Dshwood, the headstrong and emotional sister who plunges headlong into a romance and almost comes to disaster when her hero proves to be made of clay.  Even the youngest sister Margaret whose perky personality is put across despite her infrequent appearance on the screen, leaves one wondering what became of her and what she thought about these events later in life.  Someone should write her story.  Alan Rickman, at last in a romantic rather than a sinister role, is a wonderfully restrained suitor of Maryann.  He is a man of strong emotions kept bearly under control.  Harriet Walter, the heroine of the Lord Peter Whimsey mystery series,Lord Peter Wimsey - The Complete Collection, is here a wonderfully nasty sister-in-law of the Dashwood girls, and her response to the secret engagement of her older brother to her young protege, Lucy Steel, is a comedic masterpiece. Mrs. Jennings the inquisitive inlaw of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin Sir John Middleton, is played by Elizabeth Spriggs, an actress with whose creative talents I became familiar through her appearances on one of my favorite murder mystery programs, Midsommer Murders,Midsomer Murders: Set 14.  I've come to admire her talent for creating some truely memorable characters.  Her son-in-law, Sir John, played by Robert Hardy, is also familiar to me from this venue, as were some of the other minor characters.As always, the scenery and costumes were fantastic.  Some of the indoor cinematography of people together in small groups reminded me of Vermeer paintings.  The intimacy of interiors lighted by candle light was splendid and gave the viewer a feeling of actually being part of the occasion; there was no sense that there were cameras running and bright lights illuminating a stage.  Even in the ambiance of the ball during the sisters' ""season"" in London there was  a sense of privacy and of a closed society known well only to one another.A visual treat.",5,Intense and intimate portrayal of Austin's tale.,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,2894,"['Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'favorite', 'Austin', 'novel', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'Classics', 'Series', 'B', 'N', 'Classics', 'close', 'second', 'film', 'version', 'favorite', 'How', 'could', 'one', 'complain', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Nearly', 'character', 'played', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'British', 'television', 'theater', 'cinema', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'very', 'convincing', 'understated', 'Mr.', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'stuttered', 'responses', 'suggest', 'man', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'society', 'afraid', 'utter', 'anything', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Miss', 'Elinor', 'Dashwood', 'tower', 'strength', 'family', 'keep', 'family', 'circumstances', 'afloat', 'total', 'triumph', 'finale', 'where', 'finally', 'unglued', 'so', 'keeping', 'tension', 'character', 'been', 'dealing', 'story', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'generally', 'not', 'favorite', 'actress', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'Maryann', 'Dshwood', 'headstrong', 'emotional', 'sister', 'who', 'headlong', 'romance', 'almost', 'disaster', 'when', 'hero', 'be', 'made', 'clay', 'Even', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Margaret', 'perky', 'personality', 'put', 'infrequent', 'appearance', 'screen', 'one', 'wondering', 'what', 'became', 'what', 'thought', 'events', 'later', 'life', 'Someone', 'should', 'write', 'story', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'last', 'romantic', 'rather', 'sinister', 'role', 'wonderfully', 'restrained', 'suitor', 'Maryann', 'man', 'strong', 'emotions', 'kept', 'bearly', 'control', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'heroine', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Whimsey', 'mystery', 'series', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'here', 'wonderfully', 'nasty', 'sister-in-law', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'response', 'secret', 'engagement', 'older', 'brother', 'young', 'protege', 'Lucy', 'Steel', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'inquisitive', 'inlaw', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'cousin', 'Sir', 'John', 'Middleton', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Spriggs', 'actress', 'creative', 'talents', 'became', 'familiar', 'appearances', 'one', 'favorite', 'murder', 'mystery', 'programs', 'Midsommer', 'Murders', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Set', '14', ""'ve"", 'come', 'admire', 'talent', 'creating', 'truely', 'memorable', 'characters', 'son-in-law', 'Sir', 'John', 'played', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'also', 'familiar', 'venue', 'were', 'other', 'minor', 'characters.As', 'always', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'were', 'fantastic', 'indoor', 'cinematography', 'people', 'together', 'small', 'groups', 'reminded', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'intimacy', 'interiors', 'lighted', 'candle', 'light', 'was', 'splendid', 'gave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'actually', 'being', 'part', 'occasion', 'was', 'sense', 'were', 'cameras', 'running', 'bright', 'lights', 'illuminating', 'stage', 'Even', 'ambiance', 'ball', 'sisters', 'season', 'London', 'was', 'sense', 'privacy', 'closed', 'society', 'known', 'well', 'only', 'one', 'another.A', 'visual', 'treat']",Sense & Sensibility

I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since ""Pride and Prejudice"". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first.  I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles.

The actors and actresses all fit so perfectly into their roles.  It was like magic to see them perform.The Dashwood women, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret with along with their mother are forced to leave a life of luxury when Mr. Dashwood dies and they move into a cottage in the country. (Women have no rights to inherit when a man dies.)  The money usually is given to the eldest sons in the family.  The women must find another means to survive unless the one who inherits is generous enough to allow them to stay on.  In this case, the greed of the son's wife overrules the son and the women are pressed upon to leave very quickly.The oldest daughter develops a romantic interest in her half brother's wife's brother-in-law, but the sister-in-law makes certain that they are separated so that nothing more can develop.The younger of the two oldest daughters abandons sensible conduct and rushes headlong into folly with a rake.The two sisters are then taken into London for a season, and the truth is known about both men on their lives.  One is already secretly engaged (entrapped is more like it)and the other has proposed to a wealthy woman because of his own bad debts.Everything works out for the best and everyone gets what they deserve in the end.

I found it slow, almost tedious and I had to force myself to finish it.  It lacks the sparkle of her other novels and I did not see at all what Eleanor saw in Edward in the book.  He was dull, dull, dull.I found Emma Thompson's screenplay much more upbeat, witty and fun than the book and the casting helps as well.  Emma is spot-on as Eleanor, so proper and honorable.  Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne - all emotion and passion running headlong before thought.  Greg Wise was absolutely yummy as Willoughby whose character got a bit kinder treatment from Ms Thompson than from Ms Austen.  And Alan Rickman was terrific as the lovelorn but stalwart Colonel Brandon.  Even Hugh Grant was welcome in the role of Edward (though I must say, I'm not a fan).Also some great performances from the supporting cast:  Hugh Laurie was amusing as the snide Mr Palmer;  Harriett Walter as the snobbish and nasty Fanny;  Robert Hardy as the silly Sir John and Elizabeth Spriggs as the nosy Mrs. Jennings.As I said before I enjoyed this treatment better than the book.If you liked this, also try Persuasion starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root(not to mention the more obvious Pride and Prejudice and Emma).  Persuasion was, I believe, Ms Austen's last novel and it's definitely more contemplative and low-key in nature.

There are only people, such as Willoughby, who are pressed by circumstances into being cruel to those who love them.

She also wrote the screenplay. The DVD includes her speech upon acceptance of the Golden Globe, and it is a classic. In it, she acknowledges that they owe it all to Jane Austen, and then asks what Miss Austen would say if she were there. She then read her (Jane Austen's) speech, and it was perfect!

In Britain of that time, that was all that they could do.  Their father's estate was entailed, which means that most of it automatically passed to their half-brother.  Women in that time were not educated beyond basic literacy and numeracy, and most well-paying occupations were closed to them by either law or custom.  In a Catholic country (say, Spain or Italy) young ladies in the Dashwood girls' position would have had the option of becoming nuns, but in Protestant Britain even that was not an option--it was marriage or nothing.Did Jane's unpitying, but nonjudgmental, portrayal of this situation lead to the nascient feminist movement of the later 19th century, which saw educational and occupational opportunities for women open up and legal reforms that enabled women to control their own money and property?  Perhaps, indirectly; certainly her novels brought the situation to people's minds, and probably got them thinking about it far more than more polemical writings would have.I did think that the one sister's mooning after Willoughby got a bit tiresome, but I think it was supposed to be.  And, after he lead the other sister on so much and then allowed her to think that he'd married someone else (the someone else married his brother--nice bit of casting, the actor who played the brother did look enough like Hugh Grant to be his less-handsome brother) and then came calling to propose that she should have taken one of the pewter candlesticks on the table and whapped him upside the head with it before accepting the proposal.My father has four sisters, and says that the way the girls bickered and fussed at each other is absolutely on target.As for some of the actors/actresses being too old for their parts, remember that in those days people didn't live as long as they do now.  In terms of life-stage they were right; a modern performer of the chronological age of the book's characters would be too immature.My main quarrel with this movie was the music.  Not the music itself, which I liked (it was specially composed, but sounded period; the main theme, for example, sounded like a snippit from a Beethoven piano concerto) but the performance.  The piano used was obviously a modern instrument; pianos of the period had a thinner, lighter, sound than modern ones do--the fortepiano was marked, after all, as an enhanced harpsichord.  To see the characters playing on little spinnets and hearing a Boesendorfer was a bit disconcerting.",3,Making the best of it.,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,2874,"['One', 'might', 'nitpick', 'how', 'bit', 'original', 'novel', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'taken', 'out', 'whole', 'good', 'adaptation.Unlike', 'authors', ""'social"", 'novels', 'Jane', 'did', 'not', 'invite', 'become', 'angry', 'unjust', 'social', 'situations', 'did', 'counsel', 'resign', 'simply', 'presented', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.The', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'had', 'get', 'married', 'Britain', 'time', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'Their', 'father', 'estate', 'was', 'entailed', 'most', 'automatically', 'passed', 'half-brother', 'Women', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'educated', 'basic', 'literacy', 'numeracy', 'most', 'well-paying', 'occupations', 'were', 'closed', 'law', 'custom', 'Catholic', 'country', 'say', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'young', 'ladies', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'position', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'option', 'becoming', 'nuns', 'Protestant', 'Britain', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'option', 'was', 'marriage', 'nothing.Did', 'Jane', 'unpitying', 'nonjudgmental', 'portrayal', 'situation', 'lead', 'nascient', 'feminist', 'movement', 'later', '19th', 'century', 'saw', 'educational', 'occupational', 'opportunities', 'women', 'open', 'up', 'legal', 'reforms', 'enabled', 'women', 'control', 'own', 'money', 'property', 'Perhaps', 'indirectly', 'certainly', 'novels', 'brought', 'situation', 'people', 'minds', 'probably', 'got', 'thinking', 'far', 'more', 'more', 'polemical', 'writings', 'would', 'have.I', 'did', 'think', 'one', 'sister', 'mooning', 'Willoughby', 'got', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'lead', 'other', 'sister', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'allowed', 'think', ""'d"", 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'else', 'married', 'brother', 'nice', 'bit', 'casting', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'brother', 'did', 'look', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'be', 'less-handsome', 'brother', 'then', 'came', 'calling', 'propose', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'one', 'pewter', 'candlesticks', 'table', 'whapped', 'head', 'accepting', 'proposal.My', 'father', 'four', 'sisters', 'way', 'girls', 'bickered', 'fussed', 'other', 'absolutely', 'target.As', 'actors/actresses', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'parts', 'remember', 'days', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'now', 'terms', 'life-stage', 'were', 'right', 'modern', 'performer', 'chronological', 'age', 'book', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'immature.My', 'main', 'quarrel', 'movie', 'was', 'music', 'Not', 'music', 'liked', 'was', 'specially', 'composed', 'sounded', 'period', 'main', 'theme', 'example', 'sounded', 'snippit', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'concerto', 'performance', 'piano', 'used', 'was', 'obviously', 'modern', 'instrument', 'pianos', 'period', 'had', 'thinner', 'lighter', 'sound', 'modern', 'ones', 'do', 'fortepiano', 'was', 'marked', 'enhanced', 'harpsichord', 'see', 'characters', 'playing', 'little', 'spinnets', 'hearing', 'Boesendorfer', 'was', 'bit', 'disconcerting']",Sense & Sensibility

Then Shamus goes on about how this is a feminist movie, and that the Evil British Empire and Evil America were all about slaves and nothing else...sigh...There is a time and place for politics, but I wanted to hear about the FILM and to hear it from the director, not the self-centered Shamus who continually interrupted Lee, continually brought the conversation back to his political views, and disallowed any real discussion of the film.Ang Lee is a respected filmmaker.

Both are bachelorettes whose father has recently died and left them virtually impoverished, and who seem to want nothing more than to get married.  The movie is set in 19th century England, and given the customs in those days, I suppose it was acceptable for marriage to be a woman's only aspiration in life.  Of course, marriage in that day-in-age was more of a merging of two people of similar social and economic stature than a solidification of love.  Elinor (Thompson) is the ""sensible"" and conservative sister who comes off as comically prudish, and Marianne (Winslet) is younger and starry-eyed.  Marianne is courted by two gentlemen, and Elinor is courted by a man named Edward Ferrars (played by Hugh Grant), who is actually engaged to someone else, and has been for five years.  The only real suspense is in who will marry whom in the end.  Without giving away the ending, I'll only say that I was disappointed that both sisters married men who were not deserving of women of their high class.This movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and I can see why.  It's visually attractive, the costumes are very interesting, the dialogue is extremely smart, and the performances by Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are very good.

164565,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,0800141660,Bookphile,"[6, 7]","The worst thing a person can do is underestimate Jane Austen.  Though it is true that her stories center on young women and their romantic struggles, her works are not mere romance novels.  This film does a wonderful job of demonstrating that.Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress and she really brings Elinor to life.  At times she seems almost cold and unfeeling but she is actually a woman who keeps her own counsel and who is very aware of how society views young women.  Better to be thought a cold woman than to make a mockery of herself in the eyes of others.  Thompson is at her best in those brief moments when Elinor is alone, when she is gazing sadly at her sister while she plays pianoforte, when she is alone in her room and running her fingers over the monogram embroidered on a handkerchief.  Elinor is actually quite a complex character, a woman who loves deeply and wholly but who is also very self and socially aware.Her polar opposite is her sister Marianne and Kate Winslet is simply perfect in the role.  She captures Marianne's youthful exuberance and the blissful lack of awareness that she has for what others think of her.  In this day and age, such individuality would be encouraged but in Marianne's time it is seen as a fatal flaw, one that risks making her the target of ridicule of others.  She follows her heart over her head, unlike Elinor.  As the title indicate, Marianne is all sensibility while her sister is all sense.Hugh Grant does a nice job of portraying the somewhat socially awkward and very shy Edward.  He always looks uncomfortable in his skin and only seems to relax when he is with Elinor or when he is brushing up on his sword wielding skills with Margaret.  Edward exemplifies the plight of the younger sons of the era, the need to please the family in order to maintain his position.  This was not a time when going it alone was encouraged or even feasible.  It is Edward's sense of honor and duty that are almost his undoing and, in some ways, his situation is no better than that of the women.  Though he is ostensibly free to choose his profession, he is actually quite subject to the whims of his mother and his vicious social-climbing sister.The most surprising and rewarding bits of casting lie with Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.  His world weariness and deep sadness are visible in every line of Rickman's face.  He has seen what society can do to a young woman determined to follow her passions as Marianne is and it has left a deep impression upon him.  Though Elinor has a good grasp of the world, Brandon understands it even better and one of the finest scenes of the movie is the one in which he chides Elinor not to wish for her sister to become acquainted with the ways of the world.Emma Thompson did a fine job of writing the screenplay for this movie, cutting out some of the less essential bits and lifting quite a bit of the dialogue directly from the text.  Ang Lee's direction is lovely and his shots are framed with such care.  Often his cast doesn't even need to speak, they simply need to observe and Lee does a wonderful job of capturing the characters' emotions in their quieter moments.",5,A Social Commentary,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,3165,"['worst', 'thing', 'person', 'can', 'do', 'underestimate', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'true', 'stories', 'center', 'young', 'women', 'romantic', 'struggles', 'works', 'are', 'not', 'mere', 'romance', 'novels', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'that.Emma', 'Thompson', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'really', 'Elinor', 'life', 'times', 'almost', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'actually', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'counsel', 'who', 'very', 'aware', 'how', 'society', 'views', 'young', 'women', 'Better', 'be', 'thought', 'cold', 'woman', 'make', 'mockery', 'herself', 'eyes', 'others', 'Thompson', 'best', 'brief', 'moments', 'when', 'Elinor', 'alone', 'when', 'gazing', 'sadly', 'sister', 'pianoforte', 'when', 'alone', 'room', 'running', 'fingers', 'monogram', 'embroidered', 'handkerchief', 'Elinor', 'actually', 'quite', 'complex', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'deeply', 'wholly', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'self', 'socially', 'aware.Her', 'polar', 'opposite', 'sister', 'Marianne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'simply', 'perfect', 'role', 'Marianne', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'blissful', 'lack', 'awareness', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'day', 'age', 'such', 'individuality', 'would', 'be', 'encouraged', 'Marianne', 'time', 'seen', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'one', 'making', 'target', 'ridicule', 'others', 'heart', 'head', 'Elinor', 'title', 'indicate', 'Marianne', 'sensibility', 'sister', 'sense.Hugh', 'Grant', 'nice', 'job', 'portraying', 'somewhat', 'socially', 'awkward', 'very', 'shy', 'Edward', 'always', 'uncomfortable', 'skin', 'only', 'relax', 'when', 'Elinor', 'when', 'brushing', 'up', 'sword', 'wielding', 'skills', 'Margaret', 'Edward', 'plight', 'younger', 'sons', 'era', 'need', 'please', 'family', 'order', 'maintain', 'position', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'when', 'going', 'alone', 'was', 'encouraged', 'even', 'feasible', 'Edward', 'sense', 'honor', 'duty', 'are', 'almost', 'undoing', 'ways', 'situation', 'better', 'women', 'ostensibly', 'free', 'choose', 'profession', 'actually', 'quite', 'subject', 'whims', 'mother', 'vicious', 'social-climbing', 'sister.The', 'most', 'surprising', 'rewarding', 'bits', 'casting', 'lie', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'world', 'weariness', 'deep', 'sadness', 'are', 'visible', 'line', 'Rickman', 'face', 'seen', 'what', 'society', 'can', 'do', 'young', 'woman', 'determined', 'follow', 'passions', 'Marianne', 'left', 'deep', 'impression', 'Elinor', 'good', 'grasp', 'world', 'Brandon', 'even', 'better', 'one', 'finest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'Elinor', 'not', 'wish', 'sister', 'become', 'acquainted', 'ways', 'world.Emma', 'Thompson', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'cutting', 'out', 'less', 'essential', 'bits', 'lifting', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'directly', 'text', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'direction', 'lovely', 'shots', 'are', 'framed', 'such', 'care', 'Often', 'cast', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'speak', 'simply', 'need', 'observe', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'characters', 'emotions', 'quieter', 'moments']",Sense & Sensibility
164566,A3P3GNT2X93PBV,0800141660,bossa_nova,"[8, 8]","My favourite movie.  So romantic and so funny, often at the very same moment.  I love the contrast between the formal manners - Hugh Grant in his high collar bowing stiffly to the curtseying ladies - and the blazing  passions below the surface.  Emma Thompson's script brings Jane Austen to  life for a modern audience without ever seeming to step out of period - a  difficult thing to do, witness most other period dramas on film.Ang  Lee's direction draws the best out of a wonderful cast, and the screen is  filled with glorious visual images.  The silent and motionless shot of the  formal garden in early morning sunshine, seen through the window after a  night of crisis, has an exquisite beauty that seems almost Chinese...  And  in the scene where Elinor is left to drink a cup of tea on the stairs with  the rest of the family sobbing in their rooms, the way that the camera  pulls back and looks down on the gleaming disk of the tea's surface is the  work of a master.  Then the images of the men on horseback with cloaks  swirling - Willoughby's first appearance, and the scene where Colonel  Brandon gallops away between the trees... so romantic!The relationship  between the two sisters is very moving, and beautifully played, as in the  scene on the hillside - 'There I fell, and there I first saw Willoughby...'  OK, so Emma Thompson is about 20 years too old for Elinor, but where are  you going to get a teenage actress who could give such a great performance?  And Kate Winslet is perfect and enchanting as Marianne.

I don't think it's for the casual viewer.Probably my biggest beef with this version is the editing:  I found it painfully hectic.  Cuts were quick, scenes were not permitted to linger, nuances were left undeveloped, and everything was in general lopped off to make way for the next thing.Large sections of the production therefore have almost the feel of an MTV video, with many shots lasting about a second or less, leaving the viewer to wonder what is the wisdom of frogmarching us along so.The answer is simple:  the filmmakers, intending this for wide release, knew they had a convoluted story to tell but had to bring it in in about 2 hours.Since the mood and tempo of Austen's novel is completely at variance with what you see here (although consonant in other ways), I have no choice but to consider Lee's near-frenetic pace as an unfortunate and damaging decision.7 Academy Award nominations, though?

You will feel you are in Regency England, the sets, costumes, and landscape -- every detail of the production is gorgeous. The score is also wonderful, and Ang Lee's direction is, well, I'm running out of superlatives. Let's just say every scene is beautiful, and the direction, scoring, script, photography -- all are done beautifully to convey a sense of underlying silence, a quieter more thoughtful time than our own, with a gentler pace.The casting is brilliant. Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne Dashwood, and gives a marvelous performance. As does Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, and all the rest of the cast.My only complaints are that Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant were miscast, and their acting was many notches below that of the rest of the cast.Thompson, 36 at the time of this release, is far too old for the part of Elinor, 19. She is not believable as someone of marriagable age in that era. And Hugh Grant is miserably miscast as Edward. His youthfulness further accentuates Thompson's age.They are not believable in the roles, and their performances are also not up to snuff. When they're on screen, I'm aware of acting and actors, not the characters and story. It's a glaring error, enough to be jarring each time I watch the film. This is a shame, because Thompson's amazing script, the casting, production, directing, and the rest of the cast make this film is a work of art in all other respects.Even so, this film is a favorite and a wonderful treat each time I see it.

Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels (my two big favorites are Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion, in that order) and I cannot believe I hadn't felt compelled to watch this film.  Thank goodness for my new obsession for period pieces and film adaptations, for I might have never feasted my eyes upon such a lovely piece of work.  Emma Thompson wrote the adaptation and she did a fine job in bringing Austen's romanticism, humor and social commentary to life.  Everyone who has read the book knows this centers on the two elder Dashwood sisters -- Elinor and Marianne -- and their loss of money and good connections when their father dies and their estates are passed on to the male heir, a son from a previous marriage.  He promised his father to provide for his sisters, but is manipulated into not doing so by his conniving wife (played by Harriet Walter).  Penniless and without dowries, the girls' chances of making a good marriage become nil.  However, they are not lacking in suitors.  Elinor (Emma Thompson), the elder sister and sensible one, falls for the dashing Mr. Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant).  Even though the affections are reciprocated, Edward is otherwise obliged to another.  Marianne (Kate Winslet) is the silly, romantic type -- always reading poems and sonnets and romanticizing a dashing hero that would sweep her off her feet.  In comes the charming Mr. John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who is the embodiment of everything Marianne desires...or is he?  Then there is Col. Christopher Brandon (Alan Rickman), a kind gentleman who would do anything for Marianne.  Will the Dashwood sisters find love in spite of their less than acceptable conditions?This film is a marvel.  The quality of the production is top notch.  The wardrobe brings the Georgian/Regency period to life and the scenery is gorgeous.  Every aspect of this film is awesome.  Hollywood has created some rather superficial film adaptations, but this is one of the exceptions.  Bravo for Emma Thompson for her excellent work in both writing the script and for her wonderful acting.  I agree with the reviewers who thought Thompson was too old to play a nineteen-year-old, but few actresses, regardless of age, would've portrayed Elinor with as much depth and range.  The acting in general is commendable.  I had my doubts about Hugh Grant playing Mr. Ferrars, but he handles the portrayal rather well.  The handsome Greg Wise (whom I'd seen in BBC's The Buccaneers) plays the deceivingly charming Mr. Willoughby flawlessly.  Mr. Willoughby has always reminded me of Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Wickham, but Wise was able to give the character his own voice.  Kate Winslet is my favorite in this movie as Marianne.  She portrays Marianne's youth, innocence and, at times, tactlessness with aplomb.  Alan Rickman, Gemma Jones (Mrs. Dashwood) and Imogen Stubbs (Miss Lucy Steele) are also great.  I cannot say enough good things about this film except that it is a must-have for your DVD collection, especially if you're a Jane Austen fan and lover of film adaptations and period pieces like I am.  I've heard that the BBC is making a version of Sense and Sensibility and I cannot wait to see that one as well!",5,Gorgeous adaptation!,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,3269,"['admit', 'had', ""n't"", 'given', 'film', 'whirl', 'now', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'one', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'two', 'big', 'favorites', 'are', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Persuasion', 'order', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', 'compelled', 'watch', 'film', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'new', 'obsession', 'period', 'pieces', 'film', 'adaptations', 'might', 'have', 'never', 'feasted', 'eyes', 'lovely', 'piece', 'work', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'wrote', 'adaptation', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'Austen', 'romanticism', 'humor', 'social', 'commentary', 'life', 'Everyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'centers', 'two', 'elder', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'loss', 'money', 'good', 'connections', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'estates', 'are', 'passed', 'male', 'heir', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'promised', 'father', 'provide', 'sisters', 'manipulated', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'conniving', 'wife', 'played', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'Penniless', 'dowries', 'girls', 'chances', 'making', 'good', 'marriage', 'become', 'nil', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'lacking', 'suitors', 'Elinor', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'elder', 'sister', 'sensible', 'one', 'dashing', 'Mr.', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Even', 'affections', 'are', 'reciprocated', 'Edward', 'otherwise', 'obliged', 'Marianne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'silly', 'romantic', 'type', 'always', 'reading', 'poems', 'sonnets', 'romanticizing', 'dashing', 'hero', 'would', 'sweep', 'feet', 'charming', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Willoughby', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'who', 'embodiment', 'everything', 'Marianne', 'Then', 'Col.', 'Christopher', 'Brandon', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'kind', 'gentleman', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'Marianne', 'Will', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'find', 'love', 'spite', 'less', 'acceptable', 'conditions', 'film', 'marvel', 'quality', 'production', 'top', 'notch', 'wardrobe', 'Georgian/Regency', 'period', 'life', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'aspect', 'film', 'awesome', 'Hollywood', 'created', 'rather', 'superficial', 'film', 'adaptations', 'one', 'exceptions', 'Bravo', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'excellent', 'work', 'writing', 'script', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'thought', 'Thompson', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'nineteen-year-old', 'few', 'actresses', 'regardless', 'age', 'would', ""'ve"", 'portrayed', 'Elinor', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'range', 'acting', 'general', 'commendable', 'had', 'doubts', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Ferrars', 'portrayal', 'rather', 'well', 'handsome', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'whom', ""'d"", 'seen', 'BBC', 'Buccaneers', 'deceivingly', 'charming', 'Mr.', 'Willoughby', 'flawlessly', 'Mr.', 'Willoughby', 'always', 'reminded', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Mr.', 'Wickham', 'Wise', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'character', 'own', 'voice', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Marianne', 'Marianne', 'youth', 'innocence', 'times', 'tactlessness', 'aplomb', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'Imogen', 'Stubbs', 'Miss', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'must-have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'lover', 'film', 'adaptations', 'period', 'pieces', 'am', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'BBC', 'making', 'version', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'one', 'as', 'well']",Sense & Sensibility

I tend to credit Emma Thompson and Ang Lee, the screenwriter and director, respectively, for making a ""classic"" book into a period piece with a modern feel.Thompson gives another restrained performance on the same level as her work in The Remains of the Day and Howard's End. (Is she being typecast, or is she just the only one who can do these roles?) But right on her tail are Kate Winslet, just coming into her own at this stage but giving her character the full treatment (somehow she does despair just perfectly), and Alan Rickman, giving an unusually restrained performance as the Colonel who loves Kate's character while she instead loves Greg Wise's.Emma, instead gets to have lovely confusion with Hugh Grant.

I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it.It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place. The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection.

164597,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0800141660,Craig MACKINNON,"[12, 14]","This is the story of three sisters (two of marriageable age) and their mother who find themselves suffering a reversal of fortune.  At the death of their father, their half-brother and his wife turn them out (in the most polite way, of course!) to make their own way on a paltry saving.  The sisters proceed to fall in love and the story is of the trials and tribulations of those relationships, set in late 18th century England.Sense and Sensibility is normally regarded as one of Austin's weaker efforts, but it's still highly entertaining.  This film is entirely faithful to the original story, yet rearranged and adapted in a fresh and fun way.  Emma Thompson does double-duty as the screenwriter and as the main character, Elinor (the sister with &quot;sense&quot;).  The cast is impeccably chosen, from Kate Winslet as the &quot;sensibility&quot; sister Marianne (no one does spoiled impetuousity better) and Hugh Grant as Elinor's suitor (no one does shy romantic better) to the lesser known actors.  Those who only know Alan Rickman as hammy bad-guys in Die Hard and Robin Hood will be pleasantly surprised by his range of talents.Ang Lee lends a sure hand in direction, similar to his work in Eat Drink Man Woman.  The movie looks good.  Thompson's screenplay is entirely faithful to the book in spirit, while introducing a great many changes.  Elinor, as played by Thompson, is obviously not 19 years old, Hugh Grant is not &quot;plain,&quot; and several characters are dropped completely, such as Lucy Steele's sister.  In addition, the dialogue is heavily rearranged and edited, scenes are added that don't appear in the book, etc.  In spite of this, the film is probably the truest adaptation I have ever seen in a 2-hour studio film.  The new scenes and additional dialogue are generally adapted from Austin's editorial comments, and so are &quot;true&quot; to the original story, even if they aren't explicitly in the novel as filmed.The DVD has a few extras, including an audio commentary and deleted scenes.  Oddly, there are only two deleted scenes included, although many more are mentioned in the commentary as being filmed and then being cut.  I, for one, would like to see the duel between Col. Brandon and Willoughby, but alas, it is not included.  Thus, the DVD is pretty humdrum, except for the fact that it looks very good.

I dismissed this film as one of those movies I'll never like, but then last year I was delighted when watching `Pride and Prejudice' and it hit me...I'm not ten anymore and I just might like these kinds of movies now.  So, I decided to give `Sense and Sensibility' a try and I was quickly set at ease for I became completely absorbed in this film.The film focuses on the Dashwood family, more notably the two eldest sisters Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  We see their struggles to find true love and keep it and we're endeared towards them as their attempts at happiness are met with the harshest of resentment and persecution.  That's not to say that this isn't a happy and warm film, it's just sad to see what they must fight against, most notably their evil sister-in-law Fanny (Harriet Walter).  As Elinor struggles to provide for her family emotionally she shelters her own emotions and refuses to confide in anyone whereas Marianne is open in her emotions, very charismatic and almost selfish in her manner.To me the acting is what really drives this movie home.  Both the leading women are great, but it's Kate who lifts this movie (and pretty much every movie she does) and causes it to soar above the rest.  Her Marianne is not only convincing but memorable.  In my humble opinion she deserved the Oscar.  Alan Rickman is also very good here as the gentleman Colonel Brandon who wants only the best for Marianne, and Greg Wise is every bit charming as he is despicable as Willoughby.  Now I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, at least not a huge fan.  I much prefer his selfish play boy types like in `Two-Weeks Notice' and `About a Boy', so here I felt he was a bit miscast.

164600,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0800141660,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","I haven't read any Jane Austen, for which I fervently apologize, but the early nineteenth century is well captured in the scenes in both countryside and London, as well as the costumes.The Dashwood family, the mother and three daughters Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, has fallen on hard times due to their residence at Norland being given to eldest son John and his wife Fanny following the death of Mr Dashwood.  Consequently, they are reduced to being visitors.Edward Farris (Hugh Grant) is very soft-spoken and kind of wooden, yet he is more sensitive to the Dashwood's plight than his sister Fanny.  He is talented at being tactful and clever, given the way he draws out the youngest sister Margaret, ever hiding in her treehouse and under furniture.  He is described as being loyal to a commitment, refusing to go back on one's words.  Honourable traits indeed for a gentleman.  He wants to be in a parish in the quiet countryside, hating London and its lack of peace, but his families has high expectations for him.The eldest sister Elinor (Emma Thompson) is quite taken by Edward but she has suppressed any feelings by seeing things sensibly, perhaps to the point of being denied happiness.  After all, any future between them is hampered by their social standing.  The Dashwoods have fallen down in status, and Edward would stand to be disinherited if he married beneath his station.Marianne (Kate Winslet) though does not find Edward too passionate.  There's something wanting in him, ""too sedate"", as she tells Elinor.  ""To love is to burn, to be on fire, like Juliet, or Guinevere, or Heloise.""  A tried and true romantic, and thus the one I connect to the most.  She would definitely take issue with Fanny saying ""Love is all very well, but unfortunately, we can't all rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable direction.""  She falls for Willoughby, a gentleman of ostensiblu good standing, and despite the short time between them, believes that ""time alone does not determine intimacy.""  She also wishes Elinor would be less restrained.  ""Always resignation and acceptance.  Always prudence and honor and duty.  Where is your heart?""The youngest Margaret, is twelve, and is in a world of her own, reading atlases, living in a tree house, and imagining many scenarios, including herself being a captain of an expedition.  I was like that when I was young, and I was simply enchanted.Their move to Barton Cottage, on the estate of Mother Dashwood's cousin Sir John (Robert Hardy of All Creatures Great And Small) and his mother-in-law Ms. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) proves to be a curse and a blessing, the former because of the impossibility of keeping secrets, especially with a cheery Ms. Jennings.The social class strictures, such as marrying within one's own class, money and breeding being the important factors, the concept of primogeniture may seem dated today, but the hopes of escaping those strictures, or any strictures imposed in any time makes this movie and the novel relevant today.All the performers are wonderful here.  However, it's interesting to see Hugh Laurie (Jeeves and Wooster, Blackadder), usually so full of goofy wackiness playing it so tempered and buttoned down as Palmer, and he does it well.  It's a joy to see Kate Winslet as the romantic Marianne, before she plunged into fame in Titanic.  Alan Rickman does wonders as the ever-brooding but understanding Colonel Brandon, whose face belies a pained past.  He even tells Elinor that maybe it's better for Marianne not to learn the ways of the world, that it's better for her not to hide her emotions, and is well aware of the ""impolitic cruelty in dividing two young people long attached to one another.""Despite Marianne's travails, I say it's better to use one's heart and not one's head for one's destiny.  After all, ""can the soul really be satisfied with such polite affections?""

164602,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0800141660,Darren,"[3, 3]","This one demonstrates how the screenplay is everything.  When we first see the Dashwood girls, the younger one is playing a dirge on a piano (their father has just died, and they're being kicked out of their house by their half-brother).  The older one peeps her head in the room and begs the younger one to play something else, because ""Mama has been weeping since breakfast.""  As the older one leaves the room, the younger one then starts up with an even more portentous dirge than before.  ""I meant something more cheerful, dearest,"" the older one calls out off-camera.  Right away, we like these girls -- done, in less than 30 seconds.  More impressively than that, this brief intro establishes to no small degree the characters of each young woman.  The screenwriter has reduced the contents of her saucepan down to its perfect essentials.Emma Thompson deservedly won the Oscar for Best Screenplay for this movie, which carries on with equally commendable economy as the scene I described above.  Her screenplay remains famous to this day, often cited as a rare case of a screenplay actually deserving of an award, and as an example of how to do the job of adapting a literary classic right.  It only remained for a sensitive director like Ang Lee to frame the words in exquisite images, avoiding extraneous flash while he was at it, and for great actors to invest the characters with beating hearts and quick wits.  Smoothies like Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, and Greg Wise know what they're about and provide compelling love interests for Thompson and Winslet.  In fact, the movie is embarrassingly rich with supporting actors who bring small parts to life, people like Gemma Jones, Hugh Laurie, Robert Hardy, and so many more.  However, the standout among all this talent is Kate Winslet.  Though she'd been in a couple of notable films already, this movie introduced the precociously talented 19-year-old (!) to American audiences and she has never looked back since.  Here, she's achingly beautiful and down-to-earth all at once, offering a controlled performance that is shockingly good, considering that she was just a teenager.  She dominates every scene she is in -- so small feat when you're standing in the same room with seasoned pros like Emma Thompson who had almost 20 years on her.And let's talk about that, since Thompson's age here is often cited as the only thing wrong with the movie.  I disagree.  In fact, I think Austen missed a trick by having the sisters close in age in the novel.  (Both teenagers, 16 and 19, if I remember rightly.)  I think the movie intends for us to assume that there's about a 10-year difference between the sisters' ages.  What this does is highlight the acuteness of the ""marriageability"" problem for both of them:  Thompson is already ensconced in frustrated spinsterhood when she meets Grant, and she's explicitly held up by the other characters as a tragic example for Winslet if she herself does not marry, and soon.  It's not unreasonable to assume that, beholding her sister's loneliness, Winslet develops an overly dramatic ""sense"" of romantic ""sensibility"", which will cause her much grief in the story.  As for Thompson, you can almost smell the despair.  It turns into frightened panic when her sister's life is in danger:  with no husband, the prospect of a life without her temperamentally opposite but closest confidante opens up a yawning abyss (Thompson's enactment of this cuts to the bone).  Being ""too old"" adds dramatic urgency to the movie.  If you disagree with me, consider that Austen wasn't the only literary lion to miss a trick or two:  remember Juliet waking up AFTER Romeo is stiff with poison?Anyway, this classic is a must-see.  5 out of 5.",5,Not one false note,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,3722,"['one', 'how', 'screenplay', 'everything', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'younger', 'one', 'playing', 'dirge', 'piano', 'father', 'just', 'died', ""'re"", 'being', 'kicked', 'house', 'half-brother', 'older', 'one', 'head', 'room', 'begs', 'younger', 'one', 'play', 'something', 'else', 'Mama', 'been', 'weeping', 'breakfast', 'older', 'one', 'room', 'younger', 'one', 'then', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'portentous', 'dirge', 'before', 'meant', 'something', 'more', 'cheerful', 'dearest', 'older', 'one', 'off-camera', 'Right', 'away', 'like', 'girls', 'done', 'less', '30', 'seconds', 'More', 'impressively', 'brief', 'intro', 'establishes', 'small', 'characters', 'young', 'woman', 'screenwriter', 'reduced', 'contents', 'saucepan', 'down', 'perfect', 'essentials.Emma', 'Thompson', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'movie', 'equally', 'commendable', 'economy', 'scene', 'described', 'above', 'screenplay', 'famous', 'day', 'often', 'cited', 'rare', 'case', 'screenplay', 'actually', 'deserving', 'award', 'example', 'how', 'do', 'job', 'adapting', 'literary', 'classic', 'right', 'only', 'remained', 'sensitive', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'frame', 'words', 'exquisite', 'images', 'avoiding', 'extraneous', 'flash', 'was', 'great', 'actors', 'invest', 'characters', 'beating', 'hearts', 'quick', 'wits', 'Smoothies', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'provide', 'compelling', 'love', 'interests', 'Thompson', 'Winslet', 'fact', 'movie', 'embarrassingly', 'rich', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'small', 'parts', 'life', 'people', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'However', 'standout', 'talent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', ""'d"", 'been', 'couple', 'notable', 'films', 'already', 'movie', 'introduced', 'precociously', 'talented', '19-year-old', 'American', 'audiences', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'Here', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'down-to-earth', 'once', 'offering', 'controlled', 'performance', 'shockingly', 'good', 'considering', 'was', 'just', 'teenager', 'scene', 'so', 'small', 'feat', 'when', ""'re"", 'standing', 'same', 'room', 'seasoned', 'pros', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'had', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'her.And', 'let', 'talk', 'Thompson', 'age', 'here', 'often', 'cited', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'disagree', 'fact', 'think', 'Austen', 'missed', 'trick', 'having', 'sisters', 'close', 'age', 'novel', 'teenagers', '16', '19', 'remember', 'rightly', 'think', 'movie', 'assume', '10-year', 'difference', 'sisters', 'ages', 'What', 'highlight', 'acuteness', 'marriageability', 'problem', 'Thompson', 'already', 'ensconced', 'frustrated', 'spinsterhood', 'when', 'Grant', 'explicitly', 'held', 'up', 'other', 'characters', 'tragic', 'example', 'Winslet', 'herself', 'not', 'marry', 'soon', 'not', 'unreasonable', 'assume', 'beholding', 'sister', 'loneliness', 'Winslet', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'romantic', 'sensibility', 'will', 'cause', 'much', 'grief', 'story', 'Thompson', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'despair', 'frightened', 'panic', 'when', 'sister', 'life', 'danger', 'husband', 'prospect', 'life', 'temperamentally', 'opposite', 'closest', 'confidante', 'up', 'yawning', 'abyss', 'Thompson', 'enactment', 'cuts', 'bone', 'Being', 'too', 'old', 'dramatic', 'urgency', 'movie', 'disagree', 'consider', 'Austen', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'literary', 'lion', 'miss', 'trick', 'two', 'remember', 'Juliet', 'waking', 'up', 'AFTER', 'Romeo', 'stiff', 'poison', 'Anyway', 'classic', 'must-see', '5', '5']",Sense & Sensibility

This story about the complexities of love, society, and family won my heart in the first few minutes with its excellent acting, smart dialogue, and lush period setting.The movie focuses primarily on the two oldest sisters of the Dashwood family - Elinor (Emma Thompson) and her younger sister Marianne (Kate Winslet.)  Elinor is practical and independent-minded, caught between her societal position as a woman and what she wants for herself.  In contrast, Marianne is impetuous, artistic, passionate; she pursues her emotions as though nothing else matters.  When both sisters fall in love with different men, they react very differently to the awakening of their affections.The acting in this film could not have been any better.  Although critics have complained that Emma Thompson is too old for the part of Elinor, she at once dispels all doubts with her expert performance.  She becomes Elinor so thoroughly that it's difficult to imagine another actress tackling this role.  As the romantic Marianne, Kate Winslet is charmingly breathless; she captures the essence of her character with seemingly no effort. Hugh Grant is awkwardly sincere as Edward, and the normally sinister Alan Rickman portrays with heartbreaking honesty the love-struck Colonel. To bring all this talent together, Ang Lee provides nuanced direction that captures both the beauty and the humanity of Austen's novel.On the surface, this is a quiet movie, but underneath the turmoil of life - whether in Austen's time or ours - simmers.

It's hilarious.Onto the movie itself.Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson do a fantastic job of selling Elinor and Marianne.  It's a bit hard visually since Thompson looks so much older than Winslet, but they do the sisterly rather than the mother-daughter thing, so it works.  Winslet's hurt look when Willoughby won't shake her hand was the defining scene for me; with Elinor, it was the scene where she quietly drinks tea while the rest of the house is in an uproar over Willoughby's defection.What else I liked.  Greg Wise and Alan Rickman as Willoughby and Brandon, respectively, are good as well.  Imelda Staunton as the cheery Charlotte Palmer and Hugh Laurie as her sarcastic husband are fun.  Laurie's few scenes are excellent - he comes across as sarcastic and displeased, but his genuine offer of help to Elinor when Marianne is sick is well done.  (But hey, it's Hugh Laurie.)I liked how they use Margaret Dashwood to enhance Edward and Brandon; I enjoyed the non-Austen map scene as well as Brandon's teasing Margaret over her curious questions about the Indies.Imogen Stubbs as Miss Lucy Steele was fantastic.  I'd seen this movie very early, before I read the book, and for awhile in the movie I couldn't figure out if she was supposed to be a good guy or a bad one.  Stubbs' sweet, earnest expression plays so well into Lucy's underhandness.The other side characters were all right but not memorable.What sucked: Edward Ferrars.  He didn't even show up and sent Hugh Grant in his place.  This was the worst Edward Ferrars I've ever seen; instead of Austen's Ferrars, this guy is basically a Regency version of every other character Hugh Grant's ever played.  He's kind of an inarticulate, kind of stammering, nervous, shy, bumbling but genuinely nice guy.  This is not Austen's Edward Ferrars.  I'll admit I missed it the first time I saw it - I had not yet read the novel - but upon second viewing it was pretty clear the disparity between Austen's and Thompson's versions.  It's a puzzlement as to why he's written this way; of course Thompson knows Austen better than this, and Grant has got more range than that usual bumbling thing.A definite watch, though with a caveat emptor.",4,"Excellent, except for the absence of Edward Ferrars",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,2365,"['excellent', 'version', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'DVD', 'extra', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'much', 'watch', 'movie', 'itself.Kate', 'Winslet', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'selling', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'bit', 'hard', 'visually', 'Thompson', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'Winslet', 'do', 'sisterly', 'rather', 'mother-daughter', 'thing', 'Winslet', 'hurt', 'look', 'when', 'Willoughby', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shake', 'hand', 'was', 'defining', 'scene', 'Elinor', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'quietly', 'tea', 'rest', 'house', 'uproar', 'Willoughby', 'defection.What', 'else', 'liked', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Willoughby', 'Brandon', 'respectively', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'cheery', 'Charlotte', 'Palmer', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'sarcastic', 'husband', 'are', 'fun', 'Laurie', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'sarcastic', 'displeased', 'genuine', 'offer', 'help', 'Elinor', 'when', 'Marianne', 'sick', 'well', 'done', 'hey', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'liked', 'how', 'use', 'Margaret', 'Dashwood', 'enhance', 'Edward', 'Brandon', 'enjoyed', 'non-Austen', 'map', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'Brandon', 'teasing', 'Margaret', 'curious', 'questions', 'Indies.Imogen', 'Stubbs', 'Miss', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'was', 'fantastic', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'very', 'early', 'read', 'book', 'awhile', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'one', 'Stubbs', 'sweet', 'earnest', 'expression', 'plays', 'so', 'well', 'Lucy', 'underhandness.The', 'other', 'side', 'characters', 'were', 'all', 'right', 'not', 'memorable.What', 'sucked', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'sent', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'place', 'was', 'worst', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'instead', 'Austen', 'Ferrars', 'guy', 'basically', 'Regency', 'version', 'other', 'character', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'ever', 'played', 'kind', 'inarticulate', 'kind', 'stammering', 'nervous', 'shy', 'bumbling', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'not', 'Austen', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'disparity', 'Austen', 'Thompson', 'versions', 'puzzlement', 'why', 'written', 'way', 'course', 'Thompson', 'Austen', 'better', 'Grant', 'got', 'more', 'range', 'usual', 'bumbling', 'thing.A', 'definite', 'watch', 'caveat', 'emptor']",Sense & Sensibility

I'm not sure why, but my guess is that Sense and  Sensibility lacked something in the minds of the members of the Academy,  call it...dirt.Everything is a little too pretty, a little too clean and  well behaved in this charming adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel.  Director Ang Lee might have provided some insight into early 19th century  England by showing the poverty and squalor of the London streets instead of  just having the girls step around a little horse manure.  Lee might also  have shown that the servants had it worse than the gentry by expanding the  scene where they are let go by showing just where some of them did go.  Lee's direction hints at a wider world of poverty and real pain, but  rejects having it intrude.  Although the full force of the industrial  revolution and attendant horrors were yet to come, they might have been  presaged so that Austen's world is given perspective for the modern  audience.  Soon the skies of England would be blackened with smoke from  coal and most of its citizens turned into proletarian cogs.But Austen  knew and/or cared about that not at all, and instead wrote with singular  attention about the gentry and their acquisitive aspirations and genteel  manners, and this is the novel that Emma Thompson captured so well in her  Academy Award winning screenplay.  The fact that the Dashwoods lost their  estate and had to live in a cottage and practice thrift within a budget was  a very real tragedy to Austen, although not to us.  She was obsessed with  the injustice of being a young woman without means living within a society  that allowed upward mobility by women only through marriage.  So she showed  women playing that game to perfection, and winning.Emma Thompson as the  sensible Elinor Dashwood was flawless, as usual; and Kate Winslet as her  sister, the sensual Marianne who wears her heart on her sleeve, proved once  again that she is a gifted and charismatic actress second to none.  The  supporting cast, especially Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, and Harriet  Walter as Fanny Dashwood, was superb.  The cinematography was gorgeous,  even arresting at times.Most uncomfortable scene: Marianne being bled.

There are so many different characters entering and exiting the story that there is never any threat of boredom for lack of interesting people.  The story itself is actually fairly simple, but it is the people who inhabit this fascinating time and place who both complicate and enhance everything around them.

Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. Another commonality seems to be a randomness of billings, in this one Grant was given a top billing and a picture on the DVD cover, but was very much a secondary character.

164624,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,0800141660,Dumb Ox,"[23, 25]","Jane Austen is a fine writer, but her wordiness tends to drain the life from many of her characters.  Thankfully, Emma Thompson recognized the limitations of the novel and adapted her screenplay accordingly, enhancing the humor of the original story and heightening drama to make the film more captivating.  A cast was then chosen, made up of very talented thespians, including Miss Thompson herself.  Add to that splendid English landscapes, excellent directing, haunting music, and superb cinematography, and what emerges is a modern masterpiece.This is no movie for action fans; it is far too cerebral and requires a serious attention span.  For those who enjoy a good love story well told, this film delivers.  The characters are three-dimensional and their dilemmas full of human drama, bound as they are by the morals and manners of the times.  Three sisters and their mother are left virtually penniless by the stricture against females inheriting property then in place in English law.  The half-brother to the Dashwood women receives it all, but his selfish wife talks him out of helping his stepmother and half-sisters.  It is up to the two older girls---sensible Elinor and passionate Marianne---to seek their fortunes in romance while lacking a dowry to help them.Elinor finds her soulmate in shy, retiring Edward Ferrars, brother of the selfish sister-in-law, a man lacking in the usual Victorian ambitions.  Her budding romance is shelved when his sister makes it clear that Elinor is ""unsuitable"" for Edward.  The sisters and their mother then go to stay in a cottage owned by a kindly relative, Sir John, and his mother-in-law, the irrepressible Mrs. Jennings.  The old woman is a confirmed gossip and matchmaker, bound to see one of the two sisters hitched up to Colonel Brandon, the most eligible bachelor in the area.Brandon first sees Marianne singing a melancholy song and is incurably smitten.  She in turn loses her heart to a dashing young man named Willoughby, who is her ideal of a Victorian-era gentleman, complete with a pocket book of sonnets.  Brandon, who loves her more than his own happiness, steps aside and even encourages their relationship, despite his dislike for the handsome rogue.Things take an unexpected turn for the worse for both sisters---Willoughby abruptly drops Marianne and flees to London with no explanation and Elinor discovers that Edward is engaged to a shallow young woman named Lucy Steele.  The ensuing twists and turns in the plot make this film both agonizing and entertaining to watch.  Mercifully, everyone winds up happy at the end wedded to the right person.The whole film is solidly done, but it is the acting that really shines.  Thompson is perfect for the role of the calmer sister, while Winslett is brilliant as the mercurial Marianne.  Grant is endearing as the gentle Edward; Rickman finally gets to display his considerable ability to act the part of a very good and unselfish man.  The rest of the cast keeps pace with the leads, and Hugh Laurie is indescribably funny as the sarcastic Mr. Palmer.  One very beautiful aspect of this movie, along with the tendency to get drawn into the story, is the evocative musical score that tugs at the heartstrings.All in all, this is a wonderful example of a film genre that is so often overlooked in today's world---period romance.  More movies like this one desperately need to be produced.

164625,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0800141660,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.When those daughters are from Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. Ang Lee deftly adapted Ausen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" into the sort of movie it should be -- a lushly beautiful, quietly passionate period drama.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow  (Gemma Jones) and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor (Emma Thompson) begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward (Hugh Grant)... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne (Kate Winslet) soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby (Greg Wise).But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...I have to give Emma Thompson credit -- she not only turns in a brilliant, tightly-wound performance as Elinor (although she does look a bit old for the role), but she also wrote the faithful, solidly written script for Ang Lee's movie. The narrative glides silkily through the story, and adapts Austen's writing into elegantly vivid dialogue (""Can he love her? Can the soul really be satisfied with such... POLITE affections?"") with some moments of gentle humor (""How did you find the silver? Was it all genuine?"").And Ang Lee takes what Thompson has wrought and makes it even lovelier, filling it with pale light, misty country hills, luxurious manorhouses, sunlit gardens and yards, and rain-swept fields where handsome men go riding on horseback. He has the knack for coaxing intense emotions from small gestures and words, and evoking budding love that is unsaid and unexpressed until the end (especially for Edward and Elinor). The absolute peak of his skill is right before Marianne's terrible illness, when she's left standing on a hilltop in the rain, whispering a Shakespearean sonnet.Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. Thompson plays Elinor as being tightly wound and a bit repressed, while Winslet races joyously through the dramatic and romantic parts of the story, only for Marianne to crash and burn when Willoughby betrays her.And the supporting cast is no less brilliant -- Jones and Rickman are particularly good as the girls' loving mother, and the mellow, quiet Colonel Brandon (the man ""everyone thinks well of, and nobody remembers to talk to"") who stands by hoping for Marianne's happiness. Wise, Robert Hardy, Elizabeth Spriggs and Harriet Walters all give excellent performances, and even Hugh Grant (who usually annoys me like an unreachable itch) did a good job as the shy, studious Edward.""Sense and Sensibility"" is an emotionally powerful tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. And it was beautifully done by both of the people at its core -- Thompson's writing and acting, and Ang Lee's direction.",5,Is love a fancy or a feeling?,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,3849,"['One', 'Dashwood', 'daughters', 'smart', 'down-to-earth', 'sensible', 'other', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'sensitive.When', 'daughters', 'are', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'can', 'guess', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'romantic', 'problems', 'aplenty', 'usual', 'entailment', 'issues', 'love', 'triangles', 'sexy', 'bad', 'boys', 'societal', 'scandals', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'deftly', 'adapted', 'Ausen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'sort', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'lushly', 'beautiful', 'quietly', 'passionate', 'period', 'Mr.', 'Dashwood', 'entire', 'estate', 'entailed', 'weak', 'son', 'John', 'snotty', 'daughter-in-law', 'Fanny', 'widow', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'left', 'little', 'money', 'home.Over', 'next', 'few', 'weeks', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Elinor', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'fall', 'Fanny', 'studious', 'quiet', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'being', 'down-to-earth', 'one', ""n't"", 'got', 'chance', 'impoverished', 'family', 'soon', 'Devonshire', 'where', 'tiny', 'cottage', 'being', 'rented', 'one', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'relatives', 'Marianne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'soon', 'attention', 'two', 'men', 'One', 'quiet', 'much', 'older', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'other', 'dashing', 'romantic', 'Willoughby', 'Greg', 'Wise', '.But', 'things', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'Willoughby', 'propose', 'Marianne', 'only', 'abruptly', 'break', 'off', 'relationship', 'trip', 'London', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'discover', 'devastating', 'facts', 'men', 'are', 'love', 'are', 'engaged', 'other', 'women', 'disaster', 'Dashwood', 'family', 'sisters', 'will', 'discover', 'what', 'real', 'love', 'have', 'give', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'credit', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'tightly-wound', 'performance', 'Elinor', 'look', 'bit', 'old', 'role', 'also', 'wrote', 'faithful', 'solidly', 'written', 'script', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'movie', 'narrative', 'glides', 'silkily', 'story', 'adapts', 'Austen', 'writing', 'elegantly', 'vivid', 'dialogue', 'Can', 'love', 'Can', 'soul', 'really', 'be', 'satisfied', 'such', 'POLITE', 'affections', 'moments', 'gentle', 'humor', 'How', 'did', 'find', 'silver', 'Was', 'genuine', '.And', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'what', 'Thompson', 'wrought', 'even', 'lovelier', 'filling', 'pale', 'light', 'misty', 'country', 'hills', 'luxurious', 'manorhouses', 'sunlit', 'gardens', 'yards', 'rain-swept', 'fields', 'where', 'handsome', 'men', 'go', 'riding', 'horseback', 'knack', 'coaxing', 'intense', 'emotions', 'small', 'gestures', 'words', 'evoking', 'budding', 'love', 'unsaid', 'unexpressed', 'end', 'especially', 'Edward', 'Elinor', 'absolute', 'peak', 'skill', 'right', 'Marianne', 'terrible', 'illness', 'when', 'left', 'standing', 'hilltop', 'rain', 'whispering', 'Shakespearean', 'sonnet.Marianne', 'Elinor', 'make', 'excellent', 'dual', 'heroines', 'book', 'still', 'love', 'cherish', 'other', 'even', 'polar', 'opposite', 'personalities', 'frequently', 'clash', 'Thompson', 'Elinor', 'being', 'tightly', 'wound', 'bit', 'repressed', 'Winslet', 'races', 'joyously', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'parts', 'story', 'only', 'Marianne', 'crash', 'burn', 'when', 'Willoughby', 'her.And', 'supporting', 'cast', 'less', 'brilliant', 'Jones', 'Rickman', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'girls', 'loving', 'mother', 'mellow', 'quiet', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'man', 'everyone', 'well', 'nobody', 'remembers', 'talk', 'who', 'hoping', 'Marianne', 'happiness', 'Wise', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'Elizabeth', 'Spriggs', 'Harriet', 'Walters', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'even', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'usually', 'unreachable', 'itch', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'shy', 'studious', 'Edward', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'tale', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'sisters', 'rocky', 'road', 'finding', 'lasting', 'love', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'people', 'core', 'Thompson', 'writing', 'acting', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'direction']",Sense & Sensibility
164626,A1WJKM99W7HRKY,0800141660,egreetham,"[0, 1]","This, as another review has remarked, is a serviceable translation of Austen's novel to the screen.It has, on the whole, a wonderful cast doing a pretty good job, and great production values. Though Hugh Grant seems uncomfortable as Elinor's beloved,  I do love the other Hugh, Hugh Laurie, who rather touchingly reveals something that the novel only suggests:  Mr. Palmer gradually falls more than half in love with Elinor.  (The contrast between Elinor and Mrs. Palmer is painful.)  Emma Thompson's Elinor may be a little older than we might have imagine her, but she beautifully conveys Elinor's isolation and stress--she is so often the only  person of sense in the room.

164627,ALBDYBQOYJH4O,0800141660,Elizabeth,"[4, 4]","Economically, this is probably the wisest video purchase I ever made, as every couple of months I will pop this film into the VCR. I never seem to  tire of it.Perhaps it's a bit odd that I adore this film so much; at  first glance, it seems far removed from my own life. If I ever consider  abject poverty to be living in a grand stone house in the countryside, then  I am a very lucky woman indeed. Social niceties that make demands on my  behavior are more along the lines of filling up everyone's margarita glass  rather than curtseying upon entering a drawing room.However, the major  themes of the film are timeless indeed. Sometimes, money is still a  deterrent to love and love is still a game. The fact that societal and  familial constraints, not to mention scheming underlings, can keep true  lovers apart is still an atrocity.Moreover, Jane Austen lamented the  limitations placed upon women in her time and wrote passionately of women  coping within these confines. Elinor quietly laments her inability to  choose a profession while Marianne learns that too passionate a temper does  not benefit a lady. Young Margaret is an extreme example of a young girl  not yet jaded by the desperate urge to marry well. She longs for travel,  her prized possession is her atlas, her eyes sparkle when Colonel Brandon  speaks of the East Indies. It is sad to consider that Margaret will have a  hard time pursing her dreams in a world with few female ship captains.A  hint: if any women are having difficulty recommending this film to members  of the male persuasion, tell `em Alan Rickman plays a pivotal role. True,  his lovestruck Colonel Brandon is a far cry from the fantastic villains he  portrayed in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Die Hard, but this amazing  actor is still a huge draw. ;)",5,My favorite film,967593600,"08 30, 2000",2000,1800,"['Economically', 'probably', 'wisest', 'video', 'purchase', 'ever', 'made', 'couple', 'months', 'will', 'pop', 'film', 'VCR', 'never', 'seem', 'tire', 'it.Perhaps', 'bit', 'odd', 'adore', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'glance', 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'life', 'ever', 'consider', 'abject', 'poverty', 'be', 'living', 'grand', 'stone', 'house', 'countryside', 'then', 'am', 'very', 'lucky', 'woman', 'indeed', 'Social', 'niceties', 'make', 'demands', 'behavior', 'are', 'more', 'lines', 'filling', 'up', 'everyone', 'margarita', 'glass', 'rather', 'curtseying', 'entering', 'drawing', 'room.However', 'major', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'timeless', 'indeed', 'Sometimes', 'money', 'still', 'deterrent', 'love', 'love', 'still', 'game', 'fact', 'societal', 'familial', 'constraints', 'not', 'mention', 'scheming', 'underlings', 'can', 'keep', 'true', 'lovers', 'apart', 'still', 'atrocity.Moreover', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'lamented', 'limitations', 'placed', 'women', 'time', 'wrote', 'passionately', 'women', 'coping', 'confines', 'Elinor', 'quietly', 'inability', 'choose', 'profession', 'Marianne', 'too', 'passionate', 'temper', 'not', 'benefit', 'lady', 'Young', 'Margaret', 'extreme', 'example', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'yet', 'jaded', 'desperate', 'urge', 'marry', 'well', 'travel', 'prized', 'possession', 'atlas', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'when', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'speaks', 'East', 'Indies', 'sad', 'consider', 'Margaret', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'pursing', 'dreams', 'world', 'few', 'female', 'ship', 'captains.A', 'hint', 'women', 'are', 'having', 'difficulty', 'recommending', 'film', 'members', 'male', 'persuasion', 'tell', 'em', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'pivotal', 'role', 'True', 'lovestruck', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'far', 'cry', 'fantastic', 'villains', 'portrayed', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'Die', 'Hard', 'amazing', 'actor', 'still', 'huge', 'draw']",Sense & Sensibility

164634,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,0800141660,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[3, 3]","Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and personal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility in 1811, this being her first published novel. This film provides a rare combination of a superb interpretation of the author's novel and a cast that turns it into a masterpiece.In the past, when a wealthy man died, for the most part, the male son would inherit his fortune. In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen brings forth the terrible consequences of this costume, for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, become impoverished after her husband dies. As it was expected, John inherites the estate, Norland.John promises his father that he will take care of his sisters and step-mother, but being married to a rather selfish woman, she stops him from doing he horonable thing. So, the Dashwood women are now seen as strangers in their own home and soon set out to find alternative living quarters.The older Dashwood, Elinor is rather taken by the selfish sister in law's brother, a gentle and intelligent young man, who is to marry a woman of high rank, so given that Elinor has sense, she does not hope to see her love aspirations come to fruition.The Dashwood women move to Barton Cottage, where a distant cousin rents them affordable quarters. Marianne is the romantic sister, who upon spraining her ankle, meets a handsome young man who carries her to safety in the rain, and romance appears to strike. But the young man announces that he must return to London on business and the hopes of Marianne are shattered.As Elinor Dashwood, Emma Thompson is powerful, funny as the Dashwood sister that possesses enough sense to enchant us all. Her sister, played by Kate Winslet, is a romantic who attracts several suitors, while Elinor deals with Hugh Grant, the person who ultimately brings this romance to a sheer delight.The costumes are excellent. The setting of the manicured English countryside allows us to see the environment the author intended for the development of her wonderful characters.",5,Refined sense and sensibility!,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2808,"['Born', 'Steventon', 'Hampshire', '1775', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'daughters', 'Reverent', 'George', 'Austen', 'wife', 'Cassandra', 'was', 'educated', 'Oxford', 'Southampton', 'finally', 'attending', 'boarding', 'school', 'Abbey', 'gatehouse', 'Reading', 'Berkshire', 'environment', 'provided', 'home', 'was', 'conducive', 'writing', 'often', 'enacted', 'plays', 'family', 'something', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'present', 'stories', 'develop', 'characters', 'depth.Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'are', 'imaginative', 'full', 'emotion', 'depicting', 'relationships', 'transcend', 'time', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'society', 'propriety', 'etiquette', 'was', 'highly', 'critical', 'snobbery', 'upper', 'kept', 'away', 'others', 'study', 'human', 'flaws', 'personal', 'relationships', 'provide', 'great', 'material', 'development', 'characters.Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', '1811', 'being', 'first', 'published', 'novel', 'film', 'rare', 'combination', 'superb', 'interpretation', 'author', 'novel', 'cast', 'masterpiece.In', 'past', 'when', 'wealthy', 'man', 'died', 'most', 'part', 'male', 'son', 'would', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'forth', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'costume', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'daughters', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'Margaret', 'become', 'impoverished', 'husband', 'was', 'expected', 'John', 'estate', 'Norland.John', 'father', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'sisters', 'step-mother', 'being', 'married', 'rather', 'selfish', 'woman', 'stops', 'doing', 'horonable', 'thing', 'So', 'Dashwood', 'women', 'are', 'now', 'seen', 'strangers', 'own', 'home', 'soon', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'alternative', 'living', 'quarters.The', 'older', 'Dashwood', 'Elinor', 'rather', 'taken', 'selfish', 'sister', 'law', 'brother', 'gentle', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'marry', 'woman', 'high', 'rank', 'so', 'given', 'Elinor', 'sense', 'not', 'hope', 'see', 'love', 'aspirations', 'come', 'fruition.The', 'Dashwood', 'women', 'move', 'Barton', 'Cottage', 'where', 'distant', 'cousin', 'rents', 'affordable', 'quarters', 'Marianne', 'romantic', 'sister', 'who', 'spraining', 'ankle', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'safety', 'rain', 'romance', 'strike', 'young', 'man', 'must', 'return', 'London', 'business', 'hopes', 'Marianne', 'are', 'shattered.As', 'Elinor', 'Dashwood', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'powerful', 'funny', 'Dashwood', 'sister', 'enough', 'sense', 'enchant', 'sister', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'romantic', 'who', 'several', 'suitors', 'Elinor', 'deals', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'person', 'who', 'ultimately', 'romance', 'sheer', 'delight.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'excellent', 'setting', 'manicured', 'English', 'countryside', 'see', 'environment', 'author', 'intended', 'development', 'wonderful', 'characters']",Sense & Sensibility

Both daughters are forced by their circumstances to be neurotically desparate to find husbands, and their wretchedness is emphasized by the slightly ""too"" old Elinor. Whether the character was that old in the book, I don't care. That detail works perfectly in this screen version.Another interesting fact is that all the men in the movie seem to be victims of the crazy world they've created. The Hugh Grant character tiptoes around like he's about to topple over at any moment. The colonel is in his own kind of daze. The married men are miserable or driven to looniness or mean-spiritedness. The only free spirit is the younger sister's early suitor, but of course he's punished by both his society and his conscience for his behavior.",5,Just a note on Emma's age.,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,869,"['think', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'age', 'was', 'perfect', 'Elinor', 'terms', 'what', 'movie', 'conveying', 'English', 'society', 'time', 'daughters', 'are', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'be', 'neurotically', 'desparate', 'find', 'husbands', 'wretchedness', 'emphasized', 'slightly', 'too', 'old', 'Elinor', 'character', 'was', 'old', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'detail', 'perfectly', 'screen', 'version.Another', 'interesting', 'fact', 'men', 'movie', 'seem', 'be', 'victims', 'crazy', 'world', ""'ve"", 'created', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'character', 'tiptoes', 'topple', 'over', 'moment', 'colonel', 'own', 'kind', 'daze', 'married', 'men', 'are', 'miserable', 'driven', 'looniness', 'mean-spiritedness', 'only', 'free', 'spirit', 'younger', 'sister', 'early', 'suitor', 'course', 'punished', 'society', 'conscience', 'behavior']",Sense & Sensibility

I saw this movie again on March 12 and...ah, what the hell, read on.Emma Thompson (""Dead Again,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"") is the screenwriter and star of this excellent adaptation of one of Jane Austen's most beloved works (the others being ""Mansfield Park,"" ""Emma"" and ""Pride And Prejudice""). Recently divorced from Kenneth Branagh, who cast her in his adaptations of William Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (which he directed, produced, wrote for the screen and starred in; see my review on ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and other Shakespearean adaptations) and ""Dead Again"" (he only directed and starred in that one), Ms. Thompson agreed to tackle this project as ""Jane Austen is my favorite author"" when approached by producer Lindsay Doran on the set of ""Dead Again"" and does an excellent job with the material, such a good job that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay (competing against Randall Wallace for Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" [which won Gibson Best Picture and Best Director]) AND WON!! Well deserved, too. Kate Winslet (pre-""Titanic"" fame and whose next role would be as Ophelia opposite Kenneth Brangah in the latter's uncut, star-studded 4-hour version of ""Hamlet"" [see my review on that one and the 1948 version of ""Hamlet"" starring, produced, text-edited, though he went uncredited, and directed by Sir Laurence Olivier aka The Master Of The Bard and arguably one of the greatest Shakespearean actors who ever lived] as well as prior and watch for upcoming reviews on faithful other versions of William Shakespeare's plays), Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman (fresh off his role as the villainous Sherrif Of Nottingham in Kevin Reynolds' remake [to a certain extent] of the 1938 classic ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" [see my review on it] starring screen legends Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland [whose next project was the equally successful 1939 classic ""Gone With The Wind"", see my review of the VHS], based on the classic novel of the same name by Margaret Mitchell) play the two potential suitors in this wonderful version, Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon, respectively. Greg Wise plays the villainous Willoughby. Imelda Staunton (who two years prior had been cast as Margaret in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and recently won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in the drama ""Vera Drake"") plays Charlotte Palmer. The rest of the cast does a great job in this well-scripted/well-casted film. Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") does a fine job directing this period piece. Ms. Thompson should have also brought ""Pride And Prejudice"" to the screen as well (there's an upcoming version starring Keira Knightley [""Pirates Of The Carribean"" see my review on it; sequel coming soon] set to hit theaters this year at the earliest), but it's all well and good. Special features include deleted scenes, Emma Thompson's Golden Globe speech, theatrical trailers and more.Great cast, terrific screenplay, top-notch acting, beautiful scenery (it was shot in the same locales described so meticulously by Jane Austen in her novel) and good directing make this period piece a movie to treasure for all time.

Mansfield Park), but watching movies based on them is a whole different story.Ang Lee added his delicate touch to this one. The story flows on scene by scene smoothly, and he had a great cast. Emma Thompson is able to show Eleanor to be a strong-willed woman, introverted, but nevertheless sensible. Kate Winslet gave a strong performance as the impulsive, free-spirited Marianne. The contrast provided by both actresses is what drives the movie. After all, Marianne is Sense, for she relies on the senses of her heart, and Eleanor is Sensibility. Alan Rickman, as always, gives us a spectacular portrayal of the Colonel - wise and old, and deeply in love with Marianne. We feel and at the same time, comprehend his concern for Marianne, and at once, he gains our sympathy as well as respect.Hugh Grant is disappointing as usual. I'm not a fan of Hugh, so perhaps I'm being biased here, but I find his stammering, and blinky eyes really annoying (the guy can't even speak right!). Half the time he is mumbling, and his enunciation is so poor it is hard to catch what he is saying.If Hugh doesn't get too much on your nerves, and if you love a little bit of romance, drama, and comedy, this is definitely your cup of tea.

Jane Austen's depiction of human frailty as well as goodness has always impressed me as being true and very apt, striking home not merely with insightful viewing of human beings but also the very particular aspects that define a person of English gentility in the 1800s.Emma Thompson has certainly done a splendid job with the screenplay. Unlike the recent unfortunate adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", this adaptation includes virtually all of the essential story threads, and gives appropriate screentime to all the characters. One becomes thoroughly engrossed not only in the travails of the two Dashwood sisters, but also all of those they encounter.Kate Winslet is simply perfect as Marianne Dashwood, the sister with all the sensibility. She embodies every aspect of the character - her winsomeness, her charm, her gaiety, the immoderate way in which she throws herself into life, and her lack of prudence. In appearance and behaviour, no better Marianne could have been found.Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, the somewhat shy but intelligent gentleman of excellent morals and strong feelings, whose qualities Marianne learns to appreciate after the tumultuous miseries of her relationship with Willoughby, is excellent - which is no surprise. Is there a role in the world that Alan Rickman cannot play, and play more convincingly than anyone else?Greg Wise as the unreliable Willoughby, whose dashing good looks and romantic persona gain Marianne's love but who ultimately proves to be a man of straw whose self-interest will always lead him to disappoint the hopes of others in pursuit of his own gain, is wonderfully cast.The scheming Lucy Steele is played with extraordinary deftness by the excellent Imogen Stubbs, who portrays not only the machinating and self-serving aspects, but also the encroaching sweetness that deceives so many.Every part, in fact, with the exception of two, is superbly cast.I do consider the film has two flaws - the casting of Emma Thompson as Elinor, and far worse, the casting of Hugh Grant as Edward. Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress, but I find it impossible to think of her as Elinor, both on account of her being visibly too much older than the nineteen of Miss Dashwood in the novel, and also in her portrayal somehow seeming rather too ruefully pragmatic. I suppose I have always envisaged Elinor as being a different type - sensible, calm, yes, but not visibly self-dampening, and of course younger. Hugh Grant as Edward seems to me to have been the film's only major mistake. One does not sense from the novel that Edward is supposed to be a completely inarticulate gentleman, stiff-necked, addicted to such high cravats that he appears to be choking, and with scarcely any qualities that would lead one to suppose him the type likely to attract Elinor. I have always thought of him more as a calm and sensible young man with deep feeling, whose reluctance to communicate with Elinor after he realised he was falling in love with her was due ONLY to his knowledge of his existing entanglement with Miss Steele - not to a reticence and inarticulation that are embedded in his character.I overcame my qualms with regard to the casting of Elinor - after all, Emma Thompson is never less than charming, and she is a wonderful actress indeed. But Hugh Grant as Edward strikes me EVERY time I watch this DVD as... simply wrong.Yet in spite of these things, the film works beautifully in almost every way for me. I'd prefer to give the film 4 and a half stars rather than five, but without that option, let it be five.Abandon the few qualms and enjoy the delicious beauties and witty understanding of human nature in this delightful period piece.",5,"A fine adaptation that will please most viewers, sans Grant",1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,4043,"['film', 'beautiful', 'particular', 'fresh', 'green', 'loveliness', 'gentlefolk', '18th', '/', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'delight', 'watch', 'screenplay', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'combining', 'sensible', 'likeable', 'characters', 'truly', 'absurd', 'characters', 'not', 'mention', 'characters', 'are', 'morally', 'enfeebled', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'depiction', 'human', 'frailty', 'as', 'well', 'goodness', 'always', 'impressed', 'being', 'true', 'very', 'apt', 'striking', 'home', 'not', 'merely', 'insightful', 'viewing', 'human', 'beings', 'also', 'very', 'particular', 'aspects', 'define', 'person', 'English', 'gentility', '1800s.Emma', 'Thompson', 'certainly', 'done', 'splendid', 'job', 'screenplay', 'recent', 'unfortunate', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'adaptation', 'virtually', 'essential', 'story', 'threads', 'appropriate', 'screentime', 'characters', 'One', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'not', 'only', 'travails', 'two', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'also', 'encounter.Kate', 'Winslet', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Marianne', 'Dashwood', 'sister', 'sensibility', 'aspect', 'character', 'winsomeness', 'charm', 'gaiety', 'immoderate', 'way', 'life', 'lack', 'prudence', 'appearance', 'behaviour', 'better', 'Marianne', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'found.Alan', 'Rickman', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'intelligent', 'gentleman', 'excellent', 'morals', 'strong', 'feelings', 'qualities', 'Marianne', 'appreciate', 'tumultuous', 'miseries', 'relationship', 'Willoughby', 'excellent', 'surprise', 'role', 'world', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'play', 'more', 'convincingly', 'anyone', 'else', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'unreliable', 'Willoughby', 'dashing', 'good', 'looks', 'romantic', 'persona', 'gain', 'Marianne', 'love', 'who', 'ultimately', 'be', 'man', 'straw', 'self-interest', 'will', 'always', 'lead', 'disappoint', 'hopes', 'others', 'pursuit', 'own', 'gain', 'wonderfully', 'cast.The', 'scheming', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'played', 'extraordinary', 'deftness', 'excellent', 'Imogen', 'Stubbs', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'machinating', 'self-serving', 'aspects', 'also', 'encroaching', 'sweetness', 'so', 'many.Every', 'part', 'fact', 'exception', 'two', 'superbly', 'cast.I', 'do', 'consider', 'film', 'two', 'flaws', 'casting', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Elinor', 'far', 'worse', 'casting', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Edward', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'find', 'impossible', 'think', 'Elinor', 'account', 'being', 'visibly', 'too', 'much', 'older', 'nineteen', 'Miss', 'Dashwood', 'novel', 'also', 'portrayal', 'somehow', 'seeming', 'rather', 'too', 'ruefully', 'pragmatic', 'suppose', 'have', 'always', 'envisaged', 'Elinor', 'being', 'different', 'type', 'sensible', 'calm', 'yes', 'not', 'visibly', 'self-dampening', 'course', 'younger', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Edward', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'only', 'major', 'mistake', 'One', 'not', 'sense', 'novel', 'Edward', 'supposed', 'be', 'completely', 'inarticulate', 'gentleman', 'stiff-necked', 'addicted', 'such', 'high', 'cravats', 'be', 'choking', 'scarcely', 'qualities', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'suppose', 'type', 'likely', 'attract', 'Elinor', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'more', 'calm', 'sensible', 'young', 'man', 'deep', 'feeling', 'reluctance', 'communicate', 'Elinor', 'realised', 'was', 'falling', 'love', 'was', 'due', 'ONLY', 'knowledge', 'existing', 'entanglement', 'Miss', 'Steele', 'not', 'reticence', 'inarticulation', 'are', 'embedded', 'character.I', 'overcame', 'qualms', 'regard', 'casting', 'Elinor', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'never', 'less', 'charming', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'indeed', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Edward', 'EVERY', 'time', 'watch', 'DVD', 'simply', 'wrong.Yet', 'spite', 'things', 'film', 'beautifully', 'almost', 'way', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'give', 'film', '4', 'half', 'stars', 'rather', 'five', 'option', 'let', 'be', 'five.Abandon', 'few', 'qualms', 'enjoy', 'delicious', 'beauties', 'witty', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'delightful', 'period', 'piece']",Sense & Sensibility

164667,A2L2RQM47XCVTU,0800141660,Jack Cade,"[3, 5]","In her commentary track, Emma Thompson accurately notes the difference in style between Jane Austen's early  novel Sense and Sensibility (two version A and B so it it is a bit hard to date) and later novels such as Emma. She calls the style of  Sense and Sensibility -- I think- ""prolix"" and in fact it is a much more difficult novel to read than Pride and Predjudice Emma or Persuasion (though not perhaps Mansfield Park). I would rather call the style ""dense"" that is it makes you work to discover its pleasures. I don't know that this density can be reproduced in a film--though it might have a chance in a well conceived mini series (Lonesome  Dove comes to mind). Sense and Sensibility is a disturbing novel--one that resists easy and perhaps any definitive interpretation. What causes its pleasurable vexations is the language (not its ""message"") and as  Thompson notes, only a few lines from the novel were used in the film. Consequently we are presented with a romance--beautifully conceived and superbly acted--a romance well directed and well written (hats off to Emma Thompson) but it is really not Jane Austen and doesn't give us a sense of what it is like to read  Sense and Sensibility. I think Emma Thompson might agree.I have dwelt on the movie's compromises--but given the  time limits of a theatrical release I think this is the best you can do. This is a lovely film with its own integrity.  While it does not prepare a viewer for the novel, it is a graceful achievement in its own right. It has its own intelligence and craft and is well worth seeing. Just keep in mind that the driving intelligences behind this film belong to Ang Lee and Emma Thompson (and the splendid cast) Jane Austen's vision (and I still don't know quite how to describe that after many readings) is only remotely present. This probably sounds like an indirect slap at the movie; it is not.

I have comfort films, and Ang Lee's, (and Emma Thompson's), ""Sense And Sensibility"" is one of my favorites. I have watched this movie several times since I first saw it, and it never fails to lift my spirits.This glorious romance of mores and manners, set during England's Regency Period, is very faithful to Jane Austen's brilliant novel. The film vividly brings the novel, with all its characters, to life. The plot focuses on two of the three Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, and their extremely different temperaments. Emma Thompson wrote this wonderful screenplay and earned an Academy Award for her efforts. She added pizzazz to the film, with an extra dash of drama, some humor, splendid panoramic views and a fabulous ball scene.A lovely, young Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood to perfection. Marianne is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters. She has a more practical, sensible temperament. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Ms. Thompson gives Elinor a wicked, dry sense of humor, and her character adds much wit to the dialogue. Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.The movie opens dramatically, with Mr. Dashwood, the girls' father, on his deathbed, begging his son and heir, (by his first marriage), to please take care of his wife and three daughters after he dies. The spineless John Dashwood sincerely promises his father to do so, and then is persuaded not to by his greedy wife, Fanny, in a wonderful satire-filled scene. Before Elinor, Marianne, their adorable younger sister Margaret, and their mother are forced to leave their home, the Norwood estate, they meet Fanny's brother, the shy and kind Edward Ferrars, (Hugh Grant). Over a period of a few weeks, while the women are packing their belongings, Elinor and Edward grow obviously fond of each other. Their attachment is interrupted by Fanny, who senses the bond forming between her sister-in-law and her brother, and urges the four Dashwood women to leave immediately for their new home.Upon arriving at their new residence, Barton Cottage, near the estate of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, the women meet their relatives and some new neighbors. Colonel Brandon, played by the charismatic Alan Rickman, is included in the welcome party. Brandon is drawn at once to the beautiful, musical Marianne, who does not reciprocate his affection. Instead she falls madly in love with the dashing Willoughby, and Greg Wise is extremely dashing in his persuasive performance as the reckless, feckless young suitor.The family settles in and explores their surroundings. Elinor waits in vain for Edward to visit her at Barton Cottage. Willoughby's expected marriage proposal to Marianne is unexpectedly interrupted.

To condense a wonderful novel into a wonderful film can't be easy, and Emma Thompson did the best job of adapting an Austen novel into a film script that I've ever seen. Each scene is carefully written to tell the viewer exactly what she needs to know. For example, the opening scenes of Fanny and John make their relationship to each other and their eventual (mis)treatment of the Dashwood sisters painfully evident. And it doesn't hurt things that the cast is wonderful. Emma Thompson (though technically too old to be Elinor) is, as always, wonderfully expressive, and Alan Rickman does a great job of evoking sympathy and respect for Col. Brandon. The only weak spot I found was Hugh Grant. He seems extremely uncomfortable in 18th century clothes, and I found his mannerisms distracting.

164676,A106016KSI0YQ,0800141660,Jay Dickson,"[1, 1]","Along with the famous Andrew Davies BBC/A&E; miniseries of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was the first of the famous series of adaptations in the mid 90s that sparked a kind of cultural Jane Austen boom. It was also considered at the time one of the best, although its pretty-pretty costumes, sets and cinematography were soon supplemented in the imagination(almost blessedly) by the terrifically gritty and muddy BBC version of PERSUASION helmed by Roger Mitchell. Even so, the exquisite prettiness of this Ang Lee-directed version presents one vision of Jane Austen very dear to many readers' hearts, and the deservedly Oscar-winning screenplay by Emma Thompson brings out much of the novel's great humor as well as its poignancy, and makes the plot's many twists and turns compelling.Many Austen scholars at the time noted that Thompson (then thirty-six) was too old to be quite believable at the elder and more stoic of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor; but the difference in marriageability ages in the late 20th century seems to account better now for the disparity in Thompson's age and that of her heroine. Similarly, though Hugh Grant was faulted in 1995 for pulling a more pronounced version of his usual adorably bashful stammering shtick as Elinor's admirer, Edward Ferrars, in retrospect it seems quite approrpiate to the character (and helps explain why he has such difficulty making his love for Elinor known in his earlier scenes). What has not improved over time is the odd casting of Alan Rickman as the more faithful of Marianne's beaux, Colonel Brandon: his sinister and slow delivery (used to such beautiful effect in other films) seems oddly out of whack, such that by the end it seems almost as if the Dashwoods are marrying poor Marianne off to a second Bluebeard. Much more successful are the impossibly dashing Greg Wise (Thompson's romantic partner after this film) as Willoughby, the estimable Harriet Walter as Mrs. John Dashwood, Hugh Laurie as an amusingly sour Mr. Palmer, and Elizabeth Spriggs as the impossibly vivacious Mrs. Jennings. The highest performing honors belong to Emma Thompson, ideally cast as the patient Elinor, and Kate Winslet as her emotional sister Marianne: it is a testament to both women's skills that, though they had played very similar roles recently before this film that had made enormous impacts (Thompson as the sisterly and wise Margaret Schlegel in HOWARDS END, and Winslet as the overwrought teenager Juliet Hulme in HEAVENLY CREATURES), their performances in this film are quite distinct from those earlier successes.",4,Uncommon Women,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2593,"['famous', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'BBC/A', 'E', 'miniseries', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', 'was', 'first', 'famous', 'series', 'adaptations', 'mid', '90s', 'sparked', 'kind', 'cultural', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'boom', 'was', 'also', 'considered', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'pretty-pretty', 'costumes', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'were', 'soon', 'supplemented', 'imagination', 'almost', 'blessedly', 'terrifically', 'gritty', 'muddy', 'BBC', 'version', 'PERSUASION', 'helmed', 'Roger', 'Mitchell', 'Even', 'so', 'exquisite', 'prettiness', 'Ang', 'Lee-directed', 'version', 'one', 'vision', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'very', 'dear', 'many', 'readers', 'hearts', 'deservedly', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenplay', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'out', 'much', 'novel', 'great', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'poignancy', 'plot', 'many', 'twists', 'compelling.Many', 'Austen', 'scholars', 'time', 'noted', 'Thompson', 'then', 'thirty-six', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'quite', 'believable', 'elder', 'more', 'stoic', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'difference', 'marriageability', 'ages', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'account', 'better', 'now', 'disparity', 'Thompson', 'age', 'heroine', 'Similarly', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'was', 'faulted', '1995', 'pulling', 'more', 'pronounced', 'version', 'usual', 'adorably', 'bashful', 'stammering', 'shtick', 'Elinor', 'admirer', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'retrospect', 'quite', 'approrpiate', 'character', 'explain', 'why', 'such', 'difficulty', 'making', 'love', 'Elinor', 'known', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'What', 'not', 'improved', 'time', 'odd', 'casting', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'more', 'faithful', 'Marianne', 'beaux', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'sinister', 'slow', 'delivery', 'used', 'such', 'beautiful', 'effect', 'other', 'films', 'oddly', 'whack', 'such', 'end', 'almost', 'Dashwoods', 'are', 'marrying', 'poor', 'Marianne', 'second', 'Bluebeard', 'Much', 'more', 'successful', 'are', 'impossibly', 'dashing', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Thompson', 'romantic', 'partner', 'film', 'Willoughby', 'estimable', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'Mrs.', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'amusingly', 'sour', 'Mr.', 'Palmer', 'Elizabeth', 'Spriggs', 'impossibly', 'vivacious', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'highest', 'performing', 'honors', 'belong', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'ideally', 'cast', 'patient', 'Elinor', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'emotional', 'sister', 'Marianne', 'testament', 'women', 'skills', 'had', 'played', 'very', 'similar', 'roles', 'recently', 'film', 'had', 'made', 'enormous', 'impacts', 'Thompson', 'sisterly', 'wise', 'Margaret', 'Schlegel', 'HOWARDS', 'END', 'Winslet', 'overwrought', 'teenager', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'HEAVENLY', 'CREATURES', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'distinct', 'earlier', 'successes']",Sense & Sensibility

I just finished reading Austen's original, so when I finished the book I dug out my old video copy to see how close it was to the book. It was amazing! There are a few differences which did not detract from the movie in any way. Lucy Steele's older spinster sister was eliminated--her only use in the book was to spill the beans about the secret engagement to the evil Fanny, and Emma Thompson's version merely has Lucy whisper the news to Fanny. Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, who invites them to live in the cottage in Devon, is a widower in the movie, his wife and children gone as characters. They did not add that much to the book--the wife spoils the children and doesn't have any self-identity besides that of mother. (Sounds an awful lot like some so-called stay-at-home moms today!)Finally, the character of Margaret, the youngest sister, has been beefed up considerably. In the book, Margaret has no personality, no role besides someone to keep the mother in the country while the older sisters are in London. In the movie, Margaret's many interests and quirks (the world atlas, the treehouses, the insistence on speaking her mind, her rousing energetic banter with Edward) make her a fully formed, interesting character who adds tremendously to our understanding of why Elinor thinks Edward such a terrific person.It would be great if Jane Austen could write a sequel to Emma Thompson's screenplay, telling whatever became of Margaret!",5,I always cry at the end,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1476,"['What', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Austen', 'original', 'when', 'finished', 'book', 'dug', 'out', 'old', 'video', 'copy', 'see', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'amazing', 'are', 'few', 'differences', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'movie', 'way', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'older', 'spinster', 'sister', 'was', 'eliminated', 'only', 'use', 'book', 'was', 'spill', 'beans', 'secret', 'engagement', 'evil', 'Fanny', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'version', 'merely', 'Lucy', 'news', 'Fanny', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'cousin', 'John', 'who', 'live', 'cottage', 'Devon', 'widower', 'movie', 'wife', 'children', 'gone', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'that', 'much', 'book', 'wife', 'children', ""n't"", 'have', 'self-identity', 'besides', 'mother', 'Sounds', 'awful', 'lot', 'so-called', 'stay-at-home', 'moms', 'today', 'Finally', 'character', 'Margaret', 'youngest', 'sister', 'been', 'beefed', 'up', 'considerably', 'book', 'Margaret', 'personality', 'role', 'someone', 'keep', 'mother', 'country', 'older', 'sisters', 'are', 'London', 'movie', 'Margaret', 'many', 'interests', 'quirks', 'world', 'atlas', 'treehouses', 'insistence', 'speaking', 'mind', 'rousing', 'energetic', 'banter', 'Edward', 'make', 'fully', 'formed', 'interesting', 'character', 'who', 'tremendously', 'understanding', 'why', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'terrific', 'person.It', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'could', 'write', 'sequel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'screenplay', 'telling', 'became', 'Margaret']",Sense & Sensibility

Mr. Dashwood has died, and due to the laws of inheritance in 19th century England, the handsome estate passes to the male descendants, and the Dashwood women are evicted by their evil sister in law, Fanny Dashwood, with only 500 pounds a year to support themselves. The Jennings', kind but eccentric cousins in Devonshire, offer them the use of their drafty stone cottage for a nominal rent, and they are packed off and moved with only one servant to attend to their needs.Elinor (portrayed perfectly by Emma Thompson), the sensible oldest sister, has a tight rein on her emotions and is ever aware of the proprieties of single women in society, and struggles to keep within their budget. She mourns the fact that ladies are taught no useful skills, are not allowed to earn their living and are totally dependent on the largesse of men. She has also fallen in love with Edward Farris (Hugh Grant), the brother of Fanny, but Fanny is intent on keeping them apart, for the family has grander plans for Edward.Marianne (Kate Winslet), is the emotional, romantic expressive younger sister who recites Shakespearean sonnets, and plays mournful, romantic songs on the pianoforte. She falls passionately in love with John Willoughby, the handsome rake from a nearby estate, who toys with her affections but never openly declares his love for her. All the while, she is being courted by Colonel Brandon, a mature thoughtful and sensitive gentleman who is smitten with this spirited middle sister.The youngest sister, Margaret, still a child of 12 or so, is playful and loves to study her atlas and travel in her mind.The verdant scenery, opulent period costumes, and lavish English manors and ballrooms will mesmerize you.

She can say more with silence than any actress I've ever seen. This is a wonderful cast with every single person ""spot on"" in their performance. It is beautifully filmed. I've looked at it many times and it makes every other production of this book just seem boring. I was a little perplexed by the way  Hugh Grant seemed to creep around on his toes sort of bent forward in most scenes but I assume that is what he was directed to do. He certainly made a charming and believable Eward Ferrars and that is what is important. I thought Alan Rickman was wonderful as Col. Brandon and I've never seen Marianne portrayed better than Kate Winslet did it. She gave it just the correct touch of young love out of control and unable to help her behavior.

Adapting novels to the big screen is always tricky but Emma Thompson did an excellent job of fitting the essentials into this film's 136 minutes.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility).  They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were.  I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending.The casting is largely excellent.  Emma Thompson is too old to play Elinor but at least she plays her well.  Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Kate Winslet, and the entire cast all perform at a very high level.

164698,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0800141660,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 6]","A couple of weeks back, I saw the 1996 A&E; production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Putting my ""real man"" self image at extreme risk, I admitted publicly that I enjoyed this most excellent film immensely. Pushing reputation even closer to the edge, I viewed the 1995 release of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY last weekend. (I need something to watch while doing the ironing.) The theme of both films seems to be ""anxious females seek Princes Charming to rescue them from rural spinsterhood"", which, on the knowledgeable authority of a good friend and Jane Austen obsessive, is common to all of the author's works. Feminists may cringe at that generalization, but there wasn't much in the way of bra-burning in the first decade of the 19th century when Austen was busy scribbling.S&S; opens at the side of Mr. Dashwood's deathbed, at which point he's leaving his entire estate to his son John (James Fleet) in conjunction with the latter's promise to financially provide for his half-sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois). Subsequently, though John gives lip service to generous support of his siblings, he's easily dissuaded by his selfish wife, Fanny (Harriet Walter). Soon, the three Dashwood sisters and their mother are tossed out of their Great House to live in a (rather large) cottage on a cousin's estate. With no dowries to back them up, the two eldest, Elinor and Marianne, are left to Fate and their own charms to attract men of means to wed. So, Elinor may or may not be favored by the younger of Fanny's brothers, Edward (Hugh Grant). And Marianne is adored by the socially awkward Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), but she only has doe eyes for the dashing Willoughby (Greg Wise). It's such a puzzle.My opinion of S&S; suffers from having previously seen P&P.; It's difficult to be fair since the latter is by far and away the richer and more humorous presentation. Emma Thompson is, however, superb as the sensible sister who, while dealing with her own turmoil of the heart, must support the feelings-driven Marianne as the latter careens from one emotional extreme to the next. Alan Rickman is marvelous as the suitor tortured by the demons of unrequited love. On the other hand, I wasn't quite so impressed with Grant as Edward, who was painfully ill at ease in the presence of adult women. (A deer caught in the high beams comes to mind.) Normally, the unassuming shyness of Grant's roles is appealing, but this time it was a bit over the top. Either that or his Georgian-era shorts were bunched and his collar too tight. And because P&P; is over twice as long as S&S;, the script of the former could afford to include some minor personalities of cleverly done eccentricity. The costuming and choreography in S&S; seemed a realistic depiction of the times, but I'm as poorly equipped to adjudicate now as I was for the same elements of P&P.; One thing I can judge, though, is the English countryside that's like no other that I've enjoyed. Towards the end, there was the panoramic view of a wind-rippled, grassy valley sloping down to the sea, probably in Devonshire. I was so ""homesick"" that I teared just a trifle.Because the pace of the story caused me to doze off for a couple of brief moments, I can't in good conscience award more than four and one-half stars.

I have several problems with it, including much of the casting and some of the writing as well. Really my feelings towards this and P&P95; are quite similar, but at least this movie doesn't have any of the ""sexed up"" content Andrew Davies put in P&P.; Why do I have so many problems with both of these versions? Is it just because I think they're overrated and I have a tendency to root for the underdog blindly? Well, no. But that is admittedly a small part of it. Rather, I already found flaws in each adaptation but these were magnified after constantly hearing people say how ""perfect"" they are. I'm really not trying to offend any fans of this movie. I AM a fan of this movie, own it on DVD, and have watched it multiple times. I just think it's not as good as many fans seem to think it is. And any time I hear ""definitive"" about any adaptation (even my absolute favorites), it drives me up the wall!The casting is my biggest problem with this movie. Most of the actors are frankly, way too old for their roles. Okay, maybe if EVERY character were aged up it would make sense. But they're not and that just adds to the problem.

164732,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0800141660,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 8]","I suppose it makes perfect sense that if you want to make a 19th-century English romance novel into a superb film you hire an actress almost twice the age of the main character to not only play the role but also adapt the screenplay into a book and then hire a Taiwanese director to direct the film.  You might say, yes, such things happen in Hollywood, but the success of ""Sense and Sensibility"" is due to what transpired in England, not Southern California.  Having read the novel and the original screenplay, the largest share of credit goes to Emma Thompson, who deservedly received the Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation.  Thompson began by dramatizing every scene in the novel, which resulted in 300 hand written pages to be followed by 14 drafts as the 1811 novel was crafted into the final script.  The result was a script that manages to be not only romantic and funny, but also romantic and funny in the best Austen sense of both.After watching the film again I focus on three particular points, which I think best reveal the strength of Thompson's script.  First, the entire introductory sequence, which induces us to like the Dashwood sisters because we are introduced first to their step-brother and his shrewish wife (credit for this particular sequence also goes to Film Editor Tim Squyres, who recut the scene so that we get all of one side and then the other instead of alternating back and forth as in the original script).  Our sympathies cannot help but be with the plight of Elinor and Marianne.  Second, the use of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not the marriage of true minds""), which Marianne and Willoughby share to their great mutual delight (except he gets a word wrong, in an elegant little bit of foreshadowing) and which Marianne repeats standing in the rain looking at Willoughby's new estate.  Third, Austen has Elinor bolt from the room to cry outside during the happy ending but Thompson creates a wonderful moment by having her stay in the room and having the rest of her family flee.  There are not too many scenes where you are crying and laughing at the same time, but Thompson certainly created one (and has the added virtue of relying on herself as an actress to nail the performance as well).  All of these are marvelous examples of playing to the strength of the cinema to bring Austen's novel to the screen.The performances are first-rate, especially Kate Winslet as the passionate Marianne, Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon (the look on his face when Marianne thanks him for rescuing her is so wondrously touching).  Hugh Grant does find a way of slowing the delivery of his dialogue more than usual, but it does fit the overall pace of the film.  The supporting cast is exactly what you come to expect from a British production with Elizabeth Spriggs stealing every scene she is in as Mrs. Jennings, Robert Hardy as Sir John Middleton, Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, Oliver Ford Davies as Doctor Harris, and the enchanting young Emilie Francois as Margaret Dashwood (""They always kneel down"").  On the darker side of the ledger we have Greg Wise as the less than honorable John Willoughby, and Imogene Stubbs as Lucy Steele and Harriet Walter as Fanny Dashwood vying for the main villainess role in the proceedings.  No wonder Emma Thompson's performance as Elinor is almost lost in the proceedings, but she is the center around which everything resolves who has to keep it together when everybody around her is losing it (even when she first confesses her broken heart, she ends up consoling Marianne instead of the other way around).Ang Lee had already proven he could handle a tale of sisters in love when he directed ""Eat Drink Man Woman.""  In ""Sense and Sensibility"" he has the script, the actors and the set design all working in his favor to create a sense of 19th century England.  But there are a few moments when he uses the camera to great advantage; in particular the overhead shot of Marianne on her sick bed achieves a painting like quality and the tracking shot of Mrs. Jennings running down the street bearing the latest gossip.I first saw this film when visiting England and I was so caught up in the story that I had no idea who was going to end up with who.  Actually, I was sort of rooting for Elinor to end up with Colonel Brandon since they were obviously the two finest members of their respective sexes in the proceedings.  So the ending was as much of a surprise to me as it was to the Dashwoods, which is certainly something to be cherished.  Obviously if you love this film it will lead you to other Austen adaptations (the film versions of ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" along with the BBC mini-series ""Pride & Prejudice"" immediately leap to mind), but hopefully it will also lead you to the original novels as well.  Finally, Thompson published ""The Sense and Sensibility: Screenplay & Diaries,"" which I would highly recommend after you have done both the film and the novel.",5,A superb job of bringing Jane

Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat.

164737,A2HKRNELD7DGX1,0800141660,Lili_K,"[6, 7]","I remember first seeing the film in the cinema and also very well remember the total enchantment I felt. The production has captivated me right from the start and still does whenever I watch it over and over again.The chemistry between the Dashwood sisters played by Emma Thompson (sensible, rational and seemingly restraint Elinor) and Kate Winslet (passionate, oversensitive and open Marianne)works wonderfully. The family picture completed with Gemma Jones as Mrs Dashwood and Emily F. as Margaret is lovely and lively. There are some fresh family scenes where Margaret gets more attention (she is not wholly portraited in the book as a rather insignificant character)giving light touches to the film preventing it to become too gloomy at certain points.Emma Thompson created an absolutely wonderful screenplay. Sad and funny events alternate each other increasing and relaxing tension making the film intriguing and exciting from first minute to the last.A pity that two scenes were deleted where Elinor's character - a dialogue between her and her mother - gets highlighted even further and a pity for the deleted kiss with Hugh Grant. Fortunately they can be enjoyed as extras on the DVD.As to male performance, I found Alan Rickman's colonel Brandon - the character is actually a bit flat in the book, not too much excitement there - totally stunning. He gave dimension to the character: he was humane, gentle and good, but very manly without a trace of boredom in him.

He manages to convey  every nuance of the manners of that time and keeps the story as fresh to the modern audience as when it was first written.Basically, it is a story of a formerly wealthy widow who is left in very moderate circumstances and who needs to marry off her two oldest daughters. Emma Thompson is cast as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters and the most &quot;sensible&quot;.  Kate Winslet, who later rose to fame in Titanic, is the younger and more impetuous one.  Both are excellent actresses and their performances ring with absolute nuanced perfection.Hugh Grant is cast as Elinor Dashword's love interest, and Kate Winslet is romanced by both Alan Rickman as the older and serious landowner and Greg Wise as the dashing young man who sweeps her off her feet.  The road to true love, however, is rife with obstacles, and there is tension throughout because the characters rarely say what they mean as the plot twists and turns and keeps the audience on edge. I was totally caught up in the story, feeling the emotions of the characters and actually finding myself weeping at the very satisfying conclusion.Emma Thompson was nominated for two academy awards for this film -- one for her writing and one for her acting.  She won for her writing the best screenplay based on material from another medium.  Kate Winslet was also nominated for an academy award as best supporting actress.  The movie won the Golden Globe as best motion picture and the list of other awards and nominations are just too numerous to mention.Don't miss this video!

The normally repressed and sedate Elinor, always choosing her words carefully and weighing them before she speaks, bursts out with a tirade against Marianne that almost draws applause from the viewer.It's not that we don't like Marianne; on the contrary, she is herself quite loveable. It's just that at last to see Elinor give way to the turmoil she feels inside is a catharsis for everybody. She's had a very hard time of it, too. First, her father died leaving her, Marianne, their younger sister, and mother destitute and dependent upon others' kindnesses. Then she forms an attachment to her sister-in-law's brother Edward (Hugh Grant_, but when it seems certain he will propose, zilch. Along the way, she is the recipient of a confidence she doesn't want which cuts her to the quick.And Marianne? Well, she has the unwanted attentions of Captain Brandon (Alan Rickman) to contend with, until she is literally swept off her feet by the romantic Willoughby. THEIR engagement seems a done deal, when suddenly, zilch again!Jane Austen was a master at presenting a story which appears to have no happy ending, a story where you suddenly realize you're as blind as the heroine about what is REALLY going on. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a wonderful adaptation of her great novel, the precursor to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

The book included with the set is very cheaply printed, is often difficult to read because of poor typesetting (facsimile of the original printing?), and doesn't even include a copyright. My suggestion is to find a good-quality paperback (Everyman's is probably fine and is certain to be priced right) that includes critiques, some annotation, and all the other goodies included with contemporary printings of literary classics. There's a reason why Jane Austen has been in print for 200 years, and it's not due to her being a ""dead white chick."" First-time readers are to be envied.Austen translates very well to the screen, and this film joins a group of other very enjoyable screen adaptations of her works. The only extras on this disk are a trailer, two commentaries (both fun and informative), and a few deleted scenes that really would've served no purpose other than disturbing the pace of the film. There are a number of subtitle options, including various Asian languages (perhaps a concession to Ang Lee fans). The print is nice and sharp, and is widescreen but not--unfortunately--anamorphic, the sound is clear, and the soundtrack is beautiful and sparingly utilized.The movie itself is a joy, and I'm delighted that something of this quality is actually produced these days. It's very true to the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the novel, and contains not one expletive or hint of innuendo (except of manners). Ms. Thompson and Mr. Lee manage to treat us to a consistently engaging slice of Regency life that reminds us that the reason why classics are still read is that they're relevant, ultimately, to the human experience in general. Virtually anyone, regardless of background, can relate to these characters and their situations.Ignore quibblers who complain that Thompson is too old for the part; these are the same types who'd complain that Mary Martin was too old to play Maria in The Sound of Music.

164767,A2XPZIPA875X6O,0800141660,Milli Thornton,"[7, 7]","This movie is so much fun. Back in the 70s, when I was the only geek girl in high school reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS and all titles by Jane Austen, little did I suspect that anyone would ever make hugely popular movies out of what (at that time) was fare for only the most devoted of bookworms.The adaptation of this classic author by actor/screenwriter Emma Thompson is superb. However, many of the other reviewers have praised Thompson's brilliance in detail, so instead I'll touch on another favorite feature of mine: the supporting cast.Remember Siegfried Farnon, the older, robust vet from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL? His name is Robert Hardy and here he plays the kindly but rambunctious uncle. Somehow, somewhere they found an actress to play his mother who is so like Robert Hardy in looks and personality, you'd swear they were blood relatives. This lively, raucous pair gift the Dashwood sisters and their bereaved mother with a humble cottage when they're left homeless (or, rather, mansionless) by the death of their father. Generous deeds aside, if there's juicy gossip to be had, these two will be sure to ""winkle it out of you.""There are too many wonderful supporting roles in this movie filled by excellent actors, so I'll mention just one more. Harriet Walter plays Fanny Dashwood to perfection - the stingy in-law who's gone power-drunk now that her husband has inherited the home and wealth his sisters have just lost. In one pivotal scene, Fanny coaxes the secretly engaged Lucy Steele to spill her romantic secret. ""I'm as silent as the grave,"" says the horrible Fanny, leaning in close to the unsuspecting girl. As she leans, you get the distinct impression she *is* the grave. And all from one look. Harriet Walter plays the villain with a sense of humor about herself that can only be described as delicious.The title of this story refers to the dispositions of the two older Dashwood sisters. ""Sense"" is the practical and commonsense Elinor, played by Emma Thompson - the ultra-responsible elder sister who appears not to give in to the longings of her heart. ""Sensibility"" refers to the demonstrative Miss Marianne, played by Kate Winslet, who wears her heart on her sleeve and pooh-poohs anyone who doesn't.

Young women with no means looking for a good match.  The Dashwood sisters' father has passed away and they have lost their means of support.  The cousin who inherited the land has put them on a meager allowance and forced them to move to a small cottage with their mother (Gemma Jones).Elinor (Emma Thompson) meets Edward Ferras (Hugh Grant) and she falls for him.  The problem is she finds that he is promised to another (Imogene Stubbs).While visiting neighbors, Marianne (Kate Winslet) meets the stoic Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  He falls in love at first sight with Marianne but the she meets the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and immediately falls for him.  Unfortunately, Elinor finds out that Willoughby has the reputation of toying with women.In the end true love wins out.  Elinor & Edward and Marianne and Brandon marry.This is a brilliant adaptation in every sense (& sensibility).  Ang Lee had success with a couple of Chinese films and proved that he could adapt into the English language film market.  In interviews he gave a lot of credit to Emma, stating that she worried how the lines were being said and he concentrated on the visual aspect of the film.  This made a perfect combination.Emma wanted better roles and decided to adapt the book.  You can tell by her use of language that she loved the book and Austen's writing.  She deserved her Oscar for the screenplay.  She also deserved her Best Actress nomination.  She has shown in her two Ivory Merchant films (Howard's End and Remains of the Day), plus this, that she is the perfect period romance actress.Kate Winslet had a success in an Australian film but this was the film that brought her to the attention of the mass market.  Alan Rickman was best known for playing villains so this was an unexpected surprise.  He showed that he has a truly romantic side.  The Hugh Grant stereotype, the befuddled gentleman, was created in this film.The production values from sets and costumes to music and cinematography are all first rate.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by Emma Thompson and producer Lindsay DoranCommentary by Ang Lee and co-producer James SchamusEmma Thompson Golden Globe Award acceptance speech - this is worth the price of the DVD alone.",5,Jane - Emma - Ang Elements for a Great Movie,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,2346,"['Sense', 'Sensibility', 'best', 'feature', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'typical', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'plot', 'Young', 'women', 'means', 'looking', 'good', 'match', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'have', 'lost', 'means', 'support', 'cousin', 'who', 'inherited', 'land', 'put', 'meager', 'allowance', 'forced', 'move', 'small', 'cottage', 'mother', 'Gemma', 'Jones', '.Elinor', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Edward', 'Ferras', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'problem', 'promised', 'Imogene', 'Stubbs', 'visiting', 'neighbors', 'Marianne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'stoic', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Marianne', 'dashing', 'John', 'Willoughby', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'immediately', 'falls', 'Unfortunately', 'Elinor', 'out', 'Willoughby', 'reputation', 'toying', 'end', 'true', 'love', 'out', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'Marianne', 'Brandon', 'marry.This', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'sense', 'sensibility', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'had', 'success', 'couple', 'Chinese', 'films', 'proved', 'could', 'adapt', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'market', 'interviews', 'gave', 'lot', 'credit', 'Emma', 'stating', 'worried', 'how', 'lines', 'were', 'being', 'said', 'concentrated', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'made', 'perfect', 'combination.Emma', 'wanted', 'better', 'roles', 'decided', 'adapt', 'book', 'can', 'tell', 'use', 'language', 'loved', 'book', 'Austen', 'writing', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'also', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'shown', 'two', 'Ivory', 'Merchant', 'films', 'Howard', 'End', 'Remains', 'Day', 'perfect', 'period', 'romance', 'actress.Kate', 'Winslet', 'had', 'success', 'Australian', 'film', 'was', 'film', 'brought', 'attention', 'mass', 'market', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'villains', 'was', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'showed', 'truly', 'romantic', 'side', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'stereotype', 'befuddled', 'gentleman', 'was', 'created', 'film.The', 'production', 'values', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'cinematography', 'are', 'first', 'rate.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Commentary', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'producer', 'Lindsay', 'DoranCommentary', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'co-producer', 'James', 'SchamusEmma', 'Thompson', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone']",Sense & Sensibility

164786,A2WMPYQA0VDO3H,0800141660,Nickibockers,"[0, 0]","Thanks be to Emma Thompson for bringing this marvellous Jane Austen novel to life so beautifully and respectfully!Let me first remind all reviewers and fans that this story is NO where near the Victorian Era! As an English major and bibliophile, it makes me cringe to read how many people think so. It's like saying that 2000 is the Kennedy era. All Austen is GEORGIAN England, over fifty years before Victoria ever came to the throne; England under the reign of George III/IV; the era of Napolean (the Regency era), complete with less constrictive Grecian-inspired clothing for the women! (Regency: hence the term, EMPIRE waist) By contrast to the rigid manners and clothing of the successive eras, this era is VERY liberal and free, almost contemporary (to our own). Women were not so restricted at this time as they later would be. Isn't that obvious by Marianne's behaviour throughout? =) (And look at Lizzy in P&amp;P! No Victorian woman would have behaved so!)Now to the film: While many changes were made from its source - no Lady Middleton and child, and no child of Mr and Mrs John Dashwood (John and Fanny) - I am guessing that these ommissions of children must be due to the fact that these children were so young, and not all movie makers want to deal with directing young kids. That is all I can think of to excuse this ommission. What we lose is how different the mothering of Mrs Dashwood and Fanny is, as well as how different Sir John Middleton is from his wife- the former extremely gentile and well natured, the other completely snobby. What we also lose is the chief reason John and Fanny would NOT give the Dashwood girls any financial support, lest it &quot;ruin himself and their poor little Harry&quot;. Alas, we see soon enough through Thompson's wonderful screenplay that the step-siblings care for nothing but themselves and this is thrown wonderfully into relief by Elinor, Marianne, Margaret and their mother's more generous behaviour, as well as that of Mrs Jennings and her son-in-law, Sir John Middleton. This said, we lose, too, the contrast between sisters in THIS family - the difference between Charlotte and her sister Lady Middleton. A shame, but still a wonderful film.Keira Knightly is today's Kate Winslet. They are both young, beautiful talented girls. Watching this film again, reminded me how much I loved and currently miss Winslet's acting. Winslet is the perfect Marianne: vibrant, rash, passionate, and utterly Romantic.I had reservations at first about how old was Emma Thompson for the role she played! But she pulls this role of Elinor off admirably, my favourite moment of her acting is when she utterly breaks down at the bedside of her feverish, ill sister - a stirring performance that brought tears to my eyes. As much as I love this film and love the two actors, I could not suspend belief that there was actual chemistry between Grant and Thompson - their performances both made it seem as though they were merely old friends who enjoyed each other's company, not lovers who had been divided with heartache by another (ie, Lucy Steele). Indeed the actor's relationship seemed to seep through into their characters, and this was a shame, as I felt some poignancy was lost.This did not, however, impede any of the fine acting: A finer bumbling Edward was ne'er to be found, and Grant is his usual awkwardness fits this artless, affectionate man to a &quot;T&quot;! A great, comic role.Alan Rickman's Col. Brandon was fantastic - he does not come across as being too old for his role, and is so handsome in looks and performance as Brandon that it would have mattered anyway. He plays wonderfully a handsome, shy, hurt creature whose chemistry with Marianne was subtle, sober and beautiful, not rash and impulsive as was Marianne's and the dashing young Willoughby's, very smoothly played by an exquisite Greg Wise.And what a difference for Hugh Laurie from his Blackadder days! I never thought it was the same person. But he is a fantastic actor, and this screenplay allows him, as Mr Palmer, to be both sardonic throughout and then suddenly revealed as compassionate - a complete alteration of character at the end, well played.Marianne's singing is just lovely, and shows Kate Winslet a very talented girl. It's a shame there is no copy of her performance on any Soundtrack recordings, as countless fans would have purchased it for its amateur sweetness and artless, fine quality.The pace is so quick that one does not notice that more than two hours have gone by, and it seems not enough time to have spent in this beautiful story.So, with fine acting, directing and writing, marvellous costumes, gorgeous countryside scenery and a lush score, this movie can be enjoyed by Austen fans and non-Austen fans alike.",5,Sublime Adaptation,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,4770,"['Thanks', 'be', 'Emma', 'Thompson',

164792,A1AST89AHN17O7,0800141660,Omnes,"[0, 0]","Although the Pride and prejudice tv series with Colin Firth and Jenifer Ehle impressed me, I have to admit that my favorite adaptation of a Jane Austen novel remains Emma Thompson's and Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility.This movie is an adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel in which three sisters, named Elinor, Marianne, Margaret, and their mother have to move out of their home and relocate in a small cottage, due to the death of their father whose house has become the property of their brother-in-law and of his avaricious wife. At the same time, Elinor and Marianne both fall in love with gentlemen, played by Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise, (who became in real life the husband of Emma Thompson herself) and whose lives are not what they seem to be.As I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, I just want to say that what really impressed me was how Ang Lee managed to keep his direction very simple. There are no useless close-ups, no overbearing music and no over acting with his actors. Instead, he just lets them interpret their roles in the most subtlest way. And, unlike certain Jane Austen adaptations, Ang Lee doesn't use flashbacks to explain incidents that occur in the past or to enrich the character's dialogues. Instead, he just lets the actors speak and explain what happened. Finally, Ang Lee's shots look just like asian paintings and add details that were not included in the novel, but enhance the context of the british society in Jane Austen's novel, such as the grand ball which instead of occurring in a big room, happens through different rooms, each divided by a certain social status.As for Emma Thompson's very funny script, she manages to condense the novel's plot in two hours, with such efficiency that she doesn't lose any of the important elements of the story. Not only that, she also gives room to certain characters like Margaret, and even enriches the story with scenes that never occurred in the book, like the discussion between Elinor and Edward in the library as they manage to get Margaret out of her hiding spot. The scene is so funny and believable in its dialogue that you really think that it was in the book, which was something that a professor, or a viewer I'm not too sure, told Emma Thompson and her producer, something they both revealed in the commentaries on the DVD.Speaking of special features, I loved the details and information that Emma Thompson and her producer gave in their commentaries, some of which were also noted in the production diaries of the movie. You get to learn more about the movie 's production and also on her work as screenwriter and all the modifications she had to do to transpose the novel into a movie.Finally, there is, in the special features, an excerpt from the Golden Globes ceremony in 1996, during which Emma Thompson received a prize and did a great speech, imagining what Jane Austen would have said if she had been at that ceremony.In the end, I don't think the movie would have been as successful and as funny if Emma Thopmson and Ang Lee had not been working on this movie, which really deserved its Oscar for best scriptwriting, Golden Globe, and golden bear at the Berlin film festival.",5,My favorite adaptation of a Jane Austen book,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,3202,"['Pride', 'prejudice', 'tv', 'series', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Jenifer', 'Ehle', 'impressed', 'have', 'admit', 'favorite', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Sense', 'Sensibility.This', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'first', 'novel', 'three', 'sisters', 'named', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'Margaret', 'mother', 'have', 'move', 'home', 'relocate', 'small', 'cottage', 'due', 'death', 'father', 'house', 'become', 'property', 'brother-in-law', 'avaricious', 'wife', 'same', 'time', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'fall', 'love', 'gentlemen', 'played', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'who', 'became', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'be.As', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'impressed', 'was', 'how', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'managed', 'keep', 'direction', 'very', 'simple', 'are', 'useless', 'close-ups', 'overbearing', 'music', 'acting', 'actors', 'Instead', 'just', 'interpret', 'roles', 'most', 'subtlest', 'way', 'certain', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'Ang', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'use', 'flashbacks', 'explain', 'incidents', 'occur', 'past', 'enrich', 'character', 'dialogues', 'Instead', 'just', 'actors', 'speak', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'Finally', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'shots', 'look', 'just', 'asian', 'paintings', 'add', 'details', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'novel', 'enhance', 'context', 'british', 'society', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'such', 'grand', 'ball', 'instead', 'occurring', 'big', 'room', 'different', 'rooms', 'divided', 'certain', 'social', 'status.As', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'very', 'funny', 'script', 'condense', 'novel', 'plot', 'two', 'hours', 'such', 'efficiency', ""n't"", 'lose', 'important', 'elements', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'also', 'room', 'certain', 'characters', 'Margaret', 'even', 'story', 'scenes', 'never', 'occurred', 'book', 'discussion', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'library', 'manage', 'get', 'Margaret', 'hiding', 'spot', 'scene', 'so', 'funny', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'something', 'professor', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'told', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'producer', 'something', 'revealed', 'commentaries', 'DVD.Speaking', 'special', 'features', 'loved', 'details', 'information', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'producer', 'gave', 'commentaries', 'were', 'also', 'noted', 'production', 'diaries', 'movie', 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'movie', 'production', 'also', 'work', 'screenwriter', 'modifications', 'had', 'do', 'transpose', 'novel', 'movie.Finally', 'special', 'features', 'excerpt', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'ceremony', '1996', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'received', 'prize', 'did', 'great', 'speech', 'imagining', 'what', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'funny', 'Emma', 'Thopmson', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'working', 'movie', 'really', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'best', 'scriptwriting', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'golden', 'bear', 'Berlin', 'film', 'festival']",Sense & Sensibility

Jane Austen always found a way to create the most impossible situations imaginable to push her characters to the limit. This is the story of Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Elinor (Emma Thompson) and their unlucky situation in life. Due to their father dying they are virtually left homeless except for a small amount of money to live on each year. The story begins with a dramatic deathbed wish and you just know things are not going to work out for the best immediately. What surprised me was how funny this movie is when at times it is a near tragedy. Also the English countryside is so beautiful and there are a couple scenes in the amazing family library. Throughout this movie you will be on the edge of your seat wondering what could go wrong next. There are so many twists and turns in the story that it makes the movie absolutely fascinating. The men in this movie are also very interesting. They range from flaky to extremely chivalrous. Some of them also seem more swayed by money than love. Marianne and Elinor also must endure extreme emotional distress before they get what they want.

The heir swore a deathbed oath to take care of his his step-mother and step-sisters, but his wife, Fanny (I couldn't think of a more appropriate name myself!) talked him out of it at every turn.The second Dashwood family:  Mrs. Dashwood, the mother,  Miss Dashwood--aka Eleanor the eldest (Thompson), Marianne (Winslet), and Margaret, are forced to move to a country cottage and fend for themselves on the $500 a year stipend the estate grants them.  Of course, in the 1800's they cannot have a career.  Further, since they don't have any money for a dowry their matrimonial prospects are not very good, either.Along the way, Marianne learns some lessons about faith and devotion from Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  I'm a huge Rickman fan and this is one of his best performances.  You get used to him playing villanous roles and Colonel Brandon hardly seems like him.Eleanor also discovers Edward Farris (Hugh Grant).

I can't help but think that, based upon the other Austen adaptations I've seen, this is very much in the same vein.

One is &quot;Little Women&quot; and this beautiful film is the other.  It centers around two sisters, who are very different, but a complement to each other.  Marianne, played by the beautiful Kate Winslet, and Eleanor played by the impeccably talented Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay).  What is so refreshing about Jane Austen's writing is how her novels seem contemporary even though they are not.  Her characters speak and behave in ways that anyone today might speak or behave.  The relationships in this film between Eleanor and Edward, and Marianne and Willoughby are very familiar to us because they are typical of a modern day relationship.  Who hasn't been in a situation like Eleanor?  You desperately want to be with someone, but you're too afraid to tell them, or there's someone else in the way?  Or maybe you've been in a relationship like Marianne's, where you're dumped for no apparent reason except money?

The film is visually beautiful (it has the quality of a brightly colored painting), and the performances are absorbing.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play Elinor and Marianne Dashwood respectively, two sisters whose family has been made poorer after their father's death.  Elinor is a sensible and practical young lady, so level-headed in fact that Marianne wonders whether she will ever love passionately; Marianne, on the other hand, is a decided romantic, easily swayed by flowers, poetry and pretty talk.  In the movie they experience the highs and lows of love, and come to learn more about one another and lean upon each other as sisters should.On the male side of the equation are Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), John Willoughby (Greg Wise), and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Elinor comes to feel deeply about the genial, slightly bashful Edward (more than anyone can guess), but must keep her feelings restrained when she discovers that he is promised to another.  As for Willoughby and Brandon, both men factor in Marianne's life.  Willoughby is young and dashing, sweeping Marianne off her feet and playing to all her fantasies of romance; Brandon is an older man who knows he has slim chances with Marianne, and for most of the movie resigns himself to admiring her from afar.The movie is not always tidy in bringing these relationships to resolution (just as the novel is not), but the acting is wonderful, particularly Emma Thompson as Elinor and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.

164826,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,0800141660,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","Emma Thompson, one of my favorite artists and in my opinion, beautiful, was too old to play this part.  Because of her acting skill, the movie was not ruined for me by that, but I kept noticing it.  Ms. Thompson, though not at all old, projects maturity, and Gemma Jones projects younger than she was when this film was made, so even though I hadn't read the book, I kept thinking that Mrs. Dashwood must have birthed Elinor as a teenager.  That was okay for me, but Elinor always seemed 30 in this version of the story, and I kept thinking she would have been considered a spinster by that age and so I didn't understand why her dying father spoke of a dowry for her.  In appearance, a 30 year old Elinor would have long ago had a season, and obviously not married.  She seemed in appearance and behavior, more an aunt to Marianne, and a younger sister to Mrs. Dashwood, though in the story she was sister and daughter.  Anyway, despite the miscasting, I still liked this film, it has many of the actresses/actors I love in it, and everyone did a good job.  I'm happy Ms. Thompson took the part, but it would be nice to see a remake of this screenplay with age appropriate actors - it would likely be even a better movie, provided the actresses/actors are as fine as those in this production.  I've watched it many times and I think my favorite character is Lucy, because she comes from a disadvantaged background and time for women, and just by using her wits, manages to marry well, which in her time was like winning the lottery.  She was the most proactive female character, and I like women action characters, though I usually don't like gold diggers, Lucy has so few options in the 19th century for meaningful work, that marrying well was one of the few respectable options she had for a decent life for herself.  With very few protectors, no great beauty and no education, she married well.  I was pleased the Dashwood girls married well too.  I know I was supposed to feel more deeply for the Dashwood family as they had a reversal of fortune with the death of their beloved husband/father, but even in their financial straits of only 500 pounds a year, they lived in a two story house with two servants, and ate well with their rich relatives as often as they chose.  So they suffered a reversal, but they weren't homeless or without income.  I know the filmmakers tried to show a real fall into poverty, but though they suffered a loss of a beloved family member, whom they never mentioned after they left their family home, it's hard to think of people with two servants as poor, though they were undoubtedly poorer.  Mostly Elinor seemed slightly overly bossy towards Marianne (as if in anticipation of Marianne's disappointment - something I dislike in film, when a character forecasts something too early in the story), and Kate Winslet, though young, seemed older than a super naive 16 year Marianne.  Willouby was not all that impressive to me either - as Marianne's first boyfriend; I think his part should have been written with the care that Edward's part was written - it was clear why Elinor liked Edward; it would have been good to show the reasons Marianne adored Willouby.  I think Willouby carrying Marianne home after she sprained her ankle was to be proof of something, but it was not enough, I needed more Willouby time, more things he actually did that showed why he was so appealing.  After all, Emma Thompson did not just rely on Hugh Grants good looks to show why she was fond of Edward, she showed in the story why Edward's character was so appealing.  With an Elinor too bossy for little reason, and Marianne crushed by a Willouby who was underwritten, it was hard to attach completely to the story, but I attached partially enough to enjoy it, mostly due to the well written Elinor/Edward romance, and the fine acting by all. I'd give it a three and a half stars.",4,liked it but...(SPOILERS IN REVIEW),1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,3899,"['Emma', 'Thompson', 'one', 'favorite', 'artists', 'opinion', 'beautiful', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'part', 'acting', 'skill', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'ruined', 'kept', 'noticing', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'not', 'old', 'projects', 'maturity', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'projects', 'younger', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'must', 'have', 'birthed', 'Elinor', 'teenager', 'was', 'okay', 'Elinor', 'always', 'seemed', '30', 'version', 'story', 'kept', 'thinking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'spinster', 'age', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'dying', 'father', 'spoke', 'dowry', 'appearance', '30', 'year', 'old', 'Elinor', 'would', 'have', 'long', 'ago', 'had', 'season', 'obviously', 'not', 'married', 'seemed', 'appearance', 'behavior', 'more', 'aunt', 'Marianne', 'younger', 'sister', 'Mrs.', 'Dashwood', 'though', 'story', 'was', 'sister', 'daughter', 'Anyway', 'miscasting', 'still', 'liked', 'film', 'many', 'actresses/actors', 'love', 'everyone', 'did', 'good', 'job', ""'m"", 'happy', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'took', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'remake', 'screenplay', 'age', 'appropriate', 'actors', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'provided', 'actresses/actors', 'are', 'as', 'fine', 'production', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'think', 'favorite', 'character', 'Lucy', 'disadvantaged', 'background', 'time', 'women', 'just', 'using', 'wits', 'marry', 'well', 'time', 'was', 'winning', 'lottery', 'was', 'most', 'proactive', 'female', 'character', 'like', 'women', 'action', 'characters', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gold', 'diggers', 'Lucy', 'so', 'few', 'options', '19th', 'century', 'meaningful', 'work', 'marrying', 'well', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'respectable', 'options', 'had', 'decent', 'life', 'herself', 'very', 'few', 'protectors', 'great', 'beauty', 'education', 'married', 'well', 'was', 'pleased', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'married', 'well', 'too', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'feel', 'more', 'deeply', 'Dashwood', 'family', 'had', 'reversal', 'fortune', 'death', 'beloved', 'husband/father', 'even', 'financial', 'straits', 'only', '500', 'pounds', 'year', 'lived', 'two', 'story', 'house', 'two', 'servants', 'ate', 'well', 'rich', 'relatives', 'as', 'often', 'chose', 'suffered', 'reversal', 'were', ""n't"", 'homeless', 'income', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'tried', 'show', 'real', 'fall', 'poverty', 'suffered', 'loss', 'beloved', 'family', 'member', 'whom', 'never', 'mentioned', 'left', 'family', 'home', 'hard', 'think', 'people', 'two', 'servants', 'poor', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'poorer', 'Mostly', 'Elinor', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'overly', 'bossy', 'towards', 'Marianne', 'anticipation', 'Marianne', 'disappointment', 'something', 'dislike', 'film', 'when', 'character', 'something', 'too', 'early', 'story', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'young', 'seemed', 'older', 'super', 'naive', '16', 'year', 'Marianne', 'Willouby', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'impressive', 'either', 'Marianne', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'think', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'care', 'Edward', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'clear', 'why', 'Elinor', 'liked', 'Edward', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'show', 'reasons', 'Marianne', 'adored', 'Willouby', 'think', 'carrying', 'Marianne', 'home', 'sprained', 'ankle', 'was', 'be', 'proof', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'needed', 'more', 'Willouby', 'time', 'more', 'things', 'actually', 'did', 'showed', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'appealing', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'rely', 'Hugh', 'Grants', 'good', 'looks', 'show', 'why', 'was', 'fond', 'Edward', 'showed', 'story', 'why', 'Edward', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'appealing', 'Elinor', 'too', 'little', 'reason', 'Marianne', 'crushed', 'Willouby', 'who', 'was', 'underwritten', 'was', 'hard', 'attach', 'completely', 'story', 'attached', 'partially', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'mostly', 'due', 'well', 'written', 'Elinor/Edward', 'romance', 'fine', 'acting', ""'d"", 'give', 'three', 'half', 'stars']",Sense & Sensibility

I usually start with &quot;I really didn't want to see this movie...&quot;For &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; things were a little different.  I was basically against all chic flicks the first time I watched this.  I had been bored out of my mind by countless Daniel Steel movies, Molly Ringwold movies, soap operas and whatever else my female friends enjoyed watching.  However, out of desperation one night (as it was the only movie in the apartment I hadn't seen), I popped this one in and expected to be asleep and out of my misery shortly.As the movie starts you are introduced to a family conflict something in the Cinderella order.  A nice old man with money is dying.  He is limited by the law in providing for his 2nd wife and their daughters  because the entire estate needs to go to the son to be preserved.  Therefore, on his deathbed, he requests that his son (from his first marriage) looks after them.  However, this son has a wicked, wicked wife who talks him out of almost all support, and these gentlewoman have to pack up and live off the generosity of distant relatives.And so sets up all the dynamics of a typical Austin work (as I have since learned): very cool gentlewomen who don't have the dowry to make them desirable matches.  Will any gentlemen be willing to sacrifice monetary gain for true love or will the women end up as old maids?While that plotline has been at the core of many boring, cliche, catty, or empty Victorian films, what Emma Thompson (actress and screenwriter) has done with this one is pure magic. Rather than focus on how different the era was (the dress, the parties, the etiquette), Thompson sucks you in to the humanity of the characters themselves.  Yes, they dress differently and have different societal rules placed upon them.  But they feel and love and dream as we do.  She brings the whole world to life, showing how people like us express themselves though the mediums they had at the time - through music, poetry, significant looks, walks, etc.Marianne's (Kate Winslet) story is moving and heart-breaking because of the disillusionment of her youthful confidence and trust.  She represents the &quot;Sense&quot; in the movie - one who trusts her feelings and the feelings of her beloved.  She lives how we are often encouraged to live today - to do what feels right and to express everything.  Elinor's (Emma Thompson) role, on the other hand, is one of the most mature I've ever seen in a film.  As the &quot;Sensible&quot; sister, she follows the Victorian era values when it comes to confiding in others, expressing herself, and expecting anything from her true love (Hugh Grant).  Yet you see that she does this not out of mindless obedience but because she understands the wisdom behind such etiquette.  When her heart finally breaks in spite of all of her carefulness and reserve, yours breaks with her and I cried for the first time in years.I don't want to spoil the ending (and don't worry, I haven't), but Thompson wraps this movie up to perfection.  She seems to have done everything perfectly in the film - from the timing, the character development, the resolution, etc.  Ever since I have seen this film, I have yeared for another to bring me to that era in a similar manner but have yet to find one.  There are some good ones out there, but nothing touches what was accomplished in this film!",5,Watch It!

164842,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0800141660,Themis-Athena,"[294, 307]","When Emma Thompson was approached with the suggestion to write a screenplay based on Jane Austen's first novel ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1811), she was somewhat doubtful because, as she explains on the DVD's commentary track, she felt that other Austen works, like the more expressive ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" or the sardonic ""Pride and Prejudice"" (already the subject of several adaptations) would have been more suitable.  Four years and 14 screenplay drafts later (the first, a 300-page handwritten dramatization of the novel's every scene), ""Sense and Sensibility"" made its grand entrance into theaters worldwide and mesmerized audiences and critics alike, resulting in an Oscar for Thompson's screenplay and six further nominations (Best Picture, Leading Actress - Thompson -, Supporting Actress - Kate Winslet -, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score - for 20 minutes' worth of composition - and Costume Design); and double honors as Best Picture and for Thompson's screenplay at the Golden Globes.More than simple romances, Jane Austen's novels are delicately constructed pieces of social commentary, written from her rural Hampshire's perspective.  Mostly confined to life in her father's parish, she was nevertheless well aware of early 19th century England's society at large, and fiercely critical of the loss of morals and decorum she saw in its pre-industrial emergent city life.  Moreover, experience and observation had made her acutely aware of the corsets forced onto women in fashion terms as much as by social norms, confining them to inactivity and complete dependency on their families' and their (future) husbands' money.  And among this movie's greatest strengths is the manner in which it maintains that underlying theme of Austen's writing and brings it to a contemporary audience's attention.  ""You talk about feeling idle and useless: imagine how that is compounded when one has no hope and no choice of any occupation whatsoever,"" Elinor Dashwood (Thompson) tells her almost-suitor Edward Ferrars, and when he replies that ""our circumstances are therefore precisely the same,"" she corrects him: ""Except that you will inherit your fortune - we cannot even earn ours.""Rescuing much from the first draft dramatization of Austen's novel and amplifying where necessary, Emma Thompson and director Ang Lee (""who most unexplainably seems to understand me better than I understand myself,"" Thompson said in her mock-Austen Golden Globe speech) produced a movie scrupulously faithful to what is known about Austen's world and at the same time incredibly modern, thus emphasizing the novel's timeless quality.  Paintings were consulted for the movie's production design, and indeed, almost every camera frame - both landscapes and interiors - has the feeling of a picture by a period painter.  Thompson cleverly uses poetry where the novel does not contain dialogue; and again, she does so in a manner entirely faithful to Austen's subtleties - most prominently in the joint recital of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 by Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet) and John Willoughby (Greg Wise), where an ever so slight inaccuracy in his rendition of a sonnet he claims to love foreshadows his lacking sincerity.""Sense and Sensibility"" revolves around Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, their quest for a suitable husband, and the sisters' relationship with each other.  Emma Thompson maintains that she did not write the screenplay with herself as Elinor in mind and would not have been accepted for that role but for the success of her previous films (""Howards End,"" ""The Remains of the Day""); yet, it is hard to imagine who could have better played sensible Elinor: ""effectual, ... [possessing] a coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen [and thus considerably younger than Thompson], to be the counselor of her mother.""  And real-life 19-year-old Kate Winslet embodies sensitive, artistic Marianne: ""eager in everything; [without] moderation ... generous, amiable, interesting: ... everything but prudent.""  (As an older actress was sought for that part, her agent presented her as 25.)  An early scene in which Marianne recites Hartley Coleridge's Sonnet VII (""Is love a fancy or a feeling?  No.  It is immortal as immaculate truth"") symbolizes the sisters' relationship and their personalities, as Marianne mocks Elinor's seemingly cool response to Edward's budding affection.  (Mostly taken from the novel, the scene is embellished by the screenplay's sole inexactitude: Coleridge's sonnets were only published 22 years later).  Yet, when all her hope seems shattered, Elinor, in a rare outburst of emotion, rebukes her sister: ""What do you know of my heart?"" - only to comfort her again when she sees that Marianne is equally distraught.Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman similarly perfectly portray the sisters' suitors Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon, both embodying the qualities Austen considered essential: simplicity, sincerity and a firm sense of morality.  Willoughby, on the other hand, while entering the story like the proverbial knight on a white horse who rescues the injured Marianne, does not live up to the high expectations he evokes; he causes Marianne to unacceptably abandon decorum and, just as he misspoke in that line from Shakespeare's sonnet, his love eventually ""bends with the remover to remove.""  Similarly, Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs), the near-stumbling block to Elinor's happiness, ultimately proves driven by nothing but an ""unceasing attention to self-interest ... with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience"" (Austen) and is, despite a fortuitous marriage, as marginalized as the Dashwoods' greedy sister-in-law Fanny (Harriet Walter).  Conversely, the boisterous Sir John Middleton and his garrulous mother-in-law, while annoying in their insensitivity, are essentially goodnatured; and marvelously portrayed in their flawed but warmhearted ways by Robert Hardy and Elizabeth Spriggs.""Sense and Sensibility"" came out at the height of the mid-1990s' Jane Austen revival.  Of all movies released then, and alongside 1996's ""Emma"" (which has ""Hollywood"" written all over it) and the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"" (which finally established Colin Firth as the leading man in the U.S. that he had long been in Britain), Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is one of those adaptations that future generations of moviegoers will likely turn to in years to come.  And it is truly an experience not to be missed.Also recommended:The Complete Novels of Jane Austen (Wordsworth Library Collection)Jane Austen Collection (Sense & Sensibility / Emma / Persuasion /

164845,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,0800141660,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[0, 0]","With an engaging plot, witty dialogue, and consummate acting by an all-star British cast (there really isn't one performance that could even be described as mediocre here!), this is one of the most delightful films I've seen.  Emma Thompson received a well-deserved Oscar for this splendid screen adaption of Jane Austen's classic novel.  Indeed, it is rare that I enjoy a dramatisation more than the novel, but I must confess that I did so here.This is a story about love and propriety in early 19th-century England, and it follows a chapter in the lives of the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  Their lives (together with those of their mother (Gemma Jones) and youngest sister) have been thrown into disarray by the death of their father (Tom Wilkinson), whose estate has been left to his son by a previous marriage (James Fleet--The Vicar of Dibley's Hugo).  At a time when money not only was equated with privilege and power but was essential for one's very survival, Elinor and Marianne, having neither an independent income nor dowries, are in the unenviable position (unlike Austen's Emma) of having to make a good marriage whilst having little but their appearance and personalities to recommend them.Marianne, however, (the younger of the two) is an impetuous, idealistic romantic, for whom love must be some great all-consuming passion or it simply isn't love.  She wears her heart on her sleeve, and when ""love"" strikes in the dashing form of the dynamic Mr. Willoughby (Greg Wise) whom she takes to be a kindred spirit, she succumbs to her emotions.  Her overwhelming passion leads her to lose all common sense and act with reckless impropriety.Marianne's love is of the kind idealised by the Romantic poets and authors of the time (of which Austen was NOT one!)--the kind of love which cares not a toss for propriety, reputation or other societally imposed values.  It is also, alas, oblivious to boring monetary concerns such as wealth or poverty--concerns which in the cold light of day (and as the story bears out) few could disregard for all their talk to the contrary, and which were ultimately the deciding factor in many a marriage.Realistic rather than romantic, Elinor is of a calmer, more reserved nature, and not the sort to indulge in her emotions.  Indeed, if any fault can be found with her behaviour, it is that she is, perhaps, a little too reserved as even the object of her affections is unaware of her true feelings!  That said, she behaves sensibly, with dignity, and with concern for others, regardless of what she may be feeling inside (and this is also true of the gentlemen in the story--the real gentlemen, that is--played by Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant).Though set some 200 years ago, this is truly a film of timeless value.  If you've enjoyed the Firth/Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice in particular or you enjoy period productions in general, you'll definitely want to check this one out.  But it's such a good film all around--clean, warm-hearted and with plenty of comic relief--that I believe it's appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for quality entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it most highly, and I look forward to reading the companion book: The Sense and Sensibility Screenplay and Diaries by Emma Thompson.",5,A Splendid Adaptation of a Classic Novel!,1052524800,"05 10, 2003",2003,3379,"['engaging', 'plot', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'consummate', 'acting', 'all-star', 'British', 'cast', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'performance', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'described', 'mediocre', 'here', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'splendid', 'screen', 'adaption', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'novel', 'Indeed', 'rare', 'enjoy', 'dramatisation', 'more', 'novel', 'must', 'confess', 'did', 'so', 'here.This', 'story', 'love', 'propriety', 'early', '19th-century', 'England', 'chapter', 'lives', 'two', 'eldest', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Marianne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'lives', 'together', 'mother', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'youngest', 'sister', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'disarray', 'death', 'father', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'estate', 'been', 'left', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'James', 'Fleet', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'Hugo', 'time', 'when', 'money', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'equated', 'privilege', 'power', 'was', 'essential', 'one', 'very', 'survival', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'having', 'independent', 'income', 'dowries', 'are', 'unenviable', 'position', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'having', 'make', 'good', 'marriage', 'whilst', 'having', 'little', 'appearance', 'personalities', 'recommend', 'them.Marianne', 'however', 'younger', 'two', 'impetuous', 'idealistic', 'romantic', 'whom', 'love', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'all-consuming', 'passion', 'simply', ""n't"", 'love', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'when', 'love', 'strikes', 'dashing', 'form', 'dynamic', 'Mr.', 'Willoughby', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'whom', 'be', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'succumbs', 'emotions', 'overwhelming', 'passion', 'lose', 'common', 'sense', 'act', 'reckless', 'impropriety.Marianne', 'love', 'kind', 'idealised', 'Romantic', 'poets', 'authors', 'time', 'Austen', 'was', 'NOT', 'one', 'kind', 'love', 'not', 'toss', 'propriety', 'reputation', 'other', 'societally', 'imposed', 'values', 'also', 'alas', 'oblivious', 'boring', 'monetary', 'concerns', 'such', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'concerns', 'cold', 'light', 'day', 'story', 'out', 'few', 'could', 'disregard', 'talk', 'contrary', 'were', 'ultimately', 'deciding', 'factor', 'many', 'marriage.Realistic', 'rather', 'romantic', 'Elinor', 'calmer', 'more', 'reserved', 'nature', 'not', 'sort', 'indulge', 'emotions', 'Indeed', 'fault', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'behaviour', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'reserved', 'even', 'object', 'affections', 'unaware', 'true', 'feelings', 'said', 'sensibly', 'dignity', 'concern', 'others', 'regardless', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'feeling', 'also', 'true', 'gentlemen', 'story', 'real', 'gentlemen', 'played', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Hugh', 'Grant', '.Though', 'set', '200', 'years', 'ago', 'truly', 'film', 'timeless', 'value', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Firth/Ehle', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'particular', 'enjoy', 'period', 'productions', 'general', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'such', 'good', 'film', 'around', 'clean', 'warm-hearted', 'plenty', 'comic', 'relief', 'believe', 'appeal', 'broad', 'enough', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'looking', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'most', 'highly', 'look', 'forward', 'reading', 'companion', 'book', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Screenplay', 'Diaries', 'Emma', 'Thompson']",Sense & Sensibility

In a time where all entertainment has to be filtered through our modern lenses, and stories tampered with and mistreated because of a directors political views, it is amazing to have a movie which so transperantly reveals the intentions of the author.  And yet it is in no way made prudish for staying so close to the book, probably because the book isn't prudish either, only to some modern readers it appears so next to our rather lax forms of novel-writing.  Jane Austen was wonderful at being honest, straight-forward, and sensible in all of her books, not gushing all over the page like a jelly donut.  The story is shown equal respect in this movie, Emma Thompson in particular delivering a very impressive depiction of Eleanor, the only member of her family with any kind of sense, who is considered to be the less passionate of her sisters because she does not display her feelings with as little reserve and discretion as her younger sister does.The cinematography, the casting, the screen-play and soundtrack are all exemplary, and this is in short, the best of movies.",5,This takes many cakes,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1222,"['mind', 'most', 'well-done', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'certainly', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'also', 'book', 'have', 'personally', 'ever', 'seen', 'time', 'where', 'entertainment', 'be', 'filtered', 'modern', 'lenses', 'stories', 'tampered', 'mistreated', 'directors', 'political', 'views', 'amazing', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'transperantly', 'intentions', 'author', 'yet', 'way', 'made', 'prudish', 'staying', 'so', 'close', 'book', 'probably', 'book', ""n't"", 'prudish', 'either', 'only', 'modern', 'readers', 'so', 'next', 'rather', 'lax', 'forms', 'novel-writing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'wonderful', 'being', 'honest', 'straight-forward', 'sensible', 'books', 'not', 'gushing', 'page', 'jelly', 'donut', 'story', 'shown', 'equal', 'respect', 'movie', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'particular', 'delivering', 'very', 'impressive', 'depiction', 'Eleanor', 'only', 'member', 'family', 'kind', 'sense', 'who', 'considered', 'be', 'less', 'passionate', 'sisters', 'not', 'display', 'feelings', 'as', 'little', 'reserve', 'discretion', 'younger', 'sister', 'does.The', 'cinematography', 'casting', 'screen-play', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'exemplary', 'short', 'best', 'movies']",Sense & Sensibility

In the Empire period of England, Mrs. Dashwood (played by Gemma Jones) and her three daughters - Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois) - are left all but destitute upon the death of her wealthy husband, his having bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his son from a previous marriage. Because of the generosity of relatives, the Dashwoods are set up in a cottage in the country, where they meet three gentlemen: two young suitors with financial difficulties - Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) and John Willoughby (Greg Wise) - and a third, middle aged widower, Colonel Brandon (played by Alan Rickman), who owns the largest estate in the county.Thompson shines as Elinor, the sister with the most practicality (sense), and Winslet is perfect as Marianne, the sister with the most passion (sensibility). Their hearts and fortunes are up in the air, as Elinor withholds her feelings from Grant's fumbling and elusive Edward, whom she thinks is engaged to someone else; and Marianne throws her heart carelessly at the feet of Wise's dashing but inconstant Willoughby. Rickman's stable and less interesting Colonel Brandon bides his time, as he waits to see how circumstances will play out, meanwhile doing his best to be a good friend to the family. Emotions run high, and disappointments deep, but the payoff is pure jubilation. The ending is one of the most emotionally explosive I've ever experienced. If you love to cry, get ready.Among the delights of this film is the supporting cast.

Set against the backdrop of the lovely English countryside, this story has all the elements that make for fine costume drama: love, romance, betrayal, unrequited affection, and a bit of comedy.  Emma Thompson, who plays Elinor Dashwood, is the heroine of the film.  Kate Winslet plays her younger sister, Marianne Dashwood.  The youngest of the Dashwood sisters, 12-year old, Margaret, played by Emily Franciose, is both adorable and colorful. She brings comedy and a refreshing innocence to the film as does other eccentric characters like Mrs. Jennings and Sir John.The story begins with the death of their father, who, due to the legalities of the time, was not able to bequeath his estate to his daughters.  Consequently, the Dashwood girls and their mother are left penniless and must depend on the generosity of the legal heir to the fortune, John Dashwood, son from the father's previous marriage. The father makes John promise to provide for his step-mother and sisters, and John agrees. John's wife, Fanny, is introduced in the following scene, and the audience immediately discovers Fanny's comfortable ability to manipulate her husband and control every situation to her advantage.  She is self-serving, greedy and conniving throughout the film, and she has John wrapped completely around her finger.  She weaves a web of contrived, non-sensical explanations as to why John can not and should not keep his promise to his father to provide for his sisters and stepmother; John acquiesces; hence, the Dashwood girls are left with no means of support and no dowries. Alas, herein lies their dilemma as suitors will be reluctant to offer proposals of marriage to women in such dire straits. This fact becomes painfully evident when Marrianne falls deeply for the gallantly handsome, Willoughby, who by all accounts is a cad of the first order, albeit unbeknownst to Marianne. Set to inherit his aunt's vast estate, Willoughby is disinherited once his benefactress discovers his wanton ways. He must then choose whether to ""rank the demands of his heart above that of his pocketbook"".  He's, therefore, confronted with the decision to marry the impoverished Marianne or propose to the wealthy heiress, Miss Grey.  He opts for the latter but not before breaking Marianne's heart and leaving her with no explanation for his abrupt break with her.Marianne for much of the film pines away over Willoughby, (she really is quite pathetic), while the level-headed and longsuffering Elinor spends her time comforting her and pointing out to Marianne Willoughby's improprieties and the non-reality of one's happiness being totally dependent on one person. Elinor is ever so noble; she provides constant emotional support to Marianne and works assiduously to make ends meet for the family while accepting the possibility that her hope of uniting with the man she loves,the honorable Edward Ferrars, played by Hugh Grant, may never be realized.It is intriguing to watch how the contrasts between Elinor and Marianne interweave to form a delicate tapestry that brings balance to their existence or co-existence, as it were.  Marianne spends 90% of the movie prating about love, Shakespearean sonnets, and flowery affection, while the more reserved Elinor looks at life through the lens of practicality, always espousing the virtues of honor and duty.  Nevertheless, they are both very likable characters, and the viewer roots for them in their quests for love.  The costumes are completely authentic and the cinematography breathtaking.  It was beautifully and artfully shot, so if you like visually stunning period pictures with realistic plot lines and stellar performers, you won't find a better one than Sense and Sensibility.",5,One of the Best Period Films Made...A Must-Have,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3819,"['are', 'as', 'big', 'fan', 'period', 'films', 'am', 'must-have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'lovely', 'English', 'countryside', 'story', 'elements', 'make', 'fine', 'costume', 'drama', 'love', 'romance', 'betrayal', 'unrequited', 'affection', 'bit', 'comedy', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'Elinor', 'Dashwood', 'heroine', 'film', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'younger', 'sister', 'Marianne', 'Dashwood', 'youngest', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', '12-year', 'old', 'Margaret', 'played', 'Emily', 'Franciose', 'adorable', 'colorful', 'comedy', 'refreshing', 'innocence', 'film', 'other', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'Sir', 'John.The', 'story', 'death', 'father', 'who', 'due', 'legalities', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'bequeath', 'estate', 'daughters', 'Consequently', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'mother', 'are', 'left', 'penniless', 'must', 'depend', 'generosity', 'legal', 'heir', 'fortune', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'son', 'father', 'previous', 'marriage', 'father', 'John', 'promise', 'provide', 'step-mother', 'sisters', 'John', 'John', 'wife', 'Fanny', 'introduced', 'following', 'scene', 'audience', 'immediately', 'Fanny', 'comfortable', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'husband', 'control', 'situation', 'advantage', 'self-serving', 'greedy', 'conniving', 'film', 'John', 'wrapped', 'completely', 'finger', 'web', 'contrived', 'non-sensical', 'explanations', 'why', 'John', 'can', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'keep', 'promise', 'father', 'provide', 'sisters', 'stepmother', 'John', 'acquiesces', 'hence', 'Dashwood', 'girls', 'are', 'left', 'means', 'support', 'dowries', 'Alas', 'herein', 'dilemma', 'suitors', 'will', 'be', 'reluctant', 'offer', 'proposals', 'marriage', 'women', 'such', 'dire', 'straits', 'fact', 'painfully', 'evident', 'when', 'Marrianne', 'deeply', 'gallantly', 'handsome', 'Willoughby', 'who', 'accounts', 'cad', 'first', 'order', 'albeit', 'unbeknownst', 'Marianne', 'Set', 'inherit', 'aunt', 'vast', 'estate', 'Willoughby', 'disinherited', 'once', 'benefactress', 'wanton', 'ways', 'must', 'then', 'choose', 'rank', 'demands', 'heart', 'pocketbook', 'therefore', 'confronted', 'decision', 'marry', 'impoverished', 'Marianne', 'propose', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'Miss', 'Grey', 'latter', 'not', 'breaking', 'Marianne', 'heart', 'leaving', 'explanation', 'abrupt', 'break', 'her.Marianne', 'much', 'film', 'away', 'Willoughby', 'really', 'quite', 'pathetic', 'level-headed', 'longsuffering', 'Elinor', 'time', 'comforting', 'pointing', 'out', 'Marianne', 'Willoughby', 'improprieties', 'non-reality', 'one', 'happiness', 'being', 'totally', 'dependent', 'one', 'person', 'Elinor', 'ever', 'so', 'noble', 'constant', 'emotional', 'support', 'Marianne', 'assiduously', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'family', 'accepting', 'possibility', 'hope', 'uniting', 'man', 'honorable', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'realized.It', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'how', 'contrasts', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'interweave', 'form', 'delicate', 'tapestry', 'balance', 'existence', 'co-existence', 'were', 'Marianne', '90', '%', 'movie', 'prating', 'love', 'Shakespearean', 'sonnets', 'flowery', 'affection', 'more', 'reserved', 'Elinor', 'life', 'lens', 'practicality', 'always', 'espousing', 'virtues', 'honor', 'duty', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'viewer', 'roots', 'quests', 'love', 'costumes', 'are', 'completely', 'authentic', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'beautifully', 'artfully', 'shot', 'so', 'like', 'visually', 'stunning', 'period', 'pictures', 'realistic', 'plot', 'lines', 'stellar', 'performers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'one', 'Sense', 'Sensibility']",Sense & Sensibility

It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot[ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship to each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [a gorgeous English rose, Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters, who may be deemed minor roles, certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [played by pre-Severus Snape Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.",5,An evergreen classic!,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2572,"['have', 'watched', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'more', 'dozen', 'times', 'was', 'released', 'never', 'enthrall', 'everything', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'classic', 'movie', 'good', 'plot', '[', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'excellent', 'screenplay', ']', 'stellar', 'casting', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'costumes', 'lush', 'scenery', 'entrancing', 'English', 'countryside.The', 'story', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'heart', 'warm', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'two', 'sisters', 'relationship', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'interests', 'powerful', 'social', 'commentary', 'society', 'regency', 'England', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'will', 'appreciate', 'how', 'perceptive', 'observer', 'was', 'society', 'large', 'remarkable', 'capability', 'capture', 'powerful', 'human', 'emotions', 'paper.The', 'plot', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'movie', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'who', 'death', 'beloved', 'father', 'are', 'forced', 'move', '[', 'together', 'mother', 'younger', 'sister', ']', 'cottage', 'English', 'countryside', 'live', 'paltry', '500', 'pounds', 'year', '[', 'due', 'English', 'law', 'time', 'where', 'property', 'down', 'male', 'line', ']', 'Elinor', '[', 'played', 'excellently', 'talented', 'Emma', 'Thompson', ']', 'older', 'more', 'wise', '[', 'sensible', ']', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'let', 'emotions', 'rule', 'direct', 'contrast', 'younger', 'feisty', 'sister', 'Marianne', 'gorgeous', 'English', 'rose', 'Kate', 'Winslet', ']', 'who', 'passionate', 'outspoken', 'open', 'displaying', 'emotions.Elinor', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', '[', 'awkward', 'yet', 'deferential', 'handsome', 'Hugh', 'Grant', ']', 'who', 'youthful', 'indiscretion', 'unable', 'follow', 'attachment', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'other', 'hand', 'hard', 'dashing', 'rogue', 'Willoughby', '[', 'Greg', 'Wise', ']', 'ignoring', 'propriety', 'openly', 'displaying', 'affections.The', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'how', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'resolve', 'plight', 'story', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'deemed', 'minor', 'roles', 'certainly', 'depth', 'storytelling', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'retired', 'officer', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'deep', 'affection', 'Marianne', '[', 'played', 'pre-Severus', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', ']', 'callous', 'sis-in-law', 'Fanny', 'Dashwood', '[', 'Harriet', 'Waller', ']', 'scheming', 'Lucy', 'Steele', '[', 'Imogen', 'Stubbs', ']', 'numerous', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'secondary', 'plot', 'are', 'certainly', 'memorable.Taiwanese', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', '[', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Wedding', 'Banquet', 'fame', ']', 'certainly', 'mettle', 'here', 'flesh', 'out', 'amazing', 'performances', 'cast', 'gem', 'movie', 'true', 'classic']",Sense & Sensibility
