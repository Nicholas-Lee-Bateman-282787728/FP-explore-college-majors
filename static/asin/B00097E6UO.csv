902592,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,B00097E6UO,Allan Brain,"[1, 1]","This film has a lot of good points, including a sensational acting job by the young protagonist, who is utterly convincing as a worldly Resister in Nazi-occupied France in 1942, true to his family's heritage.  And there are some subtle tributes to film classics here and there--""Oliver Twist"" and ""Casablanca"" for example.  Some of the cinematography is brilliant.The basic conception--a young boy who has had to grow up in a world where he is in constant danger, may even have to sacrifice his life, and happens also to be a chess prodigy--is terrific and could have made a beautiful, unforgettable film.  Alas, there are too many illogical leaps.The kid is protected by an elite corps of Resistance fighters, so why is he not in more control of his situation? Why does his mother agree to an exchange that makes no sense--it's not like the kid is being held captive, as was suggested earlier in the film he would be if caught?  How does his estranged father instantly become a skilled guerilla warrior, when he had been an indolent playboy?The boy turns in an outstanding performance, but the others range from bad to really bad.  I could not tell if the film is dubbed, but even that would not explain some of the dialogue that sounds as if it's being read.  The character of the ""Professor"", who's trying to help the Nazis, is unclear. Is he just a nihilist?  His conduct suggests that, but why isn't he more complex?  Why does he ultimately give up?  Has he grown to love the boy, child of his former student?Finally, there is too little in the way of intrigue here.  At the end, I was waiting for a twist of some kind.  It's not by any means a bad or boring film, but it could have been so much better.",3,Great idea not too well executed,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1708,"['film', 'lot', 'good', 'points', 'including', 'sensational', 'acting', 'job', 'young', 'protagonist', 'who', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'worldly', 'Resister', 'Nazi-occupied', 'France', '1942', 'true', 'family', 'heritage', 'are', 'subtle', 'tributes', 'film', 'classics', 'here', 'there', 'Twist', 'Casablanca', 'example', 'cinematography', 'brilliant.The', 'basic', 'conception', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'constant', 'danger', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'also', 'be', 'chess', 'prodigy', 'terrific', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'beautiful', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'Alas', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'illogical', 'leaps.The', 'kid', 'protected', 'elite', 'corps', 'Resistance', 'fighters', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'more', 'control', 'situation', 'Why', 'mother', 'agree', 'exchange', 'sense', 'not', 'kid', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'was', 'suggested', 'earlier', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'caught', 'How', 'estranged', 'father', 'instantly', 'skilled', 'guerilla', 'warrior', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'indolent', 'playboy', 'boy', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'others', 'range', 'bad', 'really', 'bad', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'film', 'dubbed', 'even', 'would', 'not', 'explain', 'dialogue', 'being', 'read', 'character', 'Professor', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'Nazis', 'unclear', 'just', 'nihilist', 'conduct', 'why', ""n't"", 'more', 'complex', 'Why', 'ultimately', 'give', 'up', 'Has', 'love', 'boy', 'child', 'former', 'student', 'Finally', 'too', 'little', 'way', 'intrigue', 'here', 'end', 'was', 'waiting', 'twist', 'kind', 'not', 'bad', 'boring', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Entrusted

The young boy was a chess wiz and with his memory helped to keep his mother's crusade alive.  There is much violence in this movie based on the novel DADDY by Loup Durand, but then that was how life was in Germany and France in those tumultous years.It was interesting to see a movie made where that kind of thing really occurred in the 1940s.  It was much better than seeing top name American actors pretending.  These actors made it appear almost real.I can't say why I bought the DVD, could be the enigmatic pose of Thomas Sangster.

902597,A1TVILUSPJTOS3,B00097E6UO,Mr. B,"[1, 1]","Excellent period film.  I think that it captured the French Resistance and their war against the Nazi occupation and was very realistic about the price that they paid for it.  It did not sugarcoat the sacrifices that their families and they made.  The use of the young chess prodigy with the capacity to memorize ""50,000"" games as a means to explain his ability to memorize ""the list"" that so many died for made his accomplishment realistic.
