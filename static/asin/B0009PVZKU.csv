A glimpse into the lifestyles, trials and tribulations, of his times. I felt this was more than adequate in terms of acting and costumes. I would say that sets at times left something to be desired, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. If you like other Dickens period pieces, you will most likely like this as well.",4,Never go wrong with Dickens,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,424,"['Charles', 'Dickens', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'money', 'writings', 'exception', 'glimpse', 'lifestyles', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'terms', 'acting', 'costumes', 'would', 'say', 'sets', 'times', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'why', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'like', 'other', 'Dickens', 'period', 'pieces', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'like', 'as', 'well']",Hard Times

What you get is essentially something like a filmed version of a stage play. The cast is excellent. The production made incredibly creative use of a very mimimal budget. But if your expecting a first-class production with a huge budget, look elsewhere.Given the length of the work, the writers had to be very creative as far as how to fit the story together. The work has an almost dreamlike quality to it. Traditionalists will hate it but on every watching after the first I came to appreciate more what the people behind the production were trying to do.There are low budget productions were people don't try. And then there are low budget productions where those involved go all out and surpass what they should have been able to deliver. This is definately in the second catagory.Its not for everyone, but some will appreciate it.",5,strange but interesting,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,896,"['adaptation', 'novel', 'was', 'done', 'BBC', 'schools', 'What', 'get', 'essentially', 'something', 'filmed', 'version', 'stage', 'play', 'cast', 'excellent', 'production', 'made', 'incredibly', 'creative', 'use', 'very', 'mimimal', 'budget', 'expecting', 'first-class', 'production', 'huge', 'budget', 'look', 'elsewhere.Given', 'length', 'work', 'writers', 'had', 'be', 'very', 'creative', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'fit', 'story', 'together', 'work', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'Traditionalists', 'will', 'hate', 'watching', 'first', 'came', 'appreciate', 'more', 'what', 'people', 'production', 'were', 'trying', 'do.There', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'productions', 'were', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'then', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'productions', 'where', 'involved', 'go', 'out', 'surpass', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'deliver', 'definately', 'second', 'catagory.Its', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'appreciate']",Hard Times

Alan Bates is good as always, but some of the other actors are rather weak. But they don't have much of a script to work with, as the adaptation is poor. It is difficult to make Dickens work with such a short length; the characters and situations never seem to get fleshed out. The production values were poor as well. It makes you realize how much money and effort has gone into other Dickens adaptations.This story is prime for a remake -- much more than the version of Bleak House that came in the same set (which was quite good).",3,Some time spent in Cheapside,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,608,"['disc', 'came', 'BBC', 'Dickens', 'set', 'probably', 'weakest', 'entry', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'good', 'always', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'rather', 'weak', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'script', 'work', 'adaptation', 'poor', 'difficult', 'make', 'Dickens', 'work', 'short', 'length', 'characters', 'situations', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'fleshed', 'out', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'poor', 'as', 'well', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'effort', 'gone', 'other', 'Dickens', 'adaptations.This', 'story', 'prime', 'remake', 'much', 'more', 'version', 'Bleak', 'House', 'came', 'same', 'set', 'was', 'quite', 'good']",Hard Times
910670,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009PVZKU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","This is a 1994 BBC adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel &#8220;Hard Times.&#8221; While the film&#8217;s story (which I will not summarize here because I think you already know it) is faithful to that of the original book, the entire film has only about 100 minutes. This means that everything goes on too quickly, to the point of being incoherent. Old Stephen/Rachel story arc suffers most terribly, being badly truncated.Set in a fictitious city called &#8220;Coketown,&#8221; the story of &#8220;Hard Times&#8221; follows the life of the Gradgrinds and other characters living in this drab industrial town. Unfortunately, being a low-budget made-for-TV mini-series, &#8220;Hard Times&#8221; does not show us this dreary and monotonous Coketown very much, which is one of the original novel&#8217;s important features.So this adaptation of &#8220;Hard Times&#8221; goes a little bit like a stage production, with characters talking to each other in a dimly lit, confined space. With stars like Alan Bates (as Bounderby), Bob Peck (as Gradgrind) and Richard E. Grant (as Harthouse), acting is perfect. Unfortunately, writing leaves much to be desired. Where was Andrew Davies when we needed him?&#8220;Hard Times&#8221; is not exactly the most popular one among the Dickens works. This adaptation is not likely to change that.",3,Boring Charles Dickens ...
