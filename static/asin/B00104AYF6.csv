Both URBAN LEGEND and VALENTINE, especially the latter, were Argento-esque giallos that don't get the respect they should from fans. Hopefully, he'll get more respect with this fantasitically intense thriller with strong feminist themes. The opening shots are spot-on beautiful as they emphasize the emptiness of the Austrailian outback, and the naturalistic performances and dialog from the husband and wife leads establishes a sense of realism that puts the audience in the character's shoes. When the outback rednecks arrive on the scene (you can almost smell their vileness through the television), the movie gets claustrophobic and ugly - LIKE ""WRONG TURN"" OR ""WOLF CREEK"" feels!!. From the opening moments there's an underlying threat of violence that builds and builds, But don't go looking for a ton of gore, STORM WARNING plays it slow, but kicks into high gear during the final reel. In fact, Blanks plays most of his scenes slow, and their payoffs are far more gripping then had he cut loose with rapid editing and in-your-face effects. This is definitely one of the more effective direct-to-DVD horror efforts and deserves a look.

Seriously.And the kicker is, all of these great death scenes(3 of them in total)are carried out by a gorgeous french artist chick,with an acute mind for destruction.She was fantastic!!Brilliant!!A bringer of bloody, screaming vengeance.An engineer of pain!!An angel of death!!!Her actions seem all the more profound due to her boyfriend,Captain Useless,who does nothing but take a violent beating,blocking every single shot with his face.The tension takes a little while to get started,but trust me, it's worth the wait.The suspense starts mounting 15-20 minutes in,and ultimately ends in extreme, gorey, fantastically-visual, violence.For those of you who want to know the grisly details:(read on)- Death #1 involves a rudimentary torture device composed of fishing wire, hooks,& nails, followed by a hammer-smashed face.- Death #2 involves a razor-sharp, broken-bottle condom, with a side of being eaten alive by Fido from the stones up.- Death #3 involves a hovercraft.....Oh yeah, and a baby kangaroo gets killed to spare Captain Useless's unit.MORAL OF THE STORY:Don't walk into strange homes, in the middle of nowhere, asking for directions, chances are you won't need them once you do.",5,"Everything ""Calvaire"" & ""Sheitan"" should have been.",1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,1710,"['great', 'entry', 'Dimension', 'Extreme.It', 'typical', 'backwood-maniacs', 'variety', 'typical', 'story', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'lost', 'swamp', 'boating', 'one', 'afternoon', 'happen', 'farmhouse', 'inhabited', 'psychotic', 'family', 'consisting', 'father', '2', 'sons', '-but', 'one', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'major', 'difference', 'vengeance', 'scenes', 'end', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'visually', 'freakin', 'spectacular', 'one', 'will', 'positively', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'death', 'scenes', 'ever', 'horror', 'flick.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'Seriously.And', 'kicker', 'great', 'death', 'scenes', '3', 'total', 'are', 'carried', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'french', 'artist', 'chick', 'acute', 'mind', 'destruction.She', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Brilliant', 'bringer', 'bloody', 'screaming', 'vengeance.An', 'engineer', 'pain', 'angel', 'death', 'actions', 'seem', 'more', 'profound', 'due', 'boyfriend', 'Captain', 'Useless', 'who', 'nothing', 'take', 'violent', 'beating', 'blocking', 'single', 'shot', 'face.The', 'tension', 'little', 'get', 'started', 'wait.The', 'suspense', 'mounting', '15-20', 'minutes', 'ultimately', 'extreme', 'gorey', 'fantastically-visual', 'violence.For', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'grisly', 'details', 'read', 'Death', '1', 'rudimentary', 'torture', 'device', 'composed', 'fishing', 'wire', 'hooks', 'nails', 'followed', 'hammer-smashed', 'face.-', 'Death', '2', 'razor-sharp', 'broken-bottle', 'condom', 'side', 'being', 'eaten', 'alive', 'Fido', 'stones', 'up.-', 'Death', '3', 'hovercraft', '..Oh', 'yeah', 'baby', 'kangaroo', 'killed', 'spare', 'Captain', 'Useless', 'unit.MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'strange', 'homes', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'asking', 'directions', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'once', 'do']",N/A

1123813,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00104AYF6,Dave. K,"[25, 29]","Going into Storm Warning I had very low expectations; the backwoods killer concept is something that became popular back in the 60s and since 2003 has made a comeback. Also since 2003 we've seen several movies that were remakes of or inspired by 70s exploitation movies and while I do enjoy some of the newer ones they lack compared to those from previous decades. Back in previous eras a lot of these movies were made to show the audience a twisted world others had some social commentary and others simply for shock value.While that does apply today as well it seems now the majority are made simply to cash in on the success some of these films have had as of late. I didn't expect much also due to the fact the director was Jamie Blanks who did Urban Legend and Valentine, while neither were bad movies per se, they weren't very good either. So with Storm Warning I really wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say it was quite the surprise. While it's nothing ground-breaking and we have seen this movie done many times and dome better Storm Warning was overall a solid flick and Jamie Blanks seems to be showing some potential.Written by Everett De Roche who has done some cult classics apparently wrote the screenplay 30-years ago, but with the recent movies like this making it big he was finally able to produce it. The only major problem with his script is it offers nothing new and is like most of the other flicks out there right now like this. Even if produced 30-years ago Storm Warning wouldn't differ much from what was already out there, but would have felt a little more original. But the screenplay was overall well-done. The victims were alright; they aren't all that interesting and lack depth. But thankfully the action kicks in within the first 20-minutes or so, prior to that it wasn't boring, but it was getting there.But once the main characters come across the villains things pick up and the script picks up and is overall well written. With movies like this even if the main characters lack depth we can still sort of feel for them since something like this is a lot more possible than say a slasher movie. The villains though are mostly very well written for and come across as totally insane.Director Jamie Blanks really shows some great promise with Storm Warning the pacing is overall pretty good and he manages to keep things interesting early on even when the characters really don't have anything of importance to say. Once the plot kicks in though Blanks, is able to get the most out of every scene and makes a movie better than maybe it should have been. The only problem is he doesn't really have a style of his own. Urban Legend was the typical 90s slasher that follows the Scream formula and Valentine had a great and creepy opening act, but quickly becomes the typical slasher flick from that time. With Storm Warning Blanks may not offer anything different for this type of movie, but he does manage to create suspense and maintain it unlike his other two outings in the horror genre.I do believe Storm Warning was a step in the right direction for Jamie Blanks and while he may not go down as one of the great directors of the horror genre he can build a decent reputation. He just needs to find his own style. Every filmmaker is inspired by someone, but the great filmmakers are able to inject their own style into the movie. Even if Blanks does that I'm not saying he'll be great, but he can be a solid genre director. Like I said he showed promise with the opening act in Valentine, but here he is able to maintain the suspense and actually put together some solid scenes. Jamie Blanks is able to build suspense and tension and keep it going till the end of the movie. I really hope he can continue this he really did show a lot of potential and made a movie far better than the two he is known for.Storm Warning is one of those movies we've seen done and seen done better, but despite being a bit clich&eacute;d and predictable the movie actually works well. Sometimes all of that will doom a movie and it won't work, but other times despite clich&eacute;s and being predictable it can still work and Storm Warning is one of those movies that works well. The movie isn't as dark as it could have been. If you are looking for something extreme you won't really find it. The reason these movies worked so well in past eras was the filmmakers were willing to push the boundaries and go one step further.  When making a movie like this I feel you have to go far even if it borderlines bad taste. You have to reach to the darkest places of your mind and not be afraid to go there. If the viewer thinks the filmmaker is some twisted person we won't know where the movie will go next. Sadly Storm Warning doesn't quite do that, but again the movie really works well and works a lot better than maybe it should have.That's not to say what the characters go through is a walk in the park; put yourself in that situation it would be scary and it would be something that would haunt you for a while. But compared to other films like this it isn't as extreme what the characters go through. But again it's still rather dark. Maybe I've just seen too many of these movies and what was once twisted isn't as twisted now.The victims Pia played by Nadia Fares and Rob played by Robert Taylor were alright. I liked Pia and thought there was a lot of potential, but the character still works well and Fares gives an excellent performance. What I like about these movies is it poses a good what if? Put yourself in the position of the characters odds are you're gonna die, but first you will suffer. Can you reach down into that dark place and do what has to be done to survive? The character of Rob was slightly annoying and a little too weak. While every so often he does put up a fight he comes across as too weak. The turn in Pia from victim to not being the victim works well thanks to Nadia Fares. With a lesser actress the turn wouldn't have worked, but she really sells it. She goes from victim to heroine and it worked out great.The villains though were excellent and really elevate the movie. Jimmy played by David Lyons gives an excellent and creepy performance. David Lyons steals the show here for sure I really look forward to seeing more movies he's in. John Brumpton as Poppy was equally as good; he provides a very demented and creepy performance.The final act is where the violence and gore kicks in and it's quite brutal actually. I won't get into detail because I don't wanna spoil anything, but trust me when the revenge scenes start it's quite brutal and gory and the makers of Storm Warning really deliver. The wait is more than worth it when the action kicks in its excellent.Overall Storm Warning is a movie that is a lot better than it should have been. While there's nothing here you haven't seen before it works well and delivers on being a fun ride. Jamie Blanks crafts a movie with some solid suspense and tension. Again there's nothing here you haven't seen done before, but despite that Storm Warning works well and is quite the surprise.",4,Storm Warning is a movie that is a lot better than it should have

In the style of ""I Spit on Your Grave"", ""Savage Island"", ""Mother's Day"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and so many more ""Storm Warning"" follows a pretty standard formula of having a yuppie city couple getting lost (this time along the Austrailian coast), and running afoul of some local maniacs.The Good: Nadia Fares, the female star and main reason to rent this film. She is simply stunning to look at, and rises above the material, she becomes a character you really like and root for. She is fantastic, and hope she has a long career in film. Actually all of the acting is top notch. The special effects are effective when used, and the creepy setting is top notch.The Bad: The loser boyfriend who manages to make every mistake possible. This guy was just so annoyingly stupid, he must have taken survival lessons from the heroine of ""Rest Stop"". I don't think he could have put himself and his girlfriend in more jeopardy if he tried. The story, which can be tense at times, has been played out. We've seen this all before and can predict how it's going to end after about 20 minutes.The Ugly: The youngest brother lounging against his father on a couch while watching a beastiality flick!! This 20 second scene disturbed me more than anything I've seen on film in years. Effective I guess, but really disturbing.Of course the main attraction to this kind of film, is watching the civilized couple enact their revenge against their tormentors. ""Storm Warning"" does not disappoint at all. The bloody, cringe inducing final 30 minutes are worth the rental price alone.

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[4, 5]","""Storm Warning"" makes me realize why I sit through hours of exploitation garbage:  eventually you will find a movie of this genre that does work!Such was the case for director Jamie Blanks' ""Storm Warning.""  Mr. Blanks' first feature was ""Urban Legend,"" which--although a little creepy at times--never really rose above the ""dead teenager"" boiler plate movie.  In this feature, he takes his cast well above the cliche`.Set in the mangroves of Australia, the story is simple enough:  couple gets lost, are caught in a storm, and wind up at a backwoods house.  They go in hoping someone is there who can help.  While looking for a working phone, the husband goes out back to a shed and finds it LOADED with marijuana plants.  By this time, the baddies have returned home and that's when the tension really starts.  These three guys are so loathesome, you just want to constantly shower.  And not only are they dirty, they are about as demented as they come.  I'm not going to tell you anymore of the story because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  BUT, I will tell you this:  this is a REVENGE tale.  And ""revenge"" doesn't cover what happens!Director Jamie Blanks managed to make the majority of this movie very tense.  His style was very effective for this movie, and I felt a constant sense of uneasiness.  The entire cast was very good, especially Nadia Fare`s.  She is a great example of when push comes to shove, almost anyone will push back after a while.  I wish others would take notice:  if you have a plot--even the most BASIC of one--and introduce characters that a some depth, people are going to enjoy your movie!

1123819,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B00104AYF6,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[2, 3]","Storm Warning has allot going against it before you even put it in the DVD player.  First off, it's directed by the man that brought us Urban Legend and Valentine, both forgettable horror dreck to be sure.  Next, it was released under Dimension Extreme, the new DVD line that features horror movies deemed too... well, ""extreme"" for their regular label catalog and has(at least so far) been underwhelming to say the least(although with upcoming releases of Inside and Automaton Tranfusion, things are looking up).  Lastly, it features an uninspired title and generic cover that thankfully aren't signs of the quality of the actual film within.  The movie itself takes the oft-used(and yet always solid) formula of pitting good civilized people against a group of filthy backwood folk.  With the premise set, the question is posed, ""just how far will they go to survive?""  There really isn't much more to go into as far as the plot is concerned, the movie is incredibly tight and moves along nicely without any drags(a perfect 82 minute runtime).  Now what really sets this film apart from most of the other similiarly plotted direct-to-DVD releases(including Dimension Extremes first title Broken) is just how well the movie is put together.  This film doesn't feel like a low budget B movie(don't worry though, it is!) with it's surprisingly excellent direction(including some incredibly striking location shots) and musical score.  Likewise the entire cast shows up and delivers nicely, especially for this type of picture.  No doubt a very polished film, but let's be realistic here... the real star of the film is the gore!  It's a case of quality over quantity with only a few deaths delivered on screen, but boy are they gruesome and leave very little to the imagination(including a head bashing via hammer that was down right awe-inspiring!).  Who knew the director had this in him!?  If he had filled his previous efforts with this type of material he would probably already be a hero amongst the horror community... better late than never I suppose.  There is one major flaw that kept this from being an instant classic though(for me at least), and that's the inability to ever deliver any real scares or even a sense of dread throughout.  It just feels like the protagonists are going to get the upper hand on their captors from the very start.  That probably isn't entirely the movies fault(when you've watched the same plot as many times as I have...), yet the vitims here are rather tamely exploited at best(the guy is insulted for driving a Volvo and gets his knee busted, while the female is forced to kill a baby kangaroo and show her bare butt?) so the threat of their safety never seems that high.  The really great revenge films(i.e. Last House On The Left, I Spit On Your Grave, Mother's Day) have always provided a much more sinister give and take between victim and perpetrator before the tables are eventually turned.  Still though, an entertaining time that's worth a watch for the finale alone(that delivers the gruesome goods).  As an added bonus, if you detest men for any reason at all, you'll be happy to find that all of them here are either spineless worms or complete unmoralistic savages... women on the other hand, are smart, crafty, sexy heroes(sounds about right I guess)!",4,Mild exploitation film or agressive Women's liberation picture?

They dock the boat in a drainage area and go ashore to find help. The first house they come to belongs to a father and his two sons, a backwoods family who are growing massive amount of marijuana.The family comes home, questions the couple, and starts terrorizing them. They are then put in the shed, and seeing an opportunity to make a break for it, they do, but are caught and brought back. The guy gets banged up pretty good, and while the brothers attempt to have their way with his lady, the abusive father is woken up and joins the festivities. He smacks his sons around, and they go back in the house to drink and watch TV. While waiting for them to return, the chick turns into MacGyver and makes a booby trap out of fishing gear. Hearing a commotion, the younger brother investigates, and gets strung up and killed. A far-fetched scene, but you gotta love the head-bashing.Brother #1 comes out and takes the lady into the house to spend some quality time with Poppy, but the experience is less than pleasurable as he gets his member torn up by a contraption she inserted into herself. A second break for it is made, and is successful, as Poppy gets mangled by his own dog, and the son's hovercraft idea goes bad.Like the Wrong Turns, Hills Have Eyes, and Wolfcreek, this feature follows a similar formula about life in the bush, but does bring it's own twist. There are several scenes where I knew what would follow, but the effects were good and fairly pleasing to watch. For good measure, the director throws in a scene where the family watches barnyard porn, just to clarify how ""out there"" they are. I liked this movie, and any fan of backwoods horror should be pleased after watching. Sure, there are those ""no friggin way scenes,"" but overall, it's a good movie and definitely worth a second watch, unlike Wrong Turn 2, which deserves all the bashing I gave it plus more.

1123830,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00104AYF6,Mel Odom,"[26, 31]","STORM WARNING is one of the most brutal and savage thrillers you'll ever see.  The plot has been done about a million times, but the director and five actors manage to stand the story on its head and give it a few new spins that will make your hair stand up.The conceit of the movie is simple:  Pia (Nadia Fares) and Rob (Robert Taylor) are an upwardly mobile couple in Australia who go for a bit of sailing and end up lost in dangerous territory.  Pia is an artist and Rob is a lawyer, and neither of them are suited for what they encounter in this film.The screenplay was written over 30 years ago, but was thought too violent to produce, so it never got made till now.  After viewing the film, I have to agree about the violence.  This is mean, bitter stuff that will take a truly stouthearted viewer to watch.I also had to admit that the scenery is breathtaking.  The Australian setting is absolutely beautiful.  With the way the director slowly pulls the audience into the madness that's about to erupt, there's plenty of time to enjoy the local flora and fauna.  I have to admit that the pacing was, at times, almost too slow.  But once the story got up and running, you couldn't break away from the screen.While running from the storm and hoping to get their bearings, Pia and Rob reach a remote farmhouse.  After breaking in, they quickly discover that there is nothing normal about anyone that lives there.  Sex toys lay out in the open and pages ripped from skin magazines decorate the walls.  I knew at that point that only bad things could happen.Just minutes later, Rob discovers a huge amount of marijuana growing in the barn.  He realized at the same time I did that whoever lived there couldn't afford to let them escape.  And at that moment, the rough men they'd seen earlier arrived back at the house.This is when the movie really ratchets up.  I knew things were about to go south quickly, and from that moment until the end of the movie, I never took a relaxed breath.The menace grows slowly, almost like the tightening of a vise, and it won't let the viewer go.  I was mesmerized by what Pia and Rob had to deal with.  One of the worst parts was the fate of the joey, the baby kangaroo.  Although I could understand it, the idea of what took place is still stomach-wrenching.One of the worst aspects was the gradual build-up of the violence.  I totally understood how everything could escalate and be so bad.  And I understood the steps Pia and Rob had to take to ensure their safety.  Watching all of it was hard, and there was a definite mix of vindication and horror elicited on my part.The fishing lure trap in the barn is going to set the teeth of a lot of viewers on edge.  It was horribly hard to watch, and the subsequent beating later - complete with all the special effects - was difficult.STORM WARNING is recommended only for horror fans and suspense junkies that like blood and realistic effects.  The tense atmosphere is amazing, but the violence is drastic.  The director, Jamie Blanks (URBAN LEGEND), clearly knew what he wanted and got it.  Although a lot of the low-budget horror films end up with a grainy finish, STORM WARNING looks slick and pretty.  A top-notch thriller that draws blood.",4,Violent and Horrific,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3231,"['STORM', 'WARNING', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'savage', 'thrillers', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'director', 'five', 'actors', 'manage', 'stand', 'story', 'head', 'give', 'few', 'new', 'spins', 'will', 'make', 'hair', 'stand', 'up.The', 'conceit', 'movie', 'simple', 'Pia', 'Nadia', 'Fares', 'Rob', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'are', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'couple', 'Australia', 'who', 'go', 'bit', 'sailing', 'end', 'up', 'lost', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'Pia', 'artist', 'Rob', 'lawyer', 'are', 'suited', 'what', 'encounter', 'film.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'thought', 'too', 'violent', 'produce', 'never', 'got', 'made', 'till', 'now', 'viewing', 'film', 'have', 'agree', 'violence', 'mean', 'bitter', 'stuff', 'will', 'take', 'truly', 'stouthearted', 'viewer', 'watch.I', 'also', 'had', 'admit', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'Australian', 'setting', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'way', 'director', 'slowly', 'audience', 'madness', 'erupt', 'plenty', 'time', 'enjoy', 'local', 'flora', 'fauna', 'have', 'admit', 'pacing', 'was', 'times', 'almost', 'too', 'slow', 'once', 'story', 'got', 'up', 'running', 'could', ""n't"", 'break', 'away', 'screen.While', 'running', 'storm', 'hoping', 'get', 'bearings', 'Pia', 'Rob', 'reach', 'remote', 'farmhouse', 'breaking', 'quickly', 'discover', 'nothing', 'normal', 'anyone', 'there', 'Sex', 'lay', 'out', 'open', 'pages', 'ripped', 'skin', 'magazines', 'decorate', 'walls', 'knew', 'point', 'only', 'bad', 'things', 'could', 'happen.Just', 'minutes', 'later', 'Rob', 'huge', 'amount', 'marijuana', 'growing', 'barn', 'realized', 'same', 'time', 'did', 'whoever', 'lived', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'let', 'escape', 'moment', 'rough', 'men', ""'d"", 'seen', 'earlier', 'arrived', 'back', 'house.This', 'when', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'knew', 'things', 'were', 'about', 'go', 'south', 'quickly', 'moment', 'end', 'movie', 'never', 'took', 'relaxed', 'breath.The', 'menace', 'slowly', 'almost', 'tightening', 'vise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'viewer', 'go', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'what', 'Pia', 'Rob', 'had', 'deal', 'One', 'worst', 'parts', 'was', 'fate', 'joey', 'baby', 'kangaroo', 'could', 'understand', 'idea', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'still', 'stomach-wrenching.One', 'worst', 'aspects', 'was', 'gradual', 'build-up', 'violence', 'totally', 'understood', 'how', 'everything', 'could', 'escalate', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'understood', 'steps', 'Pia', 'Rob', 'had', 'take', 'ensure', 'safety', 'Watching', 'was', 'hard', 'there', 'was', 'definite', 'mix', 'vindication', 'horror', 'elicited', 'part.The', 'fishing', 'lure', 'trap', 'barn', 'going', 'set', 'teeth', 'lot', 'viewers', 'edge', 'was', 'horribly', 'hard', 'watch', 'subsequent', 'beating', 'later', 'complete', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'difficult.STORM', 'WARNING', 'recommended', 'only', 'horror', 'fans', 'suspense', 'junkies', 'blood', 'realistic', 'effects', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'amazing', 'violence', 'drastic', 'director', 'Jamie', 'Blanks', 'URBAN', 'LEGEND', 'clearly', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'got', 'lot', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'grainy', 'finish', 'STORM', 'WARNING', 'slick', 'pretty', 'top-notch', 'thriller', 'blood']",N/A

One of those Islands is called French Island, which is where this movies story takes place. A couple go out to sea in a small boat for a day of fishing, but find themselves lost and first sign of land they see is French island, however they have no idea they have drifted that far.Upon landing on French island, they seek out to find a farm or anything they can to maybe get a taxi or something back to where they came from. They find a farm and it seems no one is home, so they enter the house and look for a phone and find a few things they really shouldn't have seen. As the owners come home to find them, the movies plot starts to kick in as these 3 men have other ideas then to take the lost couple to any place safe.After that, the movie sucks you in and you should enjoy the plot of this couple trying to escape the clutches of these 3 nut cases out in the middle of nowhere, and there little dog too.I like to sometimes tell you if you liked such and such a movie, you might like this one, but the only one i can think of is one I didn't like actually, but if you did like ""Wolf Creek"" you may very well enjoy this one.

1123836,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00104AYF6,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 1]","I was seduced to watch this movie by two factors.  The first was the premise of an edgy revenge flick.  The second was some of the critical acclaim here in the Amazon forum.  I was able to get my talons on this exploitation flick for a good price.  However, after the movie was over I felt mildly let down.  This movie was directed by Jamie Blanks, who directed the original ""Urban Legend"".  I thought ""Urban Legend"" sucked, so in my very, very humble opinion promoting this movie with a conduit to ""Urban Legend"" did nothing for me.  For what it is worth, this movie is leap and bounds better than ""Urban Legend"".The premise of the film isn't very original at all, but that is okay.  I didn't watch this film for the ground breaking story.  Basically a couple rents a boat and ends up taking refugee on an island to avoid a very nasty storm.  Once on the island they discover a house and a greenhouse that is growing some ""wacky tobaccy"", marijuana.  The proprietors of this house are a father and his two sons.  Needless to say this is an extremely twisted family and they end up torturing this couple.  Then the couple must fight back.My qualms with this movie is the pace, it is dreadfully slow.  Going into this film I knew what to expect so the build up really didn't do much for me.  I don't mind waiting for things to develop, but I felt the development was incredibly sluggish.  As for the acting, it was pretty solid.  The good guys were one dimensional but believable.  The bad guys were disgusting and one dimensional.  For this type of movie, I am totally fine with these types of characters.The majority of the film the couple is locked up in a barn with myriad tools and what not at their disposal.  This wouldn't have been a problem if they were tied up or if one of the villains stayed with them.  However, leaving the couple alone with enough time to plan their revenge was lame.  It was as clich&eacute; as when a villain tells the hero his/her master plan before he/she kills them, but forgets the knot on the rope isn't tight enough.  As for how Nadia Far&egrave;s' character became MacGyver is still a conundrum to me.Notwithstanding, when the action happens it is gruesome and brutal.  I did find this rather gratifying and I think any horror/gore junkie would agree.  There is a scene with a kangaroo that is a bit amiss.  However, with only five characters and the long-winded pace of the film the action and horror wasn't enough to make this a master piece.I think that many horror fans should watch this movie, it has some great scenes and it is entertaining.  However, for people who are new to this genre I would suggest some other films before seeing this one. ""I Spit On Your Grave (Millennium Edition)"", ""While She Was Out"" and ""Eden Lake"" are an excellent place to start.  Overall, I am sure I will give this movie a spin again, who knows maybe I will like it more the second time.  I will have a blast making my girlfriend watching this.",3,Always check the forecast before you go boating.,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,2971,"['was', 'seduced', 'watch', 'movie', 'two', 'factors', 'first', 'was', 'premise', 'edgy', 'revenge', 'flick', 'second', 'was', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'here', 'Amazon', 'forum', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'talons', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'good', 'price', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'mildly', 'let', 'down', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Jamie', 'Blanks', 'who', 'directed', 'original', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'thought', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'sucked', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'humble', 'opinion', 'promoting', 'movie', 'conduit', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'did', 'nothing', 'what', 'worth', 'movie', 'leap', 'better', 'Urban', 'Legend', '.The', 'premise', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'original', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'ground', 'breaking', 'story', 'Basically', 'couple', 'boat', 'up', 'taking', 'refugee', 'island', 'avoid', 'very', 'nasty', 'storm', 'Once', 'island', 'discover', 'house', 'greenhouse', 'growing', 'wacky', 'tobaccy', 'marijuana', 'proprietors', 'house', 'are', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'Needless', 'say', 'extremely', 'twisted', 'family', 'end', 'up', 'torturing', 'couple', 'Then', 'couple', 'must', 'fight', 'back.My', 'qualms', 'movie', 'pace', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'Going', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'build', 'up', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'waiting', 'things', 'develop', 'felt', 'development', 'was', 'incredibly', 'sluggish', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'one', 'dimensional', 'believable', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'disgusting', 'one', 'dimensional', 'type', 'movie', 'am', 'totally', 'fine', 'types', 'characters.The', 'majority', 'film', 'couple', 'locked', 'up', 'barn', 'myriad', 'tools', 'what', 'not', 'disposal', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'were', 'tied', 'up', 'one', 'villains', 'stayed', 'However', 'leaving', 'couple', 'alone', 'enough', 'time', 'plan', 'revenge', 'was', 'lame', 'was', 'clich', 'eacute', 'when', 'villain', 'hero', 'his/her', 'master', 'plan', 'he/she', 'kills', 'knot', 'rope', ""n't"", 'tight', 'enough', 'how', 'Nadia', 'Far', 'egrave', 's', 'character', 'became', 'MacGyver', 'still', 'conundrum', 'me.Notwithstanding', 'when', 'action', 'gruesome', 'brutal', 'did', 'find', 'rather', 'gratifying', 'think', 'horror/gore', 'junkie', 'would', 'agree', 'scene', 'kangaroo', 'bit', 'amiss', 'However', 'only', 'five', 'characters', 'long-winded', 'pace', 'film', 'action', 'horror', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'master', 'piece.I', 'think', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'great', 'scenes', 'entertaining', 'However', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'genre', 'would', 'suggest', 'other', 'films', 'seeing', 'one', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Millennium', 'Edition', 'Was', 'Out', 'Eden', 'Lake', 'are', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', 'Overall', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'spin', 'again', 'who', 'maybe', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'making', 'girlfriend', 'watching']",N/A
