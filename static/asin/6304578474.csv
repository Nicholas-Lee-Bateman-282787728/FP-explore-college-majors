I actually remember my brother and I were the only ones in the theatre when I first saw it. I hadn't seen this in years and meh it was great. Though some parts are a tad bit over done or one might say corny, overall, this is a very funny movie. Danny Glover and Joe Pechshi do a great job. I love buddy movies. Their on-camera chemistry is awesome as my friend and I found out watching it and laughing uncontrollably almost. The scene where he is about to whack the guy who stole his car in the bathroom stall with a crow bar (which we played over and over again :-P) was hilarious.

I was excited because I like Danny Glover and Joe Pesci, and the thought about them doing a movie together intrigued me.As I sat there in the darkened theatre, I kept  wondering when the movie would start to get funny.  The preview looked  good... then I realized something - the preview was funny because it  managed to cram in all the good jokes into that one teeny preview.  After  awhile, I started wondering when the movie was going to be over.  I could  have watched the preview, saved eight bucks and been satisfied.I love  comedy, and I've seen my share of dorky comedies, but who hasn't?  Maybe I  was trying too hard to pull a laugh from this movie.  I think I laughed a  couple of times, but most of the jokes fell flat, and the plot was  painfully silly and predictable.My only regret was that Joe Pesci and  Danny Glover actually put their time and effort into doing &quot;Gone  Fishin'&quot;.  I don't know what possessed them to be in it.  They played  a pair of the most unrealistic, unbelievable, juvenille guys I've ever  seen.  I don't know any grown men who act like that.

428763,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6304578474,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[16, 19]","The film starts out in New Jersey when Joe and Gus are around ages 10 - 12 years fishing on the shore. They are talking about life, their plans for the future. Joe is smoking a cigar. Gus warns him it is not healthy. Joe flicks the cigar back, it lands in a long pipe, which starts a fire that leads to some factory. In the background, the lights of a nearby city go out one after the other. In the next scene, Joe's photo makes front page news, he is credited with having caused a ""blackout"" in at least 1/3 of the city.Next scene, Joe and Gus are adults, still best friends ... they live next door to each other, in almost identical houses. They have a family and are planning a ""fishing trip of a lifetime"" in the Florida Everglades. They drive down to Florida with their fishing boat behind them. They make a stop at a Florida cracker style restaurant and discuss their plans. A sophisticated British man, who it turns out is a con artist, overhears them. He plays them for suckers, while asking questions about fishing lures and flatters them for their knowledge and skills. After saying good-bye, he lifts the keys to their car and drives off. Joe and Gus look out the window and comment ... about someone having the same kind of car and fishing boat ... when it dawns on them what happened.The hilarity continues ... somehow they manage to save their fishing boat and rationalize they are lucky, things could always be worse, at least they have their boat. The guys meet a wealthy fisherman who mentions a yacht club in Florida where he plans to go fishing, he invites them to visit. They are picked up by two young women, whom they believe are impressed with their looks and male attributes ... but who quiz them about the con artist. The conman had duped the mother of one young lady, married her and took off with her savings - they are out for revenge. Joe and Gus manage to make it to a run-down fishing camp, which had been damaged by one of the hurricanes. They show the manager a ""discount"" coupon, which entitles them to live in a trailer. While watching ""America's Most Wanted"" they discover that the con artist, is notoriously famous, and there is a huge reward out for his capture ... their goal is to catch him. The guys manage to lose their boat ... they meet up with a yacht and boating salesman who talks them into a trial run on a sophisticated yacht - for easy monthly payments that will last ... nearly a lifetime. The guys go out in the water and ruin a yacht race and run the yacht literally into the ground. They drop off the keys to the salesman declining to buy it.Everywhere they go - whatever they touch - ends up literally smoking and burning. Things get very testy after they discover a map of where the con man left his stash. He knows they have the map and is hunting them. They do not realize the booty is guarded by Mad Maggie. This film is a hoot and worth watching if you love crazy antics. It is the unpredicatability of the twists in the plot which captivate the viewer. There is a song about fishing in the Everglades by Willie Nelson played as background music which adds extra spice to the wild and funny episodes.  The ending is surprisingly good when Willie Nelson rescues the guys. In the final scene after catching the con artist, Joe and Gus are inteviewed on TV. They are heros and collect the reward money. Initially, the film seems absurd but once the viewer gets into the spirit of it, it is quite funny and truly worth viewing.Erika Borsos (erikab93)",5,Nonstop Laughter!

Which proves that it was not a complete bomb. Yes it made less than half it's cost in revenue but then many a movies do that. It opened at the number 3 spot that week , and this movie is dumb for sure but that's what it's about, two dumb guys go fishin and create mischief.It's worth a watch when you are in the mood for watching dumb people do dumb things in improbably situations. unfortunately a stuntwoman died making this movie and it hurt the career of it's lead actors somewhat, but in the long run it's not a terrible movie.Joe pesci needs to get back into films though because  even in a silly comedy his presence adds something to it all.The dvd has a very good transfer and it has no dirt or artifacts on it. which you can't say about every movie from 97 on dvd. Even though dvd's were new that year.It's hard to realize but video stores were everywhere and 99% or more of their stock was vhs tapes then.

And a few things you probably can`t think of to top it all off.Normally you wouldn`t think of Danny Glover as a comedian, and while he`s not great at it he still turns in a decent comedic performance.

Gus and Joe are bumbling best friends who are going on a fishing trip in The Everglades down in Florida. When they stop to get a bite to eat, they have friendly conversation with a man, who soon steals their car. From then on, nothing goes right like tying the boat wrong, to lighting a gas station on fire, to blowing up a fancy hotel, and much more. The man who stole their car is a murderer and a theif named Dekker Massey. When they finally find their car, there is a bloody knife and a map inside. They try to find the treasure, only to be taken hostage by Dekker. Will Gus and Joe stop Dekker and save the day?
