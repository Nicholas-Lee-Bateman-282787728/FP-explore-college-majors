I ordered this for some variety, and I loved the idea of the bands.  I had to try it out.Let me tell you, the bands make a HUGE difference!  I got an excellent workout and am sure I'll be super sore tomorrow.  And this is just the BASIC dvd.  I can't imagine what his more advanced Bootcamp workouts are like.Regardless of your fitness level, give this a chance.  You can start without the bands and work your way up, making this DVD one you'll enjoy for quite a while without the worry of outgrowing it.",5,Yikes!,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,575,"[""'m"", 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'have', 'Billy', 'tough', 'tapes', 'library', 'ordered', 'variety', 'loved', 'idea', 'bands', 'had', 'try', 'out.Let', 'tell', 'bands', 'make', 'HUGE', 'difference', 'got', 'excellent', 'workout', 'am', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'super', 'sore', 'tomorrow', 'just', 'BASIC', 'dvd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'more', 'advanced', 'Bootcamp', 'workouts', 'are', 'like.Regardless', 'fitness', 'level', 'give', 'chance', 'can', 'start', 'bands', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'making', 'DVD', 'one', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'quite', 'while', 'worry', 'outgrowing']",Billy Blanks: Basic Training Bootcamp

Well, I could not even get through first 20 minutes and had to stop because the burn in the muscles was just unbearable. This is a very thorough workout. Here's what to expect.First of all, this workout builds endurance. If you reach a point where you get through the entire workout without interruptions then you are guaranteed to obtain an endurance of an athlete. I liked the bands, but they are usefull only for the upper body exercises. When Billy Blanks began the legs routine, the bands were just on my way and frankly did not add any resistance to the kicks. So feel free to stop using the bands once you begin the kicks. And please do not even try to get through the entire DVD if you are a beginner or only somewhat in shape. What good would it be if you have sore muscles and cannot even feel it because you died during that push-up routine? Take breaks and slowly build your endurance. Maybe after about a month you can try to be a hero and actually complete this workout and still be able to walk to a shower rather than have someone else get you there.",5,This IS a Bootcamp!!!,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1161,"['Folks', 'workout', 'joke', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'basic', 'training', 'stopping', 'Well', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'had', 'stop', 'burn', 'muscles', 'was', 'just', 'unbearable', 'very', 'thorough', 'workout', 'Here', 'what', 'expect.First', 'workout', 'endurance', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'get', 'entire', 'workout', 'interruptions', 'then', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'obtain', 'endurance', 'athlete', 'liked', 'bands', 'are', 'usefull', 'only', 'upper', 'body', 'exercises', 'When', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'began', 'legs', 'routine', 'bands', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'frankly', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'resistance', 'kicks', 'So', 'feel', 'free', 'stop', 'using', 'bands', 'once', 'begin', 'kicks', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'get', 'entire', 'DVD', 'are', 'beginner', 'only', 'somewhat', 'shape', 'What', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'sore', 'muscles', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'feel', 'died', 'push-up', 'routine', 'Take', 'breaks', 'slowly', 'build', 'endurance', 'Maybe', 'month', 'can', 'try', 'be', 'hero', 'actually', 'complete', 'workout', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'shower', 'rather', 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'get', 'there']",Billy Blanks: Basic Training Bootcamp
908133,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B0009MFQQM,Colleen M. Schneider,"[3, 3]","Well, first of all, I'd have to say, if you are reading the title and equate ""Basic"" as meaning easy, you'll probably want to put this one back.  It's ""Basic Training"", a whole different ballgame.  Basic in this context is a core set of moves.  Now one thing I did not realize when I borrowed this from the library was that it used ""Billy Bands"".  These are two rubber tubing bands that are very slender that make the moves tougher causing more resistance for your muscles. My resistance band was not long enough or the same type so I could not use bands.  Instead, for the arm sections I picked up 3 lb weights and used those.  I have done Billy's workouts before and I knew due to the number of repetitions how much weight I would want to carry to exhaust the muscle but not to compromise my form.  This worked well for the upper arm portion.  Of course it didn't do anything for adding resistance to the kicks, but I find trying to use bands for kicks tend to get a little challenging for me to keep the tubing where it should be so, I may not have used them for that anyway.The workout itself is good.  You do squats, pushups, overhead presses, jumping jacks, ""running"" in a plank position and Billy's usual brand of kicks and punches to add in a little more to your basic calisthenics workout. Before you get to the stretch at the end you do a killer ab segment.Aside from the bands, it is what I expected and it worked me out pretty hard.  I'm a daily exerciser, I normally do a variety of different exercise from Jillian Michaels, Yoga, Salsa, Pilates, kickboxing and felt that this dvd would be in the intermediate category.All and all a good workout-no surprise moves, if you have done basic training type videos before or Billy's workouts you have done the exercises and you know how to do the kicks that he does and the basic exercises.I would say this would be good with the bands, without the bands, or like I did, with a little bit of extra free weights if you are more advanced and do not have bands-that will add a bit more to your upper body training.",4,"It's basic training, but it ain't easy.....",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,2068,"['Well', 'first', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'are', 'reading', 'title', 'equate', 'Basic', 'meaning', 'easy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'put', 'one', 'back', 'Basic', 'Training', 'whole', 'different', 'ballgame', 'Basic', 'context', 'core', 'set', 'moves', 'Now', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'when', 'borrowed', 'library', 'was', 'used', 'Billy', 'Bands', 'are', 'two', 'rubber', 'tubing', 'bands', 'are', 'very', 'slender', 'make', 'moves', 'tougher', 'causing', 'more', 'resistance', 'muscles', 'resistance', 'band', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'same', 'type', 'could', 'not', 'use', 'bands', 'Instead', 'arm', 'sections', 'picked', 'up', '3', 'lb', 'weights', 'used', 'have', 'done', 'Billy', 'workouts', 'knew', 'due', 'number', 'repetitions', 'how', 'much', 'weight', 'would', 'want', 'carry', 'exhaust', 'muscle', 'not', 'compromise', 'form', 'worked', 'well', 'upper', 'arm', 'portion', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'adding', 'resistance', 'kicks', 'find', 'trying', 'use', 'bands', 'kicks', 'tend', 'get', 'little', 'challenging', 'keep', 'tubing', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'used', 'anyway.The', 'workout', 'good', 'do', 'squats', 'pushups', 'overhead', 'presses', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'running', 'plank', 'position', 'Billy', 'usual', 'brand', 'kicks', 'punches', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'basic', 'calisthenics', 'workout', 'get', 'stretch', 'end', 'do', 'killer', 'ab', 'segment.Aside', 'bands', 'what', 'expected', 'worked', 'out', 'pretty', 'hard', ""'m"", 'daily', 'exerciser', 'normally', 'do', 'variety', 'different', 'exercise', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Yoga', 'Salsa', 'Pilates', 'kickboxing', 'felt', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'intermediate', 'category.All', 'good', 'workout-no', 'surprise', 'moves', 'have', 'done', 'basic', 'training', 'type', 'videos', 'Billy', 'workouts', 'have', 'done', 'exercises', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'kicks', 'basic', 'exercises.I', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'bands', 'bands', 'did', 'little', 'bit', 'extra', 'free', 'weights', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'bands-that', 'will', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'upper', 'body', 'training']",Billy Blanks: Basic Training Bootcamp
908134,A28RO2TPZOKGCP,B0009MFQQM,"E. FitzPatrick ""Workout Addict""","[4, 4]","I really enjoyed this workout, but gave it 4 stars due to the inconsistency that Billy has in his videos.  For example, he does more reps on one side than the other, says we're only going to do 1 more rep and we end up doing 2 or 3 more, and is often off on his counting.

However, in this workout, Billy gets your heartrate up and then you use the bands, which even though it doesn't feel like it, actually burns more calories because you have constant resistance with the bands.I have been doing Billy's tapes for a long time. I am in very good shape and this workout really makes me work up a sweat. If you are a beginner and don't like high impact exercises then this is probably not for you.  Billy does alot of squats and pushups in this workout.I also like this workout because it is an entire body workout. Besides working your arms and legs, there is on the floor stomach workout that is very intense.  However, as Billy says, ""You have to give some to get some"" and this workout definitely makes you work. Also, the Basic Training workout has some exercises that I have never seen Billy do, and believe me, I have done ALOT of different Billy workouts. Even though I am not a beginner, I put this DVD in my rotation of Billy workouts because I like the variation.  If you are a beginner and are in good shape, then I would recommend this workout.

The Ab workout DVD is great, too. But this DVD has a fantastic ab workout as well.Billy's workout efficiently mixes stretching, yoga, karate, dance, and boxing to hit every muscle and give a good cardiovascular workout.It is a challenge to make it through the first three times. Beginners take it slow. Start with low kicks, so you don't hurt yourself. But make a commitment to let the entire 50 minutes run, if you finish all exercises or not. Use it every other day, just like in body building. Later you can alternate every day with the Ab workout, Cardio, or Flex workout.I suggest disregarding Billy's orders to 'go left or right', or 'use your left or right hand'. I find it's better to mirror Billy's movements. I did that the second workout and could follow much better.I use 3.5 pound wrist weights and found they work well, instead of using the bands for resistance. And keep water handy.
