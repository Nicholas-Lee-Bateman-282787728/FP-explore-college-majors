I usually don't watch Lifetime, but I was feeling gay today and I wanted to watch a Christmas movie. However, watching 12 Men Of Christmas was a mistake on my part. For a movie with Christmas in the title, it's not very Christmassy. Only about twenty minutes of the movie takes place at Christmas time. The rest of the movie takes place at other times of the year, such as New Years.Kristin Chenoweth stars as a perky blonde, so she must be playing herself. She wants 12 men to pose nekkid for some Christmas calender. And I must point out that most of the men are better looking than I and in better shape, which really bummed me out. But that's another story. Chenoweth and one of the calender boys fall in love, even though they previously couldn't stand each other. And there's your movie.It also must be pointed out that 12 Men Of Christmas is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but I only laughed about five times. Actually, they were more like one second giggles than laughs.

1382816,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0042DN4UO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I first heard about Kristin Chenoweth when I learned that my late and very much lamented NBC drama,Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series, had patterned one of its core characters (""Harriet Hayes"") after her. And Ms. Chenoweth is undeniably a talent, a walking triple threat. She's at home on stage, screen and television. She's got distinctive musical chops. She's a fine comedienne. She's an entertainment juggernaut standing at 4'11"". She's awfully cute.(From the Dept. of You Never Woulda Known But For Me Telling You: About six hours passed between the writing of that first paragraph and this one as I caved in to an irresistible urge to watch a few episodes of STUDIO 60. Aaron Sorkin's such a genius writer.)In 2009's made-for-television frolic, 12 MEN OF CHRISTMAS, E.J. Baxter is one of them obnoxious New Yorkers who has no right to be as likable as she is, except she's being played by Chenoweth who's at her chirrupy best. E.J. Baxter is a high-end, take-no-prisoners public relations executive, and she's just landed a lucrative account for her firm. So why then would she simultaneously quit her job and her fianc&eacute;?You'll find out why soon enough if you tune in. But E.J. turns the page and hightails it out of New York and into Montana, to a little town there called Kalispell (pop: 19,000). The mayor of Kalispell has offered her a one year contract to establish a pilot program to lure corporate retreats there. So there's E.J. in her Prada and her Gucci, scouting the wide open stretches of land that abut Kalispell - and by ""scouting"" it's meant that she drives around a lot and gets lost every time. Also, E.J. is not cool with the nearest Starbuck's being ten miles away. She misses the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple.All that stuff is just to provide splashes of color to the narrative, of course. The meat of the plot concerns E.J.'s finding out about and championing the local search and rescue squad. The S&R; squad is struggling to support itself, having barely eked out before on the strength of modest fundraisers like bake sales, raffles, and triathlons. If only there were someone with big city media savvy who can put her skills to good use to raise money, right?So it's another fish-out-of-water tale, except Chenoweth keeps it from going stale. We get the requisite big city prejudices from our central character warring with her innate decency. We get the rural folks who're so welcoming, E.J. remarks, ""You're all so friendly here. Do you all know each other or are you members of the same cult?"" Shame, E.J. (but I laughed and may've even snickered). There's that smug character, Will Albrecht (Josh Hopkins), and Will and E.J. seem to have taken an instant dislike to each other. So we know where that's going. And don't be surprised if you catch a whiff of Pride & Prejudice. See if you can make those connections. Gregarious Jan Lucas (Anna Chlumsky) - she's E.J.'s personal assistant in Kalispell - sort of fits the part of Jane Bennet, am I right? Yeah, I'm right.",4,"""Mr. December is no longer available.""",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,3030,"['first', 'heard', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'when', 'learned', 'late', 'very', 'much', 'lamented', 'NBC', 'drama', 'Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Complete', 'Series', 'had', 'patterned', 'one', 'core', 'characters', 'Harriet', 'Hayes', 'Ms.', 'Chenoweth', 'undeniably', 'talent', 'walking', 'triple', 'threat', 'home', 'stage', 'screen', 'television', 'got', 'distinctive', 'musical', 'chops', 'fine', 'comedienne', 'entertainment', 'juggernaut', 'standing', ""4'11"", 'awfully', 'cute', 'Dept', 'Never', 'Woulda', 'Known', 'Me', 'Telling', 'six', 'hours', 'passed', 'writing', 'first', 'paragraph', 'one', 'caved', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'STUDIO', '60', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'such', 'genius', 'writer', '2009', 'made-for-television', 'frolic', '12', 'MEN', 'OF', 'CHRISTMAS', 'E.J', 'Baxter', 'one', 'obnoxious', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'who', 'right', 'be', 'as', 'likable', 'being', 'played', 'Chenoweth', 'who', 'chirrupy', 'best', 'E.J', 'Baxter', 'high-end', 'take-no-prisoners', 'public', 'relations', 'executive', 'just', 'landed', 'lucrative', 'account', 'firm', 'So', 'why', 'then', 'would', 'simultaneously', 'quit', 'job', 'fianc', 'eacute', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'soon', 'enough', 'tune', 'E.J', 'page', 'hightails', 'New', 'York', 'Montana', 'little', 'town', 'there', 'called', 'Kalispell', 'pop', '19,000', 'mayor', 'Kalispell', 'offered', 'one', 'year', 'contract', 'establish', 'pilot', 'program', 'lure', 'corporate', 'retreats', 'there', 'E.J', 'Prada', 'Gucci', 'scouting', 'wide', 'open', 'stretches', 'land', 'Kalispell', 'scouting', 'meant', 'lot', 'lost', 'time', 'Also', 'E.J', 'not', 'cool', 'nearest', 'Starbuck', 'being', 'ten', 'miles', 'away', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'Big', 'Apple.All', 'stuff', 'just', 'provide', 'splashes', 'color', 'narrative', 'course', 'meat', 'plot', 'concerns', 'E.J', 'finding', 'out', 'championing', 'local', 'search', 'rescue', 'squad', 'S', 'R', 'squad', 'struggling', 'support', 'having', 'barely', 'eked', 'out', 'strength', 'modest', 'fundraisers', 'bake', 'sales', 'raffles', 'triathlons', 'only', 'were', 'someone', 'big', 'city', 'media', 'savvy', 'who', 'can', 'put', 'skills', 'good', 'use', 'raise', 'money', 'right', 'fish-out-of-water', 'tale', 'Chenoweth', 'going', 'stale', 'get', 'requisite', 'big', 'city', 'prejudices', 'central', 'character', 'warring', 'innate', 'decency', 'get', 'rural', 'folks', 'who', ""'re"", 'so', 'welcoming', 'E.J', 'remarks', ""'re"", 'so', 'friendly', 'here', 'Do', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'members', 'same', 'cult', 'Shame', 'E.J', 'laughed', 'may', ""'ve"", 'even', 'snickered', 'smug', 'character', 'Will', 'Albrecht', 'Josh', 'Hopkins', 'Will', 'E.J', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'instant', 'dislike', 'other', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'catch', 'whiff', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'See', 'can', 'make', 'connections', 'Gregarious', 'Jan', 'Lucas', 'Anna', 'Chlumsky', 'E.J', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Kalispell', 'sort', 'fits', 'part', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'am', 'right', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'right']",N/A
