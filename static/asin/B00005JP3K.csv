645321,A36DJJ4Q8WSWFM,B00005JP3K,--corinne--,"[172, 173]","I have vivid memories of this TV show about life in a small American town, post-World War II that aired on ABC from 1991-1993.I found myself humming Homefront's theme song, ""Accentuate the Positive"" the other day & had to look it up to see if it had been released yet on DVD.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.  Woe to Warner Bros. who has not yet released Homefront's two seasons on DVD; I'm sure they are losing money to people who aren't waiting for the release of the official version.I still recall the dance competition featured in the first season & the screwball romantic comedy of Jeff & Ginger's relationship.  The period-appropriate music, clothing, & dialogue were fun for a kid who didn't grow up in the 1940s to take in.  There was a strong ensemble of supporting characters in the Metcalf, Sloan, & Davis families & many admirers of Homefront still place its actors by their work on this show. Homefront has a strong fan base thirteen+ years after the show was cancelled, which says something about its appeal.  Voters overwhelmingly agree on the JumptheShark website that this was one series that never made the jump into creative decline or ridiculousness.This was a star-making hit for Kyle Chandler who later starred in the TV series Early Edition & can be seen this fall as a coach in the football TV series ""Friday Night Lights"".If you want to show Warner Bros. what kind of fan base Homefront still has, look for the petition on the HomefrontOnDVD website, where there are production stills, clips, & news articles about this series. After registering, fans can also vote on TVShowsonDVD for their favorite TV series to be released on DVD.It's a shame that all the seasons of Friends, Charlie's Angels & Dallas are on DVD, but nostalgic 1980s & 1990s TV shows like Homefront, China Beach, & Scarecrow & Mrs. King are overlooked with no announcement of a DVD release date in sight.

Kyle Chandler played the awkward younger son of Kahn's love interest.  Everyone in the cast is outstanding, and it was energetic, provocative, and endearing.

By chance I happened to find the complete series for sale on DVD at a web site called ""TVBOXSETS.COM."" I bought it, and I'm very happy to see a show that I thought might never come to DVD.The episodes haven't been digitally remastered, so the image isn't as sharp and crisp as, for example, the DVD issues of ""Dallas."" But it's all there - from episode one, through episode 42. Here's what the site says about the show:Things are starting to return to normal in the town of River Run, Ohio. World War II is finally over & the boys are coming home. However, the world around them is changing & life will never be the same again. Mike & Ruth Sloan have lost their son Mike Jr. in the war, but gained an Italian daughter-in-law, Gina who's pregnant. Gina is hiding the fact that she is Jewish & a survivor of the Holocaust. Abe & Gloria Davis, who work for the Sloan's, are hopeful that life will be better for African Americans now that so many Black veterans have distinguished themselves in the service. But their son Robert, A military hero, is embittered by the treatment he received in the army, does not think things will ever be any better. Everything appears to be rosy for Hank Metcalf though, as he is coming home to marry his sweetheart Sarah. Unbeknownst to him however is that Sarah is in love with someone else: His younger brother Jeff. Hank's sister Linda is angered that while women were treated as equals at work during the war, are now expected to take a backseat to the returning G.I.s, giving up the jobs they took to keep the country running so that the boys will not have any trouble getting work.The matriarch of the Metcalf family is the widowed Anne, who believes in old fashion values & tries to keep her children on the straight & narrow. Anne's own life beings to change when she meets Al Kanh, a Union organizer who is instantly attracted to her. G.I. Charlie Hailey promised to marry is girlfriend Ginger Szabo when he came home, but instead married Caroline while he was in England. He's convinced that Caroline wants the same things out of life he does, a large family full of kids & a middle class life. The conniving Caroline lies & tells Charlie that is her dream as well, but she never wants to have any children & loves money above all else. The second season brought war widow & baseball lover Judy Owen to town. Judy works as bartender & dispenses good advice about love to her customers, though she rarely follows it herself..What an amazing collection!All 42 Uncut Episodes 2 Seasons on 9 DVDSENJOY!",5,Now on DVD!
