Cobb,"[0, 0]","My 5-year-old son recently became enamored with hockey, and while I would never let him watch this film, I threw it on between studying for my Actuary exam and my job.  This was probably Sean William Scott's best performance because he actually had to move out of his typical doofus role.  He was sweet, endearing, and believable as a simple, straight-forward guy.  I was completely shocked.  The amount of blood was a bit much (it is a hockey film, however, so I should have expected that), but it ended well, if abruptly, but I liked that as well.  As others have stated in their reviews it starts off fast, keeps a fast pace, but at no point did my sense of disbelief get startled.  I ended the film wishing they would have kept going.  This is the kind of movie that could have followed the formula, but instead goes a bit Indie by leaving one with some questions, rather than lamely trying to tie everything up.  I liked that as well.This movie seemed to border on trying to be serious, but the language brought it back down to earth, but then Scott would make it serious again.  It seemed like it wanted to show a side of hockey that the average non-hockey fan doesn't understand.  It's possible I am reading more into this film in that respect, as I have no real idea how hockey works.  But, I enjoyed it and that's what mattered.I had very little expectations, as I expected Scott to be his typical doofus role and when he portrayed a simple, well-meaning guy with some rather strong moral qualities, as I said before, I was pleased.

The goon in question is a soft-spoken, goodhearted, not-too-bright guy named Doug (perfectly played by Seann William Scott) who is happy to have found his calling in life, even if that calling involves separating strangers from their teeth.We loved this film. And didn't expect to, even with the ""Superbad"" producers pedigree, etc etc. But it's a pretty funny movie, crass but not too crass, comedic but not a farce or a grossout film. Major kudos to writers Evan Goldberg and Jay Baruche: the plot elements are well balanced -- the violence is central to the story, but doesn't define the film. It's neither too gory nor too slapstick. Likewise, the character development draws you in, but never gets sappy. Like Doug's character, the film exists mostly on the surface, but has enough depth to feel believable and draw you in... Great modern comedy for hockey fanatics and non-fans alike. Recommended!

Goon is supposedly based on a true story, I'm a sucker for these types of movies but the vulgarity level is much above and beyond what was necessary. If you can weather the storm and sit through it then you can be treated to an awesome story about a bar bouncer (Mr. Glatt) having a night out to the local hockey game and has to actually protect his friends because one of the local hockey players after being antagonized comes up to attack them. Glatt goes to town on the hockey player in such a manner that everyone there at the game was amazed. The Halifax Highlanders team coach ends up seeing Glatts take down and offers him a chance to have a position on their team as the Goon. The Goon is the go to guy to knock heads on the other team's more than rowdy players that are keeping them from scoring. So Glatt gets his chance to do something more than knocking heads at the local bar, a chance to make a decent income and do something he loves. There are also some very choice pieces of music in the soundtrack, Giacomo Puccini - Turandot: Finale, and portions of Nessum Dorma, VALLEYS - Ordinary Dream, Rush - Working Man and a few other great tunes so that's another side treat.

1528688,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0079ZWTOO,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 6]","""Winning ugly"" is a popular sentiment among sports films, and I believe that's because - at heart - everybody roots for the underdog who has to pull himself up by the bootstraps after taking one on the chin, to rise above the adversity (much of it his own making) and go for it all.  We've seen the formula play out in such films as SLAP SHOT, BULL DURHAM, MEATBALLS, TIN CUP, CADDYSHACK, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS, and MAJOR LEAGUE, to name but a few.  It's an endearing set of circumstances that pits the losers against the winners, pushing them to become their very best and show the world what they're made of ... and GOON deserves its place on the list like any of those mentioned above.Doug Glatt (played by Seann William Scott) is a bit of a lovable dufus - not too bright, not too dumb.  The last adopted son to a family of doctors, he makes a living bouncing at the local beer joint, where he's honed his skills with his fists to perfection.  When a chance encounter knocking out an angry Bush League hockey star in the stands lands him a spot on the team, Glatt rises to the challenge, putting on a pair of skates and `thumping' his competition once he's called off the bench.  Eventually, he's moved up into the real farm leagues, where he's tasked with `watching the back' of Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), a `wunderkind' who's lost the right stuff.  Before it's all over, Glatt finds himself the heart and soul of the wayward teammates, pushing them closer toward a championship while putting himself on a collision course with the league's ranking thug, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber).As intimated, this is a story audiences have seen before, but it's delivered with so much aplomb and comic grace one can't help but be won over.  Scott - as the no-nonsense commoner Doug Glatt - is particular winning, whether he's swinging right hooks or constantly apologizing for having hurt his opponent afterward.  Of course, it doesn't hurt when you have Alison Pill as a no-nonsense hockey-groupie along for the ride; she meets Doug at the corner tap, of all places, and she's instantly swept off her feet by his awkward honesty and his little kid mentality.  When she tells Doug that he makes her want to stop sleeping around, you believe it.  Lastly, Schreiber makes the most of his small role here, turning in a pleasantly thuggish performance as hockey's nefarious last man standing, the guy too tough to retire and just dumb enough to hang around until he gets his hindquarters handed to him.  It's the perfect blend of sass and silliness by three talents at the top of their respective game in a film about the bloodiest game of all.Furthermore, there are a host of secondary performances that lift GOON to the level of an instant sports classic.  Kim Coates - the guy with a face that just screams `mean hockey player' - does an affable job as Coach Ronnie Hortense.  Richard Clarkin is absolutely hilarious as the team's captain, Gord Ogilvey; he delivers his own brand of inspirational team speeches littered with barbs about his ex-wife, his kids, and the fallibility of marriage.  Ricky Mabe does his best to steal every scene as the fresh-faced hockey player who wants everyone to like him a bit too much.  And there are more - so many more - that fill out an impressive roster, including a goalie who feels he can't get a fair shake and his two Russian teammates intent on destroying the man's psyche.Sadly, Baruchel - doing double duty here as actor and screenwriter (with Evan Goldberg) - should've been reined in by director Michael Dowse here.  Who knows?  Maybe because the story is part Baruchel's own project that the director figured the goofball antics had to be allowed, but, sadly, I thought it cheapened an otherwise wonderful picture.  And sure, everyone knows someone who behaves so grossly socially inept and constantly borderline offensive as Baruchel does here, but that doesn't mean it needs glorification up on the silver screen.  Half of what he does is perfectly fine; the other half?  Not so much.  It's schtick that's better left to solid B pictures or AMERICAN PIE direct-to-DVD knock-offs, not fuzzy and warm-hearted sports comedies worth their weight in Stanley Cups.GOON comes from Magnet Releasing and Myriad Pictures with some cooperation from Alliance Films.  There are a handful of other partners cited in the advertising - a list too long for me to repeat here, and the DVD release is handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  It looks and sounds awesome - there's some very clever camera work incorporated in the games and an incredible `smash/cam' type focus during some of the fights.  The special features are plentiful, including a `Power Play Mode' that boasts some interactive experience, deleted scenes, outtakes & bloopers (not as funny as I would've imagined with such a picture), and a few others, including a commentary by Dowse and Baruchel.  It's the full package - pun intended - and it can be celebrated again and again, as I'm guessing most audiences will like.  (I, myself, have already watched it three times.)HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  GOON is a sports delight - ""painfully funny"" as Collider reports, and full of equal parts wit, abuse, and heart - with the central performances a sight to behold, if not begrudge, they're so pitch perfect.  That, and it's all based on true events.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD Screener of GOON for the

Most surprising of all, this story is one that actually has heart (even as it makes you chuckle at its foolish jokes). It's also great to see Sean embracing a role that is modestly outside the comfort zone that he has been so thoroughly typecast within.

1528695,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0079ZWTOO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Maybe it's pathetic that I'm still not caught up in hockey, especially since the L.A. Kings won the Cup a year ago. What does it say about the sport's grip on cinema when you try to come up with a Top 5 Best Hockey Movie list and you can't keep THE MIGHTY DUCKS out of it? For what it's worth, my Top 5 list: 5)The Mighty Ducks; 4)Mystery, Alaska; 3) GOON; 2)The Rocket; 1)Slap Shot (25th Anniversary Special Edition).Most folks are partial toward the sexy offensive machine, the Gretzkys and the Howes and the Lemieuxes. And, sometimes, folks favor the underappreciated bully, the Terry O'Reillys and the Tiger Williams. GOON leans toward the latter. It celebrates the designated enforcer. But you never met a sweeter thug than Doug Glatt.GOON is a Canadian film, shot north of the border, where they play the hockey. But the film opens in Orangetown, Massachusetts, where good-natured bouncer Doug Blatt (Seann William Scott) is taking in a hockey game with his casually profane best pal, Pat Houlihan (Jay Baruchel). Pat hosts ""Hot Ice,"" a website/cable access show dedicated to hockey. And during that game attended by Doug and Pat, when an enraged player ventures off the ice only to get his a-- whupped good by Doug, ""Hot Ice"" presents a venue to celebrate Doug's brawling prowess. And when the coach of the Orangetown Assassins calls in to offer a tryout for Doug, well, there goes Doug dreaming big, hoping to finally earn his parents' approbation. It's been tough going, what with Doug coming from a Jewish family of doctors. He probably shouldn't have shown up for his tryout wearing figure skating boots.Early assessment says that Doug can't skate, can't play hockey, is like a meandering lump on ice. But the coach sees potential in Doug. He likes his bruising style. In hockey, one can never have enough of them goons safeguarding their teammates' backs. Doug is told: ""You're like the Hebrew Dolph Lundgren!"" and also ""You've been touched by the fist of God."" So this is Doug getting re1igion.As Doug and his team make noise in the league rankings, as a groundswell of opinions manifests touting him as the next great enforcer in hockey, it's inevitable that people start dreaming of matching our rising star against the league's most dreaded bully Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber).I think this is my favorite movie with Seann William Scott. GOON surprises you with its big heart, and the propers must be extended to Baruchel because he wrote the thing and to Seann William Scott because he brought to the screen a character that could've easily veered off course but instead became instantly likable and relatable. Doug Blatt is such a sweet simpleton. There's not one moment where you're not on his side. In a way, his innocence and good heart allow him license to pound the living crap out of people.GOON is also surprising in that it's a tender love story about an idiot and a s1ut. Alison Pill (who at the time was engaged to Baruchel) is very good as Doug's conflicted romantic interest, Eva. She informs him: ""You make me want to stop sleeping with other guys."" So, no, this isn't Jane Austen's GOON. But you must trust me when I say that it's a tender love story. This is Doug falling in love.Baruchel could've written Ross Rhea, Doug's nemesis, as a cardboard villain. Instead he makes Schreiber's character a three-dimensional character. Ross Rhea is written as a sympathetic villain, an aging warrior teetering on hanging it all up but longing to go out in style. In Doug, he sees his perfect ending. He respects Doug but should they meet on the ice, he'll be more than happy to lay him out. When he finally tangles with Doug, yeah, you root against him. But you're not hating on him. You understand him.GOON's best funny bits don't come so much from Doug's sketchy teammates, and certainly not from the wiggy goalie who cautions and then asks Doug during their first meet: ""Two words, man: Stay away from my Percocets, and do you have any Percocets?"" No, the humor comes from the juxtaposing of Doug's simple nature against those more sophisticated (read: cynical, cruel) than him. Amazingly, I never felt that the film was making fun of Doug for being dim-witted. I never thought he was a loser. Maybe because Doug, in his way, is such a strong person. He's secure in what he knows and what he does and what he believes in. He stands his ground. He never gives up.For some folks GOON won't be their cup of tea. There's plenty of face-smashing, jersey-tugging, fist-flurrying bits that go on. But if you're a fan of hockey and a fan of the sports underdog, then this should go down like a cup of Lipton or Oolong or Masala Chai. Hockey and fighting and tea, yeah, that's how we roll.The film's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary by director Michael Dowse and co-writer/actor Jay Baruchel- ""Power Play Mode"" - Behind the Scenes

Anyway, I decided to give it a watch online one day recently and I was actually kind of surprised by it...it was actually a pretty entertaining movie.  There were laughs and serious moments both in it, and even a touch of romance...and the actors all did a great job in it.  And actually based off a true story, I would never have guessed!  They actually show real footage of the guy Sean William Scott is suppose to portray during the credits, his obnoxious friend behind that camera that Jay Baruchel portrays.To be completely honest, I feel that this is one of Sean William Scott's better roles in a while.  Jay Baruchel put on a good performance of his obnoxious friend as well, and Liev Schriber was as good as ever in it as well.  Alison Pill, the actress that play's the love interest in the movie, was really good too and looked really familiar to me, but I couldn't place it.  I searched her name on Amazon and most of what I came across I'd never seen or never even heard of, though most of them seemed to be good...but the one thing I did come across before it clicked was Scott Pilgrim vs The World.  LoL, good stuff!The only one warning I will give about this movie is that there is some excessive vulgar & sometimes crude language throughout it...perhaps even a little overboard in a couple of parts I thought.  However, in the end, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film overall.  Some of the language use was, I must admit, actually well used in some cases and made me laugh.  I will say though that if you're sensitive to such heavy language & such, you should probalby avoid this movie, but if you're like me and can tollerate it, so long as the overall movie is good, then definitely give this movie a watch friends...it was actually pretty entertaining.",4,A Surprising Movie!,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,2019,"['do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'having', 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'sort', 'silly', 'little', 'straight', 'DVD', 'comedy', 'let', 'face', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'take', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'seriously', 'sometimes', 'Anyway', 'decided', 'give', 'watch', 'online', 'one', 'day', 'recently', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'surprised', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'were', 'laughs', 'serious', 'moments', 'even', 'touch', 'romance', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'actually', 'based', 'off', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'actually', 'show', 'real', 'footage', 'guy', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'suppose', 'portray', 'credits', 'obnoxious', 'friend', 'camera', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'portrays.To', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'feel', 'one', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'better', 'roles', 'while', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'put', 'good', 'performance', 'obnoxious', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'Liev', 'Schriber', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'as', 'well', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'actress', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'looked', 'really', 'familiar', 'could', ""n't"", 'place', 'searched', 'name', 'Amazon', 'most', 'what', 'came', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'most', 'seemed', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'come', 'clicked', 'was', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'LoL', 'good', 'stuff', 'only', 'one', 'warning', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'excessive', 'vulgar', 'sometimes', 'crude', 'language', 'perhaps', 'even', 'little', 'overboard', 'couple', 'parts', 'thought', 'However', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'overall', 'language', 'use', 'was', 'must', 'admit', 'actually', 'well', 'used', 'cases', 'made', 'will', 'say', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'such', 'heavy', 'language', 'such', 'should', 'probalby', 'avoid', 'movie', ""'re"", 'can', 'tollerate', 'so', 'long', 'overall', 'movie', 'good', 'then', 'definitely', 'give', 'movie', 'watch', 'friends', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining']",N/A

If any of the above is questionable, read on...Goon tells a sort of reverse Happy Gilmore, where a fairly stupid, hockey-loving guy named Doug (Sean William Scott) falls into the perfect storm of circumstance and luck.  The result lands him with minor league hockey teams needing an enforcer, a goon, who dishes out assists with a left fist and goals with a right fist.  Along the way his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) assumes the role of Stifler, unleashing a series of F-bombs so thorough I now consider his lines in the screenplay to be the Bible of Swearing.  When his career and life begin to slowly coalesce, matters are complicated by a disapproving father (Eugene Levy), a prima-donna teammate named Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) with a fear of contact, a slut named Eva (Alison Pill) who is hockey's equivalent to a baseball player's ""slump-buster,"" and an aging goon, Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (Live Shreiber), with a reputation as the baddest man to lace up skates.It doesn't quite have the influence of Slapshot, and it's nowhere near the heartfelt dedication to hockey's beauty seen in Mystery, Alaska, but it's pretty spot-on for the target audience.  The strength of the movie is its premise, not its performers.  Sean William Scott is funny as always; although, his Forrest Gump on skates impersonation wanes during the more challenging scenes.  Baruchel is funny at first, but by the 253rd time he screamed a profanity it made me yearn for Carlin's ""List of Bad Words""-routine.  Only Shreiber really impresses.  He stole the movie in my opinion.  It reminded me of how little screen-time Danny Trejo got in Grindhouse, yet fans clamored for a movie about the actual Machete.While the balance of the film was about hockey and balance, the run-time was short enough that it would have been a much better movie if the focus was steered even further towards hockey, and away from the nearly impossible to tolerate love-interest angle.  The next time Baruchel gets involved with the production side of film-making, it'd be nice if he didn't force Allison Pill into the roll as the hot chick, because she's not.  At best she's a backup drummer, like in Scott Pilgrim.  Overall, however, it's great insight into the difficulties of minor-league hockey, a microscope on the often underappreciated goons of the hockey world, a movie about the often overlooked sport of hockey, and a reason for Liev Shreiber to flex his acting muscles.Probably sold out theaters in Canada.",4,"Hockey violence and profanity, we're off to a good start",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,2679,"['love', 'triplet', 'goons', 'Slapshot', 'over-the-top', 'vulgarity', 'Stifler', 'American', 'Pie', 'franchise', 'are', 'hockey', 'fan', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'buy', 'movie', 'immediately', 'above', 'questionable', 'read', 'Goon', 'sort', 'reverse', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'where', 'fairly', 'stupid', 'hockey-loving', 'guy', 'named', 'Doug', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'perfect', 'storm', 'circumstance', 'luck', 'result', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'teams', 'needing', 'enforcer', 'goon', 'who', 'out', 'assists', 'left', 'fist', 'goals', 'right', 'fist', 'way', 'best', 'friend', 'Pat', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'role', 'Stifler', 'unleashing', 'series', 'F-bombs', 'thorough', 'now', 'consider', 'lines', 'screenplay', 'be', 'Bible', 'Swearing', 'When', 'career', 'life', 'begin', 'slowly', 'coalesce', 'matters', 'are', 'complicated', 'disapproving', 'father', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'prima-donna', 'teammate', 'named', 'Xavier', 'Laflamme', 'Marc-Andre', 'Grondin', 'fear', 'contact', 'slut', 'named', 'Eva', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'who', 'hockey', 'equivalent', 'baseball', 'player', 'slump-buster', 'aging', 'goon', 'Ross', 'Boss', 'Rhea', 'Live', 'Shreiber', 'reputation', 'baddest', 'man', 'lace', 'up', 'skates.It', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'influence', 'Slapshot', 'nowhere', 'heartfelt', 'dedication', 'hockey', 'beauty', 'seen', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'pretty', 'spot-on', 'target', 'audience', 'strength', 'movie', 'premise', 'not', 'performers', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'funny', 'always', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'skates', 'impersonation', 'wanes', 'more', 'challenging', 'scenes', 'Baruchel', 'funny', 'first', '253rd', 'time', 'screamed', 'profanity', 'made', 'yearn', 'Carlin', 'List', 'Bad', 'Words', '-routine', 'Only', 'Shreiber', 'really', 'stole', 'movie', 'opinion', 'reminded', 'how', 'little', 'screen-time', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'got', 'Grindhouse', 'yet', 'fans', 'clamored', 'movie', 'actual', 'Machete.While', 'balance', 'film', 'was', 'hockey', 'balance', 'run-time', 'was', 'short', 'enough', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'focus', 'was', 'steered', 'even', 'further', 'towards', 'hockey', 'away', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'tolerate', 'love-interest', 'angle', 'next', 'time', 'Baruchel', 'involved', 'production', 'side', 'film-making', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'Allison', 'Pill', 'roll', 'hot', 'chick', 'not', 'best', 'backup', 'drummer', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Overall', 'however', 'great', 'insight', 'difficulties', 'minor-league', 'hockey', 'microscope', 'often', 'underappreciated', 'goons', 'hockey', 'world', 'movie', 'often', 'overlooked', 'sport', 'hockey', 'reason', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles.Probably', 'sold', 'out', 'theaters', 'Canada']",N/A

Swanson,"[4, 4]","4.5 starsI knew nothing of this before seeing it at the library, but having grown up playing a lot of hockey I will watch any of the very few hockey movies ever made. Slap Shot is of course the classic, but I've got to say I like this even more, as it really feels like Canada in so many ways, and hockey is to Canada what baseball, football and basketball are to the US, combined.There are many absolutely hilarious moments, especially if you really love hockey and appreciate the absurdity of ice fighting. I had to hit pause maybe a dozen times so I could finish laughing. Goon is so Canadian and so precisely hockeyish; Hollywood will NEVER come this close to what hockey really is. And Scott is so good it's hard to believe; he always seemed like a basic jokester before, but he performs on another level here and makes his character truly come alive. Everybody is great in Goon except Baruchel, who is too over the top even for a satire like this. But he did co-write it, so slack shall be cut. Scott makes up for it with an incredibly earnest performance; honest to god, it's dang near Oscar-worthy in its low key brilliance. Liev Screiber also turns in a convincing and pleasantly low key take on the aging goon whom Scott must of course battle. That lack of constant over the top is why Goon is a little funnier than Slap Shot, all told. It's less a farce and more of a straight up comedy-drama.The endless asides and subtle moments make Goon work, and the not-subtle-at-all violence might be the main thing that turns some folks off. But as someone who grew up watching the broad Street Bullies and laughing every time Dave the Hammer got on the ice, I found it all accurate. I was a good young player, captain of the team, all star, blah blah, but despite being big for my age I soon found after some seriously crushing hits in the corners that big is not huge, and only the huge tend to make it, and that's kind of what Goon points out: this is a game for large, violent men. Not many Muggsy Bogues in the NHL! If you like hockey you get that, and won't mind the fights here.If you can't stand blood, avoid this film. And that goes double for f-bombs. But that is exactly how hockey players talk. I grew up amongst them and as one of them and still know some, and they make every other sport's players seem mild-mannered in comparison. It's a fast hard sport and there's nothing PC about it.What's truly unique about Goon is that all that blood and fighting comes with a surprisingly touching love story that actually works, mainly due to Scott's excellent performance and his chemistry with Pill. It's a lot like Rocky in that respect, but honestly I think Scott is better than Stallone. Sacrilege! Watch and see if you don't agree.Lots of good extras and interviews make this a nice disc, and if Goon doesn't end up being hailed in a few years as the best hockey film yet made, Slap Shot included, then I'll eat my shinpads.It's a pucking good film, but it ain't PC, so if you can't stand a lot of pucking around, then get the puck away from Goon.

Goon is so appealing because its funny, the screenwriter has really done his homework, and who doesnt love Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, our everyman enforcer/hero? Admittedly Im a bit of a hockey nut. I'll fly 2500 miles, watch Pittsburgh play two home games and fly 2500 miles back home. You could argue some of the bits in the movie are a bit over the top, but this is the movies, and I was completely entertained and inspired. I loved the use of Puccini's Nessun Dorma in the final scenes of the movie.Even if you dont like fighting in hockey, the screenplay and direction was thrilling, and Seann William Scott is a charmer. The casting of Marc-Andr&eacute; Grondin as Xavier LaFlamme was brilliant, the NHL has so many talented French Canadian players. I also loved Liev Schreiber's Ross Rhea, the enforcer on his last run. He made the finale, which obviously reminded me of Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed.The best part of the movie is Doug Glatt explaining how much he would do for his team.

1528721,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0079ZWTOO,MadMacs,"[8, 12]","Right up there with the &uuml;ber classic 'Slap Shot'. In some respects - better. Not every respect, but definitely a slice of its own pie, so to speak.Notably, Amazon doesn't allow any quote from this movie. Nothing. And that's only part of what makes this so bleeping enjoyable. The other part is, surprisingly, there's an actual film in play here. A sincere tale about a quiet, unassuming and simple man: Doug Glatt, played by Seann William Scott, recruited to be a hockey team's ""goon"", the team enforcer.While not a direct fan of the game, over the years I've read several articles in SI and other sports pubs about enforcers - former NHL player Doug 'The Hammer' Smith, whose life this film is based on, included. So I'm familiar enough with the term and the dirty, sometimes unappreciated, job of being the guy who goes out there to protect the shotmakers. Very similar to football where the quarterback and other offensive players receive the adulation and admiration, while the troglodytes who make the critical blocks are all too often forgotten.And despite the hilarious raunchy context of this movie, and in all seriousness, there's a depth to this production well beyond the raw profanity and unchecked machismo. So much more than the plain boilerplate loser-makes-good platitude on celluloid.Dougie finds himself lost - a bar bouncer and general maintenance guy without any real future. Not for lack of trying, but because he's a simple guy. We all know dudes like this, a heart of gold surrounded by a block of meat. The man may not become a doctor or debate middle east politics, but he's got your back when the chips are down. The one thing Doug is good at is taking and giving a beating, more the latter than the former. Interestingly, he takes no pleasure or pride in the brutality of fisticuffs, but understands it as a fish understands water - it just is. No more, no less. There's an echo ofDet. Bud Whitein his performance that I really, truly enjoyed.A night hanging out with his best bud at a hockey game forever alters his life path - one that ultimately leads to the biggest throwdown Doug could have ever imagined.Have only a passing familiarity with Seann, but I know he's worked hard over the past decade to shed the goofy stoner image. Kinda thought his career would've have done better since his enjoyable characterization in 'The Rundown', but I'm pleased that he's taking these kinds of chances. Definitely a step in the right direction. Displaying a maturation and mentality of a seasoned actor - avoiding the shallow movie star acclaim sadly sought by so many.In this production he showcases an ability that few actors actually possess - transformation. There are many movie stars that are essentially the same person in a different setting. We all know them, and they're paid handsomely for being those stars. But the actors? Those are fewer and much less heralded. And fewer still those that combine both elements.Based on this project - I honestly hope Seann gets the roles his ability deserves. An actor easily equal that of Jeremy Renner insofar as talent and ability are judged.Finally, props to Allison Pill as Eva, fouled-mouth self-described slut who falls in love for the first time. Enjoy it when the good girls go bad - only to go good again. And of course Liev Schreiber, in yet another incredibly subtle performance as the former top goon retiring after his final game. It's hard to imagine anyone stealing the show with such limited screen time, but he comes awfully close. You almost wish for a companion film about Ross 'The Boss' Rhea - his execution is that good.Movie Note: Don't quit the film too early. When the credits roll viewers are treated to the real-life Dougie and his bud's 'best of' compilation. Funny stuff.Personal Note: Am a monster fan of Liev Schreiber and this only validates, for me, that he's one of the most versatile performers out there today. Wish some producer could see the potential for an independent and separate 'Mr. Clark' film.

That's a shame, because this is really a gem on multiple levels.  The obvious comparison is to Slap Shot from 1977, in that both movies are comedies about minor-league hockey teams and focus on the violence in the sport.  The difference is that in Slap Shot, the &#34;goons&#34; were the bad guys, and here, the goon is the good guy.  His job is to protect the players on his team from the goons on the other teams, who want to physically take out the best players on his team. The &#34;goon&#34;, Doug &#34;the Thug&#34; Glatt (played perfectly by Seann William Scott), is a not-very-bright guy who nonetheless has a heart of gold and wants to do something worthwhile with his life.  He stumbles on his career when he goes to a hockey game and punches out a player who is trying to beat up his best friend (the incredibly obnoxious and foul-mouthed Pat, played hilariously by Jay Baruchel).  The team owner is impressed and gets him to try out for the team, and after beating up half of the players, he's in.  We see him start off as just a goon and eventually become the heart and soul of his team after showing time and again that he's willing to do anything to help the team get ahead.  The film has a lot of big laughs, and the trailer definitely makes it look like a dumb comedy, but the movie is so much more than that.  It's about Doug's big heart and his efforts to find a place where he belongs despite having nothing going for him but his muscles.  There is also a surprisingly touching love story with his love interest Eva, who has a boyfriend and sleeps around, but who eventually is won over by Doug's affection and utter sincerity.  The movie is full of oddball characters, but you end up loving all of them, and you start to understand what hockey means to this bunch of unruly misfits.  To enjoy this movie, though, you had better be able to handle an awful lot of bloody fights and constant, unremitting profanity.  If you can, then you're in for a treat.  Also: I grew up in Canada, and the movie is Canadian through and through, right down to the soundtrack which features Canadian songs I haven't heard in years.  If you're from Canada, that will be an extra added pleasure.  One last thing: the most amazing thing for me about watching this movie was that there was one line that simultaneously brought a tear to my eyes and made me laugh out loud.

1528729,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0079ZWTOO,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","Professional hockey like most pay-for-play sports has a ""minor"" league system where the athletes are developed for the ""big"" leagues.  In a Massachusetts town a team, several rungs below the NHL, struggles to draw a crowd.  Most of those that do attend do it for the fights not the skill of the skaters.  Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a bouncer at a local bar.  He and his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel who also wrote and produced) decide to head to the rink.  Pat is one of those loud fans who shout insults at the other team.  When one of the players takes umbrage, he comes into the stands to confront Pat.  Doug heads him off and beats him to a pulp, even cracking his helmet with a head butt.  This gets the attention of the home team coach who recruits him solely for his fighting skills.  One problem.  Doug can't skate worth a nickel.With some one-on-one instruction, Doug gets promoted to a team and league just short of the NHL.  He can skate a little better but his primary mission is to protect the star player (Marc-Andre Grondin).  He is coming back from a severe beating administered while in the NHL and is not being very successful at it.  The administrator of that beating is a thug enforcer (a very good Liev Schreiber) who is also coming back after a long suspension in what would be his final season.  Rhea (Schreiber) has been an idol of Doug for years so we know we're headed for a showdown.Before we get there, Doug falls for a Halifax local played by Alison Pill. This leads to some shy and funny fumbling at the dating scene complicated by the fact that Eva (Pill) already has a boyfriend, a red flag for Doug.  Doug by his own admission isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer but is proud of what appears to be a career of sorts.  His family isn't so happy however.  His father (Eugene Levy) and his gay brother are both medical doctors.  In a reunion before a big game at a restaurant, their disappointment is heartbreaking.Certainly it is refreshing to see Scott and Levy successfully impart great emotion much different from their usual comedic characters.

I could have done without the old ""I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out"" image, but I really am not familiar with Canada's minor league, so it may very well be authentic.

Not a huge pool to compare this too overall. So....I think it's better to simply judge this movie on its own merits. The ""Thug"", played by Seann William Scott, is a definite sympathetic character. Although he is pretty much an indomitable fighter, he's also just a plain old nice guy who simply likes to protect his buddies and teammates. I think Scott did a really great job with this character, where simplicity was more important in developing depth of character than witty acting lines. Basically, this movie chronicles his characters life from a bar bouncer to a semi pro hockey player, and shows how depth of character and a will to persevere can sometimes trump intelligence and trendiness. The hockey scenes were pretty awesome and often funny. The only thing I really didnt like about this movie was Jay Baruschel's scenes overall. They were funny at times, but for the most part, I was ready for the scenes he was in to simply be over. It's interesting to me because I generally like him alright, and I know he wrote (or helped write) and produced this movie.

I, myself, am not a fan of hockey, so I guess it's my own fault for going into movie thinking I'd like it, but I'll admit a Canadian film with Scott and Schreiber in it had me sold. I even paid the extra $8 to experience the most nauseating D-Box experience of my life. Ouch.Goon is supposedly based on a true story of a fighter who was trained to skate and be a hockey player, and was famous for sucking at hockey but beating the snot out of his opponents. Except, just replace the word ""fighter"" with ""bouncer"", and you have the 95 minute exercise in idiocy that is Goon, a comedy so depressingly boring. it's essentially Moneyball with tons of blood and gore, and without the classy charm.The first 20 minutes of the movie were gloriously entertaining. The opening fight scene on ice and the bloody tooth falling on the ice. That was brilliant. When we're introduced to the Main character is where the film starts getting slightly weak, however. So, you're telling me this guy is all adorkable and awkward, yet he has no problem beating people to a bloody pulp? Well, even then I was enjoying the film.However, when we meet his love interest, the film falls flat on his face. People considered the relationship between the hobo and the hooker in Hobo With A Shotgun to be unbelievable, but this makes it look like a tabloid story. In fact, the love aspect reminded me of Twilight at times (take a wild guess as to whether or not that's a compliment). Then we get cliched ""gets the girl"" ending? Frack right off. I've dropped turds more believable than that.Ultimately, the protagonist is just boring. He's given very few funny lines to work with, he has little to no personality whatsoever, and we're supposed to love him based on mere fighting skills alone. The most interesting character, Liev Schreiber's is only in it for five minutes. And the fight at the end isn't even redeeming at all either.But the worst problem with the film? It's BORING. the first 20 minutes are the funniest (not a good sign), the villain is interesting yet boring, the film doesn't use fight content to its full potential, there's no restraint at all whatsoever in the film... It's all just one big mess.If you like being beat over the head with BS, I guess see Goon, but for the rest of us, Goon is a disposable comedy to stock video store shelves with, and a huge disappointment considering the potential it all had.",2,"Like the main character, Goon can't seem to get its own head in the game",1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,2523,"['assume', 'Canadian', 'age-old', 'joke', 'now', 'went', 'fight', 'other', 'night', 'hockey', 'game', 'broke', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'hockey', 'guess', 'own', 'fault', 'going', 'movie', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Canadian', 'film', 'Scott', 'Schreiber', 'had', 'sold', 'even', 'paid', 'extra', '8', 'experience', 'most', 'nauseating', 'D-Box', 'experience', 'life', 'Ouch.Goon', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'fighter', 'who', 'was', 'trained', 'skate', 'be', 'hockey', 'player', 'was', 'famous', 'sucking', 'hockey', 'beating', 'snot', 'opponents', 'Except', 'just', 'replace', 'word', 'fighter', 'bouncer', 'have', '95', 'minute', 'exercise', 'idiocy', 'Goon', 'comedy', 'so', 'depressingly', 'boring', 'essentially', 'Moneyball', 'tons', 'blood', 'gore', 'classy', 'charm.The', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'gloriously', 'entertaining', 'opening', 'fight', 'scene', 'ice', 'bloody', 'tooth', 'falling', 'ice', 'was', 'brilliant', 'When', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Main', 'character', 'where', 'film', 'getting', 'slightly', 'weak', 'however', 'So', ""'re"", 'telling', 'guy', 'adorkable', 'awkward', 'yet', 'problem', 'beating', 'people', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'Well', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'enjoying', 'film.However', 'when', 'meet', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'flat', 'face', 'People', 'considered', 'relationship', 'hobo', 'hooker', 'Hobo', 'A', 'Shotgun', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'look', 'tabloid', 'story', 'fact', 'love', 'aspect', 'reminded', 'Twilight', 'times', 'take', 'wild', 'guess', 'not', 'compliment', 'Then', 'get', 'cliched', 'girl', 'ending', 'Frack', 'right', 'off', ""'ve"", 'dropped', 'turds', 'more', 'believable', 'that.Ultimately', 'protagonist', 'just', 'boring', 'given', 'very', 'few', 'funny', 'lines', 'work', 'little', 'personality', 'whatsoever', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'love', 'based', 'mere', 'fighting', 'skills', 'alone', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'fight', 'end', ""n't"", 'even', 'redeeming', 'either.But', 'worst', 'problem', 'film', 'BORING', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'funniest', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'villain', 'interesting', 'yet', 'boring', 'film', ""n't"", 'use', 'fight', 'content', 'full', 'potential', 'restraint', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'mess.If', 'being', 'beat', 'head', 'BS', 'guess', 'see', 'Goon', 'rest', 'Goon', 'disposable', 'comedy', 'stock', 'video', 'store', 'shelves', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'potential', 'had']",N/A

Which is why I've seen it popping up on best-of-2012 lists around the Internet all year. I agree 100% with these assessments--hilarious and heartbreaking by turns, Goon is another of those movies that makes me wonder why I find myself so in love with sports movies when, in general, I can't stand sports.Plot: Doug Glatt (Scott) is a hockey fan with a gay brother. While attending a minor-league match, he gets incensed that a player uses a derogatory term for ""gay"" when insulting fans and, when the player hops out of the box to come put the hurt on some people, takes him out. The coach of the opposing team takes note, and hires Glatt for his fighting skills. Things happen quickly, and Glatt, now known as Doug the Thug, soon finds himself playing for a Halifax farm team (coached by Sons of Anarchy's Kim Coates), tasked with guarding former pro player Xavier LaFlamme (5150 Rue des Ormes' Marc-Andre Grondin), who got sent down to the minors after losing his nerve thanks to getting a beatdown from legendary enforcer Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (The Manchurian Candidate's Liev Schreiber)--who himself has gotten sent down to the minors after too many suspensions. The paths are set, and you know all these folks are going to meet on the ice eventually...Goon is, simply, one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Co-writers Jay Baruchel, writing his first screenplay--who also has a part in the film as Doug's best friend--and Evan Goldberg (Superbad, The Pineapple Express) turned in a real winner here, in no small part by making Doug Glatt, when he's off the ice, a genuinely nice guy, quiet and unassuming and really, really slow on the uptake. The romantic subplot between Glatt and not-so-nice-girl Eva (the wonderful Alison Pill, recently of Midnight in Paris) actually works the way it's supposed to, the minor characters are perfectly drawn, and some of the things that Glatt spouts at times... well, once you see the ""stomach light"" scene, you'll get what I'm on about.Easily one of the best movies of 2012, even if it was released in 2011. ****",4,The best sports comedy since Men with Brooms!,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2255,"['Goon', 'Michael', 'Dowse', '2011', 'IMDB', 'release', 'date', 'Goon', '2011', 'specifically', 'have', 'premiered', 'TIFF', 'September', '10', '2011', 'most', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '2012', 'Which', 'why', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'popping', 'up', 'best-of-2012', 'lists', 'Internet', 'year', 'agree', '100', '%', 'assessments', 'hilarious', 'heartbreaking', 'turns', 'Goon', 'movies', 'wonder', 'why', 'find', 'so', 'love', 'sports', 'movies', 'when', 'general', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'sports.Plot', 'Doug', 'Glatt', 'Scott', 'hockey', 'fan', 'gay', 'brother', 'attending', 'minor-league', 'match', 'incensed', 'player', 'derogatory', 'term', 'gay', 'when', 'insulting', 'fans', 'when', 'player', 'box', 'come', 'put', 'hurt', 'people', 'out', 'coach', 'opposing', 'team', 'note', 'hires', 'Glatt', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Things', 'happen', 'quickly', 'Glatt', 'now', 'known', 'Doug', 'Thug', 'soon', 'playing', 'Halifax', 'farm', 'team', 'coached', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'Kim', 'Coates', 'tasked', 'guarding', 'former', 'pro', 'player', 'Xavier', 'LaFlamme', '5150', 'Rue', 'des', 'Ormes', 'Marc-Andre', 'Grondin', 'who', 'got', 'sent', 'down', 'minors', 'losing', 'nerve', 'thanks', 'getting', 'beatdown', 'legendary', 'enforcer', 'Ross', 'Boss', 'Rhea', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'who', 'gotten', 'sent', 'down', 'minors', 'too', 'many', 'suspensions', 'paths', 'are', 'set', 'know', 'folks', 'are', 'going', 'meet', 'ice', 'eventually', 'Goon', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ages', 'Co-writers', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'writing', 'first', 'screenplay', 'who', 'also', 'part', 'film', 'Doug', 'best', 'friend', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'Superbad', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'turned', 'real', 'winner', 'here', 'small', 'part', 'making', 'Doug', 'Glatt', 'when', 'ice', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'really', 'really', 'slow', 'uptake', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Glatt', 'not-so-nice-girl', 'Eva', 'wonderful', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'recently', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'actually', 'way', 'supposed', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'perfectly', 'drawn', 'things', 'Glatt', 'times', 'well', 'once', 'see', 'stomach', 'light', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'about.Easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2012', 'even', 'was', 'released', '2011', '****']",N/A

He plays the down to earth tough guy with a big heart with such passion and ease. I was completely rooting for Doug throughout the whole movie no matter if it was him trying to win the girl, gain the respect of his team, or taking his place as the top Goon. What I enjoyed the most was that they made Doug a good person who loves what he does, is loyal to his friends, family and team. They could have made him just another a-hole who hates gays and humps every girl around but they gave him heart and soul. Because Doug was such a loveable guy I wanted him to kick some butt, and I loved every punch and every tooth knocked out. This wasn't just about a guy beating some guys up, the end, it was about a guy accepting who he is and being proud of what he can do. Some people may want to say that's dumb and I am usually against violence myself, but there was much more to Doug than just fighting. I'm Canadian and I don't even like hockey that much, but Goon made me a fan, well at least a fan of the passion these players have for the game.This movie was also laugh my butt off funny. Doug's lack of language skills when it comes to making quick witted come backs is hilarious. He's just so much better at throwing punches than throwing a verbal jab at somebody and when he's talking to the girl he likes he's adorably cute. Yeah I just said that... I found myself laughing at least every 5 to 10 minutes at something Doug awkwardly said or did. Plus it helps that pretty much every one else is funny as well. Jay Baruchel was so funny as the loud mouth best friend, Alison Pil was funny as Doug's love interest and I can't forget all the guys on the team. Pretty much everyone said or did something funny at least once in the film.Goon was a perfect mix of heart and humour and I really can't think of too many movies that get it right. If I wasn't rooting for Doug I was laughing my butt off and I was thoroughly entertained by the acting, story and humour.

And basically the plot is Doug is recruited to the Highlanders minor league hockey team from a lower level minor league hockey team he just got on with having no experience on the ice what so ever (just in the ring as a boxer) to be a goon, fight, play dirty, and protect the whole team mainly their once great scoring winger Xavier LaFlamme who was never the same once Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea the king of Goons in the movie who is still in the hockey league Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt plays in put an illegal hit on him suspending the Ross The Boss for 20 games.All in all the movie had some funny parts in it along with a good plot as mentioned above.  And this film did have good actors in it.  But it still wasn't as good as the first Slap Shots film which is why it gets 4 stars even though it did have more blood and fighting in it then any hockey movie I've ever seen. Something else worthy of mentioning is that Sheann William Scott yes the one the only person who played Steve ""The Stiffmister"" Stiffler who has played similar roles in other movies such as Road Trip, Role Models, and The Rundown in this film actually plays kind of a completely opposite character in Doug Glatt a polite, soft spoken, nice person who can also fight very well and can hit people very hard.",4,"Good, but Slap Shots is still the best",1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1649,"['movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'interestingly', 'was', 'actually', 'according', 'ESPN', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'boxer', 'who', 'turned', 'hockey', 'goon', 'played', 'AHL', '0', 'assist', '0', 'goals', 'film', 'Doug', 'Glatt', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'actually', 'one', 'goal', 'few', 'assist', 'anything', 'original', 'Goon', 'story', 'basically', 'plot', 'Doug', 'recruited', 'Highlanders', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'team', 'lower', 'level', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'team', 'just', 'got', 'having', 'experience', 'ice', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'just', 'ring', 'boxer', 'be', 'goon', 'fight', 'play', 'dirty', 'protect', 'whole', 'team', 'mainly', 'once', 'great', 'scoring', 'winger', 'Xavier', 'LaFlamme', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'once', 'Ross', 'Boss', 'Rhea', 'king', 'Goons', 'movie', 'who', 'still', 'hockey', 'league', 'Doug', 'Thug', 'Glatt', 'put', 'illegal', 'hit', 'suspending', 'Ross', 'Boss', '20', 'games.All', 'movie', 'had', 'funny', 'parts', 'good', 'plot', 'mentioned', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'actors', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Slap', 'Shots', 'film', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'even', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'blood', 'fighting', 'then', 'hockey', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Something', 'else', 'worthy', 'mentioning', 'Sheann', 'William', 'Scott', 'yes', 'one', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'played', 'Steve', 'Stiffmister', 'Stiffler', 'who', 'played', 'similar', 'roles', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Role', 'Models', 'Rundown', 'film', 'actually', 'kind', 'completely', 'opposite', 'character', 'Doug', 'Glatt', 'polite', 'soft', 'spoken', 'nice', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'fight', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'hit', 'people', 'very', 'hard']",N/A

Based on a memoir by hockey pro Doug Smith, it mixes in broad jokes about beer, women, Russians, and Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois to make something quintessentially Canadian, yet it's also accessible to those of us who did not grow up with Molson running through our veins and visions of the Stanley Cup haunting our dreams.""Goon"" features an excellent cast of Canadians led by the winning Seann William Scott, perhaps best known for his role as Steve Stifler in the ""American Pie"" films. Scott plays bouncer Doug Glatt, a sweet-natured, dim-witted man-child who just happens to be very good at beating the crap out of people. After a fracas at a hockey game leads a local team to hire him, his thuggish efficiency on the ice gets him promoted to a minor-league club, the Halifax Highlanders. Coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates) assigns him the task of protecting the team's high-scorer, Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), a former prodigy now less interested in hockey than he is in cocaine and strippers.Eugene Levy (also in ""American Pie"") is Doug's father, a doctor ashamed of his son's job as a hockey enforcer; Jay Baruchel (one of the screenwriters) is Doug's friend Pat, a rabid fan who hosts an amateurish cable program devoted to the sport; Alison Pill (Baruchel's real-life fianc&eacute;e) is Doug's crush Eva, a ""puck bunny"" with a thing for hockey players; and Liev Shreiber (the only major star in the film) is renowned enforcer Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea, who becomes Doug's nemesis in the arena.Since it's a comedy, ""Goon"" gives us a happy-if-cockeyed ending in which Doug gets the girl and his underdog team wins redemption in the final showdown. But that's not really the point: this is an over-the-top love letter to the rough-and-tumble culture of hockey and of Canada itself, as well as an excuse for boys being boys, with all of the idiotic insanity, drunken profanity, and bloody brutality that involves.

1528773,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B0079ZWTOO,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[3, 12]","No matter the sport, every team has a ""goon"" sitting somewhere on the bench. A guy like Bill Laimbeer springs to mind in the NBA, or if one was unfortunate enough to play in the NFL back in the 1970s they might catch a broken neck on a late hit from Jack Tatum. These are skilled players who often put their talents and personal glory aside to do whatever was necessary for the team. In hockey, these players are held in especially high esteem and are considered fearsome warriors on the ice. In a sport that relishes the pier six brawl more than the rare hat trick, the goon is like hockey royalty.That reverence for the sport and its bloody violence is at the heart of Goon, a new hockey comedy starring Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, yet another in a long line of moronic characters with a heart that shines like the Stanley Cup. A  slow-witted bouncer at a Boston bar, Doug communicates best with his fists, a fact which disappoints his high class parents embarrassed by their son's profession. He lives in a world where hockey is the only thing that matters, exemplified by his pesky, motor-mouthed buddy, Pat(co-writer Jay Baruchel), who hosts a vulgar sports talk show out of his basement. After Pat berates a visiting player into jumping the stands during a game, Doug literally bashes the guy's teeth out, earning himself a try out for the local squad.The problem is that Doug isn't really a player. He can't skate and certainly can't shoot. All he does his beat people up, but he does it well enough to get passed to the semi-pro squad in Halifax, where he's brought in to protect a Gretzky-esque pretty boy who doesn't like getting hit. The big leagues get him in all types of trouble, falling for a promiscuous hockey groupie(Alison Pill) and riling up Ross ""The Boss"" Shea(Liev Schreiber), an ex-NHL goon on the downside of his career.While the story focuses primarily on Doug's brutal exploits, relishing the blood and broken teeth of his victims in operatic slo-motion, it's Shea's story that is the most interesting. Schreiber is fantastic as the aging fighter, who has been demoted to the minors after one too many assaults and deteriorating ability. He sees in Doug one last chance to prove he's still the toughest man in the sport, while also recognizing that being pidgeon-holed as a goon has not only stunted his career, but also those of guys like Doug. A man-to-man chat they have on the eve of their inevitable showdown is the highlight of the film. This should have been the story of Shea's career, with Doug completely out of the equation.Baruchel and Evan Goldberg's script is wildly off balance like a left winger who has taken one too many pucks to the head. They clearly expect us to root for Doug, but he's such a blank slate that it's hard to find any reason to like him. Merely grinning like a dufus and mumbling non-sequitors isn't enough. Only Shreiber brings real gravitas, with his handlebar mustache and bad ass samurai mystique. Michael Dowse's direction excels during the fast paced game sequences, which are so brutal they might make even the most die hard fan quake in their skates.The plan for every hockey film is to achieve the sort of legendary status as 1977's Slap Shot, which featured Paul Newman in one of his most enduring roles. With only sporadic humor and a hero that's hard to cheer on, Goon's shot sails wide of the net.",2,Should have focsed on Liev Schreiber's character,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,3380,"['matter', 'sport', 'team', 'goon', 'sitting', 'somewhere', 'bench', 'guy', 'Bill', 'Laimbeer', 'springs', 'mind', 'NBA', 'one', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'play', 'NFL', 'back', '1970s', 'might', 'catch', 'broken', 'neck', 'late', 'hit', 'Jack', 'Tatum', 'are', 'skilled', 'players', 'who', 'often', 'put', 'talents', 'personal', 'glory', 'aside', 'do', 'was', 'necessary', 'team', 'hockey', 'players', 'are', 'held', 'especially', 'high', 'esteem', 'are', 'considered', 'fearsome', 'warriors', 'ice', 'sport', 'pier', 'six', 'brawl', 'more', 'rare', 'hat', 'trick', 'goon', 'hockey', 'royalty.That', 'reverence', 'sport', 'bloody', 'violence', 'heart', 'Goon', 'new', 'hockey', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Doug', 'Glatt', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'moronic', 'characters', 'heart', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'slow-witted', 'bouncer', 'Boston', 'bar', 'Doug', 'best', 'fists', 'fact', 'high', 'class', 'parents', 'embarrassed', 'son', 'profession', 'world', 'where', 'hockey', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'exemplified', 'pesky', 'motor-mouthed', 'buddy', 'Pat', 'co-writer', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'who', 'vulgar', 'sports', 'talk', 'show', 'basement', 'Pat', 'visiting', 'player', 'jumping', 'stands', 'game', 'Doug', 'literally', 'guy', 'teeth', 'out', 'earning', 'try', 'out', 'local', 'squad.The', 'problem', 'Doug', ""n't"", 'really', 'player', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skate', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'beat', 'people', 'up', 'well', 'enough', 'get', 'passed', 'semi-pro', 'squad', 'Halifax', 'where', 'brought', 'protect', 'Gretzky-esque', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'getting', 'hit', 'big', 'leagues', 'get', 'types', 'trouble', 'falling', 'promiscuous', 'hockey', 'groupie', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'riling', 'up', 'Ross', 'Boss', 'Shea', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'ex-NHL', 'goon', 'downside', 'career.While', 'story', 'primarily', 'Doug', 'brutal', 'exploits', 'relishing', 'blood', 'broken', 'teeth', 'victims', 'operatic', 'slo-motion', 'Shea', 'story', 'most', 'interesting', 'Schreiber', 'fantastic', 'aging', 'fighter', 'who', 'been', 'demoted', 'minors', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'assaults', 'deteriorating', 'ability', 'Doug', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'prove', 'still', 'toughest', 'man', 'sport', 'also', 'recognizing', 'being', 'pidgeon-holed', 'goon', 'not', 'only', 'stunted', 'career', 'also', 'guys', 'Doug', 'man-to-man', 'chat', 'have', 'eve', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'highlight', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'Shea', 'career', 'Doug', 'completely', 'equation.Baruchel', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'script', 'wildly', 'off', 'balance', 'left', 'winger', 'who', 'taken', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'pucks', 'head', 'clearly', 'expect', 'root', 'Doug', 'such', 'blank', 'slate', 'hard', 'find', 'reason', 'like', 'Merely', 'grinning', 'dufus', 'mumbling', 'non-sequitors', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Only', 'Shreiber', 'brings', 'real', 'gravitas', 'handlebar', 'mustache', 'bad', 'ass', 'samurai', 'mystique', 'Michael', 'Dowse', 'direction', 'excels', 'fast', 'paced', 'game', 'sequences', 'are', 'so', 'brutal', 'might', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'quake', 'skates.The', 'plan', 'hockey', 'film', 'achieve', 'sort', 'legendary', 'status', '1977', 'Slap', 'Shot', 'featured', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'roles', 'only', 'sporadic', 'humor', 'hero', 'hard', 'cheer', 'Goon', 'shot', 'sails', 'wide', 'net']",N/A

I am not a hockey fan but took a shot at this film since it was recommended on the filmspotting webcast.  Certainly glad I did because I found this to be the best comedy I have seen in a long time.  Loved the characters and the dialogue.  The writers took the genres of comedy, sport film, and Conan the Barbarian gladiator film and melded them into an entertaining film.  It does come with a warning since it has some truly gory moments.",5,Surprisingly good comedy,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,498,"['spite', 'high', 'level', 'violence', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'hockey', 'fan', 'took', 'shot', 'film', 'was', 'recommended', 'filmspotting', 'webcast', 'Certainly', 'glad', 'did', 'found', 'be', 'best', 'comedy', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Loved', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'writers', 'took', 'genres', 'comedy', 'sport', 'film', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'gladiator', 'film', 'melded', 'entertaining', 'film', 'come', 'warning', 'truly', 'gory', 'moments']",N/A
