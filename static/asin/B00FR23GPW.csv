1672917,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00FR23GPW,Alan Ramirez,"[7, 10]","Revenge is one of those shows that is always entertaining. Each season has been full of drama, mysteries, good performance, and of course, a lot of revenge, and season three is not the exception, in fact the show is better than ever!After a not-so-perfect second season, I had huge guesses about the third season but now that season 3 ended last night I'm glad it did! If anyone has guesses about it, you better catch up before season 4 begins!The story has AWESOME twists and turns, great performances, and the characters really suffer this season, no one's safe, not even Emily! I loved this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen next, it happens when a show is so well written, and if you believe you were right about something there's always a catch! Revenge is one of those shows.I'm writing this after watching season three's finale which in my opinion is the best season finale so far!Emily VanCamp is a terrific actress and she proves it one more time, and the whole cast, including new characters, everybody balances so well, there's never a boring episode or a storyline.I can't wait to own this season on DVD and re-watch it over again! Revenge fans will be pleased and new watchers won't regret.",5,A rollercoaster that keeps entertaining,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1215,"['Revenge', 'one', 'shows', 'always', 'entertaining', 'season', 'been', 'full', 'drama', 'mysteries', 'good', 'performance', 'course', 'lot', 'revenge', 'season', 'three', 'not', 'exception', 'fact', 'show', 'better', 'ever', 'not-so-perfect', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'huge', 'guesses', 'third', 'season', 'now', 'season', '3', 'ended', 'last', 'night', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'anyone', 'guesses', 'better', 'catch', 'up', 'season', '4', 'story', 'AWESOME', 'twists', 'turns', 'great', 'performances', 'characters', 'really', 'suffer', 'season', 'one', 'safe', 'not', 'even', 'Emily', 'loved', 'feeling', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'when', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'believe', 'were', 'right', 'something', 'always', 'catch', 'Revenge', 'one', 'shows.I', ""'m"", 'writing', 'watching', 'season', 'three', 'finale', 'opinion', 'best', 'season', 'finale', 'so', 'far', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'terrific', 'actress', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'whole', 'cast', 'including', 'new', 'characters', 'everybody', 'balances', 'so', 'well', 'never', 'boring', 'episode', 'storyline.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'season', 'DVD', 're-watch', 'over', 'again', 'Revenge', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'new', 'watchers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Revenge: Season 3

Just when you think you know her , she pulls another trick from under her sleeve. I absolutely love her ride or die Noland.. smart and witty. Call me crazy but I also really like Victoria and Conrad..... they are actually really smart considering they are the enemies in this show..... I like Daniel but he is you typical jock (not to smart) but extremely handsome.All in all its a great show and I recommend you watch all seasons...

The main problem is they are trying to drag this story out just for the money they can make off of it. She is seeking revenge on entirely to many people. She could/should have gotten her revenge on the 6 major bad guys/girls in 2 maybe 3 seasons and let it go at that. As it is season three suffers from bad writing and I wouldn't hold out much hope for the writing in season 4 improving.",2,"Season 1&2 were great, but season 3 is a real loser",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,441,"['Season', '1', '2', 'were', 'great', 'season', '3', 'real', 'loser', 'main', 'problem', 'are', 'trying', 'drag', 'story', 'out', 'just', 'money', 'can', 'make', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'entirely', 'many', 'people', 'could/should', 'have', 'gotten', 'revenge', '6', 'major', 'bad', 'guys/girls', '2', 'maybe', '3', 'seasons', 'let', 'go', 'season', 'three', 'suffers', 'bad', 'writing', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'out', 'much', 'hope', 'writing', 'season', '4', 'improving']",Revenge: Season 3

In the 80s there were shows like &#34;Dallas&#34;, &#34;Knots Landing&#34;, &#34;Faloncrest&#34; etc. These shows had a cast of characters who over acted and constantly did evil stuff to each other.  This show is like a call back to those shows but is even more over the top than even those shows.  Everyone talks to each other like they want to kill and eat them &#34;spoiler&#34; (save the two characters who died).  There was a dude in season one who sounded normal but now he sounds angry all the time so I think he will live.  Anyway, this show is over the top and very entertaining if you like shows about crazy, evil white people and I do.",5,This is histerical,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,765,"['people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'shows', 'crazy', 'evil', 'white', 'people', 'years', 'show', '80s', 'were', 'shows', '34', 'Dallas', '34', '34', 'Knots', 'Landing', '34', '34', 'Faloncrest', '34', 'etc', 'shows', 'had', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'acted', 'constantly', 'did', 'evil', 'stuff', 'other', 'show', 'call', 'back', 'shows', 'even', 'more', 'top', 'even', 'shows', 'Everyone', 'talks', 'other', 'want', 'kill', 'eat', '34', 'spoiler', '34', 'save', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'dude', 'season', 'one', 'who', 'sounded', 'normal', 'now', 'angry', 'time', 'think', 'will', 'live', 'Anyway', 'show', 'top', 'very', 'entertaining', 'like', 'shows', 'crazy', 'evil', 'white', 'people', 'do']",Revenge: Season 3
1672921,A3M17XG8HL7JRF,B00FR23GPW,"Who Am I? ""Me!""","[6, 11]","Season 3 introduces a brand new dynamic. It's the season where people start questioning their loyalty to Emily, including those who once had her back in previous seasons. Though it is an interesting twist I think there is way too much of it this season. To the point where the show is becoming depressing. Our heroine is being attacked and plotted against from all corners which is hard to watch. Jack, Aiden, Nolan, Danielle and even Charlotte all have it in for Emily at some point in the season.  I think we all want to see Emily succeed at her goal at least on some level, so watching episode after episode of her allies hating her or trying to bring her down can be a real downer.  I do still watch the show whenever I feel like getting into a negative mood, but make no mistake- season 1 is still unfortunately the best season out of the three.",2,Depressing Season,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,850,"['Season', '3', 'introduces', 'brand', 'new', 'dynamic', 'season', 'where', 'people', 'start', 'questioning', 'loyalty', 'Emily', 'including', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'back', 'previous', 'seasons', 'interesting', 'twist', 'think', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'season', 'point', 'where', 'show', 'becoming', 'depressing', 'heroine', 'being', 'attacked', 'plotted', 'corners', 'hard', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Aiden', 'Nolan', 'Danielle', 'even', 'Charlotte', 'have', 'Emily', 'point', 'season', 'think', 'want', 'see', 'Emily', 'succeed', 'goal', 'least', 'level', 'so', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'allies', 'hating', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'downer', 'do', 'still', 'watch', 'show', 'whenever', 'feel', 'getting', 'negative', 'mood', 'make', 'mistake-', 'season', '1', 'still', 'unfortunately', 'best', 'season', 'three']",Revenge: Season 3
