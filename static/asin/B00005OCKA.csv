672386,A2BFVDQTU9Z1L2,B00005OCKA,"J ""peacemover""","[153, 158]","This DVD is great for people who have little or no experience with playing guitar and want to begin without investing in private lessons (private lessons are a good idea if you can afford them). The DVD contains basics such as posture, hand position, a few basic chords, and strumming.  It even has a very basic introduction to fingerstyle (playing with your fingers instead of a pick).I had taken a very basic class a few years ago, then taught myself barre chords and a few scales. I recently invested in a good mid-range guitar (Martin DC-16 GTE), so I picked up this dvd as a refresher.  I found myself skipping to chapter 8 before I came to anything I hadn't learned yet.  So the title ""Learning Guitar for Dummies"" is apt.  It is great for beginners as a SUPPLEMENT to private lessons.  For intermediate players who are looking to build such skills as fingerstyle, barre chords, scales and improvisation, etc, you'll need something a bit more advanced than this.  I found myself more bored and drooling over the Taylor 814 CE he was playing than focusing on the really basic concepts he was presenting.Other drawbacks of the video:  1) his singing is terrible 2) he doesn't go over such basics as selecting and changing strings or some accessories that are helpful even for the novice (i.e. string winders, supplies for cleaning and maintaining the instrument- like a lint free cloth, a humidifier, etc).  3) in the video he does not always follow the suggested fingering shown in the chart on the screen (i.e. on a few of the songs he plays a G chord with the 1,2, and 4 fingers instead of the 1,2,3 as shown in the chart- I also prefer the 1,2,4 fingering, but this may be confusing to some beginners).  Other than that it is a good introductory video for the beginner.",4,Great for beginners; little here for intermediate players,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1777,"['DVD', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'experience', 'playing', 'guitar', 'want', 'begin', 'investing', 'private', 'lessons', 'private', 'lessons', 'are', 'good', 'idea', 'can', 'afford', 'DVD', 'basics', 'such', 'posture', 'hand', 'position', 'few', 'basic', 'chords', 'strumming', 'even', 'very', 'basic', 'introduction', 'fingerstyle', 'playing', 'fingers', 'instead', 'pick', '.I', 'had', 'taken', 'very', 'basic', 'class', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'taught', 'barre', 'chords', 'few', 'scales', 'recently', 'invested', 'good', 'mid-range', 'guitar', 'Martin', 'DC-16', 'GTE', 'so', 'picked', 'up', 'dvd', 'refresher', 'found', 'skipping', 'chapter', '8', 'came', 'anything', 'had', ""n't"", 'learned', 'yet', 'title', 'Learning', 'Guitar', 'Dummies', 'apt', 'great', 'beginners', 'SUPPLEMENT', 'private', 'lessons', 'intermediate', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'build', 'such', 'skills', 'fingerstyle', 'barre', 'chords', 'scales', 'improvisation', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'need', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'advanced', 'found', 'more', 'bored', 'drooling', 'Taylor', '814', 'CE', 'was', 'playing', 'focusing', 'really', 'basic', 'concepts', 'was', 'presenting.Other', 'drawbacks', 'video', '1', 'singing', 'terrible', '2', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'such', 'basics', 'selecting', 'changing', 'strings', 'accessories', 'are', 'helpful', 'even', 'novice', 'i.e', 'string', 'winders', 'supplies', 'cleaning', 'maintaining', 'instrument-', 'lint', 'free', 'cloth', 'humidifier', 'etc', '3', 'video', 'not', 'always', 'follow', 'suggested', 'fingering', 'shown', 'chart', 'screen', 'i.e', 'few', 'songs', 'G', 'chord', '1,2', '4', 'fingers', 'instead', '1,2,3', 'shown', 'chart-', 'also', 'prefer', '1,2,4', 'fingering', 'may', 'be', 'confusing', 'beginners', 'Other', 'good', 'introductory', 'video', 'beginner']",Learning Guitar for Dummies
