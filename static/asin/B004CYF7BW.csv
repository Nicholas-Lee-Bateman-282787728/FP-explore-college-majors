I loved how the actors talked and joked about their own characters, almost as though it was personal. As she always does, Jeanne Cooper stole the show!(The only bad parts were when they let the audience ask questions. The worst was when a ventriloquist woman in the audience used a little girl as a puppet to say she ""watches the show every day"" in a very creepy voice. Peter Bergman seemed to play along with the woman, but mentioned that he remembered her from some other ""mothers dressing up little girls"" type of convention.)",4,Worth Watching For All Y&R Fans,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,617,"['Having', 'watched', 'Y', 'R', 'thirty-some', 'years', 'was', 'delightful', 'program', 'see', 'loved', 'how', 'actors', 'talked', 'joked', 'own', 'characters', 'almost', 'was', 'personal', 'always', 'Jeanne', 'Cooper', 'stole', 'show', 'only', 'bad', 'parts', 'were', 'when', 'let', 'audience', 'ask', 'questions', 'worst', 'was', 'when', 'ventriloquist', 'woman', 'audience', 'used', 'little', 'girl', 'puppet', 'say', 'show', 'day', 'very', 'creepy', 'voice', 'Peter', 'Bergman', 'seemed', 'play', 'along', 'woman', 'mentioned', 'remembered', 'other', 'mothers', 'dressing', 'up', 'little', 'girls', 'type', 'convention']",The Young and the Restless 35th Anniversary: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

This show never grabbed me the music is too slow and the storylines never seemed exciting just dull... however, with that said this is wonderful!

Having been at the top of the U.S. Nielsen Ratings list since the middle of 1988 (24 years!!!) is something no other television show has ever done. For every single week no other serial has ever surpassed this remarkable achievement so it's with great fanfare the stars of the series took time to be on a panel to discuss the ups and downs in Genoa City. Among the stars are Jeanne Cooper (the longest-lasting member of the cast since late 1973, Jess Walton, Melody Thomas-Scott, Joshua Murrow, Peter Bergman and Michelle Stafford, most of whom are all Emmy winners.The cast also takes questions from the audience at the end.This is a gem to own if your a fan of this fantastic serial.",5,"""A True Collector's Item""",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,853,"['2008', 'CBS', 'television', 'Paley', 'Center', 'TV', 'celebrated', 'remarkable', 'milestone', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'daytime', '1', 'rated', 'show', 'Young', 'Restless', 'Having', 'been', 'top', 'U.S.', 'Nielsen', 'Ratings', 'list', 'middle', '1988', '24', 'years', 'something', 'no', 'other', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'done', 'single', 'week', 'other', 'serial', 'ever', 'surpassed', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'great', 'fanfare', 'stars', 'series', 'took', 'time', 'be', 'panel', 'discuss', 'ups', 'downs', 'Genoa', 'City', 'stars', 'are', 'Jeanne', 'Cooper', 'longest-lasting', 'member', 'cast', 'late', '1973', 'Jess', 'Walton', 'Melody', 'Thomas-Scott', 'Joshua', 'Murrow', 'Peter', 'Bergman', 'Michelle', 'Stafford', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'Emmy', 'winners.The', 'cast', 'also', 'questions', 'audience', 'end.This', 'gem', 'own', 'fan', 'fantastic', 'serial']",The Young and the Restless 35th Anniversary: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center
