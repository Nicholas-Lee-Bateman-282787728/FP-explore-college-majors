But, when you want a movie to just take you away for a little fun fantasy and romance, The Spring fills the bill. If there was a fountain of youth, who would control it? How could they control it -- and what evil would it unleash in that power struggle?Take my advice and get this one if you love the feel of Lifetime movies with a supernatural twist.",5,The perfect little movie for a rainy day at home!,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,494,"['OMG', 'Do', 'ever', 'love', 'movie', 'Yes', 'know', 'none', 'qualities', 'greatness', 'not', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'classic', 'film', 'when', 'want', 'movie', 'just', 'take', 'away', 'little', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'romance', 'Spring', 'bill', 'was', 'fountain', 'youth', 'who', 'would', 'control', 'How', 'could', 'control', 'what', 'evil', 'would', 'unleash', 'power', 'struggle', 'Take', 'advice', 'get', 'one', 'love', 'feel', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'supernatural', 'twist']",N/A

I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  Perhaps I'm biased because it was filmed in my home town of Fort Langley, BC (which at the time of purchase, I didn't realize) . . .The acting is pretty good all around, I think.  Some parts are cheesy and the story isn't exactly realistic, but it was a good movie to watch.  All in all, I'm glad that I spent the $13 on it.  I'll watch it again.",4,Pretty good for a TV movie.,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,546,"['Admittedly', 'only', 'bought', 'movie', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'CSI', 'George', 'Eads', 'When', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'expected', 'enjoy', 'moderately', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'biased', 'was', 'filmed', 'home', 'town', 'Fort', 'Langley', 'BC', 'time', 'purchase', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', '.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'parts', 'are', 'cheesy', 'story', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'realistic', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', ""'m"", 'glad', 'spent', '13', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again']",N/A

A chance encounter with a strange couple with car trouble leads them to the quaint little town of Springville.  Not such a bad place---everyone is young, and the reason is the titular spring, which acts as a sort of fountain of youth, with strings attached.So as not to give away the plot's ""secrets,"" suffice to say that Kyle finds out being young is not always being wise.  Poor Kyle seems totally bored with his role and it's up to Alison Eastwood as the town doctor and George Eads as the local mechanic to bring some sort of life into this thinly structured plot.  It's pleasantly gore free, and deaths are staged without blood and guts.  It ends up being a less emphatic version of Shirley Jackson's classic short story, ""The Lottery.""

760089,A8ZTPTLGC4755,B00009YXGR,Terry,"[1, 1]","First off, I am a big George Eads fan, which is the primary reason I got this film.  That being said, I think it was an interesting and rather intriguing concept but slowed and lagged after 45 minutes.  The first half is very good especially how the town is introduced to us and how the director shows the intrigue build when we see the notebook with the dates of when people died. But after that is seems to lose itself and the climax was rather flat considering the build up leading to it.  I expected something on the same level as the Lottery.  I also thought that the son had a stronger moral and ethical streak in him than the father, whom I thought was being kind of selfish.  I didn't think it was a great film but it wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't recommend it.  Just don't expect much.",2,Interesting concept but could have been better,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,798,"['First', 'am', 'big', 'George', 'Eads', 'fan', 'primary', 'reason', 'got', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'was', 'interesting', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'slowed', 'lagged', '45', 'minutes', 'first', 'half', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'how', 'town', 'introduced', 'how', 'director', 'intrigue', 'build', 'when', 'see', 'notebook', 'dates', 'when', 'people', 'died', 'lose', 'climax', 'was', 'rather', 'flat', 'considering', 'build', 'up', 'leading', 'expected', 'something', 'same', 'level', 'Lottery', 'also', 'thought', 'son', 'had', 'stronger', 'moral', 'ethical', 'streak', 'father', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'being', 'kind', 'selfish', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much']",N/A

760091,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00009YXGR,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""The Spring"" is not bad if one's expectations aren't too high. I watched this on a rainy afternoon on the Lifetime Movie Network and found it interesting. I liked the premise of the movie, which centers around a bucolic little town called Springville. A widower Dennis Conway (Kyle Maclachlan) and his son Brian are on their way to the mountains for a camping trip when they stop to help two stranded motorists. Once the motorists leave, Brian finds a bag they left behind and father & son decide to stop by the address provided on the bag to return it. The address is in Springville, and both Dennis and Brian decide to spend the night after finding no one home at the provided address, and find it strange that the local police are keeping an eye on the house.The next morning, Dennis is having breakfast in a local diner whilst Brian plays outside and gets in a accident, requiring hospitalization. The pair are introduced to the town doctor, Sophie (Alison Eastwood), and Dennis is immediately attracted to her. At the same time, Dennis is puzzled that the police seem bent on getting him and Brian to leave the town. By now, viewers already know that the town harbors a spring that has healing powers and staves off aging. The question is: Will the budding romance between Dennis and Sophie go anywhere, and if so, what will Dennis and Brian decide to do after discovering the town's secret? There is more to the town than just being eternally young, for there is a price to be paid.This story reminded me of Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"", and I plan to watch the TV adaptation of the story. ""The Spring"" is quite engaging, it did keep my interest, but the plot was rather predictable, though I felt the actors did a decent job in their respective roles, especially those in the lead roles. I would rent it though.",3,Decent made-for-TV thriller,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1833,"['Spring', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'watched', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'found', 'interesting', 'liked', 'premise', 'movie', 'bucolic', 'little', 'town', 'called', 'Springville', 'widower', 'Dennis', 'Conway', 'Kyle', 'Maclachlan', 'son', 'Brian', 'are', 'way', 'mountains', 'camping', 'trip', 'when', 'stop', 'help', 'two', 'stranded', 'motorists', 'motorists', 'leave', 'Brian', 'bag', 'left', 'behind', 'father', 'son', 'decide', 'stop', 'address', 'provided', 'bag', 'return', 'address', 'Springville', 'Dennis', 'Brian', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'finding', 'one', 'home', 'provided', 'address', 'find', 'strange', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'keeping', 'eye', 'house.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Dennis', 'having', 'breakfast', 'local', 'diner', 'whilst', 'Brian', 'outside', 'accident', 'requiring', 'hospitalization', 'pair', 'are', 'introduced', 'town', 'doctor', 'Sophie', 'Alison', 'Eastwood', 'Dennis', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'same', 'time', 'Dennis', 'puzzled', 'police', 'seem', 'bent', 'getting', 'Brian', 'leave', 'town', 'now', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'town', 'spring', 'healing', 'powers', 'staves', 'off', 'aging', 'question', 'Will', 'budding', 'romance', 'Dennis', 'Sophie', 'go', 'anywhere', 'so', 'what', 'will', 'Dennis', 'Brian', 'decide', 'do', 'discovering', 'town', 'secret', 'more', 'town', 'just', 'being', 'eternally', 'young', 'price', 'be', 'paid.This', 'story', 'reminded', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'short', 'story', 'Lottery', 'plan', 'watch', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'story', 'Spring', 'quite', 'engaging', 'did', 'keep', 'interest', 'plot', 'was', 'rather', 'predictable', 'felt', 'actors', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'especially', 'lead', 'roles', 'would', 'rent']",N/A
