1385055,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0044GAQ1O,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","For a film as ridiculously taboo as `Kynodontas', there is something intensely sincere about it.  Don't take that as a ploy to raise sympathy for a film that is unapologetically unsympathetic, but there is something about `Kynodontas' that feels artistically honest.  Unlike controversial films like `Antichrist' (which I recently reviewed), the shocks and thrills in store for us in `Kynodontas' aren't there simply to just shock us and so they don't feel as unnecessarily dirty; at least not by comparison.  Sure, there is some sick and twisted stuff here, but it all feels oddly purposeful.Seriously.`Kynodontas' gives us unwanted insight into the world of the obscure as we enter the lives of a secluded family spiraling out of control.  Guarding their children from the dangers of modernized society, a middle aged couple fill their children's ears with lies to scare them into servitude.  The children are taught odd meanings to words and kept in the shadows about what real life is like for people their age.  The children believe that leaving home before their dogtooth falls out (an obvious attempt to keep them eternally under their wing since there is no such thing as a dogtooth) will spell certain doom.  Fed stories of another sibling who broke rules and wound up unfortunate (I'm still deciding whether or not that sibling really existed or is another figment), the three children, as full grown as they are, live in an unrealized fear.But outside influence is never completely avoidable, and societies calling can prove disastrous for the walls build around this family (figurative and literal).Now, I find it kind of odd that one of the critical praises on the cover of this DVD labels it `hilarious'.  I didn't find anything about this film funny, at least not overtly intentionally.  I mean, yes, some of the situations are bizarre enough to warrant a smirk, but the smirk is more of an uncomfortable smirk than anything else.  The film is horribly uncomfortable in many scenes, and the actions of the parents here don't really deserve our laughter.  This is not a film to be taken lightly, for I don't think that the subject matter could withstand that direction.  This film takes it upon itself to address VERY controversial subjects such as prostitution, brainwashing, cultist practices and even incest.  The lighter air of the film certainly makes these situations more palatable (can you even say that) but there is a definite uneasiness that comes with scenes depicting a brother simulating sex with his sister.Still, there is a message here that feels as though it runs deeper than the assumed `don't be too strict with your children'.  There is an obvious mental departure that is existent within the parents to go to such an extreme to shelter the minds of their children to the point of intoxicating them.  Their `love' knows no bounds, no matter how sick and demented.This is not a film to be generally entertained with, but it raises some shatteringly deep questions and highlights themes that need to be taken to the extreme to be truly appreciated.",5,Sharpen your canines...,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,3081,"['film', 'ridiculously', 'Kynodontas', 'something', 'intensely', 'sincere', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'ploy', 'raise', 'sympathy', 'film', 'unapologetically', 'unsympathetic', 'something', 'Kynodontas', 'artistically', 'honest', 'controversial', 'films', 'Antichrist', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'shocks', 'thrills', 'store', 'Kynodontas', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'simply', 'just', 'shock', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'unnecessarily', 'dirty', 'least', 'not', 'comparison', 'Sure', 'sick', 'twisted', 'stuff', 'here', 'feels', 'oddly', 'purposeful.Seriously.', 'Kynodontas', 'unwanted', 'insight', 'world', 'obscure', 'enter', 'lives', 'secluded', 'family', 'spiraling', 'control', 'Guarding', 'children', 'dangers', 'modernized', 'society', 'middle', 'aged', 'couple', 'fill', 'children', 'ears', 'lies', 'scare', 'servitude', 'children', 'are', 'taught', 'odd', 'meanings', 'words', 'kept', 'shadows', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'age', 'children', 'believe', 'leaving', 'home', 'dogtooth', 'out', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'keep', 'eternally', 'wing', 'such', 'thing', 'dogtooth', 'will', 'spell', 'certain', 'doom', 'Fed', 'stories', 'sibling', 'who', 'broke', 'rules', 'wound', 'up', 'unfortunate', ""'m"", 'still', 'deciding', 'not', 'sibling', 'really', 'existed', 'figment', 'three', 'children', 'full', 'grown', 'are', 'live', 'unrealized', 'fear.But', 'outside', 'influence', 'never', 'completely', 'avoidable', 'societies', 'calling', 'can', 'prove', 'disastrous', 'walls', 'build', 'family', 'figurative', 'literal', '.Now', 'find', 'kind', 'odd', 'one', 'critical', 'praises', 'cover', 'DVD', 'hilarious', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'film', 'funny', 'least', 'not', 'overtly', 'intentionally', 'mean', 'yes', 'situations', 'are', 'bizarre', 'enough', 'warrant', 'smirk', 'smirk', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'smirk', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'horribly', 'uncomfortable', 'many', 'scenes', 'actions', 'parents', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve', 'laughter', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'withstand', 'direction', 'film', 'address', 'VERY', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'such', 'prostitution', 'brainwashing', 'cultist', 'practices', 'even', 'incest', 'lighter', 'air', 'film', 'certainly', 'situations', 'more', 'palatable', 'can', 'even', 'say', 'definite', 'uneasiness', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'brother', 'simulating', 'sex', 'sister.Still', 'message', 'here', 'that', 'deeper', 'assumed', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'strict', 'children', 'obvious', 'mental', 'departure', 'existent', 'parents', 'go', 'extreme', 'shelter', 'minds', 'children', 'point', 'intoxicating', 'love', 'bounds', 'matter', 'how', 'sick', 'demented.This', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'generally', 'entertained', 'shatteringly', 'deep', 'questions', 'highlights', 'themes', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'extreme', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciated']",N/A

The original story and structure will keep you focused and interested or at least it kept me, never failing to surprise in the next scene, and the next and the next.  It is all right for you to ask: What is going on? What is wrong with this picture? You might never find the answer, because the film is so unique, dark and unpredictable, that you might never even care, you just want to see what will happen next.  A nameless PATER NOSTER like head of a secluded family is distorting the reality and playing mind games with his teenage children, while the mother dutifully complies.  A testament to ""we only know, what THEY tell us"" the rest we will imagine.  That is exactly what the almost innocent two nameless girls and a nameless boy will do to entrance you for over 90 minutes.  I don't think it was meant to be incestuous, but it turned out to be and it is very clear from this Tarkovsky meet Pasolini meet George Orwell blend, that we, human animals will do what we need and can do to become free.  It is a metaphor for so many things in life, and a lesson for so many who try to shield children from reality, from reason, from living.  Distorting reality, feeding people with lies and taking liberties away, will almost sure end in a disaster.  This beautifully photographed, well-acted and amazingly directed film is not easy to digest or even to watch at times but it will make you talk about it, hate it or love it.

Velasquez,"[3, 4]","Nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 83rd Academy Awards, ""Dogtooth"" is one special, intriguing film that avoids categorization, as it has been described hilarious by some and falling into the dark comedy genre by others. I, however, place it into the drama realm, due to its heavy subject matter. It is one electrifying and engaging experience that you will not forget for a while.The film questions what would happen if parents raise their children without leaving the premises and safety of their home. To that effect, director Yorgos Lanthimos creates an environment in which the patriarch of the house is Mr. Petrou (Christos Stergioglou), who handles his family, especially his two daughters (Aggeliki Papoulia - the older, Mary Tsoni - the younger) and his son (Hristos Passalis), in a strict fashion. They have been so brainwashed by their parents about the exterior environments, that they have grown accustomed to not question them. The mother (Michele Valley), however, has more liberty, which includes the use of the only phone in the house - their children don't even know how to use one. As expected, the son apparently is beginning to have sexual urges, so his father, who works in town and provides for his family, hires a female co-worker (Anna Kalaitzidou, who appears nude most of the film) to sexually satisfy the young man. This act, in the long-run, disturbs the peace in the house, creating a tension that will have consequences.Watching ""Dogtooth,"" Arturo Ripstein's ""El Castillo de la Pureza"" (Castle of Purity, 1973), Mexico's almost forgotten classic, came to mind. Both films work on the same idea, both are dark in their contents, but ""Dogtooth"" has a surreal feeling to it, caused by some of the weird situations presented in some scenes - some of them having a meaning that we have to figure out. You can imagine how fun was for Lanthimos and his staff to keep coming up with ideas for scenes in the movie, which deservedly won the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The excellent Blu-ray edition of this film includes an interview with the director, deleted scenes, trailer, and more.

This includes creating a false ""monster"" to scare them into compliance. In ""Dogtooth"" you have a similar situation but more weird and extreme. Here, a father has his son and two daughters locked up in a walled in, remote estate. They have no notion of what lies beyond the walls and dad (as well as mom) create imaginary threats to make certain their kids have no desire to venture out.Dad is a pretty screwed up guy and mom isn't much better. The effort they need to expend to keep up the ruse is formidable. They need to alter the language so words like telephone aren't known. They have a telephone but mom has it hidden away. They also need to make up a real wild scenario for when the kids see an airplane fly over. It's totally weirded out. Mom and dad's sex life is strange at best but they realize sonny boy needs sex so they arrange for that with one of dad's co-workers. When that goes south the next solution is too bizarre to imagine. Funny how they don't consider the sexuality of their daughters.That being said, their kids aren't stupid and try to fill in the blanks. This takes a really bizarre turn when the one daughter gets hold of some VHS movies of ""Jaws', ""Rocky"" and ""Flashdance."" It's all coming apart at the seams and manifesting itself in violent, self destructive ways.This movie isn't for everyone. First off, it's foreign. Second off, it's really weird.

The production values might not be ""A-List"" Hollywood but they're good enough to draw the viewer in without distractions. The acting is good.

Clever script in this sense, for the viewer is gradually immersed in that environment.  Decent camera work, even humorous at times.Flat: A bit redundant and overdone in some ways.Negative: The director overdoes some scenes, as if he gets too excited by how clever the plot is.Suggestion:  Take away some 'action' and let more things evolve, just like with the flying and dropping airplanes.

A father keeps his kids in a nice secluded estate, screws with their heads, teaches them incorrect vocabulary terms.Far worse things have been done by fathers to their children in far worse conditions. Both In reality and film. I'm sure there are millions of people who would gladly trade places with these people.If this is supposed to be an allegory about the horrors of totalitarianism, why bother? There are hundreds of films that deal directly with the subject, and are better films. Go watch 1984, Brazil, or Flame and Citroen or Twin Sisters if you need something that isn't in English.And if you want to see the horrors that can happen when children are kept in seclusion by family, try Flowers in the Attic for pompous ridiculousness. Or the Shining. That one is also supposed to be an allegory about totalitarianism.So why the critical acclaim?This movie shows an outwardly normal bourgeois business man who feels the need to be a petty tyrant over his family to feel manly and powerful. The politically left leaning film industry loves that kind of stuff. Multiply this man by a few million and you get Nazi Germany!The blandness of the characters and the not very good cinematography are confused with a sardonic deadpan mockery of the father-king. The lack of connection to the outside world is not considered a flaw, but is confused with a sense of ""it can happen anywhere"".But as I said, in this movie ""anywhere"" is very nice, a large house with a large backyard, including an inground swimming pool, patio, ornamental trees and such. This is not a one bedroom apartment in the bad part of Baltimore where a single mother leaves her 13 year old daughter to tend to the three younger siblings while she trades sex for crack, and trades sex with her daughter for more crack.Honestly, though I can't speak from personal experience but know people who have experienced such things, to say this film is about totalitarianism is an insult to those who have truly suffered under genuine totalitarian regimes and those killed by them. And, yes, this is child abuse, but millions of children have suffered more. This should not be considered to stand for such cases.Ultimately it is the lack of substance and connections that allows those wishing to do so to link this film to grand themes. Some might say that's a great defense against being bored by this film.If you have that defense mechanism, take a look.

The man and two women cast as the children would never pass as teenagers. The oldest girl is about thirty. However, that is just as well because if these three were under eighteen this would be child pornography.The supposed plot of this movie is one of child abuse; emotional abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and to a lesser extent physical abuse. These types of abuse are not new to film, but normally there is some rationale for the actions of the abuser. The rationale may only make sense to the abuser, but something is given as a way for the abuser to justify his behavior in his own mind. This movie does not give any rationale.In my opinion the above plot is only an excuse to show the sex scenes, and there are several sex scenes and extensive nudity. As for nudity, every body part is seen a minimum of three times. As for sex; twice explicit sex is seen in addition to a couple of other sex scenes which are more graphic than is normal for movies not considered pornography.

1385070,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B0044GAQ1O,Kevin F. Tasker,"[5, 9]","Dogtooth is a dark and brooding film, slow, vaguely intellectual, and containing a lot of nudity.  It centers on a family whose goofy but demonic patriarch is intent on keeping his children locked inside their Greek homestead for unknown reasons. Perhaps just a sociological experiment? Whatever the reason, the man's special breed of anti-love warps his children quite profoundly. They are essentially shells of human beings, with interest in only tangential elements of the outside world. The brother and sisters (known by their status, oldest-youngest and late in the movie, a self-applied monicker of one of the girls- ""Bruce"") communicate by way of a language taught to them by their spooky-eyed, fairly ineffectual mother. They have been indoctrinated to believe other odd realities as well, such as that cats are guardians of the outside world and especially malevolent entities to be dispatched in any manner possible.The film takes place over a few days in the lives of the children as they are cut off further and further from the outside world. Concessions that have been made by the father, such as a allowing a security guard woman from his work to come to the house to fulfill his son's sexual desires, backfire violently. The slow nature of the film makes the explosions of violence all the more grueling and intense. Though the front of the DVD box includes blurbs from critics citing the film as ""HILARIOUS"", this couldn't be further from the truth. I'd say quirky, perhaps. Maybe even ""occasionally amusing in a pitch black, family sex and child abuse sort of way"". I suppose that wouldn't look so endearing on the DVD.This film certainly lays forth a very convincing and well-developed vision. The acting is excellent. The children, the daughters in particular, seem alien in all respects, particularly their eyes, which convey in blank, sad stares their internal conflict regarding their home-life. Technically too, the film is well done for an Indie feature, complete with a nice bleak existential ending. That said, it is not exactly a fun film by any stretch, nor is it particularly ""entertaining"" in any conventional sense. There are moments of thankful levity, such as when the daughters dance for their parents' anniversary, but even these are undercut by an overwhelming sense of home-spun despair, as the daughter dances her way into spasms on the floor then wolfs down some cake while her parents look on approvingly.While the film is intentionally devoid of real emotion, I found myself deeply resentful of the father by the time it all ended. He is clearly a criminal and a brutal figure. The woman at his side is culpable and weak. I pitied the three children, whose lives have been completely ruined by the linguistic mind-games and related sadism inflicted upon them by their parental units. While it is interesting in some ways to see what happens to people who have been separated by society and the influence of language, the film leaves quite a bitter taste, not unlike a barbell smacking into your gums.",3,"Existential, darkly surreal, incestuous, somewhat ""interesting...""",1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,3042,"['Dogtooth', 'dark', 'brooding', 'film', 'slow', 'vaguely', 'intellectual', 'containing', 'lot', 'nudity', 'family', 'goofy', 'demonic', 'patriarch', 'intent', 'keeping', 'children', 'locked', 'Greek', 'homestead', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'sociological', 'experiment', 'reason', 'man', 'special', 'breed', 'anti-love', 'warps', 'children', 'quite', 'profoundly', 'are', 'essentially', 'shells', 'human', 'beings', 'interest', 'only', 'tangential', 'elements', 'outside', 'world', 'brother', 'sisters', 'known', 'status', 'oldest-youngest', 'late', 'movie', 'self-applied', 'monicker', 'one', 'girls-', 'Bruce', 'communicate', 'way', 'language', 'taught', 'spooky-eyed', 'fairly', 'ineffectual', 'mother', 'have', 'been', 'indoctrinated', 'believe', 'other', 'odd', 'realities', 'well', 'such', 'cats', 'are', 'guardians', 'outside', 'world', 'especially', 'malevolent', 'entities', 'be', 'dispatched', 'manner', 'possible.The', 'film', 'place', 'few', 'days', 'lives', 'children', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'further', 'further', 'outside', 'world', 'Concessions', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'father', 'such', 'allowing', 'security', 'guard', 'woman', 'work', 'come', 'house', 'fulfill', 'son', 'sexual', 'desires', 'backfire', 'violently', 'slow', 'nature', 'film', 'explosions', 'violence', 'more', 'grueling', 'intense', 'front', 'DVD', 'box', 'blurbs', 'critics', 'citing', 'film', 'HILARIOUS', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', ""'d"", 'say', 'quirky', 'perhaps', 'Maybe', 'even', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'pitch', 'black', 'family', 'sex', 'child', 'abuse', 'sort', 'way', 'suppose', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'endearing', 'DVD.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'forth', 'very', 'convincing', 'well-developed', 'vision', 'acting', 'excellent', 'children', 'daughters', 'particular', 'seem', 'alien', 'respects', 'particularly', 'eyes', 'convey', 'blank', 'sad', 'stares', 'internal', 'conflict', 'regarding', 'home-life', 'Technically', 'too', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'Indie', 'feature', 'complete', 'nice', 'bleak', 'existential', 'ending', 'said', 'not', 'exactly', 'fun', 'film', 'stretch', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'conventional', 'sense', 'are', 'moments', 'thankful', 'levity', 'such', 'when', 'daughters', 'dance', 'parents', 'anniversary', 'even', 'are', 'undercut', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'home-spun', 'despair', 'daughter', 'way', 'spasms', 'floor', 'then', 'wolfs', 'down', 'cake', 'parents', 'look', 'film', 'intentionally', 'devoid', 'real', 'emotion', 'found', 'deeply', 'resentful', 'father', 'time', 'ended', 'clearly', 'criminal', 'brutal', 'figure', 'woman', 'side', 'culpable', 'weak', 'pitied', 'three', 'children', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'ruined', 'linguistic', 'mind-games', 'related', 'sadism', 'inflicted', 'parental', 'units', 'interesting', 'ways', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'society', 'influence', 'language', 'film', 'quite', 'bitter', 'taste', 'not', 'barbell', 'smacking', 'gums']",N/A

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[54, 59]","Certainly one of the more surprising moments of the 2010 Academy Award nominations had to be the inclusion of the Greek oddity ""Dogtooth"" among the Best Foreign Film nominees.  This psychological freak show seems designed to polarize audiences with its controversial presentation of an isolated family as a horror construct.  The film, with relatively no political or social context, is likely to be interpreted in many ways by viewers searching for a grand significance to the proceedings.  Having seen the film twice now, however, I'm not sure that I can really establish the filmmaker's true intentions with any veracity.  So I won't try.  Somewhere between perverse satire, bent domestic drama, and disturbing psychological horror lies the film ""Dogtooth""--a challenging and unrepentantly bleak, yet undeniably gripping and fascinating, example of experimental cinema.""Dogtooth"" depicts the unorthodox life of one family.  The three teenage children have been raised in a controlled environment in which they've seemingly never left the family's secluded estate.  Subjected to the teaching of their parents, they know nothing of the real dangers or inherent freedoms available in the outside world.  As their story unfolds, in horrifying daily detail, the complete destruction of their psyches, intelligence, and individuality at the hands of their parents is absolutely repellant.  This truly is one of the more disturbing depictions of psychological torture (even if the kids don't know it!) that has ever been captured on film.  Not graphically violent, but emotionally disconcerting, this film will insinuate itself into your mind--and it's absolutely unsettling.  One girl, in particular, starts to act out in increasingly violent ways and, as much as we do want to protect them, kids will grow up to experience life in ways we might not have intended.To be sure, I love to be surprised by film--the more offbeat or skewed the better.  In describing a movie's narrative for others, I try to only paint a picture in broad strokes and not spoil the mysteries yet to unfold.  That's why I've been purposefully vague in my description (although, there is some controversial sexual content which might offend certain viewers).  With ""Dogtooth,"" however, I might make a disclaimer.  This will not be a film for everyone--those that dislike ""Dogtooth"" will invariably hate it with every fiber of their being!  Those that like ""Dogtooth,"" however, will be caught up in a story unlike any other.  I was unable to pull my eyes away from this film.

The cover of the DVD and the sypnosis on the back cover got my attention and I was excited to see it. Well, like they always say, don't judge a book blah blah....spoilers below...This is the bizarre story of a very strange Greek couple who keep their kids (boy and two sisters) imprisoned in their sprawling home to ''protect them from the evil influences of the outside world"". The father brings home a prostitute occasionally to satisfy the boy's sexual appetite (guys don't get excited, every sex scene in this movie is horrible and none of the females are into it, they just lay there and its far from erotic). The sisters seem starved for any type of ''gifts'', and the prostitute tends to bargain with them if they go down on her (again, fellas, don't get it twisted these scenes suck and arent sexy). The father is a creep who occasionally beats the sisters a few times by whacking them with objects across the head. The term 'dogtooth', hence the title of the film, seems to refer to the notion that the parents tell their kids that if they lose a dogtooth, they're ready for the outside world. At the end, one of the girls knocks her tooth out with a dumbbell over a sink (probably the only decent scene of the film as it is gory and realistic), runs to the car outside and hides in the trunk, presumably to escape her pathetic existance. The film ends by showing the trunk of the car far away from the home.Dogtooth is a dull, boring movie with no music or sound effects. 95% of it takes place at the home, both indoors and out.

1385078,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0044GAQ1O,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""Dogtooth"" (2009 release from Greece; 94 min.) brings the disturbing yet harrowing tale of a family of 5, living in a large isolated compound somewhere in Greece. After some initially confusing scenes, the picture that emerges becomes clear: for reasons not explained, the teenage kids (one son, two daughters) are raised by their parents in complete isolation from the outside world. The only contact they have is with Christina, a security guard at dad's company whom dad brings along once in a while to the compound to ""take care"" of the son. If and when one of the teenage kids hears a term they are not familiar with, the parents simply make something up, and hence a ""telephone"" becomes a salt shaker, and a ""zombie"" becomes a small yellow flower. The turning point in the movie is when Christina gives two VHS videos to one of the daughters (as we'll find out later, they are Rocky and Flashdance) and the daughter secretly watches the movies. Will Christina provide more information about/access to the outside world? Will the teenage kids ever leave the compound? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this is a remarkable movie on many levels. As the movie first started playing out, I was reminded of a similar, apparently nihilistic, future that was portrayed in Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". The swipes at mind control, if not worse, are obvious. It is amazing how people, in the absence of any context, can adapt to other settings (the ""zombie is a yellow flower"" reference is one example). The director Yorgos Lanthimos shows immediate promise with this movie, his debut. Please be sure to check out the 15 min. interview with the director that appears as one of the bonus materials on the DVD, it is very insighful.Not surprisingly, this movie was nominated for the 2010 Oscar for Best Foreign Movie (it did not win). Highly original, yet challenging but always entertaining, this movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. ""Dogtooth"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"4.5 stars...

The message is one of enclosed despair, it mirrors what it's like to be perpetually condemned to a preverbal state, and not having the tools to deal with it.  It seems that, once play can no longer sustain oneself, one must retreat to a world of sexuality and aggression.  Since the eldest daughter incorporated the nameless and hopeless lifestyle imposed by her parents, she was indeed an incarnation of their nefarious deeds.  The only way to break free from their rules would be to attack their rules, and this could only be accomplished by attacking herself.  The scene where she knocks her tooth out with a hammer is intense and realistic, yet behind pain and destruction there is beauty, in the disfigured and bloody smile leering back from the mirror.  Life could no longer go on the way it had, the incestuous nature of the family unit had reached an extreme.  In a bizarre bathtub scene, the brother sits there and gropes the naked bodies of his sisters, one at a time, I imagine in an attempt to see which causes him to be more aroused.  As everything else that conveys true emotion in this family, the scene transpires in uncomfortable silence, the demon of preverbal communication again casting its shadow.  Born preverbal, dead preverbal, as the labyrinth of abandoned speech is manifest in the eldest daughter's aborted escape, remaining locked in the car trunk, representing in a very vivid manner that, upon mustering the desire to leave the perverted Eden in whence she dwelled, she was in effect entering her coffin.",5,Mirroring destruction,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,1649,"['Spoilers', 'herein', 'Well', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'had', 'won', 'un', 'Certain', 'Regard', 'prize', 'Cannes', 'message', 'one', 'enclosed', 'despair', 'what', 'be', 'perpetually', 'condemned', 'preverbal', 'state', 'not', 'having', 'tools', 'deal', 'once', 'play', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'sustain', 'must', 'retreat', 'world', 'sexuality', 'aggression', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'incorporated', 'nameless', 'hopeless', 'lifestyle', 'imposed', 'parents', 'was', 'indeed', 'incarnation', 'nefarious', 'deeds', 'only', 'way', 'break', 'free', 'rules', 'would', 'be', 'attack', 'rules', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'accomplished', 'attacking', 'scene', 'where', 'tooth', 'out', 'hammer', 'intense', 'realistic', 'yet', 'pain', 'destruction', 'beauty', 'disfigured', 'bloody', 'smile', 'leering', 'back', 'mirror', 'Life', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'go', 'way', 'had', 'incestuous', 'nature', 'family', 'unit', 'had', 'reached', 'extreme', 'bizarre', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'brother', 'there', 'naked', 'bodies', 'sisters', 'one', 'time', 'imagine', 'attempt', 'see', 'be', 'more', 'aroused', 'everything', 'else', 'conveys', 'true', 'emotion', 'family', 'scene', 'transpires', 'uncomfortable', 'silence', 'demon', 'preverbal', 'communication', 'again', 'casting', 'shadow', 'Born', 'preverbal', 'dead', 'preverbal', 'labyrinth', 'abandoned', 'speech', 'manifest', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'aborted', 'escape', 'remaining', 'locked', 'car', 'trunk', 'representing', 'very', 'vivid', 'manner', 'mustering', 'desire', 'leave', 'perverted', 'Eden', 'whence', 'dwelled', 'was', 'effect', 'entering', 'coffin']",N/A

Periodically, the industrialist pimps for the boy, and for a price, procures the services of Christina, a security guard at the plant.Just when Director Giorgos Lanthimos seems to remove all limits to the level of parental control, Christina shows an interest not only in the boy but also the two sisters, conferring on one of them VHS tapes of Rocky, Jaws and other classics in exchange for libidinous favors.  The daughter, of course, emulates what she sees and hears on the tapes, and such an obvious clash of cultures ensues that it changes the relationships in the household.

And what if, in that universe, you could have absolute control over your subjects, so that, not only would they have to do what you told them to, but you could even go so far as to shape the very way they look at the world?The unnamed middle-aged protagonist (Christos Stergioglou) of ""Dogtooth"" has created just such a kingdom for himself and his wife (Michelle Valley), tucked away in a rural area of Greece, where the two of them have raised their children - a boy (Christos Passalis) and two girls (Aggelika Papoulia, Mary Tsoni) who are all now in their late teens - in such complete isolation that the kids have virtually no knowledge of the world that lies beyond the fenced-in little compound in which they live.  They know only that it is a dangerous and scary place and that none of them will be able to venture out into it until their dogtooth falls out - which is to say never.  They are so misinformed as to how the real world actually works that they think planes are just tiny objects moving through the air, and that if one of those tiny objects were to fall out of the sky and into their yard, the children would be able to pick it up and play with it like a toy.  They've also been taught by their colluding parents to believe that prowling cats are a mortal menace to be destroyed on sight.  The kids spend much of the day doing repetitive chores, playing meaningless games and being taught an incorrect vocabulary (they use the word ""phone"" when they really mean ""salt,"" for example). The father regularly pays a young woman (Anna Kalaitzidu) he works with - the only person from the outside world the children are allowed to meet - to come and have sex with his post-pubescent son, and severely beats the kids every time they step out of line.A stunning allegory about the evils of totalitarianism, ""Dogtooth"" is somewhat reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" in its basic premise and setup, only here the guiding principle seems to be less about protecting the young ones from the harsh realities of a modern world and more about this one man's finding a way to achieve a kind of apotheosis for himself - making himself a god in the eyes of his children.  For not only does he make them reliant on him for all the basic necessities of life, but he's made it so that they accept without question the ""truths"" of the physical and moral order he's established for them to live by.The man and his wife have together inverted and perverted the very definition of parenthood.  Rather than grooming their children for an adult life in the real world, these parents deliberately infantilize their offspring, making it virtually impossible for them to leave the home and start a life of their own. This ensures that the kids will be there to take care of them for the rest of their lives.On a broader scale, the movie is a searing indictment of the power of propaganda, showing how easy it is to mislead people and to compel them to do what one wants simply by feeding them false information and, thus, skewing their view of realty and the truth.  And isn't this how totalitarian dictatorships are born and sustained?  But there's also an innate desire for liberty and independence lurking in the recesses of every human soul that must finally assert itself in a desperate run for freedom, and the movie addresses that reality as well.The movie is both raw and provocative as it takes on some rather touchy sexual themes - mainly involving incest - that some in the audience may find disturbing and discomfiting to put it mildly.  There's also a fair amount of full-frontal nudity, brutal violence and more-than-simulated sex scenes in the movie.Yorgos Lanthimos' direction is spare and stripped-down, as befits a parable, with off-kilter visual framing that heightens the bizarre nature of the piece.""Dogtooth"" is unnerving, thought-provoking and provocative - and a must-see for the unconventional, adventurous movie-watcher.",4,a stunning allegory about totalitarianism and propaganda,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,4077,"['****1/2What', 'could', 'be', 'master', 'own', 'universe', 'able', 'make', 'everything', 'own', 'specifications', 'liking', 'what', 'universe', 'could', 'have', 'absolute', 'control', 'subjects', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'told', 'could', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'shape', 'very', 'way', 'look', 'world', 'unnamed', 'middle-aged', 'protagonist', 'Christos', 'Stergioglou', 'Dogtooth', 'created', 'just', 'kingdom', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'Valley', 'tucked', 'away', 'rural', 'area', 'Greece', 'where', 'two', 'have', 'raised', 'children', 'boy', 'Christos', 'Passalis', 'two', 'girls', 'Aggelika', 'Papoulia', 'Mary', 'Tsoni', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'late', 'teens', 'such', 'complete', 'isolation', 'kids', 'have', 'virtually', 'knowledge', 'world', 'fenced-in', 'little', 'compound', 'live', 'know', 'only', 'dangerous', 'scary', 'place', 'none', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'venture', 'out', 'dogtooth', 'out', 'say', 'never', 'are', 'so', 'misinformed', 'how', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'think', 'planes', 'are', 'just', 'tiny', 'objects', 'moving', 'air', 'one', 'tiny', 'objects', 'were', 'fall', 'sky', 'yard', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'play', 'toy', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'taught', 'colluding', 'parents', 'believe', 'prowling', 'cats', 'are', 'mortal', 'menace', 'be', 'destroyed', 'sight', 'kids', 'spend', 'much', 'day', 'doing', 'repetitive', 'chores', 'playing', 'meaningless', 'games', 'being', 'taught', 'incorrect', 'vocabulary', 'use', 'word', 'phone', 'when', 'really', 'mean', 'salt', 'example', 'father', 'regularly', 'young', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Kalaitzidu', 'only', 'person', 'outside', 'world', 'children', 'are', 'allowed', 'meet', 'come', 'have', 'sex', 'post-pubescent', 'son', 'severely', 'kids', 'time', 'step', 'line.A', 'stunning', 'allegory', 'evils', 'totalitarianism', 'Dogtooth', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'basic', 'premise', 'setup', 'only', 'here', 'guiding', 'principle', 'be', 'less', 'protecting', 'young', 'ones', 'harsh', 'realities', 'modern', 'world', 'more', 'one', 'man', 'finding', 'way', 'achieve', 'kind', 'apotheosis', 'making', 'god', 'eyes', 'children', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'reliant', 'basic', 'necessities', 'life', 'made', 'so', 'accept', 'question', 'truths', 'physical', 'moral', 'order', 'established', 'live', 'by.The', 'man', 'wife', 'have', 'together', 'inverted', 'perverted', 'very', 'definition', 'parenthood', 'Rather', 'grooming', 'children', 'adult', 'life', 'real', 'world', 'parents', 'deliberately', 'infantilize', 'offspring', 'making', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'leave', 'home', 'start', 'life', 'own', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'take', 'care', 'rest', 'lives.On', 'broader', 'scale', 'movie', 'searing', 'indictment', 'power', 'propaganda', 'showing', 'how', 'easy', 'mislead', 'people', 'compel', 'do', 'what', 'one', 'simply', 'feeding', 'false', 'information', 'thus', 'skewing', 'view', 'realty', 'truth', ""n't"", 'how', 'totalitarian', 'dictatorships', 'are', 'born', 'sustained', 'also', 'innate', 'desire', 'liberty', 'independence', 'lurking', 'recesses', 'human', 'soul', 'must', 'finally', 'assert', 'desperate', 'run', 'freedom', 'movie', 'reality', 'well.The', 'movie', 'raw', 'provocative', 'rather', 'touchy', 'sexual', 'themes', 'mainly', 'involving', 'incest', 'audience', 'may', 'find', 'disturbing', 'discomfiting', 'put', 'mildly', 'also', 'fair', 'amount', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'brutal', 'violence', 'more-than-simulated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie.Yorgos', 'Lanthimos', 'direction', 'spare', 'stripped-down', 'befits', 'parable', 'off-kilter', 'visual', 'framing', 'bizarre', 'nature', 'piece', 'Dogtooth', 'unnerving', 'thought-provoking', 'provocative', 'must-see', 'unconventional', 'adventurous', 'movie-watcher']",N/A

After viewing it a number of times,I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. Dogtooth is a tricky film to define. I would say it's a dark comedy/psychological thriller but then again...That's me. Dogtooth follows the lives of three teenagers, a boy and his two sisters, and their manipulative patients. The teenagers are not allowed outside the confines of their home and constantly have to compete with each other in order to prove their worth to their mother and father.The conflict of the film is when a ""babysitter"" in brought into to the house to serve as the son's prostitute. What the parents don't know is that the babysitter sneaks in videotapes in order to ""befriend"" the two sisters. This starts a chain of events that leads to the children to start acting a little strange(I should say, Stranger than usual), in subtle and not so subtle ways. Dogtooth is an excellent film. It's an powerful statement on how much impact parents influence has on a child's mental health. It's dark and disturbing and has a nasty habit of staying in the back of your mind.What I enjoyed most was the creative ways used to show how ignorant the children are. Whenever a plane flies over their house, the kids run around like mad and the parents throw a little plastic plane when the kids aren't looking. The child that finds the plastic plane triumphantly presents it to their father in exchange for a sticker. They really believe that they found the plane that was just flying over their yard. Dogtooth is disturbing, completing and at times amusing.

Watching the film is like stumbling upon an unspeakable secret of someone close to you. You just cannot tear yourself away from it in spite of, or because of, the uncomfortable nature of the things that you see. You want to forget it, but you just can't. Some films are made that way, and ""Dogteeth"" is one of them.What you see in this 2009 Greek film is an unnamed family living in a spacey suburban house with a large garden and a swimming pool. The family - a father, a mother and three children (one brother and two sisters) - are leading a life cut off from the world outside. For the children, ""sea"" is the leather chair with wooden armrests, as they study from an old cassette tape. Also, an airplane is something small that occasionally ""drops"" onto the garden.The strange equilibrium (elegantly captured by Thimios Bakatakis's beautiful photography) is about to change when a young woman Christina arrives. Her presence unwittingly brings new dynamics into this strictly controlled environment. In short, the kids learn how to cheat, deceive and resist in their own way.The film has graphic sexual and violent contents that are meant not just to surprise us; they will also make us feel there are some desires that are going on inside the children, or forces that parents cannot eradicate or suppress. Probably the parents know their existence. The boy's sexual needs are taken care of, but those of the girls are apparently left unnoticed or simply ignored.Many people say ""Dogteeth"" is a bizarre film.

There is no way to describe the plot, nor should I, since part of the experience of Dogtooth is trying to decipher exactly what one is watching. I will volunteer only, since you'll find this on the DVD case or film synopsis, that it involves a family living mostly apart from the outside world, within a walled compound. The film is in Greek and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It won Best Film in the ""Un Certain Regard"" category at Cannes, and was nominated for an Academy Award in the best foreign language film category.Filmed mostly with static camera shots, naturalistic, with no screen music except what comes from radios, phonographs, or the characters themselves. Frequently the actors are partly outside the frame, their heads or the tops of heads cut off. It is, in a sense, an anti-film. Nothing you will see is predictable. The flow of the narrative is punctuated sometimes by disturbing outbreaks of violence, and the few sex scenes are completely matter of fact, realistic, yet bizarre and unsettling.If you take this one on, be prepared for a stretch and a challenge. You may feel, at the end,as shut off from meaning as if you had just spent an hour and a half on another planet.I have my ideas of what the movie is trying to say, but it probably will have a different meaning for others. For references in tone, I might suggest the films of Michael Haneke, or ""Gummo"" by Harmony Korine. For some reason, while watching, I was reminded of an equally strange Todd Haynes film called ""Safe,"" perhaps by the growing sense of isolation that the film imparts.
