1186226,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001EQPD0Q,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[16, 17]","Two teenagers, Jake and Kyle, camping out under the rural ""Arizona Sky"" (2008), realize what they feel for each other is much more than ""best buddies.""  But Jake's father is forcing him to move away the next day, and Kyle is afraid of others finding out about their relationship, so they never get the chance to express their love physically.Fast forward fifteen years, and Jake is a successful filmmaker in Hollywood, a job that has more than its share of 24/7 pressure.  The job's demanding nature actually made it easier for him to excuse the fact that he had no social life, and is, indeed, still aching over the unrequitted love for Kyle.  At the urging of his straight best friend and roommate, they take a week off and go back to visit Jake's home town, and he looks up Kyle, who still lives in that town.  Does Kyle still feel the same way, and is there any chance they can pick up where they left off so many years ago?Director Jeff London is known for these overdone syrup-sweet gay romances, and this is better than most, including some great casting.  The young actors who play the leads as teens have a real chemistry, and actually resemble Eric Dean (Jake) and Jayme McCabe (Kyle) who play them as adults.  The supporting cast is also excellent, but all suffer a bit from the heavy-handed direction.  The sound is a bit strange, as the microphones seem to be switched on to capture a line, then turned off immediately, so background noise comes and goes with it.  DVD has director/actor commentary and chapter stops only.  Overall, it is a pleasant film, and I'd give it four stars out of five.",4,Slightly overdone tale of unrequitted love revisited,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1608,"['Two', 'teenagers', 'Jake', 'Kyle', 'camping', 'out', 'rural', 'Arizona', 'Sky', '2008', 'realize', 'what', 'feel', 'other', 'much', 'more', 'best', 'buddies', 'Jake', 'father', 'forcing', 'move', 'away', 'next', 'day', 'Kyle', 'afraid', 'others', 'finding', 'out', 'relationship', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'express', 'love', 'physically.Fast', 'forward', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Jake', 'successful', 'filmmaker', 'Hollywood', 'job', 'more', 'share', '24/7', 'pressure', 'job', 'demanding', 'nature', 'actually', 'made', 'easier', 'excuse', 'fact', 'had', 'social', 'life', 'indeed', 'still', 'aching', 'unrequitted', 'love', 'Kyle', 'urging', 'straight', 'best', 'friend', 'roommate', 'take', 'week', 'off', 'go', 'back', 'visit', 'Jake', 'home', 'town', 'up', 'Kyle', 'who', 'still', 'town', 'Does', 'Kyle', 'still', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'there', 'chance', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'London', 'known', 'overdone', 'syrup-sweet', 'gay', 'romances', 'better', 'most', 'including', 'great', 'casting', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'leads', 'teens', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'actually', 'resemble', 'Eric', 'Dean', 'Jake', 'Jayme', 'McCabe', 'Kyle', 'who', 'play', 'adults', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'suffer', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'sound', 'bit', 'strange', 'microphones', 'seem', 'be', 'switched', 'capture', 'line', 'then', 'turned', 'off', 'immediately', 'so', 'background', 'noise', 'DVD', 'director/actor', 'commentary', 'chapter', 'stops', 'only', 'Overall', 'pleasant', 'film', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'five']",Arizona Sky
1186227,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B001EQPD0Q,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[0, 0]","A friend shared this film with me - not as a must see, but to resell online.  Of course I was curious to see this film that has reviewers split down the middle between the best and the worst film they have ever rated.What I found was an incredible story line - that probably speaks to many a viewer.  The film is about the friendships we make as teenagers, and how life gets in the way of finding who and what we really love.  This is a story of conflict - country vs. city - happiness vs. being content - family values vs. truth in ourselves. The film never eludes to a specific time or place, referencing only 'the city'. The film opens as we meet Kyle and Jake as teenagers celebrating a friendship, and mourning the pending move of Jake with his family. It gently references sexual energy, tastefully and with only a single kiss, on the lips.  It speaks of a time and a place where anything out of the norm was not accepted.  If you were a young person pre-1990's, you'll understand the angst and pain in young Jake's face as he spends one last night camping with his best buddy.Jump ahead 15 plus years, and we find Jake living the big life - but not a happy one.  A stress filled job fulfills his financial needs, but his heart is empty. He decides after all these years to return to the small town he left decades ago, to find his friend Kyle, with whom he lost contact.  Upon his return, he finds Kyle living a remarkably different life from Jake.  The two recollect, share their lives, and a story of friendship and love unfolds.If the film had the production budget of Brokeback Mountain, we could have experienced a stellar story set with a remarkable soundtrack and unlimited props.  The film is low-budget in production, but high on content.  Trust me, I'll take content anytime over budget (just look for my review of War of the Worlds).  The content and quality of the story are moving, emotional and compassionate.  Acting ranges from good to excellent, like in most films.  Editing is limited, and some scenes probably could have been cut.  If you're looking for your typical gay-themed love story complete with sex, skip this film.  If you're looking for a slow moving film about following your heart, see Arizona Sky.But in the end, you have a touching film and story about being happy in your life - about finding true love, about following your dreams and desires.  Is that how life really is?  Maybe not as often as it should be, but the film can serve as in inspiration to those seeking answers.",5,"""Are You Happy?"" in this Slow Moving Tale of Life & Love",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2518,"['friend', 'shared', 'film', 'not', 'must', 'see', 'resell', 'online', 'course', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'film', 'reviewers', 'split', 'down', 'middle', 'best', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'rated.What', 'found', 'was', 'incredible', 'story', 'line', 'probably', 'many', 'viewer', 'film', 'friendships', 'make', 'teenagers', 'how', 'life', 'way', 'finding', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'conflict', 'country', 'vs.', 'city', 'happiness', 'being', 'content', 'family', 'values', 'vs.', 'truth', 'film', 'never', 'specific', 'time', 'place', 'referencing', 'only', ""'the"", 'city', 'film', 'meet', 'Kyle', 'Jake', 'teenagers', 'celebrating', 'friendship', 'mourning', 'pending', 'move', 'Jake', 'family', 'gently', 'sexual', 'energy', 'tastefully', 'only', 'single', 'kiss', 'lips', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'anything', 'norm', 'was', 'not', 'accepted', 'were', 'young', 'person', 'pre-1990', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'angst', 'pain', 'young', 'Jake', 'face', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'camping', 'best', 'buddy.Jump', 'ahead', '15', 'years', 'find', 'Jake', 'living', 'big', 'life', 'not', 'happy', 'one', 'stress', 'filled', 'job', 'fulfills', 'financial', 'needs', 'heart', 'empty', 'years', 'return', 'small', 'town', 'left', 'decades', 'ago', 'find', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'whom', 'lost', 'contact', 'return', 'Kyle', 'living', 'remarkably', 'different', 'life', 'Jake', 'two', 'recollect', 'share', 'lives', 'story', 'friendship', 'love', 'unfolds.If', 'film', 'had', 'production', 'budget', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'stellar', 'story', 'set', 'remarkable', 'soundtrack', 'unlimited', 'props', 'film', 'low-budget', 'production', 'high', 'content', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'take', 'content', 'anytime', 'budget', 'just', 'look', 'review', 'War', 'Worlds', 'content', 'quality', 'story', 'are', 'moving', 'emotional', 'compassionate', 'Acting', 'ranges', 'good', 'excellent', 'most', 'films', 'Editing', 'limited', 'scenes', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', ""'re"", 'looking', 'typical', 'gay-themed', 'love', 'story', 'complete', 'sex', 'skip', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'following', 'heart', 'see', 'Arizona', 'Sky.But', 'end', 'have', 'touching', 'film', 'story', 'being', 'happy', 'life', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'following', 'dreams', 'desires', 'how', 'life', 'really', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'often', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'can', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'seeking', 'answers']",Arizona Sky

1186229,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B001EQPD0Q,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[1, 1]","The story opens with 15 year old best friends ""Jake"" (Blaise Embry) and ""Kyle"" (Kyle Buckland) taking a camping trip to the desert in the wake of circumstances which will soon seperate them. The boys have been best friends for 6 years and have spoken of their love for each other but have never acted on those feelings, as Kyle is deeply fearful that someone else may find out. Jake's father has accepted a position out of state and his family will soon be moving away. Kyle's parents are divorced, his abusive father is no longer in the picture, and he is needed at home with his mother to help make ends meet and keep things together. He knows he will likely be forever stuck in small town Arizona and must keep his life on the down-low to protect his reputation. The boys vow to remain in close contact and visit each other as often as possible. Somehow Jake got too wrapped up making new friends and adjusting to the move that the two boys lost touch completely.Cut to fifteen years later, when Jake as an adult (now played by Eric Dean) is a successful film maker in California and about to break emotionally from the stress of his career. Knowing he needs a break from his daily grind Jake decides to follow his heart back in time and try to reconnect with the best friend he has never stopped loving. He journeys back home to the small town in Arizona in search of Kyle (now played by Jayme McCabe). As the two meet again, even with the help of others and the ambiance in those arizona skies, is there any possibility that Kyle still feels the same about Jake, and can the love they once shared ever truly be rekindled?I absolutely love the original and refreshing scope of this film. There are however some things I found quite disappointing by the execution of the plot. Embry and Buckland give shining performances as the adolescents, as does Dean as the adult Jake. Dean makes a very believable transition into the character now at age 30. Same height, build, hair, similar facial features, personality, etc. He was quite well cast in the part and pulls it off to a tee. McCabe however as the older Kyle simply doesn't fit the role. He is obviously too old to play the part, has the wrong build and doesn't meet the physical characteristics of a 30 year old man who is supposed to be a cowboy, mechanic and cook in a small town restaurant. His personality and manner of speaking is not the same as the younger ""kyle"" and nowhere in the film does he even wear a cowboy hat unlike his younger protege. I felt this film would have been MUCH better with more believable casting for this role. That being said however, it would be unfair to say he didn't try to fit into the role. He gave it his all and definitely attempted to make his character work. A bit overacted at times, but a good performance nonetheless. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the whole film was the absence of footage in the beginning, to lay sufficient background of the strong relationship between the two young characters. As adolescents we see them maybe 8 minutes before the movie progresses to the present time. It simply wasn't enough to set the premise for the love that is trying to be revived 15 years later. Those young tender years needed to be explored much more and allow the viewer to witness the strong bond as it developed. There were several characters which should have been completely edited out altogether as they weren't needed. Kyle's cousin for instance, a poorly acted part which added zero to the content of the plot. Kyle's needy neighbor appeared in a long boring scene that wasn't necessary, as were the scenes with Jake's adult best friend Steve. Patricia Place who played as Kyle's aunt gave a great performance, but her character was given way too much time in the film, and took away from needed time to display the relationship of the two lead characters. Such things as this took away from the film and kept it from coming anywhere near it's potential.In spite of it's many flaws however, the film still works somehow as if the plot were so strong that it insisted on finding a way to be expressed. I am not at all regretful for making this purchase, I absolutely like this film very very much. It is a story that most of us can relate to. Long after viewing the film, my mind reflects on the emotion and strong impression the story made on me. It is a low budget film, so don't try to compare it to some extremely well made movie with great resources spent to ensure a flawless execution of the plot. Judge it simply for what it is and you should enjoy it's refreshing appeal. You will find pieces of it's content that will disappoint, but allow yourself to overlook the flaws and let the true concept of the film work it's magic on you. It will, if you were ever an adolescent exploring love that you simply couldn't quite have the way your heart desired. Innocence sometimes leaves painful scars which we carry for a lifetime. If you've been there, you should be able to relate and enjoy the concept of this film.",4,"""I want to, but people in a small town just have a way of finding out things.""",1306454400,"05 27,

And, although the results aren't brilliant in any way, he definitely deserves a ""most improved"" award.London's 2001 ""...And Then Came Summer"" ranks in my book as one of the worst gay-themed films ever made.  Parts of it are, literally, unbearable to watch.  Thankfully, he's learned a lot in the seven years between that film and ""Arizona Sky"".  Also, thankfully, he hasn't lost any bit of that big heart that he wants to bring to the big screen.Technically, this film has a long way to go.  There are a lot of clunky moments in regards to editing, and the soundtrack is scratchy and amateurish.  Likewise, some of the writing and acting choices left me scratching my head... it's hinted that the character of Kyle is originally from Oklahoma, but his southern drawl is far too prominent, especially for someone who relocated to Arizona as a child.  The references to ""Brokeback Mountain"" simply shouldn't be there, and the confrontational scene with Kyle and his cousin, Heath (Heath???) features the single worst on-screen punch in cinema history.  No lie, it made me laugh out loud.That said - and like so many others here - I couldn't help but like this little film.  There's a sincerity here that's very engaging, a desire to tell us a simple story without a lot of distractions.  And I'll admit that I found myself rooting for the two main characters... that Jake would come to grips with his desire to leave the big city for a simpler life, and that Kyle would come to grips with his long-hidden sexuality.The film works best at its simplest moments.

The actors (Blaise Embry and Kyle Buckland) who portray these characters as teenaged boys do a better job and have better chemistry. However, the film is worth watching for two reasons. One is Patricia Place as the aunt who tells her nephew to come out of the closet and be gay without using either the word closet or gay.

It's the love between the two lead characters that comes first and foremost.

However, there is one scene and one performance in particular that for whatever reason rang absolutely true in my heart and head and left me in tears.

Though handsome, the lead 'adult' actors weren't great - as many other reviewers have said, they either over-acted or under-acted and never seemed genuine.  Rather, both seemed to be forcing their performances without really understanding what they were actually trying to convey, and they didn't have any chemistry - they may as well have been reading monologues in an empty room as facing each other during most of their scenes.And the disappointments didn't end there - aside from a painfully poor script, there was nothing organic or natural about the performances of any of the 'adult' actors, except perhaps the actresses who performed the aunt and the destitute neighbor, both of whom appeared to have done the best with what they were given.  And, that confrontation scene with the cousin - ouch!!!  Watching that scene hurt on so many levels.Conversely, the young teen actors who portrayed the characters as youths were good, they came across as real people.  And their well done entry scene which displayed lots of chemistry between them made the rest of the film that must sadder to see, because the characters you started to care about in that first scene were nowhere to be found in the remainder of the film.  One thing I didn't get was why the writer didn't want them to be able to share a little tenderness for the last time out in the open countryside where no one could see them.  Again, though nicely acted, Kyle's reluctance to share a last embrace with Jake in that scene didn't make any sense.But, I can't say it was all bad, aside from the overall good entry scene, I actually got teary for a moment when the aunt character encouraged Kyle to embrace his chance with Jake - despite the fact that the scene was very contrived and predictable.I don't mind low budget films, or novice actors and I can deal with some cliched dialogue, stilted plot turns, and even some weak direction, but, when all those negative attributes coalesce at the same time, in the same film, the result can be painful to watch.
