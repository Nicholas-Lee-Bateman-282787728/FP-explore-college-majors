1140111,A2Z336TO4FNZKA,B00132D7VI,"Alice Kingsley ""Esmeralda""","[0, 0]","I got this for Christmas 2009. I was wanting to have that because there was a movie Wild Wild West and Kevin Kline  was there and I was about to save money and get it at safeway but I saw this at Smiths and got it as a gift. Back then, I never saw Wild Wild West and I never knew what it was until I was so thrilled and I fell in love.  I watched a little bit of Maverick and it was going well. I bet Wild Wild West is a great Western and Science Fiction movie. My parents rated it a 3 stars but once I saw it, I rate one of them a 5. When I first watched Wild Wild West, I almost didn't recongize my true love in a saloon girl disguise and then  I saw and heard some things and I knew it.  It was so much fun and maybe someone is right, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are really funny together.  I made a quest without watching it and then doing it. I will watch more of Maverick ASAP. And maybe someone is right, My true love Kevin Kline is a Hoot. All of the movies with Kevin Kline have made it fun for me. Why? Because...I'm in love.

1140114,AY12DBB0U420B,B00132D7VI,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","In perusing the DVD bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store, I discovered a western comedy Double Feature disc including ""Maverick"" and ""Wild Wild West."" I bought the disc for Maverick. The two movies come on one disc, one on one side and one on the other. No problem, but it takes a bit of care in handling the disc.The movies are western comedies but couldn't be much more different. I watched ""Maverick"" first because it was a favorite story (both movie and TV) from the past. As you might expect, ""Maverick"" was a droll, tongue-in-cheek type of comedy that was consistently funny throughout and a very amusing movie to watch. ""Wild Wild West"" was a different story. Whether you like this one or not will depend in part on exactly what you are expecting. A good story line? No. Good acting? Not particularly. Good photography? It's okay. I'd have to say the whole movie is totally absurd and parts of it are actually funny. Do you like elaborate gadgets? You'll love the movie. The gadgets and mechanical tricks are a comedy in themselves and very humorous to watch. ""Wild Wild West"" is kinda a semi-worthwhile film and the value would depend on your own tastes. As a Double Feature packet, I'd say the disc is worthwhile.Gary Peterson",4,A Worthwhile Double Feature Packet.,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,1234,"['perusing', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'rack', 'nearby', 'Ross', 'Store', 'discovered', 'western', 'comedy', 'Double', 'Feature', 'including', 'Maverick', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'bought', 'disc', 'Maverick', 'two', 'movies', 'come', 'one', 'disc', 'one', 'one', 'side', 'one', 'other', 'problem', 'bit', 'care', 'handling', 'disc.The', 'movies', 'are', 'western', 'comedies', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'more', 'different', 'watched', 'Maverick', 'first', 'was', 'favorite', 'story', 'movie', 'TV', 'past', 'might', 'expect', 'Maverick', 'was', 'droll', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'type', 'comedy', 'was', 'consistently', 'funny', 'very', 'amusing', 'movie', 'watch', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'was', 'different', 'story', 'one', 'not', 'will', 'depend', 'part', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'No', 'Good', 'acting', 'Not', 'particularly', 'Good', 'photography', 'okay', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'whole', 'movie', 'totally', 'absurd', 'parts', 'are', 'actually', 'funny', 'Do', 'elaborate', 'gadgets', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'gadgets', 'mechanical', 'tricks', 'are', 'comedy', 'very', 'humorous', 'watch', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'kinda', 'semi-worthwhile', 'film', 'value', 'would', 'depend', 'own', 'tastes', 'Double', 'Feature', 'packet', ""'d"", 'say', 'disc', 'worthwhile.Gary', 'Peterson']",Maverick / Wild Wild West
