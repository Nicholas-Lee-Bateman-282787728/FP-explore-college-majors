I GUESS IT HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE SCRIPT THAN HIS ACTING. TERI POLO AND MICHAEL LEARNED SHOWED THEIR USUAL GOOD TALENTS. SEEING KEITH (MCCARTHY) CHANGE FROM AN ALMOST CHILDISH, FLIGHTY PERSON TO A CARING, LOVING FATHER WITH AMISSION TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE MADE IT WORTH WATCHING.

It was nice to see Michael Learned in the role as an employee of the adoptive agency. Since she will always be remembered as 'Olivia Walton'.It was nice to see her playing a different role and doing a nice job.
