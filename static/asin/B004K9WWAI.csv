Charlie Devane)and the last season with Hunter and McCall's street-savvy fellow officer Lt. Ambrose Finn(John Shearin)which dies off in the ""Silver Bullet"" episode which was also the season finale episode to Hunter's 4th Season.This was the last season when Sgt. Rick Hunter(Fred Dryer)and Sgt. Dede McCall(Stepfanie Kramer)were so-called tough-as-nails homicide detectives working for the fictitious Metropolitan Police Department in Los Angeles since Hunter & McCall were all of the sudden street-wise and mostly by-the-book police investigators working for the LAPD Parker Center division in Downtown L.A. in the last 3 seasons.This 1987-1988 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come On Home To NBC"" since that was NBC's motto from the Fall of 1987 thru the Summer of 1988 when I was 15 years old and a Freshman in high school during this season.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Erik Estrada in the ""City Of Passion"" episode after his co-starring days as the often short-tempered hot dog California Highway Patrol Officer Frank Poncherello on CHiPs*Wendy Malick in the ""Boomerang"" episode before her co-starring days on the HBO comedy DREAM ON*Robert Reed in the ""City Of Passion"" episode after his co-starring days as the sentimental Mike Brady on THE BRADY BUNCH*Randy Brooks in the ""Naked Justice"" episode before his co-starring days as Nathan Hastings on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Robert Colbert in the episodes ""City Of Passion"" and ""The Fourth Man"" after his co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Jon Cypher in the ""Turning Point"" episode before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD and after his co-starring days as Chief Fletcher Daniels on the police drama HILL STREET BLUESThe only thing that sucks about this HUNTER-Season 4 DVD is Mill Creek didn't provide any Closed Captioning on this DVD like Anchor Bay did for HUNTER Seasons 1, 2, and 3.",4,Hunter Kicks Ass!,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,2235,"['time', 'brought', '1987-88', 'Season', 'DVD', 'especially', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'police', 'drama', 'ran', 'NBC', '7', 'years.This', 'also', 'season', 'when', 'Charles', 'Hallahan', 'fulltime', 'permanent', 'co-star', 'show', 'Hunter', 'McCall', 'non-sense', 'superior', 'officer', 'Capt', 'Charlie', 'Devane', 'last', 'season', 'Hunter', 'McCall', 'street-savvy', 'fellow', 'officer', 'Lt.', 'Ambrose', 'Finn', 'John', 'Shearin', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'episode', 'was', 'also', 'season', 'finale', 'episode', 'Hunter', '4th', 'Season.This', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'when', 'Sgt', 'Rick', 'Hunter', 'Fred', 'Dryer', 'Sgt', 'Dede', 'McCall', 'Stepfanie', 'Kramer', 'were', 'so-called', 'tough-as-nails', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'working', 'fictitious', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'Department', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Hunter', 'McCall', 'were', 'sudden', 'street-wise', 'mostly', 'by-the-book', 'police', 'investigators', 'working', 'LAPD', 'Parker', 'Center', 'division', 'Downtown', 'L.A.', 'last', '3', 'seasons.This', '1987-1988', 'Season', 'also', 'way', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'NBC', 'motto', 'was', 'Come', 'Home', 'NBC', 'was', 'NBC', 'motto', 'Fall', '1987', 'thru', 'Summer', '1988', 'when', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'Freshman', 'high', 'school', 'season.It', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'guest', 'stars', 'like*Erik', 'Estrada', 'City', 'Passion', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'days', 'often', 'short-tempered', 'hot', 'dog', 'California', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'Officer', 'Frank', 'Poncherello', 'CHiPs*Wendy', 'Malick', 'Boomerang', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'days', 'HBO', 'comedy', 'DREAM', 'ON*Robert', 'Reed', 'City', 'Passion', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'days', 'sentimental', 'Mike', 'Brady', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH*Randy', 'Brooks', 'Naked', 'Justice', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'days', 'Nathan', 'Hastings', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'THE', 'RESTLESS*Robert', 'Colbert', 'episodes', 'City', 'Passion', 'Fourth', 'Man', 'co-starring', 'days', 'YOUNG', 'THE', 'RESTLESS*Jon', 'Cypher', 'Turning', 'Point', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'days', 'MAJOR', 'DAD', 'co-starring', 'days', 'Chief', 'Fletcher', 'Daniels', 'police', 'drama', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUESThe', 'only', 'thing', 'HUNTER-Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'did', 'HUNTER', 'Seasons', '1', '2', '3']",Hunter: The Complete 4th Season (DVD) - Fred Dryer (DVD - 2011)
