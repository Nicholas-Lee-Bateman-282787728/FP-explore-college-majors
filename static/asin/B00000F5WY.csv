It is highly creative, pulling traditional sight gags and slapstick comedy mixed in with some very unexpected (and dark) twists. The humor can be enjoyed by everyone and serves as a good lesson to or about those that are set in their ways and make judgements too quickly. The use of camera angles and sight gags v. expensive special effects is excellent and works very, very well - without being sophmoric, cheesy or corny. And Max steals the show!",4,This is a great film,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,561,"['loved', 'film', 'can', 'definatley', 'see', 'why', 'became', 'successful', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'film', 'highly', 'creative', 'pulling', 'traditional', 'sight', 'gags', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'very', 'unexpected', 'dark', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'good', 'lesson', 'are', 'set', 'ways', 'make', 'judgements', 'too', 'quickly', 'use', 'camera', 'angles', 'sight', 'gags', 'v.', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'excellent', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'being', 'sophmoric', 'cheesy', 'corny', 'Max', 'show']",A Dog's Breakfast

Patrick is a nerdy thirty-something virgin with mild paranoia and Monkish tendancies (he wears the exact same thing everyday, seperates out and eats his Froot Loops by color, and spends his time tracking spiders outside his window) who lives with his dog, Mars, and has no other friends. But his precariously-balanced life is turned on it's head when his little sister Marilyn brings her TV-star boyfriend, Ryan, home for the holidays. When Patrick, who is determined to hate Ryan no matter how nice the guy seems, overhears him plotting to kill his sister, he takes matters into his own hands. But things don't go as planned (that's an understatement) and Patrick is soon in WAY over his head...Stargate fans will love the cameos and inside jokes, the cast is stellar, and David Hewlett is brilliant as ever.

499147,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00000F5WY,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","A DOG'S BREAKFESTI am a huge fan of David Hewlett who you may know as Dr. Rodney McKay' from the shows Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, as well as the film ""Cube"". So with that said I was really happy to hear a while back he was making his directorial debut with a film he also wrote, ""A Dog's Breakfast"". Unfortunately I was never able to catch a screening any were but I knew that the DVD would be coming eventually and I would catch it then. So of course when it came out I was finally able to buy it, don't know why I waited so long to recommend it.Patrick [Hewlett] is kind of a weird guy he lives alone in the house his parents owned and he wakes up every morning and separates his cereal [a fruit loops type] into separate bowls by color. He has a dog named Mars [played by a dog named Mars] and that is pretty much it, oh and his sister [Kate Hewlett] is coming to visit him. He actually looks forward to this occasion and even wants to prank her when she gets there. When he is getting ready to do this he notices a guy stalking her so he rushes to help her, turns out it is her boyfriend [Paul McGillion] trying to scare her as well.This throws him off a lot especially because he is not a people person and also this is some dude with his sister. So as time plays out he is kinda trying to get used to the fact this guy is in his house, but it is not working out to well. One day when he is outside he hears a conversation in which her boyfriend is plotting to kill his sister. So the rest of the film is based on him trying to kill the boyfriend before his sister gets the axe.This is not your typical film because it is full of an off sense of humor; I think it is hilarious personally. The script by star/director David Hewlett and Jane Loughman is excellent and very funny. Hewlett does a great job in his directorial debut as he keeps things moving and every thing feels very fresh and original. Hewlett is excellent as Patrick and gives one of the best performances ever. His sister Kate [Stargate Atlantis] who plays his sister is excellent as well and is surprisingly evil at times [you'll see]. Paul McGillion [also from Stargate Atlantis] is down right brilliant as TV actor boyfriend Ryan, colt and also as female detective, Detective Morse. He is an excellent actor and I hope he is in Hewlett's next film; he is hilarious especially as the cop. Christopher Judge who you may know as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1 is also hilarious as Chris in this film, the interaction between him and David Hewlett is masterful. Rachel Luttrell from Stargate Atlantis and Amanda Byram who plays the boyfriends sister are also great in this. But the show stealer could possibly be Mars the dog who plays Mars the dog.This is a very odd yet very funny film that may not be for every one, if you like off the wall comedy then this is for you. Every one in this film did a marvelous job as did the crew for this film. The special features are great with behind the scenes and such but it is the commentary that is the best thing in the bonus features. I recommend this movie to any and every one, buy this don't rent.",5,ONE OF THE BEST INDEPENDENT FILMS EVER,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,3122,"['DOG', 'BREAKFESTI', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'Dr.', 'Rodney', 'McKay', 'shows', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Cube', 'So', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'hear', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'making', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', 'also', 'wrote', 'Dog', 'Breakfast', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'catch', 'screening', 'were', 'knew', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'eventually', 'would', 'catch', 'then', 'So', 'course', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'recommend', 'it.Patrick', '[', 'Hewlett', ']', 'kind', 'weird', 'guy', 'alone', 'house', 'parents', 'owned', 'up', 'morning', 'cereal', 'fruit', 'type', ']', 'separate', 'bowls', 'color', 'dog', 'named', 'Mars', '[', 'played', 'dog', 'named', 'Mars', ']', 'pretty', 'much', 'sister', '[', 'Kate', 'Hewlett', ']', 'coming', 'visit', 'actually', 'forward', 'occasion', 'even', 'prank', 'when', 'there', 'When', 'getting', 'ready', 'do', 'guy', 'stalking', 'so', 'help', 'out', 'boyfriend', '[', 'Paul', 'McGillion', ']', 'trying', 'scare', 'well.This', 'off', 'lot', 'especially', 'not', 'people', 'person', 'also', 'dude', 'sister', 'So', 'time', 'out', 'kinda', 'trying', 'get', 'used', 'fact', 'guy', 'house', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'well', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'conversation', 'boyfriend', 'plotting', 'kill', 'sister', 'rest', 'film', 'based', 'trying', 'kill', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'axe.This', 'not', 'typical', 'film', 'full', 'sense', 'humor', 'think', 'hilarious', 'personally', 'script', 'star/director', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'Jane', 'Loughman', 'excellent', 'very', 'funny', 'Hewlett', 'great', 'job', 'directorial', 'debut', 'things', 'moving', 'thing', 'feels', 'very', 'fresh', 'original', 'Hewlett', 'excellent', 'Patrick', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'sister', 'Kate', '[', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', ']', 'who', 'sister', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'evil', 'times', '[', ""'ll"", 'see', ']', 'Paul', 'McGillion', '[', 'also', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', ']', 'down', 'right', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'actor', 'boyfriend', 'Ryan', 'colt', 'also', 'female', 'detective', 'Detective', 'Morse', 'excellent', 'actor', 'hope', 'Hewlett', 'next', 'film', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'cop', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'Teal', 'c', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'also', 'hilarious', 'Chris', 'film', 'interaction', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'masterful', 'Rachel', 'Luttrell', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'Amanda', 'Byram', 'who', 'boyfriends', 'sister', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'show', 'stealer', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Mars', 'dog', 'who', 'Mars', 'dog.This', 'very', 'odd', 'yet', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'like', 'wall', 'comedy', 'then', 'one', 'film', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'did', 'crew', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'such', 'commentary', 'best', 'thing', 'bonus', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent']",A Dog's Breakfast

Some say this movie is hilarious and induces giggling all the way through.  I finally had to stop watching after seeing about 60 percent of this trash when my increasing nausea became too much.If you think brushing your teeth with the same toothbrush you just used to brush your dog's teeth is funny, then you may enjoy this disgusting mess.  If you find trauma to a man's crotch just hilarious, then you will like this offering.  Or how about repeated attempts at murder and finally succeeding?  If you enjoy tromping through mud and getting filthy over and over, you and your hogs will love this show.The reason for murder is the brother's dislike of his sister's fiance.  I suppose one's suspension of disbelief is not stretched by the brother's motive for murder, i.e., the fiance is an actor and therefore cannot be trusted.  Most of us will murder sis's guy if she brings home an actor.No way is this repulsive mess comparable to the black comedy of the past.

All I did know is that one of my favorite actors wrote, directed, and starred in this film.  Based on the bad reviews and the very similar wording of a lot of the good reviews (my golly, some of the good reviews were worded almost identically to the description of the movie *on the movie's web page*) I really didn't know what to expect, in fact, I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.  I just watched the movie and can honestly say that it made me laugh, so I liked it.  It wasn't everything that the glowing 5 star ratings made it out to be, but it wasn't the polished turd that the 1 star reviews made it out to be either.  Almost all of the actors are from Stargate.  Being a stargate fan, I found this very distracting at times and it had a tendency to pull me out of the movie, so not really a good thing.  Being his directorial debut and low budget, I can't really fault the director for casting friends and family, but he might have done better if there were some less recognizable faces in the cast.  I found the plot somewhat predictable, but I think it was intentionally so, more of a ""Okay, I know what's going on, when are the character's going to figure it out?"" sort of thing.

He is not quite as charismatic to carry so much solo time on screen. He is much funnier interacting with the other characters and is more in his element feeding off of their dialog.  Hewletts facial expressions are delightful.Oh the whole, this is a very funny, witty, and clever movie.

I origionally bought it because of David Hewlett and only HOPED that I would like the movie. In less than a month I have seen it six times simply because it is one of the best movies I have seen. It's a family-friendly murder mystery that keeps you wondering what in the blue-blazes is going on right until the end. Parts had me laughing so hard I was crying.David Hewlett is halarious as Patrick and Kate Hewlett shines as his sister. Paul McGillion is a riot as the somewhat clueless Ryan, but you love them all despite--or because of--their rather odd quirks.This is a movie for anyone and everyone--and I really do mean that. I have rarely enjoyed a movie so much. It is sweet and twisted all at the same time, and weirdly enough it works well!I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes something that's just silly enough to be charming--and then be happily surprised in the end.",5,More than just what the dog dragged in,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,963,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'A', 'Dog', 'Breakfast', 'origionally', 'bought', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'only', 'HOPED', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'less', 'month', 'have', 'seen', 'six', 'times', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'family-friendly', 'murder', 'mystery', 'wondering', 'what', 'blue-blazes', 'going', 'right', 'end', 'Parts', 'had', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'crying.David', 'Hewlett', 'halarious', 'Patrick', 'Kate', 'Hewlett', 'shines', 'sister', 'Paul', 'McGillion', 'riot', 'somewhat', 'clueless', 'Ryan', 'love', 'rather', 'quirks.This', 'movie', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'really', 'do', 'mean', 'have', 'rarely', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'sweet', 'twisted', 'same', 'time', 'weirdly', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'something', 'just', 'silly', 'enough', 'be', 'charming', 'then', 'be', 'happily', 'surprised', 'end']",A Dog's Breakfast

The true mark of his talent is exemplified by his ability to make you despise his personality in his original role as McKay in SG-1, and to slowly make that character endearing using the same personality with subtle nuances.  He truly is a brilliant actor and, as proven here, director as well.This movie reminded me more of a British type comedy, such as 'Shallow Grave' or 'Keeping Mum'.  The humor was dark, but the characters are likable (unlike 'Shallow Grave').  David and his sister Kate have massive on screen chemistry.  They worked well together in an episode of Atlantis too ('McKay and Mrs Miller').  They should definitely do more together!  If you like quirky comedy and solid performances with no trace of Hollywood glitter, you'll enjoy this movie!!!",5,Dark Delight!,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,862,"['thought', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'was', 'excellent', 'Down', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Stargate', 'true', 'mark', 'talent', 'exemplified', 'ability', 'make', 'despise', 'personality', 'original', 'role', 'McKay', 'SG-1', 'slowly', 'make', 'character', 'endearing', 'using', 'same', 'personality', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'proven', 'here', 'director', 'well.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'more', 'British', 'type', 'comedy', 'such', ""'Shallow"", 'Grave', ""'Keeping"", 'Mum', 'humor', 'was', 'dark', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'Grave', 'David', 'sister', 'Kate', 'have', 'massive', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'episode', 'Atlantis', 'too', ""'McKay"", 'Mrs', 'Miller', 'should', 'definitely', 'do', 'more', 'together', 'like', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'solid', 'performances', 'trace', 'Hollywood', 'glitter', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie']",A Dog's Breakfast
499162,A1QGMIQD8ZYDS8,B00000F5WY,"Ralph J. Fitcher ""Namahotitae""","[1, 2]","This was a very different vehicle for David Hewlett. Certainly a B movie if ever there was one. I found it funny at times, but all too predictable at others. {Spoiler Alert} I knew from the ladder accident that the Paul McGillion character was not dead. Furthermore, I knew very quickly that he was the person pulling the pranks on David's character. Perhaps that was what David Hewlett was going for when writing this. Certainly not a mystery. David's sister is a wonderful actress who played her part perfectly. Paul McGillion with the Scottish accent only happens when we see him play his aunt a detective. Actually, Paul McGillion is absent from most of the story and perhaps it was planned that way. There is a brief cameo by Christopher Judge, and an even shorter cameo by Rachel Luttrell, though you will not recognize her. I know I did not. The story centers around David's character trying to kill Paul's character because he is going to marry David's sister. When he finally thinks he has succeeded he immediately regrets his actions and tries to atone to his sister and hide/bury the evidence. The evidence keeps reappearing in dubious ways. The title comes from David's sister making David believe that she has chopped up and ground up Paul's character's body. She then feeds this alleged ground meat to David's character's dog.  Thus, the story. The story ends with a viewer guess at what is going to happen, but an indication that after meeting the Paul's character's sister and falling head over heals in love with her, Paul's character is now trying taking David's character off to kill him.Overall, I a decent story. Boring at times, funny other times. I rated it a 4 because I really like David Hewlett and want to see him to more movies.  For the movie itself I would have given it a 2.
