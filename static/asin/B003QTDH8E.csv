1359302,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003QTDH8E,trebe,"[1, 1]","The elements that made McMillan and Wife a hit are still in place, and stars Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James seem to be more comfortable with each other, but although there are some bright spots, the overall quality of stories in season two are just a little below par.  The fine cast and the impressive list of guest stars are generally not to blame, as the reasons for this rest firmly with the writing, which seems a bit off track at times.Following the adventures of San Francisco police Commissioner Stuart ""Mac"" McMillan (Hudson), and his intrepid wife Sally (Saint James), the series had reintroduced the husband and wife crime solving team to prime time television.  Rounding out the cast is John Schuck as Mac's right hand man, sergeant Charles Enright, and Nancy Walker as the couple's acerbic housekeeper Mildred.The season opens with one of the weaker stories.  ""Night of the Wizard"" is a goofy ghost tale, where a woman is contacted by the spirit of her dead husband, who accuses her of killing him.  Featuring a s&eacute;ance and ghostly apparitions, mediums and magicians, this kind of paranormal tale has been done before.  As a real person is obviously responsible rather than a ghost, the suspense rather minimal, but Cameron Mitchell and Sharon Acker are terrific overplaying their roles.There are just seven episodes in the season, and kidnapping is featured prominently in two of them.  In ""Double Trouble"", Mac is abducted by the mob so that a double can take his place.  This already clich&eacute;d device had become overused in espionage and crime programs, like Mission Impossible in particular.  Many of the situations seem very familiar, as Mac makes a dramatic escape, and confronts his double.  In the bizarre ""The Fine Art of Staying Alive"", Sally is kidnapped and ransomed for a priceless painting.  It's a pretty far out scenario, but the quick witted Sally provides an obscure clue, that eventually contributes to her rescue, as Mac goes back in time to the day he proposed to her.One of the more engaging episodes is ""No Hearts, No Flowers"", where Sally is being stalked by persons unknown.  Mac and Enright follow her daily activities looking for clues to the stalker's identity.  With a number of suspects, and some quirky story elements, this one keeps you guessing up until a twisted, although somewhat dubious conclusion.  ""Blues For Sally M"" is another instance of weird obsession, and delusional fantasy.  Keir Dullea (2001: A Space Odyssey) guests as a musician who dedicates a composition to Ms. McMillan.  Those with an observant eye may see what is coming rather early.""Cop of the Year"" is one of the best and perhaps more memorable of stories from this season, as Sergeant Enright is at a dinner being honored as the Policeman of the Year, when his ex-wife Monica (Lorraine Gary) unexpectedly makes an appearance.  While they are alone in a room, a shot rings out, and Enright draws his gun.  When Mac and the party goers break into the room, Monica has been shot, and later arrives at the hospital DOA, leaving Enright facing a murder charge.While there are some good moments and instances of clever writing, with a few uninspired stories and repetitious themes, the second season of McMillan and Wife is a little uneven, and a slight step down from the best that the series has to offer.  How close some of the storylines run to each other, is more noticeable when the episodes are viewed in close proximity.  When Columbo, one of the most well-written programs in television history, is your regular competition, you really need to be at the top of your game, and that just isn't the case here.  The chemistry between the characters remains special, and fans will certainly want to get this set, however casual mystery lovers might want to start elsewhere, perhaps withMcMillan & Wife: Season 5, which has some stronger stories.",3,some things are not quite up to par in season two...,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,3879,"['elements', 'made', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'hit', 'are', 'still', 'place', 'stars', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'other', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', 'overall', 'quality', 'stories', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'par', 'fine', 'cast', 'impressive', 'list', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'blame', 'reasons', 'rest', 'firmly', 'writing', 'bit', 'off', 'track', 'times.Following', 'adventures', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'Commissioner', 'Stuart', 'Mac', 'McMillan', 'Hudson', 'intrepid', 'wife', 'Sally', 'Saint', 'James', 'series', 'had', 'reintroduced', 'husband', 'wife', 'crime', 'solving', 'team', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'John', 'Schuck', 'Mac', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'sergeant', 'Charles', 'Enright', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'couple', 'acerbic', 'housekeeper', 'Mildred.The', 'season', 'one', 'weaker', 'stories', 'Night', 'Wizard', 'goofy', 'ghost', 'tale', 'where', 'woman', 'contacted', 'spirit', 'dead', 'husband', 'who', 'killing', 'Featuring', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'ghostly', 'apparitions', 'mediums', 'magicians', 'kind', 'paranormal', 'tale', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'real', 'person', 'obviously', 'responsible', 'rather', 'ghost', 'suspense', 'rather', 'minimal', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Sharon', 'Acker', 'are', 'terrific', 'overplaying', 'roles.There', 'are', 'just', 'seven', 'episodes', 'season', 'kidnapping', 'featured', 'prominently', 'two', 'Double', 'Trouble', 'Mac', 'abducted', 'mob', 'so', 'double', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'already', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'device', 'had', 'become', 'overused', 'espionage', 'crime', 'programs', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'particular', 'Many', 'situations', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'Mac', 'dramatic', 'escape', 'double', 'bizarre', 'Fine', 'Art', 'Staying', 'Alive', 'Sally', 'kidnapped', 'ransomed', 'priceless', 'painting', 'pretty', 'far', 'out', 'scenario', 'quick', 'witted', 'Sally', 'obscure', 'clue', 'eventually', 'rescue', 'Mac', 'back', 'time', 'day', 'proposed', 'her.One', 'more', 'engaging', 'episodes', 'No', 'Hearts', 'No', 'Flowers', 'where', 'Sally', 'being', 'stalked', 'persons', 'unknown', 'Mac', 'Enright', 'follow', 'daily', 'activities', 'looking', 'clues', 'stalker', 'identity', 'number', 'suspects', 'quirky', 'story', 'elements', 'one', 'guessing', 'up', 'twisted', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'conclusion', 'Blues', 'Sally', 'M', 'instance', 'weird', 'obsession', 'delusional', 'fantasy', 'Keir', 'Dullea', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'musician', 'who', 'composition', 'Ms.', 'McMillan', 'observant', 'eye', 'may', 'see', 'what', 'coming', 'rather', 'early', 'Cop', 'Year', 'one', 'best', 'perhaps', 'more', 'memorable', 'stories', 'season', 'Sergeant', 'Enright', 'dinner', 'being', 'honored', 'Policeman', 'Year', 'when', 'ex-wife', 'Monica', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'unexpectedly', 'appearance', 'are', 'alone', 'room', 'shot', 'out', 'Enright', 'gun', 'When', 'Mac', 'party', 'goers', 'break', 'room', 'Monica', 'been', 'shot', 'later', 'arrives', 'hospital', 'DOA', 'leaving', 'Enright', 'facing', 'murder', 'charge.While', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'instances', 'clever', 'writing', 'few', 'uninspired', 'stories', 'repetitious', 'themes', 'second', 'season', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'little', 'uneven', 'slight', 'step', 'down', 'best', 'series', 'offer', 'How', 'close', 'storylines', 'run', 'other', 'more', 'noticeable', 'when', 'episodes', 'are', 'viewed', 'close', 'proximity', 'When', 'Columbo', 'one', 'most', 'well-written', 'programs', 'television', 'history', 'regular', 'competition', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'top', 'game', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'special', 'fans', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'get', 'set', 'however', 'casual', 'mystery', 'lovers', 'might', 'want', 'start', 'elsewhere', 'perhaps', 'withMcMillan', 'Wife', 'Season', '5', 'stronger', 'stories']",Mcmillan & Wife: Season 2
