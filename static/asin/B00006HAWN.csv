That was a horrible mistake. Somebody casted Jennifer Lopez as the lead role. That was a horrible mistake. I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well. Very creepy. Not a horrible mistake to take a role, just a horrible mistake that the role was in this movie. It's predictable and the only outstanding thing about this film is that it is, you guessed it, all a horrible mistake.",2,it's all a horrible mistake,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,980,"['parents', 'rented', 'dvd', 'told', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', ""'d"", 'think', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'lesson', 'trusting', 'judgement', 'film', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'check', 'out', 'was', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'Somebody', 'casted', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'suppose', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'mind', 'Nicholas', 'Kazan', 'writer', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'wrote', 'script', 'were', 'horrible', 'mistakes', 'Three', 'great', 'actors', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'were', 'film', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'Noah', 'Wylie', 'take', 'part', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'played', 'villainous', 'role', 'one', 'so', 'what', 'usually', 'did', 'well', 'Very', 'creepy', 'Not', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'take', 'role', 'just', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'role', 'was', 'movie', 'predictable', 'only', 'outstanding', 'thing', 'film', 'guessed', 'horrible', 'mistake']",Enough
715734,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00006HAWN,Alfonso A.,"[8, 11]","If you saw ``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' you may have seen enough of ``Enough.''The 1991 movie starred Julia Roberts as the wife of a wealthy, abusive husband who flees her palatial Los Angeles home, moves to a small town in the Midwest, and changes her name and her looks. And yet, he hunts her down and tries to kill her.``Enough'' stars Jennifer Lopez as the wife of a wealthy, abusive husband who flees her palatial Los Angeles home, moves to a small town in the Midwest, and changes her name and her looks. He hunts her down and tries to kill her, too.The main variable here is that Lopez's character, Slim, is a mother, and she grabs the couple's young daughter, Gracie (Tessa Allen), on her way out the door.Say what you will about J.Lo -- that she can't sing, that she's ubiquitous. The woman has an undeniable presence. And watching her transform herself from pampered, betrayed housewife to one-woman wrecking machine makes ``Enough'' function on a visceral, you-go-girl level.The third act -- in which she exacts her revenge with the elaborate skill of James Bond and the brute strength of Rocky Balboa -- is pretty ridiculous if you stop to think about it. But it's entertaining enough that it almost makes up for the inconsistencies in plot and character development that preceded it.For a thriller, the movie begins more like a romantic comedy, with Slim and Mitch (Billy Campbell of ``Once and Again'') meeting cute at the diner where she's a waitress, and title cards like ``How they met'' and ``Conquering hero'' connecting their early stages.In no time, they've fallen in love, gotten married, moved into a beautiful house together and had a baby. Mitch, a contractor, seems like the ideal husband, if a bit distant at times.Then Slim discovers Mitch is having an affair, and when she confronts him, his personality changes completely. He becomes so cold-hearted and cruel so abruptly, it's difficult to accept -- almost comic.The script from Nicholas Kazan explains his behavior with vague throwaway lines such as: ``I am and always will be a person who gets what he wants'' and ``If I can't have you, nobody else will.''Slim cooks up a scheme to escape with the help of Ginny (Juliette Lewis), a waitress at the diner; Phil (Christopher Maher), who's a father figure in the absence of her real dad; and ex-boyfriend Joe (Dan Futterman), who provides refuge at his home in Seattle.Michael Apted, who directed the most recent Bond movie, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' and another female empowerment movie, ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' knows how to keep the pace moving during the action sequences. But the midsection of the film -- the cat-and-mouse chase, with its requisite cheap scares -- gets a bit repetitive.The plot problems pop up as Slim and Gracie move from city to city. For a contractor, Mitch has the computer skills of a sophisticated hacker; he immediately freezes Slim's access to her cash and credit, and he tracks her moves effortlessly, with a squad of thugs in every city available to pounce on her and the little girl.Mitch even has a police officer buddy at his disposal (``ER's'' Noah Wyle, like Campbell, playing against type) who tries to ram Slim's car from behind, even though Gracie is sitting in the back seat. Um, isn't he supposed to bring the girl back ... alive?As if Gracie hasn't been through enough, Slim sends her away for a month to stay with Ginny and her two kids while she prepares for a showdown with Mitch. She learns Krav Maga -- a fighting form originally developed for women in the Israeli army -- and her eyeliner and lip gloss are perfect during every punch and kick.",2,Another Mediocre Movie From Another Mediocre Actress,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,3629,"['saw', 'Sleeping', 'Enemy', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'Enough', ""''The"", '1991', 'movie', 'starred', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'palatial', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'home', 'moves', 'small', 'town', 'Midwest', 'name', 'looks', 'yet', 'down', 'tries', 'kill', 'her.', 'Enough', 'stars', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'palatial', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'home', 'moves', 'small', 'town', 'Midwest', 'name', 'looks', 'down', 'tries', 'kill', 'main', 'variable', 'here', 'Lopez', 'character', 'Slim', 'mother', 'grabs', 'couple', 'young', 'daughter', 'Gracie', 'Tessa', 'Allen', 'way', 'door.Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'J.Lo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'ubiquitous', 'woman', 'undeniable', 'presence', 'watching', 'transform', 'pampered', 'betrayed', 'housewife', 'one-woman', 'wrecking', 'machine', 'Enough', 'function', 'visceral', 'you-go-girl', 'level.The', 'third', 'act', 'revenge', 'elaborate', 'skill', 'James', 'Bond', 'brute', 'strength', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'stop', 'think', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'almost', 'up', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'preceded', 'it.For', 'thriller', 'movie', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Slim', 'Mitch', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'Once', 'Again', 'meeting', 'cute', 'diner', 'where', 'waitress', 'title', 'cards', 'How', 'met', 'Conquering', 'hero', 'connecting', 'early', 'stages.In', 'time', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'gotten', 'married', 'moved', 'beautiful', 'house', 'together', 'had', 'baby', 'Mitch', 'contractor', 'ideal', 'husband', 'bit', 'distant', 'times.Then', 'Slim', 'discovers', 'Mitch', 'having', 'affair', 'when', 'personality', 'changes', 'completely', 'so', 'cold-hearted', 'cruel', 'so', 'abruptly', 'difficult', 'accept', 'almost', 'comic.The', 'script', 'Nicholas', 'Kazan', 'behavior', 'vague', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'such', 'am', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'nobody', 'else', 'will', ""''Slim"", 'up', 'scheme', 'escape', 'help', 'Ginny', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'waitress', 'diner', 'Phil', 'Christopher', 'Maher', 'who', 'father', 'figure', 'absence', 'real', 'dad', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Joe', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'who', 'refuge', 'home', 'Seattle.Michael', 'Apted', 'who', 'directed', 'most', 'recent', 'Bond', 'movie', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'female', 'empowerment', 'movie', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'how', 'keep', 'pace', 'moving', 'action', 'sequences', 'midsection', 'film', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'requisite', 'cheap', 'scares', 'bit', 'repetitive.The', 'plot', 'problems', 'pop', 'up', 'Slim', 'Gracie', 'move', 'city', 'city', 'contractor', 'Mitch', 'computer', 'skills', 'sophisticated', 'hacker', 'immediately', 'Slim', 'access', 'cash', 'credit', 'moves', 'effortlessly', 'squad', 'thugs', 'city', 'available', 'pounce', 'little', 'girl.Mitch', 'even', 'police', 'officer', 'buddy', 'disposal', 'ER', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Campbell', 'playing', 'type', 'who', 'ram', 'Slim', 'car', 'behind', 'even', 'Gracie', 'sitting', 'back', 'seat', 'Um', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'bring', 'girl', 'back', 'alive', 'Gracie', ""n't"", 'been', 'enough', 'Slim', 'away', 'month', 'stay', 'Ginny', 'two', 'kids', 'showdown', 'Mitch', 'Krav', 'Maga', 'fighting', 'form', 'originally', 'developed', 'women', 'Israeli', 'army', 'eyeliner', 'lip', 'gloss', 'are', 'perfect', 'punch', 'kick']",Enough
715735,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00006HAWN,Amanda,"[1, 1]","I could say I've had 'Enough' of J. Lo - what, with all of the recent publicity revolving around how she can't keep a husband. Well, in this movie, she has a darn good reason to get rid of her husband: he's a cheater and an abuser. And not only that - he's a complete psycho too. I was hesitant to see this movie, mainly because it just looked uninteresting. Luckily, my friend rented it, so I got to see it for free. And you know what? It wasn't bad. Not at all.First, I will say I like J. Lo. She was great in films like Selena, Out of Sight, and The Cell. But after all the recent fluffy films she's been in (The Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan) I was a little weary about how she would handle a heavy dramatic role. She did fine. So did Billy Campbell, as her almost too-overly-evil husband. Juliette Lewis was good as her best friend, and Noah Wyle puts in a great, but small, performance as a character none of us are used to seeing him play (Dr. Carter would be disappointed). So the performances are good, as is the action, which for me was at times edge-of-your-seat. However, I will say that, despite the fact that it's good, it would have made a much better Lifetime: Television For Women made-for-Tv movie (they're always showing movies about women running from abusive/psychotic/maniacal men) as opposed to a film on the big screen. That's probably why it will do better on video and DVD than in the box office - stories like this were invented for the small screen.So, 'Enough' is a pretty good film - especially towards the end when J. Lo decides SHE'S had enough, and decides to fight back. This will have every female who watches it cheering her on with such phrases as ""You go girl!"" and ""Kick his butt!"". All in all, it kept me entertained for a couple of hours, and that's more than enough for me.",4,Better Than Expected,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,1820,"['could', 'say', ""'ve"", 'had', ""'Enough"", 'J', 'Lo', 'what', 'recent', 'publicity', 'revolving', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'husband', 'Well', 'movie', 'darn', 'good', 'reason', 'get', 'rid', 'husband', 'cheater', 'abuser', 'not', 'only', 'complete', 'psycho', 'too', 'was', 'hesitant', 'see', 'movie', 'mainly', 'just', 'looked', 'uninteresting', 'Luckily', 'friend', 'rented', 'so', 'got', 'see', 'free', 'know', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Not', 'all.First', 'will', 'say', 'J', 'Lo', 'was', 'great', 'films', 'Selena', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Cell', 'recent', 'fluffy', 'been', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'little', 'weary', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'role', 'did', 'fine', 'So', 'did', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'almost', 'too-overly-evil', 'husband', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'was', 'good', 'best', 'friend', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'great', 'small', 'performance', 'character', 'none', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'play', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'was', 'times', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'fact', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'Lifetime', 'Television', 'Women', 'made-for-Tv', 'movie', ""'re"", 'always', 'showing', 'movies', 'women', 'running', 'abusive/psychotic/maniacal', 'men', 'opposed', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'probably', 'why', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'video', 'DVD', 'box', 'office', 'stories', 'were', 'invented', 'small', 'screen.So', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'J', 'Lo', 'SHE', 'had', 'fight', 'back', 'will', 'have', 'female', 'who', 'cheering', 'such', 'phrases', 'go', 'girl', 'Kick', 'butt', 'kept', 'entertained', 'couple', 'hours', 'more', 'enough']",Enough

715738,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006HAWN,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I won't deny the fact that `Enough' has its moments.  In fact, the first watch through will most likely leave you riveted; completely glued to the screen.  This has a lot to do with the fact that Jennifer Lopez is extremely watchable, no matter what kind of garbage she is starring in (I mean, seriously...why can't she pick up a decent script?).Abuse is far from a funny subject, and I'm not saying that `Enough' takes pot shots at the problem, but it doesn't do it justice.  Instead of feeling like a deeply rooted study on the issue, `Enough' feels more like a melodramatic Lifetime movie.  It's ridiculously constructed to produce characters that don't feel human.  Billy Campbell alone (who is far better an actor than this movie would lead you to believe) is nothing but a stereotype; a laughable caricature.  Laughable is not something you want to associate with the villain of your movie, unless you're Quinton Tarantino.  Sure, you'll be rooting for Lopez in the end, but who wouldn't.The direction is standard fare for this breed of `thriller', so nothing to really write home about there.

Enough asks us to suspend disbelief in too many ways. First, I never believed Lopez as a mother. Her relationship with her ""daughter"" seemed more like that of a temporary caregiver than a permanent one. Also, Lopez, in her non-fictional incarnation, presents herself as someone who would never accept the abuse that her character is given here. And it is almost impossible to separate Lopez from her character.Billy Campbell, as her husband, is quite good, but he's in a film that doesn't allow him to shine. This is Lopez's show all the way and, while she makes the most of it, she does not show any of the charm or style that she did in films like Out of Sight (when she was still trying to win us over). Also appearing in creatively cast cameos are Fred Ward as Lopez's estranged father and Juliette Lewis as her best friend.Lopez plays an abused wife who decides to leave with her daughter and then fight back. The first half, which sets up the relationship and the abuse, is nearly laughable. It feels very much like a Lifetime movie-of-the-week. When she learns how to take her revenge, it picks up and the climax--with car chase and fist fight--is rather exciting. But then it end with really no resolution and we are left with little to remember, except a fine performance from Campbell and perhaps a few new defensive Krav Maga moves.Enough seems to me like the writer envisioned the climax and then built a story to go around it, as that part is by far the best developed and was obviously the primary motive of the screenwriter in the first place.

I agree that J.Lo is not the cream of the crop and I doubt she'll be up for an oscar anytime soon but her performance here is far from the trash that some reviewers would lend you to believe.  There are some minor plot problems here.  My sister was in an abusive relationship and so I've seen it first hand.  The fact that it took Mitch YEARS to ever hit Slim is kinda rediculous.  Most abusive relationships start before the marraige with signs of controll and jealousy and the abuse usually starts shortly after the vows are said.

I mean, the guy is sleeping around all the time so why don't you pick a time when he's gone...ANYWAYS...after she's out of the house the intensity starts as she tries to stay one step ahead of the man that wants her dead.  THe film is gripping and does well to show the self hatred and loss that an abuse victim can go through but it failed to show the confusion and devotion that the abused usually feels.  My sister would hate him and then defend him over and over.  The problem with abuse is that the abuser manipulates the woman into feeling worthless and dependant to the point that they feel they don't deserve any better.  J.Lo never showed that side of the story.  I do have to say that it was nice to see a woman stick up for herself and her daughter, but it just wasn't realistic to me.

At stake is not only Slim's well-being but also the psychological and physical protection of their young daughter Gracie (played adorably by little Tessa Allen).  Although this flick has the trappings of a feminist fight-back story with its theme of domestic violence and custody laws, make no mistake:  this is a thriller through and through, with twists and violence and personal peril at every turn.  Women will delight in the training scenes where J-Lo prepares to fight back, and men will hardly mind the sight of the buff actress learning to defend herself.Yeah, the premise as it unfolds is a little ridiculous, especially as Mitch seems to have a GPS system to track his fleeing wife, but the escapism is pure adrenaline-rushing fun.  Jennifer Lopez is naturally appealing and solid in her performance, although the emotional range of the role seems to demand only fierceness and fright.  Still, the chemistry between her and young co-star Allen is unmistakable, even poignant.  Noah Wylie does a fantastic turn as Robbie, a character I won't describe for fear of spoiling the plot.  Juliette Lewis has her usual on-screen charisma even though she's not given much to work with.This film was much better than I expected.  Viewers hoping for something new or even substantial on the theme of domestic violence will be disappointed since it only serves as a plot device to put Lopez's character in danger.

I suppose after generations of being dominated by the male sub-species that once the ladies decided to strike back they meant just that:  strike back.  A perfect example of estrogen TNT in a can is Jennifer Lopez swingin', sweatin', and kickin' in ENOUGH.Let's face it, we all know where ENOUGH is headed.  J-Lo plays a greasy spoon waitress (yeah, like that's believable) who happens to fall for a smooth-talking swell (Bill Campbell) who turns out not to be the nicest guy on the block.  Er, the planet.  And when J-Lo confronts Hubby about his flagrant infidelity, Hubby responds with some fisticuffs and then refuses to let his wife out of the marriage.  Granted, Campbell is ultra-creepy to watch. . .he's so revolting and disgusting that even my dog knew he was going to get the ultimate comeuppance at the end of this flick.With the help of friends, J-Lo and young daughter flee and relocate thousands of miles away, yet Hubby is relentless in his pursuit.  Once it becomes obvious that a custody showdown is inevitable, J-Lo does the only logical thing:  She enlists the aid of a martial arts dude and learns how to fight like a tiger.  Tigress?  Then, it's back to California to sneak into Hubby's new flat and extract a pound of posterior.  And, of course, predictability reigns supreme as the film rolls to its conclusion.I've had the luxury of viewing this film with other ladies, and their reaction has been somewhat universal.  Not a one of them would have put up with the guff J-Lo did; in fact, the first time a punch was thrown Hubby would have first been looking at the floor to find his mountain oysters, just before he would feel the piercing pain of buckshot.  But, perhaps justice is swifer in my neck of the woods.  Anyway, in ENOUGH J-Lo kind of blindsides her husband during their kung fu match.  Ain't fair.  I demand a best two-out-of-three.--D.

Apart from Out of Sight, Jennifer Lopez picks movies that she feels creates an image of her that ingratiates her with the public and strokes all the class insecure hyper-ambitions of a true sellout.  I'm seductive because I'm hot yet vulnerable.  If you want that kind of hot, Rosanna Arquette in Desperately Seeking Susan still holds the crown and she didn't have to get on a soapbox about being from the barrio but I'm a princess on the inside or I'm so hot that my husband can't forget me because ultimately its not about the spousal abuse, oh no, its about being the most unforgettable gal in the world.

Nasty stuff.p.s. I don't completely hate Jennifer Lopez.  I did like her all too brief but lovely appearance in Mi Familia and wished that I would see more of this authentic beauty.  She just ran off the integrity rails, made a lot of money and is of no interest to me whatsoever now.  I just don't want to see anything she is in.

I do, however, see where some people are coming from when they say bad stuff about it. As much as I liked it, I do understand where some flaws were. Some of the acting was a little overdone (with the exception of Jennifer Lopez; she was strong and believable in her role) and the plot was not brand-new material, but it still has the potential to be a good movie. Another reviewer on here was talking about how this is a great film for women. I totally agree. Women don't always have to take a back seat to everything, and Jennifer Lopez's character really had something worthwhile to say. If you don't already know that the plot consists of, the movie is about Slim, a woman who marries Mitch, the typical ""no-good"" character who lures Slim into thinking he's perfect long enough for her to marry him and have a child with him. After the little girl is born, it all starts going down the tubes. Mitch starts showing what a scumbag he is, Slim tries to run with the daughter, but she is unable to find a route he won't follow. Finally, she decides to hand temporary care of her daughter over to a good friend while she takes martial arts classes and goes after Mitch for the sake of her own safety and the safety of the child. It's a pretty engaging plot that grabs your attention--sometimes it goes slowly and sometimes it starts rolling, but it REALLY picks up in the final scene. Hmm...considering this movie has not gotten all good reviews, I'm trying to figure out who would enjoy it...well, for starters, it is certainly  not a disappointment for Jennifer Lopez fans, so there's a group of people who would like it. You might also enjoy it if you like a blend of values and horror. Yes, this movie has both of those things. Not very many films do, but this one does. It's not a 100% thriller, which is why I liked it. I don't do well with many horror movies, but I liked seeing the sweet relationship between Slim and her young daughter.

I realize now they were quite misleading and I pegged the film as a B rating. I had interpreted them as a typical ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" type of film. Husband beats wife, wife runs. Well, to a point that's the basic plot of ""Enough"".  On the otherhand, Jennifer Lopez as ""Slim"" gives us another advantage point. We see her fall and bleed, we see her run for her life, we see her reach her limit. What we also see is the humanity. (And yes, she makes the Julia Robert's character seem terribly useless in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"")It's not all cat and mouse.  The characters in this drama must play by the rules.  The law is not really on anybody's side.Slim leaves her abusive husband with her daughter Gracie in tow and with help from friends old and new, lives a life on the run. It's not her daughter who's in danger, it's her. If she is found her husband (played by Billy Campbell)he will kill her.So what to do? Go to the police?  He'll find her.  Go to a friend?  He'll find her.  She decides to use the rules her own way...she spends one month traing heavily with a martial arts instructor and decides to make the fight fair.Jennifer Lopez does a fabulous job, as usual, of never playing herself.  She is Slim, the once submissive wife who wants to be happy.  Be we watch her become much more...a tough cookie who knows how to play a man's game.I enjoyed this movie very much.  Lopez always surprises me with her characters.  Some scenes were very difficult to watch.  Many times heartfelt moments between Slim and Gracie were real tearjerkers.  I am not sure how a movie like this would translate into the real world, but on-screen it seems quite convincing.  My only problem with the movie...I wanted more from the ending.  It left me a little dry. Otherwise, I would say most would enjoy ""Enough"" as a great night's rent.  Kudos to Juliette Lewis, I haven't seen her in a film for years.

(roll eyes)Overall I thought the actors did a decent job.  Many say that Lopez can't act, but I happen to think that she's actually quite compelling - as is the rest of the cast.  I'm sure that if the movie showed a LOT more flesh, she'd be received more favorably.  Nothing else is all that impressive about the movie; everything else is just a matter of going through the paces.Notes on the ending (Spoiler Alert!): It's incredibly stupid and insulting to anyone who has ever been in a real fight - Mitch would have destroyed Slim.  You don't take a few months of self defense and suddenly wipe the floor with someone who possesses every possible physical advantage.  Sorry, not gonna happen.  Not only that, but movies in which there is an obvious flaw in the criminal law process, glossed over simply because it advocates the weak premise within, is lazy and irresponsible (especially considering the delicate subject matter).  Had situations been reversed, this movie would have been lambasted by womyn groups. What I want to know is: Where is the outrage at blatant murder?  I'm not trying to minimize battered women, but Slim is clearly guilty of murder.  Instead of the you-go-girl, J-Lo ego-enhancing beat-down as the finale, it would have been better to see Slim on a chain-gang in west Texas, teary-eyed and reminiscing about a now teenage daughter who has to visit her mommy through a grimy plexi-glass wall in a viewing room.",2,Slim Chance,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2479,"['What', 'woman', 'do', 'when', 'husband', 'cheats', 'How', 'far', 'can', 'infidelity', 'push', 'person', 'What', 'can', 'wife', 'do', 'when', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'abused', 'fears', 'child', 'theme', 'Sleeping', 'er', 'movie', 'Slim', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'Mitch', 'Billy', 'Campbell', '.Mitch', 'be', 'perfect', 'husband', 'wealthy', 'contractor', 'who', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'when', 'Slim', 'Mitch', 'been', 'having', 'affairs', 'so', 'much', 'numerically', 'Suddenly', 'Mitch', 'cruel', 'abusive', 'mad-man', 'telling', 'Slim', 'Look', ""'m"", 'just', 'squirrel', 'Honestly', 'Mitch', 'always', 'what', 'So', 'naturally', 'Slim', 'preposterous', 'conclusion', 'should', ""n't"", 'report', 'problem', 'police', 'lawyer', ""n't"", 'take', 'pictures', 'evidence', 'basically', 'just', 'kidnaps', 'child', 'state', 'hide', 'out', 'hotels', 'friend', 'house', 'Smooth', 'move', 'Mitch', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'now', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Overall', 'thought', 'actors', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'Many', 'say', 'Lopez', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'happen', 'think', 'actually', 'quite', 'compelling', 'rest', 'cast', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'showed', 'LOT', 'more', 'flesh', ""'d"", 'be', 'received', 'more', 'favorably', 'Nothing', 'else', 'impressive', 'movie', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'matter', 'going', 'paces.Notes', 'ending', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'insulting', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'real', 'fight', 'Mitch', 'would', 'have', 'destroyed', 'Slim', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'few', 'months', 'self', 'defense', 'suddenly', 'floor', 'someone', 'who', 'possible', 'physical', 'advantage', 'Sorry', 'not', 'gon', 'happen', 'Not', 'only', 'movies', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'criminal', 'law', 'process', 'glossed', 'simply', 'weak', 'premise', 'lazy', 'irresponsible', 'especially', 'considering', 'delicate', 'subject', 'matter', 'Had', 'situations', 'been', 'reversed', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lambasted', 'womyn', 'groups', 'What', 'want', 'know', 'Where', 'outrage', 'blatant', 'murder', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'minimize', 'battered', 'women', 'Slim', 'clearly', 'guilty', 'murder', 'Instead', 'you-go-girl', 'J-Lo', 'ego-enhancing', 'beat-down', 'finale', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'see', 'Slim', 'chain-gang', 'west', 'Texas', 'teary-eyed', 'reminiscing', 'now', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'visit', 'mommy', 'grimy', 'plexi-glass', 'wall', 'viewing', 'room']",Enough

Jennifer Lopez stars as a woman who meets an apparent Prince Charming (Billy Campbell); the couple are soon wed and start a family.  Everything appears to be headed towards &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; until Lopez discovers that hubby has a mistress on the side.  When confronted, Campbell peels off his mask and reveals himself to be, in fact, a chauvinistic wife-beater.  Lopez resolves to take their daughter and run ... and it's at this point that the movie breaks down, with Campbell persuing his fleeing wife with all the mechanized determination of The Terminator.  The plot gets steadily cornier, with the down-and-out Lopez luckily getting financial help from her estranged multimillionaire father (wouldn't it be great if all abused wives just happened to have untapped resources like that?), and then receiving the training necessary to - literally - become a female Terminator herself, after which she engages Campbell in a brutal fight-to-the-death.  (I'll let you guess who wins.)The two leads give interesting performances up until the time the script requires their characters to turn cartoonish, and they are given able support by Juliette Lewis as Lopez's best friend.  The wonderful and capable Dan Futterman is pretty much wasted in the thankless role of Lopez's loyal former beau.  The best performance in the film is given by Noah Wyle, playing against type as a hot-tempered renegade bad cop with a very bad case of road rage; it would be interesting to see Wyle play this type of role again, but in a better film.

I thought Jennifer Lopez was brilliant in ""Angel Eyes"" which was one of my favorite films.  While I'm mostly ignorant of her work as a singer, as an actress I've got to applaud.  As Slim in ""Enough"" Lopez is believable.  She shows an inner core of determination from which the character draws self respect and is stirred to action.  Juliette Lewis is good as the ""go girl"" cheerleader friend Ginny.  Noah Wylee is appropriately irritating as the friend of the wife beater who is a corrupt cop and searches out Slim.  Tessa Allen as the daughter is as cute as can be.  Judging Amy's Dan Futterman does a nice guy as Joe, Slim's old flame.  Fred Ward who played Earl Smooter in ""Sweet Home Alabama"" has a strong cameo as Jupiter.  Bill Campbell's bad guy Mitch is not so scary as obnoxious, which works for me as the film builds to the final showdown.  The subject of violence against women is one that pushes my button; so I reacted well to a film in which the woman fights back and wins.

We see the music video of the title song where Jennifer Lopez appears to be writing the words which were actually written by Aimee Mann.  All in all, this is another great movie.

715810,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00006HAWN,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","In ENOUGH, Jennifer Lopez recreates a perpetual Hollywood genre, that of the abused woman in peril.  We have seen this before most recently with Julia Roberts in SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.  And as with all such movies, the director has to define the line that separates the creepy and clammy feeling that one gets when one sees a dangerous and homicidal man trying to kill his wife from the vicariousness of revenge that one gets when the weirdo husband gets his comeuppance.Lopez is Slim a decent and caring woman who falls for a rich cad (Billy Campbell) and thinks that she has found a story book marriage.  She has an adorable girl (Tessie Allen). When she finds out that he is a serial cheater and wife abuser, she leaves him.  Up to this point, ENOUGH is a realistic drama of The Woman in Peril.  Following her hasty departure, Lopez shows a breathtaking lack of brains that sets the stage for the inevitable cat and mouse game that quickly morphs into a Hollywood revenge fantasy. Women who see this film will surely react on a visceral level that eludes men.  Most of the latter half involves the transformation of Lopez from helpless victim to remorseless avenger. Even though there is a decided predictability built into the scenes that depict this morphing, one cannot help but be carried along by Lopez's plight and then her counter strategy. By the film's end, the women in the audience have learned what they must have suspected from the first--when you are in danger of abuse GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GET A LAWYER. What men feel about the plight of abused women is hopefully the same.

Well, she ends up marrying the snake who rescues her and has several years worth of blissful ignorance, until she discovers the snake is having an affair. When she confronts him, the once mild mannered husband and father turns into a raving loon. Okay, so we are giving a small glimpse into his character when he threatens the old man to buy his house, but short of that, we have no clue until at least 4 or 5 years down the road that this guy is a real jerk - and abusive to boot.That's the first place where I think the movie kind of takes a bad turn.Next, we watch a lot of implausible scenes where none of the characters do anything that they should in the situation given at the time. While I liked the movie in general, I found myself saying out loud several times, ""Oh, that's just stupid. No one would ever do that!"" or ""What the heck was she thinking? That's not what someoen would really do!""In the end, the last scene, the retribution and redemption scene, is cheesy and WAY over the top. I was disappointed with the ending, and also disappointed that the loose end with Slim's real father was never tied up for us. She left him with, ""Not now, because it wouldn't be sincere, but at some point, when this is over, you need to admit I'm your kid."" (or something like that)... and he never did.

715819,A2X9QECJ5W6DOK,B00006HAWN,Natalie W,"[0, 2]","I'll just admit right off the bat that I only watched this movie for one reason: Billy Campbell.Sadly, he was the one actor that kept this movie above water for me. The little girl was OK too, but Campbell was the star in an otherwise crappy film.Fist of all, J-Lo should *really* stick to music because she's a terrible (over)actress, not to mention 5 times more annoying than when she's singing. Secondly, the entire plot felt ridiculously forced from beginning to end; especially that opening scene where Slim first meets Robbie in the restaurant. I don't know if I've seen a more awkward scene than that in a long time. Besides the plot seeming to be forced upon the viewer, the actors' performances didn't seem believable at all. Again, the only performance that I felt was believable was Billy Campbell. The rest of the cast just seemed like they were bored to tears or reading from cue cards.  Also, what was Noah Wyle thinking when he took this? He's so much better than this little part shows. Real shame.Sticking to the subject of believability, I just cannot understand why a woman would go through the amount of crap Slim did and not do anything to help herself and her little girl. Now, I've never personally been in an abusive relationship and I get that fear is often a reason why a woman would go back to her abuser, but saying &#34;Oh, no, no, no!&#34; and not taking some measure of protection against said abuser instead of simply escaping to a new place every time he tracks you down? Bogus. What's more, is that I can't believe that her family and friends didn't do more to help her, despite knowing that Mitch was beating her. Even when she refused help, the could've done a little more than just say &#34;OK then.&#34; and wait until the next beating.Most frustrating, crappy movie I've watched in a while.",1,Contrived Piece of Junk,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1829,"[""'ll"", 'just', 'admit', 'right', 'bat', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'Billy', 'Campbell.Sadly', 'was', 'one', 'actor', 'kept', 'movie', 'water', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'OK', 'too', 'Campbell', 'was', 'star', 'otherwise', 'crappy', 'film.Fist', 'J-Lo', 'should', '*really*', 'stick', 'music', 'terrible', 'actress', 'not', 'mention', '5', 'times', 'more', 'annoying', 'when', 'singing', 'Secondly', 'entire', 'plot', 'felt', 'ridiculously', 'forced', 'beginning', 'end', 'especially', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Slim', 'first', 'Robbie', 'restaurant', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'awkward', 'scene', 'long', 'time', 'plot', 'seeming', 'be', 'forced', 'viewer', 'actors', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believable', 'Again', 'only', 'performance', 'felt', 'was', 'believable', 'was', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'seemed', 'were', 'bored', 'tears', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'Also', 'what', 'was', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'thinking', 'when', 'took', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'little', 'part', 'shows', 'Real', 'shame.Sticking', 'subject', 'believability', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'woman', 'would', 'go', 'amount', 'crap', 'Slim', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'little', 'girl', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'personally', 'been', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'get', 'fear', 'often', 'reason', 'why', 'woman', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'abuser', 'saying', '34', 'Oh', '34', 'not', 'taking', 'measure', 'protection', 'said', 'abuser', 'instead', 'simply', 'escaping', 'new', 'place', 'time', 'down', 'Bogus', 'What', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'family', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'help', 'knowing', 'Mitch', 'was', 'beating', 'Even', 'when', 'refused', 'help', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'say', '34', 'OK', 'then.', '34', 'wait', 'next', 'beating.Most', 'frustrating', 'crappy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'while']",Enough

If it sounds like a tv movie, you're on the right track.  Domestic abuse is by no means an ordinary subject, but the filmmakers decided on the generic route and the result is two overdrawn hours of clich&eacute;s. There's nothing to expound on because you already know the formula; Slim (Lopez) and Mitch (Billy Campbell) - nice names - are in love, then he starts using her face for boxing practice. She decides she's had *enough* and, with their daughter in tow, makes a run for it. Slim's not going to take this lying down though, and she learns some hybrid of boxing and karate to combat his abuse. Watch out, Mitch......So many good things could have come from this film and yet it amounts to little more than two hours worth of dead brain cells. Regardless of her personal life, Jennifer Lopez is a decent actress, given a strong script. As there is none, she walks through the film, looking doe-eyed at times, tough at others, but mostly like she'd rather be making a music video. I actually enjoyed Billy Campbell's departure from his usual cheeky, nice guy role, but again, stretching a wife beater (no pun intended) around him doesn't exactly create character. And that's the problem with this farce of a film; there's no complexity to any character. Noah Wylie makes a brief appearance, coming and going whenever he pleases.So, some unanswered questions the filmmakers never bothered posing. Is it a drama, is it a thriller, is it a crime film? Who cares?! Slim isn't even interesting enough to elicit our empathy. Why was this film made? Certainly not for profit because it managed a negative dent at the box office. Nor were the writers much concerned about drawing out the emotional and physical strengths and weaknesses of women who suffer domestic violence.

You choose which format you want to view before the selection menu pops up. The extra features are sparse if any. You only get J-lo's video and some filmographies.

715828,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006HAWN,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","**1/2 In typical Hollywood fashion, ""Enough"" takes a serious social issue - spousal abuse - and uses it as the pretext for a run-of-the-mill damsel-in-distress thriller.  However, in keeping with our post-modern, feminist sensibilities, this heroine, is, as it turns out, as mad as hell and decides she's not going to take it anymore.  She is no passive victim of her circumstances like her earlier imperiled movie ing&eacute;nue sisters, but rather a gutsy fighter who takes a proactive role in determining her own fate and the fate of her daughter.  Jennifer Lopez plays ""Slim,"" a woman who starts out looking for a man who will ""protect"" her, but who, after she finds one (the wrong one), winds up kicking that slimy-assed dude's butt all around his swank, multimillion-dollar Marina home before she's through with him.Your enjoyment of this film will be pretty much predicated on how willing you are to overlook the predictability and implausibility of much of the plotting.  The film starts off well with an impressive twist involving Slim's initial meeting with the man, Mitch, who will quickly become both her husband and her stalker.  Yet, Mitch's conversion from doting lover to psychotic wife abuser is so abrupt and so poorly presaged by any actions or statements on his part that we are forced to question the credibility of pretty much everything else that follows.  Moreover, for a woman-on-the-run who is supposedly so adept at eluding her pursuer, Slim makes some pretty monumental blunders all the way through the story.  Particularly inexplicable is her decision to allow her little daughter to phone Mitch, an action that leads him and his goons in no time at all to the upper Michigan community where the two of them have been hitherto successfully hiding.  I also wonder why characters in movies, after they have knocked the villain senseless and he lies bleeding on the floor, always seem to turn their backs on him, even though we, in the audience, know full well that he will miraculously arise, Phoenix-like, from the ashes, to continue his murderous assault.  The heroine in ""Wait Until Dark"" at least had her blindness as justification for her doing that.  What is Slim's excuse?  (By the way, don't any of these characters ever go to the movies?  If they did, they would eliminate most, if not all, of their lapses into stupidity).However, given its many flaws, ""Enough"" turns out to be pretty effective entertainment within the prescribed limits of its genre.  Although she still isn't much of an actress, Jennifer Lopez manages to elicit the audience's empathy thanks primarily to the aura of immense likeability she exudes.

She breaks into the father of her child's house with the intent of murdering him and making it look like self defense.  She pummels this guy while wearing gloves, destroying the house, and doesn't have a mark on her when the cops show up.  I love how the movie just jumps from the cops telling her she's one of the lucky ones to her embracing her daughter at the airport. The cops are just going to say hey,""She said it was self defense, the guy was really big and she is a woman so it must be true, so let's go get some coffee.""That's BS after seeing her hands were completely scar free, no one is going to beleive she beat this guy with her fist on her own in a spur of the moment self defense action.  Also regardless if it actually was self defense it is still a homicide which I would hope would involve some sort of investigation. There is only one living witness to this action which I would hope involve a polygraph.  Any claim of self defense or even why she came to the house would hopefully be detected.  Once she is caught in one lie, which she would, her whole plan would come tumbling down.  She would probably be arrested and tried with first degree murder.  Once they put this woman on trial and proved that she beat her ex husband to death, I think she would probably face the death penalty considering how much trauma you have to inflict on someone to beat them to death.  I don't think the defense is going to buy a self defense case against an abusive husband, when he really only was abusive to her once in all their years of marriage.

Within the first ten minutes of the movie they get married. Well everythings fine and dandy until Slim discovers one evening a few years later that her husband is cheating on her.That was the first problem I had with the story.What kind of a guy cheats on Jennifer Lopez? ... .So when slim confronts her husband about this he ends up slapping her on the face. Idiot. So Slim finaly decides to pack up with her daughter and leave her husband. Ahhh but her husband really doesn't want her to go and let's just say that it's incredibly difficult for slim to finally leave. When she does she goes to her old boyfriend's house. While there so-called ""FBI"" agents knock on the door then basically ranshack the place looking for Slim and the daughter who are hidden safely. But that doesn't stop her mad husband from doing everything in his power to get slim back.The second problem is that I couldn't understand why he wants her back so bad after he obviously didn't want her there in the first place.That would end the movie though, we can't have that luxury.Along the way we have waaaaaay to many coincidences that take place with bad guys spotting slim at just the right moment for them convienently. Eventually by the time J Lo has finally had enough, just about all the audience has too. We know by the commercial that she has to kick her husbands .. in the end. And of course, she does.

715839,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00006HAWN,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[8, 14]","Enough takes the formulaic made-for TV battered woman story and actually makes a big screen movie sillier than its cheesy small screen counterparts. Another entry into pseudo-feminist category, Enough is a hypocritical movie that preaches empowerment but constantly shows its heroine being objectified and degraded. I hope by reading this review you'll avoid this horrible movie.Enough follows Slim, a waitress working at a Seattle Diner. (Strange she won't identify herself with her real name but objectifies herself by calling herself a shape) We never learn about Slim or her goals in life, she's just a beautiful woman in need of rescuing from her dead-end job. At work She meets up with a Mitch, a handsome rich customer. He woos her; after only minutes of screen time they're in love. Her unassuming ""Nice Guy(tm)"" boss warns her that Mitch bet him that he could get her into bed. He has the hots for her, too but Mr. Insecure doesn't say anything outside of that passive-aggressive(tm) warning. Despite OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS about Mitch's CHARACTER Slim continues dating him. Golddigger is just happy to have a rich man sweep her off her feet and save her.So Slim marries Mitch Charming and he decides to buy some guy's house just because he can. Oooh. POWER ISSUES. They have a child, but he won't let her hold her after giving BIRTH to her. Oooh. CONTROL ISSUES. Slim, distracted by Mitch's money can't see BIG RED FLAGS in front of her. It's not until five years later when she gets a call from another woman that she learns he's cheating on her. Instead of quietly taking money out of the joint account, and filing the divorce papers THEN, she confronts him. This leads to Mitch becoming abusive although he's never displayed this behavior previously. Psychology books say batterers have a PATTERN of behavior with women they date, but this movie follows Bizarro logic. He beats Slim down and slaps the kid around for good measure so we can hate him.Slim goes to the cops with a huge bruise on her face but decides to NOT have him arrested or take out a restraining order, fearing he'll take her daughter. She actually believes the malarkey a desk sergeant tells her about the legal system instead of consulting an attorney. Scared, she makes a run for it in the night. But Mitch thwarts her escape plans. After another beatdown, he menaces her adoptive Dad and friend with a gun saying they're trespassing. When she tries another run for it, he freezes her financial assets. So with borrowed money, Slim takes her daughter to a motel. There, Mitch makes a threatening call saying he's everywhere. You'd think after being beaten TWICE she'd keep a tape recorder on hand to record moments like this for EVIDENCE. Making TERRORISTIC THREATS over the phone is a FELONY. Mitch breaks open the hotel door and Slim has to escape. They head up to Seattle where her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" friend lets them stay with him and puts his passive(tm) moves on her. Cop friends of Mitch pose as FBI. They rough him up, knock down stuff and cut up a sofa. Stupid Mitch doesn't know that ""Nice Guy(tm)"" would be a WITNESS and these cops would be facing charges from IAB and FBI because Mitch's pockets aren't fat enough to protect them from FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES. Yes, Mitch here was STUPID enough to cross STATE LINES to commit his crimes. But Slim never keeps a RECORD of these incidents for EVIDENCE. She goes to real dad in San Fran for help, but gets none. You'd THINK she'd go to a library and study those wonderful Federal and state laws on the books and would be preparing her case with prosecutors.Not wanting to endanger her friends, Slim heads to another city. Detroit, Orlando, they all somehow look Like San Francisco in this movie. Turns out Mitch has friends even in THIS city to help him do his dirty work. Mitch may be a rich, real estate guy, but I don't think anyone is THIS well connected. He coincidentally knows cops in EVERY city Slim goes to? Come on. The cop he enlists to help him is aware that he's committing a crime, but follows orders. Mitch makes more terroristic threats over the phone that Slim isn't smart enough to record for EVIDENCE. This leads to a silly car chase where Slim is SMART ENOUGH TO EVADE HIM ON ROADS SHE KNOWS BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO CALL 911 DURING THE CHASE. Terrified, Slim heads back to San Francisco. Dad now decides to help out with his money and connections.Under Daddy's protection, Slim decides to FINALLY get legal advice from an attorney. She also decides to become ""empowered"" by training to kick Mitch's butt. I'd rather see her train to kick his butt in court with all the evidence shown throughout the movie, but she decides two wrongs will make right. Committing First-degree murder is far more satisfying to her than seeing Mitch and his colleagues go to prison.Final act, Slim breaks into Mitch's house. She plants signal jammers and shuts out the lights. ""Empowered"" in her belly baring cleavage-exposing black spandex outfit she prepares to confront him. She throws down with Mitch in one of the stupidest fight scenes ever filmed. It's never smart for a woman to take a man on in a fistfight because: A MAN IS EIGHT TIMES STRONGER IN HIS UPPER BODY THAN A WOMAN. He could have KILLED Slim with ONE PUNCH. It happens all the time in real life. Seriously. But following the Bizarro logic of this movie, Slim not only beats the crap out of the s Mitch, she KILLS him. After committing murder, (a handwriting expert would have easily figured out her letters were forgeries during the investigation), Slim goes on to live happily ever after with her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" diner owner friend, not knowing that he's just like man she just murdered. (Read my review of The Last American Virgin to learn why ""Nice Guys(tm)"" are dangerous.)Like its contemporaries The Rich Man's Wife, Gang of Roses, and Catwoman in the Pseudo Feminist genre, Enough makes a mockery of feminism with its sexist message of ""empowerment."" The wrongheaded ideas in this movie tell women to overcome domestic violence with violence, not seek counseling to deal with the emotional trauma or plan a legal strategy. It's interesting to note like in those other mentioned movies, the more ""empowered"" Slim becomes, the less clothing she wears. We never get to see Slim's face during the movie, only her body parts. This segmenting of her body takes away from her humanity and prevents us from connecting with her emotionally.Production values on this movie are not ""Enough"" considering the talent. The poorly written screenplay has dialogue that comes from the first draft of a Learning Annex student. Scenes don't transition into each other smoothly leading to a disjointed uneven story.Plain and simple, the acting is downright wretched in this movie. Jennifer Lopez is horrible in the role of Slim. She plays her character with no emotion in most scenes and is over the top in others. Billy Campbell is ridiculous to watch as the batterer. He is a cartoon character who gets more over the top with each scene.Don't get ""Enough"" at all. Pick up the far superior Sleeping with the Enemy.",1,More Pseudo Feminism.

715843,A2P53AOZ3D9S52,B00006HAWN,"""shoestomp""","[0, 0]","Yeah, I know, it's a predictable, forgettable, trifle. And that it's an excuse for Jennifer Lopez and Bill Campbell to get really dramatic and play an abused wife and an abusive husband, and hopefully score some Oscar buzz. It's also an exploitation flick, utilizing Lopez's rapport with female audiences and her booty-obsessed men as a means of making a few dollars for a film that's been told before. But the movie has a message, guys. Yes, it does. The movie is really a cautionary tale. Yeah, girls will learn much from this film. What, you ask? Well, about being independent, that's what.You see, Lopez's character, Slim, was abandoned by her rich, unfaithful father, and loss her mother to death. Slim would later go on to attend college, but only temporarily, since she was unable to pay for tuition and everything else that girls love to empty their pocketbooks with. So she works as a waitress for a fast-food diner, wishing that she would one day meet a nice fellah with a bulging pocket.Slim, be careful what you wish for, `cause you just might get it.And boy does she get it.Her ""prince charming"" comes in the form of a handsome, affluent man, named Mitch Hiller, who also happens to have a phobia for monogamy. Most women would cry out-right that he is nothing but a low down dirty dog. Which he is. And like most men, he uses the ""men have needs"" excuse, hoping to maybe calm Silm's embarrassment and sense of self-worthlessness.Actually, he figures he has the right to do whatever he wants in this relationship because he is the sole provider. Which he is. Slim of course quit her job as a waitress and is now a housewife; as dependent on her husband as she was to her father, and her mother to her husband. Talk about regression.What's sad about this story is the fact that Slim isn't responsible for the path her life has taken (what, you think so?). Who knows beforehand that their boyfriend or husband has a penchant for cheating? Slim, not some lazy bimbo dreaming of one day living totally off her beau, was actually determined to go to college, get an education, find a suitable, high-paying job, and independently support herself. But as a character reminds her late in the story, ""the universe has a way of working against us."" Which it did.But I suppose she should have expected at least a wrinkle or two to rear its ugly head, what with her life being so perfect and all, living in a epic lap of luxury. Yes, she should have. But as she says, ""I'm not the sort of woman that men just beat up."" Which is true. Why a guy would want to abuse and cheat on a woman with such a face and bodacious body is totally beyond me.Ultimately, the film becomes a minor feminist piece about a once weak woman gaining at least the physical strength to dominate her chauvinistic husband. Yes, this is what you all expected, as the film is a product of crowd-pleasing Hollywood and all.Jennifer Lopez revealed herself to be an effortlessly charismatic, confident, wholly sympathetic, and cool actress in such films as Selena, Out of Sight, and even Anaconda. In this film, she's required to be ten-times more emotional, a thespian calling attention to herself, during the early confrontational scenes between her and her beau. Only as the film continues, where Slim is desperate to escape her hubby's evil clutches and must think up ways to avoid his wrath, does she replace the over-the-top acting for a reserved cool.Bill Campbell, in the role of the abusive husband, relishes every minute of playing this character. He's kind of effortlessly intimidating and creepily chilly. This actor, too, is playing against type. Television buffs might remember him from the critically-acclaimed Once &amp; Again, where he portrayed, well, a saint.The film, while not flawless, is certainly better than it should be. Everything you expect to happen happens. But it's only because the heroine is a sympathetic character that her travails mean anything.",3,Surprisingly rewatchable,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,3949,"['Yeah', 'know', 'predictable', 'forgettable', 'trifle', 'excuse', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Bill', 'Campbell', 'get', 'really', 'dramatic', 'play', 'abused', 'wife', 'abusive', 'husband', 'hopefully', 'score', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'also', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'utilizing', 'Lopez', 'rapport', 'female', 'audiences', 'booty-obsessed', 'men', 'means', 'making', 'few', 'dollars', 'film', 'been', 'told', 'movie', 'message', 'guys', 'Yes', 'movie', 'really', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'Yeah', 'girls', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'film', 'What', 'ask', 'Well', 'being', 'independent', 'what.You', 'see', 'Lopez', 'character', 'Slim', 'was', 'abandoned', 'rich', 'unfaithful', 'father', 'loss', 'mother', 'death', 'Slim', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'attend', 'college', 'only', 'temporarily', 'was', 'unable', 'pay', 'tuition', 'everything', 'else', 'girls', 'love', 'empty', 'pocketbooks', 'waitress', 'fast-food', 'diner', 'wishing', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'meet', 'nice', 'fellah', 'bulging', 'pocket.Slim', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'cause', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'it.And', 'boy', 'get', 'it.Her', 'prince', 'charming', 'form', 'handsome', 'affluent', 'man', 'named', 'Mitch', 'Hiller', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'phobia', 'monogamy', 'Most', 'women', 'would', 'cry', 'out-right', 'nothing', 'low', 'down', 'dirty', 'dog', 'most', 'men', 'men', 'have', 'needs', 'excuse', 'hoping', 'maybe', 'calm', 'Silm', 'embarrassment', 'sense', 'self-worthlessness.Actually', 'right', 'do', 'whatever', 'relationship', 'sole', 'provider', 'Slim', 'course', 'quit', 'job', 'waitress', 'now', 'housewife', 'dependent', 'husband', 'was', 'father', 'mother', 'husband', 'Talk', 'regression.What', 'sad', 'story', 'fact', 'Slim', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'path', 'life', 'taken', 'what', 'think', 'so', 'Who', 'beforehand', 'boyfriend', 'husband', 'penchant', 'cheating', 'Slim', 'not', 'lazy', 'bimbo', 'dreaming', 'one', 'day', 'living', 'totally', 'beau', 'was', 'actually', 'determined', 'go', 'college', 'get', 'education', 'find', 'suitable', 'high-paying', 'job', 'independently', 'support', 'character', 'late', 'story', 'universe', 'way', 'working', 'suppose', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'least', 'wrinkle', 'two', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'what', 'life', 'being', 'so', 'perfect', 'living', 'epic', 'lap', 'luxury', 'Yes', 'should', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'sort', 'woman', 'men', 'just', 'beat', 'up', 'Which', 'true', 'Why', 'guy', 'would', 'want', 'abuse', 'cheat', 'woman', 'face', 'bodacious', 'body', 'totally', 'me.Ultimately', 'film', 'minor', 'feminist', 'piece', 'once', 'weak', 'woman', 'gaining', 'least', 'physical', 'strength', 'dominate', 'chauvinistic', 'husband', 'Yes', 'what', 'expected', 'film', 'product', 'crowd-pleasing', 'Hollywood', 'all.Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'revealed', 'be', 'effortlessly', 'charismatic', 'confident', 'wholly', 'sympathetic', 'cool', 'actress', 'such', 'films', 'Selena', 'Out', 'Sight', 'even', 'Anaconda', 'film', 'required', 'be', 'ten-times', 'more', 'emotional', 'thespian', 'calling', 'attention', 'herself', 'early', 'confrontational', 'scenes', 'beau', 'Only', 'film', 'where', 'Slim', 'desperate', 'escape', 'hubby', 'evil', 'clutches', 'must', 'think', 'up', 'ways', 'avoid', 'wrath', 'replace', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'reserved', 'cool.Bill', 'Campbell', 'role', 'abusive', 'husband', 'relishes', 'minute', 'playing', 'character', 'kind', 'effortlessly', 'intimidating', 'creepily', 'chilly', 'actor', 'too', 'playing', 'type', 'Television', 'buffs', 'might', 'remember', 'critically-acclaimed', 'Once', 'amp', 'Again', 'where', 'portrayed', 'well', 'saint.The', 'film', 'not', 'flawless', 'certainly', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'Everything', 'expect', 'happen', 'happens', 'only', 'heroine', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'travails', 'mean', 'anything']",Enough

The movie likes to fancy itself as a feminist picture, but I don't buy it for a minute.  Plausibility is thrown out the window, and in its place are a predictable script and cliched dialogue (&quot;If I can't have you, then no one else will.&quot;).  When this movie came out in the summer of 2002, it totally bombed at the box office.  Gee, no small wonder when you consider the plot: boy meets girl at diner; boy marries girl; boy loses temper and slaps girl around; girl takes child and relocate to get away from boy; girl takes fighting lessons and beats the crapola out of boy.  Quite frankly, for a real movie on domestic violence, I'd stick with &quot;The Burning Bed,&quot; starring Farrah Fawcett.  True, that movie had some of the ingredients of a Lifetime feature presentation, but it had something &quot;Enough&quot; doesn't have: believability and depth.  I'm also curious as to why Jennifer Lopez, a fairly decent actress, and director Michael Apted, an otherwise capable filmmaker, would bother with exploitative trash like this.

Well, I guess its good to see a horribly contrived story that details how an abused woman can train like a ninja to kill her spouse, of whom she's had ""Enough,"" right? This movie was just nonsensically stupid....by comparison, even ""XXX"" seemed more realistic and competent than this J.Lo bomb. I am so sick of Hollywood forcing J.Lo's terrible starring roles down our throats just because she's attractive (she's only made one really good movie - ""Out Of Sight""). I won't even try to break down the film's plot for you, because if you read my synopsis, blood would come gushing out of your nose and ears due to the fact that your brain had exploded. In fact, the horrors that I witnessed whilst watching this debacle of a movie should never fall upon another human being's eyes. I saw things that were so horrible that if I dared repeat them to you, you would flee from your computer in utter horror. This movie was so laughable that I was in tears during the final fight where J.Lo hears her kung-fu teacher, or whatever he was, in her mind like Obi-Wan Kenobi. In today's world of reality television, it would have been more interesting to have seen this ordeal play out as if it had been a TV show. Actually, I would have settled for J.Lo beating her husband's rear in the courtroom. But no, that would have made too much sense. Listen, I don't want to knock the movie because of the fact that a woman fights back physically against her husband, its just that the concept is so stupidly done that it takes away from the message that the film is trying to get across.

At least, the opening 30 minutes of the film is not that ridiculous and impossible, following the life of waitress J-Lo's &quot;Slim&quot; who meets a rich, hunky guy in a diner where she works for, marries him, and has a lovely daughter.  So far, nothing is wrong with the movie.But J-Lo and director Michael Apted, who possibly loves to depict strong women, should have known that when they deal with a delicate matter like domestic violence, they have to be extra-careful about the subject matter.  The issue is, as everyone knows, a very serious one.  When you know that, can you make a crowd-pleasing thriller out of it?  Maybe yes.  But even in that case, you cannot make the battered wife act the way &quot;Enough&quot; shows in the following 90 minutes.I do not write down every detail of what Silm does after she realizes that her husband is no longer an amiable All-American guy, but a wife-beating brute, except this.  Slim knows there are such people as lawyers and the police, and possibly shelters; she has a best friend Juliette Lewis who listens to her, and is truely willing to help; she has plenty of money (how did she get it?  Don't ask me); but every step Slim takes is, I suppose, the worst (or most labored) one we can think of.  In short, she runs, runs, and runs.  The word &quot;manipulative&quot; is too weak here when the abusive husband has equally incredible power at hand to track down her, which easily matches that of FBI.  Especially when the husband is portrayed by miscast and hammy Billy Campbell.I should not talk about the climax, which gives another incredible ride to this revenge story.

715859,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00006HAWN,William Hare,"[2, 3]","Michael Apted launched his career as a director with an imaginative and winning BBC documentary, ""42 Up"", a continuing account of how certain selected British youngsters of 7 have fared up to age 42 and still counting, updates occurring at seven year intervals.The British director stakes out more commercial ground in ""Enough"" and therein lies the film's problem.  The commercialism designed to draw patrons blurs what could have been a better overall result with a subtle, more sophisticated story line.  Jennifer Lopez successfully demonstrated she has the emotion and range to handle roles beyond glamour and fluff.  In fact, early in the film her fellow waitress and sidekick, played by Juliette Lewis, exclaims, ""Let's face it, Slim.  You'll never get a guy on your looks.""  As the film's star, Lopez could surely have vetoed that line.  Its inclusion implies assent from a woman trying to make her mark as a dramatic performer.The story's launching point is when Jennifer meets Bill Campbell, who becomes an immediate knight in shining armor when he puts a wise guy who has made a bet he can sleep with waitress Lopez in his place.  He tells the guy to take a powder and a grateful Lopez is happy to begin seeing him, after which they are married following a whirlwind courtship.  She thinks she has become Cinderella when she learns that he is a highly successful building contractor.  The former impoverished waitress soon becomes a yuppie suburban housewife with a lovely young daughter, having to pinch herself to see if it is all for real.She soon learns that the relationship is not what it seems.  When she discovers that her husband is having an affair with a French woman who calls on the phone attempting to reach him, his other ogrish side is revealed.  He hits her hard, then coolly reveals he will hit her any time he pleases.The relationship ends and Lopez strives to retain her child.  Campbell is used to having his way, at one point sending out a team of renegade FBI men to ""make a point"" after she goes to Seattle to live with an old flame, played by Dan Futterman.  The story escalates from that point as Lopez, knowing her ex is attempting to kill her, launches a counter assault after any and all legal avenues are foreclosed by the rich and wily Campbell.This film makes some good points about the problems women face from abusive spouses, particularly how difficult it is for a woman to attain justice in the face of superior economic power in the hands of a husband.  The area where it could have been better is that Lopez plans to strike back physically, seeking revenge on Campbell's own turf, where he seeks to bully her.  As such ""Enough"" is somewhat reminiscent of Charles Bronson's big hits of the seventies when he struck back at street lawlessness as ""The Vigilante.""  Audiences would cheer approval in theaters as villains were dispatched, reminiscent of old movie serials.  Had this film pursued a more subtle approach, where a wily Lopez finds a way to strike back at Campbell within the system, ""Enough"" would have been a more imaginative and ultimately higher quality film.",3,"Good Concept, More Imagination Needed",1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,3118,"['Michael', 'Apted', 'launched', 'career', 'director', 'imaginative', 'winning', 'BBC', 'documentary', '42', 'Up', 'continuing', 'account', 'how', 'certain', 'selected', 'British', 'youngsters', '7', 'have', 'fared', 'up', 'age', '42', 'still', 'counting', 'occurring', 'seven', 'year', 'intervals.The', 'British', 'director', 'stakes', 'out', 'more', 'commercial', 'ground', 'Enough', 'therein', 'film', 'problem', 'commercialism', 'designed', 'draw', 'patrons', 'blurs', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'overall', 'result', 'subtle', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'story', 'line', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'successfully', 'demonstrated', 'emotion', 'range', 'handle', 'roles', 'glamour', 'fluff', 'fact', 'early', 'film', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Let', 'face', 'Slim', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'guy', 'looks', 'film', 'star', 'Lopez', 'could', 'surely', 'have', 'vetoed', 'line', 'inclusion', 'implies', 'assent', 'woman', 'trying', 'make', 'mark', 'dramatic', 'performer.The', 'story', 'launching', 'point', 'when', 'Jennifer', 'Bill', 'Campbell', 'who', 'immediate', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'when', 'wise', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'bet', 'can', 'sleep', 'waitress', 'Lopez', 'place', 'guy', 'take', 'powder', 'grateful', 'Lopez', 'happy', 'begin', 'seeing', 'are', 'married', 'following', 'whirlwind', 'courtship', 'become', 'Cinderella', 'when', 'highly', 'successful', 'building', 'contractor', 'former', 'impoverished', 'waitress', 'soon', 'yuppie', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'lovely', 'young', 'daughter', 'having', 'pinch', 'see', 'real.She', 'soon', 'relationship', 'not', 'what', 'When', 'husband', 'having', 'affair', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'phone', 'attempting', 'reach', 'other', 'ogrish', 'side', 'revealed', 'hard', 'then', 'coolly', 'will', 'hit', 'time', 'relationship', 'ends', 'Lopez', 'retain', 'child', 'Campbell', 'used', 'having', 'way', 'one', 'point', 'sending', 'out', 'team', 'renegade', 'FBI', 'men', 'make', 'point', 'Seattle', 'live', 'old', 'flame', 'played', 'Dan', 'Futterman', 'story', 'point', 'Lopez', 'knowing', 'ex', 'attempting', 'kill', 'counter', 'assault', 'legal', 'avenues', 'are', 'foreclosed', 'rich', 'wily', 'Campbell.This', 'film', 'good', 'points', 'problems', 'women', 'face', 'abusive', 'spouses', 'particularly', 'how', 'difficult', 'woman', 'attain', 'justice', 'face', 'superior', 'economic', 'power', 'hands', 'husband', 'area', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Lopez', 'strike', 'back', 'physically', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Campbell', 'own', 'turf', 'where', 'bully', 'such', 'Enough', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'big', 'hits', 'seventies', 'when', 'struck', 'back', 'street', 'lawlessness', 'Vigilante', 'Audiences', 'would', 'cheer', 'approval', 'theaters', 'villains', 'were', 'dispatched', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'movie', 'serials', 'Had', 'film', 'pursued', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'where', 'wily', 'Lopez', 'way', 'strike', 'back', 'Campbell', 'system', 'Enough', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'imaginative', 'ultimately', 'higher', 'quality', 'film']",Enough
