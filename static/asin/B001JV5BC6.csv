Tyler is still displaying a message in this play as all the others that he's produced what can happen in real life in a marriage when two people that are high professionals themselves can drift away or get lost in their careers. It's so easy to get caught up in other things that can cause an effect on a marriage if you're not paying attention to what's going on .  My man Palmer took the show off the hook. I've studied all of the people Tyler has chosen in each play since the beginning, but Palmer has out aced them all. This man is not talented he has been born with the gift from birth. Anthony I've seen in some of the play's also is great.  When he played the part in Why did I get married I fell in love with him right then and was hoping that Tyler would us him more. In marriage counselor when he founded out that his wife had commit cheated on him and he set there a cried tore me up. At the same time he was not paying attention to her needs where he should. It was a play to demonstrate how in real life what can happen when we don't place God as our captain.  We are bound to allow the adversary trick us and we fall and drift the wrong way.

Instead I watched the play ""Man of Her Dreams"" & it was off the hook! So this afternoon I tried ""The Marriage Counselor"" again. I winced throughout it but I told myself I had to finish it. It was such a disappointment. If Tyler Perry's name wasn't on it I wouldn't have recognized it as one of his. This must've been during a slump. The script wasn't good, and the acting was needs-improvement. Most of the actors were overacting & it was bad at that! I winced through much of the counseling scenes because these people were ghetto beyond belief. Tyler embraced the stereotype of loud black people who talk to much and never listen. Tony Grant is good in everything I've seen him in, and he did a good job despite the limits placed upon him. He had to play a dummy though. I thought I was watching a replay of the idiot husband from 'The Family That Preys' I was irritated with him. The female lead was great! Can't wait to see her in something else. The parents were ugggghhhhhh. The preacher/stripper couple were much too ghetto for me. The white chick could blow, but that's all she should've done. Her role was terrible & I couldn't stand watching the scenes she was in.",2,Disappointment,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1301,"['began', 'watching', 'play', 'last', 'night', 'Not', 'even', '10', 'minutes', 'popped', 'right', 'back', 'out', 'got', 'off', 'bad', 'start', 'Instead', 'watched', 'play', 'Man', 'Her', 'Dreams', 'was', 'hook', 'So', 'afternoon', 'tried', 'Marriage', 'Counselor', 'again', 'winced', 'told', 'had', 'finish', 'was', 'such', 'disappointment', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'recognized', 'one', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'slump', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'needs-improvement', 'Most', 'actors', 'were', 'overacting', 'was', 'bad', 'winced', 'much', 'counseling', 'scenes', 'people', 'were', 'ghetto', 'belief', 'Tyler', 'embraced', 'stereotype', 'loud', 'black', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'much', 'never', 'listen', 'Tony', 'Grant', 'good', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'limits', 'placed', 'had', 'play', 'dummy', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'replay', 'idiot', 'husband', ""'The"", 'Family', 'Preys', 'was', 'irritated', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'great', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'parents', 'were', 'ugggghhhhhh', 'preacher/stripper', 'couple', 'were', 'much', 'too', 'ghetto', 'white', 'chick', 'could', 'blow', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'role', 'was', 'terrible', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'scenes', 'was']",The Marriage Counselor
