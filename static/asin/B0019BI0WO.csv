This one strays even farther from any possible connection with history...I think the main difference is that this one can't decide if the protagonist is a hero or a comedian.  The Round Table is presented pretty much as a collection of characters, none of whom are particulary outstanding in any way.  None of the crises that arise are particularly interesting or important.  One gets the feeling that England is a sort of medieval Gillegan's Island...but without the laugh track...which sounds like a plus, but if you had it, you'd at least know when they were TRYING to be funny...I recommend Robin Hood and William tell, and even Buccaneers, over this series---still, it's better than what's being turned out now...",3,"Cute, but kinda silly...",1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,794,"['cutesie', 'little', '50', 'offering', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'William', 'Tell', 'one', 'even', 'farther', 'possible', 'connection', 'history', 'think', 'main', 'difference', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'comedian', 'Round', 'Table', 'presented', 'pretty', 'much', 'collection', 'characters', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'particulary', 'outstanding', 'way', 'None', 'crises', 'arise', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'important', 'One', 'feeling', 'England', 'sort', 'medieval', 'Gillegan', 'Island', 'laugh', 'track', 'plus', 'had', ""'d"", 'least', 'know', 'when', 'were', 'TRYING', 'be', 'funny', 'recommend', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'William', 'tell', 'even', 'Buccaneers', 'series', '-still', 'better', 'what', 'being', 'turned', 'out', 'now']",N/A

Quality a little rough in places in some episodes but over-all I found the episodes fine, and for the price; for the age - I think this is a pretty good set and a worthy addition to my classic tv shelf. Some of the episodes are in color - though frankly I wish they had remained in black & white.I don't actually remember this show at all and so I am hooked. Like The Adventures of Robin Hood, it is a good companion set to that and a great fill in for half an hour (each episode).Great memories and simple pleasures of the past.

1162836,A1NX2OBV6S4QUD,B0019BI0WO,Readz Alot,"[2, 2]","This DVD set is likely to be primarily of interest to fans of classic Dr. Who.  The title character is played by William Russell, who went on, a couple of years later, to play Ian Chesterton, one of the first Doctor's companions.While it's definitely interesting to watch William Russell in a different role, I fear that the series has little else going for it.  The acting is about as wooden as the practice swords that the knights use while sparring.  The actors seem to do their best, (many of the actors, including Russell, have proved themselves able to do far better in other programs) but there is little they can do with the painfully bad dialogue and silly story lines. Robert Scroggins, as Lancelot's young squire Brian, does about the best job -- maybe he was too young to be embarrassed by it all.  The fight scenes are lumbering, and the nature of the story lines means that every episode has at least one fight scene.Having said all that, it does manage to be fairly entertaining, and it's quite inexpensive for a 3 disc set.  So if you are a fan of classic Dr. Who, or 1950's television, it's worth picking up.The DVDs are of reasonably good quality, though there no extras of any kind.",3,Has its moments,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1201,"['DVD', 'set', 'likely', 'be', 'primarily', 'interest', 'fans', 'classic', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'William', 'Russell', 'who', 'went', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'play', 'Ian', 'Chesterton', 'one', 'first', 'Doctor', 'companions.While', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'watch', 'William', 'Russell', 'different', 'role', 'fear', 'series', 'little', 'else', 'going', 'acting', 'as', 'wooden', 'practice', 'swords', 'knights', 'use', 'sparring', 'actors', 'seem', 'do', 'best', 'many', 'actors', 'including', 'Russell', 'have', 'proved', 'able', 'do', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'programs', 'little', 'can', 'do', 'painfully', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'silly', 'story', 'lines', 'Robert', 'Scroggins', 'Lancelot', 'young', 'squire', 'Brian', 'best', 'job', 'maybe', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'lumbering', 'nature', 'story', 'lines', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'fight', 'scene.Having', 'said', 'manage', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'inexpensive', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'Dr.', 'Who', '1950', 'television', 'worth', 'picking', 'up.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'quality', 'extras', 'kind']",N/A

1162838,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B0019BI0WO,Robert Huggins,"[46, 46]","""The Adventures of Sir Lancelot"" (NBC, 1956-57) was one of several costume adventure series produced in England that followed the very successful release of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (CBS, 1955-58) a year earlier on CBS.  Produced by Sapphire Films, the company that produced ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Buccaneers"" (CBS, 1956-57), ""Sir Lancelot"" brought the legend of King Arthur and Camelot to the small screen.  Although it only lasted a single season, ""The Adventures of Sir Lancelot"" is historically important in the annals of television history as it was the first British television series with multiple episodes produced in color.""The Adventures of Sir Lancelot"" was issued on DVD in its entirety in England by a company called Network, but previous U.S. DVD releases have been limited to a few selected episodes on discs such asThe Adventures of Sir Lancelot Volume 1andThe Adventures of Sir Lancelot, Vol. 1.  With the release of this 3-DVD, 30-episode set from Timeless Media, those previous releases are no longer necessary for anyone collecting episodes from the show; this release has it all.  The series' entire run of 30 episodes is included in this set and the audio/visual quality, while far from perfect, represents a major improvement over all previous U.S. DVD releases of the series.  Most importantly, 12 of the 14 color episodes that were produced have survived the ravages of time and are included in this set.  Some of the color episodes are faded and a few are quite vivid, but the color episodes were, apparently, only broadcast during the 1956-57 season and subsequent airings of the series were broadcast in black & white.  So it's a revelation to see the color schemes employed for this show after more than half a century.William Russell is well cast in the starring role as the gallant knight, and other cast regulars included Ronald Leigh-Hunt as King Arthur (Bruce Seton portrays Arthur for the first three episodes), Jane Hylton as Queen Guinevere, Cyril Smith as Merlin and Robert Scroggins as Squire Brian.  British character actors like Nigel Green and Derren ""Derry"" Nesbitt are featured as different characters in numerous episodes, and Patrick McGoohan makes one of his earliest television appearances as a villainous knight in one of the series' early episodes titled ""The Outcast.""This release is a must for anyone who enjoys the British costume adventure shows of the mid to late 1950s and early 1960s.  Timeless Media has also released episode compilations ofThe Adventures of Robin Hood,The BuccaneersandWilliam Tell.  All of these series are enjoyable and highly recommended.My rating for ""The Adventures of Sir Lancelot"" is closer to **** & 1/2 due to some comparatively minor film flaws here and there as well as some of the faded color issues previously mentioned, but it's really not much of a deterrent to anyone's enjoyment of this series.",5,"The Definitive U.S. Release of the ""Sir Lancelot"" Television Series",1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,2892,"['Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'NBC', '1956-57', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'costume', 'adventure', 'series', 'produced', 'England', 'followed', 'very', 'successful', 'release', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'CBS', '1955-58', 'year', 'earlier', 'CBS', 'Produced', 'Sapphire', 'Films', 'company', 'produced', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Buccaneers', 'CBS', '1956-57', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'brought', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Camelot', 'small', 'screen', 'only', 'lasted', 'single', 'season', 'Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'historically', 'important', 'annals', 'television', 'history', 'was', 'first', 'British', 'television', 'series', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'produced', 'color', 'Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'was', 'issued', 'DVD', 'entirety', 'England', 'company', 'called', 'Network', 'previous', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'limited', 'few', 'selected', 'episodes', 'discs', 'such', 'asThe', 'Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'Volume', '1andThe', 'Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'Vol', '1', 'release', '3-DVD', '30-episode', 'set', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'previous', 'releases', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'necessary', 'anyone', 'collecting', 'episodes', 'show', 'release', 'series', 'entire', 'run', '30', 'episodes', 'included', 'set', 'audio/visual', 'quality', 'far', 'perfect', 'major', 'improvement', 'previous', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'releases', 'series', 'Most', 'importantly', '12', '14', 'color', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', 'have', 'survived', 'ravages', 'time', 'are', 'included', 'set', 'color', 'episodes', 'are', 'faded', 'few', 'are', 'quite', 'vivid', 'color', 'episodes', 'were', 'apparently', 'only', 'broadcast', '1956-57', 'season', 'subsequent', 'airings', 'series', 'were', 'broadcast', 'black', 'white', 'revelation', 'see', 'color', 'employed', 'show', 'more', 'century.William', 'Russell', 'well', 'cast', 'starring', 'role', 'gallant', 'knight', 'other', 'cast', 'regulars', 'included', 'Ronald', 'Leigh-Hunt', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Bruce', 'Seton', 'Arthur', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'Jane', 'Hylton', 'Queen', 'Guinevere', 'Cyril', 'Smith', 'Merlin', 'Robert', 'Scroggins', 'Squire', 'Brian', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'Nigel', 'Green', 'Derren', 'Derry', 'Nesbitt', 'are', 'featured', 'different', 'characters', 'numerous', 'episodes', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'one', 'earliest', 'television', 'appearances', 'villainous', 'knight', 'one', 'series', 'early', 'episodes', 'titled', 'Outcast', 'release', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'British', 'costume', 'adventure', 'shows', 'mid', 'late', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'also', 'released', 'episode', 'compilations', 'ofThe', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'BuccaneersandWilliam', 'Tell', 'series', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'recommended.My', 'rating', 'Adventures', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'closer', '****', '1/2', 'due', 'comparatively', 'minor', 'film', 'flaws', 'here', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'faded', 'color', 'issues', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'deterrent', 'anyone', 'enjoyment', 'series']",N/A
