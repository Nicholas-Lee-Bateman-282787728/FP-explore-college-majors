Louis Jordan plays the tutod in love with the pricess.It is a delightful story in which all the actors are exceptional from the minor to the major ones.

1396495,A3UZQ1IW3XUZ73,B004CZRE44,"B. Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[8, 8]","One of my favorite films, THE SWAN features an all-star cast: Grace Kelly (her last role before assuming the role as a real princess!), Alec Guinness, Louis Jordan, Agnes Morehead, Leo G. Carroll, Brian Aherne, and Estelle Winwood. Well-scripted and beautifully shot, THE SWAN  rises above the level of other 1950s costumers. Guinness brings both humor and wisdom to his portrayal of Prince Albert, and Kelly is suitably ""cold"" as Princess Alexandra. Agnes Morehead and Estelle Winwood steal scenes with their hilarious lines and bluff and bluster.One note: my copy was actually in the PAL format and played just fine on my ""all regions"" DVD player, but you might want to be certain about the format. (All regions DVD players can be had fairly easily; I acquired one via online shopping from Illinois for about $65-$70).Highly recommended.

1396499,A1CVM427QH52BL,B004CZRE44,Michael T Kennedy,"[0, 0]","This movie was made in 1956 and was her last film. It was also the first US film by Alec Guinness, who played the prince. Wikipedia says it was offered to other actors but I think he is terrific in the role. The story is about a family, formerly royal, residing in a small middle eastern country in the period before World War I. It reminds me very much of the Prisoner of Zenda, a novel and movie about a similar country in that period. It is sort of sad to think that the characters will be engulfed by the war soon but the story is enjoyable. The princess, Alexandra, wants to be a queen and her mother yearns for the prince to marry her. His mother, the queen, played by Agnes Moorhead, and the tutor, played by Louis Jordan, are excellent. The scenery is gorgeous and the story is enjoyable. The release of the movie was held up until she married Prince Rainier, by all accounts a dullard, so she made a similar bargain with life as the fictional Alexandra.Highly recommended.",5,Grace Kelly in her prime.,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,981,"['movie', 'was', 'made', '1956', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'US', 'film', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'who', 'played', 'prince', 'Wikipedia', 'was', 'offered', 'other', 'actors', 'think', 'terrific', 'role', 'story', 'family', 'formerly', 'royal', 'residing', 'small', 'middle', 'eastern', 'country', 'period', 'World', 'War', 'very', 'much', 'Prisoner', 'Zenda', 'novel', 'movie', 'similar', 'country', 'period', 'sort', 'sad', 'think', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'engulfed', 'war', 'soon', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'princess', 'Alexandra', 'be', 'queen', 'mother', 'yearns', 'prince', 'marry', 'mother', 'queen', 'played', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'tutor', 'played', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'held', 'up', 'married', 'Prince', 'Rainier', 'accounts', 'dullard', 'made', 'similar', 'bargain', 'life', 'fictional', 'Alexandra.Highly', 'recommended']",The Swan
