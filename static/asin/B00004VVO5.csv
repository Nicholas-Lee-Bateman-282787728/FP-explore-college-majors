552842,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00004VVO5,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 5]","This is a story of two worlds, one through the eyes of a blind young boy and the other of his widowed father.  The blind boy's existence is the beauty and nature that he connects with, and of course, a Granny and two sisters who love him.  The other side is the self-pity, misery and selfishness that lives within his father.Mohammad attends a school for the blind and for the 3-month break, his father almost doesn't come to pick him up, and arriving late, he asks the school to keep his son.  They cannot do it.The boy comes home to his endearing grandmother and two sisters, only to have his father plot to give the boy away because father feels so burdened as a widow, and can't bear the thought of more misery by caring for a blind boy the rest of his life.It's Granny who recognizes the selfishness of the father and isn't concerned how the blind boy will make it through life, she worries about his father.  He breaks down easily, is lonely, and miserable man who wants to marry a woman.  Surely, the boy is in his way now.This is an outstanding cast, from the father, Granny, and surely the performance of the boy is actually blind.  The scenery is beautiful.Director Majid Majidi's most popular movie shown in the U.S. isThe Children of Heavenwhere two children learn to share one pair of shoes at school rather than impose on their poor family for new ones.

This is the kind of story for which film is made, because the filmmaker can show the astounding beauty of the world around the central character and then give the viewer a sense of how the boy perceives such beauty. It was fascinating to watch and heartbreaking to witness the inevitable conclusion. Majidi masterfully brings the viewer from a state of judging the father to understanding the agony of the father while simultaneously charming the viewer with the boy's abilities to embrace his world. Mohammed has a special understanding of animals, a sense for the changes of the natural world far beyond that of his sighted companions, and--one begins to feel--a connection to the universe (the film's title translates to ""The Color of God"") far deeper than that of his father. His father is somehow condemned to his horrible fate of losing everything and exist without his son's special attributes.

552845,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00004VVO5,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[103, 108]","You may find it difficult to rent a quiet, deceptively simple film about a few months in the life of a blind boy-but overcome your resistance and treat yourself to one of the finest films of the year..  A gem.  And one of the most beautiful looking films you'll ever see.  The cinematography is simply spectacular. The story deeply moving and unforgettable.  And yes you'll most likely have to read subtitles (though not that many) unless you speak Farsi.Although I'm aware the film teeters dangerously close to Spielberg-ian heartstring pulling manipulation, it's also powerful, uncompromising and a film that gets all of its details exactly right.We meet Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani) at the school for the blind in Tehran where he resides. We see the students leading each other around, learning how to read and write in Braille, and packing up to meet their parents as the school prepares to close for three months.  Mohammad's father is very late. All the other children have been picked up by their parents.  The teacher remains positive that the father will arrive to pick Mohammed up.  We aren't so sure.Mohammad gets up off the bench, and wanders off the path, over to a tree.  He kneels down and at first it appears he is going to dig a hole in the dirt.  But he continues to move the leaves around with his hands. We aren't sure what he is doing.  Then he finds the tiny bird that has fallen from it's nest.  We watch in amazement as he carefully picks the tiny bird up, and then proceeds to climb the tree and put the bird back into its nest.  Mohammed we realize is a very special, gifted and sensitive 8 year old boy who just happens to be blind.Director Majid Majidi finds a wonderful way to let us quickly stop pitying the blind child and come to admire and perhaps understand the character.  Several times throughout the film we hear noises, before we see what the source of the noise is.  We get close-ups of Mohammed's hand as he feels a creek bed for some stones, or plays with some wheat and begins quietly muttering some letters from the alphabet.  He reads with his fingers and memorizes his lessons anyway he can.  He has never stopped trying to learn, trying to less of a burden and embarrassment to his father.Mohammad's father (Hossein Mahjub) reluctantly picks up his son at the school.  We learn his wife has died and they will travel to the north where Mohammed's  two young sisters and Grandmother live.  Mohammed is loved and accepted as a whole person by everyone but his father.  His father hopes to get married and sees his son as a weight that drags him down.  He feels life had treated him unfairly by giving him a blind son to take care of and by taking his wife away from him.  He is trying to win the hand of a women in the village and has been working very hard to raise the dowry and present the gifts necessary to get her hand in marriage.  When asked he talks about his two daughters but does not mention his blind son.  Perhaps his blind son would be seen a negative omen by his future father-in-law and so he must deny his very existence.Mohammed is full of life and has a strong connection, even a spiritual connection to everything that surrounds him.  He has been told that he is a special person because God particularly loves the blind and since God is invisible and can only be felt, it will be the blind who will feel him first.  Mohammed the young boy wants desperately to believe that but as he comes to realize that his father views him as a burden, he begins to doubt the truth of what he has been told.The camera lovingly braces the lush country side of the North Country of Iran.  We see the beauty that Mohammed can only see and feel.  We get a sense of what it must be like for him to put his overly sensitive fingers into the creek, to feel the Caspian Sea on his feet, to have a butterfly tickle his skin, to hear the birds and animals around him.  To know his younger sister has gotten older by touching her face and declaring. .  &quot;My you have grown!&quot;  And while the camera takes the time to linger on certain shots it does not linger too long.  The film almost always remains positive, almost always shows us the good of things.Almost.While his father is almost deathly afraid of certain sounds, Mohammed remains curious and calm with everything that is around him.  He is full of life, wonder and love in contrast to being full of fear, anger and bitterness.Majidi has created a ninety minute work which is rich with visual and emotional textures that will stay with you long after the film is over.  Much of the film, because of its subject matter has a sadness to it.  But like Mohammed the film sees beauty and richness everywhere and reminds us  there is much we take for granted-like the beauty and compassion  a young blind boy easily `sees' and accepts.NOTE: The film's Farsi title actually translates to The Color of God but the film has been re-titled in English: The Color of Paradise.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

552848,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B00004VVO5,Godly Gadfly,"[8, 10]","Iranian filmmakers are always going to have a hard time competing with Hollywood in the West.  But with ""A Color of Paradise"", director Majid Majidi (acclaimed and best known for ""The Children of Heaven"", a story of a brother and sister who share the same pair of shoes) has produced a film that in content, themes and beauty makes a great deal of modern blockbusters look nasty and expensive.  In Arabic (with English subtitles), it's the story of eight-year old Mohammad, a blind boy who attends a school for the blind in Tehran.  When the school breaks for the summer months, Mohammad's father is the last to pick him up, even then only after trying to have the school keep the boy.  His reasons become obvious after he retreats to his home in the Iranian countryside: taking care of his son is a burden in his quest to win the dowry and the hand of a local woman in marriage, and his son is a threat to his own future well-being.  As Mohammad enjoys life in the picturesque countryside with his two sisters and grandmother, he is oblivious to his father's plans to get rid of him.The movie develops a sharp contrast between the boy and his father: despite the fact that he can see, his father is caught up in blind selfishness where he cares only about himself; Despite his blindness, Mohammad ""sees"" the beauty of life, and is full of wonder at the sounds of birds and the magnificence of creation.  As the blind boy reads the Braille alphabet in nature and reaches out to its helpless creatures, it becomes evident that the abandoned baby bird he rescues, as well as the trapped fish and overturned turtle we see are really metaphors of Mohammad's own helplessness before his father.  The boy's grandmother is a quiet figure, but she sees both her blind grandson's worth and her son's moral corruption.  But can anything save Mohammad's father from his own selfishness?  He's already lost his first wife, but now his selfishness threatens to make him lose his mother, his son, and even his future wife.  The story switches gears towards the conclusion with some tense drama and action scenes revolving around a broken bridge and a raging river.  The stunning ending features a moving closing scene that leaves open lots of questions and is sure to create lots of discussion among viewers.""Color of Paradise"" may lack the big budgets and spectacular effects available to Hollywood - and at times it shows - but on the whole this story has a gentle and poignant beauty that touches the heart.  There are many in Western society who have the eyes of Mohammad's father, yet share his inner blindness.

The acting and story are both really great, which surprised me because I usually don't like touchy movies with less action.The movie is about a handicapped but gifted young boy named Mohammed. Although he cannot see, he feels and listens his way around the places he goes. His father sees Mohammed's disability as more of a frustration coming in the way of his own happiness more than anything, and basically tries to get rid of him. While his father is in pursuit of material joys and a certain woman's hand in marriage, Mohammed is interested in the beauty of nature as well as the joys of learning, inside and outside the classroom.There was a point in the story when Mohammed makes a speech about his feelings and finding God, and that was probably one of the saddest movie moments I have ever seen in my life. I cried so much, I had to pause the DVD for a while to get myself together. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a sad, poignant movie. And it's a refreshing look at a country we mostly hear negatively about in the news these days. You don't have to be Persian or comprehend a word of Farsi to appreciate this movie. The English subtitles are adequate, and I believe there are other language subtitle options as well.The ending is slightly ambiguous, but I've found a lot of Farsi films to be that way.

Described as 'Stunningly beautiful. A gem."" by Stephen Holden of the New York Times. Winner of the BEST PICTURE at the 1999 Montreal Film Festival and other awards internationally, this is a story about an 8 year old blind boy and his relationship with his widowed father. It grabs your heart immediately as the boarding school for blind children in Tehran, where Mohammad attends, is ending for summer vacation. Mohammad is the only child left after all the other parents have picked up their children. He is sitting alone on a bench and hears a baby bird fall out of its nest and chirping on the ground. He also hears a cat nearby. He manages to shoo the cat away and find the baby bird and climb the tree and return it to its nest. Welcome to the world of the blind. His father finally arrives and wants to leave him there. We meet a poor, hard working man from a rural village who has lost his wife and is trying to raise his other two daughters and make a living as best he can. He also wants to remarry and considers Mohammad to be an obstacle to finding a wife. The rest is a wonderful human interest story. The scenery is outstanding. Iran is really a beautiful country in many areas. Many emotions come to the surface during the film. It is a film you can easily watch with children who are mature enough to understand the themes. It is worth watching just to better understand the handicap of being a blind child. If you've seen CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, you know what's in store. Rated PG for mature themes, there is no offensive language or material of any kind. YOU WILL BE DOING YOURSELF A FAVOR BY PUTTING THIS AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST.",5,WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF THE BLIND & THE COLOR OF PARADISE,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1768,"['producer', 'ACADEMY', 'AWARD', 'nominee', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'Majid', 'Majidi', 'sequel', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'OF', 'PARADISE', 'Described', ""'Stunningly"", 'beautiful', 'gem', 'Stephen', 'Holden', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Winner', 'BEST', 'PICTURE', '1999', 'Montreal', 'Film', 'Festival', 'other', 'awards', 'internationally', 'story', '8', 'year', 'old', 'blind', 'boy', 'relationship', 'widowed', 'father', 'heart', 'immediately', 'boarding', 'school', 'blind', 'children', 'Tehran', 'where', 'Mohammad', 'ending', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Mohammad', 'only', 'child', 'left', 'other', 'parents', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'children', 'sitting', 'alone', 'bench', 'baby', 'bird', 'fall', 'nest', 'chirping', 'ground', 'also', 'cat', 'nearby', 'shoo', 'cat', 'away', 'find', 'baby', 'bird', 'climb', 'tree', 'return', 'nest', 'Welcome', 'world', 'blind', 'father', 'finally', 'leave', 'there', 'meet', 'poor', 'hard', 'working', 'man', 'rural', 'village', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'trying', 'raise', 'other', 'two', 'daughters', 'make', 'living', 'can', 'also', 'remarry', 'considers', 'Mohammad', 'be', 'obstacle', 'finding', 'wife', 'rest', 'wonderful', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'scenery', 'outstanding', 'Iran', 'really', 'beautiful', 'country', 'many', 'areas', 'Many', 'emotions', 'come', 'surface', 'film', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'watch', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'understand', 'themes', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'better', 'understand', 'handicap', 'being', 'blind', 'child', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'know', 'what', 'store', 'Rated', 'PG', 'mature', 'themes', 'offensive', 'language', 'material', 'kind', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'BE', 'DOING', 'A', 'FAVOR', 'BY', 'PUTTING', 'THIS', 'AT', 'THE', 'TOP', 'OF', 'YOUR', 'LIST']",The Color of Paradise

The use of slow-motion. The acting...all the acting, which is not like Hollywood acting at all and in fact never feels like any kind of acting at all is superb. A culture produced this film. An Iranian culture. I know there is great repression in that country, but there is clearly something else afoot as well.  This film could be about ""evil,"" painted with a simple brush.

The beauty of the Iranian countryside, the lush colors and the heightened sound effects are indescribable. The irony of all that beauty? The main character is a blind boy. You feel the true depth of Mohammad's tragedy as he lives surrounded by paradise but unable to see it. Still, he is more connected to nature and the wonder of his remaining senses than the adults who surround him.Or, more to the point, than his father. With every furtive look at the boy, the father, Hashem (played chillingly by Hossein Mahjub), gives the gut-wrenching impression of a parent who wants to dispose of his own child. My belly was in continual knots of fear as I watched Hashem shunt this burden out of his life and then back in again, only to invite the ultimate disaster.My stomach didn't unknot for at least 30 minutes after the climax of the film. The climax was more frightening, to me, than the horror flicks people watch to scare themselves. It was so frightening because by that stage Mohammad had well and truly burrowed into my affections.The redemption scene at the end of the movie is the one thing that spoils this film. I gave THE COLOR OF PARADISE six stars for superior filmmaking but took back one star for the unsatisfying and melodramatic ending.Mohammad is played by Mohsen Ramezani with extraordinary depth.

He also has the sensitivities to his surroundings and subject matter of great directors, such as Truffaut and De Sica.Majidi and most Iranian directors have used amateur children in the lead role to excellent effect, and the world we see through the eyes of these children, is filmed with such care and understanding.Iranian cinema has gained international recognition, especially in Europe, taking several awards in Cannes and Venice, and it is such a great achievement for the art of cinema itself, proving yet again that it is one form that can bring cultures together in a sophisticated platform.The scenery in Color of Paradise is breathtaking, and will surprise many as i was, by how beautiful a country Iran is.The cinematography as well is top class, clearly evident in the last scene, very well filmed and edited.If you love cinema then you should add Color of Paradise to your collection, for it is a feast to your senses.",5,This  is Cinema!,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,1845,"['can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'enough', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'story', 'told', 'such', 'dedication', 'love..this', 'film', 'what', 'cinema', 'about.The', 'fact', 'film', 'Iran', 'should', 'be', 'example', 'how', 'universal', 'art', 'cinema', 'is.Majidi', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'nationality', 'making', 'masterpiece', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'September', 'yet', 'again', 'enjoyment', 'Color', 'Paradise', 'story', 'Mohamed', 'blind', 'boy', 'relationship', 'father', 'excellent', 'Hussain', 'Mahjoub', 'sisters', 'grandmother', 'nature.It', 'tragic', 'story', 'filmed', 'falling', 'trap', 'sentimentality.It', 'universal', 'story', 'little', 'Mohamed', 'can', 'be', 'blind', 'boy', 'country', 'world..this', 'why', 'Majidi', 'films', 'Iranian', 'setting', 'touch', 'viewer', 'culture', 'also', 'sensitivities', 'surroundings', 'subject', 'matter', 'great', 'directors', 'such', 'Truffaut', 'De', 'Sica.Majidi', 'most', 'Iranian', 'directors', 'have', 'used', 'amateur', 'children', 'lead', 'role', 'excellent', 'effect', 'world', 'see', 'eyes', 'children', 'filmed', 'such', 'care', 'understanding.Iranian', 'cinema', 'gained', 'international', 'recognition', 'especially', 'Europe', 'taking', 'several', 'awards', 'Cannes', 'Venice', 'such', 'great', 'achievement', 'art', 'cinema', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'form', 'can', 'bring', 'cultures', 'together', 'sophisticated', 'platform.The', 'scenery', 'Color', 'Paradise', 'breathtaking', 'will', 'surprise', 'many', 'i', 'was', 'how', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Iran', 'is.The', 'cinematography', 'well', 'top', 'class', 'clearly', 'evident', 'last', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'edited.If', 'love', 'cinema', 'then', 'should', 'add', 'Color', 'Paradise', 'collection', 'feast', 'senses']",The Color of Paradise

In its manner, it seems to reflect issues in Iran's culture (its faith-based adherence to patriarchy, for one), while treating them in what seems to be a gently elusive way, at least on the surface, while appealing at the same time to more universal and deeply felt values that cross national boundaries everywhere. The elusiveness may well result from the heavy-handed control of artistic expression in the Islamic Republic (see Shirin Ebadi, ""Iran Awakening"") but patience rewards the viewer with what is a thoughtful meditation on the struggle for dignity, personal safety, and a harmonious community life.In this film, Magidi portrays the plight of a blind boy whose misfortune it is to have a widowed father more selfishly concerned with winning a new wife than providing a loving home for his disabled son. The film is set in the lush, beautiful mountains north of Tehran and bordering the Caspian Sea. It celebrates village life and takes time to show us time-honored occupations - carpentry, making charcoal, and dying lambs wool - as well as the traditions of courtship, where marriages are arranged by the bride's family. The self-pitying father, with the power he wields in a patriarchal culture, eventually learns too late that all of his actions have created a tragedy that for the viewer is shocking and heartbreaking.The performances, especially by the blind boy who plays the son, are riveting. The photogrpahy cries out for a big screen, and the sound is richly enhanced to emphasize the boy's heightend sensitivity to birdsong.

We enter the world of a blind child in an incredibly intimate way, exploring his world of sound and touch and the isolation his blindness brings about.  Almost ironically, we're also treated to some stunning images of lush scenery and locations.  Absolutely mesmerising cinematography that even out-does the audiography.Characters and their lives are simple but very believable, and the performances from every one of the actors is spot on.Highest recommendations!",5,Stunning cinema,1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,592,"['Majid', 'Majidi', 'COLOR', 'OF', 'PARADISE', 'best', 'kind', 'cinema', 'Simple', 'concept', 'executed', 'incredible', 'skill', 'detail', 'enter', 'world', 'blind', 'child', 'incredibly', 'intimate', 'way', 'exploring', 'world', 'sound', 'touch', 'isolation', 'blindness', 'Almost', 'ironically', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'stunning', 'images', 'lush', 'scenery', 'locations', 'Absolutely', 'mesmerising', 'cinematography', 'even', 'out-does', 'audiography.Characters', 'lives', 'are', 'simple', 'very', 'believable', 'performances', 'one', 'actors', 'spot', 'on.Highest', 'recommendations']",The Color of Paradise

There he lived with his grandmother, his father and his two sisters. His father wanted to remarry and was worried by the fact that he had a blind son. He wanted to send Mohammed to a blind carpenter as a apprentice. But the kind grandmother rejected that. When one day his father took Mohammed away to the carpenter, his grandmother grieved and passed away soon. The fiancee's family rejected the marriage because they saw the death as an ominous sign for the marriage. When the father brought Mohammed back in a rainy day, Mohammed slipped into the flooding brook and flowed away. His father jumped into the brook and pursuit him. Eventually he found Mohammed's body and held it in deep sorrow.The movie is so beautifully shot. The cinematography is superb. A few scenes are breathtakingly stunning:1. When the grandmother knew that his son had taken his grandson away, she stood desolately in sadness. The snowwhite chicken feathers were whirling lightly aournd her and the movie turned into silence. Without a single word, the love of the grandmother to her grandson was brilliantly presented.2.When the grandmother passed away, the old lady was like a goddess as the camera closed to her serene face. The screen lightened up and very tender music raised after a while of complete silence. I could hardly believe she had passed away although I knew she actually had. Purely poetical!3. At the end of the movie, when Mohammed was flooded away, I was extremely sad and felt helpless. His father eventually found his body. He held the body and wept deeply. the camera lingered at the hand of the boy. The fingers moved, the screen was brightened up. At that moment I was totally mesmerized and felt no more sadness. The movie beautifully ended there, as I was left utterly speechless.One of the disgusting things about a lot of these days' movies is pretension and affectation--corny love must be accompanied by grandiose soundtrack and our feelings towards the movies are therefore misled and become untrue. In contrast, a lot of Iranian movies have very little musical score, touching the souls purely by acting and photography. The color of paradise, instead using bunch of music, use elements of true lives, such as the sound of woodpeckers, which makes the movie uncommonly refreshing.Believe me to watch the color of paradise, to experience the genuine soul-touching movie making!",5,Beautiful beautiful movie!,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,2503,"['movie', 'blind', 'child', 'Mohammed', 'came', 'village', 'reluctant', 'father', 'school', 'Tehran', 'lived', 'grandmother', 'father', 'two', 'sisters', 'father', 'wanted', 'remarry', 'was', 'worried', 'fact', 'had', 'blind', 'son', 'wanted', 'send', 'Mohammed', 'blind', 'carpenter', 'apprentice', 'kind', 'grandmother', 'rejected', 'When', 'one', 'day', 'father', 'took', 'Mohammed', 'away', 'carpenter', 'grandmother', 'grieved', 'passed', 'away', 'soon', 'fiancee', 'family', 'rejected', 'marriage', 'saw', 'death', 'ominous', 'sign', 'marriage', 'When', 'father', 'brought', 'Mohammed', 'back', 'rainy', 'day', 'Mohammed', 'slipped', 'flooding', 'brook', 'flowed', 'away', 'father', 'jumped', 'brook', 'pursuit', 'Eventually', 'found', 'Mohammed', 'body', 'held', 'deep', 'sorrow.The', 'movie', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'breathtakingly', 'stunning:1', 'When', 'grandmother', 'knew', 'son', 'had', 'taken', 'grandson', 'away', 'stood', 'desolately', 'sadness', 'snowwhite', 'chicken', 'feathers', 'were', 'whirling', 'lightly', 'movie', 'turned', 'silence', 'single', 'word', 'love', 'grandmother', 'grandson', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'grandmother', 'passed', 'away', 'old', 'lady', 'was', 'goddess', 'camera', 'closed', 'serene', 'face', 'screen', 'lightened', 'up', 'very', 'tender', 'music', 'raised', 'while', 'complete', 'silence', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'knew', 'actually', 'had', 'Purely', 'poetical', '3', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Mohammed', 'was', 'flooded', 'away', 'was', 'extremely', 'sad', 'felt', 'helpless', 'father', 'eventually', 'found', 'body', 'held', 'body', 'wept', 'deeply', 'camera', 'lingered', 'hand', 'boy', 'fingers', 'moved', 'screen', 'was', 'brightened', 'up', 'moment', 'was', 'totally', 'mesmerized', 'felt', 'more', 'sadness', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'ended', 'there', 'was', 'left', 'utterly', 'speechless.One', 'disgusting', 'things', 'lot', 'days', 'movies', 'pretension', 'affectation', 'corny', 'love', 'must', 'be', 'accompanied', 'grandiose', 'soundtrack', 'feelings', 'movies', 'are', 'therefore', 'misled', 'become', 'untrue', 'contrast', 'lot', 'Iranian', 'movies', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'musical', 'score', 'touching', 'souls', 'purely', 'acting', 'photography', 'color', 'paradise', 'instead', 'using', 'bunch', 'music', 'use', 'elements', 'true', 'lives', 'such', 'sound', 'woodpeckers', 'movie', 'uncommonly', 'refreshing.Believe', 'watch', 'color', 'paradise', 'experience', 'genuine', 'soul-touching', 'movie', 'making']",The Color of Paradise
