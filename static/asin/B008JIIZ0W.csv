1568631,A10TTJD5BNJZW6,B008JIIZ0W,"Crazy Animated ""The Collector""","[19, 20]","This season was the most enjoyable for me, especially the ending. It might not have the same amount of laughs as the earlier seasons have had, but the new animation and action scenes coupled with the emotional journeys of the characters make this a more well-rounded story with a bigger pay-off.The previous season didn't sit well with me primarily because the main characters whom we have come to love over the years, were not funny for the most part. *MINOR SPOILER* They were just parodies of themselves inside the Epsilon unit, but still their comedy was way off. However, season 9's action taking place in the past was what really made the story interesting, and it is that same action that carries forward into season 10. Thankfully, the present day plot has resumed being funny as well.Another great return for the season is the music of Trocadero. They were the ones who originally made the music for Red Vs Blue but recently had been replaced with Jeff Williams and Lamar Hall's heavy rock and rap. Williams and Hall are still in this season and while their music works well in the scenes it's showcased in, the more emotional and character driven scenes really benefited by the return of Nico Audy-Rowland's Trocadero.The ending to this season is amazing! Not only will it probably have you choked up a little if not outright crying, it essentially takes all the story from all past seasons and makes sense of them. Not necessarily stating how previous events make sense, but allowing the audience to work out the mystery between them. There are still plenty of things throughout the series that don't quite add up, but RoosterTeeth does a good job poking fun at that. Also after the credits are a few fun loose ends being tied up as well.I really enjoyed seeing a return to form, as well as the evolution of new storytelling techniques in this season, and hope to see more great stuff from RoosterTeeth in the future! Season 11 is bound to be very interesting!",5,The greatest season as of yet,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1971,"['season', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'ending', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'amount', 'laughs', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'have', 'had', 'new', 'animation', 'action', 'scenes', 'coupled', 'emotional', 'journeys', 'characters', 'make', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'story', 'bigger', 'pay-off.The', 'previous', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'primarily', 'main', 'characters', 'whom', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'most', 'part', 'SPOILER*', 'were', 'just', 'parodies', 'Epsilon', 'unit', 'still', 'comedy', 'was', 'way', 'However', 'season', '9', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'past', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'story', 'interesting', 'same', 'action', 'forward', 'season', '10', 'Thankfully', 'present', 'day', 'plot', 'resumed', 'being', 'funny', 'well.Another', 'great', 'return', 'season', 'music', 'Trocadero', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'originally', 'made', 'music', 'Red', 'Vs', 'Blue', 'recently', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'Jeff', 'Williams', 'Lamar', 'Hall', 'heavy', 'rock', 'rap', 'Williams', 'Hall', 'are', 'still', 'season', 'music', 'well', 'scenes', 'showcased', 'more', 'emotional', 'character', 'driven', 'scenes', 'really', 'benefited', 'return', 'Nico', 'Audy-Rowland', 'Trocadero.The', 'ending', 'season', 'amazing', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'choked', 'up', 'little', 'not', 'outright', 'crying', 'essentially', 'story', 'past', 'seasons', 'sense', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'stating', 'how', 'previous', 'events', 'make', 'sense', 'allowing', 'audience', 'work', 'out', 'mystery', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'things', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'RoosterTeeth', 'good', 'job', 'poking', 'fun', 'Also', 'credits', 'are', 'few', 'fun', 'loose', 'ends', 'being', 'tied', 'up', 'well.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'return', 'form', 'as', 'well', 'evolution', 'new', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'season', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'great', 'stuff', 'RoosterTeeth', 'future', 'Season', '11', 'bound', 'be', 'very', 'interesting']",N/A
