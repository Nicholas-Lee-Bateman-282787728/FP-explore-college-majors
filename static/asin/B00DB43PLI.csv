1654540,A2WCNYAF5HR0PB,B00DB43PLI,a reader,"[32, 38]","I have a degree in painting, so it was interesting to see this film; the art end of why someone paints, finds models, lives as cheaply as possible, etc., was true to life.  A.J.'s studio looked realistic, and the way he worked was true to life.  Perhaps people were disappointed with the fact that AJ horned in on Gilbert's budding romance.  This plot reminded me a LOT of Far From the Madding Crowd in which the female character, Bathsheba Everdene, falls for Frank, a man in a fancy uniform, marries him, and lives to regret it BIG TIME, while the steadfast shepherd, Gabriel Oak, who proposed to her early in the film, and whom she spurned as not good enough for her, watches the marriage of Bathsheba and Frank fall apart.  Gabriel eventually gets the girl, but in this film, the girl kills herself.  I think Dan made the film because he knew the author of the book.  And since it was a true story, unless they wanted to change the plot to create a happier ending, this is the plot they were stuck with.  There was no real way to make it anything but a character study of a painter who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, who doesn't really know how to love anyone or anything other than himself, and of a rather faithless, depressed girl who falls for him and marries him on a whim.  This also reminds me of Catherine in Wuthering Heights, spurning Heathcliff and marrying someone else, while Heathcliff self-destructs.  As to the nudity, painters paint nudes.  I would prefer to see a few nude bodies than gratuitous car crashes, murders, throat slittings, killings and destructive explosions.

Throughout the movie, the POV changes for no reason, the characters change for no reason and the dark scenes are dark enough I thought my screen had powered off.  It's pretty, the costumes are lovely, the horses are handsome, and the environments are top notch.  That said. It takes more than pretty for me to enjoy a movie (though it goes a long, long way).Slight Spoilers inferred ahead:  While I am sure fans of Downton Abbey will wander by for a view of Dan Stevens in early 1900s garb again (and he does look great in it) his talents are wasted.  Yes he does some attractive pining and kissing, but there is little that isn't found in DA (I think they may have even re-used his hat and some hunting suits).  Just go re-watch that, unless you are terribly bored. Then, don't say I didn't warn you. Dominic Cooper plays an attractive rake who likes to prove his genius through the recital of Poe and Longfellow from memory.  I'm not really captured by his appeal, which is problematic to enjoying the movie I think, but if you like him, perhaps this would be enjoyable? Emily Browning is the &#34;moody&#34; (lots of mood, only about half of which is related to anything) and lovely lead and dresses well in white.

As a fan of British literature and film, I thought this would be the perfect film for a quiet Sunday by myself.  The British perfected the story of the tumultuous &#34;love triangle&#34; long before Twilight came around.  Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, every Austen book: they all have a beautiful and &#34;rebellious&#34; type female at the center of their stories with a man who seems perfect for her and a &#34;misunderstood&#34; brute who ends up being the one who really &#34;understands&#34; her. So in essence, this film could have been really good.  However -Spoiler Alert:I think all the actors / actresses in the film are talented in their own right, but they just lacked any chemistry with one another.  The setting is amazing - an artist colony in Cornwall overlooking the wild ocean.  A pub where all these artists get together and recite poetry to one another and drink and sing - Um, sort of my idea of heaven as a literature nerd.  But its the characters that kept killing this story.  The &#34;brutish&#34; artist played by Dominic Cooper is really a jerk with no redeeming qualities although everyone keeps referring to him as a genius just because he can recite poetry and sort of paint.  He doesn't seem to have any real feelings for Emily Browning's character although at first you think there might be some kind of &#34;spark&#34; between them.  However, they act more neighbors who barely know one another throughout the entire movie.  She ends up marrying him even though she seems to hate him and I kept thinking, Why? Just because you told him you would marry him, doesn't mean you have to.  I mean, she is supposed to be this forward-thinking educated &#34;bohemian&#34; artist.  Her father hates him, so why go through with it if you hate him too? I think the premise of the story called for them to have a love/hate relationship - but there is absolutely no sexual or romantic chemistry between them AT ALL.And Dan Stevens was good at playing the nice, sympathetic friend to Emily Browning's character, however, there is no chemistry between he and her either.  They are more like brother and sister. The description of the film says this is a &#34;tumultuous&#34; love triangle???? Huh.  I have seen more romantic heat in a cereal commercial.

Munnings was famous for his paintings of horses.  Munnings falls in love with a new young painter Florence Carter-Wood played by Emily Browning.

There were a few too many shots of his longing gaze or his wounded one, which were virtually identical.The really meaty role here went to Emily Browning as Florence.  She is a flirting enigma when she first appears in Cornwall among the artists but as her relationships with the two friends becomes more complex and to her, insoluble, she becomes sad, brooding and desperate.  Unlike Mr Steven's performance, Ms Browning manages to convey complicated emotions.In the end, I don't think this was a really good movie, but it is an interesting and little known story about two men who were well known in the first half of the 20th century art scene in England.

However, don't expect much when it comes to the story, except that Dan comes across pretty much the same as Matthew Crawley.Where do I begin? Hum, well, it's a period movie, apparently about a factual event.  Dominic Cooper plays A. J. Munnings, a talented artist who went onto to be a famous English painter.  Set on the Cornwall coast in England, it's a story of a group of artists who do nothing but paint.  Dan Stevens, who plays Gilbert Evans, is not an artist, but a friend of A.J. and in the military.The story is a strange and nonsensical  love triangle.  Enter Florence Carter Wood, another young painter. She arrives in Cornwall to be with her brother and meets both A.J. and Gilbert.  Gilbert quickly falls in love with her, but A.J. wins the spoils instead. However, the entire affair is nonsensical.  Florence, who comes across as a pretty, young aristocratic woman, finds A.J. fascinating because of his talent.  However, he has a dark side. Even though it comes out before the wedding, she for some odd reason proceeds with the marriage as if she is helpless to do otherwise.Of course, her decision reaps an unhappy life, while Gilbert broods over his loss of his true love.  Since I don't want to give the &#34;spoils&#34; away on this plot, I'll keep my remaining comments minimal.  The location on the Cornwall coast has spectacular scenery. There are a few unnecessary scenes of total frontal female nudity, which added absolutely no value to the story whatsoever.Unfortunately, I cannot come away with anything lasting about this movie.  Though well acted, the story itself turned out to be a melodramatic affair that made no sense to me whatsoever.",2,Strange and Nonsensical,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1802,"['are', 'still', 'mourning', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'dying', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'here', 'picture', 'blond-haired', 'dreamy', 'eyed', 'Englishman', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'when', 'story', 'Dan', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'Matthew', 'Crawley.Where', 'do', 'begin', 'Hum', 'well', 'period', 'movie', 'apparently', 'factual', 'event', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'A.', 'J.', 'Munnings', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'went', 'be', 'famous', 'English', 'painter', 'Set', 'Cornwall', 'coast', 'England', 'story', 'group', 'artists', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'paint', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'who', 'Gilbert', 'Evans', 'not', 'artist', 'friend', 'A.J', 'military.The', 'story', 'strange', 'nonsensical', 'love', 'triangle', 'Enter', 'Florence', 'Carter', 'Wood', 'young', 'painter', 'Cornwall', 'be', 'brother', 'meets', 'A.J', 'Gilbert', 'Gilbert', 'quickly', 'love', 'A.J', 'spoils', 'instead', 'However', 'entire', 'affair', 'nonsensical', 'Florence', 'who', 'across', 'pretty', 'young', 'aristocratic', 'woman', 'A.J', 'fascinating', 'talent', 'However', 'dark', 'side', 'Even', 'out', 'wedding', 'odd', 'reason', 'proceeds', 'marriage', 'helpless', 'do', 'otherwise.Of', 'course', 'decision', 'unhappy', 'life', 'Gilbert', 'broods', 'loss', 'true', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', '34', 'spoils', '34', 'away', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'remaining', 'comments', 'minimal', 'location', 'Cornwall', 'coast', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'are', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'total', 'frontal', 'female', 'nudity', 'added', 'absolutely', 'value', 'story', 'whatsoever.Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'anything', 'lasting', 'movie', 'Though', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'affair', 'made', 'sense', 'whatsoever']",Summer in February
