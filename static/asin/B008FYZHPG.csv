The rating for the double DVD is predominantly for it. The 2nd movie &#34;Girl Bombs&#34; had a good idea plot wise, but I think it was too disorganised. It has another lovely woman actress (her name escapes me but she's Italian) who does a great job; given the lines that she has.

Again it stars Price and Fabian( had a following in the 60s). What makes this a treat to have is the fact that the great director Mario Bava directed it!

1552057,A1UIOMPBKE4FZW,B008FYZHPG,Randy Smith,"[7, 9]","I  love ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine.""  It has always  been one of my favoite comedies.  It's easy to see that much of Austin Powers  was based on this film. The whole FemBot thing was taken from this.  All of the actors, Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman are fantastic in this.  This film is a great satire on films like 007 and other spy films of the era.  The title sequence and title song is well worth the price alone.  Now.  ""Dr, Goldfoot and the girl bombs.""  Well  I have never seen it,  I dont think it had ever been released.  When I saw  this DVD in the $5 bin at Walmart I knew I had to get it, though I already have ""Bikini.""  To have both I thought was a great deal. I just watched ""Bomb"" last night.  I fell asleep.  It was dreadful.  As much as I love Mario Bava's horror films, he is not good with comedy.  The films is all over the place.  The plot?  Dr. Goldfoot is trying to kill all the men in NATO so he can stop some war games.  He sends out his girl bombs.  When they kiss the men, they explode.  Talk about your suicide bombers.  Of course the girls are robots. Oh and  Goldfoot  wants to drop a nuke on Russia and start a nuclear war.  Why?  I guess he thinks that will help him rule the world.  There is little or no background for the main charecter played by Fabian.  Only that he is a spy.  Dr. Goldfoot does not have his original henchman in this one.  He has some girl as his partner  who is not much of an actress. Hername in the film is ""Hardjob.""  I guess it's suppose to be a take off on ""Oddjob"" from ""Goldfinger."" Her whole role in the film is to have her clothes ripped off.  And who is Franco snd Ciccio?  2 Itialian comedians? They are not funny at all.  And Price often turns to the camera and explains what is happeneing on screen.  Well have a decent screenplay and you'd not need this nonsense.  It is obovious that the film makers were way over  their heads and had no clue where the film was going.  So if you find this in the cheap bin at Walmart, yes get it.

Unfortunately, for all practical purposes, Price is all these movie have going for them and even he couldn't bring them up to better than marginal acceptability.  On the other hand, they have to judged by when they were made.  Today, even with Price in them, they wouldn't deserve a single star.  With the exception of Price the acting was poor, the plotting worse, the editing sad, and the special effects a joke.  On the up side, they were hardly intended to be taken seriously.  As a satire on the secret agent movies being made at the time, pointing out the more subtle idiocies of those movies, and taking shots at beach party movies and other such nonsense at the same time, they do have some redeeming qualities.  The poor production qualities and acting were far from unusual at the time these were being made, and others no better then these are considered decent movies for the era.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[22, 23]","This double-bill of both AIP's Dr. Goldfoot series, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" and the DVD premiere in Reg. 1 of ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", it's somewhat controversial sequel is a pleasant way to get both films in one's collection.  AIP got Vincent Price to appear in both films, ""Bikini Machine"" becoming the first production by AIP that had a million dollar budget.  Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman and Susan Hart also star and directed by veteran Norman Taurog (considered ""the star's director"" having directed 10 Elvis vehicles in his career, and which included an Oscar win for directing Jackie Cooper in ""Skippy"" in 1931 among many others).  Many of the successful plot mechanics of ""Bikini Machine"" were recruited to be included in the sequel ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", but what happened was the producers decided to take advantage of tax write-off by having the production foreign made and it was considered a coup that famed horror director Mario Bava agreed to direct what would become his only comedy.  Besides Price, ""Girl Bombs"" included Fabian in the cast and Laura Antonelli (who would later hit it big in Italian movies) and the blundering Italian comedy team of Franco and Ciccio.  A lot of ""Girl Bombs"" fails, but it is not entirely as bad as critics of the film generally agree.  I think some of the Goldfoot plot mechanics, the obligatory chases, in ""Bikini Machine"" mostly with go carts, but Bava was terribly inventive to parodying itself in ""Girl Bombs"" with everything, even a big balloon.  A lot went wrong with the production of ""Girl Bombs"" which included their reportedly losing the soundtrack which had to be re-dubbed with the actors doing a lot of lip reading as the script went through many changes.  I still like ""Girl Bombs"" anyway and this is a good way to get a good copy of both films as it well presented thanks to TGG Direct.  And, too, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" was not exactly without fault as the prototype for success.
