753837,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00009KU8L,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Scourge of Worlds / B00009KU8LI've always been a fan of ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure"" style novels, and sometimes it seems a bit of a waste of potential that we don't have more movies operating under the same kind of concept. I mean, considering how often I yell helpful suggestions to the people on the TV screen, it seems a shame that more movies don't offer the ability for the viewer to control the outcome of the story. Of course, you could say that's what video games are for, especially in the wake of games with epic story lines and beautiful cinematics, a laFinal Fantasy X. All of which makes ""Scourge of Worlds"" a bit tricky to classify. Is it a movie that looks and feels like a video game, or is it a video game composed entirely of cutscenes?Because I wasn't sure what to expect and had braced myself for the worst, I was actually surprised at how relatively good ""Scourge"" is. The graphics are a little archaic at this point - no worse than the graphics of, say,MorrowindorEverquest I, but not as sharp and well-defined as, say,Guild Wars. The pathing is surprisingly well-paced - the choices are separated by about 10 minutes of screen time, meaning that the viewer isn't swamped with too many choices, nor bored with not enough.Probably the biggest failing of ""Scourge"" is the characterization of the players. I almost would have preferred to have the words ""Lawful Good"" flash under the elven mage a few times, rather than have her keep repeating stilted dialogue about what the ""right"" thing to do is. Similarly, the thief character manages to squeeze in three or four references to ""getting paid"" in the first five minutes or so - it just feels repetitive and sloppy, like a quick and dirty attempt at characterization before the action. Which is fine, but since this is a D&D; game/movie, I wish they'd just cut the cheesy characterization and flashed up a character sheet.I'm being unfair, perhaps, to expect good dialogue and characterization out of this. But with the other video game elements stripped away, there's not much else here to hold the viewer besides the novelty. Hardcore gamers will enjoy going through this a few times for the novelty of it all, and I think children would enjoy the ""choose your path"" functionality quite a bit, but there's not a whole lot here to keep you coming back for more after the first few times. I recommend trying it out, just because it's so unusual and fun, and appreciating the spirit behind the effort and try not to look too closely at the blemishes.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Intriguing Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Concept,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2532,"['Scourge', 'Worlds', '/', 'B00009KU8LI', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure', 'style', 'novels', 'bit', 'waste', 'potential', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'movies', 'operating', 'same', 'kind', 'concept', 'mean', 'considering', 'how', 'often', 'yell', 'helpful', 'suggestions', 'people', 'TV', 'screen', 'shame', 'more', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'ability', 'viewer', 'control', 'outcome', 'story', 'course', 'could', 'say', 'what', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'especially', 'wake', 'games', 'epic', 'story', 'lines', 'beautiful', 'cinematics', 'laFinal', 'Fantasy', 'X', 'All', 'Scourge', 'Worlds', 'bit', 'tricky', 'classify', 'movie', 'feels', 'video', 'game', 'video', 'game', 'composed', 'entirely', 'cutscenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'had', 'braced', 'worst', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'relatively', 'good', 'Scourge', 'graphics', 'are', 'little', 'archaic', 'point', 'worse', 'graphics', 'say', 'MorrowindorEverquest', 'not', 'sharp', 'well-defined', 'say', 'Guild', 'Wars', 'pathing', 'surprisingly', 'well-paced', 'choices', 'are', 'separated', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'meaning', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'swamped', 'too', 'many', 'choices', 'bored', 'not', 'enough.Probably', 'biggest', 'failing', 'Scourge', 'characterization', 'players', 'almost', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'words', 'Lawful', 'Good', 'flash', 'elven', 'mage', 'few', 'times', 'rather', 'have', 'keep', 'repeating', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'what', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Similarly', 'thief', 'character', 'squeeze', 'three', 'four', 'references', 'getting', 'paid', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'just', 'feels', 'repetitive', 'sloppy', 'quick', 'dirty', 'attempt', 'characterization', 'action', 'Which', 'fine', 'D', 'D', 'game/movie', 'wish', ""'d"", 'just', 'cut', 'cheesy', 'characterization', 'flashed', 'up', 'character', 'sheet.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'unfair', 'perhaps', 'expect', 'good', 'dialogue', 'characterization', 'other', 'video', 'game', 'elements', 'stripped', 'away', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'here', 'hold', 'viewer', 'novelty', 'Hardcore', 'gamers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'going', 'few', 'times', 'novelty', 'think', 'children', 'would', 'enjoy', 'choose', 'path', 'functionality', 'quite', 'bit', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'recommend', 'trying', 'out', 'just', 'so', 'unusual', 'fun', 'appreciating', 'spirit', 'effort', 'try', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'closely', 'blemishes.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Scourge of Worlds - A Dungeons & Dragons Adventure

You have to really try to not hate them: D&D; the Movie, Wrath of the Dragon God, Dragonlance. They're all really pretty awful.This one though, is actually really good. I mean actually good, good. The name and concept are not only interesting and cool, but tie into the official lore of the Greyhawk campaign setting, involving relics of the war between the Baklunish and Suel civilizations, a cleric of Pholtus, and the signature characters who you never really get to see more than art from in the books. They do a good job fleshing them out, and you really get to enjoy their relationships. Lidda, particularly, is awesome.The look of the movie is interesting. You can tell they made it under a tight budget--but rather than go small they stretched their resources to really do some bold things. The characters are stiff and some of the faces are pretty primative, but there's an edgy look to the design that I really like, full of cracked flats jutting through with bony spikes and weird architecture that looks like the bones of some great dead demon.The look of the animation is reminicent of the cinematics from the original Fallout game, or from Planescape Torment, with the same kind of quirky style that transends the primative puppet-like look.And unlike what I'd expected from a choose-your-own-adventure DVD, the choices matter. You can play the movie through several times and discover a really fun new nugget of information you hadn't seen before, or a few new exchanges between characters, or a totally new fight scene.

Later, I became engrossed in the story, and these things became somewhat less noticible.My only disatisfaction that I had with this DVD, was that there really doesn't appear to be a way to solve the 'dvd' without violence.
