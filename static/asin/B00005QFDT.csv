675149,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00005QFDT,Ace-of-Stars,"[13, 16]","*If you could take the love-chasing antics of 'Lum & Ataru,' plant them solidly in the earthly realm, and smack an ''NC-17'' MPAA rating onto it, what you would end up with is ''Sakura Diaries'' (Japanese title: ''Sakura Tsuushin'').First published as a 'manga' ('comic book') series, ''Sakura Tsuushin'' (''The Cherry Blossom Reports'') follows a bizarre ''love triangle'' somewhat reminiscent of Takahashi Rumiko's ''Urusei Yatsura'' (''[Those Annoying] Planet Uru Aliens'').''Inaba Touma'' is the ''Diaries'' version of the ''Moroboshi Ataru'' character. Less the self-proclaimed idiot and imbecile he berates himself for being, and more of a confused & misguided underachiever, Touma is obsessed with trying to pass college entrance exams in order to break away from his ''country hick'' image and to avoid returning home to operate his family's hot springs inn. Add to the mix Touma's sexual insecurities over still being a virgin, along with the constant tension and frustration he experiences in his attempt to ''preserve himself'' for the ''right girl'' (very unlike Takahashi's Ataru), and one can easily begin to empathize with Touma and his personal struggles.Touma's already complicated world becomes even further faceted with the introduction of the ''Lum'' character, ''Kasuga Urara,'' who ''first'' appears to him in his Tokyo hotel room (uninvited) as a ''schoolgirl call girl'' who apparently has some inside information on her hesitant and reluctant new ''client.'' We later learn that Urara is, in reality, Touma's ''itoko'' (''cousin'') who has had a long-standing ''lover's crush'' on him since meeting him for the first-- and only --time some six years prior, and she is devastated that he no longer recognizes her, despite the ''pact'' they made with each other way back then.The ''lover's triangle'' element is added rather unexpectedly when Touma becomes obsessed with the ''Shinobu'' character-- a tall shapely redhead named ''Yotsuba Mieko'' (some promotional materials incorrectly identify her as ''Meiko'') --whom he meets on the campus of the prestigious Keio University, where they are both taking entrance exams (even though Touma fully realizes that he is terribly under-qualified for acceptance into such a fine institution).Mieko is similar to Shinobu only in the sense that Touma frantically tries to win her approval and focuses his attentions mainly on her (as Ataru does with Shinobu, despite his lecherousness) while trying to avoid Urara and resist her affectionate advances (as Ataru does with Lum). But Mieko is really more of an ''Anti-Shinobu'' in the fact that, unlike Shinobu's long-suffering devotion to her lout of a ''boyfriend,'' Mieko's feelings toward Touma are cautious and conflicting -- sometimes bordering on ''romantic,'' but somewhat distant and devoid of any genuine emotional investment. Yet, there's always that small glimmer of hope in Touma that he may still have a shot at being the recipient of Mieko's affections. There's just ONE major drawback: Mieko has made it patently clear that as a newly accepted student at Keio University she would only consider dating boys who were also fellow Keio students -- which Touma (having miserably failed ALL tests on his entrance exam) is NOT!And so begins the deception: In between taking courses at ''cram school'' with ''career underachievers'' for classmates and trying to make sense of his cousin's sexually charged advances towards him (apparently considered somewhat less taboo in Japan than in Western cultures), Touma keeps up the pretense that he is actually a ''keizai'' (''economics'') major at Keio. And caught in the middle of this muddle is poor Urara, who is awkwardly-- and painfully --exposing herself to the sometimes harsh truths of male sexuality, of which she obviously understands so little (sometimes with unfortunate and frightening consequences), while persistently trying to win Touma's heart as her own conflict rages within over whether she should let her jealousies put a wedge between her ''Tonma-chan'' and ''that Keio girl,'' or if she should guard his precious secret and not interfere, even if it should mean ''losing'' the man she loves so dearly to another.It just so happens, however, that Touma is not the only one in this trio of young romantics who is carrying on a deception: Each of his two love interests also have something to hide -- the revelation of which having a major impact on Touma's outlook, causing him to do some serious re-evaluating of his priorities.Sexual references and images are far from being just ''hinted at'': they are expressed openly and directly, though not explicitly or graphically (which could be described as ''hentai-light''). Although there is a very disturbing [quote] attempted rape scene [unquote] at the end of Chapter 5, Touma's confrontation with Urara's best friend, ''Kohmi,'' near the end of Chapter 6 gives us a clearer picture and deeper understanding of what transpired and what contributing factors were involved -- a remarkable revelation which does much to show both parties as victims of their own misunderstanding and ignorance, while stirring up in our minds such colorful images as ''clueless airhead'' (before the fact) and ''insensitive jerk'' (after the fact) to describe each party involved.Some very lighthearted and comedic touches are riddled throughout. Much of the humor is sexual in nature: Among such memorable scene are when Touma finds Urara's panty in the laundry hamper while she's in the shower and he wonders to himself if the dainty undergarment is ''still warm'' ...or Touma's ''back scrubbing'' fantasy, which had me laughing hysterically. (Touma's fantasies often pop up unexpectedly and can be a bit confusing at times.)The conclusion to this 12-episode series (complete on two disks in this ''Collector's Edition'' set) could not have been more perfect -- signing off with just enough ambiguity that it leaves us, the viewer, either wondering how it's ''supposed'' to end or, if we dare, imagining our own ''ending'' ...or ''continuation,'' as the case may be.(In English subtitle format, the episodes alternate between English translations of the opening and closing themes and ''Roumaji'' transliterations.)If you decide to sit down with ''Sakura Diaries,'' be prepared for something very DIFFERENT ... and very ADDICTING!*",4,''Urusei Yatsura'' for ''mature audiences'',1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,6349,"['*If',
