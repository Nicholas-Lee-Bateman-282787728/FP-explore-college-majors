His plans to sled from one end of the frozen continent to the other are again abandoned when crew and ship Endeavor become impossibly trapped in floe ice.After camping beside their stranded vessel and watching it sink, the contingent must drag three small boats a great distance in dreadful weather, then row 800 miles to Elephant Island. Shackleton and a select few navigate one of these to South Georgia while the others hunker down.A fascinating story of survival under the harshest of conditions is brought to life by an excellent cast.

Kenneth Branagh IS Ernest Shackleton!  And supporting cast is excellent as well.  Fascinating story of survival---I saw the National Geographic exhibition on the photographs and films (pre-World War I technology) so I was pleased that the movie focused on the relationship between Shackleton and his photographer.  And a big plus is that I saw parts of the movie that were not shown on American TV---and it really added to my overall enjoyment of the series.,5,Great series,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,569,"['saw', 'A', 'E', 'when', 'premiered', 'too', 'bad', 'A', 'E', 'gone', 'downhill', 'non-art', 'reality', 'shows', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'IS', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Fascinating', 'story', 'survival', 'saw', 'National', 'Geographic', 'exhibition', 'photographs', 'films', 'pre-World', 'War', 'technology', 'was', 'pleased', 'movie', 'focused', 'relationship', 'Shackleton', 'photographer', 'big', 'plus', 'saw', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'American', 'TV', '-and', 'really', 'added', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'series']",N/A

1548386,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B0088EDNMM,Thomas E. Davis,"[2, 2]","Kenneth Branagh brings his customary swagger to this portrayal of the British adventurer Ernest Shackleton, together with a first-class supporting cast. Perfectly arrayed in Edwardian period costumes and sets, the story starts with the Antarctic veteran and lecturer learning that Roald Amundson has become the first person to reach the South Pole. He decides to one-up the Norwegian with the first trans-Antarctic expedition. The film follows Shackleton as he raises money, selects a crew, and carries on a love affair that his wife discovers. But he soon leaves both wife and paramour for his irresistable compulsion to conquer the unknown.Shackleton and his men travel to Argentina and thence to Antarctica via the aptly-named sailing ship Endurance. It becomes trapped in the ice of the Weddell Sea for nearly a year before it is crushed. The men recover what they can before the ship goes down, then camp on the drifting floes for months while killing their dogs for food. They finally set off on foot, pulling lifeboats and supplies through ghastly weather until the ice starts to break up. After five days at sea, they reach Elephant Island, but it is far from shipping lanes. The groups' chances of discovery or rescue are extremely slim.Their leader determines that they must save themselves by attempting an incredibly risky 800-mile open-sea crossing to South Georgia Island. After two weeks of fierce storms, they make the island by dint of exceptional navigation, but even then, their survival depends on trudging across its mountains to find a whaling station. These scenes are interwoven with scenes at home in Britain, where friends and family wait anxiously and where rescue missions are proposed but never undertaken, as the ongoing carnage of World War I makes the fate of 28 men seem small by comparison.Shackleton himself comes across as something of a glib promoter, an ambitious man drawn by fame and glory. Yet when his back is to the wall, he proves that he is not just a great explorer but also a great judge of character and an indomitable leader of men. His charisma and motivational abilities literally save his expedition-mates, allowing them to come home after three incredible years, long after most Britons have given them up for dead, with nary a life lost (though three men died in a separate expedition that left supply depots for Shackleton).The script draws much of its dialog and detail from the diaries and letters of crewmen, who survived a harrowing journey through an amazing combination of strength, courage, resourcefulness, and sheer determination. The production values are superb, worthy of a theatrical feature film, and the cinematography, based on the documentary pictures and films of the expedition's photographer, is breathtaking. The outdoor scenes were shot in Greenland using a full reconstruction of The Endurance. You truly feel the bitter cold and exhaustion of the men, and their survival seems nothing short of a miracle.I recommend purchasing the three-DVD Collector's Edition over the two-disc set, which contains only the 206-minute Emmy-winning made-for-television miniseries, without so much as a commentary or a subtitle. The third disc offers three worthwhile documentaries. The first is a 49-minute presentation entitled ""Breaking the Ice: The Making of Shackleton,"" the second a 43-minute biography called ""Ernest Shackleton: Looking South,"" and the third a 92-minute history special: ""Antarctica: A Frozen History.""
