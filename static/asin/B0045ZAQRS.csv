Now, my guess is the authors try to look smart and they use the title in imaginative way. Ok. Lets see my favored movies about Tokyo:Enter the void--the title is  movie; Sleepless city--the title is movie;The glamorous life of ....--title is movie.Hmm.The movie start from talking about somebody's girlfriend commiting suicide and we never see anything about it; her rich father gets mad and hires other chick to kill boyfriend // and if father is poor what he suppose to do?  //. While its not unusual for young chicks in Japan to kill themself  its highly unusual for young chick be for hire to kill anybody. The point is normal people have motivation to do something so I guess normality is not the point for this movie.Well, pointless movie, no nudity whatsoever though all movie rotates around sex  etc.... sounds are missing.",1,map of sounds of tokyo is missing,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,890,"['Yes', 'i', 'go', 'Tokyo', 'year', 'so', 'am', 'familiar', 'place', 'Now', 'guess', 'authors', 'try', 'look', 'smart', 'use', 'title', 'imaginative', 'way', 'Ok', 'Lets', 'see', 'favored', 'movies', 'Tokyo', 'Enter', 'void', 'title', 'movie', 'Sleepless', 'city', 'title', 'movie', 'glamorous', 'life', 'title', 'movie.Hmm.The', 'movie', 'start', 'talking', 'somebody', 'girlfriend', 'commiting', 'suicide', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'rich', 'father', 'mad', 'other', 'chick', 'kill', 'boyfriend', '//', 'father', 'poor', 'what', 'suppose', 'do', '//', 'not', 'unusual', 'young', 'chicks', 'Japan', 'kill', 'highly', 'unusual', 'young', 'chick', 'be', 'hire', 'kill', 'anybody', 'point', 'normal', 'people', 'have', 'motivation', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'guess', 'normality', 'not', 'point', 'movie.Well', 'pointless', 'movie', 'nudity', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'sex', 'etc', 'sounds', 'are', 'missing']",N/A

The lead actress, Rinko Kikuchi, was in ""Babel"" andthe lead male, Sergi Lopez, was in ""Pan's Labyrinth"".  I can state the basic plot in onesentence  A hit-woman falls in love with the man she's contracted to murder.  And hereis the rest (a few, mild plot spoilers).  The beginning of the film was confusing to mebut this makes it easier to follow from the start.  A wealthy businessman, CEO of a largeJapanese corporation, Mr. Nagara, grieves the suicide of his (apparently only) daughter,Midori.  He blames her boyfriend.  His right-hand man says he will take care of it.  Hecontracts with a killer to murder the boyfriend (David).  The killer, Ryu, works at afish market but is a free-lance killer in her spare time.  The story is told from the(improbable) point of view of an older Japanese male who frequently has lunches with Ryu.He's hopelessly enchanted with her but she tells him nothing about her personal life.  Heis a sound recorder by profession and he enjoys taping the sounds of Ryu (hence, the title).Ryu locates the target but then becomes enamored of him and doesn't want to do the job.David explains to Ryu that his girlfriend committed suicide, and he can't get over her--hethinks about her every day.  She was chronically depressed but he was much in love with her.I thought this would be some kind of fast-paced sexy action film.  It is not.  It's not at allfast-paced, there are no chase-scenes and a very minimal amount of shooting (apart from thecamera, that is) and it's really more of a sad love story.Despite the title, the visuals really predominated in this film.  The director/script writerfavors minimal dialog and maximal visual imagery in this film.  The cinematography and theimages are great.  The visuals are the strongest part of this film, although with thecharacters, there are so many long close-ups that it got a little annoying.  The images ofTokyo and various interior images however, are really beautiful.The sound track has a number of songs,  none of which I particularly cared for.  They're mostlysolo-singer, sad love songs.There is partial nudity, basically from the hips up.  Rinko Kikuchi looks very good in partialnudity.  This DVD is unrated, but should be considered ""R"" based on partial nudity, someexplicit language, not really for violence.I recommend it for interesting images, not so much for plot or dialog.  Don't look for anaction movie here.  The cinematography is lovingly done.",3,The Basic Review,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2561,"['film', '2009', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'US', 'IFC', 'writer-director', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', 'also', 'did', 'Elegy', 'lead', 'actress', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'was', 'Babel', 'andthe', 'lead', 'male', 'Sergi', 'Lopez', 'was', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'can', 'state', 'basic', 'plot', 'onesentence', 'hit-woman', 'falls', 'love', 'man', 'contracted', 'murder', 'hereis', 'rest', 'few', 'mild', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'confusing', 'mebut', 'easier', 'follow', 'start', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'CEO', 'largeJapanese', 'corporation', 'Mr.', 'Nagara', 'suicide', 'apparently', 'only', 'daughter', 'Midori', 'boyfriend', 'right-hand', 'man', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'killer', 'murder', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'killer', 'Ryu', 'afish', 'market', 'free-lance', 'killer', 'spare', 'time', 'story', 'told', 'improbable', 'point', 'view', 'older', 'Japanese', 'male', 'who', 'frequently', 'lunches', 'Ryu.He', 'hopelessly', 'enchanted', 'nothing', 'personal', 'life', 'Heis', 'sound', 'recorder', 'profession', 'taping', 'sounds', 'Ryu', 'hence', 'title', 'target', 'then', 'enamored', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'job.David', 'Ryu', 'girlfriend', 'committed', 'suicide', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hethinks', 'day', 'was', 'chronically', 'depressed', 'was', 'much', 'love', 'her.I', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'fast-paced', 'sexy', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'not', 'allfast-paced', 'are', 'chase-scenes', 'very', 'minimal', 'amount', 'shooting', 'apart', 'thecamera', 'really', 'more', 'sad', 'love', 'title', 'visuals', 'really', 'predominated', 'film', 'director/script', 'writerfavors', 'minimal', 'dialog', 'maximal', 'visual', 'imagery', 'film', 'cinematography', 'theimages', 'are', 'great', 'visuals', 'are', 'strongest', 'part', 'film', 'thecharacters', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'long', 'close-ups', 'got', 'little', 'annoying', 'images', 'ofTokyo', 'various', 'interior', 'images', 'however', 'are', 'really', 'beautiful.The', 'sound', 'track', 'number', 'songs', 'none', 'particularly', 'cared', ""'re"", 'mostlysolo-singer', 'sad', 'love', 'partial', 'nudity', 'basically', 'hips', 'up', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'very', 'good', 'partialnudity', 'DVD', 'unrated', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'R', 'based', 'partial', 'nudity', 'someexplicit', 'language', 'not', 'really', 'violence.I', 'recommend', 'interesting', 'images', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'dialog', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'anaction', 'movie', 'here', 'cinematography', 'lovingly', 'done']",N/A

1385906,AVDLF7OP7O39J,B0045ZAQRS,Ralph Jenkins,"[7, 9]","First, let me say that the trailer for this film is rather misleading.  It makes the film look like a sexy thriller.It's actually a slow, picturesque drama about a fish market girl/assassin (Rinko Kikuchi, Babel) who starts a sexual relationship with her latest target (Sergi Lopez, Pan's Labyrinth), a foreign wine shop proprietor coming to terms with the death of his girlfriend.The story is narrated (in Japanese with English subtitles) by an older man who records sound effects for movies, hence the title.  He seems to be the only acquaintance of Kikuchi's character.  She is quiet and seems lonely.  She often visits the cemetery to clean the graves of people she has killed.It's like Last Tango in Paris if that film were set in Tokyo, and if Maria Shneider's character were a hit woman hired to kill Brando.  Instead of a run-down apartment, their trysts take place in a ""love hotel"" designed to look like a subway car (which, I'll admit, is quite interesting).  However, this movie is not on the same level as Last Tango, mainly because it often lacks focus.Rinko Kikuchi is what made this movie worth watching for me.  She has a very interesting look, and her character here is mysterious.  She has very little dialogue; most of her performance is in her facial expressions and her body language.  (She also apparently isn't shy about nudity.)  We never really learn much about her character, but it's hard to take your eyes off her.",4,Worth watching for Rinko Kikuchi,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1443,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'trailer', 'film', 'rather', 'misleading', 'film', 'look', 'sexy', 'thriller.It', 'actually', 'slow', 'picturesque', 'drama', 'fish', 'market', 'girl/assassin', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'Babel', 'who', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'latest', 'target', 'Sergi', 'Lopez', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'foreign', 'wine', 'shop', 'proprietor', 'coming', 'terms', 'death', 'girlfriend.The', 'story', 'narrated', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'sound', 'effects', 'movies', 'hence', 'title', 'be', 'only', 'acquaintance', 'Kikuchi', 'character', 'quiet', 'lonely', 'often', 'cemetery', 'clean', 'graves', 'people', 'killed.It', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'film', 'were', 'set', 'Tokyo', 'Maria', 'Shneider', 'character', 'were', 'hit', 'woman', 'hired', 'kill', 'Brando', 'Instead', 'run-down', 'apartment', 'trysts', 'take', 'place', 'love', 'hotel', 'designed', 'look', 'subway', 'car', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'quite', 'interesting', 'However', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'Last', 'Tango', 'mainly', 'often', 'focus.Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'character', 'here', 'mysterious', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'most', 'performance', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'also', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'shy', 'nudity', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'much', 'character', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes']",N/A
1385907,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0045ZAQRS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Map of the Sounds of Tokyo (Isabel Coixet, 2009)About twenty minutes before the end of the interminable Map of the Sounds of Tokyo, a couple of things clicked into place. Suddenly I thought I had the movie figured out, and I was about to cut it a whole hell of a lot of slack because that plot twist was absolutely brilliant, nothing you haven't seen before but the setup was subtle and well-grounded and kind of astonishing. I figured out why ten minutes later; I was entirely wrong. Coixet (Elegy), who also wrote, either had no idea what she'd slipped in at that point, or had meant that as a red herring. In the former case, the movie just goes back to being interminable. In the latter case, it fills me with the kind of rage I reserve for movies whose directors are so inept they should never be allowed behind a camera again (I won't name names, but a quick trip through my hundred-worst list noting directors who appear more than once should produce a concise list). I'm trying to be generous and stick with the former interpretation, but if you have the misfortune of watching this movie, stick around until after the credits and check out the final shot of the film. It reinforces some of what I'm going to say below, and it drove me up the wall.Plot: Narrador (The Twilight Samurai's Min Tanaka)'s daughter recently committed suicide. He's not happy about it, and he blames her boyfriend David (Pan's Labyrinth's Sergi L&oacute;pez). Narrador wants revenge. David, meanwhile, meets a new woman, Ryu (Norwegian Wood's Rinko Kikuchi), and the two of them begin the ghost of an affair, one in which David has no qualms in telling Ryu that when he's with her, she's just a stand-in for his dead girlfriend. Oddly, she seems okay with this.  On the other hand, that is far from the weirdest thing that is going on in this movie.Now, everyone who has delved into modern Japanese cinema&#8212;even on the surface these days, with Machine Girl having become a cult smash on this side of the pond&#8212;is probably well that weird stuff happens. The Japanese have taken the concept of &#8220;magical realism&#8221; and thrown it completely off the rails. (Two words: Haruki Murakami.) But the second half of that magical concept is realism; in movies like Hellevator, or even Executive Koala, there's an internal consistency to what's going on. The events in these movies make sense within the universe that the scriptwriter and director have created. And then we have Map of the Sounds of Tokyo. There's the guy who walks around wearing a suit made of bushes. He appears twice in the movie. (Note: I assume this is a male character, but am unsure.) He does nothing in the movie except appear, and as far as I can tell, the only reason for his existence is for Coixet to say &#8220;hey, look, I can do that whole weird stuff happens thing, too!&#8221;. Except that it's not connected to anything, unless I missed something, and thus it's not internally consistent, it's gratuitous... and I'm so annoyed by this I just lopped off an entire star. This is what happens when you don't finish writing your reviews on the day you finish watching the movie. *",1,Bore or be bored.,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,3154,"['Map', 'Sounds', 'Tokyo', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', '2009', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'end', 'interminable', 'Map', 'Sounds', 'Tokyo', 'couple', 'things', 'clicked', 'place', 'Suddenly', 'thought', 'had', 'movie', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'about', 'cut', 'whole', 'hell', 'lot', 'slack', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'setup', 'was', 'subtle', 'well-grounded', 'kind', 'astonishing', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'was', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'Coixet', 'Elegy', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'had', 'idea', 'what', ""'d"", 'slipped', 'point', 'had', 'meant', 'red', 'herring', 'former', 'case', 'movie', 'just', 'back', 'being', 'interminable', 'latter', 'case', 'kind', 'rage', 'reserve', 'movies', 'directors', 'are', 'so', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'camera', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'name', 'names', 'quick', 'trip', 'hundred-worst', 'list', 'noting', 'directors', 'who', 'appear', 'more', 'once', 'should', 'produce', 'concise', 'list', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'generous', 'stick', 'former', 'interpretation', 'have', 'misfortune', 'watching', 'movie', 'stick', 'credits', 'check', 'out', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'drove', 'up', 'wall.Plot', 'Narrador', 'Twilight', 'Samurai', 'Min', 'Tanaka', 'daughter', 'recently', 'committed', 'suicide', 'not', 'happy', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Sergi', 'L', 'oacute', 'pez', 'Narrador', 'revenge', 'David', 'meanwhile', 'new', 'woman', 'Ryu', 'Norwegian', 'Wood', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'two', 'begin', 'ghost', 'affair', 'one', 'David', 'qualms', 'telling', 'Ryu', 'when', 'just', 'stand-in', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'Oddly', 'okay', 'other', 'hand', 'far', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'going', 'movie.Now', 'everyone', 'who', 'delved', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'cinema', '8212', 'even', 'surface', 'days', 'Machine', 'Girl', 'having', 'become', 'cult', 'smash', 'side', 'pond', '8212', 'probably', 'well', 'weird', 'stuff', 'Japanese', 'have', 'taken', 'concept', '8220', 'magical', 'realism', '8221', 'thrown', 'completely', 'rails', 'Two', 'words', 'Haruki', 'Murakami', 'second', 'half', 'magical', 'concept', 'realism', 'movies', 'Hellevator', 'even', 'Executive', 'Koala', 'internal', 'consistency', 'what', 'going', 'events', 'movies', 'make', 'sense', 'universe', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'have', 'created', 'then', 'have', 'Map', 'Sounds', 'Tokyo', 'guy', 'who', 'walks', 'wearing', 'suit', 'made', 'bushes', 'twice', 'movie', 'Note', 'assume', 'male', 'character', 'am', 'unsure', 'nothing', 'movie', 'appear', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'reason', 'existence', 'Coixet', 'say', '8220', 'hey', 'look', 'can', 'do', 'whole', 'weird', 'stuff', 'thing', 'too', '8221', 'not', 'connected', 'anything', 'missed', 'something', 'thus', 'not', 'internally', 'consistent', 'gratuitous', ""'m"", 'so', 'annoyed', 'just', 'lopped', 'off', 'entire', 'star', 'what', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'finish', 'writing', 'reviews', 'day', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', '*']",N/A
