It's about a teenage boy who has to quit school and deal drugs so his classmates feel content having their fix.  The problem?  That's pretty much all that happens, other than several parties and a few sex scenes.  Only one particular shooting scene caught my attention for the shock value.  It's so much a teen flick that an adult wouldn't be able to sit through this plotless nonsense.  In addition to these problems, Kiefer Sutherland does the narration and it's a VERY rare day when I'm disappointed in a movie starring Kiefer Sutherland.

1388063,A3LEH88D3QKIJ8,B00475B0HQ,"Gemma Cheyne ""artist598""","[0, 0]","It's not so much that this is an anti-drugs movie--though it is--as it is a rather sad look at the empty rich youth who presumably populate NYC, while 98% of the rest of the world are actually working jobs, going to college and dealing with life. Generally the parental/family situations are not given as much emphasis in this type of movie. I had the feeling they were trying to say: because of bad examples set by parents, the kids are all messed up. But they could only claim that because the kids were still living at home. Not everyone in the movie is particularly hung up on &#34;twelve&#34; though we are never shown why it is so addicting to some and not others. Only two of the characters are at all responsible types, and one of these ends up wasted at a party and the other ends up crying in a corner. True friendship is at a minimum. A couple are bona fide crazies. It is sad teenagers feel this way, that they have to be popular at any cost.The only 3 people in the movie who have any sense of feeling or responsibility are White Mike, Chris and Molly. And even they have to lower themselves as a means to an end or keeping the peace. Casting was quite good and the interaction between the characters when not being interrupted by the narrator seemed fairly natural in some cases and too stylized in others. It came off a bit like a TV show mixed in with a different movie. The narration was weird - like Sin City for teens. In some scenes the locations or sets took away from the actors. Interesting soundtrack, nice looking film. Probably mostly a showcase for new stars. Good message: don't swim with sharks.

1388064,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00475B0HQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","TWELVE is a film that is at first terrifying in its message about the irresponsible, uncontrollable  drive for physical gratification among the wealthy youth of New York, and then a film that makes us profoundly sad that this is what we in our permissive, no established behavioral boundaries society have produced.  Joel Schumacher knows his game and once again forces us to examine what we have produced in failing to give our younger generation the security for learning guidelines for social interaction. Jordan Melemed adapted Nick McDonell's novel for the screen and the flow of the story is in the form of offscreen narration by Kiefer Sutherland.'Twelve' is the new play drug in the party circles of New York City and is supplied to the kids by Lionel (50 Cent), all other drugs being the purview of White Mike (Chace Crawford), a lad whose mother's death from cancer has left him aimless, electing to deal drugs rather than join his confreres in going to the 'proper colleges'. White Mike watches as his high-rolling life is dismantled in the wake of his cousin's murder, which sees his best friend arrested for the crime.  White Mike believes that his fellow youth don't need anything, they just want everything and the nexus of his philosophy is drugs. A grossly dysfunctional family of boys - Chris (Rory Culkin), Hunter (Phillip Ettinger) and Claude (Billy Magnussen) - have 'famous parties' in their parents' absence especially for the local bedbunny Sara (Esti Ginzburg).  Another sad character is Jessica (Emily Meade) who takes 'Twelve' by mistake and then becomes addicted while her floozy mother (Ellen Barkin) and her supplier Lionel alter her life.  The murder of White Mike's cousin and the subsequent effect it has on the rest of these young people leads to a disastrous conclusion. Their lives are as empty as their drug-addled brains.A story of decay and decadence and misplaced ideals, TWELVE is not pretty to watch, but the performances by some of these young actors make it memorable, forcing us to look at what we've done to our youth.

1388065,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00475B0HQ,Haunted Flower,"[2, 5]","1 Blu-ray Disc, being released December 28, 2010""Twelve"" was directed by Joel Schumacher and the story is based on the novel by Nick McDonell. It is about a privileged young rich guy who is a drug dealer who doesn't do drugs and the lives of those he is connected to whose lives are falling apart from drugs.It is basically ""Gossip Girl"" with a ""Requiem for a Dream"" twist. It even has a narrator. But at least it's Kiefer Sutherland instead of Kristen Bell, right? You get used to it after a while, but it is pretty distracting, even with the best gravely voice choice. ""White Mike does walks down the street, White Mike switches his phone off...blah blah blah"" The most hilarious part of the whole ""Gossip Girl"" feeling to the movie is that White Mike is played by Chace Crawford (Chace? Really?) who plays Nate Archibald on ""Gossip Girl."" White Mike's mother died a while ago and he is still messed up over it and took up drug dealing soon after. His only hope appears to be his childhood friend, Molly played by Emma Roberts whom he takes for granted. Look at the rich kids who are distanced from their parents because their parents are always too busy to hang out with them or on vacation somewhere and not monitoring them so these kids have to amuse themselves by having ""famous"" parties, underage drinking, weed, and the new drug called ""twelve.""Twelve is like cocaine and ecstasy put together. Emily Meade plays Jessica who after trying twelve once at a party becomes addicted and is willing to do anything to get more, including offer herself to 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) who plays Lionel, another drug dealer. Rory Culkin (How many Culkins ARE there?) plays Chris who is a Momma's boy looking after the house while his parents are away and is manipulated into throwing a huge birthday party for Sara Ludlow played by Esti Ginzburg. Sara is the most popular girl in school and is a shallow excuse for a human being and hates herself for it. Chris has a brother, Claude played by Billy Magnussen who is back from rehab and with his mood swings and demeanor, it can be assumed he is on steroids and since he is carrying a samurai sword around, people aren't safe.Everyone is connected like this. White Mike has a cousin who is messed up on drugs and missing and turns out dead. His best friend who is messed up on drugs and got in a fight earlier gets accused of the crime. There are idiot parrot girls who repeat everything Sara or Jessica says ad nauseum and are in complete agreement with them about everything. Just like Serena and Blair. Uh-oh, Queen B, another movie is stepping on your territory, but in an R rated kind of way. XOXO.Bonus Features:Trailers. Even on the Blu-ray.

For a lower budget film this was done so well and the acting was on point. I liked a lot of the actors they chose for this film Chase Crawford, Emma Roberts, Curtis Jackson it just felt well done for such a young cast of stars. The main thing that makes this movie stand out is the story. The reason for this is because most of this movie is the reality of certain people in everyday life. I myself was not this bad but I was sent away to boarding school when I was younger because I was misbehaving. It hit home in the beginning for me when I found out most of these kids where from boarding school. One thing that seemed annoying in the beginning but played out really well in the end was the commentator in the background giving you an explanation of each person in the beginning. It was such a pain to start but it really helped the story develop and paid out in the end. No need to worry because this does not go one all throughout the movie just the beginning. Chase Crawford does a really good job in his role and you really do sympathies with him because he lost his mother at such a young age. 50 Cent aka Curtis Jackson is the bad guy in this movie and you can tell from the beginning when the kid holds him up for drugs and once he gives them to him he shoots him. He does not come up as much as you would expect but he is in enough scenes and holds the main drug that will get a lot of people addicted in this movie called Twelve. Emma Roberts really plays well in her role of the only one who probably goes out once and awhile but for the most part is living a straight and honest life. Her and White Mike aka (Chase Crawford) have been friends for a long time. She really likes him and he likes her but because of the life style he is living he does not want to pull her down with him by dating her. Rory Culkin know as Chris in the movie plays a huge role as he is so nice to everyone but a lot of people just use him for drugs or his nice house. His brother Claude aka (Billy Magnussen) is rather crazy. After being shipped off to boot camp he has a real problem with Rory because he feels his mom likes him more than him. Also he feels Rory is a momma's boy and that takes place later in the movie. Not to give too much away but for an hour and a half movie this sure was powerful. It was sad to look back on and realize how drugs can affect our everyday life. A lot of these characters portrayed in a movie are just like kids today in our society. And it's sad to think about. I am going to give this movie a 4.5/5 overall and a strong recommendation to pick this up. I got it early for the sales today at FYE they had already shipped it so you might be able to find it. Hey for $17.99 it was well worth my money and I would say it would be well worth yours as well.",5,"Twelve gives you a reality of the world we live in today.

1388070,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00475B0HQ,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","There's a genre of film out there that isn't all that big but that folks in film making seem to think reflects more people watching film than actually exist. Then again perhaps not because the characters in these films rarely watch anything because they're too busy talking about themselves and how wonderful yet empty their lives are. I'm talking about the movies that feature a young cast starring as bored socialite teens involved in any and all things possible. Perhaps LESS THAN ZERO started this genre but the most recent addition is TWELVE.Chace Crawford stars as White Mike, known as such because he deals drugs to his ex-friends. A year ago Mike's mother died of cancer and Mike hasn't actually dealt with that. With the costs of her treatment, Mike and his dad have fallen on hard times with his dad losing his business, taking a more menial job and Mike pretty much left on his own.Apparently the best way to help is to close yourself off from the world and deal drugs to vapid upper crust teens.The story revolves around Mike and is more narrated than acted. While you watch a group of these teens walking down the street, the narrator (Kiefer Sutherland) tells you who they are and everything about them. And there are plenty of characters in this group. Suffice to say that every one of them, with the exception of Mike's friend from the past Molly (Emma Roberts) who isn't part of the spoiled rich crowd, find themselves with plenty of money and no adult supervision whatsoever.Among this group of old friends that are now customers, we have the girl who wants nothing more than to be famous, a girl who is smart but who discovers she wants nothing more than the new drug ""twelve"", a friend turned junkie who starts the story rolling by being shot with his own gun by Mike's supplier, a youngster who only wants to be accepted by this group who opens his home to them for parties and his brother who's totally whacked out and rebellious and whose final scene is predictable from the get go. This is not a group of people those of us in real life would chose to spend time with. But movie makers view them as ""the real world"".The lives of these characters entwine from beginning to end, all of them connecting at one time or another to Mike. Fortunately Mike is the most compelling character here, a young man trying to deal with the loss of his mother, his social status and the world around him. Mike just seems to get by, trying to survive and find himself. But the chances of doing that in his current occupation and with those he chooses to surround himself with won't assist him in getting there. His one hope is Molly and Mike tends to shy away from her, not wanting her to know what he does now. Perhaps that's because he's ashamed of how he's turned out or perhaps it's because Molly more than anything reminds him of his mother and his past life.The rest of the characters are cut outs that display the traits mentioned earlier. It's hard to find a sympathetic character in the bunch. Once more we have the kids who have everything acting like they have nothing, abusing the possibilities they have at their fingertips while complaining about the world around them. One of them even gets into a discussion with her mother where mom says that another family is destitute due to economic times, that their net worth dropped 40%. Her daughter reminds her that they still have millions. Yeah, kind of hard to feel for these kids.The life of a socialite it seems involves little more than texting, talking, going to parties, getting drunk or stoned and looking for the next big party or high. There is no talk of the future, of what they want out of life, of trying to be someone. It's a world of self absorption where they believe the world revolves around them and their interests. Kind of like the movies that are being made these days.I won't give away the ending or what happens throughout the film to lead there. Suffice to say that the murdered friend of Mike, the other friend accused of the murder, the actual killer and the group of bored rich kids all come together by the final reel. And while it's an attractive film to watch, well made and shot, in the end you won't find yourself saying hey lets watch that one again.Instead you'll have spent time watching some decent acting, some good photography and a movie that's as empty as the kids involved in the story. With the abilities on display by some of these actors let's hope that they're given something that gives them the chance to carry on and show what they can do.My guess is that critics will hail this film and talk about the depth displayed when in truth its one of those films that gives you the impression the critics are totally out of touch with the rest of the world.  Its worth watching for the performances alone but as a story it leaves much to be desired.",3,SPOILED + RICH = SEMI-INTERESTING,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,4858,"['genre', 'film', 'there', ""n't"", 'big', 'folks', 'film', 'making', 'seem', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'actually', 'exist', 'Then', 'again', 'perhaps', 'not', 'characters', 'films', 'rarely', 'watch', 'anything', ""'re"", 'too', 'busy', 'talking', 'how', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'empty', 'lives', 'are', ""'m"", 'talking', 'movies', 'feature', 'young', 'cast', 'starring', 'bored', 'socialite', 'teens', 'involved', 'things', 'possible', 'Perhaps', 'LESS', 'THAN', 'ZERO', 'started', 'genre', 'most', 'recent', 'addition', 'TWELVE.Chace', 'Crawford', 'White', 'Mike', 'known', 'such', 'drugs', 'ex-friends', 'year', 'Mike', 'mother', 'died', 'cancer', 'Mike', ""n't"", 'actually', 'dealt', 'costs', 'treatment', 'Mike', 'dad', 'have', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'dad', 'losing', 'business', 'taking', 'more', 'menial', 'job', 'Mike', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'own.Apparently', 'best', 'way', 'help', 'close', 'off', 'world', 'deal', 'drugs', 'vapid', 'upper', 'crust', 'teens.The', 'story', 'Mike', 'more', 'narrated', 'acted', 'watch', 'group', 'teens', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'narrator', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'are', 'everything', 'are', 'plenty', 'characters', 'group', 'Suffice', 'say', 'one', 'exception', 'Mike', 'friend', 'past', 'Molly', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'who', ""n't"", 'part', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'crowd', 'find', 'plenty', 'money', 'adult', 'supervision', 'group', 'old', 'friends', 'are', 'now', 'customers', 'have', 'girl', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'famous', 'girl', 'who', 'smart', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'new', 'drug', 'twelve', 'friend', 'turned', 'junkie', 'who', 'story', 'rolling', 'being', 'shot', 'own', 'gun', 'Mike', 'supplier', 'youngster', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'accepted', 'group', 'who', 'home', 'parties', 'brother', 'who', 'totally', 'whacked', 'out', 'rebellious', 'final', 'scene', 'predictable', 'get', 'go', 'not', 'group', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'chose', 'spend', 'time', 'movie', 'makers', 'view', 'real', 'world', '.The', 'lives', 'characters', 'entwine', 'beginning', 'end', 'connecting', 'one', 'time', 'Mike', 'Fortunately', 'Mike', 'most', 'compelling', 'character', 'here', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'deal', 'loss', 'mother', 'social', 'status', 'world', 'Mike', 'just', 'get', 'trying', 'survive', 'find', 'chances', 'doing', 'current', 'occupation', 'surround', 'wo', ""n't"", 'assist', 'getting', 'there', 'one', 'hope', 'Molly', 'Mike', 'shy', 'away', 'not', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'now', 'Perhaps', 'ashamed', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'perhaps', 'Molly', 'more', 'anything', 'mother', 'past', 'life.The', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'cut', 'outs', 'display', 'traits', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'hard', 'find', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'bunch', 'Once', 'more', 'have', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'acting', 'have', 'nothing', 'abusing', 'possibilities', 'have', 'fingertips', 'complaining', 'world', 'One', 'even', 'discussion', 'mother', 'where', 'mom', 'family', 'destitute', 'due', 'economic', 'times', 'net', 'worth', 'dropped', '40', '%', 'daughter', 'still', 'have', 'millions', 'Yeah', 'kind', 'hard', 'feel', 'kids.The', 'life', 'socialite', 'little', 'more', 'texting', 'talking', 'going', 'parties', 'getting', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'looking', 'next', 'big', 'party', 'high', 'talk', 'future', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'trying', 'be', 'someone', 'world', 'self', 'absorption', 'where', 'believe', 'world', 'interests', 'Kind', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'days.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'what', 'film', 'lead', 'there', 'Suffice', 'say', 'murdered', 'friend', 'Mike', 'other', 'friend', 'accused', 'murder', 'actual', 'killer', 'group', 'bored', 'rich', 'kids', 'come', 'together', 'final', 'reel', 'attractive', 'film', 'watch', 'well', 'made', 'shot', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'saying', 'hey', 'lets', 'watch', 'one', 'again.Instead', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'watching', 'decent', 'acting', 'good', 'photography', 'movie', 'as', 'empty', 'kids', 'involved', 'story', 'abilities', 'display', 'actors', 'let', 'hope', ""'re"", 'given', 'something', 'chance', 'carry', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do.My', 'guess', 'critics', 'will', 'hail', 'film', 'talk', 'depth', 'displayed', 'when', 'truth', 'one', 'films', 'impression', 'critics', 'are', 'totally', 'touch', 'rest', 'world', 'worth', 'watching', 'performances', 'alone', 'story', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

1388073,A3NIZEWU56A364,B00475B0HQ,Movie Mike,"[4, 7]",The movie is driven by a narrator.  The movie relies so heavily on the narrator to move the story along that the narrator interferes in what could have been an excellent movie.  Every movie that I have started to see that is based on a narrator to move the movie along has taught me one thing: The director does not have faith in the acting abilities of the actors to move the story along.  And this movie is no exception.  It is frustrating for when the actors are allowed to act they are excellent actors.  In fact the actors have no need of the idiotic narrator that states what does not need to stated.  The actors themselves could act out what the narrator states.  So am very disappointed in what I first thought would be an excellent movie.  All of the factors are in place for a stellar movie and the director is so spineless that he or she cops out and heavily relies on a narrator to make the story work.  I want my money back.  I would advise not to see the movie if you are looking forward to watching a movie that is based on acting instead of based on a narrator.

I was sure that it had to do something with today's generation of twenty somethings and how they deal with their realities of growing up and making it in the real world.  Film is set in NYC and follows several young men and women.  The main character is ""White Mike"", who we find out is a dropout from Harward University.  It is not the usual rebellion against the establishment or parents thing - Mike was actually affected greatly (emotionally and financially) by the death of his mother (she dies of cancer).  His does not voice his trauma and does not show it to anyone - bud sadness is with him constantly althought the year has passed since his mother died.From that premise on we learn about Mike's close friends and family, his customers (Mike is a drug dealer - the only easy and quick way he can earn his living and pay his bills) and former college buddies if they can be called as such, since now they and Mike seem to be using each other as a connection between world of money and the underworld of drugs.  Mike is special - he does not drink, does not smoke, does nto use drugs, he is not a womanizer -- and he even has principles on what drugs he sells and who he sells it to.  Until one day, young and rich Manhattan Harward students on their spring break discover new drug called ""Twelve"".  This is better that heroin, ectasy, coke, meth or anything else on the market.  But is also highly addictive and very expensive.Mike does not care about any of it.  He lives in his own world of grief, loss and loneliness.  He is alianated from everyone and even getting out of bed in the morning is an effort for him.  Does his melancholy about the untimely loss of his mother make him more likable (drug dealer) or less likable?  Does his new profession has anything to do who Mike really is?  Is Mike trying to play God, or is he just biding his time until his emotional pain goes away - will his pain ever go away or even fade away?  But one day, Mike's little safety net of friends becoems to crumble and it is his wake up call to accept the consequences of his lifestyle.  Will he take responsibility for his choices, will he salvage his love for the only person he really cares about or is there something else in store for him?You must watch this movie.  If anything, it will make you think about the new young generation and  unique difficulties they face entering the world of adults, no matter how privileged - or not.",4,What it is like to be young today,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,2510,"['saw', 'movie', 'recently', 'mostly', 'very', 'young', 'actors', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'today', 'generation', 'twenty', 'somethings', 'how', 'deal', 'realities', 'growing', 'up', 'making', 'real', 'world', 'Film', 'set', 'NYC', 'several', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'main', 'character', 'White', 'Mike', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'dropout', 'Harward', 'University', 'not', 'usual', 'rebellion', 'establishment', 'parents', 'thing', 'Mike', 'was', 'actually', 'affected', 'greatly', 'emotionally', 'financially', 'death', 'mother', 'cancer', 'not', 'voice', 'trauma', 'not', 'show', 'anyone', 'bud', 'sadness', 'constantly', 'althought', 'year', 'passed', 'mother', 'died.From', 'premise', 'learn', 'Mike', 'close', 'friends', 'family', 'customers', 'Mike', 'drug', 'dealer', 'only', 'easy', 'quick', 'way', 'can', 'earn', 'living', 'pay', 'bills', 'former', 'college', 'buddies', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'such', 'now', 'Mike', 'seem', 'be', 'using', 'other', 'connection', 'world', 'money', 'underworld', 'drugs', 'Mike', 'special', 'not', 'drink', 'not', 'smoke', 'nto', 'use', 'drugs', 'not', 'womanizer', 'even', 'principles', 'what', 'drugs', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'rich', 'Manhattan', 'Harward', 'students', 'spring', 'break', 'discover', 'new', 'drug', 'called', 'Twelve', 'better', 'heroin', 'ectasy', 'coke', 'meth', 'anything', 'else', 'market', 'also', 'highly', 'addictive', 'very', 'expensive.Mike', 'not', 'care', 'own', 'world', 'grief', 'loss', 'loneliness', 'alianated', 'everyone', 'even', 'getting', 'bed', 'morning', 'effort', 'melancholy', 'untimely', 'loss', 'mother', 'make', 'more', 'likable', 'drug', 'dealer', 'less', 'likable', 'new', 'profession', 'anything', 'do', 'who', 'Mike', 'really', 'Mike', 'trying', 'play', 'God', 'just', 'biding', 'time', 'emotional', 'pain', 'away', 'will', 'pain', 'ever', 'go', 'away', 'even', 'fade', 'away', 'one', 'day', 'Mike', 'little', 'safety', 'net', 'friends', 'becoems', 'crumble', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'accept', 'consequences', 'lifestyle', 'Will', 'take', 'responsibility', 'choices', 'will', 'salvage', 'love', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'there', 'something', 'else', 'store', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'anything', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'new', 'young', 'generation', 'unique', 'difficulties', 'face', 'entering', 'world', 'adults', 'matter', 'how', 'privileged', 'not']",N/A

1388081,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00475B0HQ,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Gossip Girl meets Limitless in this clever, fast-paced, independent drama by Joel Shumacher. The story follows Manhattan's elite teenage population and illustrates how even the wealthy aren't immune to the problems of the big city. The film has a ton of characters and is cleverly narrated by Kiefer Sutherland, who helps us keep everything straight. Twelve refers to a new designer drug on the street and the film centers around High School drop out, White Mike (Chance Crawford), who is connected to just about every one. Forced by unforeseen circumstance, White Mike has become their dealer and has all the dirt on these elite people. As for the story, it's a complicated, winding tale, that I honestly found to be intriguing. Crawford is phenomenal as the center piece to everything and finally proves that's he's not just a pretty face. A former model, Crawford has gained popularity as one of the leads in Gossip Girl and it has been said, on more than one occasion, that his looks are the reason, but he proves them all wrong with a gutsy and amazing performance in Twelve. As for the rest of the cast, it's such an amazing random mix of people that you can't help but fall in love with it. In Twelve, there are appearances from everyone from 50 cent to Macaulay Culkin's little brother, Dewey from Malcolm In The Middle, and even Lenny Kravitz's daughter. You never know whose going to show up and what their story might be.
