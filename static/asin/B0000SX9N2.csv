However, there is a child who bears its powers and he was kidnapped. So, of course, Jackie Chan must save the child and stop the bad guys from misusing the Medallion.The problem with this Jackie Chan movie...is that it's not a Jackie Chan movie.

I have seen virtually every movie of his back from when he was a teenager and I'm still searching for all the well hidden films of his.  To make the point short, I am an enormous Jackie Chan fan.What does that mean? Basically, it means I'll watch anything with Jackie Chan in it. Hell, I'll watch an martial arts porno if it has Jackie Chan in it. What THIS translate to is that I'm not difficult to please when it comes to Jackie Chan movies. All you have to do is star him and let him fight, preferably for at least 40% of the movie, and I'll love it. So how in the hell did this movie turn out like this?Well, because they mess up the fighting scenes. I hate those magical-type martial arts movies and, in this one, Jackie is jumping all over the place. What a misuse of talent. I hated this movie because it didn't have any of the classic Jackie Chan attributes.There was no jaw dropping fight scenes, there was virtually no Jackie-type comedy, there was no ANYTHING!

On here however, even the funny momemts are hardly enough to muster up a laugh at all.Jackie Chan stars as a Hong Kong detective who is investigating a notorious international smuggler who is after a mysterious ancient artifact called The Medallion that resurrects and gives eternal life to those who wear it but a kid who bears it's power is kidnapped by the smugglers and now the Hong Kong detective must rescue him from them and retrieve the artifact before it is used by the ringleaders.Sadly, being a huge Jackie Chan fan, ""The Medallion"" is by far the most uninspiring movie that he has ever starred in. Even all of the slapstick stunts are nowhere near as funny as like those in classics like ""Rush Hour"" or his cult hit ""Rumble In The Bronx"". There is virtually nothing that inspires laughs like the truck full of childrens play balls falling off the fourth level parking garage in ""Rumble In The Bronx"" or even those from ""The Tuxedo"", his weakest movie before this travesty came along.The acting is absolutely ridiculous and even Jackie's eccentricity that has made him so much fun to watch isn't enough to save this garbage. The acting by almost everyone else doesn't help either.

Sure, he is getting a little older these days, but he can still put out films like New Police Story, I just don't understand.  If he was aiming for a kids movie with Medallion, then he has succeeded.  And if there was anything I did enjoy most from this film, it didn't necassarily come from Chan himself.Bascially, this really did seem like something made for kids.  The idea of The Medallion did not appeal to me at all, and seemed rather corny and cheesy.  It is about a young boy who holds the power of life and death in a medallion, which he is the chosen protector of.  There wasn't much exploration throughout the film about the medallion.  We get to see it used twice, bringing the Chan character back to life early on and again briefly for the villain.  Other than that, this is basically a back and forth chase movie, as bad guys and good guys try to claim the boy and medallion.Most Chan movies have lots of chases - by foot, bicycle, car and who knows what.  In Medallion, the action sequences and chases are kind of boring for a Chan film.  Lots of wirework and digital graphics are used, which means hardly any real stunts from Jackie.  There is a foot chase early on that lasts for several minutes where Chan walks across a row of bicycles and does some other nice things, but thats about it.  As far as fights go, I was also dissapointed.  Chan fights the bad guy (Jullian Sands) twice, but both scenes are laughably bad.  There was no skill involved, as everyhting was digital and bad camera work.In addition to a weak story, the characters were quite uninteresting and there was little development between them.  The humor you expect from Chan films is a different kind of humor, provided mostly by the Lee Evans character, who is Chan's partner.  For awhile I thought his humor was kind of stupid, but eventually it should give some laughs, and ends up being about the only enjoybale thing out of this film.Don't expect anything serious, anything great, or any teriffic action.  This is a lousy film that is worth watching once and probably it.  I definetly see this designed more for kids.  It was just too cheesy and poor for my taste.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","""Legend says every thousand years a child is chosen that can bind the two halves of the medallion together and restore life to the dead. Now you get that kid AND the medallion? You're a god."" In THE MEDALLION Hong Kong detective Eddie Yang teams up with two Interpol agents (Claire Forlani, Lee Evans) to take down the British criminal mastermind Snakehead. Snakehead (Julian Sands) nurses definite world-conquering ambitions and he sets his eyes on obtaining a mystical medallion which bestows its owner with super-strength, immortality, and other extraordinary abilitiies. But the key lies in the mystical little Chinese boy who controls the medallion, and you'll just have to overlook the fact that even though this sacred kid inhabits a Buddhist temple deep in the sewers of Hong Kong, he speaks with an English accent. The boy falls under Eddie Yang's protection. Eddie's protection kinda sucks.I like this movie mostly because Jackie Chan is in it, and because I love Claire Forlani and her marvelous eyes, and occasionally Lee Evans's oddball, fumbly comedy stylings (""Interpol, freeze!""). Jackie's physicality is as amazing as ever, and the best sequence here may well be his pursuit of a lanky, particularly agile henchman thru the streets of Dublin. When Jackie effortlessly scales that tall gated wall, whew... But THE MEDALLION demonstrates again that a Jackie Chan picture doesn't fare too well with CGI, and this is because Jackie by himself is a walking, breathing special effects. Jackie has performed his own death-defying stunts for so long that any outside embellishments just seems superfluous; it really feels like cheating. As far as his role in the film, I thought Eddie Yang was handling his business pretty well before he gained all these super powers... although, okay, he did end up drowning to death. The first half of the film is fantastic, action wise. Afterwards, the CG stuff takes over and it's a bit much. Jackie Chan by his natural self is a hard chap to kill. His having super powers, it just doesn't seem fair.Claire Forlani and Jackie Chan achieve this sort of sweet relationship, although their romance is more lukewarm than anything. Chan has better chemistry with Lee Evans, even though Evans stabs him, experimentally, like a billion times in one scene. Some things to look forward to: Forlani (or maybe her double) shows off some martial arts skills and the wife of Lee Evans' character ends up surprising you. And, as ever, stay tuned for the blooper reel during the closing credits.I mentioned that I occasionally enjoyed Lee Evans's humor, but a bit of him does go a long way. Mostly, the comedy in THE MEDALLION is pretty painful. Julian Sands as the villain fails to invoke that same sinister presence he brought to WARLOCK. I'm also not feeling his showdowns with Jackie. THE MEDALLION is worth a look because of Jackie being Jackie in the first half. Ironically, when Jackie sinks and drowns halfway thru and is then resurrected, it's really from that point that the movie itself really begins to capsize.",3,"""Don't you think I recognize my own thing?'",1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,3055,"['Legend', 'thousand', 'years', 'child', 'chosen', 'can', 'bind', 'two', 'halves', 'medallion', 'together', 'restore', 'life', 'dead', 'Now', 'get', 'kid', 'medallion', ""'re"", 'god', 'MEDALLION', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'detective', 'Eddie', 'Yang', 'up', 'two', 'Interpol', 'agents', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'take', 'down', 'British', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Snakehead', 'Snakehead', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'definite', 'world-conquering', 'ambitions', 'eyes', 'obtaining', 'mystical', 'medallion', 'owner', 'super-strength', 'immortality', 'other', 'extraordinary', 'abilitiies', 'key', 'lies', 'mystical', 'little', 'Chinese', 'boy', 'who', 'medallion', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'overlook', 'fact', 'even', 'sacred', 'kid', 'Buddhist', 'temple', 'deep', 'sewers', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'English', 'accent', 'boy', 'Eddie', 'Yang', 'protection', 'Eddie', 'protection', 'kinda', 'sucks.I', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'love', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'marvelous', 'eyes', 'occasionally', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'oddball', 'fumbly', 'comedy', 'stylings', 'Interpol', 'freeze', 'Jackie', 'physicality', 'as', 'amazing', 'ever', 'best', 'sequence', 'here', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'pursuit', 'lanky', 'particularly', 'agile', 'henchman', 'thru', 'streets', 'Dublin', 'When', 'Jackie', 'effortlessly', 'tall', 'gated', 'wall', 'whew', 'MEDALLION', 'again', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'picture', ""n't"", 'fare', 'too', 'well', 'CGI', 'Jackie', 'walking', 'breathing', 'special', 'effects', 'Jackie', 'performed', 'own', 'death-defying', 'stunts', 'so', 'long', 'outside', 'embellishments', 'just', 'superfluous', 'really', 'cheating', 'As', 'far', 'role', 'film', 'thought', 'Eddie', 'Yang', 'was', 'handling', 'business', 'pretty', 'well', 'gained', 'super', 'powers', 'okay', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'drowning', 'death', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'fantastic', 'action', 'wise', 'Afterwards', 'CG', 'stuff', 'bit', 'much', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'natural', 'self', 'hard', 'chap', 'kill', 'having', 'super', 'powers', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fair.Claire', 'Forlani', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'achieve', 'sort', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'romance', 'more', 'lukewarm', 'anything', 'Chan', 'better', 'chemistry', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'even', 'Evans', 'stabs', 'experimentally', 'billion', 'times', 'one', 'scene', 'things', 'look', 'forward', 'Forlani', 'maybe', 'double', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'wife', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'character', 'up', 'surprising', 'ever', 'stay', 'tuned', 'blooper', 'reel', 'closing', 'credits.I', 'mentioned', 'occasionally', 'enjoyed', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'humor', 'bit', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'Mostly', 'comedy', 'MEDALLION', 'pretty', 'painful', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'villain', 'invoke', 'same', 'sinister', 'presence', 'brought', 'WARLOCK', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'feeling', 'showdowns', 'Jackie', 'MEDALLION', 'look', 'Jackie', 'being', 'Jackie', 'first', 'half', 'Ironically', 'when', 'Jackie', 'sinks', 'drowns', 'halfway', 'thru', 'then', 'resurrected', 'really', 'point', 'movie', 'really', 'capsize']",The Medallion

Note that despite seeming like a Hollywood film it is actually a Hong Kong film shot in Hong Kong, Thailand and Ireland. I've been debating as to whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars but I've chosen to go with 4 stars. The film itself has pretty average action and comedy, but the idea that this movie is really aiming to be something great appeals to me. The outtakes at the end of the film are also very funny.The DVD has a very straight laced audio commentary- not that much fun but nonetheless informative. It also features a wide array of deleted scenes. I'm kinda glad the deleted scenes didn't make it into the film.

Although he is an excellent actor, his choice of some roles dod not help his career.(Remember he has Mercy and Boxing Helena to his name!!)One refreshing aspect of the film was the choice of Dublin as the setting for the action,instead of London, Paris or Prague that international/American directors mainly choose for any European based plots.So Medallion is not a film that will blow you away,but it has Jackie Chan doing very well what he does and knows best,it has the angelic Forlani, and action that will keep you entertained throughout its 84 minutes.Not Bad.",3,Flying Jackie,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,1893,"['Medallion', 'return', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cinema', 'roots', 'style..sort', 'of..Veteran', 'martial', 'arts', 'HK', 'director', 'Gordon', 'Chan', 'first', 'international/English', 'language', 'film', 'manages', 'add', 'lot', 'action', 'gave', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'films', 'cult', 'status', 'enjoyed', 'world', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'fights', 'stunts', 'so', 'much', 'jumping', 'flying', 'off', 'walls', 'literarly', 'will', 'make', 'Spiderman', 'watch', 'envy.And', 'course', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'being', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'add', 'unique', 'comic', 'style', 'almost', 'scene', 'in.The', 'universal', 'appeal', 'Chan', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'actor', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'viewers', 'films', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'indeed', 'script', 'Medallion', 'pretty', 'lame', 'usual', 'good', 'vs', 'psycho', 'evil', 'who', 'destroy/control', 'world', 'added', 'Chinese', 'myths', 'mould', 'Helping', 'Chan', 'fight', 'evil', 'highly', 'talented', 'Brit', 'stand', 'up', 'comedian', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'who', 'slowly', 'making', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'success', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'competent', 'job', 'Chan', 'love', 'interest', 'side', 'kick.Evil', 'portrayed', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'who', 'ok', 'job', 'excellent', 'actor', 'choice', 'roles', 'dod', 'not', 'help', 'career', 'Remember', 'Mercy', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'name', 'One', 'refreshing', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'choice', 'Dublin', 'setting', 'action', 'instead', 'London', 'Paris', 'Prague', 'international/American', 'directors', 'mainly', 'choose', 'European', 'based', 'plots.So', 'Medallion', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'knows', 'best', 'angelic', 'Forlani', 'action', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', '84', 'minutes.Not', 'Bad']",The Medallion

It is too bad that Jackie had to be part of this movie.  The story is about Jackie trying to save some kid.  It felt a lot like Eddie Murphy's 'Golden Child' and I think they actually call the kid the golden child in this movie.  So basically they didn't seem to have a story for this and wrote it as they went along like most Hong Kong movies.  Except this is an American movie, or I guess I will say that it is an English speaking movie.  Jackie saves the kid and dies.  Don't worry, he comes back to life by the golden child and because of this medallion.  Now while the action wasn't great it wasn't too bad.  There were a couple of brief fights that were good but once Jackie is brought back to life he is superhuman and the action just looks ridiculous form there on.  Before he dies and has normal fights the action is the best but the wirework still bugs the crap out of me.  When somebody gets hit with an uppercut, do they really need to be lifted off of their feet?  The wirework makes people look like Spiderman most of the time.  It just doesn't work.I wish I could say the action was the only thing I had a little bit of a problem with.  The acting is very bad and the comedy only works a few times.  The movie is nice to look at but it is very doubtful you will ever watch this again.  I would be going on for many pages if I named all that is wrong with this movie.  Then again, it could have just been the outtakes Jackie does at the end of every movie that made me think that I actually enjoyed this somewhat.Now you are probably saying-Morgoth, you just gave a review for a 1 star movie!  Why did you rate it a 3?!?!?!?  Well, I will tell you.  Like I said, Jackie looks great.  The action is done by his big brother Sammo Hung.  While the movie around Jackie is amazingly bad, he is still very good in it.  Now that only explains why I would give it a 2.  The 3rd star goes to Christy Chung.  While her part in the movie was WAAAYYYYY too brief, she is the most amazing woman I have ever set my eyes on and she kick some serious butt!  So she slightly pushes this to a 3.  Any movie with Lily-Li, Brigitte Lin, or Christy Chung makes it a must have for me.The DVD is nicely presented.  Executive producer and editor commentary.  They mainly just talk about how great the movie is and they are glad it turned out so well.  I guess I just didn't see that.

782315,A17KCWWEHBJCJX,B0000SX9N2,neon rebel,"[1, 2]","Boy is this thing one of the worst films I have ever seen. I know and accept that a Jackie Chan movie doesn't care much about its story or characters, and using only a thin plot as an excuse to showcase his near superhuman acrobatic and comedic combat skills. However, this film, especially in the early going, is so lifeless and unexciting that it nearly resembles a funeral procession. There is none of that patented Jackie Chan energy and joy anywhere to be found, and he seems to be just going through the motions of movie making. It can't even work as a background distraction and merely annoys with its complete blandness. Worst of all none of the stuntworks were choreographed or filmed with even an ounce of creativity, and simply relegates Jackie to scale tall objects of various types. This is where an infantile script and failed comedy bits come together to murder the film. It's so bad I actually developed chest pains watching it, and I can't say that about too many films.

Jackie can do anything, climb up walls in less than 5 seconds, stop international threats, and the like.  But something that Jackie can not do is lead in a romance movie.  It was just so bad, watching him play the romantic, and the girl was such a bad actress, it was painful to watch.Don't get me started on the side-kick, he and Jackie just didn't have the chemistry that the other guy and Jackie had in 'Shanghi Noon' and 'Shanghi Knights'.  The plot line was weird, it's as if the directors are running out of reasons why Jackie continues to kick... in movies.I thought that it would be cool to see Jackie catch bullets, and destroy car doors, but even that didn't save the movie.  They didn't even show the bullet-catching scene in the movie!! It was only in the trailer!!If you watch this movie and come out thinking this was his 'best', i weep for you.  For all the others who can see a bad movie a mile away, steer clear of this.

782318,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0000SX9N2,Ping Lim,"[0, 3]","If viewers have read Jackie Chan's autobiography before, you would know that the main reason why he went to Hollywood is to be able to continue filming as his body wouldn't keep up with the stunts anymore.  Some of the stunts here were done in his old movies before (that is before he went international) &amp; truth to be told, there isn't much new stunts to be seen here.  The premise of this movie is promising enough with actors such as John Rhys Davies (from Indiana Jones trilogy &amp; Lord of the Rings fame), Julian Sand (Warlock), Claire Florani (Meet Joe Black, Mystery Men), Lee Evans (Mouse Trap), &amp; even Asian stars such as Connie Chung (still in her best physical form after giving birth to a child).  However, the script let this movie down big time as it's SO predictable &amp; I'm sure that a child would have figured out the ending even before it finishes.  In order to appeal to a wider audience, Hollywood tends to pair Jackie with another actor &amp; in this instance, Lee Evans who uses Charlie Chaplin's slapstick movements in contrast with Tucker's loud mouth's persona.  The whole movie has been too formulaic &amp; one can notice the rigidity between the actors &amp; actresses.  I find it an utter disappointment.  I honestly think that this is more or less a B-movie &amp; to have it endorsed by Tri-star is quite unbelievable.  I would believe it if &quot;The Medallion&quot; comes from Hong Kong but I'm dead certain that standards of movie-making in Hollywood has upped quite considerably since offering such as &quot;Matrix&quot; &amp; &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogies.  Either I have too high of an expectation or that Jackie is trapped in his time capsule that audience has moved on since his hype in the 80's.  I still enjoy Jackie Chan's earlier movies than this.  Nowadays, he resorts too much to artificial slings &amp; artificial effects to give him deft moves that he used to take for granted years ago.

It was made by Golden Port, an HK company, but Columbia Tristar bought the rights to this film in every country except HK and France, and cut the original 108 minute movie down to 88 minutes (even though when you watch it, it'll seem like forever). The original plot was supposed to be about a man named Snakehead who smuggled Asian immigrants into other countries, leaving few survivors. The medallion he is after resurrects people and gives them supernatural powers, turning them into ""highbinders"" (""Highbinders"" was the working title of the movie). But, Columbia Tristar cut a lot of the plot out and just made the focus of the film on the medallion only.

782325,A123FC8GL7US1O,B0000SX9N2,Troy,"[0, 0]","First off i would have given it a 3.5Jackie Chan is almost 50, and still lithe as a cat scaling a wall. Nevertheless, it is clear in The Medallion that he is not the miraculous whirlwind he once was.His fight scenes and chases, while still choreographed with balletic ingenuity, tend to highlight earth-bound skills - like that wall-climbing trick he still executes so effortlessly.More tellingly, he submits at long last to the dominion of special effects.Particularly in the second half of the movie, he sails through the air in fanciful style, propelled by wires and computer-generated illusions.There is nothing inherently wrong with that, and heaven knows no other action star at work today has shown Chan's uncanny stamina. The guy deserves a break.Still, the high-flying digital tricks signal the end of the pure-Jackie era of no stunt doubles, no wires and no computer effects.Old-schoolers may mourn, but action stars like to show they are more than fists and feet, so why not the Chan Man himself?As if to underscore the transition to a new style, The Medallion also gives Chan a reasonable facsimile of a romance, not to mention his first serious on-screen kiss.Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black) does an able job as Nicole James, an Interpol officer who reconnects with Hong Kong inspector Eddie Yang (Chan) when he goes to Ireland looking for a kidnapped child.It seems the little boy was born to fulfill an ancient Buddhist prophecy about supernatural powers - including life and death - to be had with a certain magical medallion.Naturally, a megalomaniacal bad guy - with the wickedly lurid name of Snakehead (Julian Sands) - has gotten wind of the prophecy and means to have the medallion for himself.In the opening scenes, Eddie rescues the boy from a burning room shortly after sharing his octopus dinner with a street-side dog. (Nobody ever accused the Hong Kong action-movie community of excessive subtlety.) For the rest of the movie, he performs variations of the same feat, as the kid changes hands several times.At one point, Eddie even appears to be stone-cold dead, but having bonded with the life-and-death kid, he gets to come back. His rebirth bonus is virtual immortality. He can feel pain but doesn't bleed when injured - as demonstrated in a funny scene when he is stabbed repeatedly by an incredulous crony.That crony is another Interpol agent called Watson, played by the British slapstick comic Lee Evans (Mouse Hunt), who is sometimes charmingly clumsy and sometimes cloying and overbroad.Aside from such tone-deaf lapses, director Gordon Chan, who shares writing credit with four others, observes the conventions of the Jackie Chan style while adding a layer of high-tech polish to the proceedings.The movie's action scenes are choreographed by Chan's childhood friend Sammo Hung, the veteran Hong Kong director and actor best known in the United States from his stint on the TV series Martial Law.Hung's playful take on martial-arts style perfectly matches Chan's own comic bent; together they pack more wit into a simple chase than most action movies do into their most elaborate showdowns.It is that wit that is the sorriest loss in the turn to special effects. Anybody can fly with a green screen and wires, but it takes a creative mind to figure out a way for one little guy to whomp a roomful of opponents all by himself.",4,Pretty good job,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,3362,"['First', 'off', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'given', '3.5Jackie', 'Chan', 'almost', '50', 'still', 'lithe', 'cat', 'scaling', 'wall', 'Nevertheless', 'clear', 'Medallion', 'not', 'miraculous', 'whirlwind', 'once', 'was.His', 'fight', 'scenes', 'chases', 'still', 'choreographed', 'balletic', 'ingenuity', 'tend', 'highlight', 'earth-bound', 'skills', 'wall-climbing', 'trick', 'still', 'so', 'effortlessly.More', 'tellingly', 'long', 'last', 'dominion', 'special', 'effects.Particularly', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'air', 'fanciful', 'style', 'propelled', 'wires', 'computer-generated', 'illusions.There', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'heaven', 'other', 'action', 'star', 'work', 'today', 'shown', 'Chan', 'uncanny', 'stamina', 'guy', 'break.Still', 'high-flying', 'digital', 'tricks', 'signal', 'end', 'pure-Jackie', 'era', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'wires', 'computer', 'effects.Old-schoolers', 'may', 'mourn', 'action', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'fists', 'feet', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Chan', 'Man', 'underscore', 'transition', 'new', 'style', 'Medallion', 'also', 'Chan', 'reasonable', 'facsimile', 'romance', 'not', 'mention', 'first', 'serious', 'on-screen', 'kiss.Claire', 'Forlani', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'able', 'job', 'Nicole', 'James', 'Interpol', 'officer', 'who', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'inspector', 'Eddie', 'Yang', 'Chan', 'when', 'Ireland', 'looking', 'kidnapped', 'child.It', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'born', 'fulfill', 'ancient', 'Buddhist', 'prophecy', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'including', 'life', 'death', 'be', 'had', 'certain', 'magical', 'medallion.Naturally', 'megalomaniacal', 'bad', 'guy', 'wickedly', 'lurid', 'name', 'Snakehead', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'gotten', 'prophecy', 'have', 'medallion', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Eddie', 'boy', 'burning', 'room', 'shortly', 'sharing', 'octopus', 'dinner', 'street-side', 'dog', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'accused', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action-movie', 'community', 'excessive', 'subtlety', 'rest', 'movie', 'variations', 'same', 'feat', 'kid', 'several', 'one', 'point', 'Eddie', 'even', 'be', 'stone-cold', 'dead', 'having', 'bonded', 'life-and-death', 'kid', 'come', 'back', 'rebirth', 'bonus', 'virtual', 'immortality', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', ""n't"", 'bleed', 'when', 'injured', 'demonstrated', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'stabbed', 'repeatedly', 'incredulous', 'crony.That', 'crony', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'called', 'Watson', 'played', 'British', 'slapstick', 'comic', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'Mouse', 'Hunt', 'who', 'sometimes', 'charmingly', 'clumsy', 'sometimes', 'cloying', 'overbroad.Aside', 'such', 'tone-deaf', 'lapses', 'director', 'Gordon', 'Chan', 'who', 'shares', 'writing', 'credit', 'four', 'others', 'conventions', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'style', 'adding', 'layer', 'high-tech', 'polish', 'proceedings.The', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'choreographed', 'Chan', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'veteran', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'director', 'actor', 'best', 'known', 'United', 'States', 'stint', 'TV', 'series', 'Martial', 'Law.Hung', 'playful', 'take', 'martial-arts', 'style', 'perfectly', 'Chan', 'own', 'comic', 'bent', 'together', 'pack', 'more', 'wit', 'simple', 'chase', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'do', 'most', 'elaborate', 'showdowns.It', 'wit', 'sorriest', 'loss', 'turn', 'special', 'effects', 'Anybody', 'can', 'fly', 'green', 'screen', 'wires', 'creative', 'mind', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'one', 'little', 'guy', 'whomp', 'roomful', 'opponents']",The Medallion

Yes, the plot about the big medal is silly at best.  The jokes are corny (sure), and the CGI-enhanced actions are not clearly the best of Jackie Chan (who is 50 years old, but doesn't look like that).

You can sidestep the story (for which five names credited!) about the magical golden medallion, and the thug who wants it (Julian Sands), and the buddies who chase him (Chan and delightful Lee Evans).  After a botched police raid in Hong Kong, we see Chan's character Eddie landed in Dublin (but why Dublin?  DON'T THINK!).  Eddie meets Nicole (Claire Forlani, so beautiful) in the office, and the latter slaps him in the face for no other reason than to show her 'I love you but you treat me bad' attitude.  Don't say it's corny, just have fun (or pretend that you didn't see).And the actions start.  They are choreographed by legendary figure Sammo Hung Kam-Bo, who worked with Jackie many times before.  The stunts are adequate, just good, but the use of wire is sometimes glaringly obvious while Jackie's movement itself is still agile.  Still while watching it, I remembered his death-defying stunt in &quot;Rumbles in Bronx&quot; in which Jackie literally jumped from the top of the building to the terrace of the next one.  It was a superhuman feat, and he said that he didn't use wire because it made the movements unnnatural.  Sorry, but Jackie, the same thing is happening here now.The supports are surprisingly good (I mean, compared with noisy Chris Tucker in the two &quot;Rush Hour&quot;s), and surely high-kicking Clair Forlani looks great.  I don't say she is as great as  Jennifer in the TV series &quot;Alias,&quot; but still far better than another Jennifer in &quot;The Tuxedo.&quot;  And she is incredibly amiable and charming in the end credit outtakes.Far from his best, and still not his worst, &quot;The Medallion&quot; is strictly for Jackie Chan's avid fans.  Do not make this your starting point for watching the Jackie films, though.",3,(At Best 3 Stars) Too Many Jokes: Strictly For His Fans:,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,2399,"['OK', 'let', 'face', 'quot', 'Medallion', 'quot', 'basically', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'directed', 'Gordon', 'Chan', 'disappointment', 'many', 'fans', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'Yes', 'plot', 'big', 'medal', 'silly', 'best', 'jokes', 'are', 'corny', 'sure', 'CGI-enhanced', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'best', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'who', '50', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'roots', 'Jackie', 'made', 'better', 'films', 'quot', 'Who', 'Am', 'quot', 'quot', 'Project', 'A', 'quot', 'several', 'quot', 'Police', 'Story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Medallion', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fan', 'can', 'sidestep', 'story', 'five', 'names', 'credited', 'magical', 'golden', 'medallion', 'thug', 'who', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'buddies', 'who', 'chase', 'Chan', 'delightful', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'botched', 'police', 'raid', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'see', 'Chan', 'character', 'Eddie', 'landed', 'Dublin', 'why', 'Dublin', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THINK', 'Eddie', 'meets', 'Nicole', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'so', 'beautiful', 'office', 'latter', 'slaps', 'face', 'other', 'reason', 'show', 'love', 'treat', 'bad', 'attitude', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'corny', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '.And', 'actions', 'start', 'are', 'choreographed', 'legendary', 'figure', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'Kam-Bo', 'who', 'worked', 'Jackie', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'stunts', 'are', 'adequate', 'just', 'good', 'use', 'wire', 'sometimes', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'Jackie', 'movement', 'still', 'agile', 'Still', 'watching', 'remembered', 'death-defying', 'stunt', 'quot', 'Rumbles', 'Bronx', 'quot', 'Jackie', 'literally', 'jumped', 'top', 'building', 'terrace', 'next', 'one', 'was', 'superhuman', 'feat', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'wire', 'made', 'movements', 'unnnatural', 'Sorry', 'Jackie', 'same', 'thing', 'happening', 'here', 'now.The', 'supports', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'mean', 'compared', 'noisy', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'two', 'quot', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'quot', 's', 'surely', 'high-kicking', 'Clair', 'Forlani', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'as', 'great', 'Jennifer', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'still', 'far', 'better', 'Jennifer', 'quot', 'Tuxedo.', 'quot', 'incredibly', 'amiable', 'charming', 'end', 'credit', 'outtakes.Far', 'best', 'still', 'not', 'worst', 'quot', 'Medallion', 'quot', 'strictly', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'avid', 'fans', 'Do', 'not', 'make', 'starting', 'point', 'watching', 'Jackie', 'films', 'though']",The Medallion
