1298237,AGJOT85DZDKOV,B002XTBE6U,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I first ordered just Season 8 of JAG solely to get the pilot episodes for NCIS. I absolutely love the show NCIS and had already ordered all available seasons (1-6) of that show. So I get season 8 of JAG to get the pilot for NCIS and fell in love with JAG as well.I ordered this complete series set and started at the beginning and soon found that I couldn't quit watching the episodes. The series is more addictive than chocolate -- and that's saying something! I am currently on season 6 (out of 10) and find myself wishing that they had made at least 10 more seasons of JAG. The hours spent watching these shows are wonderful. I feel that Mac, Harm, Admiral Chegwidden, Bud, Harriet, Yeoman Tynner, and all the rest are part of the family now. I can't wait to see Mac get rid of Mick, however!The purchase and delivery itself were standard Amazon -- sterling quality and service! The product came exactly as promised and very quickly! I love Amazon.com and wish everything I order online was of similar quality and service...Now...if only I could find another product that could give me the wonderful hours I am enjoying with JAG (and NCIS).And the icing on the cake with JAG is that you can sit and watch episode after episode without having to worry about its appropriateness for all ages.

The air force does not build custom 12 million dollar craft to fit their pilots. Finding a female partner he would not dwarf proved a problem despite a succession of two actresses in the part. Although the series is built around Harmon Rabb Jr. it stuck for 10 seasons on the strength of well-written parts for an ensemble cast. Throughout the producers enjoyed the co-operation of the military as shown in the opening credits of each show when a sub does an emergency blow literally jumping out of the ocean.The series alternates between courtroom scenes, investigations in far-flung locations on land and sea, and on aircraft piloted by Rabb and others. One of the ongoing sidebars continued to be Rabb's search for Rabb Sr MIA during the Viet Nam War. Whereas Rabb's methods can be unorthodox, he even discharged a weapon in court, a black lawyer, Sturgis Turner is ramrod straight and by the book. The rolly polly Bud Roberts comes on board for comic relief but hangs around to become a serious contender in court.This series displays a sufficiently changing mix of styles to keep it fresh and interesting.

JAG had it all:  action, adventure, drama, mystery, intrigue, suspense, romance, and even an occasional touch of comedy and soap opera.  This COMPLETE set includes all 227 episodes including the final 1st season NBC episode ""Skeleton Crew"" which was NEVER originally aired, but was largely included with a different ending as a ""flashback"" in the 3rd (2nd CBS) season episode ""Death Watch"", A viewing will quickly make it apparent why, as does the bonus ""making of --"" feature.  Both the video and audio quality of this set is excellent, with original formats (4X3 in the first 4 seasons and 16X9 thereafter) preserved.  If I have any negative criticism at all it would be the packaging, which is simply all 10 individual seasons with their individual season boxes (usually 4 disks per season). I think that now that all seasons are available that they could have done a bit better with the packaging.  At any rate, I you love good TV, get JAG.
