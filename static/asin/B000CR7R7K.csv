This film for the most part is really well done with a great cast and dialogue. It sticks to the theme in the title and most of it is very blue, although Dorian's shirt is definitely fuchsia!Early in the film where Nicky is smoking a cigar, is way out of place and just should not have been there, and one of the final scenes when Dorian is suddenly a cigarette smoker just didn't look right. The character of Dorian is a bit of a loser, but he is not that much of a loser!

961283,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B000CR7R7K,Blake Fraina,"[42, 45]","For me the two main essentials that can make or break a film are first, the actors and, a close second, the writing. I'm happy to report DORIAN BLUES has the finest of both, in spades.The cast, even down to the smallest roles, is uniformly excellent. A pleasant surprise when so often the acting in indie/low budget films is appalling, leaving one to assume that the director cast all his friends regardless of their lack of talent.Michael McMillian as Dorian, is completely winning. Sort of Topher Grace-ish. Kinda cute but not distractingly so. Not in the least effeminate or outrageously quirky, yet still convincing as a gay character who sees himself as a misfit. He pulls off quite a few terrific comic moments but handles the dramatic stuff fairly admirably as well. And Lea Coco as Nick, his handsome jock brother, is an absolute revelation. Everyone - the boys' parents (particularly the thankless role of the father - a right wing conservative bully), Dorian's college friends, an understanding stripper, a wise therapist - all wonderful.The storyline is completely unique for a coming out film, primarily because it's so much more than that. This is not a film about a teen learning to accept his homosexuality (which he does, fairly early on, and without too much fanfare). It is not about a virgin's quest for his first sexual experience (which is dispatched quickly, humourously...and off camera). And it's not about his achieving the acceptance or respect of his father (which he does not). It's about a young man coming to terms with the fact that he has turned out bitter, mean, sarcastic and angry - just like his father, whom he despises. The writing sparkles with wit and originality. There was nary a cringe-worthy moment in the dialogue where I was left thinking, ""But people don't actually say things like that."" It all sounded intelligent and natural.Additionally, the film managed to buck several big gay film cliches and was emotionally richer for it. In particular, the relationship between the brothers, Dorian and Nick, was unbelievably well done. Nick is the first one Dorian comes out to and he accepts him fairly quickly yet with a realistic amount of reserve - considering he's only a high school junior, and a popular athlete at that. Their loving, supportive, occasionally combative, relationship is one of the finest (and refreshingly cliche-free) depictions of two brothers (straight, gay or otherwise) that I have ever seen on film. I don't want to go into a huge amount of detail but I think the folks who write for some of the more strident, polemical LGBT TV shows could learn alot from Tennyson Bardwell, the writer/director of this lovely, funny and moving little film.",5,Totally Original and Cliche Free Coming Out Tale,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,2712,"['two', 'main', 'essentials', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'actors', 'close', 'second', 'writing', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'DORIAN', 'BLUES', 'finest', 'spades.The', 'cast', 'even', 'down', 'smallest', 'roles', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'when', 'so', 'often', 'acting', 'indie/low', 'budget', 'films', 'appalling', 'leaving', 'one', 'assume', 'director', 'cast', 'friends', 'regardless', 'lack', 'talent.Michael', 'McMillian', 'Dorian', 'completely', 'winning', 'Sort', 'Topher', 'Grace-ish', 'Kinda', 'cute', 'not', 'distractingly', 'so', 'Not', 'least', 'effeminate', 'outrageously', 'quirky', 'yet', 'still', 'convincing', 'gay', 'character', 'who', 'misfit', 'quite', 'few', 'terrific', 'comic', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'stuff', 'fairly', 'admirably', 'as', 'well', 'Lea', 'Coco', 'Nick', 'handsome', 'jock', 'brother', 'absolute', 'revelation', 'Everyone', 'boys', 'parents', 'particularly', 'thankless', 'role', 'father', 'right', 'wing', 'conservative', 'bully', 'Dorian', 'college', 'friends', 'understanding', 'stripper', 'wise', 'therapist', 'wonderful.The', 'storyline', 'completely', 'unique', 'coming', 'out', 'film', 'primarily', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'film', 'teen', 'learning', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'fairly', 'early', 'too', 'much', 'fanfare', 'not', 'virgin', 'quest', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'dispatched', 'quickly', 'humourously', 'camera', 'not', 'achieving', 'acceptance', 'respect', 'father', 'not', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'turned', 'out', 'bitter', 'mean', 'sarcastic', 'angry', 'just', 'father', 'whom', 'writing', 'sparkles', 'wit', 'originality', 'was', 'nary', 'cringe-worthy', 'moment', 'dialogue', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'say', 'things', 'sounded', 'intelligent', 'natural.Additionally', 'film', 'managed', 'buck', 'several', 'big', 'gay', 'film', 'cliches', 'was', 'emotionally', 'richer', 'particular', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'Dorian', 'Nick', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'well', 'done', 'Nick', 'first', 'one', 'Dorian', 'out', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'yet', 'realistic', 'amount', 'reserve', 'considering', 'only', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'popular', 'athlete', 'loving', 'supportive', 'occasionally', 'combative', 'relationship', 'one', 'finest', 'refreshingly', 'cliche-free', 'depictions', 'two', 'brothers', 'straight', 'gay', 'otherwise', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'huge', 'amount', 'detail', 'think', 'folks', 'who', 'write', 'more', 'strident', 'polemical', 'LGBT', 'TV', 'shows', 'could', 'learn', 'alot', 'Tennyson', 'Bardwell', 'writer/director', 'lovely', 'funny', 'moving', 'little', 'film']",Dorian Blues

961286,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000CR7R7K,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[3, 6]","This is a great movie. I don't want to overstate my review and raise expectations beyond reach, but this film is a gem in ""coming out"" films. It introduces two very hot young actors, Michael McMillian and Lee Coco. Both give outstanding performances in their roles. I was deeply impressed with their level of professional acting abilities. So realistic, as are the portrayals of the typical middle class family who are trying to deal with accepting a gay son. The plot is awesome. (never use the word ""fabulous"", it sounds too gay, try saying ""awesome""...... quote from movie). I found myself very much relating to this family, and my own ""coming to terms"" with my sexual identity. There are a couple spots where I felt the mothers character was a little overdone, and the dad's as well, though both actors were very good in their roles. There is a nice mix with reality, and fantasy. Reality in the depiction of the classic family, and the harsh struggles of being gay, fantasy in respect to the brother/brother relationship, and every gay guys dream of having that kind of relationship with his VERY attractive brother. Brothers who are also the best of friends is a very nice touch for this film. It is also refreshing to see a film where the YOUNGER brother is the one looking out for the OLDER. Nice twist. The quality of ""Dorian Blues"" was very very good all the way around. I have read the reviews of other reviewers who try too much to imitate Siskel and Ebert, or overdue their ""intellectual"" image. Ignore them, if you are a typical person viewing this film for entertainment instead of flattering yourself with your ""critic persona"", you will like this film. One of the all time favorite ""coming out"" or ""coming of age"" films I've seen. Very dramatic, very realistic, and very easy to relate to if you yourself have ever struggled with you own sexual identity. In all fairness however, I did have one beef with this one. That is the mixture of sexual identity and politics. I would like to see film makers get away from this and accept the fact the gay people come from every political spectrum. It is not so one-sided, as they like to depict. Other than that, I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy it as I did. Be sure to watch to the DVD extras which include a couple deleted scenes and a few good trailers.",5,"An ""AWESOME"" presentation........

961287,A2E0TJ49NACDBA,B000CR7R7K,DelusionalAngel,"[0, 0]","Dorian has a problem.  He realizes he's gay and isn't sure he wants to be.  He does have a supportive brother, so there's that.  He's discovered a counselor - a gay one that assures him he's fine.  But Dorian wants kids.  So there's church and the Bible.  That'll fix him.  Or the stripper will.Or maybe there's just reality.  The reality that he didn't have a choice.  He is who and what he is.  There's the reality that he has to tell his dad because he isn't hiding anymore.  Of course Dad is old school (this takes place in the 70s) - think Archie Bunker meets Red Foreman of That 70s Show.  Dad sees Dorian as the lesser son already.  He's not athletic like his brother.  He once dared to question his dad's political tirades.  Dorian has a poster of JFK in his room.  He's clearly a moron.  Dad is always right.  Dad knows being gay is a choice and an immoral one at that.  Dorian pretty much hated his father before he knew he even realized that he was gay.  His mother is spacey and oblivious.  But Dorian is about to head off to NYU, to the best city in the world, especially for a boy like him.  So hey, even if telling dad goes as bad as he expects it will, who cares?  The time is now.But sometimes life doesn't go how you expect it to.  Well, except for telling dad.  That is, of course, a disaster.Not really a comedy.  Not really a drama.  Much like real life, it's a tad of everything.  Having watched friends in my lifetime have to drop out of school over similar situations, feeling as though they have to move, etc this one hits a bit close to home.  It's not really a ""gay story"" though I can see the anti-gay folk not appreciating this movie.  It is more about being who you are, trying to find yourself, family problems, life in general.  Dorian's issues in life just happened to stem from the fact that he is gay and wanted so desperately to find acceptance from others (especially his dad).  So while yes, it hits home to those of us who love people who have gone through this and yes I realize I am sort of contradicting myself here - it is definitely a movie for people who care about gay issues but it's also totally NOT about that at the same time and if you're someone who is willing to just accept gay and straight characters both then it's really just a life story that anyone who has been a little lost could relate to.",5,You can't be straight if you're a chicken....,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2351,"['Dorian', 'problem', 'gay', ""n't"", 'sure', 'be', 'have', 'supportive', 'brother', 'discovered', 'counselor', 'gay', 'one', 'fine', 'Dorian', 'kids', 'church', 'Bible', ""'ll"", 'fix', 'stripper', 'will.Or', 'maybe', 'just', 'reality', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'who', 'what', 'reality', 'tell', 'dad', ""n't"", 'hiding', 'anymore', 'course', 'Dad', 'old', 'school', 'place', '70s', 'think', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'meets', 'Red', 'Foreman', '70s', 'Show', 'Dad', 'Dorian', 'lesser', 'son', 'already', 'not', 'athletic', 'brother', 'once', 'dared', 'question', 'dad', 'political', 'tirades', 'Dorian', 'poster', 'JFK', 'room', 'clearly', 'moron', 'Dad', 'always', 'right', 'Dad', 'being', 'gay', 'choice', 'immoral', 'one', 'Dorian', 'pretty', 'much', 'hated', 'father', 'knew', 'even', 'realized', 'was', 'gay', 'mother', 'spacey', 'oblivious', 'Dorian', 'head', 'off', 'NYU', 'best', 'city', 'world', 'especially', 'boy', 'So', 'hey', 'even', 'telling', 'dad', 'as', 'bad', 'will', 'who', 'time', 'now.But', 'sometimes', 'life', ""n't"", 'go', 'how', 'expect', 'Well', 'telling', 'dad', 'course', 'disaster.Not', 'really', 'comedy', 'Not', 'really', 'drama', 'Much', 'real', 'life', 'tad', 'everything', 'Having', 'watched', 'friends', 'lifetime', 'have', 'drop', 'school', 'similar', 'situations', 'feeling', 'have', 'move', 'etc', 'one', 'bit', 'close', 'home', 'not', 'really', 'gay', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'anti-gay', 'folk', 'not', 'appreciating', 'movie', 'more', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'family', 'problems', 'life', 'general', 'Dorian', 'issues', 'life', 'just', 'happened', 'stem', 'fact', 'gay', 'wanted', 'so', 'desperately', 'find', 'acceptance', 'others', 'especially', 'dad', 'So', 'yes', 'home', 'who', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'yes', 'realize', 'am', 'sort', 'contradicting', 'here', 'definitely', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'gay', 'issues', 'also', 'totally', 'NOT', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'willing', 'just', 'accept', 'gay', 'straight', 'characters', 'then', 'really', 'just', 'life', 'story', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'little', 'lost', 'could', 'relate']",Dorian Blues

Dorian has a homophobic doctrinaire father, a housewife mother with a spiked mullet who is dominated by her husband, and an all-star athlete brother. Dorian is not athletic, likes fashion, wears fuscia shirts, and he's.... Being baled out by your younger brother may save your hide but does nothing for your ego.Due to the restrictions placed on child actors most high school parts are played by adults. Michael McMillian was 25 when he played Dorian. Lea Coco who played his younger brother was a year older. The movie has humour and pathos.

961292,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CR7R7K,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Writer/director/producer Tennyson Bardwell is definitely a talent to watch.  In his first venture into film, DORIAN BLUES, he has created an intelligent script with razor sharp dialogue, witty and acerbic and touching depending on the moment, and has cast his film with a fine groups of actors who obviously hold him in great respect, as the final product is a polished film that is always entertaining as well as informative.  Few 'coming out' films flesh out the territory as succinctly and realistically as this.Dorian Lagatos (a fresh and talented Michael McMillian) is sour on the world that doesn't understand him.  His family is the microscope on his world: a right wing radical father Tom (Charles Fletcher), a seemingly ditsy but subservient mother Maria (Mo Quigley), and a brother Nicky (another bright and hunky talent Lea Coco) who is everything Dorian isn't - a jock, a ladies' man, and a happy-go-lucky high schooler. Dorian has an 'epiphany': he discovers the reason he doesn't fit in is that he is gay!  With his discovery he finds some solace from another edgy gay friend Spooky (Austin Basis) but still feels he must remain in the closet.  Finally he confides in Nicky who surprisingly listens to him and accepts him - just so long as Dorian doesn't act out. Frustrated, Dorian leaves for New York for college while Nicky wins a sports scholarship to another college.  In New York Dorian finds the gay life, feels 'normal' at last,  falls in love, confronts rejection and the games people play, and then lives a despondent life until Nicky visits him: Nicky has lost his scholarship.  The two brothers make the rounds of Dorian's milieu until they receive a phone call that their father has died.  Returning home Dorian must still face his anger at his father, though dead, and it is this anger that his mother (far more sensitive than Dorian ever knew) confronts Dorian and the message of the movie is completed in a very realistic and understanding way.  Life's philosophy is not wholly bound to one's sexual preferences.Michael McMillian and Lea Coco both give notice of being young gifted actors to watch. And the apparently 'film inexperienced' Charles Fletcher and Mo Quigley deliver radiant cameo roles.  Indeed the entire supporting cast is excellent, perhaps due to the fact the Bardwell is a fine director!  This is a gay coming out film that is intelligent, free of the usual visuals that distract the general audience, and one that has more healthy bits of psychology scattered throughout than many a feature film.Highly recommended.

I can't disagree with those points in the least, but do feel the need to express the following less than positive observations.No notable bettering in this film of 1998's very well done ""Edge of Seventeen."" One would think, seven or so years after that earlier production, the bar would have crept higher.While ""Dorian Blues"" does have lots of what I'll call 'cutesy' (the lead, himself, being particularly so), elsewhere there's definitely an 'OVERmuch' amount (film's first half) of:--A Dad who could be best described as a 'Mean Ole' one & A Mom who could essentially be labeled as 'Mummified' (Mom only comes into her own at film's end........as does Dad, for that matter / LOL).--A L'il Brother who enjoys the position of the ""Better-than"" son (even if he is presented as generally supportive of Dorian and possibly his best ally).Sadly, what there's an 'UNDERmuch' amount of is time spent on Dorian's New York City escapades (and I don't mean those with visiting brother-from-home.........well, this movie is supposed to be gay, for Pete's sake).At bout's end, ""Edge of Seventeen"" remains the winner.PS: Not much 7-years-progress evident to us in the on-screen romance department either: one very timid kiss.

It transcribes the average, delves into the real, and supports the actors in such a way as to make the movie an overwhelming emotional success. You laugh, you cry and you rage against the absurdity of how being 'gay' would influence relationships to the extent that it does. The inherent tragedy of Dorian's relationship with his father is made self evident throughout the movie, and as an observer you cannot help but feel the struggle within. The perversity of denial, and the horror of removing oneself from the life of your child, is by far the most ignorant, destructive and selfish decisions a parent can make. Yet Dorian emerges as a self assured, stable young man, determined to make his life a success.The movie could have been very dark, yet through the use of humor the writers have taken a subject as serious as any other, and communicated their message in manner which leaves the audience raw but enamored. The movie is beautifully written, and has an endemic intelligence which transcends many within the comedy genre. The acting is superb, although special mention must be made of the leadIf one judges a movie by the impact it has on you once you have left the theater, then this is one which will certainly inspire.

I actually felt a little offended that this character is confused and unsuccessful at everything ""because"" he is gay?  I didn't know it was a handicap.It moves along fairly well as the ill-conceived mini-skits pass along.  The film-maker barely makes an effort to tie them together.  And, in the end, everybody comes to their senses and has strength and wisdom that they have totally lacked throughout the whole movie, except one character, the totally unlikeable and one-dimensional father, dies.  You don't really feel that sad.The acting is generally passable and only occasionally reminds you of a high school play.

There are a lot of rich interconnections between the various characters that keep the story fairly tight and nicely compelling. Too many times we encounter far too many characters thrown into the narrative blender and the result is a lot of weak character development that ultimately hurts the story as well.The core conflict here is a common one among gay men, especially when their families do not appear to be 100% supportive of who they are. And as complex as such cases may be in reality, I think the movie managed to capture things decently well in a way that conveyed a lot of the hardships in a light and still entertaining manner without overwhelming the viewer with too much mental and emotional baggage. And not, the conflict was not just about Dorian and his father, but ultimately Dorian and his ability to accept the truth of who he is and what this may mean to other people.The brother angle was a nice one - a good transition between trying to fit in with the views of your peer group in terms of gender stereotypes but at the same time recognizing the importance of family. Nicky had his own share of dealing with this odd dichotomy to their shared lives and it was conveyed well enough in terms of both the writing and the actual acting performance.The movie ends on a bit of an abrupt note, but given how much had been invested in prior story development, I can understand how that was ultimately a safe enough place to end the story. I can't say that this is my favorite LGBT movie of all time - it certainly had its share of issues in terms of overall direction for scenes or even balancing the humor with the drama.At its core, Dorian Blues has a good story to tell - a story whose value comes from how real it feels and how close to home it can be for many gay men out there.

What's truly awesome about the humor and seriousness of this film is how these two opposing forces blend seamlessly.Every topic, every scene, every character is a well balanced blend of subtle humor and seriousness.  There are so many clever and surprising touches that make this film great.  One of my favorite scenes is when Dorian tells his mother he wants to talk and she replies ""Well, sit down and talk.""  Then she gets up and walks away.  Dorian is surprised by what his mother said(implies she will listen) and the viewer is surprised by the action of her walking away.Dorian and Nicky have a typical brother to brother relationship.  The interaction of the two after Dorian comes out is priceless.  Nicky is at once accepting and at other times acts like a typical jock.  The dancing scene with a school mate is hilarious.  The dancing scene with the stripper is touching.Steve Fletcher is great as the typically stern, unaccepting, close minded, Republican father.  Fletcher is a great actor who I've missed seeing since his days on One Life To Live.  The final irony of the film surrounds the death of the father.  The news that Dorian is gay didn't trigger an immediate heart attack....it was the news that Nicky lost his football scholarship that did it.  It is also very telling when Dorian and his father talk about AIDS.  This conversation cracks the father's hard and harsh facade and shows that he does care.The movie soundtrack is awesome too.Overall, this is one truly excellent film.

961311,A2817E4ZO8LJ0M,B000CR7R7K,Tom Chatt,"[15, 21]","Based on some of the online reviews I had read of Dorian Blues, we were really looking forward to seeing it. It had played last year at a number of gay and lesbian film festivals, and people who had seen it there had written some enthusiastic reviews. Written and directed by Tennyson Bardwell (his first outing, pardon the pun), this is a coming-out story, and the reviews promised that it was very fresh (even though the genre is, shall we say, already well trod). Well, now that we've seen the film ourselves, I have to wonder if those people who posted the great reviews were all just friends of the debutant director. Not that the movie was bad. It was okay. We were mildly amused and entertained, if not deeply moved or laughing volubly. It certainly had some good parts. Michael MacMillian, who plays the lead, is certainly a talented comic actor. (The physical comedy of Dorian at his therapist's office practicing coming out to his father using a mannequin was quite amusing.) And there was some potential in the material for some real exploration of family relationships, especially the unwitting influence of fathers and brothers. But we really only saw that in the last two minutes, which were very good, and maybe one or two other scattered glimpses. (Those last two minutes were bittersweet, in that they underscored what the film could have been, but wasn't.)The film was just very uneven, and I think the fundamental problem is that the director couldn't make up his mind what sort of film he wanted to make. Sometimes it was a misty sepia-toned semi-nostalgic attitude (think The Wonder Years), while other times it was sardonic and not taking itself seriously (think That 70's Show). There were moments of real emotion, but just when the audience might get engaged with the characters, the film careens to a detached comic tone that pushes us away emotionally. In much of the story, the characters are just cartoons walking from one clich&eacute; into another. There is a funny (and well-executed) scene when Dorian tries to talk to his mother, who is practically oblivious to him while claiming to listen. With a more skillful director, this could have fit well as an exaggerated subjective impression, being both funny and poignant at the same time, but Bardwell doesn't pull it off. (It's a difficult balance, but it can certainly be done well. I think of Jeffrey as an example that was laugh-out loud funny, mostly sardonic and detached, charicaturish, and yet at times quite emotional and ultimately engaging.) There's some good raw material, but an inconsistent vision and attitude make the movie fall short of what it could have been.",2,"Some good parts, but uneven direction makes it fall short",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2659,"['Based', 'online', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'Dorian', 'Blues', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'had', 'played', 'last', 'year', 'number', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'film', 'festivals', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'written', 'enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'Written', 'directed', 'Tennyson', 'Bardwell', 'first', 'outing', 'pardon', 'pun', 'coming-out', 'story', 'reviews', 'promised', 'was', 'very', 'fresh', 'even', 'genre', 'shall', 'say', 'already', 'well', 'trod', 'Well', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'wonder', 'people', 'who', 'posted', 'great', 'reviews', 'were', 'just', 'friends', 'debutant', 'director', 'Not', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'okay', 'were', 'mildly', 'amused', 'entertained', 'not', 'deeply', 'moved', 'laughing', 'volubly', 'certainly', 'had', 'good', 'parts', 'Michael', 'MacMillian', 'who', 'lead', 'certainly', 'talented', 'comic', 'actor', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Dorian', 'therapist', 'office', 'practicing', 'coming', 'out', 'father', 'using', 'mannequin', 'was', 'quite', 'amusing', 'was', 'potential', 'material', 'real', 'exploration', 'family', 'relationships', 'especially', 'unwitting', 'influence', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'really', 'only', 'saw', 'last', 'two', 'minutes', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'scattered', 'glimpses', 'last', 'two', 'minutes', 'were', 'bittersweet', 'underscored', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'uneven', 'think', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'sort', 'film', 'wanted', 'make', 'Sometimes', 'was', 'misty', 'sepia-toned', 'semi-nostalgic', 'attitude', 'think', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'sardonic', 'not', 'taking', 'seriously', 'think', '70', 'Show', 'were', 'moments', 'real', 'emotion', 'just', 'when', 'audience', 'might', 'get', 'engaged', 'characters', 'film', 'detached', 'comic', 'tone', 'away', 'emotionally', 'much', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'cartoons', 'walking', 'one', 'clich', 'eacute', 'funny', 'well-executed', 'scene', 'when', 'Dorian', 'tries', 'talk', 'mother', 'who', 'practically', 'oblivious', 'claiming', 'listen', 'more', 'skillful', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'well', 'exaggerated', 'subjective', 'impression', 'being', 'funny', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'Bardwell', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'difficult', 'balance', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'think', 'Jeffrey', 'example', 'was', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'funny', 'mostly', 'sardonic', 'detached', 'charicaturish', 'yet', 'times', 'quite', 'emotional', 'ultimately', 'engaging', 'good', 'raw', 'material', 'inconsistent', 'vision', 'attitude', 'make', 'movie', 'fall', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Dorian Blues
