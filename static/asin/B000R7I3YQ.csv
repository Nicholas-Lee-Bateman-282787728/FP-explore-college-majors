It's difficult, I think, to properly review a standup CD or DVD because you can't really say anything more than `this is really funny' without giving away punch-lines and thus ruining the experience of the reader.  Comedy needs to be experienced in order to be fully appreciated, especially standup, because it's the being unaware of where the comedian is going that effectively elevates the experience.So, I want to say that this is REALLY, REALLY funny.I will say a little more than that though.Demetri Martin is a very unique comic.  Instead of standing in place and telling a series of jokes he strums his guitar and plays the piano and shows you a series of pictures he drew himself, as well as some cartoon's he inspired.  He sings you a couple songs and yes, he tells you a lot of jokes.  To say that it's all about the delivery is an understatement.  Not only does Martin have that deadpan delivery that makes his humor all the more effective, but he manages to couple it with the right amount of setup to make it truly laugh-out-loud hysterical.So it's like delivery + scenery.His art section is my personal favorite.  It's so obvious it's funny.  His closing number, the musical reenactment of `where his jokes go after he tells them' is utterly hilarious.  Even my wife, who is not easily amused by standup, found this particular song to be one of the funniest things she's ever seen.  Martin makes you laugh with everything he does.  Even a ginger stroll across the stage to retrieve his harmonica can cause the viewer to burst out in laughter.And get this, he's not offensive.Okay, so I have nothing against an offensive comic (I really LOVE Daniel Tosh, and he is like the king of the dirty joke) but it's nice when a comic can be funny without pushing the envelope.  Martin doesn't feel the need to push your buttons, for he has a knack for finding the funny in things that any and everyone can listen to without squirming.  There are a few expletives peppered in here but nothing so extreme that the entire family can't enjoy this.The extras are also a nice bonus, complimenting this Comedy Central special well; especially the commentary track which features Martin's mother, grandmother, uncles and sister.  There is some of is previous work included as well so the viewer can get to know the comic a little more.  What is so great about `Person' is that it is watchable and appeals to multiple viewings.  I've seen it at least seven times and have laughed out loud every time.  It is a DVD to share with friends and family and one you will be talking about for a long time to come.",5,One of funniest people on the planet; like ever...,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2668,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'difficult', 'think', 'properly', 'review', 'standup', 'CD', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'really', 'funny', 'giving', 'away', 'punch-lines', 'thus', 'ruining', 'experience', 'reader', 'Comedy', 'be', 'experienced', 'order', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'especially', 'standup', 'being', 'unaware', 'where', 'comedian', 'going', 'effectively', 'experience.So', 'want', 'say', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'funny.I', 'will', 'say', 'little', 'more', 'though.Demetri', 'Martin', 'very', 'unique', 'comic', 'Instead', 'standing', 'place', 'telling', 'series', 'jokes', 'strums', 'guitar', 'piano', 'series', 'pictures', 'drew', 'as', 'well', 'cartoon', 'inspired', 'couple', 'songs', 'yes', 'lot', 'jokes', 'say', 'delivery', 'understatement', 'Not', 'only', 'Martin', 'have', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'humor', 'more', 'effective', 'couple', 'right', 'amount', 'setup', 'make', 'truly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hysterical.So', 'like', 'delivery', '+', 'scenery.His', 'art', 'section', 'personal', 'favorite', 'so', 'obvious', 'funny', 'closing', 'number', 'musical', 'reenactment', 'where', 'jokes', 'go', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'Even', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'easily', 'amused', 'standup', 'found', 'particular', 'song', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'ever', 'seen', 'Martin', 'everything', 'Even', 'ginger', 'stroll', 'stage', 'retrieve', 'harmonica', 'can', 'cause', 'viewer', 'burst', 'out', 'laughter.And', 'get', 'not', 'offensive.Okay', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'comic', 'really', 'LOVE', 'Daniel', 'Tosh', 'king', 'dirty', 'joke', 'nice', 'when', 'comic', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'push', 'buttons', 'knack', 'finding', 'funny', 'things', 'everyone', 'can', 'listen', 'squirming', 'are', 'few', 'expletives', 'peppered', 'here', 'nothing', 'so', 'extreme', 'entire', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'this.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'bonus', 'complimenting', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'special', 'well', 'especially', 'commentary', 'track', 'Martin', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'uncles', 'sister', 'previous', 'work', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'comic', 'little', 'more', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'Person', 'watchable', 'appeals', 'multiple', 'viewings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'seven', 'times', 'have', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'time', 'DVD', 'share', 'friends', 'family', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'long', 'time', 'come']",Demetri Martin.

Hedges,"[1, 2]","""Person"" by Demetri Martin is a brilliant, intelligent, and very low-key stand up routine captured in a cable special, and now available on DVD. The DVD is short (around 40 minutes), but filled with gems. My only serious complaint about the DVD is that there are several previews at the beginning of the disc that you can't skip. Since I paid for the DVD, I resent having to watch ads for stuff I would never in a million years be interested in buying. Once the show starts, though, all is well.Martin is known for using a guitar extensively during his monologues; here he also adds piano and bells to his act, and all help to produce a seamless and very funny show. The material is all over the map, from observations about linguistics and personal injury (""The easiest time to add insult to injury is when you're signing somebody's cast.""), to a video game, ""Super Busy Hospital"", where you have to take care of the victims shot in all the other video games, and, of course, many uncategorizable bits (""If I ever saw an amputee being hanged, I would just shout out letters."")There are a couple of short animated links that Martin made which tie segments of the special together. I was especially fond of the inquiry into the deeper life of porcupines, and also enjoyed Professor Irwin Glands discussing less common mythical creatures such as the amoebicorn and the paradoxotaur.The DVD has many bonus features that more than make up for the short special running time. I liked that Martin did a commentary track with his mom and grandmother: he comes across as a very well-grounded, smart, and funny guy. I especially appreciated that the material here is not lowbrow or dependent on scatological references.
