For a thousand years, the mighty white towers guarded the land. Here PBS opens the secret doors; and  reveals to the public(for the first time) the prison chamber where Sir Thomas More was held for a year, before he was murdered. Thomas More rebuked King Henry the VIII(and his new religion), and paid a mighty price. Here also is the courtyard chopping-block, where Henry the VIII sent his former wives who....eh....let him down.....PBS films the Royal Palace, the royal mint, the site of the royal menagerie, and more. Sir Walter Raleigh was an English explorer and writer who was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1603. Some years ago, I toured Tower grounds and was shown Sir Raleigh's lofty prison home. But here it is not photographed by PBS. Also, there are no shots of the Armory's massive musket and pistol collection(A sight to see). PBS's &#34;Secrets of the Tower of London&#34; is a professional, sometimes grim documentary. I was disappointed not to see the Royal Crown Jewels, valued at 46 billion dollars(They may be priceless). The Royal Crown Jewels are not filmed. Naturally.

With the exception of showing the Crown Jewels (cameras are not allowed) the cameras go into almost every nook and cranny of this historical monument.  Except it is also shown to be a home to some - the guards, the Beefeaters and we also hear their story as well as that of the ravens.Aerial views and even Tower Bridge are shown. There are very few talking heads - (interviews that go on and on, just showing the person narrating their story). Instead we are led around the grounds and into various rooms and told their history and significance, even about the menagerie that used to be a tourist attraction - especially an elephant, that was given a gallon of wine a day to help him keep warm. At least he, as we are told lived a short, happy, drunken life.The narration and sound, as well as the photography are excellent.
