Yes, the acting is a little campy, and the special effects budget was shorted; but the basic storyline was enjoyable. There were gaps and flashbacks after the fact that did not add to the smoothness of the story, but I enjoyed it. Younger kids will not be thrown off by the battles scenes as little gory is evident.

1520218,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B006VJ1AAI,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","I caught a few minutes of the second part of The Witches of Oz on an Encore channel the other day, where I saw a taxi floating in the air inside of a bubble while the wicked witch and her monkeys are causing chaos in the streets of New York. The scene caught my interest, but I had to leave at the time and the movie wasn't going to be on again. Luckily, I happened to stumble upon it for under ten dollars and of course I had to buy it. Little did I know that the movie was 164 minutes! After a little googling, I found out it was original intended as a mini-series, but ended up being cut down to 100 minutes with 15 minutes of new special effects added and released to a limited (very limited) run in theaters earlier this year. Why in the world would they send the longer version to DVD and to Encore?The Witches of Oz is set in our time and involves twenty-something Dorothy Gale getting a publishing contract for her OZ children stories; therefore she leaves her family farm and heads to New York. As strange situations occur, Dorothy's memory slowly returns and so do the evil Wicked Witch and her followers (Princess Langwidere, Nome King, an army of Winked Monkeys and a powerful dragon.). Soon Dorothy's friends from Oz return too, including Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Frick & Frack, the good witches, and Oz himself, as they try to help her defeat the wicked witch once and for all.The plot sounds interesting and with such talented actors as Billy Boyd, Jeffery Combs, Sean Austin, Ethan Embry, Mia Sara, Lance Henriksen and Christopher Lloyd, one would think this movie had a chance of being good. But after watching nearly three hours I was left with mixed feelings and some confusion. At times the movie would go dark more toward an adult theme, and then suddenly, with horrible dialogue, it would change into a campy kid's movie. The actors tried to do their best with a confusing script, all except Dorothy played by Paulie Rojas who couldn't act and was widely miscasted. The special effects were your typical low-budget, but I could see the director Leigh Scott tried to do his best with what little he had to work with.Younger kids will probably enjoy watching this new take, and somewhat of a sequel, to The Wizard of Oz, but most adults might find it painful to watch. The movie is not completely awful, there are moments, here and there, that are intriguing. In my opinion the Wicked Witch was the best part, and I liked the makeup that they used on her, I even liked the eye patch. The Witches of Oz is not a great movie, as I have seen far worse like the Syfy's Tin Man that aired a few years ago. It's a forgettable fluff, with cheesy 80's special effects, dreadful dialogue, but with a few scenes of imagination.",2,"Great Ideas, but the Low Budget Held It Back",1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,2747,"['caught', 'few', 'minutes', 'second', 'part', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'Encore', 'channel', 'other', 'day', 'where', 'saw', 'taxi', 'floating', 'air', 'bubble', 'wicked', 'witch', 'monkeys', 'are', 'causing', 'chaos', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'scene', 'caught', 'interest', 'had', 'leave', 'time', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'again', 'Luckily', 'happened', 'stumble', 'ten', 'dollars', 'course', 'had', 'buy', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'movie', 'was', '164', 'minutes', 'little', 'googling', 'found', 'was', 'original', 'intended', 'mini-series', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'cut', 'down', '100', 'minutes', '15', 'minutes', 'new', 'special', 'effects', 'added', 'released', 'limited', 'very', 'limited', 'run', 'theaters', 'earlier', 'year', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'send', 'longer', 'version', 'DVD', 'Encore', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'set', 'time', 'twenty-something', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'getting', 'publishing', 'contract', 'OZ', 'children', 'stories', 'family', 'farm', 'heads', 'New', 'York', 'strange', 'situations', 'occur', 'Dorothy', 'memory', 'slowly', 'returns', 'so', 'do', 'evil', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'followers', 'Princess', 'Langwidere', 'Nome', 'King', 'army', 'Winked', 'Monkeys', 'powerful', 'dragon.', 'Soon', 'Dorothy', 'friends', 'Oz', 'return', 'too', 'including', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'Frick', 'Frack', 'good', 'witches', 'Oz', 'try', 'help', 'defeat', 'wicked', 'witch', 'once', 'all.The', 'plot', 'interesting', 'such', 'talented', 'actors', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'Jeffery', 'Combs', 'Sean', 'Austin', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'good', 'watching', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'times', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'dark', 'more', 'adult', 'theme', 'then', 'suddenly', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'would', 'change', 'campy', 'kid', 'movie', 'actors', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'confusing', 'script', 'Dorothy', 'played', 'Paulie', 'Rojas', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'widely', 'miscasted', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'could', 'see', 'director', 'Leigh', 'Scott', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'little', 'had', 'work', 'with.Younger', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'new', 'take', 'somewhat', 'sequel', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'most', 'adults', 'might', 'find', 'painful', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'completely', 'awful', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'are', 'intriguing', 'opinion', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'liked', 'makeup', 'used', 'even', 'liked', 'eye', 'patch', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'Syfy', 'Tin', 'Man', 'aired', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'forgettable', 'fluff', 'cheesy', '80', 'special', 'effects', 'dreadful', 'dialogue', 'few', 'scenes', 'imagination']",The Witches of Oz

1520221,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B006VJ1AAI,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[42, 51]","I had high hopes for this miniseries, After all, ""Tin Man"" is one of my favorite miniseries ever, and this one stars Billy Boyd, Sean Astin, Jeffrey Combs and Christopher Lloyd.Sadly, ""The Witches of Oz"" is a massive misfire right from the beginning -- it tries to be both an epic, intense adventure story and a kid-friendly all-you-need-is-love fairy tale at the same time. Lloyd, Boyd and a handful of other actors do what little they can to salvage the story, but the hammy acting, bad CGI and slapworthy ending make it impossible.Budding writer Dorothy Gale (Paulie Rojas) is stunned when prominent agent Billie Westbrook (Eliza Swenson) develops an interest in the Oz books she's been writing with her friend Allen (Ari Zagaris). Dorothy and Allen move to New York City, unaware that the Wicked Witch of the West and her head-swapping minion Princess Langwidere (Mia Sara) are plotting against her.Specifically, they want a key to a magic book which Dorothy had when she returned from Oz many years ago. But Dorothy has forgotten about her time in Oz,  so she can't remember where she put the key. Along with Allen, her new buddy Bryan (Barry J. Ratcliffe) and love interest Nick (Boyd), she must find the key before the Witch has a chance to take over all worlds.""The Witches of Oz"" is a schizophrenic mess of a story. It wants to be a big, dark save-the-world story, but it also wants to be a kiddie-friendly family film.  Even worse, it seems to have been made up as it went -- foreshadowing comes to naught (Nick's identity), important items go unmentioned until they're needed, and random characters pop out of the woodwork without warning.It also feels like the budget was somebody allowance -- the costumes are silly (Glinda looks like a cut-rate Valkyrie) and the special effects are simply embarrassing. I will admit that there are some really moving moments, such as Jeffrey Combs as a grieving father whose child has been swept away to Oz.But the rest of the movie is just so cheesy and campy, and riddled with gaping plot holes that you could fly a taxi through. It all climaxes in a truly horrendous battle through a magically-ravaged NYC, where the Evil Minions of the Evil Witch... lightly annoy the New York residents. Apparently flying monkeys, dragons and evil gnomes don't kill people -- they just sort of whack them with sticks.Oh, and the ending? It completely negates everything that has gone on before it, by revealing that everything both the heroes and villains did was TOTALLY POINTLESS. And its ""all you need is love/friendship"" message is completely negated by what happens at the climax.Some of the actors are really, really good. Boyd is charming, low-key and resolutely normal, Combs is heartbreakingly good, Astin and Ethan Embry are fun, and Christopher Walken is slyly clever in his brief role. Sadly, Rojas seems to be stuck in ""wide-eyed ingenue"" mode, and that's how she plays every emotion that Dorothy is supposed to experience.And the actors playing the villains are just awful, especially since they're all played for bad comic relief. None of them are even slightly scary! Swenson is particularly tragic -- she gives a very good performance when she looks human, but transforms into a hissing growling parody of Margaret Hamilton buried under bad green makeup as the Witch. She's less frightening than the Kardashians.""The Witches of Oz"" tries to be too many things, and ends up as nothing -- a whimsically candy-sweet mess that makes absolutely no sense by the end. Just watch ""Tin Man.""",1,All the witches (spoilers),1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3535,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'miniseries', 'Tin', 'Man', 'one', 'favorite', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'one', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd.Sadly', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'massive', 'misfire', 'right', 'beginning', 'be', 'epic', 'intense', 'adventure', 'story', 'kid-friendly', 'all-you-need-is-love', 'fairy', 'tale', 'same', 'time', 'Lloyd', 'Boyd', 'handful', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'salvage', 'story', 'hammy', 'acting', 'bad', 'CGI', 'slapworthy', 'ending', 'make', 'impossible.Budding', 'writer', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'Paulie', 'Rojas', 'stunned', 'when', 'prominent', 'agent', 'Billie', 'Westbrook', 'Eliza', 'Swenson', 'interest', 'Oz', 'books', 'been', 'writing', 'friend', 'Allen', 'Ari', 'Zagaris', 'Dorothy', 'Allen', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'unaware', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'head-swapping', 'minion', 'Princess', 'Langwidere', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'are', 'plotting', 'her.Specifically', 'want', 'key', 'magic', 'book', 'Dorothy', 'had', 'when', 'returned', 'Oz', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Dorothy', 'forgotten', 'time', 'Oz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'put', 'key', 'Allen', 'new', 'buddy', 'Bryan', 'Barry', 'J.', 'Ratcliffe', 'love', 'interest', 'Nick', 'Boyd', 'must', 'find', 'key', 'Witch', 'chance', 'take', 'over', 'worlds', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'schizophrenic', 'mess', 'story', 'be', 'big', 'dark', 'save-the-world', 'story', 'also', 'be', 'kiddie-friendly', 'family', 'film', 'Even', 'worse', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'up', 'went', 'foreshadowing', 'naught', 'Nick', 'identity', 'important', 'items', 'go', 'unmentioned', ""'re"", 'needed', 'random', 'characters', 'pop', 'woodwork', 'warning.It', 'also', 'budget', 'was', 'somebody', 'allowance', 'costumes', 'are', 'silly', 'Glinda', 'cut-rate', 'Valkyrie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'simply', 'embarrassing', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'really', 'moving', 'moments', 'such', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'grieving', 'father', 'child', 'been', 'swept', 'away', 'Oz.But', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'riddled', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'could', 'fly', 'taxi', 'climaxes', 'truly', 'horrendous', 'battle', 'magically-ravaged', 'NYC', 'where', 'Evil', 'Minions', 'Evil', 'Witch', 'lightly', 'New', 'York', 'residents', 'Apparently', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'dragons', 'evil', 'gnomes', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'just', 'sort', 'whack', 'sticks.Oh', 'ending', 'completely', 'everything', 'gone', 'revealing', 'everything', 'heroes', 'villains', 'did', 'was', 'TOTALLY', 'POINTLESS', 'need', 'love/friendship', 'message', 'completely', 'negated', 'what', 'climax.Some', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'Boyd', 'charming', 'low-key', 'resolutely', 'normal', 'Combs', 'heartbreakingly', 'good', 'Astin', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'are', 'fun', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'slyly', 'clever', 'brief', 'role', 'Sadly', 'Rojas', 'be', 'stuck', 'wide-eyed', 'ingenue', 'mode', 'how', 'emotion', 'Dorothy', 'supposed', 'experience.And', 'actors', 'playing', 'villains', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'especially', ""'re"", 'played', 'bad', 'comic', 'relief', 'None', 'are', 'even', 'slightly', 'scary', 'Swenson', 'particularly', 'tragic', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'when', 'human', 'hissing', 'growling', 'parody', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'buried', 'bad', 'green', 'makeup', 'Witch', 'less', 'frightening', 'Kardashians', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'up', 'nothing', 'whimsically', 'candy-sweet', 'mess', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'end', 'Just', 'watch', 'Tin', 'Man']",The Witches of Oz
1520222,A1TCJD20WQYBMQ,B006VJ1AAI,EmMeowCat,"[1, 2]","Let me say, I had not read any of the books before seeing this.  I had only seen The wizard of Oz original and Return to Oz movies.The best part for me was the character of Dorothy's friend/scarecrow.  I felt he captured the scarecrow of The Wizard Of OZ.  The wicked witch of the west was also a fairly well done character.  Dorothy could have been better.Her fake hair was soo annoying.. They did try to include way too much in the plot and ended up with a toss-up  of tid-bits of everything--This could be made into a television series, I think.  I wish it would be!I had seen Return to Oz so I understood who Ozma was from the beginning (lady with interchangeable heads) and the Gnome King and Tic-Toc, but if you'd only seen Wizard of Oz, I can understand how you'd be confused from the beginning and in some parts.  They made the Wizard all good in this in contrast to being a fraud in the Wizard of Oz.It actually started getting good when Uncle Henry told the story of who Dorothy really was--it was almost like 2 different people created the movie before and after when Henry began his story--before that it kind of drug(dragged?) lol. If you sit out till this part you won't be disappointed.I don't agree with some other reviews that the soundtrack made the language inaudible.  I don't think it did this at all and wouldn't even comment on it if I hadn't read other reviews first.  The soundtrack may be the best part of the movie.Glenda really captured the character I remember as well (in an older form).  The flying monkeys were a disappointed (special effects could have been better). But I really think today we expect too much and have forgotten how to use our imaginations, which is much of what the wizard of oz means to me; Just like the original Wizard of Oz didn't have today's special effects--not sure this correlation was intentional rather than low budget but it worked for me to connect the 2.I don't know if the butterfly was part of the books but I liked how it came back at key moments to remind Dorothy who she was.

1520238,A24ZMNWTW8AQUR,B006VJ1AAI,"SciFiChick ""The SciFiChick""","[9, 10]","Disclaimer: This is a review of the director's cut entitled ""Dorothy and the Witches of Oz,"" which isn't available for purchase yet on Amazon. It was just out in select theaters. I received a screener for review.The story follows Dorothy Gale (Paulie Rojas), a children's author continuing the Oz series. After her uncles death back in Kansas, Dorothy discovers that her stories were not from her imagination but from her own experiences in Oz. Now, the evil witches are in New York and looking for a key that Dorothy hid as a child. Only Dorothy and her friends can stop the Wicked Witch of the West from destroying both Oz and this reality.Based on L. Frank Baum's books not the popular film starring Judy Garland, fans will notice the additional characters right away.  And Dorothy's slippers are silver not Garland's ruby red. Christopher Lloyd as the Wizard was my biggest reason for seeing the film. He was fantastic. But I was happy to see other known faces as well such as Sean Astin and Ethan Embry as the cute, funny, and miniature Frick and Frack. And Jeffrey Combs has a brief but memorable performance as Dorothy's heartbroken father. Paulie Rojas as Dorothy is a bit wooden, but her sweetness and innocence is believable. And Eliza Swenson as Billie Westbrook was pure fun to watch in her complex role.At first I was confused about the target audience. The mood seemed darker and suddenly violent, until I realized all of the action and fight scenes were stylized. Some of the monstrous creatures might be a bit scary for young children, but it's still only rated PG and is certainly a family movie. The (director's cut) special effects are clever and most of the evil creatures look like something out of a campy 70's or 80's film, which I think adds to the charming storybook feel. At times the movie reminded me of a favorite show ABC's Once Upon a Time - with the campy feel meets the real world. Yet Dorothy and the Witches of Oz is much more family friendly and light-hearted.  Full of adventure, magic, mystery, and colorful characters - this film was unexpectedly heartwarming and a bright homage to the classic Oz books.",4,Dorothy and the Witches of Oz,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2143,"['Disclaimer', 'review', 'director', 'cut', 'entitled', 'Dorothy', 'Witches', 'Oz', ""n't"", 'available', 'purchase', 'yet', 'Amazon', 'was', 'just', 'out', 'select', 'theaters', 'received', 'screener', 'review.The', 'story', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'Paulie', 'Rojas', 'children', 'author', 'continuing', 'Oz', 'series', 'uncles', 'death', 'back', 'Kansas', 'Dorothy', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'imagination', 'own', 'experiences', 'Oz', 'Now', 'evil', 'witches', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'looking', 'key', 'Dorothy', 'hid', 'child', 'Only', 'Dorothy', 'friends', 'can', 'stop', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'destroying', 'Oz', 'reality.Based', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'books', 'not', 'popular', 'film', 'starring', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'fans', 'will', 'notice', 'additional', 'characters', 'right', 'away', 'Dorothy', 'slippers', 'are', 'silver', 'not', 'Garland', 'ruby', 'red', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Wizard', 'was', 'biggest', 'reason', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'other', 'known', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'cute', 'funny', 'miniature', 'Frick', 'Frack', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'brief', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Dorothy', 'heartbroken', 'father', 'Paulie', 'Rojas', 'Dorothy', 'bit', 'wooden', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'believable', 'Eliza', 'Swenson', 'Billie', 'Westbrook', 'was', 'pure', 'fun', 'watch', 'complex', 'role.At', 'first', 'was', 'confused', 'target', 'audience', 'mood', 'seemed', 'darker', 'suddenly', 'violent', 'realized', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'stylized', 'monstrous', 'creatures', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'scary', 'young', 'children', 'still', 'only', 'rated', 'PG', 'certainly', 'family', 'movie', 'director', 'cut', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'clever', 'most', 'evil', 'creatures', 'look', 'something', 'campy', '70', '80', 'film', 'think', 'charming', 'storybook', 'feel', 'times', 'movie', 'reminded', 'favorite', 'show', 'ABC', 'Once', 'Time', 'campy', 'feel', 'real', 'world', 'Dorothy', 'Witches', 'Oz', 'much', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'light-hearted', 'Full', 'adventure', 'magic', 'mystery', 'colorful', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'heartwarming', 'bright', 'homage', 'classic', 'Oz', 'books']",The Witches of Oz

The acting is horrid, the make up and costumes looks like someone went and got cheap halloween costumes at a bargain center, and ""Dorothy"" had a lack of emotion, a bad wig, and a make-up job that looked like a 6 year old did it.  There was no real plot, except everyone hunting for a key.  It had the same flashback over and over and over and over again.  Nothing was explained until 2/3 through the movie, so not much made sense.  There was no good foreshadowing which made certain reveals confusing and like a last minute decision.  The special effects are dreadful and a joke.  Out of 2 hours and 45 minutes of actual playtime, about 10 minutes worth took place in OZ which was badly computer generated.  It mainly takes place in New York City...so that is a disappointment right there. How they EVER talked Christopher Lloyd, Sean Astin, and Ethan Embry to be in this movie is beyond me.  I think the fact that their roles were so short, it must have convinced them of some easy and quick money.  Lloyd was in it for all of five minutes, and Astin and Embry were brilliantly funny, but in it about ten to fifteen minutes total as little elf-like characters with bad limericks.  The movie dragged and dragged and you kept waiting for it to get good...and it never does.  If you are a fan of OZ, stay away!!!!  AVOID at all costs!!

The movie is confused and disjointed. Eventually all the major plot holes are filled in, leaving just plot continuity problems common to most kid films. The part I enjoyed most of this kid's film was when Dorothy tries to pick up Billy Boyd at a bar and when Billie Westbrook (Eliza Swenson) gropes Dorothy (Paulie Rojas) in an attempt to give her more up top. Noel Thurman plays Glinda the good witch of the north who is dressed up like Brumhilda.Dorothy writes books based on her suppressed memories. The whole plot centers around a magic book that contains a magic word that can only be opened by a magic key which Dorothy stole and hid but can't remember. The bad witches want it back. This we get in the opening of the film which tells a long drawn out story of good vs. evil similar to Lord of the Rings background. The character of Dorothy was a bit sickening as was the dorky Allen (Ari Zagaris) who appears to have been a poorly developed scarecrow.The best characters were gnomes played by Sean Astin and Ethan Embry. The spoke in limericks. Christopher Lloyd attempted to bring life to the role of the Wizard with his Madhatter garb, but couldn't do so for the lack of decent lines.
