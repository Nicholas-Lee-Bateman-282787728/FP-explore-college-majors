When I watch Northern Exposure, I think of what the poet Terrence said - ""I am a man. Nothing human is alien to me"". Well that is the show.It's all about this experience we are all going through. What it means to be human. Mankind in its diverse shades co-existing on this all too large blue marble in the sky.Northern Exposure gave me so many moments of pause, of joy, of smiling sadness, of deep thought, that I know and feel that I am a better person because of it. It both enriches and entertains. And that is powerful!In this age where it seems everything conspires to tear us all apart, to isolate us, to scare us, where small town community is portrayed in post-apocalyptic shows like Jericho (highly recommended viewing by the way), and Mother Nature has us all on the run, that somewhere beyond the sea, and over the rainbow, North to Alaska, is Cicely, waiting to be found, visited, explored, and loved over and over again.If any of the writers and creators of Northern Exposure ever read this, I want to tell you that you did good. You did really good.Now if you'll excuse me. I'm going to hit the Brick.Adam is cooking. Holling is pouring. The beer is flowing like wine and the music is just right.Cheers to you all and long live Jessie the Bear!Hi-ho-hi-ho-ips-in-I-yo!",5,What It Means to Be Human ...,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1471,"['something', 'show', 'physical', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'level', 'nothing', 'else', 'currently', 'television', 'even', 'matter', 'modern', 'literature', 'When', 'watch', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'think', 'what', 'poet', 'Terrence', 'said', 'am', 'man', 'Nothing', 'human', 'alien', 'Well', 'show.It', 'experience', 'are', 'going', 'What', 'be', 'human', 'Mankind', 'diverse', 'shades', 'co-existing', 'too', 'large', 'blue', 'marble', 'sky.Northern', 'Exposure', 'gave', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'pause', 'joy', 'smiling', 'sadness', 'deep', 'thought', 'know', 'feel', 'am', 'better', 'person', 'enriches', 'entertains', 'powerful', 'age', 'where', 'everything', 'conspires', 'tear', 'apart', 'isolate', 'scare', 'where', 'small', 'town', 'community', 'portrayed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'shows', 'Jericho', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'way', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'run', 'somewhere', 'sea', 'rainbow', 'North', 'Alaska', 'Cicely', 'waiting', 'be', 'found', 'visited', 'explored', 'loved', 'over', 'over', 'again.If', 'writers', 'creators', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'ever', 'read', 'want', 'tell', 'did', 'good', 'did', 'really', 'good.Now', ""'ll"", 'excuse', ""'m"", 'going', 'hit', 'Brick.Adam', 'cooking', 'Holling', 'pouring', 'beer', 'flowing', 'wine', 'music', 'just', 'right.Cheers', 'long', 'live', 'Jessie', 'Bear', 'Hi-ho-hi-ho-ips-in-I-yo']",Northern Exposure: The Complete First and Second Seasons

Their good points and equally bad points.I've gone into ""The Brick"" (no matter what town, they all have a ""Brick"") from the cold, snow, and slush and walked into a warm, uniquely friendly place where everyone knows everyone else and their business.  Good food, always hot coffee, and cold beer.Northern Exposure reminds me so much of a compilation of all these small towns scattered across the northern U.S. it's a ton of fun to watch.  I feel while Northern Exposure is not an exact portrayal of small towns, and the viewer has to use a little imagination, the basic feel of the people and their lives is there.I have the entire series on VHS which is not the same as DVD's, but at least they're original and intact.HIGHLY Recommended.",5,Been there - Done that,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,977,"['been', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'so', 'let', 'say', 'just', 'When', 'was', 'Air', 'Force', 'was', 'several', 'small', 'towns', 'Cicely', 'not', 'Alaska', 'had', 'wonderful', 'warm', 'small', 'town', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'points', 'equally', 'bad', 'points.I', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Brick', 'matter', 'what', 'town', 'have', 'Brick', 'cold', 'snow', 'slush', 'walked', 'warm', 'uniquely', 'friendly', 'place', 'where', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'business', 'Good', 'food', 'always', 'hot', 'coffee', 'cold', 'beer.Northern', 'Exposure', 'so', 'much', 'compilation', 'small', 'towns', 'scattered', 'northern', 'U.S.', 'ton', 'fun', 'watch', 'feel', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'not', 'exact', 'portrayal', 'small', 'towns', 'viewer', 'use', 'little', 'imagination', 'basic', 'feel', 'people', 'lives', 'there.I', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'VHS', 'not', 'same', 'DVD', 'least', ""'re"", 'original', 'intact.HIGHLY', 'Recommended']",Northern Exposure: The Complete First and Second Seasons

The stories, the characters, the settings and the music make this series truly memorable.The story focuses on the character of Joel Fleischman, played by Rob Morrow, who had recently completed his studies to be a medical doctor by way of a scholarship from the State of Alaska. The payback for the State of Alaska is the scholarship required that Dr. Fleischman serve for four years as a doctor in that state. This is the story of the events surrounding his arrival in Alaska and his discovery of where he would actually serve out his time there.One gets the feeling that the closest Dr. Joel Fleischman had come to the wild was a stroll through Central Park and possibly a visit to the Bronx Zoo. Now he finds himself in what is for him, a totally alien environment to which he must somehow adapt. On top of all that he encounters some remarkably rugged individuals who will now populate his life in ways he couldn't even previously imagine.This set of the complete first and second seasons are a joy to watch and have good sound and picture quality.

I missed a revolution in television in which shows exercised story arcs which took more than a week or two to complete (cliffhanger sweeps week specials). Now, they're commonplace. In 1990 ... it was daring. And this series deserved the gamble. Watch the ""Soapy Sanderson"" episode, you'll see.Renting seasons 1 and 2 last year, I saw clearly that the production team set up a situation with the ""fish out of water"" Joel, his ""love at first dislike"" sparring partner Maggie, and all the other idiosyncratic supporting characters ... then took careful time milking the milieu ... and ended up with a touching lover story. Joel and Maggie's thawing out ... but also Joel's relationship with Cicely, Alaska. Joel thinking that, as a young, talented doctor, he's got life figured out ... over the episodes, we see clearly that he's clueless.It's not even dated.

The interesting story develops with the town residents trying to live their lives and go forward while their doctor is waiting until he can leave.  Strangely enough, everyone gets used to each other and begins to enjoy their lives as best as possible.

With television shows that take place in small fictional communities, Northern Exposure is just one of those very few that have defied expectations.Northern Exposure is an ensemble show that was produced back in the nineties and featured such notable stars as John Corbett, Barry Corbin, Janine Turner, Rob Morrow (Num3ers), Peg Phillips (7th Heaven), Adam Arkin, Anthony Edwards (Top Gun, E.R.) and Floyd Westerman (Walker, Texas Ranger). The series also welcomed a slew of guest stars through its six year run.For those that might be confused as to why the first two seasons had a small episode count, be mindful that the series was a summer replacement series for CBS at that time. It would gain a regular placement for the following 1991-92 season but was also limited to a certain number of episodes by the studio. When the series returned for a third season, Northern Exposure would get a full season worth of episodes that would last through the end of the series.Originally, the series focused on the character of Joel Fleischman, who was portrayed by Rob Morrow (Num3ers). When Rob Morrow ran into contract negotiations with the studio in an effort to improve his contract, network execs decided to switch the focus from Rob Morrow and opted to focus more on the other characters, giving the series more of an ensemble look. Eventually, Rob Morrow would leave the show, resolving the situation of Joel Fleischman and give the series a different direction, focusing ecven more of the characters of Cicely, Alaska. The series would go into freefall after Rob Morrow's departure from the series and is considered the least favourite season of the entire series.Overall, I have watched through the series several times and while the final season does seem to lack that friendly atmosphere that Rob Morrow provided, the entire series is a pretty decent one. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. And, with this re-released budgeted set of Season 1 and 2, look forward to the remaining seasons being released in this lower-priced format. I can't recommend this series fast enough and if you're looking for a quality show to watch, then this is the right one for you.",5,Frosty Exposure,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,2411,"['have', 'been', 'lot', 'television', 'shows', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'show', 'developed', 'cult', 'following', 'own', 'television', 'shows', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'fictional', 'communities', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'just', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'defied', 'expectations.Northern', 'Exposure', 'ensemble', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'back', 'nineties', 'featured', 'such', 'notable', 'stars', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Janine', 'Turner', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Num3ers', 'Peg', 'Phillips', '7th', 'Heaven', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Top', 'Gun', 'E.R', 'Floyd', 'Westerman', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'series', 'also', 'welcomed', 'slew', 'guest', 'stars', 'six', 'year', 'run.For', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'why', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'small', 'episode', 'count', 'be', 'mindful', 'series', 'was', 'summer', 'replacement', 'series', 'CBS', 'time', 'would', 'gain', 'regular', 'placement', 'following', '1991-92', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'limited', 'certain', 'number', 'episodes', 'studio', 'When', 'series', 'returned', 'third', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'would', 'get', 'full', 'season', 'worth', 'episodes', 'would', 'last', 'end', 'series.Originally', 'series', 'focused', 'character', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'who', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Num3ers', 'When', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'ran', 'contract', 'negotiations', 'studio', 'effort', 'improve', 'contract', 'network', 'execs', 'decided', 'switch', 'focus', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'opted', 'focus', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'giving', 'series', 'more', 'ensemble', 'look', 'Eventually', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'would', 'leave', 'show', 'resolving', 'situation', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'give', 'series', 'different', 'direction', 'focusing', 'ecven', 'more', 'characters', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'series', 'would', 'go', 'freefall', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'departure', 'series', 'considered', 'least', 'favourite', 'season', 'entire', 'series.Overall', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'final', 'season', 'seem', 'lack', 'friendly', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'provided', 'entire', 'series', 'pretty', 'decent', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 're-released', 'budgeted', 'set', 'Season', '1', '2', 'look', 'forward', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'being', 'released', 'lower-priced', 'format', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'fast', 'enough', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quality', 'show', 'watch', 'then', 'right', 'one']",Northern Exposure: The Complete First and Second Seasons

As one of the tags say, intelligent, and very funny while being very honest.  This series isn't about Alaska or small towns, it is about human nature and the whole, huge, world we live in.Dr. Joel Fleischman, played by Rob Morrow, is trapped in a town in Alaska that he finds offbeat, strange, and, sometimes, dangerous.  Many of the characters you will learn to love as Chris the DJ, played by the amazing John Corbett.  There is also Holling as 62 year old the bartender, played by the calm and mild John Cullum, along with Maurice played by the, somewhat over the top, Barry Corbin.  And there is Ed, the want to be filmmaker in search of his roots and a good story, played by Darren E. Burrows who happens to be the best character in the series.  Well, to me anyway.  And the beautiful Maggie, the bush pilot played by Janine Turner, who has the boyfriend curse.There are others, of course.  The one episode Adam, Rick the fifth boyfriend, and others.  None of them are really minor characters yet few are major.  Even Doctor Fleischman sometimes seems to be in the background, almost part of the audience, trying to understand the logic that is Cicely, Alaska.While there are two seasons the total number of episodes are 15, as it was kind of a filler when it first came out.  I am also not sure CBS was sure of the humor and didn't foresee it becoming a hit.It has tons of extras in the form of deleted scenes and unused footage.

975269,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000EOTTS6,Robert Moore,"[225, 262]","OK, this is how it should have been done from the outset.  For those who either don't know or don't remember, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was originally a summer replacement show, beginning to run only a couple of weeks after TWIN PEAKS in 1990.  That first summer season ran 8 episodes and the following spring the second season ran for 7 episodes, meaning that Seasons One and Two run to a grand total of 15 episodes.  Despite this, the first two seasons were originally released as separate box sets but priced as much as full single seasons.  It was one of the most overpriced pair of sets in the relatively short history of DVDs.  No sane person would have considered buying them (I rented from Netflix).  Now, however, sane people can consider getting the first two seasons.  I already own Seasons Three and Four, and now I can add Seasons One and Two.Before saying a couple of things about the seasons, let me say that people who complain about the soundtrack really need to . . . I apologize beforehand for any impoliteness here . . . shut up!!!  Look, music substitution is just going to be part of the future from here on out in TV shows coming out on DVD.  There is simply no way around it.  Or rather, if you want to blame someone, blame ASCAP and BMI and RIAA.  Here is the real deal:  as long as these folks continue to exact such huge royalties for the use of songs, we are going to get vastly less expensive songs substituted for the original ones.  There is simply no way around it.  The makers of the DVDs have two choices:  substitute music and sell the sets at reasonable prices or use the original music and sell the sets at absurdly high prices.  Want to pay $100 per season of NORTHERN EXPOSURE?  Well, neither do I.  But to get the original music that is what it is going to cost.  So, the choice really is substituting music or paying through the nose for our DVDs.  This is the very reason why ALLY McBEAL may never some out on DVD.  That show was written too tightly to particular songs to enable substitution.  Right now they are unable to come up with pricing that makes it possible to bring it out on DVD.  Someday?  Maybe.  But until such nonproductive entities as I mentioned above (especially RIAA), who own rights but really don't do anything for anyone that matters, especially the artists, start bringing the fees charged down to a reasonable level, substitution is going to be the standard practice.What gets me about NORTHERN EXPOSURE is how quickly it found itself.  The surrealism that graced so many episodes would only come with the second season, but the atmosphere of weirdness took place almost immediately.  In the first episode, it was at first Joel Fleischman who seemed a bit weird, as he bored some innocent fellow passenger on his flight to Alaska.  But as soon as he was dropped off at the bus stop on his way to Cicely and was picked up by Ed Chigliak, he was one of the least eccentric residents of the town.  The show made adjustments.  Holling and Shelly were not at first as prominent as they later would be; Chris hadn't quite found himself as the spiritual voice of Cicely; Maggie wasn't yet as odd as she would become; and Peg Phillips as Ruth-Anne wasn't yet a permanent cast member.  Still, as shows go, this one was pretty much in Season One the show we would know later.  By Season Two, it was pretty much the show it would be through the first five seasons.One of my preoccupations in watching television has been the ways shows handle narrative.  After HILL STREET BLUES in the early 1980s, the mark of most of what has come to be known by TV theorists as Quality TV shows has been multiple, ongoing narrative threads.  Especially after advances in TV narrative by TWIN PEAKS and THE X-FILES, both of which overlapped with NORTHERN EXPOSURE, narratives were not merely multi-threaded but long term.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE may have been the last Quality TV show to feature almost exclusively stand-alone episodes that resolve all or most of the story arcs with each episode.  Especially after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (1997-2003) virtually all Quality TV shows feature long and multiple story arcs (though popular with audiences, few critics or TV theorists have considered any of the shows in the LAW AND ORDER or CSI franchises Quality TV, but as regressions to an earlier period in TV history).  One mark of more narratively complex shows is that they have to be shown in a particular order.  For instance, you couldn't take an episode of Season Two of BUFFY and put it in Season Four.  Although NORTHERN EXPOSURE does not utilize multiple story arcs or use long narrative, it does share this feature for the most part with other Quality TV shows.  Although the DVDs frequently reorder the episodes compared with the original airing dates, frequent mention is made to previous episodes.  It is an interesting way NORTHERN EXPOSURE varies from other shows structured around stand-alone episodes.This really is a very special television show, with one of the best collection of characters in the history of TV.  I've told friends that while I have shows I like more, like BUFFY and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and ANGEL and FARSCAPE, if I had like the characters in PLEASANTVILLE enter a TV world and live there, my choice would definitely be Cicely.  These are characters I've come to love and care about in a way that differs from any other collection of characters.  And now that they have repackaged the first two seasons in saner fashion, any sane individual who wants to own them can.",5,Better to get it right late than not at all,1146873600,"05 6,

The writing was the most original and interesting ever created in the history of television, and anyone who watches this show will find it hard to find anything better. Most people reading these reviews probably already know how great Northern Exposure is, so the one thing that I think is important to say is that SOME of the music is different. Many people have complained that the music has been changed - and these complaints are indeed warranted. The music in the shows was deliberately choosen to convey important emotional and cerebral experiences by the viewer / listener. But, many people have ignored the fact that alot of the music has NOT changed!! For proof of this, just look at the official soundtrack recordings on CD, and then really pay attention to the shows. Many songs are still there.

I will probably get only season 5 whenever I see it for the lowest price and stop right there.The show was not as interesting once the producers/creators decided to write out the role of Dr. Fleischman.His role was the original purpose of the show. As the only doctor in the little town, he was the important catalyst for the show's stories as he interacted with all of the characters in the fictional town of Cicely. His role drove the whole show.But from what I understood, his role was minimized due to a contract dispute with the actor who plays Dr. Fleischman.The creators later got a dose of their own medicine when they were successfully sued by a man who claimed that the idea for the show was orginally his. Karma.Whoa! Just purchased Season 5 here at amazon for a great price. However, this show lost its original creators and executive producers for this season, Brand and Falsey, and the 5th season really lost its luster. I never cared for the last season, so I will not be collecting it.The actor who plays the doctor is really subdued here. Like he had a lobotomy or something. Not the same feisty young man that started this great series. Even the lighting of the show is darker.The first 4 seasons are definitely now the best. They were very light and cheery. Very funny with excellent writing throughout.So, Buyer Beware!",5,Great series.
