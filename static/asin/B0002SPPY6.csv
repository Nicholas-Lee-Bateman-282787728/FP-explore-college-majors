The DVD contains NO extras what-so-ever. That is the reason I could not give this 5 stars. It was put together from over 500 hours of footage, and yet they still could not manage to put some extra scenes....they did not even add in the extras scenes that VH1 ALL ACCESS showed advertising the documentary...so there are my minor problems with this DVD. I taped it commercial free when it aired on VH1, and bought it...unfortunately I bought it because PBS said it had extras...ANYWAY, the documentary itself is magnificent and if you have not seen you need to. Any fan of rock music could surely appreciate this. This DVD documents the tense making of Fleetwood Mac's first album with Lindsey Buckingham since 1987. This was also their first album without keyboardist, and sometime singer-songwriter Christine McVie. Some traditional Mac fans may miss Christine's cool personality, or just the vibe from having 3 lead vocalists in one band..However the band's king and queen of drama for the last 30 years Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are here in full force. Young kids who do not know this band might wonder why the man in the band has a caption as LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM and the lady is called STEVIE NICKS I'm sure...There are some tense moments here, and some great musical moments. This documentary really shows what all goes into making an album in the 2000's. Fleetwood Mac, still being somewhat old fashioned skips the computers and opts to slicing tape with a razor blade to cut a guitar part in half...but that is just one of the things that makes them who they are.Not only does the viewer get an inside look into the production and musical aspect of making a CD but also the financial and business aspect. You get to see the band literally debating over whether a Double album would sell in today's slow economy, teen pop driven music world...Stevie Nicks seems somewhat distant from the idea, while Lindsey doesn't seem to care much about the financial issue.Not only that but you also get to witness a literally nervous band as they get ready to do their first tour without Christine, as well as their first tour since 1997. The tour rehearsals are my favorite part of the show.This is a great documentary...don't buy if you are expecting a concert, because it's not that...Don't buy if you expect Stevie Nicks to be twirling from room to room, you won't get that either...you get a behind the scenes look at one of rock's most successful bands trying to find their place in today's music world, while keeping their artistic integrity they worked so hard for.",4,Awesome documentary.,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,2663,"['already', 'saw', 'taped', 'documentary', 'VH1', 'when', 'aired', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'extras', 'what-so-ever', 'reason', 'could', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'put', 'together', '500', 'hours', 'footage', 'yet', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'manage', 'put', 'extra', 'scenes', '.they', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'add', 'extras', 'VH1', 'ALL', 'ACCESS', 'showed', 'advertising', 'documentary', 'so', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'DVD', 'taped', 'commercial', 'free', 'when', 'aired', 'VH1', 'bought', 'unfortunately', 'bought', 'PBS', 'said', 'had', 'extras', 'ANYWAY', 'documentary', 'magnificent', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'need', 'fan', 'rock', 'music', 'could', 'surely', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'documents', 'tense', 'making', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'first', 'album', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', '1987', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'album', 'keyboardist', 'sometime', 'singer-songwriter', 'Christine', 'McVie', 'traditional', 'Mac', 'fans', 'may', 'miss', 'Christine', 'cool', 'personality', 'just', 'vibe', 'having', '3', 'lead', 'vocalists', 'one', 'band..However', 'band', 'king', 'queen', 'drama', 'last', '30', 'years', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'are', 'here', 'full', 'force', 'Young', 'kids', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'band', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'man', 'band', 'caption', 'LINDSEY', 'BUCKINGHAM', 'lady', 'called', 'STEVIE', 'NICKS', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'here', 'great', 'musical', 'moments', 'documentary', 'really', 'what', 'making', 'album', '2000', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'still', 'being', 'somewhat', 'old', 'fashioned', 'computers', 'opts', 'slicing', 'tape', 'razor', 'blade', 'cut', 'guitar', 'part', 'half', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'who', 'are.Not', 'only', 'viewer', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'production', 'musical', 'aspect', 'making', 'CD', 'also', 'financial', 'business', 'aspect', 'get', 'see', 'band', 'literally', 'debating', 'Double', 'album', 'would', 'sell', 'today', 'slow', 'economy', 'teen', 'pop', 'driven', 'music', 'world', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'somewhat', 'distant', 'idea', 'Lindsey', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'much', 'financial', 'issue.Not', 'only', 'also', 'get', 'witness', 'literally', 'nervous', 'band', 'get', 'ready', 'do', 'first', 'tour', 'Christine', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'tour', '1997', 'tour', 'rehearsals', 'are', 'favorite', 'part', 'show.This', 'great', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'are', 'expecting', 'concert', 'not', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'expect', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'be', 'twirling', 'room', 'room', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'get', 'scenes', 'look', 'one', 'rock', 'most', 'successful', 'bands', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'today', 'music', 'world', 'keeping', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'worked', 'so', 'hard']",N/A

Fleetwood Mac is infamous for their obessive indulgences and drug usage - while that may all be in the past, one thing that they still have after all these years (aside from incredible talent) is DRAMA and GUESS who the drama queen is? Well - SURPRISE it's NOT Stevie Nicks. This is the making of their first studio album since 1987's Tango In The Night album, Lindsey's last before leaving the band after its release and rejoining in 1997. Not only is it an incredible look into the making of a GREAT album, which I highly recommend, but an AWESOME look into what we didn't see in the 70's and 80's behind the scenes.

844724,A2ZP8PIYL4EHTP,B0002SPPY6,"G. Vernon ""gv""","[46, 53]","If there was ever any doubt in the press that Lindsey Buckingham is an eccentric genius, those doubts are erased by ""Destiny Rules."" Fleetwood Mac has allowed the filmmakers a nearly-all-access pass to the recording of their first release since the 1987 ""Tango in the Night."" And as such we get to see Lindsey, Stevie and company in the most unprotected setting: a beautiful home rented for the recording of ""Say You Will."" There are fascinating glimpses of the creative process, including the ownership the songwriters take of their music and the difficulty in turning their babies over to a mixer.Lindsey lets it all hang out for the cameras: selfishness, self-centeredness, petty bickering, controlling possessiveness of the songs, grandiose overestimation of his share of responsibility for the record's outcome. And on top of it we see a father of a young family who just happens to be one of the great guitarists of all time. There's a segment near the beginning where Lindsey is sitting on a couch going for broke on the song ""Destiny Rules"" and he's just so relaxed and interacting with Mick Fleetwood almost casually while his fingers have a life all their own and it's awesome.""You keep writing songs like that and we'll make this a double-album yet,"" he tells Stevie almost offhandedly as they're listening to her demos for ""Say You Will."" It's a bigger comment than it seems at the time, as it turns out Lindsey has been petitioning for a double album from the get-go and as the record company drives the project toward a single disc, Lindsey's about ready to take his toys and go home. Fascinating stuff for the cameras, and bravo to Lindsey for letting it stay in the film. And thank heavens he didn't throw the ultimate temper tantrum, as ""Say You Will"" is Fleetwood Mac's best record since ""Rumors,"" easily besting the experimental ""Tusk"" or the corporate-tainted discs that followed ""Tusk.""Whether or not the mighty Mac heads back into the studio, this is one for the time capsule. If you're a fan who bought the awful ""Tango in the Night"" home video, with all of it's false and patently awful post-concert closeups of Stevie through a filtered lens, this movie is will be even more of a pleasure. An honest, no-holds-barred depiction of a great band going through all the processes that result in one great album.

I enjoyed the tug of war between Stevie and Lindsey ( they still argue, like they always did, but now do it in a more civilised manner, and it all seems to be for the betterment of the album.) Stevie seems to want the album to sound good AND  sell well, Lindsey seems to just want it to sound good and get good reviews. At least that's the impression I get ( other viewers might not.)

As mentioned, Christine's absent in the making of this one, but it doesn't make this fly-on-the-wall documentary any less interesting. The 79-minute running length flew by as we see what it takes to craft an 18(!) song CD in today's (well, in 2002's) music world. Personalities are highlighted along with the music, which makes the look into the recording process even more engaging. I bought this DVD after reading several other glowing reviews here, and I'm so glad I did--not only does it contain all of the aforementioned positives, but it also brought (for me, at least) a newly-found appreciation for the music on this album, which I admittedly wasn't blown over by, in any way, when I first bought the CD upon release.

His albums have always been critical successes with a modest impact on the marketplace.  Stevie Nicks has cannily sold her ethereal image and succeeded partly through a series of collaborations with top artists such as Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Prince.Nicks's songs for the ""Say You Will"" project seem to often retell the story of her rekindled romance with Lindsey during the ""Dance"" tour.  Her residual bitterness that he eventually left her to marry another woman and start a family underwrites a lot of the tension between them on this video.But the tensiion goes beyond that to bigger issues.  Lindsey is that rare artist who will sacrifice financial rewards to fulfill his vision.  In this case, he wanted to recreate the artistic success of ""Tusk,"" widely regarded as a masterpiece.  Sometimes he comes across as stubborn and relentless, since everyone in else in the band wants to just have as big a hit as possible.  Still, you have respect him as an artist who tries to stay true to his creative path.  It is also clear in this video that Lindsey plays the largest role not only in the production of Fleetwood Mac records, but in management decisions.Stevie Nicks, at one point, discusses the demographics of their audience, arguing that they should be realistic if they want a successful album.This is the focus of this documentary, a true gift for fans of Lindsey, Stevie, or Fleetwood Mac.
