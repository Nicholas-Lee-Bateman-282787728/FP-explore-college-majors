Comprised primarily of medical students at the University in Munich in 1942-1943, these people were some of the few that refused to bow under to Hitler's will - and for this, they paid with their lives.This movie depiction basically shows actions of the group from the time that Sophie Scholl arrives in Munich until the time of her execution along with her brother Hans, and their friend Christoph Probst.

192923,A2KQX8Q4RNYN4R,1585870420,Donald Negri,"[1, 1]","I join with others who have praised the content of the film and, at least in my opinion, thewonderful acting done by Lena Stolz as Sophie. Yes, it is somewhat dated and there is a bit of melodramatic overacting (especially from Hans and Gisele). But it's minor and far exceeded by the overall skill with which Verhoeven presents and depicts the events. The music in particular is well handled, between the drone sound at times of fear or danger, and the more lighthearted score during the times of joy.I do want to mention that there exists another version of the same film, which came out into the VHS rental market. From Teleculture. The difference with the original version is that this one is shorter by about 15 minutes. I wonder if it wasn't Verhoeven himself who did the editing because the two main scenes that get cut tighten the dramatic narrative and flow. And both occur at about the one hour point: the amazing emotional scene at the munitions plant between Sophie and the Russian girl is shortened, and then the Russia war scene that actually cuts the munitions plant scene in two is dropped. There are other snippets here and there but of little importance.In addition - and this is even more important - the rental VHS version is not wide screen like the original. It's cropped and full screen. Normally I don't like this, but in this case I think it improves the film. In the first place, this is a movie that has numerous scenes that are very intimate and don't need the widescreen. The cropped version increases both the intimacy and adds to the claustrophobic nature of much of the film.Finally, I would love to see a remastered DVD version. Both the original and the ""rental"" versions are somewhat washed out in color.ps - For years I used this film in my high school history courses. I suspect it would also go over quite well in any class studying existentialism (much of the dialogue seems to beactually written in this vein).No matter what format....this is a wonderful film dealing with a unique and very heroic group of young people.",5,a beautiful moving film,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2060,"['join', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'praised', 'content', 'film', 'least', 'opinion', 'thewonderful', 'acting', 'done', 'Lena', 'Stolz', 'Sophie', 'Yes', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'overacting', 'especially', 'Hans', 'Gisele', 'minor', 'far', 'exceeded', 'overall', 'skill', 'Verhoeven', 'presents', 'events', 'music', 'particular', 'well', 'handled', 'drone', 'sound', 'times', 'fear', 'danger', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'score', 'times', 'joy.I', 'do', 'want', 'mention', 'version', 'same', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'rental', 'market', 'Teleculture', 'difference', 'original', 'version', 'one', 'shorter', '15', 'minutes', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'Verhoeven', 'who', 'did', 'editing', 'two', 'main', 'scenes', 'get', 'cut', 'tighten', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'flow', 'occur', 'one', 'hour', 'point', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'scene', 'munitions', 'plant', 'Sophie', 'Russian', 'girl', 'shortened', 'then', 'Russia', 'war', 'scene', 'actually', 'munitions', 'plant', 'scene', 'two', 'dropped', 'are', 'other', 'snippets', 'here', 'there', 'little', 'importance.In', 'addition', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'rental', 'VHS', 'version', 'not', 'wide', 'screen', 'original', 'cropped', 'full', 'screen', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'case', 'think', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'movie', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'intimate', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'widescreen', 'cropped', 'version', 'increases', 'intimacy', 'claustrophobic', 'nature', 'much', 'film.Finally', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'version', 'original', 'rental', 'versions', 'are', 'somewhat', 'washed', 'out', 'color.ps', 'years', 'used', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'courses', 'suspect', 'would', 'also', 'go', 'quite', 'well', 'class', 'studying', 'existentialism', 'much', 'dialogue', 'beactually', 'written', 'vein', 'matter', 'what', 'format', '.this', 'wonderful', 'film', 'dealing', 'unique', 'very', 'heroic', 'group', 'young', 'people']",N/A
192924,APUHDIL2CEI3C,1585870420,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[19, 22]","One of the current ""hot topics"" regarding the Third Reich IN GERMANY is the issue of resistance to Hitler--where did it exist, what were the consequences.  The film ""The White Rose"" (also available in German on DVD) is an excellent film from 1982--a period when German films first began to deal with the ""reality"" of the Reich, experiences of the war, in a more realistic manner than the films of the 1950s such as ""Letters from Stalingrad"".  I refer to such German films as ""Das Boot"" (1981)(released in the U.S.), and ""The Wannsee Conference"" (1985).This film documents the Weisse Rose--a student group in Munich that was shut down by the Gestapo shortly after ""news from the front"" in the form of students who actually witnessed war crimes such as the massacre of prisoners began to filter through the curtain of propaganda.  The courage of these students, the idealism of youth, the evil of the state are well represented here.  The characters are well portrayed (with photos of the actual participants at the beginning of the film) and acted.  This film is one of the best arguments that reality is much more awesome than fiction--and predates by many years the exhibition of the 1990s which sparked great controversy by revealing the role of the Wehrmacht (the military, and das Heer, the Army) in crimes against humanity through killing of Jews by the Einsatzgruppen in Poland and on the Eastern Front).In this film we see young men in Army and Air Force (Luftwaffe) uniforms who come back to school in Munich, or on Urlaub (vacation or leave) from the Eastern front who have actually seen these crimes--prompting the main female involved to risk her life (she is ultimately sentenced to death by guillotine) to risk all in furthering the expansion of the resistance group to other cities.I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in World War II as a partial answer to the question:  ""Did German citizens know what horror their government was perpetrating on innocent human beings in their name?""  The answer is yes.  This film is highly relevant to hard questions asked by the Vietnam generation and what will become the ""War in Iraq"" generation.",5,Beyond the Myth of Resistance,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2163,"['One', 'current', 'hot', 'topics', 'regarding', 'Third', 'Reich', 'IN', 'GERMANY', 'issue', 'resistance', 'Hitler', 'where', 'did', 'exist', 'what', 'were', 'consequences', 'film', 'White', 'Rose', 'also', 'available', 'German', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'film', '1982', 'period', 'when', 'German', 'films', 'first', 'began', 'deal', 'reality', 'Reich', 'experiences', 'war', 'more', 'realistic', 'manner', 'films', '1950s', 'such', 'Letters', 'Stalingrad', 'refer', 'such', 'German', 'films', 'Das', 'Boot', '1981', 'released', 'U.S.', 'Wannsee', 'Conference', '1985', '.This', 'film', 'documents', 'Weisse', 'Rose', 'student', 'group', 'Munich', 'was', 'shut', 'down', 'Gestapo', 'shortly', 'news', 'front', 'form', 'students', 'who', 'actually', 'witnessed', 'war', 'crimes', 'such', 'massacre', 'prisoners', 'began', 'filter', 'curtain', 'propaganda', 'courage', 'students', 'idealism', 'youth', 'evil', 'state', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'photos', 'actual', 'participants', 'beginning', 'film', 'acted', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'arguments', 'reality', 'much', 'more', 'awesome', 'fiction', 'predates', 'many', 'years', 'exhibition', '1990s', 'sparked', 'great', 'controversy', 'revealing', 'role', 'Wehrmacht', 'military', 'das', 'Heer', 'Army', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'killing', 'Jews', 'Einsatzgruppen', 'Poland', 'Eastern', 'Front', '.In', 'film', 'see', 'young', 'men', 'Army', 'Air', 'Force', 'Luftwaffe', 'uniforms', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'school', 'Munich', 'Urlaub', 'vacation', 'leave', 'Eastern', 'front', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'crimes', 'prompting', 'main', 'female', 'involved', 'risk', 'life', 'ultimately', 'sentenced', 'death', 'guillotine', 'risk', 'furthering', 'expansion', 'resistance', 'group', 'other', 'cities.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'partial', 'answer', 'question', 'Did', 'German', 'citizens', 'know', 'what', 'horror', 'government', 'was', 'perpetrating', 'innocent', 'human', 'beings', 'name', 'answer', 'yes', 'film', 'highly', 'relevant', 'hard', 'questions', 'asked', 'Vietnam', 'generation', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'War', 'Iraq', 'generation']",N/A
