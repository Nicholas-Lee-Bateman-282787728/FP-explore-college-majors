Crawford,"[2, 3]","I enjoyed this movie although it's hard to think anyone could mistake Joyce for a guy even before the breast baring scene, which rates 5 stars ( Joyce has said that scene haunted her for the rest of her career which is a shame because she's a decent actress, see LA Law). The movie is filled with typical characters you find in these teenage flicks. A very young and starting out Sherilynn Fenn is in it trying to become Joyce's love interest. The actor who plays Joyce's younger brother does an excellant job and is quite funny.

341312,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6302862787,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 4]","Ah the 80's. You gotta love it. The films that came out of the 80's, most notably the teen films, have always been and will always be the best teens movies. A decent one will come along every now and then today, but the 80's still rule the teen genre. And surprise, surprise, this film is one of the few that wasn't done by John Hughes. As a child of the 80's, I grew up with films like these. This one in particular I must have seen a hundred times. The film centers around a young, pretty high schooler named Terry(played the beautiful and obviously very talented Joyce Hyser). Terry is all girl. Dresses in a lot of short, skin tight clothes(some of which are very, very pink), and stuff in her hair and all that. But when she loses out in a journalistic contest in one of her classes, she feels cheated. She feels that her work was better than what it was graded, but got the slip because she was a girl. This gets Terry to think that guys are treated better than girls simply because they are guys. Setting out to investigate this accusation, Terry cuts her hair and disguises herself as a teenage boy and enrolls in a different high school to find out the truth first hand. She runs afoul of the school bully(played by perennial 80's high school jerk, William Zabka of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Back To School""), and other people, but strikes a chord with shy, nerdy outcast Rick(Clayton Rohner). They build a buddy/buddy relationship that has Terry bringing Rick out of his shell and ends up trying to get him a date for the prom. What ends up of Terry's original purpose of dressing like a boy?. Well, you'll have to find out for yourselves. I am not going to say that the movie is very original, because it's not. Not just because of the dressing up as a guy, or in other films having guys dressing up as girls, but the plot is pretty transparent and you could tell how everything happens way before it actually does. What saves the film and keeps it better than most other 80's teen films, is that the cast is above average, especially Hyser and the hysterical Billy Jacoby, who plays her brother Buddy, and there are a number of moments of true humor and intelligence and heart. While most other films like this were driven by the exploits of raging hormones in teens, and this one no doubt got wrongfully accused of being one of them, it isn't. The teens are all more realistic, and you actually feel for Terry and her depression of not winning the journalism contest and how things are going for her. Hyser delivered a fine comedic performance, and why she didn't go on to bigger and better things is a real shame. Jacoby, as her brother Buddy, is one of the highlights of the film, and he delivers some of his sly dialogue with a sure hand. This film is pure 80's, and I love it. It's nothing special and it will never really be remembered, but it was a better than average teen comedy that strayed from the cluttered pack to make it's own impression. And it did. It's just too bad not too many people noticed.",3,It Came From The 80's!!,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,3020,"['Ah', '80', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'films', 'came', '80', 'most', 'notably', 'teen', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best', 'teens', 'movies', 'decent', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'now', 'then', 'today', '80', 'still', 'teen', 'genre', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'John', 'Hughes', 'child', '80', 'grew', 'up', 'films', 'one', 'particular', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'pretty', 'high', 'schooler', 'named', 'Terry', 'played', 'beautiful', 'obviously', 'very', 'talented', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'Terry', 'girl', 'lot', 'short', 'skin', 'tight', 'clothes', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'pink', 'stuff', 'hair', 'when', 'out', 'journalistic', 'contest', 'one', 'classes', 'cheated', 'work', 'was', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'graded', 'got', 'slip', 'was', 'girl', 'Terry', 'think', 'guys', 'are', 'treated', 'better', 'girls', 'simply', 'are', 'guys', 'Setting', 'out', 'investigate', 'accusation', 'Terry', 'hair', 'teenage', 'boy', 'enrolls', 'different', 'high', 'school', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'first', 'hand', 'afoul', 'school', 'bully', 'played', 'perennial', '80', 'high', 'school', 'jerk', 'William', 'Zabka', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Back', 'School', 'other', 'people', 'chord', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'outcast', 'Rick', 'Clayton', 'Rohner', 'build', 'buddy/buddy', 'relationship', 'Terry', 'bringing', 'Rick', 'shell', 'up', 'trying', 'get', 'date', 'prom', 'What', 'Terry', 'original', 'purpose', 'dressing', 'boy', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'find', 'out', 'yourselves', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'movie', 'very', 'original', 'not', 'Not', 'just', 'dressing', 'up', 'guy', 'other', 'films', 'having', 'guys', 'dressing', 'up', 'girls', 'plot', 'pretty', 'transparent', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'everything', 'way', 'actually', 'What', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'other', '80', 'teen', 'films', 'cast', 'above', 'average', 'especially', 'Hyser', 'hysterical', 'Billy', 'Jacoby', 'who', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'are', 'number', 'moments', 'true', 'humor', 'intelligence', 'heart', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'driven', 'exploits', 'raging', 'hormones', 'teens', 'one', 'doubt', 'got', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'being', 'one', ""n't"", 'teens', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'actually', 'feel', 'Terry', 'depression', 'not', 'winning', 'journalism', 'contest', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'Hyser', 'delivered', 'fine', 'comedic', 'performance', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'real', 'shame', 'Jacoby', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'sly', 'dialogue', 'sure', 'hand', 'film', 'pure', '80', 'love', 'nothing', 'special', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'remembered', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'strayed', 'cluttered', 'pack', 'make', 'own', 'impression', 'did', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'noticed']",N/A

341315,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,6302862787,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[4, 5]","Love the film.  Been watching it since it appeared on cable in the 80s.  Should be listed alongside the best of 80s teen comedies, Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, etc.  Extremely likable film with a really fun cast.  The actress who plays Terry is absolutely adorable.  She's older than me, and I simply fell in love with her charms.  The kid brother is hilarious.  And the guy Terry helps out in school is on the good side of three dimensional (love the James Brown angle) and very memorable.  Great soundtrack too.Now, the DVD...I had a great time watching it this way (last time it was a used VHS, and I also have a VHS I recorded myself).  The transfer isn't bad at all.  A little grainy at the beginning, but it gets better and the color/clarity of the picture seems very good to me on my 42"" Plasma.  I can't be more thrilled with this and sad I delayed getting the film this way.  I plan to watch it a lot more than I have with VHS.Now, I know it's not widescreen but there is a lot of picture here.  I read somewhere the film is presented in open matte, which is what you get before the picture is cut down to widescreen for theaters.  That doesn't mean this is better, since much of the included area was a planned cut anyway.  Often you get boom mics and other ""stuff"" they knew would be cut out.  But at least for a full screen transfer it looks very good.Blu ray?  I wouldn't think twice about upgrading.  Seriously...  this film with a few others (perhaps Spring Break, Summer School, Valley Girl...others?) in a blu ray set would be fantastic.I'd give this a high recommendation for fans who just want the film.  Now, I'm giving this 3.5 stars due to the lack of any worthy extras (3 trailers for other films?  Why?  The trailer for this film is on youtube!  Note to the company that produced this DVD:  Sure would be great to have AT LEAST the trailer on the DVD... dopes!

Do NOT be put off or fooled by the cover art. The cover gives the impression that this is (a beyond R) movie. Rather, it is a well done movie that offers us things to think about as well as a great story.In her school, Terry is the popular girl who most people like. She has a college boyfriend who appears nice (at least sometimes). But she thinks her school work is not being taken seriously, because she is a cute girl. Her teacher gives her valid reasons why her work isn't top notch, but she continues to think being a cute girl is the real reason. To make a long story short, she decides to disguise herself as a boy and attend another school. But even here, a teacher tells her that her work isn't top notch. (Interesting!)The obvious plot here is that she is pretending to be a guy. But, there is yet another plot involved. Instead of being Miss Popular, she is now Mr. Geek. And she runs into an outcast named Rick (who she would NOT have met on her own grounds). She pretends she just wants to help him, but she finds she is falling in love with him. But for obvious reasons, Rick just wants to be friends, and Terry can not just remove her disguise at any moment. And rather predictably, a cute woman (Sandy) finds Terry attractive. (Dangers of disguisng yourself as one of the opposite sex!)It happened in Shakespeare's ""12th Night"" and ""As You Like It.""Another great aspect of this movie is how Rick gradually goes from being an outcast to quite popular. And his final showdown with the school bully Zabka is predictable, but still well done.Another character worth some attention is Terry's younger brother Buddy. He makes the most of his secondary role. He seems mostly driven by his hormones. But in his own way, he tells Terry how absurd she is being when she thinks her writing was rejected because she was a woman. He certainly enjoys the troubles Terry goes through as she tries to keep her double life a secret, but he does help her when he can (even if he can't do it with a straight face). And when he sees his sister attacked by Zabka, he wastes no time in helping her the best he can.Zabka seems to be the typical school bully, but we are allowed a brief moment of sympathy for him at one point. He is attacked twice in 'unorthodox ways,' and he can only say: ""Where do these people learn to fight?""Overall, it's a great movie about a high school girl's journey of self discovery, as well as getting a bigger picture of what is around her. (Not to mention an outcast guy suddenly becoming well liked and popular.) And we shouldn't neglect the fact that the relationship between Terry and her brother Buddy improves as well.",4,More Profound Than We May Have Thought,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,2761,"['Normally', 'do', 'not', 'comment', 'cover', 'art', 'product', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'feel', 'inclined', 'Do', 'NOT', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fooled', 'cover', 'art', 'cover', 'impression', 'R', 'movie', 'Rather', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'things', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'story.In', 'school', 'Terry', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'college', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'nice', 'least', 'sometimes', 'school', 'work', 'not', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'cute', 'girl', 'teacher', 'valid', 'reasons', 'why', 'work', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'think', 'being', 'cute', 'girl', 'real', 'reason', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'disguise', 'boy', 'attend', 'school', 'even', 'here', 'teacher', 'work', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'Interesting', 'obvious', 'plot', 'here', 'pretending', 'be', 'guy', 'yet', 'plot', 'involved', 'Instead', 'being', 'Miss', 'Popular', 'now', 'Mr.', 'Geek', 'outcast', 'named', 'Rick', 'who', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'met', 'own', 'grounds', 'just', 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Rick', 'just', 'be', 'friends', 'Terry', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'remove', 'disguise', 'moment', 'rather', 'predictably', 'cute', 'woman', 'Sandy', 'Terry', 'attractive', 'Dangers', 'disguisng', 'one', 'opposite', 'sex', 'happened', 'Shakespeare', '12th', 'Night', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie', 'how', 'Rick', 'gradually', 'being', 'outcast', 'quite', 'popular', 'final', 'showdown', 'school', 'bully', 'Zabka', 'predictable', 'still', 'well', 'done.Another', 'character', 'attention', 'Terry', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'most', 'secondary', 'role', 'mostly', 'driven', 'hormones', 'own', 'way', 'Terry', 'how', 'absurd', 'being', 'when', 'writing', 'was', 'rejected', 'was', 'woman', 'certainly', 'troubles', 'Terry', 'keep', 'double', 'life', 'secret', 'help', 'when', 'can', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'straight', 'face', 'when', 'sister', 'attacked', 'Zabka', 'time', 'helping', 'best', 'be', 'typical', 'school', 'bully', 'are', 'allowed', 'brief', 'moment', 'sympathy', 'one', 'point', 'attacked', 'twice', ""'unorthodox"", 'ways', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Where', 'do', 'people', 'learn', 'fight', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'bigger', 'picture', 'what', 'Not', 'mention', 'outcast', 'guy', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'well', 'liked', 'popular', 'should', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'fact', 'relationship', 'Terry', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

What teenage girl could independently go ""undercover"" as a teenage male student in another High School for the sake of a school newspaper article?  Well, of course, it can't be done.  If our heroine truly were as vain as she appears to be, she would not wreck her good looks just for an award.  Indeed, for most the response to being denied an award because of our sex is most likely indignation and outrage rather than concocting some outlandish plot to ""show `em what I'm really made of"".All that being said, this is a delicious comedy.  Those that complain that Joyce Heiser can't cut it as a ""male"" miss the point.  If Heiser were any more convincing as a male half the humor would fall flat and we would run the risk of turning into just another piece of feminist party line storytelling.Instead we find Heiser discovering that while she had been treated unfairly she was a frivolous person.  The insight she gains in seeing the world from another viewpoint matures her and leads her to find love where she never would have looked.  Moreover, while she triumphs and proves her point, Heiser comes to find out that she isn't the only one who can be hurt by other people.  Her entire plot was cruel to the person she learned to care about most during her adventure.But this analysis while true also misleads.  The seriousness of Just One Of The Guys is vastly overwhelmed by the girl-in-disguise comedy this movie plays so well.  The story does take place in the 1980's we have all come to hate so much; but the story excels over these trappings.",4,UNDERCOVER  ANGEL FINDS TRUE LOVE AS A GUY,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,1641,"['one', 'dumb', 'movies', 'like', 'lot', 'set', 'up', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'What', 'teenage', 'girl', 'could', 'independently', 'go', 'undercover', 'teenage', 'male', 'student', 'High', 'School', 'sake', 'school', 'newspaper', 'article', 'Well', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'heroine', 'truly', 'were', 'as', 'vain', 'be', 'would', 'not', 'wreck', 'good', 'looks', 'just', 'award', 'Indeed', 'most', 'response', 'being', 'denied', 'award', 'sex', 'most', 'likely', 'indignation', 'outrage', 'rather', 'concocting', 'outlandish', 'plot', 'show', 'em', 'what', ""'m"", 'really', 'made', '.All', 'being', 'said', 'delicious', 'comedy', 'complain', 'Joyce', 'Heiser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cut', 'male', 'point', 'Heiser', 'were', 'more', 'convincing', 'male', 'humor', 'would', 'fall', 'flat', 'would', 'run', 'risk', 'turning', 'just', 'piece', 'feminist', 'party', 'line', 'storytelling.Instead', 'find', 'Heiser', 'discovering', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'was', 'frivolous', 'person', 'insight', 'gains', 'seeing', 'world', 'viewpoint', 'find', 'love', 'where', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'Moreover', 'point', 'Heiser', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'hurt', 'other', 'people', 'entire', 'plot', 'was', 'cruel', 'person', 'learned', 'care', 'most', 'adventure.But', 'analysis', 'true', 'also', 'seriousness', 'Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'vastly', 'overwhelmed', 'girl-in-disguise', 'comedy', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'take', 'place', '1980', 'have', 'come', 'hate', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'excels', 'trappings']",N/A

341335,A3L2U581LL17EB,6302862787,Eric,"[2, 4]","I happened to come across Just one of the Guys on TV the other day, and with absolutely nothing else to do that day, I decided, what the heck, why not just give this 80's teen sex farce a shot.  At any rate, it was bound to be better than Porky's and I might even get a few cheap laughs in the process.  To my surprise, Just One of the Guys turned out to be one of the better teen comedies I've seen in a long, long time (I was no fan of American Pie and its kin), thanks in no small part to Joyce Hyser.The premise is gimmicky.  Basically, hottie teen Terry (Joyce Hyser) decides to dress up like a guy and prove that she can get her previously rejected article published if she were a man.  Well, she ends up befriending a loner named Rick (Claton Rohner), but does so while in drag.  She thinks it's up to her to help him out by getting him a date for the prom, but whatta you know, she starts to fall for him and the rest can't be hard to guess from there.Okay, I realize I just made this movie sound pretty bad, but if you actually give it a shot, you might find it rather enjoyable.  Surprisingly enough, there's not that much nudity to speak of (mostly male, though Hyser does give us a quick shot of her (...)) and the humor isn't half as smutty as I'd expected.  Rather, the humor we're given is Terry's balancing act between her ""old"" self and this new identity she's created. Admittedly, not all the jokes work, but there are a lot of inspired moments that keep the momentum going.  Take, for instance, the girl (Sherilyn Fenn) who has a crush on Terry; what could have been a set-up for a cruel and/or tasteless gross-out is given a little weight, and the way this subplot is resolved is satisfying and actually even a little sweet.As you can see, the film prefers to use its premise not for gross-out gags, but to build a cute love story, and yeah, it does a pretty good job at that.  Hyser and Rohner have appealing chemistry, though it's Hyser who gets the lion's share of the work.  Having to balance between playing a very pretty girl and a convincing male teen isn't easy, but she pulls it off with flying colors.Obviously, the film is going to end with Rick discovering Terry's real identity.  That scene is handled rather well, but I found the epilogue a little too abrupt to be entirely satisfying.  I found myself caring a lot about these characters; would have been nice to know where they ended up from there.But enough with the quibbles.  Sure, Just One of the Guys isn't a great movie, not by a long shot, but it takes the time to make us care about the characters and situation, and while the lack of potty humor might not make it as gut-bustingly hilarious (if potty humor is your preference, that is) as some of today's offerings, the fact that the movie touched me made it superior to just about any other teen comedy I've seen in a long, long time.",3,"Not great, but very charming and likeable.",1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,2879,"['happened', 'come', 'Just', 'one', 'Guys', 'TV', 'other', 'day', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'day', 'decided', 'what', 'heck', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'give', '80', 'teen', 'sex', 'farce', 'shot', 'rate', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'better', 'Porky', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'few', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'process', 'surprise', 'Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'teen', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'fan', 'American', 'Pie', 'kin', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'Joyce', 'Hyser.The', 'premise', 'gimmicky', 'Basically', 'hottie', 'teen', 'Terry', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'dress', 'up', 'guy', 'prove', 'can', 'get', 'previously', 'rejected', 'article', 'published', 'were', 'man', 'Well', 'up', 'befriending', 'loner', 'named', 'Rick', 'Claton', 'Rohner', 'so', 'drag', 'up', 'help', 'out', 'getting', 'date', 'prom', 'know', 'fall', 'rest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'guess', 'there.Okay', 'realize', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'sound', 'pretty', 'bad', 'actually', 'give', 'shot', 'might', 'find', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'nudity', 'speak', 'mostly', 'male', 'Hyser', 'give', 'quick', 'shot', 'humor', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'smutty', ""'d"", 'expected', 'Rather', 'humor', ""'re"", 'given', 'Terry', 'balancing', 'act', 'old', 'self', 'new', 'identity', 'created', 'Admittedly', 'not', 'jokes', 'work', 'are', 'lot', 'inspired', 'moments', 'keep', 'momentum', 'going', 'Take', 'instance', 'girl', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'who', 'crush', 'Terry', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set-up', 'cruel', 'and/or', 'tasteless', 'gross-out', 'given', 'little', 'weight', 'way', 'subplot', 'resolved', 'satisfying', 'actually', 'even', 'little', 'sweet.As', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'prefers', 'use', 'premise', 'not', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'build', 'cute', 'love', 'story', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Hyser', 'Rohner', 'have', 'appealing', 'chemistry', 'Hyser', 'who', 'lion', 'share', 'work', 'Having', 'balance', 'playing', 'very', 'pretty', 'girl', 'convincing', 'male', 'teen', ""n't"", 'easy', 'off', 'flying', 'colors.Obviously', 'film', 'going', 'end', 'Rick', 'discovering', 'Terry', 'real', 'identity', 'scene', 'handled', 'rather', 'well', 'found', 'epilogue', 'little', 'too', 'abrupt', 'be', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'found', 'caring', 'lot', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'know', 'where', 'ended', 'up', 'there.But', 'enough', 'quibbles', 'Sure', 'Just', 'One', 'Guys', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'time', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'situation', 'lack', 'potty', 'humor', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'gut-bustingly', 'hilarious', 'potty', 'humor', 'preference', 'today', 'offerings', 'fact', 'movie', 'touched', 'made', 'superior', 'just', 'other', 'teen', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time']",N/A

341343,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302862787,JGC,"[4, 5]","""Just One of the Guys"" has to be one of my favorite movies from the 80's because it is one of the very best movies from this me-loving decade! This movie has it all! Hot girls! Hot guys! Fast cars. H*rny teens. Beaches! But I'm getting ahead of myself...Joyce Hyser plays Terry Griffith. On the outside she's a typical teenage girl. She's beautiful and often causes her middle aged teachers to stare at her legs. But on the inside, Terry's not the typical brain-dead tramp. She has aspirations of being a writer but her high school teacher dismisses her because of her gender, telling her that she should marry well or find ""some other career!""With the help of her s*x-crazed little brother, Buddy (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby,) Terry transforms herself into a rather passable teenage boy (picture, a cross between the Karate Kid and Jo from ""The Facts of Life!"") Except for a little bit of overacting (I've never seen a guy walk the way she did,) she was able to pull it off. Once Terry is confident that she can pass for a man, she transfers to another school (just for a week) so that she can enter their district writing contest (as a boy) and prove to everyone that she has what it takes!Over the course of the week at her new school Terry has many pratfalls and adventures. It was so funny when she went to the boys locker room on her first day. On her second day of school she started to meet more people and attract the attention of some unsuspecting girls! That's when she befriended Rick Moorehouse (Clayton Rohner.)Rick was the same guy who helped Terry on her first day when Greg (William Zabka) picked her up and threw her into some bushes. Greg Tolan was the typical high school bully. I think William Zabka was in just about every 80's movie, playing the same pain in the @ss.Terry and Rick become fast-friends and Terry vows to help Rick meet some babes. For some reason Rick had difficultly meeting girls. Maybe because he was somewhat shy and introverted. Terry took Rick out and got him some new clothes and he did start to become more popular. Wasn't it so sad and hateful when that dlck-head, Greg poured food all over Rick's new shirt. Terry got it right when she said to Rick, ""you should have punched him in the face.""Throughout the week at her new school Terry neglects her boyfriend and starts falling in love with Rick! Things start to really heat up at the prom because Terry and Rick double dated with 2 other girls. But Terry doesn't want to see Rick with any other girl. The sadness and desperation in her eyes was very believable when she saw Rick with his date.Buddy and Terry's boyfriend show up at the prom just as the resident-bully, Greg Tollen starts picking a fight with poor Terry. It was so funny as Buddy jumped on his back to get him off his sister because Greg was at least twice his size (that totally reminded me of something my little brother would have done.)Terry finally corners Rick at the prom to tell him that she loves him. Rick is totally confused (he still thinks that Terry is a man who is likely g-a-y.) So what does Terry do? She rips open her shirt to expose her huge knockers! This still doesn't convince Rick, so on the dance floor Terry grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss on his mouth; of course, while all the others look on in disgust. But Rick doesn't want anything to do with her.Poor Terry is totally down in the dumps. Because I think she realized that what she did had some serious repercussions. Yes, she did get her article. But she also fell in love with another man (and who wouldn't? Rick is so adorable.) Oh well, at least Buddy finally got lucky!The one thing I would have loved to have heard was Terry's newspaper article. They showed her writing it and they showed her teacher (from her first school) praising it, but that was all. It would have been great to have a voice-over as she was typing so we could have gotten a better idea on what was in her head.Unfortunately, this film is an extremely underrated movie. (That is evidenced by the fact that it does not have a special edition DVD, it is rarely shown on network TV and because many 80's movie fans do not know about it!) I only first watched this movie a few years ago. I'm not exactly sure why this movie is so unknown. Perhaps the idea of a woman dressing up like a man is hard for people to contemplate; it's not like when a man dresses up as a woman in a movie because that's always done in such a screw-ball way. When a woman dresses up as a man there's usually always a sense of seriousness behind it (another great movie under this same umbrella of inter-dressing isYentl.)There are a few crude jokes in the movie. But that just added to it's comedy. Unless you're a total prude you won't be offended! I also love this movie because Terry didn't scream and cry the dreaded and overly-used s*xual harassment. Nope! This gal decided to be proactive (and provocative!) instead of reactive and by doing so she solved her pickle!Welcome to the 80's!",5,Dude looks like a lady,1202774400,"02 12,

In both, a young woman disguises herself as a male for academic reasons (Yentl to study the Torah and Terry for journalism).

Still, the humor holds up even if the plot was ridiculous (Terry actually changes schools with no identification, doesn't flunk the school she is not attending, pulls it all off without parents finding out (they are missing from the entire film)).For those who are interested, you can check out Yentl with Barbara Streisand, or you can read the original (and better) Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy by Isaac Bashevis Singer (it at least makes sense).",4,Teen Version of Yentl,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,1171,"['Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'teenaged', 'version', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'movie', 'Yentl', 'young', 'woman', 'male', 'academic', 'reasons', 'Yentl', 'study', 'Torah', 'Terry', 'journalism', 'main', 'difference', 'Terry', 'only', 'sexist', 'split', 'Yentl', 'reality.so', 'girl', 'becomes', 'guy', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'while', 'disguised', 'guy', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'win', 'guy', 'when', 'been', 'living', 'lie.In', 'end', 'order', 'convince', 'love', 'interest', 'really', 'woman', 'Terry', 'flash', 'breasts', 'Barbara', 'did', 'same', 'was', 'camera', 'shot', 'then', 'obligatory', 'topless', 'shot', 'PG-13', 'movie.Unlike', 'Yentl', 'much', 'more', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'teens', 'Still', 'humor', 'up', 'even', 'plot', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Terry', 'actually', 'schools', 'identification', ""n't"", 'flunk', 'school', 'not', 'attending', 'off', 'parents', 'finding', 'out', 'are', 'missing', 'entire', 'film', '.For', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'Yentl', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'can', 'read', 'original', 'better', 'Yentl', 'Yeshiva', 'Boy', 'Isaac', 'Bashevis', 'Singer', 'least', 'sense']",N/A

She's got a great body, she's popular, she dates a guy in high school, and she knows what she wants out of life--to be a journalist. When Terry enters a contest at school to win an internship with the local newspaper, she's surprised when her entry isn't picked as one of the best. Convinced that her entry was one of the best, and that it's her looks that prevented her from being chosen, Terry decides to pose as a guy and re-enter the same article at a rival high school. Of course hilarity and hijinks ensue, with Terry trying to get selected for the internship, make friends at her new school, and manage to maintain her relationship despite her hectic life.Okay, so when this movie came out I was 5 years old, but I remember watching it on television countless times during my childhood. Just One of the Guys is one of those movies that will always remind me of being a kid. So when I bought it recently, I expected that it would be a little cheesy (it was), a little dated (for sure), and maybe just a bit over the top (of course). I was right on all counts. What I didn't count on was the fact that this movie just gets better with age. It's as funny now as it was when I was kid because I now see all sorts of ""mature"" jokes that I didn't get back then.

The story centers around a journalism student (played by Joyce Hyser) who is trying to get an article submitted to a local newspaper (which in turn would lead to a summer job at the paper).  When her teacher refuses to submit the article (because of what she perceives as sexism, she enrolls in a new school as a guy in hopes of getting one submitted.  From there you get all the wacky hijinks you would expect.It is a very underrated teen comedy.  Not on the level of Fast Times or Breakfast Club, but certainly better than some of what was being put out in the mid 1980s as teen movies.  It did not try to take itself too seriously for the most part, but did touch on issues of sexism and homophobia.  The humor  and sex content was pretty tame (especially when compared against what is put out these days) and did not just rely on the fact that Joyce Hyser was extremely hot. In fact she was covered up for most of the movie.  Although she and Sherilyn Fenn were put in a couple nice outfits during the movie.  And of course the flashing scene where she proved she was a girl was spectacular.For those who grew up in the 1980s or just a fan of the 1980s comedies, this is definitely worth adding to your collection.

There must have been several (or maybe reletively few) women in the past who did what Barbara's character did - dress up as a man in order to gain knowledge or escape her confines.  Such happens to Terry, where she takes Yentle and turns it into a semi raunchy 80s teen sex comedy.Terry is frustrated that she is losing out on her dreams in journalism because she feels opportunities are not knocking due to her being a woman.  In an experiment to find out if it is true if boys have more choices.  In a WAY pre ""Boys Don't Cry"" make over, Terry becomes her alter ego - also named Terry (notice it's gender neutral) and starts afresh at her new school as a man.  She befriends an ecclectic circle of friends - that creepy guy with the insects, those two Star Trek people who like to pretend they're space aliens, etc.  All the while avoiding her boyfriend and her parents just happen to be out of town to question why it is she suddenly looks like Ellen Degenerus around the house.This was an amusing experiment and sitcom situation, but it wasn't laugh out loud kind of funny.  Terry's perpetually aroused brother allowed for some pathetically funny attempts at impressing girls.  The guy she sets her sights on as a guinea pig in her experiment who she eventually falls for is oh so not hot after she makes him over.  If anything he looked more appealing in the nerdy clothes.  And that gal who was chasing after her when she thought Terry was a boy?  ""He looks like the Karate Kid, I've got to have him"".  I don't know where to start with that statement, I just don't.  And she ends up banging her dorky brother after it is reveiled that brother Terry is actually sister Terry.  Hmmm ... I guess skanks just heal faster.The humor was jeuvinile, but not as smutty as it could have been.  And truth be told, I was disappointed as it had junior high school mentality, was definiatly smutty, but it wasn't clever and witty, if that makes any sense (think the American Pie movies).

Getting a short haircut, wearing baggy clothes and deepening her voice, Terry goes undercover at high school.

Finally Terry can't hide her feelings for Rick and the prom, she reveals her true identity by flashing Rick.

Never having seen it before, I wasn't drawn to it to remember scenes from the past as some others have noted. Instead, I was caught unaware by a film that provided more than I expected.  The movie spins a familiar tale about what happens when one gender disguises itself as the other- with the usual consequent, revelations.  The variation this time is that pretty girls can write serious journalism, too, especially if they're not judged on their appearance.It is essentially, typical harmless teen-exploitiation. There are the obligatory scenes with a school bully intimidating a geek, only to be shamed by both the girl in question and her ""buddy"" who, of course, eventually becomes her love interest. There's lots of running around, several moments of embarrassment, and an undercurrent that everyone is over-sexed and under . . .  well, you know. Otherwise, there wouldn't be too much here to note, except for the actor who plays the main character. Joyce Hyser will not wow you with her delivery and her acting ability leaves something to be desired; but it doesn't matter. She is simply magnetic.

Believing that she's lost a journalism contest because she's a woman, high school student Joyce Hyser disguises herself as a boy in order to see how the other half lives.Her investigation leads her to the discovery of some interesting truths about how men and women treat each other in social and romantic situations. The screenplay by co-producers Jeff Franklin (a veteran TV scribe) and Dennis Feldman nicely balances the sex-driven gags with more character-driven material, which is well delivered by Hyser, Clayton Rohner as her eccentric pal, and especially Billy Jacoby as her perpetually aroused brother; the capable cast also includes Sherilyn Fenn and Arye Gross. 1980's music fans should also appreciate the soundtrack, which features tracks by Berlin, Lindsay Buckingham, and the Stooges. --Paul GaitaAlong the way, she meets & falls for a gold-hearted nerd Rick Morehouse(Clayton Rohner)who becomes her pet project and after helping him through an image makeover & encouraging him to start talking to girls resulting in him taking the most popular girl Deborah(Deborah Goodrich)in school to the high school prom.After Terri deals with numerous episodes in and out of school, including the fending off a group of bullies instigated by jealous bodybuilder bully Greg Tolan(Billy Zabka)who also played the pompous high school bully in THE KARATE KID in the Summer of 1984, dealing with Terri's arrogant possessive college boyfriend Kevin(Leigh McCloskey), and being set up by a blind date with a potential new girlfriend Sandy(Sherilyn Fenn), Terri manages to get accepted as one of the guys.At the conclusion; the hell-bent Greg picks a fight with Rick who ultimately turns the tables in front of the entire prom while Kevin unexpectedly & finally discovers what's been going on when Terri has no choice, but to reveal herself to Rick by proving to him she's not a guy after all & dumps Kevin.Eventually; Terri returns to her own high school & her article finally gets printed in the newspaper, she recieves high commendations from her teacher & friends & finally earns her dream job at the newspaper office, Rick forgives Terri and they become an item.JUST ONE OF THE GUYS ranked number 48 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the ""50 Best High School Movies"" after it's theatrical release on Friday April 26, 1985 and amassed $11,528,900 at the box office in the Spring of 1985.JUST ONE OF THE GUYS also had some cool 80's songs like*Just One Of The Guys by Shalamar*Girls Got Something Boys Ain't Got by Midnight Star*Jealous by Berlin*Hard Way by Brock/Davis*Trouble by Lindsay Buckingham",4,Where no woman has ever gone before,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2743,"['Though', 'marketed', 'raunchy', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'agrave', 'Porky', 'Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'amusing', 'well-acted', 'comic', 'riff', 'gender', 'roles', 'Believing', 'lost', 'journalism', 'contest', 'woman', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'boy', 'order', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'lives.Her', 'investigation', 'discovery', 'interesting', 'truths', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'treat', 'other', 'social', 'romantic', 'situations', 'screenplay', 'co-producers', 'Jeff', 'Franklin', 'veteran', 'TV', 'scribe', 'Dennis', 'Feldman', 'nicely', 'sex-driven', 'gags', 'more', 'character-driven', 'material', 'well', 'delivered', 'Hyser', 'Clayton', 'Rohner', 'eccentric', 'pal', 'especially', 'Billy', 'Jacoby', 'perpetually', 'aroused', 'brother', 'capable', 'cast', 'also', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'Arye', 'Gross', '1980', 'music', 'fans', 'should', 'also', 'appreciate', 'soundtrack', 'tracks', 'Berlin', 'Lindsay', 'Buckingham', 'Stooges', 'Paul', 'GaitaAlong', 'way', 'gold-hearted', 'nerd', 'Rick', 'Morehouse', 'Clayton', 'Rohner', 'who', 'pet', 'project', 'helping', 'image', 'makeover', 'encouraging', 'start', 'talking', 'girls', 'resulting', 'taking', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'Deborah', 'Deborah', 'Goodrich', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'prom.After', 'Terri', 'deals', 'numerous', 'episodes', 'school', 'including', 'fending', 'off', 'group', 'bullies', 'instigated', 'jealous', 'bodybuilder', 'bully', 'Greg', 'Tolan', 'Billy', 'Zabka', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'pompous', 'high', 'school', 'bully', 'THE', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'Summer', '1984', 'dealing', 'Terri', 'arrogant', 'possessive', 'college', 'boyfriend', 'Kevin', 'Leigh', 'McCloskey', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'potential', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Sandy', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'Terri', 'get', 'accepted', 'one', 'guys.At', 'conclusion', 'hell-bent', 'Greg', 'fight', 'Rick', 'who', 'ultimately', 'tables', 'front', 'entire', 'prom', 'Kevin', 'unexpectedly', 'finally', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'when', 'Terri', 'choice', 'reveal', 'Rick', 'proving', 'not', 'guy', 'dumps', 'Kevin.Eventually', 'Terri', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'article', 'finally', 'printed', 'newspaper', 'high', 'commendations', 'teacher', 'friends', 'finally', 'dream', 'job', 'newspaper', 'office', 'Rick', 'Terri', 'become', 'item.JUST', 'ONE', 'THE', 'GUYS', 'ranked', 'number', '48', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'list', '50', 'Best', 'High', 'School', 'Movies', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Friday', 'April', '26', '1985', 'amassed', '11,528,900', 'box', 'office', 'Spring', '1985.JUST', 'ONE', 'THE', 'GUYS', 'also', 'had', 'cool', '80', 'songs', 'like*Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'Shalamar*Girls', 'Got', 'Something', 'Boys', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Got', 'Midnight', 'Star*Jealous', 'Berlin*Hard', 'Way', 'Brock/Davis*Trouble', 'Lindsay', 'Buckingham']",N/A

It follows the formula -- but it doesn't.  Its comedy is three-dimensional.  Although it has much to say about teen angst and growing up, it never takes itself too seriously, so we can laugh along the way.  Even the class bully is handled with a sense of humor.  You hate him, but that's okay because so does everyone else.Is the movie dated?  Yes, in many respects it represents its decade -- the 80s.  But its humor and its message have not dimmed with the years.  It's not just a kid's movie, either.  I've watched it many times, and at well over 40, I'm no kid.  As for Joyce Hyser, she carries the film with grace and humor and a range that would make most of the &quot;big stars&quot; of the movies today jealous (if they understood what she was doing).  And -- as has been noted by another reviewer -- only Leonard Maltin among the &quot;official&quot; critics gives this movie a chance.  I hope it comes out on DVD, and that it includes an interview with its star and some of the other principals.  A real sleeper.
