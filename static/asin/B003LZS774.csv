1353844,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003LZS774,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","There is no possible comment on such a thriller since any detail would lead you to the truth, the last minute of the film when it is all revealed that three people can hold so many secrets and so many false truths and true lies that you will never imagine life as still possible on the surface of this earth.First you can always get away with a murder, though it is more difficult to get away from a secret. The secret does not go with you and stays behind but catches upon you absolutely all the time. At times the murder can come back too but you are ready to face it since you know it will come back, sooner or later. But the secret you think, dumb as you are, that it is buried in your own mind and no one knows about it. You have it all wrong. It takes one person behind who remembers for you to be tricked, trapped, doomed, for you to trip on that stumbling block.With these two lines bring together three people in which two of them, hence three couples share one secret per couple. A knows something about B who knows something about C who knows something about A and the vicious circle closes onto a dead end in the shape of a never opening round rail that works forever and ever like an eternal merry-go-round. That's a hamster's wheel to which each one of those three animals is chained and they have lost the keys to liberate the handcuffs, the manacles or other steel fetters.Enjoy that film. It is so dense that you may even believe it is true and at the end you will feel relieved and redeemed and then suddenly you will relapse into the doom of that infernal basic fact of life: you can always get away with a murder but you will never get away from a secret.Think hard and answer that simple double question: what crime did you commit and what secret do you hide?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,You will not survive this one unscathed,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1801,"['possible', 'comment', 'thriller', 'detail', 'would', 'lead', 'truth', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'when', 'revealed', 'three', 'people', 'can', 'hold', 'so', 'many', 'secrets', 'so', 'many', 'false', 'truths', 'true', 'lies', 'will', 'never', 'imagine', 'life', 'still', 'possible', 'surface', 'earth.First', 'can', 'always', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'more', 'difficult', 'get', 'away', 'secret', 'secret', 'not', 'go', 'stays', 'catches', 'absolutely', 'time', 'times', 'murder', 'can', 'come', 'back', 'too', 'are', 'ready', 'face', 'know', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'sooner', 'later', 'secret', 'think', 'dumb', 'are', 'buried', 'own', 'mind', 'one', 'have', 'wrong', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'remembers', 'be', 'tricked', 'trapped', 'doomed', 'trip', 'stumbling', 'two', 'lines', 'bring', 'together', 'three', 'people', 'two', 'hence', 'three', 'couples', 'share', 'one', 'secret', 'couple', 'something', 'B', 'who', 'something', 'C', 'who', 'something', 'vicious', 'circle', 'dead', 'end', 'shape', 'never', 'opening', 'round', 'rail', 'forever', 'ever', 'eternal', 'merry-go-round', 'hamster', 'wheel', 'one', 'three', 'animals', 'chained', 'have', 'lost', 'keys', 'liberate', 'handcuffs', 'manacles', 'other', 'steel', 'fetters.Enjoy', 'film', 'so', 'dense', 'may', 'even', 'believe', 'true', 'end', 'will', 'feel', 'relieved', 'redeemed', 'then', 'suddenly', 'will', 'relapse', 'doom', 'infernal', 'basic', 'fact', 'life', 'can', 'always', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'secret.Think', 'hard', 'answer', 'simple', 'double', 'question', 'what', 'crime', 'did', 'commit', 'what', 'secret', 'do', 'hide', 'Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
1353845,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B003LZS774,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 1]","This film started out slow and choppy at first but got better as the movie went on. It's not a great movie by all means but it was entertaining. Brenden Sexton III is hands down the only reason to watch this movie. He is a fabulous actor and did a wonderful job making this otherwise mediocre thriller worth watching.Dana and Jonathan return home from an elegant party only to be held hostage by a mysterious and conning individual. And this is when the story truly begins.This film is one where the plot is not as clear as you think. It's hard to give details without spoilers. Things are not as they seem. You spend your time wondering if the victims are really the victims and just what does Gabriel (Sexton) want from them? It seems to be money but not long after he ties Dana and Jonathan up do we realize his motives run on vengeance and he knows a lot about the couple, even things they don't know about themselves then things really get on the road.I found it interesting the use of flashbacks in this film. I feel like they shouldn't be used if they don't enhance the plot and I feel this time they were necessary. I don't see a better way we could have understood Gabriel's motives without them. This film plays on your emotions and the acting is pretty good. You find it hard to feel bad for Jonathan (John Heard) who acts like such an a-hole at every turn that you no longer root for him to get away. Dana was the most complicated character. The actress did a good job portraying the innocence of the role even when things became clear that she might not be so innocent.Still it's Gabriel and Sexton's acting that shifts this movie into a decent thriller. The plot is not that different from some movies I've seen but it was compelling to see inside these characters. Watching this movie reminded me of unwrapping a present slowly. The farther along you get, the more your heart pounds and the more you can't wait to get to the end just to see how it all turns out.",3,Got Better as It Went On,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1977,"['film', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'choppy', 'first', 'got', 'better', 'movie', 'went', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'was', 'entertaining', 'Brenden', 'Sexton', 'III', 'hands', 'down', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'otherwise', 'mediocre', 'thriller', 'worth', 'watching.Dana', 'Jonathan', 'return', 'home', 'elegant', 'party', 'only', 'be', 'held', 'hostage', 'mysterious', 'conning', 'individual', 'when', 'story', 'truly', 'begins.This', 'film', 'one', 'where', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'think', 'hard', 'give', 'details', 'spoilers', 'Things', 'are', 'not', 'seem', 'spend', 'time', 'wondering', 'victims', 'are', 'really', 'victims', 'just', 'what', 'Gabriel', 'Sexton', 'want', 'be', 'money', 'not', 'long', 'Dana', 'Jonathan', 'up', 'do', 'realize', 'motives', 'run', 'vengeance', 'lot', 'couple', 'even', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'then', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'road.I', 'found', 'interesting', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'feel', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'plot', 'feel', 'time', 'were', 'necessary', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'better', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'understood', 'Gabriel', 'motives', 'film', 'emotions', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'find', 'hard', 'feel', 'bad', 'Jonathan', 'John', 'Heard', 'who', 'such', 'a-hole', 'turn', 'no', 'longer', 'root', 'get', 'away', 'Dana', 'was', 'most', 'complicated', 'character', 'actress', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'innocence', 'role', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'became', 'clear', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'innocent.Still', 'Gabriel', 'Sexton', 'acting', 'shifts', 'movie', 'decent', 'thriller', 'plot', 'not', 'different', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'compelling', 'see', 'characters', 'Watching', 'movie', 'reminded', 'unwrapping', 'present', 'slowly', 'farther', 'get', 'more', 'heart', 'pounds', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'end', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'out']",N/A

1353847,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003LZS774,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","The truth is that once you get into this movie, it really isn't bad. This film starts out as awful as can be, and if I wasn't watching it with someone else, I might have turned it off, but it does eventually get much better. In The Truth, three people who don't know each other are connected by things they've done in the past, and of course there is only one way to get them to admit what they've done. When you kidnap them, torture them, and stick a gun in their face's, people tend to become a bit more agreeable. This film is unique because of the varying degree of talent offered by this cast. John Heard is a tremendous guest star and a great secondary character, but as a lead he is ridiculously in over his head. Heard may have taken this role for the paycheck and it shows. The Killing's Brendan Sexton III, on the other hand, basically makes the movie with his outlandish behavior and his cheesy, but hysterical comments. The truth about The Truth, I wouldn't run out and buy it, but if I saw it again on TV, I wouldn't turn it off either. It's pretty well written, the acting isn't terrible, and it has it's moments.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1127,"['truth', 'once', 'get', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'out', 'as', 'awful', 'can', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'eventually', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Truth', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'are', 'connected', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'past', 'course', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'get', 'admit', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'When', 'kidnap', 'torture', 'stick', 'gun', 'face', 'people', 'tend', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'agreeable', 'film', 'unique', 'varying', 'degree', 'talent', 'offered', 'cast', 'John', 'Heard', 'tremendous', 'guest', 'star', 'great', 'secondary', 'character', 'lead', 'ridiculously', 'head', 'Heard', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'role', 'paycheck', 'Killing', 'Brendan', 'Sexton', 'III', 'other', 'hand', 'basically', 'movie', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'cheesy', 'hysterical', 'comments', 'truth', 'Truth', 'would', ""n't"", 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'saw', 'again', 'TV', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'written', 'acting', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'moments']",N/A
