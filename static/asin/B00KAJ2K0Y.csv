1697202,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00KAJ2K0Y,Alan Ramirez,"[5, 9]","Last night I saw an advanced screening of the film expecting the best: the book was already an amazing work of art written by an amazing author, and since he was involved in the making of this movie, I felt more secure with it, because let's face it: Hollywood has screwed up some great books with horrible movie adaptations, but that's not the case with &#34;The Fault in our Stars&#34;.The film is a faithful adaptation to John Green's work, in my case I even read the book for the second time a week before the day I would see it to see how much of the book was left out, and pretty much everything is on the film, like in any book adaptation, some stuff is skipped (but not really important stuff, so if you watch the film with an open mind you won't care), and some parts are put together to save time.The movie tells the story of the book so well and you feel like you're really reading the book all over again. Ansel and Shailene have undeniable chemistry, they were the perfect choice to play the main characters, but I was a little insecure since they played siblings recently on Divergent, but you forget about Divergent as soon as &#34;Hazel&#34; and &#34;Gus&#34; meet for the first time. The chemistry is just there. The rest of the cast is amazing, the locations and the direction by Josh Boone was good as well.You laugh, you cry... you have everything of what a good movie should be. If you saw the movie without reading the book, then read it!

Gus and Hazel, two teenagers with cancer, meet at a support group and immediately experience chemistry.  Drawn together by not so much by their circumstances and life threatening illness but by the love and depth of life  each wishes to experience,  they depart on an emotional journey well worth the ride for those of us who join them in this poignant film.  You may cry and you will laugh at their antics and reactions.  Willhem DeFoe stands out in a small supporting role.

1697204,A2EO4O7D7BA2K8,B00KAJ2K0Y,Blood,"[5, 10]","Whenever I see a trailer for a new love story coming to theaters (whether it be involving sparkling vampires or the typical high-school sweethearts) I usually groan at how predictable and unoriginal the genre has become. But lucky for me, along with the fans of classic films like Say Anything that perfectly encapsulated young love, there's a new breed of filmmakers that are working to create beloved romance for this generation.Just over a year ago we received the fantastic indie-drama The Spectacular Now from the spectacular writing team of Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber. It surely wasn't a sugar-coated work but it was authentic and true, and that's the prime reason why I enjoyed their newest book adaptation The Fault in Our Stars so much as well. It may seem like the typical movie fad of this summer but I think it will transcend its many teenage admirers and touch more people than you might think.Based on John Green's best-selling novel of the same title, it follows the quirky and perpetually sweet relationship between two emotionally wounded young people: Hazel Grace, a girl permanently ridden with an oxygen tank at her side due to her constant bouts with cancer, and Augustus Waters, a boy who lost one of his legs due to similar clashes with his health. Meeting at a support group, they bond over their unusual outlooks on life and, as you can guess,  fall deeply in love.But unlike most movies of the same kind, Stars doesn't feel the need to wrap everything up in a beautiful little package. It shows the harsh realities of life and how much you affect everyone around you without feeling overly preachy to the audience.The two leads (Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort) are wonderful together, and their undeniably-great chemistry through all the scenes they share may annoy some -- but I found the dialogue between the two to be refreshing and sweet. My only gripe with the film is that we didn't get to delve too much into Isaac's character, though he was excellently portrayed by Nat Wolff. All in all, I felt the acting was stupendous and there was next to nothing wrong with the movie.Rated PG-13 for language and sexuality, Stars is a sharp and charming look on love, and I urge you to give it a shot. It just may surprise you.",5,A Sharp & Refreshing Look on Love,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2261,"['Whenever', 'see', 'trailer', 'new', 'love', 'story', 'coming', 'theaters', 'be', 'involving', 'sparkling', 'vampires', 'typical', 'high-school', 'sweethearts', 'usually', 'groan', 'how', 'predictable', 'unoriginal', 'genre', 'become', 'lucky', 'fans', 'classic', 'films', 'Say', 'Anything', 'perfectly', 'encapsulated', 'young', 'love', 'new', 'breed', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'working', 'create', 'beloved', 'romance', 'generation.Just', 'year', 'received', 'fantastic', 'indie-drama', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'spectacular', 'writing', 'team', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'Weber', 'surely', 'was', ""n't"", 'sugar-coated', 'work', 'was', 'authentic', 'true', 'prime', 'reason', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'newest', 'book', 'adaptation', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'so', 'much', 'well', 'may', 'seem', 'typical', 'movie', 'fad', 'summer', 'think', 'will', 'transcend', 'many', 'teenage', 'admirers', 'touch', 'more', 'people', 'might', 'think.Based', 'John', 'Green', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'quirky', 'perpetually', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'two', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'young', 'people', 'Hazel', 'Grace', 'girl', 'permanently', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'side', 'due', 'constant', 'bouts', 'cancer', 'Augustus', 'Waters', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'one', 'legs', 'due', 'similar', 'clashes', 'health', 'Meeting', 'support', 'group', 'bond', 'unusual', 'outlooks', 'life', 'can', 'guess', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love.But', 'most', 'movies', 'same', 'kind', 'Stars', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'beautiful', 'little', 'package', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'how', 'much', 'affect', 'everyone', 'feeling', 'overly', 'preachy', 'audience.The', 'two', 'leads', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'undeniably-great', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'share', 'may', 'annoy', 'found', 'dialogue', 'two', 'be', 'refreshing', 'sweet', 'only', 'gripe', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'delve', 'too', 'much', 'Isaac', 'character', 'was', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Nat', 'Wolff', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'stupendous', 'was', 'next', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie.Rated', 'PG-13', 'language', 'sexuality', 'Stars', 'sharp', 'charming', 'look', 'love', 'urge', 'give', 'shot', 'just', 'may', 'surprise']",N/A
1697205,A39650P2CZUUC9,B00KAJ2K0Y,"Bonnie Brody ""Book Lover and Knitter""","[7, 11]","Usually, I avoid movies based on books I've read like the plague.  However, for some reason, I couldn't wait to see The Fault in Our Stars.  I read the book at my granddaughter's recommendation, and loved it. The movie follows the book very closely though there are some things left out.  I expected that, as there is not enough time in two hours to include all of the book's salient points.Shailene Woodley, who played the older daughter in The Descendants, does a wonderful job as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a fifteen year old with metastasized thyroid cancer.  She is always in need of oxygen and carries a bag with an oxygen tank in it with her all the time.  Hazel is very bright and knows well that her future is limited.  She calls herself a 'grenade' as her life can explode at any time.  She comes from a very loving household.  Her mother is played by Laura Dern.Hazel is encouraged by her parents to attend a cancer survivors support group.  It is there that she meets Augustus Waters, a 17 year-old who has had one leg removed up to his knee because of bone cancer. His cancer has an 85% survival rate.  He is very optimistic about life and is smitten immediately by Hazel.While the movie follows the book closely, there are some important things left out.  One is the fact that Gus's previous girlfriend looked a lot like Hazel.  Gus was a star basketball player before his cancer.  This is alluded to but  is never made clear.  I also wished that Willem Dafoe, who plays the author of An Imperial Affliction, the book that Hazel reads over and over, had more of a role in the movie.  He appears twice but his time on screen is short and the movie doesn't really get to the point of how important this book is to Hazel, and later Gus.If you haven't read the book, you will love the movie and it won't matter that certain parts of the book are left out.  If you read the book, go to the movie anyway.  It catches the heart of the book and the relationship between Gus and Hazel in a very dark time.  The actors do a fine job and the movie is a real tear jerker.",5,Couldn't Wait to See This!,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2069,"['Usually', 'avoid', 'movies', 'based', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'plague', 'However', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'read', 'book', 'granddaughter', 'recommendation', 'loved', 'movie', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'are', 'things', 'left', 'out', 'expected', 'that', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'include', 'book', 'salient', 'points.Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'played', 'older', 'daughter', 'Descendants', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Hazel', 'Grace', 'Lancaster', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'metastasized', 'thyroid', 'cancer', 'always', 'need', 'oxygen', 'bag', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'time', 'Hazel', 'very', 'bright', 'well', 'future', 'limited', ""'grenade"", 'life', 'can', 'explode', 'time', 'very', 'loving', 'household', 'mother', 'played', 'Laura', 'Dern.Hazel', 'encouraged', 'parents', 'attend', 'cancer', 'survivors', 'support', 'group', 'there', 'Augustus', 'Waters', '17', 'year-old', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'leg', 'removed', 'up', 'knee', 'bone', 'cancer', 'cancer', '85', '%', 'survival', 'rate', 'very', 'optimistic', 'life', 'smitten', 'immediately', 'Hazel.While', 'movie', 'book', 'closely', 'are', 'important', 'things', 'left', 'out', 'One', 'fact', 'Gus', 'previous', 'girlfriend', 'looked', 'lot', 'Hazel', 'Gus', 'was', 'star', 'basketball', 'player', 'cancer', 'alluded', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'also', 'wished', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'author', 'Imperial', 'Affliction', 'book', 'Hazel', 'had', 'more', 'role', 'movie', 'twice', 'time', 'screen', 'short', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'point', 'how', 'important', 'book', 'Hazel', 'later', 'Gus.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'certain', 'parts', 'book', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'read', 'book', 'go', 'movie', 'anyway', 'heart', 'book', 'relationship', 'Gus', 'Hazel', 'very', 'dark', 'time', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'movie', 'real', 'tear', 'jerker']",N/A

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[8, 14]","Move over &#34;Beaches,&#34; and' &#34;Terms of Endearment,&#34; and make room for &#34;The Fault in Our Stars,&#34; based on the best-seller by John Green, and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, who play star-crossed young lovers and cancer survivors.  Both alas, fit the type most likely to come down with cancer in a Hollywood movie: white, relatively well-off, youthful and so dewy skinned and radiant that at times I felt like I was watching a shampoo commercial.  However, the acting of the two leads is excellent, as is the supporting cast, but the script - despite the narrator's insistence to the contrary - is formulaic.  The whole picture is beautifully choreographed and set to a fitting soundtrack, but to me, it often seemed manipulative.Don't get me wrong.  Cancer is sad, and death is sad, and beautiful people dying well before they should, especially when they have a unique relationship and are soul mates is tragic, but I thought the director and scriptwriter didn't have to work quite so hard to convince me of this.  Case in point: the two take a trip to Amsterdam to visit a reclusive author that Shailene's character idolizes, and they also see the Anne Frank House.  We don't just get to see Shailene struggle to climb endless flights of stairs to reach the attic - we get to hear Anne's voiceover.  When the couple finally reach their destination, they are overcome and make out.  And - the icing on the cake - they are treated to a slow clap from the other tourists.  As a character in &#34;Not Another Teen Movie,&#34; says, &#34;You have to know when the right time is for a slow clap,' and this is definitely it.There's a funeral at the end; actually there are kind of two funerals.  I won't give away who dies, in case you haven't read the book, but the last half hour of the movie ramps up the tear jerking to new heights.  (The two girls next to me sobbed nonstop.)  If you have a decently sized heart and a working set of tear ducts, you may want to bring along a box of Kleenex when you go see this movie.  If you, like me, have a cynical side, you may feel sorry for the characters but resent what seems like emotional blackmail.  The director employs every trick in the book to get you to weep, but if you'd rather not be subjected to such tactics, you may want to give this movie a pass.",3,No Tear Left Unjerked,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2334,"['Move', '34', 'Beaches', '34', '34', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '34', 'make', 'room', '34', 'Fault', 'Stars', '34', 'based', 'best-seller', 'John', 'Green', 'starring', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'who', 'play', 'star-crossed', 'young', 'lovers', 'cancer', 'survivors', 'alas', 'fit', 'type', 'most', 'likely', 'come', 'down', 'cancer', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'white', 'relatively', 'well-off', 'youthful', 'so', 'dewy', 'skinned', 'radiant', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'shampoo', 'commercial', 'However', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'script', 'narrator', 'insistence', 'contrary', 'formulaic', 'whole', 'picture', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'set', 'fitting', 'soundtrack', 'often', 'seemed', 'manipulative.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Cancer', 'sad', 'death', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'people', 'dying', 'well', 'should', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'unique', 'relationship', 'are', 'soul', 'mates', 'tragic', 'thought', 'director', 'scriptwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'quite', 'so', 'hard', 'convince', 'Case', 'point', 'two', 'take', 'trip', 'Amsterdam', 'visit', 'reclusive', 'author', 'Shailene', 'character', 'idolizes', 'also', 'see', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'House', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'see', 'Shailene', 'struggle', 'climb', 'endless', 'flights', 'stairs', 'reach', 'attic', 'get', 'hear', 'Anne', 'voiceover', 'When', 'couple', 'finally', 'reach', 'destination', 'are', 'overcome', 'make', 'out', 'icing', 'cake', 'are', 'treated', 'slow', 'clap', 'other', 'tourists', 'character', '34', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', '34', '34', 'have', 'know', 'when', 'right', 'time', 'slow', 'clap', 'definitely', 'funeral', 'end', 'actually', 'are', 'kind', 'two', 'funerals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'who', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'up', 'tear', 'jerking', 'new', 'heights', 'two', 'girls', 'sobbed', 'nonstop', 'have', 'decently', 'sized', 'heart', 'working', 'set', 'tear', 'ducts', 'may', 'want', 'bring', 'along', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'cynical', 'side', 'may', 'feel', 'sorry', 'characters', 'resent', 'what', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'director', 'trick', 'book', 'get', 'weep', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'be', 'subjected', 'such', 'tactics', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'movie', 'pass']",N/A

On the first official &#34;open&#34; day of the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival, I managed to catch a film that wasn't part of the press screenings I have attended for the past three weeks. And was it worth it! The Egyptian Theatre was filled to the rafters with fans of the wildly popular Young Adult novel by John Green; it was fun to watch the audience telegraph each phase of this realistic look at young people dealing with malignancies. The young gal next to me pulled out some tissue in anticipation of one sad scene and wriggled with glee when something funny was coming up.This film is loaded with humor, but it also has powerful performances by stellar actors. The author was on set during the filming, so he was downstairs while the mother and daughter were doing an extremely emotional scene in an upstairs bedroom. Green became so agitated when he heard the girl's voice, they had to restrain him from barging in on the scene to comfort her.We admire:* Shailene Woodley (&#34;Divergent&#34;) is Hazel, our young heroine, suffering from terminal cancer, who schleps her oxygen equipment everywhere she goes...including Anne Frank's attic in Amsterdam!* Ansel Elgort (&#34;Divergent&#34; - he was her brother in that one) Gus refuses to be pulled into Hazel's negative space, but he does it with such wit and charm, she can't help but respond.* Laura Dern (&#34;Enlightened&#34;) is our heroine's happily married mother, insightful, supportive and consistently loving.* Sam Trammell (&#34;True Blood&#34;) is her father, who isn't sure his girl has enough strength for a friendship like this.* Nat Wolff (&#34;Stuck in Love&#34;) is their best friend Isaac who has lost one eye to cancer and now is confronted with the possibility of losing the other...plus a girlfriend. He shows us the therapeutic value of venting one's rage.

While on her way to a cancer support group in (I quote) "" the heart of Jesus"" she mistakenly bumps into a boy. Much to her surprise,  Augustus Waters can not stop staring at Hazel. Little does Hazel know is that there is more to Augustus than meets the eye.The Fault in our Stars offers a lot of good things as a movie ladies and gentlemen. Yes people label this movie romance and yes there are in fact romantic moments in the movie but the movie itself is more than just two kids falling in love. It's about having hope when others around you have given up. It's about accepting whatever comes your way and facing adversity head on . Shailene Woodley knows exactly what I'm talking about here. Hazel is the embodiment of these traits  I just mentioned. I was Highly impressed (and deeply moved a few times) with the way Shailene Woodley handled playing Hazel. Ansel Elgort has a nice outing as Augustus Waters in the movie. He may be over the top in the confidence department, but he exhibits a likable charm and clever attitude throughout the film so well, that it's hard to not like his character. Willem Dafoe also stars as Peter Van Houten author of An Imperial Affliction which happens to be the book Hazel is a big fan of.  I enjoyed his take on the character;  he was rather uh, interesting to say the very least. Nat Wolff also plays Augustus's friend Issac and he did a good job. Sam Trammell and Laura Dern star as Michael and Frannie Lancaster and they were also good in their respective roles.I admit I have not read the book though I do intend to, but I like how the story in the movie progresses. The Fault in our Stars works well as a drama due to each act being directed extensively, and again with the positive acting on both sides.But above all else my friends, something about The Fault in our Stars sticks with you. And strangely enough, I cannot yet decide what exactly it is. Maybe it's Shailene Woodley's uplifting performance in the movie. Maybe it's the fact that I cared about the characters in the movie. Or maybe just maybe, it is the overall feeling I had once the movie was over.So there you have it. I have given my thoughts on The Fault in our Stars the movie. I gave my thoughts on the acting, the story, and the movie as a whole. I definitely will be getting the book as well as the blu ray in the foreseeable future, and as for the score well, here it is9/10Rated PG-13",5,May bring tears to the eyes but only because there is more to this movie than just romance,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2479,"['meeting', 'Hazel', 'Lancaster', 'understand', 'thyroid', 'cancer', 'way', 'cancer', 'support', 'group', 'quote', 'heart', 'Jesus', 'mistakenly', 'boy', 'Much', 'surprise', 'Augustus', 'Waters', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'staring', 'Hazel', 'Little', 'Hazel', 'know', 'more', 'Augustus', 'eye.The', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'Yes', 'people', 'label', 'movie', 'romance', 'yes', 'are', 'fact', 'romantic', 'moments', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'two', 'kids', 'falling', 'love', 'having', 'hope', 'when', 'others', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'accepting', 'way', 'facing', 'adversity', 'head', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'here', 'Hazel', 'embodiment', 'traits', 'just', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Highly', 'impressed', 'deeply', 'moved', 'few', 'times', 'way', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'handled', 'playing', 'Hazel', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'nice', 'outing', 'Augustus', 'Waters', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'top', 'confidence', 'department', 'likable', 'charm', 'clever', 'attitude', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'character', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'also', 'Peter', 'Van', 'Houten', 'author', 'Imperial', 'Affliction', 'be', 'book', 'Hazel', 'big', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'take', 'character', 'was', 'rather', 'uh', 'interesting', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'Nat', 'Wolff', 'also', 'Augustus', 'friend', 'Issac', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'star', 'Michael', 'Frannie', 'Lancaster', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'respective', 'roles.I', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'do', 'intend', 'like', 'how', 'story', 'movie', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'well', 'drama', 'due', 'act', 'being', 'directed', 'extensively', 'again', 'positive', 'acting', 'sides.But', 'else', 'friends', 'something', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'strangely', 'enough', 'can', 'not', 'yet', 'decide', 'what', 'exactly', 'Maybe', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'uplifting', 'performance', 'movie', 'fact', 'cared', 'characters', 'movie', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'overall', 'feeling', 'had', 'once', 'movie', 'was', 'over.So', 'there', 'have', 'have', 'given', 'thoughts', 'Fault', 'Stars', 'movie', 'gave', 'thoughts', 'acting', 'story', 'movie', 'whole', 'definitely', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'blu', 'ray', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'score', 'well', 'here', 'is9/10Rated', 'PG-13']",N/A
1697211,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00KAJ2K0Y,M. Bullions,"[30, 33]","There&#8217;s a critic&#8217;s quote on the back of my copy of &#8220;The Fault in Our Stars,&#8221; by John Green, which I really felt captured the book&#8217;s essence and how it felt to read it. &#8220;This is a book that will break your heart &#8211; not by wearing it down, but by making it bigger and bigger until it bursts.&#8221; This is true. But, don&#8217;t be mistaken. This is an emotionally exhausting story. All a movie of a beloved book can hope to accomplish is to do justice to the book&#8217;s essence, and to give the viewer the same feeling they had when reading it as a novel. &#8220;The Fault in Our Stars&#8221; does this, and then some.&#8220;Stars&#8221; follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of thirteen. A clinical trial gave her a few good years, but she has never been really anything but terminal. Her behavior leads her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammel) to believe she&#8217;s depressed, and force her to attend an insufferable cancer support group, where she meets who turns out to be the love of her life, Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort).So first, I&#8217;ll calm the book readers down a bit. Woodley, who proved in 2011&#8217;s &#8220;The Descendants,&#8221; that she is a dynamic actress, and could helm YA-novel adaptations without being compared to Kristen Stewart, makes for a dynamic Hazel, giving a sublime and beautiful performance that could (and should) earn her some Academy attention this winter. Elgort is brooding, romantic and infectiously charismatic &#8211; a pitch perfect Augustus. And best yet, these two young actors have a chemistry that is electric, and should hit non-fans just as hard as it does those familiar with the source material.Amy Jellicoe, I mean, Laura Dern is lovely as Hazel&#8217;s martyr mother. Dern played Amy Jellicoe in one of my favorite television series of all time, HBO&#8217;s cancelled-too-soon &#8220;Enlightened,&#8221; and she plays exactly the character from the book, and doesn&#8217;t change much. Sam Trammel (HBO&#8217;s &#8220;True Blood&#8221;) does nice work too. In the novel, Hazel&#8217;s father broke out crying almost every time she was in his presence, which Trammel doesn&#8217;t do. I guess that&#8217;s a good thing.When the end-of-second-act plot twist hits, you will likely be in tears the entire third act of the movie, like I was. The book&#8217;s tone reminded me of Showtime&#8217;s series &#8220;The Big C.&#8221; It&#8217;s about a morbid subject &#8211; cancer, but treats its subject with lightness and finds a way to convey the humor in a terrible situation. &#8220;The Fault in Our Stars&#8221; is like the book in that way &#8211; it is at times grim and morbid in its detail about disease. But the characters manage to crack jokes about their awful predicament, which makes the third-act punch hurt a little less.The film only makes a few slight changes in story from the book. Hazel&#8217;s friend Kaitlyn is written out completely, which actually works. Hazel is better portrayed as someone who was lonely and friendless until the great love of her life came around. Kaitlyn was an afterthought in the book anyway. The backstory of Augustus&#8217;s previous girlfriend Caroline is also written out, which is not such a good choice. But a book fan is always going to find things to nitpick.In the end, Josh Boone made a superb adaptation of a beloved novel, which captured what it felt like to read the book. Not only that, but it captures the unmistakable feeling of being in love for the first time. The film itself is heartbreaking (you will cry&#8230;no way around it,) hopeful, wise, and acerbic in its wit. It will remind you not to live every day like it&#8217;s your last &#8211; but to just live.Grade: A",5,A bittersweet celebration of love and life...,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,3771,"['8217', 's', 'critic', '8217', 's', 'quote', 'back', 'copy', '8220', 'Fault', 'Stars', '8221', 'John', 'Green', 'really', 'felt', 'captured', 'book', '8217', 'essence', 'how', 'felt', 'read', '8220', 'book', 'will', 'break', 'heart', '8211', 'not', 'wearing', 'down', 'making', 'bigger', 'bigger', '8221', 'true', 'don', '8217', 'be', 'mistaken', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'story', 'movie', 'beloved', 'book', 'can', 'hope', 'accomplish', 'do', 'justice', 'book', '8217', 's', 'essence', 'give', 'viewer', 'same', 'feeling', 'had', 'when', 'reading', 'novel', '8220', 'Fault', 'Stars', '8221', 'then', 'some.', '8220', 'Stars', '8221', 'Hazel', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'age', 'thirteen', 'clinical', 'trial', 'gave', 'few', 'good', 'years', 'never', 'been', 'really', 'anything', 'terminal', 'behavior', 'parents', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Sam', 'Trammel', 'believe', '8217', 's', 'depressed', 'force', 'attend', 'insufferable', 'cancer', 'support', 'group', 'where', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'love', 'life', 'Augustus', 'Waters', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', '.So', 'first', '8217', 'calm', 'book', 'readers', 'down', 'bit', 'Woodley', 'who', 'proved', '2011', '8217', '8220', 'Descendants', '8221', 'dynamic', 'actress', 'could', 'helm', 'YA-novel', 'adaptations', 'being', 'compared', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'dynamic', 'Hazel', 'giving', 'sublime', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'could', 'should', 'earn', 'Academy', 'attention', 'winter', 'Elgort', 'brooding', 'romantic', 'infectiously', 'charismatic', '8211', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Augustus', 'best', 'yet', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'chemistry', 'electric', 'should', 'hit', 'non-fans', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'familiar', 'source', 'material.Amy', 'Jellicoe', 'mean', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'lovely', 'Hazel', '8217', 'martyr', 'mother', 'Dern', 'played', 'Amy', 'Jellicoe', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'time', 'HBO', '8217', 'cancelled-too-soon', '8220', 'Enlightened', '8221', 'exactly', 'character', 'book', 'doesn', '8217', 'change', 'much', 'Sam', 'Trammel', 'HBO', '8217', '8220', 'True', 'Blood', '8221', 'nice', 'work', 'too', 'novel', 'Hazel', '8217', 'father', 'broke', 'out', 'crying', 'almost', 'time', 'was', 'presence', 'Trammel', 'doesn', '8217', 'do', 'guess', '8217', 's', 'good', 'thing.When', 'end-of-second-act', 'plot', 'twist', 'hits', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'tears', 'entire', 'third', 'act', 'movie', 'was', 'book', '8217', 'tone', 'reminded', 'Showtime', '8217', 'series', '8220', 'Big', 'C.', '8221', '8217', 's', 'morbid', 'subject', '8211', 'cancer', 'subject', 'lightness', 'way', 'convey', 'humor', 'terrible', 'situation', '8220', 'Fault', 'Stars', '8221', 'book', 'way', '8211', 'times', 'grim', 'morbid', 'detail', 'disease', 'characters', 'manage', 'crack', 'jokes', 'awful', 'predicament', 'third-act', 'punch', 'hurt', 'little', 'less.The', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'slight', 'changes', 'story', 'book', 'Hazel', '8217', 'friend', 'Kaitlyn', 'written', 'out', 'completely', 'actually', 'Hazel', 'better', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'lonely', 'friendless', 'great', 'love', 'life', 'came', 'around', 'Kaitlyn', 'was', 'afterthought', 'book', 'anyway', 'backstory', 'Augustus', '8217', 'previous', 'girlfriend', 'Caroline', 'also', 'written', 'out', 'not', 'such', 'good', 'choice', 'book', 'fan', 'always', 'going', 'find', 'things', 'nitpick.In', 'end', 'Josh', 'Boone', 'made', 'superb', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'novel', 'captured', 'what', 'felt', 'read', 'book', 'Not', 'only', 'unmistakable', 'feeling', 'being', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'heartbreaking', 'will', 'cry', '8230', 'way', 'hopeful', 'wise', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'will', 'remind', 'not', 'live', 'day', '8217', 's', 'last', '8211', 'just', 'live.Grade']",N/A

There may be spoilers.Like I suspect everybody, I went into this film having a pretty good idea of what it is about and its consequences.  I was primarily attracted by Shailene Woodley who has been so good in everything she's ever done professionally.  This film is no exception.  Here she plays Hazel, a 16 year old with cancer.  The cancer has affected her breathing so she walks around hauling a portable oxygen tank that constantly feeds her through one of those removable tubes attached to her nose.Her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) are constantly nearby and while Hazel understands, she also finds it a bit annoying.  Reluctantly Hazel begins to go to a support group where she meets 18 year old Gus (Ansel Elgort who ironically played Woodley's character's brother in ""Divergent"").  Gus has had his own battle with cancer losing a leg below the knee.  He appears to be in remission, while Hazel battles on with occasional trips to the ER.  After both make goo-goo eyes at each other they get together, as friends of course.  The chemistry between the two is very good.  Both are a bit acerbic but are usually in good spirits and use their humor to keep things in perspective.Hazel asks Gus to read one of her favorite books and to her surprise, he understands it.  This leads to their hunt for the author who left the story without a perfect ending, even to the point of concluding the novel mid-sentence.  Van Houten (a scene chewing Willem Dafoe), never wrote again (ever heard that plot point before?) and has become a recluse in Amsterdam...The Netherlands one.  Much to their ultimate disappointment they make the trip, with mom as chaperone, and hook up with the cranky author.Even without reading the book by John Green, you just know this isn't going to end with grins and giggles, but give the director (Josh Boone) and the writers (Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber) credit for not making it a maudlin, morose journey.  Don't get me wrong, tears will be shed but what do you expect?  The film isn't perfect to be sure.  Gus's occasional smugness can be a bit annoying as is his metaphorically unlit cigarette dangling from his lips.  You will also recognize a clich&eacute; or two.  Minor quibbles aside, Ms.  Woodley's performance is worth watching alone.  The film is sad at times, funny most of the time and is just about 2 young people falling in love that just happen to have cancer.  Recommended.",4,3 1/2 stars.

1697214,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00KAJ2K0Y,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[3, 5]","Nine Things about the Movie ""The Fault in Our Stars"" [USA, 2014]1. This film is based on the young adult novel by the same name. It's about a girl with cancer that falls in love with a boy she meets at a support group. I never read it, because that's just not my kind of story. But friends that did read it were frothing at the mouth, proclaiming how good it was. So when the movie came out, I decided to give it a try.2. A romantic drama about kids with cancer screams exploitation. Exploitation of cancer, and exploitation of the audience. I expected an emotionally-manipulative, sugar coated piece of crap that would give me diabetes.3. I was so wrong. The movie knows what the conventions are for this kind of movie, and deliberately subverts them. It's a smart, clear-eyed look at terminal love.4. The burgeoning relationship is handled well. The girl, Hazel, and the boy, Gus, struggle with their feelings for each other, knowing that the relationship can't go anywhere.5. The movie stares death straight in the face. Hazel admits to an existential loneliness, whileGus struggles to find a deeper meaning to his life.6. There's a subplot where the two travel to Amsterdam to visit their favorite author (played with acidic gruffness by Willem Dafoe). The meeting does not go as well as the two had hoped, and the resulting feelings ripple through their world-views.7. Hazel is played by Shailene Woodley and Gus is played by Ansel Elgort. They also played brother and sister in ""Divergent"". Woodley and Elgort are astounding in their portrayal of the characters. It's some of the best acting I've seen this year.8. There are several times that the movie has the chance to veer into the typical romantic angst, or a depiction of courage in the face of impossible obstacles. But each time, it refuses to go there, staying on a more realistic path.9. This movie sparkles with intelligence and wit and sorrow. Especially considering it's targeted at young people, it openly struggles with the harder truths about life, and doesn't flinch when it gives sad answers. I can see some parents having problems with letting their kid go see this. But the realistic trajectory of the movie is exactly what gives the movie a real heart, so when it does get emotional, it feels much more natural, not exploitative, to go with it.",4,not your typical teen romantic drama,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2321,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', 'Fault', 'Stars', '[', 'USA', '2014', ']', '1', 'film', 'based', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'girl', 'cancer', 'love', 'boy', 'support', 'group', 'never', 'read', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'story', 'did', 'read', 'were', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'proclaiming', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'So', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'decided', 'give', 'try.2', 'romantic', 'drama', 'kids', 'cancer', 'screams', 'exploitation', 'Exploitation', 'cancer', 'exploitation', 'audience', 'expected', 'emotionally-manipulative', 'sugar', 'coated', 'piece', 'crap', 'would', 'give', 'diabetes.3', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'movie', 'what', 'conventions', 'are', 'kind', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'smart', 'clear-eyed', 'look', 'terminal', 'love.4', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'handled', 'well', 'girl', 'Hazel', 'boy', 'Gus', 'struggle', 'feelings', 'other', 'knowing', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere.5', 'movie', 'death', 'straight', 'face', 'Hazel', 'existential', 'loneliness', 'whileGus', 'find', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'life.6', 'subplot', 'where', 'two', 'travel', 'Amsterdam', 'visit', 'favorite', 'author', 'played', 'acidic', 'gruffness', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'meeting', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'had', 'hoped', 'resulting', 'feelings', 'ripple', 'world-views.7', 'Hazel', 'played', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Gus', 'played', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'also', 'played', 'brother', 'sister', 'Divergent', 'Woodley', 'Elgort', 'are', 'astounding', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.8', 'are', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'chance', 'veer', 'typical', 'romantic', 'angst', 'depiction', 'courage', 'face', 'impossible', 'obstacles', 'time', 'go', 'there', 'staying', 'more', 'realistic', 'path.9', 'movie', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'sorrow', 'Especially', 'considering', 'targeted', 'young', 'people', 'openly', 'harder', 'truths', 'life', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'when', 'sad', 'answers', 'can', 'see', 'parents', 'having', 'problems', 'letting', 'kid', 'go', 'see', 'realistic', 'trajectory', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'real', 'heart', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'emotional', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'not', 'exploitative', 'go']",N/A

I was not disappointed.When I heard that Shailene Woodley was cast as Hazel, I was concerned. I know her mostly from The Secret Life of the American Teenager and I never thought she was very good in that. Granted, that may have been because of the material she was given to work with. However, her acting was great in this movie. She conveyed complex emotions through subtle facial expressions. I was impressed. Her haircut and wardrobe made her sufficiently dowdy like I pictured Hazel would be.Ansel Elgort was a good choice for Gus, both in looks and attitude. I was also happy with the rest of the cast. I'm a fan of Mike Birbiglia and was surprised that he was in this movie. He turned out to be great as the cheesy support group leader Mike. And True Blood fans - Sam (Sam Trammell) plays Hazel's dad!The movie condensed the book in just the right way. Augustus still has some of his angsty, mature dialogue but not as much as in the book. I know some people thought the way he talked in the book was unrealistic. They will probably think the movie version is more believable. The one thing that bothered me is the stupid cigarette that Gus has dangling out of his mouth most of the time. I don't remember it being as prominent in the book. Maybe I just didn't visualize it when reading. Either way, I didn't care for it. It's supposed to be a metaphor but it seems like he depends on it as a comfort item, even though he never lights it of course. I remember the storyline with Hazel's favorite author (played by the awesome Willem Dafoe) being kind of zany in the book and it was too much for me. It's toned down nicely in the movie.Even if you haven't read the book, this is a fantastic movie. It's a love story about two people who happen to have cancer. It's not overly sentimental or trite.

1697216,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00KAJ2K0Y,Ranny Levy,"[12, 16]","Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy.  This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.There are so many great aspects about this movie that it&#8217;s hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenager&#8217;s perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it.  John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart-wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn&#8217;t feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows she&#8217;s going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace.My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaac&#8217;s ex-girlfriend&#8217;s house. Isaac&#8217;s ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he can&#8217;t see where he&#8217;s throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because he&#8217;s throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene.I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won&#8217;t regret it!Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

1697220,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00KAJ2K0Y,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[6, 10]","One of the great things about John Green's novel, The Fault In Our Stars, is that it isn't a typical cancer story. It isn't a typical anything, really, and even loosely considering it a &#34;cancer story&#34; seems like a momentary injustice. Nor does it quite conform to our traditional notions of sappy, angst-ridden teen romances. There's something quite extraordinary about the novel; its realized characters and full-hearted story of exceptional love, both of the romantic variety and the unbreakable love a parent has for their child. And because of all the things the book gets so right, the fact of Josh Boone's big screen adaptation nailing them so perfectly makes the film all the more special.Right away the lead character, Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) lets you know this isn't going to your average everyday story, either. Hazel is a brilliant, witty, well-read young woman who also happens to have thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Because of it she carries an oxygen tank around with her and has little tubes connected to her nose. But her outlook on the situation is more acerbic than grim, with her clever and funny observations on &#34;cancer perks&#34; drawing the attention of Augustus &#34;Gus&#34; Waters (Ansel Elgort), a handsome, 18-year-old she meets at a cancer support group. Not exactly the ideal meet-cute, but then again nothing about their situation is truly ideal, which makes them finding one another such a thing of pure magic.See, Augustus is currently in remission from osteosarcoma, ending his basketball career when the disease took his leg. Like Hazel, he has a somewhat offbeat perspective on life, and where she's a bit bleak he's of a sunnier disposition. They complete one another and learn from one another in just about every way imaginable. A voracious reader, Hazel introduces Gus to her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, an extensive tome from a reclusive author now holed up in Amsterdam. Gus loves Hazel almost immediately, ingratiating himself into her life and charming her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell), even though Hazel remains distant in an effort to hurt as few people as possible.Green's novel, written with incredible care and emotional heft, does much of the heavy lifting for screenwriters Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter (500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now); both old hands at penning romances that are a little off the beaten path. They also know how to work with Woodley, who is content presenting Hazel and all of her flaws and quirks. Despite this being a story with a somewhat inevitably heart-wrenching conclusion, none of the characters are treated with kid gloves. Hazel has her issues; she's as stubborn and moody as she is funny and passionate. And while Woodley is careful not to make Hazel too precious, Elgort has the difficult job of making the all-too-perfect Gus seem like a real person. A boy with a fondness for grand symbolic gestures, Gus will give you flashbacks of Say Anything's Lloyd Dobbler, and Elgort's performance on par with John Cusack's. Elgort, who played Woodley's brother in Divergent just a couple of months ago, exudes confidence without being brash. Both he and Woodley capture the frailty and strength in these wonderful, unforgettable characters. Beyond the terrific pop culture references there are so many quotable lines that you'll want to try them out on your significant other.There are a few small changes from the novel that don't completely work, mainly in the streamlining of the relationship between Hazel and Gus. It's almost too planned, too preordained the journey they are on. As wonderful and heartbreaking as the performances by Dern and Trammell, there needed to be more of Hazel's relationship with her parents, who are on just as much of an emotional roller coaster. But these are small quibbles, and to include more would detract from every cherished moment with Gus and Hazel, and we simply can't have that. The Fault In Our Stars isn't a story about two people dying from cancer, but of two people who lived and loved to the fullest extent despite it. Everything that made John Green's book so great is here, so maybe just this once the world really is &#34;a wish-granting factory.&#34;",5,A Full-Hearted Story of an Exceptional Love,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,4260,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'John', 'Green', 'novel', 'Fault', 'Stars', ""n't"", 'typical', 'cancer', 'story', ""n't"", 'typical', 'anything', 'really', 'even', 'loosely', 'considering', '34', 'cancer', 'story', '34', 'momentary', 'injustice', 'quite', 'conform', 'traditional', 'notions', 'sappy', 'angst-ridden', 'teen', 'romances', 'something', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'novel', 'realized', 'characters', 'full-hearted', 'story', 'exceptional', 'love', 'romantic', 'variety', 'unbreakable', 'love', 'parent', 'child', 'things', 'book', 'so', 'right', 'fact', 'Josh', 'Boone', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'nailing', 'so', 'perfectly', 'film', 'more', 'special.Right', 'away', 'lead', 'character', 'Hazel', 'Grace', 'Lancaster', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'know', ""n't"", 'going', 'average', 'everyday', 'story', 'either', 'Hazel', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'well-read', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'thyroid', 'cancer', 'spread', 'lungs', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'little', 'tubes', 'connected', 'nose', 'outlook', 'situation', 'more', 'acerbic', 'grim', 'clever', 'funny', 'observations', '34', 'cancer', '34', 'drawing', 'attention', 'Augustus', '34', 'Gus', '34', 'Waters', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'handsome', '18-year-old', 'cancer', 'support', 'group', 'Not', 'exactly', 'ideal', 'meet-cute', 'then', 'again', 'nothing', 'situation', 'truly', 'ideal', 'finding', 'one', 'thing', 'pure', 'magic.See', 'Augustus', 'currently', 'remission', 'osteosarcoma', 'ending', 'basketball', 'career', 'when', 'disease', 'took', 'leg', 'Hazel', 'somewhat', 'offbeat', 'perspective', 'life', 'where', 'bit', 'sunnier', 'disposition', 'complete', 'one', 'learn', 'one', 'just', 'way', 'imaginable', 'voracious', 'reader', 'Hazel', 'Gus', 'favorite', 'book', 'Imperial', 'Affliction', 'extensive', 'tome', 'reclusive', 'author', 'now', 'holed', 'up', 'Amsterdam', 'Gus', 'Hazel', 'almost', 'immediately', 'ingratiating', 'life', 'charming', 'parents', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Sam', 'Trammell', 'even', 'Hazel', 'distant', 'effort', 'hurt', 'few', 'people', 'possible.Green', 'novel', 'written', 'incredible', 'care', 'emotional', 'heft', 'much', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'screenwriters', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'old', 'hands', 'penning', 'romances', 'are', 'little', 'off', 'beaten', 'path', 'also', 'know', 'how', 'work', 'Woodley', 'who', 'content', 'presenting', 'Hazel', 'flaws', 'quirks', 'being', 'story', 'somewhat', 'inevitably', 'heart-wrenching', 'conclusion', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'treated', 'kid', 'gloves', 'Hazel', 'issues', 'stubborn', 'moody', 'funny', 'passionate', 'Woodley', 'careful', 'not', 'make', 'Hazel', 'too', 'precious', 'Elgort', 'difficult', 'job', 'making', 'all-too-perfect', 'Gus', 'seem', 'real', 'person', 'boy', 'fondness', 'grand', 'symbolic', 'gestures', 'Gus', 'will', 'give', 'flashbacks', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Lloyd', 'Dobbler', 'Elgort', 'performance', 'par', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Elgort', 'who', 'played', 'Woodley', 'brother', 'Divergent', 'just', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'exudes', 'confidence', 'being', 'brash', 'Woodley', 'capture', 'frailty', 'strength', 'wonderful', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'terrific', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'quotable', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'want', 'try', 'out', 'significant', 'are', 'few', 'small', 'changes', 'novel', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'work', 'mainly', 'streamlining', 'relationship', 'Hazel', 'Gus', 'almost', 'too', 'planned', 'too', 'preordained', 'journey', 'are', 'wonderful', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'Dern', 'Trammell', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'Hazel', 'relationship', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'much', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'are', 'small', 'quibbles', 'include', 'more', 'would', 'detract', 'cherished', 'moment', 'Gus', 'Hazel', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Fault', 'Stars', ""n't"", 'story', 'two', 'people', 'dying', 'cancer', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'loved', 'fullest', 'extent', 'Everything', 'made', 'John', 'Green', 'book', 'so', 'great', 'here', 'maybe', 'just', 'once', 'world', 'really', '34', 'wish-granting', 'factory.', '34']",N/A
