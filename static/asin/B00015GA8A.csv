I like Soames better in this series than in series 1, but I've had high hopes for his character all along. Damian Lewis played Soames wonderfully - right down to the way he held his cane and walked. His performance in the final scene was tear-inducing. Just wonderful.I was so sad when series 2 ended, but it was very satisfying and well done, and I cried happy tears...I was just sad it was all over. I just finished watching yesterday, but I already miss the whole Forsyte family, both sides.I didn't much care for the later years in series 2 because the costumes were less elaborate although true to the time period. I'm not a fan of the clothing from the early 1900s, though. Flapper dresses and hair adornments, as beautiful as they are, are just not as fun and flattering in my opinion for the women as the costumes in series 1 during the late 1800s. At least the men always looked dashing through the whole of series 1 and 2.If you watched series 1, you have to watch series 2.

Examples:Young Jo would NEVER go to Fleur,whom he mistrusts,and reveal the secret of his fatal illness.Irene would never scream at Jon and have an hysterical episode.Jon is too innocent to have sex with Fleur after his father's funeral.Soames would sooner die than tell Fleur about his dishonoring Irene.And Fleur would not turn into a screaming harpy when she loses Jon.Then:Soames and Irene patching it up and he leaving Robin Hill with a smile on his face and a spring in his step?PLEASE!The story is set in 1920,a different world from our own.The world portrayed is 2002,and it just doesn't wash.The original 1969 version got a huge audience from it's faithful adaptation and inspired acting.The new 2002 version has to rely on sex and violence to attract an audience.It seems that you can never go broke underestimating the taste of today's viewing public.If you want to own an outstanding version of the Saga,buy the dvd or video set of the original 1969 version.It's still available for purchase on Amazon.",2,A DIFFERENT WORLD.,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1846,"['Once', 'again', 'must', 'compare', 'acting', 'directing', 'new', 'version', 'Saga', 'original', 'version', '1969.ALL', 'characters', 'new', 'version', 'are', 'miscast.Soames', 'portrayed', 'too', 'mean', 'too', 'wooden.Young', 'Jo', 'too', 'young', 'uncharacteristically', 'cruel.Irene', 'listless', 'most', 'jarring', 'note', 'Fleur.She', 'portrayed', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'completely', 'selfish', 'incredibly', 'manipulative.Galsworthy', 'Fleur', 'was', 'angel', 'had', 'qualities', 'brightness', 'kindness', 'well.She', 'also', 'possessive', 'tells', 'Michael', 'so', 'soon', 'are', 'married.However', 'most', 'jarring', 'note', 'production', 'production', 'itself.Part', '1', 'departed', 'greatly', 'books', 'detriment', 'story.But', 'Part', '2', 'exceeds', 'even', 'Galsworthy', 'narrative', 'ground', 'dances', 'Examples', 'Young', 'Jo', 'would', 'NEVER', 'go', 'Fleur', 'whom', 'reveal', 'secret', 'fatal', 'illness.Irene', 'would', 'never', 'scream', 'Jon', 'have', 'hysterical', 'episode.Jon', 'too', 'innocent', 'have', 'sex', 'Fleur', 'father', 'funeral.Soames', 'would', 'sooner', 'die', 'tell', 'Fleur', 'dishonoring', 'Irene.And', 'Fleur', 'would', 'not', 'turn', 'screaming', 'harpy', 'when', 'Jon.Then', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'patching', 'up', 'leaving', 'Robin', 'Hill', 'smile', 'face', 'spring', 'step', 'PLEASE', 'story', 'set', '1920', 'different', 'world', 'own.The', 'world', 'portrayed', '2002', 'just', ""n't"", 'wash.The', 'original', '1969', 'version', 'got', 'huge', 'audience', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'inspired', 'acting.The', 'new', '2002', 'version', 'rely', 'sex', 'violence', 'attract', 'audience.It', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'broke', 'underestimating', 'taste', 'today', 'viewing', 'public.If', 'want', 'own', 'outstanding', 'version', 'Saga', 'buy', 'dvd', 'video', 'set', 'original', '1969', 'version.It', 'still', 'available', 'purchase', 'Amazon']","The Forsyte Saga, Series 2"

Series 1 had some promise, but there were already changes to the plot that we didn't like - even with wholesale borrowing of entire scene storyboards from the 1967 series - it was beautiful with great costumes and lavish sets but not quite up to snuff.But with Series 2 - what a true disappointment! The director screwed up the timeline, changed character speeches from one to the other, messing with their motives, and just slopped together some hyper-sexual melodrama lacking the emotional complexity and sophistication of the book and the 1967 series. This is a very unsatisfactory ending - great costumes but truly a troubling tinkering.Save your sofa time for the earlier 1967 masterpiece - sure - some of the actors' speaking in scenes may seem rushed (like they are trying to get a lot into little time) and the sets chintzy (could make a drinking game of walls wobbling when someone slams a door) but by no means did the director try to instill some mid-late 20th century archetype of rebellious/sullen/spoiled teenagers into a Victorian/Edwardian world where you were either a child or you weren't.

One day, in a gallery run by their cousin June, Fleur and Soames run into a young man named Jon Forsyte, who seems to be some sort of relation, but one whom Soames does not care to know or even meet.  Fleur and Jon are attracted to each other and intrigued by the mystery of why their parents keep shying away from each other.  Jon's parents, Jolyon and Irene, hint that there was some sort of past conflict, but will say no more than that.Naturally, the fact that their parents are bitterly opposed to their meeting again cause Fleur and Jon to contrive more encounters, eventually falling in love and making plans for their elopement.  In the process they also discover the true story of their parents' pasts, with devastating results.This is a beautiful follow up to the first ""new"" series of The Forsyte Saga.  Once again the producers took a huge risk in attempting a remake of what is universally remembered as the epitome of British television, the original Forsyte Saga from the 1960s.

793390,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00015GA8A,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","For most of the four episodes of ""The Forsyte Saga, Series 2"" (a.k.a. ""The Forstye Sage: To Let"") I had a sense of disappointment that it was just not as good as the first part, produced a year earlier.  I was able to trace my feelings to a couple of key points.  First, I had never read the John Galsworthy novels and had not seen either the 1949 Hollywood film ""That Forsyte Woman"" with Errol Flynn and Greer Garson or the the 1967 BBC production with Eric Porter, Nyree Dawn Porter, and Kenneth More.  So when I watched Series 1 it was all news to me.  Then, unwilling to wait for Series 2 to make it across the Pond, I went ahead and watched the 1967 version.  That meant that with Series 2 the story was not new to me and I was aware of some plot lines that were missing.Second, Series 1 ended with the most powerful scene in the entire story.  The tragic Soames Forsyte (Damien Lewis), having seen his first wife Irene (Gina McKee) leave him for his cousin Jolyon (Rupert Graves) and bear for him the son she refused to give him, has remarried and his wife is finally having his child.  But the birth was difficult and Soames had to decide if the doctor should operate, which would kill the baby but save his wife, or risk both their lives on the slim chance they would both live.  Soames takes the risk and is rewarded by the birth of a daughter and not the male heir he desired.  Then word came that his father was dying and Soames rushed to the old man's side to announce the birth of his son.  His father died happy hearing the lie and Soames returned to his home to be told that his wife would never be able to have another child.  But when Soames looks at his daughter for the first time, his heart warms to her.  It was a marvelous moment and a great performance by Lewis and I watched Series 2 knowing that it was not going to be equalled let alone surpassed.On the one hand I was certainly right.  The final great irony of the Forsyte Saga is that Soame's daughter Fleur (Emma Griifiths Malin) and young Jon Forsyte (Lee Williams), daughter of Irene and Jolyon, manage to meet and fall in love to the absolute horror of their parents.  The young couple, of course, do not know about the ugly circumstances under which Irene left Soames long before they were born, and nobody is eager to tell them the story.  Eventually it will come out and result in the less than happy circumstances that we have come to expect in this particular soap opera.  This is not a saga in which everybody lives happily ever after.The good news and the bad news is that I liked the final scene of this production.  This is good because it salvaged Series 2 for me at a point when I was close to regretting the sense of anticipation I had enjoyed waiting for it to come out on DVD.  The bad part is that it is a scene that created for this version and not part of either the original novel or BBC series.  The climax of a work is not exactly the part to go off text as far as I am concerned and I am glad I was not as familiar with Galsworthy's work as are others who have taken this production to task for various changes and additions they see as violating his original vision.  That is why I was able to enjoy Series 2 well enough, while still thinking it falls short of the greatness of Series 1.Whoever wrote this adaptation seemed to have been as captivated by Soames' character as I was, and determined to give him another big moment that decidedly changes the meaning and import of the entire saga.  The return of Annette (Beatriz Batarda) into Soames' life helps to set up the final scene, so it is not like it is it was just tacked on to the story.  But I missed the way Soames struggled with the demands of modern art, which is now replaced by the symbolic irony of juxtaposing Irene playing modern music on her piano while Soames purchases a player piano.  Galsworthy made his point with considerably more depth, which is what I wanted this time around as well.  Series 2 really is reduced to the story of Fleur and Jon as something of Soames and Irene the next generation, and obvious ""The Forstye Saga"" is on a grander scale than that.",4,What?

793398,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B00015GA8A,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[6, 10]","Those familiar with the first ""Forsyte Saga"" needs no introduction to ""Forsyte Saga: To Let"" which is based on John Galsworthy's novel.  I admit that I have not read Galsworthy's novel but I certainly enjoyed this series as well as series 1.  I will then review this dvd based on its own merit and without making comparisons to the novel.One of the major strengths of ""To Let"" is that it doesn't depend on ""Forsyte Saga Series 1"" (which I shall refer to ""Series 1"" hereafter) for audiences to understand and embrace it.  Familiarity with the characters of Series 1 certainly helps but a novice will take no time in getting absorbed with the story as it unfolds.  The strength of the screenplay is that it doesn't talk down to the audience but it also takes its time in introducing (or re-introducing) the varied characters from Series 1 (as well as a few newcomers).Soames and Annette Forsyte's daughter, Fleur, is now an indulged, strong-willed yet charming young woman.  Young Jolyon and Irene Forsyte's son, Jon, is now a handsome, sensitive and artistic young man.  The two meet and fall madly in love - much to the dismay and disapproval of their parents.  ""To Let"" centers on these young lovers as well as the dramatic lives of their affluent and proud families - Soames' long-standing feud with Jolyon and Irene; Soames and Annette's strained relationship; Annette and her sister-in-law Winifred's fascination with the Belgian playboy Prosper Prufond; and the dynamics of these relationships make for a compelling viewing.Like its predecessor, ""To Let"" possesses the high production values, fabulous locations, excellent acting and compelling storyline that made Series 1 a hit with fans.  Though produced by ITV, it has all the excellent production values that you would expect from a BBC series.  Rupert Graves (Young Jolyon), Gina McKee (Irene) and Damian Lewis (Soames) continue their excellent work from Series 1.  New additions Emma Griffiths Malin (Fleur) and Lee Williams (adorable as Jon) turn in pitch perfect performances as the young lovers.  I disagree with an earlier review that classifies Fleur as a ""spoiled brat, completely selfish and incredibly manipulative.""  On the contrary, I found Fleur to be rather likeable, sweet and even sympathetic.  She is ultimately a resourceful young woman who knows what she wants and goes for it.  She is also very much in love with Jon.  I also enjoyed the casting of Oliver Milburn (Michael Mont) whom I admired as Angel Clare in the equally excellent tv series ""Tess of D'Urbervilles"" (starring Justine Waddell).  One of the great advantages of Series 2 is the return of all of the principal actors from Series 1 (including Amanda Root as Winifred, Ben Miles as Montague Dartie and Julian Ovenden as Val Dartie).In short, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys excellent British drama.  ""To Let"" is an engrossing British soap opera based on the 1920's that deals with such universal themes of love, hate, forgiveness, greed, passion and possession.  I would rate the series 5-stars but only give 4-stars due to the lack of dvd special features.",4,Top notch British drama.

Unlike many of the reviews I loved series two more than series one.  By the time you have watched six episodes of Forsytes you will know them pretty well and as you watch Fluer and Jon try to unravel the mysteries of Forsyte History you can feel the emotions of every character and see where they are coming from.  As a plus I am infatuated with the Jazz era.  The clothes and the lifestyle are the backdrop for this eye-candy of a film.  The diffenerces between generations is always an interesting subject and it is a re-accuring theme here.  You see how London has changed, how Soames gasps at the revealing dresses his daughter wears, how Irene struggles to get her head around the new music and dancing.  I have not read the book or seen the 60's versions of either series so I can give an unbiased opinion.  I also can understand how sometimes in adaptations, certain things that work in print do not work on the screen, so it doesn't bother me when the screenwriters take liberties.  On it's own aside from previous versions, this is a fantastic movie with a deeply rooted story, multi-faceted characters, beautiful costumes and production, and fabulous acting.  Remember that most of the actors in this series have already played their respective characters for the epic first series and have mastered them.  That is the beauty of this series.  Some will complain that the characters are not significantly aged enough, but lets face it, many of these actors are supposed to span 40 years of their characters life between the two series, and make-up aging usually just looks frightening.

793403,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00015GA8A,Ms Winston,"[8, 14]","What a disappointment is Series 2 of Granada Televison's production of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, based upon John Galsworthy's novel &quot;To Let.&quot; Again, it is as though the producers and writers at Granada never read more than an outline of Galworthy's complex and richly detailed works. This time they were not content to make minor alterations to the plot....no, only a meat cleaver was good enough for the writers who adapted &quot;To Let&quot; for the screen. The film opens with a scene that never took place in the novel, where pre-teens Jon Forsyte (son of Young Jolyn &amp; Irene) and Fleur (daughter of Soames and Annette) meet and are instantly fast friends, in the way that children do. Seeing his daughter and the son of Jolyn &amp; Irene (his sworn enemies) playing in the garden turns Soames into a raving monster who in his rage almost strikes Jon. Damian Lewis as Soames frequently appears to be foaming at the mouth when ever he becomes angry...the scenery must have been in constant danger during the filming of this production. Other equally strange liberties were taken with the book, including Jon and Fleur making love right after his father's funeral, and a reconciliation of sorts between Soames and Irene that concludes Series 2 and which never happened in the books.Now, as to the more positive aspects of the production: Gena McKee was not nearly as annoying as the middle aged Irene as she was in Series 1, when she was supposed to be a young woman possessing a fatal beauty that attracted all men into her orbit. Her character was warmer and more sympathetic than in the first series. Rupert Graves was an excellent Young Jolyn, wise, loving, and scared of what would happen to his family upon his death. I thought Emma Griffiths Malin was a more-than-adequate Fleur, although she could not quite get the same subtle emotions across as did Susan Hampshire in the 1969 production of &quot;To Let.&quot; The character of Michael Mont was as charming and appealing in this version as it was in the original, but Lee Williams as Jon left much to be desired IMO, somewhat due to his too youthful appearance.This series gave us more insight into the relationship between Soames and Annette than did the original production, which was one case of the new series being more faithful to the book than was the 1969 version, where Annette simply disappeared never to be seen again after her relationship with Profond was discovered. However, that alone cannot make up for a deeply flawed script and the over-the-top acting of Damien Lewis. I really feel Mr Lewis could have benefited by watching the original Soames, the great Eric Porter, who had most viewers eating out of his hand by the end of the 26 episodes of the 1969 series. I hardly think that will be the case here.",3,What Did They Do to My Galsworthy...again?,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,2804,"['What', 'disappointment', 'Series', '2', 'Granada', 'Televison', 'production', 'quot', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'quot', 'based', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'novel', 'quot', 'Let.', 'quot', 'Again', 'producers', 'writers', 'Granada', 'never', 'read', 'more', 'outline', 'Galworthy', 'complex', 'richly', 'detailed', 'works', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'content', 'make', 'minor', 'alterations', 'plot', '.no', 'only', 'meat', 'cleaver', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'writers', 'who', 'adapted', 'quot', 'Let', 'quot', 'screen', 'film', 'scene', 'never', 'took', 'place', 'novel', 'where', 'pre-teens', 'Jon', 'Forsyte', 'son', 'Young', 'Jolyn', 'amp', 'Irene', 'Fleur', 'daughter', 'Soames', 'Annette', 'meet', 'are', 'instantly', 'fast', 'friends', 'way', 'children', 'do', 'Seeing', 'daughter', 'son', 'Jolyn', 'amp', 'Irene', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'playing', 'garden', 'Soames', 'raving', 'monster', 'who', 'rage', 'almost', 'strikes', 'Jon', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Soames', 'frequently', 'be', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'when', 'ever', 'angry', 'scenery', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'constant', 'danger', 'filming', 'production', 'Other', 'equally', 'strange', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'book', 'including', 'Jon', 'Fleur', 'making', 'love', 'right', 'father', 'funeral', 'reconciliation', 'sorts', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'Series', '2', 'never', 'happened', 'books.Now', 'more', 'positive', 'aspects', 'production', 'Gena', 'McKee', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'annoying', 'middle', 'aged', 'Irene', 'was', 'Series', '1', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'woman', 'possessing', 'fatal', 'beauty', 'attracted', 'men', 'orbit', 'character', 'was', 'warmer', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'first', 'series', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'was', 'excellent', 'Young', 'Jolyn', 'wise', 'loving', 'scared', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'family', 'death', 'thought', 'Emma', 'Griffiths', 'Malin', 'was', 'more-than-adequate', 'Fleur', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'same', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'did', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', '1969', 'production', 'quot', 'Let.', 'quot', 'character', 'Michael', 'Mont', 'was', 'charming', 'appealing', 'version', 'was', 'original', 'Lee', 'Williams', 'Jon', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'IMO', 'somewhat', 'due', 'too', 'youthful', 'appearance.This', 'series', 'gave', 'more', 'insight', 'relationship', 'Soames', 'Annette', 'did', 'original', 'production', 'was', 'one', 'case', 'new', 'series', 'being', 'more', 'faithful', 'book', 'was', '1969', 'version', 'where', 'Annette', 'simply', 'disappeared', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'relationship', 'Profond', 'was', 'discovered', 'However', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'script', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'really', 'feel', 'Mr', 'Lewis', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'watching', 'original', 'Soames', 'great', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'viewers', 'eating', 'hand', 'end', '26', 'episodes', '1969', 'series', 'hardly', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'here']","The Forsyte Saga, Series 2"

793419,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,B00015GA8A,SusieQ,"[21, 28]","I disliked Series One of the new FORSYTE SAGA for many reasons, but I'll try to be fair to Series Two (the story of Jon and Fleur).  First let me say the things I liked about Part Two of the series:-- The actors playing Jon & Fleur are good actors -- with the exception of Fleur's ""screaming scene"" at Robin Hill after she and Soames go there, and she's rejected finally by Jon.  I almost have to let that pass because this embarrassingly melodramatic scene is really the director and the script's fault, not the actress's.  I admit I only kept watching Part 2 because these actors were so attractive together.  The actor who played Michael Mont was good too, although they didn't give him much depth to work with.-- I did like the scene where, in the last few minutes before Fleur's wedding, when Soames confesses to her about what he did during his marriage to Irene, and how painful it is to him that Irene should only remember that whenever she looks at him.  (This is not in the book, and never would have happened in the original-- Soames Forsyte, talk with his daughter about what he did in his prior marriage?  But it's a tightly written, restrained emotional scene, and Damien Lewis played it well.)And THAT'S ABOUT IT.  There is SO much wrong with this adaptation-- not following Galsworthy's book more faithfully, for one.  To deviate from the original story, in so many important respects.  Like, Jon & Fleur having sex?  How 21st century -- but not in 1921.  And especially having sex, AFTER the revelation of what happened between Soames and Irene?  There is so much that's GOOD in Galsworthy's Forsyte novels -- why did the writer(s) of this TV dramatization think they could ""improve"" on them?The Prosper Profond character, a minor character in To Let, here is blown up into someone who interferes in most of the character's lives.  The miscasting of Gina McKee as Irene is another (continued) fault and a continuing major flaw.  She looked even less beautiful ""old"", than she did young.Then there's the fact that the writers turned the character of ""Young"" Jolyon into this strident, yelling, negative force, instead of the quietly tolerant, thoughtful character he really is.  There's the fact that no one told Damien Lewis that not moving his arms when he walks makes him look like a zombie.  I know he was trying to show Soames as a repressed Victorian fortress of a man, but... Generally I love Damien Lewis's acting ability, but I don't know if his playing Soames Forsyte was miscasting, or I'll just be generous to him and say, since the director, writers and producer of this series basically got everything else wrong, their take on Soames was wrong too, and he had to follow their lead.If I hadn't read the original novels, would I have enjoyed this series?  Probably, yes, I might have (except for the really over-the-top scenes).  If I wasn't aware of how good the original novels are, and how dishonest this adaptation is to Galsworthy, AND to the times in which it's set, I might have enjoyed it.  In a chick-lit soap-opera sorta way, I guess.I'm guessing the producers are NOT going to film the remaining Forsythe novels, since they've already showed Jon & Fleur having sex, and Irene & Soames shook hands at the end, so they have nothing else to dramatize.  Thank God for small blessings!  Or will we get a Fleur pregnant by Jon, and passing the baby off as Michael's?  OH, please NO...did I just give the writers an idea?
