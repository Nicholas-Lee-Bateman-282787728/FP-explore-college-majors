748507,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B00008WJBH,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[6, 6]","I've come to know that if Sam Elliott is involved with a Louis L'Amour story you pretty much can't miss.  Such is the case with THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.  By now you know that this is nothing even remotely close to the movie of the same name starring Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman.The story involves a Pennsylvania couple that has gone west.  Lest you immediately think stereotype, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD features some departures from the usual ""good guy saves the day"" western clich&eacute;s. First of all Elliott, while the consummate good guy, is definitely a mischievous good guy.  And Tom Conti who plays the Pennsylvania man gone west is not your typical helpless pilgrim.  In fact, if you're like me, Conti's portrayal of Duncan McKaskel will have you smiling more and more before Elliott's Con Vallian rides of into the sunset.Kate Capshaw sparkles as Susanna McKaskel.  Vulnerable and yet tough, Susanna ends up, in my opinion, with the right man in the end.Matt Clark is wonderfully evil as Doc Shabbitt, the head of a gang of smelly western toughs bent on doing as much damage as possible.I found THE QUICK AND THE DEAD to be a wonderful western discovery that should get more credit than it has.  Some have criticized it for not being as good as the original Louis L'Amour book but, then, how many movies out there are able, in 90 to 120 minutes-or even in the epic proportions characteristic of most Costnerian Westerns-to tell the story as completely as print?

748509,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00008WJBH,a voice of reason,"[8, 13]","Sam Elliott seems to have been born to play a cowboy, but this made-for-cable outing is not his finest Western effort. The movie is a fairly obvious retelling of the storyline found in the Western classic ""Shane"": a mysterious drifter helps a pioneer family that is being terrorized by a gang of outlaws. The fact that even a great movie like ""Shane"" had its flaws (Shane rides across miles of mountainous country into town and the boy follows him all the way on foot?!?!) doesn't bode too well for any imitators (""Pale Rider"", Clint Eastwood's take on this storyline, wasn't anywhere near to being his finest Western either).A previous reviewer stated that the good guys are clearly good and the bad guys are clearly bad in this movie. That's true for everybody except Elliot's character, Con Valian. While Valian clearly helps the McKaskel family, for most of the movie he seems to be doing so in order to win away Susanna McKaskel from her husband. Only at the end of the movie, in order that our flawed hero might come out on top, does he grudgingly give respect to Duncan McKaskel and realize that he should not try to break up his family. Con Valian is quite a departure from the usual honorable-to-the-utmost Louis L'Amour cowboy hero.In spite of the questionable moral character of the hero he portrays, Elliot is still the best thing in this Western. Tom Conti doesn't have the acting chops to keep up with Elliot, and Matt Clark (as lead bad guy Doc Shabitt) may bear some resemblence to Bruce Dern, but he doesn't approach Dern's acting ability. The scenes between Kenny Morrison, as McKaskel's son, and Elliott are almost laughable because the kid's acting is so stilted, especially in the scene in which he defends his father. The rest of the outlaws are cliched to the point of almost being caricatures.I'm a big fan of Westerns, and I understand the genre and its cliches; I even appreciate them (as I said, I'm a fan). However, I also appreciate a good story and good acting, and this movie is a bit weak on both (with all due respect to Louis L'Amour and especially Sam Elliott).The bottom line: this is by no means one of the worst Westerns ever filmed, but it's certainly not a first-rate one either. If you're a fan of Westerns, you should see it at least once; otherwise, it's probably one that can be missed. (But if you want to watch Sam Elliott in a much better adaptation of a Louis L'Amour novel, then get the TNT-produced movie ""Conagher""; see my review of that movie for more info.).",3,"An uneven retread of ""Shane""",1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,2511,"['Sam', 'Elliott', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'play', 'cowboy', 'made-for-cable', 'outing', 'not', 'finest', 'Western', 'effort', 'movie', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'retelling', 'storyline', 'found', 'Western', 'classic', 'Shane', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'pioneer', 'family', 'being', 'terrorized', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'fact', 'even', 'great', 'movie', 'Shane', 'had', 'flaws', 'Shane', 'miles', 'mountainous', 'country', 'town', 'boy', 'way', 'foot', ""n't"", 'bode', 'too', 'well', 'imitators', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'take', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'being', 'finest', 'Western', '.A', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'clearly', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'clearly', 'bad', 'movie', 'true', 'everybody', 'Elliot', 'character', 'Con', 'Valian', 'Valian', 'clearly', 'McKaskel', 'family', 'most', 'movie', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'order', 'win', 'away', 'Susanna', 'McKaskel', 'husband', 'Only', 'end', 'movie', 'order', 'flawed', 'hero', 'might', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'grudgingly', 'give', 'respect', 'Duncan', 'McKaskel', 'realize', 'should', 'not', 'try', 'break', 'up', 'family', 'Con', 'Valian', 'quite', 'departure', 'usual', 'honorable-to-the-utmost', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'cowboy', 'hero.In', 'spite', 'questionable', 'moral', 'character', 'hero', 'Elliot', 'still', 'best', 'thing', 'Western', 'Tom', 'Conti', ""n't"", 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'keep', 'up', 'Elliot', 'Matt', 'Clark', 'lead', 'bad', 'guy', 'Doc', 'Shabitt', 'may', 'bear', 'resemblence', 'Bruce', 'Dern', ""n't"", 'approach', 'Dern', 'acting', 'ability', 'scenes', 'Kenny', 'Morrison', 'McKaskel', 'son', 'Elliott', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'kid', 'acting', 'so', 'stilted', 'especially', 'scene', 'father', 'rest', 'outlaws', 'are', 'cliched', 'point', 'almost', 'being', 'caricatures.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'understand', 'genre', 'cliches', 'even', 'appreciate', 'said', ""'m"", 'fan', 'However', 'also', 'appreciate', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', 'bit', 'weak', 'due', 'respect', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'especially', 'Sam', 'Elliott', '.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'means', 'one', 'worst', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'filmed', 'certainly', 'not', 'first-rate', 'one', 'either', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Westerns', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'otherwise', 'probably', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'missed', 'want', 'watch', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'much', 'better', 'adaptation', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'then', 'get', 'TNT-produced', 'movie', 'Conagher', 'see', 'review', 'movie', 'more', 'info']",N/A

Louis L'Amour  wrote  over  200  books in  his  lifetime,  and  at  the  time of his  death,  1988, at  age  80,  had  over  200,000,000  audited  sales.Not  too  bad  for an old  schooler,  with a typewriter, and  some  white  sheets  of  paper.The ""Quick and the Dead"" I am  reviewing  today, is a  film that has  reached  an almost cult  following, due to it's  realistic  portrayals, fast  action,  thoughtful  shot  selctions and,  certainly, some  darn  fine  casting.Duncan  and  Susanna McKaskel  and  are  polite  Easterners, who  are  making their way, with everything  they  own, west, to a  little  place they've  inherited, where  they  might be able to  live their  lives,  and raise  their son, in  peace.They  stop at a tiny little  watering  hole,  where  there are a group of long-time  bad guys just sitting', having a  brewsky, and telling  tall tales.

There  are none,  so  McKaskell and wife and  son  continue  their  journey.Now,  along  with a  wagon-full  of fine,  expensive,  heirloom  quality  furniture,  they are  towing along  two,  really  fine  horses.  The group of  un-well-wishers  survey  the family  heading  away, rather thoughtfully.""Doc"", expertly  portrayed  by  veteran  character actor  Matt Clark, tells  his  crew  that ""them  horses""  might  just  fetch a  pretty  penny, and makes  some  other  comments  about what  other  goodies  might be  in their wagon.However...their  grizzy-bear  of  a  partner, ""Red"",  has  his  eyes  set  on  Susanna.Sometime  later...as  they are  about  to  have a  little dinner  and  coffee,  a stranger approaches  their  little  camp.  He  politely halts, and  queries  them if  he  might  come  in  for  coffee. They oblige  him.The  mystery  man,  is  Con Vallion, a man  of  the  wilderness, a professional survivor, and reveals to Duncan that  their two horses  have  been  purloined.  Duncan asks how  he  knows this, and:  why didn't he stop them ?"" Because  it's  none  of  my  business,""  Vallion  replies.  Vallion makes  alsoknown,  rather  uncondtionally, that he  deeply  appreciates  Mrs. McKaskel's  beauty.Kate  Capshaw,  who, at  that  exact time, was  married  to  Steven Spielberg, is  a  benchmark  of  American  beauty...therefore,  we,  also, are  (somewhat) sympathetic to  Con Vallion's remarks.

But...not  before  he carefully  explains  to  them that  he  knows who they are,  and  that his benefactors are  going to have a  problem  - a  big  problem -  with  them.Shortly  thereafter, Duncan  leves  their  camp  with a  large  bore  repeating  rifle,and  heads  back to the little  watering  hole, where  he  sees  his  two  horses.And  this  is where  the  real  story begins:Duncan  to  bad  guy:"" Uh..is  there a  preacher  around ?""Bad Guy to Duncan: "" A  what..? ""Duncan to Bad Guy:  "" You know...a  man of  the  cloth.""Bad Guy  back  to  Duncan: "" Well,  why would  we  need a  preacher?""Duncan  to  Bad Guy: "" ""'cause...I'd  hate  for  someone to  die  withoutbenefit of  clergy..."", he  says,  pointing  his  rifle at  the  Bad Guy.Duncan  leaves  with  his two horses.And  here,  I'm  going  to  tell  you  that  Con  Vallion  is  portrayed  bynone other  than  Mr. Sam Elliot, an  American  icon, and  actor,  and  experthorseman in  his  own  right.Con Vallion  becomes,  for a  time, their protector  and  advisor.  But,  notwithout  making  a  few  more  sincere verbal  gestures  about  how  veryfortunate  Duncan  is  to  be  in  the company  of  such a  feast-for-the-eyes,as  Susanna. This  gets  painfully old,  for  McKaskel.Now, in  L'Amour's  novel,  there's  no  defacto  romance  between  Con Vallionand Susanna  McKaskel,  just  a true  appreciation  for  her  cooking  and such.But, here, there's just a  touch more.This  is  a  fine  piece  directed  by a ( at  the  time ), a  65  year  oldBritish  director of some  vision and  brilliance,  Robert  Day.  Robert  Dayhad  worked  in the  USA several  times, and  in  the  late  1950s, producedwith  his  British  producing  partners, one  of  the great  little  jewels oflow-budget  sci-fi, the  horrific,  but  thoughtful,  ""First Man Into Space"".He  also  directed  "" Corridors of Blood"", a very  fine  little  piece  withthe Great Karloff,  as a fine  surgeon  in  1870s  England  that  discoversanesthesia.But, here, Robert Day's  application  of  careful  character developmentrelly shines !  The adaptation is  James Lee Barrett's  fine  work; the  musicis  by  Steven  Dorff,  and  Dorff's  music,  is  sentimental,  and  underscoresthe  emotional  content  of  the picture, quite  well.Sam Elliot's  impeccable  interpretation of L'Amour's  Vallion  is  certainlyworthy  of  note. Tom Conti, who  works  here,  and  in  England,  is  workinga  character that  I think is difficult  to  develop:  In interpreting  McKaskel,he  has a  chance  to  overindulge  his  emotions  going  either  way...eithertoo  nerdy/bookish...or to  overcompensate and turn into John Wayne-Lite,  andstruggle  with out-doing  the  Vallion  character.  But,  Robert  Day  showedthat  he  can make  casting  decisions  that  are  amazing  and  profitable.You  can get  a  copy  of  this  1987  L'Amour  Western  actioner,  now, atAMAZON.COM.And  then,  settle back  for  some  real  adventure  with  one  of  the mostloved  and  cherished  Western actor/heros....Sam Elliot...in  one of  hismost  remarkable  characters...L'Amour's Con  Vallion, Adventurer.By  the  way, your  author, along  the  way,  picked  up  his  country'shighest  honor...the  Congressional  Medal of  Honor, from Ronald Wilson Reagan.Later,H.

Louis L'Amour captured the west in his novels in ways we like to remember it, with roughness combined with human feelings. Sam Elliot, with his heavy mustache that is longer than his mouth, sideway looks with half closed eyes that people call looks of steel, deep voice, slow sure movements, and aura of masculinity, is the perfect westerner, especially when he plays a man who knows how to handle himself and a gun. Thus, viewers seeking a good western will find it here.Sam Elliot plays such a man in 1876 wild Wyoming. He is enraptured by the wife of a man who is taking her and her son west, in a wagon, alone. The man had served in the Civil War and no longer wants to use a gun. The family is pursued by a band of eight men, including an Indian who led a band who killed Elliot's mother. Elliot had been chasing after the Indian for some 300 miles and the Indian joined the band of killers as the eighth man. Almost spell-binded by the wife, who he considers beautiful, as she is, and as he keeps telling her husband, Elliot decides to help the ""pilgrims"" against the killers who want to take their wagon, horses, mules, everything in the wagon, and rape the wife.",5,Superb story and acting,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,1250,"['hard', 'ruin', 'film', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'captured', 'west', 'novels', 'ways', 'like', 'remember', 'roughness', 'combined', 'human', 'feelings', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'heavy', 'mustache', 'longer', 'mouth', 'sideway', 'half', 'closed', 'eyes', 'people', 'call', 'steel', 'deep', 'voice', 'slow', 'sure', 'movements', 'aura', 'masculinity', 'perfect', 'westerner', 'especially', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'handle', 'gun', 'Thus', 'viewers', 'seeking', 'good', 'western', 'will', 'find', 'here.Sam', 'Elliot', 'plays', 'such', 'man', '1876', 'wild', 'Wyoming', 'enraptured', 'wife', 'man', 'who', 'taking', 'son', 'west', 'wagon', 'alone', 'man', 'had', 'served', 'Civil', 'War', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'gun', 'family', 'pursued', 'band', 'eight', 'men', 'including', 'Indian', 'who', 'led', 'band', 'who', 'killed', 'Elliot', 'mother', 'Elliot', 'had', 'been', 'chasing', 'Indian', '300', 'miles', 'Indian', 'joined', 'band', 'killers', 'eighth', 'man', 'Almost', 'spell-binded', 'wife', 'who', 'beautiful', 'telling', 'husband', 'Elliot', 'help', 'pilgrims', 'killers', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'wagon', 'horses', 'mules', 'everything', 'wagon', 'rape', 'wife']",N/A

Like all Louis L'Amour novels, the loner and very masculine, sensual cowboy is always the charismatic main character.  Sam Elliot was made for this part......There is nothing really earthshaking about this film except maybe the brief love scenes between Elliot (Con Vallian) and Cate Capshaw (Susanna - a married woman) that are very well done and very sensual.  Susanna finds this stranger to be terribly  exciting even though she fights the feelings he rouses in her.  She loves her husband, absolutely, but she  lusts for, respects, admires and is grateful to Elliot.  You will be drawn to him too if you are any kind of female.  He IS the dark stranger that saves this family over and over again from real harm and watches out for them all the way to the valley of The Little Big Horn where they are planning to make their home and raise cattle.  This is simply a very good, romantic western and is easy to watch.  I love the dialogue Vallian uses when talking privately to Susanna such as ""I got a lot of feelings for you ma'am.  Another time, another place Ms.McKaskel I would have chased you till you dropped"".  You will love the relationship that grows and is depicted between Vallian and Susanna's young son.

Escaping their violent memories of the Civil War, they run into Wyoming Territory where a man (and in this case, a woman) settle their problems with a gun.  They are befriended by a nomadic western ranger, Con Vallian, who is reminisient of John Wayne's character Hondo.  Mr. Vallian (Sam Elliott), takes a personal interest in the wife of the pilgrims, Susanna McKaskel (Kate Capshaw).  Not wanting harm to come to Susanna, Vallian becomes their guardian angel, as they are pursued by eight ruthless theives that are intent on taking everything they own and having their way with Susanna.Sam Elliott's role as Vallian is an admirable 5-star performance, which establishes him as a premier western star in the post John Wayne era.  Sheperd brings his character to life with his deep resonant voice, his glowering smoldering eyes,  and his ruggedly handsome good looks.  Elliott's Vallian is a pragmatic character who would not mind taking over husbandly duties with Susanna, should anything happen to her husband Duncan.  As the story unfolds, Vallian builds a grudging respect for Duncan, seeing the steady grit inside the man.Kate Capshaw plays Susanna McKaskel, and is the obvious reason for Vallian's interest in the family.  Capshaw is truly a strikingly beautiful woman; however, she is also a strikingly good actress and carries off the part of a pioneering woman with ease.  Her performance matches Sam Elliot's scene for scene.The story unfolds quickly and there is a level of tension thoughout the movie that keeps you in your seat.  You will not be disappointed in this movie.  I intend to move it to my ""keeper"" movie shelf with my other western classics.  It deserves its place there.Jim Konedog Koenig",5,A 5-Star Modern Day Western,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2078,"['believed', 'great', 'western', 'films', 'died', 'passing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'have', 'news', 'western', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Duke.Based', 'story', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'Quick', 'Dead', 'fast-paced', 'western', 'Duncan', 'Susanna', 'McKaskel', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'traveling', 'continent', 'settle', 'Big', 'Horn', 'Mountains', '1876', 'Escaping', 'violent', 'memories', 'Civil', 'War', 'run', 'Wyoming', 'Territory', 'where', 'man', 'case', 'woman', 'settle', 'problems', 'gun', 'are', 'befriended', 'nomadic', 'western', 'ranger', 'Con', 'Vallian', 'who', 'reminisient', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'Hondo', 'Mr.', 'Vallian', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'personal', 'interest', 'wife', 'pilgrims', 'Susanna', 'McKaskel', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Not', 'wanting', 'harm', 'come', 'Susanna', 'Vallian', 'guardian', 'angel', 'are', 'pursued', 'eight', 'ruthless', 'theives', 'are', 'intent', 'taking', 'everything', 'own', 'having', 'way', 'Susanna.Sam', 'Elliott', 'role', 'Vallian', 'admirable', '5-star', 'performance', 'premier', 'western', 'star', 'post', 'John', 'Wayne', 'era', 'Sheperd', 'character', 'life', 'deep', 'resonant', 'voice', 'glowering', 'smoldering', 'eyes', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'good', 'looks', 'Elliott', 'Vallian', 'pragmatic', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'taking', 'over', 'husbandly', 'duties', 'Susanna', 'should', 'anything', 'happen', 'husband', 'Duncan', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Vallian', 'grudging', 'respect', 'Duncan', 'seeing', 'steady', 'grit', 'man.Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Susanna', 'McKaskel', 'obvious', 'reason', 'Vallian', 'interest', 'family', 'Capshaw', 'truly', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'however', 'also', 'strikingly', 'good', 'actress', 'off', 'part', 'pioneering', 'woman', 'ease', 'performance', 'matches', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'scene', 'scene.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'quickly', 'level', 'tension', 'movie', 'seat', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'intend', 'move', 'keeper', 'movie', 'shelf', 'other', 'western', 'classics', 'place', 'there.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",N/A

Otherwise, they're both soft-talkin' straight-shootin' half-breeds who live outdoors but who like women. The mysterious stranger who appears in the nick of time is also kin to Shane, who is not only appealing to the Woman, but her small son. Also, akin to the plot of Shane,  the husband is a real man...he's just outnumbered. A gang of theives has their eye on the ""pilgrims,"" their horses, and the comely Mrs. McCaskell (Kate Capshaw). There is no law around to appeal to, they just have to keep riding through open country and hope they can outrun the gang that is pursuing the family. Vallian appears and dispenses pithy advice, and it's clear that his help is offered for the protection of the woman. If he shows the husband at a disadvantage, well, that's just too bad. Fortunately for the woman, her husband (Tom Conti) isn't an Eastern sissy, even though he's suspiciously well educated. He's a veteran of the Union Army and an abolitionist. Conti performs with dignity and good humor. He can't be more romantic than the rangy stranger, and he knows it - but he's banking on his wife's fidelity and the innate decency he senses in Vallian. Sam Elliott is nearly peerless at this kind of role; his excellence in a Louis L'Amour western is a given. I'll take a dozen, thank you. But this film owes a good deal of its tension and fascination to the contest between the two honorable men, thanks to Conti... We just know triumph over the bad guys is just a matter of time.

The ring leader is played by Matt Clark, who looks nothing like his counter part in the book, but is more than up to the task of playing the nasty, back shooting Doc Shabbit. Great scenery and good acting are a plus in this film. And it sticks fairly close to the book. The biggest change in a character from the book was the Indian traveling with the bad guys.

748568,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00008WJBH,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","&#34;The Quick and the Dead&#34; is a 1987 made-for-HBO Western starring Sam Elliott as Con Vallian, a mysterious stranger who helps a family heading West with their conflict with a group of ne'er-do-wells. Vallian's desire is piqued by the wife (Kate Capshaw) and the interest seems mutual. Will the family make it to the Bighorn Mountains alive-and-well or will violence and adultery destroy them?If you don't remember Kate Capshaw, she was the blond in 1984's &#34;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&#34; and later married director Steven Spielberg.In any event, I was impressed with this little-know Western. Although made for cable, it's based on a Louis L'Armour book and is actually better than some theatrically released Westerns, like 1995's &#34;The Quick and the Dead&#34; (same name, but a totally different story). There are some flaws, like the kid's questionable acting skills and the fact that the film was noticeably shot in Northern Arizona rather than Eastern Wyoming, but &#8211; all things considered &#8211; this is a solid Western in the tradition of &#34;Shane&#34; and &#34;Will Penny.&#34;Highlights include the breathtaking cinematography, a believable and mature tone, Kate's beauty, a hackneyed plot redeemed by quality characters (like Tom Conti as the settler husband/father), insightful drama & plot surprises and, of course, Sam Elliott as the quintessential Westerner. Really, Elliott is as good or &#8211; more likely &#8211; better than any Western icon you care to name (Wayne, Eastwood, Cooper, Scott, Stewart, Costner, etc.).There are mature and insightful themes, like the undeniable connection of Vallian and Susanna. Most of us can relate: You stumble across someone of the opposite sex and instinctively sense a palpable connection, some kind of profound mutual fascination, yet&#8212;for whatever reason&#8212;pursuing an intimate relationship is not an option. In an entire lifetime you will only experience a handful such 'connections,' or less. These exchanges are permanent because they are so potent they are forever burned into one's psyche.&#34;The Quick and the Dead&#34; may not be a top-notch Western like &#34;Dances With Wolves&#34; or &#34;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&#34; but it's certainly a quality Western and well worth your time.GRADE: B",4,Hackneyed plot with mature insights and surprises,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,2298,"['34', 'Quick', 'Dead', '34', '1987', 'made-for-HBO', 'Western', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Con', 'Vallian', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'family', 'heading', 'West', 'conflict', 'group', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'Vallian', 'desire', 'piqued', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'interest', 'mutual', 'Will', 'family', 'make', 'Bighorn', 'Mountains', 'alive-and-well', 'will', 'violence', 'adultery', 'destroy', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'was', 'blond', '1984', '34', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', '34', 'later', 'married', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.In', 'event', 'was', 'impressed', 'little-know', 'Western', 'made', 'cable', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Armour"", 'book', 'actually', 'better', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Westerns', '1995', '34', 'Quick', 'Dead', '34', 'same', 'name', 'totally', 'different', 'story', 'are', 'flaws', 'kid', 'questionable', 'acting', 'skills', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'noticeably', 'shot', 'Northern', 'Arizona', 'rather', 'Eastern', 'Wyoming', '8211', 'things', 'considered', '8211', 'solid', 'Western', 'tradition', '34', 'Shane', '34', '34', 'Will', 'Penny.', '34', 'Highlights', 'include', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'believable', 'mature', 'tone', 'Kate', 'beauty', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'redeemed', 'quality', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'settler', 'husband/father', 'insightful', 'drama', 'plot', 'surprises', 'course', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'quintessential', 'Westerner', 'Really', 'Elliott', 'as', 'good', '8211', 'more', 'likely', '8211', 'better', 'Western', 'icon', 'care', 'name', 'Wayne', 'Eastwood', 'Cooper', 'Scott', 'Stewart', 'Costner', 'etc', 'are', 'mature', 'insightful', 'themes', 'undeniable', 'connection', 'Vallian', 'Susanna', 'Most', 'can', 'relate', 'stumble', 'someone', 'opposite', 'sex', 'instinctively', 'sense', 'palpable', 'connection', 'kind', 'profound', 'mutual', 'fascination', 'yet', '8212', 'reason', '8212', 'pursuing', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'not', 'option', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'will', 'only', 'experience', 'handful', 'such', ""'connections"", 'less', 'exchanges', 'are', 'permanent', 'are', 'so', 'potent', 'are', 'forever', 'burned', 'one', 'psyche.', '34', 'Quick', 'Dead', '34', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'top-notch', 'Western', '34', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '34', '34', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', '34', 'certainly', 'quality', 'Western', 'well', 'time.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
