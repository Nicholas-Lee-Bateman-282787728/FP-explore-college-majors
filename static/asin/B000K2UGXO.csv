1030234,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000K2UGXO,Alex Udvary,"[2, 3]","""All the King's Men"" has turned out to be pretty much a failure on all levels. The movies cost an estimated 55 millions dollars. It grossed a little more than seven million.[...]Why has this film been damned by the critics and the public? When I first heard about this film, I thought it was a sure Oscar contender. In fact it was suppose to be released last year, but was delayed.I guess that was when the negative press started to come in. Many people feel if a movie is held back there must be a reason behind it. The reason, it is felt, is usually because the film is bad, but, because the studios put so much money into a film, they went to at least attempt to make some sort of profit.Even if this is true I still think there was another reason ""All the King's Men"" failied so miserably. Many people thought the film was going to have a Liberal bias. If you hadn't heard one of the film's executive producers was Democrat strategist James Carville. Plus many people know about actor Sean Penn's political views.Because of this, many people thought the film was going to be a love letter to the Democrat party. I believe that's what ultimately hurt the film.So what is ""All the King's Men"" about? Was, first of all it was based on a novel by Robert Penn Warner and was adapted to the screen a few times before. Two TV verisons I believe and the most popular verison is the 1949 Oscar winning film.So there's a good chance some of you already know the basic story-line. The film revolves around Willie Stark (Sean Penn). A local ""hick"" (his term not mine) who wants to help the working class poor. He's a no nonsense kind of guy, a Mr. Deeds type if you will.One day Stark is offered an opportunity to run for Governor of Louisiana, of course with the help of a couple of strong arms headed by Tiny Duff (James Gandolfini).At first Stark has no idea he is really being used to split the working-class vote so another candidate can win.The film then becomes about Stark's struggle to do good while at the same time fallen victim to the corruption of politics. Especially as Congress is about to vote on whether or not to impeach Mr. Stark.Lots of people will say the director, Steven Zaillian, is making, or at least trying to make a political statement about our current times. Even if that was true, so what? People say that like it's a bad thing.""All the King's Men"" has some great acting in it, and not only from Penn, whom really does some Oscar caliber work here. But there is a fine performance from a man we all know Sean Penn thinks is one of our best actors, Jude Law.Law plays Jack Burden, the film is told from his point of view, who is a newspaper writer who later works for Stark. And then there Anothy Hopkins as Judge Irwin, a man who starts the impeachmen talks against Stark.In fact every performance in this film is wonderful to watch. The directing by Zaillian is good. And camerawork is nice. In general it is a solid, entertaining piece of filmmaking that doesn't deserve the bad rep it is getting.""All the King's Men"" plays with some interesting ideas about corruption and power, has a great performance given by Penn, and worthwhile directing. In short it is one of the better films made this year!Bottom-line: Sadly condemned film that deserves a first chance. Sean Penn leads the pack with stellar work as always but the supporting characters are just as fun to watch. A solid enetertaining piece of filmmaking.",4,"""King"" Size Entertainment?",1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3440,"['King', 'Men', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'failure', 'levels', 'movies', 'cost', 'estimated', '55', 'millions', 'dollars', 'grossed', 'little', 'more', 'seven', 'million.', '[', ']', 'Why', 'film', 'been', 'damned', 'critics', 'public', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'sure', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'fact', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'delayed.I', 'guess', 'was', 'when', 'negative', 'press', 'started', 'come', 'Many', 'people', 'feel', 'movie', 'held', 'back', 'must', 'be', 'reason', 'reason', 'felt', 'usually', 'film', 'bad', 'studios', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'film', 'went', 'least', 'attempt', 'make', 'sort', 'profit.Even', 'true', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'reason', 'King', 'Men', 'failied', 'so', 'miserably', 'Many', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'Liberal', 'bias', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'one', 'film', 'executive', 'producers', 'was', 'Democrat', 'strategist', 'James', 'Carville', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'political', 'views.Because', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'love', 'letter', 'Democrat', 'party', 'believe', 'what', 'ultimately', 'hurt', 'film.So', 'what', 'King', 'Men', 'Was', 'first', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'Warner', 'was', 'adapted', 'screen', 'few', 'times', 'before', 'Two', 'TV', 'verisons', 'believe', 'most', 'popular', 'verison', '1949', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film.So', 'good', 'chance', 'already', 'know', 'basic', 'story-line', 'film', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'local', 'hick', 'term', 'not', 'mine', 'who', 'help', 'working', 'class', 'poor', 'nonsense', 'kind', 'guy', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'type', 'will.One', 'day', 'Stark', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'run', 'Governor', 'Louisiana', 'course', 'help', 'couple', 'strong', 'arms', 'headed', 'Tiny', 'Duff', 'James', 'Gandolfini', '.At', 'first', 'Stark', 'idea', 'really', 'being', 'used', 'split', 'working-class', 'vote', 'candidate', 'can', 'win.The', 'film', 'then', 'Stark', 'struggle', 'do', 'good', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'fallen', 'victim', 'corruption', 'politics', 'Especially', 'Congress', 'vote', 'not', 'impeach', 'Mr.', 'Stark.Lots', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'director', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', 'making', 'least', 'trying', 'make', 'political', 'statement', 'current', 'times', 'Even', 'was', 'true', 'what', 'People', 'say', 'bad', 'thing', 'King', 'Men', 'great', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'Penn', 'whom', 'really', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'work', 'here', 'fine', 'performance', 'man', 'know', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'Jude', 'Law.Law', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'film', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'who', 'newspaper', 'writer', 'who', 'later', 'Stark', 'then', 'Anothy', 'Hopkins', 'Judge', 'Irwin', 'man', 'who', 'impeachmen', 'talks', 'Stark.In', 'fact', 'performance', 'film', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'directing', 'Zaillian', 'good', 'camerawork', 'nice', 'general', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'filmmaking', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'bad', 'rep', 'getting', 'King', 'Men', 'plays', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'corruption', 'power', 'great', 'performance', 'given', 'Penn', 'directing', 'short', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'made', 'year', 'Bottom-line', 'Sadly', 'condemned', 'film', 'first', 'chance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'pack', 'stellar', 'work', 'always', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'solid', 'enetertaining', 'piece', 'filmmaking']",All the King's Men
1030235,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000K2UGXO,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","THIS REVIEW IS BEING USED FOR BOTH THE SEAN PENN AND BRODERICK CRAWFORD VERSIONS OF ALL THE KING'S MENI have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a `populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the `little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George  Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of `little people' or anyone else, for that matter.The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially nave country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do `good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the `people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience Crawford wins this duel.

1030236,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000K2UGXO,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[2, 2]","It may be that judgment colored the comments of most reviewers but whatever colored them, the negative comments are washed away by superb acting and an overwhelmingly fine presentation of a place, era, and way of thinking probably foreign to most viewers, even from the U.S.Very possibly, as reviewer El Lagarto points out, a central problem is also ""the iconic nature of the source material,"" namely, the biography of corrupt populist Louisiana governor, Huey ""Kingfish"" Long---the man who called himself a ""hick"" and rose up by addressing other ""hicks""---many of whom had never voted before. I blush to tell, I've never read the famed Robert Penn Warren novel on which this film is based.But the movie perfectly captures the oppressively hot, humid Louisiana climate, along with the perennially corrupt political environment that endured throughout the 20th century and into our own era. It also precisely frames the grand antebellum plantation houses, wide lawns, live oak-lined dirt drives and swamps of south Louisiana, where the population is concentrated---along with the decadence for which New Orleans, from its very establishment, has always been deservedly renowned.The Willie Stark that Sean Penn manufactures is a Huey Long-look alike, and is totally believable. He has the accent, the swagger, and the deep south dead pan down cold, along with the ability to spin a highly colorful yarn based on a highly colorful southern analogy. There's no modern politics in this part. It's late 1920s and early 1930s Louisiana, the whole way. In context.That's undoubtedly another problem for most viewers. The environment established so firmly in this amazing political story is that it is so foreign to that of current-day U.S. population centers. Apparently,  few people can believe that anything like it ever existed in the U.S. But Louisiana has always been something of a world unto itself, and this was especially true during the Huey Long era.The actors, listed above, all contribute to the full-scale replication of that complex world, where a gentleman's honor and appearance account for almost everything. Most of the main characters (good guys and bad, alike) thus live beyond the reach of morality---power-hungry, afflicted with alcoholism, or eternally laboring to hide their personal shame or dirty laundry.This film's negative reception was totally unwarranted. Overall, it's an amazing dramatic accomplishment. For more than two hours, the movie held us rapt in another time, and a thoroughly fascinating place.--Alyssa A.

1030238,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000K2UGXO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I feel ashamed to say that I have still not seen the original take on this film.  I have not seen the 1949 film which so many claim to be a classic.  I really need to see that.  I will say this though, with as awful as the reviews were for this take I was surprised to actually like it a fair amount.  I didn't see the awfulness that so many critics claimed to be there, but then again, I'm not judging it against anything at this point.Maybe once I see the 1949 film I'll feel differently.That said, the film is still flawed and it does lack that special spark that would make it memorable.  It's a film that works well in the midst of the viewing, but it fades rather quickly from memory.The film follows humble Willie Stark as he rises to become governor of Louisiana.  Reporter Jack Burden witnesses Stark's impending fall, thanks to malicious slander, and Jack fights fervently to clear Stark's name.The one thing that this film has going for it is the cast.  It is a HUGE cast with big names and some smaller names that turn in impressive work.  The lead, Sean Penn, is one of the films weaker links (the man has a tendency to play too heavily on the gimmicky side of things) but he is elevated by the surrounding cast who underplay enough to make his over-the-top mannerisms seemed slightly more balanced.  I will admit to thinking he went too far in scenes, coming across mentally handicapped, but that is a personal opinion that I know not all will share.  I actually loved Jude Law here.  He really understood the importance of subtlety in delivering his lines in a way that captured the emotional intent of the character.  Anthony Hopkins and Kate Winslet and Patricia Clarkson and Kathy Baker and Jackie Earle Haley were all very well used here.  It is only James Gandolfini who suffers at the hands of his own accent (ugh, it just didn't work).In the end I must say I liked the film.  It doesn't completely pull itself together and the direction can seem a little one-note, but this glossy production of a gritty tale could have been much worse; that's for sure.",3,It fades fast but it's worth the ride...,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2075,"['feel', 'ashamed', 'say', 'have', 'still', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'take', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '1949', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'claim', 'be', 'classic', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'as', 'awful', 'reviews', 'were', 'take', 'was', 'surprised', 'actually', 'like', 'fair', 'amount', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'awfulness', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'claimed', 'be', 'there', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'judging', 'anything', 'point.Maybe', 'once', 'see', '1949', 'film', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'differently.That', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'flawed', 'lack', 'special', 'spark', 'would', 'make', 'memorable', 'film', 'well', 'midst', 'viewing', 'rather', 'quickly', 'memory.The', 'film', 'humble', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'become', 'governor', 'Louisiana', 'Reporter', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'Stark', 'impending', 'fall', 'thanks', 'malicious', 'slander', 'Jack', 'fights', 'fervently', 'clear', 'Stark', 'name.The', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'cast', 'HUGE', 'cast', 'big', 'names', 'smaller', 'names', 'turn', 'impressive', 'work', 'lead', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'films', 'weaker', 'links', 'man', 'tendency', 'play', 'too', 'heavily', 'gimmicky', 'side', 'things', 'elevated', 'surrounding', 'cast', 'who', 'underplay', 'enough', 'make', 'over-the-top', 'mannerisms', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'more', 'balanced', 'will', 'admit', 'thinking', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'scenes', 'coming', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'personal', 'opinion', 'know', 'not', 'will', 'share', 'actually', 'loved', 'Jude', 'Law', 'here', 'really', 'understood', 'importance', 'subtlety', 'delivering', 'lines', 'way', 'captured', 'emotional', 'intent', 'character', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'here', 'only', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'hands', 'own', 'accent', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'liked', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'pull', 'together', 'direction', 'can', 'seem', 'little', 'one-note', 'glossy', 'production', 'gritty', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'sure']",All the King's Men

The movies of Sean Penn that I had seen on TV never really impressed me.  I generally take a helping of salt with the accolades given by Grammy awards or critics, as I have watched so many movies with great ravings only to find them to be plain junk - but not this one!  This is one that got few ravings but deserved much more due to the performance of Sean Penn.  I rented this film on a whim, took it home on a week-end and I still did not watch it.  Returned it and again on a whim I paid the fee again to see it.  I have no regrets.This is a masterpiece, shouldered and driven almost exclusively on the shoulders of Sean Penn.  That guy made me rewind and rewind just to hear him deliver a line.  His mannerisms, his charisma, the way he ingrained himself into that Stark character had me hypnotized. The supporting roles were important to me, especially the role of Jack Burden played by Jude Law.  However, these roles were only serving to interest me into what impact these other players had on the Stark character.  I could not look away or think of anything else but what was going on in that movie.

1030241,A48THA5X4OUAB,B000K2UGXO,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[4, 5]","All the King's Men is not, like Joyce's Ulysees, unfilmable.  But almost.  Penn Warren's original is a philosophical novel, something most viewers today, even those with degrees, have not been taught was ever created in this country.  It is not only about political power, but about time and the matrixes in lives when things are briefly possible, and when they never are again.  It is also about the responsibility of the Citizen, embodied by Jack Burden, in a democratic republic.  Finally, it is an extrapolation of issues raised by the career of Huey Long -- but not a transparent telling of his story.  Its much freer than that.All of the above present difficulties enough for the film maker.  Add to all that what is really an eccentric time and place.  No, Louisiana is too unique a place, then or ever, to stand for America without serious reservations.  It is through a glass very darkly.  Then you have the an era of extreme underground unease that the Roosevelt presidency and WW2 finally subsumed, more or less.  In the face of all these problems, the glib dismissal and put down of this film -- not only on this website but in national journals -- is quite amazing until you realize how fundamentally little has changed in this country, on a certain primal level.  Best way to approach the movie is to put all of that out of mind, and be grateful to live in a nation that can produce this fine a commentary on itself.The main strategy was to simplify the story; it had to be.  The film's Willie Stark is less complex than Warren's, who was a lawyer and rose to power somewhat more cunningly, and actually closer to certain aspects of Huey Long.  The film uses the lingering popular impression of Long.  It also simplifies the machine of his downfall, here greatly related to booze.  Now one familiar with the problems sees a big early knockout in the works, not a snowball's chance in hell, but then an incredible thing occurs:  a great actor named Sean Penn steps into the role.  And after the first microsecond on film, entirely disappears into the role.  That, and the director's supreme care for cultural authenticity, quickly moves things along as the depression era county auditor Stark immediately sets out for the governership.  The thing is so damn authentic that you can hardly catch some of the dialogue -- which is, yes, irritating.  Perhaps Mel Gibson's recent experiments in ancient language movies have started something.  Something, finally, a little silly.  20th century American realism, after all, was wedded always to basic comprehensibility, whether in literature (ie. Hemingway), painting (ie. Hopper), or film (ie. Huston).Jack Burden's story has also been simplified, as is that of his friends from Burden's Landing.  I found myself arguing with all this until I saw the edited out scenes in the extras.  They were closer to the novel, but still were not enough for closure. I have to say that even if they would have added an hour to the movie (Penn Warren devotees wouldn't mind) a certain degree of battlefield surgery was still going to be called for at some point.  There was no way around it.  Unfortunately something critical falls through the hole of the 120 minute cut.  The main problem is that Jack's philosophical issue as a man and Citizen does not dovetail properly with Stark's. The major connecting thread in the plotline, of the wellborn physician Adam, is left cryptic, how time and ambition squeeze him out and turn him into a knee jerk killer.  This -- not Stark's power -- is the real horror of the story.  Penn Warren was deeply suspicious of the ""man of idea,"" and shallow assertions of political idealism.  He indeed laid the American civil war as a sacrifice to that particular altar.  But to do even a fraction of this properly it would likely need be long as the Russian version of War and Peace.  As we all know, our young nation still does not take its history or art as seriously as that; we would find a full and proper take on this great book intolerable.Yet enough remains to put this effort into the very small category of major films made from American literature.  There is much in it worth seeing again.  I cringe only giving it four stars, knowing Penn Warren and knowing all the difficulties tackled head on by this director and cast.  Yet this slavish bowing to the assumed national diminished attention span with 120 minute movies has to stop somewhere.  Why not just shoot a couple more scenes, put back the cuts, and re-release it?  Admit the mistake and bow to the greater cause?  It is all here but the major connections, and you just cannot do that with major literature.

I agree with a lot of the criticisms. Was it really necessary to have Kate Winslet shot like an angel or something? There is nothing bad about her performance though. The idea of representing Stark's political corruption through his personal life and not by signing any dirty deals was not the right thing to do. The movie doesn't let you go into how Stark got corrupt.

But, that was the character he was playing: A HUGE a and, at times, overwhelming candidate/governor.  Penn nailed the part dead on.  His speeches were, at first, a bit googfy.  But then you got into his character and really started to understand the he was a self-proclaimed ""hick"", and therefore spoke like a half-drunk guy from the sticks.  (And is that gauze stuffed in his mouth??)Jude Law played a great reluctant reporter that refused to be a part of anything, even though he was an important cog on the governor's machine.  Law managed to nail this part amazingly well, and often made me forget that it was Jude Law up there - now THAT'S convincing.  (Unlike Batman Begins where you sat there watching big-name actors never quite being convincing enough to hide their well-known personas.)Winslet was the one person that had me wincing.  Was it the blonde hair and dark eyebrows?  Was it the quirky acting?  Was it the way she just didn't seem to be on the same level as all of the others?  I think it was all three that just kept popping off the screen.  I found every scene she was in to be drasticly unbalanced and quirky.  My wife doesn't agree, and thinks that maybe that's how the character was meant to be: drastic, quirky and fake.Hopkins as the judge was, again, right on.  He played the retired judge that was putting pressure on the legislature to impeach the governor.  Most of the movie involves trying to find some dirt on the judge so that he might call of the impeachment proceedings.Of course, things don't go neatly and we start to learn that none of the characters are exactly what they seem.  Except one...I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  It is NOT one of those movies that have to be seen in the theater like the 'Rings' trilogy or StarWars, so you could wait for the DVD.Minus 1 star for the inconsistant accents used throughout the film.

1030248,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000K2UGXO,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This film had much promise since it has a superb cast and is based on one of America's finest novels. However, in the end, it is disappointing. It is disappointing because the script, dialogue, and narrative plot line fail to give a comprehensive credible armature on which the actors may show their craft. This is the story of Willie Stark, a common man seeking good, who becomes corrupt by power. The story is very loosely based on Governor Huey Long of Louisiana. But it is actually the story of Jack Burden, a newspaper writer, born in old Southern privilege, entranced by Willie Stark's character and populist powers, and willing to betray the class from which he came for the benefit of a man he gradually realizes is corrupt. It is the story of Jack Burden that is problematic for we never can figure out the real motives as to why he would betray his family and family friends for the benefit of a man who has become power hungry and abusive of his powers. But unfortunately, the story and motives of Jack Burden are not the only part of the film that never fully makes sense. We never understand why Willie Stark is being impeached by the legislature. We never understand Willie Stark's appeal to the daughter of a respected of a past governor. We never understand how a hospital scandal reflects on the physician son of this same respected past governor. The plot is fully of holes and unexplained actions. The actors who try to speak in a southern accent fail to pull this off, especially Sean Penn, whose accent is almost unintelligible. With a superb cast, Jude Law does his best with the character of Jack Burden. Anthony Hopkins does a credible job as Judge Irwin. However it is Patricia Clarkson who displays the high point in the acting trade in this film.

1030249,A1MJ682JQH816G,B000K2UGXO,Chad A. B. Wilson,"[1, 1]","Reading Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novelAll the King's Men  [2006 Movie Tie-In Edition] is like riding an academic roller coaster through early twentieth century politics. The narrator, Jack Burden, is a student of history, and his journey through life illustrates the character of Willie Stark, the Boss, the Governor of whichever southern state it actually takes place in. Burden's narration is lush, vivid, and sometimes bogs down in its own detailed prose as it describes the landscapes and peoplescapes, even delving into philosophical ramblings about the meaning of a specifically placed finger or a supposed wink.The book, frankly, borders on genius. It's a difficult read, sure, but it's a great story. It's the narration and description that makes it so good, though, not necessary the story itself. We come to know the characters only through that narration, but they are fully realized by the end.The 2006 movie doesn't have those strengths. It tries to make a standard story out of the difficult prose and narrative. Not that it makes the novel strictly linear, but it leaves out all of the interesting philosophical meanderings. Jude Law (Jack Burden) tries to insert some of the stuff about the Friend of your Youth (one of the philosophical inserts) into the movie, but it falls flat because we don't get enough of it to fully appreciate it. All of the characters are that way, too: they're all one-sided, even bordering on stock characters.We do see some brilliance in Sean Penn's Wille Stark, however, at least when he is giving speeches. When he comes out of his shell and attempts to connect with the world, his speeches are good. Watching this movie in 2009 is a strange experience, however, for we have seen the inauguration of Barack Obama, whose speeches sometimes mirrored those of Willie Stark, although his aren't nearly as mean-spirited. Stark represents the new kind of politician that cares for the people and wants to get rid of money-riddled politics. Instead, he wants to do good, even though he will still use corruption, for it is only through bad that good can ever come (at least according to Stark).We have some good themes here, but most of them are minor. The primary theme is about the purpose of political life and whether politics can remain above the fray. The movie hints that politics is about service, but it cannot be above anything. Instead, it is as debased as any other human endeavor. Therefore, the very nature of political service is debased.I'm not sure if the movie can be appreciated without having read the novel, for the plot gets a bit confusing, but the theme about politics and service is still evident. Watch it for that alone, but only if you generally vote Democrat. I guess a Republican can enjoy it, too, for it points out that even ""idealists"" are flawed and are really just as corrupt as any politicians.",3,Robert (Sean) Penn Warren's All the King's Men,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,2871,"['Reading', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'Warren', '1946', 'King', 'Men', '[', '2006', 'Movie', 'Tie-In', 'Edition', ']', 'riding', 'academic', 'roller', 'coaster', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'politics', 'narrator', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'student', 'history', 'journey', 'life', 'character', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Boss', 'Governor', 'southern', 'state', 'actually', 'place', 'Burden', 'narration', 'lush', 'vivid', 'sometimes', 'bogs', 'down', 'own', 'detailed', 'prose', 'landscapes', 'peoplescapes', 'even', 'delving', 'philosophical', 'ramblings', 'meaning', 'specifically', 'placed', 'finger', 'supposed', 'wink.The', 'book', 'frankly', 'borders', 'genius', 'difficult', 'read', 'sure', 'great', 'story', 'narration', 'description', 'so', 'good', 'though', 'not', 'necessary', 'story', 'come', 'know', 'characters', 'only', 'narration', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'end.The', '2006', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'strengths', 'make', 'standard', 'story', 'difficult', 'prose', 'narrative', 'Not', 'novel', 'strictly', 'linear', 'out', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'meanderings', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'insert', 'stuff', 'Friend', 'Youth', 'one', 'philosophical', 'inserts', 'movie', 'flat', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'too', ""'re"", 'one-sided', 'even', 'bordering', 'stock', 'characters.We', 'do', 'see', 'brilliance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Wille', 'Stark', 'however', 'least', 'when', 'giving', 'speeches', 'When', 'shell', 'attempts', 'connect', 'world', 'speeches', 'are', 'good', 'Watching', 'movie', '2009', 'strange', 'experience', 'however', 'have', 'seen', 'inauguration', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'speeches', 'sometimes', 'mirrored', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'mean-spirited', 'Stark', 'new', 'kind', 'politician', 'people', 'get', 'rid', 'money-riddled', 'politics', 'Instead', 'do', 'good', 'even', 'will', 'still', 'use', 'corruption', 'only', 'bad', 'good', 'can', 'ever', 'come', 'least', 'according', 'Stark', 'have', 'good', 'themes', 'here', 'most', 'are', 'minor', 'primary', 'theme', 'purpose', 'political', 'life', 'politics', 'can', 'remain', 'fray', 'movie', 'hints', 'politics', 'service', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'Instead', 'as', 'debased', 'other', 'human', 'endeavor', 'Therefore', 'very', 'nature', 'political', 'service', 'debased.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'having', 'read', 'novel', 'plot', 'bit', 'confusing', 'theme', 'politics', 'service', 'still', 'evident', 'Watch', 'alone', 'only', 'generally', 'vote', 'Democrat', 'guess', 'Republican', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too', 'out', 'even', 'idealists', 'are', 'flawed', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'corrupt', 'politicians']",All the King's Men

I read many scathing reviews and so I went out and purchased the novel by Robert Penn Warren to see what I thought of that American classic. I read it and really enjoyed it and keep coming back to it. Also, I like studying the historical figure of Huey Long so I knew I would have to see the film and judge for myself. I have to say that it was quite good, not great, but good. After having watched it a couple of times I really don't mind whether the accents were spot on or not. I would tell any potential viewer that it would be helpful to have read the novel that this is based on because that will fill in many blanks in the movie.The movie has good acting. I liked Jude Law's melancholy take on Jack Burden and Sean Penn was quite decent as Willie Stark. Anthony Hopkins was also good as the Judge. But the movie should have been longer or a miniseries. As some previous viewers have stated this story is hard to fit in 2 hours. I agree that 4 hours would have been better but movies that long are rarely made anymore so it would have to have been a miniseries ,maybe for HBO. Also a reader of the novel will also say, ""I can't believe they left that part of the story out!"". But on the whole the movie has a good Southern atmosphere though it should have been set in the 1930s instead of the 1950s, I believe. The DVD has a alternate ending that should have been left in the film because it brings better closure to the characters that you have followed throughout the film instead of the quick theatrical ending. And I have to say that there is a certain scene between Jude Law and Kate Winslet that really captures the spirit and melancholy feel of the novel. The narration might have been used even more since you get to hear some of Warren's fine prose and it helps you identify with Burden.I think it was a worthy attempt on Warren's legendary novel but just could have been fleshed out even more for the viewers enjoyment.The DVD has a good short documentary on Huey Long- the inspiration for the story, some deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage. I wish there could have been a director's commentary and/or a commentary by someone comparing the movie with the book. For someone interested in seeing more on Huey Long I would recommend Ken Burns excellent documentary on Long which is also available on DVD.The picture quality of the DVD is excellent as is the sound.I recommend checking this movie out and deciding your own opinion on the film.",3,Good adaptation of a classic American novel,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,2602,"['did', 'not', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'King', 'Men', 'theaters', 'watched', 'DVD', 'just', 'three', 'months', 'theatrical', 'release', 'read', 'many', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'so', 'went', 'out', 'purchased', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'Warren', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'American', 'classic', 'read', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'Also', 'like', 'studying', 'historical', 'figure', 'Huey', 'Long', 'so', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'judge', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'having', 'watched', 'couple', 'times', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'accents', 'were', 'spot', 'not', 'would', 'tell', 'potential', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'based', 'will', 'fill', 'many', 'blanks', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'liked', 'Jude', 'Law', 'melancholy', 'take', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'quite', 'decent', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'Judge', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'previous', 'viewers', 'have', 'stated', 'story', 'hard', 'fit', '2', 'hours', 'agree', '4', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movies', 'long', 'are', 'rarely', 'made', 'anymore', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'miniseries', 'maybe', 'HBO', 'Also', 'reader', 'novel', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'left', 'part', 'story', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', 'good', 'Southern', 'atmosphere', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'set', '1930s', 'instead', '1950s', 'believe', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'film', 'better', 'closure', 'characters', 'have', 'followed', 'film', 'instead', 'quick', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'have', 'say', 'certain', 'scene', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'really', 'spirit', 'melancholy', 'feel', 'novel', 'narration', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'even', 'more', 'get', 'hear', 'Warren', 'fine', 'prose', 'identify', 'Burden.I', 'think', 'was', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'Warren', 'legendary', 'novel', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'viewers', 'enjoyment.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'short', 'documentary', 'Huey', 'Long-', 'inspiration', 'story', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'footage', 'wish', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'director', 'commentary', 'and/or', 'commentary', 'someone', 'comparing', 'movie', 'book', 'someone', 'interested', 'seeing', 'more', 'Huey', 'Long', 'would', 'recommend', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Long', 'also', 'available', 'DVD.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'sound.I', 'recommend', 'checking', 'movie', 'deciding', 'own', 'opinion', 'film']",All the King's Men
1030252,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000K2UGXO,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","I could recommend ""All the King's Men"" if Sean Penn's performance was the only criteria. Sadly, it isn't, and that forces me to look at the film negatively; this is a well intended film that completely loses its way, falling victim to needlessly complicated details and virtually nonexistent character development. I never once felt that I had the chance to know these characters, which is bad because I could tell the actors put a lot of work into making them believable. It's really a shame this film falls flat. All the components are there, but they aren't used to the best of their ability.This remake of the 1949 Academy Award winning film (which itself was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren) is a fictional reinterpretation of Huey Long, the Democratic Louisiana governor assassinated in 1935. The film changes him into Willie Stark, originally played by Broderick Crawford and now played by Sean Penn. I don't dare analyze how faithful this 2006 film is to either the 1949 film or the original novel, nor do I dare attempt to compare the Stark portrayals to Long's real-life mannerisms. There's simply too much I'm not aware of. All I can do is focus on this film as a separate entity, one that is initially enhanced by Penn's brilliant performance. There's no question that the man can act. He certainly pulls no punches when it comes to Willie Stark, whose energetic, tell-it-like-it-is campaign got him elected as governor of Louisiana.The other actors give reasonable performances, as well. The exception is Jude Law as reporter Jack Burden; while his performance wasn't bad, he still seemed out of place in this story. It's as if he were hired out of convenience rather than for his ability to portray a plausible Southern gentleman. Law has and always will be a Hollywood Pretty Boy, meaning he'll be too attractive for any of his roles to seem authentic. Then again, his character was born into the Southern upper class, a social stature notorious for creating attractive facades (symbolically or physically). In that sense, one can argue that Law was the perfect choice to portray that character.The story in and of itself is fairly straightforward. Taking place during the first half of the 1950s, it involves Burden being personally hired by Stark to gather information on Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), Burden's beloved godfather. It would seem that Irwin is attempting to have Stark impeached; his ideas on helping the working class and the poor are threatening to the rich, especially since they involve a fair number of building projects. By digging into Irwin's past and finding fault with his character, Stark hopes he can turn the tables in his favor. This doesn't sit too well with Burden, who knows the old man will never budge once his mind is made up.This indirectly connects to another of Stark's political agendas. He hopes to build Louisiana's finest medical facility and staff it with the best doctors and nurses the state has to offer. Here enters Adam Stanton (Mark Ruffalo), Burden's friend since childhood. He's considered a doctor by Stark even though the audience has no way of knowing this to be true; not only is Stanton's personality incompatible with that of a classic doctor character, he's also never seen in a hospital, a clinic, or even in a dramatic medical situation. The best we're given is his history, both with his sister, Anne (Kate Winslet), and with Burden. The details are sketchy at best, but it would seem that the three of them spent quite a bit of time together as children, and they continued to remain close as they grew older.This aspect of the story was the most baffling because it had little if anything to do with Stark's political aspirations. At times, it felt like I was watching scenes from a completely different movie. One especially telling flashback sequence shows Burden and Anne alone in an upstairs bedroom. The sexual tension is overwhelming, for both them and the audience. It was a good scene, but it was also completely different in tone from the rest of the film. Burden's back-story didn't feel contrived so much as it seemed altogether out of touch with the plot. It was as if another story idea found its way into the screenplay of ""All the King's Men."" Maybe another movie needed to be made, one that would focus solely on the relationship between Jack Burden and Anne Stanton. It probably would have been just as interesting. It only needed the chance to fully develop.The same can be said for Adam, who felt as enigmatic as a complete stranger. His current situation hints at a severe depression; according to both Burden and Anne, he's becoming increasingly reclusive. An explanation for such an emotional decline would have been nice, considering it would dramatically add to the story. Alas, one is never given, and that ultimately serves to turn Ruffalo's character into an excuse for filler material. He has a couple of tense conversations with Burden as well as with Stark, who he fears is using him as a pawn in an ever-deepening sea of political corruption. When you factor in Stanton's importance during the final scene, you'll understand why it was wrong for his character to be so unknown.I really wanted to like ""All the King's Men,"" especially when another notable Sean Penn performance is at stake. Unfortunately, far too much is left in the dark, especially in terms of characterization. Besides Adam Stanton, there are a slew of other properly introduced characters that are ultimately discarded. These include Burden's mother (Kathy Baker), the corrupt Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), the perpetually skeptical Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson), and Sugar Boy (Jackie Earle Haley), Stark's chauffer and bodyguard. Even the more defined characters are too mysterious to allow the story to sink in. Strong performances are given for characters that aren't completely fleshed out, a flaw that made this film almost intolerable.How sad for Robert Penn Warren. If he were alive today, he'd probably be shocked at the notion of a Pulitzer Prize winner not being enough for a decent film adaptation. If I were in his place, I'd be shocked, too.",2,"Of the People, by the People, and for the People",1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,6171,"['could', 'recommend', 'King', 'Men', 'Sean', 'Penn',

1030253,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000K2UGXO,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 21]","This film dared me not to like it, and I'm afraid that I'm going to have to take them up on it. While its main reason for existence seems to be to shake its booty at Oscar, this grandiose drama couldn't even manage to impress me. Unfortunately for Steven Zaillian a great story and a great cast does not a great movie make. The film starts off strong as we watch Sean Penn's Willie Stark deliver amazing speech after amazing speech. But after that the story settles down somewhere in Jack Burden's (Jude Law) personal life. The tidiness of great political dramas such as ""Thirteen Days"" is nowhere to be found. Instead, we find a lard filled film that sputters and stalls so much that watching it almost becomes excruciating. Zaillian thought he was making the second coming of ""Citizen Kane,"" but he couldn't even live up to the standards of ""I Am Sam.""However, I far from hated this film and the main reason for that is Sean Penn. Always great, he delivers a performance here that at the very least is Oscar nomination worthy. Sure the character is over the top, but he is still an absolute joy to watch. Had this film had more of him and less of Jude Law (who I normally like) then maybe it could have been salvaged. Law plays a journalist turned aid to Stark, who asks him to dig up dirt on one of his biggest enemies. The problem, of course, is the deep personal bond Burden feels for Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins). We dig deep (way too deep) into his past, and into his inner conflict. His story arch also touches upon age old themes such as absolute power corrupts absolutely and a man who sets out to change the world only ends up being changed. John McCain, who spent his career as a maverick, has spent the last two years acting like a sell out because that is what the American people like to vote for. McCain, like Stark, might mean well, but if cozying up to the religious right and signing off on the despicable torture bill is his version of changing the world then he has clearly lost his grasp on reality. I bring this up because McCain is the type of politician that this film sets out to examine.""They want to ruin me, because they want to ruin you"" is the enduring lesson I will take away from this film. And it resonates with me even more because it's spoken by Sean Penn, somebody who is viewed as a threat by the powers that be. People who stand up for people are always ruined in one way or another (Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon), and there is a reason for that. Penn seems to have outsmarted them all because while he plays a politician in the film in real life he is an actor. And as an actor he can make a film like this that will reach far more people then a piece of legislation that would only be quashed by the Republicans in Congress. It's just too bad that this film wasn't any good. The other actors were poorly written, and a few actors (Gandolfini, Ruffalo) were given very little to do. It also felt downright Shakespearean to me. And as with all Shakespeare that means a huge body count, poetic language, heavy lifting, and delusions of grandeur. I just hope that come Oscar night we're talking about Sean Penn and not ""All The King's Men."" **3/4",3,Penn's Performance Can't Save This Snooze Fest,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,3195,"['film', 'dared', 'not', 'like', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'take', 'up', 'main', 'reason', 'existence', 'be', 'shake', 'booty', 'Oscar', 'grandiose', 'drama', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'manage', 'impress', 'Unfortunately', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'make', 'film', 'off', 'strong', 'watch', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'deliver', 'amazing', 'speech', 'amazing', 'speech', 'story', 'down', 'somewhere', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'Jude', 'Law', 'personal', 'life', 'tidiness', 'great', 'political', 'dramas', 'such', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Instead', 'find', 'lard', 'filled', 'film', 'sputters', 'stalls', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'almost', 'excruciating', 'Zaillian', 'thought', 'was', 'making', 'second', 'coming', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'Am', 'Sam', 'However', 'far', 'hated', 'film', 'main', 'reason', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Always', 'great', 'performance', 'here', 'very', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'worthy', 'Sure', 'character', 'top', 'still', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'Had', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'less', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'normally', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'salvaged', 'Law', 'journalist', 'turned', 'aid', 'Stark', 'who', 'dig', 'up', 'dirt', 'one', 'biggest', 'enemies', 'problem', 'course', 'deep', 'personal', 'bond', 'Burden', 'feels', 'Judge', 'Irwin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'dig', 'deep', 'way', 'too', 'deep', 'past', 'inner', 'conflict', 'story', 'arch', 'also', 'upon', 'age', 'old', 'themes', 'such', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'change', 'world', 'only', 'up', 'being', 'changed', 'John', 'McCain', 'who', 'spent', 'career', 'maverick', 'spent', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'acting', 'sell', 'out', 'what', 'American', 'people', 'vote', 'McCain', 'Stark', 'might', 'mean', 'well', 'cozying', 'up', 'religious', 'right', 'signing', 'off', 'despicable', 'torture', 'bill', 'version', 'changing', 'world', 'then', 'clearly', 'lost', 'grasp', 'reality', 'bring', 'up', 'McCain', 'type', 'politician', 'film', 'out', 'examine', 'want', 'ruin', 'want', 'ruin', 'enduring', 'lesson', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'spoken', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'somebody', 'who', 'viewed', 'threat', 'powers', 'be', 'People', 'who', 'stand', 'up', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'ruined', 'one', 'way', 'Gandhi', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'John', 'Lennon', 'reason', 'Penn', 'have', 'outsmarted', 'because', 'politician', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'actor', 'actor', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'will', 'reach', 'far', 'more', 'people', 'then', 'piece', 'legislation', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'quashed', 'Republicans', 'Congress', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'poorly', 'written', 'few', 'actors', 'Gandolfini', 'Ruffalo', 'were', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'also', 'felt', 'downright', 'Shakespearean', 'Shakespeare', 'huge', 'body', 'count', 'poetic', 'language', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'just', 'hope', 'come', 'Oscar', 'night', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'not', 'King', 'Men', '**3/4']",All the King's Men

1030255,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000K2UGXO,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 6]","I for one strongly disagree with the critics and most reviewers of this underrated film.  I finished watching this movie last night and thought to myself ""what gives"" for it was far from the train wreck most would have you believe it is.  I for one and utterly shocked at the lukewarm reception this movie has received and feel it deserves much more credit than it's receiving.Boasting an impressive cast, `All the Kings Men' for the most part capitalizes on that asset.  Sean Penn of course has taken most of the praise dished out and that's due to his charismatic scene stealing performance as Willie Stark, the humble man who rises from the ashes to become the governor of Louisiana.  While I feel Penn is a gifted actor I still find his performance a bit over the top at times.  My wife even pointed out the fact that he falls a bit into his `I Am Sam' performance at times and comes off a bit...mentally handicapped.The real star of the film in the correct sense of the term is Jude Law who not only narrates but also appears in the bulk of the scenes.  His portrayal of reporter Jack Burden is subtle and calm, and to me the most controlled of the bunch.  As a man who witnesses first hand the rise and impending fall of Stark we see Jack battle himself as he works fervently to clear Stark's name of slander.  This involves betraying Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), the man who practically raised him but who is a strong will leader in the fight against Stark.Along the way Jack is reunited with two acquaintances of his past, a former lover and former friend.  Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) was once the apple of Jack's eye, and in many ways still is, but she has quickly become smitten with Stark and his rise to power.  Her brother Adam, Jack's former best friend, is a supporter of those against Stark, but when Stark request Adam head his new hospital he has no choice by comply.  As the fight for power corrupts even those closest to Stark the inevitable does happen and we're left wondering how something so right could go so terribly wrong.The film is littered with strong acting on the parts of the majority of the cast.  Kate Winslet is brilliant as ever, hiding her accent perfectly and displaying more emotion in her few scenes (she's regrettably horrendously underused here) then most actors can in an entire film.  Patricia Clarkson is wonderful (such a brilliant actress) as is Kathy Baker and Jackie Earle Haley in their small but memorable roles, but my one complaint is James Gandolfini whom I normally love but failed to hide his `Sopranos' accent enough to come off anything more than comical.Steven Zaillian should also be singled out for his brilliant direction here.  The film was above all else beautiful to look at, the scenery and the surroundings were rich and enticing.  Sure it's got it's flaws, but they are minor compared to the plentiful good points of this film.  From the acting to the script to the masterful camera work, `All the Kings Men' is a film to see, one of the best underrated films to come out this year!",4,What's not to like?

1030268,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000K2UGXO,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Robert Penn Warren's 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning novel ALL THE KING'S MEN comes to the big screen courtesy of the author and writer/director Steven Zaillian and a dream cast that should make any script blaze across the screen. All of the ingredients of a brilliant film are here, yet areas of fuzzy focus and diluting the ever-present power of the main character so admirably brought to life by Sean Penn  miss the mark to a degree.  How this happened is unclear as all of the individiual aspects of the movie would be hard to improve.The story is so well known that repeating a plot outline is superfluous.  It is enough to remind the potential viewers that this is the 'quasi-biography' of Huey Long (here called Willie Stark), the hick from Louisana who gained the governorship of the state by empowering the poor and neglected citizenry led by a corrupt government with promises of reform and education, health and jobs for the disenfranchised.  It is his rise to power and eventual decline and assassination that provides the playing field for a varied cast of characters, men and women of varying degrees of honesty on both sides of the political arena.The story is narrated by reporter cum employee Jack Burden (Jude Law) who is first to show Willie Stark (Sean Penn) that he is a puppet for the corrupt wealthy gentry of Louisiana.  The histories of the powers that be include the judge (Anthony Hopkins), the children of the controlling Stantons (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo), the woman who would become mistress and informer (Patricia Clarkson) and the mother of Jack Burden (Kathy Baker) who holds the final secret that drives the downfall of Stark and 'all the king's men'.  And in the end it feels as though Jack Burden's role as written for the screenply seems the more important, a factor that diminishes the magnitude of the fall of Willie Stark.But this is a fine line of criticism.  All of the actors give superb performances: the only problem lies in the too authentic adapted Southern accents that tend to cover the dialogue to the point of disrupting the access to the story being told.  The mood produced by the lighting director, the cinematographer, and the musical scoring are incredibly fine.  And in the end this is a superb film despite its few shortcomings.  Advice: refresh the mind with reading the novel to enhance the understanding of all of the fine points of the story.

Maybe there's a way to update the 1947 Broderick Crawford political drama based on Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, but this ain't it. A meek attempt to examine totalitarianism when all social and charitable concern is forced under the wing of a governing body, is buried under mounds of verbal mumbo-jumbo that fills in the holes of skittish characters and situations, and sometimes the mumbo-jumbo remains just bewildering; Jude Law, as Penn's right hand man - ""When we first met, did you wink?"", and Penn's reply, ""I don't remember, maybe I just blinked."" And maybe the script just stinks.

Pace,"[1, 1]","All the King's Men is the second film adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name loosely based on Louisiana populist demagogue Huey Long.  It follows Jack Burden (played by Jude Law), a journalist turned political fixer, and Willie Stark (played by Sean Penn), a reformer turned corrupt political boss.Dispensing with the obfuscation of the novel, All the King's Men is openly set in Louisiana.  Inexplicably it's Louisiana sometime well after Huey Long's life, replete with the forward pass, but that doesn't make much difference.  It was a cruel time.  Men were forced to walk around outdoors in Louisiana wearing three-piece suits (thankfully, the Louisiana weather is a sovereign cure for all hangovers; that's why they drink so much).The dialogue captures the poeticism of the South.  We don't actually talk like that, but by God we do in our heads.  And Jude Law has a fake Southern accent that, unlike that of most of Hollywood, is melodious rather than nails-on-a-chalkboard.Sean Penn hams it up as usual, but Jude Law delivers a strong performance.  Anthony Hopkins and James Gandolfini nearly steal the show in small roles.  It is the shifting focus between Penn as Willie Stark and everyone else that determines whether any given scene is good or great.  The worst are the Stark speeches, political diatribes sort of haphazardly stuck in at odd places.  Better are the scenes when Stark joins several other characters, and best of all when he is off screen, if never out of the characters' minds.  Stark gets a bit more attention relative to Jack than in the book, but even with a 2 hour+ running time his story still gets cut criminally short.  His wife and son barely appear.  He sort of leaps from idealistic reformer to venal, disenchanted political boss in between scenes.  It's not enough to seriously detract from the film, thought.There are approximately an hour and a half of DVD extras, including The Making of ""All the King's Men,"" An American Classic, La. Confidential: On Location with ""All the King's Men,"" Shake Hands with the Devil, the Legend and Lore of Huey Long, and deleted scenes (including an alternate ending).

Answer:they are all decent actors who to a man could not effect a Southern accent to save their lives (or this film).ATKM is based on the much better, much older film of the same name that told a fictionalized account of a Louisiana politician based on Governor and later U.S Senator Huey Long. Long was an interesting figure, and while many still disagree on whether his poliices were salvation or destruction, his short career was undeniably very interesting. Long's corrruption is not disputed however, and ATKM follows Long (""Willie Stark"" here) as he rises to power, abuses power and ultimately falls.James Carville, who is a decent speaker, co-produced this mess. He would have been so better suited himself for the title role, because to listen to Sean Penn painfully abuse the Southern dialect, or Gandolfini who most of us still relate to as a Soprano lean forward and confide in an Amos and Andy patois, it's absolutely unwatchable. I don't know why it'd be so hard to recruit say Billy Bob Thornton, Tommy Lee Jones or any other player who could have been natural in this role instead of so obviously out of place as the cast of ATKM.The casting here is comparable to putting Jackie Chan in the Don Corleone role of ""The Godfather"".Huey Long was, absent his faults, a great orator and a very charismatic personality. Even with the help of a bombastic soundtrack, Sean Penn sounds like- well an actor. Like DeNiro and many other great performers, Penn cannot in deliver a speech effectively in public out of role and brings no inspiration here.

It is narrated by a reporter, turned trusted advisor, Jack Burton played very well by Jude Law. The cast even includes a smaller role by Anthony Hopkins as a judge & surrogate father to Jack Burton as a child.

After seeing ALL THE KING'S MEN, he has my non-aligned vote.Penn plays Willie Stark, an uncorrupted small-town mayor in 1950s Louisiana, who's picked by the political machine, represented by Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), to run as a wild card candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial race. But, when Willie realizes he's being manipulated, he veers off on his own to become the darling of the electorate's downtrodden and forgotten hicks. Covering the campaign for a major local news rag otherwise sympathetic to Stark's opposition is Jack Burden (Jude Law), whose editorial pieces become so admiring of Willie that he's fired. But, when Stark wins, Burden hires onto the new governor's team as a personal aide and PR hack.Once in office, Governor Stark antagonizes the state legislature, the oil companies, and the moneyed classes with his share-the-wealth promises to the sweaty masses - so outraged, in fact, that the legislators start serious impeachment talk, a move supported by the admired and retired Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), who also happens to be Jack's godfather. Eventually, Burden must choose between the loyalty to his immediate boss and his love for Irwin, who served as Jack's surrogate biological father.One marginally well-known movie critic and media personality pontificating from Chicago - while I hold forth more credibly only scant miles from Tinseltown itself - has charged Penn with overacting his part. Oh, how not so! Sean's Stark carries on in rare form the finest tradition of political demagoguery. What, you think that Hitler and Mussolini, perhaps two of the most effective populist rabble rousers in recent memory, just stood lifelessly at the speaker's podium and mumbled? (Perhaps, after listening to the likes of Dubya and Kerry in the last presidential election, Windy City has forgotten what constitutes crowd-gripping oratory.) Indeed, I expect a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Penn; he's mesmerizing.I haven't seen the original Big Screen release (1949) of ALL THE KING'S MEN, nor read the book on which both films were based. But this version isn't an unqualified success. While the supporting performances by Gandolfini and Hopkins are eminently watchable, and that of the former perhaps meriting a Best Supporting Actor nod, that by Law and his on-screen love interest, Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet), are notably unmemorable.  Burden, as the detached observer (and narrator) of the story, perhaps carries his uninvolvement too far; even the revelation at the end illuminating his relationship with Irwin leaves him gasping with apparent indifference. And Stanton desperately needed to be erased from the script; she's as unnecessary a plot character as you'll ever not need to see.

1030280,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000K2UGXO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Before it was released, ""All the King's Men"" was thought to be a front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. The scathing reviews it received from critics quickly put that dream to rest and probably caused the film to lose a big chunk of its potential audience. Sad, since it's actually a really good movie. I've never read the book by Robert Penn Warren or seen the previous film version of it, so maybe it's not as good as those...But this film has an energy all it's own. Sean Penn gives an Oscar-worthy performance (although some parts feel as if he got confused about whether he was in this movie or ""I Am Sam"") as Willie Stark, a Louisiana ""hick"" trying to do some good for his community. When he's tapped to run for governor of the state, he does and wins, promising to do good for the poor people. Immediately, the rich people don't like him...It only gets worse, once he slowly begins slipping into corruption. Jude Law plays Jack Burden, a reporter who is hired by Stark to do pretty much anything he needs. When Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins, who doesn't seem to care whether his accent is fading in and out) calls for an impeachment on Stark, Stark sends Jack to dig up dirt on the old judge...This brings Jack back in touch with his friend Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Adam's sister Anna (Kate Winslet, who also appears with Law in ""The Holiday""), a former love of Jack's. James Gandolfini and Patricia Clarkson co-star. The movie is written and directed by Steve Zaillian, who co-wrote ""Gangs of New York"" and several other films. He gives ""All the King's Men"" an old-timey look to it...Or, at least, one of those pseudo-old timey looks you see in a film like ""The Black Dahlia."" The movie works best when Sean Penn is onscreen. His performance is flamboyant, slightly over-the-top, and full of energy; He proves that he's still one of the best actors around and one of the most fascinating to watch. Jude Law also slips easily into the Louisiana accent and delivers a great performance. A good thing, since he has most of the screentime. Kate Winslet should get an award for the ""worst accent of the year."" For her, the accent really comes and goes. Listen closely enough, you can hear it stop and than come back a few words later. Gandolfini and Clarkson (who don't have enough screentime) got the accents down too, although you can still see a hint of Tony Soprano in James Gandolfini. ""All the King's Men"" is not a perfect film by any means, but it is an entertaining one. It doesn't have Oscars in it's future and will have limited shelf life, but the movie has a unique look and energy to it. There's some damn fine dialogue here and some great speeches and to tell you the truth...I think this film is better than a lot of the movies that made it into Top 10 Lists last year. I know I just said the accents fade in and out, but the performances that are good (And Hopkins and Winslet are good, don't get me wrong) are great! The script is pretty solid, the direction is good, the cinematography is great...There's a lot of reasons to see this movie and you might find yourself surprised by how much you like it.GRADE: B",4,All the King's Men,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,3131,"['was', 'released', 'King', 'Men', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'front-runner', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'received', 'critics', 'quickly', 'put', 'dream', 'rest', 'probably', 'caused', 'film', 'lose', 'big', 'chunk', 'potential', 'audience', 'Sad', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'Warren', 'seen', 'previous', 'film', 'version', 'so', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'energy', 'own', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'parts', 'feel', 'got', 'confused', 'was', 'movie', 'Am', 'Sam', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Louisiana', 'hick', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'community', 'When', 'tapped', 'run', 'governor', 'state', 'wins', 'promising', 'do', 'good', 'poor', 'people', 'Immediately', 'rich', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'only', 'worse', 'once', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'corruption', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'reporter', 'who', 'hired', 'Stark', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'When', 'Judge', 'Irwin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'accent', 'fading', 'impeachment', 'Stark', 'Stark', 'Jack', 'dig', 'up', 'dirt', 'old', 'judge', 'Jack', 'back', 'touch', 'friend', 'Adam', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Adam', 'sister', 'Anna', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'also', 'Law', 'Holiday', 'former', 'love', 'Jack', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'co-star', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Steve', 'Zaillian', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'King', 'Men', 'old-timey', 'look', 'least', 'one', 'pseudo-old', 'timey', 'looks', 'see', 'film', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'onscreen', 'performance', 'flamboyant', 'slightly', 'over-the-top', 'full', 'energy', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Jude', 'Law', 'also', 'easily', 'Louisiana', 'accent', 'great', 'performance', 'good', 'thing', 'most', 'screentime', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'should', 'get', 'award', 'worst', 'accent', 'year', 'accent', 'really', 'Listen', 'closely', 'enough', 'can', 'hear', 'stop', 'come', 'back', 'few', 'words', 'later', 'Gandolfini', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'screentime', 'got', 'accents', 'down', 'too', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'hint', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'King', 'Men', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'entertaining', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'Oscars', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'limited', 'life', 'movie', 'unique', 'look', 'energy', 'damn', 'fine', 'dialogue', 'here', 'great', 'speeches', 'tell', 'truth', 'think', 'film', 'better', 'lot', 'movies', 'made', 'Top', '10', 'Lists', 'last', 'year', 'know', 'just', 'said', 'accents', 'fade', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Hopkins', 'Winslet', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'script', 'pretty', 'solid', 'direction', 'good', 'cinematography', 'great', 'lot', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', 'might', 'find', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'it.GRADE', 'B']",All the King's Men

Several other instances occurred where the author's exact wording would have worked better.Also, two interesting book story points were omitted:  Stark's boy, the football player, toward the end was injured during a play and paralyzed from the neck down; Lucy resigned the rest of her life to caring for him.

1030284,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000K2UGXO,Kaya Savas,"[24, 34]","MOVIE: I don't know what is up the poopers of all the movie critics nowadays, it's like if it isn't a masterpiece of cinema then it's pure garbage. So many great films this year got horribly trashed by critics including this one. While the film has its flaws, it's in no way as bad as most people say it is. The film is based off of Robert Penn Warren's novel, which makes this the second film (4th overall adaptation including TV movies). The original theatrical adaptation snagged up Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in 1949, so you can expect some opposition in remaking a film that is already considered to be a classic. Steve Zaillian wrote and directed this version of the novel, and to his credit he did an amazing job. The film is incredibly focused and structured very well. He's only directed 3 movies including this one, but he has written some well known and critically acclaimed films including Schindler's List, Gangs Of New York, Hannibal, and The Interpreter. The dialogue in this film is incredibly natural and full of meaning, it flows very well. The characters are all perfect established, but where the film falls short is probably within its subplots as well as overall impact. Willie Starks' speeches are delivered with superb intensity by Sean Penn in some of the finest acting he's ever done. The central storyline of Starks and his rise to power is muddled a bit by many subplots with Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffulo, and Anthony Hopkins. It's hard to start all these storylines and then try and conclude them all in a satisfying manner at the end, and in that area is where the film fails to connect. James Horner's score also seems to be misplaced in certain scenes and it creates an awkward tone. However, to call this film bad is a crime. There is so much beautiful symbolic imagery and great cinematography in the film that it enhances its depth. I did feel like I was getting preached at, as if the filmmakers were trying to make a strong statement about modern day politics, and that draws you out of the whole experience a bit. Overall though this was a decent movie with an amazing cast and some incredible acting. Don't let the bad reviews prevent you from seeing it.ACTING: The cast of this movie is a dream team. To have a cast of this magnitude is astonishing, and they all just sink their teeth into material. Penn delivers such a strong presence as Willie Stark that you will get chills just from watching him make his speeches. Jude Law gives his character great depth and dimension to help connect his past with the present, but unfortunately the two storylines fail to connect. Anthony Hopkins, Patricia Clarkson, Mark Ruffulo, and Kate Winslet were all great as well. The only person I had a problem with was James Gandolfini. The man just cannot pull off a southern accent, and it threw his scenes off so badly. Otherwise it was a great experience to watch all these great actors interact and play off the intensity of one another.BOTTOM LINE: The Da Vinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Hollywoodland, and a few other movies had a large amount of critical opposition this year but I loved them anyway. This film has a lot to offer, it's not just some empty-headed drama about politics. Steve Zaillian offers a rich and detailed screenplay with some superb dialogue that flows well.

His impulse to join Stark, if it's about boredom, fits, but this isn't clear.  His descent from being aloof, to his questionable ethics is totally unexplained (or is it meant to be existential?). His romance and the fate of this, which mostly happens off screen, also seems to be random.Gandolfini looks good in the part, but the part is not well used.

1030288,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B000K2UGXO,M. Dog,"[14, 18]","This film had something very special going for it with its central casting of Sean Penn as Huey Long, the Kingfisher, the everyman governor of depression-era Louisiana (Willie Stark in the film). If ever there was a role designed for Penn's heated and emotive style of acting, this was it. True to that promise, Penn delivers a few (too few) wonderful scenes with Willie Stark delivering fire and brimstone from the campaign stump.Other than these scenes, the film is an unformed washout. Willie Stark's transformation from righteous, wife loving common man to manipulative, self-serving adulterous political schemer is . . . .  well there really is no transformation. It simply happens between scenes off camera, rendering a potentially fascinating character, rich with comment about the fallibility of human nature, into a black and white, boring nothing.The film sort of meanders around with the character of reporter Jack Burden (played by the desperately miscast Jude Law)and his exceptionally average family story, which somehow includes lover Anne Stanton (played by the desperately miscast Kate Winslet) and her brother Adam Stanton, played by Mark Ruffalo (who was at least well cast but left hanging in limbo by some very lazy scriptwriting). On board also is the very talanted James Gandolfini, who must have owed someone a very big favor. I challenge anyone to explain to me what he was doing in this bumbling, mumbling role, so far beneath his station. All in all, I was left wondering how any of the principals managed to convince themselves the product was release-ready when watching the final edit.Final note to Hollywood: let's strike a deal with England: From this day forth, no cross-accenting. Americans shall not play Brits; Brits shall not play Americans (particularly southerners). I think this simple piece of legislation would do wonders in maintaining good relations with that isle across the pond. Lord have mercy it was painful watching Mr. Law and Ms. Winslet giving it their best.

1030289,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B000K2UGXO,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 1]","ALL THE KING'S MEN (1949) is certainly one of the best movies about American politics ever produced.  Adapted by director Robert Rossen from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which was inspired by the career of Louisiana's demagogue  governor, Huey Long, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Broderick Crawford) and Supporting Actress (Mercedes McCambridge).When I first heard that Columbia Pictures was going to remake this classic film, I thought they were nuts.  After all, no matter how good the new version might be, it would always be competing with the memory of the original which is shown regularly on TV and is also available on DVD.Despite a stellar all-star cast and a handsome production, the 2006 remake of ALL THE KING'S MEN was met with a mixed, often negative, critical reaction and flopped at the box-office.Nevertheless, I wanted to judge this film for myself.The good news is that writer-director Steven Zaillian's film is not the total disaster that some critics have labeled it.  It has many strong points and is definitely worth a look.The bad news is that it is not as good as the original 1949 version.The 1949 film was neither time, nor place, specific, but this new version does an excellent job in recreating Depression-era Louisiana.  It is also closer to Warren's original book than was Rossen's screenplay.Among the more memorable performances are Jude Law, as Jack Burden, the role originated by John Ireland in 1949, Patricia Clarkson as Sadie Burke (the Mercedes McCambridge role) and Jackie Earle Haley as Sugar Boy, Governor Willie Stark's bodyguard.Aside from a sometimes sluggish pace, the movie's main failing is the miss-casting of Sean Penn in the central role of Willie Stark.Penn is one of our finest actors and he does his best in this assignment, but he, unfortunately, lacks the charisma that Crawford brought to the role in the original.Penn's Willie is just not likable, and I don't see how he could convince his constituents to vote for him.Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker and Mark Ruffalo are also in the cast.

Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[3, 3]","The movie didn't have budget enough to do justice to Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men.The writer-director is new at the game and it shows.Sean Penn either weighs 240 pounds in the movie or is padded to appear as though he weighs that much. Penn gives a scenery-chewing performance that is so overwrought it unbalances the film. His hairdo puts me in mind of the one Eric Blair AKA George Orwell wore in his heyday.Trouble is, the hairdo features white sidewalls around the edge. So when Penn as Willie Stark puts on a fedora, as he often does in the film, he is not recognizable as the same Willie Stark sans hat. Its a major gaffe. A more seasoned Director would have found a way around this.Penn indulges himself in wild gestures even when talking to the person right next to him.Stark blows his stack throughout the film. The other performances are more low key, so the Willie speeches jar the audience and undo the quieter moments in the film.The accents. Sean Penn's Willie is impossible to understand for the first third of the film. Jude Law's Jack Burden the reporter, is only a shade off his usual British accent. Not really American. Willie is romancing his woman aide Virginia Clarkson, in addition to his wife, a skater-stripper, and the Judge's daughter. The judge's daughter is played by Kate Winslet. She's an Aussie. The Judge is played by Anthony Hopkins. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) has a thankless role as a political handler. Both Winslet and Hopkins are totally understandable but not particularly Louisiana accented. Patricia Clarkson is FROM New Orleans, but doesn't particularly have an accent.The screenplay is a mess. There is no time for Willie to actually have the romances with the women. They are only alluded to. What is really missing though is a sense of the crowd, the base of any political film. Willie is never down among them, always above them talking over their heads. You have to hear something representative from the crowd to know what they're thinking. Apart from some sour looks, the film never gives a sense of who the voters are. The film needs to be opened up in the way stage-locked plays often are when converted to movies.Instead of being a movie about a gargoyle in Louisiana politics, this film instead becomes a story about an insular group of political people infighting and romancing one another.

There was a 1949 movie version but I think this one was better even though it did poorly at the Box Office. The tale is about a reporter, Jude Law, with aristocratic ties who takes an interest in a lowly politician named Stark, played by Sean Penn, who gradually rises to power as governor through his ""hick to hick"" speeches. At first it seems like they have a good governor until they discover the Stark character is just dirty in other ways. To make matters worse Stark demands that the reporter dig up dirt on his judge stepfather and basically messes up other parts of his life. The scandal and dirt is a bit dated for our times but it's still done well. Most of this film was shot in the state of Lousiana and the Stark character is based on Lousiana governor Huey Long. The first ""hick"" speech was the best of the bunch. Look for James Gandolfini falling in the mud. Other notables in this were Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet and Kathy Baker. There's a basic message of our morality and the bald cypress trees and decaying mansions were not put in randomly. They're speaking of a decay of morality. All said though we've heard this message in many different forms before and what's being done about it? Not enough from what I can tell. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; POLITICAL MESSAGE FOR THE TIMES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B; BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Jack Burden: The friend of your youth is the only friend you'll ever have. For he doesn't really see you. He sees in his mind a face which doesn't exist anymore, speaks a name... Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty... Jack... that belongs to that now nonexistent face. He's still the young idealist you used to be, still sees good and bad in black and white and men as sinners or saints but never both and feels superior in the knowledge that you no longer can distinguish the two. That's what drives you to it. To try to stick the knife in. There is a kind of snobbery in failure like the twist to the mouth of a drunk.  /// Sadie Burke: The world is full of sl**s on skates.  /// Willie Stark: They fooled you 1,000 times, just like they fooled me. But this time, I'll fool somebody. I'll stay in this race. I'm on my own and out for blood. Listen to me, you hicks! Lift up your eyes and look at God's blessed and unfly-blown truth. This is the truth! You're a hick. Nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself. Listen to me, listen to me! They were going to use me to split the vote. But I'm standing here now on my hind legs.

1030295,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B000K2UGXO,Publius,"[2, 4]","This remake of ""All The King's Men"" is really a very simple story.  I must state that I have seen neither the 1949 version, nor read Warren's original book.  Nevertheless, the movie concentrates on Jack Burden, (Law) a young journalist who covers Willie Stark's (Penn) campaign, and then goes to work for Stark after his election.  As Stark's power multiplies, powerful men in the Louisiana legislature try to impeach Stark.  One of the leaders behind this attempt to dump Stark is Judge Irwin (Hopkins).  Knowing that Irwin is pulling the strings, Stark petitions Burden to do a background check on Irwin.  The results of this fact finding mission rip apart the judge's family, all the while taking a toll on Burden who has a confusing prior relationship with the judge's family.  Eventually, all hell breaks loose as Burden uncovers shady dealings in Irwins past, and the result spells doom to the progenitor of the smear campaign.That is the spine of the movie, and unfortunately, the Director Zaillain does not delve deeper then that.  Instead of having scenes with the legislators and the Standard Oil men plotting Stark's doom, we instead have a much replayed swimming scene near the Judge's residence.  Instead of Stark taking his message to the people and shaking hands with his fellow hicks, we are treated instead to overwrought scenes of the eccentric Judge Irwin and his family.  Those examples, I would contend, are the ultimate failings of the movie.  However, one would have to assume that if the movie stayed close to the book, then the book would have these same failings as well.  To say I was disappointed by the end result of this movie would be an overstatement, but the movie unfortunately verged towards the more soap opera-like plotlines of Warren's original vision.

He is intentionally over-the-top and plays it so perfect that I forget it's Sean Penn. The character is nothing like anything Penn has done before which means he is intentionally playing him that way. And the man the character was based on is renowned for being the most flamboyant politician ever to make it that far in politics - to this day!I admit I had to watch the film twice to fully appreciate it, and upon my second viewing gained a better opinion of it. And I imagine when I watch it a third time (after a few months on other things) I may move my vote up to 5 stars.The only thing holding back 5 stars right now is that I wasn't entirely satisfied with Jude Law's accent being ""born and raised"" in Louisiana. Yes, we all know he is English, but if he couldn't do the accent proper all the time (he does at times but not consistently) then why give him the role? To his credit, I can't imagine the role played by anybody else. I just wish he had a better coach or more time to master the accent.Kate Winslet was beautiful and played her small role extremely well. I am almost surprised she would even take on such a small role. That's one actress without an ego problem.Perhaps the best was (unsurprisingly) Anthony Hopkins, who always delivers. He played the big judge in an endearing and believable way. I won't spoil it by saying what happens to his character, suffice to say that I felt for him very much.The score was not over played as so often is the case these days. The emotions were all natural and authentic from the story.I think the director could have made some better editing choices, and perhaps polished the screenplay a bit but overall a fine film with excellent performances all around.Certainly one of the most underrated - it deserves at least 4 stars compared to some of the crap around here with 5!Give it a chance if you like thinking movies with meaning.Oh, the special features are great too and they alone could push my rating to 5 stars.

To quote the film itself:  ""You only get a couple of moments that determine your life. Sometimes only one. And then it's gone. Forever.""  Probably the worst decision the directors made was changing the timeframe the film is set in.  If you ignore that the film's set twenty years past Long's time, it works a lot better.

Zwick,"[3, 3]","Even a stellar cast made up of some of the finest talents in the business - Sean Penn, Jude Law, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Kate Winslet and Anthony Hopkins - can't save ""All the King's Men"" from being a tired, pointless remake of the Best Picture Oscar winner of 1949.Robert Penn Warren based his original novel on the life and career of the notorious Huey Long, aka ""The Kingfish,"" who served as governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932.  Like Long, Warren's main character, Willy Stark, is a charismatic leader who offends the powers-that-be with his populist rantings, yet eventually becomes as lowdown, vile and corrupt as the politicians he initially railed against to get himself elected.This theme of the corrupting influence of power - and the corrosive effect that corruption has on the American political system - may have seemed fresh and insightful in Warren's day, but it is strictly old hat today.  Moreover, in Steven Zaillian`s pretentious rehash, Stark transitions from being an idealist to a cynic in such record-setting time that the audience is completely at a loss as to how to read the character.  Is he a man genuinely committed to helping his fellow citizens who eventually loses his way, or is he just another snake-oil salesman from the get-go exploiting the gullibility of the masses to get what he wants?  The film doesn't seem to know, and the audience, quite frankly, doesn`t really care.Stunningly, the movie is helped not one whit by its strictly A-list caliber cast.  Penn hams it up shamelessly as the over-the-top Stark, spewing spittle and bile, regardless of whether he is whipping a downtrodden audience into an emotional frenzy or plotting the downfall of his manifold political rivals.  Law, on the other hand, underplays to the point of catatonia the part of the governor's idealistic assistant (and narrator of the tale) who sells his soul to the devil by doing Stark's dirty work for him, even going so far as to blackmail the very man who raised him, in order to prevent the governor from being impeached by the state senate.  Clarkson, Gandolfini, Ruffalo and Winslet do little but stand around in the wings waiting for something dramatic to happen (as do we all), and Hopkins is simply too lazy to go through the trouble of even attempting a Louisiana accent let alone perfecting one.  The movie definitely could have used some serious paring down from the original storyline, since it is stuffed to bursting with characters who come and go seemingly at random, and whom we really couldn`t care less about.  To add insult to injury, James Horner's original music, with its overemphatic underlining and theater-rattling crescendos, should be studied in film schools as a model of how NOT to score a motion picture.This movie doesn't hold a candle to such superior political dramas as ""The Best Man,"" ""The Candidate,"" ""The Distinguished Gentleman"" and, yes, even the original ""All the King's Men,"" which boasted the incomparable Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in the lead roles.

1030304,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000K2UGXO,Samuel McKewon,"[6, 8]","""All The King's Men"" is a total mess and a spectacular misfire, a movie so poorly crafted by writer-director Steven Zaillian - who's directed some decent films - that it's not even fun to skewer. The acting is so arch and absurd, the story is so rootless and confusing and endless, droning, awful music is so melodramatic, that  it mostly earns, mostly, our pity.Based on Robert Penn Warren's novel - itself based on the life of Louisiana politician Huey P Long - the movie uses narrator journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) to follow a backwoods orator named Willie Stark (Sean Penn) from county official to powerful governor. Stark is a populist, relying on his ""hick"" voters to give him carte blanche to redistribute government funds to public works projects - roads, schools, hospitals.As ""All The King's Men"" opens, Stark is about to be impeached by the state legislature. For what? It's never made clear. Zaillian treats Stark like Jay Gatsby - nobody's quite sure of the truth. Instead of details, we get allusions and random subplots involving Jack's childhood friends (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo) and surrogate father (Anthony Hopkins). All three play a role in Stark's fate, but their characters are ciphers. None of the performances are memorable.As Stark, Penn has two speeds. He's either a screamin bleeder, his voice breaking and his face ready to pop, or he's sleepily drawlin like he just ate a pan of cornbread. Stark speaks almost entirely in homilies, even in private moments. Penn's talent, which is turning the emotions of a role inside out, doesn't fit the role. He's bought too far into the myth of the guy.",1,Cheese.

Sean Penn is good but succumbs to over-acting at times, gyrating furiously when it isn't necessarily called for in a scene.

The novel is so extraordinary that you'd have to really screw it up to make a bad movie, and director/writer Steven Zallian shows enough love and respect for Warren's masterpiece to prevent a disaster.

1030310,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000K2UGXO,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Louisiana, the mid-50s. Willie Stark (Sean Penn) helps to bring attention to a potential problem in his impoverished home parish in Louisiana. The state's political machine, led by Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) and Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson), recognizes this man could become a viable candidate for Governor of the great state of Louisiana and approaches him. Faster than you can shout ""Voulez vous les bonnes temps roulez"", Stark is Governor and he has asked Jack Burden (Jude Law), a local reporter to come to work for him. As they say ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"" and Stark is soon suspected of stealing from the government. An influential retired judge (Anthony Hopkins), who also happens to be Jack's godfather, throws his influence behind the impeachment proceedings, leading Stark to encourage Jack to dig up some dirt. Governor Stark realizes he needs to do something positive for his image, so he decides to build a new medical center. He wants Adam Stanton (Mark Ruffalo), a doctor and the son of a former beloved Governor to run it. As Adam and Jack were friends, Stark asks Jack to enlist his former friend's help. But Jack must deal with his feelings for Adam's sister, Anne (Kate Winslet) as he attempts to keep the political machine rolling.""All The King's Men"", written and directed by Steve Zaillian and based on the book by Robert Penn Warren, was previously made into a film starring Broderick Crawford as Stark. I have never seen the original, so I am unable to make a comparison. The new version is good, but given the caliber of the actors involved, the writing and the subject matter, you would expect it to be great.The film has a basic message: Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.Power in Hollywood is sometimes represented by who you can get to act in your films. Director Steve Zaillian must have some power because he has assembled a top notch cast. From Sean Penn on down, the cast features a host of actors who have created memorable performances in almost everything they have ever done. As Stark, Penn does a great job of bringing the man's eccentricities and vulnerabilities to light. Full of bravado, Stark soon learns he has a lot of power and doesn't hesitate to use it. Starting out as a local small town whistleblower, he doesn't change all that much when he becomes Governor. He is still loud and full of himself. But as Governor, he realizes people are willing to look past certain things. For instance, his wife (Talia Shire) rarely accompanies him and he takes every opportunity to have affairs, starting with Sadie (Clarkson) who is upset when she learns Stark slept with an exotic dancer. As Stark realizes his power, he becomes more confident in his ability to sweet talk people into doing things against their will. Jude Law is quite good as Stark's right hand man, his Man Friday. Throughout, Stark asks him to do crooked things, yet he soon agrees to most. Law also provides the narration for the film, giving some color and flavor to the proceedings. Kate Winslet is good as Anne, Jack's first and probably only love. There is a development with her character late in the film which seems a little tacked on, but otherwise, she is fine. Gandolfini seems to have fun as a Louisiana politico and Patricia Clarkson is also good as the eye of Stark's affection who becomes upset when he cheats on her. Mark Ruffalo plays the pivotal role of Adam, the doctor and son of a former governor, who plays a part in Stark's plan to reestablish respectability. The one problem in the cast is Anthony Hopkins who...Corrupts his character by not even attempting a Southern accent. Hopkins is often regarded as one of the best actors working in film today. Yet, in ""All The King's Men"", he is the one actor who doesn't even attempt a Southern accent, retaining his distinct British accent. This wouldn't matter much, but his character is rather bland. It almost seems like Hopkins is going for a characterization the complete opposite of everyone else. He is quiet, calm and reserved when everyone else is over the top. As the story takes place in the mid-50s, in Louisiana, it seems more fitting to have loud bombastic characters. At least characters who seem to have a little life left in them. Every state has some history of corruption in the government, and Louisiana is certainly no exception. It just seems like a quite reserved character is a little out of place in this environment.Absolutely the best thing about the film is the look. Every scene is filled with saturated colors which perfectly evoke both the feeling of the time and place and also pay homage to the films of this period. Director Zaillian has a real eye for detail and style. He is also a gifted writer, and he creates memorable characters, but the details of the story get a little lost. Also as a director, he has a little difficulty with the actors. They are all good, but given the caliber of this cast, they should be great.""All The King's Men"" is a good film, and a good way to start of the fall movie season. Hopefully, this is a good sign of what is to come. Hopefully, if the quality continues to rise, we will have one of the best movie seasons in a long time.",4,"Good, But Could've Been Better",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,5230,"['Absolute', 'power',

The Script was terrible, there was really no story whatsoever and it just didnt make sense! Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE! Sean's Southern accent was SO BAD that I had to actually turn on the English Subtitles to understand him. This Movie just didnt make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)! The Only Good Performances were by James Gandolfini who was very Convincing(made me totally forget Tony Soprano) and patricia clarkson ws Good!

Southern accents aren't usually too difficult to understand if you are from elsewhere however the actors are either from England or Brooklyn and I'll bet even Southerners can't understand them.
