I've seen a lot of his movies but I can honestly say that this is one of his better movies, and hands-down his best performance so far! Paul is sweet and gullible as Ned, an organic farmer who ""accidentally"" sells an illegal substance to a cop. After he is released from jail, his girlfriend (the brilliant Kathryn Hahn) is dating another guy and she decides to keep his beloved dog, Willie Nelson. I won't give away the rest but I really thought this movie was charming and refreshing. Elizabeth Banks, Emily Mortimer, and Zooey Deschanel play Ned's not so naive sisters.

1428852,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004UXUWEC,A kids review,"[2, 6]","There aren't many actors out there more inherently likable than Paul Rudd, it seems; he might come across a little smug from time to time, but just try to resist that adorable, guileless smile of his. Our Idiot Brother makes the most of this likability by casting Rudd in a role that requires him to be perpetually happy, unflinchingly credulous, and, therefore, more than a little nave. Ned is a simple farmer who believes strongly in the honest goodness of others; when an unlucky run-in with a cop gets him booted off the farm, he takes turns living with his three sisters, who all think he is, well, an idiot. Over time, the sisters, whose routine lives are stressful in their own right, begin to see that Ned's outlook on life isn't so idiotic after all. I enjoyed Our Idiot Brother well enough, Rudd's innocent charm in the title role is a big plus, even in the midst of the film's uneven tone, and see fit to give a 2 stars. It might be a little too cute and coy for some, but it also just might make you go, ""Awww, well isn?t that nice?""",2,Our Idiot Brother,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1045,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'actors', 'there', 'more', 'inherently', 'likable', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'might', 'come', 'little', 'smug', 'time', 'time', 'just', 'try', 'resist', 'adorable', 'guileless', 'smile', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'most', 'likability', 'casting', 'Rudd', 'role', 'be', 'perpetually', 'happy', 'unflinchingly', 'credulous', 'therefore', 'more', 'little', 'nave', 'Ned', 'simple', 'farmer', 'who', 'strongly', 'honest', 'goodness', 'others', 'when', 'unlucky', 'run-in', 'cop', 'booted', 'off', 'farm', 'living', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'think', 'well', 'idiot', 'time', 'sisters', 'routine', 'lives', 'are', 'stressful', 'own', 'right', 'begin', 'see', 'Ned', 'outlook', 'life', ""n't"", 'so', 'idiotic', 'enjoyed', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'well', 'enough', 'Rudd', 'innocent', 'charm', 'title', 'role', 'big', 'plus', 'even', 'midst', 'film', 'uneven', 'tone', 'see', 'fit', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'coy', 'also', 'just', 'might', 'make', 'go', 'Awww', 'well', 'isn', 't', 'nice']",Our Idiot Brother

Maybe the screenwriters named him Ned because he's like Ned Flanders on ""The Simpsons"" only without the religion.  He's so nice when a cop comes up to his fruit & vegetable stand asking for some pot because he's having a bad day, Ned agrees to give him a bag.  He reluctantly takes $20 for it and then finds himself sent up the river on a drug pedaling charge.Ned (Paul Rudd) gets out 8 months later and is no longer welcome at the farm where he used to work.  At first then he stays with his mom.  When he feels smothered, he goes to stay with his sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) and her husband (Steve Coogan) and their young son River.  Liz and her husband are the type of parents who don't want their kid to eat sugar and make him play some weird musical instrument so he can get into a fancy school.  Ned upsets that by teaching River about karate and stuff.Soon he ends up with his other sister Miranda (Elizabeth Banks)--I have no idea which sister is the oldest or youngest.  She works for Vanity Fair and is trying to break a big story about Lady Arabella, who was involved in some scandal.  Ned's honesty screws that up too.He ends up sleeping in a raft at the apartment of his other sister Natalie (Zooey Deschanel).  She's supposedly a lesbian, but has been sleeping around with a guy.  Ned's honesty ruins things for her too.It's all a little too obvious that the real ""idiots"" are the sisters, not Ned.  As screwed up as his life is, theirs aren't much better, just they refuse to admit it.  You might be able to figure out where everything is going.But overall this was a fun, lighthearted film.  Ned's good-natured blundering is funny and makes him a likable character.  He's not exactly in the same mold as Forrest Gump (because he's not that dumb) but he is someone you root for despite the dumb things he does.This is a good movie for adult couples who want something light and fun.  There's really too much sex talk (and an unfortunate shot of Steve Coogan's naughty parts) for this to be a family film.The extras on the DVD I received are three deleted/extended scenes (one is real short) and an alternate ending.  Unlike some movies that claim to have an alternate ending but end up having one or two lines changed, this one really is a largely different ending.

My biggest problem with ""Our Idiot Brother"" is that it just wasn't that funny. The funniest parts of the movie were almost all present in the trailers. Combine that with a cliched formulaic script where someone comes in and messes with peoples lives, only to find out in the end that it was all for the best, and you end up with a weak boring movie. Paul Rudd is the generic hippie organic farmer, and while I enjoyed his performance, the role just didn't have enough life or believability.

1428868,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B004UXUWEC,Brett Corkins,"[3, 3]","Our Idiot Brother is, at its heart, the story of what one guy will do to get his dog back.I'm gonna get this out of the way from the get go, I loved this movie. It's full of true to life situations that happen everyday lead with standout performances by some of Hollywood's best up-and-comers...and Paul Rudd. The way they approached the situations, the way you could see these characters flaws and cracks, and the way they presented a normal family life were all so well done that, at times, I found myself wondering what I would do in that situation.Make no mistake, Our Idiot Brother is not the laugh riot it has been made out to be. Yes, it has some very funny parts and I did chuckle throughout, but it wasn't laugh out loud funny. I'm okay with this though. I like movies that portray real life objectively.In my eyes, Ned isn't even an idiot per se. I think he just cares too much and trusts too easily. Idiot qualities? Sure. I found myself sympathizing with him more times than not. Therein lies the reason I probably enjoyed the movie so much...I have those same qualities. I found myself getting mad at his family for treating him so badly and being so quick to pawn him off on someone else or talk down to him for no reason. But that works. They don't understand why he is the way he is. Like I said earlier though, once they start to understand you see that guilt, those cracks, and you genuinely feel like they want to right the situation.For everything we were promised through trailers and TV spots, Our Idiot Brother delivers something better, something with more substance and believability.

1428872,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B004UXUWEC,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[5, 5]","I have to admit that, before watching ""Our Idiot Brother,"" I was thinking that it would be a movie with the type of humor of ""The Hangover,"" ""The 40 year old Virgin,"" ""Bridesmaids,"" ""SuperBad"", ""Knocked Up,"" or along those lines. After all, Paul Rudd, who plays the main character in this film, has appeared in some of them. What I watched, instead, was a light, charming comedy, which left me with a nice smile at the end of the film. In other words, it is a feel-good movie, with a little twisted humor, that will conquer your heart.Paul Rudd is Ned, a good-natured, nothing-worries-me kind of guy, who also happens to be quite nave in the ways of life. Right at the beginning of the movie, he is arrested for selling pot, trying to be good to be a cop. He is released after a while, and, penniless, goes to live with his girlfriend. Unfortunately for Ned, she now has a new boyfriend, and doesn't want anything to do with him. Ned then goes to live with his mother, who loves him, but things again don't work out for him. However, he has three sisters and he tries his luck by spending time in their homes. He moves in with Liz, who is married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), an obnoxious fellow that doesn't like Ned. Ned also tries living with Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), and her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott), who likes Ned better than Dylan. Ned is also allowed to live with Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), who happens to be lesbian and shares an apartment with Cindy (Rashida Jones), where he is accepted by both. To his bad luck, and due to his naivet&eacute;, Ned is too sincere in his statements when he opens his mouth, and gets people - his sisters included - in trouble. Add to this, all three sisters have different personalities and problems of their own, and you will have volatile and funny at times situation.""Our Idiot Brother's"" main message, I think, comes with Ned himself. He believes in the good in everybody and always gives people the benefit of the doubt, thinking that they will reciprocate to his goodness. We all know that this is not the case in real life, but we would love it to be that way. The Blu-ray edition of the film includes commentary by director Jesse Peretz, deleted and extended scenes, and a making-of feature.

1428879,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B004UXUWEC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[5, 5]","Our Idiot Brother is a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half. There are a few good jokes. I was pleasantly surprised with the story.I expected this film to be more like a Jim Carrey film, Dumb and Dumber, where Paul Rudd does really stupid things for comedic effect. This film is so much better than Dumb and Dumber and forgoes the slapstick stupid jokes.The film opens with Ned (Paul Rudd) working at a farm stand. A uniformed police officer asks Ned if he will sell him marijuana. Ned sells him the drugs and ends up in jail. The film starts with Ned's release from prison. The hook with this film, Ned appears to be a simpleton, but in fact he is a trusting and honest soul.There are moments when this film feels like a mash up of Liar Liar and The Invention of Lying. In some ways Our Idiot Brother is about telling the truth, but it is more about how much he cares for his three sisters and mother. Ultimately he turns everybody's life upside down and the film is very quickly resolved in the last few minutes.Paul Rudd normally annoys me, but he somehow didn't play his usual character in this film, and I liked him. There are a few funny winks at other films - he asks his nephew why he's never seen Anchorman (Paul Rudd was in that Will Farrell film). There is also a long sequence about the Pink Panther. Steve Coogan, as a documentary film director, winks at Black Swan when he tries to film the pain of being a Russian ballet dancer. I loved the three sisters. In different ways, the three were beautiful. Elizabeth Banks is wound up extra tight as Miranda. Zooey Deschanel has almost passed her use by date with the quirkiness, she plays the sexually confused sister Natalie (one of her two love interests is Rashida Jones Parks and Recreation and The Office). Emily Mortimer plays Ned's confused married sister Liz. Adam Scott plays Miranda's neighbor, and I just couldn't stop thinking he was trying to be Joel McHale.This film ended with a series of out take vignettes that played along with the credits. This is almost always the death knell of a film, one that was supposed to be funny but wasn't, so they try to rescue it with hilarious out takes at the end. This film was no exception; the out takes were completely unnecessary and not very funny.The film is rated R for talk about drugs and sex, and nudity. The nudity was Steve Coogan; none of the women took their clothes off. You may want to avert your eyes when you see Steve Coogan walk toward the camera with his hands covering his crotch, he turns around, and bends over to get some keys, and there it is in full view from the rear. A mature younger viewer could probably watch this film.The DVD included a horrifically bad making of featurette. It is the classic retelling of the movie with very little about how the film was made. Nothing worth watching there. There are a few deleted and extended scenes. I think the first and last ones would have improved the film.

Instead of going the blockbuster route he takes off-the-wall parts in small disarming films like this one.  His Ned Rockland might be his most disarming and indelible screen role yet.  The film starts with Ned selling weed to a uniformed police officer.  After his release from prison circumstances lead him to live with his family.  Ned is a trusting soul who takes people at face value.  This trait is born more out of naivete then idiocy.  Each of his three sisters have built lives that are as precarious as a house of cards.  When Ned comes into their lives his blunt honesty causes the charades they've each devised to come tumbling down.  The results are both heartbreaking and heartwarming.

Mckinzie,"[3, 6]","Obviously the people who made this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to make: (1) a mostly family-friendly movie about a man who is oddly naive (and oddly likeable) who goes through life making ridiculous choices that get him in trouble and whose sisters, unlike the rest of the population, don't think much of him.  Or (2) an edgy, adult comedy about the quirky sex lives and weird family dynamics of several sisters.  Just as I would start almost enjoying one movie, the other one would creep in and take over and I would have to adjust to that movie.  The part about the brother was funny in places, though not really all that engaging, but then these sex things would all of a sudden pop up for no discernable reason and I'd find myself losing the plot while I pondered what the point was in putting in this or that subplot.  And it's not that there were so many sex scenes, either, or that they showed much more than just kissing most of the time.  Just one now and then, when you didn't expect it.  I kept getting the sisters confused with each other, also, so it was hard to keep track as to who was having sex with whom.  However, I'm pretty confident that one brother-in-law was having some fun while he was supposed to be in a meeting (this one included some nudity), one sister is bi-sexual and possibly cheating on her lesbian live-in (two of the sisters looked a lot alike, so I had trouble knowing who I was seeing sometimes) and so on and so forth.  I got tired of trying to keep track of what was going on and realized that I didn't care how it ended.  I figured the brother would come out alright.  In spite of the title, he was the only one in the family with any brain cells, so far as I could see, and that is NOT a compliment to him or his family.  And I figured the sisters would either wake up to the fact that he's smarter than they are, or they wouldn't and I really didn't care which.  There was also some profanity, which nearly always turns me off, especially if there isn't any real reason for it.

When the movie begins we see him selling produce from the farm on which he is living at a local farmers' market. A policeman in uniform comes up to him and hints strongly that he would like to buy some pot. Ned resists, but after much protestation by the policeman that he really wants the weed and won't arrest him, Ned gives him a bag (along with some rhubarb) and refuses to take payment. Only after much cajoling on the part of the policeman does he agree to take 20 dollars, at which time the policeman arrests him. Ned spends nine months in jail before he is released. (This was one of the few things in this movie I found improbable, since it is obvious that this is a clear case of entrapment.) When Ned returns to the farm, he finds the girl with whom he was living with another man. All Ned really wants, however, is to take his dog (named Willie Nelson), but the girl refuses.Ned then lives in turn with his mother and his sisters, as each pawns him off on one of the others. During this time he continues to commit various blunders which create more problems for him or his sisters (such as telling his sisters about the infidelity of their partners and, unprompted, telling his parole officer that he has smoked a joint with a younger fellow).In the end, Ned finds his niche as the proprietor of a candle shop. (His business partner is the fellow who had moved in with his ex-girlfriend.) He is doing what he wants and is happy. (And he has been reunited with Willie Nelson.)Although this movie is not at all profound, it does a good job of portraying Ned as a fellow who, despite his naivete and his occasional lack of common sense, is a totally goodhearted and likable person, one whose presence makes the world a somewhat better place.",4,Decent comedy with a positive message,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,1915,"['Idiot', 'Brother', 'title', 'comedic', 'billing', 'surprisingly', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'Ned', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'well-intentioned', 'rather', 'naive', 'fellow', 'When', 'movie', 'see', 'selling', 'produce', 'farm', 'living', 'local', 'farmers', 'market', 'policeman', 'uniform', 'up', 'hints', 'strongly', 'would', 'like', 'buy', 'pot', 'Ned', 'resists', 'much', 'protestation', 'policeman', 'really', 'weed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'arrest', 'Ned', 'bag', 'rhubarb', 'take', 'payment', 'Only', 'much', 'cajoling', 'part', 'policeman', 'agree', 'take', '20', 'dollars', 'time', 'policeman', 'Ned', 'nine', 'months', 'jail', 'released', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'found', 'improbable', 'obvious', 'clear', 'case', 'entrapment', 'When', 'Ned', 'farm', 'girl', 'whom', 'was', 'living', 'man', 'Ned', 'really', 'however', 'take', 'dog', 'named', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'girl', 'refuses.Ned', 'then', 'turn', 'mother', 'sisters', 'pawns', 'off', 'one', 'others', 'time', 'commit', 'various', 'blunders', 'create', 'more', 'problems', 'sisters', 'such', 'telling', 'sisters', 'infidelity', 'partners', 'unprompted', 'telling', 'parole', 'officer', 'smoked', 'joint', 'younger', 'fellow', 'end', 'Ned', 'niche', 'proprietor', 'candle', 'shop', 'business', 'partner', 'fellow', 'who', 'had', 'moved', 'ex-girlfriend', 'doing', 'what', 'happy', 'been', 'reunited', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'movie', 'not', 'profound', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Ned', 'fellow', 'who', 'naivete', 'occasional', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'totally', 'goodhearted', 'likable', 'person', 'one', 'presence', 'world', 'somewhat', 'better', 'place']",Our Idiot Brother

1428890,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004UXUWEC,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","I really like the cast of this small-scale 2011 comedy directed by Jesse Peretz, and Paul Rudd has certainly proven to be a likeable comedy lead not afraid to make a fool of himself (2009'sI Love You, Man, for example). Whereas he usually plays nebbish versions of the overly sensitive male, the actor goes in quite a different direction with this character-driven vehicle playing Ned Rockliffe, a bearded, long-haired man-child so gullible that he gives everyone the benefit of the doubt, much to the consternation of his constantly frustrated sisters. The concept is amusing on the surface, but the execution is on the messy side with a surprising, perhaps unintended amount of misogyny informing the storyline. The approach could have been more forgivable if there were plenty of laughs, but aside from a few unexpected sight gags, the humor is more  observational in nature and generated only a few chuckles from me.Co-written by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall, the movie opens with Ned ignorantly selling marijuana to a cop at his weekend organic produce stand. After he gets released from eight months in prison, he gets dumped by his organic-farmer girlfriend Janet. She not only selfishly keeps his beloved dog ""Willie Nelson"" but had already started shacking up with a new hippie boyfriend Billy who actually sympathizes with Ned. Homeless and without any means to take care of himself, Ned looks to his three sisters for shelter. First, he stays with Liz, the mousy, constantly exhausted mother of two whose filmmaker husband Dylan is cheating on her with his documentary subject, a comely Russian ballerina. When Liz, a severe pacifist, finds Ned teaching her son karate moves, he moves in with Miranda, a pretentious writer for Vanity Fair, who will stop at nothing to secure a cover story about a scandalized socialite who also takes a liking to Ned. Finally, when Miranda tires of his unintentional meddling, he shows up at the door of his youngest sister Natalie, a space cadet who can't make up her mind about committing to her lesbian partner Cindy.Rudd is one of the few comic actors who can get away with playing the title role in such a deceptively facile manner. Emily Mortimer and especially Zooey Deschanel nicely play Liz and Natalie to their accustomed types, but I was most surprised how well Elizabeth Banks channeled the brittle edginess of Parker Posey to play Miranda with such fierce comic conviction since she usually plays distaff versions of Ned in her comedies. The three actresses definitely manage a convincing sisterly rapport full of judgment and pettiness. In a reversal of the wet-blanket role she played in last year'sHow Do You Know, Kathryn Hahn goes for spiteful as Janet. The cumulative effort of these actresses does not offset the ""sour grapes"" attitude that the script has them convey to react to Ned's careless yet well-meaning behavior.

Though this doesn't stray far from that groove it's still a nice respite.Here's the scoop. Ned (Paul Rudd) is the only male in a litter with three other sisters. He's kind of a dim bulb but, he's a true innocent, and just not in tune with how lousy people can be. He ends up doing some time for selling pot to a uniformed cop. When he gets out his girl has evicted him from their organic farm while she takes up with another beau. He now needs the support of his sisters and mom to get back into the real world. His innocence ends up causing his sisters no end of difficulty and things come to a head.This is a big-hearted film. His sisters get ticked at him because they feel he's screwing up their lives, while in reality, it's their dishonesty and poor choices that are doing them in. He simply doesn't realize that he is exposing that side of them. Rudd finds the right note for his character. He's a sweet guy with a great capacity for love. He just needs to find the right groove to let it all happen. His sisters are a mixed lot. Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a high-powered writer for a magazine trying to score her first big article. Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a documentary film maker. She has let herself go after the birth of their recent child and her husband treats her like an ashtray. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is sexually confused and it's causing grief with her lover Cindy (Rashida Jones). This is some shrewd casting. All the actors have appeal to a like-minded audience and all have appeared in similar movies, so the producers are pretty much pre-selecting their following.The acting, directing, editing and music are on par with the project. Some of the scenes are a bit clunky, but others are really well written with a squinty eye on how overly in tune we are with ourselves and the society around us. This is a very ""now"" movie.This isn't quite worth the four stars I gave I but it is an enjoyable, feel-good flick that will easily pass the viewer's time. This isn't a fine wine.

Paul Rudd plays Ned, a man looking for some kind of stability in his life, after his stint in prison. Despite the title, I wouldn't call his character an idiot. Yes, he did sell marijuana to a uniformed police officer, but this opening scene reveals more about his personality than his seemingly dim wit. Rather, Ned is a kind of model of a man who only sees the good in others, and tries to live his life to the service of these people.Of course, this means others often take advantage of him. Over the course of the film, Ned tries to raise enough money to move into a barn at the farm where he worked, prior to his stint in jail. While he does this, he lives, for a short time, with each of his three sisters. As you can imagine, his time with each sister ends with them completely frustrated at him, and passing him along to the next. The sisters are all played by talented actress. Initially, I had trouble accepting them all as one family, one sister even has a British accent, but the story was so well written that I soon forgot about this completely.This film is never splashy in its delivery. There are some moments in particular where you could feel the whole production trying to make you feel a certain way. It worked!

I mean, we've all seen Paul Rudd in his Judd Apatow comedies, slinging one amazing profane-laden zinger after another. He's become one of the constant's in the world of the ""Hard R"" comedies. And it felt like the previews were trying to push it in that direction. But that is not what this movie is-not by a long shot.What it ended up being was a sweet, light-hearted drama with comedic elements. We watch as Paul Rudd's character tries to make his way through the world in his very innocent and well-meaning way. For his part, Rudd is absolutely fantastic and imbues the role with an utter sense of being genuine. Yes, there were times that his naivete and inability to see people as being bad was pushed a tad too far and stretched the imagination beyond its reasonable limits, leaving me rolling my eyes. But overall his portrayal was quite believable for the setting.It's also to be commended that Rudd was loaded with such a talented supporting cast. Zooey Deschanel just keeps getting better and better. She and Elizabeth Banks play fantastic, world-weary counterpoints to Rudd's eternal optimist. The film is loaded with so many stars and each one turns in a well-rounded and never over-the-top performance.I quickly came to realize that this was a film that my parents would probably enjoy far more than I, which is a surprise considering it's a Paul Rudd vehicle. But the man is versatile and has shown his acting chops time and again for the better part of two decades. This is definitely not for anyone looking to see another 40-Year Old Virgin or Superbad.

Jesse Peretz  (who also directs), Evgenia Peretz, and David Schisgall came up with this stew pot story, populated it with some fine actors and the result isles disappointing than expected.  When a line by the `idiot brother' Ned states `I like to think that if you put your trust out there; if you really give people the benefit of the doubt, see their best intentions, people will rise to the occasion' then we know that some thought was invested in this otherwise indulgent silly comedy.Ned (Paul Rudd, of course) lived a happy hippie life growing organic vegetables on a farm with his hippie girlfriend and his dog named Willie Nelson, but unexpected troubles arise when in a sting when he gives marijuana to a police officer and takes money for the transaction - recipe for jail. When he gets out of jail, he at first lives with his understanding mother (Shirley Knight) and then is off to live/freeload with his sisters - Zooey Deschanel, Elizabeth Banks, and Emily Mortimer - each with her won problems of infidelity (Steve Coogan), pregnancy while in a lesbian relationship (with Rashida Jones), and falsified news gathering. While Ned is still happy, his sisters are much less so after he manages to screw up one marriage, one job opportunity, one budding relationship and one domestic partnership. He sees those problems as breakdowns in communication, but his sisters see him as an idiot. It is the aftermath of the comedic blowups that gives a bit of reality testing to the sisters.One can wonder why actors of the caliber of Emily Mortimer, Shirley Knight, and Hugh Dancy (in a brief cameo) align with duds like this, but times are tough for everyone and probably the producers thought this film would appeal to audiences in the theaters...wrong.

I bring this line up because it really is the crux of the film's story.  However, after giving this decidedly uneven comedy the benefit of the doubt, I still walked away disappointed.Our Idiot Brother, as the title suggests, is about the idiot brother of a family.  Ned, the lovable idiot that he is, is released from jail after stupidly selling pot to a police officer.  Upon release, his girlfriend moved on with her life and Ned has nowhere to go.  Ned's sisters (Banks, Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer) decide to step up and help him out by letting him stay at their places briefly.The best, most charming moments of the film involve Ned and his very caring personality.  As much of an idiot as he is (and believe me, he lives up to the title), he really does mean well in what he does, and it's absolutely heart-warming when we see Ned being a great uncle or a caring brother.That's just about where I stop piling praise, however.  The film was advertised as a comedy, not a melodramatic one.  That's where director Jesse Peretz hits some speed-bumps.  Peretz mistakes gooey giggles for righteous laughs one too many times, and the results are extremely uneven, to a point where I was constantly checking my phone in the theater, which is NEVER a good thing.BOTTOM LINE:  While it is very heart-warming and inspiring, Our Idiot Brother doesn't really deserve to be considered a full-fledged comedy.5.5 OUT OF 10(copied from my Review blog on tumblr, located at: [...])",3,It's hard for me to call it a comedy...,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1682,"['beginning', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'character', 'Ned', 'like', 'think', 'really', 'give', 'people', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'see', 'best', 'intentions', 'people', 'will', 'rise', 'occasion', 'bring', 'line', 'up', 'really', 'crux', 'film', 'story', 'However', 'giving', 'decidedly', 'uneven', 'comedy', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'still', 'walked', 'away', 'disappointed.Our', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'title', 'idiot', 'brother', 'family', 'Ned', 'lovable', 'idiot', 'released', 'jail', 'stupidly', 'selling', 'pot', 'police', 'officer', 'release', 'girlfriend', 'moved', 'life', 'Ned', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Ned', 'sisters', 'Banks', 'Deschanel', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'decide', 'step', 'up', 'help', 'out', 'letting', 'stay', 'places', 'briefly.The', 'best', 'most', 'charming', 'moments', 'film', 'involve', 'Ned', 'very', 'caring', 'personality', 'much', 'idiot', 'believe', 'up', 'title', 'really', 'mean', 'well', 'what', 'absolutely', 'heart-warming', 'when', 'see', 'Ned', 'being', 'great', 'uncle', 'caring', 'brother.That', 'just', 'where', 'stop', 'piling', 'praise', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'not', 'melodramatic', 'one', 'where', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Peretz', 'speed-bumps', 'Peretz', 'gooey', 'giggles', 'righteous', 'laughs', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'results', 'are', 'extremely', 'uneven', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'constantly', 'checking', 'phone', 'theater', 'NEVER', 'good', 'thing.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'very', 'heart-warming', 'inspiring', 'Idiot', 'Brother', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'considered', 'full-fledged', 'comedy.5.5', 'OUT', '10', 'copied', 'Review', 'blog', 'tumblr', 'located', '[', ']']",Our Idiot Brother

As the ""idiot"" brother Ned of the title, Rudd infiltrates the lives of his three sisters, each successful by her own definition: Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), the pansexual lesbian-ish sister in a loving monogamous relationship with Cindy (masterfully played by Rashida Jones); Liz (Emily Mortimer), the hyper-conscious and sensitive Mom committed to raising self-actualized kids; and Miranda (Elizabeth Banks, who bears a very spooky resemblance to Parker Posey in this film), the cutthroat journalist who writes for Vanity Fair. By sheer virtue of his almost child-like honesty, Ned manages to learn secrets about each one of his sisters--secrets that, once revealed, have very amusing but also very profound consequences. The script is intelligent, the performances are superb all around (including Adam Scott, T.J.

Menta, Jr.","[4, 5]","Not nearly as broad and goofy as the film's title and advertising make it out to be, ""Our Idiot Brother"" is just a nice little comedy/drama (yes, there's actually some drama here), about Ned (Paul Rudd) a naive but open-hearted guy who shakes things up when he moves back in the vicinity of his three sisters after a stint in prison for committing a non-violent and truly idiotic crime.  The sisters (played by the talented and fetching Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer) all have their own problems- revolving around their jobs, families, and/or love lives- which become further complicated when Ned's antics are stirred into the mix.Ned isn't truly an idiot, just a guy whose too-trusting nature often results in idiotic situations that gum up the works for him and, now that he's back home, his siblings.  Of course, Ned's personal craziness also illuminates the truly idiotic and crazy situations that his sisters have either created or tolerate in their own lives.  Does Ned, despite being eye-rollingly annoying most of the time, help nudge his sisters back on the right path?  And in return, do they help Ned free himself from his own eccentriciites and put him on more stable footing, too?  Unless you've never seen an American comedy/drama before, you'll see the ""yes"" answer to both of those questions coming from a mile away.But that's okay.  With films like this one, it's the journey that counts, not the need for an unpredictable conclusion.

1428913,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004UXUWEC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[20, 26]","Our Idiot Brother premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was well-received enough that the Weinstein Company picked it up for distribution. With an indie sensibility strongly intact, it's not a film typically found in wide release, despite boasting actors well-acquainted with the mainstream and story elements similar to those found in more mainstream fare. The independent style of the film, not reflected in the look or quality of the film, just the way the story is told, may alienate mainstream viewers unable to accept the quirky nature of the characters.The premise is pretty simplistic. We first meet Ned (Paul Rudd), the idiot brother of the title, working at a farmer's market alongside his dog Willie Nelson. Ned is yanked from his peaceful existence after he sells weed to a police officer. A police officer in uniform. After he is released from prison, Ned, whose beard and scruffy appearance make him resemble Jesus, finds that his hippie girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) has moved on and refuses to return Willie Nelson to him. Ned has three sisters: Liz (Emily Mortimer), an insecure housewife and mother, married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), a heartless documentary filmmaker; Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), a journalist for Vanity Fair ruthlessly attempting to publish her first article; and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), a bi-sexual hipster who lives with her girlfriend Cindy (Rashida Jones) and five other roommates. The script places Ned in the care of his three sisters, where he proceeds to intervene in their lives and wreak havoc.There's not much more to it than that as Our Idiot Brother is rather short on plot, but makes up for it with an almost unheard of amount of emphasis on character. The characters in the film are well-developed, with distinctly drawn personalities that ultimately set them (and the film) apart from traditional Hollywood fare. The characters inhabiting the film (with only a few exceptions) are perpetually nice, particularly the ""idiot"" of the title. Ned is achingly sweet, very trusting, easily manipulated, easy-going, and seemingly incapable of lying. His character is a person that could make the world a better place and he's not so much an ""idiot"" as a very gentle soul. Paul Rudd, who possesses a charm and likability that is unequaled by his contemporaries, really carries this movie and is most responsible for making it work. Ned is such a warm character that he's nearly impossible to dislike, even if you don't like the film itself.The sisters of Our Idiot Brother don't fall into the Hollywood trapping of being tired clich&eacute;s, although some of the characterization may initially seem familiar. Just the idea that three siblings can be so vastly different, with their only similarity being their love for each other is kind of a clich&eacute; at this point. What's refreshing is that familiar elements like Liz being an insecure housewife unaware that she's married to a snake and Miranda being a bossy, ruthless journalist attempting to establish herself while alienating male attention are developed enough that it's easy to accept and believe. Even Natalie isn't the typical Hollywood lesbian, as her character's sexuality doesn't seem to be used to provoke a reaction. It's treated with realism, with only the slightest acknowledgement that it's out of the ordinary (for some people). All three are very capable actresses and they carry the film just as much as Rudd. Deschanel brings a deadpan-perfection to her role and is able to play with the most original character arc of the three. All three sisters bring different styles of humor, but I found Deschanel most amusing, although this could be a biased evaluation due to my complete adoration for her. All of the characters are quirky, as is the norm for an indie comedy, but the script fleshes them out and makes them three-dimensional. The film makes a valiant attempt to draw its comedy from the characters rather than relying on contrived situations and clever quips to make up its humor. Our Idiot Brother has its share of clever dialogue certainly, but it's much more pre-occupied with character interactions.This movie will have its share of people who dislike it. Marketed as a comedy, Our Idiot Brother is not a full-blown comedy in the vein of Judd Apatow with laugh-out-loud moments every few seconds. Remember that `comedy' is defined as ""a movie of light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending."" A comedy is not required to make its audience laugh every few seconds or even once, for that matter. The dialogue between Ned and his parole officer (an amusing performance by Sterling K. Brown) early on is very funny, but the majority of the film simply maintains a tone of comedy without becoming a complete laugh riot.During the first half of Our Idiot Brother, I wasn't sure if I was actually enjoying the film. It seemed a bit uneven, wasn't hilariously funny, and its ""witless man helps better the lives of those around him"" plot has been done to death in Hollywood. What I found was that Our Idiot Brother is a slow-build that sinks in as it progresses. The script/film is not perfect, but takes a familiar story and does something effective and successful with it. It's a heartwarming film that works on the strengths of its characters and the emotion it draws from you on their behalf. By the time it reached its ""cutesy"" ending (strongly reminiscent of(500) Days of Summer), I accepted it as a perfectly logical conclusion. Opinions will be sharply divided over the film, but there's plenty to like about the characters that inhabit it and the performances that carry it.GRADE: B+",4,An Indie Comedy Masquerading as a

I couldn't of been more wrong. This movie is more about a man who is misunderstood and who doesn't have a lot of common sense but is super nice which borders on stupidity at times. His family passes him around like he is some kind of toy because they do not understand him. However, if the family would look closer they would realize that they are just as messed up as Ned is in one way or another. Throughout the movie you see Ned get into a lot of mischief and mishaps that only makes his family stronger and makes his sisters understand him better.I think this movie is more of a drama than a comedy but it is still a really good movie. I was anxious to see it though because I am a big fan of Zooey Deschanel and I'm glad that I did.

1428916,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UXUWEC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","With its cast of comedy heavyweights, its rather silly title, and a marketing campaign geared in the wrong direction--""Our Idiot Brother"" is a film that may certainly fail to meet the expectations of an audience looking for a rude and ribald laugh riot.  And others that would be more likely to appreciate its simpler charms might be wary to sample it due to these preconceived notions.  But I have to say--for my money, ""Our Idiot Brother"" is a refreshingly sweet family dramedy.  It has such a big heart and an underlying goodness and faith in humanity that is rare to see.  The movie doesn't have lofty goals or aspire to be an important viewing experience, and its lack of pretensions are appreciated.  This is simply an entertaining film with a cast sharing great chemistry and gentle humor.Paul Rudd plays the titular lead, the so-called idiot brother.  Rudd, always a strong comedic presence, doesn't get enough credit for being a genuinely terrific actor with unexpected range.  Here, his character is so guileless and so genuine that he opts to see only the very best in people.  His honesty, innocence, and willingness to really connect with others sometimes gets him into hot water.  He seems unwilling or unable to plug into the negative energy stream, and just wants to live free and love.  So silly, so sweet, and so surprisingly smart--there are quite a few layers at work here.  I think it's a great performance.  Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer are Rudd's trio of sisters.  Each is navigating a complicated personal crisis and Rudd's return home from prison wreaks havoc on their carefully constructed lives.  But is he really the problem?  Or might there be a method to his madness?Part of why I enjoyed ""Our Idiot Brother"" so much was that it had the potential to be a disaster.  To pull off sweet charm without crossing the line into sentimental treacle is a fine balancing act that many films fail to straddle successfully.  Here, there is a tartness to all of the performances (and really, you couldn't ask for a better cast) that grounds the relationships believably.  Steve Coogan, Adam Scott, Shirley Knight, Rashida Jones, and Hugh Dancy all have noteworthy moments as well.  Sweet without being saccharine, quirky without being ridiculous--this simple and straightforward movie was a real delight.  And Rudd, in particular, scores big.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[3, 3]","This movie surprised me, and that is always the best kind, although it doesn't say much about the marketing campaign for this film, which had made me think this would be more of a men-behaving-badly type comedy. Instead Paul Rudd is something of an innocent - a bohemian, good-hearted, trusting soul that never quite gets his act together partly because he gets stepped on quite a bit. He has three sisters, played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer, and after he gets out of jail for selling marijuana to a uniformed police officer (even knowing this in advance doesn't keep it from being funny) he stays with one after the other in succession, while trying to get back on his feet. In each case he complicates their lives by innocently telling the truth - truths they don't want to come out. Much family drama ensues. Throw in a hilarious boho-Buddhist ex-girlfriend and you have lots of quirky, character driven comedy.The film doesn't have any plot beyond that - it's just day to day life as this family drama unfolds. It perhaps does have a message, in the form of the heart and integrity that Paul Rudd's character embodies, which serves as a kind of lightening rod for everyone around him. But not a lot of action, so if you are looking for a big climactic scene with car chases or interrupted weddings etc. you won't find it here.

1428923,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004UXUWEC,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Have you ever seen a movie where you saw the trailer and thought man that looks funny...only to be completely disappointed once you saw the film? Welcome to OUR IDIOT BROTHER.Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is an innocent. Well not quite. I thought more of him as a waste head with visions of a grander world where no one does wrong to anyone else. It's the ideas that the hippies had in the sixties, a peaceful world where everyone can do what they want without affecting anyone else. Too bad reality always seemed to creep in.As the film opens Ned finds himself arrested after selling grass to a local policeman. He was duped into doing so when the policeman convinced him he didn't have a problem with Ned selling drugs and needed it for a headache. Ned is convicted, spends his time in jail and when released comes home to find out his girlfriend dumped him for a new guy and doesn't want him around. Not only that, she refuses to give him back his dog Willie Nelson that she honestly could care less about. With no place to go, Ned returns to his mother's home and looks for ways to save up money so he can buy into the organic farm he and his girlfriend owned together.Into the picture arrives Ned's three sisters and along with them their own problems which he places himself in the middle of as he roams from one to the other living there while working. The first is Liz (Emily Mortimer) who is a stay at home mom married to documentary film maker Dylan (Steve Coogan). The couple is the stereotypical by the book parents whose skills are learned through the things they read and hear about as opposed to living life. Their child must get into the right schools and behave the proper way even though he hates the things they make him do. Ned finds a connection with the youngster and they become quick friends but not quite so much with his folks. Ned takes a job working with Dylan carrying his equipment but one night finds him ""shooting"" his subject, a Russian ballerina, in the nude. Yes, they're having an affair and Ned accidentally leaks this to his other two sisters and causes a stir.The next sister is Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), an up and coming writer for a classy magazine who is hoping for her big break. She has a chance to interview an heiress and the magazine wants her to get as much dirt from her as she can since the heiress was involved with a rather nasty fellow who videotaped their sexual escapades. Ned is working as Miranda's chauffer and inadvertently strikes up a conversation with the woman resulting in getting more information from her than Miranda does since the woman insists on not talking about the scandal. So determined to get the scoop and the job she covets so much, Miranda uses the information Ned got while simply talking to the woman, information he doesn't want her to use, that she'll go to all lengths to get it. This of course leads to Ned moving in with sister three.Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is a wanna be stand up comedian and part time nude model who is anything but funny. Ned moves in with her and her lesbian girlfriend but soon learns that Natalie is pregnant from a one night stand with the artist she poses for (and who Ned poses for as well). You can see where this is heading right now. Ned accidentally reveals all to the girlfriend as they attempt to retrieve Willie Nelson from his ex.So here is the big problem with the movie. You find yourself in the company of a group of people that you could care less about. Not only could you care less about them, you find yourself loathing each and every one of them. I found myself wishing each of them would move on and I wouldn't have to hear any more about them. Ned is the sympathetic character here but he's such a dunce at times that you just want to slap him and say bud, wake up and smell the coffee.I guess this means the actresses do a great job here. After all none of them can truly be as terrible in real life as they appear here, right? And Paul Rudd is always good in nearly everything he does. His Ned is a guy you'd love to spend time with, just not telling him anything about yourself.The worst sin of all that this movie commits is that it never makes you laugh. That's pretty bad for a movie that was advertised as a comedy. Looking back I think I may have chuckled once or twice from start to finish, but being a comedy that's low praise. With all of the better movies out there to rent or watch this movie falls into that category of avoid at all costs. Only die hard Rudd fans will get anything out of this. Others will just be tossing good money away.",2,IDIOT IS AN APPROPRIATE TITLE,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4579,"['Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'where', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'man', 'funny', 'only', 'be', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'once', 'saw', 'film', 'Welcome', 'OUR', 'IDIOT', 'BROTHER.Ned', 'Rochlin', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'innocent', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'thought', 'more', 'waste', 'head', 'visions', 'grander', 'world', 'where', 'one', 'wrong', 'anyone', 'else', 'ideas', 'hippies', 'had', 'sixties', 'peaceful', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'affecting', 'anyone', 'else', 'Too', 'bad', 'reality', 'always', 'seemed', 'creep', 'in.As', 'film', 'Ned', 'arrested', 'selling', 'grass', 'local', 'policeman', 'was', 'duped', 'doing', 'so', 'when', 'policeman', 'convinced', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Ned', 'selling', 'drugs', 'needed', 'headache', 'Ned', 'convicted', 'time', 'jail', 'when', 'released', 'home', 'find', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'dumped', 'new', 'guy', ""n't"", 'want', 'around', 'Not', 'only', 'give', 'back', 'dog', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'honestly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'place', 'go', 'Ned', 'mother', 'home', 'ways', 'save', 'up', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'organic', 'farm', 'girlfriend', 'owned', 'picture', 'Ned', 'three', 'sisters', 'own', 'problems', 'middle', 'one', 'other', 'living', 'there', 'working', 'first', 'Liz', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'who', 'stay', 'home', 'mom', 'married', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'Dylan', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'couple', 'stereotypical', 'book', 'parents', 'skills', 'are', 'learned', 'things', 'read', 'hear', 'as', 'opposed', 'living', 'life', 'child', 'must', 'get', 'right', 'schools', 'behave', 'proper', 'way', 'even', 'things', 'make', 'do', 'Ned', 'connection', 'youngster', 'become', 'quick', 'friends', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'folks', 'Ned', 'job', 'working', 'Dylan', 'carrying', 'equipment', 'one', 'night', 'shooting', 'subject', 'Russian', 'ballerina', 'nude', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'having', 'affair', 'Ned', 'accidentally', 'other', 'two', 'sisters', 'stir.The', 'next', 'sister', 'Miranda', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'up', 'coming', 'writer', 'classy', 'magazine', 'who', 'hoping', 'big', 'break', 'chance', 'interview', 'heiress', 'magazine', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'dirt', 'can', 'heiress', 'was', 'involved', 'rather', 'nasty', 'fellow', 'who', 'videotaped', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'Ned', 'working', 'Miranda', 'chauffer', 'inadvertently', 'up', 'conversation', 'woman', 'resulting', 'getting', 'more', 'information', 'Miranda', 'woman', 'not', 'talking', 'scandal', 'So', 'determined', 'get', 'scoop', 'job', 'so', 'much', 'Miranda', 'information', 'Ned', 'got', 'simply', 'talking', 'woman', 'information', ""n't"", 'want', 'use', ""'ll"", 'go', 'lengths', 'get', 'course', 'leads', 'Ned', 'moving', 'sister', 'three.Natalie', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'stand', 'up', 'comedian', 'part', 'time', 'nude', 'model', 'who', 'anything', 'funny', 'Ned', 'lesbian', 'girlfriend', 'soon', 'Natalie', 'pregnant', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'artist', 'who', 'Ned', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'heading', 'right', 'now', 'Ned', 'accidentally', 'girlfriend', 'attempt', 'retrieve', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'ex.So', 'here', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'find', 'company', 'group', 'people', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'Not', 'only', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'find', 'loathing', 'one', 'found', 'wishing', 'would', 'move', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hear', 'more', 'Ned', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'here', 'such', 'dunce', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'say', 'bud', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'coffee.I', 'guess', 'actresses', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'none', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'terrible', 'real', 'life', 'appear', 'here', 'right', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'always', 'good', 'nearly', 'everything', 'Ned', 'guy', ""'d"", 'love', 'spend', 'time', 'just', 'not', 'telling', 'anything', 'yourself.The', 'worst', 'sin', 'movie', 'never', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'Looking', 'back', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'chuckled', 'once', 'twice', 'start', 'finish', 'being', 'comedy', 'low', 'praise', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'rent', 'watch', 'movie', 'category', 'avoid', 'costs', 'Only', 'die', 'hard', 'Rudd', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'anything', 'Others', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'tossing', 'good', 'money', 'away']",Our Idiot Brother
1428924,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B004UXUWEC,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[2, 3]","This is a movie that I think was poorly promoted. Not under-promoted, mind you, but poorly so. I recall the trailers giving the impression that this would be a Farrelly-style ""dumb comedy."" In fact, it is tonally closer to something like ""The Kids Are All Right,"" with perhaps a bit less social commentary. It stars Paul Rudd in the role of Ned, a man with simple tastes and a clear cut moral sense. He is not stupid, he just views the world in a very simple way - be good to others, and it will usually come back your way. This conflicts with the world-views of his sisters, who from various motivations see this as the way a simpleton might view the world. In many ways, the move is as ""simple"" as Ned. We never meet the father of this family. Almost every character ends up with some sort of ""happy"" ending. Ned's trouble with the law and subsequent incarceration never really seems to negatively impact his life. Naturally, since this is Hollywood after all, Ned's ways end up informing them by example that because of their behavior, their worlds are a darker, less happy place; and that they would be improved by adopting his ways, becoming more forthright, loving, and caring people. Is it a complex psychodrama that really plumbs the depths of the human condition? No. But it is charmingly acted (despite none of the four principals actually looking related) and provides a few laughs.The movie is R-rated, and deserves the rating, due to a fair amount of swearing, some sexual situations, and some nudity. It's probably not one to show the younger kids. But I watched it with my wife and parents-in-law, and wasn't nearly as embarrassed as I was by something like ""Wedding Crashers."" The sexual elements and swear words were played strictly for laughs, not for titillation, and were relatively brief.As far as the DVD goes, the movie transfer was very pleasing. Detail was very nice for a DVD - not looking high-def or anything, but looking like very good cable television. Colors were vibrant but not over-done, and dark scenes looked fine.

Forced to live with first one sister before moving to the next, Ned manages to hold on to his true nature - he is able to see the good in even the most horrible person. And although each of his sisters manages to enmesh herself in a complicated situation (relationship, job, etc.), Ned remains the one constant in the family and the one whose light ends up prevailing.I have to admit that I expected this to be another juvenile movie, poking fun at stoners and dragging out the same tired cliches about life in the fast lane and the benefits of slowing down and taking each day one at a time. There are those elements here, but this movie suprised me by the quality of the writing and the depth of the characters.

Michael,"[25, 30]","Paul Rudd's very sweet and endearing comedy about a stoner who just likes living a happy life in our cynical and often cruel world is a welcome comedy in this recent era of gross-out blockbusters (many of which you can find Rudd in, courtest of Apatow).Ned (Rudd) is an organic farmer who is just too nice. So nice that he readily sells marijuana to someone he KNOWS is a cop. Of course, he only accepted money from the officer because said policeman INSISTED on paying for it... Ned was just going to give it away.That tells you the kind of person Ned is... nice to the point of stupidity.Once he gets out of jail and on probation, he pretty much plays a game of round robin, living alternately with his three sisters who each have their own issues that Ned can't help but complicate. Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is trying to track down a story that she could source Ned on... if only he would lie (which he won't). Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is pregnant, normally something to celebrate if she weren't in a committed relationship with another woman (Rashida Jones), a fact which Ned can't keep to himself. And, finally, Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a frustrating git of a pseudo-artiste husband (played here brilliantly by Steve Coogan as the guy you love to hate) whom Ned finds out is cheating on her.Jesse Peretz has put together a great cast that gels well in all of their roles and the movie only suffers here and there in terms of delivery, pacing and overall plotting.I loved Katy Hahn and TJ Miller as Ned's ex and her new boyfriend respectively. It especially worked in the denouement when we finally find out Ned's fate in terms of life and love. TJ Miller usually annoys me as he's typecast as the jerk slacker in most of his other roles (She's Out of My League, Cloverfield), but he really settled into his part of overly-helpful Billy. Really, he's just another Ned in the world and, even though we only see him in a few scenes, it worked.The main problem I had with the film was just how quickly the third act resolution occurs, when the sisters all finally have their ""duh"" moment and realize that Ned's way of looking at the world is better than theirs. It all felt rushed, as if the story focused too much on how Ned unintentionally knocks down their house of card lives and not enough on how they would have to put them back together.Still there was a lot for me to love about this film. I'd recommend at least a rental, if not a purchase. It's definitely worth seeing for all the feel-good laughs to be had, even if there's nothing really laugh-out-loud until you get to the outtakes.",4,Great stuff... even if the sisters are too dense.,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2608,"['Paul', 'Rudd', 'very', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'comedy', 'stoner', 'who', 'just', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'cynical', 'often', 'cruel', 'world', 'welcome', 'comedy', 'recent', 'era', 'gross-out', 'blockbusters', 'many', 'can', 'find', 'Rudd', 'courtest', 'Apatow', '.Ned', 'Rudd', 'organic', 'farmer', 'who', 'just', 'too', 'nice', 'So', 'nice', 'readily', 'marijuana', 'someone', 'KNOWS', 'cop', 'course', 'only', 'accepted', 'money', 'officer', 'said', 'policeman', 'INSISTED', 'paying', 'Ned', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'give', 'away.That', 'kind', 'person', 'Ned', 'nice', 'point', 'stupidity.Once', 'jail', 'probation', 'pretty', 'much', 'game', 'round', 'robin', 'living', 'alternately', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'Ned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'complicate', 'Miranda', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'story', 'could', 'source', 'Ned', 'only', 'would', 'lie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Natalie', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'pregnant', 'normally', 'something', 'celebrate', 'were', ""n't"", 'committed', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'fact', 'Ned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'finally', 'Liz', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'married', 'frustrating', 'git', 'pseudo-artiste', 'husband', 'played', 'here', 'brilliantly', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'guy', 'love', 'hate', 'whom', 'Ned', 'out', 'cheating', 'her.Jesse', 'Peretz', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'gels', 'well', 'roles', 'movie', 'only', 'here', 'there', 'terms', 'delivery', 'pacing', 'overall', 'plotting.I', 'loved', 'Katy', 'Hahn', 'TJ', 'Miller', 'Ned', 'ex', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'respectively', 'especially', 'worked', 'denouement', 'when', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'Ned', 'fate', 'terms', 'life', 'love', 'TJ', 'Miller', 'usually', 'jerk', 'slacker', 'most', 'other', 'roles', 'My', 'League', 'Cloverfield', 'really', 'settled', 'part', 'overly-helpful', 'Billy', 'Really', 'just', 'Ned', 'world', 'even', 'only', 'see', 'few', 'scenes', 'worked.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'quickly', 'third', 'act', 'resolution', 'occurs', 'when', 'sisters', 'finally', 'have', 'duh', 'moment', 'realize', 'Ned', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'better', 'felt', 'rushed', 'story', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'Ned', 'unintentionally', 'down', 'house', 'card', 'lives', 'not', 'enough', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'back', 'together.Still', 'was', 'lot', 'love', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'least', 'rental', 'not', 'purchase', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'feel-good', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'even', 'nothing', 'really', 'laugh-out-loud', 'get', 'outtakes']",Our Idiot Brother

1428938,A3HNBLO0KIJVTS,B004UXUWEC,"paper tiger ""Adriel August""","[1, 2]","When I first saw the trailer for Our Idiot Brother Advertised, I was semi interested due to the cast. Honestly, the cast is great. Everyone has a very solid character and performance. I could not really relate too much to any of the characters because the stupidity was so over the top. There were no surprises and many situations were very clich&eacute;. However when it comes to story, Our Idiot Brother is very lacking and just plain dumb.Parts reminded me of Dumb and Dumber simply because Ned (Paul Rudd) says some really stupid things and cannot keep a secret. Ned is a very nice guy and quite easy to get along with. So easy that everyone tells him their secrets, and then he tells everyone else. It tried to be like Juno or Little Miss Sunshine or another cute indie film, however it failed miserably. At the end of the movie when the credits rolled, so did my eyes and I felt like I just wasted the past 90 minutes of my life on a film which I got nothing out of. There were are few time where I did chuckle, however the situations were so outrageous that I did not find it humorous, I found it stupid.I have watched many new movies recently and this one is by far the worst. Our Idiot Brother tried to be something it's not, then tried to give you that warm ""heart in the right place"" movie feeling, which is also failed at. The cast is amazing and it seemed so close to being a funny flick, but I ended up feeling bad for Ned, and the rest of his family because of all their bad situations and horrible choices. Ned simply was honest with them.Also, quick note; I was very disappointed with Zooey Deschanel. Zooey is my reason for getting out of bed in the morning.

In many ways it is a meditation on innocence and the effects it has on and in a ""realistic"" world. Paul Rudd does a great job playing an overly easy-going character who is smarter than Forest Gump, yet no less charming for all his simplicity. It almost makes one think of Dostoevsky's main character in his novel, ""The Idiot.""The morality of the film is modern, and so as Rudd's character finds his way in and out of situations that are morally ambiguous, the viewer finds certain value judgments being made on things such as the acceptability of homo-sexuality and casual drug-use being implied in the film. Other issues are dealt with more humorously, and the sense of a strong moral ethic is maintained by the film throughout.The film succeeds well at capturing the tension between humor and seriousness, and revolves around Rudd's character and his three sisters whose lives he is thrown into after a certain mishap in his life. The film is then the progressive unpacking of these lives as people interact with his disarmingly sincere and incredibly bumbling simplicity.I hope to not have made the film sound too serious.

In his own sweet way, Ned tends to cause havoc in the lives of those around him.The film is more of a family dramedy than a flat-out comedy, but there is plenty of humor.  The performances of this ensemble cast are uniformly terrific.  And what a supporting cast it is!  In addition to the actors mentioned above, look for Steve Coogan, Katherine Hahn, Hugh Dancy (who I barely recognized in his small role), Rashida Jones (also playing way against type), TJ Miller, and other recognizable faces.I won't claim that every moment of the film is pure gold, but overall I found it very enjoyable--and the last 15 minutes were just fantastic.  It's a film I'll be happy to view again.Furthermore, there is a nice selection of DVD extras on the disk.  There's a fairly typical 15-minute making-of film featuring cast and crew.  There are four deleted or extended scenes, including an alternate ending.  (The one they went with was stronger, but it's always fun to see these things.)  And there's feature commentary with the director.  As is often the case, he probably could have used another person to play off of in the commentary, but it was interesting nonetheless.I'm actually surprises me that this film wasn't more successful.  Yes, it's a little quirky, but I come back to the tag line on the film's poster, which cracked me up the first time I saw it:  Our Idiot Brother--Every family has one.  LOL.  As it happens, I have no brothers, but there is something universal about this tale of adult siblings.

He is so taken in by people that when a uniformed police officer asks him for marijuana and insists on paying for it, Ned (Rudd) is completely taken aback when said officer arrests him and sends him to jail for eight months.Upon his release he is evicted from his own property by the girlfriend who decided to dump him while he was in prison but never told him. In addition, she's decided to hang onto their dog out of sheer spite. And so Ned seeks shelter and assistance from his genuinely loving mother and his sisters who only help out of guilt and only until it becomes inconvenient for them. His sister Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a Vanity Fair journalist writing a profile on a member the royal family and half-heartedly involved with a neighbor who wants more but doesn't expect to get it. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is a bisexual ""performance artist"" living in a studio apartment with her girlfriend (Rashida Jones) and five other people. Liz (Emily Mortimer) is married to a documentary filmmaker (Steve Coogan) who shows no interest in maintaining their physical relationship and with whom she has a son who is being raised in a manner devoid of even the comic violence of The Pink Panther.As they all suffer various setbacks, the sisters seem intent on putting the blame for those setbacks on their brother despite the fact that those setbacks are the result of failings in their own character or the character of those around them. Ned is ostracized and, soon enough finds himself back in jail after revealing to his parole officer that he has violated the conditions of his release by smoking marijuana.Paul Rudd as Ned is a very endearing character. The sisters (Deschanel, Mortimer and Banks) are self-involved and less than endearing but their eventual growth and that of their relationship with Ned is enough to turn their roles in the story.

1428961,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004UXUWEC,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Our Idiot Brother' reminds me of two other films involving a passive interloper who affects the lives of a group of siblings. They are the Spanish Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film of 1994, 'Belle Epoque' and the 2001 Irish/English import, 'About Adam'. In both, a young Lothario is the catalyst for awakening the sexual impulses of various family members (in Belle Epoque, it's three sisters and in About Adam, it's three sisters and a brother).'Our Idiot Brother' is a variation on this theme. Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is by no means a Lothario, but is definitely a passive interloper who acts as a catalyst, eventually transforming the lives of his three sisters, for the good. Ned, a latter day hippie, hardly represents the spirit of Bacchus (as in the other two films), but rather a type who inspires spontaneity. The best part of 'Our idiot Brother' is Paul Rudd, who plays the likable Ned and one finds him charming and offbeat (except maybe for moments when he acts like a complete fool, allowing himself to be conned by uniformed a police officer, who convinces nave Ned to sell him some marijuana at a local market).Unfortunately, the women Ned plays off against throughout the film simply lack the charm of the film's protagonist. For starters, there's his girlfriend, Janet, who was living on a biodynamic farm at the time Ned is arrested, and when he returns, promptly shows him the door, having shacked up with another hippie type, who is just as goofy as Ned. What's worse is that Janet covets Ned's dog (whose name is 'Willie Nelson'). It's hard to like a humorless character like Janet, whose main characteristic is to be a foil to Ned, in her unrelenting pursuit of good old 'Willie'. Ned's sisters are no more likable than Ned's ex. Take for example, Liz (Emily Mortimer) who's married to Dylan, a pretty much repulsive documentary filmmaker, who Ned unwittingly exposes as a cheating philanderer. Before things break down between Liz and Dylan, Liz has trouble accepting Ned's exhortation that they treat her son River like a normal kid (the parents can't stomach Ned's promotion of 'violent' activities, such as martial arts instead of more 'cultured activities' like ballet dancing).Then there's another unpleasant sister, Miranda, a journalist, who uses Ned to obtain a gossipy personal story from a royal celebrity, who takes Ned under her wings, after she's drawn to his honesty. Ned won't betray the celebrity's confidence, and surly Miranda boots Ned out of her apartment. More unpleasantness: Cindy, the lesbian girlfriend of Ned's other sister, Natalie, who should be the most ethical of all the characters, since she's an attorney, concocts this sad plan to go with Ned, and steal his dog back from his ex-girlfriend. It gets even more unfunny, when Ned blurts out that Natalie has been having an affair with a man, much to the chagrin of Cindy, who had no idea that Natalie was bisexual.The 'dark moment' of the second Act (if there is a dark moment) is when Ned admits that he's been smoking marijuana again, to his parole officer, who's forced to arrest him. Ned doesn't want to be bailed out of jail until the sisters are able to find a way to procure Ned's beloved 'Willie Nelson', which they do, when Ned's ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, decides that giving Ned the dog, is the 'right thing to do'.Ned's good-naturedness finally pays off when Liz decides to start dating again, Miranda begins a relationship with a neighbor she was really meant for and Cindy supports Natalie, as she decides to have her baby. As for Ned, he starts a candle shop with his ex-wife's boyfriend and then meets a woman, who he instantly falls for (note that the woman's dog is named 'Dolly Parton').Our Idiot Brother's denouement unfortunately is unearned. That's because we ultimately don't find the sisters' positive transformations engaging due to not feeling invested in them earlier. Instead, the film's scenarists needed to make them more nuanced, and certainly more sympathetic, despite their shortcomings. In that way, Ned's affability and trustworthiness, would not have gone for naught.",2,Affable Paul Rudd can't save script full of such unsympathetic characters,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,4157,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Our"", 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'reminds', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'involving', 'passive', 'interloper', 'who', 'lives', 'group', 'siblings', 'are', 'Spanish', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '1994', 'Epoque', '2001', 'Irish/English', 'import', 'Adam', 'young', 'Lothario', 'catalyst', 'awakening', 'sexual', 'impulses', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'Belle', 'Epoque', 'three', 'sisters', 'About', 'Adam', 'three', 'sisters', 'brother', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'variation', 'theme', 'Ned', 'Rochlin', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Lothario', 'definitely', 'passive', 'interloper', 'who', 'catalyst', 'eventually', 'transforming', 'lives', 'three', 'sisters', 'good', 'Ned', 'latter', 'day', 'hippie', 'hardly', 'spirit', 'Bacchus', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'rather', 'type', 'who', 'spontaneity', 'best', 'part', ""'Our"", 'idiot', 'Brother', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'likable', 'Ned', 'one', 'charming', 'offbeat', 'maybe', 'moments', 'when', 'complete', 'fool', 'allowing', 'be', 'conned', 'uniformed', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'nave', 'Ned', 'sell', 'marijuana', 'local', 'market', '.Unfortunately', 'women', 'Ned', 'off', 'film', 'simply', 'lack', 'charm', 'film', 'protagonist', 'starters', 'girlfriend', 'Janet', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'biodynamic', 'farm', 'time', 'Ned', 'arrested', 'when', 'promptly', 'door', 'having', 'shacked', 'up', 'hippie', 'type', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'goofy', 'Ned', 'What', 'worse', 'Janet', 'covets', 'Ned', 'dog', 'name', ""'Willie"", 'Nelson', 'hard', 'like', 'humorless', 'character', 'Janet', 'main', 'characteristic', 'be', 'foil', 'Ned', 'unrelenting', 'pursuit', 'good', 'old', 'Ned', 'sisters', 'are', 'more', 'likable', 'Ned', 'ex', 'Take', 'example', 'Liz', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'who', 'married', 'Dylan', 'pretty', 'much', 'repulsive', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'Ned', 'unwittingly', 'cheating', 'philanderer', 'things', 'break', 'down', 'Liz', 'Dylan', 'Liz', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'Ned', 'exhortation', 'treat', 'son', 'River', 'normal', 'kid', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'Ned', 'promotion', ""'violent"", 'activities', 'such', 'martial', 'arts', 'instead', 'more', ""'cultured"", 'activities', 'ballet', 'dancing', '.Then', 'unpleasant', 'sister', 'Miranda', 'journalist', 'who', 'Ned', 'obtain', 'gossipy', 'personal', 'story', 'royal', 'celebrity', 'who', 'Ned', 'wings', 'drawn', 'honesty', 'Ned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'betray', 'celebrity', 'confidence', 'surly', 'Miranda', 'boots', 'Ned', 'apartment', 'More', 'unpleasantness', 'Cindy', 'lesbian', 'girlfriend', 'Ned', 'other', 'sister', 'Natalie', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'ethical', 'characters', 'attorney', 'sad', 'plan', 'go', 'Ned', 'steal', 'dog', 'back', 'ex-girlfriend', 'even', 'more', 'unfunny', 'when', 'Ned', 'out', 'Natalie', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Cindy', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'Natalie', 'was', 'bisexual.The', ""'dark"", 'moment', 'second', 'Act', 'dark', 'moment', 'when', 'Ned', 'been', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'again', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'forced', 'arrest', 'Ned', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bailed', 'jail', 'sisters', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'procure', 'Ned', 'beloved', ""'Willie"", 'Nelson', 'do', 'when', 'Ned', 'ex-girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'giving', 'Ned', 'dog', ""'right"", 'thing', ""do'.Ned"", 'good-naturedness', 'finally', 'off', 'when', 'Liz', 'start', 'dating', 'again', 'Miranda', 'relationship', 'neighbor', 'was', 'really', 'meant', 'Cindy', 'supports', 'Natalie', 'have', 'baby', 'Ned', 'candle', 'shop', 'ex-wife', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'woman', 'who', 'instantly', 'note', 'woman', 'dog', 'named', ""'Dolly"", 'Parton', '.Our', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'denouement', 'unfortunately', 'unearned', 'ultimately', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'sisters', 'positive', 'transformations', 'engaging', 'due', 'not', 'feeling', 'invested', 'earlier', 'Instead', 'film', 'scenarists', 'needed', 'make', 'more', 'nuanced', 'certainly', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'shortcomings', 'way', 'Ned', 'affability', 'trustworthiness', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'naught']",Our Idiot Brother

I was entertained the entire movie. Paul Rudd amazes me with how incredibly adorable and loveable he manages to be in EVERY movie in completely different characters. His childishly irresponsible, carefree hippie attitude could EASILY have been frustratingly annoying but managed to be sweet and quirky instead. Some of the funniest scenes were between Paul Rudd and his hippie ex-girlfriend; ""Stop the violence, man! You're making me raise my voice!""The characters were superb, from Elizabeth Banks as the driven, high-maintenance, bossy sister, to Emily Mortimer as the sweet, mousey, loving mommy-sister, to Zooey Deschanel as the wild, carefree, experimental sister with growing up to do. All of the characters (including Paul Rudd's) manage to grow throughout the movie. The only character who was a bit vague was Paul Rudd's mother played by Shirley Knight, an actress I love and therefore wanted to see more of.This was definitely intended as a sweet, quirky, feel-good comedy and pulled it off quite well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The movie could probably have been PG-13 in my opinion. There is probably the one 3-some scene that pushed it into R but that was definitely one of the funniest scenes of the movie and nothing ""bad.""
