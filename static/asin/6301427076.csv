252494,A6HZN83OUPYRN,6301427076,976-ERIC,"[0, 1]","This is somewhat of an important horror film, atleast for me, that has been forgotten or maligned over time. When it came out, all of the popular horror movies were hack and slash/dead teenager/empty boogey men tales. Stephen King adaptations helped put the humanity back in horror, even if the films didn't always do his books justice (The Shining, Children of the Corn).This was the first one to really strike a cord since Carrie. There are no heroes here and no real villians either. No starry-eyed buxom brunette or burly square-jawed male is triumphant in the end. No silent intense man-monster ""gets it."" In fact it doesn't end happily at all. Something of a rarity in popular horror at the time.Also rare is that all the performances are 1st rate as is the music (wonderfully haunting and sentimental at turns). The lighting of the movie is documentary-like, giving the film a realism and naturalism lost in today's underlit, over-stylized gore-fests. It also makes the shift from family drama to zombie tale feel all the more startlingly believable.Though underdeveloped and slightly rushed (what you thought Paramount, then home of ""Friday the 13th,"" would produce a 2.5 hr character drama about a man terrorized by his dead family?) this movie is a fast-paced horror-tragedy with real heart in its story and performance and direction. A rarity in Hollywood then and now too.Favorite quote from the film:  ""Lie down. Play dead.

252496,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,6301427076,Aaron M.,"[10, 11]","It was 1989. I was 14 and I thought that Pet Sematary was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. It hasn't aged well. Or rather, I have aged out of it. Upon a recent viewing I came to the unsettling conclusion that this film, despite its horrific subject matter, is basically aimed at a young audience; intentionally or not.Most of the problem is with King's screenplay. Whatever literary strengths he has, they do not translate to film. (Maximum Overdrive...nuff said) It seems that King has very little respect for film goers. He seems to have some respect for film as a medium, but the viewers themselves he writes down to. Look at The Shining, for instance. For years King complained about and trashed Kubrick's classic adaptation. Then King himself finally remade The Shining and he removed all subtlety, crafting a sappy TV mini-series that pandered rather than entertained. Perhaps King likes bad film adaptations, lest a superior film overshadows his work, as is the case with Kubrick's The Shining IMO.His screenplay for Pet Sematary is up to the same tricks. King does not bother with characterization, he just shoehorns in the books most horrific scenes and pumps them up in some cases (Victor Pascow being the worst offense, he appears once or twice in the book, but in the film the guy is all over the place, doing some sort of stand up comic zombie routine that gets old quick.) He just sort of hopes that characterization will be implied I guess. He also worked in the ""spring loaded cat"" jump scare several times. You can't disrespect an audiences intelligence much more than that.The worst part is that none of it makes very much sense. In the book, King went to great lengths to make you believe in his story and it works. Here, King just seems to be shoveling out the story as fast as he can, making story revisions and additions that have no logic in and of themselves and that contaminate the internal logic of the parts of the story that should work. Again, the Pascow angle is the main offender here. In the book he gives a simple warning. It's up to Louis Creed to make the decisions. In the film Pascow becomes an active force that just screws everything up worse with his meddling as he keeps coming back to help out and only ends up helping out the evil force in the MicMac burial ground.  Not a very good result for an emissary send from beyond the grave by ""higher forces"". This is just one example of how little sense the film makes, I could go on for pages and pages. It seems King had his brain turned off while churning out this screenplay. Gone are all of the weighty themes the book explored, only to be replaced by thoughtless illogical attempts to pump up the opportunity to show more ghosts and guts and blood.King has said that he does not like Pet Sematary as a book. I guess that's understandable. King is, at heart, an optimist. Pet Sematary was his one foray into real pessimistic horror. Perhaps he just felt like turning it into a big joke on those grounds.I don't have anything bad to say about director Mary Lambert. She did a damn good job considering the screenplay she was working from. In King's original screenplay King tried to rework Jud's character. He wore trendy clothing and listened to the latest rock music on his walkman...you know, so the kids would think how cool this old guy was. Well, if Mary had anything to do with excising that particular bit of cynical pandering...then more points to her. When Stephen King comes along with his own screenplay, and it's a cartoony carnival spook show...well I suppose as a director you give him what you think he wants. Unless you want to end up like Kubrick, listening to this writer whine and complain about you for the rest of either of your natural lives.The acting here is adequate. Fred Gwynne steals the show, and is largely the only thing that holds it all together. Dale Midkiff does some wonderful round the bend acting towards the finale. Brad Greenquist is having (too much} fun playing the ghost of Pascow, but for what it is its good acting. The only actor who truly made me feel emotion though was Michael Lombard as Rachel Creed's father. I guess he didn't get the memo that this was all goofy fun because his heartbreak at Gage's funeral is keenly felt. Too bad the rest of them didn't miss the memo as well. In short, the actors did what they were asked to do and they did it well for the most part. No real complaints. Unless you're just a jerk that likes to pick on child actors and the like.Pet Sematary does have a lot going for it though. For one, it's original. Ok not totally original, you will still hear people saying King ripped off his book from a film called Zeder. A movie you've probably never even heard of (and I doubt King had either when he wrote the story) so it's original enough. Especially for the well worn cliches of the endlessly recycled horror genre. It's also very dark. Even with the cartoony gloss smeared all over the film, it's still considered morbid, mean-spirited, bleak, and nihilistic. I don't consider these bad things, especially for the horror genre, except maybe the charge of mean-spiritedness...which does hold some weight. The film does seem to lack a heart...perhaps of any kind, mean-spirited or otherwise.Perhaps it had to be this way. 1989 was not likely to be a good year for any mainstream film to be so dark and realistic at the same time. Without suppressing the realism it may have been just too much to remain mainstream, which it pretty much had to be considering it was a King vehicle. Mr King is Hollywood's dependable horror whore after-all. No sense making a film with artistic merit that might lower the profit margin.It's unfortunate, because if it had been allowed to show the same sort of realism that, say, William Friedkin had brought to The Exorcist, this very well may have become a horror classic for the ages, instead of just another (above average) goofy 80's carnival gore show.",3,Sometimes...writers keeping their hands off of

I have to concur with many of the reviewers about the Zelda character (who was incidentally played by a man named Andrew Hubatsek). There's something so phenomenally horrifying about that character to me that I can actually say I have trouble watching the movie, and certainly never again alone.

The flashbacks of Timmy Baderman (sp?) are also scary.Furthermore, I agree with many of you that this is a different experience from the book, which I also recommend for added terror.

As a character actor, the man had no peers, and his work in this scary flick makes it an instant classic!There have been surprisingly many negative reviews of this film, but I just don't see why. When I watch a film, I kick back and let the film take over. It seems as though too many folks are busy dissecting films (leave that to the critics), rather than getting absorbed by them.Pet Sematary draws in the viewer with a deceptively simple story,  then keeps on tugging at your nerves with one engaging scene after another. While mildly predictable, it is the overall presentation of this film that makes it worthwhile. The whole cast is very good, along with the photography, and lighting. This film is a cult classic for good reason!Pet Sematary is prime Stephen King. This film is a unique and entertaining horror/science fiction trip into the hell that IS evil. Even in mortal terms, we don't understand it,and we don't  understand life after death either.

Pearson ""West Coast Ranter""","[14, 19]","I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered ""scary"" is with the cheap haunted-house ""BOO!"" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning.

Mesa,"[2, 2]","The haunting and chilling effects of this film were far more effective in the theatre when it was released about 10 years ago.However,simple and typical scare techniques or tactics seem to work quite effectively making any viewer jump seeing the dvd version (hint: you never know where that darn cat named Church is going to appear)! There are quite a few questions that are hard to ignore such as why on the blue planet would any parent let their children play ,let alone lose track of them,near a busy highway used for delivery trucks and 18 wheeler rigs going at 100 mph ? Also, you would think the father,Louis Creed, would learn his lesson after burying the family cat in a cemetery with &quot;sour soil&quot;. Despite these little story anomolies it is the contrasting cinematography and setting that really compels;There are beautiful sunny blue skies over the Creed family's home during the day, and then the dark and ominous fog infested cemetery and neighbor Jud Crandall's creepy house at night. Each character's flashback of a painful time in their lives or the reminiscing of the horrors and doomed consequences of using the Mic -Mac burial ground intensify the predominantly evil effect &quot;it&quot; has on it's nearby &quot;living&quot; neighbors. While the lead characters (actors Denise Crosby and Dale Midkiff) sometimes appear wooden (until Midkiff's character goes loony), it's the melo-dramatic and quirky presence of actor Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster) that sometimes steals the show. Also, the child actor portraying little Gage Creed was an excellent choice.

After reading the reviews by others, I am surprised some found it a very, very scary movie to watch. Oh really...scary? Really scary? Perhaps they are still afraid of A.L.F. to this day. Anyway, can somebody come up with better material than the junk in Pet Sematary? I was literally waiting for a story to come but never did. The film is just an exercise of idiocy. It's as common sense as it gets. First of all, don't move to a house where the road in front of it is a traffic of fast speeding trucks. Do some research before you move in. Duh! Second of all, if you are going to move in there, then at least fence the area around to protect the kids. Third of all, while you are at it, keep the damn cat inside of the house and never let it out. It's not so hard, is it? As a matter of fact, if this occurred, then none of the rest of events would have happened. It's just stupid...stupid...stupid! Stupid...stupid...stupid minds at work! Fourth of all, if the cat is dead and nobody but the girl cares about it, then why bother bringing it back from dead? Just admit the truth and get another cat. Or better yet, don't get another pet ever again! Fifth of all, for a Medical Doctor, Louis Creed sure doesn't act like it. He keeps getting a heart attack whenever the cat keeps jumping out of nowhere. So...wimp! Moreover, he has a problem dealing with cadavers. How surprising. Also, for a supposedly busy Medical Doctor, he sure got a lot of free time on his hands. Now, how about that wife? What a frigid woman. I can imagine what Denise Crosby was thinking when she was little....""Oh, one day, I will be an actress and do an important film."" Yeah, great career decision...now, go and play with a yo-yo. Sixth of all, if a baby gets hit by a truck, better bring a lawsuit to the company, but don't be so stupid to get in the truck for a ride after hitchhiking. Finally, we come to the worst part of the film: Blaze Berdahl. Somebody, throw the annoying girl in the middle of the road, so she can get hit by a truck. How about that performance by Stephen King? Can't even play a priest if his life depended on it. Let me get this straight. If the baby does in fact return from dead and acts normally, how is Louis going to explain this one? Yeah, I thought so. Better have the explanation ready for burning up Jud and the baby's bodies because the bones are going to remain there no matter what, and it was purely a work of arson.

252512,A2YAABMT80RLYA,6301427076,Ben Rowland,"[5, 10]","&quot;Pet Sematary&quot; affirms the fact that, while being a good novelist, Stephen King is a terrible screenwriter. He once complained that Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; was an injustice to his book, but I watched &quot;Pet Sematatry&quot; with that exact thought in mind. I loved the book, and have read it many times. The movie does it no justice.Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff), his wife (Denise Crosby), their two children, and their cat Church move to the country to start their lives anew. They meet their new neighbor, Jud Crandal (Fred Gwynne), and learn about a path in their back yard that leads to an animal graveyard and an indian burial ground beyond it. The road outside their house is a danger in itself, with big rig trucks passing by all day and all night. When their cat church is killed on the road, Louis is introduced to the power of the indian burial ground, which has the power to bring the dead back to life. When tragedy strikes later on, the powers of the burial ground tear the family apart, and lead to violent ends.The movie has it's share of creepy, and bloody moments, but they come nowhere near matching the potentcy of the book. For someone who has not read the book, this is probably a good horror movie, but for people like me, it is a waste of time. The movie follows the key points in the book, but omits a lot of the good stuff, making the movie seem disgustingly unfaithful. While the book introduced characters that were believeable, and people we could sympathize with, the way they are painted in the movie is one-dimensional and totally uninteresting. The actors involved seem to play their parts in their sleep, as if the movie were rehearsed once, and they trusted their luck.The widescreen transfer and good picture quality aside, there are no extra features that come with this DVD.

The highlight of this movie is the playful yet creepy ghost[The one on the cover] who huants Mr. Creed, telling him that a line has been crossed. The scariest part of this movie is the late sister Zelda of Mrs. Creed, who's face and body have been horribly disfigured as she screams out in evil pain.This movie is one that you may not like at all, or may even take offense to it, but it deals with the lines between life and death and brings suspense and fear to you.

I found the movie version entertaining, but not quite as frightening. I liked Denise Crosby as Mrs. Creed, and the kids were good. Dad was okay as well. Fred Gwynne made a decent Jud Crandel too. I guess I just wanted to be scared $#!tless again! Really, the only complaint I have about the movie is the showing of the resurrected Gage. Seeing his baby face made things far less terrifying than just showing his back, or a hand (like when the hand came from under the bed) or his shadow running past. Anyway, PET SEMATARY had it's moments. Zelda was suitably creepy, as she lurched about wheezing and cackling. The kitty that played Church was great!

252516,A3BN8S0FFHK3XC,6301427076,Brett Michael  Roberts,"[1, 1]","When on a trip to Hawaii, I read the novel &quot;Pet Semetary&quot; inthree days.  I was hooked.  The book was covered with unrelenting suspense and scares, and shocks, I couldn't stop!  I hadn't seen the movie, and I planned to after I finished the novel.  Well, maybe if I'd not read the book, the movie would have been better to me.  There's lots of little sub-plots in the book that are completely ignored in the movie.  For one, where is Norma Crandall, Jud's sick wife whom is saved on Halloween night from a heart attack by Louis Creed?  She is absent in the film.  She doesn't exist, and she's never mentioned.  To bad.  Lots of other sub-plots are avoided.  I don't expect a movie to have every single thing that the novel had... but still, this one left out WAY to much.  Also (MAJOR SPOILER!) after Gage gets hit by a truck, Louis decides to dig him up.  In the novel, this took ten or fifteen pages of Louis trying to climb over a very tall gate and getting cut, stabbed, all sorts of things, while trying not to get caught by the police.  This was a scary, suspensful part of the novel.  But, in the movie, the gates about three feet high and Louis just has to walk over it!  (END OF THE SPOILER)  Most of the actors in this were wooden, with the exception of Fred Gwynne as Jud and Miko Hughes (Kindergarden Cop, Spawn, Appolo 13, Wes Craven's New Nightmare).  I have to say, Hughes deserves an oscar or something for his many performances (take that Haley Joel Osment!  You can't even act!).  (MORE SPOILERS!)  It's pretty dificult to, at the age of two or three, play a zombie killer that cuts old men up and eats their neck.  Sure, thi scenes are pretty darn sickening, but they're so scary!  I think Dale Midkiff did pretty bad until the end when you saw he was going loony.  The movie's not epic or anything, but I still feel if someone would just watch it, they'd see that Miko Hughes deserves an oscar for his hard performance.  He was also great in Wes Craven's New Nightmare.  (END SPOILER) Anyway, whenever you read a book, you get your own ideas of what characters look like.  I though Tom Atkins would make a fine Louis Creed, and his wife was NOT Denise Crosby, but more like Lisa Zane.  The girl who played Ellie couldn't act at all, and when she cried she sounded more funny than sad.  Zelda (Rachel's sick sister from her flashbacks) WAS scary until I found out it was a man and couldn't stop laughing (he does look rather mannish in some scenes, particularly the &quot;Never get out of bed again&quot; scene).The DVD's pretty much featurless, aside from a widescreen transfer.  Big dissipointment.All in all, Pet Semetary is a good rainy day movie, and I'm very sorry if I didn't give much detail into the movie.

This film is, by far, Stephen King's scariest film of all.LOUIS CREED (played by the brilliant Dale Midkiff) has just moved into a beautiful new house with his wife, RACHEL (played by Denise Crosby, looking sexy as ever), and their children, ELLIE (played by Blaze & Beau Berdahl) & GAGE (played by Miko Hughs). While Louis and Rachel are tending to Ellie, who has just fell of a tire swing, Gage is standing by the road, where an Orinco truck comes by, and nearly splashes Gage into a bloody mess. But in one quick movement, JUD CRANDEL (played by Fred Gwyne), the Creed's new kindly old neighbor, comes to the rescue. From that point on the Creed's and Jud assume a great friendship.That night, Louis stops by Jud's, where the two sit together and have a beer. At that moment, Jud tells Louis of the path that Rachel had mentioned to Jud. The path behind the Creed's house was put there for a reason: the Orinco trucks that run back and forth all day and night. The path leads to a place called PET CEMETERY, for those Orinco trucks use up a lot of animals, making children very unhappy.The next afternoon, Jud takes the Creed's to the place. The reach the cemetery, where it reads PET SEMATARY, being misspelled, since the place was built by brokenhearted children.The next morning, Louis goes off to work, but not before he take Ellie's cat, WINSTON CHURCHHILL (whom, they call CHURCH for short) to be fixed. Louis' new job is the college doctor, which is why he and the family moved in the first place. On his first day, Louis found out that he was in over his head, for a young man named VICTOR PASCOW (played by Brad Greenquist) has just been hit by an Orinco truck while going out for a morning jog with his friends. Victor is, obviously, dead, since the truck pretty much, ripped the side of his head off, spilling his brains...pretty much everywhere. As Louis sits with Victor's dead body, Victor suddenly comes to life and says to Louis, ""The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis"". Louis asks how he knew his name, to which, Victor adds, ""I'll come to you"", and then dies for good.That night, Victor kept his word by appearing to Louis, where he takes him to the pet cemetery. He explains to Louis, who still thinks this is a dream, that this pet cemetery is the place where the dead speak, to which, he tells Louis not to go on to the place where the dead walk, where he points to a direction beyond the pet cemetery.While Rachel, Ellie, and Gage go off to Chicago to celebrate Thanksgiving with Rachel's parents (without Louis, since Rachel's father dislikes Louis), Jud informs Louis that Ellie's cat, Church, is on his front lawn...dead. Louis holds back on telling Ellie, while he figures where to bury the cat. Jud and Louis head to the pet cemetary, where Louis is thinking he'll be buring Church here. But Jud informs Louis that the cemetery they'll be going to is beyond the pet cemetery. They reach another location beyond the pet cemetary. This place is known as the Micmac Indian Burial Ground. Jud has brought Louis here to bury Ellie's cat, where he informs Louis that he would like to help, but each has to bury his own.The next morning, after raking up some leaves, Louis heads into the garage, where he finds Church, who evily growls at Louis, scaring the hell out of Louis. He and Jud discuss Church being alive, when Louis has known for sure that Church was dead. The Micmac Burial is an ancient Burial ground with the powers of resurrection. But those powers are differet. What or who you bury there comes back. They may look like what or who you buried there. They may sound like what or who you buried there. But, they are not who or what you buried there. Jud tells Louis of what happened to his dog, Spot, where his dog had died after being caught in barbed wire. Jud buried him up there in the Micmac grounds, where Spot came back evil, which led Jud to put Spot down again, where he's now in the pet sematary. Louis asks if anyone has ever buried a person up there, where Jud, scared of the question, exclaims no.The next afternoon, Rachel, Gage, and Ellie arrive home, with Louis picking them up. The next morning, it is found that, MISSY DANDRIDGE (played by Susan Blommaert), the housemaid for the Creed's, has killed herself. Rachel has missed out on her funeral, where she explains to Louis why she has a problem with death. Rachel had an older sister named ZELDA (played by Andrew Hubetsek, since they couldn't find a woman skinny enough for the part), who had died, due to Spinal Meningitis. Rachel was terrified of her sister, where she then explains that Rachel was left alone with Zelda when Zelda had finally died, after choking and then going into a convulsion.The next afternoon, the Creed's and Jud have a little picknic in their backyard, where they experience a severe and saddened tragedy: Gage, their adorable 18-month-old little boy, was hit by an Orinco truck.The night of the funeral, Jud informs Louis that he knows what Louis is thinking: That Louis wants to bury Gage in the Micmac grounds. Jud tells Louis that it's best not thought of, where he informs Louis that he lied when he was asked anyone was buried in the Micman. A young man named Timmy Baterman was buried up their by his father, when Timmy was killed while on his way home from the second World War. The micmac grounds had brought back Timmy, but with the thirst to kill, which is why Jud and a couple friends put him to rest...for good.After sending Rachel and Ellie off to Chicago with Rachel's parents, Louis stays behind and does what Jud told him not to...To bury Gage at the micmac grounds. Victor appears again and tries to stop Louis, but Louis is so grief-strucken, he buries Gage up there anyway, while Rachel, after hearing Ellie's dreams, travels back to Ludlow, leaving Ellie in the care of her parents, to stop Louis.While Rachel is on her way, Gage is resurrected, where he graphically kills Jud. Rachel finally arrives, and is about to go inside her house, where Louis is sound asleep. But she hears someone call her name from inside Jud's house. She enters Jud's house, and enters Jud's bedroom, where she sees the apparition of her sister, Zelda, which turns into Gage. Rachel looks down at Gage, so relieved to see him again since his death. As she bends down to pick him up, Gage kills his own mother.The next morning, Louis gets a phone call from Gage, who is still at Jud's. He gather's some poison, where he kills Church off once and for all. And then heads over to Jud's house, where he discovers Jud's dead body, and then finds...Rachel's dead body. He battles it out with his evil son, where he then poison's his son, through some tears. He sets the hosue on fire, and carries Rachel off to bury her in the Micmac grounds. Victor tries to stop him, but Louis thinks that because he waited too long with Gage, Gage came back evil. But Rachel has just died, so he assumes it'll work this time.That night, Louis sits in the living room, awaiting Rachel's return. She comes into the kitchen, all grotesque, where she and Louis kiss. As they kiss, she picks up a knife and kills Louis.Now, I had seen this movie for the first time when I was four-years-old (which was when the movie first came out back in 1989). When I first saw this film, I remember I had only gotten scared when Rachel came back from the dead. But after seeing it a second time back in the summer of 2000, I was literally scared to death of the whole film, especially seeing Rachel's sister, Zelda. Zelda had given me nightmares not to be believed. I still can't watch this movie without being scared to death. But the film is excellent. Yes, it is extremely scary (with extremely disturbing images), but the film is awesome. I will say that the film did the book an extreme amount of justice, for when I had read the book, I could not put it down. This is a film no one should miss.",5,Pet Sematary (1989),1071446400,"12 15, 2003",2003,8133,"['Director', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'who', 'directed', 'many', 'Madonna', 'music', 'videos', 'had', 'come',

Yeah: you gotta pack it up Ritz-Carlton style in a garbage bag, and bury it in the hardscrabble soil of your friendly neighborhood Indian burial ground as the Moon rides wild and high in the inky black New England sky.Or, in other words, when the Cat has Nine Lives plus---well, let's just call it a 'do-over'.Only, well, the Cat that comes back pawing at the door and hungry for some really tender vittles---well, Kitty ain't exactly the sweet little furball he used to be.""Pet Sematary"" is one of the freakiest, most disturbing pieces of cinematic grue ever committed to celluloid, a rare wonder of malevolent glee, a potent, deadly nightshade concoction of lunar wonder guaranteed to provide years and years of night terrors.It is an amazing little masterpiece of primal terror, of oh-my-god-something-just-snuffled-under-my-bed sort of horror, and it's even more remarkable that this little nugget of pure evil was conjured up by Mary Lambert, who prior to midwifing this giggling abomination had nothing more than 'videographer' on her resume, and ever since---prhaps out of pure creative exhaustion---has done nothing of note.Giving birth to the Spawn of Hell can have that effect on a girl.Oh, and it's got a moral, did I mention that?The moral of the story: never bury the very dead grey tomcat Church, your daughter's little darling, the big furry kitty-cat that nuzzled lovingly by her throat and guarded her sleep 'til morning---never bury the family cat in the haunted Indian burial ground.Unless you want the damned thing to come back. And you know, when you get right down to it, when you add up the credits on one side and the grave-stinking debits on the other: well, old Hoss, you start to think Louis Creed's Yankee neighbor Jud might be on to something when he drawls ""sometimes Dead is better"".Or, at any rate, has better table manners.Anyway, Louis Creed (the super-duper-cinematic Dale Midkiff, who may not be the world's best actor but really does get into his part with relish, ultimately doing grief-stricken-batsh*t-crazy pretty damned well) and his adorable family move to rural Maine.Initially there is little to trouble the Family Creed: plummy wife Rachel (Denise Crosby, who deep-sixed Star Trek to, ya know, expand her horizons and sh*t), kitty-loving daughter Ellie, and cute little munchkin Gage (adorable little Miko Hughes, who ultimately gives the phrase ""Terrible Twos"" a whole new meaning). Well, unless you count the fleet of semi-trucks and tankers that roar back and forth about 3 inches from the doorstep. Oh, and the haunted Indian burial-ground in the backyard.But let's stop dithering: you bury something in the ""Special Ed"" section of the Pet Semetary, something you loved, and cuddled, and called Puppy-Wuppy or whatever, and it comes back. Changed, yeah, and maybe it smells funny, maybe it has a hankering to try out a chunk of your calf, but Hell, it's back. What are you, some kind of ungrateful schlepp?So Church gets smooshed, and Jud and Louis, alone and smashed out of their skulls, decide it's a great idea to bury it in the Indian graveyard. And then adorable little Gage does a walkabout out into the road at about the same time one of those rampaging semis come thundering by and---well, two strikes doesn't put you out, does it?You get the idea. Anyway, Mary Lambert gave birth to a horror film that is gorgeous, and frightful, and deeply, richly, ghoulishly disturbing: I'll still be seeing that hamstringing seen on my deathbed, and let's not even talk about the sister in the attic with some kind of George Romero super-zombie Spinal Meningitis.Add to this the---uh, architectural ""changes"" Gage wreaks on Jud's house, or the homely little elegies on the Homecoming of Jud's Dog and little Timmy Baterman, back home from the Big One, out of his coffin, and already chewing on a little tibula from the local boneyard. Brrr.The ultimate infernal, sick glory of ""Pet Semetary"" is that it happily loads up the gas cans and burns the whole house down: colossal, mind-shattering horror builds upon horror, until the whole ghastly thing is almost hysterical, makes you want to giggle insanely and roll into a fetal position. Until you realize the significance of those little muddy tracks leading from the kitchen side-door to the bedroom, and to daddy's doctor bag.You know, the doctor bag with the scalpel, and, maybe, the syringe.Sometimes Dead *is* better.JSG",5,The Cat came Back,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,5059,"['Cat', 'came', 'Back', 'January', '29', '2006Reviewer', 'James', 'Stephen', 'Garrett', 'Teep',

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","I can rattle off a considerable number of Stephen King novels turned movies that are hopeless exercises of mundane mediocrity.  Yet I happily exclude PET SEMATARY from this infamous list.  I first caught this macabre skin crawler shortly following its theatrical release, then I recently came across it on the flat screen (thank you, cable), and gave it another gander.  I'm still shuddering.Here we have a film not only with deeply disturbing images--we have a film with a gruesome premise akin to nine-inch nails scraping across a fresh blackboard.  The Creed family, newcomers to rural Maine, happen to live near an ancient burial ground--land cursed and contaminated, yet still powerful enough to seduce the grief-stricken to bury their dead inside, because, according to folklore, those buried there come back from the dead.  There is, of course, one caveat:  the dead come back as evil incarnate; but hey, a small price to pay for having a loved one come back home, right?Unbeknownst to the rest of the Creed clan, the father, Louis, buries Church, the pet cat, in the burial ground following Church's unfortunate encounter with a truck along a nearby rural highway.  Church does come back--only he's anything but his lovable feline self.  So we all know what's coming next when Gage, barely a toddler, also wonders out on that dangerous highway and meets his tragic demise; Louis, overcome with grief, and upon his wife and daughter's departure to spend time with his in-laws, retrieves his son's body from the local cemetery and transports him to the burial ground.  The little boy also returns from the grave, with grisly, disturbing, and unnerving consequences.  Yet in spite of this unspeakable brutality, one more member of the Creed family will be buried in the PET SEMATARY as the film moves to its macabre conclusion.This is what a horror yarn is all about, and PET SEMATARY doesn't disappoint.  The cast itself is anything but memorable, with the exception of notable guild veteran Fred Gwynne as Jud, a neighbor who takes the Creed family under his paternal wing, and a very young Miko Hughes as the small boy Gage.  How director Mary Lambert got such a small child to act so malevolently insidious is an absolute wonder.  Finally, one would be remiss without calling attention to deformed and demented Zelda, Rachel Creed's sister and the predicate of Rachel's childhood flashbacks.  I've since learned Zelda was played by a man because the filmmakers couldn't find a female actor thin enough for the character's disease-ravaged body.  Like I said before, I'm still shuddering.--D.

(And she readily admits that King loved her because she was close friends with The Ramones ... I respect her for that!!) She took great pains in finding the perfect house (she searched all summer for it), the perfect tree (she had that HUGE tree extricated from somewhere entirely different and planted in front of the yellow house!!), even the perfect cat (there are seven that 'play' Church ... one that excels at scratching, one at jumping, etc..). She attended to every detail with passion. Most importantly, I truly respect her choice with Gage's character. Lambert could have presented the undead Gage as grotesquely mutilated. Instead, she opted for something much more horrific: undead, unclean Gage as reanimated by Louis hubris ... with his cherubic (now daemonic) face intact. It is potent. Likewise, her choice of costume for his undead character was spot-on (and highly controversial). The dress echoes the painting in the Goldman's home and conjures a staggering sense of Freud's definition of ""the uncanny."" Oddly enough, even though Lambert had to fight for this choice (and King backed her entirely), it is one of the most frightening aspects of the film!!As many of you may know, ""Pet Sematary"" was the one novel that King wrote (in 1979) and then hid away for fear of unleashing it dark contents. The text (based on a near-death experience with his own child) frightened Stephen and Tabitha so badly that they deemed it better to keep in a drawer. Only as a result of contractual obligation was it published in 1983. To this date, it is King's pinnacle of genuine horror.Lambert's Director's Commentary makes this a must-have for horror-film scholars everywhere!! Her interpretation of Jud Crandall and Victor Pascow's roles are a bit unusual ... so listen to her explanation of how she shot these two characters, then watch the film with this in mind.To this day, people ask Romero what he would alter about the film. His response is: ""I would have done it BETTER."" Still, I think Lambert did an excellent job of bringing King's masterwork to life. I loved it when I saw it opening day ... and I love it even still today.I see that Paramount Pictures has a remake scheduled for 2008. I cannot help but to worry ... the director (as of yet, unknown) has a tough battle to create a more earth-shattering piece.Suggested Readings:Mackenthun, Gesa. ""Haunted Real Estate.""

But if you want to be VERY scared and disturbed, rent PET SEMATARY on a dark and stormy night.  I assure you, you won't be disappointed!  It's about the Creed family, who have just moved to Ludlow, Maine and to their beautiful new home.  On their first day of arrival, their kindly old neighbor Jud Crandall comes over and introduces himself after he saves Gage, their youngest son, from getting hit by a truck.  Jud talks of a path behind their house, which he says leads to a pet &quot;sematary.&quot;  Even though Jud knows there is something else beyond the pet &quot;sematary,&quot; he does not show it to them.  But, he does show it to Louis when his daughter's cat get run over in the road by a truck.  It's a Native American Burial Ground that brings the dead back to life.  After buring the cat there, Louis is amazed to see him alive and kickin' the next day, and also stinking of an unearthly stench.

When I first saw Jaws; Petrified. Would not go swimming. When I first saw The Thing; FREAKED OUT!! What the heck was that? When I first saw The Shining; had trouble entering a bathroom (don't go there). High Tension; very.....tense, really. Pet Sematary; um, won't go to the pet Cemetery again?I really had to think hard why this movie did not scare me or entertain me very much. The only reason I can come up with is that this movie took itself too seriously for its premise. A burial ground that brings people and pets to life? Why? What makes this ground what it is? It's NOT the pet cemetery! I usually don't have a problem with ridiculous premises in horror films. I would not like as many as I do otherwise. But I think this is only a small part of what put me off with this film.So many things have to happen for this story to work that it defies logic and probability (fantasy elements not withstanding). Why would they buy THAT HOUSE? A little research would sway any potential buyers from buying a house near ""THAT ROAD""! Why would Herman Munster even reveal his terrible secrets let alone suggest it as an option, having such a disturbing history with the place. Why is the laundry woman even in the film? She has zip, zero, zilch to do with anything! How can you NOT WATCH YOUR KIDS WITH ""THAT ROAD"" NEARBY?! A guardian gore-angel who breaks the rules (i.e.; ""This is the last time I can help"" and 10 minutes later he's at it again.) With all of these ridiculously convenient elements in place, how could tragedy not ensue? I think I could have played along had they not presented this in such a serious and reverent way. Silly premise, silly ignored caveats, why not silly approach? I guess it would not have scared some people then.Well, I did give it 3 stars so I must think there are some redeeming qualities, right? Sure, the production values are top-rate. The story is cohesive (despite the laundry woman). The acting was OK (not great, but I really liked Fred Gwynne). Really, other than some silly special effects (zombie kid, which I found hilarious) there is not much technically to complain about. It is entertaining if you've got nothing better to do. It definitely takes a long time to get going. Way too much character development (the laundry woman?). Some unnecessary, but appreciated gore. Some horror clich&eacute;s that work (who's not afraid of ""under the bed"").My over all feel for this film is that its' setup is too long and ridiculous to take seriously for a film that takes itself too seriously. It builds itself up as a serious horror film and then cops out with cheap gore (appreciated) and an almost comedic gross-out ending. Very uneven.The DVD is not much to get excited about either. Very long pieces concerning Stephen King, whom I am becoming less interested in with each film I watch (Shining being the exception). Some OK interviews and the like. If your a King fan you will like this stuff. I was slightly entertained but did not find it very scary and was disappointed in the end.Can't recommend it unless you're a big fan of Stephen King films or are scared easily and you enjoy it.",3,"Seriously Silly,  Not so scary nonsense I couldn't buy into",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,3231,"['So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'scary', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'becoming', 'little', 'hard', 'scare', 'old', 'age', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Jaws', 'Petrified', 'Would', 'not', 'go', 'swimming', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Thing', 'FREAKED', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Shining', 'had', 'trouble', 'entering', 'bathroom', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'High', 'Tension', 'very', '..tense', 'really', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'um', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'pet', 'Cemetery', 'again', 'really', 'had', 'think', 'hard', 'why', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'scare', 'entertain', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'movie', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'premise', 'burial', 'ground', 'people', 'pets', 'life', 'Why', 'What', 'ground', 'what', 'NOT', 'pet', 'cemetery', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'ridiculous', 'premises', 'horror', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'as', 'many', 'do', 'otherwise', 'think', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'put', 'off', 'film.So', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'happen', 'story', 'work', 'logic', 'probability', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'not', 'withstanding', 'Why', 'would', 'buy', 'THAT', 'HOUSE', 'little', 'research', 'would', 'sway', 'potential', 'buyers', 'buying', 'house', 'ROAD', 'Why', 'would', 'Herman', 'Munster', 'even', 'reveal', 'terrible', 'secrets', 'let', 'alone', 'suggest', 'option', 'having', 'such', 'disturbing', 'history', 'place', 'Why', 'laundry', 'woman', 'even', 'film', 'zip', 'zero', 'zilch', 'do', 'anything', 'How', 'can', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'YOUR', 'KIDS', 'WITH', 'ROAD', 'NEARBY', 'guardian', 'gore-angel', 'who', 'rules', 'i.e', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'help', '10', 'minutes', 'later', 'again', 'ridiculously', 'convenient', 'elements', 'place', 'how', 'could', 'tragedy', 'not', 'ensue', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'along', 'had', 'not', 'presented', 'such', 'serious', 'reverent', 'way', 'Silly', 'premise', 'silly', 'ignored', 'caveats', 'why', 'not', 'silly', 'approach', 'guess', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'scared', 'people', 'then.Well', 'did', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'so', 'must', 'think', 'are', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'right', 'Sure', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'top-rate', 'story', 'cohesive', 'laundry', 'woman', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'not', 'great', 'really', 'liked', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Really', 'other', 'silly', 'special', 'effects', 'zombie', 'kid', 'found', 'hilarious', 'not', 'much', 'technically', 'complain', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'definitely', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'laundry', 'woman', 'unnecessary', 'appreciated', 'gore', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'work', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'bed', 'feel', 'film', 'setup', 'too', 'long', 'ridiculous', 'take', 'seriously', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'up', 'serious', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'out', 'cheap', 'gore', 'appreciated', 'almost', 'comedic', 'gross-out', 'ending', 'Very', 'uneven.The', 'DVD', 'not', 'much', 'get', 'excited', 'Very', 'long', 'pieces', 'concerning', 'Stephen', 'King', 'whom', 'am', 'becoming', 'less', 'interested', 'film', 'watch', 'Shining', 'being', 'exception', 'OK', 'interviews', 'like', 'King', 'fan', 'will', 'like', 'stuff', 'was', 'slightly', 'entertained', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'scary', 'was', 'disappointed', 'end.Ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'films', 'are', 'scared', 'easily', 'enjoy']",N/A

However, in this movie, I could understand why this father made the decision that he did.  People can't think clearly while they're grieving and so, I sympathized with his pain.

There's one scene where the little boy attacks someone and, everytime I see that scene, it makes me cringe because it looks so painful.

But Pet Sematary is just like a horror spoof. I thought it was a joke on first impression, but the film was actuallysupposed to be serious. The first bad thing that I noticed about this film, was the terrible acting. Actors react to stuff in such an unprofessional way. Especially Dale Midkiffas Louis Creed who looks constapated half the time and that old guy from The Munsters TV show.The horror in this film is very weak. With cheap costumes and even cheaper make up effects, its like almost watching a series of Goosebumps. Nothing is even remotely scary, suspenceful or tence in this film. If your scared of a little child with a scalpal, then you should be scared of this film. Dale Midkiff's character was terrified of his dead son attacking him with a scalpal. All he had to do was give the little f***er a smack in the face!. Then maybe his head would fall off or something.The horror elements in this poor film are laughable. Not like The People Under The Stairs where you would laugh WITH the over-the-top antics. That you would more likely laugh AT the OTT acting, make up and SFX in Pet Sematary for being so ridiculous and fake looking.I gave this film 2 stars as it is slightly watchable and does humor me.

Now, the thing that elevates it from many others such as the titles in which I have previously brought up is the complex performances and astonishing human psychology that you'll witness here. The father's personality becomes so badly affected with a mixture of other emotions that ultimately overpower his sanity and force him to fulfill upon these actions despite of warnings by eerie spirits. This isn't just fun and games-another comical horror that gives you the opportunity to root for the killer's demise, because he's merely an innocent little boy who did nothing to deserve what happened to him, which may be the reason many have disliked it and found it to be as disturbing as they have; it is a complete injustice.Rarely ever does a picture from such a genre have that great of an affect upon me, and it has since been the only. But, as a horror film, it wasn't really what you may call ""terrifying"" or anything like that, but it was rather the mere premise of it that haunted me so, as it was that way to many others as well.Dale Midkiff did a great job at portraying Dr. Louis Creed, the father of the family who eventually reaches his breaking point; Fred Gwynne did just as compelling of a job as his close neighbor, Jud Crandall, who seems ordinary enough, but knows enough of the unordinary to keep his mouth shut; and Miko Hughes especially, at the age of twenty-nine months old, did an incredulously spectacular job as the child whose life ended much too soon.",5,Fady Ghaly's reviews,1003881600,"10 24, 2001",2001,1939,"['Pet', 'Sematary', 'undoubtedly', 'favorite', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fictional', 'novels', 'nothing', 'such', 'ludicrous', 'ones', 'Mangler', 'Creepshow', 'Graveyard', 'Shift', 'assume', ""'re"", 'big', 'surprise.A', 'grieved', 'father', 'indistinctly', 'conscious', 'abilities', 'Indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'attempts', 'provoke', 'son', 'grave', 'highly', 'distressful', 'forceful', 'film', 'strong', 'moral', 'Now', 'thing', 'many', 'others', 'such', 'titles', 'have', 'previously', 'brought', 'up', 'complex', 'performances', 'astonishing', 'human', 'psychology', ""'ll"", 'witness', 'here', 'father', 'personality', 'so', 'badly', 'affected', 'mixture', 'other', 'emotions', 'ultimately', 'sanity', 'force', 'fulfill', 'actions', 'warnings', 'eerie', 'spirits', ""n't"", 'just', 'fun', 'games-another', 'comical', 'horror', 'opportunity', 'root', 'killer', 'demise', 'merely', 'innocent', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'deserve', 'what', 'happened', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'many', 'have', 'disliked', 'found', 'be', 'as', 'disturbing', 'have', 'complete', 'injustice.Rarely', 'ever', 'picture', 'genre', 'have', 'great', 'affect', 'been', 'only', 'horror', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'may', 'call', 'terrifying', 'anything', 'was', 'rather', 'mere', 'premise', 'haunted', 'so', 'was', 'way', 'many', 'others', 'well.Dale', 'Midkiff', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Dr.', 'Louis', 'Creed', 'father', 'family', 'who', 'eventually', 'breaking', 'point', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'did', 'just', 'compelling', 'job', 'close', 'neighbor', 'Jud', 'Crandall', 'who', 'ordinary', 'enough', 'enough', 'unordinary', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'Miko', 'Hughes', 'especially', 'age', 'twenty-nine', 'months', 'old', 'did', 'incredulously', 'spectacular', 'job', 'child', 'life', 'ended', 'much', 'too', 'soon']",N/A

That includes both versions of this story and I also think this is one of the best King film adaptations. This has been a favorite of mine ever since it was first released, ah the good old days. The cast is great and the over all look and feel of the film is wonderful. I usually watch this at least once a year, although it has been a while since I have seen part two. And yes it is spelled wrong in the title because that is how the kids spelt it in the story.The Creed family has just moved into a house in Maine and lives across from a new neighbor named Jud. Jud befriends the new family and tells them of a local pet cemetery where that the kids created for lost pets [obviously]. Things are going well until the kid's cat named Winston Churchill or Church gets run over by a truck. So Louis Creed [the father] takes the cat to the cemetery and buries Church there. The cat returns but is much more a demon than a loving companion pet.Not to long after that Louis's son is killed the same way the cat was. Not to long after that Louis does what he did with the cat, buries him in that pet cemetery. He does this in the hopes that the child will come back. Come back he does as he behaves just like the cat, he is back to kill. What will the family do and how will they deal with this, well check out the flick or read the book.Director Mary Lambert did a great job with this film in my opinion. It moves at the perfect pace for this type of film, never to fast or slow. Of course she had Mr. King himself as the screen writer so that probably helped out a lot. Still the atmosphere and dread in this film is what gets me every time. It feels like a classic horror film from start to finish. The mood of the film is great as are the performances; every thing about this film is great to me.Fred Gwynne is excellent here and could very well be the show stealer, his performance and character here is so legendary. His character here has appeared on various ""South Park"" episodes, classic every time. David Midkiff is good here as well as the father tortured by his son's death. His wife is played by Denise Crosby and she as well is another all star player here. The kids are great here as well which goes to show what kind of a cast they had here.I know some people don't love this film and that is fine. Me, myself, and I though have always loved this flick. I need to rewatch the second film again but that will be for a later date. The special edition has a great commentary track from the director as well as some great behind the scenes features and such. So I say check this out if you have yet to, and even if you have pick up the special edition.",5,STILL LOVE IT,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,2766,"['PET', 'SEMATARYI', 'am', 'huge', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'secret', 'form', 'books', 'films', 'like', 'versions', 'story', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'King', 'film', 'adaptations', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'ever', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'cast', 'great', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'wonderful', 'usually', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'part', 'two', 'yes', 'spelled', 'wrong', 'title', 'how', 'kids', 'spelt', 'story.The', 'Creed', 'family', 'just', 'moved', 'house', 'Maine', 'new', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Jud', 'Jud', 'new', 'family', 'local', 'pet', 'cemetery', 'where', 'kids', 'created', 'lost', 'pets', '[', 'obviously', ']', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'kid', 'cat', 'named', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Church', 'run', 'over', 'truck', 'So', 'Louis', 'Creed', 'father', ']', 'cat', 'cemetery', 'buries', 'Church', 'there', 'cat', 'returns', 'much', 'more', 'demon', 'loving', 'companion', 'pet.Not', 'long', 'Louis', 'son', 'killed', 'same', 'way', 'cat', 'was', 'Not', 'long', 'Louis', 'what', 'did', 'cat', 'pet', 'cemetery', 'hopes', 'child', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'Come', 'back', 'just', 'cat', 'back', 'kill', 'What', 'will', 'family', 'do', 'how', 'will', 'deal', 'well', 'check', 'out', 'flick', 'read', 'book.Director', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'opinion', 'perfect', 'pace', 'type', 'film', 'never', 'fast', 'slow', 'course', 'had', 'Mr.', 'King', 'screen', 'writer', 'probably', 'helped', 'out', 'lot', 'Still', 'atmosphere', 'dread', 'film', 'what', 'time', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'mood', 'film', 'great', 'are', 'performances', 'thing', 'film', 'great', 'me.Fred', 'Gwynne', 'excellent', 'here', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'show', 'stealer', 'performance', 'character', 'here', 'so', 'legendary', 'character', 'here', 'appeared', 'various', 'South', 'Park', 'episodes', 'classic', 'time', 'David', 'Midkiff', 'good', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'tortured', 'son', 'death', 'wife', 'played', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'player', 'here', 'kids', 'are', 'great', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'what', 'kind', 'cast', 'had', 'here.I', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'film', 'fine', 'Me', 'though', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'flick', 'need', 'rewatch', 'second', 'film', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'later', 'date', 'special', 'edition', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'scenes', 'features', 'such', 'say', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'yet', 'even', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'special', 'edition']",N/A

See, it's like this: 'Pet Sematary' was an excellent novel, and the movie follows the book very closely, yet the movie totally blows.  There are a number of reasons for this:-It's just not meant to be filmed.  The reason the book works is because of the anguish and internal struggle.  That's just too tough to show on film, so they decided to focus on the undead too much.  This especially kills it at the end, as a killer toddler zombie just doesn't fly.  Sorry.  The real climax is when the father actually buries Gage, not the killing afterward.  Thus, the climax is just very, very lame.  And up until that point it could most politely be described as exceedingly mediocire because...-It's just cheap and flavorless looking.  Very TV movie-ish, with either bland or over the top performances. (Plus it's got that one chick from Star Trek, which I find very  distracting and annoying.)  The movie just ain't got no style on top of being, ya know, barely competent at its best moments.However, it is passably amusing, I suppose.  I've watched this movie on cable like 3 times, so it's got some entertainment value.(Though that says more about me than it does about the movie...)  It's also a load of fun to imitate Gage Creed's voice.  Pet Sematary 2 is better, though.

But this movie follows the book perfectly with the two exceptions of Jud's wife being absent and replaced with that of a maid, and dead Gage's taunting.  Those were the only two things that bugged me.  Nether the less, Pet Sematary was my first Stephen King book and this movie was not a let down by any means.  If you haven't read the book, go and buy it.  It's a powerful book that will stick to your insides and is not an easy read.  Even though all of us know Gage dies, to see that happening or even thinking about it is very powerful and difficult to watch since he is a child.  In any case, this is a powerful film and the added scenes with Pascow's ghost added quite a bit to the film.  Mary Lambert did a wonderful job with this film but the main reason that this movie was such a good adaptation of the film was that Stephen King himself wrote the screenplay and even starred in a small role as a priest with one line.

With that being said, it is true that this movie is also an eye roller at times as well.  However, overall, ""Pet Sematary"" is one of the scariest movies (if not the scariest) of the last 16-17 years...Mary Lambert and company do a great job of painting a very dark picture and producing an evil, morbid and downright scary atmosphere with this movie.The movie starts out with what appears to be a perfect family moving to a ridiculous location on a highway that has constant 18-wheel trucks driving through at 70 miles per hour...not exactly the best location for a cozy home for two small children and a cat. However, there are stupid people in this world and Louis, played by Dale Midkiff, is probably the stupidest character I have seen in a long time with regard to horror movies.The plot basically involves this ""perfect"" family and their adapting to their new home which has some interesting and dark history behind it that centers on an old Micmac indian burial ground and a ""pet sematary""...the former is an evil place with sour soil from all the corpses placed their over so many years and the latter is a ""place of rest and speaking"" according to Jud, played brilliantly by Fred Gwynne.The movie begins to pick up speed when Ellie's cat is run over by a truck one night and Jud decides to introduce Louis to the power of the ole Micmac indian burial ground which is a very creepy part as the two hike through and to what seems like a very evil place. The score of the movie here really adds to the creepy feeling and mood the audience receives through this part.Jud's character is clearly the most interesting in my opinion because he knows the history behind ""pet sematary"" and the old Micmac indian burial ground which is the location of this ancient evil. Louis's question to Jud, ""Has anyone ever buried a person up there?"" causes Jud to almost go mad at just hearing such a question. Obviously, this takes this movie to what is going to happen next and I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say, this movie is filled with dark subplots, e.g. Rachael's creepy sister story, the history of the evil burial ground and Missy's depressing health situation which ends in her suicide.Overall, this is a very good horror movie which could have been great or a ""classic"", but it sadly goes south towards the ending as the manifestation of this evil comes across ridiculously and those of you who have seen the film know what I am talking about. Also, Dale Midkiff's character, Louis, is so stupid to turn his back on his 3 year old son while on a picnic near ""that damn road"" as Jud calls it. Dale Midkiff is not a very good actor and his performance detracts somewhat from the effectiveness of this horror flick.Nevertheless, this is a VERY DARK and creepy horror flick that deserves respect in the horror genre and earns a place on my horror movie DVD shelf. I affectionately give ""Pet Sematary"" 4.25 STARS, which might be a bit generous because although the movie had such promise from the beginning, ""Pet Sematary"" fades a bit towards the latter half and the ending is not entirely satisfying as well.  Still, ""Pet Sematary"" is a very good horror movie, bordering on greatness, and this movie could have gotten 4.5 STARS in my opinion...alas, that was not the case and that's why the movie deserves just over FOUR STARS to recognize its darkly imaginative brilliance but also to express disappointment for the parts of this flick which prevent it from attaining 4.5 or maybe even 5 STARS status.""Pet Sematary"" is a must own for any serious horror movie fan and is one of the better Stephen King adaptations. I highly recommend this movie, but my criticism comes from my disappointment as it is clear this movie had tremendous promise in the beginning, but fails to follow through and for that reason cannot quite be considered one of the elite horror movies of alltime, although it is still very good to near great and definitely an entertaining horror movie overall.  As a horror movie viewer, you should have an awful good time watching ""Pet Sematary"" for the first time.",4,"4.25 STARS: ""...sometimes, dead is better.""---- Jud",1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,4195,"['Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'unique', 'horror', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'qualities', 'being', 'said', 'true', 'movie', 'also', 'eye', 'roller', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'overall', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'one', 'scariest', 'movies', 'not', 'scariest', 'last', '16-17', 'years', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'company', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'painting', 'very', 'dark', 'picture', 'producing', 'evil', 'morbid', 'downright', 'scary', 'atmosphere', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'perfect', 'family', 'moving', 'ridiculous', 'location', 'highway', 'constant', '18-wheel', 'trucks', 'driving', '70', 'miles', 'hour', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'location', 'cozy', 'home', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'cat', 'However', 'are', 'stupid', 'people', 'world', 'Louis', 'played', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'probably', 'stupidest', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'regard', 'horror', 'movies.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'perfect', 'family', 'adapting', 'new', 'home', 'interesting', 'dark', 'history', 'old', 'Micmac', 'indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'pet', 'sematary', 'former', 'evil', 'place', 'sour', 'soil', 'corpses', 'placed', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'latter', 'place', 'rest', 'speaking', 'according', 'Jud', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Fred', 'Gwynne.The', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'when', 'Ellie', 'cat', 'run', 'over', 'truck', 'one', 'night', 'Jud', 'introduce', 'Louis', 'power', 'ole', 'Micmac', 'indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'very', 'creepy', 'part', 'two', 'hike', 'what', 'very', 'evil', 'place', 'score', 'movie', 'here', 'really', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'mood', 'audience', 'part.Jud', 'character', 'clearly', 'most', 'interesting', 'opinion', 'history', 'pet', 'sematary', 'old', 'Micmac', 'indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'location', 'ancient', 'evil', 'Louis', 'question', 'Jud', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'buried', 'person', 'there', 'Jud', 'almost', 'go', 'mad', 'just', 'hearing', 'such', 'question', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'say', 'movie', 'filled', 'dark', 'subplots', 'e.g', 'Rachael', 'creepy', 'sister', 'story', 'history', 'evil', 'burial', 'ground', 'Missy', 'depressing', 'health', 'situation', 'suicide.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'classic', 'sadly', 'south', 'ending', 'manifestation', 'evil', 'ridiculously', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Also', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'character', 'Louis', 'so', 'stupid', 'turn', 'back', '3', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'picnic', 'damn', 'road', 'Jud', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'performance', 'detracts', 'somewhat', 'effectiveness', 'horror', 'flick.Nevertheless', 'VERY', 'DARK', 'creepy', 'horror', 'flick', 'respect', 'horror', 'genre', 'place', 'horror', 'movie', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'affectionately', 'give', 'Pet', 'Sematary', '4.25', 'STARS', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'generous', 'movie', 'had', 'such', 'promise', 'beginning', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'bit', 'latter', 'half', 'ending', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'bordering', 'greatness', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', '4.5', 'STARS', 'opinion', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'why', 'movie', 'just', 'FOUR', 'STARS', 'recognize', 'darkly', 'imaginative', 'brilliance', 'also', 'express', 'disappointment', 'parts', 'flick', 'prevent', 'attaining', '4.5', 'maybe', 'even', '5', 'STARS', 'status', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'must', 'own', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'one', 'better', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'criticism', 'disappointment', 'clear', 'movie', 'had', 'tremendous', 'promise', 'beginning', 'follow', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'elite', 'horror', 'movies', 'alltime', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'near', 'great', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'movie', 'overall', 'horror', 'movie', 'viewer', 'should', 'have', 'awful', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'first', 'time']",N/A

In some stories, light banishes the dark and the main characters, although battered and bruised, are ok in the end.  And in other stories, everybody dies.  Pet Sematary is one of those other stories.  A cautionary tale about defying nature's intentions, Pet Sematary follows the experiences of young doctor Louis Creed and his small family after moving to Maine.  Their property has a path in the back leading to a pet cemetery, but Louis's neighbor, played in the movie by Herman Munster himself, Fred Gwynne, tells him about a secret burial place farther back in the woods.  This secret place holds the power of resurrection, but Louis finds out, as others had before him, that ""sometimes dead is better.""  I always thought this was one of Stephen King's scariest books, and while the movie is good, it doesn't quite match the fear inspired by the novel.  Some of the characters are played excellently, like Jud (the neighbor played by Gwynne), and both child roles of Ellie and Gage Creed.  The central characters of Louis and his wife Rachel are hit-and-miss, with some scenes either too flat or the opposite, too hammy.  I wish the movie had pushed the concept of the Wendigo spirit residing in the woods, which played a big role in the book and made it scarier for me, but I guess they couldn't think of a way to make it translate to film.  However, with the movie's catastrophic climax where, yes, everybody dies, it will always be one of those scary movie favorites that pops up every year around October.",4,A Fun Scary Movie to Watch Once a Year,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,1645,"['being', 'staple', 'Halloween', 'scary-movie', 'season', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'darkest', 'novels', 'stories', 'light', 'banishes', 'dark', 'main', 'characters', 'battered', 'bruised', 'are', 'ok', 'end', 'other', 'stories', 'everybody', 'dies', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'one', 'other', 'stories', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'defying', 'nature', 'intentions', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'experiences', 'young', 'doctor', 'Louis', 'Creed', 'small', 'family', 'moving', 'Maine', 'Their', 'property', 'path', 'back', 'leading', 'pet', 'cemetery', 'Louis', 'neighbor', 'played', 'movie', 'Herman', 'Munster', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'secret', 'burial', 'place', 'back', 'woods', 'secret', 'place', 'power', 'resurrection', 'Louis', 'out', 'others', 'had', 'sometimes', 'dead', 'better', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'scariest', 'books', 'movie', 'good', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'fear', 'inspired', 'novel', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'excellently', 'Jud', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Gwynne', 'child', 'roles', 'Ellie', 'Gage', 'Creed', 'central', 'characters', 'Louis', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'are', 'hit-and-miss', 'scenes', 'too', 'flat', 'opposite', 'too', 'hammy', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'pushed', 'concept', 'Wendigo', 'spirit', 'residing', 'woods', 'played', 'big', 'role', 'book', 'made', 'scarier', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'make', 'translate', 'film', 'However', 'movie', 'catastrophic', 'climax', 'where', 'yes', 'everybody', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'scary', 'movie', 'up', 'year', 'October']",N/A

He befriends a kind and good old man who lives right across the road from their house named Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynne) who gives them a tour of the area especially of the local pet cemetery that has a secret beyond the hills, for it's an old indian burial ground with magic powers to resurrects dead animals and other living beings back to life. One day the family cat gets killed but luckily Louis and Judd resurrect it but it seems harmless but acts different as a zombie and even one day the 3-year old son Gage gets killed by a truck and Louis must try to resurrect him unfortunately there is bad results.An exciting, gruesome and macabre if not entirely faithful adaptation of Stephen King's novel, this supernatural zombie horror thriller offers good frights, nice acting and shocks abound. Fred Gwynne whom you remember as Herman Munster does a fantastic and perfect performance as the lovable old man and there is a memorable score with some genuine tension, Miko Hughes makes a memorable performance as the three year old zombie murderer with a fetish for scalpals. It's also a gripping tale of supernatural horror you'll never forget and coming in 2008 is a remake that will be more faithful to the novel.This DVD has great picture and sound with only three extras being three featurettes and no trailer, but this is still a must have for zombie and horror fans.Also recommended: ""Cemetery Man"", ""The Fog (1980)"", ""Inferno (1980)"", ""Demons"", ""Stephen King's IT"", ""City of the Living Dead (a.k.a.

It is about a family who moves into a house that was built near a mysterious Indian burial ground with the powers of resurrection. But what the family doesn't know, is that what comes back from the dead won't be the same. They do not come back as the same person, but they come back evil. Based on the novel by the awesome author Stephen King, Pet Sematary is one of the best horror films, because it delivers you with goose bumps and a horribly great time.

I don't know what Lewis (Dale Midkiff) was thinking when he buried Church the family pet in the Pet Sematary. The neighbor Judd (the late Fred Gwynne)told him not to ever bury a person up there when Lewis asked him about it, he told him sometimes dead is better, apparently Lewis wasn't paying attention. On top of that Lewis buried his son Gage (Miko Hughes) that was tragically killed due to being hit by an 18 wheeler in the Pet Sematary resurrecting this monster because he definitely wasn't the lovable little boy we all saw before the accident. Gage comes back, murders Judd and his mother Lewis' wife. If that wasn't bad enough Lewis still hasn't learned his lesson because he buries his wife in the Pet Sematary, and she comes back and kills him. I'm guessing this is what happens next, she buries him in the Pet Sematary he comes back, they go and get Ellie from her grandparents house when she has been while all of this is taking place, keep in mind that she has saw everything that has happened in her nightmares all thanks to their dead spiritual guide Pascow who also tried to warn Lewis about the Pet Sematary.

fear.It shows a person becoming a toy of a cursed land.It is quite depressing,no comedy in this horror movie.It is about a doctor moving to a town with his family.The road by the town has big semis driving down it constantly.Very unsafe for kids who do not yet know their street crossing skills.Not only do they have the road to contend with they have a decrepit pet cemetery in the woods past the house.Past the pet cemetary there is a large Native American Burial Ground.Over the years something happened to change this once holy place to a cursed place.What living things you bury in this comes back to life.Unfortunately they do not at all come back the same.The doctors daughters cat is crossing the street and struck down by a truck.To escape having to see his daughter sad and explaining death to her he burys the cat at the Burial Ground.Soon the cat returns but with eyes that glow more than normal cats eyes and dirty and looking like well something risen from the dead and with a very bad attitude.Soon though things fall to pieces,the doctors son named Gage decides to go do some playing in the street while the family is not watching.With playing in the street not exactly as safe a game for kids as CandyLand he is struck down by a truck.This is one of the most depressing parts.Even for cold and harsh people watching little children die can be the saddest of events.I must say it was tastefully done.The scene did not have alot of gore.In fact the way it was done made it more believable and more horrific than alot of gore could have.You probably can guess what is going to happen.What happens is pretty predicatble but has a twist and is terrifying and ghoulish even if you know what is going to go on because of the way this movie was made.So in short if you like feel good movies this is not for you.If you enjoy the supernatural and horror and cold despair you probably will enjoy it.I do warn you it is quite depressing and it makes you really realize and think about death which alot of people do not like to do.Oh and the scene of the doctors wife when she was still a kid and the ordeal she had with her sister is one of the most terrifying and saddening things I have seen in a horror movie.I gave this movie four stars instead of five because the one fault I see with it is that it could have been longer and could have went into more depth and detail in the story.It is a good movie though especially your first time seeing it.",4,This Film Is Very Good But Very Melancholy,999648000,"09 5, 2001",2001,2601,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'pretty',

I think I watched it on video ""long ago"" because I disliked it so much and refused to watch it ever again.  I'm interested what ten-plus years will do....  As I recall, however, one of the main problems with this movie is that it takes a brilliant book and makes it least-common-denominator, with bad acting (excepting Fred Gwynne who is GREAT) and an iffy script.  Dale Midkiff has disappeared from the map for good reason and it's a shame that the so-so director couldn't get a quality performance out of the cute kid playing Gage - it looked like a well-lit home video of him pretending to be scary.  Oddly, I remember Dr. Creed's ghostly patient/messenger as being a highlight of the film (but the corny ""DA DA!"" moment of seeing his feet covered in mud after his ""nightmare"" is inexcusable).It's difficult to film this, but the scariest part of the book was the possibility of the Wendigo in the woods.  That was almost completely dropped from the movie and too many ""shock"" shots were inserted (such as the ""run toward the camera"" shot of Zelda) plus a stereotypical slasher ending.  The story of PET SEMATARY is like a cold mist that chills your skin and keeps you on edge... the film version took the basic story elements and shoved them into a pre-packaged ""slasher"" script.I'd love to see somebody take another stab at this.  As I said, I'll review it again this evening and possibly change my mind.  For now, I leave it at three stars for just getting it to the screen and for Fred Gwynne.......right. upon watching it again, only a few things have changed in the above review - Fred Gwynnne is still the bst thing in the movie, with the guy who plays Victor Pascow as a close second, Dale Midkiff was actually better than I remember, but the girl who played Ellie was so annoyingly bad I wanted to throw her through a plate-glass window.  The Wendigo part was still something that should have been looked at, primarily because the idea that cheating death has it's consequences was not established firmly enough.

252603,A3B66P2YUN2VKX,6301427076,"Michael Couch ""Homer Griffin""","[0, 1]","I enjoyed watching this movie back in the day.  It's so spooky and creepy.  Great characters like the massive head wound harry guy, the creepy spinal meningitis girl who was played by a boy.  The guy who was in the munsters.  All classic.  Those last two factoids were brought to my attention by listening to the director's commentary.  The director sounds like the sort of gentle, kind voiced person you would expect to find at your local Yankee candle and/or Hallmark store telling you what candle to buy or how to trim the wick just right.  &#34;A trimmed wick is a happy wick.  We like happy candles.&#34;On to the movie itself it plays just as well as when I saw it back in the day.  Maybe not as scary but my horror bar has been raised quite a bit since I saw this movie for the first time.  The story, as you might imagine is full of characters who make the wrong decision at just about every possible opportunity.  The only guy who has good advice is the scary dead guy.  That's a great dynamic, having the voice of reason be the chewed up zombie and the kind old man be the ultimate pandoras box of doom.I also gleaned that from the commentary but the thought had occurred to me watching it all those years ago.  If the old guy doesn't keep bringing up the pet cemetary then who knows what might have happened.The extras are slim.  Some behind the scenes stuff about the process Stephen King went through to write the book.  It seems King had a similar experience to what happens in the film.  It made him think about what he would be willing to do if such a tragedy occurred to him.

252605,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6301427076,Michael R Gates,"[42, 47]","It has been the candid observation of numerous film critics that the works of literary horror maven Stephen King don't often translate well to the screen.  But when they DO work, man do they WORK!  PET SEMATARY is a prime example.  Though some of the details of the King masterwork had to be pared down--as is often the case when well-written literature is made to fit into a two-hour visual narrative--this film captures perfectly the spine-tingling essence and atmosphere of the original novel.  As with many King cinematic adaptations, it HELPS if you've already read the book.  But with a really good one like PET SEMATARY, familiarity with the book is absolutely NOT a prerequisite.PET SEMATARY tells the story of the Creeds, a young nuclear family who has moved from the Midwest to a small college town in Maine.  They take up residence in a old country house a few miles outside the town, and it isn't long before they become friendly with their new neighbor, a bucolic but agreeable old coot named Jud who lives across the street.  Jud quickly alerts them to the fact that the road between their two houses is a busy rural highway, and he therefore warns them to be always mindful of their young children and the family cat.  Many a pet has ended up in the nearby pet &quot;sematary,&quot; Jud explains, due to an unscheduled meeting with a speeding truck or car on that infernal highway.Inevitably, the Creeds' cat, Church, joins the roadkill ranks, but only the father, Louis Creed, is at home when this happens.  Neighborly Jud worries about how the Creed children will take the news, so he decides to let Louis in on secret.  Just beyond the nearby cemetery where the children of ages past have buried their beloved pets, Jud tells Louis, is another cemetery that was long ago held sacred by the Native Americans once indigenous to the region.  Local legend has it that when you bury your dead there, they will return to life before the end of the following day.  Sometimes there is a price to pay for this magic, says Jud, as the dead don't always come back exactly the way they were before they died.  Nonetheless, Jud thinks it is worth the risk if they can protect the Creed children from the pain of losing a cherished pet.  Being a physician, Louis is understandably skeptical, but he humors his elderly friend and, with the stiffened body of Church in hand, follows Jud up to the &quot;magical&quot; burial grounds.Much to the surprise of Louis, Church does indeed arrive on the Creed doorstep the next morning.  In some intangible way, though,  Church seems different--no longer a loving feline, but instead stealthy, aloof,  and easily provoked to anger.  Jud tells Louis to try to ignore theses differences, and he suggests that if Louis remains mum about Church's resurrection, the rest of the family will never know their little secret.Of course, as one might guess, it isn't long before one of the Creed children meets his fate on the highly trafficked road.  But dare the grieving Louis bury his son in the sacred soil of the Indian cemetery?  And if he does, will what worked for a cat work for a human?  If so, at what price?PET SEMATARY is a very satisfying horror film that offers the requisite spooky ambiance, frightful imagery, and outright scares, and all without requiring much effort to suspend one's disbelief.  Part of the reason the filmmakers pull this one off is, of course, due to the excellent job that King has done in his adaptation of his own novel.  But the lion's share of the credit goes to the excellent performances from the cast.  TV actor Dale Midkiff, whose acting style usually teeters on the histrionic, here turns in a subtle yet compelling performance as the family patriarch, Dr. Louis Creed.  Even when things get really intense for his character, Midkiff maintains control and convincingly delivers the reactions of an educated, loving father who is grasping for a rational means of rescuing his family from a dangerously surreal situation.  Denise Crosby--better known to SF fans as STAR TREK's Tasha Yar--also does an unusually good job portraying Louis' perky upper-middle-class wife.It is the performance of Fred Gwynne that really makes the show, however.  Genre fans know Gwynne from his role as Herman in TV's classic horror-themed sitcom THE MUNSTERS.  As the rustic and lovable Jud, Gwynne stretches his thespian skills way beyond the limits of the slapstick of THE MUNSTERS to create a credible and convincing elderly Maine farmer.  Gwynne could easily take it over the top and upstage his fellow actors here, but he instead keeps it honest and subdued and thereby makes a significant contribution towards pulling the audience into the fantasy of the filmic narrative.As with many of Paramount's DVDs, this disc is sparse on extras.  However, the digital transfer (for the widescreen anamorphic edition) was made from a very clean print, and both the picture and sound quality are great.  For King fans and fans of great cinematic horror, owning this film is a must!",4,&quot;I Don't Wanna Be Buried in a Pet Cemetery....&quot;,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,5037,"['been', 'candid',

252606,AN8M401S8Y6DA,6301427076,Mike Liddell,"[0, 0]","Stephen King pushes the limits in Pet Semetary one of his darkest film adaptations.  I've read a lot of articles he used to write for Entertainment Weekly and it would seem he is as giddy, passionate, and down to earth about films and horror films as any die hard fan would be.  I think that's why to me Pet Semetary had flashes of other horror films in it all while having it's own unique idea, maybe all the horror films King has watched seeped into his subconscious.  For example there is a hanging that visually reminded me for a moment of The Omen however the well known scene in The Omen I am referring to was supposed to be and was far more effective.  The dead zombie looking college student with his brains hanging out ghost/ advisor with subtle hints of dark humor reminded me of the undead friend in An American Werewolf in London and the whole coming back from the dead reminiscent of Romero flicks.  Pet Semetary is still original and different from all the examples I listed they just gave me flashbacks to those movies just the look of those scenes.King really pushes the limits in this, I mean Spielberg has a child die in Jaws but to basically pick the cutest kid you can, have some character development then have him die and give instant flashbacks to him growing up and baby pictures ONLY to bring him back and kill him again in an even sadder way.  So I have this theory that maybe Stephen King being mad over his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive flopping says I'll show people vehicles can be scary and I'll make a highway to hell that kills all things cute.  Then I'll have said killer truck with 666 imprinted on the side (and it does) bring the wife home to meet her demise at the hands of her now undead cute son.  The cute son even named ""Gage"" as in the gage of a car.  The car acting as a vessel delivering her to her doom. Or maybe not, it's just a theory.There are three key elements that make Pet Semetary effective and an essential add to any horror collection.1.  And the creepiest and most effective part of horror in the movie Rachel Creed's sister Zelda who makes three appearances, the most effective her bent over waiting in the corner at the end.  Zelda was played by Andrew Hubatsek.2.  The creepy kid from Kindergarten Cop and New Nightmare Miko Hughes who plays Gage.  He is cute and lovable and his demise can rip viewers hearts out.  Gage can also rip viewers hearts out in another way as a great slasher killer who would've made a great good guy doll.  Whether gage is slashing Achilles, jumping out of an attic, or calling his dad on the phone to tell him he's done playing with mommy now he wants to play with youuuuu, he's great.3.  Last but not least the late great Fred Gwynne who played Herman Munster on the Munsters and who is now Jud Crandall a wise, old, lovable, beer drinking, smoking, hillbilly with a great accent.  He brings a lot to the film.Not the best Stephen King adaptation but a solid add to any horror collection.There were no dvd features on this disc.

Little do they know what horrors lay ahead, thanks to an all too dangerous road, a chatty, old neighbor, and a piece of sour ground beyond the local pet cemetery.Shortly after their move, the family cat, Church, is killed by one of the many semi-trucks carelessly speeding past the Creeds' front yard. On a tip from Jud (Fred Gwynne), the man across the street, Louis Creed (Dale Midkiffe) buries his daughter's cat on a forbidden piece of land that was once an Indian burial ground. Before he realizes what he has done, Church is back among the living, but there's something not quite right about him. Ignoring the signs and warnings from a recently deceased, local student, Louis repeats the act when his 2-year-old son Gage is also killed by a passing truck. From there, things just go from bad to worse.One of the best Stephen King based films ever, ""Pet Sematary"" is a true horror film in the best way. The story, despite similarities to other stories/films here and there (the Monkey's Paw is mentioned in the commentary, and one should easily be able to see the similarity between the Pascow ghost and Jack Goodman from An American Werewolf in London), is full of originality (and truth, according to Stephen King), emotion, and extreme horror. At its heart, it is a story about death and learning about death. The dialogue is excellent and the performances as well. I confess, I found the little girl character to be rather annoying, but I'm not sure she wasn't supposed to be, since the director mentions that in the book even her father finds her irritating. While I haven't read the book myself, clearly it has its differences. Nevertheless, Stephen King seems to have worked closely with the filmmakers on this one. Not only does he have a tiny cameo, he also is given a lot of time in one of the three making-of featurettes, which are all nice supplements to the film. The other DVD extra is the aforementioned director's commentary. The theatrical trailer is not included.""Pet Semetary"" has its share of gore.

252623,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6301427076,Paperbackstash,"[1, 2]","I know I'm in the minority but overall I didn't really like this film.The plot is exceptional and the book was fabulous but it adapted poorly. It could have done wonders with suitable actors and other fine touches but it didn't make the goal.Louis Creed, his wife Rachel , toddler Gage and little girl Ellie move into a new town for the husband/father's medical practice on a college campus. But they picked a house near a trail leading to an old pet cemetery -- and beyond that, a type of evil, unholy ground the Indians knew to avoid. The setting of the land is both creepy and effective, and after meeting and being led by their old neighbor Jud, they go to the cemetery in person and look around.During a family trip the family cat Church is ran over and Jud grudgingly tells Louis there's a way of doing things that will make his daughter less upset. After burying the cat on the ground that lays beyond the cemetery, it comes back from the dead and no one except Louis and Jud is the wiser.Unfortunately it doesn't stop there. We witness a horrid car accident victim at the campus and he's trying to warn Louis about something through ghostly visions. The movie picks up pace and enters a higher void of weirdness as pretty soon we're seeing stories of dogs brought back bad, and even worse. I won't spoil anymore for you but let's just say you should never bury a person in that place as something in the ground soils their previous spirit, and they come back evil, never like before.This movie had its promising points. The opening credits have morbid la-la-la music going down with flashes of pet graves. The scenes with the college student hit by the truck are gory but great. When Louis wakes up after his ""walk"" with dirt on his feet, creepy. Some excellent directional techniques and the accompanied music was all right. You're never bored.But the movie had a whole cheap melodramatic touch underneath that killed most pleasure I could find. As everyone knows sometimes acting (especially in such a character-orientated production) can really damper the spirits of a movie and boy did it damper mine here.The only person whose acting I adored was little Gage's. Ellie Creed (the little girl) drove me up the wall. Her constant whining and ridiculous dialogue drove nails through my nerves and she's on my list of most annoying characters of all time. Between her ominous warnings for dreams, the fake sobbing from falling all over the place, and the constant whimpering it really was bad. I didn't know whether to cover my ears or roll my eyes at some of these scenes. The wife isn't annoying but I never really liked her (she was also in Dolly Dearest). During some important parts she came through but overall she irritated me. Louis, while not an award winner, did a good enough job, I got into him, although is character was a little off.The very ending really stunk. Cheaply gory and then wrapped up with the cheesiest music possible. If they were wanting to make a dark, weird movie -- STICK WITH IT! This weird humor at the end killed it for me and I was disappointed as all hell. The animals were the scariest thing about this movie and I wish there had been more of them around to see.From the first appearance of the ghost, to Louis running into Church in the bathroom, to some of the night walks -- a creepy feel with your hairs raising on the back of your neck and the skin going into gooseflesh on your arms. So yes, definitely some fear factor woven in.Overall a theme that settles a quiet and chilling discomfort all the way to the bone...Perfect straight out horror. But in this case they ruined it in the transfer's nitty-gritty details. The biggest contribution to its failure wasn't only the cast but also that they simply tried to hard, creating too much false, groan-inducing drama. Even the biggest death of the movie was ruined by peoples reactions (Louis's scream, photos flashing on screen -- what, we couldn't feel sad without those?) to Ellie's annoying FAKE AS HELL crying afterward in the kitchen.Such a shame....:( But I still recommend you watch it. Yes, that's right. It seems most people aren't turned off from the movie by the cast and drama and actually enjoyed it immensely.

Other than the dark premise (which is brilliant, I just started reading the novel now) and the aspects aforementioned, Pet Sematary is a totally forgettable King adaptation.Many of the climatic moments were overdone to the point of cheesiness, and the character dynamics were often overtly sentimental (i.e. the daughter, she was very loud, annoying and a terrible child actress).The saddest part of all is that the movie has such great potential to be a great psychological/emotional horror film. The sheer premise of resurrecting the beloved deceased alone carries with it a heavy philosophical and spiritual weight.

252633,A1MWZCZGTE79DT,6301427076,Rod Labbe,"[0, 3]","In October 1988, I had the extreme pleasure of twice visiting the Pet Semetary set. The first took me to Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, Maine--where they were filming the scene involving Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) as he's about to dig up his son, Gage. Besides Midkiff, who was charming, I also got to meet ""Pascow,"" who was made up exactly as he appears in the film--complete with oozing brain. The second visit was in Ellsworth, Maine. There, I got to watch interiors being shot of the Creed household and a scene that was cut from the film (involving Louis and Rachel arguing about their earlier visit to the pet sematary and Ellie's new fascination with death). My experiences ended up in Fangoria magazine and its sister publication (since deceased) Gorezone. The film itself is flawed, I think. While director Mary Lambert displays an interestingcinematic style, there were many things that detracted from the horror. One was the absolutely atrocious performance of the little girl who played Louis' daughter. Not only did she not look like either parent (who were both extremely handsome people), she's called upon to be ""dramatic,"" and that definitely is a bad move. Witness the scene where she wakes from a nightmare to tell her mother that someone named ""Paxcow"" is telling her that ""daddy's in trouble."" The demands of the scene are obviously beyond her.  I also disliked much of the script, and for that, we can blame Mr. King himself. It was full of typical ""Maine-isms"" that ring true only to people who know nothing about Maine. I've lived here all my life and never once met anyone who talks like the Fred Gwynne character!  And here's an interesting tidbit: the concluding scene of Pet Sematary was reshot after test audiences didn't like what they saw.  In the original ending, Louis is waiting for Rachel to return from the dead.  We see him sitting on the floor, and she enters (we only see her feet). He looks up, smiles, and then the phone rings. Rachel answers, and it's Ellie. Rachel says ""it's all right, Ellie.  Mommy's home,"" then she turns to the camera, and we see that half her face has been hacked off.  End of movie. In the reshot ending, Rachel enters, and the alarm clock goes off (which was, in the original, the ringing of the phone). She and Louis embrace, and all kinds of goop pours from her ravaged her face. Then, inexplicably, she kills Louis.  Given what's transpired throughout the movie, this ending makes absolutely no sense--but the filmmakers wanted a jolt, so they reshot it for more graphic effects.Do I recommend Pet Sematary? Of course! It's an interesting example of late 80's King horror. It's no Carrie or The Shining, but it has all the requisite King elements: male protagonist, a supporting female who really doesn't understand her man, and other-worldly forces who are zeroing in on said male. Toss in a demonic cat, plenty of red herrings, and a big fire, and you have something that goes down smooth--even if it does leave you hungering for more.",3,I covered Pet Sematary for Fangoria!,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,3007,"['October', '1988', 'had', 'extreme', 'pleasure', 'twice', 'visiting', 'Pet', 'Semetary', 'set', 'first', 'took', 'Mount', 'Hope', 'Cemetery', 'Bangor', 'Maine', 'where', 'were', 'filming', 'scene', 'involving', 'Louis', 'Creed', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'dig', 'up', 'son', 'Gage', 'Besides', 'Midkiff', 'who', 'was', 'charming', 'also', 'got', 'meet', 'Pascow', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'exactly', 'film', 'complete', 'oozing', 'brain', 'second', 'visit', 'was', 'Ellsworth', 'Maine', 'got', 'watch', 'interiors', 'being', 'shot', 'Creed', 'household', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'involving', 'Louis', 'Rachel', 'arguing', 'earlier', 'visit', 'pet', 'sematary', 'Ellie', 'new', 'fascination', 'death', 'experiences', 'ended', 'up', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'sister', 'publication', 'deceased', 'Gorezone', 'film', 'flawed', 'think', 'director', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'interestingcinematic', 'style', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'detracted', 'horror', 'One', 'was', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'performance', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Louis', 'daughter', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'parent', 'who', 'were', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'people', 'called', 'be', 'dramatic', 'definitely', 'bad', 'move', 'scene', 'where', 'nightmare', 'tell', 'mother', 'someone', 'named', 'Paxcow', 'telling', 'daddy', 'trouble', 'demands', 'scene', 'are', 'obviously', 'also', 'disliked', 'much', 'script', 'can', 'blame', 'Mr.', 'King', 'was', 'full', 'typical', 'Maine-isms', 'ring', 'true', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Maine', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'here', 'life', 'never', 'once', 'met', 'anyone', 'who', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'character', 'here', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'concluding', 'scene', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'was', 'reshot', 'test', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'saw', 'original', 'ending', 'Louis', 'waiting', 'Rachel', 'return', 'dead', 'see', 'sitting', 'floor', 'enters', 'only', 'see', 'feet', 'up', 'smiles', 'then', 'phone', 'rings', 'Rachel', 'answers', 'Ellie', 'Rachel', 'right', 'Ellie', 'Mommy', 'home', 'then', 'camera', 'see', 'face', 'been', 'hacked', 'off', 'End', 'movie', 'reshot', 'ending', 'Rachel', 'enters', 'alarm', 'clock', 'was', 'original', 'ringing', 'phone', 'Louis', 'embrace', 'kinds', 'goop', 'pours', 'ravaged', 'face', 'Then', 'inexplicably', 'Louis', 'Given', 'what', 'transpired', 'movie', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'jolt', 'reshot', 'more', 'graphic', 'effects.Do', 'recommend', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'course', 'interesting', 'example', 'late', '80', 'King', 'horror', 'Carrie', 'Shining', 'requisite', 'King', 'elements', 'male', 'protagonist', 'supporting', 'female', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'understand', 'man', 'other-worldly', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'zeroing', 'said', 'male', 'Toss', 'demonic', 'cat', 'plenty', 'red', 'herrings', 'big', 'fire', 'have', 'something', 'down', 'even', 'leave', 'hungering', 'more']",N/A

But after reading the book I can truly  appreciate the script and some of the theatrical elements.  The novel Pet  Sematary was one of the darkest, most disturbing works by Stephen King (or  for that matter any author) that I have ever read.  King's adaptation of  his own novel is pretty true to his book, but what made me wary about  reading the novel after viewing the movie was the terrible miscasting for  the film.  The only person who played his part well was Fred Gwynne as Jud  Crandall.  Everybody else seemed so terribly forced that almost every  emotion was unbelievable.  There was practically no chemistry between Dale  Midkiff and Denise Crosby (Louis and Rachel Creed) and the girl who played  Ellie (or Ellen in the film) was just plain annoying.  I do have to give  credit to the little boy who played Gage, although he did kinda give me the  creeps (while in the book he was just a sympathetic character).  The woman  who played Rachel Creed's sister, Zelda DID scare the pee outta me,  although I guess it was being presented with the worst case scenario of a  person with spinal menningitis that did it.  Great makeup for her  character!  But sadly this movie came off as laughable the first time  around, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I HADN&quot;T READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!  Gradually,  as I made this a traditional Halloween viewing, I allowed myself to fall  into the atmospherics of the film and subsequently gave myself the  heebie-jeebies everytime I watched it.  But I must warn potential viewers:  READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!  It's way better, incredibly disturbing, and it will  keep you up at night!

It was hard not to fall in love with the family as you watch the Creed's grow into their new home.To start off with, lets begin with the story outline. A young and fresh family, the Creeds, move to Ludlow. The handsome doctor-father, the lovely wife, the young and half-oblivious daughter, Ellie, and the newborn baby, Gage, and not to forget one of the greatest characters, the cat, Church, named after Winston. Well, there are the friendly neighbors, Judd and his wife, who know all the secrets to Ludlow. The family soon desicovers Pet Sematary, where soon unfortunately, Church will be. And he won't be alone there, either...Then there is the doctor's first day at work. A boy hit by a car while jogging has so few minutes left in his life when he is brought in that Louis labels him already dead, practically. Victor Pascow lies on the table, bleeding violently, not stirring in the slightest, until Louis moves to touch him- in that moment his entire life is going to change.""The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis."" This is nearly all that Victor can mutter. Louis is terrified and nerve-jangled due to the strength with which Victor is squeezing his arm and how he knew his name in the first place.This movie is chock-full of terrifying thrill-ride moments. How can anyone forget the ""night walk"" Louis takes with Victor, only to wake up and find that what he thought a dream was shocking reality? The camera angles are first rate and make you feel like you are actually walking in the movie with the characters. The special effects were some of the greatest ive seen in a movie from this time range, as well. It is easy to believe that these characters (whom i won't mention to spoil the ending) came back from the dead. Seeing Timmy Baterman come back with claws and stretchy skin, as well as watching him nearly rip it apart with his own hands, is something which is worth the money of this movie, and thats only one of the fantastic scenes in the movie. I highly recommend it for anyone, but not for young children. They might have trouble cuddling their pets afterwords, especially after coming back from a long vacation.P.S. Even for those who love animals, like myself, (I hope to be a veterinarian in later years) I recommend it because even though it does feature some animal death, this movie focuses not only on animals, but on humans and how their pets deaths can affect them and drive them to do things they wouldn't normally consider.

In a nutshell, the picture is the best it has ever looked and the sound is even better, with all the speakers getting utilized throughout the course of the film. When those trucks go rumbling from one side of the screen to the other, you practically feel it as the sound pans from one side to the other. The sound mix for this film is pretty impressive, creating discomfort in subtle ways. Even the music by Elliot Goldenthal seems to benefit from this upgraded sound mix.The extras are the same ones from the DVD but still worth a watch, covering the genesis of the story, the film's production and reflections from cast and crew. You'll get through them in no time at all and director Mary Lambert's commentary track adds to the fun.Personally, I love this movie.

Louis, his lovely wife Rachel, their daughter Ellie, and toddler Gage (Miko Hughes) have left behind the hustle and bustle of the big city for a little country living. But there seems to be a few things their realtor forgot to tell them about their new digs. First, it seems that the road that runs by their new house is like the ""Indianapolis Speedway"" for truckers. Second, there's a little overgrown path in their backyard that leads to a makeshift ""Pet Sematary"". It serves as the final resting-place for many of the pets claimed by this ""highway to hell"".  Third...well, I'll get to that later.Louis, a new doctor at the local college, receives the dying words from an accident victim. Later that evening, Louis is visited by this ghostly apparition who warns ""the barrier was not meant to be crossed."" It was only a nightmare, right.....or was it???While Louis' wife and kids are away, Ellie's cat ""Church"" falls victim to this deadly road. As Louis and his neighbor, Jud, (Fred Gwynne) head out to bury ""Church"" in the ""Pet Sematary"", Jud decides to take Louis beyond the barrier (of brush) up into an ancient Micmac Indian burial ground. Here they lay ""Church"" to rest.Well as time passes, sure enough ""Church"" shows back up, a little worse for wear, but alive and seemingly well. Louis believes he must have buried him alive. He reeks of an unbelievable stench that won't go away, (couldn't be the smell of death now, could it?) and he isn't quite the cat we've all come to love. He rushes over to Jud places where he find out that ""dead don't stay dead"" when buried up there. Their conversion quickly ends with the question ""Has anyone ever buried a person up there?"" Jud replies with a fearful and rather unconvincing NOOOOOOOOO!!!! Can we say foreshadowing?One day, as the family is enjoying a picnic, the unthinkable happens. Little Gage wanders out onto the ""killer highway"" and Crash! Boom! Bam! It isn't pretty, but the editing is so well done that it brings home the horror of the scene without the gore. (Sorry Gorehounds...but there is some really nice gore throughout the film) Blaming himself for Gage's death, Louis decides to make things right. If it worked for ""Church"" it's gotta work for Gage. But Louis seemed to have forgot that ""Church"" was soured by his resurrection. The consequences of Gage's revival are quite devastating. The imagery is quite frightening as Gage lays waste to any and all that get in his way. First there was Jud, than Mommy, and now he wants to play with his Daddy.

So they had a whole Stephen King season of films on Channel 4, and I managed to catch ""Christine"" and this one, ""Pet Sematary"".As the title and the opening credits came onto the screen, I could actually feel my skin crawling, and had an ominous feeling hanging around my head.The story is that of a nice family, a mum, dad and two kids, who move to a house next to an extremely busy road. Across the road lives a neighbour Jed, who is intent on showing them the pet sematary that is just down the lane. Pets are always getting run down by the trucks that go past every day, and sooner or later, the young daughter's cat Church dies on that same road. Jed takes the father to bury it, not in the sematary, but a little further on, in an ancient burial ground that brings the dead back to life. The girl has no idea that her cat is dead, though the cat begins acting aggressive after it comes to life.No sooner has this happened, than the family's own son Gage dies on the road. Will the father try and resurrect Gage? Or will he leave him to the familiar human cemetery?I wouldn't say that this film is particularly scary - obviously, it has it's moments, but nothing truly terrifying - although it is suitably creepy. So creepy in fact, and disturbing, that I am only giving it 3 stars. The storyline was good (obviously as it was concocted by Stephen King), though the movie itself seemed to drag just a little. I felt myself growing bored in parts. But also, the idea of it disturbed me a lot. What with the flashback scenes of Zelda and the final scene, I was feeling suitably disgusted, and the movie left me feeling a little strange.I suppose it did what it was supposed to do, but it didn't leave me wanting to buy it or watch it again AT ALL. It moved me, but in entirely the wrong way.If you like really sick storylines and disturbing visuals, I would suggest you watch this film.

The setting in the movie has a real out there feel to it.. because all we really see in the movie is two houses which are separated by one road that frequently has trucks passing by it. The music in the movie also has a real somber tone to it and does a good job of capturing the feel of the movie. Don't let anyone else tell you different this movie is really disturbing, from the little creed son, to the mysterious maid missy, and the grotesque looking sister Zelda. The storyline itself is complex enough however I don't feel like there was enough action and gore in the movie. We wait sometime before anything actually happens. The acting in the movie I felt was really sub par. The two people that play the creed parents do not do a good job of selling that they are actually a couple. When you see both people on screen they do not seem to have enough chemistry to sell their parts. I also felt that the actor that played Mr. Creed did not do a good job. Through out the movie we see him snickering and smiling at times when he shouldn't be smiling, this is one of the biggest flaws of the movie- terrible acting. However the movie brings a high level of scare factor. The character Zelda is down right creepy, and the way they present her in the first flashback that Mrs. creed has of her adds to her scare level. Zelda to me is one of the most disturbing character that I have ever seen in a horror movie.. Even scarier than freddy kueger.. she just gets under your skin. All in all this movie will disturb you and keep you guessing what will happen next.. and stephen king and the director of the movie use good camera techniques to frighten us..

252663,AN7TIQWIXAQ79,6301427076,W. Goring,"[3, 7]","* Warning: Major Spoilers ahead* Watching Pet Semetary has made me understand why Hollywood does remakes. While the title has cache as a brand name and clout by association, originating from the pen of one Stephen King, this 1989 creep show is a strong candidate for re-incarnation. Let me just say that I completely understand the rose coloured glasses with which we sometimes remember films first seen in our youth. Even the best examples of horror, (Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St. and alike) can often look dated, crappy and lame to eyes witnessing them for the first time, many, many years after their release. Sometimes these judgements can be unfair, not considering the time when the film was first relevant. Other times it can give clarity to a film's short coming and missed opportunities. Now, with my self-justifying out of the way, let's turn our attention back to Pet Semetary. Adapted from King's popular novel of the same name, box-office wise this film is probably his most successful page to screen horror adaptation, King even wrote the script. This alone is reason for a remake. It appears as though King may have been too close to the project, as the pace is slow, taking way too much to time to get to the inevitable and the subplots seem pointless. King seemingly didn't have the objectivity to self edit. The Shining and Carrie, while based on King's books were written for the screen by other writers, namely filmmakers, who could cut away the fat and get to the guts of the story all the while keeping a visual language in mind. From the very beginning of Pet Semetary we know the cat will die, the kid will die and everything will go horribly wrong for this generic family. It just takes so long to get there. A remake could pace it up, get to the kid dying quicker, which is the real drama of the story, and maybe spend more time with this evil re-incarnated baby. Another thing a remake could address is the numerous subplots. The whole thing about the wife's complex with death and her strange back story involving a hideously disabled sister can go or be made relevant in some way to the main plot. There's also the seemingly unnecessary feuding between the father and the wife's family which comes to a ridiculously over the top head at the baby's funeral. And what about the freaky house keeper who commits suicide? What was the point of her? Was she some sort of red herring? Perhaps this is all explained and relevant in King's book, but on screen it really doesn't work. I also thought that the resurrecting should have taken place in the actual pet cemetery instead of miles away in the sacred Navajo site. Despite rendering the title pointless, it is hard to believe the father could be convinced to trek all the way to this site not being told where he is going and what will happen there, let alone dragging a body with him. Maybe all this could have been made more palatable had the actors been better. While Fred Gwynne (of The Munsters) is probably the best of a bad bunch, the rest are terrible, especially the mother (Denise Crosby of Star Trek the Next Gen.) and who ever the little girl was who played the whinging brat of a daughter, she should have been the one hit by the truck!

And as opposed to most Stephen King flics, which are usually half or one-star disasters, the movie, Pet Sematary is actually just as good, if not better than the novel and follows the novel very accurately.The actors used in the movie are just the way that I imagined them being in the book: down-to-earth family people, but interesting and solid.  As far as I could tell, there were no inaccuracies between the novel and the movie and the few parts of the book that the movie may have omitted were unimportant, non-suspenseful sections.  In a nutshell, the acting was great, the suspense was even better than in the book, and this is probably the best King film that I have ever seen.",4,Very accurate rendition of the novel.,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,839,"['Reiterating', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'quot', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'suspenseful', 'books', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'opposed', 'most', 'Stephen', 'King', 'flics', 'are', 'usually', 'half', 'one-star', 'disasters', 'movie', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'actually', 'just', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'novel', 'novel', 'very', 'accurately.The', 'actors', 'used', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'imagined', 'being', 'book', 'down-to-earth', 'family', 'people', 'interesting', 'solid', 'As', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'inaccuracies', 'novel', 'movie', 'few', 'parts', 'book', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'omitted', 'were', 'unimportant', 'non-suspenseful', 'sections', 'nutshell', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'suspense', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'book', 'probably', 'best', 'King', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A
