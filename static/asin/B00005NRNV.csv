669918,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,B00005NRNV,A Customer,"[2, 4]","I enjoy taking my (now) 8 year-old daughter to kid movies. Most are done so as to be entertaining for adults with parts we can enjoy that go over a kids head. (I didn't get some references in Bugs Bunny cartoons until I was in my 30's). That's why I looked forward to seeing Dr. Doolittle 2 (I almost understand everything now). The commercials looked funny and Eddie Murphy (Saturday Night Live, Trading Places) cracks me up.My daughter and her friend liked this movie. I was disappointed but ""it's really the kids opinions that count"". (Her words to me just now editing my work). I did not see the first one (my daughter did). She said he was very funny in it but she wanted to know more about the animals and enjoyed Dr. Doolittle 2 much more. I can only imagine Murphy as Dr. Doolittle in the first movie and his facial expressions as animals start talking to him. Eddie Murphy can convey humor with just a look. In this one, it's ho-hum...what do you want and the animals take it from there.It is now known that that Dr. Doolittle can talk to animals. It opens with him scheduling patients (I couldn't tell if he was a vet or people doctor) with his nurse and dog, who is voiced by another Saturday Night alumnus, Norm MacDonald. People wait outside his home with their pets, hoping to get translations. He is in demand. From helping zoo tortoises with their sex lives by prescribing viagra to appearing with the Croc Hunter on TV (cameo by Steve Irwin). This is taking its toll on his family relations.The plot involves a visit to his home by a goodfella raccoon (Michael Rappaport) who gets Doolittle to attend a meeting in the woods with The Beaver, a Mafi uhhh, business man who makes him an offer he can't refuse. That is, to save their forest from being cut down. They can stop it if they find an endangered species, which they do in the form of a bear. Two bears actually, they just need to get them together to breed.The catch is that the male, Archie (Steve Zahn) is a circus bear, never having lived in the wild. Doolittles job being to get him to agree to go, which he does after showing him pictures of the female bear. They didn't do a thing for me. Either did her voice (Lisa Kudrow). Now, I hear that lady monkey in Planet of the Apes is pretty hot. Hubba hubba..ummm Where was I??? Oh yeah.. The hardest part is teaching him to survive in the woods in the short time allotted by the court.The computer generated facial expressions and mouth movements are great, making you almost believe these real animals are talking. The animals also get all the funny lines, which unfortunately, I had already seen on the trailer. After returning home from this movie, the lines that my daughter repeated to my wife as she told her about it were the same ones shown on TV...""Bigger than Pooh?""..They're gonna be saying Winnie the Who?"".Eddie Murphy pretty much plays the straight man to the animals. Explaining hybernation to Archie, the bear asks how he'll go to the bathroom. Doolittle says he'll have to eat dirt and things to...well, block it off. Archie then says ""butt plug"" a bunch of times, much to the delight of the kids (as well as a few of us adults). Besides the butt plug thing there's a bear on a toilet scene as well as sexual innuendos that may make you cringe if you are with your child. Nothing too bad though.Doolittles wife (Kristen Wilson) and two daughers are back (my daughter says they were in the first one). Then oldest (Raven Symone) has a boyfriend which gives Murphy some good protective Dad moments. I took notes.Dr. Doolittle 2 as I said, is a kids movie. If not for my daughter (and matinees), I would have regretted paying (I can't believe the price of popcorn these days) to see it. It was cute and my daughter and her friend enjoyed it. But, it didn't rivet them to their seats. Towards the ending, while the animals were convincing the logger and his lawyer to back off, the girls had to go to the ladies room and wouldn't wait. As we left, a mother was also escorting her child. After they finished and emerged, I escorted them back the the theater, just in time for the final credits.They were not upset at missing the end and said ""That's OK...we'll see it on the video.....Video??...I gotta buy the video??...Dr. Do Who??""....My recommendation: Dr. Doolittle 2 was worth seeing only because of the children and will be a good one to rent or buy on video for them. Otherwise wait for it to be shown on TV.",3,Dr Do Who?,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,4453,"['enjoy', 'taking', 'now', '8', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'kid', 'movies', 'Most', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'be', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'parts', 'can', 'enjoy', 'go', 'kids', 'head', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'references', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoons', 'was', '30', 'why', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', '2', 'almost', 'understand', 'everything', 'now', 'commercials', 'looked', 'funny', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Trading', 'Places', 'cracks', 'up.My', 'daughter', 'friend', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'really', 'kids', 'opinions', 'count', 'words', 'just', 'now', 'editing', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'one', 'daughter', 'did', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'animals', 'enjoyed', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', '2', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'Murphy', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'first', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'animals', 'start', 'talking', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'can', 'convey', 'humor', 'just', 'look', 'one', 'ho-hum', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'animals', 'take', 'there.It', 'now', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'can', 'talk', 'animals', 'scheduling', 'patients', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'vet', 'people', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'dog', 'who', 'voiced', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'alumnus', 'Norm', 'MacDonald', 'People', 'wait', 'home', 'pets', 'hoping', 'get', 'translations', 'demand', 'helping', 'zoo', 'tortoises', 'sex', 'lives', 'prescribing', 'viagra', 'appearing', 'Croc', 'Hunter', 'TV', 'cameo', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'taking', 'toll', 'family', 'relations.The', 'plot', 'visit', 'home', 'goodfella', 'raccoon', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'who', 'Doolittle', 'attend', 'meeting', 'woods', 'Beaver', 'Mafi', 'uhhh', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'save', 'forest', 'being', 'cut', 'down', 'can', 'stop', 'find', 'endangered', 'species', 'do', 'form', 'bear', 'Two', 'bears', 'actually', 'just', 'need', 'get', 'together', 'breed.The', 'catch', 'male', 'Archie', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'circus', 'bear', 'never', 'having', 'lived', 'wild', 'Doolittles', 'job', 'being', 'get', 'agree', 'go', 'showing', 'pictures', 'female', 'bear', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'thing', 'did', 'voice', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Now', 'hear', 'lady', 'monkey', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'pretty', 'hot', 'Hubba', 'hubba..ummm', 'Where', 'was', 'Oh', 'hardest', 'part', 'teaching', 'survive', 'woods', 'short', 'time', 'allotted', 'court.The', 'computer', 'generated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mouth', 'movements', 'are', 'great', 'making', 'almost', 'believe', 'real', 'animals', 'are', 'talking', 'animals', 'also', 'get', 'funny', 'lines', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'trailer', 'returning', 'home', 'movie', 'lines', 'daughter', 'repeated', 'wife', 'told', 'were', 'same', 'ones', 'shown', 'TV', 'Bigger', 'Pooh', '..They', ""'re"", 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'saying', 'Winnie', 'Who', '.Eddie', 'Murphy', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'man', 'animals', 'Explaining', 'hybernation', 'Archie', 'bear', 'how', ""'ll"", 'go', 'bathroom', 'Doolittle', ""'ll"", 'have', 'eat', 'dirt', 'things', 'well', 'block', 'off', 'Archie', 'then', 'butt', 'plug', 'bunch', 'times', 'much', 'delight', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'adults', 'butt', 'plug', 'thing', 'bear', 'toilet', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'may', 'make', 'cringe', 'are', 'child', 'Nothing', 'too', 'bad', 'though.Doolittles', 'wife', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'two', 'daughers', 'are', 'back', 'daughter', 'were', 'first', 'one', 'Then', 'oldest', 'Raven', 'Symone', 'boyfriend', 'Murphy', 'good', 'protective', 'Dad', 'moments', 'took', 'notes.Dr', 'Doolittle', '2', 'said', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'daughter', 'matinees', 'would', 'have', 'regretted', 'paying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'price', 'popcorn', 'days', 'see', 'was', 'cute', 'daughter', 'friend', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'rivet', 'seats', 'ending', 'animals', 'were', 'convincing', 'logger', 'lawyer', 'back', 'off', 'girls', 'had', 'go', 'ladies', 'room', 'would', ""n't"", 'wait', 'left', 'mother', 'was', 'also', 'escorting', 'child', 'finished', 'emerged', 'escorted', 'back', 'theater', 'just', 'time', 'final', 'credits.They', 'were', 'not', 'upset', 'missing', 'end', 'said', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'see', 'video', '..Video', 'got', 'ta', 'buy', 'video', 'Dr', 'Do', 'Who', '.My', 'recommendation', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', '2', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'rent', 'buy', 'video', 'Otherwise', 'wait', 'be', 'shown', 'TV']",N/A

Thing is, I found it almost as funny myself!Surprisingly, this turned out to be better (in my opinion) than the first Dr. D.There are times when the actions of the animals don't seem to fluidly match their speech and intended emotions, but hey, it's to be expected.  As is typical with a movie intended for the younger generation, there is plenty of bodily humor, though some of the narrative almost borders on the adult when referring to sex.  It never goes overboard though, and while it may never become a classic in the sense of the book, you'll end up with a contented sigh by the time the film comes to an end.",4,Who says sequels don't get better?,1008806400,"12 20, 2001",2001,762,"['19', 'year-old', '3', 'younger', 'brothers', 'would', 'say', 'worth', 'getting', 'movie', 'just', 'watch', 'hysterical', 'reactions', 'younger', 'kids', 'Thing', 'found', 'almost', 'funny', 'Surprisingly', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'opinion', 'first', 'Dr.', 'D.There', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'actions', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fluidly', 'match', 'speech', 'intended', 'emotions', 'hey', 'be', 'expected', 'typical', 'movie', 'intended', 'younger', 'generation', 'plenty', 'bodily', 'humor', 'narrative', 'almost', 'borders', 'adult', 'when', 'referring', 'sex', 'never', 'overboard', 'may', 'never', 'become', 'classic', 'sense', 'book', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'contented', 'sigh', 'time', 'film', 'end']",N/A
669920,AV8VLS7ZPUPUQ,B00005NRNV,Carol Tessen,"[1, 2]","The movie opens in San Francisco with Dr. Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) and wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson) celebrating their 16-year old daughter's birthday.  Daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone) has developed an attitude about sharing her birthday with her family and also seems to be troubled by something, but won't tell her parents what it is.  While the dinner/party goes on, Dr. Dolittle is summoned first by a opossum then by a raccoon, to go see The Beaver (the animal kingdom's equivalent of the Mafia).  The doc, raccoon and opossum go to see The Beaver in the country and doc learns that the animals are upset because the humans are cutting down their home.  A bad guy named Joseph Potter is cutting down all the woods because there is money to be made in the process.  Doc's wife is a lawyer who says that one way to stop Potter is to prove there is an endangered species living in the wooded area.  Enter Archie, a circus bear raised by humans, and Ava, a wild bear living in the woods.  Archie and Ava are rare Pacific Western bears and if Dr. Dolittle can get them together, the woods will be saved as the two bears will be living there.  The good doctor sets about teaching Archie the ways of the wild in the hopes that Ava will fall for him.  There is one set-back after another with the re-training of Archie and also a pleasant surprise for Dolittle regarding his daughter, Charisse.There are many entertaining and funny moments in this movie but I think it falls a little short of the original.  Even though I believe the first Dr. Dolittle is better, this movie is definitely worth buying, as any Eddie Murphy movie is.

My only problem is that as usual, a ferret is portraying a weasel.  Although ferrets are very closely related to them, It was a bit silly on why they didn't just get a weasel.

This time Dr. Doolittle displays an interest in environmental issues, as he tries to save the forest by playing matchmaker between Ava, a bear in the wild, and Archie, a circus bear who has gotten soft and is trying to get used to living in the wild. Ultimately, Dr. Dolittle is victorious over the corporate expansionists who sought to decimate the forest.There are some very amusing moments in the film with the animals. There are also some funny moments as Dr. Dolittle tries to cope with his sixteen year old daughter just being a teenager. Much to his delight and surprise, however, it turns out that she appears to have inherited his unique ability to communicate with animals.",3,THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE...,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,823,"['mildly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'reprising', 'original', 'role', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'interest', 'environmental', 'issues', 'save', 'forest', 'playing', 'matchmaker', 'Ava', 'bear', 'wild', 'Archie', 'circus', 'bear', 'who', 'gotten', 'soft', 'trying', 'get', 'used', 'living', 'wild', 'Ultimately', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'victorious', 'corporate', 'expansionists', 'who', 'sought', 'decimate', 'forest.There', 'are', 'very', 'amusing', 'moments', 'film', 'animals', 'are', 'also', 'funny', 'moments', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'cope', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'just', 'being', 'teenager', 'Much', 'delight', 'surprise', 'however', 'out', 'have', 'inherited', 'unique', 'ability', 'communicate', 'animals']",N/A
669931,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B00005NRNV,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[1, 2]","I love Eddie Murphy, and I loved Dr. Doolittle!  The previews of Dr. D II looked so funny, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, I just saw it, and my mind has still not recovered.Dr. Doolittle 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it.  The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer.  To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it.  Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not.The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer.  His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear.  And talk about long.  This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain.  And the other animals!  A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear.  When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge.A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights.  Murphy actually acquieses.  What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable.It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film.  It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them.",1,Extremely Disappointing,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,1862,"['love', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'loved', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'previews', 'Dr.', 'D', 'II', 'looked', 'so', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Well', 'just', 'saw', 'mind', 'still', 'not', 'recovered.Dr', 'Doolittle', '2', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'dialouge', 'are', 'so', 'mind-numbing', 'even', 'animated', 'Murphy', 'Raven', 'Symone', 'who', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'could', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'story', 'around', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'trying', 'save', 'patch', 'forest', 'house', 'land-hungry', 'developer', 'do', 'Doolittle', 'must', 'rehab', 'tame', 'bear', 'make', 'wild', 'bear', 'endangered', 'species', 'forest', 'developer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'kind', 'cute', 'not.The', 'bear', 'acts', 'sounds', 'washed', 'up', 'Vegas', 'lounge', 'singer', 'whiny', 'voice', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'so', 'annoying', 'even', 'passionate', 'animal', 'lover', 'could', 'not', 'summon', 'shred', 'sympathy', 'bear', 'talk', 'long', 'whole', 'thin', 'storyline', 'dragged', 'out', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'writhed', 'pain', 'other', 'animals', 'sad', 'alcoholic', 'French', 'monkey', 'chamelon', 'horrible', 'Mexican', 'accent', 'abusive', 'bear', 'passive', 'female', 'bear', 'When', 'bear', 'not', 'whining', 'dog', 'narrating', 'whole', 'film', 'nasal', 'bland', 'voice', 'HORRIBLE', 'dialouge.A', 'subplot', 'daughter', 'rebelling', 'liking', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'complete', 'idiot', 'dropped', 'off', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'car', 'stay', 'two', 'nights', 'Murphy', 'actually', 'What', 'intelligent', 'lovely', 'girl', 'Raven', 'would', 'see', 'sorry', 'homie', 'completely', 'unbelievable.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'people', 'animals', 'are', 'going', 'hungry', 'when', 'millions', 'were', 'wasted', 'fart', 'film', 'seemed', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'embarrased', 'be', 'saying', 'such', 'stupid', 'dialouge', 'animal', 'actors', 'were', 'embarrased', 'be', 'acting', 'such', 'stupid', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame']",N/A

669933,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005NRNV,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","One critic called Dr. Doolittle 2 an unnecessary sequel. What was the guy thinking? Any time a studio has a huge hit, as the original Doolittle certainly was, the idea of a franchise comes up. Sometimes this isn't possible. Titanic, for instance, ends with the ship's sinking and the hero's drowning. End of story. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if a Hollywood executive or two hasn't lost sleep trying to figure out a way to make Titanic II. Sequels are among the movie's most reliable income producers. It doesn't matter if the original itself wasn't very good. If the public bought enough tickets, then rented enough videos, that's all the reason a studio needs to try and recreate, if the magic, then the revenue.Eddie Murphy is back as John Doolittle. He hasn't lost his ability to talk to animals; in fact, his days are filled with talking animals as well as people. I don't know how he copes. His bickering family would be enough for most men to deal with. One day a raccoon comes to his door and tells him that he needs to come to a nearby forest logging company is about to destroy. Doolittle discovers that there is an endangered species of bear in the forest. When the doctor runs across a trained male bear named Archie [voice of Steve Zahn] in a circus, he obtains a court order which allows him thirty days to see if Archie will mate with Ava [Lisa Kudrow], the bear living in he woods. Archie doesn't like the idea of life in the wild. He much prefers city life. Ava, easily the smartest mammal in the movie, doesn't think Archie can be much of a provider. Doolittle and his animal pals must persuade the reluctant couple that the other forest creatures are depending on them.The plot is as silly as it is unoriginal, but there are amusing moments and enough cute, cuddly critters to keep the kids happy for an hour and a half.There could have been no sequel without Eddie Murphy, who starred in the original. While he plays the part with his usual good cheer, there sadly isn't enough focus on him. He is, after all, one of the great comic actors of his generation. Here the animals get most of the attention and the laughs, giving Murphy little choice but to be little more than the world's highest paid straight man.Dr. Doolittle 2 continues Hollywood's current obsession with jokes about lower digestion tract functions. Current thinking among child psychologists is that it's healthy for children to be open about their bodies. Maybe so, but does that mean we also have to teach them that it's fine to laugh at the crudest humor? All I know for sure is that I have become bored by this trend in movies. I hope that scriptwriter's will soon.",2,I couldn't Bear it!,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2660,"['One', 'critic', 'called', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', '2', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', 'What', 'was', 'guy', 'thinking', 'time', 'studio', 'huge', 'hit', 'original', 'Doolittle', 'certainly', 'was', 'idea', 'franchise', 'up', 'Sometimes', ""n't"", 'possible', 'Titanic', 'instance', 'ship', 'sinking', 'hero', 'drowning', 'End', 'story', 'Still', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Hollywood', 'executive', 'two', ""n't"", 'lost', 'sleep', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'Titanic', 'II', 'Sequels', 'are', 'movie', 'most', 'reliable', 'income', 'producers', ""n't"", 'matter', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'public', 'bought', 'enough', 'tickets', 'then', 'rented', 'enough', 'videos', 'reason', 'studio', 'try', 'recreate', 'magic', 'then', 'revenue.Eddie', 'Murphy', 'back', 'John', 'Doolittle', ""n't"", 'lost', 'ability', 'talk', 'animals', 'fact', 'days', 'are', 'filled', 'talking', 'animals', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'bickering', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'most', 'men', 'deal', 'One', 'day', 'raccoon', 'door', 'come', 'nearby', 'forest', 'logging', 'company', 'destroy', 'Doolittle', 'endangered', 'species', 'bear', 'forest', 'When', 'doctor', 'trained', 'male', 'bear', 'named', 'Archie', '[', 'voice', 'Steve', 'Zahn', ']', 'circus', 'court', 'order', 'thirty', 'days', 'see', 'Archie', 'will', 'mate', 'Ava', '[', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', ']', 'bear', 'living', 'Archie', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'life', 'wild', 'much', 'prefers', 'city', 'life', 'Ava', 'easily', 'smartest', 'mammal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'think', 'Archie', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'provider', 'Doolittle', 'animal', 'pals', 'must', 'persuade', 'reluctant', 'couple', 'other', 'forest', 'creatures', 'are', 'depending', 'them.The', 'plot', 'as', 'silly', 'unoriginal', 'are', 'amusing', 'moments', 'enough', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'critters', 'keep', 'kids', 'happy', 'hour', 'half.There', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sequel', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'starred', 'original', 'part', 'usual', 'good', 'cheer', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'enough', 'focus', 'one', 'great', 'comic', 'actors', 'generation', 'Here', 'animals', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'laughs', 'giving', 'Murphy', 'little', 'choice', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'world', 'highest', 'paid', 'straight', 'man.Dr', 'Doolittle', '2', 'Hollywood', 'current', 'obsession', 'jokes', 'lower', 'digestion', 'tract', 'functions', 'Current', 'thinking', 'child', 'psychologists', 'healthy', 'children', 'be', 'open', 'bodies', 'Maybe', 'so', 'mean', 'also', 'have', 'teach', 'fine', 'laugh', 'crudest', 'humor', 'know', 'sure', 'have', 'become', 'bored', 'trend', 'movies', 'hope', 'scriptwriter', 'will', 'soon']",N/A

669935,A1OH2SIJ0U46Q6,B00005NRNV,"""patsydoc""","[4, 4]","""Dr. Dolittle 2"" was a cute movie.  It was definitely better that it's prequel and it actually had a good plot:  A logging company wants to tear down hundreds of acres of forest-- leaving the animals that live there homeless.  Dr. Dolittle (with the help of his animal friends) comes up with a plot to save the forest!  An endangered species of bears lives in the forest,  but there is only one...a female.  In order to save the forest, Dr. Dolittle must successfully mate the female with another male of the same species.  There's a catch-- the only male available is a tamed circus bear!  Dr. Dolittle has one month to turn ""Wayne Newton with fur"" into a real outdoor bear and get him to mate with the female.Anyway, the story is pretty cute so the film was definitely enjoyable.  What made the movie really fun, of course, were the talking animals!  How can you go wrong with talking animals?!  Steve Zahn voices the totally funny (and goofy) Archie, the tame dancing bear, while Lisa Kudrow voices Eva, the female bear.  There were lots of other talking animals (of course) but I'm not sure about did the voices.  I think Arnold Schwarzenegger was actually the voice of the Alpha Wolf, Joey Lauren Adams was the cute little Squirrel, and Andy Dick was the Weasel, but that's all I got.Hmmm.  I don't really have much more to say about the movie.  Eddie Murphy was hilarious as usual, what more can I say?  I love Eddie!  My only complaint: There was a little potty humor (which I don't much like) but not too much to disgust me...it was ok.Recommendation:  ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" is a cute movie with funny talking animals and stars the side-splitting Eddie Murphy.  Unlike most movies of this caliber (talking animals and such) the plot was very interesting and very believable-- assuming you believe the whole understanding animals thing.  Let the kids see this one, it's got a great environmentalist message (save our forests!) and it's very funny.",4,Dr. Dolittle 2 -- Popkorn Junkie's (and my) review,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,1949,"['Dr.', 'Dolittle', '2', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'prequel', 'actually', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'logging', 'company', 'tear', 'down', 'hundreds', 'acres', 'forest', 'leaving', 'animals', 'live', 'there', 'homeless', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'help', 'animal', 'friends', 'up', 'plot', 'save', 'forest', 'endangered', 'species', 'bears', 'lives', 'forest', 'only', 'one', 'female', 'order', 'save', 'forest', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'must', 'successfully', 'mate', 'female', 'male', 'same', 'species', 'catch', 'only', 'male', 'available', 'tamed', 'circus', 'bear', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'one', 'month', 'turn', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'fur', 'real', 'outdoor', 'bear', 'get', 'mate', 'female.Anyway', 'story', 'pretty', 'cute', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'What', 'made', 'movie', 'really', 'fun', 'course', 'were', 'talking', 'animals', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'talking', 'animals', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'totally', 'funny', 'goofy', 'Archie', 'tame', 'dancing', 'bear', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'voices', 'Eva', 'female', 'bear', 'were', 'lots', 'other', 'talking', 'animals', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'voices', 'think', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'was', 'actually', 'voice', 'Alpha', 'Wolf', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'was', 'cute', 'little', 'Squirrel', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'was', 'Weasel', 'got.Hmmm', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'movie', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'hilarious', 'usual', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'Eddie', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'little', 'potty', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'disgust', 'was', 'ok.Recommendation', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', '2', 'cute', 'movie', 'funny', 'talking', 'animals', 'side-splitting', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'most', 'movies', 'caliber', 'talking', 'animals', 'such', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'believable', 'assuming', 'believe', 'whole', 'understanding', 'animals', 'thing', 'Let', 'kids', 'see', 'one', 'got', 'great', 'environmentalist', 'message', 'save', 'forests', 'very', 'funny']",N/A
