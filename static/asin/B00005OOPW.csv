But when I was 10 getting up on a Saturday morning to watch it the American version is what I saw and I couldn't get enough of it. I didn't buy this DVD to get the Japanese version although they are very interesting and I do like them more. But I bought it as something from my youth. A show that I just couldn't get enough of and something to share with my kids. Sure 7-Zark-7 is campy beyond belief. But I don't mind. For now I will show kids the American version with it's more family ideals and when they are a little older they can watch whichever version they want. I was just happy that the Americans did a version.

672780,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00005OOPW,D. Knouse,"[26, 27]","When I first saw this for sale I was absolutely giddy with excitement.  One of the greatest shows of my childhood was now available on DVD!  I got it home and popped it in and...&quot;I don't remember it being this lame?&quot;  For what it's worth, there were some nostalgic moments.  One, was finally seeing my heroes in their colorful costumes saving the day and another was hearing Key-op talk in his very funny way, &quot;Brrrrrr-toot-toot!&quot;  But after that I thought everything else was fairly second-rate.  It's amazing what glorious images I can conjure in my memory of this show, and how the reality of my adult perspective shatters all the charm it once held.  However, there are the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; episodes, which is the only feature of this DVD that saves it from being a complete failure.  While &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; is broken up with freeze-framing and the intensely annoying 7-Zark-7 filling in plot holes with voice-over narration, not to mention his equally annoying companion 1-Rover-1 doing his side-show antics, the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; episodes flow more fluidly with more action and acceptable violence.  If I had known better I would have bought only the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; episodes.  It just fits the ideas better that they speak in Japanese.  I've seen enough Japanese animation to know that more things are possible in the hyper-reality of their highly creative shows than in the saccharin-based shows of America where the violence is tempered, if shown at all. Something that I recently noticed about world-wide animation is that virtualy all the characters are caucasian.  Being white, I guess I just never noticed.  Most Japanese animation, in particular, has a tendency toward white Americanized heroes.  It might be because we are the largest consumer nation in the world, but this is not a new trend.  Just like the cutting-edge animation from Japan like &quot;Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within,&quot; the show &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; has an all-white cast.  It's just an interesting, cultural note, one that makes more sense these days than in days past.  Anyway, get the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; series on DVD if you must insist on purchasing anything for nostalgia's sake.  I got this out of a deep-seeded feeling of nostalgia, and I was disappointed overall.

672782,A1YIGQWYB2WN4R,B00005OOPW,"Michelle S. ""Michelle""","[5, 5]","After years of waiting, ""Battle of the Planets"" has finally reached DVD! Now, you can re-live those weekday afternoons from the late 70's, when you raced home from school to catch the daring exploits of Ken, Joe, Jun....er....Mark, Jason, Princess, Keyop, and Tiny! (Yay!)As you surely know, ""Battle of the Planets"" was the title given to Sandy Frank's re-working of the Japanese ""Gatchaman"" series. The violence of the original series was toned (way) down and new animation was made to compensate for the edits. In order to capitalize on the then-current Star Wars boom, ""7-Zark-7 (an R2-D2 clone) was created and appears in most of the new footage. ""Zark"" served as the team's coordinator, the show's narrator, and he would explain away plot holes that occurred due to the large amount of film that was trimmed away by the producers.The picture quality of the Battle of the Planets episodes is very good! For a show that must have been mastered from 16mm prints, the images are fairly sharp and the colors are good. (In the 70's, syndicated TV shows were all 16mm - only networks used 35mm). Episodes that originally had teasers before the opening credits are complete with the teasers!The production values of BOTP are quite high. Obviously, the producers spent a lot of money getting this show made.The voice actors used in the making of BOTP were the best in their field at the time. Casey Kasem, Janet Waldo, Keye Luke, and Alan Young are all professionals and must not have come cheap. They handle the (sometimes silly) scripts very well and really enhance the series. Compare the voice work on this series to other shows of the same era (like Force Five) to see how good it is!Another thing BOTP has going for it is the music. In addition to the original music composed for Gatchaman (by Bob Sakuma), Sandy Frank employed the services of Hoyt Curtin. Mr. Curtin, mostly known for his classic Hanna Barbera scores (like Jonny Quest & The Flintstones), composed BOTP's theme music and other incidental music cues used throughout the series. The fully-orchestrated scores are stirring and memorable.Overall, this DVD set is a great value! In addition to two classic Battle of the Planets episodes, you get the original Gatchaman episodes the BOTP episodes were based on. You also get one episode of the mid-80's ""G-Force"" series. You can now see Gatchaman in all of its various forms!The Gatchaman episodes are a nice addition to the set and really enhance the collection. As you obviously know, Zark is nowhere to be seen, and the stories tend to be more intense than the cleaned-up BOTP episodes. For someone who doesn't have warm and fuzzy memories of Battle of the Planets, you'll probably prefer Gatchaman.Generally, the Gatchaman episodes look great, but there are a couple of problems with the presentation of them...First of all, the mastering is a bit suspect in places. Some scenes appear dark and murky. While I expect less than 100% print quality for the 16mm BOTP episodes, Gatchaman was originally mastered in 35mm for Japanese network television, so the picture quality should be better. When Gatchaman was released in Japan on LD and DVD the transfers were excellent. I only wish Rhino employed the same quality control here.The other weak aspect of the Gatchaman episodes is the English translation. While it does allow the viewer to follow the action fairly well, it seems more like a fan-produced work than that of a professional. The person who prepared the translation obviously had a good Japanese-to-English dictionary, but not a very good understanding of the Japanese language itself. As a result, the translation is stiff and unnatural. It lacks nuance and style. (There are also a few places throughout the episodes that weren't translated at all...)The second ""bonus"" on each disk is one episode of the mid-80's version of Gatchaman, ""G-Force"". Unless this is the version you grew up with, I doubt you will watch it much. While the episodes themselves are less edited than BOTP, the production values are extremely poor. The voice ""actors"" used here are laughably bad and they seem genetically incapable of showing any kind of emotion at all. The ""music"" employed in this series sounds like it was composed by someone on a cheap Casio keyboard. And if you can't get enough of the show's monotonous electronic theme, you're really in for a treat - the same theme music is used throughout each episode...! Watching an episode of ""G-Force"" is like a stamina contest. Congratulations if you succeed!... decry the Sandy Frank version of Gatchaman. This is unfair as Battle of the Planets and Gatchaman should be treated as different series. You will not enjoy BOTP if you keep comparing it to Gatchaman. Sure, lots of it was edited out. The new animation is crummy compared to the animation used in the original. The stories seem sometimes childish. But that's not the point. Battle of the Planets is a nostalgia treat for most of us who grew up during the 70's. Watching these DVDs is a real blast from the past and if you liked the show then, you will still like it now!",4,Zark!

It was nice to see the ""G-Force"" team in action after some 20 years. The episodes are great, that is until you watch the original ""Gatchaman"" episodes on which they were based. Then you realize just how much your childhood viewing experience was shortchanged.Put simply, the American version pales in comparison.  As a viewer, you will get to see just how how much drama, action and pathos were excised from these cartoons because of violence concerns by U.S. broadcasters. Many of those edited scenes were replaced with narration by ""7-Zark-7"", an ""R2D2"" rip-off created  to capitalize on  ""Star Wars"" which had been released a year or so earlier.  Watching some two decades later, you realize just how jarring this proved to the show's pacing. ""Gatchaman,"" however, moves at a more rapid clip.I almost forgot to mention, that ""Gatchaman"" was set on Earth and there were no 'battles' with other planets.  That said, you also realize just how awkward the premise of ""Battle of the Planets,"" was.  I gave the DVD 5 stars, but only for the ""Gatchaman"" episodes.",5,A big surprise,1006992000,"11 29, 2001",2001,1190,"['ordered', 'Vol', '1', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'DVD', 'wanting', 're-live', 'childhood', 'memories', 'watching', 'show', 'school', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'G-Force', 'team', 'action', '20', 'years', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'original', 'Gatchaman', 'episodes', 'were', 'based', 'Then', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'childhood', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'shortchanged.Put', 'simply', 'American', 'version', 'pales', 'comparison', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'how', 'much', 'drama', 'action', 'pathos', 'were', 'excised', 'cartoons', 'violence', 'concerns', 'U.S.', 'broadcasters', 'Many', 'edited', 'scenes', 'were', 'replaced', 'narration', '7-Zark-7', 'R2D2', 'rip-off', 'created', 'capitalize', 'Star', 'Wars', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'year', 'so', 'earlier', 'Watching', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'jarring', 'proved', 'show', 'pacing', 'Gatchaman', 'however', 'moves', 'more', 'rapid', 'clip.I', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'Gatchaman', 'was', 'set', 'Earth', 'were', ""'battles"", 'other', 'planets', 'said', 'also', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'awkward', 'premise', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'was', 'gave', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'Gatchaman', 'episodes']",N/A
