Beauty is foaled on the Evans farm with Joe (Mark Lester), the farmer's young son, standing by, and is given to Joe to be his own; as the young stallion grows, it's Joe who takes the primary role in training him.  But Evans is an independent farmer, not a tenant, and when he gets in trouble with the bank, there's no one to insure that he keeps his land or his stock; Beauty is sold for the debt along with everyone else.  Joe swears to get him back one day, but the road to that goal is hard.  Beauty falls into the hands of a young wastrel who is killed in a fall from his dogcart, is stolen by an Irish tinker who rides him in a stake race, then abandoned, picked up by horse traders, and taken to the Continent to be sold to a small circus.  From there he goes on to become a cavalry horse in India (not very likely: Rudyard Kipling tells us that most of the horses in that service came from Australia) and a coal-merchant's drudge.  Despite his changes in fortune, there's very little sense of engagement--I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for his situation--and nothing of the horsy friendships Sewell gives him (no Ginger or Merrylegs, for example).  Even the owners who don't treat him right seem less malicious than merely uncaring.  The sense of place is good--costumes and props do give an authentic picture of Victorian England--but if you want a film adaptation of the novel, you'll be much better off with the one that was made 23 years laterBlack Beauty.

220779,A1ZZ2EB6FCY8MW,6300216306,"Staci L. Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[22, 26]","There have been several versions of Black Beauty produced for the cinema and for television. One of the weakest versions is the 1971 British production, which focuses much more on its parade of human characters than it does the horse. In the book and several of the movie versions, we get to know Beauty. We feel what he feels, and we understand what he is thinking as he passes from owner to owner. Beauty goes from a loving, happy family and life on an English farm with a little boy (Mark Lester) who loves him, to the cruel hands of the local land baron (Patrick Mower). Then he's stolen by Gypsy stereotypes, shipped across the continent, sold to a circus, and gifted to a gentleman who in turn gives the horse to his daughter. The daughter presents Beauty to her lover, who's a soldier headed for India. When the young man is killed in battle, Beauty is shipped back to England, where he goes to work in a coal mine. Instead of the people in the story being the thread woven through the horse's life, in this version it is just the opposite. While a horse called Ginger is mentioned in passing, the colorful equine characters in Beauty's orbit - most notably, Merrylegs - are all excised.Adding insult to injury, the filmmakers made precious little attempt to match the various horses who portrayed Beauty throughout the years. Different shades, different builds, and even completely different breeds were used interchangeably. To a horse-lover, this is on par with a director casting Jack Nicholson, Jackie Chan, and Jacqueline Bisset in the same role and expecting the audience not to notice. The only constant was the extremely shoddy-looking fake star painted on the horse's forehead.Staci Layne Wilson",2,Not the Black Beauty you know and love,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,1712,"['have', 'been', 'several', 'versions', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'produced', 'cinema', 'television', 'One', 'weakest', 'versions', '1971', 'British', 'production', 'much', 'more', 'parade', 'human', 'characters', 'horse', 'book', 'several', 'movie', 'versions', 'get', 'know', 'Beauty', 'feel', 'what', 'understand', 'what', 'thinking', 'owner', 'owner', 'Beauty', 'loving', 'happy', 'family', 'life', 'English', 'farm', 'little', 'boy', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'who', 'cruel', 'hands', 'local', 'land', 'baron', 'Patrick', 'Mower', 'Then', 'stolen', 'Gypsy', 'stereotypes', 'shipped', 'continent', 'sold', 'circus', 'gifted', 'gentleman', 'who', 'turn', 'horse', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'Beauty', 'lover', 'who', 'soldier', 'headed', 'India', 'When', 'young', 'man', 'killed', 'battle', 'Beauty', 'shipped', 'back', 'England', 'where', 'work', 'coal', 'mine', 'Instead', 'people', 'story', 'being', 'thread', 'woven', 'horse', 'life', 'version', 'just', 'opposite', 'horse', 'called', 'Ginger', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'colorful', 'equine', 'characters', 'Beauty', 'orbit', 'most', 'notably', 'Merrylegs', 'are', 'excised.Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'precious', 'little', 'attempt', 'match', 'various', 'horses', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Beauty', 'years', 'Different', 'shades', 'different', 'builds', 'even', 'completely', 'different', 'breeds', 'were', 'used', 'interchangeably', 'horse-lover', 'par', 'director', 'casting', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'same', 'role', 'expecting', 'audience', 'not', 'notice', 'only', 'constant', 'was', 'extremely', 'shoddy-looking', 'fake', 'star', 'painted', 'horse', 'forehead.Staci', 'Layne', 'Wilson']",Black Beauty VHS
