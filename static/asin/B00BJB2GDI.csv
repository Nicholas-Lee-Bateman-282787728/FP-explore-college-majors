But too many of them go for the big kill and never rise above the fray. ""Last Kind Words"" is a quieter, Southern Gothic type outing more concerned with nuance than impact but is so loose it almost dissipates before our eyes.Here's the scoop. Eli moves, with his mom and dad, to a trailer on his uncle's farm, in rural Kentucky, because dad has lost his job. Uncle (a not so creepy Brad Dourif) isn't doing well himself. He's two weeks away from foreclosure. Anyway....Eli becomes infatuated with a local gal which leads to a myriad problems that play out to a sad ending.This is writer/director Kevin Barker's first feature film, and, though there are some good ideas here, he just couldn't pull it off. I like the quiet menace of the film. It's shot well but without pizzazz so it has a natural feel to it which adds to that menace. For my money there was too much going on here. It's as though Barker didn't have enough core story going on and fleshed it out with things that didn't add to the story and were left unresolved. He couldn't bring the core elements together in a powerful enough way. I'd like to applaud that he tried some unconventional points in the plotting but I can't say they worked. Originality is no virtue in its own right. And I can't say I believed it. The story just didn't make enough sense at any level and there is no way I bought into the way it ended.I wanted to like this film, and I did like certain things as they happened.

Many of these movies fall into the extremely competitive genre of horror and suffer from collapsing into the realm of clich&eacute;. ""Last Kind Words"" is one of the rare exceptions to this unfortunate trend.17-year-old Eli (Spencer Daniels) and his family move to the Kentucky backwoods after the father (Clay Wilcox) loses his job. He decides to work on the secluded farm of a childhood friend and recluse (Brad Dourif). Upon exploring the woods near his new home, he meets a girl named Amanda (Alexia Fast) and feels an instant connection to her. His journeys also expose him to a dark secret the dead want restitution for from beyond the grave.It's always a treat when you put in a movie expecting nothing more than a one-dimensional horror yarn but you get so much more. Looking at the cover of ""Last Kind Words,"" you'd think it was just another typical angry ghost flick. Instead, Director / Screenwriter Kevin Barker and Storywriter Amy Riherd Miller fashioned a touching feature that takes a coming-of-age tale and gives it more depth by combining it with an old-fashioned Southern gothic ghost story. It keeps the viewer's interest and slowly leads them to the answers to their own queries without losing any potency along the way.The acting in independent or low-budget films can be questionable at times. That's not the case with ""Last Kind Words."" You can tell every actor in the movie was dedicated to the film and put their best foot forward. Brad Dourif completely embraces his role as the enigmatic hermit and landowner. Spencer Daniels commands every scene he's in. You can see the emotional depth he invested in the role in his eyes. Alexia Fast is passionate as the character of the mysterious and tragic Amanda.""Last Kind Words"" is only available in a regular DVD format. Those looking for a high-definition experience will find this disappointing. While we're addressing unsatisfactory elements of this release, I find it necessary to comment on the lack of special features. This is an independent movie made by filmmakers hungry to tell their stories. I refuse to believe that Director / Screenwriter Kevin Barker and Storywriter Amy Riherd Miller weren't willing to do feature commentary or at least put together a short ""Making of"" featurette.I have a hard time using the term ""horror movie"" to describe ""Last Kind Words."" There's so much more to it than the usual jump scares we're used to getting these days. While the film does provide adequate thrills and chills, they're accompanied and spread throughout a grievous tale of isolationism, selfishness, loss, and the quest for closure.",4,"DVD Review: ""Last Kind Words""",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2719,"['Image', 'Entertainment', 'always', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'outlet', 'get', 'projects', 'masses', 'Many', 'movies', 'fall', 'extremely', 'competitive', 'genre', 'horror', 'suffer', 'collapsing', 'realm', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Last', 'Kind', 'Words', 'one', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'unfortunate', 'trend.17-year-old', 'Eli', 'Spencer', 'Daniels', 'family', 'move', 'Kentucky', 'backwoods', 'father', 'Clay', 'Wilcox', 'job', 'work', 'secluded', 'farm', 'childhood', 'friend', 'recluse', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'exploring', 'woods', 'new', 'home', 'girl', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Alexia', 'Fast', 'instant', 'connection', 'journeys', 'also', 'expose', 'dark', 'dead', 'want', 'restitution', 'grave.It', 'always', 'treat', 'when', 'put', 'movie', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'horror', 'yarn', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Looking', 'cover', 'Last', 'Kind', 'Words', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'just', 'typical', 'angry', 'ghost', 'flick', 'Instead', 'Director', '/', 'Screenwriter', 'Kevin', 'Barker', 'Storywriter', 'Amy', 'Riherd', 'Miller', 'fashioned', 'touching', 'feature', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'more', 'depth', 'combining', 'old-fashioned', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'ghost', 'story', 'viewer', 'interest', 'slowly', 'answers', 'own', 'queries', 'losing', 'potency', 'way.The', 'acting', 'independent', 'low-budget', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'questionable', 'times', 'not', 'case', 'Last', 'Kind', 'Words', 'can', 'tell', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'dedicated', 'film', 'put', 'best', 'foot', 'forward', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'completely', 'role', 'enigmatic', 'hermit', 'landowner', 'Spencer', 'Daniels', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'emotional', 'depth', 'invested', 'role', 'eyes', 'Alexia', 'Fast', 'passionate', 'character', 'mysterious', 'tragic', 'Amanda', 'Last', 'Kind', 'Words', 'only', 'available', 'regular', 'DVD', 'format', 'looking', 'high-definition', 'experience', 'will', 'find', 'disappointing', ""'re"", 'addressing', 'unsatisfactory', 'elements', 'release', 'find', 'necessary', 'comment', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'independent', 'movie', 'made', 'filmmakers', 'hungry', 'tell', 'stories', 'refuse', 'believe', 'Director', '/', 'Screenwriter', 'Kevin', 'Barker', 'Storywriter', 'Amy', 'Riherd', 'Miller', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'do', 'feature', 'commentary', 'least', 'put', 'together', 'short', 'Making', 'featurette.I', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'using', 'term', 'horror', 'movie', 'describe', 'Last', 'Kind', 'Words', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'usual', 'jump', ""'re"", 'used', 'getting', 'days', 'film', 'provide', 'adequate', 'thrills', 'chills', ""'re"", 'accompanied', 'spread', 'grievous', 'tale', 'isolationism', 'selfishness', 'loss', 'quest', 'closure']",Last Kind Words

Unfortunately, the story writing was very self indulgent, maybe the expression of one's imagination with zero appreciation for the audience, or any idea how to make the concept they imagined into a watchable film.The male lead was incredibly dull, hard to tell if it's the actor or the character, but he sets the tone for a meandering, droll affair that only has any life at all when the character of Amanda is on screen. Even here, though, the film never really makes proper use of potential to produce a worthwhile payoff. Remove those scenes and this film is a complete snooze fest.Don't expect any thrills, scares or chills. There is a small amount of creepy and a supernatural element, but the film never achieves anything you look for in any sub-genre of horror.

But sometimes, that is the best way to watch a film...if you go into it with no prior knowledge, then you won't take any preconceived notions with you.  That's exactly what I did with this film; I didn't even read the cover or the press release before I watched it.  And I'm glad, too...this is an excellent film, and it was a nice surprise!This film is striking on several levels.  It is visually appealing, the acting is superb, and the story itself is riveting and original.  You really can't ask for much more in a movie.LAST KIND WORDS is shot very well, and I have to tip my hat to the cinematographer.  There are many haunting shots in this film, and they add greatly to the suspense and the drama.  I would even go so far as to say it is some of the best cinematography I've seen this year.The film has a simplistic feel to it, which is as it should be for a rural Kentucky setting.  But it also has a bleak and vivid sense to it as well; Eli's family life is less than desirable thanks to his father, and this enlivens the drama amidst the tension of the plot.The story of LAST KIND WORDS is the true winner in the film for me, however.  It is a unique ghost story of sorts, and it's final images will linger in your mind for a while after the credits roll.  I particularly like how we, as the audience, realize things are not as they seem...but in a different manner than expected.  This is very good storytelling.If I were forced to find a negative with this film, I don't think I could.  It looks great, it's made well, and it entertains.  This is truly a fun and chilling film.

1635157,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00BJB2GDI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Last Kind Words (Kevin Barker, 2012)When I saw this flick up for grabs on Netflix while I was trolling the ""Popular on Netflix"" queue a couple of weeks ago (I am not ashamed to admit I do this at least once a month), I added it on the off chance that some indie director had taken a crack at adapting a Tom Piccirilli novel to the screen, something that is way overdue. I did so even though I know that any film adaptation of Piccirilli's work would probably not even come close to the original, though I imagine the noir stuff like The Last Kind Words would be easier to adapt than the crazy Southern gothic stuff of his I like even better (A Choir of Ill Children is not only my favorite Piccirilli novel, it is one of my favorite books of all time). And I figured, hey, if it's not Piccirilli, and it's just another DTV picture, what's the most I've got to lose, an hour and a half of a work-from-home Tuesday when I could be watching another equally crappy DTV movie? I tell you all this to give you an idea of the mindset I was in when I hit play on Last Kind Words. I wasn't expecting much, and I hate to admit that as soon as I saw Brad Dourif, I was expecting even less. I love Brad Dourif, always have, but man, it is hard to get the stink of Fading of the Cries out of your head, you know? And so to say Last Kind Words blindsided me would be something of an understatement. But it does make this review quite a bit easier to write, because it gives me a point of comparison. I have a (very) short shelf of the DTV horror flicks that, for my money, should have gotten theatrical releases, because they're a damn sight better than pretty much any horror film that's been turned out by Hollywood in the past decade. Cube is, of course, the one everyone is familiar with, but most horror geeks have probably seen Shallow Ground, DeadBirds, or Pony Trouble!. The real nerds have dug far enough in to have found perhaps the best treasures in the bunch, Baby Blues and Lockout. Now I'm adding Last Kind Words to that short shelf; it stands easily with any of the above. And for the love of Johnson County, it's good to have the old Brad Dourif back!Plot: Bud (Pirates of Silicon Valley's Clay Wilcox), his wife Ida (Stake Land's Marianne Hagan), and his son Eli (Star Trek's Spencer Daniels) have moved back to Bud's rural Kentucky hometown in the wake of some sort of personal shake-up (possibly Bud losing his job, but if it is ever explicitly stated, I don't remember), going to work for Bud's old next-door neighbor Waylon (Dourif). Eli, being teenaged and footloose, is less than thrilled with the arrangement until, while wandering in the woods near Waylon's place, he comes upon Amanda (Repeaters' Alexia Fast), tall, willowy, blonde/redhead, and all the sudden the backwoods are waaaaaaaaay more interesting...even though Eli left a raven-haired love (Please Give beauty Sarah Steele) back in the city. And as if throwing a love triangle into the mix isn't enough, Eli's wandering through the woods starts uncovering more rural Kentucky secrets--things that the locals would rather have stay buried. And to top it all off, it seems that (a) Eli may be replaying some years-earlier drama involving Bud and Waylon, and (b) Waylon is in hock up to his ears to the local loanshark, Mr. Peterson (Hit Me's Rich Williams), who's getting mighty impatient.And you know, I didn't realize it until I started writing that plot synopsis, but we kinda did get a Tom Piccirilli Southern gothic movie here. I wouldn't characterize it as horror in any sense; it is more of that kind-of-indefinable ""supernatural drama"" genre that Asian film industries do so well (Japan, India, and Hong Kong, especially) with a couple of mysteries mixed in beneath the surface. But the real draw, at least for me, ended up being the romance angle, once the city girlfriend was introduced; Barker, adapting a story by Amy Riherd Miller, miffed the plotline a couple of times (he was, erm, less than subtle in the scene where Eli realizes he's in a situation where he probably has to choose, and then, while the ultimate resolution of the love-triangle subplot is all too realistic, and very powerfully shot--for which I should be giving him props, no?--it still feels as if there should have been one more scene there. Even though there probably shouldn't. Watch the movie and see for yourself), but it really stood out for the realism and tenderness with which Barker handled the material. Which carried over into the rest of the movie, really, though how much realism one can reasonably inject into what is, at its heart, a simple ghost story is questionable. That just makes this movie all the more impressive.I think I just talked myself into kicking the rating I originally gave this movie up half a star. Which doesn't sound like much, but to put it in perspective, three-and-a-half star movies are not automatically entered onto my thousand-best list (as of this writing--August 9, 2013--my spreadsheet lists 690 titles to which I've given three and a half stars; 284 of them are on the thousand-best list). Four-star movies are. That's the most important half a star in my movie-ranking hierarchy, when it comes right down to it, and the more I think about the little details in this movie, the more I think it deserves it. This is very, very good stuff, and it deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. See it sooner rather than later. ****",4,GhostBirds.,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,5437,"['Last', 'Kind', 'Words', 'Kevin', 'Barker', '2012', 'When', 'saw', 'flick', 'up', 'grabs', 'Netflix', 'was',

1635160,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B00BJB2GDI,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[17, 18]","""Last Kind Words"" is sort of an old-fashioned ghost story, set in a poor rural area of Kentucky.  It's rather refreshing as it's mostly just normal, regular people, not the usual pretty-boy & pretty-girl cast with big SUV's, and not a single cell phone (with no reception) to be found.  A teenage boy moves with his parents to live in a trailer & do work for the father's childhood friend after the father loses his factory job.  Young Eli discovers a young girl named Amanda on the property, and she is as mysterious as she is beautiful.  Now, the father's childhood friend, Waylon, certainly knows who Amanda is and warns Eli to keep away, but things are not good with Eli & his dad, so naturally Eli is drawn to find something else to do with his time than hang around his folks.  And of course, Amanda is not what she seems but neither is Waylon.There are a few plot holes but nothing too serious, and the locations are appropriately eerie without too much effort.  This is not a fast-paced film so it would not be appreciated by the slice & dice crowd, but anyone that enjoys a decent ghost story will appreciate it.

A few plot holes, it definitely lacked attention to detail in a particular scene and that just left me dumbfounded ( I would elaborate, but then this would become a spoiler ).

The film opens with a scene of a boy shooting his father because of what appears to be a ghost. We then flash forward. Eli (Spencer Daniels) is a teen. When his abusive Pa (Clay Wilcox) loses his job at the factory he moves to the farm of his childhood friend Waylon (Brad Dourif) which is apparently in Kentucky. Here Eli meets Amanda (Alexia Fast) who we become immediately suspect. Eli is also visited by his girlfriend Katie (Sarah Steele) while developing feelings for Amanda.What we don't know is how the opening scene relates to the current situation. In fact I guessed wrong and was confused for much of the film which unravels itself slowly like a good mystery. It is perhaps my own fault as I was expecting a horror story from the cover and not a mystery/drama.The acting was good. The plot was acceptable.

Great acting by Brad Dourif (who is such a fantastic actor) and  the boy and girl, who star in most of the film. The scenery of the film was fantastic, A old tobacco plantation and deep foreboding cemetery.  A little bit of everything was in this film, drama, romance, history, suspense, and undying love. the love between the two of them is very well portrayed, and quite convincing.  just wonder if there were a longer version of this film that may exist that would answer some questions about the film. The last 10 min. of the film showed the girl being pulled away from the boy she loves by tree roots and then she is accosted by the roots. was the action of the roots the previous actions of the landower's love and/or rape of the girl? Were the landowner and girl... brother and sister, and did the boy's father have an affair with the deceased girl, and could they both have been brother and sister?
