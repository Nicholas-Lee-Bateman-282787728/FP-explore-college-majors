1578808,A3I8APG47OVZ1W,B008YRL6WM,Ben Birdwhistell,"[14, 86]","I amazed how many people like to view this series through the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia when in fact this show is not really that old (early 2000's) nor really that good. Let's just go down the list of story elements. Firstly, Is this plot entertaining? No, not really. It stretches out and alters the storyline from the first two volumes of the manga (and that was the bearable portion) and the second half is so inexplicably boring and confusing that I saw no point to any of it. Secondly, are the art style and animation any good? No, not really. There is a lot of unintentional failings in the animation that you begin to notice a lot after the second episode. Characters look like cardboard cutouts, women look like men (I'm so sorry, Integra), and character design elements keep moving around (look for moving scar character). Thirdly, is the action any good? NO! Some of the greatest fight scenes from the first two volumes of the manga are neutered and torn apart to where nothing truly badass can happen in any of these scenes (most likely a result of studio censorship and editing of some fairly graphic content). The only good elements of this show are the jazz score they use for background music and the well-animated opening, and the characters and dubbed voices. The first good thing is not really worth the price of purchase, and while the second positive is truly awesome, here is my rebuttal: these same characters and voices are used in the much better Hellsing Ultimate OVA series. Seriously, this series just feels like an attempt at a neutered, safe version of Kouta Hirano's bats&%t insane gore fest, and when you think about it that way, what's the point of buying this? Either you like this material or you don't. It's as simple as that; And if you like this material, then go watch the real deal. Leave this studio censored bullcrap alone. Go buy the Hellsing Ultimate OVA's. Those I can recommend wholeheartedly. As for this, unless you're just really curious or a real diehard has-to-see-everything Hellsing fan, just give it a pass. This version of Hellsing should have stayed in Geneon hell where it belongs.",2,Don't. Just Don't. Don't waste your money.

1578821,A32T4LCFZ7MP8N,B008YRL6WM,TempledeMuerte,"[0, 1]","There seems to be a bit of fuss over the DVD release of Hellsing (Classic). At least more than there should be anyways. Obviously those that have seen the newer &#34;Hellsing: Ultimate&#34; series have for the most part said they found it to be outstanding. To be quite honest I haven't watched the original series in many years. After finally picking up both of the Blu Ray releases of Ultimate I noticed that they had re-released the classic series as well.First off, the plot in the beginning is relatively similar to Ultimate's. While Ultimate sticks closer to the original manga the classic series begins to deviate and do its own thing shortly before the halfway point. This is where a lot of people began to take issue as they felt the plot just didn't hold up too well in the long run. That of course is subjective, as is the animation style which is a lot less stylish and 'modern.' It looks more like the Gundam Wing series. But what can you do? It's an older show. It really is worth at least a watch. At the current price ($20 or so) it's a steal. 300 minutes of blood drenched action and if nothing else it provides insight into an alternate take on the Hellsing universe. The final verdict? Hellsing Ultimate is far superior indeed, in fact if you haven't seen it I strongly recommend you pick up Volumes I-IV and V-VIII first and then go back and watch the classic series. The two series don't go hand-in-hand plot wise so you can technically watch them in whatever order you prefer. In my honest opinion you should pick up this set as well as the first 8 volumes of Ultimate. Hellsing is hands down one of the best things to happen to the animation world.",5,Different from the vastly superior OVAs.
