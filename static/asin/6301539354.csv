I think it is better than the books, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies that are based on books. If I could change anything I would not have substituted Rachel Lynde in the movie for Mr.Harrison in the book: the scene in the beginning where Anne's cow gets into Rachel's field. For one thing it is sort of inconsistent as Anne and Rachel seemed to have gotten along well after their disagreement with each other when they first meet in the first episode. Also I think they should have included the characters from the book, Paul Irving and Miss Lavender; they were such lovely characters.I enjoyed the Harris family (Emmaline, Pauline, Mrs. Harris and Morgan) but too bad they weren't in the book. Emmaline on the set is the replacement for Elizabeth in the book. I sort of felt sorry for Morgan Harris when he proposed to Anne and she turned him down, but he was obviously not a good choice. She would have been unhappy since he was a womanizer.This is one rare case, though, where the movie turns out better than the book it was based on. This usally doesn't happen, at least in my opinion.

254760,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301539354,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Second of three installments, although at four hours long, it was clearly broadcast by Canadian TV in more than one segment. Not quite as good as the original one I reviewed recently, but very good. This particular sequel was drawn from three of Lucy Maud Montgomer's books, and suffers some from the cutting. Until I see the third one, I will not know if some of the missing parts have been incorporated there, either as events later in Anne's life or as flashbacks. But it certainly has picked out some good stuff. It has also changed some good stuff, and left out a lot of good stuff. Sad, but then it is a large set, seven or eight books, depending on whether you count all the ones which include Anne as a secondary character while her children are growing up.The best part is the time she spent as an English teacher in a snooty private school. I'm not certain here, but I think several elements were borrowed from the time in the books where she was a student in college. The handsome and wealthy older man who pays court to her certainly was, and I think some of the events which took place (falling through the shed roof, for example) in the private school events here were in Avonlea originally.Well, if I say more on that score, I will ruin the movie for you. Let's just say for those who have read the books, don't expect it to match and you will enjoy the story much more. Anne continues her habit of compassion for unlovable people, turning them lovable in the process, and eventually realizes that the same should apply to lovable people. Including, of course, Gilbert Blythe, who is in medical school as the story ends.Since I accidentally ordered the third one before the second one, I happen to know the next movie leaves considerable gap there, but that's OK. Anything left out can indeed be inferred in the first few minutes of the third film, which is how long it took me to realize that I had the third installment and not the second.Even given that this is a completely Canadian story, I'm beginning to think they have a special gift of innocence in storytelling that America used to have.

A more grown-up Anne must martial her strength, as well as her patience, in some very trying situations.  All the while, keeping close to her heart the dear family and friends she left behind.Megan Follows is radiant, cast as the title character.  She skillfully and sensitively portrays a more mature Anne with spunk and grace.  The supporting cast is wonderful, here, too, which features the legendary Dame Wendy Hiller as the cold, unfeeling and domineering old grandmother of one of Anne's students.  This is a great family that viewers, young and old, can enjoy together.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel"", also released as ""Anne of Avonlea"", is the DVD version of Sullivan Entertainment's hugely enjoyable 1987 Canadian television production.  It returns the outstanding cast from ""Anne of Green Gables"", including Megan Follows as red-haired orphan Anne Shirley, Colleen Dewhurst as Anne's foster mother Marilla Cuthbert, and Jonathan Crombie as Anne's friend and admirer Gilbert Blythe.As the story opens, Anne is the Avonlea schoolmarm and an aspiring writer, but still prone to youthful misadventures.  The occasion of her best friend Diana's wedding brings a fateful reckoning.  Gilbert, grown to admirable young manhood, wants more from Anne than her friendship. Anne, fearful of change and clinging to some romanticized notions, makes an anguished refusal of his proposal. Gilbert departs for medical school while Anne decides to take a teaching position at a young woman's school in Kingsport.  There, she will have to earn her place in the face of haughty students and a hostile administrator.  Anne will respond with enthusiasm, wit, and some subtle guile.  She will become close to the Harris family, and meet a man who seems to fit more closely her notion of romance.""The Sequel"" borrows elements from the books ""Anne of Avonlea"", Anne of the Island"", and ""Anne of Windy Poplars"", but recombines them in a new and compressed timeline.  A connecting thread is Anne's relationship with Gilbert.  It is a source of some humor and much dramatic tension that Anne is the one person on PEI who doesn't know that Gilbert is meant to be her soul-mate, and it is her uncertain journey to that knowledge that frames this delightful story.""Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel"" is very highly recommended to fans of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" books and the Sullivan Entertainment ""Anne"" productions.",5,Anne Spreads Her Wings...,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,1828,"['Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Sequel', 'also', 'released', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'DVD', 'version', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', '1987', 'Canadian', 'television', 'production', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'including', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'red-haired', 'orphan', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Anne', 'foster', 'mother', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'Anne', 'friend', 'admirer', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe.As', 'story', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'schoolmarm', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'still', 'prone', 'youthful', 'misadventures', 'occasion', 'best', 'friend', 'Diana', 'wedding', 'fateful', 'reckoning', 'Gilbert', 'grown', 'admirable', 'young', 'manhood', 'more', 'Anne', 'friendship', 'Anne', 'fearful', 'change', 'clinging', 'romanticized', 'notions', 'anguished', 'refusal', 'proposal', 'Gilbert', 'medical', 'school', 'Anne', 'take', 'teaching', 'position', 'young', 'woman', 'school', 'Kingsport', 'will', 'have', 'earn', 'place', 'face', 'haughty', 'students', 'hostile', 'administrator', 'Anne', 'will', 'respond', 'enthusiasm', 'wit', 'subtle', 'guile', 'will', 'become', 'close', 'Harris', 'family', 'meet', 'man', 'who', 'fit', 'more', 'closely', 'notion', 'romance', 'Sequel', 'elements', 'books', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'Anne', 'Island', 'Anne', 'Windy', 'Poplars', 'new', 'compressed', 'timeline', 'connecting', 'thread', 'Anne', 'relationship', 'Gilbert', 'source', 'humor', 'much', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Anne', 'one', 'person', 'PEI', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Gilbert', 'meant', 'be', 'soul-mate', 'uncertain', 'journey', 'knowledge', 'delightful', 'story', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Sequel', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'books', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'Anne', 'productions']",N/A

In fact, Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) has become more soft with Anne and has decided to bring in a *new young girl as a border to allow Anne to have time for her other projects.

The baking powder sponsors loved it and Anne won the prize, howvever Anne was the last to know and since the whole town knew before she did, Diana finally confessed.Anne also has feelings for Gilbert (Jonathan Crombie), but is afraid to show that in front of him.  First she is polite, then she puts up her guard and gets angry.  At home, she cries to Marilla about her feelings for Gilbert.  Anne is doing the right thing.  Just let time take its course.

This sequel combines the next THREE novels in the series --- ""Anne of Avonlea,"" ""Anne of the Island,"" and ""Anne of Windy Poplars.""  Several characters are combined to make ONE specific character, but the story still remains very much Anne's story.Now a little older, having taught at the public school in Avonlea for a while, Anne decides to try her hand at teaching at a private school in Kingsport --- a wealthy town mainly run by a particular set, the Pringles.  It's a new and daunting experience --- especially considering that she can't seem to win over the students or the school board --- but her stubbornnes won't allow her to give up, and she charges forward with her usual determination.There are several new characters, but we still have appearances by the old ones.  We meet Morgan Harris, his intelligent daughter Emmeline, his mother and his sister, and of course we meet countless girls who go to Kingsport Ladies College.  But Rachel Lynde and Marilla Cuthbert are still around, Diana Barry remains a wonderful friend, and of course there is the wonderful Gilbert Blythe --- more in love with Anne than ever.This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen, it fits perfectly with the original movie and does a decent job of remaining as faithful as possible to the books, in spite of everything that was altered.

Bernabo,"[93, 98]","The original mini-series of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; ended with Anne (Megan Follows) on speaking terms with Gilbert (Jonathan Crombie), but still the only person in Avonlea who does not know that the two of them are meant to live happily ever after.  &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; is adapted by writer-director Kevin Sullivan from the second, third, and fourth novels in the series, drawing primarily on the last one, &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; for her experiences teaching at a girl's school.  There is also a major subplot regarding a rich widower who seems to offer Anne everything she has ever wanted that is largely Sullivan's creation; Morgan Harris (Frank Converse) is much older than Anne's other beau in the series.  The important thing is that he keeps the ending of &quot;Anne of the Island.&quot;I am sure most of you love all of the Anne books and the first two films, which means the issue is why you should also pick up the DVD versions. The answer is simply the director's commentary. There are a few missing scenes, several of which are alternative takes, and some behinds the scenes still photographs, but the chief charm here is listening to director Kevin Sullivan talk to the film's editor about the production (she does not have much to say; I think she was there to give Sullivan a real person to talk to during the almost four hour film). From this commentary you will learn where many of the scenes were shot on PEI but mostly around Toronto (we tracked down several of them on the journey home from PEI, including THE BRIDGE), what he took (and why) from the three Lucy Maud Montgomery novels this film was based on, Dame Wendy Hiller's accident that almost made her quit the film and the scene she insisted Sullivan shoot for her, and loads of other fascinating little details about the production and the performances.This is certainly an above average commentary track and fans of the film will not be disappointed. It would be nice if the DVD features closed-captioning, which I like to turn on while doing the director's commentary, but despite this rather odd omission, I think fans will enjoy this addition to their collection. Besides, it is not like we have not already pretty much memorized the entire show.  Final Note: If you watch the opening scene of &quot;Anne of of Green Gables: The Sequel&quot; or whatever it is being called this time around) you will see Anne Shirley bicycle by Dalvay by the Sea, the &quot;White Sands&quot; hotel from the &quot;Avonlea&quot; series.

Montgomery book series of Anne of Green Gables. But this has been one of the best sequels I have ever seen. The new additions to the cast is great. We still follow the life of Anne Shirley as she matures and intends on graduating college and becoming a teacher, and a writer. She also has to help with Green Gables now that Mathew is gone. Her friendship also blossom's with Gilbert B. however, she isn't ready to fall in love with him yet. As it becomes a hard decision she is comfortable with Marilla living with Rachel at Green Gables as she goes off to teach at a private girls school which is a new chapter and new adventures. She then becomes involved with a young girl Emmeline Harris and falls into a very close relationship with her father Morgan Harris. She makes the town fall in love with her despite them disliking new comer's to the town. However, she realizes that she is very much home sick and that she belongs back home in Green Gables and she also realizes that her and Gilbert belong together. Again it's always fantastic to see all of the actor's and characters return to this amazing sequel. There are a few characters very much missed, but remembered in this film. And all of the relationships between Anne and her friends grow stronger and stronger. The new additions are just as wonderful with the private school and the other characters of the new town.

But that doesn't seem to matter, as the story is charming, engaging and heart-warming!The writer/director does a great job weaving the charm of LMM's middle ""Anne books"" with his own artistic vision for Anne and we end up with a breathtakingly romantic story, full of love, proposals and new adventures in an urban setting, a perfect challenge for Anne! We get a true-to-spirit adaptation, with worthy embellishment all over.I love the trials Anne's heart faces, as she leaves her beloved Avonlea and heads off to Kingsport to teach a bunch of spoiled, bratty, rich girls English, and ends up slowly winning their hearts, and making friends among them. She also ends up with more proposals than she ever imagined!The acting is superb. Glances and facial expressions end up saying much more than words ever could, and the director wisely lets these do so.Most of the actors are so young, yet so true to character and convincing in their roles, that we are effortlessly swept away into the fantastic world of Anne and her beloved Avonlea.The character changes are reluctant, yet stark. And the costumes and hair just keep getting better (and fluffier, in Anne's case)! The truth is, as the commentary points out, that underneath these splendid dresses and outfits, are some very young, naive children, and they are forced to face the changing world and the world of ""growing up"".What, too, is wonderful to behold is the past world of Turn-of-the-Century Kingsport, with its ""modern conveniences"", such as the Steam Engine, electrical bells, and new Telephones, even motor vehicles! - things that PEI does not yet have!The commentary is good, if a bit slow. The director/writer (forgive my lack of using his name) lets us in on behind the scenes info, as well as his inspiration for the changes. And they all work.
