971969,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B000EDWLT6,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[0, 1]","I saw this short series years ago on TV and loved it. The dvd set is the only way to watch this story, since it jumps around with characters and plots that may never be resolved and I really had to keep in mind who the characters were and what the two movies being made were about.The actors are wonderful and the sets interesting. I liked the interruptions with the ""signs"" made for silent films, but I thought there were too many and took up a lot of time between pieces of the rather confusing arrangement of stories being told. I still feel as though ""things"" were left out and am not clear as to what happened to some characters. The real/main story of Arnie and Maud was simple, fun, interesting, and I enjoyed its continuing plot to the end. Other characters were well played, but I'd rather have seen more plot than signage.The other wonderful descriptions of this movie aren't ""wrong."" I just found myself wanting more continuity and less confusion.This is not a film for everyone. You have to like the history of silent filmmaking, which I do. Others may be bored or find it ""dull."" It is not actually funny, but humorous.I think I'm being fair with a rating of 3 stars. I am a bit surprised that everyone else thinks it was so funny. I wouldn't compare it to a typical Britcom, and I don't mean Benny Hill but a more ""drama'ish"" comedy.I did find some small sound problem with the second of the three dvds. And, I thought there would be more to the story than there is. I saw the entire 3 discs in one sitting. I think it was the second disc that had only 1 episode and half of another. I just wasn't as satisfied with what I remembered as I should have been. I doubt if I will ever watch this again, and that tells you something. Of course, I seem to be the only one who didn't think it was terrific, but....",3,I'm Going to be a Bit of a Wet Blanket!!,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1820,"['saw', 'short', 'series', 'years', 'ago', 'TV', 'loved', 'dvd', 'set', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'story', 'characters', 'plots', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'really', 'had', 'keep', 'mind', 'who', 'characters', 'were', 'what', 'two', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'were', 'about.The', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'interesting', 'liked', 'interruptions', 'signs', 'made', 'silent', 'films', 'thought', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'took', 'up', 'lot', 'time', 'pieces', 'rather', 'confusing', 'arrangement', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'still', 'feel', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'real/main', 'story', 'Arnie', 'Maud', 'was', 'simple', 'fun', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'continuing', 'plot', 'end', 'Other', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'played', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'plot', 'signage.The', 'other', 'wonderful', 'descriptions', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'just', 'found', 'wanting', 'more', 'continuity', 'less', 'confusion.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'have', 'like', 'history', 'silent', 'filmmaking', 'do', 'Others', 'may', 'be', 'bored', 'find', 'dull', 'not', 'actually', 'funny', 'humorous.I', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'fair', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'am', 'bit', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'would', ""n't"", 'compare', 'typical', 'Britcom', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'more', ""drama'ish"", 'comedy.I', 'did', 'find', 'small', 'sound', 'problem', 'second', 'three', 'dvds', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'story', 'saw', 'entire', '3', 'discs', 'one', 'sitting', 'think', 'was', 'second', 'disc', 'had', 'only', '1', 'episode', 'half', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'what', 'remembered', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'tells', 'something', 'course', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'terrific']",Flickers

971975,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B000EDWLT6,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[18, 18]","Produced in 1980 and penned by britcom veteran Roy Clarke (Keeping Up Appearances, Last of the Summer Wine, Open All Hours), Flickers is a light, entertaining six-part comedy-drama (with the emphasis on comedy) set amid the burgeoning film industry in 1920's England.The series stars Bob Hoskins (Mrs. Henderson Presents, Thick as Thieves) as Arnie Cole, an outspoken Cockney with little dress sense and even less manners;  yet despite his faults, he is shrewd, determined and hard-working.  Arnie is in the business of showing films, but what he really wants to do is make them.  He's a man with a dream--a vision, even; what he lacks, however, is money.  The need for a loan or a backer poses a huge obstacle in a time when the more conservative, traditional lenders and investors were very leary of putting money into what was viewed by many as likely being a here-today-gone-tomorrow industry.Frances de la Tour (Rising Damp) stars as Maud, the well-spoken, well-bred, but very uppity, not to mention plain-looking, daughter of a well-off family.  It is Maud's brother, Clive, who himself has a tidy nest-egg, that Arnie hopes to smooth-talk into investing in his dream.  Maud, however, sees right through Arnie, and turns him down flat.As it happens, circumstances conspire to bring Arnie and Maud together.  Theirs is an uncomfortable, not to mention unlikely, alliance--at least initially; and it is an uphill battle all the way, with shoe-string finances being only the tip of the problem.  From a Shirley-Temple-like little girl who's becoming noticeably not so little anymore to a depressive comic and a grand, self-obsessed theatrical diva, there are a number of temperamental, highly-strung thespians, whose egos must be placated.  Then there is Max Legendre, the agent of the big-name comic star whom Arnie hopes to snag.  The problem is that Max, who has no people skills whatsoever and is no more than a temperamental bully, has aspirations in the directorial direction; that he gets his way only adds to Arnie and Maud's problems.  Circumstances are not assisted by the reappearance of Letty, Arnie's tarty (but certainly not plain) former flame, who kindles a spark of jealousy in Maud.With 50-minute episodes, romantic tension, a delightful blend of comedy and drama, and an unusual period setting, this series is quite a departure for Roy Clarke (who also displayed a flair for comedy-drama in the feature-length film Hawks).  Viewers ought not, therefore, to expect something akin to the above-mentioned character comedies for which Clarke is so well known.  Though characters abound, this is not character comedy.  It really is in a class all its own--I can think of nothing to which to compare it!  Having said that, it is a well-written, superbly-acted series with an engaging storyline, and it is a series our family really enjoyed.",5,A Thoroughly Delighful Comedy-Drama!,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2856,"['Produced', '1980', 'penned', 'britcom', 'veteran', 'Roy', 'Clarke', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'Open', 'All', 'Hours', 'Flickers', 'light', 'entertaining', 'six-part', 'comedy-drama', 'emphasis', 'comedy', 'set', 'burgeoning', 'film', 'industry', '1920', 'England.The', 'series', 'stars', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Mrs.', 'Henderson', 'Presents', 'Thick', 'Thieves', 'Arnie', 'Cole', 'outspoken', 'Cockney', 'little', 'dress', 'sense', 'even', 'less', 'manners', 'yet', 'faults', 'shrewd', 'determined', 'hard-working', 'Arnie', 'business', 'showing', 'films', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'make', 'man', 'dream', 'vision', 'even', 'what', 'however', 'money', 'need', 'loan', 'backer', 'huge', 'obstacle', 'time', 'when', 'more', 'conservative', 'traditional', 'lenders', 'investors', 'were', 'very', 'leary', 'putting', 'money', 'what', 'was', 'viewed', 'many', 'likely', 'being', 'here-today-gone-tomorrow', 'industry.Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Rising', 'Damp', 'Maud', 'well-spoken', 'well-bred', 'very', 'uppity', 'not', 'mention', 'plain-looking', 'daughter', 'well-off', 'family', 'Maud', 'brother', 'Clive', 'who', 'tidy', 'nest-egg', 'Arnie', 'smooth-talk', 'investing', 'dream', 'Maud', 'however', 'sees', 'right', 'Arnie', 'down', 'flat.As', 'circumstances', 'conspire', 'bring', 'Arnie', 'Maud', 'together', 'Theirs', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'mention', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'least', 'initially', 'uphill', 'battle', 'way', 'shoe-string', 'finances', 'being', 'only', 'tip', 'problem', 'Shirley-Temple-like', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'becoming', 'noticeably', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'anymore', 'depressive', 'comic', 'grand', 'self-obsessed', 'theatrical', 'diva', 'are', 'number', 'temperamental', 'highly-strung', 'thespians', 'egos', 'must', 'be', 'placated', 'Then', 'Max', 'Legendre', 'agent', 'big-name', 'comic', 'star', 'whom', 'Arnie', 'snag', 'problem', 'Max', 'who', 'people', 'skills', 'whatsoever', 'more', 'temperamental', 'bully', 'aspirations', 'directorial', 'direction', 'way', 'only', 'Arnie', 'Maud', 'problems', 'Circumstances', 'are', 'not', 'assisted', 'reappearance', 'Letty', 'Arnie', 'tarty', 'certainly', 'not', 'plain', 'former', 'flame', 'who', 'spark', 'jealousy', 'Maud.With', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'romantic', 'tension', 'delightful', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'unusual', 'period', 'setting', 'series', 'quite', 'departure', 'Roy', 'Clarke', 'who', 'also', 'displayed', 'flair', 'comedy-drama', 'feature-length', 'film', 'Hawks', 'Viewers', 'ought', 'not', 'therefore', 'expect', 'something', 'akin', 'above-mentioned', 'character', 'comedies', 'Clarke', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'abound', 'not', 'character', 'comedy', 'really', 'class', 'own', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'compare', 'Having', 'said', 'well-written', 'superbly-acted', 'series', 'engaging', 'storyline', 'series', 'family', 'really', 'enjoyed']",Flickers
