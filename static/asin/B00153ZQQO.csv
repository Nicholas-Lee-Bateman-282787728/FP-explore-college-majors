He loves tractor movies, toys, bikes, stickers, etc.  I bought this movie at the same time I bought the John Deere movie but the difference is that the John Deere movie keeps his attention.  He has watched the John Deere movie almost everyday since we bought it.In contrast, he will start to watch this movie then get up and turn it off or walk away.  He won't watch it.The voices used are annoying.  My husband tried to watch it the other day but eventually turned it off because he couldn't stand the voices.  It is a very boring movie.",1,Terrible,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,569,"['2', 'year', 'old', 'tractors', 'tractor', 'movies', 'toys', 'bikes', 'stickers', 'etc', 'bought', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'bought', 'John', 'Deere', 'movie', 'difference', 'John', 'Deere', 'movie', 'attention', 'watched', 'John', 'Deere', 'movie', 'almost', 'everyday', 'bought', 'it.In', 'contrast', 'will', 'start', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'get', 'up', 'turn', 'off', 'walk', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'it.The', 'voices', 'used', 'are', 'annoying', 'husband', 'tried', 'watch', 'other', 'day', 'eventually', 'turned', 'off', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'voices', 'very', 'boring', 'movie']",Mighty Machines: Tremendous Tools

A suggestion: make a list of what's on each DVD and keep it handy by your stash so you won't struggle to find the right one putting in DVD after DVD--it's too hard to remember which episode is on which DVD when pushed for time.",4,Loved by truck/track little ones!,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,552,"['have', 'Mighty', 'Machines', 'power', 'pack', 'DVDs', 'needed', 'something', 'new', 'supplement', '3', 'yr', 'old', 'son', 'fascination', 'trucks', 'tractors', 'planes', 'etc', 'are', 'entertaining', '2-5', 'year', 'olds', 'adult', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'brain', 'being', 'sucked', 'dry', 'are', 'required', 'watch', 'kid', 'programming', 'suggestion', 'make', 'list', 'what', 'DVD', 'keep', 'handy', 'stash', 'wo', ""n't"", 'struggle', 'find', 'right', 'one', 'putting', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'too', 'hard', 'remember', 'episode', 'DVD', 'when', 'pushed', 'time']",Mighty Machines: Tremendous Tools
1148612,A2CPM6WTF7PO3G,B00153ZQQO,"Red Xala ""~23~""","[0, 0]","My four year old son is obsessed with tractors, bulldozers, trucks, and pretty much anything else that rolls on wheels.  I had never heard of this series until the other day, when I saw this DVD available at my local library.  It was like finding a treasure!  My son loved it, and I ended up learning something too.  (It's always a bonus when the producers of children's shows can also entertain adults, so kudos to the people at NCircle Entertainment for their efforts!)There are 3 primary episodes on this DVD:  1) AT THE SAWMILL! 2) ON THE FARM! 3) DEEP UNDERGROUND! (This 3rd episode actually introduces the viewer to the industrial process of mining salt, deep in underground caverns below Lake Huron.)  Via a dubbed-in narrative, all of the vehicles are ""anthropomorphized"" and given distinct names, personalities, and voices.  A previous reviewer mentioned being annoyed by all of the different accented voices associated with the vehicles; admittedly I can relate a little bit to this. (I did initially start laughing at the opening scene of AT THE SAWMILL, when I heard the dubbed-in voice of a gruff sounding female saying ""Hello kids! My name is JAWS!"" - the ""character"" for the front-end loader filmed in the process of hauling logs.)  However, once I made the mental adjustment to the voice-over format, I was pleasantly surprised by the wealth of information that was presented.  As for my son, this DVD kept his undivided attention (a rarity) for the full 90 minute duration.  He even enjoyed the ""Mighty Machines"" jingle that played between each episode (subsequently singing it at the dinner table.)I intend to purchase a copy of this DVD, and to also check out additional episodes in this series.As I said initially - if your kids like vehicles, they'll most likely enjoy this DVD.",4,Great for children who love industrial vehicles in action...,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1799,"['four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'obsessed', 'tractors', 'bulldozers', 'trucks', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'wheels', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'other', 'day', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'available', 'local', 'library', 'was', 'finding', 'treasure', 'son', 'loved', 'ended', 'up', 'learning', 'something', 'too', 'always', 'bonus', 'when', 'producers', 'children', 'shows', 'can', 'also', 'entertain', 'adults', 'so', 'kudos', 'people', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', 'efforts', 'are', '3', 'primary', 'episodes', 'DVD', '1', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAWMILL', '2', 'THE', 'FARM', '3', 'DEEP', 'UNDERGROUND', '3rd', 'episode', 'actually', 'viewer', 'industrial', 'process', 'mining', 'salt', 'deep', 'underground', 'caverns', 'Lake', 'Huron', 'Via', 'dubbed-in', 'narrative', 'vehicles', 'are', 'anthropomorphized', 'given', 'distinct', 'names', 'personalities', 'voices', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'being', 'annoyed', 'different', 'accented', 'voices', 'associated', 'vehicles', 'admittedly', 'can', 'relate', 'little', 'bit', 'did', 'initially', 'start', 'laughing', 'opening', 'scene', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAWMILL', 'when', 'heard', 'dubbed-in', 'voice', 'gruff', 'sounding', 'female', 'saying', 'Hello', 'kids', 'name', 'JAWS', 'character', 'front-end', 'loader', 'filmed', 'process', 'hauling', 'logs', 'However', 'once', 'made', 'mental', 'adjustment', 'voice-over', 'format', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'wealth', 'information', 'was', 'presented', 'son', 'DVD', 'kept', 'undivided', 'attention', 'rarity', 'full', '90', 'minute', 'duration', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'Mighty', 'Machines', 'jingle', 'played', 'episode', 'subsequently', 'singing', 'dinner', 'table', 'intend', 'purchase', 'copy', 'DVD', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'additional', 'episodes', 'series.As', 'said', 'initially', 'kids', 'vehicles', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'DVD']",Mighty Machines: Tremendous Tools
