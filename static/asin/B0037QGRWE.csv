I would like the last 2 hours of my life back.  Long shots of sheep rear ends, several minutes of a sheep chewing--it was like watching amateur home movies of inept sheep ranchers, with lots of swearing thrown in for effect.  It didn't represent the ""real west"" as I've ever seen it, and made my grandfather's reels of home movies of cattle look downright riveting.To be fair, there were some beautiful shots of Montana scenery, but they weren't worth seeing this movie.",1,Like someone's home movies of sheep,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,593,"['general', 'LOVE', 'documentaries', 'grew', 'up', 'ranch', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'see', 'would', 'like', 'last', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'back', 'Long', 'shots', 'sheep', 'rear', 'ends', 'several', 'minutes', 'sheep', 'chewing', 'was', 'watching', 'amateur', 'home', 'movies', 'inept', 'sheep', 'ranchers', 'lots', 'swearing', 'thrown', 'effect', 'did', ""n't"", 'represent', 'real', 'west', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'made', 'grandfather', 'reels', 'home', 'movies', 'cattle', 'look', 'downright', 'riveting.To', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'Montana', 'scenery', 'were', ""n't"", 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie']",N/A

I was so glad to read at least one review FROM a Montana sheep farmer listing this portrayal as very disgraceful. In my experiences going to farm and horse shows, I have not seem this kind of animal disrespect as this film portrayed either. Firstly, there is hardly if any narration which makes for an ultra snooze fest, and for people to leave their own interpretation of the movie's message- which is the worst kind of educating of a topic few people know about. You do witness some beautiful scenery of Montana, but among that you witness downright stressful  (and at times bloody) conditions of sheep shearing, a sheep's ear being legitimately clipped right off (I actually screamed during that part), and lots of &#34;cowboys&#34; who only seem to curse and show little respect for their animals. At one point, three baby sheep are just birthed and the cowboy involved literally hauls one of them onto the ground from at least 2 1/2 feet in height.

1329812,A2GYIZ74N28BI1,B0037QGRWE,Martha Ann Kennedy,"[3, 5]","Spell-binding, beautiful, aware, really took my breath away. I know this landscape -- not as well as the people in the film, but I've been through it more than once. Sheep, as Ivan Doig (Montana writer) mentioned in one of his books about Montana sheepfarming around the turn of the century (Dancing at the Rascal Fair, I think), ""Sheep reach their peak of intellectual development three minutes after birth and it's all downhill from there."" This film kind of illustrates that wry observation. Sheep are not Einstein.One of the loveliest shots in the film is before it even starts, when a ewe looks straight at the camera, straight at you. Great filming throughout this piece. It does what film should do more; it tells the story without a lot of talk and manipulation and phoney build up to some point someone wants to make. It's the anti-Herzog documentary, if you will. (I like Herzog, but he does preach.) This documentary lets the landscape, the animals and the men and women working tell the story.I don't think this film was meant to entertain. I think it was meant to preserve on film a way of life in its final moments because it is gone. I'm so glad they made this film. One of the most touching parts is the collection of ""fan pictures"" you can look at. People all over the US and Germany sent in their sheep-herding photos out of love for the life.The Beartooths are fantastically beautiful -- and the film shows them -- but they are a true wilderness with grizzlies, mountain lions, wolverines all of which prey on sheep at NIGHT. It's not easy to take film at night, but one of the film's most amazing shots is of the sheepherder's light reflected in the eyes of a bear and the hundreds of eyes of the sheep all around it. I really love this movie. I would venture that if you don't love it, it's because you just don't get it. That's fine.

1329814,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0037QGRWE,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[38, 42]","An ethnographic study of a vanishing way of life, Sweetgrass follows some of the last modern-day cowboys as they herd sheep into the beautiful Absaroka-Beartooth mountains.  The film is an astonishing document, that recalls Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack'sGrass: A Nation's Battle For Lifefor its epochal scope, its subtle humor, and its profound depiction of the passing of a lifestyle.The opening shots depict sheep in wintry pastures, barely standing out against the snow, the sounds of bleating and bell and the white overwhelm the senses.  We see a single sheep, in a medium shot, bleating loudly, and then she turns to face the camera in silence.  It is a strange moment, and an intriguing choice for a documentary film where the filmmakers seem barely present since its subjects - the sheep and the men and women who tend them - appear almost oblivious to the camera throughout, with rare exceptions such as in this opening shot where the subject of the film breaks the fourth wall, and stares at the camera.  A defiant gaze.The film demands some patience initially, but there is a highly satisfying payoff.  The filmmakers work in a tradition of ethnographic filmmaking, attempting to capture a way of life without commentary, so that there is no voiceover, no explanation other than what can be observed.  There is no human voice for the first several minutes of the film, and the first human voice we hear is of a farmer making peeping noises as she carries a baby lamb in order to encourage its mother to follow her.  The most extended speech is a tirade filled with invectives, of a tired and discouraged shepherd who later complains to his mother via satellite phone that he would rather love these mountains than come to hate them.The film, which was shot digitally but then blown up to 35mm film for its theatrical release, is quite beautiful; occasionally its digital origins show in the sweeping vistas that lack some of the nuance, depth, and detail of true film, but the patience of the filmmakers and their care and attention in framing images and capturing the difficult reality of the mountain trek, more than makes up for it.

In some ways, they set the tone for the film; there's a lot of landscape, a lot of sheep, and a lot of lingering shots, either stationary or slow-pan. Barbash and Castaing-Taylor are well aware of Tarr. And if the movie played out its full length as it does in those first two shots and the twenty-five minutes that follow them, I would have put this pretty high on my list of favorite documentaries ever. Unfortunately, as you may surmise from that last sentence, it doesn't.The first half-hour is gorgeous. It keeps up with the sheep-and-landscape theme. Humans exist in the movie, of course, but at no point during the first half-hour are those humans more than background noise, either in their presence in the film or the movie's sound (which, I should warn you, my wife found incredibly annoying; I had no problems with it). It is languid, and it is breathtaking.Then the humans take center stage, and while I won't say the entire thing goes to pot, it takes a pretty sharp left turn in that direction. These are not likable folks, for the most part. Actually, I've been sitting here for ten minutes trying to come up with diplomatic ways to talk about this, and I can't. I hated these people. Every last one of them. The sheep have better personalities.Whenever the directors left the humans and cut to another slow pan shot of a huge mountain with sheep coming down it or a tree framed in moonlight or a sheep's face in close-up, I rejoiced a little. I also spent some time hoping that there would be another human-free half-hour bookending the film, but (spoiler alert!) it was not to be.Well worth watching for the first half-hour.

1329817,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0037QGRWE,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","***1/2A documentary on the life of Montana sheepherders, ""Sweetgrass"" looks for all the world as if it had been strung together from a series of ""Brokeback Mountain"" outtakes.  I guess that's inevitable given the subject matter and setting, but this seems almost like a nonfiction version of that movie - minus the movie stars and gay romance, that is (and it's not as beautifully filmed).What most distinguishes ""Sweetgrass"" from other documentaries is that there is no voiceover narration to explain or analyze what's going on.  And the individuals who appear in the film are every bit as taciturn and tight-lipped as one would expect people in this setting to be.  The movie simply chronicles the day-to-day task of raising, herding and shearing sheep without feeling the need to comment on what it's showing us.  The drawback is that we never get to know much about the rugged men and women involved in the business, what makes them tick (indeed, they talk to their animals more than they do each other).  At some point, however, we do begin to understand the toll all this loneliness, physical exertion and exposure to the elements begins to take on the people who do this job.The result is an admittedly repetitive and frequently tedious exercise in filmmaking that also casts a strangely hypnotic spell over its audience.  Perhaps it's the fact that movies rarely just show us people working at their professions that makes this film compelling in its uniqueness.
