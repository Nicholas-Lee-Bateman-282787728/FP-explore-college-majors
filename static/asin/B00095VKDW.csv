902093,A53ZWHWGLPZQV,B00095VKDW,Grandy 2014,"[0, 0]","Bias of the men critiquing the private lives of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford is the very thick thread sewn throughout this abomnible pseudo-documentary. They fail to grasp that Ms. Crawford had a vast history of being rivalrous. While Miss Davis did not engage in acts of rivalry. The speakers in this horrible film are so bloated on themselves that their gaze is mis-focused upon ahistorical points, most especially about Miss Davis. Their distinctively different personality types is not addressed. Miss Davis was a down to earth, let's make great films kind of actor who was generous with her time and talents beginning in her very early 20s. Ms. Crawford was not down to earth, focused so narrowly upon her own self and was much more of a taker than a giver. She was indeed quite jealous of Miss Davis' super successful career. The two are not comparable because Davis was thee consumate actor and awarded as such, even with the title of ""First Lady of US Cinema,"" on her 100th birthdate when her US postage stamp came out. She was selected by the American Film Institute, out of all the marvelous women 'Golden Era' actors as the first woman, 3rd actor and 5th person to ever receive the Life Achievement Award. Ms. Crawford spent the latter part of her mediocre acting career wasting it on flim flops in B-horror flicks that later become of camp value alone. Thus, these filmmakers' assertion that there was a mutual rivalry is unfounded. Miss Davis enjoyed playing with Ms. Crawford's bitterness and pretentions of superiority. Davis' was a lighthearted acknowledgement that Ms. Crawford was publically known to have a jealousy complex over Miss Davis' career achievements. Davis used her later life career to champion the key issues of the times such as agism, the US' nazi witch hunt, racism, the right to die, families turning upon their elders like moochers, and wound her career up making a marvelous drama, while she was dying, which became the final feature film of Lillian Gish, Ann Southern, Vincent Price and Bette Davis! Ms. Crawford is examined by the filmmakers as a gay icon who's so beloved for being like them, an underdog. By doing this, the filmmakers errantly diminish the classic value of Davis' quite well recognized 60 career years of extraordinary achievements in choice filmmaking that stands the tests of time. This unbalanced and mis-informed film suffers from very poor research. Throughout, the biases of the icon worshippers are defintely showing.",1,Possibly Worst Documentary,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2484,"['Bias', 'men', 'critiquing', 'private', 'lives', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'very', 'thick', 'thread', 'sewn', 'abomnible', 'pseudo-documentary', 'fail', 'grasp', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'had', 'vast', 'history', 'being', 'rivalrous', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'did', 'not', 'engage', 'acts', 'rivalry', 'speakers', 'horrible', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'bloated', 'gaze', 'mis-focused', 'ahistorical', 'points', 'most', 'especially', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'distinctively', 'different', 'personality', 'types', 'not', 'addressed', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'was', 'down', 'earth', 'let', 'make', 'great', 'films', 'kind', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'generous', 'time', 'talents', 'beginning', 'very', 'early', '20s', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'was', 'not', 'down', 'earth', 'focused', 'so', 'narrowly', 'own', 'self', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'taker', 'giver', 'was', 'indeed', 'quite', 'jealous', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'super', 'successful', 'career', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'comparable', 'Davis', 'was', 'thee', 'consumate', 'actor', 'awarded', 'such', 'even', 'title', 'First', 'Lady', 'US', 'Cinema', '100th', 'birthdate', 'when', 'US', 'postage', 'stamp', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'selected', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'marvelous', 'women', 'Era', 'actors', 'first', 'woman', '3rd', 'actor', '5th', 'person', 'ever', 'receive', 'Life', 'Achievement', 'Award', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'spent', 'latter', 'part', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'career', 'wasting', 'flim', 'flops', 'B-horror', 'flicks', 'later', 'become', 'camp', 'value', 'alone', 'Thus', 'filmmakers', 'assertion', 'was', 'mutual', 'rivalry', 'unfounded', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'bitterness', 'pretentions', 'superiority', 'Davis', 'was', 'lighthearted', 'acknowledgement', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'was', 'publically', 'known', 'have', 'jealousy', 'complex', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'career', 'achievements', 'Davis', 'used', 'later', 'life', 'career', 'champion', 'key', 'issues', 'times', 'such', 'agism', 'US', 'nazi', 'witch', 'hunt', 'racism', 'right', 'die', 'families', 'turning', 'elders', 'moochers', 'career', 'up', 'making', 'marvelous', 'drama', 'was', 'dying', 'became', 'final', 'feature', 'film', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Ann', 'Southern', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'examined', 'filmmakers', 'gay', 'icon', 'who', 'so', 'beloved', 'being', 'underdog', 'doing', 'filmmakers', 'errantly', 'diminish', 'classic', 'value', 'Davis', 'quite', 'well', 'recognized', '60', 'career', 'years', 'extraordinary', 'achievements', 'choice', 'filmmaking', 'tests', 'time', 'unbalanced', 'mis-informed', 'film', 'suffers', 'very', 'poor', 'research', 'Throughout', 'biases', 'icon', 'worshippers', 'are', 'defintely', 'showing']",Hollywood Rivals - Joan Crawford vs. Bette Davis
902094,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B00095VKDW,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[44, 45]","I remember reading Shaun Considine's ""The Divine Feud"" when it was first published many years ago and although much of it was speculation, (I.E., Joan Crawfords same sex crush on Davis; Davis' affair with Franchot Tone), The Mutual dislike these two ladies had for each other was quite an open secret. In fact, the two often took shots at one another in interviews given late in their careers. The ""War"" heated up after they had filmed ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" together, and Mr. Considine's book was peppered with factual reports of their mutual antics during the making of the film and their aborted follow up ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" in which they were scheduled to co-star again. (Crawford withdrew and was replaced by Olivia DeHavilland). I was hoping that maybe we would see some outtakes from these two films. There is nothing here but a collection of film clips from their films presented in no particular order and often at odds with the dull narration. There is nothing here you have not seen and don't already know about. The narrator hedges the producers' bets by stating periodically that there was a ""rumored"" feud between the two stars. That is all you will hear about the rivalry on this disc! The transfer quality is abysmally poor. It's the worst I've seen in years from films that have already been remastered. Passport should be ashamed of themselves for issuing such a low quality product. Twenty years ago I thought that ""The Divine Feud"" would make a good movie of the week for TV providing it could be properly cast. Now, I'm afraid too much time has gone by. I don't think any studio would bother with it as younger audiences hardly know who these ladies were. Maybe Stephen Sondhiem will turn the book into a Broadway Musical. I nominate Bernadette Peters for Bette and Patti Lupone for the role of Joan. If I could, I would give this DVD 1/4 Stars (for the Box).

That's what started the rivalry that culminated not in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane but rather in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte with Bette the victor.
