1119158,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YDOOP0,B. E Jackson,"[7, 7]","Moving McAllister started off a little shakey, but eventually turned into a pretty solid comedy.It's not the kind of comedy that does anything different from most comedies these days, and honestly, there's no reason why it SHOULD be any different- it's just an innocent, funny comedy with a little bit of a romantic edge, but not enough kissing and mushy segments to turn away male viewers.I quickly realized who the woman playing the female character was- the young girl from the hit Fox sitcom That 70's Show.  She acts pretty much the same way in that show that she does here, except she's not going around thinking she's prettier than the other girls, haha.In fact, there's hardly any women in this movie at all- it's mainly one woman and two guys as the focal point, but the story is interesting because it's about an adventure across the United States all the way to California and meeting new people and discovering new (unexpected) adventures along the way, and how the relationship between the girl from That 70's Show and the young guy driving her across America develops.Now, I always thought she was a VERY attractive woman while watching That 70's Show, and I still do, but I promise I'm not giving Moving McAllister 5 stars for that reason alone.  It's just a really pleasant movie.I recommend this film for anyone just looking for a laugh and watching how it's done the right way.",5,highly enjoyable little comedy,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,1395,"['Moving', 'McAllister', 'started', 'off', 'little', 'shakey', 'eventually', 'turned', 'pretty', 'solid', 'comedy.It', 'not', 'kind', 'comedy', 'anything', 'different', 'most', 'comedies', 'days', 'honestly', 'reason', 'why', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'different-', 'just', 'innocent', 'funny', 'comedy', 'little', 'bit', 'romantic', 'edge', 'not', 'enough', 'kissing', 'mushy', 'segments', 'turn', 'away', 'male', 'viewers.I', 'quickly', 'realized', 'who', 'woman', 'playing', 'female', 'character', 'was-', 'young', 'girl', 'hit', 'Fox', 'sitcom', '70', 'Show', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'show', 'here', 'not', 'going', 'thinking', 'prettier', 'other', 'girls', 'haha.In', 'fact', 'hardly', 'women', 'movie', 'all-', 'mainly', 'one', 'woman', 'two', 'guys', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'interesting', 'adventure', 'United', 'States', 'way', 'California', 'meeting', 'new', 'people', 'discovering', 'new', 'unexpected', 'way', 'how', 'relationship', 'girl', '70', 'Show', 'young', 'guy', 'driving', 'across', 'America', 'develops.Now', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'VERY', 'attractive', 'woman', 'watching', '70', 'Show', 'still', 'do', 'promise', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Moving', 'McAllister', '5', 'stars', 'reason', 'alone', 'just', 'really', 'pleasant', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'just', 'looking', 'laugh', 'watching', 'how', 'done', 'right', 'way']",N/A

1119162,A2SKHUNCGF9RKR,B000YDOOP0,Dee Mess,"[0, 0]","I wanted to like Moving McAllister. I truly did.It looked like it would be a cute little road comedy, an odd independent film that I could recommend to friends. Plus, it had Billy Drago, who I find immensely entertaining.Trouble is, it's sooo stupid. It tries to be wacky, funny, and touching, and handles each in such an inept way, it tries ones' patience.Jon Heder is incredibly irritating, perhaps more so than in Napoleon Dynamite (isn't THAT saying something), and for an actor, Ben Gourley is a pretty good screenwriter. Seriously--if he'd stayed in the writer's chair and let someone else handle his role, it might have helped.I've grown to appreciate Mila Kunis the further away she moves from That 70s Show. She's good here (if her character is too quirky, for the sake of  quirk), bratty and funny as the titular McAllister.A high point, however, was Hubbel Palmer, as Gourley's slovenly, laid-back pal Carl. Wasted in the film are Zack Ward as a gangster's henchman, who shows up for probably less than a minute, and Billy Drago as the gangster, himself. As usual, Billy shows up for about five minutes and gives 110%, as the purple-clad, mascara'ed ""The Lady"", then leaves--and left me wondering, `why couldn't the movie have more of THAT?'Brown-nosing, stuffed-shirt over-achiever volunteers to move his boss's niece, in the hopes of getting in good at his firm once he takes the bar exam. Said niece is a free-spirit actress type who insists on making frequent stops, picking up hitchhikers, taking many side trips, (including one to visit Our Hero's estranged family, AAAWWWWW), and generally deterring him from getting back in time to take his exam/showing him the importance of living life, rather than planning it.Watch if you must.3 stars for Billy Drago and Hubbel Palmer.",3,Waste of time (and Billy Drago),1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1792,"['wanted', 'Moving', 'McAllister', 'truly', 'did.It', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'cute', 'little', 'road', 'comedy', 'odd', 'independent', 'film', 'could', 'recommend', 'friends', 'had', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'who', 'find', 'immensely', 'entertaining.Trouble', 'sooo', 'stupid', 'be', 'wacky', 'funny', 'touching', 'such', 'inept', 'way', 'ones', 'patience.Jon', 'Heder', 'incredibly', 'irritating', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'saying', 'something', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Gourley', 'pretty', 'good', 'screenwriter', 'Seriously', ""'d"", 'stayed', 'writer', 'chair', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'handle', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'helped.I', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'appreciate', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'further', 'away', '70s', 'Show', 'good', 'here', 'character', 'too', 'quirky', 'sake', 'quirk', 'bratty', 'funny', 'titular', 'McAllister.A', 'high', 'point', 'however', 'was', 'Hubbel', 'Palmer', 'Gourley', 'slovenly', 'laid-back', 'pal', 'Carl', 'Wasted', 'film', 'are', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'gangster', 'henchman', 'who', 'up', 'probably', 'less', 'minute', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'gangster', 'usual', 'Billy', 'up', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', '110', '%', 'purple-clad', ""mascara'ed"", 'Lady', 'then', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'movie', 'have', 'more', ""'Brown-nosing"", 'stuffed-shirt', 'over-achiever', 'volunteers', 'move', 'boss', 'niece', 'hopes', 'getting', 'good', 'firm', 'once', 'bar', 'exam', 'Said', 'niece', 'free-spirit', 'actress', 'type', 'who', 'making', 'frequent', 'stops', 'picking', 'up', 'hitchhikers', 'taking', 'many', 'side', 'trips', 'including', 'one', 'visit', 'Hero', 'estranged', 'family', 'AAAWWWWW', 'generally', 'deterring', 'getting', 'back', 'time', 'take', 'exam/showing', 'importance', 'living', 'life', 'rather', 'planning', 'it.Watch', 'must.3', 'stars', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'Hubbel', 'Palmer']",N/A

But Michelle has other plans in mind, and she's not about to make it easy for the uptight, highly regimented young man - whom she believes needs to learn how to let his freak flag fly and just enjoy life - to complete his mission.Though the opposites-attract, road-trip-from-hell premise is far from original, ""Moving McAllister"" has enough charm, wit and affability to keep it just this side of entertaining. The performances are winning (with Jon Heder particularly effective as a spacey, zonked-out hitchhiker the couple picks up on their way), and writer Gourley and director Andrew Black have provided a series of loopy dream sequences that help lift the movie out of its picaresque rut.
