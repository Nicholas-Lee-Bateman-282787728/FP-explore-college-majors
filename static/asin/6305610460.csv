The talent in this concert is quite amazing. Every single person on stage bleeds pure talent, which is a rare thing. The truth is, however, I would expect nothing less from Eric Clapton. This DVD also includes my personal favorite renditions of the songs ""Old Love"" and ""Wonderful Tonight"", which was nice to say the least.It seems that you can't really find this DVD in stores and even if you could, amazon would still have the better price. So, I would say that if you like Eric Clapton and Sheryl Crow, this is a must have.

There are some flubs, and a couple of songs drag, but these are minor distractions against a group of gifted musicians enjoying themselves and each other very much. At its best, it's a jam session of terrific musicians.The guest artists are a decidedly mixed bag. David Sanborn soars on some songs but sounds oddly out of place in others. I don't know if Mary Blige really had a place in the sets, and I'm sure not going to rush out and buy her albums, but it was . . . interesting, anyway. Sheryl Crow was terrific and Bob Dylan actually smiled.From reviews of the concert itself you have to wonder at the song selection on the DVD, and why some songs got cut. Overall, what you get is not terrific, but is quite solid.

I have to rate this one at the bottom of the list, though it is worth the purchase just to get the rare &quot;Little Wing&quot; performance.  He uses the same arrangement/approach that the Dominos used, and it is good.  After that, I have to agree with the other reviews here that critise the choices of selections from the concert that ended up on the DVD.  I would really enjoy seeing the songs that were deleted, rather than the great, but oft repeated warhorses like &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, and yet another &quot;Tears in Heaven.&quot;  There are just so many wonderful choices in his past repetoire that he NEVER performs now like &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;Forever Man&quot;, or &quot;I Am Yours&quot; that would be precious to many of his fans!  But to avoid misunderstanding, I must say that what is here is predominantly great.  (The only blatant exception being the horror of what is done to the usually poignant &quot;Old Love&quot; by a keyboardist that I have never seen with him before.  I &quot;skip&quot; over that song always!)The guests are somewhat unusual, though mostly pleasing.  Sheryl Crow is fine, Bob Dylan is excellent, Dave Sanborn is probably good, (I rarely take note of horns), but the Mary Blige section is, ...well, ...unexpected!.Clapton's backing band is mostly the same folks that are usually with him; Andy Fairweather-Low, Steve Gadd, and Nathan East with Katie Kissoon &amp; Tessa Niles.  They are always enjoyable to hear.  (He later dropped the girls from his 2002 tour, and I missed them on &quot;One More Car&quot;/Rider).  I have read that he sometimes determines his song selections according to the capabilities of his backing group.  If that is so, then I would appreciate a little variety in the players he recruits - time is moving on, and I would love to hear/see him do some of the afformentioned tunes before he hangs up his new, graphic strat forever!",4,Uncommon Presentation,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1964,"['adore', 'Clapton', 'own', 'DVD', 'have', 'rate', 'one', 'bottom', 'list', 'purchase', 'just', 'get', 'rare', 'quot', 'Little', 'Wing', 'quot', 'performance', 'same', 'arrangement/approach', 'Dominos', 'used', 'good', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'critise', 'choices', 'selections', 'concert', 'ended', 'up', 'DVD', 'would', 'really', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'songs', 'were', 'deleted', 'rather', 'great', 'oft', 'repeated', 'warhorses', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'Your', 'Love', 'quot', 'yet', 'quot', 'Tears', 'Heaven.', 'quot', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'choices', 'past', 'repetoire', 'NEVER', 'now', 'quot', 'Strange', 'Brew', 'quot', 'quot', 'Forever', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Am', 'Yours', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'precious', 'many', 'fans', 'avoid', 'misunderstanding', 'must', 'say', 'what', 'here', 'predominantly', 'great', 'only', 'blatant', 'exception', 'being', 'horror', 'what', 'done', 'usually', 'poignant', 'quot', 'Old', 'Love', 'quot', 'keyboardist', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'quot', 'quot', 'song', 'always', 'guests', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'though', 'mostly', 'pleasing', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'fine', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'excellent', 'Dave', 'Sanborn', 'probably', 'good', 'rarely', 'take', 'note', 'horns', 'Mary', 'Blige', 'section', 'well', 'unexpected', '.Clapton', 'backing', 'band', 'mostly', 'same', 'folks', 'are', 'usually', 'Andy', 'Fairweather-Low', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'Nathan', 'East', 'Katie', 'Kissoon', 'amp', 'Tessa', 'Niles', 'are', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'hear', 'later', 'dropped', 'girls', '2002', 'tour', 'missed', 'quot', 'One', 'More', 'Car', 'quot', '/Rider', 'have', 'read', 'determines', 'song', 'selections', 'according', 'capabilities', 'backing', 'group', 'so', 'then', 'would', 'appreciate', 'little', 'variety', 'players', 'time', 'moving', 'would', 'love', 'hear/see', 'do', 'afformentioned', 'tunes', 'up', 'new', 'graphic', 'strat', 'forever']",N/A
