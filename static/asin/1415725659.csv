171550,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,1415725659,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","Watching 'Over the Hedge' I thought I was getting another paint-by-numbers Pixar movie.  We have the usual suspects for a formula caper, including forrest animals who are waging war against the suburban villain, a female real estate developer, who wishes to squash the critters during their quest to ""squirrel"" food  away from the greedy humans.  It really surprised me for being so fresh and innovative.  There is slap-stick and hijinx galore with an animal control ""Verminator"" and a colorful group of animal characters.  'Over the Hedge' makes one feel like a chucklehead--or at least laugh like one.  This movie kept vending laughs like few movies in memory.  They really did not hold onto a formula.It all starts when possum RJ (Bruce Willis) steals the cache of vending goods from a sleeping bear in his den.  He gets lucky until his greed rouses the bear, who forces RJ to return the booty destroyed by highway traffic or face a fatal mauling.  RJ is able to con his forest allies to horde a feast, especially from the erst mentioned suburban land developer who lives ""over the hedge"".  She's a driven realtor who won't stop at anything to vanquish the poor critters.  Included in her arsenal is a ridiculous laser lawn zapper, which she says, ""I don't care if it violates the Geneva Convention.""The lines and slap-stick are non-stop, and Wanda Sykes is great as the sexy skunk, Stella, a nice update to Pepe' Le Pew, and the one who needs to charm the lady's cat and detour the animal takeover.  One funny development is when they use a nearby ""See-and-say"" toy to convice the cat that Stella is a vixen cat.  They misfire and Hammy squirrel (Carrell) says, ""I hope the cat likes a cow.""  The overall effect is a refreshing arcade with witty lines and a non-stop delivery.  'Over the Hedge' is delightfully nutty fun.  (Voice talents by Steve Carrell, Gary Shandling, Nick Nolte, Thomas Hayden Church, William Shatner, as well as those mentioned, make this film a worthy movie outing.)",4,Delightfully Nutty,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1993,"['Watching', 'Hedge', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'paint-by-numbers', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'have', 'usual', 'suspects', 'formula', 'caper', 'including', 'forrest', 'animals', 'who', 'are', 'waging', 'war', 'suburban', 'villain', 'female', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'who', 'squash', 'critters', 'quest', 'squirrel', 'food', 'away', 'greedy', 'humans', 'really', 'surprised', 'being', 'so', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'slap-stick', 'hijinx', 'galore', 'animal', 'control', 'Verminator', 'colorful', 'group', 'animal', 'characters', 'Hedge', 'one', 'feel', 'chucklehead', 'least', 'one', 'movie', 'kept', 'vending', 'laughs', 'few', 'movies', 'memory', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'formula.It', 'starts', 'when', 'possum', 'RJ', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'cache', 'vending', 'goods', 'sleeping', 'bear', 'den', 'lucky', 'greed', 'bear', 'who', 'RJ', 'return', 'booty', 'destroyed', 'highway', 'traffic', 'face', 'fatal', 'mauling', 'RJ', 'able', 'con', 'forest', 'allies', 'horde', 'feast', 'especially', 'erst', 'mentioned', 'suburban', 'land', 'developer', 'who', 'hedge', 'driven', 'realtor', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'anything', 'vanquish', 'poor', 'critters', 'Included', 'arsenal', 'ridiculous', 'laser', 'lawn', 'zapper', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'lines', 'slap-stick', 'are', 'non-stop', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'great', 'sexy', 'skunk', 'Stella', 'nice', 'update', 'Pepe', 'Le', 'Pew', 'one', 'who', 'charm', 'lady', 'cat', 'detour', 'animal', 'takeover', 'One', 'funny', 'development', 'when', 'use', 'nearby', 'See-and-say', 'toy', 'convice', 'cat', 'Stella', 'vixen', 'cat', 'misfire', 'Hammy', 'squirrel', 'Carrell', 'hope', 'cat', 'cow', 'overall', 'effect', 'refreshing', 'arcade', 'witty', 'lines', 'non-stop', 'delivery', 'Hedge', 'delightfully', 'nutty', 'fun', 'Voice', 'talents', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'William', 'Shatner', 'as', 'well', 'mentioned', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', 'movie', 'outing']",N/A

Cartoons seem to be geared not only towards children but also adults.  In this movie Over the Hedge we are introduced to a sly raccoon.  Obviously sly and raccoon go very well together.  The raccoon is voiced by Bruce Willis who does an excellent job playing the selfish yet endearing character.  We get introduced to a whole family of creatures who's voices are very recognizable.  One thing I have noticed in many animated features nowadays is that the famous voices do little to change their voices.  But enough on that.  The story is great and has it's obvious messages about family, friends, and sharing.  Except their is a very good amount of laughing involved.  This cartoon sets forth messages about protecting wildlands but that message is also very sly at hiding under the plot.  In closing I would say that this movie is a must see for anyone who has a pulse.  It has it's cartoony gags and also some more somber moments.

171552,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,1415725659,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[1, 1]","I was very surprised (but pleased) when my 14-year-old recently chose this PG film over a menu of several other PG-13 movies. I was still happier that both of us enjoyed it fully.The story line is basic--selfish RJ raccoon (Bruce Willis) steals food from the hibernating bear Vincent (Nick Nolte), who awakens and demands that RJ return the booty within a week, or else. Being a loner, RJ fears his sudden and total demise, until he encounters a posse of animals, also awakening for the spring, only to find their wide forest range severely clipped by a new condo development and its strange, imposing barrier hedge.The mismatched bunch of foragers, led by the turtle Verne (Garry Shandling) despairs of starving the next winter, until the wily RJ convinces them that endless food supplies lie just beyond the hedge, naturally, with only his own urgent needs in mind. Thus armed with convenient new allies--a feline-impersonating skunk (Wanda Sykes), father and daughter possums (William Shatner and Avril Lavigne), a porcupine family (parented by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) and the irrepressible, impulsive squirrel Hammy (Steve Carell)--RJ embarks upon his deceptive plan to quickly recover Vincent's cache and save himself. Verne has serious doubts, but his friends soon shift allegiances and the fun begins.But the entirely predictable and formulaic story encompasses a compelling set of cartoon antics as well as animal and human characterizations--including the overbearing, stereotypical condo chairwoman (Allison Janney) and Verminator (Thomas Haden Church).The encapsulated lessons about the integral importance of family and friends are also predictable. But these lessons can never be repeated often enough, particularly when accompanied by an original script, fully developed characters and cartoon art.Given the positive reaction of my teenager, this movie is great for kids of all ages.--Alyssa A.

171554,ABSX5TGEGRH76,1415725659,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[4, 4]","This movie is a bit of a paradox to me; even though it is a film starring little forest critters and is made so that children can enjoy it, I feel that it is directed more towards parents than kids.  By that, I don't mean that it's full of profanity and such, but it has a subtle message about our society that will fly right over the heads of kids and hit adults square in the jaw (or the stomach).  I mean, a woman I know had to drag her kids to go see it, while myself (being a 20-year-old) and my parents had more interest in it than my 13-year-old sister.The story is simple enough.  RJ (Bruce Willis) is a scheming raccoon who loves human junk food, especially Spuddies, which are a potato chip resembling Pringles.  He tries to steal the food reserves of a hibernating bear (Nick Nolte), but his plan doesn't work out, and it leads to a lot of destroyed food and an angry bear.  The bear, Vincent, gives RJ an ultimatum: get all the food back within one week or become food himself.  Knowing that such a task is impossible, RJ looks for some other animals to dupe into helping him.Meanwhile, a group of small forest creatures have just come out of hibernation.  They include Verne the Turtle (Garry Shandling), the cautious leader, Hammie the Squirrel (Steve Carrell), a hyperactive dope, Lou (Eugene Levy) and Penny (Catherine O'Hara), a porcupine couple with a few kids, Ozzie (William Shatner), an overacting possum who plays dead too often, his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne), who finds her father's overacting tiresome, and Stella (Wanda Sykes), a skunk whose self-consciousness translates into frustration about her scent.  They awake to realize that their food stores aren't as plentiful as they remembered, and that they will need to try a lot harder to find food this season.  But Hammie's discovery of a giant hedge frightens the group, as they have never seen such a thing before, and it effectively cut their forest into a fraction of what it once was, eliminating much of their food sources.  While they slept, a suburban community was erected (they must have had some amazing contractors), and the hedge seperates the ""tranquil"" suburbia from the forest.Believing that Verne and his ""family"" are his tickets to paying back Vincent, RJ convinces them that human snack food (including cookies, chips, and donuts) are many times better than the stuff they forage for.  He promises to show them how to get the food away from the humans, which leads to some hilarious social commentary.  From the animals' perspective, everything humans do revolves around food.  As he says, while the animals eat to live, we live to eat.  A telephone is a device to summon food (we call pizza places to deliver), vehicles are food transportation devices, and the dinner table is an altar upon which we worship food (saying grace).  And of course, we throw out a lot of food, which goes into garbage cans for animals to get for themselves.  But the humorous look at our culture doesn't just apply to our eating habits.  RJ points out that we use SUVs because we are slowly losing the ability to walk, while suburbia itself is attacked through the use of Gladys (Allison Janney), the president of the community, and a stereotypical suburbanite-from-hell.  As the movie goes on, RJ comes to learn the value of family, which seems to be an obligatory lesson in most kids' movies these days, but it is no more important than the jabs at our culture.The mark of a truly great kids' film is whether or not it can also appeal to adults, and this succeeds.  It is genuinely funny for both kids and adults, and yet it does not rely on dirty double entendres like Shrek (which is a good movie too).  I can't remember any joke that is too dirty, and yet there are many things that will be funny to kids and adults for very different reasons.  Enjoy Over the Hedge, but keep your brain turned on.  You may find yourself looking at your life a little differently at the film's conclusion.",5,"Fun For People of All Ages, Though Adults May Get More Out of It Than Kids",1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,3976,"['movie', 'bit', 'paradox', 'even', 'film', 'starring', 'little', 'forest', 'critters', 'made', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'feel', 'directed', 'more', 'towards', 'parents', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'full', 'profanity', 'such', 'subtle', 'message', 'society', 'will', 'fly', 'right', 'heads', 'kids', 'hit', 'adults', 'square', 'jaw', 'stomach', 'mean', 'woman', 'know', 'had', 'drag', 'kids', 'go', 'see', 'being', '20-year-old', 'parents', 'had', 'more', 'interest', '13-year-old', 'sister.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'RJ', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'scheming', 'raccoon', 'who', 'human', 'junk', 'food', 'especially', 'Spuddies', 'are', 'potato', 'chip', 'resembling', 'Pringles', 'steal', 'food', 'reserves', 'hibernating', 'bear', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'plan', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'destroyed', 'food', 'angry', 'bear', 'bear', 'Vincent', 'RJ', 'ultimatum', 'get', 'food', 'back', 'one', 'week', 'become', 'food', 'Knowing', 'task', 'impossible', 'RJ', 'other', 'animals', 'dupe', 'helping', 'him.Meanwhile', 'group', 'small', 'forest', 'creatures', 'have', 'just', 'come', 'hibernation', 'include', 'Verne', 'Turtle', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'cautious', 'leader', 'Hammie', 'Squirrel', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'hyperactive', 'dope', 'Lou', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Penny', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'porcupine', 'couple', 'few', 'kids', 'Ozzie', 'William', 'Shatner', 'overacting', 'possum', 'who', 'dead', 'too', 'often', 'daughter', 'Heather', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'who', 'father', 'overacting', 'tiresome', 'Stella', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'skunk', 'self-consciousness', 'translates', 'frustration', 'scent', 'awake', 'realize', 'food', 'stores', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'plentiful', 'remembered', 'will', 'need', 'try', 'lot', 'harder', 'find', 'food', 'season', 'Hammie', 'discovery', 'giant', 'hedge', 'group', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'thing', 'effectively', 'cut', 'forest', 'fraction', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'eliminating', 'much', 'food', 'sources', 'slept', 'suburban', 'community', 'was', 'erected', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'amazing', 'contractors', 'hedge', 'tranquil', 'suburbia', 'forest.Believing', 'Verne', 'family', 'are', 'tickets', 'paying', 'back', 'Vincent', 'RJ', 'human', 'snack', 'food', 'including', 'cookies', 'chips', 'donuts', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'better', 'stuff', 'forage', 'show', 'how', 'get', 'food', 'away', 'humans', 'hilarious', 'social', 'commentary', 'animals', 'perspective', 'everything', 'humans', 'do', 'revolves', 'food', 'animals', 'eat', 'live', 'live', 'eat', 'telephone', 'device', 'summon', 'food', 'call', 'pizza', 'places', 'deliver', 'vehicles', 'are', 'food', 'transportation', 'devices', 'dinner', 'table', 'altar', 'worship', 'food', 'saying', 'grace', 'course', 'throw', 'out', 'lot', 'food', 'garbage', 'cans', 'animals', 'get', 'humorous', 'look', 'culture', ""n't"", 'just', 'apply', 'eating', 'habits', 'RJ', 'out', 'use', 'SUVs', 'are', 'slowly', 'losing', 'ability', 'walk', 'suburbia', 'attacked', 'use', 'Gladys', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'president', 'community', 'stereotypical', 'suburbanite-from-hell', 'movie', 'RJ', 'learn', 'value', 'family', 'be', 'obligatory', 'lesson', 'most', 'kids', 'movies', 'days', 'more', 'important', 'jabs', 'culture.The', 'mark', 'truly', 'great', 'kids', 'film', 'not', 'can', 'also', 'appeal', 'adults', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'kids', 'adults', 'yet', 'not', 'rely', 'dirty', 'double', 'entendres', 'Shrek', 'good', 'movie', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'joke', 'too', 'dirty', 'yet', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'funny', 'kids', 'adults', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'Enjoy', 'Hedge', 'keep', 'brain', 'turned', 'may', 'find', 'looking', 'life', 'little', 'differently', 'film', 'conclusion']",N/A

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[1, 1]","When a ""family"" of forest creatures wakes up one fine Spring day they discover that the humans have been busy all winter -- planting a slice of civilization and one huge hedge to separate them from the dwindling little patch of nature where they live. Now there won't be enough food for the animals to gather and store for the next Winter. Then along comes a scoundrel of a raccoon named RJ (Bruce Willis) with a plan:  to use their food-gathering skills in a series of well organized raids on the tract homes over the hedge.  What they don't know is that RJ has his own plans for all that food, and they don't include sharing.Over the Hedge is a cracking good comedy about mankind's excesses with a talent for understating its obvious environmental message.  Our modern suburban lifestyle takes quite a few jabs (human in a SUV while on the cell phone as she nearly flattens the turtle: ""sure I can talk, I'm only driving""), many of which hit home with me personally (says RJ as he shows his friends around, ""this is where they worship the food...this is how they deliver the food...this is how they work off the guilt so that they can eat *more* food!""). But it's all truth that never comes across as preachy because it's just so dang funny...kinda like The Lorax for this generation, minus the high-horse.This movie has everything going for it:  great lineup of voice talents, appropriately cartoonish CGI characters, good food for thought (heh!) and rapid-fire jokes for all ages.

171558,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,1415725659,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[83, 95]","""Over the Hedge"" is funny. Pure summer fun, the kind of movie a car full of seventh grade boys see with a car full of seventh grade girls. While it was only released in May, it has all the makings of a summer movie, like the old Peanuts movies. Nothing here is too complicated to understand, most of it is pretty silly, and all of it is safe for the entire family.When movies are made, they intend an audience, and an audience reaction. Here, the bar was not set to be compared to the sentimental depth of ""Finding Nemo,"" or the abject, hyperactive hilarity of ""Aladdin."" Here, ""Over the Hedge"" has a basic plot, and a basic conflict, and does the job it sets out to do.RJ the Raccoon owes a very angry bear a wagon load of snacks, and realizes the new human suburb is packed with these snacks. He meets up with a friendly, but not too smart neighborhood of small forest animals, led by a careful-thinking turtle named Vern.The characters are strong, each is distinguished from the other, with distinctive personalities, unlike the overblown homogeny found in some cartoons. This matters especially here, as there are more animals than some younger children will be familiar with.Can RJ persuade the animals to help him steal the snacks from the humans? Will Vern remain the sensible leader, and help them avoid the 'Verminator' and his viscous animal killing tools?For me, the funniest scene is an almost Matrix-like action sequence when the ordinarily hyper Hammy drinks a caffeine drink and goes in on a mission. Time stops, but not for Hammy.The animation is good enough, and the story is told straight-ahead, without catchy songs. No one will leave the theater thinking, ""That's incredible production value!"" They will leave laughing, with an original story.The structure of the movie is the reverse of Man vs his environment. As the humans take over former forest, there are fewer places for the animals to find food. Naturally, the animals smell potato chips and want more. Naturally, also, the humans want to retain a hedge between the woods and their home.Messages about Man encroaching on his environment are throughout, but these do not overtake the movie. It might leave a few suburban moms and dads feeling a little sheepish, but everyone will laugh too much to really have a guilt trip.I fully recommend ""Over the Hedge.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,Pure Summer Fun,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,2379,"['Hedge', 'funny', 'Pure', 'summer', 'fun', 'kind', 'movie', 'car', 'full', 'seventh', 'grade', 'boys', 'see', 'car', 'full', 'seventh', 'grade', 'girls', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'May', 'makings', 'summer', 'movie', 'old', 'Peanuts', 'movies', 'Nothing', 'here', 'too', 'complicated', 'understand', 'most', 'pretty', 'silly', 'safe', 'entire', 'family.When', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'intend', 'audience', 'audience', 'reaction', 'Here', 'bar', 'was', 'not', 'set', 'be', 'compared', 'sentimental', 'depth', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'abject', 'hyperactive', 'hilarity', 'Aladdin', 'Here', 'Hedge', 'basic', 'plot', 'basic', 'conflict', 'job', 'out', 'do.RJ', 'Raccoon', 'very', 'angry', 'wagon', 'load', 'snacks', 'new', 'human', 'suburb', 'packed', 'snacks', 'up', 'friendly', 'not', 'too', 'smart', 'neighborhood', 'small', 'forest', 'animals', 'led', 'careful-thinking', 'turtle', 'named', 'Vern.The', 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'distinguished', 'other', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'overblown', 'homogeny', 'found', 'cartoons', 'matters', 'especially', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'animals', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'with.Can', 'RJ', 'persuade', 'animals', 'help', 'steal', 'snacks', 'humans', 'Will', 'Vern', 'remain', 'sensible', 'leader', 'help', 'avoid', ""'Verminator"", 'viscous', 'animal', 'killing', 'tools', 'funniest', 'scene', 'almost', 'Matrix-like', 'action', 'sequence', 'when', 'ordinarily', 'hyper', 'Hammy', 'caffeine', 'drink', 'mission', 'Time', 'not', 'Hammy.The', 'animation', 'good', 'enough', 'story', 'told', 'straight-ahead', 'catchy', 'songs', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'thinking', 'incredible', 'production', 'value', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'original', 'story.The', 'structure', 'movie', 'reverse', 'Man', 'vs', 'environment', 'humans', 'take', 'over', 'former', 'forest', 'are', 'fewer', 'places', 'animals', 'find', 'food', 'Naturally', 'animals', 'smell', 'potato', 'chips', 'want', 'more', 'Naturally', 'also', 'humans', 'want', 'retain', 'hedge', 'woods', 'home.Messages', 'Man', 'encroaching', 'environment', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'overtake', 'movie', 'might', 'leave', 'few', 'suburban', 'moms', 'dads', 'feeling', 'little', 'sheepish', 'everyone', 'will', 'laugh', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'have', 'guilt', 'trip.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Hedge', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

Throughout the movie, you will see the animals (such as a turtle, squirrel and skunk) find sneaky and creative ways to gather peoples better-tasting food and bring it back to the forest.The other plot, however, occurs in the beginning of the film, and is about a raccoon that has one week to bring back a bears bag of food that he stole.  The bear woke up while the raccoon was stealing it, and said ""you have one week"".  So the raccoon joins up with the other forest animals in search of food.It's a pretty funny animated film, and the animation itself looks quite real in some spots (such as when they show that one Home Owners President sleeping in bed and the other scene showing screaming children afraid of the forest animals that arrive to their driveway).The story does a great job making food the main subject and the most important thing about a wild animals life.

Not only do they have to compete against some truly marvelous predecessors (see SHREK, HOODWINKED, and FINDING NEMO), they also have to entertain not just kids, but adults who enjoy taking their kids to watch such films.OVER THE HEDGE has some great animation and some good voices, but we've seen these things time and again. It also has a morally upstanding storyline (i.e., not betraying your friends and becoming a part of something bigger than just yourself), but we've seen that ad nauseam, too (ICE AGE). What most movie watchers want -- regardless if it's animated or live-action -- is something fresh, new, and engaging. And that is where Over The Hedge fails. We get the same old story, the same great animation, and the same impressive voice cast.It is the cast that'll keep you watching it, too. Bruce Willis (DIE HARD) is the main character, starring as RJ, a raccoon with a big problem. He attempts to steal all of the food from a hibernating grizzly's cave (Vincent voiced by the gravelly sounding Nick Nolte, THE GOOD THIEF). When the bear awakens before RJ can make good his getaway, RJ accidentally lets go of all the food and it slides down the mountain and is destroyed. He's then given an ultimatum: get the bears food back within a week or be eaten alive. So RJ heads out and stumbles upon an interspecies family that have awakened one morning to find their wilderness world encroached upon by a huge hedge. Urban sprawl has come to their neck of the woods, and this ragtag group's leader Verne (Gary Shandling, THE GARY SHANDLING SHOW) must find out what this hedge is for and why it's there. But Verne is just one turtle and needs the help of his extended family. They include Hammy (Steve Carrell, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE), a nonplused squirrel with hyperactive sensibilities; Stella (Wanda Sykes, POOTIE TANG), a skunk with an image problem; Ozzie (William Shatner, MISS CONGENIALITY), an overly-dramatic possum caring for his family; and a few others.RJ runs into this clan and spots an opportunity to gather the food he needs for the bear. Manipulating his way into the family, he teaches them about junk food, dumpster diving, and the human world ""over the hedge."" But with the human world comes danger. Most notable among them is Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church, SIDEWAYS), a varment exterminator. Will RJ risk this innocent animal family in order to save his own neck? The answer isn't surprising.Certainly the voices are entertaining, even more so than the script the actors read. Special notice has to go to Steve Carrell for his hyper-Hammy squirrel who avoids caffeinated beverages until the end when his super-speed is increased to Matrix-like proportions. Also, William Shatner's Shakespearean possum is flat-out fun. But that's it.

The 3D special effects (yes, similar to Toy Story and Cars) really makes the movie come alive, and is really no different from any other cartoon like movie that I seen. I believe the plot was executed almost perfectly, and all the parts are played very well. I believe some of the effects were cool too, like the traps the exterminator placed in the yard for instance. At some parts of the movie I was laughing, because it was funny, especially with the skunk character. The only problem I had was that the plot seemed like it went in circles, because they got the food and ended up loosing it which made it seem like a waste of 20 minutes.

Eventually, the animals succeed in overcoming their enemies and return to a simple but happy life in the woods.This movie is certainly better than most of the brain numbing junk that Hollywood puts out for children. I thought it was cool how the animals personalities and life strategies actually mirrored their species. For example, raccons are aggressive scavangers of human food, possums play dead and porcupines talk with a Midwestern accent, (OK so maybe not the last one). In any case, this movie points out the excesses of suburban affluence and human consumption while offering an ecological message in a funny and charming manner.

""Over the Hedge"" is much more than a kid's movie: it's a story that goes beyond the boundaries of traditional child-friendly works by presenting a humorous yet honest analysis of American consumerism. Because of that, it's one of the most refreshing cinematic experiences I've had in a while. Finally, we get to see the American dream from a different viewpoint--in this case, the viewpoint of woodland animals. I found that this enabled me to examine just how we define success as human beings. The animals see that humans define success by gathering food. Lots of food. Enough food to keep their bellies full for the next decade and a half. Yet they keep getting more of it, something that RJ, a streetwise raccoon (Bruce Willis), doesn't find surprising at all. As he points out, ""For them, enough is never enough!""We have to thank Michael Fry and T. Lewis for creating the original comic strip. The transition from newspaper to screen did not deter from the personality types of the characters; if anything, they're more complex. In a strange sort of way, RJ has the appeal of the charming Mysterious Stranger. He's smooth talking and persuasive, and he has the advantage of knowing a thing or two about how the outside world works. At the same time, he's self serving and deceitful, qualities brought on out of sheer desperation. The opening scenes show him trying to steal a stash of junk food from the cave of the hibernating Vincent (Nick Nolte), a hardened grizzly bear. He catches RJ in the act, a tense moment resulting in the loss of everything Vincent had horded. He then gives RJ an ultimatum: either he returns every bit of food in one week's time (the start of spring), or he gets himself killed. As a way of showing who's really in control, Vincent also demands some non edible items, including a wagon and a blue colored cooler (for him, no other color will do).Immediately after this is established, a group of animals awaken after the winter hibernation. It's led by Verne (Gary Shandling), a turtle who has the ability to remove his shell at will and can count the number of days before the winter season. The other members are: the Fargo-esque porcupine family of Lou (Eugene Levy), Penny (Catherine O'Hara), Bucky (Sami Kirkpatrick), Spike (Shane Baumel), and Quillo (Madison Davenport); the sass-talking skunk Stella (Wanda Sykes); the hyperactive squirrel Hammy (Steve Carell); and the overacting possum family of Ozzie (William Shatner) and Heather (Avril Lavigne). Upon awakening, they find that their food supply has dwindled down to almost nothing. This means that it's time to start looking for more in preparation for the next winter.But there's a problem: a gigantic hedge has mysteriously appeared, blocking access to everything they need. Verne volunteers to take a peek at the other side. What he finds doesn't do much to bolster his confidence; it's a mass of concrete, wood, and metal called the backyard of a house. Apparently, a big residential company had built an entire neighborhood on an area that was once wild forestland. It's headed by Gladys (Allison Janney), the uptight, overly business oriented president of a homeowners association. All she let remain for the animals was a few acres of natural sanctuary. Separating them from civilization is the neatly trimmed hedge (which, interestingly, the animals call Steve).This is when RJ pops up, and he immediately sees a way out of his predicament: he'll convince them to gather Vincent's new stash by pretending to help them with their problem. It's not an easy sell at first, especially for Verne; he claims that his tail is tingling, which indicates that he senses trouble. But when RJ opens a bag of nacho-flavored corn chips for them, the seduction is too much to resist. They simply have to have more of that kind of food, the stuff that tastes better than the berries, bark, nuts, and leaves they've been eating their whole lives. Being the leader, Verne remains skeptical of the idea, claiming that RJ doesn't have their best interests at heart. The others dismiss Verne's resistance as jealousy. Eventually, he begins to think that they might be right.Leading the other animals into the suburbs, RJ regales the group with his perceptions of human behavior. This is the point at which the majority of the film's satire makes itself known, and while it's all presented tongue-in-cheek, the reality behind it is undeniable (and if you think about it, somewhat disturbing). They first walk past an SUV, something so big that it prompts Ozzie to ask just how many people it can hold. RJ replies, ""Usually one."" He then examines how a human's life perpetually revolves around food: a dining room table is the alter where they worship food; the phone is the instrument used to bring food to them; the car is a method of delivering food; an antacid tablet in water is an elixir for the discomfort of eating too much food; and most importantly, a garbage can is where all the unwanted food is collected, leaving it all at an animal's disposal.With all this in mind, the group begins collecting everything on RJ's list. They go through many comedic misadventures along the way, including some encounters with Dwayne (Thomas Haden Church), an exterminator hired by Gladys to keep her neighborhood free from vermin. He's so foolishly serious about his job he occasionally mistakes a plastic lawn flamingo for the real thing. Some of these kinds of moments are a little over the top, such as when RJ and Verne joyride on a runaway wagon filled with boxes of junk food. They're being chased by an overly friendly dog (who says nothing more than ""Play, play, play!"") and eventually, they latch onto a propane tank. Yes, the end result was funny, but it also felt contrived; it just didn't quite mesh with the satirical tone of the story.Then again, this is an animated family film, and I guess that requires some moments of comedy relief. And in most cases, it worked beautifully. Case in point: Hammy. This character practically steals the movie; he's so edgy and energetic that you just can't help cracking up when watching him. He doesn't walk from one place to another so much as he zooms, as if he were Sonic the Hedgehog on speed. He immediately takes a liking to RJ, at one point asking him, ""You want to help me find my nuts?"" RJ reciprocates Hammy's affection, but there's only so much of his hyperactivity he can take; there is, after all, a reason why he refuses to let Hammy have even the tiniest sip of soda. However, that was said under calm circumstances. The moment eventually comes when an extra jolt in his system is needed, a moment when the other animals face the possibility of death. The scene showing Hammy's reaction to caffeine is absolutely priceless, not only because of the humor, but because of the clever pacing, as well.There are plenty of other gags in ""Over the Hedge"" that will keep kids giggling, and rest assured, all of them are enjoyable. However, the adult in me found the biting commentaries much more impressive. I also found the underlying theme of belonging and togetherness to be appropriate; the animals grow closer as the film progresses, even in the midst of Verne's stubbornness and RJ's lying. He does feel guilty about his false sincerity, and he knows that if he wants to settle down and make friends, he needs to finally come clean. This sense of humanity balanced perfectly with the story's cynical edge, and the end result is a film that both children and adults will find very entertaining. It's a great example of how family films ought to be made. Hopefully, there will be more of them in the future.",4,"The ""Food, Glorious Food"" of the Animal Kingdom",1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,7739,"['Who', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'animated', 'family',

171581,AUHG8KSHI529U,1415725659,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","This movie is based on characters in a newspaper comic strip, however since I have never read the strip I know nothing more about it.  I can tell you that this movie is a great deal of fun.  When I was a kid we always compared things.  It was the Beatles versus The Rolling Stones.  It was also Bugs Bunny versus Disney.  I was a Bugs Bunny kind of guy because I like the nuttiness and the satire and found the Disney a bit too sweet.  Well, this movie has the zaniness of Warner Brothers' Bugs, but not the bite.  The Dreamworks folks kept the sweetness, but not to the point of saccharine.The movie is centered around a raccoon named R. J. (Bruce Willis) who is trying to get some food (as raccoons always do).  In desperation, he tries to take the food from a hibernating bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte) but manages to wake the bear while destroying all the bear's food.  R. J. promises Vincent that he will restore all his food including his blue cooler and his Spuddies (something like Pringles) and Vincent assures him that if anything is missing he will eat him.This brings R. J. to a new subdivision to try and get the food, but he needs help.  He locates the remaining small patch of woods and the rest of the story's characters.  It is a small group of animals who have bonded to survive (a la Disney) and are led by a turtle named Verne (Garry Shandling).  They view themselves as a family and consist of Hammy the hyperactive squirrel (Steve Carrell), a skunk named Stella (Wanda Sykes), a pair of porcupines - Lou and Penny (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) and their three kids, and a father opossum, Ozzie (William Shatner), with his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne).Each of these characters makes their contribution to the movie in all kinds of fun ways.  At one point R. J. and Verne are chased by Nugent the Dog whose barks are the word ""play"" in various forms of expression.  And one of my favorite scenes is when William Shatner's Ozzie is overacting a death scene in front of some humans as a diversion we get to enjoy Shatner's self-effacing performance but when the perspective shifts to the humans discussing what the heck the opossum is doing we hear the animal's squeaks instead of words.  Very funny.I won't get into more of the plot even though it is quite simple because you should discover it for yourself.  There are two human characters who are the other two bad guys in the film (along with Vincent the Bear).

So it may not be as involved as say 'Shrek' but its funny and happy and thats what matters.  RJ (Willis) is a racoon with a problem.  He tried to steal some food and toys from a hibernating bear (Nick Nolte) and was caught just after he accidentily destroyed it all and so now he has just about a week to steal it all back.  To do so he enlists the help of some neighborhood animals who are in shock to find that while they were hybernating themselves there forest was condensed to pretty much a backyard and they are living in the middle of a new housing community.  RJ offers his help to the group in storing food for the winter, all in an effort to pay back his debt.  Verne (Garry Shandling) is the turtle leader of the group and immediatly objects to RJ's help, but RJ is so smooth he wins over the others with promise of endless food, food like they've never tasted before...and once they try some (the whole cookie scene is priceless) they want more and more.  There's laughs, and danger, and then theres this whole moral thing at the end about friendship and loyalty but for the most part it's just a really fun film.  Steve Carell as Hammy the squirrel is brilliant as is William Shatner as Oz the Possum...the whole voice-over cast is very well casted and they all bring life to this wonderful cartoon.

171587,A31A9GENAJYD64,1415725659,David M. Rossi,"[4, 7]","What an astonishing amount of animated fodder we have been subjected to this past year. The computer animated fare just keeps on coming, whether we want it to or not. This is not surprising. Ten years ago or so when the the computer animation geniuses at Pixar gave us movies like A Bugs Life and Toy Story, they were multi layered stories with terrific development in the way of characterization and plot with little or no sappy songs of traditional animated family barf fests. In no time, people stopped going to see the latest traditional animation choices in favor of these wonders of the technological age. Well, with the lack of competition in that arena, and the lack of revenue from old style animation, studios got busy, no make that SUPER busy with pumping out creation after creation of shoddily produced empty stories aimed at keeping the almighty dollar flowing in on the fanfare promise of great computer whizbang choices from recent years past. We go to the theater again and again hoping to see the next Monsters Inc. or Shrek only to find another Shark Tale. While Over the Hedge is not necessarily on a par with the worst of the bunch in this arena, it is all too clear they have fallen considerably short of the brilliance mark as well. I will give credit where it is due, the casting department for the voices found all the right stars, and Over The Hedge certainly has enough star power for the voices. The look of the movie is brilliant to say the least. The animals look so terrific, you wish you could reach out and stroke their lifelike fur. There are some clever moments and well written comments as well, but all in all, other than these fleeting moments of beauty and brilliance, Hedge doesn't truly deliver on it's promise of a movie for everyone to love. The movie could have been done as a short film of no more than a half hour and probably would have been more or at least as interesting. There just isn't enough to sustain the storyline for the long seeming hour and a half running time. Much like Twitchy the squirrel from the fantastic best computer animated movie this year, Hoodwinked, Hammy The squirrel clearly has many of the best moments in Hedge with his abundant energy and lack of IQ to propel him along a slapsticky, silly road to make us laugh. Note to the animation stations: Give us more of the greatness of Hedge with more character development and storyline before computer animation goes the way of traditional animation: right down the proverbial drain.",3,"Cute, but needs more oomph to make it over the hedge",1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,2506,"['What', 'astonishing', 'amount', 'animated', 'fodder', 'have', 'been', 'subjected', 'past', 'year', 'computer', 'animated', 'fare', 'just', 'keeps', 'coming', 'want', 'not', 'not', 'surprising', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'when', 'computer', 'animation', 'geniuses', 'Pixar', 'gave', 'movies', 'Bugs', 'Life', 'Toy', 'Story', 'were', 'multi', 'layered', 'stories', 'terrific', 'development', 'way', 'characterization', 'plot', 'little', 'sappy', 'songs', 'traditional', 'animated', 'family', 'barf', 'fests', 'time', 'people', 'stopped', 'going', 'see', 'latest', 'traditional', 'animation', 'choices', 'favor', 'wonders', 'technological', 'age', 'Well', 'lack', 'competition', 'arena', 'lack', 'revenue', 'old', 'style', 'animation', 'studios', 'got', 'busy', 'make', 'SUPER', 'pumping', 'out', 'creation', 'creation', 'shoddily', 'produced', 'empty', 'stories', 'aimed', 'keeping', 'almighty', 'dollar', 'flowing', 'fanfare', 'promise', 'great', 'computer', 'whizbang', 'choices', 'recent', 'years', 'past', 'go', 'theater', 'again', 'again', 'hoping', 'see', 'next', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Shrek', 'only', 'find', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'Hedge', 'not', 'necessarily', 'par', 'worst', 'bunch', 'arena', 'too', 'clear', 'have', 'fallen', 'considerably', 'short', 'brilliance', 'mark', 'well', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'casting', 'department', 'voices', 'found', 'right', 'stars', 'Hedge', 'certainly', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'voices', 'look', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'say', 'least', 'animals', 'look', 'so', 'terrific', 'wish', 'could', 'reach', 'out', 'stroke', 'lifelike', 'fur', 'are', 'clever', 'moments', 'well', 'written', 'comments', 'well', 'other', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'beauty', 'brilliance', 'Hedge', ""n't"", 'truly', 'deliver', 'promise', 'movie', 'everyone', 'love', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'short', 'film', 'more', 'half', 'hour', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'least', 'interesting', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sustain', 'storyline', 'long', 'seeming', 'hour', 'half', 'running', 'time', 'Much', 'Twitchy', 'squirrel', 'fantastic', 'best', 'computer', 'animated', 'movie', 'year', 'Hoodwinked', 'Hammy', 'squirrel', 'clearly', 'many', 'best', 'moments', 'Hedge', 'abundant', 'energy', 'lack', 'IQ', 'propel', 'along', 'slapsticky', 'silly', 'road', 'make', 'laugh', 'Note', 'animation', 'stations', 'Give', 'more', 'greatness', 'Hedge', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'storyline', 'computer', 'animation', 'way', 'traditional', 'animation', 'right', 'proverbial', 'drain']",N/A

171594,AFEOC3D8WKN1D,1415725659,Deirdre,"[16, 46]","I don't know how to put this lightly, so I won't, this movie is garbage in it's purest form (if garbage can be pure). It rips off a plot and changes the setting to make it unrecognizable. Here let me take you on a tour of the problems with this movie:Plot: One animal needs to repay another animal by getting him something. In order to do this, the first animal needs to trick a bunch of innocent, harmless animals to do his bidding by misguiding them. Throughout the course of the movie he tricks them, but feels guilty about it. At the end of the movie, he is confronted by the animal he needs to repay, while all the innocent animals are in grave danger. In the end, he decides to do the right thing and help the innocent animals, while the animal he needs to repay gets what's coming to him.Now tell me, is this the plot of Over the Hedge, or Ice Age?Humor: This is supposed to be a 'family' film, what part of 'family' does Dreamworks 'not' understand, family is supposed to be clean humor, this is not, clean humor. As with 'Shrek', 'Madagascar' and (to a lesser extent) 'Wallace and Gromit', Dreamworks has successfully weaved very crude and even sexual humor through there so called 'family films', this one is no exception. This one successfully uses farting, burping, snot and even jokes about a male squirrel and his 'nuts' as it's main source of humor, now, I don't mind if a family movie has one or two farting or burping jokes in it, but this movie was unrelentless, it just 'wouldn't stop'. But the main problem is that some crude humor can be relatively funny, in this movie, I think I might have giggled, once, no more, no less. Also, unlike the afore mentioned films, this film wasn't even well made to begin with, so it doesn't have much going for it.Characters: As with almost all animated films, every character has there own 'problem'. In 'Finding Nemo', Marlin was overprotective of his son, in 'A Bug Life' Flik is absent-minded and is of no particular help to his 'colony'. In 'Over the Hedge' the creators attempt at mulitple characters with problems, the problem is, the audience doesn't make the connection that the characters have problems until they're already solved. For instance; One character and apparently under-appreciates her dad, this was only mentioned once in the film, and it was her just briefly barrates her dad for being a wimp, at the end of the film, she stops underappreciating her dad and follows in his footsteps.

Things get complicated when the suburbanites call in a professional (Thomas Hayden Church) to exterminate them.Some animated movies are far deeper than just being ""kid's cartoons."" Sometimes, even though the kids will love the movie, the writers are also trying to entertain the adults. They put in a little bit of ""adult humor"" that goes over the heads of the young. They make it extra-witty and insightful to entertain folks of every age. They put in hidden political or philosophical references. They riff on pop-culture in ironic, subversive ways.Some animated movies do those sorts of things. Over the Hedge does not. It's a kid's movie about a group of animals trying to steal food.This is not a complaint. It is not a criticism. It is just an observation. Over the Hedge is a quality animated film. The plot is good and fun, the characters are cute and the voices are top-notch (Eugene Levy, Bruce Willis, William Shatner to name a few). Children will be very entertained by this movie, and parents will enjoy it too based on the simple virtues that it does possess. However, older teenagers, and adults who have no children, shoudn't go out of their way to see this feature. It was written fairly exclusively for the entertainment of the younger set, unlike some other recent animated films such as The Incredibles, Chicken Run, The Road to El Dorado, etc.For children, this is a five-star film.

The hysterical action only gets better when the put-upon suburbanites call in an exterminator.  RJ will face a final crisis of conscience when his debt to the bear comes due.The animation is first-rate and the pacing is frantic, funny, and true to the comic strip.

It's a story I've lived through myself and I can remember all the skunks, possums, raccoons, snakes, coyotes and whatnot all that visited my yard in the early days of my new house on the edge of a developing area. The cartoon story is amusingly told and provides a lot of chuckles.The cutesy-poo animals are, well, too cutesy-poo for my tastes. I suppose kids will especially enjoy them. The voices are very well done and the animals' antics are consistently amusing. To me, the best animations in the movie are their enemies, the Verminator and the Homeowner's Association Lady. Now, these are not cutesy-poo! Adults will all understand and recognize them from their own lives. I guess one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie is that adults and kids can both watch it together and both laugh at different things. It's good light entertainment.

Verne, a turtle, tries to resists R.J.'s efforts to bring them into the ""good life,"" saying that his shell is tingling and there's something wrong with R.J.""Over the Hedge"" is full of crazy sight gags, hearkening back to classic animation. It's based on a comic strip and shares with it the same general style of humor. This film is also packed with celebrity voices, including standout Wanda Sykes as a skunk with a chip on her shoulder, and William Shatner as an overly-dramatic possum. My favorite characters however, are the porcupine kids --- cute little tykes who have become hopped up on sugar. Also great is Hammy, the hyperactive squirrel who ""likes a cookie.""Since you're getting the DVD, you're also getting a great set of special features. Let's take a look...- Making Of - You get an inside look at the general production of the film, commentary both by and about the actors that do the voices and a look at the special effects. Top-notch, well put-together, and enjoyable.- Dwayne's Verm-Tech Infomercial - A hilarious spoof comes out of a line from the film that was never in the original script, but was in-fact ad-libbed.- Artwork Galleries - Everything from concept art to storyboards. Fun to see the evolution of the characters and the film design.- Looks at two upcoming DreamWorks films ""Bee Movie"" and ""Shrek the Third."" There was some stuff here I hadn't seen about either film before, so this was wonderful.- Hammy's Boomerang Adventure - This bonus short in which R.J. and the porcupine kids prank Hammy and later Verne is great fun.- Games - Well, there are two games, but neither of them are great. There's a game in which you try to guide Hammy with R.J.'s laser pointer, but it just seems confusing. And there's a nut toss game which would have been fun if it had been better executed, but it kept going back to a try again screen after each toss. I can let these ride though.Overall, ""Over the Hedge"" is over-the-top great fun. Depending on your or your kids' sense of humor, you might not like it, but it's worth a try.",5,"""But I Like a Cookie""",1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,2700,"['Hedge', 'Dreamworks', 'picture', 'witting', 'biting', 'commentary', 'suburbian', 'life', 'anyone', 'else', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'agree', 'morals', 'times', 'movie', 'amazing', 'humor', 'truly', 'funny', 'fun', 'times', 'very', 'cute', 'characters.Basic', 'plot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'spoiling', 'much', 'R.J.', 'raccoon', 'who', 'big', 'trouble', 'bear', 'took', 'food', 'human', 'food', 'had', 'gathered', 'now', 'bear', 'back', 'going', 'kill', 'R.J', 'So', 'R.J.', 'help', 'group', 'animals', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'discovered', 'hedge', 'forest', 'where', 'live', 'new', 'suburban', 'development', 'Verne', 'turtle', 'tries', 'resists', 'R.J.', 'efforts', 'bring', 'good', 'life', 'saying', 'shell', 'tingling', 'something', 'wrong', 'R.J.', 'Hedge', 'full', 'crazy', 'sight', 'gags', 'hearkening', 'back', 'classic', 'animation', 'based', 'comic', 'strip', 'shares', 'same', 'general', 'style', 'humor', 'film', 'also', 'packed', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'including', 'standout', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'skunk', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'William', 'Shatner', 'overly-dramatic', 'possum', 'favorite', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'porcupine', 'kids', 'cute', 'little', 'tykes', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'hopped', 'up', 'sugar', 'Also', 'great', 'Hammy', 'hyperactive', 'squirrel', 'who', 'cookie', ""'re"", 'getting', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'also', 'getting', 'great', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'Let', 'take', 'look', 'Making', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'general', 'production', 'film', 'commentary', 'actors', 'do', 'voices', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'Top-notch', 'well', 'put-together', 'enjoyable.-', 'Dwayne', 'Verm-Tech', 'Infomercial', 'hilarious', 'spoof', 'line', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'in-fact', 'ad-libbed.-', 'Artwork', 'Galleries', 'Everything', 'concept', 'art', 'storyboards', 'Fun', 'see', 'evolution', 'characters', 'film', 'design.-', 'Looks', 'two', 'upcoming', 'DreamWorks', 'films', 'Bee', 'Movie', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'was', 'stuff', 'here', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful.-', 'Hammy', 'Boomerang', 'Adventure', 'bonus', 'short', 'R.J.', 'porcupine', 'kids', 'prank', 'Hammy', 'later', 'Verne', 'great', 'fun.-', 'Games', 'Well', 'are', 'two', 'games', 'are', 'great', 'game', 'try', 'guide', 'Hammy', 'R.J.', 'laser', 'pointer', 'just', 'confusing', 'nut', 'toss', 'game', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'executed', 'kept', 'going', 'back', 'try', 'again', 'screen', 'toss', 'can', 'let', 'ride', 'though.Overall', 'Hedge', 'over-the-top', 'great', 'fun', 'Depending', 'kids', 'sense', 'humor', 'might', 'not', 'try']",N/A

Disgracefully a lot of DVD companies and studios know kids will use pester power to get their parents to buy their DVD movies anyway so put no effort whatsoever or a token effort at best with their DVD extras. Not so with Dreamworks and the Over the Hedge DVD which has obviously had a lot of work put into it. It is obvious the creators were proud of what they created and wanted to keep doing more which resulted in two extra very good short films as well as an interesting infomercial.  Also the behind the scenes interviews were very informative and it is great to see what the actors actually looked like who are the voices.The painstaking effort to detail on aspects such as the hair and fur is evident in the actual movie and we learn how they did it in the extras as well.  They've got a great story, big name actors for the majority of voices and a big name artist in Ben Folds for the music so probably 95% of the public who have seen this would have done so anyway with simpler animation but the makers still went to the extra effort which you just have to commend.The great childrens' movies appeal to adults as well as children and this has the humour to entertain anyone no matter what age you are, if you have kids or not.

I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast.

Verne (the turtle) has been transformed into the clan leader and voice of reason.  It is through his diligence that the local animals survive their winters.  This spring the animals awaken to find most of their forest is gone and has been replaced by suburbia.  R.J. (the racoon) meets up with them while trying to save his own hide from a hungry bear.R.J. tries to corrupt the animals into helping him gather food from the humans.  Verne is always the detractor trying to keep the status quo and remain safe.  Many adventures ensue and R.J.'s character comes to light.  Eventually the various situations are resolved in comic fashion and things work out.This is a fun story with some excellent voice characterizations but it is not the comic strip.  Some aspects of the strip do come through quite nicely.  All in all it is a fun romp of a movie with just the right mix of comedy, drama, silliness, and character development.

Though not quite in the manner you may be thinking; instead, Dreamworks opted to take the point of view of woodland creatures who have had a portion of their homes destroyed by the ever-expanding world of suburbia.""Over the Hedge"" begins with RJ (Bruce Willis), a raccoon who has had the misfortune of crossing a very angry bear (Nick Nolte) and losing all of the bear's food.  Now RJ has merely a week to replace the bear's supply of food or else pay the penalty with his life.  As RJ believes all hope is lost, he stumbles across a group of woodland creatures who have recently awakened from the winter only to discover a large portion of their beloved forest has been destroyed and replaced with what is known as `suburbia'.  This ragtag group of creatures consisting of a paranoid turtle named Verne (Garry Shandling), a family of porcupines, a father/daughter team of opossums (William Shatner and Avril Lavigne) and an overly hyperactive squirrel named Hammy (Steve Carell), are trying to figure out just what has happened to their forest and also what is this huge chunk of foliage standing in their way.  Enter RJ, who just so happens to know what vast treasures the garbage cans and intricately manicured lawns of suburban America can hold, and now he hopes to introduce these nave creatures to the wonders of society while at the same time using them to unknowingly assist in repaying his debt.  There's just one big problem with the plan, the humans populating this newly completed suburb are not to keen on the woodland creatures presence in their neighborhood and have taken steps that will threaten the animals very existence.When I saw the trailer to this movie I laughed through the entire duration, especially during the previewed scenes of Hammy, and then when it was announced that it was from the creators of ""Shrek"" I had a really good feeling that this was going to be more than just an average entry into the expanding genre of computer animated films.  The story, though simplistic in nature, is also very sweet and incredibly hilarious, and is one that appeals to kids and adults alike.  The vocal talent that Dreamworks employs for their animated features continues to pull from the best that Hollywood has to offer, this time ranging from Bruce Willis (""16 Blocks""), Garry Shandling (""The Larry Sanders Show""), William Shatner (`Star Trek' franchise), and Steve Carell (""The Office""), even pop singer Avril Lavigne.  The entire cast is perfect, and the hilarious rapport that the characters share with each other is absolutely hysterical in many instances.  The animation is outstanding, which is no surprise given Dreamworks' previous efforts, and the excessive use of furry creatures was quite surprising, given how difficult fur can be to render realistically, it also serves as a perfect example for how far the technology has come.  Overall, this movie is definitely another computer animated comedy gem from the talented people that brought you ""Shrek"", and is one that the entire family can sit down and enjoy together.""Over the Hedge"" is rated PG for mildly rude humor.",5,Let the Fur Fly...,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,3285,"['having', 'achieved', 'great', 'success', 'hit', 'computer', 'animated', 'comedies', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', '2', 'creative', 'minds', 'Dreamworks', 'decided', 'tackle', 'topic', 'suburban', 'life', 'not', 'quite', 'manner', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'instead', 'Dreamworks', 'opted', 'take', 'point', 'view', 'woodland', 'creatures', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'portion', 'homes', 'destroyed', 'ever-expanding', 'world', 'suburbia', 'Hedge', 'RJ', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'raccoon', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'crossing', 'very', 'angry', 'bear', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'losing', 'bear', 'food', 'Now', 'RJ', 'merely', 'week', 'replace', 'bear', 'supply', 'food', 'else', 'pay', 'penalty', 'life', 'RJ', 'hope', 'lost', 'group', 'woodland', 'creatures', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'awakened', 'winter', 'only', 'discover', 'large', 'portion', 'beloved', 'forest', 'been', 'destroyed', 'replaced', 'what', 'known', 'suburbia', 'ragtag', 'group', 'creatures', 'consisting', 'paranoid', 'turtle', 'named', 'Verne', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'family', 'porcupines', 'father/daughter', 'team', 'opossums', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'overly', 'hyperactive', 'squirrel', 'named', 'Hammy', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'forest', 'also', 'what', 'huge', 'chunk', 'foliage', 'standing', 'way', 'Enter', 'RJ', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'vast', 'garbage', 'cans', 'intricately', 'manicured', 'lawns', 'suburban', 'America', 'can', 'hold', 'now', 'introduce', 'nave', 'creatures', 'wonders', 'society', 'same', 'time', 'using', 'unknowingly', 'assist', 'repaying', 'debt', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'plan', 'humans', 'populating', 'newly', 'completed', 'suburb', 'are', 'not', 'keen', 'woodland', 'presence', 'neighborhood', 'have', 'taken', 'steps', 'will', 'threaten', 'animals', 'very', 'existence.When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'laughed', 'entire', 'duration', 'especially', 'previewed', 'scenes', 'Hammy', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'creators', 'Shrek', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'entry', 'expanding', 'genre', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'story', 'simplistic', 'nature', 'also', 'very', 'sweet', 'incredibly', 'hilarious', 'one', 'appeals', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'vocal', 'talent', 'animated', 'features', 'pull', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'time', 'ranging', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '16', 'Blocks', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Office', 'even', 'pop', 'singer', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'entire', 'cast', 'perfect', 'hilarious', 'rapport', 'characters', 'share', 'other', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'many', 'instances', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'surprise', 'given', 'Dreamworks', 'previous', 'efforts', 'excessive', 'use', 'furry', 'creatures', 'was', 'quite', 'surprising', 'given', 'how', 'difficult', 'fur', 'can', 'be', 'render', 'realistically', 'also', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'far', 'technology', 'come', 'Overall', 'movie', 'definitely', 'computer', 'animated', 'comedy', 'gem', 'talented', 'people', 'brought', 'Shrek', 'one', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'together', 'Hedge', 'rated', 'PG', 'mildly', 'rude', 'humor']",N/A

171635,A27CHILBK6HIL2,1415725659,Kaya Savas,"[1, 1]","MOVIE: Dreamworks has built an impressive filmography with their animation department. The thing I like about Dreamworks' animated films is that they all appeal to an older audience while still retaining great characters and stories. A lot of people call Pixar the king of animation films, but their films are almost exclusively orientated towards kids. Sure, I loved Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and the rest of their films. I'm just saying I can enjoy a Dreamworks animation film more since there is more for an older audience and still plenty for the kids. Over The Hedge is centered around a raccoon who accidentally ruins a hibernating bear's food supply when he tries to steal it. He offers the less than happy bear his services to get all his food back before his hibernation ends. So, RJ the raccoon who is a solo survivor stumbles upon a social group of woodland critters who spend the entire year stocking food for the winter. When they wake up from their winter sleep they find an enormous hedge right where the wooded area used to be, and on the other side of the hedge is a huge suburban neighborhood. This is where the film's clever social commentary comes in. The movie is all about suburban sprawl and how us humans are finding more and more remote suburban locations to build communities. Now, RJ springs up a plan to get these animals to go over the hedge and get the food he needs to get to the bear before he becomes supper. The characters are all great and are voiced by an impressive cast of voices. RJ and Verne the turtle are basically the main characters here as they are the competing leaders of the group. Of course everyone will remember the movie for Steve Carell's super hyperactive squirrell, Hammy. There are some great situations and funny scenes that had me laughing, plus some great references that only an older audience would get with such lines as ""Rosebud"" and ""Stella!"". Overall, the film is a fun light-hearted affair that anybody can enjoy. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score keeps the light mood very fun and we also have some songs from Ben Folds. While the movie isn't as great as other Dreamworks animation movies such as Shrek or Chicken Run, it is definately an enjoyable movie.ACTING: The voice acting was all great. Bruce Willis voices RJ the racoon and is a perfect fit. Garry Shandling was an amazing fit for Verne the overly cautious turtle. We also get some great support from Steve Carell, William Shatner, Nick Nolte, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Wanda Sykes, and Thomas Hayden Church. They all add great fun and flavor to their characters and provide a great ensamble effort.BOTTOM LINE: The movie is great fun for the kids, and it still entertains the older audience. We get a funny look at suburban sprawl and our characters provide the laughs and learn the value of friendship, loyalty, and generosity. So, it's an overall great package that is worth seeing.",4,Great Family Fun & A Sharp Look At Suburban Sprawl,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2939,"['MOVIE', 'Dreamworks', 'built', 'impressive', 'filmography', 'animation', 'department', 'thing', 'like', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', 'films', 'appeal', 'older', 'audience', 'still', 'retaining', 'great', 'characters', 'stories', 'lot', 'people', 'call', 'Pixar', 'king', 'animation', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'orientated', 'towards', 'kids', 'Sure', 'loved', 'Toy', 'Story', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'Incredibles', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'rest', 'films', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Dreamworks', 'animation', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'older', 'audience', 'still', 'plenty', 'kids', 'Hedge', 'centered', 'raccoon', 'who', 'accidentally', 'hibernating', 'bear', 'food', 'supply', 'when', 'steal', 'less', 'happy', 'services', 'get', 'food', 'back', 'hibernation', 'So', 'RJ', 'raccoon', 'who', 'solo', 'survivor', 'stumbles', 'social', 'group', 'woodland', 'critters', 'who', 'spend', 'entire', 'year', 'stocking', 'food', 'winter', 'When', 'wake', 'up', 'winter', 'sleep', 'find', 'enormous', 'hedge', 'right', 'where', 'wooded', 'area', 'used', 'be', 'other', 'side', 'hedge', 'huge', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'film', 'clever', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', 'suburban', 'sprawl', 'how', 'humans', 'are', 'finding', 'more', 'more', 'remote', 'suburban', 'locations', 'build', 'communities', 'Now', 'RJ', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'animals', 'go', 'hedge', 'get', 'food', 'get', 'bear', 'supper', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'voiced', 'impressive', 'cast', 'voices', 'RJ', 'Verne', 'turtle', 'are', 'basically', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'competing', 'leaders', 'group', 'course', 'everyone', 'will', 'remember', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'super', 'hyperactive', 'squirrell', 'Hammy', 'are', 'great', 'situations', 'funny', 'scenes', 'had', 'laughing', 'great', 'references', 'only', 'older', 'audience', 'would', 'get', 'such', 'lines', 'Rosebud', 'Stella', 'Overall', 'film', 'fun', 'light-hearted', 'affair', 'anybody', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Rupert', 'Gregson-Williams', 'score', 'light', 'mood', 'very', 'fun', 'also', 'have', 'songs', 'Ben', 'Folds', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'other', 'Dreamworks', 'animation', 'movies', 'such', 'Shrek', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'definately', 'enjoyable', 'movie.ACTING', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'voices', 'RJ', 'racoon', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'was', 'amazing', 'fit', 'Verne', 'overly', 'cautious', 'turtle', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'support', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'add', 'great', 'fun', 'flavor', 'characters', 'provide', 'great', 'ensamble', 'effort.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'kids', 'still', 'older', 'audience', 'get', 'funny', 'look', 'suburban', 'sprawl', 'characters', 'provide', 'laughs', 'learn', 'value', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'generosity', 'So', 'overall', 'great', 'package', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

171637,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,1415725659,Kevin J. Loria,"[19, 23]","From TIM JOHNSON, the Director who brought you ANTZ, oh maybe I shouldn't have started that way......DreamWorks' animated film, ""Over the Hedge,"" is a backyard ecological comedy outfitted with some fine, silly slapstick and clever animal characters. This one is aimed more at a younger audience than other DW efforts like ""Shrek"" but has plenty of entertainment value for the rest of the fam. Unlike Pixar, DreamWorks  isn't pushing the envelope with their animation. DW is playing it safe here with a PC comedy that delivers an ecological message while pitching family values to the extreme. The CG animation is routine, but writer Len Blum (Pink Panther) along with Lorne Cameron, working from the popular comic strip and character animators under the supervision of directors Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick do a crackerjack job of filling the screen with lively, ingratiating creatures. The comic strip Created by Michael Fry and T Lewis, OVER the HEDGE takes a quirky view of suburban living from the perspective of the animals who lived there first. The comic strip, like the movie, stars RJ, a mischievous raccoon, and Verne, his sensitive best-buddy turtle. Together they ponder life and adapt their natural habitat to incorporate all the ""unnatural"" creature comforts that suburbia has to offer. Fry & Lewis have written an original screenplay for the film.RJ (voiced perfectly by Bruce Willis, why hasn't he done this before, oh yeah the ""Look Who's Talking"" movies count), arrives in a woods outside a midwest town, excited about the wonders that living near humans can bring. He finds instead a community of porcupines, possums, a squirrel, skunk and chipmunks that is deathly afraid of humans, after their leader, Vern (Gary Shandling), has had a BAD EXPERIENCE with human boys. As they get closer and closer to humans, however, their comfortable lives in the woods appears to be at an end. Motivated by RJ, however, the animals slowly breech the hedge that separates them from the brand new housing development that has destroyed their food source over the winter while they were sleeping, and RJ shows them is a world where humans throw all sorts of food away in big metal canisters, ripe for the taking. By combining RJ plans and the family's foraging talents, maybe they can fill next winter's larder in time to meet the deadline imposed by grizzly bear (Nick Nolte). When the family makes it over THE HEDGE -- well, through it -- they pilfer, led by Hammy, an overcaffeinated squirrel (Steve Carell) who is fightingly similar to the Hoodwinked overcaffeinated squirrel not voiced by Steve Carell. This leads the humans to call pest control: Dwayne the Verminator (Thomas Haden Church).This story sets in motion more than enough comic action sequences to fill the movie's 84 minutes. The final caper mimics and rivals the ""Mission: Impossible"" films' derring-do to hilarious results.Character animators beautifully marry their creatures to the voice actors' individual eccentricities.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[12, 13]","I rarely laugh hard enough to bring tears to my eyes in a flick, especially a kiddie flick, but ""Over The Hedge"" managed to make me laugh until I cried in the climax of the film.  This movie is just funny.  Sure, it has the token moral message that is expected of children's fare these days, but comedy takes center stage.The story is rather simple:  R.J. Raccoon (Bruce Willis), owes a stockpile of food to a very angry bear named Vincent (hilariously pulled off by Nick Nolte) after he's caught stealing Vincent's stash and eventually losing it.  If he doesn't get the food, ice chest, red wagon, etc. back, Vincent is going to kill him.  Luckily, R.J. stumbles upon a hapless group of small woodland pals who've awakened to a brand new suburb which has literally grown up around them during their winter hibernation.  The group is headed up by Garry Shandling's funny turtle, Verne.  He heads up an all-star group of voices such as William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, and Eugene Levy, among others.  Steve Carell steals the show as Hamilton, a very ""Hoodwinked""-like squirrel who's very, very high-strung.R.J. plans to use the groups gathering skills to collect everything he needs to pay Vincent back.  Of course, the suburbs are full of dangers for any small creature.  From Girl Scouts to a very aggressive exterminator to a playful pup, the gang faces all of these problems with funny outcomes.  Along the way, R.J. realizes that his selfish motives are wrong, and he decides to make things as right as possible between the group and Vincent.This is a wonderful tale for the entire family to see.  It includes plenty of adult ""inside"" jokes that the kids won't catch onto and plenty of slapstick humor for the kids and parents alike.  It's heartwarming at times and laugh-out-loud funny at others.I highly recommend this flick.

This is the story of a raccoon named RJay who succumbed to the temptation and tried to rob a very nasty and very big bear, named Vincent (Nick Nolte gives his voice to the bear - and he sound like a real, real bad guy!). And now he has four days to get all the food he stole (and lost) back, otherwise he is bear snack. Only one solution to do that - get some help and stole all this food from humans. And he gets some help, from a bunch of animals, whose forest was mostly destroyed.Those animals are:- Verne, a very conservative turtle (""It is me. Tentative. There are even places in my shell where I have never been yet"")- Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel, a little simple but incredibly cuddly (""Hi, I am Hammy, do you want to see my nuts?"").- Stella, a cynical, tough girl skunk (""I can clear a room. That much I can do"")- Ozzie, a possum, lone parent rising a teen aged daughter, not really very bright or courageous, but a great actor, whose voice is provided by William Shattner (""Playing possum, is what we do. We die. To live"")- Heather, his teen aged rebellious daughter. Somebody had the great idea to hire Avril Lavigne to be her voice - and it really works!- Lou and Penny, porcupines, a very loving couple rising three kids.But there is one problem: with all the food being stolen, some humans finally call Dwayne the Verminator (a verminator is like an exterminator, just meaner...) who uses equipment banished by law everywhere except Texas....""Over the Hedge"" is a very, very funny film, with a great number of gags for the kids and some one-liners, that the adults will appreciate more that the children. And then there is one moment which is simply Oscar material - a plastic chirurgical intervention to transform Stella in a gorgeous cat girl who must seduce Tiger, an enormous, nasty, almost genocidal tomcat, who happens to watch the access trap to one of the houses. Those two scenes are possibly the most irresistible moments in family movies since Shrek's courtship to Fiona!! And I almost died laughing during RJay's presentation about relation of humans and their food - one important detail here: RJay's voice is provided by Bruce Willis and it magnifies the comic effect....I simply love this movie. And one year ofter watching it my kid is still sleeping with the toy of Stella the Skunk, her favorite character....",5,"A very nice family movie, with some totally irresistible adults oriented gags",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2484,"['one', 'best', 'smartest', 'family', 'movies', 'saw', 'last', 'years', 'having', '7y', 'old', 'daughter', 'saw', 'lot', 'believe', 'story', 'raccoon', 'named', 'RJay', 'who', 'succumbed', 'temptation', 'tried', 'rob', 'very', 'nasty', 'very', 'big', 'bear', 'named', 'Vincent', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'voice', 'bear', 'real', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'now', 'four', 'days', 'get', 'food', 'stole', 'lost', 'back', 'otherwise', 'bear', 'snack', 'Only', 'one', 'solution', 'do', 'get', 'help', 'stole', 'food', 'humans', 'help', 'bunch', 'animals', 'forest', 'was', 'mostly', 'destroyed.Those', 'animals', 'are', 'Verne', 'very', 'conservative', 'turtle', 'Tentative', 'are', 'even', 'places', 'shell', 'where', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'yet', 'Hammy', 'hyperactive', 'squirrel', 'little', 'simple', 'incredibly', 'cuddly', 'Hi', 'am', 'Hammy', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'nuts', '.-', 'Stella', 'cynical', 'tough', 'girl', 'skunk', 'can', 'clear', 'room', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'Ozzie', 'possum', 'lone', 'parent', 'rising', 'teen', 'aged', 'daughter', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'bright', 'courageous', 'great', 'actor', 'voice', 'provided', 'William', 'Shattner', 'Playing', 'possum', 'what', 'do', 'die', 'live', 'Heather', 'teen', 'aged', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Somebody', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'hire', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'be', 'voice', 'really', 'Lou', 'Penny', 'porcupines', 'very', 'loving', 'couple', 'rising', 'three', 'kids.But', 'one', 'problem', 'food', 'being', 'stolen', 'humans', 'finally', 'call', 'Dwayne', 'Verminator', 'verminator', 'exterminator', 'just', 'meaner', 'who', 'equipment', 'banished', 'law', 'everywhere', 'Texas', 'Hedge', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'number', 'gags', 'kids', 'one-liners', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'children', 'then', 'one', 'moment', 'simply', 'Oscar', 'material', 'plastic', 'chirurgical', 'intervention', 'transform', 'Stella', 'gorgeous', 'cat', 'girl', 'who', 'must', 'seduce', 'Tiger', 'enormous', 'nasty', 'almost', 'genocidal', 'tomcat', 'who', 'watch', 'access', 'trap', 'one', 'houses', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'possibly', 'most', 'irresistible', 'moments', 'family', 'movies', 'Shrek', 'courtship', 'Fiona', 'almost', 'died', 'laughing', 'RJay', 'presentation', 'relation', 'humans', 'food', 'one', 'important', 'detail', 'here', 'RJay', 'voice', 'provided', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'comic', 'effect', 'simply', 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'year', 'ofter', 'watching', 'kid', 'still', 'sleeping', 'toy', 'Stella', 'Skunk', 'favorite', 'character']",N/A

171676,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,1415725659,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[5, 6]","Who has grown more fickle over the years, motion-picture studios demanding lower costs and ever higher returns or Wall Street analysts eagerly anticipating Pixar (pre-Cars) or Shrek-like numbers at the domestic box office nearly every single time a computer-animated feature-length film is released into theaters? Not too difficult to tell, really. The number of CGI animated films has grown substantially since Pixar started the trend back in 1995 with Toy Story, from one or two per year to the modern medium of the animation industry as a whole, with traditional animation all but extinct (Disney is hoping to start a revival with The Frog Princess). In the meantime the quality of the story has suffered dramatically as each studio rushes out to cash-in on the computer-animated craze which some fear will lead to the delusion of the genre is much the same way as what happened to traditional animated following the success of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King in the early `90s.The story for Over the Hedge is a well-balanced blend of satirical social commentary on the modern white middle-class suburban lifestyle as portrayed from the point-of-view of the forest creatures and family-focused entertainment. Younger children won't care so much about RJ's speech about human beings and their relationship with food (""That is the altar where they worship food ...that's what they eat when they've eaten too much food ...that gets rid of the guilt so they can eat more food"") as adults will but it's what makes this film enjoyable for everyone. RJ puts the scenario into perfect perspective with his line, ""We eat to live and these guys live to eat"". Humanity has gone a long way from being a culture in which food was a necessity to survive to one where over consumption is the norm. This is hardly a call to change our ways but it does go to show in a humorous way how far mankind has gone since the early days of our ancestors. Then of course there's how the animals have taken full advantage of our over-consumption (""And what do they do with the stuff they don't eat? They put it in gleaming silver cans, just for us"") in their co-habitation with modern suburbia. It is therefore not a coincidence that Ben Folds (Five) chose ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" (obviously with more family-oriented lyrics then the Ozzie Osbourne original) as the closing song at the start of the credits.Over the Hedge if given the chance could have easily slipped into a running political commentary on the detrimental eating habits of the `fast food nation', that free will no longer exists with fat-cat restaurant conglomerates holding their sway over us (Ronald McDonald holding a gun to your head and yelling, `Eat the sandwich, fatty!'), or how American materialism is encroaching upon the environment and the lives of the animals in it, but thankfully it doesn't. It is hard to imagine someone actually doing just that with a family film but Over the Hedge walks such a slippery slope that it is not inconceivable.Bruce Willis is easily recognizable as the deceitful yet still lovable raccoon RJ. Willis' distinctive voice, more for adult audience members then children, can be associated with his past roles as moral ambiguous characters which makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Other personalities like Jim Carrey and Bill Murray were at one point or another during production considered for the role but it is hard to imagine while watching this movie anybody but Willis giving personality to RJ.The same however cannot be said of Gary Shandling who lends his voice to Verne the turtle (a reptile, not an amphibian - a truly wonderful running joke which is used sparing enough so as not to get too old too quickly). Verne is suppose to be the polar opposite of RJ yet at the same time remain sympathetic and enduring enough to keep our interest. The best example of this in a family-friendly computer-animated motion picture, a direct parallel of what we see in Over the Hedge, would be Marlin, voice by comedian Albert Brooks, opposite Ellen DeGeneres' Dory in Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo. The audience just does not feel the sense of desperation on Verne's part to protect his family from the humans and RJ's egocentric interior motives which put them directly in harms way. Instead the scene in which he attempts to return the wagon of food they have collected back to the humans has him coming off as a bit of a jerk who would rather have his family wallowing in uncertainty when they could be enjoying a much higher standard of living for less work.Without a doubt Steve Carrell steals the show with Hammy, the over-energetic squirrel. A variety of gags are used to great effect with his character including his choice of the word `Steve' (the actor's first name) to name the hedge the animals are examining that has suddenly appeared in the forest while they were hibernating during the winter season (""Steve's a pretty name"") and his ability to burp his `ABCs' which ought to make all mothers ecstatic. The end of the movie however is possibly his best highlight.William Shatner is dead-on as the voice role of the melodramatic and burlesque possum named Ozzie who is constantly playing ... well, possum every time he hears a strange noise which he believes is a predator (""We die, so we live""). For as much as others have criticized him for this exact same thing, it is good to see him in such spirits to being willing to poke fun at himself every once in awhile and take it in stride.Nick Nolte is practically unrecognizable as Vincent the bear who threatens to kill RJ unless he returns all the food he stole from his cave and destroyed (quite by accident) before the full moon in one week. The role suits him. And while he isn't onscreen much, his dark chilling voice makes him an omnipotent presence throughout.Secondary characters however are not used to their full potential. This list includes Avril Lavigne (there's a reason why sings should not become actors or vice-versa) as Heather, Ozzie's daughter, and Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as Lou and Penny, a porcupine couple who contribute little if anything significant to the story and can therefore be viewed simply as mere add-ons.Overall, PDI and Dreamworks, having recently been bought out by Paramount Pictures, this being their first release under new management, still has yet to produce an animated feature-length film, computer-animated or otherwise, up to the high standards of Shrek 2 (or perhaps going so far as to say even its predecessor) but quality animation (nothing extraordinary mind you but top-notch nonetheless) and an entertaining story make Over the Hedge truly worthwhile. Voice-talents like Bruce Willis, Steve Carrell, and even William Shatner are among the most notable highlights bringing memorable characters to life onscreen. Sure, RJ, Verne, and Hammy are cute and cuddly (prime candidates for the marketing department), but what's more is that the animals we see in Over the Hedge are all ones we come in contact with during our daily lives and therefore identify with. Who hasn't seen a raccoon or possum rifling through their garbage one night and wondered how they have adapted to modern suburbia? Who's really being taken advantage of in this situation, the animals or us? The movie's core concept is a clever one, something surprisingly no one has thought to make into a motion picture until now. The songs performed by Ben Folds (Five) compliment rather then distract from the story, a startlingly increasing occurrence in animated films. Over the Hedge while not nearly as consistent in the humor department as it should have been (the more dramatic moments slow down the movie's pace) is an enjoyable family comedy slightly above the average.",4,The Moose Hole - Get Over It,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,7768,"['Who', 'grown', 'more', 'fickle', 'years', 'motion-picture', 'studios', 'demanding', 'lower', 'costs', 'ever', 'higher',

171677,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,1415725659,Mike Zimmerman,"[3, 4]","When raccoon RJ (Bruce Willis) attempts to steal a cache of nourishment from mean bear Vincent (Nick Nolte), he is forced into a predicament: get replacement food before the next full moon or RJ is good replacement. He runs into a motley crew of animals: Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling), Hammy the squirrel (Steve Carrell), Stella the skunk (Wanda Sykes), porcupine couple Lou (Eugene Levy) and Penny (Catherine O'Hara), and father/daughter duo Ozzie (William Shatner) and Heather (Avril Lavigne). RJ convinces them to steal food for themselves, them being unaware of what the raccoon is up to. Meanwhile, the animals' every attempt enrages the neighbors (Allison Janney and Debra Wilson), who eventually call upon exterminator Dwayne (Thomas Haden Church) to help weed out the problem.2006 saw the return of Dreamworks SKG, once again churning out animated comedies for the tykes. First off was ""Ice Age 2,"" which was - and still is - gangbusters at the cineplex (as I speak, it has raked in $594M in box office numbers). Understandably, unlike the releases from the Weinsteins (""Doogal"" and ""Hoodwinked""), ""IA2"" didn't rely heavily on pop culture references overtaking character/plot development and authentic humor. As a matter of fact, the same follows with ""Over the Hedge,"" directed by ""Ants"" helmer Tim Johnson. While it may not produce big belly laughs, nor does it have the raunchier wit of his earlier work, don't think for a minute you'll be bored.Sure, it's safe to say that ""OTH"" is another ""Shrek"" clone looking to cop off some success: big named stars (fact: Jim Carrey was supposed to voice RJ, but lost to Bruce Willis), montages set to hip music from a popular band (""Shrek"": Smash Mouth; ""Over the Hedge"": Ben Folds Five), and a twist of irreverence for the adults to enjoy. Mind you, this isn't a bad thing, because a majority of the movie is funny. Johnson sidesteps some clich&#65533;s (while Avril Lavigne is a punk-rock gal, her character is nothing but), throws in some pratfalls (many of them owned by Steve Carrell's Hammy, including one scene where he literally slows down time after drinking some caffeine soda), and moves at a breezy 90 minutes without being boring.The only problem I had? Well, for some reason, TJ is looking to cop some Disney success and pull heartstrings. Much like in ""Finding Nemo,"" the main character lost his family, members and wonders what it's like to have a family (often highlighted by corny alternative rock). I have no problem if Johnson wants to do this, but with a lot of crazy stuff going on - from Hammy belching his ABC's to Ozzie playing dead (Bill Shatner even pokes fun at his Captain Kirk image, as well as snag a line from ""Citizen Kane"") - the time for family bonding moments don't genuinely work. Oh, and ""Ice Age 2"" sort of set a pattern of not having heartwarming moments, yet garner a lot of money around the world.Johnson gets extra mileage out of his cast. As I mentioned, Steve Carrell steals the show when playing Hammy (and I already mentioned some of his good scenes). Comedienne Wanda Sykes joins in on the fun with hilarious monologues, which makes up for her underused performance in ""Monster-In-Law."" Thomas Haden Church makes for a hilarious, and often threatening, villain. Too bad Johnson didn't get garner better performances for some of the other characters (Bruce Willis' sense of humor is weighed down by the pathos; Christopher Guest affiliates Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara might as well play concerned parents in future movies; and the same, surprisingly, goes for ""MadTV"" comedienne Debra Wilson).Still with a couple quibbles about unnecessary Disney-quality family-friendly moments and cast snafus, ""Over the Hedge"" is definitely not a lame movie. Of course, it might lose against ""The Da Vinci Code"" in the box office (unless moviegoers are wise to the critics' harsh reviews), but look at it this way: ""OTH"" is everything Ron Howard's movie isn't.",4,"""I am a crazy, rabid squirrel!

When he tries to steal a hidden stash of food from his friend, a bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte), RJ has a week to replace everything that's missing or it's curtains for him!Just when he's thinking all may be lost, RJ happens across a small group of animals: Hammy the Squirrel (Steve Carell), Ozzie (William Shatner) and his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne) who are possums, Stella the Skunk (Wanda Sykes), a family of porcupines that include Lou (Eugene Levy) and Penny (Catherine O'Hara) and the group's leader, a turtle named Verne (Garry Shandling).  The group of animals has just awakened from hibernation and is surprised to find an overgrown hedge (which they nickname ""Steve"") that separates the area they live in from suburbia.RJ sees an opportunity to get free help in gathering the food for Vincent by tricking the other animals into stealing food from the humans nearby.  The animals, who have never had nacho chips or cookies before, are amazed.  RJ's plans go awry when Gladys (Allison Janney), the president of the local home owner's association, calls in Dwayne a.k.a. ""The Verminator"" (Thomas Haden Church) to take care of the ""pests"".  He also has his hands full with an increasingly suspicious Verne, who suspects things just aren't right.  Will the animals and suburbia live happily ever after or will they be terminated by the Verminator?""Over the Hedge"" was another movie I was a little wary to see.  But I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  While the movie is geared towards children, it does have a few elements that adults will appreciate.  I especially liked the homage to ""Citizen Kane"" in the ""rosebud"" scene with Ozzie.  There was also the ""Stella!"" scene with Gladys' cat which was reminiscent of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".I also thought the story was good.  The plot was unique and well paced.  As far as characters go, I think that Hammy almost stole the show but there are things to like about each character, even the Verminator.The only downside to the movie could be predictability.  It may be easy to figure out where the whole story is going.  But, part of the fun is seeing how things unfold in order to get to a happy ending.""Over the Hedge"" is a fun, animated film.

171687,AHF97M45JFCB,1415725659,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","In the middle of the past decade it seemed after exploiting living toys, personified insects, ogres and fish the computer generated feature film industry turned its collective attention on groups of talking animals.  Flicks like Ice Age, Madagascar, The Wild, and Open Season began flooding the marketplace.  Amidst the implicit stampede there was 2006's Over the Hedge; a star studded entry to the genre that didn't exactly revolutionize things but detracted nothing from them either.The story opens with an opportunistic raccoon named RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis) trying to find a meal when a coin operated vending machine refuses to spit out the nacho chips he purchased.  Desperate times and foolish measures result in his getting caught stealing, and inadvertently destroying the food stock of Vincent the bear (Nick Nolte). The grumpy bear makes things much simpler for the small scavenging thief:  RJ has until the next full moon to replace all of the food, or RJ himself will become a meal.In the meantime the residents of the forest (ranging from possums, porcupines, a squirrel, skunk, and turtle) discover that a huge barrier of green has been erected in the middle of the forest during their long hibernation.  It turns out this wall is a hedge that separates the small section of forest from the development complex that has apparently spread around the woods like a virus.Sensing opportunity to capitalize on the critters' apparent ignorance, RJ decides the suburb would be an ideal location to earn back the incredible food debt he racked up with Vincent.  RJ moves in and quickly teaches the foragers to scavenge with plans of using the added labor force for all their worth.One would think that with a cast like this, the writers could have scribbled complete gibberish on paper and it would have been hilarious.  In fact that's almost exactly what appears to have happened.Stars like Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Thomas Haden Church, Avril Lavigne, Eugene Levy, and Catherine O'Hara accompany the previously mentioned Bruce Willice and Nick Nolte.  There is nary a peep or grunt in this one that doesn't come from some Hollywood heavy hitter and yet the best gags here seem to be the ones that play out on the screen without dialog (an already hyper active squirrel drinking soda only to have time stand still to an SUV containing more latent explosive potential than a nuke to a pest control truck becoming a house destroying projectile and so on).The dialog, as written, falls pretty flat and this is only further magnified by the deliveries that, save for Steve Carell's portrayal of the hyper squirrel Hammy, are precisely animated versions of the stars themselves.  Never will the viewer forget that the skunk is played by Wanda Sykes or that Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play the possum couple.  Perhaps the ultimate overacting comes from Mr. Shatner himself, in the form of his...patented...pause...style...of...talking.However, even with such criticism about, there are a few laughs to be had here.  And the animation and textures still look amazingly clean and crisp even now, nearly five years after the fact.A slightly richer plot or at the very least, a bit of better scripting for the actors to work from could have made this one a genuine top contender in an already crowded genre but as it stands, it's fairly middle-of-the-road material.  Worth a look if you're set on covering the entire personified-animal genre but DreamWorks does have more consistently clever titles in their ever-increasing catalog.",3,Over the Hedge = Dip in the Road,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,3573,"['middle', 'past', 'decade', 'seemed', 'exploiting', 'living', 'toys', 'personified', 'insects', 'ogres', 'fish', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'film', 'industry', 'turned', 'collective', 'attention', 'groups', 'talking', 'animals', 'Flicks', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Madagascar', 'Wild', 'Open', 'Season', 'began', 'flooding', 'marketplace', 'implicit', 'stampede', 'was', '2006', 'Hedge', 'star', 'studded', 'entry', 'genre', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'revolutionize', 'things', 'detracted', 'nothing', 'either.The', 'story', 'opens', 'opportunistic', 'raccoon', 'named', 'RJ', 'voiced', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'trying', 'find', 'meal', 'when', 'coin', 'operated', 'vending', 'machine', 'refuses', 'spit', 'out', 'nacho', 'chips', 'purchased', 'Desperate', 'times', 'foolish', 'measures', 'result', 'getting', 'caught', 'stealing', 'inadvertently', 'destroying', 'food', 'stock', 'Vincent', 'bear', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'grumpy', 'bear', 'things', 'much', 'simpler', 'small', 'scavenging', 'thief', 'RJ', 'next', 'full', 'moon', 'replace', 'food', 'RJ', 'will', 'become', 'meal.In', 'meantime', 'residents', 'forest', 'ranging', 'possums', 'porcupines', 'squirrel', 'skunk', 'turtle', 'discover', 'huge', 'barrier', 'green', 'been', 'erected', 'middle', 'forest', 'long', 'hibernation', 'out', 'wall', 'hedge', 'small', 'section', 'forest', 'development', 'complex', 'apparently', 'spread', 'woods', 'virus.Sensing', 'opportunity', 'capitalize', 'critters', 'apparent', 'ignorance', 'RJ', 'suburb', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'location', 'earn', 'back', 'incredible', 'food', 'debt', 'racked', 'up', 'Vincent', 'RJ', 'quickly', 'foragers', 'scavenge', 'plans', 'using', 'added', 'labor', 'force', 'worth.One', 'would', 'think', 'cast', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'scribbled', 'complete', 'gibberish', 'paper', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'fact', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'have', 'happened.Stars', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'accompany', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Bruce', 'Willice', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'nary', 'peep', 'grunt', 'one', ""n't"", 'come', 'Hollywood', 'heavy', 'hitter', 'yet', 'best', 'gags', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'ones', 'play', 'out', 'screen', 'dialog', 'already', 'hyper', 'active', 'squirrel', 'drinking', 'soda', 'only', 'have', 'time', 'stand', 'still', 'SUV', 'containing', 'more', 'latent', 'explosive', 'potential', 'nuke', 'pest', 'control', 'truck', 'becoming', 'house', 'destroying', 'projectile', 'so', '.The', 'dialog', 'written', 'pretty', 'flat', 'only', 'further', 'magnified', 'deliveries', 'save', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'portrayal', 'hyper', 'squirrel', 'Hammy', 'are', 'precisely', 'animated', 'versions', 'stars', 'Never', 'will', 'viewer', 'forget', 'skunk', 'played', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'play', 'possum', 'couple', 'Perhaps', 'ultimate', 'overacting', 'Mr.', 'Shatner', 'form', 'patented', 'pause', 'style', 'talking.However', 'even', 'such', 'criticism', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'animation', 'textures', 'still', 'look', 'amazingly', 'clean', 'crisp', 'even', 'now', 'nearly', 'five', 'years', 'fact.A', 'slightly', 'plot', 'very', 'least', 'bit', 'better', 'scripting', 'actors', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'genuine', 'top', 'contender', 'already', 'crowded', 'genre', 'fairly', 'middle-of-the-road', 'material', 'look', ""'re"", 'set', 'covering', 'entire', 'personified-animal', 'genre', 'DreamWorks', 'have', 'more', 'consistently', 'clever', 'titles', 'ever-increasing', 'catalog']",N/A

171703,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1415725659,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 15]","Over the Hedge (Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, 2006)Ah, the drive-in. There's something wonderful about drive-in theaters that has nothing to do with the fact that your movie-theater popcorn is ice-cold by the time you get back to the car. And it probably doesn't have anything to do with adolescent rites of passage when you're at a kids' movie, either. But... open air, massive screen, those silly little hanging speakers, it's magic. Really. And I think that, in this case, that might well have helped me enjoy this movie far more than I otherwise might have.Over the Hedge is an outright attack on the way humanity lives out its life. It is bitter, angry, and cynical, and its writers firmly believe they know where our species is headed. They have no qualms about stuffing it into our faces, as loudly and plainly as possible. And that, to be blunt, makes for an absolutely unwatchable movie-- which this is, for certain portions of its length.That said, when it's not smacking you in the face with a twinkie, its writers have pulled off something close to the impossible-- they have created a blisteringly funny movie around the pieces that should have been left on the cutting-room floor (or, better yet, burned, never again to be seen by human eyes). I don't believe I have ever seen a movie that left me so disgusted one minute and yet laughing the next. I saw it over a week ago, and I'm still trying to figure out how they pulled this off. It could, of course, have been the drive-in magic; movies are just plain better when they're fifty feet tall. (It certainly wasn't the popcorn. Note to self: next time, buy a small and finish it before you go back out into the night.) And there's something to be said for the built-in cuteness factor of talking animals. The main human antagonist is well-drawn (surprising given how little screen time she gets; Hollywood's emotional shortcuts actually work here), and would be a wonderful villain if you didn't know-- because the filmmakers are throwing it in your face every chance they get-- that she is supposed to be synecdochic of the entire human race.This one's a tough call.

171705,A16QODENBJVUI1,1415725659,Robert Moore,"[1, 3]","The American film industry today had come to the point where it can knock off entertaining computer-animated films with astonishing regularity.  It is nothing short of amazing how consistent they are.  Only the rare film is truly awful; only the rare film truly stands out.  None reach the depths of the Disney films of the seventies (the period following the departure of the last of Walt's ""Wise Men"" and during which they slashed their animation budget and few leading animators worked for the studio), but also none reach the glories of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  They are too entertaining for us to say that the American animated film is moribund, but the truth is that we no longer really expect to be amazed.  So, it is no surprise to say that OVER THE HEDGE entertains but does not amaze.The premise of the film is an inverted one.  Typically films dealing with the interface of wilderness and civilization focus on the exploration of the wilderness by creatures of civilization (e.g., THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY).  Here creatures of the wilderness explore the asphalt jungle.  It is a nice pretext and it works well.  It is also a bit subversive.  A host of radical writers have tried to make many of the same points that the film does.  I'm surprised that the extreme right hasn't made as much ado about the salient political points of OVER THE HEDGE as some of its nuttier members have about the supposed ""homosexual agenda"" (as if there is some conclave of devious gays who meet annually like the Council for National Polity does and revises and expands their ""Agenda"").The animation for the film is really brilliant.  A lot of early work with computer animation was spent making things look as realistic as possible.  That is somewhat true here:  the yards and trees are portrayed as realistically as possible, but the animals are wonderful caricatures of actual animals.  They could make the squirrel Hammy look a lot more like a real squirrel, but where would be the fun of that?  And Vern the turtle looks considerably more like a bath toy than any real turtle, but, again, that is as it should be.  I like that they are balancing increasing realism with the non-animal aspects of the animation, with making the animals more and more imaginative.  I also really enjoyed the voice talent.  I know they originally wanted Bill Murray or Jim Carrey to do the voice for RJ, but Bruce Willis does a surprisingly good job.  Perhaps the most surprising voice performance is by Steve Carrell as Hammy.  I'm so used to Michael Scott's absolutely horrible voice impersonations on THE OFICE that it takes a second to realize that those are intentionally bad impersonations.  I also really enjoyed the sequence that featured a Rottweiler crazed to play with toys.  One of my closest dog friends is a Rottweiler I like to say is really a Dorkweiler.  Like the dog in this film, give him a toy and he is crazy happy, as long as the toy survives.All in all this film is a lot of fun.  To be honest, outside of Miyazaki (who I think may be the finest animator ever), I haven't been blown away by any animated film since the original SHREK.

In ""Over the Hedge,"" the animals are already living in the country, only this time civilization has come to them in the form of a brand new suburban housing tract that has sprung up in their vicinity while the denizens snoozed away through winter hibernation (that`s one fast-growing housing development, I must say).

Since Pixar raised that animation bar with 'Toy Story', movies with completely different story lines are being compared and dissected mercilessly. When taken for what they are, these movies are so much more enjoyable.'Over the Hedge' begins with a racoon named RJ (Willis) who unwisely attempts to pilfer the picnic stash of a hibernating bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte). When RJ wakes Vincent and loses his entire stash of food, Vincent gives RJ one week to replace every item lost, or he'll be on the menu instead. RJ runs into a 'family' of hibernating animals that are all mystified by a huge hedge that seems as endless as the Great Wall of China. RJ sees his opportunity to recruit some helpers to gather food for Vincent, but it will require them to go, yes, over the hedge. Here, the woodland creatures are introduced to nacho cheese chips, cookies, handheld video games and other suburban staples. But a horrific real estate agent named Gladys (Allison Janney) and the overly zealous exterminator she's hired (Thomas Hayden Church) stand in the way of their Mecca. The animals learn to work together, and RJ learns that being a loner isn't all it's cracked up to be.The highlight of the movie, for kids and adults alike, is of course Hammy the squirrel, voiced superbly by ""The Office"" star Steve Carell. Hammy is another in a long line of spastic small cartoon creatures that kids can relate to (think Scratt from 'Ice Age' and Twitchy from 'Hoodwinked'), and you can't help but laugh at Hammy's antics, understanding why RJ refuses to let him have a can of energy drink. The funniest part involves RJ guiding Hammy with a laser pointer. Have you ever tried that with your dog or cat? Hours of fun!

171722,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,1415725659,SylvesterFox007,"[5, 6]","Computer animated films are usually intelligent comedies that offer a different perspective on the world.  ""Over the Hedge"" is no exception.  But while Disney & Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and ""Monster Inc."" offered a peek into the worlds of toys and monsters, respectively, and Dreamwork's ""Madagascar"" offered a peek into the world of wild animals, ""Over the Hedge"" is different in that it uses woodland animals to provide an eye-opening look at the human world.The movie open with a CGI raccoon named R. J. (voiced by action star Bruce Willis) attempting to steal a bag of chips from a vending machine.  Upon failing, R. J. enters a bear cave and manages to get caught laying waste to the bear's enormous food pantry.  The bear (voiced menacingly by Nick Nolte) offers R. J. an ultimatum: replace the food within a week, or become the food.Meanwhile, a group of woodland creatures awakens from hibernation, voiced by some of the greatest stars to grace both the big and small screens, including ""Star Trek""'s William Shatner and ""The Office""'s Steve Carrell.  The woodland creatures are shocked to find that most of their woods have been replaced by suburbia while they were sleeping.  R. J. finds them and offers to guide them into human civilization, all the while taking advantage of them in order to recreate his bear friend's food stash.""Over the Hedge"" is based on a comic strip, so it's not surprising that the film holds a slightly satiric, thoughtful, and quirky brand of humor worthy of a Sunday funnies page.  The screenplay by Len Blum, who co-wrote this year's ""The Pink Panther"", touches on the topic of the modern human lifestyle of excess, a lifestyle that includes too little nature, too much TV, and way too much food.  The woodland creatures offer a wise commentary on SUV's, videogames, electronics, and junk food products.  Each time R. J. leads the nave creatures into the suburbs, the animals lose their innocence to the corruption of the modern American lifestyle.  A less subtle theme throughout the movie is family, as cool but conniving drifter R. J. begins to see a chance at redemption.Like the best computer animated comedies, ""Over the Hedge"" provides jokes for both children and adults without ever becoming crude or obnoxious.  Only a few of the jokes are direct parallels of pop culture, and most of those, like in ""Madagascar"", are tributes to classics like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" rather than the latest entertainment fads.

Since then, they have had difficulty creating an animated effort with the story or laughs to keep both adults and children happy. They have the animation right; they just need to recapture the wit, sarcasm and originality of ""Shrek"" and its sequel. ""Over The Hedge"" is good, but it falls a little short. When you have a studio like Pixar producing top-notch, consistently great animated efforts, just off the mark isn't enough sometimes.RJ (Bruce Willis), a street savvy raccoon, decides to steal food, Vince (Nick Nolte) from a hibernating bear. Just as he thinks he has everything, he spots a package of ""Spuddies"" under Vince's arm. Not content to leave with what he has, a huge wagon overflowing with junk food, he decides he needs the Pringle-like food. He is successful, but as soon as he opens the container to take a bite, Vince wakes up. Some quick talking on RJ's part saves his life, but he has to replace all of the food in a week, when Vince wakes up from his hibernation. It is a lot of food and he will need some help. The next morning, RJ stumbles upon a group of woodland creatures who are waking up from their hibernation. Verne (Garry Shandling), a cautious turtle, is the leader of the group and immediately starts organizing them to replenish their food for next winter's hibernation. RJ recognizes an opportunity and soon convinces them that they can find all the food they need, over the new hedge bordering their property, in a new suburban development. Hammy (Steve Carell), a hyperactive squirrel, Ozzie (William Shatner) and his daughter (Avril Lavigne), possums, Stella (Wanda Sykes), a skunk and a porcupine family (Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy provide the voices of the mom and dad) are dubious, but as soon as RJ introduces them to processed junk food, they are all for it, immediately hooked. Soon, their shenanigans attract the attention of Gladys (Allison Janney), the A-type human who is the head of the homeowner's association. Horrified, she contacts the Verminator, Dwayne (Thomas Haden Church).""Over The Hedge"", based on a popular newspaper comic strip, and directed by Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, is a cute, mildly funny animated effort.A short cartoon called ""First Flight"" precedes the feature, also directed by Johnson and Kirkpatrick. In it, a businessman waiting for the bus to work finds a newborn blue bird, becomes attached to it, and tries to teach it how to fly. This short has many of the same elements of ""Hedge"", providing a sort of mini version of the feature length film. But in the long film, we grow tired of them. These elements work well for an 8 minute short, but when you stretch the same elements into a 90 minute long film, they wear thin.""Hedge"" is beautiful to look at. The animation is top notch and skillfully blends certain more realistic elements with more surreal, interesting animation. All of the scenes with RJ, Verne and the woodland creatures in their wilderness home are almost beautiful. The animals are fairly realistic, appearing just a couple of degrees from the real thing, giving them a cute, cuddly appearance just ripe for marketing and stuffed animals. As soon as these creatures set foot in the sub development and humans enter the picture, everything takes on a more surrealistic look, including many artificial plants and animals. But this is part of the joke and handled well. The humans are living in a much more artificial world, so it should look surreal to animals that are used to real grass, trees and nature.As RJ attempts to entice the group to help with his plan, he provides a quick rundown of the excess we live with and are used to. This monologue is funny because it provides an innocent interpretation of what we are all used to. He is basically pointing out the truth, but has to explain it to animals that aren't used to it, and he doesn't get everything exactly right either. But this is his predominant joke and it doesn't quite sustain the character throughout the film.Part of the problem with ""Hedge"" is that each character is not funny on their own. The human characters are funny because they provide mirrors of some of the extreme parts of our lifestyle. But only a few of the animals have funny quirks to their persona. The standouts are Steve Carell and William Shatner. Carell provides the voice for Hammy, the hyperactive squirrel. As soon as RJ introduces them to processed junk food, Hammy becomes a different beast altogether. Already hyperactive, the sugar in the food becomes a magic elixir to him and instantly becomes addicted. Just as he is about to open a can of cola for the first time, RJ wisely takes it away from him. ""That's the last thing you need, pal."" Throughout, every time Hammy spots a cookie, we hear him say ""Cookie! Cookie! I like the cookie"" or some such statement. It is a funny performance and adds immeasurably to the film.The other standout among the animals is William Shatner's Ozzie. Whoever came up with the idea of casting Shatner as a possum that plays dead at the drop of a hat deserves a raise, a promotion or some sort of recognition. It is a brilliant piece of casting allowing Shatner to caricature his own persona. Every time he plays dead, Ozzie overacts, much like Shatner in real life. A very funny performance.The two prominent human characters are also very funny, providing a mirror to our own excessive behavior. As Gladys, Allison Janney perfectly captures the type-A personality, driven woman who is ambitious and feels her role as President of the Homeowner Society is the most important in the world. Thomas Haden Church channels the character Cliff from ""Cheers"" and his own character from ""Wings"" into Dwayne, an exterminator who is much too preoccupied with his job. And his comb over.But to achieve ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story"" status, all of the characters in ""Hedge"" need to be funny and they aren't. Willis' RJ is the wisecracker, the new leader of the group, all about getting things done and manipulating people. After he finishes his little monologue about humans and food, he is the force behind the operation and his main purpose is to convince the other animals to help him and then to feel guilty. He is a bit like the action hero persona of Bruce Willis; he has a mission to complete and obstacles to overcome. Garry Shandling's Verne is the leader of the group and very cautious. His job is to worry about anything and everything RJ leads them into. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy have done the Midwestern mom and dad thing before, too many times. The key difference here is they are animated porcupines. Avril Lavigne has one funny line as she gives her possum character some decidedly teenage characteristics. If each of these characters had been slightly `off' or in some way unusual, the film would've been truly memorable. As it is now, all of the woodland creatures combined would make one very funny character. Imagine if Donkey from the ""Shrek"" films had been split into seven different characters, each with a different part of the persona and you get the idea.""Over the Hedge"" is one of the better animated efforts to come along in some time, but it could've been so much better. It lacks the irreverence, sarcasm and continuous wit of a modern classic of animation.",4,It Just Misses The Mark,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,7333,"['DreamWorks', 'set', 'bar', 'very', 'high',

If you read this contrived story on paper, you think `Over the Hedge,' Dreamworks's latest animation, might be the last film that would succeed. The results are, in fact, a surprisingly clever and entertaining film that all family members can enjoy.After being caught red-handed while trying to steal food from Vincent the Bear, scheming raccoon R.J. (with the voice of Bruce Willis who perfectly fits) moves to a nearby forest, where he fools the animals there into getting over the hedge, and stealing food from the humans enjoying the suburbia life. Besides Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Nick Nolte, Thomas Haden Church, Allison Janney, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara and Avril Lavigne can be heard as the characters in the film.Of all the characters above, the most appealing part is the budding friendship between street-wise R.J. and timid and cautious turtle Verne, both realized by excellent voice performances from Willis and Shandling. I have never read the original comics upon which the film is based, but it is easy to see their opposing views consist of the world of `Over the Hedge.' In addition to that, the colorful images of the nature and the town are always delightful to see, and the occasional slapstick gags with a very manic pace are hilarious without being too gross or ridiculous.Unlike other Dreamworks animations, `Over the Hedge' keeps its pop-culture references to a minimum, making the entire film more family-oriented. It is a good decision which makes the film more character-driven, and the characters are the best asset of the film. Despite its patchy story, `Over the Hedge' keeps you entertained with well-drawn characters and funny jokes.",4,Clever and Entertaining Animation from Dreamworks,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1821,"['con', 'artist', 'raccoon', 'R.J.', 'nave', 'creatures', 'forest', 'collecting', 'food', 'humans', 'read', 'contrived', 'story', 'paper', 'think', 'Hedge', 'Dreamworks', 'latest', 'animation', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'would', 'succeed', 'results', 'are', 'fact', 'surprisingly', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'film', 'family', 'members', 'can', 'enjoy.After', 'being', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'trying', 'steal', 'food', 'Vincent', 'Bear', 'scheming', 'raccoon', 'R.J.', 'voice', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'perfectly', 'moves', 'nearby', 'forest', 'where', 'animals', 'there', 'getting', 'hedge', 'stealing', 'food', 'humans', 'enjoying', 'suburbia', 'life', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'characters', 'film.Of', 'characters', 'most', 'appealing', 'part', 'budding', 'friendship', 'street-wise', 'R.J.', 'timid', 'cautious', 'turtle', 'Verne', 'realized', 'excellent', 'voice', 'performances', 'Willis', 'Shandling', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'original', 'comics', 'film', 'based', 'easy', 'see', 'opposing', 'views', 'consist', 'world', 'Hedge', 'addition', 'colorful', 'images', 'nature', 'town', 'are', 'always', 'delightful', 'see', 'occasional', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'very', 'manic', 'pace', 'are', 'hilarious', 'being', 'too', 'gross', 'ridiculous.Unlike', 'other', 'Dreamworks', 'animations', 'Hedge', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'minimum', 'making', 'entire', 'film', 'more', 'family-oriented', 'good', 'decision', 'film', 'more', 'character-driven', 'characters', 'are', 'best', 'asset', 'film', 'patchy', 'story', 'Hedge', 'keeps', 'entertained', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'funny', 'jokes']",N/A

Remembering a hibernating bear named Vincent (Nick Nolte) who has a cave full of processed food, RJ makes his way up the hill into the bear's hideout.  He succeeds in stealing most of the food, but is overtaken by greed, wakens Vincent, and looses the food.  Vincent gives him an ultimatum:  RJ has one week bring back everything that was lost or he'll eat RJ instead.RJ is dumbfounded about how to scavenge enough product until he rambles into a motley family of different forest creatures just awaking from their winter hibernation.  During the winter, the forest shrank as suburbia moved in.  Their home has been surrounded by a giant hedge and acres where they once foraged have been replaced by people, pets, houses, and yards.  Under the guidance of their leader, a soft-spoken turtle named Verne (Garry Shandling) reluctantly allows RJ to show the group how to scavenge in suburbia.  Verne doesn't trust RJ, but along the way both creatures learn some lessons about themselves, about friendships, and about family.OVER THE HEDGE could have been like many other animated films that have been rehashed in the past couple years; it could have been just another big, dumb, CGI cartoon.  However, that is exactly what OVER THE HEDGE isn't.  It balances the line between modern sophistication and classic humor quite well.  The film pokes fun at the foibles of our society, but without using over- the-top product placement. In fact, there is not product placement in OVER THE HEDGE.Overall, OVER THE HEDGE is a very entertaining animated film with a great message about the importance of family that offers something for everyone to enjoy.",5,Welcome to the Suburbs.,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,1822,"['OVER', 'THE', 'HEDGE', 'young', 'raccoon', 'named', 'RJ', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'start', 'spring', 'starving', 'death', 'unable', 'successfully', 'get', 'bag', 'chips', 'vending', 'machine', 'Remembering', 'hibernating', 'bear', 'named', 'Vincent', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'cave', 'full', 'processed', 'food', 'RJ', 'way', 'hill', 'bear', 'hideout', 'stealing', 'most', 'food', 'overtaken', 'greed', 'Vincent', 'food', 'Vincent', 'ultimatum', 'RJ', 'one', 'week', 'bring', 'back', 'everything', 'was', 'lost', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'RJ', 'instead.RJ', 'dumbfounded', 'how', 'scavenge', 'enough', 'product', 'motley', 'family', 'different', 'forest', 'creatures', 'just', 'awaking', 'winter', 'hibernation', 'winter', 'forest', 'shrank', 'suburbia', 'moved', 'Their', 'home', 'been', 'surrounded', 'giant', 'hedge', 'acres', 'where', 'once', 'foraged', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'people', 'pets', 'houses', 'yards', 'guidance', 'leader', 'soft-spoken', 'turtle', 'named', 'Verne', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'reluctantly', 'RJ', 'show', 'group', 'how', 'scavenge', 'suburbia', 'Verne', ""n't"", 'trust', 'RJ', 'way', 'creatures', 'learn', 'lessons', 'about', 'friendships', 'family.OVER', 'HEDGE', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'rehashed', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'big', 'dumb', 'CGI', 'cartoon', 'However', 'exactly', 'what', 'HEDGE', ""n't"", 'line', 'modern', 'sophistication', 'classic', 'humor', 'quite', 'well', 'film', 'fun', 'foibles', 'society', 'using', 'over-', 'the-top', 'product', 'placement', 'fact', 'not', 'product', 'placement', 'THE', 'HEDGE.Overall', 'HEDGE', 'very', 'entertaining', 'animated', 'film', 'great', 'message', 'importance', 'family', 'something', 'everyone', 'enjoy']",N/A

The animals fish-out-water jump into the suburban landscape allows the script to poke fun at many all- -too-human failings, especially when it comes to the large amount of food we all seem to consistently consume.I found myself literally crying at some scenes as the plot combined a nice combination of cartoon mayhem with adult whit.

The critters, led by Verne the turtle, emerge from months of hibernation to find three things. First, they are ravenously hungry. Second, all but a scrap of their forest is now suburban sprawl. Third, fast-talking RJ, the racoon, knows how to turn this to their advantage.And, although they don't know it, to RJ's own advantage. At first, it's easy - the goodies are right out there on the curb, conveniently packed in trash cans. There are plenty of good visual gags as the wild beasties learn their way around the concrete trails of suburbia. Then, the opposition appears: Gladys, the evil chair of the neighborhood commitee, garbed in black worthy of Cruella DeVille. Appalled at the thought of animals in HER neighborhood with no pooper-scooper in sight, she calls the bumbling Verminator to eliminate them.Once the Verminator is done with the yard, the sensors and boobytraps (""outlawed in every state except Texas"") make the Korean DMZ look like a kiddie park. That's when the animals come back with their secret weapon: Manny, the manic squirrel, and a whole can of caffeine drink. Plenty of sensing and boobytrapping follows, but I'll let you figure out who it happens to. And yes, there's a suitably sappy ending.Although it's clearly a kids' movie, plenty of items keep the adults amused, too. I just have to believe that Gladys is drawn from someone's personal and unhappy experience, and the must-have chips match a craving that just about everyone has had at some point.

This movie had me laughing from start to finish.  From start to finish the movie grabs you and pulls you into the life of these animated creatures. And the cast of voices was outstanding.

171736,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,1415725659,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 2]","Over the Hedge is a solid 82 minutes of sight gags and celebrity-voiced cartoons cracking jokes. Although the plot is thinner than an Olsen twin, it's still incredibly enjoyable.Unlike a lot of celebrity-voiced cartoons, these voices were actually chosen for quality and not just a name. This makes a huge difference in the development of characters, the delivery of jokes, and the success of the movie.Although the humans are the bad guys here, a panicky Home Owner's Association President (Allison Janney) and a Animal Exterminator (Thomas Haden Church), the actual anti-development message is pretty light and the film doesn't dwell on the development of a new subdivision as a bad thing. Moreso, it pokes fun at humans ""centering their lives around food.""Over the Hedge is a good natured comedy that is enjoyable for adults, and which they will have no problem letting their kids of any age watch. It's fast-paced, features great animation, and hilarious one-liners.The only way this film is based on the comic strip of the same name at all, though, is the fact that there are characters with the same names and they live near the suburbs. Other than that, I'd say the comic strip creator cashed in luckily on a very loose adaptation.The DVD features a plethora of extras. The most I've seen on a DVD in a while. Although the two games are kind of weak, they're still fun. There's a short starring Steve Carrell's squirrel character Hammy, a short with fun facts about each animal, and several other little tidbits.",5,The kind of film you watch with a bucket of popcorn,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,1519,"['Hedge', 'solid', '82', 'minutes', 'sight', 'gags', 'celebrity-voiced', 'cartoons', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'plot', 'thinner', 'Olsen', 'twin', 'still', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable.Unlike', 'lot', 'celebrity-voiced', 'cartoons', 'voices', 'were', 'actually', 'chosen', 'quality', 'not', 'just', 'name', 'huge', 'difference', 'development', 'characters', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'success', 'movie.Although', 'humans', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'here', 'panicky', 'Home', 'Owner', 'Association', 'President', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Animal', 'Exterminator', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'actual', 'anti-development', 'message', 'pretty', 'light', 'film', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'development', 'new', 'subdivision', 'bad', 'thing', 'Moreso', 'fun', 'humans', 'centering', 'lives', 'food', 'Hedge', 'good', 'natured', 'comedy', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'letting', 'kids', 'age', 'watch', 'fast-paced', 'great', 'animation', 'hilarious', 'one-liners.The', 'only', 'way', 'film', 'based', 'comic', 'strip', 'same', 'name', 'fact', 'are', 'characters', 'same', 'names', 'live', 'suburbs', 'Other', ""'d"", 'say', 'comic', 'strip', 'creator', 'cashed', 'luckily', 'very', 'loose', 'adaptation.The', 'DVD', 'plethora', 'extras', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'while', 'two', 'games', 'are', 'kind', 'weak', ""'re"", 'still', 'fun', 'short', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'squirrel', 'character', 'Hammy', 'short', 'fun', 'facts', 'animal', 'several', 'other', 'little', 'tidbits']",N/A
