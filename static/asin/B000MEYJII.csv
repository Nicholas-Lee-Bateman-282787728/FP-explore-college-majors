There isn't a gun anywhere except when Donald Sutherland tries to commit suicide, but it's brief. Sutherland is outstanding in his role as grandpa. A film about life, and home and the meaning of it all. Of course, boy gets girl, but that's one of the few cliches here.

1045300,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000MEYJII,Grady Harp,"[21, 21]","AURORA BOREALIS is a superb film by James Burke ('In Dark Places' and 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple') from a story by  Brent Boyd ('The Green Room' and 'Crazy') and if this film is a sample of how these two fine talents collaborate, we can only hope for more.  The cast assembled for this movie gives evidence that the actors deeply admire their vision: it is well deserved.The setting is winter in Minneapolis, the hometown of the Shorter family: Grandfather Ronald (Donald Sutherland), Grandmother Ruth (Louise Fletcher), and the two grandsons Duncan (Joshua Jackson) and Jacob (Steven Pasquale).  The boys' father died at age 39 (10 years prior to the opening of the story) and both boys grew up on their own, feeling deserted by a father who had been a cocaine abuser at one time.  Duncan had been a champion hockey player, but when his father died his goals diminished and he has been in and out of odd jobs without a solid look at his future.  Jacob runs a nursing home business and when he is not working, he is bringing his girlfriends to Duncan's flat for trysts.  Duncan cares for his grandfather Ronald who has multiple illnesses (Parkinson's Disease, dementia) yet who maintains a humble life with Ruth.  As Ronald's condition deteriorates, Duncan takes a handyman's job in the complex where his grandparents live and during this time the two men bond more closely than ever: Ronald's fading mind sees northern lights from his apartment window and Duncan out of love and growing understanding lets him believe they are real. Ronald is aware of his mental instability and lets Duncan know that he would like to take his life with a shotgun, an idea Duncan prevents.Ronald and Ruth have a health care provider Kate (Juliette Lewis) whom they trust and love and encourage Duncan to seek out as a partner.  Kate and Duncan date and fill the wide gaps in each other's personalities, yet when the opportunity comes for Kate to move to sunny San Diego, she is unable to make Duncan budge from his safe routine existence in Minneapolis. But as Duncan's resistance is broken down (he learns from a mentor that his father did not die of cocaine abuse, Ronald dies a natural death, etc), he views Kate as the person who can alter his outlook and his life.Every member of this cast is extraordinary: Donald Sutherland creates a man eaten by Parkinson's Disease and dementia without ever becoming a caricature, Louise Fletcher reminds us how self-effacing her acting has always been, Juliette Lewis turns in one of her most sensitive roles, and Joshua Jackson finds every nuance of the troubled but needy Duncan and engages our empathy. Each of the smaller rolls is likewise pitch perfect, no doubt due in large part to the sensitive direction of Burke.  It is so refreshing to watch a film as meaningful in message and in skillful acting as this, a movie that restores our confidence in film as art.  Highly recommended.

Duncan, played by Joshua Jackson is a young man who has been fired from many jobs, drives a junker that has just quit, has a brother who is successful but he has issues as well.  While visiting his grandparents, played by the very talented Donald Sutherland and Louise Fletcher he discovers that there is a position for a handyman.  This allows Duncan to spend more time with his grandparents, his grandfather with limited mobility due to Parkinson's disease, and his grandmother the more capable spouse just needing some emotional support.  Duncan is also dealing with the unexplained death of his father, a former cocaine addict.  Enter Kate, a caregiver who sees Ronald and Ruth, the grandparents and meets Duncan.  As their relationship grows Kate is puzzled by Duncan's immature behavior as well as his reluctance to change his circumstances which to her seem very limited.  With the help of Kate, Duncan begins to realize that his life can be so much more and where he has grown up and lived all his life is just a place.

1045305,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000MEYJII,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","Main character in this movie is young man Duncan in his early twenties.  He has dropped out of college and has difficulty holding onto jobs.  His older brother Jacob is having a successful career in the bank; but is cheating on his wife by using his younger brother's appartment with his (co-worker) lover.  Soon we learn that both brothers are deeply hurt by the sudden death of their father almost 10 years ago.  Their mother has moved to Florida and visits them once a year during summer for a week.  Story unfolds in Minneapolis, during winter months which helps us focus on the story itself.  There is not much to do in Minneapolis during cold months.  Duncan is doting to his grandparents, particularly his grandfather.  Both miss, in their own way, Duncan's father David.  Grandfather is getting sick (Parkinson's, dementia, kidney and heart problems) and depressed but still wants to help his grandson in finding a direction in life.  So it happens that the path to finding a way is thru a home aide, young woman who (Juliette Lewis) checks on the grandfather's health and has a crush on young Dunkan.For anyone who has ever lost someone dearly loved, this is deeply emotional film.  It is sensitive but not overbearing.  Film is also full of hope.  It is comforting to know that no matter how difficult it is to deal with loss, and the fact that sometimes it may take a long time for any person to come to terms with a loss of another person, we all have to find our own way to reconcile our feelings, intentions and define our future from that point on.Wonderful cast includes Juliette Lewis, Joshua Jackson, Katie Griffin and K.
