Irene Bedard is wonderful as Mary Crow Dog.  If you haven't seen this movie, please check it out.  It will really raise your awareness about what Native Americans have been through and what many are still going through.  It is really saddening that this movie has not been released on DVD yet.  I hope that they decide to take that step someday soon.",5,An awakening movie that should be released on DVD!!!,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,529,"['movie', 'more', 'aspects', 'Native', 'American', 'struggles', 'suffering', 'past', 'present', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'wonderful', 'Mary', 'Crow', 'Dog', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'please', 'check', 'out', 'will', 'really', 'raise', 'awareness', 'what', 'Native', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'still', 'going', 'really', 'saddening', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'yet', 'hope', 'decide', 'take', 'step', 'someday', 'soon']",Lakota Woman - Siege at Wounded Knee VHS
