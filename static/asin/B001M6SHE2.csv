1216418,A1E4QQDW94YBHH,B001M6SHE2,Aileen P. Grospe,"[2, 3]","I really thought this was similar to Air but somehow it was only similar along the plot lines although a lot of you would disagree. I just found it a bit hard to imagine how an ""angel"" let alone and Absolute Angel could be a human's ""sword"". Anyways, I loved this anime and the drama. I'm glad there was close to no comedy in this one (except for that Absolute Angel who was a cat girl, I forgot her name) because that would defeat the purpose of the mood set. The lead characters are Kyoshiro and Kuu and there is a third wheel who happens to be Setsuna, Kyoshiro's Absolute Angel sword.Absolute Angels can serve a human as a weapon of defense or offense hence they are referred to as swords. They suddenly transform into these robots to defend their masters. There is little ""science"" and ""mechanics"" involved because I believe this is purely in the realm of magic so don't expect any fancy mechanical terms mentioned like other mecha animes.I rarely watch animes subbed. I love the voices of the English cast. They were appropriately chosen for the characters especially for Kuu and Kyoshiro. I also thought the voice of Kyoshiro's siblings were appropriately casted.This series though is not for younger kids. They gave it a rating of TV 14 but I think it should be for those 16 above because of scenes of nudity and same sex undertones (hmmm, probably not undertones but I will leave it up to viewer to decide). But for shouju anime lovers I think you'll enjoy the joy of new love blooming between the lead and the heartbreak between the male lead and the female third wheel. I said this was a happy tragedy because it is (you have to watch it to figure it out). The series also leaves you guessing about Kuu and what she really is and why Kyoshiro goes to all this length to keep her by his side. It also throws several surprises at the viewer including this reviewer.",4,Happy tragedy,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,1874,"['really', 'thought', 'was', 'similar', 'Air', 'somehow', 'was', 'only', 'similar', 'plot', 'lines', 'lot', 'would', 'disagree', 'just', 'found', 'bit', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'angel', 'let', 'alone', 'Absolute', 'Angel', 'could', 'be', 'human', 'sword', 'Anyways', 'loved', 'anime', 'drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'there', 'was', 'close', 'comedy', 'one', 'Absolute', 'Angel', 'who', 'was', 'cat', 'girl', 'forgot', 'name', 'would', 'defeat', 'purpose', 'mood', 'set', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'Kyoshiro', 'Kuu', 'third', 'wheel', 'who', 'be', 'Setsuna', 'Kyoshiro', 'Absolute', 'Angel', 'sword.Absolute', 'Angels', 'can', 'serve', 'human', 'weapon', 'defense', 'offense', 'hence', 'are', 'referred', 'swords', 'suddenly', 'transform', 'robots', 'defend', 'masters', 'little', 'science', 'mechanics', 'involved', 'believe', 'purely', 'realm', 'magic', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fancy', 'mechanical', 'terms', 'mentioned', 'other', 'mecha', 'animes.I', 'rarely', 'watch', 'animes', 'subbed', 'love', 'voices', 'English', 'cast', 'were', 'appropriately', 'chosen', 'characters', 'especially', 'Kuu', 'Kyoshiro', 'also', 'thought', 'voice', 'Kyoshiro', 'siblings', 'were', 'appropriately', 'casted.This', 'series', 'though', 'not', 'younger', 'kids', 'gave', 'rating', 'TV', '14', 'think', 'should', 'be', '16', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'same', 'sex', 'undertones', 'hmmm', 'probably', 'not', 'undertones', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'shouju', 'anime', 'lovers', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'joy', 'new', 'love', 'blooming', 'lead', 'heartbreak', 'male', 'lead', 'female', 'third', 'wheel', 'said', 'was', 'happy', 'tragedy', 'have', 'watch', 'figure', 'out', 'series', 'also', 'guessing', 'Kuu', 'what', 'really', 'why', 'Kyoshiro', 'length', 'keep', 'side', 'also', 'several', 'surprises', 'viewer', 'including', 'reviewer']",Shattered Angels: The Complete Series
1216419,A35XG6755DWOJV,B001M6SHE2,"albionphoto ""albion""","[0, 1]",There are 12 episodes in this series. At least seven of them are filled with either Kuu's whining self-pity or Kyoshiro's pompous teenage angst. The story only really gets going when Kyoshiro's long lost brother turns up and turns out to be a complete monster. The last third of the series moves along well enough and the ending could be a tear jerker if you cared about the main characters at all at that point. I found I didn't.This Is an SAVE version which features basic packaging and no extras. You get what you pay for and these versions are good value for money and generally well executed.
