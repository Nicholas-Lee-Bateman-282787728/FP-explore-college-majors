This review is NOT about the shipment, it IS about what you receive in the mail. Damages: The Complete Series is maybe the cheapest complete series I've ever owned. All of the DVDs are stacked on top of one another and they give you a cardboard insert to keep them in. I was very disappointed in them for putting this together and expecting fans to enjoy it. You'd be better off buying the seasons separately.",1,Cheap!,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,503,"['people', 'Amazon', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'read', 'reviews', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'review', 'NOT', 'shipment', 'what', 'receive', 'mail', 'Damages', 'Complete', 'Series', 'maybe', 'cheapest', 'complete', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'owned', 'DVDs', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'one', 'give', 'cardboard', 'insert', 'keep', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'putting', 'together', 'expecting', 'fans', 'enjoy', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'seasons', 'separately']",Damages: The Complete Series

This complete set comes in a container that has all the disks packed onto a post of sorts rather than the usual fold out 'leafs.  That's ok for me as I have my own 'filing' system putting DVDs in crystal cases to save space, but if you want to view the final series in this item, you have to lift out all the earlier disks of earlier series first.  I guess that's a reflection of the price point.  I had no issue with this but others might.",3,Ok but slow,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,538,"['Great', 'actors', 'series', 'little', 'slow', 'paced', 'liking', 'get', 'bored', 'disk', '2', 'complete', 'set', 'container', 'disks', 'packed', 'post', 'sorts', 'rather', 'usual', 'fold', 'out', 'ok', 'have', 'own', ""'filing"", 'system', 'putting', 'DVDs', 'crystal', 'cases', 'save', 'space', 'want', 'view', 'final', 'series', 'item', 'have', 'lift', 'out', 'earlier', 'disks', 'earlier', 'series', 'first', 'guess', 'reflection', 'price', 'point', 'had', 'issue', 'others', 'might']",Damages: The Complete Series

It's just that Damages is so good I dream about it and it had an emotional  component that looms far after the episodes are over. No other TV show has had that impact on me. From the great theme song to Patti and Ellen's tense conversations , its perfect as a show gets. It has set the bar very high!
