1621630,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00B4MMQJ6,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[13, 13]","Ben, a dancer who recently reconciled the fact that he is gay, moves to West Hollywood to join two friends from college:  Jason, a young man (and budding alcoholic) with limited talent who wants to be a star, and Corey, an androgynous young loner who works as a personal assistant for an eccentric former TV actress (played by Sally Kirkland).  Finding work as a pilates and yoga instructor, Ben tries meeting guys through online ads, sex parties, and tries to get closer to another dancer he met at one of his classes, but nothing seems to be going as planned.  Meanwhile, Jason sets his sights on a boyfriend who can help his career goals.A somewhat bitter, but mostly realistic, look at the gay dating hell that can be WeHo, but an otherwise positive story in which the guys adapt to their circumstances and achieve happiness.  Acting is capable and mostly amusing, despite some trite dialogue.  The film's direction seems a bit disjointed in parts, including a rather lengthy dance sequence at its conclusion.  Overall, I give it three stars out of five.  Brief nudity, sexual situations, would likely be a PG-13.  DVD has no extras other than chapter stops and some trailers.",3,"A bit disjointed, but generally amusing and positive.",1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,1180,"['Ben', 'dancer', 'who', 'recently', 'reconciled', 'fact', 'gay', 'moves', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'join', 'two', 'friends', 'college', 'Jason', 'young', 'man', 'budding', 'alcoholic', 'limited', 'talent', 'who', 'be', 'star', 'Corey', 'androgynous', 'young', 'loner', 'who', 'personal', 'assistant', 'eccentric', 'former', 'TV', 'actress', 'played', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'Finding', 'work', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Ben', 'meeting', 'guys', 'online', 'ads', 'sex', 'parties', 'tries', 'get', 'closer', 'dancer', 'met', 'one', 'classes', 'nothing', 'be', 'going', 'planned', 'Meanwhile', 'Jason', 'sights', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'career', 'goals.A', 'somewhat', 'bitter', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'look', 'gay', 'dating', 'hell', 'can', 'be', 'WeHo', 'otherwise', 'positive', 'story', 'guys', 'adapt', 'circumstances', 'achieve', 'happiness', 'Acting', 'capable', 'mostly', 'amusing', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'film', 'direction', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'parts', 'including', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'dance', 'sequence', 'conclusion', 'Overall', 'give', 'three', 'five', 'Brief', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'PG-13', 'DVD', 'extras', 'other', 'chapter', 'stops', 'trailers']",Wishmakers
1621631,A3JSO0N085OQXU,B00B4MMQJ6,B. Wasden,"[24, 26]","The Wishmakers is a comedy-drama about three gay men on their quest for love and success. It's not a great movie, but it is charming and has many attractive men in its cast. Drew Droege is only in three scenes, but he steals all of them and plays the funniest character with a voice that sounds like a muppet. There is brief nudity, but there should have been more. I guess the Eating Out series has spoiled me as it has set the bar so high for gay comedies. Lots of nudity, lots of laughs. The Wishmakers has neither of those things, but it is fairly entertaining just the same.",4,"Good, But I Wish It Would Have Been Great",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,579,"['Wishmakers', 'comedy-drama', 'three', 'gay', 'men', 'quest', 'love', 'success', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'charming', 'many', 'attractive', 'men', 'cast', 'Drew', 'Droege', 'only', 'three', 'scenes', 'funniest', 'character', 'voice', 'muppet', 'brief', 'nudity', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'guess', 'Eating', 'Out', 'series', 'spoiled', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'gay', 'comedies', 'Lots', 'nudity', 'lots', 'laughs', 'Wishmakers', 'things', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'just', 'same']",Wishmakers
