196331,A2E86XWGYF631O,6300138429,Andrew Hill,"[3, 3]","FURTHER UPDATE:I found another distributor for a DVD-R copy of BUSTER AND BILLIE - It is Sunshine Vintage Movies.  I am sorry to report that the copy I received from them was obviously made from a very poor copy of the VHS tape - or, rather, it appeared really to look like a DVD copy of a slow-speed VHS copy of the original VHS tape.  It is a bit ""lighter"" than the RareMoviedvd.com product - but the picture is still terrible.  So, I guess we all will just have to wait until SONY (Columbia) will perhaps make a decent DVD of this film that many, many people want.UPDATE ON REVIEW BELOW:I did order a 12.99 DVD copy from RareMoviedvd.com. and received/reviewed it.  It is certainly a rather poor copy of the VHS tape; however, the settings used for the copy provide such a dark picture the much of the film is impossible to watch.  Any scene at night is almost a blank black picture.  I responded to RareMoviedvd.com on this problem and they said not better print was available - but they did take the disc back and did reimburse me for the disc.  Yeah, the swimming scene is watchable (for those of you who are interested) - but it is such a pity that a studio version (even a DVD-R version) is not available.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is more or less just a comment, not a review of the film.  ""Buster and Billy"" is a very moving film; one that should be seen by many more people than will see it due to its not being available for viewing.  Because of this, the pricing of over $150.00 for a VHS copy will warm the wallet of the owner of the ""one copy,"" but I would imagine that he or she will wait a bit for someone who will shell out that kind of cash for an old VHS copy.  Yes, supply and demand.  But this is a shame.I do not know the quality of the  RareMoviedvd.com  DVD offering at their site for $12.99 plus shipping ($4.99 I believe) - but I would imagine it is a DVD copy from the VHS tape.  If done with any kind of professional equipment - the DVD should be an equal to the VHS tape - and is quite a bargain - not to say a wonderful find for those of us who have wanted a copy of Buster and Billy for years not ever being able to forget the film after seeing it.I know many people who are interested in this film - and have been searching for it for years.  Studios should get on the ball.  I am surprised that the DVD-R issues from WB and 20th Century Fox aren't alerting other studios to finally distribute some very popular films for us all.Well, not having $155.00 or more for this film - I did order a 12.99 DVD copy from RareMoviedvd.com.  I will be interested in just how good the print is - but at least I will have the film finally in some viewable format - and will keep looking for a long-awaited studio pressing.Good luck to all of us who love the film.",4,UPDATE ON REVIEW Great movie - obscene pricing,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,2777,"['FURTHER', 'UPDATE', 'found', 'distributor', 'DVD-R', 'copy', 'BUSTER', 'AND', 'BILLIE', 'Sunshine', 'Vintage', 'Movies', 'am', 'sorry', 'report', 'copy', 'received', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'very', 'poor', 'copy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'rather', 'appeared', 'really', 'look', 'DVD', 'copy', 'slow-speed', 'VHS', 'copy', 'original', 'VHS', 'tape', 'bit', 'lighter', 'RareMoviedvd.com', 'product', 'picture', 'still', 'terrible', 'So', 'guess', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'SONY', 'Columbia', 'will', 'perhaps', 'make', 'decent', 'DVD', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'want.UPDATE', 'ON', 'REVIEW', 'did', 'order', '12.99', 'DVD', 'copy', 'RareMoviedvd.com', 'received/reviewed', 'certainly', 'rather', 'poor', 'copy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'however', 'settings', 'used', 'copy', 'provide', 'dark', 'picture', 'much', 'film', 'impossible', 'watch', 'scene', 'night', 'almost', 'blank', 'black', 'picture', 'responded', 'RareMoviedvd.com', 'problem', 'said', 'not', 'better', 'print', 'was', 'available', 'did', 'take', 'disc', 'back', 'did', 'reimburse', 'disc', 'Yeah', 'swimming', 'scene', 'watchable', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'such', 'pity', 'studio', 'version', 'even', 'DVD-R', 'version', 'not', 'available.ORIGINAL', 'REVIEW', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'comment', 'not', 'review', 'film', 'Buster', 'Billy', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'due', 'not', 'being', 'available', 'viewing', 'pricing', '150.00', 'VHS', 'copy', 'will', 'warm', 'wallet', 'owner', 'one', 'copy', 'would', 'imagine', 'will', 'wait', 'bit', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'shell', 'out', 'kind', 'cash', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Yes', 'supply', 'demand', 'shame.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'quality', 'RareMoviedvd.com', 'DVD', 'offering', 'site', '12.99', 'shipping', '4.99', 'believe', 'would', 'imagine', 'DVD', 'copy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'done', 'kind', 'professional', 'equipment', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'equal', 'VHS', 'tape', 'quite', 'bargain', 'not', 'say', 'wonderful', 'find', 'who', 'have', 'wanted', 'copy', 'Buster', 'Billy', 'years', 'not', 'ever', 'being', 'able', 'forget', 'film', 'seeing', 'it.I', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'years', 'Studios', 'should', 'get', 'ball', 'am', 'surprised', 'DVD-R', 'issues', 'WB', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'are', ""n't"", 'alerting', 'other', 'studios', 'finally', 'distribute', 'very', 'popular', 'films', 'all.Well', 'not', 'having', '155.00', 'more', 'film', 'did', 'order', '12.99', 'DVD', 'copy', 'RareMoviedvd.com', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'print', 'least', 'will', 'have', 'film', 'finally', 'viewable', 'format', 'will', 'keep', 'looking', 'long-awaited', 'studio', 'pressing.Good', 'luck', 'who', 'love', 'film']",Buster and Billie VHS

What I like most about this movie is how it breaks against stereotypes. The easy girl in movies is usually made out to be flirtatious. While cute the girl Billie in this movie is extremely shy. Even after she gets the boy Buster in the movie her personality remains the same which I thought was neat, no huge 360 transformation just cause a guy likes her.The plot Buster's a popular jock and his girlfriend Pamela Sue Martin is frigid so he decides to get involved with the girl who has a reputation around town Billie. Again it's against stereotype the virgin is pretty much a rotten person. She is played to perfection by the underrated Martin, who was so excellent in Dynasty and Nancy Drew. Only after time Buster finds himself falling for Billie. But what the town has to say to such an union is deadly. I like the ending. I've been raised in a tight knit community and the phony atmosphere is usually anything but. I love the flower scene at the end. Jan Michael Vincent had a chance to be in other good movies like Tribes but Joan Goodfellow who played Billie didn't manage to have a successful film career. She made a good enough impression on me, lovely performance.

196335,A356TJCTCLDN89,6300138429,Kimberley Wilson,"[7, 7]",Buster and Billie was one of the best little movies of its decade. Jan Michael Vincent showed that he wasn't just a pretty face in this film as he plays a half wild country boy who grows up and separates  himself from his old buddies when he falls in love with Billie. Billie is scorned by the girls in town and used for sex by the boys. This girl doesn't just come from the wrong side of the tracks she and  her family are considered to be nothing more than the town's trash. And then something beautiful happens. Buster's love changes her and makes her believe that she actually deserves a little happiness.This is something of a Romeo and Juliet story only instead of two feuding families keeping the lovers apart it's the whole town and its hypocracy and snobbery. It's been years but I've never forgotten the final scene in the movie where Buster rebels and gets his girlfriend the flowers she deserves while the theme song plays.,4,Touching tragedy,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,935,"['Buster', 'Billie', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'little', 'movies', 'decade', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'showed', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'film', 'half', 'wild', 'country', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'separates', 'old', 'buddies', 'when', 'love', 'Billie', 'Billie', 'scorned', 'girls', 'town', 'used', 'sex', 'boys', 'girl', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'family', 'are', 'considered', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'town', 'trash', 'then', 'something', 'beautiful', 'happens', 'Buster', 'love', 'believe', 'actually', 'little', 'happiness.This', 'something', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story', 'only', 'instead', 'two', 'feuding', 'families', 'keeping', 'lovers', 'apart', 'whole', 'town', 'hypocracy', 'snobbery', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgotten', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Buster', 'rebels', 'girlfriend', 'flowers', 'theme', 'song', 'plays']",Buster and Billie VHS

196337,AIB3L0ESOWUV8,6300138429,Norbert Evans,"[44, 45]","(Story takes place in Georgia 1948) Very touching bittersweet love story. [...]Beg, barrow or steal it and watch it as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.I recommend seeing this movie in one sitting because it is a movie that slowly builds your feelings for the characters which will impact you more at the end of the movie.Buster Lane (Jan-Michael Vincent) is a typical country boy with maybe a little more scruples then the average southern country poke. Buster is engaged to be married to Margie (Pamela Sue Martin) in the upcoming June and he has been playing touchy feely with her but she wants to wait until they're married to have intercourse. Buster's main friend is Whitey (Robert Englund--""Freddy Krueger"") and they hangout and drink beers together and take a trip to the ocean and we get an idea where Buster's friends minds and morals are at and this suffices as the story comes to a close later in the movie. I little more about these friends in the next paragraph.In the meantime Billie (Joan Goodfellow) who is a very very shy country girl from a very poor family has been having sex with several of Buster's friends in a way of getting some attention. You are never made to feel anything but compassion for Billie, you never think of her as a [...]. Her performance radiates innocents and loneliness and sadness and then joy and happiness later in the movie, you can feel all her feelings as the movie progresses.When Buster can't holdout any longer for sex with Margie his attentions turn to Billie and are not honorable at first. He finds her to be very very innocent and sees the beauty in her and finds himself falling in love but is not sure of his feelings reflecting his own youth and lack of experience to this new feeling called love.Before Buster even realized what his feelings are he acts on his basic instinct and feelings and breaks off his relationship with Margie and is seeing Billie exclusively. You feel their new found love and see it as a rosebud just beginning to form. Billie is taken to her first movie with Buster to see a Tarzan movie, and you can see her elated joy at this new experience. When Billie and Buster go swimming Buster looks over at her to see if she is taking off all her clothes before he strips to the bare-ass as if to not offend her. It's little moments like this throughout the movie that all add up. The getting up in the middle of the night and waiting for the sun to show itself at the horizon and they jump up and down and then hold each other in a very very loving manner is touching as well. There are exchanges of gifts to one another and they both realize they love one another. Billie is taken to a dance with Buster and you again feel her joy. Billie is lit up like a Christmas tree by this time and you can actually feel her and his joy and happiness. but especially hers.Meanwhile back at the ranch, the boys that were getting laid by Billie before her self-esteem got elevated by her new love comes for some more poontang. Of course Billie resist and fights back but is beaten, raped and killed by these boys.Buster finds her body shortly after the killing and ends up killing two of the boys who had the evidence literally written on their faces. Buster is released from jail just after Billie's funeral and she was buried with only Buster's parents and the preacher being present, her parents weren't even there. The movie closes with the opening song and you get a big lump in your throat in the closing scene at the cemetery with Buster at Billie's graveside.I have seen reviews that see this movie as a sweet movie that turns into a sadistic mean spirited movie and was rated as a poor to fair movie because of it. I do not subscribe to this view. We live in a world where ugly things happen every day. We can be sure of two things, it was inevitable that these boys were going to come back for more poontang and that she would refuse them. I'm not sure how else this outcome might be played out. I suppose she could have been assaulted and then just told Buster about it and he could deal with it in a nonviolent manner. We all like happy endings and I love a good Cinderella story as much as anyone. American Beauty is a great movie and didn't end on a very happy note for the main character either, but these same reviewers don't knock that, go figure?Bottom line is this is one of my favorite movies. I seen it at a drive-in movie theater as the second feature back in 1974 when it was released and just bought a copy last month from an e-bay seller. It was sweeter then I remembered from 26 years ago. Joan Goodfellow doesn't seem to have done any visible acting since 1984. She gives one very sweet performance in this movie. I give Joans performance an 11 and the movie a 10. This movie will always have a soft spot in my heart.",5,A very touching bittersweet love story,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,4816,"['Story', 'place', 'Georgia', '1948', 'Very', 'touching', 'bittersweet', 'story', '[', ']', 'Beg', 'barrow', 'steal', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'you.I', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'one', 'sitting', 'movie', 'slowly', 'feelings', 'characters', 'will', 'impact', 'more', 'end', 'movie.Buster', 'Lane', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'typical', 'country', 'boy', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'scruples', 'then', 'average', 'southern', 'country', 'poke', 'Buster', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'Margie', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'upcoming', 'June', 'been', 'playing', 'touchy', 'feely', 'wait', ""'re"", 'married', 'have', 'intercourse', 'Buster', 'main', 'friend', 'Whitey', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'hangout', 'drink', 'beers', 'together', 'take', 'trip', 'ocean', 'get', 'idea', 'where', 'Buster', 'friends', 'minds', 'morals', 'are', 'suffices', 'story', 'close', 'later', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'friends', 'next', 'paragraph.In', 'meantime', 'Billie', 'Joan', 'Goodfellow', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'shy', 'country', 'girl', 'very', 'poor', 'family', 'been', 'having', 'sex', 'several', 'Buster', 'friends', 'way', 'getting', 'attention', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'feel', 'anything', 'compassion', 'Billie', 'never', 'think', '[', ']', 'performance', 'innocents', 'loneliness', 'sadness', 'then', 'joy', 'happiness', 'later', 'movie', 'can', 'feel', 'feelings', 'movie', 'progresses.When', 'Buster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'holdout', 'longer', 'sex', 'Margie', 'attentions', 'turn', 'Billie', 'are', 'not', 'honorable', 'first', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'innocent', 'beauty', 'falling', 'love', 'not', 'sure', 'feelings', 'reflecting', 'own', 'youth', 'lack', 'experience', 'new', 'feeling', 'called', 'love.Before', 'Buster', 'even', 'realized', 'what', 'feelings', 'are', 'basic', 'instinct', 'feelings', 'breaks', 'off', 'relationship', 'Margie', 'seeing', 'Billie', 'exclusively', 'feel', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'see', 'rosebud', 'just', 'beginning', 'form', 'Billie', 'taken', 'first', 'movie', 'Buster', 'see', 'Tarzan', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'elated', 'joy', 'new', 'experience', 'When', 'Billie', 'Buster', 'go', 'swimming', 'Buster', 'over', 'see', 'taking', 'off', 'clothes', 'bare-ass', 'not', 'offend', 'little', 'moments', 'movie', 'add', 'up', 'getting', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'waiting', 'sun', 'show', 'horizon', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'then', 'hold', 'other', 'very', 'very', 'loving', 'manner', 'touching', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'exchanges', 'gifts', 'one', 'realize', 'love', 'one', 'Billie', 'taken', 'dance', 'Buster', 'again', 'feel', 'joy', 'Billie', 'lit', 'up', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'time', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'joy', 'happiness', 'especially', 'hers.Meanwhile', 'back', 'ranch', 'boys', 'were', 'getting', 'laid', 'Billie', 'self-esteem', 'got', 'elevated', 'new', 'love', 'more', 'poontang', 'course', 'Billie', 'resist', 'fights', 'back', 'beaten', 'raped', 'killed', 'boys.Buster', 'body', 'shortly', 'killing', 'up', 'killing', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'had', 'evidence', 'literally', 'written', 'Buster', 'released', 'jail', 'just', 'Billie', 'funeral', 'was', 'buried', 'only', 'Buster', 'parents', 'preacher', 'being', 'present', 'parents', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'there', 'movie', 'opening', 'song', 'get', 'big', 'lump', 'throat', 'closing', 'scene', 'cemetery', 'Buster', 'Billie', 'graveside.I', 'have', 'seen', 'reviews', 'see', 'movie', 'sweet', 'movie', 'sadistic', 'mean', 'spirited', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'poor', 'fair', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'subscribe', 'view', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'ugly', 'things', 'happen', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'inevitable', 'boys', 'were', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'more', 'poontang', 'would', 'refuse', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'else', 'outcome', 'might', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'assaulted', 'then', 'just', 'told', 'Buster', 'could', 'deal', 'nonviolent', 'manner', 'happy', 'endings', 'love', 'good', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'American', 'Beauty', 'great', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'very', 'happy', 'note', 'main', 'character', 'same', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'knock', 'go', 'figure', 'Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'seen', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'theater', 'second', 'feature', 'back', '1974', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'bought', 'copy', 'last', 'month', 'e-bay', 'seller', 'was', 'sweeter', 'then', 'remembered', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'Joan', 'Goodfellow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'visible', 'acting', '1984', 'one', 'very', 'sweet', 'performance', 'movie', 'give', 'Joans', 'performance', '11', 'movie', '10', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart']",Buster and Billie VHS

I finally found a copy which wasn't easy or cheap at the time because it was out of print. The movie still holds up. It is a great story that takes place in the 40's or early 50's. Buster (Jan Michael-Vincent) is the most popular boy in school and a jock. He has a gang of buddies that he drinks with and carouses with. He also dates the school beauty who and does all the right things. His girl friend though is kind of frigid and won't let him have sex with her until they are married. Billy is a girl who lives out in the boondocks with her semi crazy or mentally challenged parents. She has nothing and is dirt poor. She is incredibly backward and shy and the boys of Busters gang use her for sex which she goes along with because it is the only way she is accepted. They ask Buster to go along with them to Billys but he never does because he finds the whole group thing distasteful and he has a girl friend and it would be wrong. But being sexually frustrated and young he goes to Billys by himself one night without telling anybody and takes her for a ride in his truck. They have sex and he begins to see her more and more often and actually falls in love with her. The reprecussions from the community and the scorn thrown his way bring Buster and Billy even closer.This is a story of young love and loss. It is a very emotional tail and a very good one. If you can find a copy on VHS its worth it if you can afford it. This is a largely forgotten movie and should be out on DVD. This movie also has some sexual content which is very tastefully done and also some very violent content that is kind of disturbing.,4,Love and Loss,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1710,"['very', 'good', 'movie', 'saw', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'TV', 'back', 'mid', 'late', '70', 'finally', 'found', 'copy', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'cheap', 'time', 'was', 'print', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'great', 'story', 'place', '40', 'early', '50', 'Buster', 'Jan', 'Michael-Vincent', 'most', 'popular', 'boy', 'school', 'jock', 'gang', 'buddies', 'carouses', 'also', 'school', 'beauty', 'who', 'right', 'things', 'girl', 'friend', 'though', 'kind', 'frigid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'sex', 'are', 'married', 'Billy', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'boondocks', 'semi', 'crazy', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'parents', 'nothing', 'dirt', 'poor', 'incredibly', 'backward', 'shy', 'boys', 'Busters', 'gang', 'use', 'sex', 'along', 'only', 'way', 'accepted', 'ask', 'Buster', 'go', 'along', 'Billys', 'never', 'whole', 'group', 'thing', 'distasteful', 'girl', 'friend', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'being', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'young', 'Billys', 'one', 'night', 'telling', 'anybody', 'ride', 'truck', 'have', 'sex', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'often', 'actually', 'love', 'reprecussions', 'community', 'scorn', 'way', 'bring', 'Buster', 'Billy', 'even', 'story', 'young', 'love', 'loss', 'very', 'emotional', 'tail', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'VHS', 'worth', 'can', 'afford', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'out', 'DVD', 'movie', 'also', 'sexual', 'content', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'also', 'very', 'violent', 'content', 'kind', 'disturbing']",Buster and Billie VHS
196342,A2FQ1USWVZMPD8,6300138429,"William Dakota ""Bill Dakota""","[0, 0]","The problem is I ordered it and a DVD of it was sent to me from overseas. It was widescreen but fuzzy and obviously shot off a movie screen. I had forgotten part of the film and had reviewed it when it was in theaters. I have tried, repeatedly, to get the Studio to put it on DVD...but they know nothing about older movies. And I guess nobody remembers Jan-Michael Vincent nowadays. In his youth, before his pot busts....growing it and being arrested, he had a fantastic career with his looks and talent. I was the sole reporter at the court when he was tried for growing pot at his home. His agent, Dick Clayton, who was James Dean's Hollywood agent, discovered Jan and was disappointed that he was hooked on pot and his TV series suffered from it too. But, this film should be on DVD for anyone who remembers him. It should be widescreen and 5.1 sound for all of us collectors to buy. The VHS copies could be transferred but these people who have it, think they have a goldmine with their prices.I sent my copy to the Studio to trace down whomever put it out overseas. Warner Bros. claimed they never received it. Whomever opened the box now has it in their collection. Most of the pirated movies are stolen from the Studios and the place that has the films in 35mm, that sends them to theaters, like Technicolor. I knew people who used to pick them up in film cans in the alleys behind Technicolor in North Hollywood. They were sold by employees.
