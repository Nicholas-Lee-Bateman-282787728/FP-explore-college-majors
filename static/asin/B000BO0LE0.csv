Kenny Rogers has been a really good singer since his days w/ The First Edition through his switch to country style music & The Gambler theme song is 1 of his best [Ruby is another good song]. Not only is he a good singer, Rogers is a pretty good actor in his role as Brady Hawks too. The supporting actors in The Gambler are also good, & the story keeps your interest throughout.

Guild,"[0, 0]","This is a superb collection,and you'll be impressed with this product before even unwrapping it.How's that?,you might ask.Well,look at the top edge of the tin box and you'll find a red button with instructions,""Press to play"".Presto! Kenny Rogers will sing ""The Gambler"" for you.This beautifully packaged collection comes in a tin box,with front and back covers.It is the 30th Anniversity Collector's Edition.The collection includes the original movie ""The Gambler"" plus 2 full length movies totalling another 180 minutes,""The Adventure Continues"".It's hard to believe that these 3 movies came out 30 years ago and they are still as good or better than what we have seen in recent years.It may come as a surprise to you,that even thouhg ""The GAMBLER"" is probably the song most people associate with Kenny Rogers;he didn't actually write it.It was written by songwriter Don Schlitz in 1978.It is however,the song that really skyrocked Kenny Rogers' career.Although the song is heard in the movies,Kenny Rogers doesn't actually sing it in the movies.The storyline is very good and continues through the 3 movies,however; some of the actors and characters change.All three movies have well depicted and exciting scenes.As much as Kenny Rogers plays the main role in all three movies;I particularly enjoyed Linda Evans and her role as Kate Muldoon.She played one of the most interesting characters and did an excellent job.One of my favorite Western TV Series was ""The Rifleman"" starring Chuck Connors.It ran for 168 episodes between 1958 and 1963.They were half-hour shows and one of the best during that period when popular westerns like Gunsmoke,Bonanza,Big Valley;etc.were really great entertainment,making the stuff like reality shows,we are getting today pale by comparison.Linda Evans played the role of Barbara Stanwicks daughter in Big Valley.But her portrayal of Kate Muldoon in ""The Gambler"" is something else!!Nobody in a Western ever came close to Chuck Connors as ""the Rifleman"" when he ""let go"" with those 11 shots in rapid fire from his specially adapted Winchester.He had to recock for each shot;but he made it look like an automatic repeating rifle.Well,wait till you see Kate Muldoon (Linda Evans) show her skills.Without a doubt the best action scene in all three movies.When you finish the three movies,sit back and enjoy the rest of the collection.The CD included has 14 songs.These are some of Kenny's most popular songs .He sings 10 by himself and does 4 of them with Dottie West.You can't go wrong with this collection whether you are a longtime fan of Kenny Rogers; or a gift for someone who is a fan of Westerns and/or Kenny Rogers.",5,"""Every hand's a winner,and every hand's a loser;and the best you can hope for,is to die in your sleep.""",1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,2655,"['superb', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'product', 'even', 'unwrapping', 'it.How', 'might', 'ask.Well', 'look', 'top', 'edge', 'tin', 'box', ""'ll"", 'find', 'red', 'button', 'instructions', 'Press', 'play', '.Presto', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'will', 'sing', 'Gambler', 'you.This', 'beautifully', 'packaged', 'collection', 'tin', 'box', 'front', 'back', 'covers.It', '30th', 'Anniversity', 'Collector', 'Edition.The', 'collection', 'original', 'movie', 'Gambler', '2', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'totalling', '180', 'minutes', 'Adventure', 'Continues', '.It', 'hard', 'believe', '3', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'better', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years.It', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'even', 'thouhg', 'GAMBLER', 'probably', 'song', 'most', 'people', 'associate', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'write', 'it.It', 'was', 'written', 'songwriter', 'Don', 'Schlitz', '1978.It', 'however', 'song', 'really', 'skyrocked', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'career.Although', 'song', 'heard', 'movies', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', ""n't"", 'actually', 'sing', 'movies.The', 'storyline', 'very', 'good', '3', 'movies', 'however', 'actors', 'characters', 'change.All', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'well', 'depicted', 'exciting', 'scenes.As', 'much', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'main', 'role', 'three', 'movies', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'role', 'Kate', 'Muldoon.She', 'played', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'did', 'excellent', 'job.One', 'favorite', 'Western', 'TV', 'Series', 'was', 'Rifleman', 'starring', 'Chuck', 'Connors.It', 'ran', '168', 'episodes', '1958', '1963.They', 'were', 'half-hour', 'shows', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'when', 'popular', 'westerns', 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', 'Big', 'Valley', 'etc.were', 'really', 'great', 'entertainment', 'making', 'stuff', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'getting', 'today', 'pale', 'comparison.Linda', 'Evans', 'played', 'role', 'Barbara', 'Stanwicks', 'daughter', 'Big', 'Valley.But', 'portrayal', 'Kate', 'Muldoon', 'Gambler', 'something', 'else', 'Nobody', 'Western', 'ever', 'came', 'close', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Rifleman', 'when', 'let', 'go', '11', 'shots', 'rapid', 'fire', 'specially', 'adapted', 'Winchester.He', 'had', 'recock', 'shot', 'made', 'look', 'automatic', 'repeating', 'rifle.Well', 'wait', 'till', 'see', 'Kate', 'Muldoon', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'show', 'skills.Without', 'doubt', 'best', 'action', 'scene', 'three', 'movies.When', 'finish', 'three', 'movies', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'collection.The', 'CD', 'included', '14', 'songs.These', 'are', 'Kenny', 'most', 'popular', 'songs', '.He', 'sings', '10', '4', 'Dottie', 'West.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'collection', 'are', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'gift', 'someone', 'who', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'and/or', 'Kenny', 'Rogers']",The Gambler

You wanna know why? Come here, I'll tell you. First, I'm an incredibly gifted poker player and second, this movie is all you need to know about poker. To this day, when a loser comes up to me and asks how to play poker you know what I tell them? I say, ""You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away and know when to reach across the table and drop a people's elbow"" I learned that from the Mr. Myagi of poker, Kenneth Dale Rogers. This movie is about a crazy poker player that makes people mad with his cooky ways and then sings his way out of trouble.I do this too. I win every poker game I play because I can bluff like you can only dream of. They call me Rich Kings Bluffnest Nook when I play poker. That's my name combined with bluffing. I can be holding a 2, a king, a 7, a joker and a 1985 topps Bob Owchinko baseball card and I can get a guy with a straight flush to fold. I'm just gifted I guess.
