And I've been doing this too long to be wrong."" -- Garcia's John BerlinThere is a quiet and haunting quality to this crime mystery which begins during the opening credits and is sustained to the very end. Andy Garcia rarely gets the spotlight he deserves but his low-key yet unmistakable charisma blends perfectly with the subdued thriller elements of this engrossing whodunit. As the lonely cop who leaves L.A. for the smaller Eureka after a messy divorce almost destroys him, he really excels, and seems to completely understand that this is a mood piece more than anything. And Uma Thurman, too often the centerpiece of Tarantino's high octane and quirky films, is marvelous as a shy blind girl as vulnerable to a serial killer as she is to Garcia's attentions toward her.John Berlin (Garcia) hasn't even clocked in when a body in the Eureka dump leads to a starling and more gruesome discovery; body parts he believes belong to one of the ""Jennifers"" in a serial killer's spree which has baffled law enforcement. Even his old pal, portrayed by Lance Henrikson from Chris Carter's Millenium doesn't see the connection, and the new kid on the block must battle resentment of his presence and skepticism about his investigation as he tracks a killer. Uma Thurman is wonderful as the blind Helena; the only person to have seen the serial murderer. Most of the best scenes are between she and Garcia, the score by Christopher Young and intermittent songs by artists like Lenny Welch augmenting his growing love for Helena, and fear for her life.Kathy Baker is excellent as Berlin's big sister of sorts and old pal Erikson's wife. Garcia's cop is more like a C.S.I. that an action hero, lending a certain depth to his character. Director Bruce Robinson also wrote the screenplay for Scott Rudin's production, and while the story becomes implausible towards the conclusion, as a director, he never lets the atmosphere waver.  Garcia and Thurman make a nice couple here, and the believability of their romance overcomes a few plot problems to make this a quietly terrific film. The R rating of the film stems from a couple of brief shots of Thurman topless in a bathtub to highlight her vulnerability when a killer is nearby. Today it would only be a PG-13.The elements of snow and rain and nighttime are used to help create an atmosphere many will love. Critics had strong reactions to this film on both ends of the star rating. The chemistry between Garcia and Thurman, and a mood captured and maintained, made this one a big success as far as I was concerned. I've always had sort of an affection for it, in fact, having seen it on the big screen years ago upon its initial release. Fans of the original C.S.I. from television will recognize elements and a mood sometimes found within that show. But Jennifer Eight was filmed years before. The final shot brings the viewer back nicely to the reason they've hung around till the end. If you like to pick apart plots, you probably won't enjoy it as much as those who lean towards atmosphere. A good one for Garcia's fans to enjoy, and a refreshing chance to see Thurman at her best.",5,"""I remember red..."" -- Uma Thurman",1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,3165,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'bad', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'wrong', 'Garcia', 'John', 'BerlinThere', 'quiet', 'haunting', 'quality', 'crime', 'mystery', 'opening', 'credits', 'sustained', 'very', 'end', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'rarely', 'spotlight', 'low-key', 'yet', 'unmistakable', 'charisma', 'perfectly', 'subdued', 'thriller', 'elements', 'engrossing', 'whodunit', 'lonely', 'cop', 'who', 'L.A.', 'smaller', 'Eureka', 'messy', 'divorce', 'almost', 'really', 'excels', 'completely', 'understand', 'mood', 'piece', 'more', 'anything', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'too', 'often', 'centerpiece', 'Tarantino', 'high', 'octane', 'quirky', 'films', 'marvelous', 'shy', 'blind', 'girl', 'vulnerable', 'serial', 'killer', 'Garcia', 'attentions', 'her.John', 'Berlin', 'Garcia', ""n't"", 'even', 'clocked', 'when', 'body', 'Eureka', 'dump', 'starling', 'more', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'body', 'parts', 'belong', 'one', 'Jennifers', 'serial', 'killer', 'spree', 'baffled', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Even', 'old', 'pal', 'portrayed', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Millenium', ""n't"", 'see', 'connection', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'must', 'battle', 'resentment', 'presence', 'skepticism', 'investigation', 'killer', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'wonderful', 'blind', 'Helena', 'only', 'person', 'have', 'seen', 'serial', 'murderer', 'Most', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'Garcia', 'score', 'Christopher', 'Young', 'intermittent', 'songs', 'artists', 'Lenny', 'Welch', 'augmenting', 'growing', 'love', 'Helena', 'fear', 'life.Kathy', 'Baker', 'excellent', 'Berlin', 'big', 'sister', 'sorts', 'old', 'pal', 'Erikson', 'wife', 'Garcia', 'cop', 'more', 'C.S.I', 'action', 'hero', 'lending', 'certain', 'depth', 'character', 'Director', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Rudin', 'production', 'story', 'implausible', 'conclusion', 'director', 'never', 'atmosphere', 'waver', 'Garcia', 'Thurman', 'make', 'nice', 'couple', 'here', 'believability', 'romance', 'few', 'plot', 'problems', 'make', 'quietly', 'terrific', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'couple', 'brief', 'shots', 'Thurman', 'topless', 'bathtub', 'highlight', 'vulnerability', 'when', 'killer', 'nearby', 'Today', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'PG-13.The', 'elements', 'snow', 'rain', 'nighttime', 'are', 'used', 'help', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'many', 'will', 'love', 'Critics', 'had', 'strong', 'reactions', 'film', 'ends', 'star', 'rating', 'chemistry', 'Garcia', 'Thurman', 'mood', 'captured', 'maintained', 'made', 'one', 'big', 'success', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'sort', 'affection', 'fact', 'having', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'years', 'ago', 'initial', 'release', 'Fans', 'original', 'C.S.I', 'television', 'will', 'recognize', 'elements', 'mood', 'sometimes', 'found', 'show', 'Jennifer', 'Eight', 'was', 'filmed', 'years', 'final', 'shot', 'viewer', 'back', 'nicely', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'hung', 'end', 'like', 'pick', 'apart', 'plots', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'lean', 'towards', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'one', 'Garcia', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'refreshing', 'chance', 'see', 'Thurman', 'best']",Jennifer 8 VHS
332795,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302763193,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[3, 3]","The first thought that springs to mind is 'UNDERRATED.' Andy Garcia plays a cop who has recently relocated. He stumbles onto a case that is only a small part of a much bigger picture. What evidence is available leads him to an institution for the blind. He then meets Uma Thurman. Uma is able to give him some information, but obviously, her blindness limits what evidence she can offer. But she offers some interesting bits of information that she can. (What the different cars sounded like....knowing that the killer knew how blind people shake hands....etc) Eventually, Garcia and Thurman strike up a more friendly relationship, and there are some really beautiful scenes. (Like when Garcia takes her on the boat and she is enjoying the sensation of the water falling on her.) I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but suspense gradually builds, and Andy eventually finds himself facing dangerous accusations, and of course Uma finds herself in danger as well. While the pace of this movie may seem on the slower side, it is well done. (Sometimes this is done so we get a chance to know the characters.) Without ruining the ending, there is an unusally frightening moment towards the end where Uma has to defend herself, and her blindness differentiates this climactic moment from other movies. This movie was made in 92, but it has charm from the 70s and 80s. The scenery is beautiful; the background music fits into the story (rather than being a commercial for new tapes/cds on the market). For some reason, a lot of people who made movies in the 90s decided that for a movie to work, there have to be an absurd amount of special effects; someone has to get beaten up or killed every 5 minutes; there has to be a lot of cursing; and humor only works on a slapstick level. Interestingly, this movie currently only has a few reviews, and some of them are on the lower side. To all of you reading this, sometimes a great deal of value is found in the more obscure things. WARNING: DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THIS MOVIE ONLY HAS A FEW REVIEWS WITH SOME OF THEM NEGATIVE.

332798,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6302763193,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Back in the days of VHS I was working in video distribution. This was introduced to hit the rental market and, when I receive my promo kit, I took it home and popped it into the old VCR. I liked it enough but didn't think much about it afterward. It''s resurfaced on Netflix with better user reviews than I would have imagined, so I figured to give it another shot. Glad I did.Here's the scoop. Andy Garcia was a detective in L.A. His life unraveled after his girlfriend bailed on him so he moved to a small town up north (Oregon?) to get his life back on track. He latches onto a case that suggests he might be looking at a serial killer targeting blind women. When he visits an institution that assists blind women, to interview a possible witness (Uma Thurman), he begins to get involved with her and the case takes some turns that get him into serious trouble and have his co-workers doubting his sanity.This is not what you would consider great art as far as film making is concerned but it is good craft. The script navigates the story very evenhandedly and the directing is very decent. I thought there was good use of location and weather. At times it was raining, other times snowing and other times broodingly overcast. The locations were varied but no concrete and steel here. These were mostly remote locations that gave a sense of things being bleak. The blind card was used well. The way Thurman remembered small things, or was able to point out seemingly minor details, added up nicely and was evenly spaced so it didn't telegraph the ending. It was good seeing Uma Thurman in an early role. She already had some decent films under her belt but wasn't quite a household name. I don't dislike Andy Garcia but I won't ever be the first in line to see his next movie. He's Okay here. Not bad but not great. The supporting actors do a good job. Lance Hendrickson, as his partner, is always likable. Graham Beckel is usually cast as a slimeball and that's where he's at here.All the production values are good so the viewer isn't distracted. Some could argue the ending but I liked it. It was a quick way to pull a lot of strings together. No fuss. No Muss. I like this type of movie. Mystery thrillers are always good fodder for film. Though not the best of its ilk it's more than watchable.",4,Better Than I Remembered,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,2302,"['Back', 'days', 'VHS', 'was', 'working', 'video', 'distribution', 'was', 'introduced', 'hit', 'rental', 'market', 'when', 'receive', 'promo', 'kit', 'took', 'home', 'popped', 'old', 'VCR', 'liked', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'afterward', 's', 'resurfaced', 'Netflix', 'better', 'user', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'figured', 'give', 'shot', 'Glad', 'did.Here', 'scoop', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'was', 'detective', 'L.A.', 'life', 'unraveled', 'girlfriend', 'bailed', 'so', 'moved', 'small', 'town', 'up', 'north', 'Oregon', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'case', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'serial', 'killer', 'targeting', 'blind', 'women', 'When', 'institution', 'women', 'interview', 'possible', 'witness', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'get', 'involved', 'case', 'turns', 'get', 'serious', 'trouble', 'have', 'co-workers', 'doubting', 'sanity.This', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'great', 'art', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'making', 'concerned', 'good', 'craft', 'script', 'story', 'very', 'evenhandedly', 'directing', 'very', 'decent', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'good', 'use', 'location', 'weather', 'times', 'was', 'raining', 'other', 'times', 'snowing', 'other', 'times', 'broodingly', 'overcast', 'locations', 'were', 'varied', 'concrete', 'steel', 'here', 'were', 'mostly', 'remote', 'locations', 'gave', 'sense', 'things', 'being', 'bleak', 'blind', 'card', 'was', 'used', 'well', 'way', 'Thurman', 'remembered', 'small', 'things', 'was', 'able', 'point', 'out', 'seemingly', 'minor', 'details', 'added', 'up', 'nicely', 'was', 'evenly', 'spaced', 'did', ""n't"", 'telegraph', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'seeing', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'early', 'role', 'already', 'had', 'decent', 'films', 'belt', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'household', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'see', 'next', 'movie', 'Okay', 'here', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'supporting', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Lance', 'Hendrickson', 'partner', 'always', 'likable', 'Graham', 'Beckel', 'usually', 'cast', 'slimeball', 'where', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'distracted', 'could', 'argue', 'ending', 'liked', 'was', 'quick', 'way', 'pull', 'lot', 'strings', 'together', 'fuss', 'Muss', 'type', 'movie', 'Mystery', 'thrillers', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'fodder', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'ilk', 'more', 'watchable']",Jennifer 8 VHS

332810,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6302763193,Mike Stone,"[20, 26]","Writer/Director Bruce Robinson, best known for his cult hit ""Withnail & I"", has crafted a creditable little thriller in ""Jennifer 8"".  It gets all the technical elements right, features some fine work from its actors, and does its best to screw around with the genre.  But it rarely adds up to anything more than the sum of its parts.One of the strengths of Robinson's script is the stylish and effective dialogue he gives to his police officers.  Most of the best bits come from the mouth of Sergeant Ross, like when he tells his wife he can't stay for dinner because it's ""Friday night at City Hall... I've got a chance to frighten the fat.""  He's talking about securing a confession from a suspect, but it hardly matters, doesn't it?  ""Where are the ladies?"" asks Sergeant Berlin, before a party.  ""Putting on the warpaint,"" comes Ross' reply.  My favourite line, and probably the film's most ostentatious, is this little nugget which falls from the mouth of a visiting FBI investigator: ""You're confused... you don't know if Tuesdays come in twos or happen once a week.""  It's the kind of raw poetry that Quentin Tarantino specializes in (or at least has learned to crib from Elmore Leonard).Andy Garcia carries the movie on his shoulders.  His John Berlin (quite the pregnant name, as the film was released three years to the month after The Wall came down; are John's walls ready to crumble too?  Stay tuned...) is a rather complex man, burdened by a shady past that is slowly alluded to, but never fully explained (""I feel like I said sorry on every street in [Los Angeles],"" is the closest he comes to an explanation).  Berlin is a model of patience and intuition (although I didn't buy the one moment of inspiration that lead him to his key witness; it's a ""movie moment"" that takes away from the reality Robinson is trying to inject into the film), quiet and reserved for most of the film, but prone to fits of rage when pushed.  It's almost like Garcia, fresh off of working with Al Pacino, was modeling his character on that actor's work as Michael Corleone in the first two ""Godfather"" films.  That's high praise, indeed, but Garcia's work here deserves it.Uma Thurman plays Helena Robertson, ""the worst witness [Berlin's] ever had,"" a blind music teacher who may be the only witness able to identify the man that killed 'Jennifer'.  And what fates do ""only witnesses"" usually have in suspense films?  They're the next victim, of course!  Which gives Berlin a great excuse to stay close Helena, and fall in love with her.  Thurman here really only has two jobs: to look adorable and play blind credibly.  The first, of course, she does with ease.  I've always thought of Thurman as kind of a female-version of Keanu Reeves: she's at her best when not saying much, and letting her physicality and obvious screen presence carry much of the load.  Which she gets to do here.  As for that second job, portraying Helena's blindness, Thurman achieves some semblance of credibility there.  Affecting a dead-eyed look, you believe her as a blind girl, albeit one with startling mobility.Lance Henriksen does what Lance Henriksen does best: he makes a rugged, [angry], misanthropic and misogynistic cop, constantly stuck in fourth gear, come across as rather likable.  In his hands, with that map of the world face and baritone voice, Sergeant Freddy Ross is almost endearing.  He's a big fish in a small pond, the kind of small town man who would name his boat ""Duke"" and not think twice about vocally ogling the... of the local waitresses.  He and Garcia have kind of an oil-and-water relationship, but Henriksen's over-the-top showiness meshes perfectly with Garcia's solemnity.The one way in which the film doesn't play fair with its audience is in listing John Malkovich's name in the opening credits, and then making us wait eighty-minutes before the man shows up.  But when he does, that distinctive whisper of a voice is heard before the face appears, it's vintage Malk.He plays an FBI investigator named St. Anne, who locks horns with Berlin in several lengthy scenes.  Watching Garcia match wits with Malk is a real treat, the latter man's cool and whimsical aura offering a perfect counterpoint to the former's repressed fire.  In Malk's hands, St. Anne has seen it all, giving himself leeway to toy with Berlin, trying to catch him in verbal traps and constantly rolling his eyes.  But, like Garcia, Malk is able to let his instrument loose, erupting in violent outbursts periodically, which show the character's true power.  And in a silly bit of business, Malk, for some reason, chooses to play the latter half of his scenes with a rather comic stuffed nose.Being an avid fan of the serial killer genre, I was looking forward to finally seeing ""Jennifer 8"".  It lived up to my expectations, mostly, but for some reason I just couldn't fully give my heart to it.  I liked it well enough, but it never gave me the visceral thrill I was hoping for.  I suspect the reason for this is that this kind of story has been done many times before, often with much more verve and wit and fun.  Seen in the shadows of the heavyweights of its genre, ""Jennifer 8"" is a workmanlike effort, sure to give a modicum of thrills.  I recommend it on an intellectual level, but have my doubts about its effectiveness on an emotional one.",3,"Breathless, Sightless, Dead",1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,5332,"['Writer/Director',

332815,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302763193,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Jennifer 8 (Bruce Robinson, 1992)I first saw Jennifer 8 twenty years ago, right after it had come out on video. I hadn't watched it since, and pretty much all I remembered about it was ""Uma Thurman nude! Yaaaaaaaaaay!"" and then hitting the end credits and ""body double! Boooooooooooo!"" So I figured I'd give it another look and see if it held up after all these years. Surprisingly, it does, though it is certainly not without its flaws; while I was watching, I was also reminded that this was one of the first times when Andy Garcia, who was just beginning a decade of can't-go-wrong flicks that lasted till (or through, depending on your POV) 2001's The Unsaid, made an impression on me. It is not a movie without flaws, but it's still some decent watchin' that presages Blink, released two years later (with many of those same flaws).Garcia (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead) plays John Berlin, an LA detective who, desperate to get out of the city, transfers to the sleepy town of Eureka, where he gets partnered with Freddy Ross (the ubiquitous Lance Henriksen) and immediately finds himself involved in a murder investigation that bears possible ties to a serial killer Berlin was investigating in LA. Problem is, he could never convince anyone there was an actual serial killer wandering around. Berlin meets Helena (Kill Bill's Uma Thurman) and becomes convinced she's the guy's next victim, while his new squadmates think he's downright nuts...until a few of them start thinking that maybe there is a serial killer wandering around, and his name is John Berlin.The drawbacks are simple and easily pointed out: the pacing is abysmal in places (this is an hour and a half long movie that takes place in two hours and four minutes), and the setup for the last twenty minutes or so has a few bits where the viewer has to, shall we say, stretch the bonds of credibility farther than they're usually willing to go without snapping. (Without being spoily, I'll just say ""cheese and crackers, but the scene on the fire escape..."".) Balancing these drawbacks are a plethora of solid-to-incredible performances not only from the principal cast, but from some minor characters whose parts are elevated by jaw-dropping casting decisions (John Malkovich is basically a cameo; I'm amazed he took such a small part, but he does a wonderful job with it.
