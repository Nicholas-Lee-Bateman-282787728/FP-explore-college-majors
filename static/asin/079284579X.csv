154368,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,079284579X,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The film begins with a view of lower Manhattan at night as the credits roll. There is an amusing scene from a film. Rollie's accent is thicker. That clown seems almost human. Mike wants Rollie's help to bait a trap with a decoy, but is refused. Then Rollie changes his mind and creates the decoy. The trap is set to catch the suspect [they know who it is]. Will he fall for it? Will something go wrong? Who was that man on the back stairs? ""There's been an accident."" They show early model personal computers. Was Mike set up to be killed? What will Rollie discover on the tape? Who will threaten him? There is exciting action until McCarthy arrives to save Rollie.Leo figures out what happened. We see an old mainframe computer room with hundreds of reel tapes. Leo looks up the old cases that Mike was investigating. Will somebody tap Silac's telephone? Leo investigates the case. What happened to those ten medallions? Will they send a file via a modem? Will there be an interruption? [Is the chase in the grocery believable?] A drive-by shooting by the mob? Leo seeks help from Liz. [What did Leo see on that cat?] The scene shifts to a large mansion on Long Island with a private dock. Then there is a final showdown where the participants speak out to solve the riddle. There are surprises to amaze the viewer at the end. ""Nobody told me."" The film ends in Rome.This is an average film that works if you don't question the complex story. While the scenes show New York, it was mostly filmed in Toronto. This sequel is not as good as the original, but it is still interesting.

154369,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079284579X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","Ok, so I watch a lot of stupid movies in order to fill a ballot of my personal awards that I pressure myself into making accurate and legitimate.  I'm a `lists junkie' and I feel the need to categorize and catalog what I feel is the best of the best.  It's like my own variation of ADD.  In that attempt, I often find the dumbest films in categories like `Sound' and `Visual Effects' because, well, it's hard to find a truly inspired film that uses those effects as a showcase.  So, while looking for films from 1991 to see, I stumbled upon `F/X2' and I thought, `I bet this will have some great special effects'.I was half right.One cannot expect the special effects to be as top notch as recent ones because, well, this is a 90's film.  The effects are going to be dated.  Sadly, in a year that brought us `T2: Judgment Day' and `The Rocketeer', I was expecting something bigger, bolder and better.  Instead, I got a slew of gimmicky effects and some stripped down action sequences that were cheesy and rather laughable.  I mean, I thought this was an action thriller, but beating someone up with a mechanical clown, while unique, wasn't exactly thrilling, and then beating someone up with grocery hams was downright hilarious (in a bad way).  The effects towards the end get better (when there are actual explosions) but the tense scenes are overrode by terrible acting and dialog (""what if I made a copy""...intrigued mean face...""did you?"") to the point where the film just isn't interesting; like, at all.Thankfully Brian Dennehy is charismatic and holds our attention for a while, but the obviousness of this film is bland and the overall impact is extremely poor.And honestly, what is this film's obsession with food?",1,LOL...popcorn?,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,1724,"['Ok', 'watch', 'lot', 'stupid', 'movies', 'order', 'fill', 'ballot', 'personal', 'awards', 'pressure', 'making', 'accurate', 'legitimate', ""'m"", 'lists', 'junkie', 'feel', 'need', 'categorize', 'catalog', 'what', 'feel', 'best', 'best', 'own', 'variation', 'ADD', 'attempt', 'often', 'find', 'dumbest', 'films', 'categories', 'Sound', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'well', 'hard', 'find', 'truly', 'inspired', 'film', 'effects', 'showcase', 'So', 'looking', 'films', '1991', 'see', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'F/X2', 'thought', 'bet', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'special', ""effects'.I"", 'was', 'half', 'right.One', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'recent', 'ones', 'well', '90', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'dated', 'Sadly', 'year', 'brought', 'T2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'Rocketeer', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'bigger', 'bolder', 'better', 'Instead', 'got', 'slew', 'gimmicky', 'effects', 'stripped', 'down', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'cheesy', 'rather', 'laughable', 'mean', 'thought', 'was', 'action', 'thriller', 'beating', 'someone', 'up', 'mechanical', 'clown', 'unique', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'thrilling', 'then', 'beating', 'someone', 'up', 'grocery', 'hams', 'was', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'bad', 'way', 'effects', 'end', 'get', 'better', 'when', 'are', 'actual', 'explosions', 'tense', 'scenes', 'are', 'overrode', 'terrible', 'acting', 'dialog', 'what', 'made', 'copy', 'intrigued', 'mean', 'face', 'did', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'all.Thankfully', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'charismatic', 'attention', 'while', 'obviousness', 'film', 'bland', 'overall', 'impact', 'extremely', 'poor.And', 'honestly', 'what', 'film', 'obsession', 'food']",N/A

The film is filled with clever amusing gadgets, much more and cleverer than are found in a James Bond movie. As in FX, Bryan Brown is talked into helping the police by using his technical skills, but as in the first film, he is being duped. He is hired to dress his friend, a police officer, as a woman to draw a rapist to him/her for capture. However, as in the first film, his well developed plan goes wrong and his friend is knifed from behind. His friend's boss claims the murderer is a man who came to rape the woman and he shot the man. However, Brown set up a camera to film the event and saw that another man was the killer. He realizes that he has become mixed up with dirty cops. He needs to understand why his friend was set up to be murdered? Why he was asked to participate? Why the true murderer is being covered up? What are the dirty cops trying to get? He calls Brian Dennehy, who helped him in FX, and the two unravel the mystery.Viewers will enjoy watching Brown trying to escape the killer in several separate long scenes where there are exiting and clever chases.

Apparently, because so many others did, they did the sequel thing that adds up to more of the same but without the spirit that animated the first one.  Rather than a flawed and realistic character who gets duped into terrible adventure, then improvises his way out, you get a kind of superhero who never makes mistakes and whose plans always work perfectly.  Of course, he's the same inventive guy, but this just doesn't have the same adrenaline rush and fearful pace as the first one, where you never knew what to expect - in this one, you expect magic, which takes away the magic.  There are many funny scenes, such as a thug chase in a grocery store, where our impresario uses everyday things to defend himself and then attack.
