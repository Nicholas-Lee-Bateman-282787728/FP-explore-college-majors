But the one thing that got me out of all this series is that its to SHORT!! only 13 episodes long and the people who made the anime I feel like were just being lazy.Plot: (non spoiler) The story follows a samurai named Tochiro Oyama whos clan was wiped out in a conflict leaving him the only samurai in the wild wild west is looking for the evil-doer named  Darkmeister. Along with his friend Harlock and a woman named Sinunora they search all over the west to find Darkmeister to stop his evil plans from enslaving Japanese immigrints from becomeing slaves.Voice Acting: Its pretty good. All the characters voices I think went very well with peope who did them.Cons: As you remember from the begining I said the makers of the anime are very lazy by that I mean 13 episodes, what the core problem I have with it is that (mini spoiler) in the last episode (#13) the team finally catches up to Darkmeister who wears a mask to hide his face and escapes from what I remember is a blimp or a hot air balloon and never says a word. Sadly this is how the anime ends :( they find the villian and he escapes and story ends there.over all: if you dont mind a bad ending then over all its a good anime, but from the prices I dont see playing 80 dollars for a brand new set would be good",3,It's too good to be this short,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,1323,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'series', 'SHORT', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'long', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'anime', 'feel', 'were', 'just', 'being', 'lazy.Plot', 'spoiler', 'story', 'samurai', 'named', 'Tochiro', 'Oyama', 'whos', 'clan', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'conflict', 'leaving', 'only', 'samurai', 'wild', 'wild', 'west', 'looking', 'evil-doer', 'named', 'Darkmeister', 'friend', 'Harlock', 'woman', 'named', 'Sinunora', 'search', 'west', 'find', 'Darkmeister', 'stop', 'evil', 'plans', 'enslaving', 'Japanese', 'immigrints', 'becomeing', 'slaves.Voice', 'Acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'characters', 'voices', 'think', 'went', 'very', 'well', 'peope', 'who', 'did', 'them.Cons', 'remember', 'begining', 'said', 'makers', 'anime', 'are', 'very', 'lazy', 'mean', '13', 'episodes', 'what', 'core', 'problem', 'have', 'mini', 'spoiler', 'last', 'episode', '13', 'team', 'finally', 'up', 'Darkmeister', 'who', 'mask', 'hide', 'face', 'escapes', 'what', 'remember', 'blimp', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'never', 'word', 'Sadly', 'how', 'anime', 'ends', 'find', 'villian', 'story', 'ends', 'dont', 'mind', 'bad', 'ending', 'then', 'good', 'anime', 'prices', 'dont', 'see', 'playing', '80', 'dollars', 'brand', 'new', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'good']",N/A
795829,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B00018WL12,coopertex,"[2, 2]","The editorial review shown above, written by Charles Solomon, is very accurate and I agree with him for the most part. The story is very vague in the beggining as we follow Tochiro and Harlock's characters looking for the last survivors of Samuria Creek. They travel from town to town and encounter lots of opposition from the townsfolks who are either, corrupt, crazy, racist and stupid. There are lots of racists remarks made through out and this may offend some viewers (and because of this very fact) I cannot recoommend it to children. This is an adult themed anime with lots of shoot-outs, hangings and even the the threat of rape and violence to women. The violence is not gory at all. The sex it mainly implied and nudity is very weak but it is all there. As an adult anime it fails because it lacks the intensity that makes the sex and action sequences have more impact. The charcter designs are unattractive and lack detail. The animation quality comes close to a saturday morning cartoon (not good). Despite my many complaints I enjoyed the anime overall, because of Tochiro and Harlock were always getting into and out of trouble, it had that cliffhanger flare to it; like a comic book. Also many of the episodes were self contained so you didn't have to worry too much about continuity. The whole western theme with gunslingers and bounty hunters always facinated me and this series just pours it on. I also enjoyed the pacing of the the show; it was slow paced but contained the right blend of action. I know that the creators spent a great deal of time trying to get the look, feel and sounds of the western world done correctly and I think they did a great job on that aspect. But in order to make this series better it needs to change; the racist remarks, the constant threat of characters being hanged and finish the storyline with a conclusion. There were thirteen episodes of Gun Frontier and eposide thirteen leaves you hanging (no pun intended). Good for adults. I recommend this anime to anyone that likes action/ westerns and this is one of the few western anime series that I know of. Some people tell me about Trigun being better and that is true but Trigun is more of Sci-Fi genre.",3,Bad Cowboys And Lots Of Fun,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,2208,"['editorial', 'review', 'shown', 'written', 'Charles', 'Solomon', 'very', 'accurate', 'agree', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'very', 'vague', 'beggining', 'follow', 'Tochiro', 'Harlock', 'characters', 'looking', 'last', 'survivors', 'Samuria', 'Creek', 'travel', 'town', 'town', 'encounter', 'lots', 'opposition', 'townsfolks', 'who', 'are', 'either', 'corrupt', 'crazy', 'racist', 'stupid', 'are', 'lots', 'racists', 'remarks', 'made', 'may', 'offend', 'viewers', 'very', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'recoommend', 'children', 'adult', 'themed', 'anime', 'lots', 'shoot-outs', 'hangings', 'even', 'threat', 'rape', 'violence', 'women', 'violence', 'not', 'gory', 'sex', 'mainly', 'implied', 'nudity', 'very', 'weak', 'there', 'adult', 'anime', 'intensity', 'sex', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'charcter', 'designs', 'are', 'unattractive', 'lack', 'detail', 'animation', 'quality', 'close', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'not', 'good', 'many', 'complaints', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'overall', 'Tochiro', 'Harlock', 'were', 'always', 'getting', 'trouble', 'had', 'cliffhanger', 'flare', 'comic', 'book', 'Also', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'contained', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'continuity', 'whole', 'western', 'theme', 'gunslingers', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'always', 'facinated', 'series', 'just', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'pacing', 'show', 'was', 'slow', 'paced', 'contained', 'right', 'blend', 'action', 'know', 'creators', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'look', 'feel', 'sounds', 'western', 'world', 'done', 'correctly', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'aspect', 'order', 'make', 'series', 'better', 'change', 'racist', 'remarks', 'constant', 'threat', 'characters', 'being', 'hanged', 'finish', 'storyline', 'conclusion', 'were', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Gun', 'Frontier', 'eposide', 'thirteen', 'leaves', 'hanging', 'pun', 'intended', 'Good', 'adults', 'recommend', 'anime', 'anyone', 'action/', 'westerns', 'one', 'few', 'western', 'anime', 'series', 'know', 'people', 'tell', 'Trigun', 'being', 'better', 'true', 'Trigun', 'more', 'Sci-Fi', 'genre']",N/A
795830,A3FG0FQHNV2UP2,B00018WL12,E. A. Montgomery,"[2, 6]","This makes me rethink my Harlock allegiance. I've heard there was a project so bad that Matsumoto disowned it before he ever finished it. If it's not Gun Frontier, then I hope I never see what it was. My husband and brother, also Matsumoto fans, spent most of the third episode creating new phrases to describe the quality. (The winner was 'Schlock and Awe' followed closely by 'Crapulent') Apparently the West was won by the rape of good women, the killing of bad women, mass murder and fear of homosexuality. My overwhelming feeling was that Matsumoto wondered if he could do anything like Monkey Punch's Lupin series, found he couldn't, and moved on. A few sample plot points - one women is gang raped while Harlock and Tochiro are tied and unable to help her. She sacrifices her life to save theirs, because she can't go back to her family so defiled. They seem pretty ok with all of this, which is a good thing since shortly they will be tied again for another  rape (which doesn't actually happen) after which they will whine about how the rape affects them, as the 'victim' jokes about making them raise any offspring. Because rape is funny. Unless it's not, in which case the woman should end her life saving people who did nothing to help her. Later, they arrive at a town which thinks it's a pattern card of morality. In truth, the town is a cover for the gang rapists, who frame the Native Americans for their actions. When the Natives kill the entire town as payment for their leader's crimes, Harlock and Tochiro are ok with that too. There is no heroism in Gun Frontier. It's a western without a cause, unless that cause is 'fan service' for the damaged. Deeply disappointing, with none of the charm of his other works.",1,Criminally Bad,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1733,"['rethink', 'Harlock', 'allegiance', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'project', 'so', 'bad', 'Matsumoto', 'disowned', 'ever', 'finished', 'not', 'Gun', 'Frontier', 'then', 'hope', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'husband', 'brother', 'also', 'Matsumoto', 'fans', 'spent', 'most', 'third', 'episode', 'creating', 'new', 'phrases', 'describe', 'quality', 'winner', 'was', ""'Schlock"", 'Awe', 'followed', 'closely', ""'Crapulent"", 'Apparently', 'West', 'was', 'won', 'rape', 'good', 'women', 'killing', 'bad', 'women', 'mass', 'murder', 'fear', 'homosexuality', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'was', 'Matsumoto', 'wondered', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'Monkey', 'Punch', 'Lupin', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'moved', 'few', 'sample', 'plot', 'points', 'one', 'women', 'gang', 'raped', 'Harlock', 'Tochiro', 'are', 'tied', 'unable', 'help', 'life', 'save', 'theirs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'family', 'so', 'defiled', 'seem', 'pretty', 'ok', 'good', 'thing', 'shortly', 'will', 'be', 'tied', 'again', 'rape', ""n't"", 'actually', 'happen', 'will', 'whine', 'how', 'rape', ""'victim"", 'jokes', 'making', 'raise', 'offspring', 'rape', 'funny', 'not', 'case', 'woman', 'should', 'end', 'life', 'saving', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'Later', 'arrive', 'town', 'pattern', 'card', 'morality', 'truth', 'town', 'cover', 'gang', 'rapists', 'who', 'frame', 'Native', 'Americans', 'actions', 'When', 'Natives', 'kill', 'entire', 'town', 'payment', 'leader', 'crimes', 'Harlock', 'Tochiro', 'are', 'ok', 'too', 'heroism', 'Gun', 'Frontier', 'western', 'cause', 'cause', ""'fan"", 'service', 'damaged', 'Deeply', 'disappointing', 'none', 'charm', 'other', 'works']",N/A

795832,A2US0QBGZ6BIMB,B00018WL12,W. Hohauser,"[3, 3]","One of the best Harlock offerings out there and a very good western besides. After seeing a number of Matsumoto based animes not living up to their potential, this is a great treat.Ignore the description provided by the US distributor, this is NOT a Captain Harlock Space Pirate sci-fi story! The main characters are apparently distant ancestors of Space Pirate Harlock and his best friend Tochiro who happen to also be best friends. The story is set in the late 1800's in the wild west of the United States, a very strange wild west. The two are on a quest and get shadowed by a mysterious woman and the criminal organization that hired her.The animation is limited but done well. The design is very good. The scripts as seen through the subtitles are way above average for any anime. The Western themed music (except for the opening and close) is very simple but really fits the atmosphere of the show. The pacing is very close to the great spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. The entire show is a mix of existential philosophy, odd humor and spaghetti western violence. This is a real joy to watch but I recommend watching one episode at a time.Two notes for anyone thinking of Gun Frontier:1) This is an adult themed anime and has a lot of hard violence at times. Also there is quite a bit of female nudity. It's that weird Japanese nudity where the women have no nipples and look like store window dummies. It's happens too much in the course of the program. These things and the repeated rape threats on the main female character make this series unsuitable for children.2) This 13 episode series is part of a larger story so the last episode is a major cliffhanger. Hopefully Matsumoto will get chance to finish the story.",5,Spaghetti Western Japanese Anime style,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,1727,"['One', 'best', 'Harlock', 'there', 'very', 'good', 'western', 'besides', 'seeing', 'number', 'Matsumoto', 'based', 'animes', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'great', 'description', 'provided', 'US', 'distributor', 'NOT', 'Captain', 'Harlock', 'Space', 'Pirate', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'apparently', 'distant', 'ancestors', 'Space', 'Pirate', 'Harlock', 'best', 'friend', 'Tochiro', 'who', 'happen', 'also', 'be', 'best', 'friends', 'story', 'set', 'late', '1800', 'wild', 'west', 'United', 'States', 'very', 'strange', 'wild', 'west', 'two', 'are', 'quest', 'get', 'shadowed', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'criminal', 'organization', 'hired', 'animation', 'limited', 'done', 'well', 'design', 'very', 'good', 'scripts', 'seen', 'subtitles', 'are', 'way', 'average', 'anime', 'Western', 'themed', 'music', 'opening', 'close', 'very', 'simple', 'really', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'pacing', 'very', 'close', 'great', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', '1960', 'entire', 'show', 'mix', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'odd', 'humor', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'violence', 'real', 'joy', 'watch', 'recommend', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'time.Two', 'notes', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'Gun', 'Frontier:1', 'adult', 'themed', 'anime', 'lot', 'hard', 'violence', 'times', 'Also', 'quite', 'bit', 'female', 'nudity', 'weird', 'Japanese', 'nudity', 'where', 'women', 'have', 'nipples', 'look', 'store', 'window', 'dummies', 'too', 'much', 'course', 'program', 'things', 'repeated', 'rape', 'threats', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'make', 'series', 'unsuitable', 'children.2', '13', 'episode', 'series', 'part', 'larger', 'story', 'last', 'episode', 'major', 'cliffhanger', 'Hopefully', 'Matsumoto', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'finish', 'story']",N/A
