We've owned several copies of the Live at the Acropolis video in VHS and DVD and worn them out.  Our favorite is the Tribute tour to India and China which are Yanni's best concerts by a thousand miles above the rest.  My wife and I attended a Yanni concert in Denver a few years ago as well.  So when I tell you this concert was a huge disappointment, you'll understand I'm speaking with a serious Yanni fan.  The music was good as usual and of course, there a few special moments, but overall it was a bit boring and a real let down.  It just didn't have the electricity of other concerts.  And the special effects background behind the orchestra was beyond cheesy.  You'll get good music on this video, but it won't give you anywhere near the quality of concert Yanni has put on in the past.... and you can watch it free on Netflix.  I certainly wouldn't pay full price for a new copy; I wouldn't even pay $3 for it if that tells you anything.

Alas, the man decided instead to release ""The Concert Event"" on blu-ray. And this one is just as good as the other, although the format here is some departure from ""Acropolis"".In Acropolis Yanni plays with the backing of a large Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra in a show tailored to the taste of Greek aristocrats (and their counter parts else where)- the ghost of Plato was milling in the crowd. This concert, which follows years later, incorporates a number of exotic musical instruments and musicians selected to give it an international flair. The tempo is often upbeat. All of which may be a good thing.

I expected this DVD out around 2000 since the first concert tape was out n 1994 and the second in 1997. Then, after attending one of his concerts in 2003, I thought that a DVD would be our for sure but the wait continued until late 2006.Most of the songs, thankfully, are new material. How much other new stuff I heard in the three-hour Buffalo concert I attended that wasn't on this DVD, I don't know but I'm not complaining. There are a couple of surprises in here, such as two solo violinists, a dulcimer player, and a flashy harpist-singer. A shock was not seeing violinist Karen Briggs on this DVD. She had  always been a staple in Yanni's tour concerts in the past 10 years and - next to the Yanni himself - the key performer and most recognizable one in past DVDs.However, Sayaka Katsuki, from Japan, who replaced her, is just fine. Katsuki and Armenian violinist Samvel Yervinyan make a dynamite duo, with the Russian being the best of the two, I think. He is fantastic. Both of them do a number of solos..The most versatile and best musician in the entire band is Pedro Eustache, who was with Yanni in his 1997 concert in China and India. He is still animated, talented and fun to watch. You can tell he's Yanni's right-hand man. Not far behind is keyboard player Ming Freeman, another holdover from the China concert.Of the new songs, the driving-beat, fast selections seem to be the best and generate the most enthusiasm among the crowd.  Songs such as ""Rainmaker,"" ""On Sacred Ground,"" ""Playtime,"" ""For All Seasons"" and ""World Dance"" will all have you tapping your feet, moving your hands, etc. They are great feel-good songs and perhaps the trademark of these Yanni Orchestra presentation. Of the older songs, the re-make of ""Nostalgia"" was tremendous, thanks to the added dramatic violin work of Yervinyan.This is just a fabulous concert, filmed in Las ?egas sometime, I think, in 2005. I watched this 7-8 times the first two months I owned it and loved it more and more each time.

From the very first note, it drew me in and didn't let go until almost 90 minutes later.Yanni conducts an orchestra made up of masterful musicians from around the world.  The variety of styles, tastes, and backgrounds adds a spice to the music that just cannot be artificially created.  Take the Armenian violinist for example -- this man is the Monet of violinists.  The notes and melodies he crafted were nothing short of breathtaking.  When he is performing in a duet with a female Japanese violinist, it brought me out of my chair.  And she went toe-to-toe with him playing more notes faster and faster as the duet went on.  I thought they would collapse in exhaustion from playing so hard.  Meanwhile, she is smiling as she is playing!  That woman is amazing.  Seeing two extremely skilled violinists just pushing each other to perform better was exciting.The flutist from Sri Lanka, who makes his own flutes, was utterly amazing.  How he made such harmonious and delicious notes come from that tiny piece of wood, I will never now.  His enthusiasm for his music was expressed in his work.The harpist (right words) does a vocal piece that...wow.  Then later in the concert, he makes the harp practically dance.  The notes that came from that harp...wow.  He does motion where he runs his hands through all the strings on the harp -- it creates a unique and pleasing to the ear sound.The female vocalists had voices like angels that just floated through the arena.  Michele Amato was one of the vocalists and her voice just...it washed over me like a soft wave.Ramon, who played a horn (or trumpet, I don't know) added a Cuban or Carribean/Latin feel.There were two other people, whose names escape me -- One played what looked like a hand-crafted wood instrument with strings.  I had never seen such a thing before and couldn't believe the warm and soothing sounds that came from it.  There was also a violinist who does a little dance while playing.  The audience exploded in applause when he does the dance.The camera work in the concert includes 16 hi-def cameras that are crystal-clear on an HDTV.  The lighting is excellent, as usual, with a Yanni concert.  The director has cameramen stationed throughout the arena and sprinkled within the orchestra.  The shots of the audience as they go through a range of emotions -- excitement, sadness, reflection, warmth -- just add to the experience.  Seeing so many people be moved by Yanni's music...Wow.I highly recommend this DVD for any Yanni fan.  As a bonus, after the concert, there was about 15 minutes of behinds the scenes footage.  It showed Yanni and the orchestra practicing as Yanni explains the diverse backgrounds in the orchestra and how they arrived here.",5,"Enchanting, Stunning, Energizing, and Addictive.",1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2854,"['local', 'PBS', 'station', 'aired', 'Yanni', 'concert', 'Yanni', 'concert', 'Mandelay', 'Bay', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'show', 'was', 'spectacular', 'very', 'first', 'note', 'drew', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'almost', '90', 'minutes', 'later.Yanni', 'conducts', 'orchestra', 'made', 'masterful', 'musicians', 'world', 'variety', 'styles', 'tastes', 'spice', 'music', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'artificially', 'created', 'Take', 'Armenian', 'violinist', 'example', 'man', 'Monet', 'violinists', 'notes', 'melodies', 'crafted', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'breathtaking', 'When', 'performing', 'duet', 'female', 'Japanese', 'violinist', 'brought', 'chair', 'went', 'toe-to-toe', 'playing', 'more', 'notes', 'faster', 'faster', 'duet', 'went', 'thought', 'would', 'collapse', 'exhaustion', 'playing', 'so', 'hard', 'Meanwhile', 'smiling', 'playing', 'woman', 'amazing', 'Seeing', 'two', 'extremely', 'skilled', 'violinists', 'just', 'pushing', 'other', 'perform', 'better', 'was', 'exciting.The', 'flutist', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'who', 'own', 'flutes', 'was', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'How', 'made', 'such', 'harmonious', 'delicious', 'notes', 'come', 'tiny', 'piece', 'wood', 'will', 'never', 'now', 'enthusiasm', 'music', 'was', 'expressed', 'work.The', 'harpist', 'right', 'words', 'vocal', 'piece', 'wow', 'Then', 'later', 'concert', 'harp', 'practically', 'dance', 'notes', 'came', 'harp', 'wow', 'motion', 'where', 'hands', 'strings', 'harp', 'unique', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'sound.The', 'female', 'vocalists', 'had', 'voices', 'angels', 'just', 'floated', 'arena', 'Michele', 'Amato', 'was', 'one', 'vocalists', 'voice', 'just', 'washed', 'soft', 'wave.Ramon', 'who', 'played', 'horn', 'trumpet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'added', 'Cuban', 'Carribean/Latin', 'feel.There', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'names', 'escape', 'One', 'played', 'what', 'looked', 'hand-crafted', 'wood', 'instrument', 'strings', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'warm', 'soothing', 'sounds', 'came', 'was', 'also', 'violinist', 'who', 'little', 'dance', 'playing', 'audience', 'exploded', 'applause', 'when', 'dance.The', 'camera', 'work', 'concert', '16', 'hi-def', 'cameras', 'are', 'crystal-clear', 'HDTV', 'lighting', 'excellent', 'usual', 'Yanni', 'concert', 'director', 'cameramen', 'stationed', 'arena', 'sprinkled', 'orchestra', 'shots', 'audience', 'go', 'range', 'emotions', 'excitement', 'sadness', 'reflection', 'warmth', 'just', 'add', 'experience', 'Seeing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'be', 'moved', 'Yanni', 'music', 'Wow.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Yanni', 'fan', 'bonus', 'concert', 'was', '15', 'minutes', 'behinds', 'scenes', 'footage', 'showed', 'Yanni', 'orchestra', 'practicing', 'Yanni', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'orchestra', 'how', 'arrived', 'here']",N/A

This one includes SOME of his 'older' pieces, but also has some truley AMAZING newer pieces (Playtime, On Sacred Gound, etc)!First off, the musicians are all VERY talented. What I love about all of Yanni's concert DVD's is he allows many of the individual musicians time to shine, they aren't just part of a large group of players.Here you will see just HOW talented AND inventive the musicians can get.For instance, you've heard a harp played before, but with THIS much passion and enthusiasm?! There's a piece where 2 PVC pipes are used (ala STOMP) to make rhythms that are wonderful!The vocalists are right on! The 2 lead violinists are there for their 'duel' (like in Acropolis), which I always loved. Karen Briggs isn't on hand this time, but this IS Yanni's tour program, so possibly she wasn't available for an entire tour, BUT the 2 lead violinists do a WONDERFUL job!There's a dulcimer player who is absolutely amazing the way he plays, and it's a great time to hear it played if you've never heard it before, OR to have is played like THIS!Now, I will admit, I'm pretty used to Acropolis & Tribute, so when I FIRST watch this DVD it DID take me some getting used, but I couldn't put it down! I don't know where the talent comes from with Yanni, but you can SEE he really feels the music inside him. That's something wonderful to see- a composer who FEELS the music, not just conductinc others.One note- the piece 'The Storm' is nothing short of breathtaking!It starts off slow, with a cello solo, but it's based on Vivaldi's 4 Seasons and Yanni really punches it up! If you're not a fan of the slower classical pieces this one in particular will blow you away! The violinists really DIG into this peice and, well..I thought they'd saw their violins in half!All in all...another spectacular, and sometimes moving concert!!!",5,How talented CAN this man get?!!,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,1869,"['have', 'Yanni', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'one', 'SOME', ""'older"", 'pieces', 'also', 'truley', 'AMAZING', 'newer', 'pieces', 'Playtime', 'Sacred', 'Gound', 'etc', 'First', 'off', 'musicians', 'are', 'VERY', 'talented', 'What', 'love', 'Yanni', 'concert', 'DVD', 'many', 'individual', 'musicians', 'time', 'shine', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'part', 'large', 'group', 'players.Here', 'will', 'see', 'just', 'HOW', 'talented', 'AND', 'inventive', 'musicians', 'can', 'get.For', 'instance', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'harp', 'played', 'THIS', 'much', 'passion', 'enthusiasm', 'piece', 'where', '2', 'PVC', 'pipes', 'are', 'used', 'ala', 'STOMP', 'make', 'rhythms', 'are', 'wonderful', 'vocalists', 'are', 'right', '2', 'lead', 'violinists', 'are', 'there', ""'duel"", 'Acropolis', 'always', 'loved', 'Karen', 'Briggs', ""n't"", 'hand', 'time', 'IS', 'Yanni', 'tour', 'program', 'possibly', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'entire', 'tour', 'BUT', '2', 'lead', 'violinists', 'do', 'WONDERFUL', 'job', 'dulcimer', 'player', 'who', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'way', 'great', 'time', 'hear', 'played', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'OR', 'have', 'played', 'THIS', 'Now', 'will', 'admit', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'used', 'Acropolis', 'Tribute', 'when', 'FIRST', 'watch', 'DVD', 'DID', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'talent', 'Yanni', 'can', 'SEE', 'really', 'music', 'something', 'wonderful', 'see-', 'composer', 'who', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'conductinc', 'others.One', 'note-', 'piece', 'Storm', 'nothing', 'short', 'breathtaking', 'slow', 'cello', 'solo', 'based', 'Vivaldi', '4', 'Seasons', 'Yanni', 'really', 'up', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'slower', 'classical', 'pieces', 'one', 'particular', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'violinists', 'really', 'DIG', 'peice', 'well..I', 'thought', ""'d"", 'saw', 'violins', 'half', 'spectacular', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'concert']",N/A

From piano to saxophone to flute to harp to violin to hammered dulcimer, to name a few, the show offers a variety of music taste. However, there was one instrument that was missing in the concert, the guitar ...  (no electric, no accoustic, no classical) I don't know if Yanni forgot it or something but it would be the complete music event if it had been included. Right now, this DVD occupies the 2nd spot on my list trailing behind his Tribute DVD. If you would listen to the song Love is All from the Tribute concert, you will know why I am missing the wonderful Spanish guitar sound!The singers are wonderful, Michelle Amato and Alfreda Gerald deliver top notch performance, I would like to see them as singers in Pink Floyld concert, Dark Side of the Moon, they are that good! All musicians are the cream of the crop in the world, especially the 2 guest violonists, how can they play that fast?  I am also glad to see Charlie Adams back as the drummer,a long time Yanni's friend, he rocks! The songs that really struck me were Storm and World Dance, although other songs were just outstanding too. The sound is offered in Digital 5.1 and DTS, nice.
