I grew up watching them in the 80's so I don't like how they have changed the characters somewhat and I don't like the &#34;modern humor&#34; they put in these.

It starts off with 3D CGI, but then it shifts to 2D animation when Grouchy gets visited by the three Smurfs of Christmas, played by Smurfette, Brainy, and Hefty in that order. The voices for this special were great, using the actors from the first live-action Smurfs movie with the exception of Papa Smurf (who is voiced by Jack Angel) and Smurfette (who is voiced by Melissa Sturm). The story itself is entertaining, though it's not anything you haven't seen before a hundred other times. The animation is a modern-day improvement over the Smurfs cartoon show specials from the 1980s, having been created by Duck Studios, but isn't so different that fans of the cartoon show can't find themselves enjoying it.
