Pretty gritty, lots of calving and trying to save the little guys when they're having trouble being born, etc.  Three very different ways of handling cattle on the ground - from modern to do-it-all-yourself old school.I really enjoy it because I love horses and looking at a lifestyle that uses them as the great animals they are for getting your work done will always have my full attention.  Makes ya wonder why someone would choose to ranch in Montana though!

It chronicles a year in the lives of three ranches in Montana. Two are run by families and the third, while family owned, was so large it was managed by family but worked by employees.

Every step of the year the narrator throws in your face that &#34;this decision could cost this family their ranch&#34; it was getting more than a little annoying.
