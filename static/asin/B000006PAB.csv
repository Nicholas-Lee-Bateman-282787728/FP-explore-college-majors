Seagal's daughter is kidnapped and Seagal must find her. Seagal is forced to deal with local police, the military, a rebel military group, our own CIA officers, and bad guys. Everyone has an agenda and Seagal must discover who kidnapped his daughter and where she is. Even our own CIA guys have motives that Seagal is not aware of. Can Seagal find his daughter before it is too late? Can Seagal survive an encounter with a rebel military group? What happens when the military wants to arrest Seagal?

Ching Siu Tung's action is beautifully done(if you can suspend disbelief as Stevie does a few spinning jump kicks high in the air when we all know that the man can't get more than two inches off the ground these days)and the special effects are practically seamless and amazingly done for lower budget picture such as this.  There is some cool stuff done with bullets and arrows, you'll know what I mean when you see it.Top-notch action from one of the world's best action directors, a decent if generic plot, and a whole lot of killing make for a nice little gem of a straight-to-dvd movie, despite Seagal's attempts to sabotage the proceedings.",4,King Of The Pudge,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,1171,"['Nowadays', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'be', 'eating', 'lot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'out', 'much', 'still', 'fit', 'make', 'movies', 'least', 'time', 'Lord', 'Steven', 'hooked', 'up', 'killer', 'director', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'own', 'Ching', 'Siu', 'Tung', ""'Naked"", 'Weapon', 'Death', 'together', ""'ve"", 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'action', 'movie.When', 'say', 'good', 'have', 'get', 'fact', 'Stevie', 'completely', 'shape', 'talks', 'different', 'voice', 'scene', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'refrigerator', 'Ching', 'Siu', 'Tung', 'action', 'beautifully', 'done', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Stevie', 'few', 'spinning', 'jump', 'kicks', 'high', 'air', 'when', 'know', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'two', 'inches', 'ground', 'days', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'practically', 'seamless', 'amazingly', 'done', 'lower', 'budget', 'picture', 'such', 'cool', 'stuff', 'done', 'bullets', 'arrows', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'it.Top-notch', 'action', 'one', 'world', 'best', 'action', 'directors', 'decent', 'generic', 'plot', 'whole', 'lot', 'killing', 'make', 'nice', 'little', 'gem', 'straight-to-dvd', 'movie', 'Seagal', 'attempts', 'sabotage', 'proceedings']",Belly of the Beast
494798,A2S0DU8QTQSKWK,B000006PAB,Brendon Spencer,"[1, 4]","No doubt the ""BELLY"" of the beast refers to Seagal's ever expanding body. With all the hype we hear these days of hollywood types starving themselves, hiring trainers so they'll look good, you'd think ol' Steve would get a clue and shove himself away from the trough occasionally.Alas, that is soooo obviously not the case. Seagal stumbles through scene after scene displaying his mediocre acting ability to the fullest. If anyone else did the same freakin' movie over and over (just different titles, folks) he'd be really good by this time. Not Seagal.Is his ego so big that he thinks no one will notice the many stunt doubles? Oh, sure, I believe that is really him climbing up the side of the house....without the benefit of a derrick. The camera cuts away from his face so often a person could get whiplash. I remember oh so long ago when he did the stunts and it was worth watching. Now a really bad Jackie Chan (and there were some stinkers) has better action than anything Seagal does. Yes, I know that Chan is now using doubles, but it's still Chan most of the time, and he is still giving us some great moves, keeping himself in shape, and MAKING AN EFFORT -- you hearing this Steve?This ""let's not even bother trying to sell it at the movies, but go straight to video"" waste of film has Seagal as the same character he always plays. Doing the same illegal things he always does, but not as well. Trying to be THE macho hero, which is impossible considering what he's working with these days. The plot is thin, the dialog is worth muting, and the hero should retire while he still has some imagined shreds of dignity left.Last night I watched OUT FOR JUSTICE. Pretty much the same storyline, but with some excellent action scenes. Add that with a couple of superb actors, William Forsythe and Gina Gershon, and you got a decent movie going. The camera backs up when Seagal goes to work and you see some good stuff going on. And, you know it's him doing the job. With UNDER SEIGE he had the basics for a great career in movies. Apparently that's over. He's just sliding along, taking the money, and not caring about the quality of work that is being done.Pass this one up, throw it down and step on it.

494805,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000006PAB,Jeffrey Leach,"[8, 8]","In the late 1980s and early 1990's, it looked as though Seagal would join the ranks of Hollywood's top action stars. You would hear his name in the same sentence with Arnie and Stallone, no small feat indeed. And to a large degree, Seagal's films deserved the comparison. ""Under Siege"" was a winner, as were ""Hard to Kill"" and ""Above the Law."" The actor's greatest appeal isn't hard to fathom; Seagal embraced a brutal form of martial arts that, at least onscreen, allowed him to slap down thugs, break bones, and wreak massive havoc without batting an eye. Literally, Seagal would stand in place and put down one goon after the other with an ease that looked not only natural but also realistic. I still enjoy watching that pool room scene where Seagal's character used pool cues, billiard balls, and whatever else he could lay his hands on to put out the trash. Alas, how the mighty have fallen. The early 1990s may as well be ancient history as far as Steven Seagal is concerned. Although he's still capable of making a few moderately entertaining films, which ""Belly of the Beast"" ultimately is, far too often we're seeing movies like ""The Foreigner"" and ""Ticker.""Seagal plays international man of mystery Jake Hopper, a guy who used to work for the CIA, the DEA, the FBI, or a dozen other intelligence gathering agencies--take your pick. As the movie opens, we see Hopper and his partner Sunti (Byron Mann) setting up a bunch of drug dealers in Thailand. Something goes wrong, probably a double cross, and the two agents must fight their way out of the building. In the process, Sunti accidentally kills a mother holding her infant child. He's so torn up over the incident that he goes off to join a Buddhist order, presumably leaving Hopper partnerless and a little lonely. Flash forward ten or so years. Hopper now works as a freelance operative, the sort of guy the agencies come to when they need a safe broken into. The only thing that matters to our hero is his lovely daughter Jessica (Sarah Lane), but tranquility shatters when a radical Islamic terrorist cell called the Abu Karaf abducts Jessica and a Senator's daughter. Abu Karaf sends a videotape of the two girls to the government, threatening to kill them if the authorities refuse to release a few prisoners. Predictably, Jake Hopper vows revenge for this horrible injustice. He goes on a series of rampages throughout the Far East in an effort to find his daughter.Hopper suspects that someone other than the Abu Karaf is behind the kidnapping of his daughter, so he brings back Sunti from the Buddhist sabbatical for back up. The two men run into all sorts of problems. On a mission to track the whereabouts of the Abu Karaf, Hopper and Sunti touch off a gang war during an arms deal turned suddenly bad. Then there is a serious sword fight with a bunch of ninja type thugs in a warehouse. Hopper learns that General Jantapan (Tom Wu) and a cross dressing martial arts expert are the ones responsible for his current troubles, so he heads after them with guns blazing. All the while, Jake Hopper presents the American authorities with a dilemma. Our government is running an operation to free the girls, but Hopper keeps getting in the way. The conclusion to the film looks like it came right out of ""The Matrix,"" as Seagal's character battles for his daughter's life. There are super slow motion arrows and bullets whizzing through the air, bodies suspended in mid jump, millions of rounds of ammunition expended, and even shell casings clattering on the pavement. We even get some sort of super magic fight between a group of Buddhist monks and some Hindu witchdoctor. Sure it sounds ridiculous, but it is entertaining.Compared to Seagal's dreckfest ""The Foreigner,"" ""Belly for the Beast"" is an Oscar candidate. The performances aren't terrible, the action is steady and decently choreographed throughout, and the settings look authentic. Still, I couldn't help but notice a few problems. One concerned the rapidly expanding bulk of Steven Seagal. Fans of the man have long commented on his deteriorating physique, and this problem is fully apparent in the movie. At one point, Seagal's character slides along the floor in order to stay out of sight during a burglary. I laughed heartily at both the expression on his face and the sneaking suspicion that someone just off frame was pulling him on a wire. And that scene where he takes a bottle of water out of the refrigerator! Oh brother! Seagal looked like a television repairman lumbering around the house. Another problem centers on some of the illogical plot problems. For instance, why did the CIA guy help Hopper get out of jail? His orders were to keep Seagal's character out of the way, which a short stint in the stir would have accomplished. But there's the CIA guy watching him walk off. It probably has something to do with Hopper being too cool to keep under lock and key because he's SEAGAL. Hear him roar!If you're interested, the extras on the disc consist of a bunch of trailers for films like ""Returner,"" ""The Foreigner,"" ""Belly of the Beast,"" and ""Out for a Kill."" While this film cannot compare to early Steven Seagal actioners, it does stand on its own as a rather decent flick. It's derivative, full of action film cliches, and tries to pass off an overweight fifty year old as a spry intelligence operative full of take no prisoners bravado, but what else were you expecting? By the way, did you hear they are thinking about making ""Under Siege 3""? Hopefully, Seagal will shed some pounds before starring in that one.",4,Not bad for later stage Seagal,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,5566,"['late', '1980s', 'early', '1990', 'looked', 'Seagal',

He is about to retire from the CIA, when he gets news that his daughter has been kid napped by the terrorist group Abu Karaf, when he is Hawaii. He goes down to Thailand when his daughter was abducted and visits some of his old friends in the CIA or that were in the CIA. There is betrayal, and seduction in this movie. In my opinion, this was like Under Seige except a lower budget. Stevens fighting sequences are the best! Its like when he was 10 years younger! He does still look a little big, but you can tell he lost weight for this movie!I was happy to see a lot of American actors in this movie. Out for a Kill had only 2 or 3 americans. This had many many more. Steven and his actors did a really good job. The scenery was better and not cheap looking like in Out for a Kill. You can tell that the budget was much more. I would say 2 or 3 times the amount of Out for a Kill. The director Ching Sui Tung did an awsome job of directing. I was very pleased with his work. If steven is going to make another movie in Thailand, I hope it is with him. The action was more real and the violence was bloodier! This movie will give his carier a boost for sure.

494817,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000006PAB,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","""Belly of the Beast"" is my favorite Steven Seagal DTV movie. As a matter of fact, it even ranks up there with my all-time favorite work he's done. Traditionally,Urban Justiceis regarded as the man's top non-theatrical film, but among fans, this one's generally placed high on the list, too, for a number of reasons...the foremost of which is that this bright, lively movie was released during an era when the rest of Seagal's offerings were characterized by mundane storylines, dreary production values, and lackluster action scenes. For all of its faults, ""Belly of the Beast"" was and is a breath of fresh air for Seagalogists who'd grown tired of the repetitious action-thrillers he cranked out three-at-a-time during this period; it supports the hope that when given the right resources, even this aging action star can surprise you.The story: when the daughter of ex-CIA agent Jake Hopper (Seagal) is kidnapped while vacationing in Thailand, he employs the help of his old ex-partner-turned-monk (Byron Mann,Crying Freeman) to take on the vast political, physical, and spiritual odds standing in his way.While ""Belly of the Beast"" can't quite be called a Hong Kong movie, it comes awful close with the legendary Siu-Tung Ching (Chinese Ghost Story) in the director's chair. While the abundant action content is definitely in the mold of Asian cinema, the high production values are more in western taste...for the better. There's a bit of dubbing of Seagal's voice and some unnecessary flashbacks, but by and by, the movie is colorful and well-made enough to have qualified for a limited theatrical release, in my opinion. Be prepared for the film's staggering weirdness level, though: ""Belly of the Beast"" is legendary among fans not only for the convoluted storyline, but for all of the razor-nailed transvestites and evil wizards running around the place. You wouldn't think by looking at the cover that an entire subplot of the film involves an evil general (Tom Wu,Mutant Chronicles) and a creepy demon-worshipper attempting to trounce Jake with black magic, would you? However, with the exception of the single most awkward love angle Seagal has with a Thai girl about thirty years his junior (Monica Lo,Legacy), these weirdo aspects of the film help distinguish it coolly from literally every other film the man has done...not to mention that they fit the resume of director Ching, a connoisseur of weirdness himself.While Seagal's action scenes had occasionally been wrangled by Asian choreographers in the past (e.g. Dion Lam forExit Wounds, Xin Xin Xiong forHalf Past Dead), director and wire-fu guru Ching was the first to design pure, undiluted Hong Kong-style fight scenes for the Buddhist Bonecrusher, to grand effect. Admittedly, some of these take a turn for the absurd when it becomes clear that most of the acrobatic moves on Jake's behalf are performed by a stunt double who looks about 80 pounds lighter than Seagal, but the action is so out-the-window insane that it's impossible not to be entertained by the countless flips, spins, throws, and mid-air kicks. The best example of blatant doubling being forgivable on grounds of sheer coolness is when Jake engages the aforementioned magic-enforced general with swords and spears, even slicing an arrow that was shot at him in half. Ironically, this may very well be the worst physical shape Seagal had ever been in, but he's quick and serviceable when it's clearly him doing his own moves. A shootout to end all shootouts in a train yard further shows off Ching's unique style. I was a bit disappointed that Byron Mann didn't get into more of the fisticuffs, but he makes the most of his limited brawls and therefore remains one of Seagal's cooler cinematic sidekicks.Will this movie silence the critics and become their favorite martial arts movie?

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[1, 2]","If you ever had the morbid curiosity or even the love of Seagal films, then this entry should get a few laughs.Seagal is now firmly in straight to DVD territory, now over 50 and with an ever-expanding face.  He's getting paid quite well to make the same film over and over and over again, now with Asian directors and other assorted action hacks who are experienced at making the same film over and over and over again.The story, plot, etc, are totally irrelevant.  This one takes place mostly in Thailand, and looks to have been photographed there, so we have exotic locations as one drawing point.  However, you may have difficulty figuring out where the action is happening because the direction and editing are appalling--the film is borderline incomprehensible, and probably for the better.As for the action, it's quite funny.  Seagal nows seems firmly dedicated to avoiding any and all stunts except for very amusing shots of him sliding across the floor (being pulled by wire hoisted by at least four men, I bet) or a quick tumble in the frame.  The action scenes are all the same.  A lot of constipated closeups of Seagal grunting, squatting, and moving his hands around martial-arts style that, though probably just a bit theatrical, is downright funny.  People fly through the air like Crouching Tiger, making a lot of faces before being dispatched by Seagal, or rather his stuntman.  The violence is not the brutal, wrist-snapping, bone-crunching spectacles of his American films, which seem like masterpieces of cinema compared to this, but rather the more fluid, theatrical fight scenes of a Jackie Chan, except everybody (presumably) dies after being sliced, smacked, and thrown through walls and other convenient pieces of the set.  And there's always a nod towards Seagal's ridiculous ego and absurdity, which he is apparently unaware of.  Go ahead and count the number of times Seagal's character is shown in a fight scene with his head cut out, followed by a closeup of Seagal, followed by a shot of his 'character' flying through the air, which only heavy duty wires could accomplish even if it was Seagal.Seagal would actually be perfect for an hourly TV show like this, sort of a Walker Texas Ranger show with international spies as the gimmick.  Your TV may have difficulty accomodating the countless closeups of Seagal's bloated, tanned face, but it would be good fun and many chuckles on a weekly basis.Only die-hard and extremely morbid Seagal fans need apply to this one.  There is too much to talk about here, from the cheap titilation to the absolutely unacceptable hints of a Seagal love-scene, with a Thai prostitute of all people.  Oh, and don't forget the Buddhist sub-plot.

After being disappointed by The Foreigner(which was ok but needed a better script and more action) and Out For A Kill(which I can not bring myself to like), Seagal is back on the right path with this entry. It's by no means a match for any of his early titles like Out For Justice, Marked For Death or Under Siege and he plays the same character as all his other movies but its enjoyable for what it is. He uses a different style of martial arts than his normal style and his body double, if he can be called that as he is half the fatness of Seagal, is evident in many scenes. The action set pieces made up of a lot of gun play are over the top but then a Seagal film is not meant to be taken seriously. A very enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half. If he wants to continue in the movie business and have a bit of respectability then he first needs to lose some weight and secondly he needs to start saying his lines properly and not have him being redubbed by some bad voice over actor. He is over weight and very obviously so in this movie but saying it's because he is over 50 is no excuse. Look at other actors when they were in there 50's, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charles Bronson who didn't hit the big time until he was 54 in 1974 with Death Wish and in some cases these actors stayed in good shape well into there 60's and 70's. To compare with Seagal's other recent releases this is as good as Half Past Dead and much much better than The Foreigner and Out For A Kill. Non Seagal fans should find something in this to enjoy so long as they don't expect to much and Belly Of The Beast is a must for all Seagal fans.",4,His best movie in a long time.

Steve plays an ex-CIA agent who has to jump back in action after a ten year......oh, hell, who cares?  It's Seagal being Seagal, who gives a rat's behind if he's ex-CIA, a cop, a SEAL, a cook, a dance instructor, etc?  In this film he gets bit by the Bronson bug as his daughter is kidnapped by terrorists in Thailand.  He teams up with an old CIA buddy turned monk(actually a very cool character that upstages Seagal), and go on your typical B action film rampage to get his daughter back.  You get the bad techno music, the good guy who's really the bad guy, Seagal's irritating way of cocking his head from side to side when he speaks, the gang of thugs who start a fight with Seagal in a bar(or in this case a dance club)for no real reason other than to show another Seagal action sequence.  And speaking of Seagal action sequences, the process of film editing has become Seagal's best friend as it tries to hide his lack of physical speed.  This is done by speeding up the film when needed as well as going into slow motion.  By the climax of the film a supernatural element is thrown in at the last minute in the form of a Steven Seagal voodoo doll!  The final fight scene has Seagal and villian shooting at one another(Seagal with gun, villian with bow) in a hallway and it's done with that crappy Matrix ""bullet time"" technique.

We know his hero's uniform, the cowboy boots, black slacks, knees with a history, torso like bullet-proofing under a vaguely Asian looking shirt, face like a Noh mask in canvass.  But he always brings his personal more as well, such as his respect for other cultures, his learning their phrases and gestures of common courtesy; cool, if often ill-fated artworks on the appropriate sets; opportunities for young talents; international casting; in Belly of the Beast a good part of the film concerns the afterlife and various believers in same, and it's a very well done part of the film. While Seagal remains the usa standard, this is a movie in a Hong Kong tradition. Stunt doubles are clearly used, editing tricks abound, wires are unashamedly celebrated all in the belief that Storytelling can absorb it all. Of course, it can or there wouldn't be storytelling and the Chinese ought to know, they entered ancient history telling stories still worth telling.  From Hong Kong it's always been a question of can the editors, cinematographers, director, etc somehow make the huge collaboration a story the audience will want to follow. Movie stars help a lot in this. Belly of the Beast is very well directed and edited, it is good storytelling, moves right along, the props and contrivances fitting right in. Seagal has more than his usual number of good lines, plenty of hand-to-hand scenes and a handgun or two  that would probably melt the hands behind so many multiple murders.

494826,A2UDYL0ITJ3Y17,B000006PAB,the kung fu kid,"[5, 7]","This movie started off well with Steven Seagal (as a CIA agent) and his partner trying to make a deal with a mafia gang to lay off of a certain territory.  As they conclude the deal WHAMM we're given our first action scene, one that's done with minimal trickery and lots of speed, technique, broken glass and furniture.  This is what one hopes for from a Steven Seagal picture, real use of authentic aikido techniques (or at least techniques enhanced for the cinema but still based on real fighting methods).  Next guns are fired and Seagal's partner kills an innocent woman bystander in front of her child.  Another bystander sees this and retaliates by shooting the partner.  Further chaos ensues as Seagal steps in and shoots that man.  This scene contains real pathos and confusion and is a great example of how violence can beget violence and how innocent people can get caught in the middle with those firing no longer knowing who they're shooting at.  It is unforunate that after such a strong opening segment the film quickly spirals downhill, once again showing Steven Seagal the lazy actor mumbling his way along another uninspired script when not grimacing and frowning during slow motion shootouts that overstay their welcome or posing with tai chi hands beforefights not geared to his particular talents.  The story itself, which later involves Seagal's attempts to rescue his daughter and her friend from terrorist kidnappers, is uninvolving because we are never properly introduced to the characters as real people we can care for.  They are merely there to create reasons for action (an evil priest is thrown in the mix as a major bad guy, but the whole time one thinks, ""who is this guy, and where did he come from?"".  Seagal especially walks through his role and even sounds like he's been dubbed by someone else during one scene.  Maybe he didn't feel like going back and doing it himself or maybe it is him and he just didn't care.  A lot of his recent releases have him dub his voice later on and he simply sounds bored.The director/action director is one of the all-time best choreographers around (see DUEL TO THE DEATH or THE SWORD), but Seagal is not the ideal performer for showcasing said director's highly stylized (and often high flying) type of action.  Instead of showing Seagal as an expert in Aikido, the style he is best identified with, performing moves that he can do effectively and that work in real life situations when done as such, the director chooses to insert obvious doubles doing jumping spin kicks and 360 degree leg sweeps that are the opposite of the simple but effective style Seagal has chosen to practice.  This juxtaposition of Seagal and double, and more importantly of aikido and wushu, takes away from the enjoyment of the action as our eyes are jarred away from the real Seagal to the double and back.  I have nothing against stunt doubles, in fact I would much rather watch a highly skilled stuntman perform a daring stunt than an actor who isn't as skilled do a pale imitation (or even worse a suspense lacking computer generation) in his place, but Seagal has created a persona that must be adhered to.  He is known for his joint locks and circular motion takedowns from the art of Aikido and that is what originally attracted, and still attracts, his fans.  There are still tons of moves to work with from this art form.  Fans of Seagal became fans because they saw him use these simple techniques that a regular guy (not too muscular, not a kung fu prodigy, not even the most athletic) can do.  It would serve him (and his fans) well if he would go back to those basics, and by this I don't mean simply repeating them. If he is given a plausible script that makes sense and tells a story involving a man of his age, size, and skill then we would once again have a hero to look up to.  I for one would be much more inspired by seeing an overweight 50 something year old man kick butt with moves that are actually possible and effective for people of that age and size than to see someone often ineffectively doubled who always wins just because the script says so.  Get back to the basic foundations of your success Steven Seagal, new but still real Aikido based moves for regular guys who want a hero to inspire them not a hero who tires them.  The art of Aikido is inexhaustible so don't exhaust yourself doing what you don't do best.  The only redeeming qualities of this film are that some of the other fighters do perform some nice movements and now and then the old Seagal is allowed to strut his Aikido stuff.  He just isn't allowed to strut it enough.  For hardcore Seagal fans only.",2,Not A Good Showcase for Seagal,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,4652,"['movie', 'started', 'off', 'well', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'CIA', 'agent', 'partner', 'trying', 'make', 'deal', 'mafia', 'gang', 'lay', 'certain', 'territory', 'conclude', 'deal', 'WHAMM', ""'re"", 'given', 'first', 'action', 'scene', 'one', 'done', 'minimal', 'trickery', 'lots', 'speed', 'technique', 'broken', 'glass', 'furniture', 'what', 'one', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'picture', 'real', 'use', 'authentic', 'aikido', 'techniques', 'least', 'techniques', 'enhanced', 'cinema', 'still', 'based', 'real', 'fighting', 'methods', 'Next', 'guns', 'are', 'fired', 'Seagal', 'partner', 'innocent', 'woman', 'bystander', 'front', 'child', 'bystander', 'shooting', 'partner', 'Further', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Seagal', 'steps', 'shoots', 'man', 'scene', 'real', 'pathos', 'confusion', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'violence', 'can', 'beget', 'violence', 'how', 'innocent', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'middle', 'firing', 'no', 'longer', 'knowing', 'who', ""'re"", 'shooting', 'unforunate', 'strong', 'opening', 'segment', 'film', 'quickly', 'spirals', 'downhill', 'once', 'again', 'showing', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'lazy', 'actor', 'mumbling', 'way', 'uninspired', 'script', 'when', 'not', 'grimacing', 'frowning', 'slow', 'motion', 'shootouts', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'posing', 'tai', 'chi', 'hands', 'beforefights', 'not', 'geared', 'particular', 'talents', 'story', 'later', 'Seagal', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'friend', 'terrorist', 'kidnappers', 'uninvolving', 'are', 'never', 'properly', 'introduced', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'can', 'care', 'are', 'merely', 'there', 'create', 'reasons', 'action', 'evil', 'priest', 'thrown', 'mix', 'major', 'bad', 'guy', 'whole', 'time', 'one', 'who', 'guy', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'Seagal', 'especially', 'role', 'even', 'sounds', 'been', 'dubbed', 'someone', 'else', 'one', 'scene', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'going', 'back', 'doing', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'lot', 'recent', 'releases', 'have', 'dub', 'voice', 'later', 'simply', 'bored.The', 'director/action', 'director', 'one', 'all-time', 'best', 'choreographers', 'see', 'DUEL', 'TO', 'THE', 'DEATH', 'THE', 'SWORD', 'Seagal', 'not', 'ideal', 'performer', 'showcasing', 'said', 'director', 'highly', 'stylized', 'often', 'high', 'flying', 'type', 'action', 'Instead', 'showing', 'Seagal', 'expert', 'Aikido', 'style', 'best', 'identified', 'performing', 'moves', 'can', 'do', 'effectively', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'when', 'done', 'such', 'director', 'insert', 'obvious', 'doubles', 'doing', 'jumping', 'spin', 'kicks', '360', 'degree', 'leg', 'are', 'opposite', 'simple', 'effective', 'style', 'Seagal', 'chosen', 'practice', 'juxtaposition', 'Seagal', 'double', 'more', 'importantly', 'aikido', 'wushu', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'action', 'eyes', 'are', 'jarred', 'away', 'real', 'Seagal', 'double', 'back', 'have', 'nothing', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'fact', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'highly', 'skilled', 'stuntman', 'perform', 'daring', 'stunt', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'as', 'skilled', 'do', 'pale', 'imitation', 'even', 'worse', 'suspense', 'lacking', 'computer', 'generation', 'place', 'Seagal', 'created', 'persona', 'must', 'be', 'adhered', 'known', 'joint', 'locks', 'circular', 'motion', 'takedowns', 'art', 'Aikido', 'what', 'originally', 'attracted', 'still', 'attracts', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'tons', 'moves', 'work', 'art', 'form', 'Fans', 'Seagal', 'became', 'fans', 'saw', 'use', 'simple', 'techniques', 'regular', 'guy', 'not', 'too', 'muscular', 'not', 'kung', 'fu', 'prodigy', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'athletic', 'can', 'do', 'would', 'serve', 'fans', 'well', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'basics', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'simply', 'repeating', 'given', 'plausible', 'script', 'sense', 'story', 'involving', 'man', 'age', 'size', 'skill', 'then', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'hero', 'look', 'up', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'inspired', 'seeing', 'overweight', '50', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'butt', 'moves', 'are', 'actually', 'possible', 'effective', 'people', 'age', 'size', 'see', 'someone', 'often', 'ineffectively', 'doubled', 'who', 'always', 'just', 'script', 'so', 'Get', 'back', 'basic', 'foundations', 'success', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'new', 'still', 'real', 'Aikido', 'based', 'moves', 'regular', 'guys', 'who', 'want', 'hero', 'inspire', 'not', 'hero', 'who', 'art', 'Aikido', 'inexhaustible', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'exhaust', 'doing', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'best', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'other', 'fighters', 'do', 'perform', 'nice', 'movements', 'now', 'then', 'old', 'Seagal', 'allowed', 'strut', 'Aikido', 'stuff', 'just', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'strut', 'enough', 'hardcore', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'only']",Belly of the Beast

494828,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000006PAB,trebe,"[1, 1]","Steven Seagal returns to the far East, in Belly of the Beast (2003), another direct to video release.  Seagal is Jake Hopper, an ex-CIA agent living in Honolulu.  When his daughter Jessica and a US senator's daughter are kidnapped by a terrorist group in Thailand, Hopper heads overseas to see what he can do.Hopper teams up with his former partner Sunti (Byron Mann), who gives up his vows as a monk to lend a hand.  Hopper tries to get some leads from another pal Fitch (Vincent Riotta) who runs a night club.  Lulu (Monica Lo), one of the club's hostesses, becomes a new friend.  The situation is complicated, and Hopper's investigations disturb the plans of those involved.The film has a mostly serious tone, with very few intentional laughs.  Seagal is man on a mission, in this pretty straightforward adventure.  There is lots of gunplay, but also a good deal of martial arts featuring Asian weapons.  The metaphysical elements that are introduced at the end were perhaps intended more for Seagal's Asian audience.Director Siu-Tung Ching employs the usual tricks to make Seagal look good.  Quick cutting, shooting from the rear, speeding up and slowing down the action, zooming in really tight, and using doubles.  Who knows how much is actually Seagal any more?  Some of the fights look strange, but they often give the illusion that you saw, what you were intended to see.  One would think that an unarmed man facing an opponent with a samurai sword would at least lose a limb or two, but not so here.  Head baddie General Jantapan (Tom Wu) is lightning fast, built like a tank, and a weapons expert, but with the gods on Hopper's side, he is doomed to failure.  Byron Mann does pretty well when given the chance, and his character is shown appropriate respect at the end of the film.Belly of the Beast provides what most would probably expect from a Seagal film, at this point in his career.  There's action and gratuitous violence, but the story does seem to matter, and holds together well enough.  There's plenty of bad acting all around, which kind of elevates Seagal's performance.  And the Asian setting is a change from the cold European locations of some of his other films around this time.

494829,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000006PAB,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","'Belly of the Beast' is clearly improvement compared with  Seagal's past two films done by Michael Oblovitz (who seems to have no sense of coherence), but still is far from his best.  Though I only give 'JUST OK' 2 stars, however, the film has its own merits, and perhaps die-hard fans of him would welcome this one heartily.  And those good things are its director and Seagal's sidekick.Steven Seagal goes back to his origin in a sense, for he plays an ex-CIA man Jake Hopper, whose daughter is kidnapped by a radical religious group in Thailand, and they demand that unless certain members of their group in jail are released, the daughter will be killed.  The scene is uncannily (and perhaps unintentionally) reminds of the recent incidents in Iraq.But Jake, or Seagal, is a man who deals with the situation single-handedly, and he again does so.  With a help from his former buddy Sunti, he fights against the villains who attack them with guns, swords, and deadly fingernails (Not kidding).Proably avid fans of Hong-Kong films know it, but the director Ching Siu Tung is famous for his groundbreaking action scenes in 'Chinese Ghost Stories' and most recently 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers.'  His rather unique action style is the one merit of the film, though Seagal, unlike Jet Li, is not ready for the task.Yes, fans, please admit it.  The use of double (who is much thinner) in action sequences is too clear, and the contrast between Seagal himself and the stunt is glaringly conspicous.  He needs shape-up, and that has been said by many for these three years, but he is not listening to them.Still, the film has another great thing in it: Byron Mann as Seagal's sidekick.  Unlike someone else, he can act, and shows considerable skills for action.  I will not be surpised if I see a film starring him, even though you have not heard his name yet.  Check him out.The location in Thailand (where movie industry is growing) is a good choice, and considering the derivative plot and still bad acting of Seagal, the film is pretty entertaining.  Still, my advice is, Rent it before you buy it.",2,"(In Fact 2.5) Improved Seagal Film, But Still Needs Shape-up",1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,2105,"[""'Belly"", 'Beast', 'clearly', 'improvement', 'compared', 'Seagal', 'past', 'two', 'films', 'done', 'Michael', 'Oblovitz', 'who', 'have', 'sense', 'coherence', 'still', 'far', 'best', 'only', 'give', 'OK', '2', 'stars', 'however', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'perhaps', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'would', 'welcome', 'one', 'heartily', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'director', 'Seagal', 'sidekick.Steven', 'Seagal', 'back', 'origin', 'sense', 'ex-CIA', 'man', 'Jake', 'Hopper', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'radical', 'religious', 'group', 'Thailand', 'demand', 'certain', 'members', 'group', 'jail', 'are', 'released', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'scene', 'uncannily', 'perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'reminds', 'recent', 'incidents', 'Iraq.But', 'Jake', 'Seagal', 'man', 'who', 'situation', 'single-handedly', 'again', 'so', 'help', 'former', 'buddy', 'Sunti', 'villains', 'who', 'attack', 'guns', 'swords', 'deadly', 'fingernails', 'Not', 'kidding', '.Proably', 'avid', 'fans', 'Hong-Kong', 'films', 'know', 'director', 'Ching', 'Siu', 'Tung', 'famous', 'groundbreaking', 'action', 'scenes', ""'Chinese"", 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'most', 'recently', ""'House"", 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'rather', 'unique', 'action', 'style', 'one', 'merit', 'film', 'Seagal', 'Jet', 'Li', 'not', 'ready', 'task.Yes', 'fans', 'please', 'admit', 'use', 'double', 'who', 'much', 'thinner', 'action', 'sequences', 'too', 'clear', 'contrast', 'Seagal', 'stunt', 'glaringly', 'conspicous', 'shape-up', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'listening', 'them.Still', 'film', 'great', 'thing', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'Seagal', 'sidekick', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'act', 'considerable', 'skills', 'action', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surpised', 'see', 'film', 'starring', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'name', 'yet', 'Check', 'out.The', 'location', 'Thailand', 'where', 'movie', 'industry', 'growing', 'good', 'choice', 'considering', 'derivative', 'plot', 'still', 'bad', 'acting', 'Seagal', 'film', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'Still', 'advice', 'Rent', 'buy']",Belly of the Beast

He had to lose a lot of weight to get this role or else Warner Bros wouldn't take him back. After his comeback, his movies have involved a lot of martial arts stunts that are not performed by Seagal himself. Good examples are: Into the Sun, Out of Reach, Half Past Dead and this one. Although you see Seagal performing some Karate kicks here, you can clearly see it is not him performing those martial arts stunts. Because not even in his prime he performed those Karate kicks.

Plus, I am very concerned for Seagal's health -- he is not looking well, and it's more than just the weight gain.  Listen to his voice.The fight scenes are okay, and there are more of them than normally found, but it's Seagal's sidekick (Byron Man), who, to me, really steals the show.  He's a likeable, tragic character, and the actor portraying him obviously has some martial arts background.Otherwise, just a fair outing, the kind that Van Damme's films have become.  Personally, I think both actors could make a great comeback if they would find a better vehicle and, possibly, get back into better shape.  I admire & respect Seagal's abilities -- I remember watching his earlier films and the beauty of his Aikido -- but it seems like he's not trying anymore.UPDATE - In retrospect, I was a little hard on this film the first time around.  I only gave it another look because Outlaw Vern pointed out some good things in a review, and upon a second viewing found I actually enjoyed this one.  In fact, I've watched it many times since and will buy it on Blu-ray when it becomes available in a few months.  While it's still not a great movie, I keep coming back to it for reasons I can't explain.  Maybe my standards have dropped as low as Seagal's and I've been fooled into thinking it's a better movie, I don't know.  I put it right up there with Urban Justice.",3,Another Disappointment from Seagal (Updated 4/23/2011),1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,1486,"['film', 'certainly', 'better', 'last', 'two', 'direct-to-DVD', 'offerings', 'Belly', 'Beast', 'still', 'let', 'down', 'am', 'very', 'concerned', 'Seagal', 'health', 'not', 'looking', 'well', 'more', 'just', 'weight', 'gain', 'Listen', 'voice.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'okay', 'are', 'more', 'normally', 'found', 'Seagal', 'sidekick', 'Byron', 'Man', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'likeable', 'tragic', 'character', 'actor', 'portraying', 'obviously', 'martial', 'arts', 'background.Otherwise', 'just', 'fair', 'outing', 'kind', 'Van', 'Damme', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'Personally', 'think', 'actors', 'could', 'make', 'great', 'comeback', 'would', 'find', 'better', 'vehicle', 'possibly', 'get', 'back', 'better', 'shape', 'admire', 'respect', 'Seagal', 'abilities', 'remember', 'watching', 'earlier', 'films', 'beauty', 'Aikido', 'not', 'trying', 'anymore.UPDATE', 'retrospect', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'gave', 'look', 'Outlaw', 'Vern', 'pointed', 'out', 'good', 'things', 'review', 'second', 'viewing', 'found', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'will', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'when', 'available', 'few', 'months', 'still', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Maybe', 'standards', 'have', 'dropped', 'as', 'low', 'Seagal', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'better', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'put', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Urban', 'Justice']",Belly of the Beast
