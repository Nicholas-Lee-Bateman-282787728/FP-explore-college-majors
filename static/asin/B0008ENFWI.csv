898496,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0008ENFWI,Alex Udvary,"[5, 6]","""Swimming Upstream"" did not play in Chicago, but I know it did receive a limited run in New York. I recall reading Stephen Holden's review in the New York Times. But what a shame that a movie as good as this one did not have a theatrical run. It is the second movie I have seen this year that has went straight to video, the other was ""Not on the Lips"". And I just don't understand it. Both movies have a talented cast. In this movies case Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis. They both have ""A"" list production values, smart scripts and yet for some reasons the studios decided they didn't want to make money with these movies.This is not to imply ""Swimming Upstream"" would have been number one at the box-office. I seriously doubt it. It would have done mininal business at best. But at least then it would have been up for Oscar consideration. I know a movie has to play in New York and L.A. to earn an Oscar nomination but I'm not sure if there are stipulations has to how long it has to play or if a certain amount of time must pass before it is on DVD. This would be sad if Rush and Davis could not be nominated.""Swimming Upstream"" is based on the true story of Tony Fingleton (Jesse Spencer) and his dreams of becoming an Olympic champ and the realities of life with a harsh uncaring father, Harold (Rush).The movie is based on Fingleton's book which he co-wrote with his sister Diane, but adapted on his own for this screenplay.Knowing this you can tell the movie seems sincere. A lot of the moments seem to reflect real life, while others I must admit reflect ""movie life"".Tony has been ignored by his father all of his life. At first his father didn't notice him because he was not good at sports, like his old man who was, according to him, a great football player. Instead young Tony enjoys playing the piano, mostly the minute waltz, and swimming. One day Harold takes his children, five children; four boys and one girl, to the local swimming pool and there he notices two of his son's talent for swimming. So he trains Tony and John (Tim Draxl) to compete in various contest, and they win. But Harold clearly has high plans for John. Tony is an after thought. The movie then becomes about Tony's struggle to overcome his father.Isn't it odd, given this story-line that Geoffrey Rush is playing the dad. If you remember he won the Academy Award for the movie ""Shine"" about a young boy who is pushed into piano contests by his dominating father. Now it is Rush's turn to play the brute father.The film has a lot of suspense working in the swimming scenes, or at least I was caught up in the moments. A split screen is used when we watch these scenes and for it created a excitment that wouldn't have been had it been shot the more conventional way. Because we can see what it means not only to John and Tony to win but we can also see what is means to Dora (Davis) and Harold.If people will actually give the movie a chance, they might enjoy it. ""Swimming Upstream"" has some good acting, in my opinion it is Oscar caliber. And should not go unseen by the public.Bottom-line: Enjoyable, if maybe at times too sentimental, story of a real life swimming champion. Rush and Davis have some good moments on-screen.",4,The Swimming Pool,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,3215,"['Swimming', 'Upstream', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'Chicago', 'know', 'did', 'receive', 'limited', 'run', 'New', 'York', 'recall', 'reading', 'Stephen', 'Holden', 'review', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'what', 'shame', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'theatrical', 'run', 'second', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'other', 'was', 'Not', 'Lips', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movies', 'have', 'talented', 'cast', 'movies', 'case', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'have', 'A', 'list', 'production', 'values', 'smart', 'scripts', 'yet', 'reasons', 'studios', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'money', 'movies.This', 'not', 'imply', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'one', 'box-office', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'mininal', 'business', 'best', 'least', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'know', 'movie', 'play', 'New', 'York', 'L.A.', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'stipulations', 'how', 'long', 'play', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'must', 'pass', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'sad', 'Rush', 'Davis', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'nominated', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'Olympic', 'champ', 'realities', 'life', 'harsh', 'uncaring', 'father', 'Harold', 'Rush', '.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Fingleton', 'book', 'sister', 'Diane', 'adapted', 'own', 'screenplay.Knowing', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'sincere', 'lot', 'moments', 'seem', 'reflect', 'real', 'life', 'others', 'must', 'admit', 'reflect', 'movie', 'life', '.Tony', 'been', 'ignored', 'father', 'life', 'first', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'sports', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'according', 'great', 'football', 'player', 'Instead', 'young', 'Tony', 'playing', 'piano', 'mostly', 'minute', 'waltz', 'swimming', 'One', 'day', 'Harold', 'children', 'five', 'children', 'four', 'boys', 'one', 'girl', 'local', 'swimming', 'pool', 'two', 'son', 'talent', 'swimming', 'Tony', 'John', 'Tim', 'Draxl', 'compete', 'various', 'contest', 'win', 'Harold', 'clearly', 'high', 'plans', 'John', 'Tony', 'thought', 'movie', 'then', 'Tony', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'father.Is', ""n't"", 'odd', 'given', 'story-line', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'playing', 'dad', 'remember', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'Shine', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'pushed', 'piano', 'contests', 'dominating', 'father', 'Now', 'Rush', 'turn', 'play', 'brute', 'father.The', 'film', 'lot', 'suspense', 'working', 'swimming', 'scenes', 'least', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'moments', 'split', 'screen', 'used', 'when', 'watch', 'scenes', 'created', 'excitment', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'conventional', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'John', 'Tony', 'win', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'what', 'Dora', 'Davis', 'Harold.If', 'people', 'will', 'actually', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'good', 'acting', 'opinion', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'unseen', 'public.Bottom-line', 'Enjoyable', 'maybe', 'times', 'too', 'sentimental', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'swimming', 'champion', 'Rush', 'Davis', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'on-screen']",N/A
898497,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0008ENFWI,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Swimming and writing poetry share one important characteristic; both activities can be richly satisfying to the practitioner while providing little, if any, spectator appeal.  This limitation delivers a crippling blow to Swimming Upstream - without the obligatory water-churning competitions all that remains is a collection of drunken rampages and psychological tortures meted out by a deranged and permanently crippled father (Geoffrey Rush).The film rests entirely on Rush's shoulders, and he is an amazing talent, well equal to the task.  This is a man submerged in his own tortured world, incapable of asking for help or providing comfort.  Instead, he revisits the cruelties and illnesses of his own childhood onto his children, passing them down like prized heirlooms.  The father is an interesting character, and Rush owns him, unfortunately the screenwriter apparently dropped the scenes that might cause our perception of him to expand beyond pure loathing into some sort of understanding, if not sympathy.Judy Davis, certainly one of the best actresses working today, wrestles with her Australian accent but offers a typically excellent performance.  She has the unenviable chore of providing care for the children despite her husband's seeming determination to undermine her at every turn.  Davis inhabits a doomed universe, and it is possible to see the life force draining right out of her.  Despite her maternal commitment, despair is never too far away.Superimposed on this dark canvas is a chirpy tale about a nice looking kid who wins a swim meet, goes to an Ivy League school, and gets a job on a hit TV show.  It's such a spunky little parable that it actually has the nerve to ask, ""If you do well for the wrong reason, if you struggle for the approval of somebody who will never give it to you and end up getting pretty good at something in process, is that such a bad thing, really?""There is a scene where Tony (Jesse Spencer) is showing his medal to a blind drunk dad, spilling the beans, saying all the things these Stoic, macho Aussie men haven't said throughout the picture.  (It's probably the performance that got him his job on House.)  Tony is crying, dad is lurching, glassy-eyed like a bloated beast from the underworld.  If at that moment Tony had used the medal to carve his name into dad's forehead - backwards - just so dad was reminded which son was the best swimmer every time he looked in the mirror - then maybe, just maybe, you would have something.  As it is, what you've got is Disney directing 120 Days at Sodom.",3,Watching Uphill,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,2557,"['Swimming', 'writing', 'poetry', 'share', 'one', 'important', 'characteristic', 'activities', 'can', 'be', 'richly', 'satisfying', 'practitioner', 'providing', 'little', 'spectator', 'appeal', 'limitation', 'crippling', 'blow', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'obligatory', 'water-churning', 'competitions', 'collection', 'drunken', 'rampages', 'psychological', 'tortures', 'meted', 'out', 'deranged', 'permanently', 'crippled', 'father', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', '.The', 'film', 'rests', 'entirely', 'Rush', 'shoulders', 'amazing', 'talent', 'well', 'equal', 'task', 'man', 'submerged', 'own', 'tortured', 'world', 'incapable', 'asking', 'help', 'providing', 'comfort', 'Instead', 'cruelties', 'illnesses', 'own', 'childhood', 'children', 'passing', 'down', 'prized', 'heirlooms', 'father', 'interesting', 'character', 'Rush', 'unfortunately', 'screenwriter', 'apparently', 'dropped', 'scenes', 'might', 'cause', 'perception', 'expand', 'pure', 'loathing', 'sort', 'understanding', 'not', 'sympathy.Judy', 'Davis', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'working', 'today', 'Australian', 'accent', 'typically', 'excellent', 'performance', 'unenviable', 'chore', 'providing', 'care', 'children', 'husband', 'seeming', 'determination', 'undermine', 'turn', 'Davis', 'doomed', 'universe', 'possible', 'see', 'life', 'force', 'draining', 'right', 'maternal', 'commitment', 'despair', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'away.Superimposed', 'dark', 'canvas', 'chirpy', 'tale', 'nice', 'looking', 'kid', 'who', 'swim', 'meet', 'Ivy', 'League', 'school', 'job', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'such', 'spunky', 'little', 'parable', 'actually', 'nerve', 'ask', 'do', 'well', 'wrong', 'reason', 'struggle', 'approval', 'somebody', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'pretty', 'good', 'something', 'process', 'bad', 'thing', 'really', 'scene', 'where', 'Tony', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'showing', 'medal', 'blind', 'drunk', 'dad', 'spilling', 'beans', 'saying', 'things', 'Stoic', 'macho', 'Aussie', 'men', 'have', ""n't"", 'said', 'picture', 'probably', 'performance', 'got', 'job', 'House', 'Tony', 'crying', 'dad', 'lurching', 'glassy-eyed', 'bloated', 'beast', 'underworld', 'moment', 'Tony', 'had', 'used', 'medal', 'carve', 'name', 'dad', 'forehead', 'backwards', 'just', 'so', 'dad', 'was', 'reminded', 'son', 'was', 'best', 'swimmer', 'time', 'looked', 'mirror', 'then', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Disney', 'directing', '120', 'Days', 'Sodom']",N/A
898498,A11ZESNK9JXTHR,B0008ENFWI,Coffee Klatch Reviews,"[4, 4]","Sometimes, success is both caused by and causes great tragedy. That seems to be the case in Swimming Upstream, a biopic based on the life of Anthony (Tony) Fingleton, who won a silver medal in the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and could have been on the Australian team for the '64 olympics, but chose to attend Harvard instead.The older Tony is played by Jesse Spencer, who gives off that wholesome feeling one associates with Cary Elwes or Richard Thomas. (The younger Tony is played by Mitchell Dellevergin.) Tony is the second of five kids in a family that leads an existence forever short of money. His dad, Harold (Geoffrey Rush) is often on strike at the docks, and his mom, Dora (Judy Davis), depends on scraps of overrun fabric and a tab at the local grocery store in order to make ends meet. We learn right at the beginning that life with Dad is completely dependent on his mood and how much he's been drinking. Dad might show some rare affection, but he is just as likely to give you or Mom a quick backhand across the face.As if life with Dad wasn't hard enough, Tony has to deal with an older, bullying brother, played in the younger case by a very frightening Kain O'Keeffe. He is named Harold Jr. after his father, and he inflicts on Tony a miniature version of Dad's abuse. In one scene of sibling jealousy, Harold Jr. slams a piano keyboard cover down on Tony's fingers. When Tony runs out and tells Dad, Dad doesn't punish Harold Jr., but instead has them put on boxing gloves, which, of course, leads to Tony getting double punishment. At this point we are wondering what is going on with Dad. Is he just generally sadistic? Or does he not like Tony specifically? (We will later get hints that something tragic happened in his childhood, perhaps sexual, and that he wasn't strong enough to fight off the ""animals."")Tony's one solace from these abuses is swimming at the local swimming pool with his brother, John, played by Thomas Davidson and Tim Draxl. John is Tony's supporter. John sees Dad's abuse of Tony and says it's not right. John is the one that, during another of Dad's tirades about Tony's being a ""poofter,"" tells Dad that he should come and see them swim, because John knows that Tony really shines in this area.When Dad does come and sees how good Tony is, suddenly Dad becomes interested in their lives. The next day he begins crack of dawn and evening training sessions. Soon they win their first event. This begins a five-year period of their lives where things are going well. They win every event they enter, with John doing the crawl events and Tony doing the backstroke events. The thing is though, John is really the better swimmer. He wins his events by great distances, whereas Tony wins just barely. They keep family peace by having them compete in separate events. That is until Dad begins pitting brother against brother.One day Tony shows up to a meet to find John three lanes down from him. Tony loses his first race ever and this leads to great family conflict. Why couldn't John have just stayed in his own events? It will forever disrupt their once perfect friendship.The rest of the movie, the rest of their lives, is a back and forth between John staying out of Tony's races and sometimes being in them. It is when John stays out that Tony becomes national champion. But it is a great personal sacrifice to John, who sees all the attention Tony is getting in newsreels and from reporters. He had asked Mom before the race, ""Don't you want me to win?"" ""Of course I do,"" she says. ""But I don't want Tony to lose.""So this is the great tragedy of the film and their lives. Only by one brother making a sacrifice does the other brother achieve his dreams. And the biggest tragedy may be the one unstated at the end of the film. We get life updates at the credits. They inform us that Tony graduated from Harvard and lives with his wife and children in America. They inform us that his parents have remained friends. And that is all. There is no update on any other family member. There is no update on John. And it leaves us with the feeling of unspeakable tragedy.",5,Tragedy and Success and Tragedy,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,4128,"['Sometimes', 'success', 'caused', 'great', 'tragedy', 'be', 'case', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'biopic', 'based', 'life', 'Anthony', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'who', 'won', 'silver', 'medal', '1962', 'British', 'Empire', 'Commonwealth', 'Games', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Australian', 'team', ""'64"", 'olympics', 'chose', 'attend', 'Harvard', 'instead.The', 'older', 'Tony', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'who', 'off', 'wholesome', 'feeling', 'one', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'younger', 'Tony', 'played', 'Mitchell', 'Dellevergin', 'Tony', 'second', 'five', 'kids', 'family', 'existence', 'forever', 'short', 'money', 'dad', 'Harold', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'often', 'strike', 'docks', 'mom', 'Dora', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'scraps', 'overrun', 'fabric', 'tab', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'learn', 'right', 'beginning', 'life', 'Dad', 'completely', 'dependent', 'mood', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'drinking', 'Dad', 'might', 'show', 'rare', 'affection', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'give', 'Mom', 'quick', 'backhand', 'face.As', 'life', 'Dad', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'enough', 'Tony', 'deal', 'older', 'bullying', 'brother', 'played', 'younger', 'case', 'very', 'frightening', 'Kain', ""O'Keeffe"", 'named', 'Harold', 'Jr.', 'father', 'Tony', 'miniature', 'version', 'Dad', 'abuse', 'one', 'scene', 'sibling', 'jealousy', 'Harold', 'Jr.', 'piano', 'keyboard', 'cover', 'down', 'Tony', 'fingers', 'When', 'Tony', 'out', 'tells', 'Dad', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'punish', 'Harold', 'Jr.', 'instead', 'put', 'boxing', 'gloves', 'course', 'Tony', 'getting', 'double', 'punishment', 'point', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'Dad', 'just', 'generally', 'sadistic', 'not', 'Tony', 'specifically', 'will', 'later', 'get', 'hints', 'something', 'tragic', 'happened', 'childhood', 'perhaps', 'sexual', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'fight', 'off', 'animals', 'Tony', 'one', 'solace', 'abuses', 'swimming', 'local', 'swimming', 'pool', 'brother', 'John', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Davidson', 'Tim', 'Draxl', 'John', 'Tony', 'supporter', 'John', 'Dad', 'abuse', 'Tony', 'not', 'right', 'John', 'one', 'Dad', 'tirades', 'Tony', 'being', 'poofter', 'Dad', 'should', 'come', 'see', 'swim', 'John', 'Tony', 'really', 'area.When', 'Dad', 'come', 'sees', 'how', 'good', 'Tony', 'suddenly', 'Dad', 'becomes', 'interested', 'lives', 'next', 'day', 'crack', 'dawn', 'evening', 'training', 'sessions', 'Soon', 'win', 'first', 'event', 'five-year', 'period', 'lives', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'win', 'event', 'enter', 'John', 'doing', 'crawl', 'events', 'Tony', 'doing', 'backstroke', 'events', 'thing', 'John', 'really', 'better', 'swimmer', 'events', 'great', 'distances', 'whereas', 'Tony', 'just', 'barely', 'keep', 'family', 'peace', 'having', 'compete', 'separate', 'events', 'Dad', 'pitting', 'brother', 'brother.One', 'day', 'Tony', 'up', 'meet', 'find', 'John', 'three', 'lanes', 'down', 'Tony', 'first', 'race', 'ever', 'great', 'family', 'conflict', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'John', 'have', 'just', 'stayed', 'own', 'events', 'will', 'forever', 'disrupt', 'once', 'perfect', 'friendship.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'rest', 'lives', 'back', 'forth', 'John', 'staying', 'Tony', 'races', 'sometimes', 'being', 'when', 'John', 'out', 'Tony', 'national', 'champion', 'great', 'personal', 'sacrifice', 'John', 'who', 'attention', 'Tony', 'getting', 'newsreels', 'reporters', 'had', 'asked', 'Mom', 'race', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'win', 'course', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Tony', 'lose', 'So', 'great', 'tragedy', 'film', 'lives', 'Only', 'one', 'brother', 'making', 'sacrifice', 'other', 'brother', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'unstated', 'end', 'film', 'get', 'life', 'updates', 'credits', 'inform', 'Tony', 'graduated', 'Harvard', 'wife', 'children', 'America', 'inform', 'parents', 'have', 'remained', 'friends', 'update', 'other', 'family', 'member', 'update', 'John', 'feeling', 'unspeakable', 'tragedy']",N/A

898501,AI54XO5Z755FH,B0008ENFWI,"Drake-by-the-Lake ""movie critic""","[6, 10]","Why a son should strive for the approval of a brutish father with few, if any, redeemable traits is a good question for the psychologists among us. This film is one of many in which an abused, unappreciated, unloved son strives, in vain, throughout his youth for the approval of a strict, distant, cold father. A better strategy would be to nurture indifference and contempt for a father like this one: a bitter, alcoholic, lazy, sometimes violent ogre who has all the charm of a garden slug. This is a terribly unhappy wreck of the nuclear family, with few or no pleasant scenes. The only moral I can take from this movie is that two-parent families really need grandparents, aunts and uncles, or even cousins and friends, living with them, or at least nearby, in order to help make ends meet and to help with the household duties. But such an uncouth barbarian as the father depicted here would probably alienate any supporting relatives. It would have been interesting for the writer to explain how the amiable wife ever was captured by this wretch.I rented this movie just because Judy Davis stars as the wife, delivering an impeccable performance by the way. I really liked her in ""Impromptu"" and another movie which I forget the title of.At twenty plus dollars, this film, like many others, appears over-priced.

898502,A2A0U27BHHWOES,B0008ENFWI,G. Bestick,"[6, 7]","With first-rate performances by two bankable stars and a well-crafted, emotionally honest story line, it's a mystery why this movie blipped so quickly in and out of the theaters.Swimming Upstream is based on the real-life story of Tony Fingleton, a young Australian swimmer, but the film is much more than a feel-good tale of Tony's aquatic triumphs.  It's about the desperate attachments of a dysfunctional family, and in particular, Tony's struggles to win the love and approval of Harold, his emotionally damaged father.Harold (Geoffrey Rush) had a rough childhood during the Depression, and saw too much too soon.  He becomes a hard-drinking dock worker who takes out his resentments on his long-suffering wife Dora (Judy Davis) and their five children.  Harold is particularly tough on Tony (Jesse Spencer).  He won't acknowledge Tony's accomplishments, and takes a particular delight in pitting Tony in competitions against his brothers, especially his brother John, also an accomplished swimmer.With a huge assist from his mother, Tony transmutes the trauma of his home life into a mental toughness that serves him well in school and in the pool.  After winning national championships in Australia, he gets a swimming scholarship to Harvard, and takes himself off to America and a better life.  Tony's major triumph isn't winning swim meets or scholarships, though; it's finding the inner strength to not become bitter and emotionally callous himself.Director Russell Mulcahey serves up engrossing, occasionally wrenching domestic scenes, and injects excitement into the swim meets by focusing on the family tensions the competitions generate - there's so much more at stake for Tony than simply winning a backstroke race.  In lesser hands, the story might have become mawkish, but Rush and Davis in particular deliver beautifully nuanced performances.  Rush gives us reasons to pity a detestable man, and Davis shows us a steely strength that makes Dora more than a victim.This film will hopefully find a second life in the DVD channels and reach the wider audience it deserves.",4,Staying Afloat,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,2086,"['first-rate', 'performances', 'two', 'bankable', 'stars', 'well-crafted', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'story', 'line', 'mystery', 'why', 'movie', 'blipped', 'so', 'quickly', 'theaters.Swimming', 'Upstream', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'young', 'Australian', 'swimmer', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'feel-good', 'tale', 'Tony', 'aquatic', 'triumphs', 'desperate', 'attachments', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'particular', 'Tony', 'struggles', 'win', 'love', 'approval', 'Harold', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'father.Harold', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'had', 'rough', 'childhood', 'Depression', 'saw', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'hard-drinking', 'dock', 'worker', 'who', 'out', 'resentments', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Dora', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'five', 'children', 'Harold', 'particularly', 'tough', 'Tony', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'Tony', 'accomplishments', 'particular', 'delight', 'pitting', 'Tony', 'competitions', 'brothers', 'especially', 'brother', 'John', 'also', 'accomplished', 'swimmer.With', 'huge', 'assist', 'mother', 'Tony', 'trauma', 'home', 'life', 'mental', 'toughness', 'well', 'school', 'pool', 'winning', 'national', 'championships', 'Australia', 'swimming', 'scholarship', 'Harvard', 'off', 'America', 'better', 'life', 'Tony', 'major', 'triumph', ""n't"", 'winning', 'swim', 'meets', 'scholarships', 'finding', 'inner', 'strength', 'not', 'become', 'bitter', 'emotionally', 'callous', 'himself.Director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahey', 'up', 'engrossing', 'occasionally', 'wrenching', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'excitement', 'swim', 'meets', 'focusing', 'family', 'competitions', 'generate', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'stake', 'Tony', 'simply', 'winning', 'backstroke', 'race', 'lesser', 'hands', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'mawkish', 'Rush', 'Davis', 'particular', 'deliver', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Rush', 'reasons', 'pity', 'detestable', 'man', 'Davis', 'steely', 'strength', 'Dora', 'more', 'victim.This', 'film', 'will', 'hopefully', 'find', 'second', 'life', 'DVD', 'channels', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience']",N/A
898503,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0008ENFWI,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","SWIMMING UPSTREAM is a brilliantly acted, deeply involving and ultimately uplifting film from Australia that deserves major audience exposure.  Based on a true story of one of Australia's many championship athletes, this story is not merely another biopic (although it was autobiographically written by Anthony Fingleton, the subject of the film): this is a story about large families of poverty, about the tragedies that befall families husbanded by an alcoholic abusive father, and about the ultimate triumph of the individual soul rising out of such conditions.Harold Fingleton (Geoffrey Rush) is a drunk, a blue collar worker who has sired five children by a strong but enabling wife Dora (Judy Davis), a man whose focus on sports finds a possible escape from his joblessness when he discovers that his two middle sons Tony (Jesse Spencer) and the younger John (Tim Draxl) are able swimmers.  For reasons unclear Harold focuses on John and while he relentlessly coaches both of the boys at the town pool every day, he decides John is going to be the champion swimmer in Australia.  Tony excels in the backstroke and eventually surpasses his beloved brother John's times and proceeds to win the honors Harold expected of John.Throughout this tale of competition in swimming we are privy to the competition within the home.  Harold, Jr (David Hoflin) is initially the bully yet gradually succumbs to his father's alcoholic lifestyle.  Dora is beaten and abused yet is always there for her children, eking out a living and soothing the flare-up tantrums during Harold's drunken states.  Tony and John cycle through periods of mutual adulation and the alternative fierce competition into which they are thrown by their father: their evolving bond is unforgettably touching.  When Tony at last reaches the peak of his swimming potential, winning medals and applause form his countrymen, he still tries to grasp the love of a father whose is so consumed by his own demons that he is unable to acknowledge Tony's success.  Tony's eventual choice of leaving Australia for either the Olympics or for a scholarship to Harvard in the USA provides some of the most touching moments between the various members of this long-suffering family.The direction by Russell Mulcahy is keenly paced, making excellent use of flashbacks to the significant moments in the family's history, and electing to use the split screen technique to underline the tension of the swimming meets while focusing on the faces of the family.  As Tony, Jesse Spencer is both wonderful to watch (he does his own swimming and he is a perfect physical specimen!) and reveals acting gifts that are usually those of more seasoned performers.  Indeed, Rush, Davis and Draxl also give spellbinding performances that are born of nuance and understatement.  In a family where there could be polarization of response from the audience, each of the actors is so fine that we are able to find the complete personas of these disparate people and find warmth and understanding for all of them.One wonders why this film was not heralded in the theatrical release, as it is one of the finer movies to come out in years.  Both Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis give outstanding, award deserving performances.  The DVD includes all of the 'deleted scenes' and it is highly recommended to view these important inexplicably cut moments as they truly enhance the film.  Very Highly Recommended!

To get out of the dregs of the working class in Australia, dockworker is the father, out of a family dominated by an alcoholic father who had too many children, but in those days after the second world war it was the norm, and to do it with glory and fame, that's the objective of Tony. He did it, that young son of that family who liked the piano, who loved swimming but only had his escape in mind, becoming the best in order to get to Harvard on a full scholarship.And he did it for sure. The film insists a lot on the rivalry between the two brothers pushed by the father into swimming, and swimming the same style. The father prefers the other son and gets berserk when it is Tony who wins, and that will precipitate the end. Tony's success provides him with the scholarship he wanted and he can go and swimming becomes an exacting hobby since swimming brought him what he wanted and he does not need it any more. The rivalry between the two brothers is pathetic.The father is a disaster of a father. But the escape of Tony is just an escape and does not bring much sympathy. He just goes away. And he drops the tool he worked on for twelve years or even maybe more once he has reached the object of his desire.Something is missing at the end: I guess real life is not always as much fun as a good film and does not make more than average films.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Harvard the paradise of escapees,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,1458,"['small', 'film', 'Australian', 'family', 'Supposedly', 'real', 'family', 'never', 'know', 'get', 'dregs', 'working', 'class', 'Australia', 'dockworker', 'father', 'family', 'dominated', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'days', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'was', 'norm', 'do', 'glory', 'fame', 'objective', 'Tony', 'did', 'young', 'son', 'family', 'who', 'liked', 'piano', 'who', 'loved', 'swimming', 'only', 'had', 'escape', 'mind', 'becoming', 'best', 'order', 'get', 'Harvard', 'full', 'scholarship.And', 'did', 'sure', 'film', 'lot', 'rivalry', 'two', 'brothers', 'pushed', 'father', 'swimming', 'swimming', 'same', 'style', 'father', 'other', 'son', 'berserk', 'when', 'Tony', 'who', 'will', 'precipitate', 'end', 'Tony', 'success', 'scholarship', 'wanted', 'can', 'go', 'swimming', 'becomes', 'exacting', 'hobby', 'swimming', 'brought', 'what', 'wanted', 'not', 'need', 'more', 'rivalry', 'two', 'brothers', 'pathetic.The', 'father', 'disaster', 'father', 'escape', 'Tony', 'just', 'escape', 'not', 'bring', 'much', 'sympathy', 'just', 'away', 'tool', 'worked', 'twelve', 'years', 'even', 'maybe', 'more', 'once', 'reached', 'object', 'desire.Something', 'missing', 'end', 'guess', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'more', 'average', 'films.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

898509,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0008ENFWI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Tony Fingleton was a champion backstroke swimmer who grew up in Brisbane in the early 1960s.  Whether he became one because or despite of his father is the central question of ""Swimming Upstream,"" a 2003 Australian film directed by Russell Mulcahy.  Fingleton did the screenplay, based on the autobiography he wrote with his sister Diane, so there is no doubt this is the story he wishes to tell.  But I am not sure even he can answer that question definitively one way or the other.Young Tony Fingleton (Mitchell Dellevergin) was a gangly and sickly boy, who liked to play the piano and was ignored by his father, Harold (Geoffrey Rush), who worked on the docks of Brisbane when he was not on strike or drunk.  Harold is an abusive man who alternates between violent rages and coldly threatening silences.  When he fights with his wife, Dora (Judy Davis), their four sons and only daughter know to go hide in their rooms or head out for the neighborhood swimming pool.  The oldest son is named for his father and encouraged to bully his siblings, but when young John (Thomas Davidson) shows aptitude as a swimmer, he becomes the apple of his father's eye.  At the start, Tony is almost as good as his brother, but that means nothing to their father.By the time they are teenagers, Tony (Jesse Spencer) and John (Tim Draxl) are local swimming sensations.  Everybody is talking about Tony's backstroke and John's freestyle, but Harold only cares about John and even finds a way to add insult to the injury he is inflicting on his son.  But Harold is also driving Tony and John apart as brothers, destroying the bond he had created between the pair as a way of surviving their father in the first place.  For Tony winning a championship is clearly an attempt to win his father's approval, even though that would truly be the proverbial too little too late, but then he learns that winning at swimming can get him a scholarship to a top American college, which would mean leaving his father, and the rest of his family, behind.  There is little doubt this would be a good thing, but it would also be the final nail in the coffin of the Fingleton family.Mulcahy does a nice job with the swimming competitions, where he uses a constantly moving split screen to capture the excitement of the races.  But what stands out most in this film is Rush's performance and the chilling blank and empty stares he gives his family.  The threat of violence is quite frightening, because you know Harold can explode at any moment and there is a real threat that someone could get hurt.  Even when Harold is not on screen his wife and his children are responding to him, anticipating his moods and desperately trying to stay on the narrow ledge of his good side.  There is some acknowledgment that Harold was abused as a child, but the characters are clearly much more willing to except that implied excuse a lot more than viewer who do not have a deep rooted need to make allowances for this terrible man.The final scene can be read a number of ways, but I doubt whether it brings you any closer to determing how the film answers the central question.  There is ample evidence to support a ""yes"" or a ""no,"" but ultimately it is that ambiguity that provides this drama with its power.  The tragedy here is that when it comes to pleasing his father, Tony Fingleton was damned if he did and damned if he did not.  On a much happier note, both his autobiography and his screenplay, indicate that he has come to terms with his father and his family, even if all of the viewers of ""Swimming Upstream"" have not.",4,Tony Fingleton swims against his father's disapproval,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,3585,"['Tony', 'Fingleton', 'was', 'champion', 'backstroke', 'swimmer', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Brisbane', 'early', '1960s', 'became', 'one', 'father', 'central', 'question', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', '2003', 'Australian', 'film', 'directed', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'Fingleton', 'did', 'screenplay', 'based', 'autobiography', 'wrote', 'sister', 'Diane', 'doubt', 'story', 'tell', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'can', 'answer', 'question', 'definitively', 'one', 'way', 'other.Young', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'Mitchell', 'Dellevergin', 'was', 'gangly', 'sickly', 'boy', 'who', 'liked', 'play', 'piano', 'was', 'ignored', 'father', 'Harold', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'worked', 'docks', 'Brisbane', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'strike', 'drunk', 'Harold', 'abusive', 'man', 'who', 'violent', 'rages', 'coldly', 'threatening', 'silences', 'When', 'wife', 'Dora', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'four', 'sons', 'only', 'daughter', 'know', 'go', 'hide', 'rooms', 'head', 'neighborhood', 'swimming', 'pool', 'oldest', 'son', 'named', 'father', 'encouraged', 'bully', 'siblings', 'when', 'young', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Davidson', 'aptitude', 'swimmer', 'apple', 'father', 'eye', 'start', 'Tony', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'brother', 'nothing', 'father.By', 'time', 'are', 'teenagers', 'Tony', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'John', 'Tim', 'Draxl', 'are', 'local', 'swimming', 'sensations', 'Everybody', 'talking', 'Tony', 'backstroke', 'John', 'freestyle', 'Harold', 'only', 'John', 'even', 'way', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'inflicting', 'son', 'Harold', 'also', 'driving', 'Tony', 'John', 'apart', 'brothers', 'destroying', 'bond', 'had', 'created', 'pair', 'way', 'surviving', 'father', 'first', 'place', 'Tony', 'winning', 'championship', 'clearly', 'attempt', 'win', 'father', 'approval', 'even', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'proverbial', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'then', 'winning', 'swimming', 'can', 'get', 'scholarship', 'top', 'American', 'college', 'would', 'mean', 'leaving', 'father', 'rest', 'family', 'little', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Fingleton', 'family.Mulcahy', 'nice', 'job', 'swimming', 'competitions', 'where', 'constantly', 'moving', 'split', 'screen', 'capture', 'excitement', 'races', 'what', 'out', 'most', 'film', 'Rush', 'performance', 'chilling', 'blank', 'empty', 'stares', 'family', 'threat', 'violence', 'quite', 'frightening', 'know', 'Harold', 'can', 'explode', 'moment', 'real', 'threat', 'someone', 'could', 'get', 'hurt', 'Even', 'when', 'Harold', 'not', 'screen', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'responding', 'anticipating', 'moods', 'desperately', 'trying', 'stay', 'narrow', 'ledge', 'good', 'side', 'acknowledgment', 'Harold', 'was', 'abused', 'child', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'willing', 'implied', 'excuse', 'lot', 'more', 'viewer', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'deep', 'rooted', 'need', 'make', 'allowances', 'terrible', 'man.The', 'final', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'number', 'ways', 'doubt', 'closer', 'determing', 'how', 'film', 'central', 'question', 'ample', 'evidence', 'support', 'yes', 'ultimately', 'ambiguity', 'drama', 'power', 'tragedy', 'here', 'when', 'pleasing', 'father', 'Tony', 'Fingleton', 'was', 'damned', 'did', 'damned', 'did', 'not', 'much', 'happier', 'note', 'autobiography', 'screenplay', 'indicate', 'come', 'terms', 'father', 'family', 'even', 'viewers', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'have', 'not']",N/A

898511,A36WTXJBYS3DB6,B0008ENFWI,N. B. Kennedy,"[1, 1]","This is a film about a father who abuses his children, particularly his middle son, the Australian swimming champ whose life story this movie depicts.Even before the father succumbs to alcoholism, he plays two of his sons off against each other, trying to make a champ of the younger son, John, and crushing the spirit of Tony, the son who goes on to take national championship titles. In the process, he ruins the brothers' relationship, as he similarly pits Tony against his older, more athletic brother.As a parent of a young son, I recoiled at the scenes that depict this brutish father's cruel rejection of his son. I almost turned the movie off. I find such treatment incomprehensible and unbearable to watch.Geoffrey Rush as the dad, and Judy Davis as the abused and long-suffering wife, inhabit their roles to perfection. I could barely watch Rush, his depiction of degradation was so deeply disturbing. You wonder why his wife stayed around for this kind of life and why the sons wanted his approval so desperately. But then I haven't been in that situation; I imagine it's an accurate portrayal of the tangled emotions of love and hatred, hope and despair.I have experienced the freedom that losing yourself in the clear blue water of a pool can bring.

898512,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0008ENFWI,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[1, 2]","You wonder about any film that claims to be ""based on a true story"" how much of it is really true, and one feels this way about Tony Fingleton's account of his achievement as a championship swimmer in 1960s Australia. Beautifully filmed, with international stars Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis, and with plausible performances by young actors with movie magazine good looks *and* the apparent ability to swim like professionals, this film is both entertaining and dramatic in ways that seem too perfect to be true.Rush, as the alcoholic, tyrranical father, makes no secret of preferring another of his four sons, and constantly undercuts and humiliates the central character, Tony, whom he regards as weak and unmanly, apparently for no other reason than that he plays the piano. Haunted by demons of his own impoverished childhood, he drinks up what little he earns, while Davis as the mother provides the needed emotional support for a family forced to live in poverty. Fingleton's story, as he tells it, is one of overcoming all these obstacles to leverage a career as a young athlete into a full scholarship at Harvard. While he attempts to make peace with his father in the closing scenes, he portrays himself as selfless, endlessly patient, and forgiving. Meanwhile, it seems pretty obvious that he's using his autobiographical screenplay to get back at the old man. Definitely worth watching for the performances and the portrayal of a family ruled by an abusive alcoholic. You may wonder though about its authenticity.

898517,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0008ENFWI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[31, 32]","I guarantee that you have not heard of ""Swimming Upstream"". This is a shame. Although it is not a great film, it deserves a larger audience.Harold Fingleton (Geoffrey Rush, ""Shine"", ""Quills"") is an abusive, alcoholic father. His wife, Dora (Judy Davis, ""Husbands and Wives"") seems to put up with it, to keep their family of four boys and one daughter together. Trying to eke out a living on the docks, Harold frequently spends what money he makes on beer and leaves the family to fend for themselves. The oldest son, Harold Jr. is the light of his father's eye. Good at football, Harold is proud of Jr. and makes no effort to hide the fact that he favors the one son. The other sons then compete for their father's attentions. One day at the pool, Harold realizes that two of his sons are quite good. Tony has an amazing backstroke and John is a great freestyle swimmer. Harold switches his attentions to John and begins coaching them both, pushing them to become better. Five years later, the two boys are entering competitions and still looking for their father's approval. Tony (Jesse Spencer) is becoming quite a force on the junior competition circuit and will probably win. John (Tim Draxl), a year younger, is still the apple of his father's eye, but has conflicting feelings about his relationship with his brother, Tony.Based on a true story, ""Swimming Upstream"", directed by Russell Mulcahy, is a riveting story. At times it becomes a little soap opera-ish, but the force of the performances helps the film stand out.No film starring Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis is going to be bad. Both people are amazing actors and take these roles by the reins and ride them for all they are worth. Rush plays Harold Fingleton, a real bastard. Working sporadically, he often comes home drunk and his mood changes on a dime. He will either love his wife or get mad and start hitting her. A difficult childhood is alluded to, but not really explored, as the reason for his behavior. What makes the performance so good is that Rush goes at it full tilt. He wants to portray the man for all he was, holding nothing back. There is never a point that we actually like him, and I believe that this would be the case if we actually met the man. Also, despite the fact that he is such a cruel father, we understand why each of the boys is starving for his attention and admiration. You starve for something you never receive. He was also devious, as he works to pit the two brothers against one another.Judy Davis is one of the best actors working today. She always creates believable characters that come to life, losing herself in the role. As the abused wife, Dora, Davis makes us understand why she would stay with this jerk for so long. And that's important, because he is really a horrendous being. She has loved him in the past. She loves her kids and wants them to have a relatively stable home, despite all of the problems. She is a multi-dimensional character. A wrenching moment comes late in the film when she realizes that one of the kids is about to make a decision that he needs to make, but she doesn't want him to make.Jesse Spencer, who plays Tony, is also quite good. He has matinee idol looks and can act, traits which usually translate into a long career as a superstar. He portrays Tony's conflicting feelings about his father quite well. Through the story, we see him grow; become stronger and less reliant on a kind word from his father. As his confidence grows, Harold realizes that he doesn't have the control over him that he once had, which causes him no small amount of consternation.Russell Mulcahy, who directed the first two ""Highlander"" films, ""The Real McCoy"" and ""The Shadow"" in the early 90s, has been concentrating on television work recently. During parts of ""Swimming"", this shows. Some of the more abstract sequences, meant to convey the feelings of a particular character are a little overwrought. For instance, in one scene, Tony feels that he is ""drowning under pressure""; therefore Mulcahy shows his floating in a swimming pool, completely clothed, with a light shining down on him from above. Yawn! Thankfully, these scenes are few and far between.Mulcahy is better at showing all of the action in a swimming meet. As the first match begins, he switches between shots of the Fingleton family and the action in the pool. Then he begins splitting the screen into quadrants, showing Tony about to launch from his starting point in one frame, a shot of Harold eagerly watching, a shot of Dora very anxious, and another shot of another angle of Tony. This technique continues through the swim meets, showing us different aspects of the action. This may seem more obtrusive than it actually is. This technique, which is technically a montage, but ramped up to another level, the uber-montage, helps to keep the action moving, showing all of the different things as they happen during these sequences.This film was released in theaters a couple of months ago, playing for little more than a week. The film was actually made in 2003, yet MGM decided to release it in 2005? The film is based on the story of Tony Fingleton, a real swimmer and member of the Australian swim team in the early 60s. Maybe I'm crazy, but wouldn't it seem natural to release the film either before or after the 2004 Summer Olympics, and capitalize on all of the press surrounding Michael Phelps and the swimming events? MGM didn't do this and the film found almost no audience during it's theatrical release.Hopefully, you will find this film (it is available on Netflix) and help this little gem in the rough find a belated audience of admirers.",4,A little seen 3 1/2 star gem,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,5648,"['guarantee', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'shame', 'not', 'great', 'film',

898518,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B0008ENFWI,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[6, 7]","Any film with Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis in a true sports story of family dysfunction and child abuse recommends itself, and after finding its backstroke this one clocks in a winner. The two sets of actors who play their three sons as youngsters and young men are attractive athletes who actually can act. One son, Australian Olympic swimmer Tony Fingleton, advised the director and spared no one: the unloving father, the mother who enables his cruelty, and the bullying elder brother. The sons excel at swimming to escape their father's verbal, emotional and physical abuse, only to be forced by him to compete against each other.Fingleton's story is inspiring. Watching it is another matter. It upends our notions of family and argues for the licensing of parents. The demons that fuel the father's personality disorder are hinted at; the mother's weak protests only stoke her husband's behavior. Their sons seek love and approval, only to have it rejected. Rush and Davis brilliantly convey the parents' inability to change their ways. Jesse Spencer's physical prowess, as the swimmer who survives, is as impressive as his acting in a part that will flutter a few hearts in and out of the pool.There are some amazing flourishes, not the least of which is how the director shoots the swimming meets, splitting the screen into two to four frames that show all aspects of the race, his camera moving fluidly above and below water. He also moves directly into scenes of family discord knowing that these real people are still alive and remember.
