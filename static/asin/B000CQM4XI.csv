Jon Heder as a bookstore clerk with the ability to see spirits is hysterical - he plays the character extremely well.  Also, Donal Logue is very funny in a supporting role*  Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon have good chemistry and all the ""fated to be together cues"" are included, though their relationship progression could be better developed (see cons below).CONS*  Slightly hurried.  Related to the point below, some of the transitions and plot development could be a little clearer.  Mark Ruffalo's character has revelations a little too quickly and some critical transitions are left out (a few are included in the deleted scenes).*  The progression of their relationship is a little stilted.  It goes something like ""He likes her couch and decides to rent her apartment.  They torment each other.  She calls him lazy.  He shows her a garden he made.  They grow fond of each other.  He accepts that he'll have to live without her.  They have an intimate humanoid-ghost moment.  He realizes he can't live without her and goes to great lengths.  She forgets him.  He gives up.  He builds her a garden.  She suddenly remembers.  He gets the girl""  Everyone knew he'd get the girl, but the transitions could have been much smoother.",5,"Great Movie, For What It Is!",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,1363,"['really', 'movie', 'funny', 'comedy', 'touching', 'NOTE', 'THERE', 'ARE', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW', 'PROS*', 'Great', 'performances', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'ability', 'see', 'spirits', 'hysterical', 'character', 'extremely', 'well', 'Also', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'very', 'funny', 'supporting', 'role*', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'fated', 'be', 'together', 'cues', 'are', 'included', 'relationship', 'progression', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'developed', 'see', 'cons', '.CONS*', 'Slightly', 'hurried', 'Related', 'point', 'transitions', 'plot', 'development', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'clearer', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'character', 'revelations', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'critical', 'transitions', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'few', 'are', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', '*', 'progression', 'relationship', 'little', 'stilted', 'something', 'couch', 'rent', 'apartment', 'torment', 'other', 'lazy', 'garden', 'made', 'grow', 'fond', 'other', ""'ll"", 'have', 'live', 'have', 'intimate', 'humanoid-ghost', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'great', 'lengths', 'up', 'garden', 'suddenly', 'remembers', 'girl', 'Everyone', 'knew', ""'d"", 'get', 'girl', 'transitions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'smoother']",N/A
960601,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CQM4XI,A Customer,"[1, 3]","There seems to be real trend in Hollywood at the moment for A-list stars to belittle themselves by doing films that come under the guise of ""light"" romantic comedy, think Nicole Kidman in Bewitched and the wonderful Diane Lane in Must Love Dogs.  The latest is the Reece Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo vehicle Just Like Heaven, a movie so prefabricated and contrived that you can just see the studio heads desperately round tabling it is as a vehicle for these two lead actors.Overly cute, awkwardly acted, and full of the usual minor misunderstandings designed to keep the lovers apart, Just Like Heaven revolves around the lively spirit of a comatose doctor who spars and bonds with the wounded and dissolute hunk who moves into her apartment. A perfectly hospitable and undemanding genre film, the movie endures a rocky start, and then catches fire with some smart, enjoyable if unsophisticated wit, before eventually fizzling out in a mostly sugary final act.Dr. Elizabeth Masterson is an overworked and dedicated San Francisco emergency room doctor. On her way to a blind date dinner arranged by her sister, huge truck collides with her car during a rainstorm, leading Elizabeth's sister (Dina Waters) to sublet Elizabeth's choice apartment, complete with stunning million dollar views and a fireplace in a vintage hillside corner building.Meanwhile, moping landscape architect David (Mark Ruffalo) in his search for an apartment, unable to shake off the death of his wife two years earlier despite the best efforts of his therapist pal (Donal Logue), is so taken with the attractive apartment that he snaps it up, intent on drinking himself into a stupor and wallowing in despair, is shocked when the image of Elizabeth soon appears.Both demand to know what each other are doing in their place. David realizes that only he can see Elizabeth, who is unaccountably hard to convince that she is actually a ghost. After a couple such run-ins, David first tries to exorcise Elizabeth, and then recruits a supernatural bookstore clerk, Darryl (Jon Heder), in an effort to help Elizabeth become incarnate. Some identity sleuthing, acerbic teasing, and a common attraction ensue, and when the pair discovers that Elizabeth is about to be taken off of life support, they both race against time to stop it.Adapted from the novel If Only It Were True, the film just tries too hard, especially during the awkward third act where the wounded couple's path to spiritual redemption is tempered by a phony right to life diatribe. The biggest problem, however, is the weak screenplay, which tries to make Witherspoon's squinty doe eyed Elizabeth into one long running joke which most of the time, falls terribly flat. Given the lack of sweeping, dramatically lyrical romance present in either the script or the characterizations, the movie would have benefited from a more raucous and freewheeling application of its premise. Instead, the director Mark Waters and the lead actors play it all terribly safe.Witherspoon is glowing as always, if not a little overly earnest, and Ruffalo is good in all his sexy gruffness, but there's no real spark of robust chemistry here, the arc of their bourgeoning relationship is all fairly perfunctory, and it's just not heavy enough to make the metaphysicality of this concept really mean something. The film as a whole, while amicable and approachable, seems tamped down by a litany of corny music cues and the predictable plotting.I guess you could say that Just Like Heaven gets by on the likeability of its two stars, but it has more fits than starts, and the basic comedic opportunities just don't really work; it's premise is just too tired; perhaps with a stronger script, and a more tightly focused direction, the film might have been quite compelling. You have to worry about a film when you end up admiring the gorgeous apartment furnishings and the stunning vistas far more than the actual story or characters.

960603,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000CQM4XI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 12]","Who remembers a film made in 1990 that literally swept the nation and awarded Whoopi with her one and only Oscar?  Unchained Melody coupled with a new romantic way to create pottery, does that ring a bell to any of you film aficionados out there?  For those that have ever had the opportunity to turn TBS on any given night will know that the film of which I speak about is the ""Back when Swayze was Swayze"" film called Ghost.  Apparently, we, as a film viewing audience, have completely forgotten about that film and needed a void filled in our movie watching lives in which Hollywood revamped, updated, and regurgitated it back to a newer generation (those born post-1990) in the form of Just Like Heaven.  While there were some minor changes (aka Ruffalo replacing Swayze), and a completely modern ending, what we were left with was just Ghost with a facelift.  With transparent characters, a convoluted plot that ended as it opened, and actors hired for mere face dollar, Just Like Heaven proved that it was ""Just Like (insert anything here)"".  Apparently leaving any form of originality and creativity behind, director Mark Waters only proved that upon watching repeat viewings of the film Ghost, crippling great bands like ""The Cure"" with embarrassing remakes, and giving Mark Ruffalo an undeserved leading role, Just Like Heaven felt like a generic rip-off instead of a brand name.This film reminded me of that annoying Aunt that arrives to your house with the sole intention of telling you how cute you are while pinching your cheeks as hard as possible.  Just Like Heaven's downfall was that it was too cute, too formulaic, too generic, and completely uneventful.  As I watched the digital timer on my DVD player slowly reach an hour and a half, I kept wondering when this film was going to finally do or say something that was original.  From the work-a-holic character of Reese Witherspoon to the completely unmatched Mark Ruffalo following the trail down towards the Ghost-like plot, and finally ending with a climax that felt plagiarized, nothing in this film was enjoyable.  It became very obvious early in the film that even Jon Heder was employed only to bring those Napoleon Dynamite fans into the theater.  He had one of the worst ""catch-phrases"" imaginable and used that same line to demolish any level of dignity that this film was hoping to end with.  By the end of this film, I felt like someone tried to ""hard sell"" me the film.  To put it even better, I think what disappointed me the most was the title.  I felt like someone just sold me a machine called ""Waffle Sensations"", but it had nothing to do with waffles.  It wasn't enjoyable to sit and watch because it lacked any spunk or spontaneity that I wanted to see from everyone involved with this film.I am extremely upset with Reese Witherspoon.  From everything that I have heard about her performance in Walk The Line, she is sure to win Oscar gold this year, but how can anyone respectively walk up to get their statuette with any honor after knowing that they made a film called Just Like Heaven.  Reese has to be disappointed with her choices after this film.  As she attempted to play ""cute"" to the audience, what actually came through the film was annoying.  She was as transparent as a ""ghost"" could be both with her character and her overall point in the film.  She randomly walked from room to room giving us no justification for anything that she did.  Suddenly, this spirit confined to the apartment, which Ruffalo is in, can make her way to the bar, into Ruffalo's body, to a hospital miles away, and even throughout San Francisco.  I think this film would have worked more if she weren't so mobile.  Nearly midway through the film, I forgot she was a ghost.  How bad is that?  Then, there is Ruffalo.  Oh, it is not easy for me to say, but this film was not his cup of tea.  How can one go from making powerful independent films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and In the Cut, and suddenly expect audiences to lend their heart to him this film.  I realize he was in 13 Going On 30, but I thought the poor box-office receipts of that film would put an end of Ruffalo as a leading man.  Alas, I guess Hollywood proved me wrong again.  Witherspoon and Ruffalo were completely mismatched from the beginning, and it hurt this film.  We needed strong characters to get us through the hardships, but instead we had these cardboard actors just walking through the motions.  It was embarrassing and only bored us completely.I also blame director Mark Waters for this film.  He had so much opportunity to create a very mellow, somewhat sad, yet completely humorous film.  The points were there, no matter how much they resembled Ghost, but how Waters failed was that he could not bring everything together with enough strength.  He didn't know how to balance the comedy and dramatic side to this story.  You could instantly see this when Heder and Logue made their appearance on screen.  Waters needed funny characters, clich&eacute; actors, to round out his story.  If he would have instead hired funnier actors for the title roles, I believe he would have found himself with a decent little film.  Instead, go with big names, supplement the humor to Heder and Logue because you know those will have the better lines and bring more into the theater.  Waters failed as a director and he only has another forgettable romantic comedy to speak for.  How sad.Overall, I thought this was not a great film.  Sure, listening to ""The Cure"" will give it one additional star, but outside of that there is nothing redeeming in this film.  Unshaved Ruffalo?  Give it to me in the form of a great indie film and it will pack me into the theaters each time, but this clich&eacute; story was nothing more than a Ghost knock-off.  I felt like I was shopping at Wal-Mart for name brand fashions.  I am sorry, but Just Like Heaven played it safe, cute, and predictable, and will be forgotten before the end of the year.  I think the only thing to redeem this film would have been an actual buffalo playing the role of Ruffalo, but that may be a different film all together...Grade: ** out of *****",2,There's like this

960604,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000CQM4XI,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 2]","This is the kind of movie you wait for and when you find it, relish sharing the discovery with others.  It's like Station Agent and 10 Items or Less in this respect, a small movie that should not be missed.  On paper, it has absolutely nothing going for it.  The premise is beyond stupid, we've seen it in Ghost and elsewhere.  Boy meets girl, boy realizes girl is restless spirit only he can see, boy proceeds to become romantically entangled anyway - as if normal relationships aren't hard enough - boy and spirit girl find a way to work through their considerable differences, a whacky good time is had by all.Just Like Heaven succeeds because of the fine performances by its leads, Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo - and the wonderful chemistry between them.  Despite her elfin stature and lack of curves, Witherspoon has on screen presence that is simply undeniable.  From Walk The Line to Legally Blonde and many others, she has demonstrated an amazing ability to romance the camera with what can only be called likeability, charm, and openness.  Where Witherspoon is relentlessly chirpy - ironic, since she's the one more or less dead - Ruffalo exudes a damaged, soulful empathy.  We've seen him in this mode before, for example, in My Life Without Me, another treasure.  Ruffalo is a truly extraordinary actor that makes the extreme silliness of this situation totally compelling and believable.The improbability of how these two meet - isn't every boy meets girl scenario improbable? - plays out slowly and gently until they begin to believe in one another and care about - and for - each other.  The process is so slow and gentle one barely notices it.  By the time it's happened, we care about them too.  All film relies on suspension of disbelief, this one asks a lot - but Witherspoon and Ruffalo make it easy for us to buy into, relax, and enjoy it.

960605,AC3064RV9PV62,B000CQM4XI,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[7, 8]","This really is one of the better romantic comedies I've ever seen.  It has just enough hard reality to make the ""magic"" elements in the story really work.  All romances are something of a cliche, so good writing is essential to give interest to the story and ""Just Like Heaven"" delivers.  The verbal and physical comedy is genuine and the love story is as credible as paranormal romance can be.The casting in general is excellent.  Reese Witherspoon is luminous as the female lead, an ambitious overachieving doctor who finds herself experiencing extreme out-of-body-ness after a auto accident.  The supporting cast does a wonderful job without overdoing it.Mark Ruffalo as the hero of the story is the only fly in the ointment for me.  He and Witherspoon just don't have the chemistry needed for me to believe he can ""bring her ghost back to life.""  It would have been wonderful to see Witherspoon playing this role opposite her own husband, Ryan Phillippe, a marvelous actor in his own right, because the chemistry between them is a supernova on film.  Ruffalo's interpretation of the brooding bereaved loser came across as more pitiful than anything else.  Ruffalo's acting was flat, and I have decided he is either a poor actor or else he really didn't want to do this film for whatever reason.The themes in the story are somewhat dark at times and this is actually good because it prevents the more fantastical coincidences of the story from being too over the top.  Issues addressed include grief/bereavement, alcoholism, workaholicism, job competition and the importance of families being aware of any final wishes/arrangements an individual makes.  These darker issues are balanced by some truly warm and funny moments.  Witherspoon's character gives new meaning to the concept that friends don't allow friends to drink excessively and Ruffalo's vain efforts to exorcise Witherspoon's ghost from ""his"" apartment leads to an extremely amusing sequence.All in all, this is a keeper film to anyone who enjoys this particular genre.

After a summer full of dull blockbuster, shoot 'em up, aliens attacking, superhero flicks, I was sooooo ready for the fall fare, and Just Like Heaven is the perfect way to start. Reese Witherspoon is, well, heavenly and altogether lovely, but Mark Ruffalo truly impressed me. And, for the Napoleon Dynamite fans, Jon Heder makes an appearance as an occult bookstore attendent. This character is probably what Napoleon would be doing 10 years down the road. Napoleon aside (please don't see this movie just for him!), this is a very sweet, fun, and surprising romantic comedy.Reese is Elizabeth, a dedicated doctor who scarcely makes time for herself. About fifteen minutes into the film, she's in a terrible car accident... flash forward three months later. David (Ruffalo) is looking for a furnished apartment to sublet. He just can't seem to find one with a comfortable enough couch, until that is, a piece of paper keeps flying at him in the street, advertising a fully furnished apartment. The couch is perfect, so he quickly moves in and begins his nightly drink-fest. But soon after he begins seeing the spirit of Elizabeth, who tells him that the apartment is hers. Together, they discover what truly has become of Elizabeth (I'm not telling!) and how to get things back to normal.There are lots of surprising twists in this movie, and I had already read the book. The premise is the same, but this movie reveals a lot of missed opportunities on the author's (Marc Levy's) part. Witherspoon and Ruffalo are wonderful together, a perfect romantic comedy match. Ruffalo actually almost had me crying when he finally reveals the root of his depression to Elizabeth. What a fun movie! Just suspend any disbelief you may have and just have fun!

Also, though I know one has to suspend disbelief in a movie about a spirit sharing an apartment with a living person, there were certain moments of extreme sloppiness that were unnecessary and jarred me out of that suspension of disbelief.  (For example, if the spirit character can't grasp physical objects -- they discover she's a spirit when she can't pick up a telephone, and at another point she finds herself walking through and satnding in the middle of a table -- how come she can lie down on a coffee table or sit in a car?)Nevertheless, the pluses far outweighed the minuses and I found myself laughing raucously at some points and having tears running down my face at others.

This was about a lonely young doctor who had no life outside the hospital and was a workaholic.  One funny part was the old man asking her to marry him (three times) and tells her ""I have my own bus pass.""Even after working twenty-six hours, her eyes were not tired amazingly, but she is tempted by her sister to come away from the job for a relaxing evening.  This takes place in San Francisco but all we really saw of that City on a Hill was the marvelous streetcar as it topped one of the hills and a spectacular view of the Golden Gate bridge from the apartment in question.At first, I thought she was much too young to be a doctor with so much knowledge but she managed the role well.  After being so cute in 'Sweet Home Alabama,' I really wasn't expecting such a serious movie, but maybe it's because she didn't have to act like a Southerner with our accent, though she did attend the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and knows us close up.Mark Ruffalo was perfect as the lonely widower who sublet her apartment while she was away for awhile.  He kept seeing her at times as she tried to get him to leave her place and her things alone.  Donal Logue was good as the amoral friend, Jack (J.J.).He does a bit of drinking as he tries to figure out what to do with the spirit of this beautiful blonde who has intruded into his personal life.  Alcohol makes men brave and women loose, according to his friend, Jack.  You can't drink your feeling away; he finds himself thinking about her and can't get her out of his mind.He tries everyway he can to exorcize her 'ghost' but can't quite get rid of her.  In fact, she starts following him around, giving him orders as if she were his mom.  Actually,  it is the doctor's  'strong' spirit fighting to live a life which she has blotted from her memory and, after three months, she finds herself back in the hospital and her old haunts and learns that she had signed a living will and they plan to pull the plug.The coma is not so deep and her spirit follows Dave as he appeals to her sister to give it a bit more time; one of her nieces sees her and gives her an M&M; cookie at the tea party she and her sister have in their home.  She later asks her mother if they can have another with her aunt attending.Dave takes her into a large palatial estate to show the gardens he designed  as a landscape architect, which she finds breathtaking.  He tells her ""It is my pleasure.""  She had taken that particular apartment for the view and had always planned to have a garden out on the roof (with the view) but never had time.Dave and Jack tried to abduct her comotose body for safety but the breathing appartus comes lose and she dies; until Dave give her mouth-to-mouth resutication.  He brought her back to life -- as they were intended to meet the night she had the fatal encounter with the trailer truck.  He realizes that he loves her and builds a lush tropical garden for her on the roof top.  True love wins out -- it wasn't a dream.",3,Love is a Heaven On Earth and Forever.,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,3021,"['heaven', 'earth', 'Not', 'exactly', 'was', 'lonely', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'had', 'life', 'hospital', 'was', 'workaholic', 'One', 'funny', 'part', 'was', 'old', 'man', 'asking', 'marry', 'three', 'times', 'have', 'own', 'bus', 'pass', 'Even', 'working', 'twenty-six', 'hours', 'eyes', 'were', 'not', 'tired', 'amazingly', 'tempted', 'sister', 'come', 'away', 'job', 'relaxing', 'evening', 'place', 'San', 'Francisco', 'really', 'saw', 'City', 'Hill', 'was', 'marvelous', 'streetcar', 'topped', 'one', 'hills', 'spectacular', 'view', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'apartment', 'question.At', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'doctor', 'so', 'much', 'knowledge', 'managed', 'role', 'well', 'being', 'so', 'cute', ""'Sweet"", 'Home', 'Alabama', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'such', 'serious', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', 'Southerner', 'accent', 'did', 'attend', 'University', 'Tennessee', 'Knoxville', 'close', 'up.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'was', 'perfect', 'lonely', 'widower', 'who', 'sublet', 'apartment', 'was', 'away', 'awhile', 'kept', 'seeing', 'times', 'tried', 'get', 'leave', 'place', 'things', 'alone', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'was', 'good', 'amoral', 'friend', 'Jack', 'J.J.', '.He', 'bit', 'drinking', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'spirit', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'who', 'intruded', 'personal', 'life', 'Alcohol', 'men', 'brave', 'women', 'loose', 'according', 'friend', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drink', 'feeling', 'away', 'thinking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mind.He', 'everyway', 'can', 'exorcize', ""'ghost"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'rid', 'fact', 'following', 'around', 'giving', 'orders', 'were', 'mom', 'Actually', 'doctor', ""'strong"", 'spirit', 'fighting', 'live', 'life', 'blotted', 'memory', 'three', 'months', 'back', 'hospital', 'old', 'haunts', 'had', 'signed', 'living', 'will', 'plan', 'pull', 'plug.The', 'coma', 'not', 'so', 'deep', 'spirit', 'Dave', 'appeals', 'sister', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'one', 'nieces', 'M', 'M', 'cookie', 'tea', 'party', 'sister', 'have', 'home', 'later', 'mother', 'can', 'have', 'aunt', 'attending.Dave', 'large', 'palatial', 'estate', 'show', 'gardens', 'designed', 'landscape', 'architect', 'breathtaking', 'pleasure', 'had', 'taken', 'particular', 'apartment', 'view', 'had', 'always', 'planned', 'have', 'garden', 'out', 'roof', 'view', 'never', 'had', 'time.Dave', 'Jack', 'tried', 'abduct', 'comotose', 'body', 'safety', 'breathing', 'appartus', 'lose', 'Dave', 'give', 'mouth-to-mouth', 'resutication', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'were', 'intended', 'meet', 'night', 'had', 'fatal', 'encounter', 'trailer', 'truck', 'lush', 'tropical', 'garden', 'roof', 'top', 'True', 'love', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'dream']",N/A

(although it took my wife several months to make me watch it...) There was only one other romantic comedy I enjoyed just as much and that was ""One Fine Day"". All the others I simply hated with passion.Story in this film is excellent, with great humor (you have to see the scene in a bar) and it's all well done. Also, the whole cast is brilliant - not only Reese Witherspoon (who just can't get it wrong)DVD is great too: I loved the extras, they are better then most others - there are commentaries with the director, DP and editor, and there are bloopers/gags there, as well as the ""making of"". What I like the best is that comentaries are not boring, but made for someone who cares about the filmmaking process (interesting for aspiring filmmakers too!).The only bad thing about this film I think is it's name and promotion, starting with the cover. I bet that if it had a catchier name with a more  catchy picture on the cover/poster, it would've done a lot better in theaters.

960620,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000CQM4XI,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[10, 10]","One of the hidden gems of 2005, Just Like Heaven was overshadowed by the usual commercial blockbusters and Academy Award nominees. But this cute little film is the very embodiment of the movie going experience. Fitting easily into the ""chick flick"" genre, Just Like Heaven isn't a sappy, drawn-out love story filled with clich?s and over-the-top dialogue. It's actually funny and likeable enough to appeal to males as well as females. Mark Waters, director of such films as Mean Girls and Freaky Friday, minted himself a successful film during the casting stage when he picked the perfect combination of onscreen talent to illustrate his story. The chemistry between Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon makes this film a lot more interesting than it would otherwise be with a lesser combination of talent...Just Like Heaven begins by following the life of Elizabeth Masterson (Reese Witherspoon), a workaholic staff doctor in a San Francisco hospital. Driven to achieve, Masterson excels in her career, but only at the expense of her personal life. Taking on extra shifts in an effort to get promoted, she continually misses lunch and dinner appointments with her sister Abby (Dina Spybey). On the night she gets her long-awaited promotion, Elizabeth is en route to her sister's house for a dinner party when her car is smashed head-on by a tractor trailer.Meanwhile, David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo) moves into a new apartment in the aftermath of his wife's tragic death. Although his best friend Jack (Donal Logue) tells him it's time to move on, David can't seem to get over her passing. Late one night as he guzzles beer on the couch, he's confronted by Elizabeth who is angry to see him camping out in her apartment. Mark insists that the apartment is his, and the two soon discover that Elizabeth is a ghost. As their confrontational relationship grows into friendship, Mark and Elizabeth work together to find out what really happened to her. The result is a series of often hilarious mishaps such as when Mark reluctantly saves a dying man's life using Elizabeth's vast medical knowledge.Searching for some answers to Elizabeth's strange condition, David visits a bookstore specializing in paranormal occurrences where he meets up with a clerk named Darryl (Jon Heder) who is endowed with unworldly wisdom. Darryl provides a few clues as to the origin and intentions of the spirit haunting Mark and his guidance leads Mark to the discovery of a shocking truth - Elizabeth is still alive. Dependent on life support for the past six months, she hasn't shown any signs of recovery. Her sister Abby, struggling to make the right decision, comes to the conclusion that Elizabeth would want to have the plug pulled. But Elizabeth, who originally felt she would not want to remain on life support, feels very much alive, and she wants to stay that way. Now, Mark and Elizabeth must work together if she has any chance of survival...Veteran screenplay writers Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon collaborate well together in creating a well integrated plotline with interesting dialogue. An unorthodox love story, Just Like Heaven showcases Mark Ruffalo's growing appeal as a leading man. Much like Tom Hanks, his everyman look exudes a rare charisma on the big screen. Similar to his standout role in 13 Going On 30 (where he stole the show from Jennifer Garner), the film highlights his likeability among both male and female audiences. But the role would be less of a breakout performance if it weren't for the outstanding chemistry between the actor and his co-star. As she exhibited with her recent Oscar-winning performance, Reese Witherspoon is no slouch herself.

960627,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B000CQM4XI,Cinephiliac,"[4, 4]","Wearing its marshmallow heart on its sleeve, ""Just Like Heaven"" is a sweet romantic comedy with a spiritual center.  The movie revolves around a grieving landscape architect, David (Mark Ruffalo), who finds his new apartment inhabited by the spirit of a beautiful young woman, Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon).Elizabeth had been a Type-A overachiever intern at a San Francisco hospital.  Caring and driven, Elizabeth's personal life had been virtually non-existent when she found herself involved in a head-on collision with a truck one rainy night.  A few months later, her spirit turns up at her old apartment, where she and David become embroiled in a Mexican standoff over whose apartment it really is.  As David tries every possible method to ""evict"" her, he finds himself gradually drawn to this sad young woman who cannot remember who she is or what her life was like.  Eventually deciding to help her, rather than just trying to get rid of her, David tries to piece together the mystery of Elizabeth's life, a journey which also helps him confront the sorrow in his own life.I was expecting more of a meringue than a souffle with this movie, but found I was pleasantly surprised.  It is quite entertaining, owing much to the personal charm and talent of its stars, Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon.

In fact, I had not sought out this film at all.  However, it was just coming on and I thought I would give it a few minutes and ended up staying for the whole movie.Mark Ruffalo is also fine as David Abbot.  The secret to his success in the role is that we have to feel his sadness and yet not be overwhelmed by it.  He has lost his wife, his career, and is drinking too much.  It would be quite easy to play this role with too much heaviness and pain.  Both leads need to find happiness, and we feel enough sympathy for them that we want them to find it, and we are willing to overlook the daffiness of the story.I don't want to give away any of the plot, slight as it is, because some of the enjoyment of the film involves following down all their unlikely paths in discovering each other and later finding each other.  It is a romance after all.  The basic idea is that David Abbot has taken a lease on a furnished apartment and the spirit or ghost or mental delusion shows up to scold him for messing with her things.  At first, he tries to drive her away with various kinds of exorcism techniques (really?), but ends up deciding to help her discover who she is.But as they become bonded to each other, well, what can come of it since she is incorporeal?  Stick around because this one has an interesting twist.  Of course, these light films tend to need a plot where no one actually talks to each other in sensible ways.  There is some stand in for Snidely Whiplash and lots of strange coincidences and miscommunications.  Still, the leads are so sweet and the movie so delightful, that we are willing to go along for the ride.

Recovering from her ambitious but crestfallen attempt at portraying a period-authentic Becky Sharp in last year's ""Vanity Fair"", Reese Witherspoon comes back to her natural oeuvre as yet another overachiever, this time a workaholic doctor named Elizabeth in a hospital in contemporary San Francisco.Like Meg Ryan, whose career she seems to be emulating, Witherspoon seems most comfortable in these types of confections where she is called upon to be feisty and intelligent and whose one blind spot is the man she detests at the beginning only to be smitten with him by the end. This time, the man is David, played by Mark Ruffalo showing surprising dexterity as a physical comedian and an all-around farceur. Not so surprisingly, David is also a sensitive, traumatized soul who has sublet her apartment under a most extraordinary circumstance. Having nailed this type of part since his breakout role in ""You Can Count on Me"", Ruffalo has no problem showing this tender side without emasculating the character.Anyone who has seen ""Topper"", ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"", Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" or ""Ghost"" basically knows the rest of the plot except for a second-half twist that can be viewed as the ultimate Hollywood cop-out or a creative albeit molly-coddled view of euthanasia. I have to give credit to director Mark Waters for not belaboring the political implications of this topic while keeping a congenial air about the improbable romance that develops between the two leads. Luckily, Witherspoon and Ruffalo have true chemistry, and this goes a long way to make this an enjoyable concoction. Even though the last half-hour is unashamedly manipulative, the combination of the script and the performances makes the ending far more satisfying than one has any right to expect.The supporting cast is not called on to do much beyond their standard issue roles, but the actors play the roles expertly - Donal Logue as David's wiseass best buddy Jack, Dina Waters as Elizabeth's pestering older sister Abby, Ivana Milicevic as not-as-vacuous-as-you-think neighbor Katrina, and in a bit of stunt casting, Jon Heder, in full ""Napoleon Dynamite"" mode, as a psychic bookstore clerk who can pick up on Elizabeth's aura. Higher expectations of life affirmation messages should be doused before you decide to view this manufactured film, but those looking for a well-turned ""date movie"" shouldn't be disappointed.

This movie stars the loveable, quirky, beautiful Reese Witherspoon as Elizabeth Masterson, a senior emergency room intern. Mark Ruffalo (whom you might know from the erotic movie In The Cut where his member appeared on the screen so suddenly that it practially hit you in the face) stars along side Ms. Witherspoon as David Abbott, a sad and lonely landscape architect.The story of this film floored me. It was so creative and original that I just had to take a moment to pay homage to the genius who wrote it. What happens is that Elizabeth gets out of work late one rainy night, and as she's driving to meet a blind date, she gets into a terrible car accident. Months later, David moves into her apartment and soon starts to see Elizabeth's spirit who is angry that this strange man has taken over her home. The film then centers around the mystery of discovering what exactly happened to Elizabeth, and finding a way for the love between her and David to survive despite the impossible circumstances.What made this movie so phenomenal is that even though the story is so far-fetched, it is executed in a way that it makes you believe in everything that is happening. You take everything into your heart, and you can't help but be moved when you see how ingeniously fate and spirituality have come together to create a profound love that crosses the boundary of life and death.Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

Ever heard of ""just going along with it?"" And these same people are comparing this movie to ""Ghost."" Well guess what folks? In that movie Patrick Swayze can pass through doors and other people and yet doesn't fall through stairs or floors either. Why don't YOU try to make a film with a ghost character whose ability to pass through and not pass through certain objects remains consistent throughout the entire film? Ok, I'm down from my soapbox.

Meanwhile David (Mark Ruffalo) is looking for a place to live, and by chance (or perhaps destiny) a pink leaflet blows his way in the wind, and keeps blowing his way until he picks it up and reads it. It is an ad for an apartment just over the street from where he is standing. Having a look round, he likes the place and moves in. He is soon haunted by the very controlling, very ticked off ghost of Elizabeth, who wants David out right away! Strangely, he's the only one who can see or feel her, and stranger still, Elizabeth can't remember exactly what happened to her. David heads to Daryl, a psychically sensitive guy, to get some advice about Elizabeth's ghost. Daryl tells David that Elizabeth's spirit is more alive that any he has encountered, which means she may not actually be dead. Can David and Elizabeth find out what happened to her? Will Elizabeth find out why only David can see her?The cast was charming enough, and the story was okay, though not great. I didn't really buy the romantic side of this romantic comedy, but it was still nice to see Reese on screen, going through emotions in her own special way. The city of San Francisco made a fine backdrop, while Jon Heder's appearance was a nice surprise, I hope we get to see more of him. Not much more to say about the film, really.Special features include a bunch of outtakes, deleted scenes and a commentary. Worth a look for lovers of romantic comedy, its good for what it is.

Reese Witherspoon, who actually CAN act as we have seen in Vanity Fair and Walk the Line), here falls back on her commercial blockbuster successes like Legally Blonde 1 & 2, etc.  Doubtless films like this one are something she can do in her sleep, and the box office results make it worth her time.  But it is a bit disappointing to see Mark Ruffalo step out of his usual proclivity for choosing films of substance to spend time on fluff like this.The plot is one seen many times before (Ghost, Heaven Can Wait, etc): Witherspoon is the perfect physician who on the eve of her promotion in the hospital is in a fatal car accident.  Mark Ruffalo is a down and out architect who sublets her apartment only to find Witherspoon is a cantankerous spirit/ghost unable to believe she is dead, providing lots of banter between the two  over who owns what.  Funny to a point. Then the plot twists become even more ludicrous and the story proceeds down the path of romantic resolution, becoming a bit preachy along the way.Were is not for the genuine talent of the two stars the film would be a sure cure for insomnia, but Witherspoon and Ruffalo wring the best parts out of a weak script and actually make the film entertaining in spots.

Perhaps one reason I liked ""Just Like Heaven"" so much was that, about half way through, it stopped being a romantic comedy and turned into a romantic drama.Marc Ruffalo plays a depressed landscape architect whose apartment is haunted by the spirit of a previous tenant, played by Witherspoon. They start out hostile to each other but, as you would be able to predict, their relationship evolves into something much more amicable. But just when you think you know what's going on, the story takes a twist and suddenly the comedy turns into high drama.Marc Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry together. Although Ruffalo and Witherspoon are excellent, John Heder (of Napoleon Dynamite fame) and Donal Logue are even better in supporting roles.

David resents the intrusion and the scenes showing his attempts to drive Elizabeth out are hilarious.But Elizabeth isn't going anywhere because this is - or rather was - her apartment.

I however think otherwise. No matter what one thinks on Reese's other film what's important is this. Reese Witherspoon returns to a more familiar film role certain to gain more fans, and keep the dedicated forever on cloud nine. A romantic comedy with an intriguing dynamic that I know Reese enjoyed and equally challenging.The film 'Just Like Heaven' directed by Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, 'Mean Girls'), does a fabulous book adaption more then enough justice. It really goes beyond the written word, and hurls the movie into a whole new dimention with delightful results. The film compaired to the book is faithful, but here's why the film is better. There are more characters, more story, a better interaction between the living and dead and most importantly for me is one fact. If you discovered you could see someone what would you do with them? The film goes into this where the book didn't really satisy me in this respect.With television and film studios really embracing the existence of spirits on earth after death, with prime examples being Allison's DuBois 'Medium' for older viewers, and Jennifer Love Hewitt's 'Ghost Whisperer' for younger viewers primarily. It would be unwise to amount this film as just more fancy fluff. This film has more spirit then your average film.Near the end of the film some girls remarked ""Oh you can't be serious!"" It really seemed like a silly comment to make and very brave of the studio to film the scene I will go into detail about. This comment refers to a lovely scene in the film a real favorite of mine, where it seems the two leads make love clothed with the power of touch. Since this is possible on earth, is it so hard to imagine this physical expression of love would be denied us when we die? I doubt it. If Reese Witherspoon's spirit came to me in a time of need I'd want to do anything she desired. I'm so glad this film will remain after Reese along with the rest of us haved passed away. Forever this film will be seen and be a part of Reese Witherspoon's film legacy. That all actors have to share with the world while they live and after they pass. View this film sensibly.

That's not always a detriment. Something like ""Pretty Woman,"" for example, was successful because of its predictability, because it met every expectation in a welcome and familiar manner. Add a couple of (hopefully) talented and (hopefully) attractive leads--and BOOM, you've got a movie.Of course, whether or not a movie like this works depends on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief--to turn yourself over. ""Just Like Heaven"" benefits greatly in this area by having cast Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo. It's hard to gaze at Witherspoon's scrunched up face and not be drawn into her charm. She is a likable actress whom one is willing to follow even if her material isn't always Grade A. It's taken me years of therapy to forgive her for ""Legally Blonde 2,"" but she definitely exudes star quality and has learned to work it to maximum impact. Ruffalo, always intense and interesting, continues to surprise me by turning up in these bubblegum flicks. But here, he plays well with Witherspoon and so the movie works more often than it doesn't.The supernatural and metaphysical aspects of this story don't always make logical sense. Some of the practical elements are a bit loopy, too. I particularly enjoyed that Witherspoon's family leased out her furnished apartment to a stranger--and all of her personal belongings were part of those furnishings! And let's not even talk about the ridiculous nature of the scenes played out in the hospital. Suffice it to say, I hope I'm never in this particular hospital.But all and all, the film has heart to spare.

Inconsequential fluff, but sweet and genial--if you like this type of film, all the elements are here for you to be engaged by ""Just Like Heaven.""

960687,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000CQM4XI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 2]","Just Like Heaven based on the French novel If Only It Were True presents a romantic comedy with a large dose of supernatural elements.  It is a film the audience will want to like from the opening of the film, but it does not provide the ultimate love story that it attempts to display.  Some of the problem seems to rest in its predictability, as the viewers will easily foresee the general outcome of the film within the first ten minutes.  Despite its obviousness, the viewer will still want to know how the film will resolve.  There are also some issues with the physical world in which the film takes place and these notions will be discussed at a later point.  Nonetheless, Just Like Heaven offers a genuinely caring tale of loneliness, loss, and love that unfortunately suffers some by its simple narrative.First, the story presents the workaholic and altruistic Elizabeth Masterson (Reese Witherspoon) whose life surrounds the hospital where she works as a doctor.  In essence, she is a person too busy saving lives to live life.  When the film opens, she wakes up from a serene dream in the hospitals lunchroom while pushing over 26 hours of work (I know people like Elizabeth) . Meanwhile, her sister has set up a date for her with a stranger and she finds out that she is getting the attending position at the hospital that she desired.  However, before she starts her new position her boss requests that she goes home and gets some sleep.  On the way home, she continues her multitasking by talking on cell phone, driving, and setting the radio.  Unfortunately, it leads to a severe accident.Shortly after, the film introduces the apartment seeking David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo).  However, finding a furnished apartment that suits David is a task easier than building the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.  After much difficulty, fate literally brings David the address of his future home, a cozy apartment with an amazing view over the San Francisco bay.  Through David's acquisition of the apartment and getting familiar with the place it becomes clear that he agonizingly suffers deep within from loss.  It leads the viewer to deduct that David is preoccupied living in the past while mourning the dead, which suggests that he pretty much lives a hollow life.Eventually, the story comes to the crossroads where the emotionally lost David encounters Elizabeth's restless spirit.  At first, she tries to drive him out the apartment, as she is unaware of her physical condition and what has happened to her.  David responds with exorcism and Ghostbusters (yes, he really does), but without prevail.  A farce-like adventure brings the two together when David seeks help from the store clerk Darryl (Jon Heder) who we know from Napoleon Dynamite.  Heder's small part is large enough to elevate the moment and shake the straightforward story line with a little situational humor, as he possess a unique ability to sense emotional and spiritual disturbances.  Together Elizabeth and David begin to seek what happened to Elizabeth, as she is oblivious about how she got to become a ghost.  The quest ends with a little story twist in the theme, which has frequented many news channels within the last two years.The audience will easily foresee the love connection between Elizabeth and David that bears a resemblance to the Academy Award winning Ghost (1990) during the first half.  However, the first half transforms into an unintentional mutation between Ghost and While You Were Sleeping (1995) throughout the second half while still maintaining some of its own integrity.  In addition, the supporting cast enhances some of the cinematic experience, but it does not bring the film up to greatness.  Unfortunately, the film trips the audience into a pleasant experience where even the dreadfulness feels pleasant.  The zealously positive atmosphere only augments the awkwardness of the story, as the struggle that the two main characters suppose to undergo feels trivial and unimportant.  Lastly, the physical aspects of being a ghost provide some visual awkwardness such as Elizabeth walking through a table yet she can rest her head on a pillow.  I also wonder if ghosts throw shadows, as distinct as she does in the film, but this I can oversee.Just Like Heaven deals with several fundamentally essential themes that concern human relations such as love, loneliness, forgiveness, understanding, and loss.  Despite the many flaws within the physical aspect of the film, I could not help myself from enjoying this film, as it filled me with hope and promise.  In addition, the characters Elizabeth and David utterly oozed of benevolence and unselfishness, which to me are crucial component in an improving society.  Thus, I must say, despite the many cinematic flaws and its cheesiness, this is a guilty-pleasure that I thoroughly enjoyed, as it left me inspired in a shallow, yet touching manner.",4,Poignant Guilty-Pleasure with a Gentle Twist...,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,4899,"['Just', 'Heaven', 'based', 'French', 'novel', 'Only', 'Were', 'True', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'large', 'dose', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'film', 'audience', 'will', 'want', 'like', 'opening', 'film', 'not', 'provide', 'ultimate', 'love', 'story', 'display', 'problem', 'rest', 'predictability', 'viewers', 'will', 'easily', 'foresee', 'general', 'outcome', 'film', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'obviousness', 'viewer', 'will', 'still', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'resolve', 'are', 'also', 'issues', 'physical', 'world', 'film', 'place', 'notions', 'will', 'be', 'discussed', 'later', 'point', 'Nonetheless', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'genuinely', 'caring', 'tale', 'loneliness', 'loss', 'love', 'unfortunately', 'suffers', 'simple', 'narrative.First', 'story', 'workaholic', 'altruistic', 'Elizabeth', 'Masterson', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'life', 'hospital', 'where', 'doctor', 'essence', 'person', 'too', 'busy', 'saving', 'lives', 'live', 'life', 'When', 'film', 'up', 'serene', 'dream', 'hospitals', 'lunchroom', 'pushing', 'over', '26', 'hours', 'work', 'know', 'people', 'Elizabeth', 'Meanwhile', 'sister', 'set', 'up', 'date', 'stranger', 'out', 'getting', 'attending', 'position', 'hospital', 'desired', 'However', 'new', 'position', 'boss', 'requests', 'home', 'sleep', 'way', 'home', 'multitasking', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'driving', 'setting', 'radio', 'Unfortunately', 'severe', 'accident.Shortly', 'film', 'apartment', 'seeking', 'David', 'Abbott', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'However', 'finding', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'suits', 'David', 'task', 'easier', 'building', 'Hanging', 'Gardens', 'Babylon', 'much', 'difficulty', 'fate', 'literally', 'David', 'address', 'future', 'home', 'cozy', 'apartment', 'amazing', 'view', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bay', 'David', 'acquisition', 'apartment', 'getting', 'familiar', 'place', 'clear', 'agonizingly', 'deep', 'loss', 'viewer', 'deduct', 'David', 'preoccupied', 'living', 'past', 'mourning', 'dead', 'pretty', 'much', 'hollow', 'life.Eventually', 'story', 'crossroads', 'where', 'emotionally', 'lost', 'David', 'Elizabeth', 'restless', 'spirit', 'first', 'drive', 'out', 'apartment', 'unaware', 'physical', 'condition', 'happened', 'David', 'exorcism', 'Ghostbusters', 'yes', 'really', 'prevail', 'farce-like', 'adventure', 'two', 'together', 'when', 'David', 'help', 'store', 'clerk', 'Darryl', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'who', 'know', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Heder', 'small', 'part', 'large', 'enough', 'elevate', 'moment', 'shake', 'straightforward', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'situational', 'humor', 'unique', 'ability', 'sense', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'disturbances', 'Together', 'Elizabeth', 'David', 'begin', 'seek', 'what', 'happened', 'Elizabeth', 'oblivious', 'how', 'got', 'become', 'ghost', 'quest', 'ends', 'little', 'story', 'twist', 'theme', 'frequented', 'many', 'news', 'channels', 'last', 'two', 'years.The', 'audience', 'will', 'easily', 'foresee', 'love', 'connection', 'Elizabeth', 'David', 'resemblance', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'Ghost', '1990', 'first', 'half', 'However', 'first', 'half', 'transforms', 'unintentional', 'mutation', 'Ghost', 'Were', 'Sleeping', '1995', 'second', 'half', 'still', 'maintaining', 'own', 'integrity', 'addition', 'supporting', 'cast', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'not', 'bring', 'film', 'up', 'greatness', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'audience', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'where', 'even', 'dreadfulness', 'feels', 'pleasant', 'zealously', 'positive', 'atmosphere', 'only', 'awkwardness', 'story', 'struggle', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'suppose', 'undergo', 'feels', 'trivial', 'unimportant', 'Lastly', 'physical', 'aspects', 'being', 'ghost', 'provide', 'visual', 'awkwardness', 'such', 'Elizabeth', 'walking', 'table', 'yet', 'can', 'rest', 'head', 'pillow', 'also', 'wonder', 'ghosts', 'throw', 'shadows', 'as', 'distinct', 'film', 'can', 'oversee.Just', 'Heaven', 'deals', 'several', 'fundamentally', 'essential', 'themes', 'concern', 'human', 'relations', 'such', 'love', 'loneliness', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'loss', 'many', 'flaws', 'physical', 'aspect', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'enjoying', 'film', 'filled', 'hope', 'promise', 'addition', 'characters', 'Elizabeth', 'David', 'utterly', 'oozed', 'benevolence', 'unselfishness', 'are', 'crucial', 'component', 'improving', 'society', 'Thus', 'must', 'say', 'many', 'cinematic', 'flaws', 'cheesiness', 'guilty-pleasure', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'left', 'inspired', 'shallow', 'yet', 'touching', 'manner']",N/A

""Kimberly""","[6, 6]","This movie is the best comedy I saw this year... but, sadly has gone unnoticed and forgotten among this years blockbusters- ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Walk The Line."" This sweet romantic comedy puts the comedy back in romantic comedy- unlike many cliche chick flicks this romantic is ACTUALLY funny. With suddle humour and great comedic timing by Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo this movie is a true delight.This movie starts with work-aholic Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) who spends every minute of her life day-dreaming in E.R.- sadly she is missing out what life is all about-love, friendship, and family. Once her car is hit in a freak car accident the real story begins. David Abott(Mark Ruffalo) a former landscape architect who has a few ghosts of his own is trying to look for an affordable apartment. When Elizabeth's fully furnished apartment comes onto the market- David is immeadiately drawn to the place- perhaps by fate. But, there is a minor catch Elizabeth's presence is still very much there... and she begins a campaign to try to make David leave the place. Finally the two come to a truce and begin a search to find out about Elizabeth's past(since she has forgotten it) and discover why David is the only person who can see her... Through a hillarous mix of exorcisms and past life specialists. The two finally discover the truth to Elizabeth's past and their future.This movie is the best romantic comedy I have seen in a LONG time and it had some guys I was hanging with laughing along with me. Reese Witherspoon gives her best comedic performance since ""Legally Blonde"" and Mark Ruffalo has officaly established himself as the ladies man in chick flicks.This movie is also a good movie to watch with the kids or pre-teens because unlike so many other movies there is NO slease in this one!

Not only is she lovely and likeable, but she can act (see WALK THE LINE) and she has yet to pick a bad vehicle.In JUST LIKE HEAVEN, a kind of updated GHOST AND MRS. MUIR, Witherspoon plays Dr. Elizabeth Masterson, a dedicated young doctor who has put her own life on the back burner. Driving home from work one night she is in a terrible head-on collision.Making her way back home, she finds her apartment occupied by Mark Ruffalo (David) who is a lonely and depressed widower. It quickly transpires that only David can see Elizabeth, who is trapped between life and death, and remembers few details of her past.Although David first tries to exorcise Elizabeth from his/her apartment, they soon become friends. In order to find out what's going on with Elizabeth, David and she begin visiting all the places of her life, and seek the help of a spacy New Age bookstore owner, who may in fact be more than he seems.Rather in the vein of HARVEY, people begin to think David is mad, talking to a beautiful invisible woman, with whom of course he is beginning to fall in love. The spirit moves him, so to speak. But how to have a relationship with a ghost?

960699,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CQM4XI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","When I go to the theater it is usually for big special effects movies or ones that have been nominated for Oscars (assuming they actually come here), which means that I rarely to to see a romantic comedy.  I like romantic comedies, but they work just as well (if not better) in the comfort of your own home, so usually I just wait for them to come out on DVD.  Consequently, while I saw trailers and commercials for ""Just Like Heaven,"" I did not really pay attention to them, nor did I read or listen to any reviews.  This was a romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon, so it was into the queue and today it showed up.  Consequently, I got to watch ""Just Like Heaven"" assuming it was a love story between a guy and the ghost that used to life in his apartment and was pleased to discover that was not what this movie was about.  I hope you are able to be pleasantly surprised as well, so what follows will skip the twist and make vague yet insightful comments about this 2005 film.Witherspoon plays Elizabeth Masterson, a young doctor who goes the extra mile and stays the extra hour for her patients.  Her job is everything and while she deserves to get the position on the hospital staff for which she is working so hard, she clearly has no life beyond her job.  After getting the position Elizabeth is heading for a blind date when a truck hits her.  The next thing we know it is three months later and David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo) is checking out apartments to find a place to live.  Apparently his only criterion is the comfort of the couch and nothing is meeting his expectations.  But then a flyer for a sublet insistently finds its way to David and he finds a very comfortable couch in what is, of course, Elizabeth's apartment.If you have seen the trailers you know that she starts popping up and demanding that he get out of HER apartment.  She does not realize what has happened and he has a hard time convincing her, although he gets some very helpful hints from a dude named Darryl (Jon Heder), who has an affinity for this sort of situation.  The thing is that he does not realize what is happening either and when the twist is revealed it might not work for you, but it was different enough so that I was no longer worried we were heading into the cinematic land of pathos inhabited by films like ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.""  ""Just Like Heaven"" is not a romantic comedy where you want to think about the logic holding the thing up because without the willing suspension of disbelief it will never get off the ground.  Fortunately, Witherspoon is around to do the heavy lifting for this film (which she made after ""Walk the Line"" although this one came out first and is already on DVD, but everybody knows you cannot release a movie where you want people to win Oscars until after Turkey Day).Beyond the agreeable performances by Witherspoon and Ruffalo, the credit goes to either screenwriters Peter Tolan (""Ameica's Sweethearts"") and Leslie Dixon (""Mrs. Doubtfire""), or to author Marc Levy for writing the novel ""If Only It Were True.""  I liked the characters enough to be willing to accept the twists and turns, plus I really liked the film's grand gesture (most romantic comedies fail when it comes to the grand gesture).

960701,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000CQM4XI,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 7]","I fell in love with Marc Levy's book ""If Only It Were True"" and jumped for joy when I saw that Spielberg had optioned the book.  It's interesting to see the adaptation to screen.  The whole subplot of David absconding into the countryside with Elizabeth's body while they try to find a solution to their problem while being pursued by an over-eager detective was cut.  We go right from the abduction to the Elizabeth's emergence from the coma.  But for a romantic comedy, 90 minutes is about the standard length; so the editing certainly helped.Director Mark Waters who directed ""Freaky Friday"" brings actress Dina Waters who worked with him on ""Freaky Friday"" as Elizabeth's sister Abby.  She turns in a fine performance as the mother trying to do the right thing, even when unsure what it is.  Waters also directed ""Head Over Heels"" and brings Ivana Milicevic who worked in that picture as the seductive downstairs neighbor Katrina.Ron Canada from ""The Wedding Crashers"" and ""Cinderella Man"" has a nice cameo as Dr. Walsh.  Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Herder shines as the new age bookstore owner who can sense spirits.Reese Witherspoon glows as Dr. Elizabeth Masterson.  Her confusion as she finds herself standing in the middle of a table or unable to pick up a phone is charming.  I missed the book's discovery scene where a nude David steps out of the shower and hears a girl humming in his linen closet, but Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job as David.  After Ruffalo's real-life brain tumor almost ended his acting career after his big splash in ""You Can Count On Me,"" it's nice to see him go on to great success in films like ""13 Going on 30"" & ""Collateral.""  He seems to generate romantic chemistry on screen with 2005's Best Actress Oscar Winner from ""Walk the Line""!The DVD extras are a plus.  I particularly enjoyed the garden scene where Elizabeth begins to levitate like a kite in the air.  I certainly think they picked the right ending for the film.  All in all, this film glows.  If you enjoyed it as much as I did, you will also probably greatly enjoy the English translation of Levy's book from its original French.

If you believe in fate, unfinished business, and soul contracts in affairs of the heart ... you will adore this film. Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo have great chemistry (Ruffalo is excellent in these strong and sensitive, tough and tender roles)and it's a great tale of fate.The whole premise is about living for the art of living rather than for the next thing. It's a wonderful message about living in the moment and balancing life. The great part is that Reese's character does learn her lesson before it is too late. When her coma frees her spirit to allow life in, rather than run around and rescue people, she gets a chance to see that love is worth having instead of pushing it to the backburner.Dr. Elizabeth Masterson is a San Francisco doctor whose capacity for over-working leaves no room for anything else until a freak accident leaves her in a coma. With her spirit trapped in between the physical world and the spirit world, she is unaware of her limbo predicament. When architect David sublets her apartment three months later she is determined to have him leave until she realizes that she isn't in a body. David and Elizabeth go on a search to find out who she is with some occult shop help. The events play on the notion of synchronicities until David must save Elizabeth's body from being pulled off life support.David needs Elizabeth as much as she needs him. She may be in a coma but he is walking dead in the heart. A widower, David is reclusive and tormented by the sudden death of his wife Laura two years earlier, and as he connects more to Elizabeth's soul she rescues him from his emotional death.

But on the day she gets the job, she's in a horrid car accident.Meanwhile, David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo) is looking for a furnished apartment with a comfortable couch.  He's running out of options until a flier for a sub-lease flies across his path.  It's perfect, and David is excited about moving in.Until he sees Elizabeth in his apartment.  She insists she lives there and he is the one trespassing.  When she appears and disappears, David decides she's a spirit and tries everything he can to get rid of her.  When that doesn't work, he agrees to help her find out who she is so she can get peace and leave him alone.The pieces begin falling into place, but by then, David and Elizabeth have grown beyond their initial dislike and enjoy each other's company.  Will the truth about Elizabeth be good news or bad news?I went into this movie expecting a light romantic comedy, and there are some very funny moments, especially at the beginning as David and Elizabeth must come to grips with each other.  However, as the movie progressed, the story grew more serious.  I was amazed at how much I grew to care for the characters.  The scene where David thinks Elizabeth is out of his life choked me up, and I did need tissue for the climax.The story itself is basically predictable.  Several major plot points are obvious long before they happen.  However, there was a twist or two I didn't see coming.  And the movie has some themes worth thinking over after it ends.The movie is carried by the leads.  Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo do a great job in their rolls.  The movie really focuses on them, and the two have lots of screen time together.  The chemistry builds over the course of the movie.  I found this noteworthy because in most comedies it seems to either be there or not.  I liked this because shows the changing relationship that Elizabeth and David have.The praise for the leads isn't to detract from the supporting actors.  Dina Spybey especially stands out as Elizabeth's sister.  However, Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite fame steals every scene he is in.  His paranormal expert is hilarious.The DVD extras include some hilarious bloopers and about a half dozen deleted scenes.  Both are worth watching and are pretty funny, although I'm glad the alternate ending was left on the cutting room floor.This movie is a pleasant way to spend a couple hours.

Unlike so many movies, the outcome isn't predictable, which is a plus in itself.  Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are both brilliant as two lonely people whom fate obviously brings together in a most unconventional way.  Elizabeth Masterson (Witherspoon) is a workaholic doctor whose job is her life.  She has no social life aside from her sister and nieces, and her own neighbors don't even know who she is.  David Abbott (Ruffalo), a former horticulturist,  is a depressed, empty shell of a man since his wife died suddenly and now spends all his time on the couch watching tv and drinking.  Their lives entertwine when David sublets Elizabeth's apartment after she is in a horrible automobile accident.  Trouble is, Elizabeth is a ghost.  Is she dead or is she somehow still alive somewhere?  Tired of her hanging around the apartment, David gets off the couch and sets out to help her find out.Jon Heder of Napolean Dynamite fame is also brilliant and extremely entertaining as a goofy bookstore operator who also turns out to be a pretty good psychic.  Another character worth mentioning is Jack, David's unscrupulous friend played quite well by Donal Logue from the tv show Grounded for Life.  Dina Waters, wife of director Mark Waters, delivers a rather impressive performance as Elizabeth's sister Abby.As I mentioned earlier, Just Like Heaven is not predictable.  We sit down to watch the movie thinking it's going to be just another ghost movie, like Ghost, but halfway through the movie takes a surprising turn into a right-to-life fight, like the Terri Schiavo and Karen Ann Quinlan cases. The ending is surprisingly happy and there is also an unexpected, very cute little surprise at the very end.I enjoyed Just Like Heaven so much that I went back and saw it a second time the very next day.

One night, after being sent home after an expecially long shift, her car meets an oncoming truck head on.David Abbott (Ruffalo) is a quiet, sad man who moves into Elizabeth's afartment that is being leased on a month-to-month basis.  More often than not he has a beer in his hand, and is nursing some personal pain.  One thing he did not bargain for with the apartment is the sudden appearance of Elizabeth's spirit.

Witherspoon and Ruffalo, veterans of the romantic comedy, do the best with what they are given, and come off as quite likeable.  The story, on the other hand, does not always work.  The biggest problem here is the happy ending that is unbelieveable.  The nitpicker in me also has to complain about the ""ghost rules"".

There is no logic to it, and while this is only a romantic comedy, at least it should stay true to its own rules.That is not to say that ""Just Like Heaven"" is awful.

Three months later, David Abbott (ruffalo) still recovering from the death of his wife, moves into Elizabeth's furnished apartment.Davis starts seeing Elizabeth in his apartment, firstly in human form and then in a more ghostly form. At first he is driven mad by her constant harrassment of him but slowly wants to help Elizabeth come to terms with the fact that she is no longer of this earth, a fact which she cannot believe.From here we see a relationship start to develop between the two, which of course makes David look like a complete lunatic to the rest of the world as he has conversations and interaction with complete thin air, as he is the only one who can see her. But why is he the only one that can see her? And how can he help her?? While these answers may become increasingly obvious as the movie progrsses, it is still a great movie to watch time and time again.

It is a perfect blend of comedy, romance, and tearjerking drama and the lead actors, Witherspoon and Ruffalo, were a great casting choice.Usually I am not into ghost stories, afterlife, science fiction, etc. but this was indescribably wonderful.  When the two characters first meet, they both think they've found a stranger in the apartment they each believe they own.  Confusion and frustration turns to antagonism - Witherspoon making every attempt to irritate Ruffalo and drive him away, while Ruffalo calls in a priest, Ghostbusters, and exorcists to get Witherspoon's ghost to ""pass on"" to the afterlife and leave him alone.  Through some tender moments and admissions, the two cease their bickering and form a partnership to figure out who Witherspoon really is and why her ghost is stuck on earth.

960740,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B000CQM4XI,Reviews No More,"[5, 5]","I know I compare a lot of  romantic comedies to Breakfast at Tiffany's, but the subject matter of this film and the way in which it was handled blew me completely out of the ball diamond.  Never before have I witnessed such a serious topic handled with the right combination of grace and wit as this project was.  Regardless of your spiritual beliefs, this movie is a beautiful moral compass on which to contemplate both life and death.  I was raised Lutheran, and so we are taught that you don't go to your eternal destination until judgement day.  I always choose to believe that, in the meantime, you hang around and watch life from the sidelines.  Our lead character Elizabeth, played by the perky and resilient Reese Witherspoon, cannot do that.  She was a doctor/workaholic who got into a car accident after working a 26 hour shift at the hospital where she gave of herself with amazing energy and selflessness.  While her body lays in a hospital bed hooked up to life support, her spirit roams freely to find a young widower named David Abbot (Mark Ruffalo) who drinks a lot subletting her apartment.  She wants him out and minces no words telling him so!It takes her a long time to realize she truly had no life before her accident after waking David from his own emotional death over his late wife, but will she ever be able to live life to its fullest when her sister is being encouraged to pull the plug on her life support system?  After all, she had previously insisted that she didn't want to be a burden to the family should something like this happen to her.  Nothing is more sad and thought provoking than imagining how you would feel if only David can hear and see her as she now has a change of heart about it!  Do thoughts of the late Terri Schiavo enter your mind?  I won't elaborate on my opinions of that case here, except to say that I agree with another reviewer who has my support on an issue she got lots of flack for a few months back.This movie is a mixture of comedy, sentimentality, and serious contemplation about life's inevitable obstacles.  How we choose to deal with them is up to each of us independently.  For that reason, I give it five stars without spoiling everything for those who haven't seen it yet.  It is time well spent and it will get you to talking about things that are really important without going rue morgue.  Best of all, it's not some chick flick; it's a movie for everyone, and I simply can't recommend it enough.

960743,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000CQM4XI,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Everyone has their favorite movie genre, whether Sci-fi, Westerns, or adventure epics.  Mine is romantic comedy, not a very common preference for a straight male, but so be it.  I can enjoy almost any romantic comedy, even one several notches from good, but luckily this one was at least that and more.  The story is for the most part predictable, with a few twists.  There is a certain formula that has to be adhered to.  In the end the guy will end up with the gal, and the few films that violate that formula are almost always perceived as failures.The story here is a young and intensely dedicated hospital resident has a terrible accident on her way to her sister's house and her spirit makes contact with the man who just happens to rent her apartment for a month during her coma.  He is a widower and landscape architect on leave of absence to grieve his wife's death.  There are multiple improbabilities (not to say impossibilities) in the plot, but any fan of the genre can set these aside to focus on the good things the movie has going for it.  First and foremost, there is Reese Witherspoon, who is quite possibly the most adorable actress active today.  She could, if she wanted, easily assume the romantic comedy crown that Meg Ryan wore for so long.  My fear is that her talent will take her into a wider range of films.  And if she wins the Oscar for WALK THE LINE, which is probable, the range of roles offered her will increase still further. Another virtue of the film is, though more unexpectedly, Mark Ruffalo.  He hasn't quite reached the level of stardom, but he has gradually been building up a nice resume, and seems well suited to light comedy.  Even better, Reese and Mark has a nice chemistry together.  There is also a nice supporting cast, including the always wonderful Dontal Logue and Jon Herder as a slightly flaky spiritualist bookstore owner.  After his great success in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, it is great to see him in something new.There really isn't much more to add.  The plot has some nice twists though it more or less proceeds the way you know it must.

960747,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000CQM4XI,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 8]","""Just Like Heaven"" is Reese Witherspoon's Meg Ryan Moment in a harmless picture that sometimes works because of her chemistry opposite Mark Ruffalo, who apparently signed a lifetime contract for romantic comedies. Together they elevate a preposterous script for almost an hour with old-school comic timing. The movie is average. It's also about as good as it's going to be.Witherspoon is workaholic doctor Elizabeth Masterson. Double shifts, catnaps in the X-ray room, a blurred parade of faceless patients - all set to a sunny girlie version of Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life,"" a song about heroin addiction that now joins The Police's ""Every Breath You Take"" in the Valhalla of misused songs. Elizabeth lusts for a coveted residency at a San Francisco hospital, which she earns the night she's driving to her sister's, is hit by a truck, and -So David (Ruffalo) moves into Elizabeth's furnished apartment. He likes the couch a lot. He's bummed. And then Elizabeth appears behind him, asking why he doesn't use a coaster. Then she disappears. And reappears. And walks through stuff. Not dead. Not exactly inhabiting physical earth, either. ""Just Like Heaven"" hits its stride as David first tries to exorcise Elizabeth, then ignore her, then help her find out while she's still banging around in purgatory. The dialogue by Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon is flip and screwball stuff that Witherspoon and Ruffalo clearly enjoy bouncing off each other.Director Mark Waters and cast skip sarcastically on the ostensibly dark subject matter until they must face it so David can discover the Elizabeth`s current fate and plot ways to escape it. The tone doesn't shift too violently, but enough to stall the mojo, as Witherspoon, not a naturally mopey presence, must slump around, confused, stained, as if the connective tissue that made up her intelligence had been severed.  The movie ramps up to a climax that favors nonsense over more effective scenes that could have transpired between David and Elizabeth sister Abby (Dina Waters).""Just Like Heaven"" also suffers from three needless characters - an annoying paranormal savant played by Jon Heder, a Russian bombshell (Ivana Milicevic) with the inexplicable, immediate hots for David and Elizabeth's medical rival (Ben Shenkman), who isn't particularly villainous but just a punk who also happens to figure into Elizabeth's eventual fate. The script also gives David one of those hilarious jobs nobody has and a lecherous psychologist pal whose advice amounts to:  ""You gotta start livin, man!"" It is no great shock that later he tells Elizabeth, he was dead - until she saved him. Two quarters if you guessed he *might* return the favor.",3,An evening with the half-dead.,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,2679,"['Just', 'Heaven', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Moment', 'harmless', 'picture', 'sometimes', 'chemistry', 'opposite', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'apparently', 'signed', 'lifetime', 'contract', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Together', 'elevate', 'preposterous', 'script', 'almost', 'hour', 'old-school', 'comic', 'timing', 'movie', 'average', 'also', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'be.Witherspoon', 'workaholic', 'doctor', 'Elizabeth', 'Masterson', 'Double', 'shifts', 'catnaps', 'X-ray', 'room', 'blurred', 'parade', 'faceless', 'patients', 'set', 'sunny', 'girlie', 'version', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Lust', 'Life', 'song', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'now', 'Police', 'Every', 'Breath', 'Take', 'Valhalla', 'misused', 'songs', 'Elizabeth', 'coveted', 'residency', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hospital', 'night', 'driving', 'sister', 'hit', 'truck', 'David', 'Ruffalo', 'Elizabeth', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'couch', 'lot', 'bummed', 'then', 'Elizabeth', 'asking', 'why', ""n't"", 'use', 'coaster', 'Then', 'reappears', 'walks', 'stuff', 'Not', 'dead', 'Not', 'exactly', 'inhabiting', 'physical', 'earth', 'either', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'stride', 'David', 'first', 'tries', 'exorcise', 'Elizabeth', 'then', 'ignore', 'then', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'still', 'banging', 'around', 'purgatory', 'dialogue', 'Peter', 'Tolan', 'Leslie', 'Dixon', 'flip', 'screwball', 'stuff', 'Witherspoon', 'Ruffalo', 'clearly', 'enjoy', 'bouncing', 'off', 'other.Director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'cast', 'skip', 'sarcastically', 'ostensibly', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'must', 'face', 'so', 'David', 'can', 'discover', 'Elizabeth', 's', 'current', 'fate', 'plot', 'ways', 'escape', 'tone', ""n't"", 'shift', 'too', 'violently', 'enough', 'stall', 'mojo', 'Witherspoon', 'not', 'naturally', 'mopey', 'presence', 'must', 'slump', 'confused', 'stained', 'connective', 'tissue', 'made', 'up', 'intelligence', 'had', 'been', 'severed', 'movie', 'up', 'climax', 'nonsense', 'more', 'effective', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'transpired', 'David', 'Elizabeth', 'sister', 'Abby', 'Dina', 'Waters', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'also', 'three', 'needless', 'characters', 'annoying', 'paranormal', 'savant', 'played', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Russian', 'bombshell', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'inexplicable', 'immediate', 'hots', 'David', 'Elizabeth', 'medical', 'rival', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'who', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'villainous', 'just', 'punk', 'who', 'also', 'figure', 'Elizabeth', 'eventual', 'fate', 'script', 'also', 'David', 'one', 'hilarious', 'jobs', 'nobody', 'lecherous', 'psychologist', 'pal', 'advice', 'amounts', 'got', 'ta', 'start', 'livin', 'man', 'great', 'shock', 'later', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'dead', 'saved', 'Two', 'quarters', 'guessed', 'return', 'favor']",N/A

Mark is also a good actor, having delivered a fine performance in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to name a movie.  Yet here, they are stuck in a horrible script.  I could see both turning points from the very beginning.The problems start to arise, though, when Just Like Heaven leans on Ghost for far too much.  Here you have the medium type character (Hedder in another Dynamite-ish role) who provides help, you have the problem which must be solved because Reese's character is not moving on, and a myriad of other things that just hearken back to that movie.  The key difference is that Mark can actually see Reese.  Of course they are total opposites, of course Reese doesn't realize she's dead and of course they are meant to be together.But when lines like ""when I'm not around you, I feel like I don't exist"" start cropping up, the meaningful scene is where they touch (a light glowing from their hands), etc, the movie takes a turn for the sappy.  There are some very funny moments, don't get me wrong.  The whole slew of professions Mark's character employs to rid the apartment of the ghost is funny, the sister who thinks Mark is insane and threatens him with a knife is funny.  And the scene at the bar where Reese inhabits Marks' body is funny.However, the plot holes start cropping up at that point.  If she can inhabit his body so easily, why doesn't she operate on the man in the restaraunt instead of him?  The movie felt oh so perfectly plotted out, everything was just so ""well-created"" that instead of feeling spontaneous and funny it became bogged down and cookie-cutter.  Its hard to be spontaneous when the audience is already 3 or 4 scenes ahead of you.  And when characters start spouting on the nose lines like the aforementioned one and others that I can't think of at the moment, you know that this movie isn't that great.Overall, I'm really disappointed in Mark Waters.  He did such a good job bringing originality and spunk to Freaky Friday and Mean Girls that I expected this movie to stand on its own two legs.  It doesn't.  It leans quite heavily on Ghost.  Sure its more light-hearted than Ghost and has a happy (if totally predictable and impossible) ending, but if you really want to see a ghost movie about romance and the power of love why would you see this when there is a better one out there?",3,Guess I have to be the unpopular opinion with this one...,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,3090,"['guess', ""'m"", 'little', 'startled', 'reviews', 'here', 'professing', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'amazing', 'fantastic', 'truth', 'rip', 'movie', 'made', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'People', 'can', 'describe', 'movie', 'lighter', 'funnier', 'Ghost', 'problem', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'differentiate', 'Ghost', 'instead', 'cliches', ""n't"", 'rise', 'itself.The', 'only', 'thing', 'saving', 'movie', 'good', 'performances', 'given', 'script', 'limitations', ""'ll"", 'get', 'shortly', 'Reese', 'Mark', 'Reese', 'lovely', 'almost', 'everything', 'Election', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'terrific', 'normally', 'material', 'Mark', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'having', 'delivered', 'fine', 'performance', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'name', 'movie', 'here', 'are', 'stuck', 'horrible', 'script', 'could', 'see', 'turning', 'points', 'very', 'beginning.The', 'problems', 'start', 'arise', 'though', 'when', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'leans', 'Ghost', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Here', 'have', 'medium', 'type', 'character', 'Hedder', 'Dynamite-ish', 'role', 'who', 'help', 'have', 'problem', 'must', 'be', 'solved', 'Reese', 'character', 'not', 'moving', 'myriad', 'other', 'things', 'just', 'hearken', 'back', 'movie', 'key', 'difference', 'Mark', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'Reese', 'course', 'are', 'total', 'opposites', 'course', 'Reese', ""n't"", 'realize', 'dead', 'course', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'together.But', 'when', 'lines', 'when', ""'m"", 'not', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'start', 'cropping', 'up', 'meaningful', 'scene', 'where', 'touch', 'light', 'glowing', 'hands', 'etc', 'movie', 'turn', 'sappy', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'whole', 'slew', 'professions', 'Mark', 'character', 'rid', 'apartment', 'ghost', 'funny', 'sister', 'who', 'Mark', 'insane', 'knife', 'funny', 'scene', 'bar', 'where', 'Reese', 'inhabits', 'Marks', 'body', 'funny.However', 'plot', 'holes', 'start', 'cropping', 'up', 'point', 'can', 'inhabit', 'body', 'so', 'easily', 'why', ""n't"", 'operate', 'man', 'restaraunt', 'instead', 'movie', 'felt', 'oh', 'so', 'perfectly', 'plotted', 'out', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'well-created', 'instead', 'feeling', 'spontaneous', 'funny', 'became', 'bogged', 'down', 'cookie-cutter', 'hard', 'be', 'spontaneous', 'when', 'audience', 'already', '3', '4', 'scenes', 'ahead', 'when', 'characters', 'start', 'spouting', 'nose', 'lines', 'aforementioned', 'one', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'moment', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'great.Overall', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'originality', 'spunk', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'expected', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'legs', ""n't"", 'quite', 'heavily', 'Ghost', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'Ghost', 'happy', 'totally', 'predictable', 'impossible', 'ending', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'ghost', 'movie', 'romance', 'power', 'love', 'why', 'would', 'see', 'when', 'better', 'one', 'there']",N/A

We'll discuss it later.Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon), an intern at a prestigious San Francisco hospital, works around the clock, taking on any patient, in an effort to win a coveted staff position at the institution. Driving home one rainy night, she gets into an accident with a truck. David (Mark Ruffalo), a landscape architect, is looking for a new apartment to hibernate as he works through some bad memories. He ends up subleasing Elizabeth's apartment and soon meets the feisty spirit. It takes a while, but Elizabeth soon realizes that she had an accident and David isn't a burglar. As they begin to learn about each other, the attraction proves mutual.""Just Like Heaven"", directed by Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"") and starring Witherspoon, Ruffalo and Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite"") is the newest romantic comedy to hit the multiplexes.My philosophy has always been to try to ascertain what a movie is trying to do. If it does this, it is successful. If a comedy makes me laugh, bravo. If a drama moves me, great. Of course, films accomplish this to different degrees. ""Heaven"" is a romantic comedy with a capital R and C. Every element of the film is calculated to make people either laugh or cry. From the extremely lovable costars to the beautiful apartment. From the contrived method by which Elizabeth and David meet to the inevitable conclusion, ""Heaven"" has RC stamped on every frame. And everything is calculated to lead to that oh so inevitable conclusion, the final kiss between the two stars. That final kiss is the reason films like this are made in the first place. You have to give the soccer moms a little romance to remember during their trip home back to reality.In that regard, it is successful. If you are looking for a standard, run of the mill romantic comedy, ""Just Like Heaven"" is your film.However, if you seek something a little more challenging in your every day film, ""Heaven"" will bore you to tears. It is an extremely conventional film and frankly, I was expecting more. ""Mean Girls"", the director's last film, was a surprise. Certainly not your typical ""High School Comedy"", ""Girls"" has a darkly humorous bent, showing a different side of life as a teenager. ""Heaven"" has a couple of funny moments, but overall, it seems like Waters took the safe road, opting to make a film which will clearly be a favorite on cable, playing ad nauseum.As mentioned, there are a few moments of unexpected comedy, but they are few and far between. After David realizes Elizabeth might be a ghost, he asks a number of people for help, providing an amusing montage. Donal Logue (TVs ""Grounded for Life"") plays Jack, a friend of David's. This character is a brief, but welcome addition adding a couple of laughs.Remember the tagline? The following contains a spoiler, so beware....As far as I know, ""Afterlife"" refers to the period after a person's death. The After Life. All of the trailers and ads seem to indicate that Elizabeth dies in the film. Ruffalo even stares up at Reese's heavenly portrait in the posters. You know, looking to the heavens? But ""Heaven"" is a very conventional Hollywood film and in Hollywood, the stars of a romantic film have to get together in the end. Yes, there are exceptions, but there usually has to be that last payoff kiss for the swooning public to remember on the way home. They have to get something for their $10. Does David fall in love with a ghost? No. He falls in love with her spirit and, you guessed it, she is in a COMA. What do you think happens in the end? Before the kiss, of course.So the film cheats. We are lead to believe she dies, yet halfway through, David and Elizabeth learn she is in a coma. Will she ever come out of it? Will they ever fall in love in time for that final kiss?How could they do anything but?I guess I didn't like this film very much. It just seems like a waste to sit through a film that offers nothing new. Go to something a little more challenging. Step outside of the box.

960765,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CQM4XI,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","On the surface `Just Like Heaven' is just another romantic comedy about a mismatched couple falling in love with each other, but deep inside of it there is clever and a bit dark humor about life or the way we see it everyday. The story (based on the book by Marc Levy, scripted by Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon) needs suspension of disbelief, but it is surely interesting; that is, a workaholic doctor Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) finally finds a life only after she is dead.Actually she is in coma, not dead. Dreamy Mark Ruffalo plays a bereaved husband David who moves into an apartment room in San Francisco. There he encounters Witherspoon's Elizabeth who insists the room is hers, but she is not aware that she is a specter, a ghost that is still ""alive."" And she cannot remember who she is, or how come she became so `light.'One clever touch is that WE know the answer ... well, only part of it, though. We know her name and occupation in the opening chapter, but what we don't know about her, and the way Elizabeth sees it again from a totally different viewpoint, is both funny and poignant. Director Mark Waters (`Freaky Friday' `Mean Girls') successfully keeps us guessing without ruining the feel-good atmosphere of the film as romantic comedy.What makes `Just Like Heaven' a notch better than other average romantic comedies is the chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo, both of whom bring depth and life to the characters. That means we find the supporting actors less impressive than usual though Jon Heder almost steals the show as Darryl, a physic book store clerk with dead-pan humor.But the film is essentially about the two leads Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo, and the gradual shift of their feelings towards each other from animosity to affection is impressive and convincing. The emotion is deep and genuine, and we do wish happiness for them. `Just Like Heaven' is not without flaws, but as to its romance it is sweet and good-natured just like Heaven.",4,(3.5 STARS) Sweet Romantic Comedy with Clever Humor,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,1994,"['surface', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mismatched', 'couple', 'falling', 'love', 'other', 'deep', 'inside', 'clever', 'bit', 'dark', 'humor', 'life', 'way', 'see', 'everyday', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'Marc', 'Levy', 'scripted', 'Peter', 'Tolan', 'Leslie', 'Dixon', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'surely', 'interesting', 'workaholic', 'doctor', 'Elizabeth', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'finally', 'life', 'only', 'dead.Actually', 'coma', 'not', 'dead', 'Dreamy', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'bereaved', 'husband', 'David', 'who', 'apartment', 'room', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Witherspoon', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'room', 'hers', 'not', 'aware', 'specter', 'ghost', 'still', 'alive', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'how', 'come', 'became', 'so', 'light', ""'One"", 'clever', 'touch', 'WE', 'know', 'answer', 'well', 'only', 'part', 'though', 'know', 'name', 'occupation', 'opening', 'chapter', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'Elizabeth', 'again', 'totally', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'funny', 'poignant', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'successfully', 'guessing', 'ruining', 'feel-good', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy.What', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'notch', 'better', 'other', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'chemistry', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'whom', 'bring', 'depth', 'life', 'characters', 'find', 'supporting', 'actors', 'less', 'impressive', 'usual', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'almost', 'show', 'Darryl', 'physic', 'book', 'store', 'clerk', 'dead-pan', 'humor.But', 'film', 'essentially', 'two', 'leads', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'gradual', 'shift', 'feelings', 'other', 'animosity', 'affection', 'impressive', 'convincing', 'emotion', 'deep', 'genuine', 'do', 'wish', 'happiness', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'not', 'flaws', 'romance', 'sweet', 'good-natured', 'just', 'Heaven']",N/A

On her way to meet her date, she got into a near-fatal accident that instantly put her into a coma. Meanwhile, in the hilly part of San Francisco, a handsome beer addicted single guy named David(Mark Ruffalo) is looking for a furnished apartment to rent, and eventually fate bought him to Elizabeth's vacant apartment that was up for sublet. David moved in without the knowledge that the spirit of Elizabeth was still living there. At first they were like cat and dog trying to drive each other out of the place, and she was not even aware that she was not in normal human form until she witnessed herself as transparent.David seeked the help of his shrink Jack(Donal Logue/The Tao of Steve), and it didn't do much good to the situation. He then have to do some afterlife and spirituality research and with the help of a reluctant psychic Darryl(Jon Heder/Napolean Dynamite), he gradually gained some better perspective about Elizabeth. David would eventually get along with Elizabeth, and worked together to retrieve her background since she had forgotten about her own identity. It took them a bit of running around and finally she regained some of her memories. The worse thing was about to happen to her when she learned that her paralyzed unconscious body at the hospital was about to be discontinued for the life support. David would be the only person to help her reverse her state of coma before the hospital takes her body away.There are many funny, romantic, and touching moments in this film. I loved Jon Heder in Napolean Dynamite, and he was perfect for his comic supporting role in this film. Donal Logue was a bit low-key and underexposed here, and I thought he deserved more funny lines to work with. Dina Spybey had one big scene when she gets a visit from David and she loses control of herself. The romantic plot between David and Elizabeth was well-paced and built up a satisfying ending. Even though this is a Witherspoon movie, I actually found Ruffalo to be quite adorable and emotionally affecting. It's so good to see that his film has landed #1 at the box office following his ""sister/Laura Linney's"" horror drama which also dominated the box office last week! Just like Heaven is certainly a formulaic crowd-pleaser, and it's one heaven of a chick flick!",4,How Can I Resist Mark Ruffalo In a Witherspoon Rom-Com!,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,3073,"['Three', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', '1', 'return', 'rom-com', 'territory', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'failed', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'pleasant', 'being', 'funny', 'serious', '2', 'Seen', 'too', 'many', 'unsatisfying', 'horror', 'action', 'flicks', 'summer', 'needed', 'something', 'light', 'refreshing', '3', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'fan', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'nice', 'see', 'exploring', 'spectrum', 'films', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'give', 'tear-jerking', 'performance', 'rom-com', 'still', 'managed', 'deliver', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'film.Elizabeth', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'workaholic', 'anti-social', 'doctor', 'who', 'neglected', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'about', 'go', 'blind', 'date', 'set', 'up', 'sister', 'Abby', 'Dina', 'Spybey', 'way', 'meet', 'date', 'got', 'near-fatal', 'accident', 'instantly', 'put', 'coma', 'Meanwhile', 'hilly', 'part', 'San', 'Francisco', 'handsome', 'beer', 'addicted', 'single', 'guy', 'named', 'David', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'looking', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'rent', 'eventually', 'fate', 'bought', 'Elizabeth', 'vacant', 'apartment', 'was', 'up', 'sublet', 'David', 'moved', 'knowledge', 'spirit', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'there', 'first', 'were', 'like', 'cat', 'dog', 'trying', 'drive', 'other', 'place', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'aware', 'was', 'not', 'normal', 'human', 'form', 'witnessed', 'transparent.David', 'seeked', 'help', 'shrink', 'Jack', 'Donal', 'Logue/The', 'Tao', 'Steve', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'good', 'situation', 'then', 'have', 'do', 'afterlife', 'spirituality', 'research', 'help', 'reluctant', 'psychic', 'Darryl', 'Jon', 'Heder/Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'gradually', 'gained', 'better', 'perspective', 'Elizabeth', 'David', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'Elizabeth', 'worked', 'together', 'retrieve', 'background', 'had', 'forgotten', 'own', 'identity', 'took', 'bit', 'running', 'around', 'finally', 'regained', 'memories', 'worse', 'thing', 'was', 'happen', 'when', 'learned', 'paralyzed', 'unconscious', 'body', 'hospital', 'was', 'be', 'discontinued', 'life', 'support', 'David', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'help', 'reverse', 'state', 'coma', 'hospital', 'body', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'romantic', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'loved', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'Napolean', 'Dynamite', 'was', 'perfect', 'comic', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'was', 'bit', 'low-key', 'underexposed', 'here', 'thought', 'deserved', 'more', 'funny', 'lines', 'work', 'Dina', 'Spybey', 'had', 'one', 'big', 'scene', 'when', 'visit', 'David', 'control', 'herself', 'romantic', 'plot', 'David', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'well-paced', 'built', 'up', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Even', 'Witherspoon', 'movie', 'actually', 'found', 'Ruffalo', 'be', 'quite', 'adorable', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'film', 'landed', '1', 'box', 'office', 'following', 'sister/Laura', 'Linney', 'horror', 'drama', 'also', 'dominated', 'box', 'office', 'last', 'week', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'certainly', 'formulaic', 'crowd-pleaser', 'one', 'heaven', 'chick', 'flick']",N/A
