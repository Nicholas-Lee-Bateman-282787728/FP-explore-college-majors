This series is for anyone willing to take a deeper look into someone elses views on life, relationships, reality, and existence. When you first watch this show you'll completely have no idea of what's going on, but that's the point in my opinion. Every detail in the first few episodes is later either explained or provides as a reason for what may currently be going on in the series at that moment. Also it holds an important view about communication and understanding others. After finishing this show you'll possibly feel the need to cry without knowing why. More so the desire to know and understand the meaning of this series will have you pondering  for hours if you didn't get it all the first time - I know I did -. Also if you pay attention the age old proverb of too much knowledge leads to sorrow may come into play.When it comes to the animation of this story it is simply beautiful. The characters are purely amazing and so true to life. -My personal favorite is Alice who seems to pose the classic portrayl of Ophelia, and someone you can truly connect with- Also the evolution of Lains expanding interest in the wired ( internet ) is profound. I only wathced the dubbed version , but the voice acting is really good. The music for this show is perhaps one of the best parts of this show. It gives one a psycadelic feeling as well as a homey and warm one.There's so much more I can say about this show, but in all honesty it is up to the viewer her/himself to decipher the meaning of this tale, and establish their own ideas of the two worlds and what it means to connect without devices.

The characters develop perfectly, the atmosphere is incredible, and the story is flawless. Some of the story is left slightly open ended, leaving the viewer to fill in his or her own conclusions.Tech heads will relate to this story effortlessly. The Wired is easily a souped up version of our own Internet, and the history isn't outrageously far from our own and well explained. The parallels between our world and this fictional world really make things interesting. This series really hits a sweet spot for sci-fi technological dramas.Every anime fan should see this series, but be prepared for a brain twister. I've watched it a good five times and I can honestly say I still find new tidbits of the story every time. You just can't sit back and put your brain on cruise control; You must make an effort to follow the story or it will leave you mercilessly lost and confused.And remember folks, this is fiction. You have to be willing to suspend belief a few times and accept the universe of the work at hand. Those unwilling or unable to do this, need not apply. Think of it as a deep mystery novel. Even when following the concrete parts of the story with great attention, there's enough misdirection to leave you wondering what if... and that's half the fun.If you simply can't accept that the story isn't handed to you neatly gift wrapped, and that you may have to fill in the details from your own imagination, then go watch a simpler anime. This isn't for you. If you like the confusing story of animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Boogiepop Phantom then you'll love this. If you live and breath technology, you'll only love it that much more.

562550,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00005094P,A. Schneider,"[15, 19]","This series is an amazing series for a number of reasons; unfortunately many of the die hard fans who fell in love with Lain for various reasons have set unrealistic views forth of what Lain really is (and is not).The series has a number of high points, for instance the storyline is extremely cool - the idea of a girl being interconnected in someway with computers and or the internet (so as not to spoil anyone's potential appetite for the series I won't be giving a lot of detail as to what the series involves). Another high point is that the visuals are done decently (not terrific, but then again the style in which it was drawn sacrifices ""high quality"" in place of ""cute"" and ""beautiful"" on a mediocre level).Lain has a number of flaws though. The series is extremely slow, and anyone who thought Witch Hunter Robin was a little on the slow side would probably think of killing themselves after watching Lain. Is the sloth-like pace at which Lain goes bad? It can be... the truth is it's somewhat warranted, given the seriousness of Lain's circumstances surrounding her throughout the series it's no wonder long introspective scenes were used. Unfortunately some animes come across as overly pretentious... this might be one of them - everything in Lain (including the cool storyline) has been done before, and in some cases, much better.This isn't a series for breaking any sort of conventions in either a graphical sense or as far as story goes - the idea of a young girl suddenly becoming a pivotal figure in the course of human events and or machines has long since been used in Japanese mangas. Unfortunately Lain takes itself a tad bit too seriously, and fans who love anime but who are not well versed in mangas or different types of animes might get caught up in the storyline thinking it is terribly original.If you have seen quality animes in the past involving philosophical themed material then you will not find Lain all that ""confusing."" The ideas are simply not that original, but what it does do is let you experience those elements through the eyes of an adorable young girl.Yes... there are a number of things I do like about the series.The main character's innocence is best illustrated throughout the series by the way in which she acts. In the beginning of the series she comes across as a nave school girl with little computer experience while all of her friends are speaking with boyfriends and the like on their computers. As time passes she turns from that into... well, saving the good parts for those that have actually seen the series, let's just say she advances quite a bit! If you're into ""serious"" animations please do not turn this one up for a second!Seeing Lain in a teddy bear outfit is almost worth watching the first episode for - an episode which you might find extremely boring... again though: give it a chance and I'm sure you'll like it for what it is. However, again I'd like to stress that before people make wild claims about the series being original they consider some of the other films that have come before and after Lain... there is no need to over dramatize the high points in the series: if the viewer likes the series, he or she will know when they're done with it what all the fuss was about (and they'll also be able to objectively discern some of the major faults in the series as well). My rating of 3 or 3 1/2 stars is based on my dislike for the other elements in the series, but many who have watched Lain /found/ those elements and didn't consider them that devistating... so feel free to formulate your own opinions.As far as technical issues are concerned this DVD set is in perfect order and one which Lain fans should most certainly get! Again, hope you enjoy the series and watch it with both an open mind as well as a scrutinizing eye.This is certainly a series to rent before you buy it!!!

562555,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00005094P,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[30, 35]","A review of the series based on the previous Geneon release (which I own), just for those who haven't seen it. I will update with the quality of packaging, clarity of the Blu-Ray, and extras once the set is released. But I wanted to give an honest opinion of the series itself and why you should think of pre-ordering it.Lain is a 1998 anime series that was originally released in the US by Geneon. Funimation has picked up the license (since Geneon is no more) and is releasing this is a shiny new Blu-Ray format. Since it is a 1998 anime, expect the animation quality to be less stellar than more modern series.  But in looking at clips of the Japanese Blu-Ray release, the studio has done a good job at clearing up some of the 'grain' that the DVD showed.  But still expect less 'crisp' animation and outlines. Also, the show is in a regular 4:3 format, not in widescreen.~~~Some light spoilers~~~In this creepy and weird semi-sci-fi series, Lain receives an e-mail from a classmate who recently committed suicide. The classmate claims she is not dead but is alive in the net (called the wired here, a twist on the English word weird). Lain then becomes interested in discovering more information, stumbling onto a massive conspiracy by the creator of a particular plot to use the wired to become a digital 'god'. This person also believes that humanity should evolve into digital beings and leave their corporeal bodies behind. His believers carry out actions to proceed with this individual's plans. A rival of this individual is systematically eliminating these believers. So Lain is quickly a central piece in this chess style game with deadly repercussions.~~~End light spoilers~~~Philosophical references abound in this series. Similar to Ghost in the Shell, this series delves into the meaning of existence. Are people merely just electric impulses without a soul? Can people live eternally as digital information? Another amazing philosophical quandary is the belief that the world, much like a brain, is interconnected of billions of people (like neurons) communicating instantly (like the electric impulses in the brain), then could the world itself give rise to its own consciousness?The animation is very good by 1998 standards. The use of light and dark is very well done. When certain colors appear, they are well used, especially reds. It has a kind of cyber look to much of the series (outside of Lain's home). We see shots of phone lines and power wires and hear the hum of electricity in many shots. This serves to highlight the interconnectedness of people. There are many shots also showing train crossings and street crossings, stoplights, neon signs on avenues; all things to show the grouping of people and the lines and paths people follow, much like wires on a circuit board or coding in an internet server system.The Japanese audio is very well done. This was one of my earlier DVD anime purchases and so I enjoyed tinkering with the language settings. I preferred the Japanese, but I imagine Funimation will put out a very good English dub. But the Japanese audio is quiet and reserved and adds to the ominous feel of this series. There isn't much music. A few points in clubs where there is background audio, and the excellent intro song, but not much else.If you are into weird and mysterious cyberpunk-esque anime, then give this a whirl. It was one of those series which really changed my outlook on anime, and life to a certain extent. It's meaning is not as intense today as it was around 1999 or 2000. Back then, this series (as well as the film Ghost in the Shell) was cutting edge and even the premise was remarkable. Nowadays other anime series have explored these themes (Ergo Proxy comes to mind) and philosophy is becoming more common in many new series. I admit this series is a bit of turn of the century nostalgia, but it's excellent. It is superbly well written and wonderfully brought to life. If you need flashy animation and lots of action, then this is not for you. If you like cunning, mystery, and weird science fiction style stories, then this is for you.I heartily recommend this series. I am glad Funimation is re-releasing this gem.  I have also heard this expensive set will include an additional art book feature.  So it's a nice upgrade compared to some of the other expensive Funimation re-releases that have sparse extras.  I have not 100% confirmed this for the US release, but it is highly likely.  I will update as the release date nears.Update: one of the recent Otaku USA issues has a story about the creation of this series.  It does shed some light on the history and development.  Also the article discusses the hardships of creating the anime on a seriously low budget.  That's why you get a lot of monochromatic, washed out backgrounds.  No budget for more detailed backgrounds.  But it works for the series.  It's all about the story.

562556,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B00005094P,Christopher Engel,"[1, 1]","EDIT1 (12.6.13): I feel like a different introduction should be used here.First, let's get this out of the way: It hit me upon watching this again that Lain exhibits classic symptoms of schizophrenia and very schizoid mannerisms through the beginning. The first couple of episodes show things mostly through Lain's perspective, but the way she perceives her reality is impossibly bizarre. And her perspective is one of overt psychosis--obvious hallucinations of different natures in episodes one and two, feelings and sightings of being watched, being painfully socially inhibited, a seeming inability to show strong emotions even in the face of PTSD-level trauma--it's really all there, both positive and negative symptoms of a developing disorder of thought and perception.I thought it prudent to point this out, as her developing thought processes are clearly disordered and her perceptions hallucinatory. The series never explains any of these strange hallucinations she has, or her flat affect and odd indifference even when in life-threatening situations.Others have already touched on the limited ability to make this series ""Blu-ray quality"". It is, indeed, a very old series, and it was never possible to remove the 4:3 native aspect ratio. Additionally, due to the variety of colors used, it was no doubt difficult to clean these up. However, the effort is apparent. If you're well-aware of the very original release ever-so-long-ago, it will be easy to spot that a Blu-ray transition does not magically make the animation or picture quality like a more modern series. Some credit needs to be given, though, that the effort is there. To expect more is just not reasonable....Which is probably why they throw in quite a few extras in the box to make the Blu-ray more worthwhile than a very simple resolution upgrade with some touch-ups. You get quite a bit of stuff here, which is already listed, and is good stuff.And, really, it's worth it for the top menu alone. Easily the most aesthetically creative and just-plain-cool Blu-ray menu for any anime I've come across. Someone had a good idea with that one, and it was executed beautifully.---The very first two lines you hear in the first episode define the entire series. Maybe you've even seen it before because of how ridiculously creepy it is. This isn't a spoiler (it's the first two sentences ever spoken by anyone, and comes immediately before the opening credits of almost every episode), but once you hear an unnamed voice say in a disturbed tone, ""Present day...*chuckle*...PRESENT TIME...HAHAHAHA!"" Then the screen immediately cuts to white noise with a faint silhouette of Lain.Yes, it only takes literally two sentences and about five seconds of white noise on your TV for you to get the flavor of this series.If you appreciate anime series that are extremely heavy on real-life intellectual and philosophical issues, combined with an incredibly original and unpredictable protagonist, unbelievable twists, heavy but certainly not glorified violence, and a ""feel"" that's unique all on its own and has never been topped, this is your ticket. Nothing really compares or has compared since then, even though it's a relatively old series.This is one of *those* series that, once an episode is over, you'll have an extreme amount of difficulty not watching ""just one more episode to see what happens"". Once this series creeps into your blood and the story kickstarts hardcore by the end of the first episode, the sheer unpredictability of the events and the character reactions mixed with a unique art style and general creepiness will stay on your mind for a long, long time.There has *never* been a character like Lain herself. But anything I say about that would be a spoiler. Let's just say that she's a somewhat eccentric girl, and the writers made no effort to turn her into a typical anime female heroine that is actually believable in an intentionally unbelievable world in which she lives.From Lain's older sister's development as her own character to the identity and purpose of the KNIGHTS hacking group, every episode teases you with something that can, and does, change the entire course of the events.You may or may not have difficulty understanding the climax of the series, as some people have called it a notorious ""Gainax Ending"", meaning it appears to make absolutely no sense, and you have no clue what just happened upon the final lines spoken. But after I watched and really paid attention, I felt like I had a good grasp of exactly what was going on the whole time. Obviously, I won't spoil it, but let's just say that it does, in fact, make sense, if you've been paying attention to the messages throughout the series and understand every character's motivation and the inevitable conclusion it all leads to. (I wrote about the ending on TV Tropes, so if you need help understanding it, that may help. But, hey, I'll field questions after you're done with it.)Very, very highly recommended. Lain's development alone is enough of a hook to keep the series going, but there's so much more to explore as the story blossoms outward.",5,"Stimulating, intellectual, creepy, and

It all centers on Lain, who, in all respects, appears to be a normal, if not independent (read: loner) young girl. She doesn't have super powers, she isn't anime-style sexy, and she doesn't own or operate a giant mecha -- but she does wear the cutest little teddy bear outfit: ears, tail, and all.The story begins with the suicide of one of her classmates. A short time later, she's emailed by this classmate, from ""beyond the dead..."" Lain, having likely never powered on her Navi (think future, voice activated Macintosh -- it even run's the ""Copland OS""), clears off her desk and sets the machine up. And she's hooked. She asks her ""Papa"" for a new Navi, as her's is a little old and dated. With her wish granted, she's soon cruz'ing the Wired (the future Internet) in her brand new Navi. By chance (or is it?) she comes into posession of a Psyche Processor, and reads up on how to install it. That Processor is only the beginning, and soon her room is transformed into a dark cave of twisted wires and green, bubbling coolant.The series, like I said, is confusing. If you had a hard time with ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" you might pass on ""Lain."" It's difficult to review, because of everything that happens in it. True, there are only 13 episodes, but those episodes contain so much story line, that missing one is like missing two hours of a movie that's two hours and ten minutes long. Only until the last disc makes it into your DVD player do you begin to understand some of what's going on. And then, the story line changes on you again, and you're once again thinking, ""Huh?""If you've never seen ""Lain,"" I wouldn't recommend this box set. I also can't recommend the purchase of just the first disc to ""try it out,"" as the good, confusing stuff doesn't start happening until the next disc's episodes. You might want to try a rental store or friend, to give it a test drive. If you already own all the DVD's, there's really no reason to buy this box set, as all you'd be getting is a box (and, of course, a second copy of each DVD).Repeated viewings of ""Lain"" are recommended. Personally, I think a little ""viewer companion"" for us American audiences would have been a nice touch.

562560,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B00005094P,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[3, 3]","First of all, I'd like to say how glad I am that Funimation reissued this anime in a DVD/blu-ray combo pack last November.  No longer is a gem like this in ""out-of-print obscurity.""Serial Experiments Lain has been one of those anime titles I've heard of ever since I got into anime back in July of 2002, but never checked out since from the surface, didn't look all that appealing to me at the time.  I made a gamble when Funimation was reissuing this anime by pre-ordering it on Amazon a few months back, got it on release date, and just finished watching it.  I guess after suffering a few months back from that puke-inducing animated swill known as High School of the Dead, a cerebral anime like this was just what I needed.  As you can see by my rating, I was really glad to have seen this.Before I kick off the review, I should suggest to potential viewers that before watching it (if you want to see it), that you get yourself a lot of coffee and M&Ms; (or whatever caffeinated and sugary food/beverages you like) when you watch Serial Experiments Lain, not because it's boring (quite the opposite), but because this is an anime that will give your brain a good workout.STORYSerial Experiments Lain is about a young girl named Lain Iwakura, who at first appears to be a shy, lukewarm junior high school student.  After receiving a Navi (a computer connected to the Wired, the anime's version of the internet) from her dad, she soon finds herself engrossed in the Wired and embarks on a journey where the virtual world and reality are blurred.  In this journey, many mind-bending things will happen and her personality will alter in so many ways.  Along the way, she finds out of a power struggle between a mysterious group of hackers known as the Knights of Eastern Calculus and the Tachibana corporation.CHARACTERSI though the way the characters were handled in this anime was well done.  The focus is mostly on Lain, and at first, she seems like a shy girl devoid of any personality.  However, as her immersion in the Wired gets deeper, many bolder personalities of Lain are embodied.  I was pleased with how Lain's school friends (Alice, Julie, and Reika) were handled, since they felt like teenage girls, but at the same time, this anime didn't bombard you with a bunch of sappy teenage school drama coming from these girls' mouths, which would have been a huge distraction from the central parts of the story.Other characters, like Lain's family, have believable, well-established personalities that get altered when the real world and the Wired are altered with, and these changes work out really well in the context of the story.THEMESSince Serial Experiments Lain is an anime that's heavily entrenched in philosophy and the rapid evolution of computer and electronic networking technology.I'll be honest here and say that so many things have happened in this anime, that I'll need to watch it again at least once to get a full grasp of this, but I was able to comprehend this well enough to know what happened and what some things mean.This anime's most prominent theme is that it's almost like a warning to people about over-reliance on computerized electronic communications.  I thought this type of ""warning"" was tastefully-done since it's not shoved in your face and isn't sanctimonious about it.  I guess you could say the core message with this theme is that over-reliance on the Wired (or internet) will diminish one's humanity.  I think it's crazy that this was made in 1998 yet the themes of technology are still relevant today.Religion is another theme tackled in this anime, and without spoiling anything, some of the discussion between Lain and Eiri (who calls himself ""God"") will make ponderous folks happy.There was also real history about the first computers and electronic networks that would tie into the foundation for the Wired, and I thought this combination was ace since these meshed perfectly and shows it has some proper learning of important history.HORROR ELEMENTSWhile not being an outright horror anime, there are some horror elements used in it to illustrate the psychological deterioration Lain and others go through in this anime.  One of the creepiest was on Layer 09:  Protocol, where an alien in a red and green sweater peaks into Lain's room and creeps her out.Another horror scene that creeped me out a lot was when Mika (Lain's older sister) starts hallucinating in a fast food joint, and when in the bathroom, is forced into seeing ""Fulfill your destiny!"" scribed on the stall door.What I find funny about the scant horror scenes in it is that there's horrible anime like Elfen Lied that constantly bombard you with gore, trying to pass it off as scary, and while the horror scenes in Serial Experiments Lain had very little to no blood in them, were far more unnerving than anything the likes of Elfen Lied, Gantz, or High School of the Dead could throw at you.APPEARANCEThe animation and artwork for this is stunning.  With this being an anime from the late 90's, this was one of the last pieces of anime that would have had traditional cel animation in it, and incorporated a lot of fusion with CGI and real photographs and film passed through various filters.  The combination of these visual elements help reinforce the strong themes of technological takeover and of the overall cerebral nature of the show.While the looks of the computers and other electronics look a little dated by today's world of thin supercomputers and smartphones, they almost seem like the foundation of the technology we take for granted.  Lain's Navi can view video from the Wired without excessive buffer times and even has voice recognition for the password and cellphones have email capacity, which I thought was pretty visionary for its time.  Also, Lain's Navi is hooked to a series of other computers and cooling machines to make it look like a menacing entity taking over Lain's life.I have to give props to Yoshitoshi ABe's (yes, the ""b"" in his last name is capitalized) character designs since they largely lean more towards ""realistic"" human looks while still have a strong ""anime"" air to them.SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack here is a little of a mixed bag, but thankfully leans more towards the good side.  I found the intro and outro music to be pretty unremarkable, but the background music in the episodes is quite good.  There's heavy use of ambient electronic music and even some more aggressive tones in this niche, that perfectly match the setting of this anime.  There's some other styles of music in some episodes, such as in the last Layer, that featured a good deal of instrumental psychedelic rock pretty reminiscent to Jimi Hendrix.TONAL CONSISTENCYOne of the things that really made me happy about Serial Experiments Lain is that the creators took this show really seriously and didn't try to inject scenes of redundant humor with exaggerated, goofy faces and chibi deformations.  There's also no terminally-unfunny moments revolving around the female body trying to be funny.  The totally serious, mature presentation of this anime made it extremely enjoyable.MATURE CONTENTWhile I'd recommend this anime to adults for its cognitive content, the visual content is essentially suitable to anyone 14 or older.  The most ""extreme"" bits in this anime was when there is a shootout at the Cyberia nightclub, with a little bit of blood flowing on the floor, and some tastefully-done nudity in another where Lain is seen naked in the sky, but no private areas were illustrated on her.FINAL WORDThis was one of the best and most rewarding anime titles I've seen in at least three years, and would even rank it as one of the best anime titles you can find.  If you're in the market for an anime that's totally serious in execution and will really get your brain juices flowing, then Serial Experiments Lain is essential to your collection.",5,One of the

Present day... hah hah hah&quot;LAIN, or rather Serial Experiments Lain, is a series that takes your brain out of your head, slaps it around a bit, and then rolls it through one of those playdo noodle machines.Being un-spoil-giving as I am, the series focuses around Lain, a young girl who just wants to lead an ordinary life.  In the first episode, one of her friends commits suicide; somehow, though, people start receiving e-mail from her, claiming that she is still alive but just gave up her body.  From this point forward, Lain struggles to define reality, the world she knows, with the Wired.  She finds that the two are not as different as she would like.The animation is unique, reminding me more of &quot;old school&quot; anime than more current styles.  The quality of the dubs and subs are both good, thanks to Pioneer (they usually do a good job on both, which is rare).  And that opening song will, and I mean will, get stuck in your head.Getting back to the plot, the world of the Wired is an internet-like network that contains all the information there ever was; through the series, you (and Lain) learn how humanity interacts with this network, the origins of some technolgies that exist, and that Lain is already known throughout the Wired before she even owns her first computer.Whether you're like a friend of mine and like to get really zoned out by this type of anime or you just want to watch a real mind-bender, this is a series for you.  If you're looking for a more casual, comedic style or something with more action and less plot, I wouldn't recommend sitting down for this one.  Whatever you do, I urge you all to draw your own conclusions about this one - don't borrow anyone else's or trust other opinions - they will only harm your ability to take away understanding from this series because you will have pre-formed ideas.Excellent quality and plot make this one worth 5 stars.",5,I've got that song stuck in my head now...,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,2043,"['Close', 'world', 'txen', 'eht', 'nepOIf', ""n't"", 'work', 'how', 'opening', 'sound', 'episode', 'quot', 'Present', 'heh', '..', 'Present', 'day', 'hah', 'hah', 'hah', 'quot', 'LAIN', 'rather', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'series', 'brain', 'head', 'around', 'bit', 'then', 'one', 'playdo', 'noodle', 'machines.Being', 'un-spoil-giving', 'am', 'series', 'Lain', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'lead', 'ordinary', 'life', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'friends', 'commits', 'suicide', 'somehow', 'though', 'people', 'start', 'receiving', 'e-mail', 'claiming', 'still', 'alive', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'body', 'point', 'forward', 'Lain', 'define', 'reality', 'world', 'Wired', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'different', 'would', 'like.The', 'animation', 'unique', 'reminding', 'more', 'quot', 'old', 'school', 'quot', 'more', 'current', 'styles', 'quality', 'dubs', 'subs', 'are', 'good', 'thanks', 'Pioneer', 'usually', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'rare', 'opening', 'song', 'will', 'mean', 'will', 'get', 'stuck', 'head.Getting', 'back', 'plot', 'world', 'Wired', 'internet-like', 'network', 'information', 'there', 'ever', 'was', 'series', 'Lain', 'learn', 'how', 'humanity', 'network', 'origins', 'technolgies', 'exist', 'Lain', 'already', 'known', 'Wired', 'even', 'first', 'computer.Whether', ""'re"", 'friend', 'mine', 'get', 'really', 'zoned', 'out', 'type', 'anime', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'real', 'mind-bender', 'series', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'casual', 'comedic', 'style', 'something', 'more', 'action', 'less', 'plot', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'sitting', 'down', 'one', 'do', 'urge', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'borrow', 'anyone', 'else', 'trust', 'other', 'opinions', 'will', 'only', 'harm', 'ability', 'take', 'away', 'understanding', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'pre-formed', 'ideas.Excellent', 'quality', 'plot', 'make', 'one', 'worth', '5', 'stars']",Lain: Serial Experiments

This series is definately complex and bizarre, but also one of the most intriguing and thought provoking pieces ever assembled.  With beautiful imagery that sometimes would go from epic to downright trippie.  &quot;Lain&quot; was so superb visually, not simply because the animation was fabricated in such a high standard, but because it was combined together in such a perfect state.  The soundtrack also accented the series in golden form, the sounds linear to every scene, some sounds nothing more than hums, but still sharp in your mind.  Above all, the storyline anchored the whole series, as you go from episode to episode you seem to learn more of the plot and at the same time get a little more confused.  You really can't say enough of the writing of this series, really a great marvel.  Definately for those with a very open mind, since the major theme of the series is in fact our very existance.  The existance of our being physically and even the very fabric and importance of our memories.  I guess you can also call this a character piece.  I really took an interest in Lain, who was this young girl so bland and emotionless and at the same time so human.  It's really hard to explain, but in some odd way, I related to her more than any of the &quot;normal&quot; characters in the series.Not really a pick-up for your average Anime fan.  Recommended to those that are serious film and related media spectators.  Very similiar at times to even a David Lynch film, with great under-lays of the plot and a heavy message.  Very much a challenging viewing, very serious, and at times very bizarre.  Probably a perfect fit for Lynch and Kubrick fans, even Bergman or Fellini fans will probably enjoy.

I spent a large portion of this series thinking it was highly influenced by the Matrix... until I looked at the date and found that ""Serial Experiments Lain"" was out well before the Matrix.  Now I wonder if the Matrix was influenced by this.  Part of me says it must have been!  Ah well, that's what I get for watching things so long after they came out.  Either way I did quite enjoy this series' philosophical concepts quite a bit.The animation and story sequence is very surreal on both fronts.  To be honest, I wasn't very into the way it was ""filmed"".  It was very disruptive and always made you question what you were watching.  I realize this is pretty much the whole point, but they almost did TOO good of a job blurring the scenes of reality and the virtual, which is basically the whole series concept.  Just part of me wishes the lines were a little more well defined, so I wouldn't have to constantly be assaulted with ""is this real?""  However, it forces you to really think about what you're watching, so my preferences aside this is insanely well thought out!  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is about questioning the perceptions of reality and how you define yourself as a real person or as a virtual person.  I assume this was influenced by the explosion of the internet and how people represent themselves as they'd like to see themselves, not how they are in the real world.  So ""Serial Experiments Lain"" asks the question of it's viewers about how they see their real selves, and which one is, in fact, more real?The story circles around a girl named Lain and you never quite know if she's a person in the real world, or if she's a construct in the virtual world.  But how different is the real world versus the virtual world?  I'm not going to claim that I understood every little detail of this series, but it appears to be quite well researched because it references scientists that worked on these concepts, and even the concept of a global conscious network (basically our current connection without the computer hardware).  Bizarre occurrences happen when Lain is interacting with the real world, people either go mad, or they die, sometimes both.  I imagine this is due to the fact that blurring the two lines that much forces people to wonder who they are and their brains just snap on the pressure.  Lain is a real consciousness, of course, but her concept of ""self"", as it is proposed is just software.  An executable file, as the show states.  This also brings us to the question of deity, as in who programmed this executable file?  God?  One thing I loved was that the series proposes that the consciousness of mankind could overcome whatever humanity perceives as deity, because it asks the question of ""who made you God?""  By what right do you rule our species and world?  And also presents the concept that God is only God if that deity has worshippers, even if there is just one.  Something very close to a theory I have quite often pondered upon.  So what happens if there are no more worshippers?  Is that deity still God?  If not then what is God?  As you can see ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is definitely designed for those who really want to think about the world around them and their role in it.  Lain frequently asks ""am I me?""  Always trying to define herself, always asking where she belongs.This review may seem fairly disjointed, but it certainly fits the spirit of the series in my opinion.  I imagine that many will be really intrigued by this and this should definitely screw with your mind a little after watching it.  It really makes you ponder where you are in life and is that where you belong... is it really you?  While some of the filming concepts are kind of annoying I see their point, except for ""Infornography"", most of that episode annoyed me.  Other than that they were all well done, even if a little hard to follow at times.  I think some people will outright hate this due to its very bizarre feel and they won't be able to move beyond that.  However, I think this is kind of geared towards the techno savvy generation, especially those into hacking and other concepts of free information.

562572,A3DXVAI08P00HD,B00005094P,Greg,"[4, 5]","Serial Experiments: Lain is an anime series which tells the story of a mysterious young girl called Lain Iwakura.At first, it appears that Lain is a fairly normal, though deeply introverted, teenage girl growing up in bourgouis Japan.  In her room there are many symbols of fading innocence, in particular, her collection of dolls and teddy bears which seem to lose substance in the Sun.Lain has several close friends, who try and coax her out from her shell into taking a more active role in life.Things seem to change when a fellow student, Chisa, commits suicide by leaping off a roof.  Soon afterwards, a mysterious email starts circulating on the email system of the school purporting to be Chisa and saying 'you don't need bodies.'  This message reaches Lain and in a very sinister twist, 'Chisa' seems to want to meet Lain herself.From there on the story gets more strange and complex.  Lain's father buys a complex and powerful home computer from the Tachibana corporation, which seems associated (as we later find out) with dubious activities bordering on the criminal.  One of the corporation's scientists seems to have gone 'rogue' and conducted bizarre experiments, and also the mysterious Knights Templar get into the equation.  At the same time, Lain gets a new computer and gets 'immersed' in the online world of the near future which is the successor to the internet (known as the Wired) and reality seems to start coming apart.As the series progresses the borderlines between the 'real' world and the 'online' world of the Wired seem to dissapear, and whatever events happen in one world affect the other world.  Towards the end, it seems that both worlds merge into a single reality with 'dual' manifestations, while Lain is transformed from an ordinary schoolgirl into a very different Being.This anime series is very interesting and raises some perplexing questions, especially in relation to our postmodern condition, our relation to our technology, the ontological status of our world and the 'online' world, and the possibilities of existence.  It also explores the boundaries between fact and fiction, between myth and reality, and the series contains many allusions to modern conspiracy theories (ranging from aliens and Area 51 to the Knights and Illuminati) as well as some religious questions, such as the survival of mind after death and of God.The series seems to conclude, much like other postmodern animes, we are free to choose and make our own reality, given all reality is dependent on the subject and relative to the subject.  This paradoxically gives anyone, even someone as quiet and innocent as Lain, the powers traditionally attributed to divine beings.  We can choose this power and use it in conjunction with technology for either good or evil, and the destruction of the scientist who tries to control Lain (claiming at one point to be her 'father'), the Knights, and others who through pride tried to be 'Gods', in contrast to Lain who acquiries it through love and compassion (in many ways she becomes like a Buddhist goddess of compassion or Boddhisattva) seems to show we can use such great power for great good.The message of this series is quite positive and uplifting, especially in contrast to darker animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion.",5,Interesting Postmodern Anime,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,3288,"['Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'anime', 'series', 'story', 'mysterious', 'young', 'girl', 'called', 'Lain', 'Iwakura.At', 'first', 'Lain', 'fairly', 'normal', 'deeply', 'introverted', 'teenage', 'girl', 'growing', 'up', 'bourgouis', 'Japan', 'room', 'are', 'many', 'symbols', 'fading', 'innocence', 'particular', 'collection', 'dolls', 'teddy', 'bears', 'seem', 'lose', 'substance', 'Sun.Lain', 'several', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'try', 'coax', 'shell', 'taking', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'life.Things', 'seem', 'change', 'when', 'fellow', 'student', 'Chisa', 'commits', 'suicide', 'leaping', 'off', 'roof', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'mysterious', 'email', 'circulating', 'email', 'system', 'school', 'purporting', 'be', 'Chisa', 'saying', ""'you"", 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'bodies', 'message', 'Lain', 'very', 'sinister', 'twist', 'want', 'meet', 'Lain', 'there', 'story', 'more', 'strange', 'complex', 'Lain', 'father', 'complex', 'powerful', 'home', 'computer', 'Tachibana', 'corporation', 'associated', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'dubious', 'activities', 'bordering', 'criminal', 'One', 'corporation', 'scientists', 'have', 'gone', ""'rogue"", 'conducted', 'bizarre', 'experiments', 'also', 'mysterious', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'get', 'equation', 'same', 'time', 'Lain', 'new', 'computer', ""'immersed"", 'online', 'world', 'near', 'future', 'successor', 'internet', 'known', 'Wired', 'reality', 'start', 'coming', 'apart.As', 'series', 'borderlines', ""'real"", 'world', ""'online"", 'world', 'Wired', 'seem', 'dissapear', 'events', 'happen', 'one', 'world', 'affect', 'other', 'world', 'end', 'worlds', 'merge', 'single', 'reality', ""'dual"", 'manifestations', 'Lain', 'transformed', 'ordinary', 'schoolgirl', 'very', 'different', 'Being.This', 'anime', 'series', 'very', 'interesting', 'perplexing', 'questions', 'especially', 'relation', 'postmodern', 'condition', 'relation', 'technology', 'ontological', 'status', 'world', ""'online"", 'world', 'possibilities', 'existence', 'also', 'boundaries', 'fact', 'fiction', 'myth', 'reality', 'series', 'many', 'allusions', 'modern', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'ranging', 'aliens', '51', 'Knights', 'Illuminati', 'as', 'well', 'religious', 'questions', 'such', 'survival', 'mind', 'death', 'God.The', 'series', 'conclude', 'much', 'other', 'postmodern', 'animes', 'are', 'free', 'choose', 'make', 'own', 'reality', 'given', 'reality', 'dependent', 'subject', 'relative', 'subject', 'paradoxically', 'anyone', 'even', 'someone', 'quiet', 'innocent', 'Lain', 'powers', 'traditionally', 'attributed', 'divine', 'beings', 'can', 'choose', 'power', 'use', 'conjunction', 'technology', 'good', 'evil', 'destruction', 'scientist', 'who', 'control', 'Lain', 'claiming', 'one', 'point', 'be', ""'father"", 'Knights', 'others', 'who', 'pride', 'tried', 'be', ""'Gods"", 'contrast', 'Lain', 'who', 'love', 'compassion', 'many', 'ways', 'Buddhist', 'goddess', 'compassion', 'Boddhisattva', 'show', 'can', 'use', 'such', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'good.The', 'message', 'series', 'quite', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'especially', 'contrast', 'darker', 'animes', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion']",Lain: Serial Experiments

Moments like these are very effective. I think the series is at its best when it's not trying very hard. The sense of foreboding and existential crisis is much more effectively communicated by the subtly wrong behavior of the characters, by the minor overheard conversations and the held static scenes, than it is by the moments when a disembodied voice asks the same ambiguous question over and over. Lain deals with themes which are somewhat overhashed (who am I? what am I? where do I end and you begin? what is the difference between the phenomenon as it exists and is experienced?), more now than ever, and its take on these themes isn't all that fresh.

562575,A3LY5FW9I1QJ5N,B00005094P,Internal Abbatoir,"[1, 1]","There was once a time many years ago when I was a fairly big anime and videogame nerd. It's kind of funny looking back on it all now and seeing how much of a role that the internet played in fueling these various hobbies. After consuming the latest videogame or anime series I would log onto the internet and participate in discussions with other like minded nerds, which would then lead to endless hyperbolic arguments. Everyone had an opinion and no one was ever right about anything. In retrospect, the internet back in those days (of the late 90's) was a much different entity from the beast that it is now.It seems rather appropriate then that it was on one of these online forums where I first heard about Serial Experiments Lain. From the opening chords of Boa's Duvet (a melancholic pop song that is synonymous with the series), I was instantly hooked and knew that this series was going to be something special. I was introduced to a strange dystopic world. Not so much of a glance into the future, but a horrifying snapshot of our present day and reality. The city had become the jungle and the World Wide Web had become an almost upper layer of it. Always omnipresent and always all around us wherever we may go - this was the stark world that the creators of Lain had envisioned. It was a world of increasingly growing social detachment and alienation where the lines of reality were being blurred by the radical changes of still relatively new and emergent technologies. And much as the Industrial Revolution changed society during the 19th century, the digital era was ushering in something quite new as well.And while other anime series decided to go the futuristic mecha route with Freudian psycho-babble thrown in for good measure, Lain decided to brand itself as a mishmash of everything that was going on in cyberpunk culture at the time. And along with the rapidly growing advancement of the internet, Lain decided to comment on the wider cultural revolution that the World Wide Web was playing in both Eastern and Western societies alike. It's a Brave New World where every child being born now is being born into a world where the web is not only used as a means of communication/information, but also as an appendage of society itself. From buying things to doing classroom work to downloading media and keeping in touch (social networking) with friends, the internet is playing an increasingly more dominant role in our everyday lives. It is replacing hundred year old traditions with something slightly less tamed, frightening, and new.When all is said and done, Lain anticipated this ten some odd years ago. It seems to me that the creators of Lain have succeeded marvelously in what they set out to do, which was to intellectually provoke their audience. Indeed, there are countless websites dedicated to the analysis of the convoluted and sometimes complicated plot of Serial Experiments Lain.

However, you should be aware that some people still don't understand Lain's powers or how the ""god of the wired"" fits into anything at all.  Be prepared to watch this series multiple times to understand it.But this is an important anime about religion and the truth.  Lain is a girl in her early teens who sees strange images.  Images blur into child-like sketches.  Steam floats out of her hands into a mysterious web over her in the classroom.  Her friend, Chisa Yomoda, dropped off a building and died.  Yet, she still sent an e-mail that said that she hadn't died.  She merely lost her body in order to integrate herself into the wired world (the internet).Lain discovers that she is a powerful girl, capable of transfiguring the real world via her mind.  Although the series doesn't specify how she can do it, her mind is capable of changing events in the real world from her consciousness in the wired.  She also learns that other people are using the wired to kill girls and boys with games and programs.  This group of technology freaks is known as Knights.  The Knights are led by an old scientist who committed suicide to integrate himself as the god of the wired.If this sounds twisted and confusing to you, don't worry.  This series, by design, is meant to confuse people at first.  The language can also confound people who aren't into technology, because the characters talk about ""databases"", ""protocols"", and fancy processors and data compressers.  However, for anyone who is willing to watch this series multiple times, they will see that Lain is a small girl who is willing to do anything to stop the Knights and destroy any bad memories of herself from her friends.I believe that this is one of the most important anime series of all time, and one of my absolute favorites.  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" forces people to think about how the world of the internet can nearly take over our own lives.  Do you feel like the internet is your only release from social pressures in the real world?

562583,AAU1RHVZCRCL,B00005094P,Kehnin Dyer,"[0, 2]","This is the show that got made it impossible for me to turn back.I had watched many other series of anime before this one, but none had so thoroughly spoke to me as this one did.I cannot rate this series highly enough.It was very sad for me a couple of years ago to go back and watch my DVDs of this series to find i was unable to deal with the interlasing and terrible resolution... i suppose all the new HD anime has really flavored my tastes. So i was understandably overjoyed to find that there was a blueray release in japan, and while i was saving up for it this happens!EDITS:Physical media:This set comes with the restoration book, a huge art book, and dvd and blue ray discs. The books are good quality glossy paper, with cardstock covers. the restoration cover is glossy and the book contains some great color images and a conversation between Saito and Ueda about the problems that occured in each episode on trying to make the release HD. It is quite the gem. the art book's cover is a bit thicker than the restore book and matte. The matte finish gives it a good feel, but it makes it prone to finger prints, especially on the back which is dark blue. This book contains LOADS of line art pictures. there are profile and expressions for every character, including most side characters. there are also scenes and devices. I am really loving the art book.The bluerays have episodes 1-9 on disk 1 and 10-13 on disk 2,dvds have 1-7 on disk 1 and 8-13 on disk 2.im not exactly sure why this is because there are no real differences otherwise. the bluerays do have a different menu that kinda looks like windows 3.1... and the dvds have a standard menu, but the special features are all the same, so why not have the same number of episodes on each disk? just weird.Another strange thing is that the dvds are in a blu-ray case. it makes the set look cohesive, but it also makes it harder to tell the blu-rays from the dvds. I would have prefered the release to not use standard 2 disk cases opting instead for a custom 4 disk case with some artwork on it, like the japanese release.Video:The video quality is good. especially when compared to the 98 pioneer release. i am glad i have that set so i can correctly compare. the new dvds are much, much better than the old ones. i do like that the pioneer release had different menus for each of the 4 discs, but the menu on the new release is generally nicer... it doesn't have that old shadowing effects that were common on late 90's websites for one. The New dvds are down converts of the blu-ray.i'll say that again. The DVDs are down converts of the Blu-ray.the compression is SO much better, the style is smoother, the color is more balanced. If you havn't seen the old release you probably wouldn't really tell, but the difference is stunning.as for the Blu-rays, i could go on forever. The difference between the old dvds and the blu-rays is freaking huge. The only thing is sometimes the lines almost seem too sharp. i mean they went back to the cells and did it by hand, but they didn't redo the cells, so when there were mistakes they become very apparent. i feel like i really like that aspect of it, but i can see that if it were blurry then it might be more likeable to some people. i dunno.The image is the same aspect as it has always been, 4:3 which is fine for me, better that than cut into the frame and lose detail.audio:the audio is pretty much the same. 2.0 dual channel audio. the subs are boring to look at, which is a shame. it would have been nice to see embedded subs for the text portions.. but that isn't really sound related.the music is just as mood setting and creepy as always.special features:the only new thing is the trailers for different funimation shows, and the American commercial for the Blu-ray box. really the pioneer set has more. all the Japanese tv commercials that this set has was there, and there was dev art as well. i suppose tho it works out because the development art is in the Art book. They really could have done alot with the extra space tho, especially for the blu-ray... like half the disc at least is empty.all in all i have to say this set is a great deal for anyone who likes this series at all. the collection of great stuff would make any collector happy.-we are all connected.",5,Close this world.

562584,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00005094P,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Lain is not your average school girl. She's detached, boring, and not very into technology. All that changes when a classmate of hers kills herself. Lain and her friends receive postmortem e-mails from her saying that she has merely left her body and now lives within the ""Wired"". The Wired is an evolved form of the internet. Lain is intrigued by this event and begins to explore The Wired.When she gets involved with The Wired, Lain discovers that it is more than just a network of electrical signals. It is more like a living thing. A living thing with a will. Is it god? Is it an alternate Universe? Who the hell knows? I think it may be all of those. Lain discovers the truth behind her existence, the existence of the Wired, and their relationship to the real world.This anime all all kinds of weird. It's older, so the animation is kinda odd. It's from the creator of Haibane Renmei; and it's obvious from the character designs. I had to try very hard to get through the first 5 episodes. It bored me to death and made me angry. Once things began to unfold, I started to appreciate it. This is one of those artsy/experimental shows. It's totally philosophical ans psychological. There is not much action or drama. It moves painfully slow. Most of the characters are very one dimensional and have no personality. Lain and here family are especially boring people.The psychological elements of this story are the main focus. The characters teeter back and forth on the frayed edges of sanity. What is real? What is not? What is the truth? These things drive the characters to the edge. It takes a toll on your brain as you watch the characters explore their world. The animation and soundtrack also gnaw at your patience. There is a lot of static and ""white noise"" going through the speakers.I respect this series for it's depth and creativity, but I just don't like it. The story is deep and thought provoking, the animation is unique, but it's a major chore to watch. If I rated it according to how much enjoyment I got out of it; I would give it 2 stars. That isn't a fair rating though. If I'm trying to be objective, I'll give it 4 stars. It is a long shot from 5 stars, but it is a great piece of art and storytelling. There is nothing to get attached to in this series, so it's hard to fall in love with it. If you remember the ending of the Evangelion TV series; where the characters pretty much get a psyche evaluation, you can get a relative idea of what this anime is like. It's like watching the final Evangelion episode for 5 hours. I can't recommend buying this anime without watching it first. If you're interested in it, most definitely watch it online or rent it first. I bought it before I saw it, based on all the 5 star reviews. It pisses me off that everyone raved about something that was so subjective. I really wish I had watched it before buying. I can't stress it enough: WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY. YOU MAY LOVE IT, YOU MAY HATE IT.Review of the product:This is an excellent release(5 stars). It comes with both Blu-ray and DVD versions in separate cases. The box is very sturdy and has beautiful artwork. There is a small booklet inside with commentary for each episode. There is also a really big art book inside. Personally, I think the art book is kind of a waste of space and unnecessary, but if you're paying out the ass for something like this, you may as well get something extra. Overall, this special edition is probably only gonna interest major fans of the series. It's a great box set.",4,"What, Or Who Is Wired?",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3524,"['Lain', 'not', 'average', 'school', 'girl', 'detached', 'boring', 'not', 'very', 'technology', 'changes', 'when', 'classmate', 'hers', 'kills', 'Lain', 'friends', 'receive', 'postmortem', 'e-mails', 'saying', 'merely', 'left', 'body', 'now', 'Wired', 'Wired', 'evolved', 'form', 'internet', 'Lain', 'intrigued', 'event', 'explore', 'Wired.When', 'involved', 'Wired', 'Lain', 'more', 'just', 'network', 'electrical', 'signals', 'more', 'living', 'thing', 'living', 'thing', 'will', 'Is', 'god', 'alternate', 'Universe', 'Who', 'hell', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'Lain', 'truth', 'existence', 'existence', 'Wired', 'relationship', 'real', 'world.This', 'anime', 'kinds', 'weird', 'older', 'animation', 'kinda', 'odd', 'creator', 'Haibane', 'Renmei', 'obvious', 'character', 'designs', 'had', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'bored', 'death', 'made', 'angry', 'Once', 'things', 'began', 'unfold', 'started', 'appreciate', 'one', 'artsy/experimental', 'shows', 'totally', 'philosophical', 'ans', 'psychological', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'drama', 'painfully', 'slow', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'have', 'personality', 'Lain', 'here', 'family', 'are', 'especially', 'boring', 'people.The', 'psychological', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'characters', 'teeter', 'back', 'forth', 'frayed', 'edges', 'sanity', 'What', 'real', 'What', 'not', 'What', 'truth', 'things', 'drive', 'characters', 'edge', 'toll', 'brain', 'watch', 'characters', 'explore', 'world', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'patience', 'lot', 'static', 'white', 'noise', 'going', 'speakers.I', 'respect', 'series', 'depth', 'creativity', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'deep', 'thought', 'provoking', 'animation', 'unique', 'major', 'chore', 'watch', 'rated', 'according', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'would', 'give', '2', 'stars', ""n't"", 'fair', 'rating', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'objective', ""'ll"", 'give', '4', 'stars', 'long', 'shot', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'storytelling', 'nothing', 'get', 'attached', 'series', 'hard', 'fall', 'love', 'remember', 'ending', 'Evangelion', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'psyche', 'evaluation', 'can', 'get', 'relative', 'idea', 'what', 'anime', 'watching', 'final', 'Evangelion', 'episode', '5', 'hours', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'anime', 'watching', 'first', ""'re"", 'interested', 'most', 'definitely', 'watch', 'rent', 'first', 'bought', 'saw', 'based', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'off', 'everyone', 'raved', 'something', 'was', 'so', 'subjective', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'watched', 'buying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'WATCH', 'YOU', 'BUY', 'YOU', 'MAY', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'YOU', 'MAY', 'HATE', 'IT.Review', 'product', 'excellent', 'release', '5', 'stars', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'versions', 'separate', 'cases', 'box', 'very', 'sturdy', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'small', 'booklet', 'commentary', 'episode', 'also', 'really', 'big', 'art', 'book', 'inside', 'Personally', 'think', 'art', 'book', 'kind', 'waste', 'space', 'unnecessary', ""'re"", 'paying', 'out', 'ass', 'something', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'something', 'extra', 'Overall', 'special', 'edition', 'probably', 'only', 'gon', 'interest', 'major', 'fans', 'series', 'great', 'box', 'set']",Lain: Serial Experiments

It is a tightly worked study of innocence lost and the inherent destructiveness of the virtual 'wired' mindset.  Using the story of Lain, a girl on the verge of womanhood, the series follows her 'adventures' in a Wonderland gone amok.  Not so much a coming of age story as a warning that too much knowledge can be poisonous.When we meet Lain she is a computer ing&eacute;nue, uncomfortable even using her Navi to talk to friends.  Gradually Lain and the world within the computer become enmeshed.  Almost without here awareness, her online persona takes on a style of its own - louder, more cynical, possible even evil.  Lain finds that she is not sure which personality she really is, assuming that she is either one.  The series spins layer upon layer, until the viewer is no more positive than is Lain.I am not going to dig any further into the plot, since I have reviewed the individual DVDs elsewhere.  But I can promise that the story is both predictable and unpredictable.  A tragic whimsy where final nirvana is played in somber tones.  An extraordinary essay in the visual arts.The artwork and music for this series are as exceptional as the story.  Visual and aural clues abound on a symbol-ridden landscape.  Stylistically it uses static backgrounds with foreground animation to present a continually graphic effect.  Both the progression of scenes and the images presented are complex, demanding viewer attention.Lain has had a cult following for some time (it won the excellence prize in Japan's 1998 Media Art Festival) but has come to US audiences slowly.  This is a beautiful, experimental piece of film work.  If that interests you than you will no doubt want the whole series.

But this description would only scratch the surface, and below that we find a rich and complex plot that transports the viewer through an array of emotions and states of mind. At times you will be baffled, at others elated, and in between you will try to grasp the tiny details that make this one of the most enigmatic series I have ever watched.The story starts when a young girl kills herself and soon afterwards her classmates start to get emails from the deceased. Lain is one of the students getting the messages, and she is an introverted kid who has problems relating to others. This results in Lain being eager to understand more about the mysterious ""ghost"" and learn about The Wired, which is a world that allows people to escape reality (similar to our Web). But what happens when the two worlds start merging, and what people though was fiction begins to affect their lives?As the series progresses, the duality between The Wired and the real world virtually disappears, and the effects are extremely interesting to observe. Questions will begin to pop-up in your head, in similar vein to those presented in ""The Matrix"". At some points, the series may get complex and confuse you, but keep at it, the rewards are worth the ""pain"".It is not usual to find films in this genre that deal so well with psychological and existential issues, and even those that did not like this series have to recognize that at least it possess originality and deviates from the standard path followed by so many anime directors (evil vs. good with lots of fights and blood).In terms of the graphics, you will not find anything extraordinary there, especially in terms of the settings, since the level of detail is rather poor. But I believe that this was probably done on purpose, since in this way the viewer is be forced to focus her attention on the more important aspects of the story. Some people may also find the series a bit slow at times, but I think the slow pace in these moments is warranted since its usage serves the purpose of getting us to think about the consequences of what we are observing. This was also done wonderfully in the masterpiece ""Grave of the Fireflies"".I believe that this is a must see for anime fans, since you will find a whole array of new and interesting concepts being used.

Its crazy dialogue, stark visuals, disturbing imagery, thought-provoking themes, and often confusing plot lines engages its audience to the limits.

The first episode started off very slow but as each one went on and on the show grew on me and ended up very well. I was very happy with this purchase and it made a wonderful addition to my collection. It shows a very real fear in peoples lives when it comes to the internet and acceptance in society. Can we really control peoples prospective mirrored onto our self about our self?. Very well done. Also the main character is one of the best personalities I have seen in a while. The story did start off slow but it really sucks you in fast. It makes you think and it is refreshing to see an anime do this.

It not only includes the 4 DVDs of the whole series, but you get a lunch box and a limited edition CD of Boa, the group that sings the theme song to the series. It has four songs on it and the theme song really gets stuck in your head. I did, unfortunatley, bought mine for $119.99 at a mall so I didn't really save anything:lunch box................. $ 10limited edition CD.... $ 104 DVDs................... $100Watching the entire series of Lain while eating out of your cool new lunch box and listening to the theme song over and over..... priceless.(Sorry! Was given the opportunity and had to do it.) Besides, I would never eat out of the lunchbox, it is too nice and in great condition. I use it to store the Lain series inside if it.I have to say this is a really good series. I think it's rated for viewers 16 and up. I would have to say that is a suitable. There is nothing too bad in it to make it unsuitable for younger teens except for the fact that people commit suicide, the regular pervertedness and love you'll find on most anime, and that there is realastic blood in it, and that people go insane and crazy. But some of the concepts and things they talk about little kids would not understand and would not enjoy it. It took me a little while to understand it, and my friend watched part of it with me and I had to attempt to explain a few parts of it to her. This anime is deep and has some philosphical and psychological aspects to it. Plus religion is tied into it, I know the obvious ways religion it tied into it but I can't figure out or see the deeper picture.It is sort of like the Matrix. Two different worlds that only a few people know about and &quot;The One&quot; is the chosen one to be able to cross between the two worlds freely. Like Neo, Lain knows and can do what normal people can not. Like in the Matrix, the general public are just puppets to be used and that all your family is not really your family but rather just put there by a computer. Only the few exceptional people are hackers that work together, but get hunted down by the officials like in the Matrix. And like Neo, both sides try to Lain to their advantage.Anyway, it was a great series and I watched the entire series all in one sitting. It's a big change from watching Sailor Moon and Card Captors. As you can see, I'm not the intelligent, articulate, kind of person.

562610,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B00005094P,Suzanne,"[6, 6]","THE STORY:Beyond the soft hum of information passing through cables, beyond the gentle glow of computer screens there lies another world. The world of the Wired. Lain is an introverted, but otherwise seemingly normal 13 year old girl. When a classmate commits suicide, and everyone from her school starts receiving e-mails from her, Lain becomes increasingly interested in the world of the Wired. The Wired is akin to our internet - accessed by computers called NAVIs. Lain asks her father for a new NAVI, and it doesn't take long before the barrier between the ""Real World"" and ""The Wired"" starts crumbling. What is the Wired? What is the Real World? Who is Lain? The only common theme you will find is that:""We're All Connected.""REVIEW:The one common word you will read/hear used to describe Lain is ""weird"". Yes, it is that, but it's much more. Being a Japanese anime, I can't be completely sure what its influences are, but Lain very much reminded me of a David Lynch approach applied to anThe X-Filesseason with bits and pieces ofAkira,Ghost in the Shell, andEvangelionthrown in. The thing that will throw most off is the completely abnormal narrative of Lain. We're shown inexplicable things without explanation, opaque symbolism crops up everywhere, and all the while the viewer is left to wonder ""Just what is real?"" and ""Just what the hell is going on?"".To those used to Lynch's approach to film-making - especially something likeMulholland Drive- Lain MIGHT not be so confusing. That's because you become used to spotting ""red herrings"", so to speak, and understand that everything you're shown - no matter how emphasized at the time - may be inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. The best advice I could offer when going into Lain is to have no pre-conceived notions about what is or should be real or important. Let the narrative flow and if you simply take things as they come, without analyzing them, it will seem much less confusing than some make it out to be.The animation quality in Lain is rather unspectacular. However, I'd say the visuals throughout are quite good. The animators play off dark/light themes with colors splashing the darkness to create a really psychedelic feeling which perfectly matches the mood of the series. This semi-minimalistic approach works extremely well and adds to the sense of mounting ominousness throughout. From the very beginning they're able to use this approach to create a sense of disconnect and discontent between both Lain and the Real World and the viewer and Lain's world.The pacing is incredibly slow. If you feel the need for alot (or any, really) action in your anime, steer clear  from Lain. At times, Lain is so slow it feels as if its standing still in its own dream-like world. If it's one negative thing I could say about Lain it's that the pacing is just a bit too inchoate at times, seemingly lacking direction or real motion. This was perhaps done intentionally to create the effect of being in some kind of dream - or at least being disconnected from anything that's real. It only ""flows"" in its own dream-like trance towards its ending, although at times you'll be wondering how it arrived there.Lain will overload you with information. Government conspiracies, Aliens, nano-technology, psychic children experiments, secretive organizations both real and fictional, powerful computer programs and protocols... One episode interlaces the narrative with a history of certain scientific discoveries - and the people and organizations behind them. After viewing it, one wonders how everything connects. I'd be daft if I said that by the end, it all connects in a very neat, coherent manner. However, an astute viewer will likely be able to link most of the references to the fictional world of Lain in a roundabout manner. I'm convinced that most everything referenced plays an important part either as influence or to the direct narrative, but linking it all together would be difficult.The ideas discussed throughout Lain are fairly extensive. Many are only touched on, but others go a little deeper. Just some of the ideas include the subjective nature of reality and self, commincation and the collective connectivity, the role of information both in a tangible and intangible sense (memory). Basically, there's the more tangible ideas discussed in the latter paragraph, and the more intangible ideas discussed in this one. In the end, you're left with a very complex and multi-layered narrative that just begs for exploration. Even if you're able to extract the main ideas on first viewing (like I was), you'll likely want to enter the world of Lain again to discover even more.Are there other negatives I could find about the series? Only a few. The ending is rather disappointing after all that's lead up to it. This is mostly a pacing and amount of content problem. You'll find many anime series have this problem where they run out of ideas to fill episode time near the end, so they have to find a way to stretch things out. Lain does this quite badly. The actual ""ending"" just goes on too long, and doesn't give a sense of closure. Evangelion had the same problem with the TV ending, which is a big reason why they had to create the film to give fans that sense of closure. I'd also say it's only slightly disappointing from a dramatic standpoint. From the beginning there's this sense of ominous foreboding. Something big is brewing and poor Lain is right in the midst of it. But by the end, the ""big evil"" off in the distance didn't seem so bad afterall.Even with a lack of adept pacing and a dramatic ending that gives a sense of closure (for my tastes) only amounts to small complaints. They're small when one realizes how truly rich the rest of Lain is. All in all, Lain still remains a highly influential and extremely original anime. It might've borrowed from many that came before it, but it melded and morphed into something that was completely new and different. For that it deserves all the praise it gets. Even though I can't say it is perfect, it is still superb. I even feel the creators have gone on to take the ideas and style they cultivated with Lain and utilized it to greater and more mature effects in future works such asTexhnolyze. But I still highly recommend this series to those looking for something truly unique, original, and yes, ""weird"" in the world of anime.DVD REVIEW:This set is fairly bare-bones. 4 discs featuring very little in the way of extras. No anamorphic widescreen, no 5.1. I imagine it won't be long before Lain is given a fairly lavish makeover and re-issued for its 10th anniversary. However, the current price makes up for the lack of goodies.",4,"If Nobody Remembers Me, Did I Ever Exist?",1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,6683,"['STORY', 'soft', 'hum', 'information', 'passing',

562612,A17B9MOP3FIJUF,B00005094P,"The Loved One ""curiouser and curiouser!""","[6, 8]","Back, back, back in ancient times, the captivating Sphinx posed Oedipus her famous riddle: what has four legs in the morning, two legs in the midday sun, and three legs in the evening?  Of course, the answer is a human being.  While this riddle has unfortunately become somewhat of a clich&eacute;, the Sphinx implicitly presented a question that has been at the heart of Greek and modern philosophy: What is a man?  In these later stages of the world's history, questions such as ""When is a man not a man?"" and ""What makes a man a man?"" have yet to be satisfactorily answered; in the end, the Sphinx may have the last laugh.  Arguably, these basic questions of human identity have become even more imperative given new developments in technology and artificial intelligence.  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" courageously and humbly dares to weigh in on these crucial and complex issues.What is most fascinating about ""Lain"" is how it approaches the conception the ""self.""  Our first glance of Lain occurs in an overexposed scene flushed with light: she opens the door to her house and tentatively steps onto her porch and down a flight of stairs.  The series progresses from a Lain who is withdrawn and insular to a Lain who embarks on a terrifying odyssey into the Wired, a futuristic and more encompassing incarnation of our Inter Web.  As she integrates herself further and further into the Wired, her identity begins to splinter.  Nakamura provocatively invites us to explore the nature of the ""self:"" is Lain still Lain even if she only exists in fragments?A byzantine and labyrinthine narration accompanies and mimics Lain's faltering sense of self.  It immerses the viewer in a world of violence, danger, possibility, seclusion, and thinly veiled sexual tides.  Japanese society and the geographical island of Japan itself create a particularly adept ambience for this series of intense schizophrenic realism:  Japan is a nation of gross arrogance and abject humility; a culture that fosters both a collective mentality but can spawns morbid introverts, and a society that is overflowing with information (or more precisely ""infonography"") but has been stricken by collective amnesia for the last fifty years.  Its landmass is small and claustrophobic while providing more than enough aesthetic and conceptual area for terrifying hidden worlds and lonely paradises.The Anime world has recently witnessed a plethora of series that deal with these hidden worlds with a distinct emphasis on visions of the apocalypse.  ""Lain"" is no different.  The most immediate example of mass obliteration is ""End of Evangelion.""  Many have accused ""Lain"" of plagiarizing ""EoE's"" central themes.  Some of the criticism is well founded, but ""Lain"" is far from a slavish imitator of ""EoE's"" prophecy of a devastated wasteland: ""Lain"" delivers a much more optimistic verdict of humanity's future.  Whereas Hideaki Anno's pessimism robs us of any possibility of renewal within our time, ""Lain"" contends that the Self is a protean and enduring being capable of escaping annihilation.  Ryutaro Nakamura suggests that salvation lies in simple displays of kindness and empathy, acts that give Lain the faith to pursue the terrifying truth of her identity and the power to dispel the false gods.  In the end, expressions of compassion and humanity may be the true measure of a person.  It may just be what makes a human a human.",5,Teddy Bear Pajamas rock the spot,1051488000,"04 28, 2003",2003,3404,"['Back', 'back', 'back', 'ancient', 'times', 'captivating', 'Sphinx', 'posed', 'Oedipus', 'famous', 'riddle', 'what', 'four', 'legs', 'morning', 'two', 'legs', 'midday', 'sun', 'three', 'legs', 'evening', 'course', 'answer', 'human', 'being', 'riddle', 'unfortunately', 'become', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Sphinx', 'implicitly', 'presented', 'question', 'been', 'heart', 'Greek', 'modern', 'philosophy', 'What', 'man', 'later', 'stages', 'world', 'history', 'questions', 'such', 'When', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'What', 'man', 'man', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'satisfactorily', 'answered', 'end', 'Sphinx', 'may', 'have', 'last', 'laugh', 'Arguably', 'basic', 'questions', 'human', 'identity', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'imperative', 'given', 'new', 'developments', 'technology', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'courageously', 'humbly', 'dares', 'weigh', 'crucial', 'complex', 'issues.What', 'most', 'fascinating', 'Lain', 'how', 'conception', 'self', 'first', 'glance', 'Lain', 'occurs', 'overexposed', 'scene', 'flushed', 'light', 'door', 'house', 'tentatively', 'steps', 'porch', 'flight', 'stairs', 'series', 'Lain', 'who', 'withdrawn', 'insular', 'Lain', 'who', 'terrifying', 'odyssey', 'Wired', 'futuristic', 'more', 'encompassing', 'incarnation', 'Inter', 'Web', 'further', 'further', 'Wired', 'identity', 'splinter', 'Nakamura', 'provocatively', 'explore', 'nature', 'self', 'Lain', 'still', 'Lain', 'even', 'only', 'fragments', 'byzantine', 'labyrinthine', 'narration', 'accompanies', 'mimics', 'Lain', 'faltering', 'sense', 'self', 'viewer', 'world', 'violence', 'danger', 'possibility', 'seclusion', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'sexual', 'tides', 'Japanese', 'society', 'geographical', 'island', 'Japan', 'create', 'particularly', 'adept', 'ambience', 'series', 'intense', 'schizophrenic', 'realism', 'Japan', 'nation', 'gross', 'arrogance', 'abject', 'humility', 'culture', 'collective', 'mentality', 'can', 'spawns', 'morbid', 'introverts', 'society', 'overflowing', 'information', 'more', 'precisely', 'infonography', 'been', 'stricken', 'collective', 'amnesia', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'landmass', 'small', 'claustrophobic', 'providing', 'more', 'enough', 'aesthetic', 'conceptual', 'area', 'terrifying', 'hidden', 'worlds', 'lonely', 'paradises.The', 'Anime', 'world', 'recently', 'witnessed', 'plethora', 'series', 'deal', 'hidden', 'worlds', 'distinct', 'emphasis', 'visions', 'apocalypse', 'Lain', 'different', 'most', 'immediate', 'example', 'mass', 'obliteration', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'Many', 'have', 'accused', 'Lain', 'plagiarizing', 'EoE', 'central', 'themes', 'criticism', 'well', 'founded', 'Lain', 'far', 'slavish', 'imitator', 'EoE', 'prophecy', 'devastated', 'wasteland', 'Lain', 'much', 'more', 'optimistic', 'verdict', 'humanity', 'future', 'Whereas', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'pessimism', 'possibility', 'renewal', 'time', 'Lain', 'Self', 'protean', 'enduring', 'being', 'capable', 'escaping', 'annihilation', 'Ryutaro', 'Nakamura', 'salvation', 'simple', 'displays', 'kindness', 'empathy', 'give', 'Lain', 'faith', 'pursue', 'terrifying', 'truth', 'identity', 'power', 'dispel', 'false', 'gods', 'end', 'expressions', 'compassion', 'humanity', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'measure', 'person', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'what', 'human', 'human']",Lain: Serial Experiments
562613,A2XMNT0L80O4VD,B00005094P,Theobalt,"[15, 74]","My 1 star comes without anger, or snobism or anything. I didn't curse it but watched it patienly and accepted the bad and the good stuf that it had. But I have to think twice the next time I consult amazon for buying an anime because there is definetly something wrong with the people reviewing some of the anime (Evangelion is the first paradox but I would speak about it with curses and stuff like that (0 stars) while I respect Lain).So I would also like to think that people who write these reviews don't belong to those who created the anime because that would suck a lot. Whatever this is what I think about Lain1. ANIMATION. Stop bothering about the animation. I always read animation is good, bad, fantastic etc. From my experience if the story is good animation is the least factor that one should consider when buying an anime. (For example when I watched the first episode of Gilgamesh which really sucked concerning animation the story draw my attention in following it-Lain don't really) In our case the animation is in simple scetches, with bright colors and in general its quit good and enjoyable to watch. The directing is also very good keeping in mind that the director hasn't much to show due to the slow pace of the story.2. STORY. Lol first of all how can you read reviews buy guys and (children mostly I believe) who don't get the story. They say its too much complicated, strange, difficult etc. The story isn't complicated at all. Add to the general story that you ready in the dvd a couple of sentences and you have the entire story!!! However, its the way the story is presented here that it tends to confuse you and think -Oh I missed that- etc.The whole concept is ok and a fine idea. But put into action they really mess up as they try to spread a 2 or 3 episode story into 13! I am sorry to dissapoint you but you don't have a clue guys.Add to the basic theme some philosophical issues raised by the characters which get repetitive and in the end miss the whole point of even being mentioned ---they talk and talk about theological, or moral issues but only in theory as in the end they are nowhere found to be implemented.Only in the last 3 episodes the story seems to progress a while and give a ""revelation""which is not really such a big deal. While watching the episodes I kept thinking how they seem to get the idea of an episode of x-files where a guy uploads his personality into the computers and lives through the internet etc. They throw some more ideas and they have the story where some poor kids don't understand squat and think that OW THESE GUYS KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. There are no hidden messages. Just because they throw some words and ideas like the collective subconsiousness doesn't mean they know what they do!!!SPOILER So the story is about LAIN whose first episodes are a false reality as she really exists only in the ""internet"" but gets a taste of the real word which is connected to the internet world until she realizes what she really is and how she can affect both worlds. Of course you have to assume all these as they keep on throwing some mixed ideas, that their aim is to get you confused.THIS DVD IS DEFINETELY RATED R--->for presenting suicidal ideas, and what might be for some people offensive theological issues.To sum I expected to whatch something clever really, with a good story being a bit originall. It should be clear to me though that when the people review it a say it was ""strange, confusing, complicated, difficult, don't understand much"" then something must be wrong.Again it could be a good anime, had potention but people messed it up. How can you give a high review to something you don't understand. My understanding is that they tried to insulted my intelligence by creating a story while there is none to be told.",1,Something is wrong with the reviews on anime....,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,3828,"['1', 'star', 'anger', 'snobism', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'curse', 'watched', 'patienly', 'accepted', 'bad', 'good', 'stuf', 'had', 'have', 'think', 'twice', 'next', 'time', 'consult', 'amazon', 'buying', 'anime', 'definetly', 'something', 'wrong', 'people', 'reviewing', 'anime', 'Evangelion', 'first', 'paradox', 'would', 'speak', 'curses', 'stuff', '0', 'stars', 'respect', 'Lain', '.So', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'who', 'created', 'anime', 'would', 'suck', 'lot', 'what', 'think', 'Lain1', 'ANIMATION', 'Stop', 'bothering', 'animation', 'always', 'read', 'animation', 'good', 'bad', 'fantastic', 'etc', 'experience', 'story', 'good', 'animation', 'least', 'factor', 'one', 'should', 'consider', 'when', 'buying', 'anime', 'example', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'Gilgamesh', 'really', 'sucked', 'concerning', 'animation', 'story', 'draw', 'attention', 'following', 'it-Lain', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'case', 'animation', 'simple', 'scetches', 'bright', 'colors', 'general', 'quit', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'directing', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'keeping', 'mind', 'director', ""n't"", 'much', 'show', 'due', 'slow', 'pace', 'story.2', 'STORY', 'Lol', 'first', 'how', 'can', 'read', 'reviews', 'buy', 'guys', 'children', 'mostly', 'believe', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'story', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'complicated', 'strange', 'difficult', 'etc', 'story', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'Add', 'general', 'story', 'ready', 'dvd', 'couple', 'sentences', 'have', 'entire', 'story', 'However', 'way', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'confuse', 'think', '-Oh', 'missed', 'that-', 'etc.The', 'whole', 'concept', 'ok', 'fine', 'idea', 'put', 'action', 'really', 'mess', 'up', 'try', 'spread', '2', '3', 'episode', 'story', '13', 'am', 'sorry', 'dissapoint', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'guys.Add', 'basic', 'theme', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'raised', 'characters', 'get', 'repetitive', 'end', 'whole', 'point', 'even', 'being', 'mentioned', '-they', 'talk', 'talk', 'theological', 'moral', 'issues', 'only', 'theory', 'end', 'are', 'nowhere', 'found', 'be', 'implemented.Only', 'last', '3', 'story', 'progress', 'while', 'give', 'revelation', 'not', 'really', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'watching', 'episodes', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'seem', 'get', 'idea', 'episode', 'x-files', 'where', 'guy', 'personality', 'computers', 'internet', 'etc', 'throw', 'more', 'ideas', 'have', 'story', 'where', 'poor', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'squat', 'think', 'OW', 'THESE', 'GUYS', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'DOING', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'THINK', 'IT', 'are', 'hidden', 'messages', 'Just', 'throw', 'words', 'ideas', 'collective', 'subconsiousness', ""n't"", 'mean', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'SPOILER', 'story', 'LAIN', 'first', 'episodes', 'are', 'false', 'reality', 'really', 'only', 'internet', 'taste', 'real', 'word', 'connected', 'internet', 'world', 'what', 'really', 'how', 'can', 'affect', 'worlds', 'course', 'have', 'assume', 'keep', 'throwing', 'mixed', 'ideas', 'aim', 'get', 'confused.THIS', 'DVD', 'IS', 'DEFINETELY', 'RATED', 'R', '>', 'presenting', 'suicidal', 'ideas', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'people', 'offensive', 'theological', 'issues.To', 'sum', 'expected', 'whatch', 'something', 'clever', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'being', 'bit', 'originall', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'when', 'people', 'review', 'say', 'was', 'strange', 'confusing', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'then', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'anime', 'had', 'potention', 'people', 'messed', 'up', 'How', 'can', 'give', 'high', 'review', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'understanding', 'tried', 'insulted', 'intelligence', 'creating', 'story', 'none', 'be', 'told']",Lain: Serial Experiments

As the product description describes that the episodes are literally dragged out, indeed they are. If you simply do not have the testing-the-waters-patience to wait for 13 totally episodes of cliff-hangers, avoid this title. Otherwise read on.-The Animation-The animation in Lain is neither grainy nor terrible. Do not however, except the shiny-rub polish of 2009 animes. Since the story focuses around the internet, the characters and their worlds are portrayed mostly in a 2D coloring and shading. Expect Patlabor 2: The Movie graphics here in a more updated verison. At times some of the worlds are interesting, such as the internet world. There are several episodes when lain's shadow is casted in a animated mirror/shadow of swirling/ red vortex.-----------------The Plot---------------------------------------""Present day, heh, Present Time Hahahaha!""-Serial Experiment Lain Episode Introduction*Note: Due to the series long plot I will be splitting this review into sections for easy viewing.-Introduction-We start out with the main character, Lain. Apparently one of Lain's fellow classmates commits suicide by jumping off of a building. It is then upon that that Lain receives an e-mail from the 'dead girl'. Out of curiosity Lain receives a device that can connect her to the Wired world. Unknowingly though, this very device is the reason why Lain's world is turned upside down. As stated before there are many, many cliff-hangers in this series. This was the most frustrating aspect of this anime. Questions are constantly left unanswered by the characters repetitively to the point that it becomes annoying. Whether Lain ask a question, it goes unanswered, especially questions about herself.Another downfall of this series is the whack-out proportion between reality and non-reality. There are many times when Lain is talking in the real world then suddenly the plot will switch back to the 'virtual world' as though she was still in the real world. This can make the series confusing to anyone that isn't paying attention to fine details. This can be a benefiting technique but when used repetitively it defeats the purposes, especially if you end up loosing your audience due to a choppy transition. This series wreaks of this until the very final episodes.-The Break-down of Family ties-In the beginning Lain's sister is being attacked by a group called the 'Knights' who constantly have been harassing her by the weakening of the two worlds. The 'wired world' has enough power now to influence people and events in the real world. Lain's sister, being their victim. Spamming her constantly with words such as ""Fullfill the prophecy"" until she cracks mentally. I found it idiotic how Lain throughout the entire series couldn't notice the mental-breakdown of her sister even though she had seen her many times. Not only that but the stale acting of Lain's parents is poor. They literally ignore Lain's sister throughout this entire stage, and even when she's spazzing out ""beeping"" noises due to her instability. Both Lain and her parent's showed no concern/emotion for their family members which I found to be totally unrealistic. The only time sadly that Lain's father shows any feeling is towards Lain when he discovers her wired-filled room. He's shocked by the amount of equipment in the room and attempts to 'say' something but as always, no one says anything and lets things be. That was the last time he showed any emotion towards her in the real world.-Enemies of the Real World-On the other hand Lain discovers this group named 'Knights'. Apparently they were some sort of hacker group that was causing chaos in the real world. Yet on the other hand they found extreme interest in Lain in her ability to obtain her form and influence in the virtual world. Everyone else in the world comes out as yes, body-parts (such as ears, eyes, lips and even arms) but never full-bodies. They have been imposing as to be ""Lain"" on several occasions, such as Lain being seen in the sky glowing yellow with the clouds parted as a so-called God, or her being a 'peeping tom' or her on television after a car-wreck. These 'Lains' however are not the real-world lain herself, but the 'Lains' from the memories of everyone. Or simply to put it, what they want Lain to be. It doesn't help either when Lain becomes so addictive to the wire that she's surfing the internet during class and hooking wires over herself in her room for countless hours that we never see her actually 'eat' or take a 'break', despite her 'only' friend, Asuri's concern. In the beginning they seem to be Lain's friends, but later she discovers that she was being used as nothing more than a playtoy to them. When she disagrees to their antics, they try to destroy lain by sending her a global virus that blows the windows out of her room. However lain escapes this by the help of mysterious  men-in-black (no pun intended). Lain ask them who they are, and in a contradictory fashion they say they are 'Knights' but are not the 'Knights' in the virtual world. There's been a dialogue issue here, as the real-world knights are nothing more than a collection of average to coporate-people using those 'pyscho chips' that were trying to make Lain like their God.-The History of Protocol 7 and KIDS-We discover through Lain's investigation that an old man labled as the 'child killer' was the start of the 'internet merging' circumstances. Apparently he was experiencing with the 'untapped' mental state of human children and focusing this energy into 'psychic' energy that be harnessed to create one information system. This however, caused too much energy and caused the plant to backfire, destroying all the children in the process. Lain is upset at his lack-of-heart attitude but the man says that there is 'nothing he can do to bring them back'. Then why is he resting in a hospital in a paradise world (using the Wire) than rotting in a cell? This anime never ceases to amaze me with again, the lack of care for anybody. It is then when this anime takes facts from the real world (yes, our real world. History books opened please) about gimmicks about how the entire 'Alien Theory' started and the very beginnings of how the internet was being established before missing it into the gooble-ge-gook of the anime's plot.-Wipe Out-The group known as 'Knights' becomes exposed to Lain. Once their identities have been made, the 'Men In Black' come to sweep them clean of their troubles by annihilating them, with them later on mysteriously being 'killed' by seeing images of Lain and a mysterious figure. So with Knights out of the way the wire will return to it's normal functioning state right? Not so. Apparently another being is responsible for the havoc of the wire. We then began to learn and probably suspect in the earlier episodes that lain is simply not 'human' but a program designed by the very man who had died on a train-track. Nothing remains of this man but his virtual 'conscience' which he strives in being 'God'.-Her Only Friend-As i've said before Asuri is Lain's only friend. That until a dirty secret about her doing some 'private things' to herself is let loose over the wire. And Lain is the blame. When Lain meets her at school she truly doesn't understand what's going on. Asuri's friends instantly ditch Lain but Asuri decides to give Lain a chance. This however, is ruined as Asuri sees Lain on her bed while she's giving herself a R-rated lesson on a comp chair.-Secrets revealed and friendships collapse-Asuri of course is terrified and feels violated as she wanted to keep that naturally as a tender secret, it is then she avoids Lain in school and truly believes that she did it, telling Lain that she 'saw her in her room' as a creepy midget with a nasty smile. Lain is visited by this creature as a smiling alien. She goes on the Wire to find out who this really 'is' where this virtual-lain explains that all information should be shared on the wire. Lain tries to choke this imposter but oddly it feels 'warm to the touch' in which the imposter laughs and says 'i'm committing suicide!' This leads to the conclusion that maybe Lain isn't the only 'Lain' but that there really is another lain. This Lain I will call Virtual Lain.-Alone Lain-In the end Lain's parents simply get up and 'go' with her father explaining to her that he was almost jealous of her 'free will' and that their time with her was to an end. Her sister just vanishes. This of course leaves lain 'broken' in a way where she's just laying locked up in her room with wires tangled around her body, constantly 'wired' in a zombie-like state. It is then in the wired world where she is being talked into suicide, that she doesn't 'need' a body. Lain takes the gun in hand questioningly until the girl that killed herself in the first episode shows. With a sad look on her face she tells Lain that 'Death Isn't Easy' and may show signs of regret of doing so as she is nothing more than memories of her life. Asuri, remembering what has happened while everyone else suddenly 'forgets' (thanks to the helpful erasing powers of Lain) goes to visit Lain to find out the truth.-Reality and Wired are One-After traveling through the neglected muck-of-house she stumbles upon Lain contained in wires. Lain then sits up talking some gobble-de-gook about her being a program. While Asuri tries to make sense of this the 'God' appears to Lain, telling her that she should connect with her friend if she loves her as she claims. Asuri stands there baffled as she watches lain talking to air until a digital hand appears when he says she needs to be debugged. Lain confronts 'God', saying that without her none of his progress would have worked and who created him. As soon as she starts talking to him about him not having a body and therefore not being 'real' he explodes. A vortex-like wrap appears in which random flesh is being drawn into and machine. A tangled mass of what appears to be a man is 'growing' out of this mass, despite Asuri's frantic screams. ""What do you need a body for?"" Lain says as this nasty squirting mass wraps its 'tentacles' around the two females, growing a big eye and a nasty zombie-like head in the process.-Reset-Apparently this being got physics punched by Lain because a big hunk of machine slammed into it's body. Then it just absorbed all the rest of Lain's expensive equipment until it became nothing more than a huddle of metal. Lain tries to say to Asuri that everything is okay. However just as Lain's sister Asuri 'cracks' from everything and ends up scratching Lain's face with a slap. Lain cries, telling Asuri that she is sorry and ends up erasing the world of her memories. Life continues for the best as everyone forgets about Lain, although she does 'pop-up' to a few people. In the end Lain is only left with Virtual Lain who tells Lain to 'start-over' again until Lain sends her packing, leaving her all alone. Lain is left to cry until her father appears, telling her that he loves her. This causes rivers of tears to flow down Lain's lonely face.-Non-existance-'Years' later Lain appears in the real-world to her friend Asuri who is now in her 20's. Asuri doesn't recognize Lain but goes to investigate her, telling her that she 'recalled her from before' but Lain goes by saying that they 'never-met'. So to wrap up the story it's as though Lain never existed in the real-world yet she can visit the real-world to see Asuri anytime she wishes.-The Themes-There are 3 major themes throughout Serial Experiment Lain. Homocide, Suicide, God.The girl in Lain's school commits suicide by jumping off a building and becomes a bloddy mess on the ground. Several people shoot themselves or get shot at. Even lain's wired self laughs gleefully as it exclaims that she is 'committing suicide'. Seriously how old is Lain, 13? Another is the self-proclaimed God theme running throughout the show that can also be offensive. First knights are 'gods' then Lain is a God then 'God'(the man who made prototype 7 which is Lain) is a God. The belief that mankind can become 'God' simply by their mental advancement capacities. Ironically Lain admits ""there must be God"" in the end. And as much as the shock-factor of the characters are done, I believe that this series has over-done it. Why isn't anyone actually brave for once? Must I hear the constant drizzly whining of 13 year olds?Overall Review:Good:-Long Plot Story-Nice intro theme by Boa-Nice chunk of episodes spanning to 4 dvd cases-Plot twist-The 'virtual flesh' scene by the fake God was cool.-Some of the artwork was nice-Asuri seemed like the only realistic character that responded realistically to her surroundings. Oh, and she actually cared for someone.Bad:-Dragged, dragged, dragged out storyline proves irritating.-Showing no emotions to your suffering family is cold, mechanical and not realistic concerning how everything else freaks out.-Sometimes you want the show to 'get to the point'-Constant flipping between Lain's real-world and Lain's Wired world is a choppy transit and can leave the viewer confused on what their seeing.-Themes of Suicide/Mental Instability/Questioning one's existence and homicide runs this show. Beware.-God God God. Everybody wants to rule the world.-There should have been an interesting fight scene with the virtual flesh-man instead of a sudden and dull ending by a piece of metal.-Lain went through all that just to delete herself out of existence? Boo.-Whinny emotional teens has been over-done at some points.-Why can't someone be brave in this show???-Some characters have said things that make no sense (That 24-year oldish-MIB (Men In Black) guy telling Lain that he 'Loves her' yet only meet her in one episode briefly?? What!?Ew.)-Lain sister cracks and no one cares. The characters can be self-centered.-Some adult-orientated material such as 'drug packets' and 'sexual situations'Overall Score:3.0 out of 5.0Serial Experiments Lain plot was dragged far too long and it's choppy transit sequence came to bite the series back. It would have been nicer for some fights scene than constantly witnessing characters either cracking up or dying. It's overdone.-Queenie",3,Serious Experiment Gone Wrong,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,14256,"['Lain', 'nature', 'series', 'odds', 'turning', 'moment', 'product', 'description', 'episodes', 'are',
