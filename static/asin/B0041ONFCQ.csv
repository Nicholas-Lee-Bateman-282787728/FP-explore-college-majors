1381980,AS6PQ449L86ZI,B0041ONFCQ,a mydellton,"[18, 18]","This is an archive film of John Gielgud's great acting style in his one man show of Shakespeare's roles and soliloquies. It is a black and white TV production from the mid 60s. After more than 45 years it has obviously dated, but is still largely entertaining for Shakespearian minds and enthusiasts. However, the general public would soon be bored well before the two hours has passed.As with other old black and white productions (such as BBC's `An Age of Kings') the contrast and brightness controls need adjustment. Otherwise a bright halo continually shines around Gielgud's head. He may be great, but perhaps not that great...?Gielgud appears in a sombre suit on a bare stage, and for two hours we listen to his amazing voice which has been likened to `a silver trumpet muffled with silk'.  Many prospective actors will do well to `borrow' much of this technique and encompass it within their own skills wherever possible.I waited for over 30 years for this DVD (which may prove what a sad creature I am) as the audio tape somehow did not suffice. Perhaps it was because Gielgud did not leave us many of his excellent Shakespearian roles after his death. There is only one surviving leading role, Julius Caesar; although we can see a form of the Tempest's Prospero in `Prospero's Books'. Otherwise all we have are some smaller, cameo roles which is a shame for such a great career. Therefore Ages of Man is an important production.I saw Gielgud on stage three times. The first time was in the `Best of Friends'; and the last time and only time I saw him in a Shakespearian setting was on an early makeshift stage at the Globe Theatre. This was just before Sam Wanamaker sadly passed away. Gielgud recited the Chorus `O For a Muse of Fire' from Henry 5th, which is one of the speeches on the disc.Sadly, many of Gielgud's performances are now only memories by those who saw them, but this DVD does give us a window onto Gielgud's power and skill.",5,Ages of Man by John Gielgud.,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1951,"['archive', 'film', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'great', 'acting', 'style', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'Shakespeare', 'roles', 'soliloquies', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'production', 'mid', '60s', 'more', '45', 'years', 'obviously', 'dated', 'still', 'largely', 'entertaining', 'Shakespearian', 'minds', 'enthusiasts', 'However', 'general', 'public', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'bored', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'passed.As', 'other', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'productions', 'such', 'BBC', 'Age', 'Kings', 'contrast', 'brightness', 'controls', 'need', 'adjustment', 'Otherwise', 'bright', 'halo', 'continually', 'Gielgud', 'head', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'perhaps', 'not', 'great', 'Gielgud', 'sombre', 'suit', 'bare', 'stage', 'two', 'hours', 'listen', 'amazing', 'voice', 'been', 'likened', 'silver', 'trumpet', 'muffled', 'silk', 'Many', 'prospective', 'actors', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'borrow', 'much', 'technique', 'encompass', 'own', 'skills', 'possible.I', 'waited', '30', 'years', 'DVD', 'may', 'prove', 'what', 'sad', 'creature', 'am', 'audio', 'tape', 'somehow', 'did', 'not', 'suffice', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Gielgud', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'many', 'excellent', 'Shakespearian', 'roles', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'surviving', 'leading', 'role', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'can', 'see', 'form', 'Tempest', 'Prospero', 'Prospero', 'Books', 'Otherwise', 'have', 'are', 'smaller', 'cameo', 'roles', 'shame', 'such', 'great', 'career', 'Therefore', 'Ages', 'Man', 'important', 'production.I', 'saw', 'Gielgud', 'stage', 'three', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'Best', 'Friends', 'last', 'time', 'only', 'time', 'saw', 'Shakespearian', 'setting', 'was', 'early', 'makeshift', 'stage', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'was', 'just', 'before', 'Sam', 'Wanamaker', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'Gielgud', 'recited', 'Chorus', 'O', 'Muse', 'Fire', 'Henry', '5th', 'one', 'speeches', 'disc.Sadly', 'many', 'Gielgud', 'performances', 'are', 'now', 'only', 'memories', 'who', 'saw', 'DVD', 'give', 'window', 'Gielgud', 'power', 'skill']",N/A

1381982,A1CMAK5IPJRK0L,B0041ONFCQ,"Cat ""hopeless-anglophile""","[29, 36]","In this one-man show ""Ages of Man"" we're treated to a selection of sonnets and soliloquies from Shakespeare's most famous works, expertly delivered by the great John Gielgud. He easily recites famous speeches from Hamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar and King Lear, with the most beautiful and impeccable diction that is sadly missing from todays' theater. It's easy to understand Shakespeare's imagery when one speaks it as well as he. As much as I enjoyed hearing him speak I have to say this isn't one of my favorite of Gielgud's performances. I appreciate the concept of his show as well as it being a 'bare stage' performance: no costumes, props, scenery, or anything else that would distract the audience from the text. Even so, I thought Gielgud's show a little boring in some repects. Most of the time, if he's not delivering a sonnet while sitting at a desk, he's delivering a soliloquy while staring at a fixed point in space-sometimes not even physically reacting to the actions of the unseen characters--even though he's verbally acknowledging them! I know Gielgud understands the text and I can tell he's a master at the intricacies of Shakespeare's language; the antitheses, the imagery, the scansion, etc, but I felt this was mostly a recital and not a performance. Gielgud is 63 when he performed this show, but I felt it was odd that he was performing certain monologues and not endowing them with the correct physicality that he probably would have done if he were in the entire play. He appeared very mature and stoic during his balcony speech as Romeo in contrast to the chaotic passion and the excitement Romeo feels towards Juliet. I don't object to actors playing parts older or younger than they are, but one needs to be physically and mentally invested and I thought Gielgud's composed, regal manner was distracting to the scene. Gielgud's speeches were mainly from political figures, emperors, generals or Kings but no matter if the speech is about impending death, struggles with madness or grief, they're all delivered in the same composure and rhythm no matter what the cirumstances. The only monologue where I thought he was truly, physically invested was Lear's final speech over Cordelia. I don't wish to imply that he is not a great actor, Gielgud's generation obviously studied and performed Shakespeare differently and his was accepted as the pinnacle of performances. After viewing this show, I can appreciate his obvious devotion to speech and his ability to clearly express Shakespeare's words---an admirable feat considering how tough it is to understand the text. Personally though, I prefer actors to incorporate physicality in their performance, (according to the clues Shakespeare writes in the text). I recommend viewing Ian McKellen's one man show ""Acting Shakespeare"" as a comparison to Gielgud's. McKellen performs many of the same speeches, but his textual understanding combined with physicality is a more visceral experience. McKellen 'suits the action to the word, the word to the action'-just as Shakespeare dictates.",3,"""Suit the Action to the Word""",1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3063,"['one-man', 'show', 'Ages', 'Man', ""'re"", 'treated', 'selection', 'sonnets', 'soliloquies', 'Shakespeare', 'most', 'famous', 'works', 'expertly', 'delivered', 'great', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'easily', 'famous', 'speeches', 'Hamlet', 'Macbeth', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'King', 'Lear', 'most', 'beautiful', 'impeccable', 'diction', 'sadly', 'missing', 'todays', 'theater', 'easy', 'understand', 'Shakespeare', 'imagery', 'when', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'speak', 'have', 'say', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'Gielgud', 'performances', 'appreciate', 'concept', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'being', ""'bare"", 'stage', 'performance', 'costumes', 'props', 'scenery', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'distract', 'audience', 'text', 'Even', 'so', 'thought', 'Gielgud', 'show', 'little', 'boring', 'repects', 'Most', 'time', 'not', 'delivering', 'sonnet', 'sitting', 'desk', 'delivering', 'soliloquy', 'staring', 'fixed', 'point', 'space-sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'physically', 'reacting', 'actions', 'unseen', 'characters', 'even', 'verbally', 'acknowledging', 'know', 'Gielgud', 'text', 'can', 'tell', 'master', 'intricacies', 'Shakespeare', 'language', 'antitheses', 'imagery', 'scansion', 'etc', 'felt', 'was', 'mostly', 'recital', 'not', 'performance', 'Gielgud', '63', 'when', 'performed', 'show', 'felt', 'was', 'odd', 'was', 'performing', 'certain', 'monologues', 'not', 'endowing', 'correct', 'physicality', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'were', 'entire', 'play', 'appeared', 'very', 'mature', 'stoic', 'balcony', 'speech', 'Romeo', 'contrast', 'chaotic', 'passion', 'excitement', 'Romeo', 'towards', 'Juliet', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'older', 'younger', 'are', 'one', 'be', 'physically', 'mentally', 'invested', 'thought', 'Gielgud', 'composed', 'regal', 'manner', 'was', 'distracting', 'scene', 'Gielgud', 'speeches', 'were', 'mainly', 'political', 'figures', 'emperors', 'generals', 'Kings', 'matter', 'speech', 'impending', 'death', 'madness', 'grief', ""'re"", 'delivered', 'same', 'composure', 'rhythm', 'matter', 'what', 'cirumstances', 'only', 'monologue', 'where', 'thought', 'was', 'truly', 'physically', 'invested', 'was', 'Lear', 'final', 'speech', 'Cordelia', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'imply', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'Gielgud', 'generation', 'obviously', 'studied', 'performed', 'Shakespeare', 'differently', 'was', 'accepted', 'pinnacle', 'performances', 'viewing', 'show', 'can', 'appreciate', 'obvious', 'devotion', 'speech', 'ability', 'clearly', 'express', 'Shakespeare', 'words', '-an', 'admirable', 'feat', 'considering', 'how', 'tough', 'understand', 'text', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'actors', 'incorporate', 'physicality', 'performance', 'according', 'clues', 'Shakespeare', 'text', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'Acting', 'Shakespeare', 'comparison', 'Gielgud', 'McKellen', 'many', 'same', 'speeches', 'textual', 'understanding', 'combined', 'physicality', 'more', 'visceral', 'experience', 'McKellen', 'action', 'word', 'word', ""action'-just"", 'Shakespeare']",N/A

Black,"[2, 2]","By the time David Susskind and Daniel Melnick produced it for television in 1966, Sir John Gielgud had internationally toured his one-man Shakespearean recital for nine years. As Michael Billington writes in this DVD's accompanying booklet, ""What you get in 'The Ages of Man' is the distillation of a lifetime's experience in acting Shakespeare"" by one ""who knew the plays inside and out and has here refined his technique so that it perfectly expresses the interpretative idea."" A collaboration of Entertainment One and the Archive of American Television, that is precisely what this disc captures, and it is bliss from start to its finish two hours later. On the fool-proof principle that with Gielgud less is more, director Paul Bogart stripped everything away--no scenery, costumes, or distracting hocus-pocus--accommodated his camera lenses to the scope of the actor's live performance, and spun gossamer that won for its producers the 1966 Emmy for Outstanding Single Dramatic Program. ""That was in the good old days when CBS would allow two hours of prime time to a single man reading Shakespeare,"" mused Bogart. ""Can you imagine that today? No way."" One of the many revelations of ""Ages of Man"" is Gielgud's deft ability, not merely to recite the words with his cello voice, but to act the parts--all the parts--in a coherent Shakespearean montage. The body, the gestures, the eyes: they never lie. This is must viewing for lovers of the Bard, for those who regard Gielgud as perhaps the finest Shakespearean interpreter of the twentieth century, and for connoisseurs of classic television as it once was and will likely never be again.",5,A Landmark Performance,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,1644,"['time', 'David', 'Susskind', 'Daniel', 'Melnick', 'produced', 'television', '1966', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'had', 'internationally', 'toured', 'one-man', 'Shakespearean', 'recital', 'nine', 'years', 'Michael', 'Billington', 'DVD', 'accompanying', 'booklet', 'What', 'get', ""'The"", 'Ages', 'Man', 'distillation', 'lifetime', 'experience', 'acting', 'Shakespeare', 'one', 'who', 'knew', 'plays', 'here', 'refined', 'technique', 'so', 'perfectly', 'interpretative', 'idea', 'collaboration', 'Entertainment', 'One', 'Archive', 'American', 'Television', 'precisely', 'what', 'disc', 'bliss', 'start', 'finish', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'fool-proof', 'principle', 'Gielgud', 'more', 'director', 'Paul', 'Bogart', 'stripped', 'everything', 'away', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'distracting', 'hocus-pocus', 'accommodated', 'camera', 'scope', 'actor', 'live', 'performance', 'spun', 'gossamer', 'won', 'producers', '1966', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Single', 'Dramatic', 'Program', 'was', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'CBS', 'would', 'allow', 'two', 'hours', 'prime', 'time', 'single', 'man', 'reading', 'Shakespeare', 'mused', 'Bogart', 'Can', 'imagine', 'today', 'way', 'One', 'many', 'revelations', 'Ages', 'Man', 'Gielgud', 'deft', 'ability', 'not', 'merely', 'recite', 'words', 'cello', 'voice', 'act', 'parts', 'parts', 'coherent', 'Shakespearean', 'montage', 'body', 'gestures', 'eyes', 'never', 'lie', 'must', 'viewing', 'lovers', 'Bard', 'who', 'regard', 'Gielgud', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'Shakespearean', 'interpreter', 'twentieth', 'century', 'connoisseurs', 'classic', 'television', 'once', 'was', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'again']",N/A
1381984,A3JW06DZ1S5E2H,B0041ONFCQ,Daniel B.,"[0, 0]","This is really stripped down theater - a single actor, in an ordinary suit, on a bare stage. But the magic created by this collaboration across the centuries of the great poet and the great actor is scintillating. John Gielgud was - and is - an institution. Along with Laurence Olivier, he embodied Shakespearean acting for the twentieth century. And tapes like this one and film performances ensure that both actors will continue to inspire audiences and performers into the future. Gielgud certainly lacked Olivier's physical presence, but he had his own way of presenting himself that worked very well. It is Gielgud's voice that is one of the treasures of modern acting. He was so suited to the demands and wonders of verse drama that his alliance with the Bard was inevitable. The roles he excelled in certainly exploited that voice - Romeo, Hamlet, Richard II, Leontes, King Lear. In contrast, Olivier triumphed as Mercutio, Richard III, Henry V, Macbeth. Gielgud played Clarence in Olivier's Richard III, and recited Clarence's nightmare with gripping intensity. I cannot imagine Olivier being so vulnerable, nor Gielgud as being so savage as Richard III. This production  displays all of Gielgud's gifts: his ability to hold the audience's rapt attention, his ability to recite poetry beautifully but not sentimentally, his quick changes of emotion or character, the power and range of his voice as well as its sensitivity.  At the beginning of part two, Gielgud lunges onto the stage with an incandescent version of O, FOR A MUSE OF FIRE. His speed, balance and physical grace surprised me, accustomed as I am to seeing him as an old man for twenty-five years. This is a performance for the ages.
