He expects to be head chef at his bosses' new restaurant, which is set to open soon. Instead, the owner chooses a much younger, &#34;hipper&#34; chef for the top job, pissing him off. In the meanwhile, some Indian stereotypes abound (traditional family, mother trying to arrange his marriage, etc.), but they are portrayed adroitly and with humor. This movie is good at humor at its own expense.A family emergency results in Samir taking responsibility and temporarily running his family's Indian restaurant, which is tired and in disrepair. Samir reluctantly takes the reins, and Naseeruddin Shah as Akbar, and Jess Wexler, as Carrie, serve as his muses.

1411815,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004K4FUQQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 6]","The genial and engaging ""Today's Special"" may not hold many surprises, but it has an irresistible charm that is guaranteed to ensure its status as a crowd pleasing favorite. It's a gentle and, dare I say, sweet comedy about searching for success but finding contentment instead in the most unlikely of places. At the end of the day, I may have wished the film had taken a road less traveled--but it's all so big-hearted, why bother quibbling? The film celebrates good food, good friends, good family, good times and throws in a bit of romance for good measure. That's a lot of good in this genuinely appealing movie.Co-writer Aasif Mandvi (The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) stars as a jaded New York chef who's looking to take the next big advance in the culinary world. When by-passed for an expected promotion, Mandvi starts to reconfigure his career and plans to take dramatic steps to meet his ambitions. His meddlesome parents don't seem to understand him and, in return, he holds the family's Indian restaurant in disdain. Through the magic of movie plotting, Mandvi (of course) finds himself temporarily in charge of the dilapidated venue. With the help of an ""only in the movies"" wizened cab driver/cook/mentor figure, he starts to appreciate the art of Indian food. Can he transform the restaurant? And, in the process, will it transform him? If you've ever seen a movie, I suspect you can guess the answer to these questions. And yet, the picture still works mostly due to its likable cast and underdog appeal.""Today's Special"" capitalizes on the quirky allure that so many films employ today. Every single character within the supporting cast (with the exception of love interest Jess Weixler) has a wacky side, but there is an undercurrent of truth and believability to the characters that still allows you to care for their story. I certainly liked ""Today's Special"" and anticipate that it will be universally beloved for its sweet natured comedy. It is lightweight, to be sure, but never less than enjoyable.

His hard work has earned him a position as second-in-command at a high profile eatery. And, having paid his dues the past six years, he expects to be tapped to head his boss' latest expansion restaurant. He's so secure in that knowledge that, when it's announced through a trade publication that a junior chef that he oversees will be given the prestigious position, he is utterly dumbstruck.Angry, confused and frothing - he demands an explanation. The top chef explains to him that he's competent, efficient, and very much an excellent lieutenant, but he just doesn't have what it takes to be a head chef. The boss hesitates giving him a full and honest critique until he's pushed into a corner and relents. He tells Samir that, in his opinion, he lacks the verve, the passion, and the simple love of cooking.Stunned and emotionally devastated - he quits. Deciding he needs to make a big move, both physically and professionally, he puts out feelers to hire on as a Parisian 'stodge' (st&agrave;ge), essentially an unpaid intern; working for free to understudy with a French master in the belief that he will prove them all wrong.At the very moment he makes that decision - his father, a restauranteur himself, suffers a heart attack.It's not life-threatening, but it is life-changing. What Samir doesn't realize is that it's his life that will change the most.Having had to postpone his plans until his dad can recover, he's now in charge of the family business. It's a rundown hole-in-the-wall serving Indian food. Ironically, having spent his entire life avoiding and denying his own cultural heritage, it's something he can't cook. In part, because he craves acceptance at the highest level of the culinary world - and that generally means mastering French cuisine. And, quietly, a stab into the hearts of his parents who he feels reveres his dead brother over himself. It's wrong, and the film clearly shows that his parents love him as he is; but that unspoken insecurity has driven deep into his being.'Today' is a wonderful journey of self-discovery. One which forces an honest look into the mirror and seriously questioning the person who stares back.Slowly, Samir realizes that his former boss pegged him correctly after all. He's technically perfect but lacks, much to his dismay, a heart. He's filled his life with so much untouched emotional baggage that he's lost touch with his very soul, and that has crowded out the very thing he's so passionate about: Cooking.Can a chance encounter with a mysterious and wondrous cab driver change his outlook? And ultimately, what does he discover at the bottom of his own Masala bowl?Not only a film about hubris, comeuppance, humility and spiritual recovery; but also tells the tale of a wayward son that returns ""home"" - both emotionally and culturally.An enjoyable and funny, if boilerplate, movie.Personal Notes:- All the players did an outstanding job in the film, but I was struck by Naseeruddin Shah, who played Akbar the taxi driver. His performance, which blended sublime, humorous and deeply touching was the 'wow' factor for me. A top shelf actor. I truly hope to see more of the man's work as he's found a new fan.- And finally I would be remiss not to mention Ajay Naidu who played the completely disgusting arrogant spittle-filled cook.

1411818,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B004K4FUQQ,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[3, 4]","This is a predictable, silly movie, full of cinematic cliches and stereotyped characters.  It's also delightfully entertaining -- lovable even.  The plot is pretty basic: Samir is at odds with traditional Indian dad. He's American, not Indian, and a sous chef at a hip French restaurant. Passed over for a promotion (because his cooking is good but lacks passion) he quits, hoping to go to Paris and work with one of the great chefs there. Dad's heart attack changes everything. Instead he needs to run the family restaurant, a hole in the wall curry palace in Queens.If you know 74th Street in Jackson Heights, or Steinway Street in Astoria, or the main drag in Corona or Flushing or Elmhurst, you've seen and probably eaten at the Tandori Palace (and the Afghan and Pakistani Palace, maybe even a Nepali or Tibetan Palace...and you know that ""palace"" in any of those languages translates to ""For god's sake, don't look in the kitchen.""  The neighborhoods are home to immigrants from all over, and most recently East Asia and the Middle East, and every block has two or three Palaces.  Next to the Greek gyro place, German deli, Korean BBQ, Israeli falafal stand, papusa cart and Chinese noodle joints. The food ranges from decent to astounding, and it's cheap. And exotic...it's fun to take a look behind the scenes sometimes, and this movie gives us that peek.With the help of a mysterious deus ex machina in the form of Akbar, an Indian cab driver/import-export dealer/orphanage director/master chef, Samir finds his passion, reconciles with his dad, and saves the family business. And finds love.  Akbar teaches him that cooking is not about recipes. It is a sensual art and should seduce or comfort. Cooking should come from the head, the heart and the stomach, not a book. Akbar is a bit larger than life, a philospher who gets most of his wisdom from fortune cookies, he cooked for Indira Ghandi, hung out with Queen Elizabeth, was pals with the Shah of Iran and a buddy to countless heads of state, maharajas and maharanis.  Every life should have an Akbar in it.""Today's Special"" is such a sweet movie, I found it easy to forgive theoccasional falls from grace. The good parts outnumber the bad and there are several moments that are pure gold.  When Akbar and Samir go shopping for spices, Akbar describes them in a way that is poetic, sexy and unforgettable. And accurate.  ""Cumin is a saucy wench who gives great pleasure, but beware...she herself is never satisfied."" That's quite true...the temptation to go too far with cumin is sometimes irresistable.  Coriander, on the other hand, is ""a maiden walking through a lemon grove by the sea."" Keep this in mind next time you smell some fresh coriander and see if it's not right. And cinnamon? Cinnamon is that crazy aunt or uncle, loud and noisy and fun...but a little goes a long way.The best scene in the movie is a dinner at Akbar's house. The food makes you hungry, and the Three Geezers(old timers who hang out at the Tandori Palace) will melt your heart.  Their dancing is laugh out loud funny and just flat out wonderful.  The scene is so full of charm and warmth, we watched it twice.The cast is excellent. Aasif Mandvi plays Samir. Aasif is a regular as the befuddled ""Asian,"" ""Middle Eastern"" or ""Muslim"" correspondent on The Jon Stewart Show.  The film is loosely based on his one-man play, ""Sakina's Restaurant,"" which won an Obie.  Samir's mother is played by Madhur Jaffrey, the renowned cookbook author and food writer. She gets no help from the script, which has her as the typical stereotyped Indian mother, desperate to see her son married. But Jaffrey has such a bright,expressive face and natural warmth, she brings depth and charm to a role that would otherwise be ignored.  His father is the well known Indian actor Harish Patel, notable for being about as wide as he is tall, and who does a creditable job in the role. Akbar is superbly played by Naseeruddin Shah, who was also excellent in Monsoon Wedding.  He steals every scene he is in...except those with the three geezers. They are heart-stealers as well as scene stealers.  One of them, Kumar Pallana, will be recognized as the crabby (but ultimately self-sacrificing) janitor in ""The Terminal.""A friend came over and literally forced me to watch this movie a few weeks ago when I was feeling very sad. It would not have been on my radar otherwise, and it would have been my loss.  If it lifted my spirits on that day when my heart was in pieces, I think it will cheer anyone.  Don't expect a brilliant and original plot, or some new height in cinematic intellectualism.  It's just a sweet, endearing movie. No one gets shot, no car chases, no vampires, explosions, spies or police corruption. Just escapism.  How bad is that.  But if you want a little balm for a sore heart, if you need a little lift, or just want to spend 90 minutes smiling, watch it.  And you might want to keep a menu from an Indian restaurant...one that delivers...handy. Trust me, you'll want it.",5,Currying favor...,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,5013,"['predictable', 'silly', 'movie', 'full', 'cinematic', 'cliches', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'also',

Meanwhile his father who owns the Tandoori Palace has a heart attack and Samir has to step in to try to save the business and never mind he knows or cares nothing about Indian cuisine.  A local cabbie by the name of Akbar, a man of the world and also a talented chef comes to the rescue and in so doing introduces Samir to a style of cooking that wakes up his sense of smell and creativity as well as putting some passion into the food.  The cast includes Madhur Jaffrey, author of many cookbooks, who plays Samir's mother always trying to hook him up with a prospective bride.  She is perfectly cast for this role and definitely adds a lot of dry humor to the plot.  The love interest of Samir, Carrie, a prep chef at Samir's former restaurant also makes Samir open up to his buried emotions regarding his late brother, father, and his overall aloof attitude about cooking in general.  ""Don't think so much"", Akbar tells him just let it come from your head, heart, and stomach as he points to each one.  The whole cast of actors most of them unknowns to me did a great job, including the three old guys who hang out in the restaurant every day and ultimately support Samir in his endeavors to make a go of his father's restaurant.  The filming was very realistic and captured the ethnicity of a New York small neighborhood.

As fate would have it, just when he is about to go to Paris to intern with a big time French chef (he hopes) and blaze a big career for himself, his father has a heart attack.  The results are predictable but the story is carried out with a lot of heart.The cast is first rate, led by Aasif Mandu as Samir.  A lesser actor might have not won audiences as well as he did.  His performance is just right--doesn't overdo it--he's great.  The part of his love interest--a soft blond--his perfect opposite--is a bit overacted but she looks right for the part.  The magic fellow, a sort of Peter Pan who drops from the sky just when he's needed, is perfect. He's played by Naseerudden Shah and steals every scene in which he appears.  It's a stock role but Mr. Shah is so good that he far transcends  the type.  There are other supporting actors who add a lot to the warmth and humor of the film.  I loved the three old guys who play cards in the restaurant all day.  And 'special mention to the kitchen helper who says ""yes.""  He is a small gem of a character, again very nicely played.The script is not groundbreaking but it is nicely told.  The shots of Queens (I think it is) are wonderful.

What I was NOT expecting was a warm, sweet, and very funny confection of a film that is not only about Indian cooking/food ... but also about father-son relationships, love, and how following your dream may also include having the faith to stay on the detours life sometimes throws you.  A young Indian man/chef in Manhattan named Samir (Aasif Mandvi, who also co-wrote the script), a bit of a hot-head who quits his job when passed over for a promotion, is forced to give up his plans to relocate to Paris to study the culinary arts when his father suffers a heart attack ... and Samir has to take over the family's restaurant.  The problem?  Samir has never cooked an Indian dish, and indeed has never had the slightest bit of interest in either the food of his culture OR his father's tiny little restaurant.  A chance meeting with an Indian cab driver changes everything, and through food Samir finds his zest for both life and his culture all over again.
