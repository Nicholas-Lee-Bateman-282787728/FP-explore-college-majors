White,"[13, 20]","When I ordered this I was expecting an 'official' collection of the Robot Chicken:Star Wars trilogy but instead it's simply the three seperate discs combined for one purchase. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I expected. I already had the first RC:SW, due to it being mentioned on the Family Guy parody, and even though I wasn't all that impressed with it I still couldn't resist getting the other two, because I'm a big SW fan, and getting them all together definitly saved some money. If this sounds like a predicament you're in then I would recommend getting this set, or if you're a big RC & SW fan. However, if you're simply a SW fan and only casually watch RC (like myslef) than I would borrow/rent these first to see if they're for you. RC:SW is not like FG:SW because it's just a bunch of random clips in all three episodes, and they are just regular eps too not special releases. Don't get me wrong, it's funny, just not for everybody. Despite its lesser reviews I personally enjoyed the third one more than the other two combined, but I appear to be in the minority for that. I seem to be the first reviewer for this collection, so my apologies if it's not very helpful, but I would say have a good idea of what RC is all about before you purchase this.",3,Not quite what you think,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1280,"['When', 'ordered', 'was', 'expecting', ""'official"", 'collection', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'instead', 'simply', 'three', 'seperate', 'discs', 'combined', 'one', 'purchase', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'already', 'had', 'first', 'RC', 'SW', 'due', 'being', 'mentioned', 'Family', 'Guy', 'parody', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'getting', 'other', 'two', ""'m"", 'big', 'SW', 'fan', 'getting', 'together', 'definitly', 'saved', 'money', 'predicament', ""'re"", 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'set', ""'re"", 'big', 'RC', 'SW', 'fan', 'However', ""'re"", 'simply', 'SW', 'fan', 'only', 'casually', 'watch', 'RC', 'myslef', 'would', 'borrow/rent', 'first', 'see', ""'re"", 'RC', 'SW', 'not', 'like', 'FG', 'SW', 'just', 'bunch', 'random', 'clips', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'regular', 'eps', 'too', 'not', 'special', 'releases', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'funny', 'just', 'not', 'everybody', 'lesser', 'reviews', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'third', 'one', 'more', 'other', 'two', 'combined', 'appear', 'be', 'minority', 'seem', 'be', 'first', 'reviewer', 'collection', 'apologies', 'not', 'very', 'helpful', 'would', 'say', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'RC', 'purchase']",Robot Chicken: Star Wars 1-3 - Giftset
