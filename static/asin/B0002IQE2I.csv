Scott Speedman is excellent as a sexually conflicted blue-collar guy who thinks he contracted AIDS from his only same-sex encounter.  James Marsden, one of the most beautiful men in films today, plays the slick, promiscuous producer who bedded Speedman years ago, and is thoroughly convincing in a difficult role.  But after Speedman lures Marsden into his apartment and holds him captive, it seems that the filmmakers don't know what to do with the story and it gets bogged down in repetitive chat.  Aside from implying that Marsden's character is slipping into alcoholism, very little happens.  Another problem is, as excellent as their acting is, Speedman and Marsden don't project any attraction to each other.  It's so obvious that they're straight men playing gay, Ray Charles could see it.  As a result, it's hard to imagine that the encouter ever happened.

Wells ""CineMan""","[1, 2]","I ordered this film, sight unseen from Amazon, and was more than a little apprehensive about it's quality, given the abundance of really bad gay- themed films that have shown up at our local art house/gay cinema in the past few years.  In fact, the venue really hardly qualifies as a gay cinema at all anymore because the owners have (wisely) opted to screen better-made independent and foreign films dealing with other subjects, or mainstream fare appealing to a broader audience.  If ""The 24th Day"" played here, I somehow managed to miss it, which is too bad, because it's really a pretty good film.  Like other reviewers here have stated, it is more like a filmed play, so if you don't enjoy going to the theater and watching a dark drama unfold onstage, you're probably not going to enjoy ""The 24th Day"".  James Marsden stars as Dan, a good looking stud on the make in a large American city (presumably Philadelphia).  Out for a night on the town with his female roommate, he winds up going home with a seemingly shy and naive young man named Tom.  He soon comes to regret this decision after he finds himself handcuffed, gagged, and bound to a chair in Tom's living room. Tom accuses Dan of infecting him with the HIV virus during a drunken, unsafe tryst 5 years earlier.  He is having Dan's blood tested and if the results come back positive for the AIDS virus, Tom intends to make Dan pay with his own life.  The story turns into a suspenseful field day for the very talented actors as each tries to get the best of the other in an intensifying game of life and death.I liked the film a lot.  The production values are high, and it is well-written and filmed. The script has some unexpected twists, and as I stated above, the performances are excellent.  James Marsden convincingly goes from smug and patronizing, to angry and afraid as the seriousness of his dilemma sinks in; Scott Speedman is equally dynamic as a man whose sanity seems to grow more precarious with every passing frame of film. If I have any complaint, it would be that I found the ending somewhat contrived and unconvincing. However, the ending wasn't so totally outside the realm of possibility as to negate the rest of the film, so that's saying a lot.

835575,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0002IQE2I,C. B Collins Jr.,"[38, 41]","Scott Speedman and James Marsden both do exceptional acting in this emotionally intense film. In this review I want to discuss three aspects of the film.First, the actors and the complicated situation these two men find themselves in carries this film. There are no fireworks special effects. In fact the film feels like a stage play due to the intensity of the dialogue between these two men, one of whom, Tom the chef, has imprisoned the other, Dan the gay successful pretty boy, and will kill him if it appears that he infected Tom during Tom's one and only one-night-stand  with another man. Beautiful James Marsden does a terrific job but Scott Speedman needs a nomination for best supporting actor, he is really good. The play between captive and captor is a dangerous game, as these two men discover.Second, the film did an excellent job of weaving in the intracacies and uncertainties of HIV infection and antibody testing into the plot. Tom thinks Dan infected him 5 years ago during intercourse because a couple of years later, Tom's wife develops AIDS related symptoms, finds she is HIV positive, and then dies by running a red light after finding her HIV status. Tom imprisons Dan, takes a sample of his blood by force, and sends it to a lab with the intention of killing Dan if it comes back positive since Tom interprets this as proof that Dan infected him. Dan, struggling for his life, reasons with Tom that Tom's wife could have been infected before Tom and that since she showed AIDS symptoms so early, she may have been infected for some time. Thus Dan tries to raise doubts in Tom's mind that Tom did not infect his wife, it was the other way around. Anyone familiar with HIV/AIDS knows that this is a valid argument.Third, the story showed character development and change. Tom is extremely angry at first and seeks careful deadly revenge against Dan. Then Dan rightfully inserts doubt into Tom's mind as to who infected who in the relationship between Tom and his wife. Then the results come back with Dan's HIV status. At this point the film takes some plot twists which I don't think I should reveal, however I will say that at some point Tom moves out of anger and revenge and into compassion. Compassion is an amazing emotion, healing to those who experience it directly or indirectly. This recognition of the role of compassion in our lives is the reason I gave this exceptional film a ""5"".Very well done.",5,"Fine acting, very well done",1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,2432,"['Scott', 'Speedman', 'James', 'Marsden', 'do', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'film', 'review', 'want', 'discuss', 'three', 'aspects', 'film.First', 'actors', 'complicated', 'situation', 'two', 'men', 'find', 'film', 'are', 'fireworks', 'special', 'effects', 'fact', 'film', 'feels', 'stage', 'play', 'due', 'intensity', 'dialogue', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'whom', 'Tom', 'chef', 'imprisoned', 'other', 'Dan', 'gay', 'successful', 'pretty', 'boy', 'will', 'kill', 'infected', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'one', 'only', 'one-night-stand', 'man', 'Beautiful', 'James', 'Marsden', 'terrific', 'job', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'nomination', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'really', 'good', 'play', 'captive', 'captor', 'dangerous', 'game', 'two', 'men', 'discover.Second', 'film', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'weaving', 'intracacies', 'uncertainties', 'HIV', 'infection', 'antibody', 'testing', 'plot', 'Tom', 'Dan', 'infected', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'intercourse', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Tom', 'wife', 'AIDS', 'related', 'symptoms', 'HIV', 'positive', 'then', 'dies', 'running', 'red', 'light', 'finding', 'HIV', 'status', 'Tom', 'imprisons', 'Dan', 'sample', 'blood', 'force', 'lab', 'intention', 'killing', 'Dan', 'back', 'positive', 'Tom', 'proof', 'Dan', 'infected', 'Dan', 'struggling', 'life', 'reasons', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'infected', 'Tom', 'showed', 'AIDS', 'symptoms', 'so', 'early', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'infected', 'time', 'Thus', 'Dan', 'tries', 'raise', 'doubts', 'Tom', 'mind', 'Tom', 'did', 'not', 'infect', 'wife', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'HIV/AIDS', 'valid', 'argument.Third', 'story', 'showed', 'character', 'development', 'change', 'Tom', 'extremely', 'angry', 'first', 'careful', 'deadly', 'revenge', 'Dan', 'Then', 'Dan', 'rightfully', 'doubt', 'Tom', 'mind', 'who', 'infected', 'who', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Then', 'results', 'come', 'back', 'Dan', 'HIV', 'status', 'point', 'film', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'reveal', 'however', 'will', 'say', 'point', 'Tom', 'anger', 'revenge', 'compassion', 'Compassion', 'amazing', 'emotion', 'healing', 'who', 'experience', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'recognition', 'role', 'compassion', 'lives', 'reason', 'gave', 'exceptional', 'film', '5', '.Very', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Overall, an excellent film, well acted, well directed and emotionally charged.The storyline is quite straight-forward: 2 guys Tom (Speedman) and Dan (Marsden) who had an sexual encounter 5 years earlier meet again - unbeknowsnt to one of them.  Watch the first 25 minutes carefully - you'll find it hard not to.The film centers around Toms discovery that he is HIV positive, and is certain Dan gave him the disease.  Unlike many gay-themed film of recent years, this one pulls all the punches.  It puts the topic of sex, unsafe sex, multiple partners, trust and honesty all on the table, no holds barred.On a personal level, if you are not in a relationship, this film will certainly challenge your own ability to ever believe anyone again.I liked this film because it dealt with a topic our society seems to be struggling with again - people having unsafe sex, and being afraid of getting tested for HIV.In addition, it is an erotic thriller, full of suspense, unexpected turns and twists, and emotion.  It was near impossible to guess the next scene, and the ending is true to the storyline and directing.What I didn't like: there is one scene where the directing appears to have come from some ""Halloween"" thriller type movie.  It takes away from the appeal to that point.  The film does recover, but some viewers may find the middle of the film at times slow.Overall, this is an excellent movie, filmed on location in Philadelphia.

It makes certain that the playwright's dialogue is maintained and that the focus stays on that dialogue. This was used effectively with ""The Boys in the Band,"" ""Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean,"" and several others.As a community, homosexuals have had their fair share of plays and films that have ranted and raved against the government inaction on AIDS (The Normal Heart; And the Band Played On), awareness raising of self-imposed discrimination against those with AIDS (Jeffrey; Longtme Companion) and general ""aint we got it bad"" plays (Love, Valour, Compassion; Parting Glances). Not all of these have been great, but they have been intriguing and thought provoking - just what was necessary. Unfortunately, as we've grown accustomed to the reality of AIDS in our lives, we've also become desensitized to the reality of it. There is an entire generation out there that has never known a world without AIDS and safe sex as a mantra. There is a contingent present that chooses to ignore the realities of the disease and its indescriminate behavior. They are the men (and women) that The 24th Day addresses. True it only speaks directly about gay men and ""straight"" men who stray, but it is the first real play/film to take this attitude to task.Dan (James Marsden) is a hot film producer out for an evening of fun with his best ""girl"" friend at (what ostensibly appears to be) a straight bar. However, he manages to get picked up by (or pick up) Tom (Scott Speedman). They retire to Tom's apartment. There Dan discovers that Tom has been stalking him because he believes that Dan gave him AIDS five years previous on his once and only time sleeping with a man.Since this much is told on the DVD cover, I've not given anything away. In fact, more could be said without giving away the whole plot, simply because this is less a film about action and plot than it is a character study about sexual responsiblity.The acting is very good and the set is effective (it is basically a single set for the entire film - remember it is a play to film). If I had any gripes it would be that the play and the film tend to get redundant in the dialogue about halfway through. There seems to be more antagonistic behavior and less actual character development (especially of Dan) than I would like to see. That said, it is important to remember that I think the playwrite was intending that this play be about ""everyman"" and thus didn't want to bog the play down with heavy details about individuals and take the emphasis off the intended audience. I think this is bold, but ultimately speaks a bit down to the audience, assuming that they wouldn't be able to glean the information from the essence of the material - which is strong.The DVD is very light on extras, but then this isn't a film you watch for the extras.I think you'll enjoy this film.",3,Effective social commentary for gay/straight community,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2937,"['24th', 'day', 'essentially', 'play', 'produced', 'screen', 'good', 'thing', 'certain', 'playwright', 'dialogue', 'maintained', 'focus', 'dialogue', 'was', 'used', 'effectively', 'Boys', 'Band', 'Come', 'Back', 'Five', 'Dime', 'Jimmy', 'Dean', 'several', 'others.As', 'community', 'homosexuals', 'have', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'plays', 'films', 'have', 'ranted', 'raved', 'government', 'inaction', 'AIDS', 'Normal', 'Heart', 'Band', 'Played', 'awareness', 'raising', 'self-imposed', 'discrimination', 'AIDS', 'Jeffrey', 'Longtme', 'Companion', 'general', 'aint', 'got', 'bad', 'plays', 'Love', 'Valour', 'Compassion', 'Parting', 'Glances', 'Not', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'intriguing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'accustomed', 'reality', 'AIDS', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'also', 'become', 'desensitized', 'reality', 'entire', 'generation', 'there', 'never', 'known', 'world', 'AIDS', 'safe', 'sex', 'mantra', 'contingent', 'present', 'ignore', 'realities', 'disease', 'indescriminate', 'behavior', 'are', 'men', 'women', '24th', 'Day', 'addresses', 'True', 'only', 'directly', 'gay', 'men', 'straight', 'men', 'who', 'stray', 'first', 'real', 'play/film', 'take', 'attitude', 'task.Dan', 'James', 'Marsden', 'hot', 'film', 'producer', 'out', 'evening', 'fun', 'best', 'girl', 'friend', 'what', 'ostensibly', 'be', 'straight', 'bar', 'However', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'pick', 'up', 'Tom', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'retire', 'Tom', 'apartment', 'Dan', 'discovers', 'Tom', 'been', 'stalking', 'Dan', 'gave', 'AIDS', 'five', 'years', 'previous', 'once', 'only', 'time', 'sleeping', 'man.Since', 'much', 'told', 'DVD', 'cover', ""'ve"", 'not', 'given', 'anything', 'away', 'fact', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'plot', 'simply', 'less', 'film', 'action', 'plot', 'character', 'study', 'sexual', 'responsiblity.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'effective', 'basically', 'single', 'set', 'entire', 'film', 'remember', 'play', 'film', 'had', 'gripes', 'would', 'be', 'play', 'film', 'tend', 'get', 'redundant', 'dialogue', 'halfway', 'be', 'more', 'antagonistic', 'behavior', 'less', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'Dan', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'said', 'important', 'remember', 'think', 'playwrite', 'was', 'intending', 'play', 'be', 'everyman', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'bog', 'play', 'down', 'heavy', 'details', 'individuals', 'take', 'emphasis', 'intended', 'audience', 'think', 'bold', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'down', 'audience', 'assuming', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'glean', 'information', 'essence', 'material', 'strong.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'light', 'extras', 'then', ""n't"", 'film', 'watch', 'extras.I', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A
835581,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002IQE2I,Grady Harp,"[324, 349]","THE 24TH DAY is quite simply one of the finest achievements in American film making in the past year.  Based on his play of the same name, writer and director Tony Piccirillo establishes his credentials as one of our more potent and important talents with the release of this exceptional 'first feature'.  Not only is the script one of the best pieces of writing around, the acting of here-to-for underused pretty boys James Marsden and Scott Speedman is of the quality for which awards were invented.After opening credits (which only in retrospect tell the entire story in beautifully executed photography), the story begins in a singles bar and moves slowly to the musty, dark, cluttered apartment of Tom (Scott Speedman from 'Underworld', 'Duets', etc) where it becomes clear that his 'guest' Dan (James Marsden of 'The Notebook' and the 'X Men' series - a 31 year old actor who lost out on the lead role in 'Primal Fear' to Edward Norton!) has been cruising Tom with the intention of a sexual tryst for the evening.  With graceful, subtle dialogue we are seduced into the verbal foreplay of the apparent tryst until BANG! - Tom informs Dan that they had an evening of sex five years ago (Dan was drunk and doesn't remember) and since that has been Tom's only gay sexual liaison: Tom has been stalking Dan in revenge for his transmitting HIV to Tom, a transmission which has resulted in Tom's wife falling victim to AIDS and dying in a car crash 24 days ago!Tom therefore becomes the captor and Dan the captive in this two-person drama.  Dan is tied and gagged and Tom withdraws a syringe of Dan's blood, which he then takes to have tested for HIV.  If Dan is HIV positive, Tom will kill him: if Dan is negative he will be free to go.  The entire story takes place in this grungy apartment as a dialogue between Tom the avenger and Dan the victim who declares his seronegativity and opens the multipronged discussion of such topics as truth ('THE truth or YOUR truth"" they each spar), AIDS, gay vs. bisexual vs. straight, sex without love or commitment, etc.The relationship between captor and captive goes through many permutations, each more startling and frightening than the last until the story reaches its almost unbearably surprise climax.  In the end the audience is left to resolve the final issues presented - a trait of a truly fine playwright.  The messages and the impact of this movie are some of the more powerful on film.We can only hope to see much more of the gifted Tony Piccirillo's work, both as a brilliant writer and as a tautly sensitive director.  The real surprise (in a film full of professional surprises) is the caliber of acting from James Marsden and Scott Speedman.  The are both startlingly fine: each actor creates his character so fully that our identification with each man's plight plays like a ping pong game with every soliloquy.  There is an underlying animal sexual attraction between the two, even as the initial ploy of an evening of anonymous sex turns bitterly sour, and this interplay makes the story's end all the more poignant.  These two fine actors each deliver the quality of performance that deserves Oscar attention.Without reservation this film is high on the list of the finest 'indie movies' (read very low budget) of the year.  Everyone who admires the art of cinema should see, no - buy!, this film.

The premise of this film had me on the edge of my seat from the very first gut-wrenching conflict, in a film that was filled to the brim with gut-wrenching conflicts.  The acting of both principals in this essentially two-character piece was first rate, and helped to elevate it high above most standard gay-themed fare.  But what really made this picture superior to 90% of the gay titles I've purchased in the past year was the confrontation of real issues that gay men should be discussing, but frequently shy away from.  Without giving away the plot, let me say that almost every minute of the taught, carefully crafted script is imbued with thoughtful discussion on issues that are all to frequently ignored by sexually active gay men.  I didn't see the ending coming at all, and the ultimate, positive and healthy message - that everyone is responsible for their own conduct, and the consequences thereof - is one that too many people don't seem to get, in my observation.  In a world where the madness of barebacking and substance abuse is decimating the gay urban male population, the lesson of this film is one that every gay man needs to consider, if not embrace wholeheartedly.

Are adults responsible(even college ageyoung adults) for theiractions when their under the influence and if you know thatyou may be unsafe,  still fool around,(not to even think ifyour sober and doing it?)

Castellaneta, did close to the same thing (minus the death threats) 13 years earlier in his 1991 release, ""Together Alone.""  Here's how the two films line up:----2 hunky guys (one married / one not---in both ""24th"" and ""TA""),----A night of lovemaking (remembered+talked about in ""24th"" / actually in bed in ""TA""),----AIDS as a factor (does he have it / does he not---in both films),----A night of philosophizing (what if this / what if not this---in both films).Apparently 1991's ""Together Alone"" garnered even lesser acclaim than did ""24th"" (but Castellaneta did go on 7 years later to make a somewhat more successful 'number' you've probably heard of titled, ""Relax......It's Just Sex"").  Actually, ""TA"" has never made it to DVD's ranks from its original VHS video release (and even that is shown by Amazon to be available only as used and, then, in a mere 4 copies)(Wolfe Video, it's original releaser, states it's no longer available from them).Scott Speedman?  While still somewhat newer and 'a-learning' as an actor, it takes only moments to see the shock waves of guilt, sorrow, and anger this man throws off in his role as Tom.  Wow!James Marsden?  Dear gods, don't be jealous........for this man is so beautiful.  (Just an aside:  at times I find it almost difficult to look at him.  While everyone's perception of beauty differs, to me this man is just plain arresting---watching him here and in ""Heights"" is almost too much).  Nonetheless, his physical attributes are far surpassed by a freshness and depth of feeling, rare in such a young performer, which he brings to his dramatic roles, that of Dan being no exception.Since I can add nothing more concerning performances and plot points than is contained in the several quite good 4- and 5-Star reviews already here, I will mention only one character detail:  Tom is, at his most basic and essential, a good and honest human being.

Five years ago Tom had a one night stand with Dan (James Marsden).  It was an urge that had been building up inside of him for years that he quelled, until that night. It was the first and only time he'd ever been unfaithful to his wife.  But that one indiscretion began a ripple effect that touched and eventually destroyed every other aspect of his life.After their one night together Tom goes on with his life as if nothing happened.  He made a choice that night -- to love his wife, and in so doing he completely submerged this other part of himself. The part that was/is attracted to men.  Until, in the most horrible way imaginable Tom's wife discovers the truth about her husband and their life together.Tom is HIV positive.  And in his mind he could have only contracted it one way - Dan.  So Tom ""accidentally"" runs into Dan at a bar.  Dan doesn't recognize him and they go back to Tom's place.  Dan thinks he's there for sex, but Tom has other plans. Tom knocks Dan out and ties him to a chair then forcibly extracts blood from him in order to get it tested.For a lot of people that would be the end of movie, but this movie delves deeper.  Because while Tom is angry and wants his revenge, we are also shown that he is still very much attracted to Dan, and that even tied up and held prisoner Dan is attracted to Tom.  And it's in the duality of the situation they find themselves in that is the crux of the film.  It's a two man passion play that isn't afraid to touch on those things we'd rather not think about in the cool dispassionate light of day.  Things like, love, betrayal, denial and the hardest of all acceptance.  In the end its about what you're responsible for and what you're willing to take responsibility for.

835603,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0002IQE2I,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[6, 9]","Well I decided to give this film a try since it came on Encore Mystery this weekend. The plot intrigued me because it was so different. Since this was made in 2004 I assumed we wouldn't see so many negative gay cliches but I was wrong. As if that weren't bad enough this movie was a slow mess with no point or direction.I can't even remember the names of the characters so I'll give a quick description using the actor's names. James Marsden is a guy who doesn't really call himself gay but enjoys having liaisons with hot young guys. He believes that the act of having sex with men doesn't make him gay and that no one in life is either gay nor straight, just creatures of impulse. Scott Speedman is a nervous young cook who meets Marsden in a bar and takes him back to his place. The two have great chemistry and it's easy to believe they'd connect romantically.After they get to Scott's place, James makes a pass at Scott and Scott chickens out. He begins to ask James all these personal questions about his sex life and how many men he's slept with. He also seems to be obsessive with finding out if James considers himself gay. James (with his gorgeous smile) laughs off Scott's questions and tries to switch the mood to having sex. Scott rejects him again and while on the phone, James realizes he's been to Scott's place before.Scott comes clean and admits he was a guy that picked James up five years earlier and they had sex while James was drunk. James thinks Scott is joking at first but when Scott grows creepier as the minutes pass, James senses he's needs to leave. He heads for the door, Scott wrestles him into a chair and ties him up. From there a movie that could've been incredibly interesting became a boring two-character play.It turns out Scott is married and has HIV. He believes James has given him the disease. I am a straight woman and even I found it offensive that Scott would assume James was the one that gave him the disease just because he was the only man he'd ever been with. Scott agrees to wait for proof that James didn't infect him. James swears up and down he does not have HIV. During this boring exchange, Scott has numerous flashbacks about his wife who is now dead from being infected by Scott. He has flashbacks of being at work which seem to have nothing to do with the scenes at hand and he also has flashbacks of him out with women.Sigh. This movie started out an A and quickly became an F. There are numerous issues here. The film lacked character development. We were thrown into this situation with two characters and we knew nothing about them nor cared. I felt the movie would've been more interesting if it focused on the gay romance. The writing was full of cliches, boring and pointless. At times the dialogue was laughable and the characters often didn't react realistically. James Marsden did the best with his character but Scott Speedman seemed to be trying too hard to be frightening and it only made him come off as a big dork.What was really ridiculous was how James never tried to get away! Here he is strapped to a chair with a crazy man and all he does is ask Scott questions about being gay or not being gay. Scott has told this man he'll kill him if he infected him yet James is acting like this is a friendly tea party.The straw that broke the camel's back was the cliches. Why did Scott have to be in the closet? Why did the characters have to go through the lame, ""How many men have you been with?"" question? Sounds like a line from an After School Special. Why did Scott assume James gave him the disease? Why not think it was his wife? There are tons of cliches and I can't attempt to name them all but most were offensive.What can I say? I didn't like this movie. If you wanna give it a chance, be my guest. But if you're expecting a brilliant psycho thriller like I was, you're gonna be very disappointed. This film doesn't even come close and at times it's even laughable.",1,Lame and Full of Negative Gay Stereotypes,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,3947,"['Well', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'came', 'Encore', 'Mystery', 'weekend', 'plot', 'intrigued', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'was', 'made', '2004', 'assumed', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'gay', 'cliches', 'was', 'wrong', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'mess', 'point', 'direction.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'names', 'characters', 'so', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'description', 'using', 'actor', 'names', 'James', 'Marsden', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'gay', 'having', 'liaisons', 'hot', 'young', 'guys', 'act', 'having', 'sex', 'men', ""n't"", 'make', 'gay', 'one', 'life', 'gay', 'straight', 'just', 'creatures', 'impulse', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'nervous', 'young', 'cook', 'who', 'Marsden', 'bar', 'back', 'place', 'two', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'easy', 'believe', ""'d"", 'connect', 'romantically.After', 'get', 'Scott', 'place', 'James', 'pass', 'Scott', 'Scott', 'out', 'ask', 'James', 'personal', 'questions', 'sex', 'life', 'how', 'many', 'men', 'slept', 'also', 'be', 'obsessive', 'finding', 'out', 'James', 'gay', 'James', 'gorgeous', 'smile', 'Scott', 'questions', 'tries', 'switch', 'mood', 'having', 'sex', 'Scott', 'again', 'phone', 'James', 'been', 'Scott', 'place', 'before.Scott', 'clean', 'was', 'guy', 'picked', 'James', 'up', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'sex', 'James', 'was', 'drunk', 'James', 'Scott', 'joking', 'first', 'when', 'Scott', 'creepier', 'minutes', 'pass', 'James', 'needs', 'leave', 'door', 'Scott', 'chair', 'ties', 'up', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'became', 'boring', 'two-character', 'play.It', 'out', 'Scott', 'married', 'HIV', 'James', 'given', 'disease', 'am', 'straight', 'woman', 'even', 'found', 'offensive', 'Scott', 'would', 'assume', 'James', 'was', 'one', 'gave', 'disease', 'just', 'was', 'only', 'man', ""'d"", 'ever', 'been', 'Scott', 'wait', 'proof', 'James', 'did', ""n't"", 'infect', 'James', 'not', 'have', 'HIV', 'boring', 'exchange', 'Scott', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'wife', 'who', 'now', 'dead', 'being', 'infected', 'Scott', 'flashbacks', 'being', 'work', 'seem', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'scenes', 'hand', 'also', 'flashbacks', 'out', 'women.Sigh', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'A', 'quickly', 'became', 'F.', 'are', 'numerous', 'issues', 'here', 'film', 'lacked', 'character', 'development', 'were', 'thrown', 'situation', 'two', 'characters', 'knew', 'nothing', 'cared', 'felt', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'focused', 'gay', 'romance', 'writing', 'was', 'full', 'cliches', 'boring', 'pointless', 'times', 'dialogue', 'was', 'laughable', 'characters', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'react', 'realistically', 'James', 'Marsden', 'did', 'best', 'character', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'frightening', 'only', 'made', 'come', 'off', 'big', 'dork.What', 'was', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'how', 'James', 'never', 'tried', 'get', 'away', 'Here', 'strapped', 'chair', 'crazy', 'man', 'ask', 'Scott', 'questions', 'being', 'gay', 'not', 'being', 'gay', 'Scott', 'told', 'man', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'infected', 'yet', 'James', 'acting', 'friendly', 'tea', 'party.The', 'straw', 'broke', 'camel', 'back', 'was', 'cliches', 'Why', 'did', 'Scott', 'have', 'be', 'closet', 'Why', 'did', 'characters', 'have', 'go', 'lame', 'How', 'many', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'question', 'line', 'School', 'Special', 'Why', 'did', 'Scott', 'assume', 'James', 'gave', 'disease', 'Why', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'wife', 'are', 'tons', 'cliches', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'name', 'most', 'were', 'offensive.What', 'can', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'chance', 'be', 'guest', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'brilliant', 'psycho', 'thriller', 'was', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'times', 'even', 'laughable']",N/A

835616,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0002IQE2I,trebe,"[1, 1]","The 24th Day (2004) is a rather daring drama that explores some controversial subjects, including safe sex, HIV, AIDS, guilt, and revenge.  The movie is based on a play by Tony Piccirillo, who also directs the film.  The 24th Day features some extremely strong performances by James Marsden and Scott Speedman, as two men who's paths crossed once, having a most unusual reunion.  Spoilers follow in this discussion of the film, so proceed further at your own risk.Dan (James Marsden), a gay man, and his friend Isabella (Sophia Vergara), meet Tom (Scott Speedman) in a bar.  After spending some time together, Isabella departs, and Dan winds up at Tom's apartment, where the discussion goes from movie trivia, to sexual habits, as Tom expresses an interest in how many partners Dan has had.  The situation becomes even more awkward, when although he can't recall the details, Dan realizes that he and Tom had a one night stand, five years before.  When Dan attempts to leave, Tom suddenly attacks, and Dan finds himself a prisoner handcuffed to a chair.Tom reveals that he is HIV positive, and draws a blood sample from Dan.  He says that his only sexual encounter with a man, was with Dan, and if the sample comes back as HIV positive, he will kill Dan.  Tom leaves to deliver the sample to a friend, and then returns to the apartment to await the results of the test.The day of the abduction is the 24th day that Tom has been aware that he is HIV positive.  Except for some flashbacks, most of the rest of the film features the two men together in the apartment.  An incident where Dan takes a crap in his pants while tied to the chair, is something that might actually happen, and it is turned into an opportunity for Dan to stage an escape attempt.  Although it fails and isn't executed very well, it is one of the film's few action scenes.As they await the results of the blood test Tom and Dan have a number of conversations.  While the dialog is usually well-written, some of the conversations are pretty ridiculous, and the attitudes of the characters are not very realistic, given the situation.  The discussions about colleges, sports, and favorite Charlie's Angel, might be perfectly reasonable between two buddies, but don't quite seem appropriate, when one person is threatening another's life.The conversation becomes deadly serious later, as Tom continues to test Dan, while the prisoner maintains that he is not to blame.  The revelation of the test results, deflates the tension, and brings matters to a rather somber conclusion.  While The 24th Day can't maintain a consistent level of tension, and meanders a bit off track in the middle, it deals with some provocative issues, and bravely explores some sensitive subjects.  With a rating of 3.5 stars, the movie is available on Amazon's Instant Video, and currently free to Amazon Prime members.",4,"overdramatic perhaps, but bravely tackles a controversial subject, while posing some tough questions...",1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,2864,"['24th', 'Day', '2004', 'rather', 'daring', 'drama', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'including', 'safe', 'sex', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'guilt', 'revenge', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'Tony', 'Piccirillo', 'who', 'also', 'film', '24th', 'Day', 'extremely', 'strong', 'performances', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'paths', 'crossed', 'once', 'having', 'most', 'unusual', 'reunion', 'Spoilers', 'follow', 'discussion', 'film', 'so', 'proceed', 'further', 'own', 'risk.Dan', 'James', 'Marsden', 'gay', 'man', 'friend', 'Isabella', 'Sophia', 'Vergara', 'meet', 'Tom', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'bar', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'Isabella', 'Dan', 'up', 'Tom', 'apartment', 'where', 'discussion', 'movie', 'trivia', 'sexual', 'habits', 'Tom', 'interest', 'how', 'many', 'partners', 'Dan', 'had', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'details', 'Dan', 'Tom', 'had', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'five', 'years', 'before', 'When', 'Dan', 'leave', 'Tom', 'suddenly', 'Dan', 'prisoner', 'handcuffed', 'chair.Tom', 'HIV', 'positive', 'blood', 'sample', 'Dan', 'only', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'man', 'was', 'Dan', 'sample', 'back', 'HIV', 'positive', 'will', 'kill', 'Dan', 'Tom', 'deliver', 'sample', 'friend', 'then', 'returns', 'apartment', 'await', 'results', 'test.The', 'day', 'abduction', '24th', 'day', 'Tom', 'been', 'aware', 'HIV', 'positive', 'flashbacks', 'most', 'rest', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'together', 'apartment', 'incident', 'where', 'Dan', 'crap', 'pants', 'tied', 'chair', 'something', 'might', 'actually', 'happen', 'turned', 'opportunity', 'Dan', 'stage', 'escape', 'attempt', ""n't"", 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'film', 'few', 'action', 'scenes.As', 'await', 'results', 'blood', 'test', 'Tom', 'Dan', 'have', 'number', 'conversations', 'dialog', 'usually', 'well-written', 'conversations', 'are', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'given', 'situation', 'discussions', 'colleges', 'sports', 'favorite', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'might', 'be', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'two', 'buddies', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'appropriate', 'when', 'one', 'person', 'threatening', 'life.The', 'conversation', 'deadly', 'serious', 'later', 'Tom', 'test', 'Dan', 'prisoner', 'not', 'blame', 'revelation', 'test', 'results', 'tension', 'matters', 'rather', 'somber', 'conclusion', '24th', 'Day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'consistent', 'level', 'tension', 'meanders', 'bit', 'off', 'track', 'middle', 'provocative', 'issues', 'bravely', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'rating', '3.5', 'stars', 'movie', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'currently', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'members']",N/A
