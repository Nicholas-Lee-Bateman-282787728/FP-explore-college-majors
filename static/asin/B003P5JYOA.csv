Slow at the start, picks up speed a bit in the middle keeps up that speed till the end. Several dialogue scenes that I felt served the need to pad the running time. I watch a lot of so called &#34;bad&#34; movies, but how serious they can take themselves usually adds to the humor. Recommended for horror-comedy film buffs. Loved the alternate for this film better, it is known as KFZ: Kentucky Fried Zombies for region 2 release. Still an ok flick to watch with friends, if you enjoy the low budget camp it has to offer.",3,"DIEner, get it?

Dead humor with rollin-over-in-the-grave type laughs.  I was totally expecting a decaying heap of cliched zombie lameness and groan-inducing absurdity.  But Diener delivers a somewhat fresh and subtle serving of horror comedy.  It takes an almost serious approach to a goofy (and deadly) situation.  Some pretty good times--nothing earth-shattering, but it won't give you the urge to dine and dash.Ken is your basic 9 to 5 sociopath/serial killer that travels from town to town.  At one particular allnight diner he gets his usual psychotic urges and goes on a little killing spree.  One cook, one waitress...dead in the walk-in freezer.  When more customers and a local police officer start walking in, Ken tries to play it off like he's a new employee.  That dilemma becomes increasingly more difficult when his past victims come back to life.What follows is a series of bumbling mishaps and frantic predicaments.  We've got a killer that uses a knife or gun to contol customers, and some duct tape or bungee cords to restain the zombies.  The madman and his hostages eventually will have to work together in order to survive the night.DIEner(get it?) is written and directed by newcomer Patrick Horvath.  It's got a meager budget of about half million and was shot in only 8 days.  It has decent gore and laughs but nothing too extreme.  Quirky might be a fitting description.  More blood or some gratuitous nudity would have helped of course.  Anyuway, it's a nice change of pace that might acquire a small cult following.  3.5 stars.",4,This zombie flick is grrr-ate!

The main character who is a movie within a movie because he is a serial killer and as arrogant as they come and from the time he opens his mouth, you wish he would get eaten has no rhyme or reason to his killing.  He is a ""Jason"" or ""Michael"" wannabe.  To be honest, my reason for purchasing this DVD was the title.  Corny huh?  It was just so catchy and cutsie I had to see for myself.  Poor Rose the waitress who spends her night shift getting to know ""Ken"" and has a meaningful conversation for the whole of 5 minutes and I feel she thinks she has a connection to gets offed along with the cook, but we don't see the cook get the ""axe"" (ha! ha!, axe--cook, sorry) but she gets revenge and it takes off from there.

1356584,A1TSCIS665XVBP,B003P5JYOA,"James G. Carlson ""the Urban Artist Group""","[3, 3]","When I purchased ""DIEner (get it?)"" I suppose I had some preconceived notions about it. What I eventually got when it arrived and I watched it was something else altogether, though. It wasn't bad; it was just...well, different. I almost expected good zombie makeup, decent acting, and a bunch of bumbling pseudo-slapstick humor. Instead I watched a film that had fair zombie makeup, decent acting, and a sort of restrained humor that highly emphasized the absurdity of the whole thing.When a sociopath/serial killer by the name of Ken is eating at a remote roadside diner he decides that he'd rather murder the cook and the waitress than pay the check and leave. It doesn't take long for new customers to enter the grease pot establishment, but by that point Ken has the dead cook and waitress stashed away in the walk-in freezer, and Ken has decided to act as if he's an employee at the joint. With an arguing couple and a local cop waiting for their orders, Ken's employee act is proving rather difficult. But when the two corpses in the walk-in freezer get up and begin shuffling about the kitchen, the jig is up for Ken. He's then forced to find ways to restrain the zombies and keep his new hostages in check. Things just keep getting more and more out of hand, however, and ultimately Ken is forced to join up with his hostages to survive this weird debacle and minor plague of the living dead situation.That's about as much as I can put down without spoiling the film entirely. All in all, it's a fine addition to the zombie genre. A genre very near and dear to my heart, with my collection now up to nearly two-hundred titles. That's right, two-hundred zombie films in my collection. And I am always on the lookout for more. ""DIEner (get it?)"" will have to be placed on the second shelf down, maybe the third, as I arrange them in the order of their quality and storyline. But like I said, definitely a fine addition.",3,Not too shabby,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1925,"['When', 'purchased', 'DIEner', 'get', 'suppose', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'What', 'eventually', 'got', 'when', 'arrived', 'watched', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'well', 'different', 'almost', 'expected', 'good', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'decent', 'acting', 'bunch', 'bumbling', 'pseudo-slapstick', 'humor', 'Instead', 'watched', 'film', 'had', 'fair', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'decent', 'acting', 'sort', 'restrained', 'humor', 'highly', 'emphasized', 'absurdity', 'whole', 'thing.When', 'sociopath/serial', 'killer', 'name', 'Ken', 'eating', 'remote', 'roadside', 'diner', ""'d"", 'rather', 'murder', 'cook', 'waitress', 'pay', 'check', 'leave', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'new', 'customers', 'enter', 'grease', 'pot', 'establishment', 'point', 'Ken', 'dead', 'cook', 'waitress', 'stashed', 'away', 'walk-in', 'freezer', 'Ken', 'decided', 'act', 'employee', 'joint', 'arguing', 'couple', 'local', 'cop', 'waiting', 'orders', 'Ken', 'employee', 'act', 'proving', 'rather', 'difficult', 'when', 'two', 'corpses', 'walk-in', 'freezer', 'get', 'up', 'begin', 'shuffling', 'kitchen', 'jig', 'up', 'Ken', 'then', 'forced', 'find', 'ways', 'restrain', 'zombies', 'keep', 'new', 'hostages', 'check', 'Things', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'hand', 'however', 'ultimately', 'Ken', 'forced', 'join', 'up', 'hostages', 'survive', 'weird', 'debacle', 'minor', 'plague', 'living', 'dead', 'situation.That', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'put', 'down', 'spoiling', 'film', 'entirely', 'fine', 'addition', 'zombie', 'genre', 'genre', 'very', 'dear', 'heart', 'collection', 'now', 'up', 'nearly', 'two-hundred', 'titles', 'right', 'two-hundred', 'zombie', 'films', 'collection', 'am', 'always', 'lookout', 'more', 'DIEner', 'get', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'placed', 'second', 'shelf', 'down', 'maybe', 'third', 'arrange', 'order', 'quality', 'storyline', 'said', 'definitely', 'fine', 'addition']",N/A
