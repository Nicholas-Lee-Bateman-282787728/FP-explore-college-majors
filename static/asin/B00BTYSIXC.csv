1638326,A1VZDPPHLYZ0KB,B00BTYSIXC,Angie Perez,"[8, 8]","Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth are fantastic in this movie.  Their talent shows in the raw emotion of the characters they portray.  Shirley's character &#34;Lola&#34; is married to Burt's character &#34;Doc.&#34;  Lola and Doc have no children and a loveless marriage for the most part.  Lola has a dog named &#34;Sheba&#34; who is not shown because he ran away.  Hence, the title, COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA.  Doc is an alcoholic who has bouts of rage.  Lola is a house wife who is always fearful Doc will start drinking.  Doc and Lola rent a room to an attractive young woman and a personal crisis ensues.

It made a lifelong lasting impression upon me regarding alcoholism and the sadness of lost youth. What Shirley Booth brings to Lola is indescribably profound and deep. Burt Lancaster playing against his traditional masculine alpha male type was a masterstroke in what must seemed to be risky casting.
