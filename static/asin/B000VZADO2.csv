It actually has a pretty good cast, which may fool some people into buying it (it certainly fooled me), but don't do it!  This has to be the most pointless, banal, mean-spirited and foul-mouthed ""Christmas"" movie ever, & everyone even remotely involved in it's creation should be ashamed of themselves.  (ie, Mickey Rooney took his awful character from A Night At The Museum a few steps further).

This move is truly wretched.  It tries for cynical laughs but can't get them, It rips off National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation but hasn't a shred of the things that gave that movie humor and warmth, and then rips off Weekend with Bernie for good measure.
