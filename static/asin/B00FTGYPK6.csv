Gregory""","[0, 0]","I own her other blu ray release of Funhouse Tour Down under, so I knew going into this that as long as I like the album that the show would not disappoint. I own the fan release version of this album and that was a totally solid album. Though you get 7 &#34;bonus&#34; songs it's not like they are throwaways or rough versions, they were great songs. And this show is great as well. Although the guy who came out between some of the songs was a bit annoying, the parts showcasing Pink were not to be missed. she usually throws in a song or two that she covers (previously she did Crazy and Bohemian Rhapsody (by Gnarls Barkley and Queen respectively) and she really impressed me. Most artists may sound great singing their own songs but usually they fall a bit flat with covers. The show was very physical and had some trapeze/wire work, but that didn't detract from the vocals (take that Britney Spears). Pink is a true artist and doesn't disappoint. I'm looking forward to her next show/album eagerly. I missed her this past year due to being in the hospital. I'll definitely catch her in person next time around. The bonus material is a bit silly. it has more of the annoying clown guy and a redneck version of &#34;Slut Like You&#34; but the main reason to buy is for the actual show, which is top notch. It's great to see live performers not lip synching. if there is any pre-recorded parts it has to do with the background vocals (as on the album she does the background as well) and additional sounds/voices, but the main vocal is live. Anyone who is a fan of rock concerts or just well done concerts should pick this up. her vocals are strong even though the physical demands are great. You'd never know she recently had a child.

1673388,AZT3V29NJH4MG,B00FTGYPK6,"Daniel Moore ""TheMovieBuff""","[1, 1]","I had tickets to go to P!nk's show in Kansas City back in November but moved to the West coast before the concert. I was disappointed that I didn't get to see her live but this Blu-ray disc is a pretty amazing substitute. This movie puts you in the front row of her high-octane show.P!nk's vocals tend to be overlooked by many people but she demonstrates in this show that she can hit the high notes better than her peers, all while doing flips 30 feet up in the air. This 90-plus minute show takes you through all the stages of love. She performs a number of songs from her recent hit album and throws in several fan favorites from throughout her career.My favorite part of the concert is when she performs a stripped-down acoustic set halfway through the show. You can hear the grit and agony in her voice. P!nk interacts with the crowd several times and you can tell she genuinely appreciates her fans. It always amazes me how she can one-up herself each tour. She always finds a way to thoroughly entertain the audience, all while putting her safety (seemingly) on the back burner. There aren't many entertainers out there who will strap themselves in a harness and fly over the audience, or be catapulted vertically from the stage.I highly recommend this Blu-ray to any of P!nk's fans, past or present.",5,P!nk does it again!,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1307,"['had', 'tickets', 'go', 'P', 'nk', 'show', 'Kansas', 'City', 'back', 'November', 'moved', 'West', 'coast', 'concert', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'live', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'substitute', 'movie', 'front', 'row', 'high-octane', 'show.P', 'nk', 'vocals', 'tend', 'be', 'overlooked', 'many', 'people', 'show', 'can', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'better', 'peers', 'doing', 'flips', '30', 'feet', 'up', 'air', '90-plus', 'minute', 'show', 'stages', 'love', 'number', 'songs', 'recent', 'hit', 'album', 'several', 'fan', 'favorites', 'career.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'concert', 'when', 'stripped-down', 'acoustic', 'set', 'halfway', 'show', 'can', 'hear', 'grit', 'agony', 'voice', 'P', 'nk', 'interacts', 'crowd', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'tell', 'genuinely', 'fans', 'always', 'how', 'can', 'one-up', 'tour', 'always', 'way', 'thoroughly', 'entertain', 'audience', 'putting', 'safety', 'seemingly', 'back', 'burner', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'entertainers', 'who', 'will', 'strap', 'harness', 'fly', 'audience', 'be', 'catapulted', 'vertically', 'stage.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'P', 'nk', 'fans', 'past', 'present']",P!nk: The Truth About Love Tour: Live From Melbourne
