However, I actually ended up really liking this movie, both for the way it intelligently used the very interesting science of game theory as well as the movie itself.  Waking Ned Devine is an independent film from Ireland (it was actually shot on the Isle of Man) about two friends in a very small Irish village (population 52).  After the town finds out that someone among them won the Irish national lottery, Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen), and his friend Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) try to find out who it was and hit them up for some of the cash.  Jackie is a bit of a slick player, who knows just how to get what he wants, while Michael is a more subdued guy who is kind of along for the ride.Jackie soon finds out that a man from the village named Ned Devine won the money, but dropped dead from shock immediately after the announcement of the winning numbers.  He and Michael then devise an elaborate plan to collect the winnings.The movie is surprisingly very funny, and while many Americans won't get all of it, seeing how a lot of it is very Irish-based humor, those that do are in for a treat.

The delightful shenanigans of the two central characters as they attempt to involve an entire Irish hamlet in a scheme to cash in on the winning lottery ticket of a deceased friend was almost as classic as a keystone cops routine.  The plight of a small dying community in a world of big cities is hardly unfamiliar to me having spent some of my earlier years in a similar community in southern Minnesota.  The formulaic activities of the elderly, left behind by the flight of the younger generation to the cities, is definitely illustrated, as are the narrow choices available to those young people who have chosen to remain in their native town.  My favorite scenes are the motorcycle ride by the two elderly comrades through the backroads to beat the lottery agent to the winner's home, and the race of the village grump to the phone box to report the fraud.

Having become fixated on Irish music and culture, a passion I still have to this day, I was encouraged to watch this movie by a lady friend. It ended up on my Christmas list. At the time, however, I didn't have a DVD player, so the movie was still on VHS.The story of Waking Ned is at once simple and at the same time complicated. It takes place in a small village off the coast of Ireland, one of those places where everybody knows just about everybody else. Reminds me of my parents' home town in Wisconsin, though considerably smaller. This Irish village, however, seems composed largely of elderly folk with a few youngsters thrown into the mix. They live simple, easy lives, playing the lottery without necessarily expecting to win.Things get complicated when it's discovered that the winner of the most recent lottery is a member of this small community. Lifelong friends Jackie O'Shea (played by the late Ian Bannen), and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), decide to find out who the winner is and make sure they're that person's best friends when they go to claim the money. Things become much less clear-cut, however, when Jackie discovers that the winner, Ned Devine, died of a heart attack brought on by the shock of discovering he'd become a millionaire. Not to be dissuaded, Jackie persuades Michael to help him in a scheme to impersonate Ned and claim the winnings. Rather than keeping it all for themselves however, Jackie decides to divide the money among all the residents of the village in response to what he believes is a vision from Ned. Ned, a kind and generous man in life, would probably have done exactly this had he lived to claim the money, so Jackie decides to go ahead with the scheme. The tricky part of course is convincing the entire village to go along with the whole thing. Matters are almost put to rest before they really get started when the man from the lottery shows up much sooner than expected, forcing Jackie, who had originally intended to impersonate Ned, to lay the burden on a reluctant Michael's shoulders. Michael, with no other options, rides his motorcycle, buck naked, from the beach where the two were rehearsing for the interview, all the way back to Ned's place while Jackie delays the man from Dublin.All in all Waking Ned is definitely my idea of what a commedy should be, not too heavily reliant on crude jokes and profanity. In other words, true humor. Add to it the potential stumbling block of Lizzie Quinn, the village's resident grinch, and the subplot of the romance between Pig Finn, the local pig farmer, and Maggie, the farmer's daughter, and what you have is a delightfully lighthearted Irish tale of tragedy and triumph mixed liberally with humor. The musical score is particularly fitting near the very end of the film, which details the opposite fates of the villagers and Lizzie Quinn simultaneously. The film ends with a triumphantly beautiful rendition of The Parting Glass, one of my absolute favorite Irish tunes.So all in all, I found this to be an excellent film and can't wait to own it on DVD.",5,"Quite simply, Waking Ned is a superb film.",1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,3136,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', '2000', 'when', 'was', 'lad', 'twenty', 'Having', 'become', 'fixated', 'Irish', 'music', 'culture', 'passion', 'still', 'have', 'day', 'was', 'encouraged', 'watch', 'movie', 'lady', 'friend', 'ended', 'up', 'Christmas', 'list', 'time', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'player', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'VHS.The', 'story', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'once', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'complicated', 'place', 'small', 'village', 'coast', 'Ireland', 'one', 'places', 'where', 'everybody', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'parents', 'home', 'town', 'Wisconsin', 'considerably', 'smaller', 'Irish', 'village', 'however', 'composed', 'largely', 'elderly', 'folk', 'few', 'youngsters', 'thrown', 'mix', 'live', 'simple', 'easy', 'lives', 'playing', 'lottery', 'necessarily', 'expecting', 'win.Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'discovered', 'winner', 'most', 'recent', 'lottery', 'member', 'small', 'community', 'Lifelong', 'friends', 'Jackie', ""O'Shea"", 'played', 'late', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'Michael', ""O'Sullivan"", 'David', 'Kelly', 'decide', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'winner', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'person', 'best', 'friends', 'when', 'go', 'claim', 'money', 'become', 'much', 'less', 'clear-cut', 'however', 'when', 'Jackie', 'winner', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'brought', 'shock', 'discovering', ""'d"", 'become', 'millionaire', 'Not', 'be', 'dissuaded', 'Jackie', 'Michael', 'help', 'scheme', 'impersonate', 'Ned', 'claim', 'winnings', 'Rather', 'keeping', 'however', 'Jackie', 'divide', 'money', 'residents', 'village', 'response', 'what', 'vision', 'Ned', 'Ned', 'kind', 'generous', 'man', 'life', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'done', 'exactly', 'had', 'lived', 'claim', 'money', 'so', 'Jackie', 'go', 'ahead', 'scheme', 'tricky', 'part', 'course', 'convincing', 'entire', 'village', 'go', 'along', 'whole', 'thing', 'Matters', 'are', 'almost', 'put', 'rest', 'really', 'get', 'started', 'when', 'man', 'lottery', 'up', 'much', 'sooner', 'expected', 'forcing', 'Jackie', 'who', 'had', 'originally', 'intended', 'impersonate', 'Ned', 'lay', 'burden', 'reluctant', 'Michael', 'shoulders', 'Michael', 'other', 'options', 'motorcycle', 'buck', 'naked', 'beach', 'where', 'two', 'were', 'rehearsing', 'interview', 'way', 'back', 'Ned', 'place', 'Jackie', 'man', 'Dublin.All', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'definitely', 'idea', 'what', 'commedy', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'too', 'heavily', 'reliant', 'crude', 'jokes', 'profanity', 'other', 'words', 'true', 'humor', 'Add', 'potential', 'stumbling', 'block', 'Lizzie', 'Quinn', 'village', 'resident', 'grinch', 'subplot', 'romance', 'Pig', 'Finn', 'local', 'pig', 'farmer', 'Maggie', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'what', 'have', 'delightfully', 'lighthearted', 'Irish', 'tale', 'tragedy', 'triumph', 'mixed', 'liberally', 'humor', 'musical', 'score', 'particularly', 'fitting', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'details', 'opposite', 'fates', 'villagers', 'Lizzie', 'Quinn', 'simultaneously', 'film', 'triumphantly', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'Parting', 'Glass', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Irish', 'tunes.So', 'found', 'be', 'excellent', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'DVD']",Waking Ned Devine VHS

When they eventually do so and call on Ned and find his dead hand still clutching the winning ticket, they have to decided what to do; to be honest and hand the ticket back or to take advantage of the situation and pretend one of them is Ned. The temptation is irresistible.But, not being selfish, they want the whole village to share in Ned's good fortune. And so they hold a village meeting and put forward their plan; provided that each villager will sign a form committing them to secrecy, the money will be shared out and each will receive 150,000. But some quick thinking is required and many lies and evasions follow when a representative of the Lottery comes to the village to verify the claim and the claimant's identity and arrives in the middle of Ned's funeral service and Jackie O'shea's funeral oration. And their plan is under threat from another quarter; the evil-minded witch of the village demands 1000,000 in hush money!There is a nice little love interest in which James Nesbitt as Pig Finn is excellent as as pig-man, too poor and smelling too much of pig to be thought at all desirable by his beloved. 150,000  would see them both right.But it is Ian Bannen as Jackie O'Shea, still full of his usual energy and Joie de vivre, who is central to the film and raises it so well above the average. How sad that he should die so soon after the film's completion.

But it's the winking Irish cuteness, widespread fraud, lovable characters and tight plotting that make this movie ""Devine"" fun.One of the few thrills in Jackie O'Shea's (Ian Bannen) life is the lotto. And so when he and his best buddy Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) discover that someone in their tiny Irish village of Tullymore (population: around fifty, not including animals) has won, they go to absurd lengths to find out. After a few dead ends, they find out: kindly Ned Devine. The problem is, Ned is dead of the shock, with a lottery ticket in his hand and a silly grin on his face. That night, Jackie has a dream about Ned offering to ""share the chicken,"" and becomes convinced that his dead buddy wants him to cash the ticket.Jackie and Michael call the lotto and claim that Ned wants to claim his money. The lotto officials duly send out a friendly representative to Tullymore -- and Michael, who has ""never told a lie in his life,"" finds himself in Ned's house, in Jackie's clothes, pretending to be Ned. The problem? The representative plans to ask some of his fellow villagers to confirm that ""Ned"" is who he says he is. And so the conspiracy of lies begins to spread.That's not the entire plot, needless to say. There's a love triangle between single mom Maggie (Susan Lynch), loving pig farmer Pig Finn (James Nesbitt), and wealthy wild boy Pat Mulligan. Maggie loves Pig, but she doesn't love the smell he brings with him. There's the question of who the father of Maggie's stoic kid Maurice (Robert Hickey) is -- and be forewarned, there are some red herrings flung toward the audience. Jackie's wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) is less-than-pleased by these extralegal activies. And the local creepy old lady Lizzy Quinn (Eileen Dromey) is waging a one-woman war on the village of winners, because they didn't give her more than her share.The thing that makes this film work is its charming lack of seriousness. You don't really care that the people in it are committing fraud -- after all, it's what dear ol' Ned would've wanted. You merely want Jackie and Michael to succeed, for Maggie to marry Pig, and for everyone to retire rich, fat and happy. The lack of seriousness is shown in the constant jokes about fruity soaps, alcohol, nude octogenarian motorcyclists, and the funniest almost-love-scene ever.Ian Bannen is truly lovable as Jackie -- he's not perfect, he has plenty of flaws, but he's charmingly generous and honest. David Kelley is solemnly cute as Michael, whether it's tearing up at his own eulogy or biking for his life with no clothes on. Fionnula Flanagan is fully believable as his wife, showing a steadfast fire and concern for her husband, just in case he bites off more than he can chew. The main problem would be Robert Hickey. The late Ned shows more animation than this kid. Parents can probably allow their kids to watch this -- there's no sex, profanity or violence, although there is some unsexy male nudity (of the skinny-dipping variety).""Waking Ned Devine"" is a comedy for people who are sick of comedies.

503638,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,B00000ILEA,Jennifer Litchfield,"[5, 5]","Waking Ned Devine is one of those charming and funny movies that you just can't help liking.  Surely everyone has pondered on what life would be like if one won the lottery. . . . . . . . . .  In the quaint Irish town of Tullymore, an elderly pair of jokers, Jackie and Michael, discover that one of the villagers has won the National Lottery's First Division.  There's a problem though - the villager in question is dead.  And so Jackie and Michael embark on an increasingly complicated scheme to convince the lottery scrutineers that Ned Devine is in fact still alive and well, and eligible to claim the 7 million winnings.It's a refreshing change to watch a comedy where the protagonists are largely - to put it bluntly - old.  The late Ian Bannen and David Kelly turn in marvelous performances as the irascible duo.  Not only do they manage to create and capture the humour of the film, they also touchingly portray the affection each character has for the other.But it is its own unique brand of humour for which Waking Ned Devine will most likely be remembered.  The motley collection of villagers should raise a few chuckles, and the sight of a naked scrawny old man tearing along the Irish byroads on a motorbike will leave the viewer in stitches.  However, the rather macabre method of dispatch dealt to the story's 'villain', while it is funny at the time, doesn't bear thinking about too closely.Interestingly, the movie was filmed in the Isle of Man, rather than Ireland; nevertheless, the scenery is beautiful, and is complemented by some stirring Irish music (although this is a little loud in comparison with the dialogue).  Overall though, this is a great film to watch to unwind a little.",4,&quot;What are you going to spend your half on?&quot;,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,1705,"['Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'one', 'charming', 'funny', 'movies', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'Surely', 'everyone', 'pondered', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'won', 'lottery', 'quaint', 'Irish', 'town', 'Tullymore', 'elderly', 'pair', 'jokers', 'Jackie', 'Michael', 'discover', 'one', 'villagers', 'won', 'National', 'Lottery', 'First', 'Division', 'problem', 'villager', 'question', 'dead', 'so', 'Jackie', 'Michael', 'embark', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'scheme', 'convince', 'lottery', 'scrutineers', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'fact', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'eligible', 'claim', '7', 'million', 'winnings.It', 'refreshing', 'change', 'watch', 'comedy', 'where', 'protagonists', 'are', 'largely', 'put', 'bluntly', 'old', 'late', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'David', 'Kelly', 'turn', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'irascible', 'duo', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'manage', 'create', 'capture', 'humour', 'film', 'also', 'touchingly', 'affection', 'character', 'other.But', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'humour', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'motley', 'collection', 'villagers', 'should', 'raise', 'few', 'chuckles', 'sight', 'naked', 'scrawny', 'old', 'man', 'tearing', 'Irish', 'byroads', 'motorbike', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'stitches', 'However', 'rather', 'macabre', 'method', 'dispatch', 'dealt', 'story', ""'villain"", 'funny', 'time', ""n't"", 'bear', 'thinking', 'too', 'closely.Interestingly', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Isle', 'Man', 'rather', 'Ireland', 'nevertheless', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'complemented', 'stirring', 'Irish', 'music', 'little', 'loud', 'comparison', 'dialogue', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'unwind', 'little']",Waking Ned Devine VHS

503657,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00000ILEA,Larry L. Looney,"[1, 1]","This film, written and directed by Kirk Jones III, is one of my all-time favorites - and it's only 5 years old.  Telling the story of how unimaginable riches can affect the lives of people in a small Irish village, the writing and the characterizations here are absolutely perfect.  Without making fun of the people who live in the village, Jones manages to find the humor in their lives - and in this situation - and he lays it out before our eyes in a very loving, respectful way.  When I first saw this in the theatre, I laughed until I had tears running down my cheeks - not at mindless slapstick, but at real, deep humor.  Some of the tears were from pure emotion as well - these are characters who will get into your heart and stay there for years to come.The two main protagonists here are lifelong pals Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly - fans of FAWLTY TOWERS will remember him as the bumbling carpenter O'Reilly) - there is nothing in the world they would hesitate to do for each other, with the honesty and love that a long, deep friendship breeds.  Jackie is married to Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) - Michael is a widower who is obviously still very much in love with his departed wife (much to the consternation of a precious widow who lives in the village).  An inanimate character in the story is the Irish Lottery - many people in the village are regular players, each with his/her own dream of what to do with the winnings, should they fall their way.  One morning after a drawing on TV, Jackie discovers that there is a winner in the village, unidentified.  He and Michael hatch a scheme to find out the identity of the lucky party and make sure they are fast friends with them - when they discover that their old friend Ned Devine is the winner, they assume their job will be an easy one.  There's a small catch - Ned died of shock when he realized that he had hit the jackpot.  The rest of the film revolves around Jackie's newly-revised scheme - sure that he's doing what Ned would have wanted, he is determined to convince the man from the Lotto that Ned is alive.  Let the shenanigans and general hilarity begin - along with some genuinely touching emotional moments, and more than a little drama and suspense.We are treated to a wonderful cast of characters the likes of which is rare in a comedic film - each and every one of them is so very well-developed, and even the ones that display humorous aspects are never presented as caricatures.  This is where the respect held by Jones for his story and characters becomes valuable to the point of being a rare, precious thing.  The interplay between the various characters is extremely well-drawn.  Annie's attempts to coax `the boys' back from a `life of crime and prison' are from her heart - it's easy to see that she loves Michael almost as much as her husband.  The on-again-off-again courtship between Pig Finn (James Nesbitt) and Maggie O'Toole (Susan Lynch, who played the Selkie in THE SECRET OF ROAN INNISH) is sweet but never cloying - and Eileen Dromey is absolutely perfectly detestable as `the witch' Lizzy Quinn, whose greed and contempt for her neighbors threatens to throw a spanner into the works for everyone.If you've managed to miss this gem - don't wait any longer.  Since it wasn't a huge box-office smash, it might be a little hard to find for rental - so go ahead and take the plunge and buy a copy.

""Waking Ned"" comes from a film tradition that delighted us with ""The Full Monty"" and more recently with ""Calendar Girls"".This delightful story takes place in a small Irish village (population 52) and is enacted by a cast of actors that I previously wouldn't have been able to pick out of a police line-up.  But these are characters that you quickly come to identify with and care for, and despite the fact that they plan to pull off a small defrauding of the Irish Lottery, you not only want them to pull it off - you don't feel like they're engaging in particularly criminal behavior.  Particular Kudos go to Ian Bannen as the twinkly-eyed Jackie O'Shea who is scamming pretty much the entire movie, but doing it in such a way you almost wish you were there with him.  David Kelly is wonderful as the scrupulous Michael who ""never told a lie in his life"" but becomes central in the plot to impersonate dead lottery winner Ned Devine.  Fionnula Flanagan is also fantastic as Jackie's wife, Annie, who is the voice of ethics and morals to the scheming Jackie.

503679,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00000ILEA,Matthew Horner,"[8, 11]","There is something very appealing to me about the humor that comes from the British Isles. Its comedies often do not seem as self-conscious as American ones sometimes do, and what they find amusing often comes from the unlikeliest sources. I realize that some people are loathe to watch a movie of any type from England, Scotland or Ireland because they have difficulty understanding the dialects. I admit I've seen some which I wish had had subtitles. I did not find Waking Ned Devine, which is Irish, hard to understand, but then I've seen a heck of a lot of movies in my time.Clever and quite charming, Waking Ned Devine is a simple tale about a tiny village whose residents suddenly find themselves faced with a very big event. A small article in a Dublin newspaper states that the week's winning national lottery ticket was purchased in their fair county. Since the village is the only one in the county, life-long friends Jackie O'Shay [Ian Bannen] and Michael O'Sullivan [David Kelly] decide to find out who won by getting a list of names of people who bought a ticket. They reason that the winner will want to share in his or her good fortune. The list contains 52 names. They to throw a dinner party for the ticket holders, ply them with good Irish whiskey and try find out who got lucky. No one seems to have won, but afterwards, they realize that one person, Ned Devine, did not show up. Jackie decides to visit the elderly man, and upon entering his house, quickly finds out that Ned has died from shock. The winning ticket is still clutched in one hand. Ned still has a smile on his face.What follows is a madcap plan to claim the prize, which is worth nearly $10,000,000. The money cannot be paid to a dead man, and Ned had no living relatives. You will have to see the video to discover who, if anyone, gets the money. It is certainly a merry pursuit.The cast is uniformly excellent. The village is peopled with folks who appear eccentric, but I am not sure how different they are from many people I have met in small towns. I think when you live in such a place, there is a camaraderie you don't find in big cities. Because everyone knows so much about everyone else, there is perhaps less pressure not to be yourself. After all, most people's true personalities are more interesting than the facades they wear.All the beauty that is the Irish countryside is lovingly and exquisitely photographed. If the village is a set and not a real place, it is authentic, down to the thatched roofs and low doorways. The Gaelic music used throughout seems especially beautiful here, because the setting is the source of the music.Much of the humor in Waking Ned Devine comes from looking at a group of people try to handle a situation which is, for them, unchartered waters. The naive way in which the villagers rationalize their actions by thinking it's what the beloved Ned would have wanted is utterly charming. These are dreamers rather than schemers.First time director Kirk Jones has achieved a rare feat. He has created a place and a group of people so seemingly real that you wish you could go to visit them one day. For such a relatively short movie, he has created a great number of interesting characters, including the spry but elderly Jackie and Michael, the jolly tavern keeper, the local pig farmer, the resident witch, the bemused priest, and the young boy who's wise beyond his years.",4,Eccentric Irish village = great comedy,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,3406,"['something', 'very', 'appealing', 'humor', 'British', 'Isles', 'comedies', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'as', 'self-conscious', 'American', 'ones', 'sometimes', 'do', 'what', 'find', 'amusing', 'often', 'unlikeliest', 'sources', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'loathe', 'watch', 'movie', 'type', 'England', 'Scotland', 'Ireland', 'have', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'dialects', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wish', 'had', 'had', 'subtitles', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'Irish', 'hard', 'understand', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heck', 'lot', 'movies', 'time.Clever', 'quite', 'charming', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'simple', 'tale', 'tiny', 'village', 'residents', 'suddenly', 'find', 'faced', 'very', 'big', 'event', 'small', 'article', 'Dublin', 'newspaper', 'week', 'winning', 'national', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'was', 'purchased', 'fair', 'county', 'village', 'only', 'one', 'county', 'life-long', 'friends', 'Jackie', ""O'Shay"", '[', 'Ian', 'Bannen', ']', 'Michael', ""O'Sullivan"", '[', 'David', 'Kelly', ']', 'decide', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'won', 'getting', 'list', 'names', 'people', 'who', 'bought', 'ticket', 'reason', 'winner', 'will', 'want', 'share', 'good', 'fortune', 'list', '52', 'names', 'throw', 'dinner', 'party', 'ticket', 'holders', 'ply', 'good', 'Irish', 'whiskey', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'got', 'lucky', 'one', 'have', 'won', 'afterwards', 'realize', 'one', 'person', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'Jackie', 'visit', 'elderly', 'man', 'entering', 'house', 'quickly', 'out', 'Ned', 'died', 'shock', 'winning', 'ticket', 'still', 'clutched', 'one', 'hand', 'Ned', 'still', 'smile', 'face.What', 'madcap', 'plan', 'claim', 'prize', 'nearly', '10,000,000', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'paid', 'dead', 'man', 'Ned', 'had', 'living', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'video', 'discover', 'who', 'anyone', 'money', 'certainly', 'merry', 'pursuit.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'village', 'peopled', 'folks', 'who', 'appear', 'eccentric', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'small', 'towns', 'think', 'when', 'live', 'place', 'camaraderie', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'big', 'cities', 'everyone', 'so', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'perhaps', 'less', 'pressure', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'people', 'true', 'personalities', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'facades', 'wear.All', 'beauty', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'lovingly', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', 'village', 'set', 'not', 'real', 'place', 'authentic', 'down', 'thatched', 'roofs', 'low', 'doorways', 'Gaelic', 'music', 'used', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'here', 'setting', 'source', 'music.Much', 'humor', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'looking', 'group', 'people', 'try', 'handle', 'situation', 'unchartered', 'waters', 'naive', 'way', 'villagers', 'rationalize', 'actions', 'thinking', 'what', 'beloved', 'Ned', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'utterly', 'charming', 'are', 'dreamers', 'rather', 'schemers.First', 'time', 'director', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'achieved', 'rare', 'feat', 'created', 'place', 'group', 'people', 'so', 'seemingly', 'real', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'visit', 'one', 'day', 'such', 'relatively', 'short', 'movie', 'created', 'great', 'number', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'spry', 'elderly', 'Jackie', 'Michael', 'jolly', 'tavern', 'keeper', 'local', 'pig', 'farmer', 'resident', 'witch', 'bemused', 'priest', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'wise', 'years']",Waking Ned Devine VHS

It combines the elements of comedy, death, love, the inquisitiveness of human nature, and the spirit of community in the small Irish village of Tulaigh Mor (Tullymore).When it is announced that the winner of the Irish Lottery is from this tiny village, curiosity gets the better of its inhabitants, especially two older fellows - Jackie and Michael - and they are determined to find out just who the lucky person is. They embark on a comical attempt to find just who has won by serving a chicken dinner with plenty of whiskey. By the end of the dinner, everyone is well fed and feeling garrulous from drink, but it becomes apparent that none of the villagers is admitting to holding the winning ticket. When one piece of chicken remains, it becomes obvious one resident of the village was not in attendance - Ned Devine.A late night visit to take Ned his chicken dinner reveals that Ned has died of a heart attack with the winning lottery ticket still in his hand. This starts a ruse to pretend that Ned is still alive and Jackie and Michael begin to spin their story that will enable one of them to claim the prize and share it with all of the village's inhabitants. All goes well until one of the villagers, a crabby old woman that no one likes, decides to report the sham and claim a huge chunk of the lottery winning for herself for reporting the scam. The lottery winnings total nearly 7 million pounds, enough to provide each villager with a nice nest egg if only the village residents unanimously can agree to the ruse, but the one crabby old crone proves to be the proverbial fly in the ointment.The ensuing story is clever and witty, offering up a charming glimpse into the life of a rural Irish community. There is also a love story that offers a most unexpected twist at the end, leaving the viewer with a surprise about Ned Devine that even his closest friends never knew. There is also a twist of fate that leaves the village's would be tattletale in an unexpected but delightfully funny predicament. I can't say what, but it is hilarious.The final scene always brings tears to my eyes as the villagers stand together raising a parting glass to their departed friend while the Irish song ""The Parting Glass"" is delivered in a rousing and emotionally powerful rendition.This movie is one that offers up a clever story line without the profanity and vulgarity that seem to permeate most films, so it is one that can be enjoyed by the family.

Two of the townsfolk; Jackie O'Shea and Michael O'Sullivan, after finding out that someone in their small town of 54 (If I remember correctly) has won the lottery, set about trying to find the winner and hopefully to cash in on the luck.Unfortunately, the winner; Ned Devine, died from the shock of winning and so Jackie and Michael decide to claim the prize and share it among the whole village. Two obstacles stand in their way; the village 'witch' and the lottery official. There is also a subplot involving a local pig farmer and his sweetheart, who would marry him were it not for the stench and is about to get married to someone a lot less malodorous and richer.Fortunately, this movie isn't as corny as one would expect, it really is funny without trying too hard to be.

Trouble is that the holder of the winning ticket died of shock with the winning ticket in his hand when he heard his numbers called off, so someone must pose in his place when the detective comes to verify the ID of the winner. Things get stickier and more problematic as layer upon layer of inventive Irish complications are added to the stew.My favorite story about this movie has passed into family lore. I told my somewhat deaf mother she would surely enjoy it, and she persisted in mis-hearing me when I gave her the title. Ever since, in our family, it's Making God Divine or, her next best guess, Waking Teddy Klein.

503707,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00000ILEA,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Call it the luck of the Irish.  Or not.  This jovial fare is definitely about some kind of luck, but whether it's good or bad depends upon which side of the lottery ticket you're standing.  For the title character in ""Waking Ned Devine,"" directed by Kirk Jones, let's just say his was the kind of luck you wouldn't wish on anyone.  But like a vast amount of energy floating around the cosmos looking for a place to land after leaving somewhere else, the luck that runs out for one can become the good fortune of another, at least if it happens to light in the right place and in capable hands.  Which in the case of this story, could be any number of hands, all grasping wildly for that same elusive butterfly, or more precisely, as it turns out, for that fickle fly of fate.  At any rate, the bunch of characters assembled here are the kind Billy Wilder or Frank Capra would've had a field day with, and they are hereby proffered by the filmmakers on hand for your, without a doubt, considerable delight and approval.  And whether you're Irish or not, consider yourself lucky-- because you've just won the ""Laugh Lottery,"" that'll leave more than just your Irish eyes smilin'.In the small (make that VERY small) community of Tulaigh Mohr (Tullymore), someone is holding the winning ticket from the last Lotto game, but of the fifty-eight or so good souls currently residing in this picturesque village by the sea, no one has yet come forth to claim the substantial prize.  And, of course, it's led to speculation by the keenest minds from amongst the population, at the forefront of which is none other than himself, Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen), along with his good friend Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), who are determined to get to the bottom of it all.  The raging question issuing from the Blarney Stone and flowing over into the local pub where it remains adrift like a raft of mystery atop every pint, is why hasn't the lucky sod come forward?Well then, it's up to Jackie and Michael to find out, isn't it?  `Tis.  And so, in the spirit of ""community,"" they set out to find the winner, and the sooner the better; all the quicker to latch onto whomever it is and convince him (or her) that better friends than Jackie and Michael the Maker Himself never put on the good, green earth.  But who could it be?  Maggie (Susan Lynch)?  Pig Finn (James Nesbitt)?  Or even old Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh), who come to think of it hasn't been seen lately.  And when Ned doesn't show up to a get-together at Jackie's house, catered by wife, Annie (Fionnula Flanagan), for the most likely winning-ticket-holding-suspects, Jackie decides to pay old Ned, good Ned, a visit; it just may be that there, at Ned's, Jackie will uncover the secret of this mystery.  Or so he hopes.Kirk Jones has put together and delivered a film that is fun and funny, but more than that, it's a story filled with Puck-like spirit that comes at you with a twinkle in it's eye, a wink and a sidelong glance.  More than anything, though, this is a character study that penetrates to the very heart of the human condition, with all it's flaws, foibles and peccadilloes; but it's permeated with a warmth and generosity of spirit that enables you to fully embrace these rascals, even as they're poking you in the ribs until your sides are sore from laughing.  Overall, it's an assemblage of memorable characters and unforgettable scenes that Jones serves up on a silver platter of good will, harmony and, most importantly, a sense of everlasting hope.In one of his final roles, Ian Bannen absolutely shines as the rascally Jackie, a ""character"" of a character, who underneath it all has a heart as big as they come.  Bannen lends a bit o' the devil to Jackie, but never lets you forget the true nature of the man within, which may not be of an entirely altruistic bent, but neither is there a drop of malice to be found in his veins.  And it's what makes his portrayal so convincing; what we see is a man who is human, not a saint, maybe, but one who definitely won't be turned away from the Pearly Gates when the time comes.  It's a lively performance in which Bannen exhibits a love of life and living, and it makes Jackie O'Shea an honest and very real character.And once you've seen him, you're never going to forget David Kelly as Michael O'Sullivan.  He's a lovable, Capraesque kind of character who is what he is; with Michael, what you see is what you get, and Kelly brings him vibrantly to life.  His ""motorcycle ride"" alone is worth the price of admission for this one, a scene that will be emblazoned in your memory forevermore.  It's a first-rate performance from a terrific character actor, and along with Bannen's, it makes O'Sullivan and O'Shea a real pair to draw to.Adding to the merriment, as well, is the always delightful Fionnula Flanagan as Annie, a woman Irish to the bottom of her soul, a kind of kindred spirit to Maureen O'Hara's Mary Kate Danaher in ""The Quiet Man.""  She gives her Annie spunk, and a nature that complements her Jackie effectively.Also giving noteworthy performances are Susan Lynch, as Maggie, and James Nesbitt as Pig Finn; two more characters you're not likely to forget anytime soon.The supporting cast includes Maura O'Malley (Mrs. Kennedy), Robert Hickey (O'Toole), Paddy Ward (Brendy), Eileen Dromey (Lizzy) and Dermot Kerrigan (Father Patrick).  A refreshing comedy filled with some real insights and genuine humor, ""Waking Ned Devine"" is like a breath of fresh air in a world often choked with L.A. smog.  It's a rare, entertaining treat to be savored and enjoyed again and again.  And that's the magic of the movies.",5,"Warm, Insightful Comedy",1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,5633,"['Call', 'luck', 'Irish', 'not', 'jovial', 'fare', 'definitely', 'kind', 'luck', 'good', 'bad',

The signs are all there, and if you are sharp, you will soon start to catch them. First to make its appearance is the pot of gold, disguised as a winning lottery ticket held by some lucky neighbor in the tiny village of Tulaigh Morh. Next, you will discover that the two old men scheming for a piece of the action, blarney filled Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and his expressive faced scarecrow pal Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), are but thinly disguised mischievous leprechauns. You will meet a hog keeper (James Nesbitt) waiting for the kiss of a fair maid (Susan Lynch) to reveal him for the prince that he is, and an old hag so black hearted and malevolent that all know her as a witch. And when Ned Devine, the neighbor with the winning ticket, dies from the shock of it, his ghost appears to old Jackie in a dream, setting in motion a plan fanciful as any Puss in Boots ever dreamed of that has the whole village working to outwit the vigilance of the lottery board and the malevolence of the witch, to all claim a piece of the fortune at rainbow's end.`Waking Ned Devine' will enchant you and make you laugh. From its opening scene until the last verse of The Parting Glass is sung, it will charm you and leave you with a smile, wanting to watch it again.Theo Logos",5,Charming Fairy Tale,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,1480,"['may', 'not', 'immediately', 'spot', 'leprechauns', 'wizards', 'other', 'tell-tale', 'signs', 'watch', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'will', 'soon', 'realize', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'Irish', 'fairy', 'tale', 'simple', 'pure', 'signs', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'sharp', 'will', 'soon', 'start', 'catch', 'First', 'make', 'appearance', 'pot', 'gold', 'disguised', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'held', 'lucky', 'neighbor', 'tiny', 'village', 'Tulaigh', 'Morh', 'Next', 'will', 'discover', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'scheming', 'piece', 'action', 'blarney', 'filled', 'Jackie', ""O'Shea"", 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'expressive', 'faced', 'scarecrow', 'pal', 'Michael', ""O'Sullivan"", 'David', 'Kelly', 'are', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'mischievous', 'leprechauns', 'will', 'meet', 'hog', 'keeper', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'waiting', 'kiss', 'fair', 'maid', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'reveal', 'prince', 'old', 'hag', 'so', 'black', 'hearted', 'malevolent', 'know', 'witch', 'when', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'neighbor', 'winning', 'ticket', 'shock', 'ghost', 'old', 'Jackie', 'dream', 'setting', 'motion', 'plan', 'fanciful', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'whole', 'village', 'working', 'outwit', 'vigilance', 'lottery', 'board', 'malevolence', 'witch', 'claim', 'piece', 'fortune', 'rainbow', 'end.', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'will', 'enchant', 'make', 'laugh', 'opening', 'scene', 'last', 'verse', 'Parting', 'Glass', 'sung', 'will', 'charm', 'leave', 'smile', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again.Theo', 'Logos']",Waking Ned Devine VHS

503742,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00000ILEA,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[3, 3]","This film is a bit like the Ealing Studio comedies of the 50's. It is character-based film whose jokes depend on situational comedy. The nub of the plot is that the main leads do something a little bit wrong, but not so wrong that they stop being lovable wags. It is set in a village that is on the Isle of Man and in real life is preserved as a tourist attraction. The actors are almost all old comedians and character actors. The movie creates the feel of an Irish village that lives only really in people's imagination. However in dealing with a film such as this one is not concerned with anything else but whether the elements come together as an entertainment.This film does succeed and was a great success when it was released. The plot is centred around a village trying to get the prize that would have gone to one of the villagers if he had not died on the night of the announcement of his win. They have to convince a not to sceptical lotteries inspector that Ned Devine is still alive and well.The cast is impressive although apparently a number of the actors have died. The film is good in that it depends on cast of people in their 70's to propel the story rather than a number of 20 year old models. One of the funniest scenes in the film  in fact involves a nude motor bike ride by one of the older male actors.

The only problem is that Ned is dead; dying from the shock of winning such a fortune. A plan is put into action, that eventually involves the entire town.The humor in this film speaks on many levels from dark comedy (the tragic death of the town witch) to physical sight gags (naked skinny old man on motorcycle). There is a little bit of romance, but nothing that takes away from the film's playful structure. Not only that, there is also a moral to the story, one of family and friendship; no man is an island.
