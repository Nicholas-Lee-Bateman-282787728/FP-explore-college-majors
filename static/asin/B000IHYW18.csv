Chris Freytag is, using her favorite term, awesome! She is a motivating instructor who provides excellent cuing. Whether you are a beginner or advanced in terms of your workout ability, the Prevention workouts are a must.Drop It in 30 is the latest addition to my Prevention collection and I must say that I loved it! The warm-up is four to five minutes in length, followed by two different workouts -- a fat blasting workout and a metabolism energizing workout -- and there is a cooldown at the end. If you are looking for a good 30 minute workout, you can do the warm-up, one of the two workouts and the cooldown. I did the warm-up, both workouts and the cooldown, burning 470 calories in less than an hour. I like that Freytag breaks things up into a few movements and offers easy to follow instructions, then repeats them so that a newbie gets used to the entire routine.Add Drop It in 30 to your collection.

Also, the first time I did the first workout, it was agony to climb stairs for almost a week, because more than half of the workout is squats or lunges or quadricep work of some kind. I couldn't even complete the second workout, I was so out of breath. (I am not out of shape; I tried this workout after a few months of aerobics three or four times a week.) Further, I have to disagree with other reviewers and say that I really loathed Chris Freytag as an instructor. Her cueing was poor and sometimes confusing, and her ""encouragement"" was hollow and irritating. The music was annoying and the visual setup seemed strangely empty and bare. Like I said, though, some of the moves were really fun, especially the lower-impact moves in the second workout, and I certainly built up some leg muscle while I was doing this workout.

She's like Denise Austin only not annoying.  She is encouraging and makes this fun to do.To make it effective and to use variety, there are two workouts here.  Both are fat burning - good old fashioned cardio and then interval cardio.  If you do them together then you'll get about 50 minutes worth of exercise; or you can do them separately (so that's good to know for busy days or when you can't be bothered).  While it's intense, it's easy to follow along to (she's a great cuer).  I've done it a couple of times already and find it enjoyable while still getting my heart rate up and before you know it, it's done and trust me - you'll sweat a lot.  I'd say it's more for intermediate levels, but even I found it good and it's nice to have variation in your routines, so even if you are advanced, you'll benefit from it too - and if you are a beginner, you'll give yourself something to work toward.
