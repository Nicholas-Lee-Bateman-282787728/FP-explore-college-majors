Just like restaurant and hotel reviews, movie reviews are now stacked by the producers. I saw no obvious directing or attempt at directing. It was almost as if there was just the actors and the cameraman. The high point was where the lead actress took off her shirt. Mostly because she stopped talking while her shirt was off. She was nicely endowed but had the allure of a NyQuil commercial in bed. So few FX, so little character development and no action, save about 15 minutes worth if you compiled it from all scenes. No, I can't say I liked any of this. If I could get my money back I would ask for it. But since I have already been robbed of my $3.99 I thought I would save you yours.",1,"Mark, what's that sound?

1614658,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AOCMSLI,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Yes this is one of those forgetful movies that has perhaps one or two moments you might recall after seeing it but for the most part is pretty forgettable. There are many movies like this released each year and its sad to think someone worked hard to get a movie made that falls into this category but it happens. I will say that there was enough creativity on display in this film that maybe down the road those behind it will come up with something better.The story moves back and forth in time but essentially boils down to this. We have a young newlywed couple, Mark and Lesley, happy and in love but with a terrible set of neighbors. The neighbors constantly fight and the guy seems to enjoy beating his wife which causes Mark to step in between the two of them and break up a battle. Never a good thing.The result of Mark's interference is that the neighbor shows up to his house one day and while threatening Lesley accidentally kills her. Mark finds her body and mourns her loss but her father has other plans. He shows with Lesley's brother and along with Mark, they take her to a strange trailer located out in the middle of the desert. Here a fast talking mysterious stranger named Gus who takes the trio and corpse into his home. He warns them that they can't come back ever again and that whatever happens happens. No take backs. That should make people pause but then again this is a movie.Of course he brings Lesley back from the dead but at what costs? When things begin to get a little strange they eventually head back to the desert and confront Gus and have him fix whatever is wrong. Hey wait; didn't he say no take backs?As with most movies where the dead are brought back to life by those who love them they never quite come back the same way. Nothing new here. But there are some nice touches to the film that just never quite makes its way into making it one worth watching. Low budget film making that shows it but as I said, the potential in those involved can be glimpsed but never to the point of making the film entertaining.",2,NOT ONE YOU'LL LIKELY REMEMBER,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,2054,"['Yes', 'one', 'forgetful', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'might', 'recall', 'seeing', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'released', 'year', 'sad', 'think', 'someone', 'worked', 'hard', 'get', 'movie', 'made', 'category', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'enough', 'creativity', 'display', 'film', 'maybe', 'road', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better.The', 'story', 'moves', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'essentially', 'down', 'have', 'young', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'Mark', 'Lesley', 'happy', 'love', 'terrible', 'set', 'neighbors', 'neighbors', 'constantly', 'fight', 'guy', 'enjoy', 'beating', 'wife', 'Mark', 'step', 'two', 'break', 'up', 'battle', 'good', 'thing.The', 'result', 'Mark', 'interference', 'neighbor', 'up', 'house', 'one', 'day', 'threatening', 'Lesley', 'accidentally', 'Mark', 'body', 'loss', 'father', 'other', 'plans', 'Lesley', 'brother', 'Mark', 'take', 'strange', 'trailer', 'located', 'out', 'middle', 'desert', 'Here', 'fast', 'talking', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'named', 'Gus', 'who', 'trio', 'corpse', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'ever', 'again', 'happens', 'take', 'backs', 'should', 'make', 'people', 'pause', 'then', 'again', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'Lesley', 'back', 'dead', 'what', 'costs', 'When', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'little', 'strange', 'eventually', 'head', 'back', 'desert', 'confront', 'Gus', 'have', 'fix', 'wrong', 'Hey', 'wait', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'take', 'backs', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'dead', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'who', 'love', 'never', 'quite', 'come', 'back', 'same', 'way', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'way', 'making', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'Low', 'budget', 'film', 'making', 'said', 'potential', 'involved', 'can', 'be', 'glimpsed', 'never', 'point', 'making', 'film', 'entertaining']",Kiss The Abyss
