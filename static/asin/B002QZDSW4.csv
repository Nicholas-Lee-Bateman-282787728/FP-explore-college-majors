1284441,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B002QZDSW4,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[0, 1]","We get a fighting action sequence-it's about time!-but the truth is they were battling against people so inferior to them that it wasn't much of a fight. How great would it be to find there were more of these pod people like Kyle and Jessie so we can get a real hand to hand?I absolutely LOVE Andy and Josh. They're the best relationship out there. Well, I guess mostly I don't like that Kyle and Amanda, though perfect for each other, are kind of personality-less. (And why is it he can tell everyone else his secret but not Amanda who would accept anything with him?) And Declan is way too good for Lori (though I wish he'd actually explained why he broke up with her beyond ""I'm Kyle's secret keeper""). So Andy and Josh are perfect, both with personalities and super cute together.Then there's Lori's new love interest. I don't want to ruin anything here, so all I have to say is: great job writers. Perhaps one of the best bits of writing they've done yet. And everything that I know about him (getting into Season 3 Episode 2) is intriguing to say the least.I'm bothered by the whole Hilary-Lori friendship. They basically ignore the fact that Hilary iced Lori at school-which is not fighting it's brutal bullying. And Lori just forgave her. Something like that shouldn't go unaddressed as it sends the message that it's not such a big deal to do that to someone.I like that the show is once again delving into the secrets of Kyle (and Jessie). Quire frankly, Jessie is the far more interesting of the two, with personality quirks, issues, and perhaps a bit of craziness.It's unfortunate that Kyle is super oblivious to her to the point where he is kind of negligent of her. (Yes, she's overly obsessed with him and does stupid things, but he had someone to guide him in everything that she didn't and she's clearly in need of his help but he never notices.) And what was that comment the psychic made about her? I am so not interested in Kyle and Jessie becoming a super couple or anything like that though.

1284445,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002QZDSW4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 2]","What a difference a year makes!""Kyle XY"" has been the flagship series for abc family as it was the top rated series for the cable channel from 2006-2008.  After raving about season two of abc Family's sci-fi teen drama series ""Kyle XY"" and how I enjoyed the series immensely, the highly anticipated third season was canceled and to make things worse, there was no appropriate ending to the series as it ended with a cliffhanger.  The final episode was meant to be a season finale not a series finale.Needless to say, fans were upset that the networks didn't give the executive producers/writers an opportunity to give the series some closure.  With fans hoping an online petition would bring it back online, unfortunately the series has been canceled and for fans, all that they can hope for is some closure with the DVD release of the third and final season.  Fortunately, the executive producers do give closure through ""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" DVD release.""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" features the final ten episodes on three DVD's.VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. There are a lot of outdoor and indoor shots in this series, so the series definitely benefits from the outdoor shots.  Picture quality on DVD is satisfactory compared to other television series on DVD with some compression and also a fine layer of grain can be seen on video.  But for the most part, PQ for this television series is good.Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-driven and audio is mainly coming from the center and front channel speakers.  Dialogue is clear and understandable as with the music for the film.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" comes with the following special features:Disc 2:* Audio commentary for ""Episode 38 - Life Support"" - Optional audio commentary by executive producers David Himelfarb and Eric Tuchman.Disc 3:* Kyle XY: Future Revealed - (12:34) For those who wanted to know how ""Kyle XY"" should have ended, this is the special feature to watch.  Executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb and co-executive producer Julie Flec talk about how ""Kyle XY"" was supposed to end if given a fourth season.* Deleted Scenes - Featuring twelve deleted scenes with optional commentary by Executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb.* Audio commentary for ""Episode 43 - Bringing Down the House"" - Optional audio commentary by executive producer David Himelfarb and co-executive producer Julie Flec.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that after the series finale, I was shocked about how the final season ended.  What was up with the cliffhanger?  Why didn't the writers end the series.  And this DVD release explains that the third season was done and was setup for a fourth season but it didn't happen that way, ABC canceled the series.So, it does makes sense why the series ended with a cliffhanger and after hearing how the executive producers wanted to end the series, how disappointing that this series could not have been continued.  I was at least hoping the series would be picked up by another cable network and somehow the series would continue to go on.  After all, for three years, this series was the top rated show for abc family.So, in a way, this final season is kind of bittersweet because it doesn't give you the feeling of closure.  But at least, the executive producers were able to give us a glimpse of what they wanted through the special feature and also with the audio commentary for the final episode.I really enjoyed ""Kyle XY"" and its rather unfortunate that such a wonderful series had to end with a cancellation and also unfortunate that the network couldn't give them additional episodes to wrap the series up.  May it be through two hour movie or an additional 3-4 episodes, those millions of viewers who enjoyed the series should have been treated with some closure.As for the DVD release, the second season was a fantastic release with many special features with the cast, many audio commentary tracks but surprisingly, the third and final season only had audio commentary for two episodes and the deleted scenes.  So, I was a little surprised how this final DVD release had less content.Nevertheless, I'm grateful to executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb and co-executive Julie Flec for being so honest with their fans through this DVD release and explaining of what they wanted for the future of ""Kyle XY"" and also talking about the series cancellation.So, if you are a big fan of ""Kyle XY"" and own the previous two seasons, this is the final season to complete your collection and possibly the way to gain closure for those who enjoyed the series.",4,"For the fans who want to know how the

It seems to me that any actually interesting and thought provoking material on television is quickly and firmly removed from the air. I don't know if the responsible parties are actually mentally defective, or if they just don't like it because the viewing audience does. Maybe this is why I haven't owned a television for so long. I just don't see the sense in paying someone to watch commercials just barely glued together with pablum. Aren't you glad I'm not opinionated?  :-)))))High-end science fiction, well plotted and edited. We watch a young man, totally ignorant of the mores, morals and culture suddenly surrounding him. He is strong enough - sane enough to withstand the barrage of new and strange sensations, interactions, and other stimuli that would probably destroy most of us. His interactions with the outside world and the people who inhabit it have strong elements of the surreal, while his ability to adapt gives thought to our own reactions to the new and different. Thought provoking, enticing, this is well written and enjoyable. Provides exposure to a constant string of philosophical concepts, events and dilemmas while not being preachy or confusing. Rather, this is always interesting and enjoyable to watch, even if it does make you actually think a bit. I think this is great material. I tend to get all paranoid when trying to figure out why the powers that be continually remove material such as this from our purview. Are we mindless idiots to be fed mindless media to keep us ""in our place"". I don't know, but the removal of programming such as this truly makes me wonder...

1284462,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002QZDSW4,Robert Moore,"[115, 126]","TV fans frequently castigate FOX for the long string of premature cancellations of potentially (or actually) great shows over the past fifteen years. They have built up a great deal of ill will with fans, with many people refusing to give FOX series tries because of a lack of confidence that they will stick with the shows. The damage done to FOX by their quick trigger finger is difficult to calculate. Until recently, I was loathe to watch any show on the network, so intense was my anger at them. Thankfully, things seem to have changed somewhat. New FOX head of programming Kevin Reilly -- who built a reputation at NBC for his patience with critically acclaimed shows with weak ratings, shows like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, 30 ROCK, and THE OFFICE -- seems to have brought a similar patience with him. While shows like the marvelous TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have been cancelled, he can't be accused of any silly cancellations that we saw with he predecessors.But just as things have been improving at FOX, so things have been worsening at ABC. In fact, ABC seems to be determined to become the new FOX. The most shocking cancellation was unquestionably PUSHING DAISIES, which was not only one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, but led all shows for most nominations at the 2008 Emmys. They cancelled at the same time the delightful ELI STONE and later managed to cancel a substantial portion of its entire schedule. Now ABC Family has joined the party, cancelling network mainstay KYLE XY.KYLE XY was not one of the best shows on TV. The writing was not as sharp as it could have been and the overall story arc seemed to drift at times. Nonetheless, KYLE XY was for three years a series I watched with ongoing interest and enjoyment. I loved the Trager family and was increasingly enjoying the surprising love triangle between Kyle, Amanda, and Jesse. I've also had an ongoing interest in shows featuring technologically altered people, such as Max in DARK ANGEL (a character Kyle resembles in some ways) or Jake in JAKE 2.0 or River Tam in FIREFLY.I didn't care for Jesse much in Season 2, but I not only came to like her character in the current season, but actually enjoyed the complexity of the surprising love triangle that resulted as Kyle came to recognize her romantically. I have no idea how that would have ended, but it would have been delightful to find out. Another romance on the show seemed more likely to remain ended, as Joss's girlfriend Andy moved with her mothers to Cleveland. Magda Apanowicz, who played Andy, got a role on the BSG prequel CAPRICA, a much higher profile series. But the whole question of Amanda versus Jesse was left completely in the air.I think all the television networks should commit themselves to a pact with their audiences. Over the years dozens and dozens of shows have been cancelled in midstory. When most shows were episodic rather than serial in format, this didn't matter. But virtually all shows worth watching -- and all of the shows I watch, without exception -- are serials. They tell an ongoing story. PUSHING DAISIES will end (as of this date the final three episodes have not been broadcast) with a host of story arcs dangling. The same is true of ELI STONE and KYLE XY. I think television would improve, ratings would improve, and attitudes towards networks would improve if all the networks would vow to allow all television series to have a proper conclusion. This could be done either by allowing a series an extra 2 or 3 episodes to wrap up the story or a mini-series or made for TV movie (or even a direct-to-TV movie) to do the same. As it is, I have immense anger towards FOX (though that has been dissipating somewhat the past couple of years) and a growing anger at ABC and ABC Family for scores of irritating cancellations. Let the series finish what they started!!!! In addition to all the other advantages, it would increase DVD sales. One of the reasons why WONDERFALLS is so satisfying on DVD is that while it was cancelled by FOX after four episodes, 13 were filmed and appear on DVD, the final episode providing a very satisfying ending to the short series. Right now when networks cancel a series, they just leave things in a mess.But I also think that executive producers need to stop ending each season with a big cliffhanger. If you know a show is safe and that it has been renewed, a cliffhanger is not irresponsible. But I think it is stupid to write a cliffhanger for a show that is on the fence or in signficant danger of cancellation. I loved VERONICA MARS, but Rob Thomas knew the show was at risk of ending. He should have ended the show with something that could have served as a series ender in case it was cancelled. There is an important precedent for what I am suggesting. Even though BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was able to end on its own terms, Joss Whedon felt that there was always a possibility of cancellation. So each season of BUFFY (and most seasons of ANGEL) end in a way so that it could have stood as a series finale.Still, when networks cancel shows after work on the current season has ended, then they ought to allow some sort of ending. This is certainly the case with KYLE XY. There was simply no opportunity for the writers to provide anything like a series ending. At the very least ABC Family should have ordered three more episodes with the understanding that they would be the last.I hope that whoever does the hiring and firing replaces the programming people at ABC and ABC Family. It isn't just that the networks have a string of bad shows; they are cancelling the best shows simply because the ratings are weak. If you have a critically acclaimed show, you always have the potential to build an audience. But if you replace it with crap, you have neither critical acclaim nor potential. As things stand, once LOST is finished, I may be finished with ABC as well, with the lone caveat that I'm anxious to see what they do with the pilot that they are developing for FABLES, based on the extraordinary comics by Bill Willingham. But apart from that, ABC has become the network from which I have the least expectations.",5,Yet another reprehensible cancellation by our friends at ABC,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,6160,"['TV',

1284465,A1CVFUQ1PGSIJL,B002QZDSW4,"T. Adlam ""professional consumer""","[113, 113]","I discovered Kyle XY via Hulu recommendation and from the pilot episode, I was hooked. Kyle XY is a love first, sci-fi second series. And by love, I mean all facets of it from familial and neighborly love to romantic love. It delivered well-balanced messages of respect and caring without being preachy. The sci-fi element that was woven into the story added a touch of excitement and kept the viewer on edge. It reminded me of Dawson's Creek meets Seventh Heaven meets Smallville. It wasn't perfect, but I soaked in every episode and after the shocking season three conclusion, I needed to know what happened.Although I'd already seen all the episodes in the third season, I got the DVDs because I read in a producer's interview that there would be a special bonus feature wrapping up the show's loose ends. One hour long show meant to wrap up everything wouldn't be what I'd hoped for, but it would be better than nothing. Right? Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.The season three DVD set includes 3 discs with each episode from the final season. The third disc also has some bonus features. One of the features is ""Kyle XY: Future Revealed."" As I anxiously awaited the final world-altering episode, my hopes were dashed when it turned out to be a fifteen minute interview with the producers explaining how the story's various threads would have been tied up had the show continued for another season. In fact, all the information they shared was already provided through various written and video interviews posted online and broadcast on TV. Basically, we're told what would have happened, with a few episodic clips thrown in for good measure, but it's still rather unsatisfying.Also on the DVD are some deleted scenes spanning a few seconds to a couple of minutes each and don't get fooled by the ""Sneak Peeks""--they are previews for upcoming programs and not sneak peeks for any future episodes of Kyle XY.It would be lovely if the writers and producers could collaborate on a book which wraps up the Kyle XY storyline or even a full-length made for TV conclusion to the series, but I'm not holding my breath. To sum up, if you're looking for closure to the Kyle XY series, you probably won't get it on these DVDs.",4,No Satisfying Closure...,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,2222,"['discovered', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Hulu', 'recommendation', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'love', 'first', 'sci-fi', 'second', 'series', 'love', 'mean', 'facets', 'familial', 'neighborly', 'love', 'romantic', 'love', 'delivered', 'well-balanced', 'messages', 'respect', 'caring', 'being', 'preachy', 'sci-fi', 'element', 'was', 'woven', 'story', 'added', 'touch', 'excitement', 'kept', 'viewer', 'edge', 'reminded', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'meets', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'Smallville', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'soaked', 'episode', 'shocking', 'season', 'three', 'conclusion', 'needed', 'know', 'what', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'got', 'DVDs', 'read', 'producer', 'interview', 'would', 'be', 'special', 'bonus', 'feature', 'wrapping', 'up', 'show', 'loose', 'ends', 'One', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'meant', 'wrap', 'up', 'everything', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'nothing', 'Right', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'case.The', 'season', 'three', 'DVD', 'set', '3', 'discs', 'episode', 'final', 'season', 'third', 'disc', 'also', 'bonus', 'features', 'One', 'features', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Future', 'Revealed', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'final', 'world-altering', 'episode', 'hopes', 'were', 'dashed', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'interview', 'producers', 'explaining', 'how', 'story', 'various', 'threads', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'up', 'had', 'show', 'continued', 'season', 'fact', 'information', 'shared', 'was', 'already', 'provided', 'various', 'written', 'video', 'interviews', 'posted', 'online', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'told', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'few', 'episodic', 'clips', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'still', 'rather', 'unsatisfying.Also', 'DVD', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'spanning', 'few', 'seconds', 'couple', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fooled', 'Sneak', 'Peeks', 'are', 'previews', 'upcoming', 'programs', 'not', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'future', 'episodes', 'Kyle', 'XY.It', 'would', 'be', 'lovely', 'writers', 'producers', 'could', 'collaborate', 'book', 'up', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'storyline', 'even', 'full-length', 'made', 'TV', 'conclusion', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'sum', 'up', ""'re"", 'looking', 'closure', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'series', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVDs']",Kyle XY: The Complete Third and Final Season

1284468,AP3B615GM191G,B002QZDSW4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","This third (and ultimately final) season of Kyle XY is almost a contradiction in terms.  On one hand, clearly a show of this caliber needed a more definitive ending than a cliffhanger that never gets resolved.  On the other hand, though, it is clear that this season ""jumped the shark"" by focusing on the same relationship themes each and every episode.The overall plotline of this final season is actually very interesting.  Much more information is revealed about Latnok, while Kyle and Jessi struggle to incorporate that knowledge and make their own decisions about the organization that created them.All the other predictable aspects of Kyle XY are apparent as well: The Josh/Andi relationship is cute and touching, Lori and Decklin are still annoying as all get-up, and the Traeger parents still waffle between being overprotective and fair.  In essence, the basic elements of the show remain unchanged.Here is the big problem: Ever single 10 episodes in this season take on the exact same basic format...Jessi does something stupid...Kyle yells at her...Kyle eventually helps her and they make up in a romantic moment...Amanda walks in on said romantic moment...Amanda gets mad and does something dumb...Kyle saves her (but needs Jessi's help to do so)...Amanda makes up with Kyle...Kyle is still confused.  Rinse, lather, repeat.Whereas earlier seasons focused on comedy or adventures, this go-round is quite heavy on sappy drama, which gets old and boring after roughly two episodes.Overall, Kyle XY is a great little niche show that deserves a better ending than this abbreviated code and cancellation.  That being said, considering the broken-record emotional themes of this season, perhaps the show ended before it truly became painful to watch.  I just wish that Kyle's remarkable backstory would have given us more closure instead of just leave us hanging.I recommend watching the ""Kyle XY: Future Revealed"" interviews either on this DVD or found on YouTube.  Though a sorry substitute for true closure, at least we can discover where the show WOULD have been headed had it been allowed to play out.",3,Jumped The Shark...And Jumped The Airwaves,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2112,"['third', 'ultimately', 'final', 'season', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'almost', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'one', 'hand', 'clearly', 'show', 'caliber', 'needed', 'more', 'definitive', 'ending', 'cliffhanger', 'never', 'resolved', 'other', 'hand', 'clear', 'season', 'jumped', 'shark', 'focusing', 'same', 'relationship', 'themes', 'episode.The', 'overall', 'plotline', 'final', 'season', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'Much', 'more', 'information', 'revealed', 'Latnok', 'Kyle', 'Jessi', 'struggle', 'incorporate', 'knowledge', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'organization', 'created', 'other', 'predictable', 'aspects', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'are', 'apparent', 'well', 'Josh/Andi', 'relationship', 'cute', 'touching', 'Lori', 'Decklin', 'are', 'still', 'annoying', 'get-up', 'Traeger', 'parents', 'still', 'waffle', 'being', 'overprotective', 'fair', 'essence', 'basic', 'elements', 'show', 'remain', 'unchanged.Here', 'big', 'problem', 'Ever', 'single', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'take', 'exact', 'same', 'basic', 'format', 'Jessi', 'something', 'stupid', 'Kyle', 'yells', 'Kyle', 'eventually', 'make', 'up', 'romantic', 'moment', 'Amanda', 'walks', 'said', 'romantic', 'moment', 'Amanda', 'mad', 'something', 'dumb', 'Kyle', 'Jessi', 'help', 'do', 'so', 'Amanda', 'up', 'Kyle', 'Kyle', 'still', 'confused', 'Rinse', 'lather', 'repeat.Whereas', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'focused', 'comedy', 'adventures', 'go-round', 'quite', 'heavy', 'sappy', 'drama', 'old', 'boring', 'roughly', 'two', 'episodes.Overall', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'great', 'little', 'niche', 'show', 'better', 'ending', 'abbreviated', 'code', 'cancellation', 'being', 'said', 'considering', 'broken-record', 'emotional', 'themes', 'season', 'perhaps', 'show', 'ended', 'truly', 'became', 'painful', 'watch', 'just', 'wish', 'Kyle', 'remarkable', 'backstory', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'closure', 'instead', 'just', 'leave', 'hanging.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Future', 'Revealed', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'found', 'YouTube', 'sorry', 'substitute', 'true', 'closure', 'least', 'can', 'discover', 'where', 'show', 'WOULD', 'have', 'been', 'headed', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'play', 'out']",Kyle XY: The Complete Third and Final Season
