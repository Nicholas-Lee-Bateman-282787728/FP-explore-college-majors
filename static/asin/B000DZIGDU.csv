963791,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000DZIGDU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[9, 9]","""Jarhead"" is a marine expression that describes a recruit as an open vessel waiting to be filled by the commanders that be and by the haircut that makes the marine look like one.  The movie is a recollection of the first Persian Gulf War, told from the point of view of Private Anthony Swofford (who wrote the book, but is played by Jake Gyllenhall) and his trek from marine recruit until the end of Operation Desert Storm.  The war only lasted six weeks, and his contributions only four days, but the process he undergoes is absorbing.  ""Swoff"" undergoes initiation and later reluctance until he meets his command leader Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Fox) who gets him ready.  His biggest challenge is keeping a fellow marine in check (Fowler, an ex-con) who seems unstable at best and incorrigible at worst.The movie isn't as intense as the most acclaimed war movies, but it isn't less insightful.  We are given a palpable reality.  The scenes show the urgency of missing women, the boredom and agony of anticipation, and the wild comraderie in all its details.  The best scenes are when the narrative focuses on Swoff separate from his brigade and he shares his inner angst.  The dream sequence tells more than any scene and has a surreal stream-of-consciousness effect.  We also get a first-person feel to when they have to play football in the grueling 112 degree heat.  Other revelations are done well, too.  For instance, their frenzy is present when watching ""Apocolyse Now"".  There's an interview scene where Swoff and others show their reluctance to follow the military's command to keep silence about the downside of being a recruit.  (They're just brimming to tell it like it is.) Later, Swoff gets into big trouble during a holiday party where he shares contraband liquor.  The war itself, for all its brevity, in the movie and in real life, just tells the unvarnished truth.  It shows the war, like any war, in all its mundane horror.  Swoff leaves us with some concrete thoughts about how his experience changed him forever.""Jar Head"" is a good movie experience.  It feels genuine.  The performances are fine, too.  Gyllenhall makes the experience authentic, and the supporting cast is believable throughout.  Jamie Fox, in particular, shows an acting range here that makes us appreciate his other contributions.  (His Oscar for ""Ray"" seems all the more deserving after seeing this film.)  The music and other atmospherics help to create a solid movie--even if it doesn't brim with suspense.  Overall, it doesn't try to sensationalize anything.

The presentation of USMC boot camp appeared realistic, albeit sadistic. To be prepared for person-to-person combat, the soldier/marine/sailor/airman must be broken down somewhat from the materialistic American culture and reborn as a colder, buddy-oriented killing machine--one which follows orders, though. The author's presentation of training, idleness, desert training, more boredom, loss of significant others back home, the frustration of war itself, and the bizarre juxtaposition of desert warfare with returning to the placidity of home are all excellent. The movie grabbed part of me. But I was a USAF forecaster in West Germany. My Marine friends, and I have several good ones, tell me this movie does not represent the Corps well. I do not know. I was not at Quantico, Camp Pendleton, or other USMC bases. I was at Lackland AFB for most of my training. A boys' camp was Lackland AFB. I am a little disappointed that more of the movie did not deal directly with the male bonding that is necessary and good in the military. The gay issue was side-stepped, and I think that was unfortunate. Many USMC personnel are gay and should be proud to be both, Marine and gay.

963797,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000DZIGDU,Andrew Desmond,"[3, 6]","I remember reading a number of years ago in George Orwell's ""Homage to Catalonia"" that war was a period of intense boredom interspersed with brief intervals of absolute terror.  Such a view would apply to the movie, ""Jarhead"".Here, we see the military life of Anthony Swofford unfold.  As a somewhat reluctant recruit to the US marines, Swofford (as played by Jake Gyllenhall) manages to be selected as a specialist sniper.  The training period is harsh but does succeed in spitting out trained soldiers at the end.  If these men have one common feature it is that they all wish to go to war.  And George Bush Senior obliges by declaring war on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.  The troops can hardly wait.  But wait they must.After landing in Saudi Arabia as a stepping stone to Kuwait, further training continues.  Hopes of war are high amongst the young man.  However, they are destined to train and wait, train and wait.  They are itching to see action but always seem to play a secondary role to the modern war machine that relies upon precision bombs and aerial attack.  The infantry sees little action.  In fact, none of the men in Swofford's platoon gets to fire a shot in anger.""Jarhead"" is not a typical war movie.  There is no direct clash between good guys and bad guys.  The viewer is given a far more ambiguous view of war where politics plays a greater role.  As a result, this film differs from the usual Hollywood fare where good triumphs over evil and no questions are left unanswered.  It is this apparent ambiguity that gives ""Jarhead"" real credibility.  It would have been so easy to fall back upon a formulaic production.I can strongly recommend this film.  The story is one that needs to be told.  The acting is first rate and the scenes of destruction in the wake of Saddam's burning of the Kuwaiti oilfields are absolutely mesmerising.

963798,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000DZIGDU,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I am not a huge fan of war movies in general.  I find them all too often rather boring and redundant.  I know that they have a huge fanbase but I just never found myself in that select group.  I have enjoyed a few to an extent, but in general, if it's going to be a war movie, I much prefer the kind that involves bows and arrows and spears and armor, not guns and tanks.  I think that it is my predisposition to war films that actually made `Jarhead' stand out to me as so well done.  It is far from your typical war movie, mostly because the war is not a major character in the film.  It is more a haunting enigma that hangs over the heads of every character in the film, a hushed secret that keeps eluding them the more they desperately reach out for it.Anthony Swoffard is reaching pretty high.`Jarhead' is based off of the memoir written by Swoffard.  I have not read the book, although I hear that it is fantastic.  It chronicles (as does the movie) the action, or lack there of, that takes place while these young men train to kill.  What I loved so much about this film is that it really captures that desperation, that longing for purpose that these young men go through while separated from all they know and love.Not too long ago I was on a cruise with the wife and we were talking with the other couples at our dinner table (whom we had never met before), one of which was on leave to get married and was going to be returning to active duty overseas.  During our conversation he commented that a lot of the soldiers he knew, young soldiers, were there for the `thrill'.  We collectively (at least the men at the table) agreed that a big draw for young ones to join the army is to get to try in real life what they spend hours doing in videogames.  Even the `Army Now' campaigns on television focus on the action, the fighting, the `thrill'.`Jarhead' exposes the reality behind that `thrill'.Thanks to some very competent performances, `Jarhead' becomes impeccable.  I have raved and then bashed Gyllenhaal in my reviews and in conversations.  He has talent, he just doesn't always capitalize on it.  This same year he did `Proof' and `Brokeback Mountain'.  In my initial review for `Brokeback Mountain' I raved Gyllenhaal, but after subsequent viewings I realized how `out of place' he seemed at times.  In `Proof' (which I have yet to review) he is just forgettable.  In `Jarhead' he is marvelous.  There is a quality to his eyes that portray an almost confused curiosity, as if he wants to know more but is afraid of what he'll learn.  He conveys that so well here.  Jamie Foxx also steps up his game by sinking into what could have been a generic and clich&eacute;d character and giving him a little extra life.  The slew of supporting actors, not the least of which is Lucas Black, really bode well with the film and its purpose and deliver exceedingly well.But, if you have read the four reviews that preceded this one you will know that this review was inspired by one man and one man alone; Peter Sarsgaard.This is my favorite performance by Peter and truthfully one of the best supporting performances of this past decade.  He has such power and control and dynamic character development.  What is so wonderful about this performance is that he truly plays `supporting' very well.  Throughout the first two thirds of the film he almost disappears behind the man that is Gyllenhaal, allowing the film to really root in Swofford's character.  He makes a statement, sure, and he becomes that secondary character you want to learn more about, but he never crosses that line with showy actorly acrobatics.  And then the sniper scene comes and this man crumbles and I was literally BLOWN away (seriously, best single sequence of acting in the year that was 2005).  Everything that he has been gradually building up to just unloads in a single breathtaking scene.  This mans entire existence shatters and leaves us with a devastating climax.Sam Mendes is a director who I really have a lot of respect for.  He has gotten a bad rap for winning the Oscar so soon (first film, `American Beauty') but his following films have proven his talent.  While `Road to Perdition', `Jarhead' and `Revolutionary Road' all have there drawbacks (`Jarhead' doesn't really have one for me, but I understand why others find it less than rewarding, especially if they were expecting a generic `war' movie) they also exude a distinct knowledge of subject by Mendes.  He understands how to create something that titillates the senses (`Perdition's' rain soaked sets, `Jarhead's' sun cloaked bodies, `RR's' rooms bathed in white)  but also delivers a profound blow.  I think that for a young director he has built for himself quite the resume (I still have not seen `Away We Go', but as per usual with Mendes, it has its raving and its scathing reviews).If you are looking for something that is less typical and more thought provoking; less generic and predictable and more emotionally investing then I highly recommend you seek out `Jarhead' immediately.  If you are looking for your average `blow `em up' type war film then stay far, far away.",5,"Not your typical war movie; far, far better...",1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,5136,"['am', 'not', 'huge',

All wars are different, but there's an old saying: each army is fully prepared to fight the previous war.  Whether the French in World War II or old Vietnam cadres commenting in the face of either Gulf War.  Broyles seems to assume the worst of soldiers and command and totally misses the generation differences between the Boomers and Gen-Xers--yet has previous made sweeping universal conclusions on military conduct and presents them as ""compassionate"" fact.Listening to the Vietnam-in-Iraq wishy-washy commentary in this movie only serves to make one wonder how it affected the screenplay and thus the structure of the movie.A flawed movie, which could have easily been another Apocalypse Now or Platoon in better hands.

Something about these two actors just seemed to click in the movie and the plotting. They acted their roles with brilliance and were as convincing as if they had actually lived the lives of the marines in this story.The story itself follows one marine through his training all the way up to the last hours of Desert Storm. During this time, we see a soldier's life during Desert Shield, before the war with Irag began, and just how difficult life was, and how boring as well. It is so boring, in fact, that the soldiers want nothing more than to put at least one kill underneath their belts. Yet Jake Gyllenhaal and his comrades are sniper scouts, marines who see little action as it is, and getting those kills is going to be difficult. What follows is actually a slow decent into insanity for some of the soldiers, or constant paranoia about life at home, and what they may be missing. When all put together, it's actually more of a character study than anything else, since Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes through all of these emotions.What I liked most about this movie was the simple fact that it's a true story, as well as it's based during the Gulf War. We get to see little of this relatively pointless war, and when a movie is made about it, I'm generally excited to see it. And thanks to some well-acted characters as well as the true-story backing, it adds some concrete to what had looked to be an unstable mix. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Three Kings (the only other Gulf War movie I know of).

It's not a pretty sight, and one would think, based on the psychological instability prevalent within Swoff's platoon, that these soldiers had spent four years fighting on the Eastern front instead of four days in the Middle East during Desert Storm. That these fellows underwent the type of ungluing they did, based on such a short period in action, is incredibly unlikely, and, to do so in such a uniform fashion, defies belief. When contemplating the madness of these characters, the fact that they all graduated from high school, let alone avoided placement in a special education program for the emotionally disturbed, is astonishing. Overall, I completely doubted the veracity of this story.The attempt to portray the entire company as a group of blood-thirsty zealots, who whoop and holler as a village gets destroyed in Apocalypse Now, was actually quite offensive. I really think that these negative stereotypes are put forth as a means to defile the USMC, who stand guard over our safety regardless of the way in which Hollywood demeans them. A good bit of propaganda is also included in the allusion to the fact that everything done in Iraq was due to our lust for oil. This is patently ridiculous. Our government is the richest entity on this earth and they're not concerned about how much their citizens pay for gasoline.

963807,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000DZIGDU,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[5, 6]","Jarhead is a movie based on the book of the same name, written by Anthony Swofford. Swofford was a sniper in the Gulf War conflict and he wrote his book as a collection of memoirs, describing the day to day occurrences while fighting in this short war.This movie is based on Swofford's true story and it lets the viewer see what it was like to be a marine in the Gulf War, from the perspective of one man and his recounting of the events. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie and he offers his thoughts by narrating the movie at different points, allowing the viewer to better understand the thoughts that pass through a man's head when death and destruction are just around the corner.One thing about Jarhead that makes it different from other war movies is the lack of much combat action. There are only a few shooting and fighting scenes and they are not very graphic at all. This could be a letdown for those who watch this movie hoping to see violence, blood, and gore. There isn't much of this, and the movie often drags along at a slower than usual pace for this type of movie.If this movie isn't about combat, then what exactly is it about? Well, it is basically a film about the utter boredom of war- the majority of the hours of each day when there is nothing going on and nothing to do. The viewer gets to observe the men as they look for ways to fill the time in each day. They talk about sex. They talk about politics. They talk about sex. They talk about their girlfriends or wives back home. And they talk about sex some more. Stuck in a combat zone with other men, the guys have to find some way to fill the hours of the day and this movie concentrates its efforts on this aspect of war: What goes on when there is no armed conflict taking place and the soldiers have to find ways to occupy their time.Parts of this movie move very slowly but these slow moments are sometimes interrupted with military action when the enemy draws near. These action scenes, however, don't come even close to the brutal, high- powered action scenes of other war movies. Director Sam Mendes wanted to keep the emphasis of Jarhead on the boredom, since this is what filled the bulk of the day for the men fighting in the Gulf War.Performances in this movie are generally very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Saarsgard leading the way. There is lots of abrasive language in this movie, and much of it is supplied by Jamie Foxx as he attempts to train and lead his troops. The rough language is the main reason this movie earned its ""R"" rating since the violent scenes are few.Jarhead has a large cast of characters, but you don't really get to know them on a personal level. The only person you really get to know is Anthony Swofford himself. You get to experience his feelings and thoughts through his own narration and through his own actions. But you don't get to know much at all about the other characters and this fact is one of Jarhead's strengths and weaknesses. It is a strength because it keeps the focus of the film on its core premise (the boredom of war and how soldiers deal with it) rather than on the personal lives of the characters themselves. But at the same time, this could be perceived by some viewers as a weakness because many of the characters seem very empty and underdeveloped. I didn't like this aspect of the film at first, but I accepted it more as the film dragged on.Because of the slowness of this movie and its scattered theme, it seems at times like a movie lacking direction. When I viewed it for the first time, I kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't understand why Mendes didn't insert more action into some of the scenes. Like with the unknown characters, this is how Mendes intended Jarhead to be. No one person comes across as a hero; no vivid scenes of combat are shown; and no important political messages are shared. This is war at its dullest, but according to Swofford's book and the accounts of others who served in the Gulf War, this is pretty much the way it was.More than a movie about combat, Jarhead is a war movie about a man and his day to day experiences. This isn't a great war movie and I can think of many other war films that rank higher on my all time list. But it does offer an interesting perspective, showing how the endless hours with nothing to do can drive a soldier just as crazy as the time spent fighting the enemy.",3,Boredom During War: A Fate Worse than Death,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,4419,"['Jarhead', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'Swofford', 'was', 'sniper', 'Gulf', 'War', 'conflict', 'wrote', 'book', 'collection', 'memoirs', 'describing', 'day', 'day', 'occurrences', 'fighting', 'short', 'war.This', 'movie', 'based', 'Swofford', 'true', 'story', 'viewer', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'marine', 'Gulf', 'War', 'perspective', 'one', 'man', 'recounting', 'events', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Swofford', 'movie', 'thoughts', 'narrating', 'movie', 'different', 'points', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'better', 'understand', 'thoughts', 'pass', 'man', 'head', 'when', 'death', 'destruction', 'are', 'just', 'corner.One', 'thing', 'Jarhead', 'different', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'lack', 'much', 'combat', 'action', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'shooting', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'graphic', 'could', 'be', 'letdown', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'hoping', 'see', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'often', 'along', 'slower', 'usual', 'pace', 'type', 'movie.If', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'combat', 'then', 'what', 'exactly', 'Well', 'basically', 'film', 'utter', 'boredom', 'war-', 'majority', 'hours', 'day', 'when', 'nothing', 'going', 'nothing', 'do', 'viewer', 'observe', 'men', 'look', 'ways', 'fill', 'time', 'day', 'talk', 'sex', 'talk', 'politics', 'talk', 'sex', 'talk', 'girlfriends', 'wives', 'back', 'home', 'talk', 'sex', 'more', 'Stuck', 'combat', 'zone', 'other', 'men', 'guys', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'fill', 'hours', 'day', 'movie', 'efforts', 'aspect', 'war', 'What', 'when', 'armed', 'conflict', 'taking', 'place', 'soldiers', 'have', 'find', 'ways', 'occupy', 'time.Parts', 'movie', 'move', 'very', 'slowly', 'slow', 'moments', 'are', 'sometimes', 'interrupted', 'military', 'action', 'when', 'enemy', 'draws', 'action', 'scenes', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'even', 'close', 'brutal', 'high-', 'powered', 'action', 'scenes', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'wanted', 'keep', 'emphasis', 'Jarhead', 'boredom', 'filled', 'bulk', 'day', 'men', 'fighting', 'Gulf', 'War.Performances', 'movie', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Peter', 'Saarsgard', 'leading', 'way', 'lots', 'abrasive', 'language', 'movie', 'much', 'supplied', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'train', 'lead', 'troops', 'rough', 'language', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'earned', 'R', 'rating', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'few.Jarhead', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'personal', 'level', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'get', 'experience', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'own', 'narration', 'own', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'much', 'other', 'characters', 'fact', 'one', 'Jarhead', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'strength', 'focus', 'film', 'core', 'premise', 'boredom', 'war', 'how', 'soldiers', 'deal', 'rather', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'perceived', 'viewers', 'weakness', 'many', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'empty', 'underdeveloped', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'aspect', 'film', 'first', 'accepted', 'more', 'film', 'dragged', 'on.Because', 'slowness', 'movie', 'scattered', 'theme', 'times', 'movie', 'lacking', 'direction', 'When', 'viewed', 'first', 'time', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Mendes', 'did', ""n't"", 'insert', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'unknown', 'characters', 'how', 'Mendes', 'intended', 'Jarhead', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'across', 'hero', 'vivid', 'scenes', 'combat', 'are', 'shown', 'important', 'political', 'messages', 'are', 'shared', 'war', 'dullest', 'according', 'Swofford', 'book', 'accounts', 'others', 'who', 'served', 'Gulf', 'War', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'was.More', 'movie', 'combat', 'Jarhead', 'war', 'movie', 'man', 'day', 'day', 'experiences', ""n't"", 'great', 'war', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'many', 'other', 'war', 'films', 'rank', 'higher', 'time', 'list', 'offer', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'showing', 'how', 'endless', 'hours', 'nothing', 'do', 'can', 'drive', 'soldier', 'just', 'as', 'crazy', 'time', 'spent', 'fighting', 'enemy']",N/A

At times it seemed like it wanted to become something better, and more exciting, but it just never did.I think it is obvious this movie was never intended as a war movie in the manner we usually expect, but the previews did not indicate it would be loaded with the hollywood liberal commentary that we have come to expect. I can stomach some of this as long as the movie is entertaining, but it wasn't. As far as the movie is concerned it seems as if it was intended more as a soldier's story with some anti-war social commentary thrown in for good measure, but I am not sure it even succeeds at that.I actually wish someone would make a good war movie about Gulf War 1 and leave out the political/social message which, without fail, always detracts from a movie. Not to say this one would have been much better had it been left out, but maybe they would have concentrated on more entertaining and interesting aspects of the movie.I am not sure about the rest of you, but the previews I saw on TV and the internet clearly gave me the impression this would be an exciting and intense war movie, and not a relatively slow sub-story (that may not be a word, but you get the point) set in the context of the war. Hollywood knows what will get us interested and get us to the theater, this was reflected in the previews, but I believe they played a little bait & switch on us.I must say some of the images and cinematography were very striking.

This is how sheltered Hollywood people like Sam Mendes see our military though; like over-the-top obnoxious clowns who can barely string three words together or shoot a gun. Also I wouldn't be surprised if Mendes or the original writer of this book were gay, because way too many scenes had these guys dancing around naked and pretending to screw each other. Never have I've seen guys act this way. Not even gay guys. But this is how Hollywood feminine men like to see guys act. The most awful example is when Jake Gyllenhaal is dancing around like a fool wearing nothing but a Santa hat.The music in the background was way out of place. How can I take a movie seriously when they start playing C&C; Music Factory's ""Everybody Sweat""? I felt like I was watching an MTV reality show.There were some good moments in Jarhead, and some decent acting here and there, but as soon as it started to get good, the movie would break into comedy again. Just trying too hard to be funny or absurd. The superior Full Metal Jacket, which Jarhead tried to be like, took the natural absurdity and humor embedded in war and let it speak for itself. This movie instead forces it on you. It really is in an insult to everyone involved to turn war, death and destruction into a comedy unless it's done right. Gyllenhaal's problem with his unfaithful girlfriend was also not handled correctly. This was the seed that caused him to begin to lose his sanity.

963811,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000DZIGDU,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 5]","This film, which is based on Anthony Swofford's account of his experiences in Desert Shield and Desert Storm, is a bit controversial but controvery that makes us think is a good thing.In some ways this film is the exact opposite of the film Black Hawk Down. In Black Hawk Down, the war action never ends, whereas in Jarhead it never seems to start. Thus Jarhead focuses on the preparation for war, the boredom waiting for war, and the irony of fighting a war at the fringe if the action.The film seemed to wish to make a statement about young male soldiers - what makes them tick. In this regard, the film succeeds. The film depicts these young 19 and 20 year old fellows as nieve about the world and yet foolishly cocky. These fellows were under educated and under achievers from rural areas or the inner city. They were not the sons of doctors and lawyers from the suburbs. They were influenced by a substance called testosterone that fuels aggressive blood lust and wild mood swings. They also are subject to the effects of alcohol, which we all know does not mix well with testosterone. Yet, they are also pack driven and eventually fall in line under the direction of an alpha male, played very well by Jamie Foxx in this film.The film also casts a jaundiced eye toward military leadership. These young men were not really prepared for war, despite their bravado. The malfunction of equipment, such as gas masks and communication equipment, was a constant running joke in the film. Those who know just how much tax payers must pay for such useless broken equipment to military contractors realize this is far from a joke.The story or plot involves a group of soldiers waiting to fight, always on the edges of the action, and thus they experience such adventures and finding thousands of burned Iraqi vehicles and charred bodies; or nomads complaining of shot camels; or a desert of black burning oil fields.I think that this is one of those films, like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, that get better with age and distance. With time the film will be seen as a film about the young male Marine, and not a political statement about our conflicts in Iraq.

Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  The movie starts off with your basic storyline, marines getting grilled by the DI and going through various Basic training tasks.  After they get shipped to Iraq everything seems to go downhill as far as the movie goes.  To be honest, the movie seemed more like a documentary than an actual movie.  The story seemed to be building up to a climax, it never got there, instead it just hovered along without doing much of anything.Don't expect a Full Metal Jacket type of movie, instead think of it as the Blair Witch Project of war movies; something always seems like its going to happen, but it never does.

His basic training is gone in a blink (probably to avoid further resemblance to ""Full Metal Jacket"") and almost immediately, he finds himself serving as a sniper in the Persian Gulf, waiting for Operation Desert Shield to become Desert Storm.In the meantime, he and his comrades are gung-ho, expertly trained, fairly well-equipped, coiled to strike ... and also scared, bored, lonely, frustrated and uninformed. That's a volatile cocktail.The result, as directed by Sam Mendes, will probably divide audiences, especially those hoping for combat scenes (a surplus of which will undoubtedly appear in the movies that spring from the second war with Iraq).This film, however, is slowly, episodically paced; its satire isn't always focused and there's a haziness with some details (did Marines really dig foxholes directly under drizzling torrents of oil?) that left me eager to read Swofford's book.But the movie is usually engaging and occasionally chilling; it gets solid performances out of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, who play career Marines; and its final scene, a montage set against Tom Waits' song, ""Soldier's Things,"" may be a bit too on the nose but it still got me.Ultimately, though, ""Jarhead"" just isn't the four- or five-star home run it could have been. Though it tries, it doesn't achieve the gritty satirical edge of, for example, David O. Russell's ""Three Kings"" (which made a statement about the Gulf War *and* told a nifty heist story *and* de-glamorized combat violence).

Yet it is based a book written by a Marine who tells his account of what happened while he was there.  Granted, his experience might be an unusually aberrant and anomalous one (or maybe author Anthony Swofford is just the Marines version of James Frey), but I think it's unfair to bash the movie's lack of ""realism"" because it quite faithfully portrays the words found in Swofford's account.Second, there are those who say nothing happens in this movie (and I had read some accounts of this going into the movie, so I was prepared for periods of boredom in viewing the DVD).  That said, I was never bored throughout the entire film and couldn't for the life of me figure out what could have been meant by the phrase ""nothing happens"" unless people are using it to mean ""no traditional war movie combat happens.""Because, to my eyes and ears, plenty happened (and if you don't want to be spoiled for this movie, skip this paragraph because I'm about to list those happenings): there's the grueling (if uncharacteristic) training sequences (including the shocking death at Camp Pendleton), the fake-branding initiation, the football game and its consequences, the Christmas Eve party accident with the fire (and its fallout), the near killing and suicide by Swoff, the tense and surreal desert meeting with the Bedouins, the friendly fire attack, the running through mortar blasts to get batteries, the burning of the oil fields, the meal at the Highway of Death, Fowler's finding and desecration of the corpse, the incongruity of the oil-covered horse, the sniper mission with Swoff and Troy, and the final victory celebrations (at both home and in the desert).Sure, there were never any full-on scenes of engaging the enemy, but enough happened that I was never restless even though the movie itself is sometimes a depiction of restlessness.Finally, to those who say this movie dishonors our military, I just have to say that I found one of the final scenes on the bus (I'm trying not give anything away here) to be a very poignant and more-than-symbolic illustration of the brotherhood across many military generations.I personally think this is very well-shot and well-acted representation of Swofford's book.  It's not meant to be a depiction of what happens in the center of Operation Desert Storm, but instead shows what takes place at the storm's fringes, where even there soldiers are at times showered upon by oil, mortar, and the fallout from their own anxiety and boredom.",4,Life on the Fringes of Desert Storm,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2690,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'couple', 'perspectives', 'are', 'prevalent', 'lot', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'reading', 'here', 'first', 'are', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'true', 'life', 'account', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Marine', 'who', 'account', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'there', 'Granted', 'experience', 'might', 'be', 'unusually', 'aberrant', 'anomalous', 'one', 'maybe', 'author', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'just', 'Marines', 'version', 'James', 'Frey', 'think', 'unfair', 'bash', 'movie', 'lack', 'realism', 'quite', 'faithfully', 'words', 'found', 'Swofford', 'account.Second', 'are', 'who', 'say', 'nothing', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'accounts', 'going', 'movie', 'was', 'prepared', 'periods', 'boredom', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'said', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'entire', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'meant', 'phrase', 'nothing', 'happens', 'people', 'are', 'using', 'mean', 'traditional', 'war', 'movie', 'combat', 'eyes', 'ears', 'plenty', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'skip', 'paragraph', ""'m"", 'list', 'happenings', 'grueling', 'uncharacteristic', 'training', 'sequences', 'including', 'shocking', 'death', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'fake-branding', 'initiation', 'football', 'game', 'consequences', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'party', 'accident', 'fire', 'fallout', 'near', 'killing', 'suicide', 'Swoff', 'tense', 'surreal', 'desert', 'meeting', 'Bedouins', 'friendly', 'fire', 'attack', 'running', 'mortar', 'blasts', 'get', 'batteries', 'burning', 'oil', 'fields', 'meal', 'Highway', 'Death', 'Fowler', 'finding', 'desecration', 'corpse', 'incongruity', 'oil-covered', 'horse', 'sniper', 'mission', 'Swoff', 'Troy', 'final', 'victory', 'celebrations', 'home', 'desert', '.Sure', 'were', 'never', 'full-on', 'scenes', 'engaging', 'enemy', 'enough', 'happened', 'was', 'never', 'restless', 'even', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'depiction', 'restlessness.Finally', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'military', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'bus', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'here', 'be', 'very', 'poignant', 'more-than-symbolic', 'illustration', 'brotherhood', 'many', 'military', 'generations.I', 'personally', 'think', 'very', 'well-shot', 'well-acted', 'representation', 'Swofford', 'book', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'depiction', 'what', 'center', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'instead', 'what', 'place', 'storm', 'fringes', 'where', 'even', 'soldiers', 'are', 'times', 'showered', 'oil', 'mortar', 'fallout', 'own', 'anxiety', 'boredom']",N/A

963823,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000DZIGDU,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 7]","The first Gulf War in Iraq has been an occasional subject matter of films, but not until Jarhead has a bona fide story emerged which captures the experience and heartache as told by director Sam Mendes.  Although Mendes has never been able to match the heights of American Beauty, he does an effective job of making the audience a participant in the rigors of desert warfare.Raw recruits are thrust into rough, basic training (at times with tragic results) as they are prepared for duty in Iraq. Among them are Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard).  Drill Sgt. Siek (Jamie Foxx) whips the young men into soldiers as they are deployed in the Persian Gulf with the imminent threat of war.  This is a rough life with constant humiliation and hazing.  Then comes Operation Desert Shield with the endless training, waiting, monotony, and more time away from family and home where wives and girlfriends lose touch or stray.  Such is the hapless life of the grunt.  A hostile terrain such as dirty oil fields adds to the isolation and need for rebellious acts to mitigate frustration.  Swofford and Troy are groomed to be snipers, and when their opportunity comes in Operation Desert Storm, they are more than ready until they are dealt an unexpected turn of events.The recurring phrase or motif in the film is ""Welcome to the suck."" That about sums up what these men are put through.  Adapted by William Broyles Jr. from Swofford's own real life experiences, it is an uncompromising recreation of `the suck'.  Mendes is content to show you what it was like but never dwells on any one scene longer than needed to get his point across.Told essentially from his point of view, the film opens and closes with a telling monologue by Swofford that sums up his experience.  He and Troy form the nucleus of the film's conscience and soul. Swofford made the mistake of signing up while Troy is the ironic soldier who wants to fight a war but is thwarted by bureaucracy.  The film does ring true in its depiction of the preparation for warfare with the heavy toll it takes on the soldiers and their personal lives. Periodically, an onscreen tag will appear to list the number of days the surging numbers of troops were in Iraq (5000 troops increases to 575,000 troops in 175 days), which helps put the events in perspective.  This film demythologizes war and instead presents war as a difficult and often life changing experience resulting not from actual combat, but from the tedium and loneliness.It is important to note that although Swofford shows a dislike for this man's army, he continues to do as he is told.  This apolitical film does not really take a stance on the war.  We really don't get enough background on Swofford or Troy to understand what makes these men tick.  Rather, we are left with what they experience and how they respond on a superficial level.  Troy comes across as inconsistent and his motivations are questionable.  While the evolution of their relationship doesn't always make sense, the film still packs an emotional punch. About two-thirds through, the film's momentum begins to lose some steam and direction.  There is also a sad event toward the end that is never fully explained.Gyllenhaal (Proof, Donnie Darko) is showing good maturity as an actor, and Sarsgaard (Kinsey) is effective as his closest buddy.  Jamie Foxx (Ray) registers quite convincingly as the leader of this bunch.  Dennis Haysbert and Chris Cooper have short but effective moments as commanding officers with axes to grind.Although movies have been set in the Iraqi conflict like Three Kings, this film deals directly with the soldiers who must do the dirty work.  In some ways this film shares a pedigree with an ensemble piece like Battleground. There are allusions to the Vietnam War particularly at the end involving a Vietnam veteran and also in clips from Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. The early drills recall some of the most harrowing moments from Full Metal Jacket with the verbal insults and discipline.  In fact, some of the vicious lines are hysterically funny.  It's certainly a far cry from An Officer and Gentlemen.  Like the soldiers at the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July, they go in wide eyed, full of optimism, and ready for action.  Instead, what they find is something that beats their spirits down.  In a way, the structure of vignettes and random incidents is similar to The Big Red One without the periodic voiceover.  Pop songs of the era are matched perfectly to scenes.  Technical aspects are good including the camera work and editing.  There are some memorable images including an eerie scene where the patrol comes upon a charred caravan of vehicles with burned, Iraqi people.Jarhead is not a perfect film, but it is well acted and pulls no punches on what it must have been like in Iraq. Those looking for an action packed war film will be severely disappointed and let down.  Except for some character inconsistencies, it is a realistic study in the psychological toll that military life takes on a human being.",3,JARHEAD's Dogs of War,1132012800,"11 15,

963824,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000DZIGDU,Cubist,"[64, 71]","Anticipation was high for Jarhead, the cinematic adaptation of Anthony Swifford's book of the same name about his experiences as a U.S. foot soldier in the first Persian Gulf War. The reaction to the movie was underwhelming to say the least as critics savaged it and audiences stayed away. Something was definitely in the air as the film also failed to pick up any nominations or awards at any of the important ceremonies (Golden Globes, Oscars, et al). Was the film really that bad or had it just been marketed wrong? Or, was it simply the victim of our current political climate?Jarhead is a film filled with striking images captured wonderfully by director of photography Roger Deakins. For example, Swofford and his platoon come across oil wells burning out of control, oil raining down on them. At night, they continue to burn providing the only light, and coupled with downpour of oil, looks like some kind of nightmarish vision of hell.Critics complained that nothing happened in the movie but wasn't that the point? The first Gulf War was typified by highly trained soldiers ready to kill who, for the most part, did nothing because it was predominantly a conflict fought in the air by extensive bombing that ended the war as quickly as it did. Jarhead encapsulates this notion well in a scene where Swoff and Troy are ordered to sniper two high ranking Iraqi officers and at the penultimate moment when they are given the go-ahead to kill they are ordered to stand down so that an air strike can come in and literally steal their thunder. This scene pretty much sums up the experience for a lot of soldiers over there.Sure, there are the unavoidable comparisons to the boot camp sequences in Full Metal Jacket to the ones in Jarhead but so what? No film lives in a vacuum and those scenes are only a small part of the movie and it soon settles into its own rhythm. The film that Jarhead most lives under the shadow of is Three Kings with its mixture of biting satire and horrific imagery of the madness of war, except that Jarhead ends where Three Kings begins. This is a film about humanity (or, rather the loss of it) and not an epic battle of good vs. evil that perhaps people were expecting. Jarhead is purposely anti-climatic. We won the war but what did we do to win it and why? And more importantly, what were we doing there? By that extension, we should also be asking the same questions about its sequel - one that we are still fighting and paying for.""Swoff's Fantasies"" feature four deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch. This is footage of Swofford's inner, fantasy life that was shown briefly in the actual movie but more was actually shot (and even more figured in the book).""News Interviews in Full"" features more footage of Swoff and his platoon being interviewed by the media with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. The director mentions that he let the actors adlib their answers to the pre-arranged questions.Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. Of note is a scene with Sam Rockwell who plays Swoff's uncle and is in the Marines. Mendes and Murch do an excellent job of explaining why this footage was cut and are candid in what stuff just didn't work.There is an audio commentary by Mendes who didn't want to overthink the camerawork or go for the meticulously staged compositions as he did with his previous movies and instead opted for a looser look with extensive hand-held camerawork. This is a very strong track as he defends his choices and tells all kinds of good anecdotes.There is another commentary track by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. and author Anthony Swofford. Broyles served in the Vietnam War and so these two war veterans talk with absolute authority about the authenticity of this movie. It's great to listen to Broyles and Swofford - two men who've been through what we are watching.On the Collector's Edition version are included three documentaries.First up, is the ""Jarhead Diaries."" Mendes provides an introduction where he states his distaste of electronic press kits (finally!) and so he had a documentary crew film more peripheral stuff and gave the actors their own cameras to shoot whatever they wanted. The actors are refreshingly candid about their feelings making this movie as they are going through the actual experience.""Semper Fi"" takes a look at four Marines who came home from the First Gulf War and from the current one. Anthony Swofford interviews these guys and has them talk about what their experiences were like over there and what their life is like now. Because he is also a veteran, he is able to get them to open up a bit. These are pretty sobering accounts as we listen to how hard it is for them to just turn off their combat training once they come back home.Finally, there is ""Background,"" a documentary about the extras who played anonymous Marines in the background of scenes. is a fascinating snapshot of their experiences.",5,Underrated and Underappreciated - Welcome to the suck.,1141603200,"03 6,

963825,A3GRG1G1YV022G,B000DZIGDU,dakotamoviefan,"[15, 34]","Jarhead, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgaard, concerns a Marine Corps unit preparing to be deployed during the first Persian Gulf war in 1991. This movie fails on so many points, it is hard to describe where to begin. The script and story are inconsistent, murky, and unoriginal, with most of Jarhead's theme taken from earlier psychotic military epics such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. The movie rambles and jumps from one pointless scene to another with very little information to connect them together. The acting in Jarhead is average and headache making with one vulgar performance indistinguishable from the other. The featured characters are mostly portrayed as bored, sex crazed, pornographic, maniacal, Marines despondent at not being able to kill something - anything after only a few months in the Gulf region. The dialogue of Jarhead is simplistic, and the swearing is non-stop with new lessons on how to conjugate the ""F"" word and its multiple variations.Is this the same Marine Corps from World War II that actually fought an enemy for several years and died honorably at remote places such as Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal, or the continuing Hollywood portrayal of temperamental, demented Marines still suffering from the ghosts of Vietnam ? In Jarhead we are led to believe that the soldiers are only a few steps away from an insane asylum after spending a few boring, inactive months in the war theater.

Based on Anthony Swofford's memoir, `Jarhead' stays pretty faithful to it's source and delivers a unique movie going experience that thrives on the brilliant performances of it's cast, in particular Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard.  As Anthony `Swoff' Swofford (Gyllenhaal) learns to adjust to life in the Marines he soon realizes that it's not what he expected it to be.  He doesn't want to be there, he never wanted to be there.On the other hand Troy (Sarsgaard) struggles with learning his reenlistment has been denied at that he must soon leave.  Troy wants nothing more than to fight, but he fears he'll never get the opportunity to engage in the very thing he's trained so hard for.  Both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard put so much into their characters that the fact both were snubbed of Oscar nominations baffles me.  Especially Peter who quickly became the most sympathetic character in the bunch and the one we felt the most pain for.I've heard this is a very realistic view of what our soldiers go through, a lot of waiting around for something to happen with nothing to do but get close to those around you and pray the ones you left haven't moved on.  It's not your typical war film so don't expect `Saving Private Ryan' or anything like that.  This is a drama about the affect war has on those involved.  The cinematography is astounding, just beautifully shot, and Sam Mendes deserves top notch honors for his brilliant directing.  I'm just really shocked that this movie was overlooked by Oscar.Jamie Foxx does deliver a nice performance if albeit overshadowed by almost every other actor here, especially the aforementioned as well as Lucas Black who delivers the comedic relief in this film.  Gyllenhaal had a killer year with his Oscar nominated performance in `Brokeback Mountain' as well as `Proof' and with each performance he brought something new and something fresh to the fore.

963827,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000DZIGDU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 9]","Jarhead is not your typical war movie.  It isn't about some soldier ascending to the plateau of hero or some impossible mission miraculously being achieved or even a slanted commentary on the dehumanization of the soldier experience.  Instinctively, the viewer of a war movie looks for something big in the end - be it a major battle or some philosophical point about war in general.  Jarhead doesn't deliver either of these two things - and that it both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.Jarhead is a personal war story, a truth-based depiction of military life and the Iraqi War as one Marine lived it.  We meet Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) in boot camp, as he first begins to question his decision to join up.  Swoff is anything but a model soldier, yet somehow he manages to get recruited into an elite Marine Sniper unit commanded by Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx).  His training is ruthless and difficult, yet his sharp-shooting ability gets him through it, despite a few major incidents along the way.  With Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, Swoff and his fellow Marines start to get ready for the real battlefield experience some of them seem to crave.  Rather than hitting the beaches running, though, the men are forced to endure month after month in the middle of very hot, very sandy nowhere.  Running around the desert in full chemical weapons suits is brutal, but nothing is more agonizing to these Marines than the interminable wait for something to happen.  Military discipline or no, it's no great shock when Swoff goes a little stir crazy out there - what is shocking, however, is that he wasn't drummed out of the Corps for what he did.  Anyway, the war finally begins, but it's nothing like what Swoff and his fellow snipers expected.  The war moves too quickly for them, leaving the men walking through wastelands littered with death and destruction and enduring the torture of a constant oily rain from all the oil wells Saddam had torched, as all the while they desperately yearn for the chance to actually engage the enemy and do what they were trained to do.We really only get to know three of the soldiers - Swoff, who just wants out; Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who just wants to remain a soldier, and Sykes, a career soldier who believes in and loves serving his country - but we get a number of viewpoints into Marine life from other prominent soldiers.  I daresay the emotional climax of the film is unique among the genre of war films; it's the exact opposite of what I expected and is actually quite jarring to sit there and watch.  Its significance is reinforced by the film's ending, but I don't think the conclusion really works all that well.  It's just sort of thrown out there at the end, and I don't think the movie gives us enough to truly put what happens in any real context.  It's the kind of ending, though, that makes you ask yourself what the real point of this movie was.  I've come to the conclusion that there really isn't a definitive point propelling itself through the script.  Managing to tow a rather objective line from start to finish, Jarhead gives you plenty to think about - but it leaves you to take what you will from the viewing experience.There are rarely any simple truths to be found in war, and there's more to being a hero than killing more than your share of enemies.  Don't go into Jarhead expecting an hour's worth of fierce combat or looking to have your pro- or anti-war beliefs strengthened or challenged.  Some people will not like this movie, but I think it's an important film that succeeds pretty darned well in putting the viewer inside the mind of a real soldier.",4,An altogether new breed of war movie,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3644,"['Jarhead', 'not', 'typical', 'war', 'movie', ""n't"", 'soldier', 'ascending', 'plateau', 'hero', 'impossible', 'mission', 'miraculously', 'being', 'achieved', 'even', 'slanted', 'commentary', 'dehumanization', 'soldier', 'experience', 'Instinctively', 'viewer', 'war', 'movie', 'something', 'big', 'end', 'be', 'major', 'battle', 'philosophical', 'point', 'war', 'general', 'Jarhead', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'two', 'things', 'greatest', 'strength', 'greatest', 'weakness.Jarhead', 'personal', 'war', 'story', 'truth-based', 'depiction', 'military', 'life', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'one', 'Marine', 'lived', 'meet', 'Swofford', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'boot', 'camp', 'first', 'question', 'decision', 'join', 'up', 'Swoff', 'anything', 'model', 'soldier', 'yet', 'somehow', 'get', 'recruited', 'elite', 'Marine', 'Sniper', 'unit', 'commanded', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Sykes', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'training', 'ruthless', 'difficult', 'yet', 'sharp-shooting', 'ability', 'few', 'major', 'incidents', 'way', 'Saddam', 'invasion', 'Kuwait', 'Swoff', 'fellow', 'Marines', 'start', 'get', 'ready', 'real', 'battlefield', 'experience', 'seem', 'crave', 'Rather', 'hitting', 'beaches', 'running', 'men', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'month', 'month', 'middle', 'very', 'hot', 'very', 'sandy', 'nowhere', 'Running', 'desert', 'full', 'chemical', 'weapons', 'suits', 'brutal', 'nothing', 'more', 'agonizing', 'Marines', 'interminable', 'wait', 'something', 'happen', 'Military', 'discipline', 'great', 'shock', 'when', 'Swoff', 'little', 'stir', 'out', 'there', 'what', 'shocking', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'drummed', 'Corps', 'what', 'did', 'Anyway', 'war', 'finally', 'nothing', 'what', 'Swoff', 'fellow', 'snipers', 'expected', 'war', 'moves', 'too', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'men', 'walking', 'wastelands', 'littered', 'death', 'destruction', 'enduring', 'torture', 'constant', 'oily', 'rain', 'oil', 'Saddam', 'had', 'torched', 'desperately', 'yearn', 'chance', 'actually', 'engage', 'enemy', 'do', 'what', 'were', 'trained', 'do.We', 'really', 'only', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'soldiers', 'Swoff', 'who', 'just', 'out', 'Troy', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'just', 'remain', 'soldier', 'Sykes', 'career', 'soldier', 'who', 'loves', 'serving', 'country', 'get', 'number', 'viewpoints', 'Marine', 'life', 'other', 'prominent', 'soldiers', 'daresay', 'emotional', 'climax', 'film', 'unique', 'genre', 'war', 'films', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'expected', 'actually', 'quite', 'jarring', 'sit', 'watch', 'significance', 'reinforced', 'film', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'conclusion', 'really', 'well', 'just', 'sort', 'thrown', 'there', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'enough', 'truly', 'put', 'what', 'real', 'context', 'kind', 'ending', 'though', 'ask', 'what', 'real', 'point', 'movie', 'was', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'really', ""n't"", 'definitive', 'point', 'propelling', 'script', 'Managing', 'tow', 'rather', 'objective', 'line', 'start', 'finish', 'Jarhead', 'plenty', 'think', 'take', 'what', 'will', 'viewing', 'are', 'rarely', 'simple', 'truths', 'be', 'found', 'war', 'more', 'being', 'hero', 'killing', 'more', 'share', 'enemies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Jarhead', 'expecting', 'hour', 'worth', 'fierce', 'combat', 'looking', 'have', 'pro-', 'anti-war', 'beliefs', 'strengthened', 'challenged', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'think', 'important', 'film', 'pretty', 'darned', 'well', 'putting', 'viewer', 'mind', 'real', 'soldier']",N/A

963830,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000DZIGDU,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[6, 7]","Jarhead (based on the 2003 best selling book by real life marine Anthony Swofford) is a haunting war film, but with a twist. When I say twist, I don't mean in a Sixth Sense sort of way. This is entirely different, and for those who followed Desert Storm as it was happening, it probably won't come as a twist at all. While I don't really want to go into the logistics of the direction this movie takes, I will say that Jarhead is more of a soldier's story than an all-out war picture.In this dramatic and often darkly funny offering from American Beauty and Road to Perdition director Sam Mendes, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff, a confused twenty year old who enlists in the Marines during Desert Storm because he more or less has nothing better to do. After rigorous training, Swoff quickly bonds with his fellow soldiers who gleefully refer to their military endeavor as ""the suck."" Perfectly fitting given where these men are headed. And where Desert Storm takes them is one of the most interesting aspects of this truly original look into a side of war you may never imagined.Sam Mendes likes to make complicated films about complicated people and Jarhead is certainly no different in that regard. As a result, this film will most certainly divide audiences. Why? That isn't an easy question to answer, but for starters, I have no doubt that there will be some who are offended by the idea that the men involved in the ""Police Action"" of Mendes' film suffer similar fates to those who have fought in bigger more romantic wars. But in a way, that's the whole point of this movie. War is hell regardless of the size of the battle.There are several moments of undeniable power in the film, none more so than a moving sequence in which a Vietnam Vet welcomes a bus full of Marines home from Desert Storm. This particular scene is made all the more powerful because of the vastly different wars these men have been involved in.The marketing campaign for Jarhead is slightly deceptive. From the get go, Mendes sort of baits the audience into thinking that they know exactly where this movie is headed. As the film opens, we are even treated to a sequence in which an abrasive, gung ho drill sergeant practically beats (literally) the rules of war into Swoff's head, in what could be best described as an ode to Full Metal Jacket's bigger than life R. Lee Ermey. The war film references don't stop there. There's also nods to the likes of Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter (a film I will never be able to watch in the same way again after seeing the way it's used in Jarhead) and the movie does have a tone that recalls David O. Russell's Three Kings, but Mendes ultimately takes Jarhead in a much different direction. The irony is, that while the journey itself is different, the outcome is virtually the same.Given that Jarhead revolves around the war theme, and more to the point, those who fight in a war, it may come as a surprise that the movie isn't necessarily anti-war or pro-war. It's somewhere in between. Jarhead isn't so much a political statement as it is a unique glimpse into a side of war that I've certainly never seen depicted in a film.Anchoring the movie is Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) who continues to mature as an actor with each passing performance. His Swoff is a compelling young man with layers upon layers of complexity, and Gyllenhaal is dramatic, vulnerable and extremely lively in the role. The rest of the cast is stellar. Peter Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Flight Plan) is extremely effective as Troy, the voice of reason in the field. Every time things begin to get out of hand, Troy is there to rectify the situation. Jaime Foxx lends his usual likable demeanor chewing up the scenery as an energetic sniper platoon leader. The rest of the actors who make up the sniper platoon are perfectly cast (they include Sling Blade's Lucas Black), and all are given a chance to shine individually, but it is the way they play off one another that really make the film tick. This cast has genuine chemistry. They truly come across as a brotherhood.As Mendes films go, Jarhead didn't leave the same impression on me that American Beauty and Road to Perdition did., but it's still an exceptional film and takes this particular genre in to uncharted territory.

According to many, the life depicted in the film does not resemble what is called reality. Curiously, reality is the criterion used to judge this film but not, say, 'Star War' or for that matter about 99% of Hollywood films. Like the director, I have no experience whatsoever of war, but I have a lifetime of film-going under my belt. As a film about film-making and not about war, this movie works. It is often visually stunning. There are numerous strikingly beautiful, stunningly horrid scenes that belong to the art of film and to nothing else. In this regard, it does obviously seek to echo Coppola's masterpiece on Vietnam, which, one should remember, was dismissed by the critics. The acting is quite good. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Fox are both very strong here. There are some great scenes, although one might very well say that as a whole it doesn't excite. The story arc lacks dramatic momentum. It is episodic. The central plot of a soldier trained to do something that never happens is a problem; this is a kind of existential moment that is hard to dramatize. Waiting is difficult to bring over, yet we know that waiting is one of the crucial elements of what makes war so dreadful. If anything about the picture is real, this would be it, yet this is why the question of whether it is 'real' strikes me as irrelevant. Often to tell a good story one must let the 'real' go in favor of drama. In life, we often suffer from the fact that nothing happens, which is called boredom; in film, boredom is to be avoided at all costs.

Do those who have actually served find the film to be over the top and a distortion of reality?  Whatever, I can only say that I enjoyed Jarhead immensely.  We sleep peacefully only because such brutal and well trained individuals are guarding our nation.  The concerns of Thomas Hobbes must be resolved long before we can pay attention to the democratic principles of John Locke.  Anthony Swofford's experiences as a Marine sniper during Desert Storm shows the less than perfect humanity of those who kill the sworn enemies of the United States.  These brave men are often vulgar, excessively macho, and rarely politically correct.  They are sent into harm's way by our elected officials.  Do they always understand the purpose of their sacrifices?  No, sometimes our committed warriors are perplexed.  A secular faith in the democratic process is required.  Civilians ultimately make the decisions---and the military must obey.  Swofford and his buddies are ordered to defeat Saddam Hussein's attempt to monopolize the oil industry in the Middle East.  At the end, the dictator is humiliated but survives.  Our politicians decide not to eradicate Saddam's regime.  Might this disillusion the more idealistic Marine? It doesn't matter. A Marine must obey. This is the way it has to be.  Utopia is not possible on this side of the grave.  A democratic society can only do the best it can.There are no weak performances in Jarhead.  The acting is superb.  To an outsider like myself, these Marines seem like the real deal.  Take a chance on this film.  The risk is worth it.  I consider Jarhead to be a five star experience.

963836,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B000DZIGDU,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[2, 10]","Call me old-fashioned, but a good story needs three components:  a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Leave out any one of the three, and the recipient of the story--even though he or she may be impressed by the authenticity, grit, and determination of the components portrayed--walks away from the experience with feelings of ho-hum indifference, at best.Such is the case with director Sam Mendes' JARHEAD (""High and tight, Soldier, high and tight!"").  This movie depicting a Marine Corps unit's adventures during the 1991 Gulf War has a solid beginning, when we are introduced to several characters as they crawl and grunt through basic training before deployment to Arabia; and it has a middle, the subsequent ""waiting game"" the soldiers must endure prior to conflict--waiting that entails boredom, hydration, fighting amongst themselves, hydration, lamenting when their wives or girlfriends in the States dump them, hydration, going desert bonkers, and more hydration.  And then. . .nothing.  The unit marches through a barren wasteland, punctuated by burning oil wells belching hellfire into the sky, yet never encounters an enemy to engage.  Before a shot can be fired, the war is over; the unit gets shipped back home.There's no ending.  Granted, there is an ""ending,"" but nothing to make us wonder, understand, or even give a darn why we were subjected to the antics of this bunch of soldiers--other than an underhanded agenda to gig the Marine Corps (duly noted by the narrating character).JARHEAD is a well-made, very visual, often intense film.  Lead character Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a gritty, sometimes over-the-top performance, and he's complimented very aptly by Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, and several other young actors.  Jamie Foxx gets tapped on the shoulder to portray the stereotypical staff sergeant who yells and barks and admonishes and punishes and so on.  Mendes shows us the dirt, grime, sweat, comedy, drama, fear, insecurity, and immaturity of a group of males little more than boys out in the desert, augmented by an absolutely fantastic musical score; but he doesn't give the viewer an ending to match the story so diligently put in place.

There's nothing like macho and usually morbid Marine Corps humor to get me laughing, and this film offers a great deal of that!This is what I could call a somewhat unconventional war movie.  Most of the film is centered around Operation Desert Shield.  Instead of most war movies where we see charcters trying to accomplish a particular objective(s) while encased in the fog of war, this movie approaches war from a different angle.  It's mostly about the anticipation of fighting was Saddam Insane called the ""Mother of all battles"" (a battle which, of course, never did materialize).Instead of dodging bombs & bullets, the Marines have to deal with 6 months of tedious drills, getting Dear John letters, worrying about getting Dear John letters, having their nerves frayed by living in close-quarters with others, coping with the harsh desert environment and having to overcome the sheer boredom of it all.The movie does a good job of depicting just how mundane it can be to be a soldier on the supposed ""front lines"" in this day & age.  The Marine Snipers in the movie were among the first to land in Saudi Arabia, and yet they only get to flirt with actual combat duties.  There is certainly an irony in that.Jamie Fox portrays one of those gung-ho Marine Staff Sergeants who it's easy to poke fun at.  While I was in the Navy there was a running joke that 20 years of sea duty turned men's minds to mush. Sailors start to actually worship the Navy after all of that time deployed, and the military becomes a sort of obession.  Looks like the same sort of thing happens in the other services as well!If you want a ""traditional"" war movie, this one may not be for you.  One of the scenes, just before the Marines were deployed, showed them watching APOCOLYPSE NOW in a theatre.  I believe that scene was put in to show the contrast between a ""dramatic"" war movie & what the real-life ordeal of a soldier would be like in Desert Storm.If you're a fan of military movies in general or if you have been in the military, I believe you'll find this movie to your liking.

963839,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B000DZIGDU,D. Rodgers,"[6, 7]","Jarhead isn't your typical combat action-war film. In fact it's probably the most unconventional war drama out there. There are no scenes of action, combat, or firefights, and you'd think that that would make Jarhead a boring and uninteresting war film. Well the answer is strangely No. Jarhead does have a moment or two where boredom settles in briefly, but the film is never really uninteresting. The film is based on the book, of the same title, written by former Marine Anthony Swofford (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal). Anthony enlists in the Marines hoping to make something out of himself. He goes through basic training; where he practices and becomes a top ranking sniper. He develops a ""taste"" for what they call the ""pink mist"", that's a head shot, or kill shot for those of you who were wondering.Once he and his platoon are finished with Basic they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia where they wait for action... and then they wait some more, and then some more. The lack of action and the soldier's lust to ""get some"" is eating them up inside. They're bored, and they've been highly and thoroughly trained for combat, but the waiting game is killing them. The war is being mostly fought and won by the ""zoomies"" (that's what the Marines call fighter jets). The soldier's are not only suffering from boredom, but also from sexual frustration. They all wonder if their girlfriends are cheating on them, or will dump them. They seem to have very little belief that they'll remain faithful to them while they're away at war, and a couple of them aren't, as can clearly be seen in one particularly shocking scene. There's also another pretty shocking nightmare scene that puts the Nirvana song Something in the Way to great use.Jarhead is less about fighting a war, and more about a soldier's mental state while at war, especially when dealing with the itching nerve to want to be in the middle of combat putting your skills to the test. It can drive some men mad. Jarhead isn't about politics, it's about men, not exactly soldiers (they're men first, soldiers second). The first half of Jarhead is almost a comedy, with a number of goofy moments and dark humor. Then the film slides into the surreal as men are riding on the edge of battle. The scenes with the burning oil fields is darkly haunting and at the same time beautiful. Jarhead isn't Black Hawk Down, it isn't a film about diving into chaos and rescuing your buddy, it's about the way men are in the places and situations of war. The film delivers a number of strong performances from good actors surrounding Gyllenhaal, like Jamie Foxx as Staff Sgt. Sykes (he plays his role very realistically and funny) and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy, Swofford's closest friend.Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) has created the first real war film that fully immerses the viewer in what it's really like to be a soldier, but surprisingly without any combat, and somehow it still succeeds. I should also mention the film's score by Thomas Newman, like all of his scores, is absolutely sensational, and really helps set the tone and rhythm. The film's unrestraint, unflinching look at male soldiers is strangely unique and fascinating. Most war films have a particular message to tell you, in Saving Private Ryan it was the shocking brutality of war, and in Black Hawk Down it was what drives men to go into dangerous, chaotic situations, but in Jarhead I'm not so sure there's a message to learn. Jarhead is more like real life, it's pointless, and it's more of an experience and a state of mind than a lesson. It's a story about men in uniform, and the uniform doesn't change anything, they're still a man underneath. If Mendes has said anything in Jarhead it's ""once a solider, always a solider"". You take those experiences with you, and no matter what you do with the rest of your life you'll always be a soldier. The main thing I said to myself after watching Jarhead was, ""Well, that was surprisingly different... and good."" And sometimes different is all a film really needs to be in order to work, and Jarhead works. This is one of my favorite films of the year, and one of my favorite war films, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down.",5,"""This is Vietnam music.

963840,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B000DZIGDU,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[8, 10]","Since we all know what choreographed horse-dung most ""reality"" shows are these days, it is downright refreshing to watch a movie that skillfully conveys a time, a place, and a group of people as well as this film captures Gulf War One.  You remember, the time we actually won, actually GOT ""Mission Accomplished"" with barely a few scratches (well, ok there were a few hundred casualties but 90% by accidents, friendly fire or by the one Scud missile that hit an Army barracks).  Yes, THAT war---led by the elder Bush not his idiot son, and where our troops were truly greeted as liberators.Problem was, for the boots on the ground, Gulf War One was really one long tedious slog leading up to a total anti-climax.  The only American combat personnel to really see much action were the air force, who did most of the work ahead of the ground forces.  Oh, were all wars for oil so easy and painless!  Sam Mendes, director of the highly acclaimed ""American Beauty,"" does a fine job of capturing exactly what that experience was like, mostly from the perspective of a brighter-than-average 20 year recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a slightly absurdist anti-hero who quickly regrets his decision to volunteer which he later describes as, ""I got lost on the way to college.""Yes there are allusions to other classic war movies, and there are a number of parallels with the movie that the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr correctly called ""the greatest war movie of all time:"" Stanley Kubrick's masterful ""Full Metal Jacket"" which this movie predictably cannot match.  Yet it is far from a failure, as some reviwers have claimed---Mendes has achieved enough clout and independence as a filmmaker to not have to pander to the lowest common denominator audience's eternal desire for easily recognizable good guys, bad guys, and uplifting endings.  What we get instead is a vivid and generally very entertaining portrait of men trained and then thrown into a war that actually wasn't much of a war.Mendes certainly does share some subtle anti-war sentiments, but that does not prevent him from admiring the devotion that men develop for their fellow soldiers, which is the one thing that keeps them in battles that they often know are totally absurd and unnecessary, and keeps them from rebelling against commanding officers, generals and politicians who usually have far more ego than intelligence.  He also does a fine job of exposing the viewer to the very unglamorous realities of military daily life and military culture and the animalistic group dynamics that develop between young men thrown together into that type of environment.So those viewers looking for a nice kiss-the-flag exercise in sentimental patriotism will surely be disappointed, as will those violence junkies hoping to see some satisfying combat scenes---there really aren't any.  Mendes goes to great pains to NOT commercialize or cosmetize violence, and this is perhaps the reason why he has been accused of making a ""cold"" and ""distanced"" film in some quarters.  For instance, he chooses to show us the charred and smoking aftermath of the ""Highway of Death"" massacre in which US aircraft slaughtered thousands of Iraqis fleeing Kuwait ahead of the American invasion instead of the actual massacre itself.  What many viewers and reviewers seem to overlook is that in this day and age, with our modern air-based weaponry, much of war itself IS very much ""cold"" and ""distanced""---at least the wars that we still win quickly and convincingly.""Jarhead"" is most enjoyable if you have some appetite for dark and absurdist humor, and do not insist that every movie have the same predictable Hollywood 3-act plot lines and focus-group hooks.  Yes there are a few somewhat clunky moments but there are also some exquisitely bittersweet ones, such as when a Vietnam USMC vet hops on the homecoming bus for the returning soldiers and tries in vain to bond with them.  A Steven Spielberg or other such director would not have been able to resist turning that into some tear-jerking, crowd-pleasing ending---Mendes has the cojones and the artistic integrity to just tell it like it is, even if the audience would much prefer to get their rocks off through the usual tricks and cliches.",5,"a REAL slice of ""reality!""",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4235,"['know', 'what', 'choreographed', 'horse-dung', 'most', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'days', 'downright', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'time', 'place', 'group', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Gulf', 'War', 'One', 'remember', 'time', 'actually', 'won', 'actually', 'GOT', 'Mission', 'Accomplished', 'barely', 'few', 'scratches', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'hundred', 'casualties', '90', '%', 'accidents', 'friendly', 'fire', 'one', 'Scud', 'missile', 'hit', 'Army', 'barracks', 'Yes', 'THAT', 'war', '-led', 'elder', 'Bush', 'not', 'idiot', 'son', 'where', 'troops', 'were', 'truly', 'greeted', 'liberators.Problem', 'was', 'boots', 'ground', 'Gulf', 'War', 'One', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'long', 'tedious', 'slog', 'leading', 'up', 'total', 'anti-climax', 'only', 'American', 'combat', 'personnel', 'really', 'see', 'much', 'action', 'were', 'air', 'force', 'who', 'did', 'most', 'work', 'ahead', 'ground', 'forces', 'Oh', 'were', 'wars', 'oil', 'easy', 'painless', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'director', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'American', 'Beauty', 'fine', 'job', 'capturing', 'exactly', 'what', 'experience', 'was', 'mostly', 'perspective', 'brighter-than-average', '20', 'year', 'recruit', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'slightly', 'absurdist', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'quickly', 'decision', 'volunteer', 'later', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'college', 'are', 'allusions', 'other', 'classic', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'number', 'parallels', 'movie', 'Boston', 'Globe', 'critic', 'Jay', 'Carr', 'correctly', 'called', 'greatest', 'war', 'movie', 'time', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'masterful', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'movie', 'predictably', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'far', 'failure', 'reviwers', 'have', 'claimed', '-Mendes', 'achieved', 'enough', 'clout', 'independence', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'have', 'pander', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'audience', 'eternal', 'desire', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'uplifting', 'endings', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'vivid', 'generally', 'very', 'entertaining', 'portrait', 'men', 'trained', 'then', 'thrown', 'war', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'war.Mendes', 'certainly', 'share', 'subtle', 'anti-war', 'sentiments', 'not', 'prevent', 'admiring', 'devotion', 'men', 'develop', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'one', 'thing', 'battles', 'often', 'know', 'are', 'totally', 'absurd', 'unnecessary', 'rebelling', 'commanding', 'officers', 'generals', 'politicians', 'who', 'usually', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'ego', 'intelligence', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'exposing', 'viewer', 'very', 'unglamorous', 'realities', 'military', 'daily', 'life', 'military', 'culture', 'animalistic', 'group', 'dynamics', 'develop', 'young', 'men', 'thrown', 'together', 'type', 'environment.So', 'viewers', 'looking', 'nice', 'kiss-the-flag', 'exercise', 'sentimental', 'patriotism', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'violence', 'junkies', 'hoping', 'see', 'satisfying', 'combat', 'scenes', '-there', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'Mendes', 'great', 'pains', 'NOT', 'commercialize', 'cosmetize', 'violence', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'been', 'accused', 'making', 'cold', 'distanced', 'film', 'quarters', 'instance', 'show', 'charred', 'smoking', 'aftermath', 'Highway', 'Death', 'massacre', 'US', 'aircraft', 'slaughtered', 'thousands', 'Iraqis', 'fleeing', 'Kuwait', 'ahead', 'American', 'invasion', 'instead', 'actual', 'massacre', 'What', 'many', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'overlook', 'day', 'age', 'modern', 'air-based', 'weaponry', 'much', 'war', 'very', 'much', 'cold', 'distanced', '-at', 'least', 'wars', 'still', 'win', 'quickly', 'convincingly', 'Jarhead', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'appetite', 'dark', 'absurdist', 'humor', 'do', 'not', 'insist', 'movie', 'have', 'same', 'predictable', 'Hollywood', '3-act', 'plot', 'lines', 'focus-group', 'hooks', 'are', 'few', 'somewhat', 'clunky', 'moments', 'are', 'also', 'exquisitely', 'bittersweet', 'ones', 'such', 'when', 'Vietnam', 'USMC', 'vet', 'hops', 'homecoming', 'bus', 'returning', 'soldiers', 'tries', 'vain', 'bond', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'other', 'such', 'director', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'resist', 'turning', 'tear-jerking', 'crowd-pleasing', 'ending', 'cojones', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'just', 'tell', 'even', 'audience', 'would', 'much', 'prefer', 'get', 'rocks', 'usual', 'tricks', 'cliches']",N/A
963841,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000DZIGDU,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films - not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and Brian DePalma's ""Casualties of War"" but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voiceover is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's ""Sling Blade"".Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 ""Three Kings"", which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in ""Pulp Fiction"".

I enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy the DVD. What a good buy.""Jarhead"" is a film directed by Oscar winning Sam Mendes. It is about a US Martine Unit that participated in the first Gulf War. It shows the hard, intense training that takes place before armed conflict, particularly for those who make it to the US Marines. However, after the training and after more training, there is a long period waiting for action whilst politicians try to make up their minds about whether on not they should embark on this particular war. For guys that are roaring for action, this is a period of utter and intense boredom.The US Marine Unit arrived for duty in Kuwait and waited for hostilities to commence. During this long and boring period of waiting, soldiers engage in all sorts of things like watching dirty films and trying to create some sort of fun in the hot and desolate desert environment.Finally the war breaks out. This is accompanied by intense fear that Saddam Hussein's troops might use chemical weapons. After all, the Iraq leader had used it with devastating results against his people. Happily for the Marines, Saddam wisely decided not to use the weapons. However, Iraq troops unexpectedly and inexplicably set oil wells on fire creating an inferno which is like hell on earth.This is an interesting film based on the military memoirs of former marine Anthony Swofford. The film is essentially highlighting an anti-war message. This then makes it more than just a film about a specific war but rather has a message about all wars which share a lot in common, particularly their ultimate futility with no winner but lots of suffering by innocent civilians and wanton destruction of property.",4,Interesting Movie,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1776,"['first', 'watched', 'superb', 'film', 'KLM', 'Royal', 'Dutch', 'Airlines', 'flight', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'What', 'good', 'buy', 'Jarhead', 'film', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'US', 'Martine', 'Unit', 'participated', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'hard', 'intense', 'training', 'place', 'armed', 'conflict', 'particularly', 'who', 'make', 'US', 'Marines', 'However', 'training', 'more', 'training', 'long', 'period', 'waiting', 'action', 'whilst', 'politicians', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'not', 'should', 'embark', 'particular', 'war', 'guys', 'are', 'roaring', 'action', 'period', 'utter', 'intense', 'boredom.The', 'US', 'Marine', 'Unit', 'arrived', 'duty', 'Kuwait', 'waited', 'hostilities', 'commence', 'long', 'boring', 'period', 'waiting', 'soldiers', 'engage', 'sorts', 'things', 'watching', 'dirty', 'films', 'trying', 'create', 'sort', 'fun', 'hot', 'desolate', 'desert', 'environment.Finally', 'war', 'out', 'accompanied', 'intense', 'fear', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'troops', 'might', 'use', 'chemical', 'weapons', 'Iraq', 'leader', 'had', 'used', 'devastating', 'results', 'people', 'Happily', 'Marines', 'Saddam', 'wisely', 'decided', 'not', 'use', 'weapons', 'However', 'Iraq', 'unexpectedly', 'inexplicably', 'set', 'oil', 'wells', 'fire', 'creating', 'inferno', 'hell', 'earth.This', 'interesting', 'film', 'based', 'military', 'memoirs', 'former', 'marine', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'film', 'essentially', 'highlighting', 'anti-war', 'message', 'then', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'specific', 'war', 'rather', 'message', 'wars', 'share', 'lot', 'common', 'particularly', 'ultimate', 'futility', 'winner', 'lots', 'suffering', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'wanton', 'destruction', 'property']",N/A

963845,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B000DZIGDU,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[13, 17]","The film 'Jarhead' is based on a book of the same name by by Anthony Swofford; both the book and the film are bound to make some people angry. A Marine sniper (STA) during Desert Storm I in the early 1990s, he recounted his experiences there with vivid emotion, weaving in his experiences of boot camp, adolescence, and civilian life after the Corps in the process. This is now a major motion picture chronicling many aspects of his story, with significant differences.It was apparent in the book, and carries over to the film that Swofford has a chip on his shoulder - something he'll most likely readily admit. He has a 'bad attitude', and in fact revels in it. One wonders if this is a product of his war experiences, his Marine Corps training, or his upbringing. At one point his mother, who never really liked the idea of her son being in the Marines, but who wouldn't stand in her son's way, said 'I lost my baby boy when you went to war.' She described Swofford as being sweet and gentle prior to that, and angry and unhappy afterwards. One wonders how much of a change is there - if one can take the stories at face value, this is the same boy who had a fist-fight with his father over going in the Corps at the age of 17, and who had Marine Corps decals put on his shirts as a child. One of his drill instructors even gave Swofford what he considered a great compliment - 'you'll be a great killer someday.'I make the caveat that one might not be able to take all of this at face value, because like many men in this kind of situation, Swofford is likely to exaggerate - making some pieces more dramatic and other pieces less so. Swofford recounts many tales of men in his sniper platoon who had adjustment problems after the war; one can but wonder if that is true for Swofford, too. Also, Swofford admits to being willing and able to lie if the cause is, in some internal sense, justified - his dealings with brother, in the Army in Germany who later died of cancer, is a case in point.  Then we have the 'made in Hollywood' aspects of the film that mean this can be no documentary, but has to be dramatised.  In fact, truth is probably stranger (not necessarily better or worse) than what is portrayed on the screen.Regardless of the details which may or may not be completely true (and, as with many autobiographical pennings, some of the details are necessarily changed), the emotion certainly is. Perhaps the strongest point that comes across is a sense of disappointment and cynicism - that Swofford has ideals and goals is not at issue, although he does downplay these (he doth protest too much sometimes); but his experiences in the Corps and in the war were not what he dreamed. He mentions at various time the recruiting posters and campaigns - while it is true that Marine Corps never promises an easy life (quite the opposite), rarely does one learn prior to entry that one might end up being on the stirring end of the latrine clean-up detail; of human-refuse dump ablaze and blowing all over the place.Just as in the book, the film gives one a sense of some of the problems that the 'average' grunt faces in combat situations. This war was very different from Vietnam, of course, but some of the issues are the same - interminable waiting, equipment malfunctions (if it isn't just plain missing), fear and bravado in a strange mix, questioning and ambiguity as to the value of the war, the cause, and even their own lives. The Desert Shield/Desert Storm situation is reflected in the page numbers of Swofford's book and the timing of this film - a lot deals with the Desert Shield portion, the hurry-up-and-wait aspect; surprisingly little time is spent with Desert Storm itself, as it was on and over so quickly, relatively speaking.  There is a lot of psychological drama in this film in the waiting aspect; there's also a strong undertone of the absurdity of war.Stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford, Jamie Foxx as Sgt. Siek and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy do an excellent job in their respective roles.  Foxx turns in a really good performance, and this must be the year for Gyllenhaal.  Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) takes a tough book and turns it into a tough film, which is not going to replace a film such as 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'The D.I.' for quintessential Marine film, but will most likely in get top billing among many for the portrayals and situations, especially some of the more bizarre and incomprehensible bits.Again, while there is undoubtedly exaggeration here, and one must take some of Swofford's tales with a grain of salt (or, perhaps sand), there is realism and truth in the feelings these situations engendered. I can understand the anger of Marines and other military who read the book and will see the film and feel a sense of betrayal, but I can also understand those who feel that Swofford is saying what others can't or won't say. This is a tough product.  While I would never want the Marine Corps or military to be judged by this one thing, it is a perspective worth including in the overall mix. Snipers have a reputation for being a bit on the fringes anyway, and Swofford's story in that regard is very true to form.",4,Semper fi,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,5215,"['film', 'based', 'book',

I've seen it in many forms over my 21 years of Active Duty.  I don't think it shed a bad light on the USMC, because these troops didn't act much differently then some of the Vietnam troops did.

963850,A3KGBMSG9ASVL,B000DZIGDU,Gozer,"[3, 8]","This film is disappointing on several levels.In Swofford's world, there are no honorable servicemen. Every Marine is a failure who joined the military to escape jail, troubles at home or boredom with life; all Marines have trouble following the most basic of orders; and staff sergeants follow their platoons -- whose members never separate -- from basic training to specialty schools to deployment, kind of like how teachers in TV high school dramas follow their students to college.This would be no big deal if there was a purpose to those portrayals, but there isn't. The pacing is torturously sluggish, the infantrymen are portrayed with a gung-ho ""Semper Fi!"" attitude that rarely exists among the people on the ground, and the random bits of anti-war dialogue from one of the Marines are so hilariously out-of-place they sound like a bad Robert Fisk impersonation.It's kind of like the director wanted to revel in the primal experiences of a Marine company about to go to war and explore the complex range of feelings of his characters, all while portraying them as pigs and idiots. So it's hard to drum up empathy with the cast, and it's especially difficult to see what the point of this movie is.The movie's plot reminds me of Tigerland, another film that shows military guys gearing up for war without any of the actual combat. And there is something incredibly promising about exploring that experience -- the nervousness, fear and even anticipation of being sent to off to war and combat, fizzling out in odd feelings and frustration when it becomes clear war (for these guys) isn't going to actually happen. But this movie does almost nothing right in terms of capturing those feelings. It feels like a badly developed TV movie.There were very few things I liked about Jarhead, but some of the comraderie sequences were decently funny and there were lots of nice shots of the Marines moving through the desert, set to catchy interpretations of traditional Arab music. Unfortunately neither of those things make the movie worth watching.

963851,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000DZIGDU,Grady Harp,"[6, 8]","Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM.  We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different.  JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement.  And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne.  Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight!  But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support.  And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home.  And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow.  He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together.  The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow.  Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascos, and Mendes does allow us to see that.  But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies.

This is a very good film, dispite some commnets by serving personnel and others. The book author/movie makers did however Oliver Stone the story ALA Platoon to some degree. Some of the events in the movie were actually Army events. An example of this as the soldier whose wife sent the tape if her having intercourse with guy next store. She then sending the tape to the soldier in theater and he commited suicide. If the culminazation events are a juxtapositioning of events to tell a story is life in this particular war then it could be considered a valid form of storytelling. I don't believe that the author experienced all of these events personally. There are shades of some of the better known Vietman War films in the craft of this movie.I have never been a Marine, but I have served in the armed forces for over 20 years. Servicemen can and do behave as some of these men do under stress. By acting crazy, it is what some people do that keeps people sane. It is also what some do under stress and go insane...Overall I think that the translation of the story to a big screen very good, and Jamie Fox is highly effective as the Platoon Sergeant.

963854,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B000DZIGDU,Gregory William Locke,"[0, 0]","Director Sam Mendes, the man responsible for modern classics American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, almost always seems to know what he's doing, be it heavy (Road to Perdition) or light (Away We Go). This is why his 2005 war film, Jarhead, is such a disappointment. The concept of the film is great and the cinematography is, at times, as beautiful as you'll see in a war film. But damn, some of the attempts to make the film seem ... err ... hip, are embarrassing. The incessant use of unfitting, of-its-time music - used as an attempt to keep the movie light and fun - is so blatant and annoying that you can't help but cringe. The playful moments amongst the Marines who make up the story of this film are borderline cheesy. Actually, they're not borderline anything - they're flat out cheese.This is a shame because, aside from the then-hip casting of leadman Jake Gyllenhaal (at the time a sudden cult figure thanks to Donnie Darko), the casting was great. The writing was great. The production was great. These few small mistakes keep Jarhead from being the best war film of the Naughts.The story of Jarhead is simple. Our hero, Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal in his first major studio lead role), joins the Marines just as Operation Desert Shield is about to hit. He spends a lot of time adjusting and questioning what he's doing, but even more time wondering what his girlfriend is doing back home. (We're made to feel like this girlfriend of his is his everything - amusing, considering the character is 20 years old.) At the urging of Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swofford becomes a Marine sniper, which he is very good at. He's he part of an ace team of shooters, paired with the always excellent Peter Sarsgaard, as Cpl. Alan Troy.The crew of Marines, led in rank by Sykes and spirit by Troy, almost never appear scared. Aside from Skarsgaard, who leads the way as far as acting, Lucas Black (as Chris Kruger) stands out. He's a Texas boy who goes back and forth between airhead and the most reasonable man in his squad. At one point, when the Marines are discussing the point of the war, Kruger puts it straight: ""I know these oil guys; I've been around them all my life. They drink oil like water. This is a war about money; we're here to keep the oil cheap.""No one believes him. Later in the film, when the soldiers are told to sign a waiver and take an untested pill that can supposedly fight the side effects of nuclear weapons, Kruger again stands up, spitting the pill out after fighting with Sykes. These are some of the most memorable scenes, not only because of the subject matter, but because Black (who most know as the young, twangy boy in Sling Blade), is a heck of an actor.But don't get excited, this isn't an overly political film. There are points made here and there, but, mostly, the film attempts to show what it was like to be a Marine during Operation Desert Shield. The movie moves slow as we watch the Marines sit and wait. They foolishly hope for action as the days pass. There are side stories here and there (watching porn together, sneaking alcohol, accidentally burning up a tent full of explosives, etc.) that remind more of an American Pie movie than Apocalypse, Now.But that's okay, in a movie this slow, I'm guessing the producers and Mendes knew they'd need some cheap thrills. Personally, I'd rather have the film be shorter and less fluffy, but, when you cast Jake Gyllenhaal, you almost HAVE to bring the fluff. My personal favorite comedy bit, and maybe the only one that works in the entire film, happens when a helicopter flies over the Marines when they're at their lowest point. As the helicopter passes, blaring the Doors song ""Break On Through,"" Swofford looks at the sky and says ""that's Vietnam music; can't we get our own music?""After about 80 minutes the film starts to pick up. Our crew of Marines are in the 112 degree desert, chasing a group of fire-happy Iraqi soldiers. The way cinematographer Roger Deakins (known mostly for his work on The Shawshank Redemption and every great Coen Brothers film) shoots the desert footage is amazing. I don't want to give anything away, but will say that, between Skarsgaard's powerful performance and Deakins' cinematography, Jarhead is a must-see. Sometimes it feels like a painfully by-the-books war film and at other times it stands alone - thanks to Deakins' amazing eye and mastery of his craft. (Towards the end we get to see some incredible footage of a desert filled with burning oil wells. It's the kind of cinematic imagery film fans dreamt of before all this crazy CGI stuff became so standard. I recall being wide-eyed and out of breath through many of these scenes.)Is there a big bang at the end? Does the suspense and conflict finally come as it does in, well, every war film ever? Well ... maybe. Kinda. I don't quite know how to explain it. I will say this: upon it's initial release, the ending made the average movie-goer angry and many cinephile types happy. It's uncompromising and subtle, which is strange when you consider how much, at times, it felt likes Mendes was trying to make an artsy war film for the popcorn crowd. Instead, he ends up with a film that is only a few cheap mistakes away from being a classic.Jarhead is full of memorable lines, but is best summed up in the final minutes when Swofford says ""every war is different; every war is the same.""",3,"Well Made, But Leaves No Impression",1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,5387,"['Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'man', 'responsible', 'modern', 'classics',

Just one day in the life of a Gulf War Marine, and ""Jarhead"", effectively uses this common perspective of your average joe, in a less than glorious war, standing tall, armored and prepared, but mostly disallusioned and bored, as action sought is never found, and the blood of the enemy never tasted. Indeed, these Marines fill in the missing gaps of glory with their own personal triumphs and trauma, even firing rounds of ammunition into the empty desert night sky as closure to a war they hadn't entirely witnessed. There is almost nothing in ""Jarhead"", that hasn't been seen in other war movies, yet these stock wartime scenes and situations stand like pillar stones to a war secured before it even began by American manipulative control, (the same could not be said about the current Iraqui situation.). While there are several ugly conflict induced scenes in ""Jarhead"", the film does not bombard with the horrors of war, but instead, asks us to consider our current politically aggressive state, while preserving our regard for the soldiers committed to carrying out America's decisions. As one sharp-shooter in the film puts it, ""Let's leave politics out of it. We're here. That's what really matters."" And while ""Jarhead' doesn't particularly make you proud to be an American, it makes you proud of our American soldiers. The film has a glistening yellow napalm sky meeting white desert sand beauty to it, and performances by lead Jake Gyllenhaal, as your typical home town hero, who says he's a Marine because he got lost on his way to college, and Jamie Foxx, as a Bible-reading, god-spitting Staff Seargent regulation guy, are as strong and reserved as you could expect from a fighting Marine.

There are only two elements of this film that were worth bringing to an international audience.1) The ""Dear John"" letter board.  For whatever reason, especially confusing given the shortness of this war, there seemed to be a disproportionate number of breakups and divorces among Desert Storm participants.  Perhaps it just seemed that way from the inside, or because suddenly women were everywhere in a combat-zone for the first-time making it easier for soldiers to cheat (not a knock against female soldiers) or because without a draft there were so many eligible young men still left back in the states to cause trouble there.  Whatever the reason, even this important statement in Jarhead was as poorly underdone as a Herfy goat burger (inside joke).2) The other important element shown in this film was the frustration of waiting.  Sitting in the desert and keyed up for 5 months with no proper outlet or release.  Again, they missed their cue there.  I do not believe for a second that a Marine NCO would allow his recon unit on the edge of a battlefield to behave in such an undisciplined and coarse manner.  Especially in front of civilians and worse, reporters.  This stinks a little bit to much of the early stages of Heartbreak Ridge before the Gunny shows up.The main character/author is nothing short of a crybaby wimp.  His is not a personality that can be suppressed throughout Boot Camp, AIT, and TIS.  He should have never been in a warzone because he should never have been allowed to be a Marine.  The closest this guy should have gotten to the military is by working for the Air Force MWR (another inside joke).I see this movie as an insult to the Corps and the military at large.  Its timing was very suspect.  Its time of filming and release was during the early stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom, a war that is depicted by liberal Hollywood and the media as being very unpopular.  Touted and sold as a patriotic celebration of our military, its really just another example of how the left ""supports our troops"" but cutting their feet out from under them.",1,No reason for this movie,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2185,"['not', 'Marine', 'veteran', 'am', 'Gulf', 'War', 'veteran', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'elements', 'film', 'were', 'worth', 'bringing', 'international', 'audience.1', 'Dear', 'John', 'letter', 'board', 'reason', 'especially', 'confusing', 'given', 'shortness', 'war', 'seemed', 'be', 'disproportionate', 'number', 'breakups', 'divorces', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'participants', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'seemed', 'way', 'inside', 'suddenly', 'women', 'were', 'everywhere', 'combat-zone', 'first-time', 'making', 'easier', 'soldiers', 'cheat', 'not', 'knock', 'female', 'soldiers', 'draft', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'eligible', 'young', 'men', 'still', 'left', 'back', 'states', 'cause', 'trouble', 'there', 'Whatever', 'reason', 'even', 'important', 'statement', 'Jarhead', 'was', 'poorly', 'underdone', 'Herfy', 'goat', 'burger', 'joke', '.2', 'other', 'important', 'element', 'shown', 'film', 'was', 'frustration', 'waiting', 'Sitting', 'desert', 'keyed', 'up', '5', 'months', 'proper', 'outlet', 'release', 'Again', 'missed', 'cue', 'there', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'second', 'Marine', 'NCO', 'would', 'allow', 'recon', 'unit', 'edge', 'battlefield', 'behave', 'such', 'undisciplined', 'coarse', 'manner', 'Especially', 'front', 'civilians', 'worse', 'reporters', 'little', 'bit', 'much', 'early', 'stages', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'Gunny', 'up.The', 'main', 'character/author', 'nothing', 'short', 'crybaby', 'wimp', 'not', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'suppressed', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'AIT', 'TIS', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'warzone', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'be', 'Marine', 'closest', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'military', 'working', 'Air', 'Force', 'MWR', 'inside', 'joke', 'see', 'movie', 'insult', 'Corps', 'military', 'large', 'timing', 'was', 'very', 'suspect', 'time', 'filming', 'release', 'was', 'early', 'stages', 'Operation', 'Iraqi', 'Freedom', 'war', 'depicted', 'liberal', 'Hollywood', 'media', 'being', 'very', 'unpopular', 'Touted', 'sold', 'patriotic', 'celebration', 'military', 'really', 'just', 'example', 'how', 'left', 'troops', 'cutting', 'feet']",N/A

Pace,"[0, 0]","Jarhead is a funny kind of movie about a very funny kind of war--the Persian Gulf War, perhaps unique among major American wars for featuring virtually no infantry warfare.  Jarhead is at its best when it avoids well trodden tropes.  The boot camp sequence and, to a lesser extent, the combat sequences, are the weakest of the movie.  Thankfully, both are very brief (although fans of traditional war movies looking for more of the same should take note of that lack).So what fills out the movie?  Waiting.  Lots and lots of waiting (and hydration).  Just how marines deal with that waiting (in a desert, no less), is the primary subject of Jarhead.  It's much more entertaining than it might be, veering wildly between juvenile and profane humor and dark and disturbing drama.  The marines walking through a shadowy hellscape dotted with flaming oil wells is one of the more arresting visuals in cinema.  It suffers primarily from a willingness to resort to Hollywood clich&eacute;s: a trainee getting shot during training, the obligatory war crime,Based on an autobiography, Jarhead carries with it some of that same ego, unreliability (one scene is based on an infamous urban myth), and meta-humor (at one point the main character complains the soundtrack is playing Vietnam music).  Entirely from a single marine's POV, we get a personal view into his questionable sanity.The blu-ray is strangely lacking in features, including only audio commentaries by the director and by the screenwriter and author.

Rednecks, thugs, war pigs, and bloodthirsty criminals. Thats what hollywood wants you to believe your governments army is. Let me tell you from personal experience that the men that serve this country, whether they be marines, sailors, pilots, or regular army, are nothing like the characters in this movie. The shooting war during desert storm lasted all of 24 hours, 22 of those hours being air raids and shock and awe from above. Ground troops encountered mostly surrenduring troops. We are supposed to believe from this movie that desert storm was some sort of quagmire similiar to vietnam only condensed into about 4 hours. There were blatant lies in this movie and they popped up so often that i eventually had to dismiss this movie as accurate and simply look at it as an action flick. First off, drill sergeants in the marines are not allowed to have facial hair yet the one in the movie sports a stylish little pencil one. A drill instructor is tough, there is no denying that, but they never make personal allegations involving a recruits sexuality, nor are they permitted to harrass a single recruit and single them out. Oh and the hitting scene, complete BS. DI's cannot touch recruits. Not even a pat on the back. The branding scene is another myth that was put in the movie so as to show the marines as savages. I have spoken to several marines about this and they say the only ""initiation"" they recieved in a barracks was a nod hello. Similiar to Stanley Kubrick's movie, which im starting to think that this is a rip off of that film, Marines in combat are completely clueless and tend to have mental breakdowns not only during combat but during R&R. The marines in this movie have war flashbacks even when they havent been in combat. During battle they are shown as clueless and unable to function.

His book was bad enough. I remember reading it and, as a US Marine myself who ALSO served in Desert Storm, I thought in the back of my mind that it probably wouldn't be long until the Hollywood left came to this book to make it a movie.  Also, Swofford is the type of bottom-feeding traitor who would do just about anything for a buck, so it's no surprise there either.  But, I digress.This movie/book is an abomination.  Point blank and period.  It's not ""realistic"" in any sense other than, perhaps, the color of desert fatigues.  You want a real sense of life at USMCRD?  Go get a copy of ""THE D.I."" with Jack Webb. Or at least watch nothing past the first 30 minutes of ""Full Metal Jacket.""  Anything past that is garbage.  That's how it is, how it was for me at P.I. - can't say for my Hollywood Marine brothers in SD.  You want to REALLY get an idea?  Enlist.  Anything else and you're really selling the experience short, take my word.Desert Storm itself was nothing like this.  And coming from a Marine who still has brothers fighting in Iraq, I take this movie/book as a personal attack against all Marines.  It truly is, and always has been since Swofford wrote it.

What makes Jarhead stand out from all other war films is that there is seemingly no war going on for much of the duration of this film. Rather, it is a psychological journey inside the minds of marines who are simply waiting around for their chance to kill something...anything. So whether it be having scorpion death matches, an illegal hootch party or simply wacking off, the tone and tenor of the film never waivers. Its glaicial pacing is vital to preserving the tone of the film. So although, Jarhead is certainly not the best film about war ever made it is certainly unique and original. Sam Mendes continues to challenge the norm with his gutsy directorial choices and although this film is no American Beauty, it is still a fine addition to his resume. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job as Anthony Swofford, simple, brooding and understated. My only problem with Jarhead is it's resolution or lack thereof. It seems as though the author has chosen to sidestep the most vital issues of the Gulf War for fear of taking sides. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the author/director have actually gone out of their way to stradle the fence and it's disappointing but alas the good outweighs the bad here.

Munson,"[2, 2]","Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx star in this movie about the life of a marine and his journey through boot camp and into the fighting of the first Gulf War.  Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a twenty year old raw recruit who joined the Marines because, in his words, he got lost on the way to college.  Upon arriving in boot camp, Swoff witnesses some other Marines with a homemade USMC brand.  Soon, Swoff is corralled by the other Marines, thrown to the ground, and the brand is brought to his leg.  However, Swoff ends up passing out.  Upon waking, he realizes that he wasn't branded.  Troy (Peter Sasarsgaard) informs Swoff that he must earn the brand.  The two soon become friends.Jamie Foxx stars as Staff Sergeant Sykes, a career soldier who is in command of an eight-man sniper team.  There are four spotters and four shooters.  Swoff is chosen as a shooter, while Troy becomes Swoff's spotter.  The group trains endlessly until all the members of the team are experts at their craft.  During their training, the Iraqis invade Kuwait, and Swoff's unit is sent to the Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield.Upon arriving in the Gulf, the men find themselves with a little too much time on their hands.  Time is spent by writing letters or playing football.  In one instance, their football gets them into trouble, as Sgt. Sykes forces the men to put on their chemical warfare suits and play an entire game of football while members of the press look on.After being in the Gulf region for several months with no action besides their own training, the war finally began in January, 1991.  When the land campaign began, Swoff's unit was thrust into the fighting.  Swoff and Troy were chosen to take out two Iraqi soldiers who were in a control tower.  Making their way cautiously over the hot desert sand, they arrive at the perfect shooting site, 900 yards from their target.  Having been given clearance to shoot, Swoff prepares to pull the trigger on his sniper rifle.  However, just before he can shoot, another officer bursts through the door and informs Swoff and Troy that an airstrike is going to take out the tower.  Despite all of their training and time spent in the Gulf, Swoff never got to fire his rifle in anger.After the war, the group returned to the United States to many well-wishers who welcomed them home.  One poignant moment at the end of the movie shows a Vietnam vet jump into Swoff's company's bus and shake hands with the men while telling them that they did a great job.  One can sense that the Vietnam vet wished he would have received the same type of welcome twenty years earlier.  Swoff's war lasted 4 days and 4 hours.This is a very powerful movie.  It compares closely to Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Both movies were told through the eyes of a single soldier.  The accuracy of life in the desert is apparent throughout the movie, especially the parts where the soldiers are forced to deal with their boredom.  The battle scenes are authentic as well, including the massive wreckage caused by the A-10 ""Warthog"" tank busters against Iraqi vehicles.I recommend this movie.  The acting, especially by Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal, is very good, the combat sequences are realistic, and the story is compelling.  Watch this very good movie and experience life in the Marines during Operation Desert Storm through the eyes of a Marine sniper.",4,Operation Desert Storm Through One Marine's Eyes,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,3393,"['Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'star', 'movie', 'life', 'marine', 'journey', 'boot', 'camp', 'fighting', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'twenty', 'year', 'old', 'raw', 'recruit', 'who', 'joined', 'Marines', 'words', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'college', 'arriving', 'boot', 'camp', 'Swoff', 'other', 'Marines', 'homemade', 'USMC', 'brand', 'Soon', 'Swoff', 'corralled', 'other', 'Marines', 'thrown', 'ground', 'brand', 'brought', 'leg', 'However', 'Swoff', 'up', 'passing', 'out', 'waking', 'was', ""n't"", 'branded', 'Troy', 'Peter', 'Sasarsgaard', 'Swoff', 'must', 'earn', 'brand', 'two', 'soon', 'become', 'friends.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'stars', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Sykes', 'career', 'soldier', 'who', 'command', 'eight-man', 'sniper', 'team', 'are', 'four', 'spotters', 'four', 'shooters', 'Swoff', 'chosen', 'shooter', 'Troy', 'Swoff', 'spotter', 'group', 'endlessly', 'members', 'team', 'are', 'experts', 'craft', 'training', 'Iraqis', 'invade', 'Kuwait', 'Swoff', 'unit', 'sent', 'Gulf', 'part', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Shield.Upon', 'arriving', 'Gulf', 'men', 'find', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'Time', 'spent', 'writing', 'letters', 'playing', 'football', 'one', 'instance', 'football', 'trouble', 'Sgt', 'Sykes', 'men', 'put', 'chemical', 'warfare', 'suits', 'play', 'entire', 'game', 'football', 'members', 'press', 'look', 'on.After', 'being', 'Gulf', 'region', 'several', 'months', 'action', 'own', 'training', 'war', 'finally', 'began', 'January', '1991', 'When', 'land', 'campaign', 'began', 'Swoff', 'unit', 'was', 'thrust', 'fighting', 'Swoff', 'Troy', 'were', 'chosen', 'take', 'out', 'two', 'Iraqi', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'control', 'tower', 'Making', 'way', 'cautiously', 'hot', 'desert', 'sand', 'arrive', 'perfect', 'shooting', 'site', '900', 'yards', 'target', 'Having', 'been', 'given', 'clearance', 'shoot', 'Swoff', 'pull', 'trigger', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'However', 'just', 'can', 'shoot', 'officer', 'door', 'informs', 'Swoff', 'Troy', 'airstrike', 'going', 'take', 'out', 'tower', 'training', 'time', 'spent', 'Gulf', 'Swoff', 'never', 'got', 'fire', 'rifle', 'anger.After', 'war', 'group', 'returned', 'United', 'States', 'many', 'well-wishers', 'who', 'welcomed', 'home', 'One', 'poignant', 'moment', 'end', 'movie', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'jump', 'Swoff', 'company', 'bus', 'shake', 'hands', 'men', 'telling', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'same', 'type', 'welcome', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'Swoff', 'war', 'lasted', '4', 'days', '4', 'hours.This', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'closely', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'movies', 'were', 'told', 'eyes', 'single', 'soldier', 'accuracy', 'life', 'desert', 'apparent', 'movie', 'especially', 'parts', 'where', 'soldiers', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'boredom', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'authentic', 'well', 'including', 'massive', 'wreckage', 'caused', 'A-10', 'Warthog', 'tank', 'busters', 'Iraqi', 'vehicles.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'acting', 'especially', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'very', 'good', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'realistic', 'story', 'compelling', 'Watch', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'experience', 'life', 'Marines', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'eyes', 'Marine', 'sniper']",N/A

They mostly didn't like it because.......what they say again............ O yeah,because it had no message or stance. To that I say good. It was refreshing to see a movie as a movie. I was glad that it was just a story, and there wasn't any motivation underneath it. That's not to say that the movie is one dimensional. There are many undertones, just none of which are attempting to reassert or defame the current war in the East.As someone who is married into the military, I thought this movie was great. If you are looking for a message about war or politics you won't find it here. This movie is strictly a story told by the main character about his time serving in the Marine Corps and his tour in the Gulf. It is true to life. From the language, situations, to the way the characters interact, the film is right on with accuracy.The film's cinematography is nice. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are breathtaking. The shots are done perfectly and originally throughout while the score and soundtrack takes it to a powerful emotional level. the lack of warfare becomes a theme for this film.Peter Sarsgaard, in a great performance, reaches his breaking point during the final third of the film, and it's a riveting moment where the lack of warfare has finally made him explode. His performance is very strong throughout, but it is not until the second half of the film when he finally gets the chance to break loose. Don't mistake the first half of his performance as simply being on-screen... charisma that palpable doesn't happen by accident. It is because he uses his scenes and lines wisely in the first half that we end up so engrossed and fascinated by him in the second. A true supporting performance. Jamie Foxx surprised me here, and not because I didn't think he was a fine actor. Obviously, he is. But his character is so well-conceived, and works wonderfully as the counterpoint to the Gyllenhaal character. Jake maintain an incredible performance. Watch for a dozen scenes where he literally explodes off the screen, but how he also juggles the quieter moments with great aplomb. What makes Swofford an intriguing character is that he doesn't always get our sympathy; or, for that matter, want our sympathy.In summation, JARHEAD is a viscerally unforgiving, psychologically heartbreaking masterpiece.

963874,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B000DZIGDU,Jim&Yvonne,"[2, 4]","Jake Gyllenhall did a great job as his performance of a Marine sharp shooter.  However, the best part of this movie was the first five minutes where there was a ""Full Metal Jacket"" type boot camp scene.  Jamie Fox was pretty good, but a little underused as the Staff Sergeant later on in the movie.  This movie is about the progression of a man through Marine boot camp to sharp shooter school to the Gulf War and then nothing.  The first third of the movie was the progression, then the last 2/3rds was the Gulf War.  I felt this movie was more of a political statement based on the memoir of Anthony Swofford (book by the same name ""Jar Head.""  I felt as this was a story of a disgruntled employees rather than a people who understood what their presence there was actually for.  I did not read the book and will do so, so  I can get a better feeling of the memoir that this movie is based on.  However, the movie was about Marines going to a war that was not there.  As a result, they get bored, mess around in the sand, wonder why they are there (the oil theme again) and wait for their first kill.  However, I wonder if it came to it, if they got the opportunity that they could do it, get their first kill during war.  Though, the acting was good, the script was crap.  This movie is the equivalent of the landing at Normandy, but the rather than landing at Normandy, the folks landed at the Bahamas-But at least there would be plenty to drink if they landed at the Bahamas.  I don't doubt that the lack of action in this movie memoir took place, and they should feel lucky that they didn't have to go into harms way, however, I believe the lack of action was an isolated incident and during the first Gulf War was fought after all through technology (missiles, airplanes, etc.).  So all that did stay out of harms way while liberating a country from the grasp of human rights criminal Sadam, should feel lucky.  Then of course, the return from the war to lost girl friends and return to their boring ""regular"" lives and a feeling of  let down..  The movie was a liberal political statement as the left leading Hollywood continues to move that way.  However, it is odd that the director, Sam Mendes also directed Oscar winner ""American Beauty"" which was about an adult man's fascination with a high school teenager.  So, Hollywood thinks it is OK for sex with a minor (or close to it), but not to protect an invaded ally of this country.  How things change and too bad that Mr. Mendes did not have the magic that he did with ""American Beauty"" and Tom Hank's ""Road to Perdition.""

These Marines  are primed for action.

Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job as Swofford the author of the book, narrator & main character of the movie. Actually ""Swoff"" felt he had little choice. His father was a Marine whose life was screwed up by Vietnam, & his grandfather before that was also a Marine. So Swoff joined without a whole lot of conviction. They turned him into a sniper. Jamie Foxx is Sykes, Swoff's Sgt. & mentor. His mission in life is to keep his men alive. If he is not loved by his men he is respected & you'd want him to have your back. Basically, Jamie Foxx dominates every scene he is in. They all want action & desire to kill the enemy, including Swoff. Eventually war does come & Swoof is to get a chance to use the specialty he been trained for. At the last second, it is snatched away & hours later the war was over. I understood his frustration. Yet knowing he did not kill a man for any good reason might stay with him longer than his frustration. He never fires his weapon in war, his war, which he says lasted about four days, after half a year of inactivity in the desert.

Jake Gyllenhaal is a star, he deserves an Oscar. The second half is serious. Peter Sarsgaard is as reliable as ever: the star of Skeleton Key, the back up in Garden State, he really is a unique actor. It is an uneven film in the sense that in real life Marines are not this sanitised, sanitary and perfect. Real life they are not as physically well-built and charismatic. The typical male macho I could relate to it despite my SNAG Sensitive New Age Guys leanings. The film commented deep down males just like sex. But Jake's character crying as well as Peter's shows a vulnreable universal human empathy and emotion. See the irony. Men love women to be sex objects, the moment they commit infedility it tears them apart like a an estranged child losing a parent.

963882,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000DZIGDU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 9]","I hate war movies. I always have, always will. Having said that, I rarely watch war movies and have never seen such war movies as ""Apocolypse Now"" or ""Platoon"". The only reason I saw this movie was because I like Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes is an Oscar winning director (Best Director, American Beauty) and is fairly obscure. He's only directed three movies in 6 years. He carefully picks each film he does and this movie is no exception. The problem is, this movie has been unjustly billed as a war movie and it's not. It's the story of men at war in the Desert. But never do we see battle sequences portrayed in movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", or even ""Cold Mountain"". This movie is extremely entertaining, the performances are great, it's funny, and it's probably one of the biggest Oscar snubs of 2005. Hell, this movie is better than ""Capote"" and ""Good Night, And Good Luck"". Anyway, the movie is based on a memoir by Anthony Swofford, played here by Oscar nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, Brokeback Mountain). The movie opens with Swofford (or Swoff) in boot camp. The boot camp is instantly reminiscent of the one in ""Full Metal Jacket"" except R. Lee Ermey doesn't show up and make us laugh our a$$es off. The Boot Camp scenes are entertaining, but short lived. Swoff is transferred to the Camp Pendleton Marine Base where he meets Troy (Peter Sarsgaard, in another underappreciated performance), Kruger (Lucas Black, the kid with the weird accent from ""Sling Blade""), Fergus (Brian Heraghty), Fowler (Evan Jones, better known as Cheddar Bob from ""8 Mile"" who seems to be playing the miltary version of that character), and Staff Sargeant Sykes (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx). Eventually, Swoff and the other men mentioned are transferred to Iraq for Operation: Desert Shield. If you're expecting them to arrive in Iraq and begin shooting Iraqui's left and right, then this isn't your kind of movie. For some odd reason, that's why I like this movie so much. It's a war movie, without being a war movie. Besides the entertainment factors, there's also the political aspect of this film. It couldn't have came out at a better time. This movie takes place when George Bush Sr.was in office, but all the events in this movie could be taking place right now. When Bush Sr. was President, the troops were fighting in Iraq. Now, Bush Jr. is in office and the troops are fighting in Iraq. Do I see a pattern here? Anyway, as I said before this movie is also pretty damn funny. The showing of ""The Deer Hunter"" scene was hilarious, to me anyways, and the comment Fowler makes in the shower was pretty funny. All the performances are standout; Including Gylenhaal, Foxx, Sarsgaard, Black, and Jones in no particular order. The reason Oscar ignored this film was because it was overshadowed by movies like Capote, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain. Allthough the last two are better movies.

963883,AZ5WK99NSFNRV,B000DZIGDU,"Justin Maldonado ""JM""","[7, 9]","This motto of is uttered three time in the duration of Sam Mendes' brilliant war drama/comedy ""Jarhead.""When it comes to the war, we sometimes forget one of its major victims and how the are scared from its wrath-the soldiers. In Mendes film, he studies the impact of war on an American squadron of marines and there experiences in the Gulf War.Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhhal) is a recent enlistee who is ""hooked"" to the marine way of life. He is soon in Staff Sgt. Sykes' (Jaime Foxx) squad, and is given the position of sniper. His spotter, Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard, becomes his close buddy while training to make the final cut in Sykes' group.The men are soon shipped out to the desert in preparation for the forthcoming Gulf War. There in an unfamiliar place, with enemies they can't see, for a reason unknown to them.Mendes and his actors keep us absorbed in the lives of these characters and what they go through physically and mentally. Gyllenhhal proves he's truly capable of a strong leading performance. Foxx is terrific as the hard-ass Sykes. Sarsgaard is a powerful presence as always. Chris Cooper makes two nice appearances as Lt. Col. Kazinski. The supporting soldiers are all wonderful and effective.The film is beautifully shot, making the audiences feel hot and sticky, like the soldiers, just by watching those coarse, dry shots of the miles and miles of sand in the horizon.The film is funny in its first half, and hard hitting in its second. The comedy is to make the film go down easy with us, until we feel comfortable and connected with the characters and their lives. And that makes the second half heart tugging because we see the transformation and what war does to the lives of these young men. We are with them. We feel their pain. We see through their eyes the true tragedy of war on the human psyche.That motto up top is one I would never use to describe this film.

963884,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000DZIGDU,Kaya Savas,"[4, 6]","MOVIE: What if there was a movie that wasn't about war, but about the soldiers. Jarhead is exactly that, a film about the jarheads who went to war just to grab a gun and kill some Iraqis. That's pretty much what Jarhead is about. No battle, no gore, just guys finding themselves out in the desert. Unfortunetly the film lacks depth, it lacks substance. The audience doesn't grow with the characters, and there is nothing for the audience to work with. There is a scene in the beginning were Jake Gyllenhaal's character starts to narrate some events from his life. Then the camera moves out of the room and the door closes, and his character states that we the audience aren't allowed to see his past. Unfortunetly, by denying the audience the character's background, the characters appear static and then there is nothing to emotionally connect with. The only thing the film boasts is some amazing cinematography and decent acting, but they totally go to waste because of the the weak story. Almost everyone I know wanted to see Jarhead, and you can thank Universal for their brilliant (but deceptive) marketing campaign. The trailer was brilliantly put together while accompanied by ""Jesus Walks"" by Kanye West. What this did was appeal the movie to a wider audience. By having a rap song highlight your trailer you open to teens and the urban audience. The tv spots hit hard and fast with the song as well. I knew before I walked in what this movie was about, because I know Sam Mendes as a director and he doesn't do action. So, everyone had expectations for this gung ho war epic, and instead they got a character piece, and that's why alot of people were disssapointed. I was dissapointed because there was never a connection of the characters to the audience, and when there is an emotional distance from the audience to your characters that is never a good sign.ACTING: There is a lot of yelling in this movie, well, that's pretty much all there is. A bunch of young men sitting around in the desert just waiting to kill someone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job, not steller but good.  Jamie Foxx, who was advertised as a main selling point in the trailer, does an acceptable job too. The acting was acceptable, nothing more.BOTTOM LINE: The cinematography is brilliant, then again we come to expect that from a Sam Mendes film. Unfortunetly, while the film may be pretty to look at it's not interesting to watch. The characters are underdeveloped, and the movie doesn't do much with them.",3,"Brilliant Cinematography As Expected, But The Film Is Uninteresting Due To Lack Of Character Development",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,2496,"['MOVIE', 'What', 'was', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'war', 'soldiers', 'Jarhead', 'exactly', 'that', 'film', 'jarheads', 'who', 'went', 'war', 'just', 'grab', 'gun', 'kill', 'Iraqis', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Jarhead', 'about', 'battle', 'gore', 'just', 'guys', 'finding', 'out', 'desert', 'Unfortunetly', 'film', 'depth', 'substance', 'audience', ""n't"", 'grow', 'characters', 'nothing', 'audience', 'work', 'scene', 'beginning', 'were', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'narrate', 'events', 'life', 'Then', 'camera', 'room', 'door', 'closes', 'character', 'states', 'audience', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'see', 'past', 'Unfortunetly', 'denying', 'audience', 'character', 'background', 'characters', 'appear', 'static', 'then', 'nothing', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'decent', 'acting', 'totally', 'go', 'waste', 'weak', 'story', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'know', 'wanted', 'see', 'Jarhead', 'can', 'thank', 'Universal', 'brilliant', 'deceptive', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'trailer', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'put', 'together', 'accompanied', 'Jesus', 'Walks', 'Kanye', 'West', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'appeal', 'movie', 'wider', 'audience', 'having', 'rap', 'song', 'highlight', 'trailer', 'open', 'teens', 'urban', 'audience', 'tv', 'spots', 'hit', 'hard', 'fast', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'knew', 'walked', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'know', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'director', ""n't"", 'do', 'action', 'So', 'everyone', 'had', 'expectations', 'gung', 'war', 'epic', 'instead', 'got', 'character', 'piece', 'why', 'alot', 'people', 'were', 'disssapointed', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'was', 'never', 'connection', 'characters', 'audience', 'when', 'emotional', 'distance', 'audience', 'characters', 'never', 'good', 'sign.ACTING', 'lot', 'yelling', 'movie', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'bunch', 'young', 'men', 'sitting', 'around', 'desert', 'just', 'waiting', 'kill', 'someone', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'steller', 'good', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'was', 'advertised', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'trailer', 'acceptable', 'job', 'too', 'acting', 'was', 'acceptable', 'nothing', 'more.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'then', 'again', 'come', 'expect', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'film', 'Unfortunetly', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'pretty', 'look', 'not', 'interesting', 'watch', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'much']",N/A
963885,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000DZIGDU,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[42, 83]","I don't like to review movies I haven't finished watching yet, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Because this movie absolutely isn't worth starting, much less finishing.The movie is based on Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford's memoir of his tour of duty in Operation Desert Storm.  Not surprisingly, we get the whole story of Swoff's experience in the miltary from his own point of view.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except that as a viewpoint character, Swoff is biased, myopic, and pretty close to useless.I knew I was in for a bad journey when the movie began with a vision of the protagonist's boot camp.  We watch the ritualized humiliations and debasements Swoff undergoes at the hands of his unaccountably sadistic drill instructor (DI).  These humiliations are exaggerated beyond realism, a hoary old narrative device intended to make us sympathetic with the hero.  But this part of the movie is over in barely five minutes, much too short a time for us to even learn the characters' names, much less build any sympathy.But when the DI begins striking Swoff for no reason, culminating in smashing the kid's head into a chalk board for no reason other than that he can, this is a major strain on the willing suspension of disbelief.  It is strictly against regulation for DI's to strike or curse at recruits.  But I guess the creative team behind this film didn't trust you and me as the audience to sympathize with Swoff if his DI was merely hard-nosed and mean.  So they reach for crass, unmotivated violence to keep us hooked and steer us to the desired conclusion.This is just the first of many moments where this movie tries to duplicate the artistic success of Stanley Kubrick's vastly superior Vietnam film Full Metal Jacket.  But that movie gave us a much longer boot camp scene, so we felt like we were seeing an experience rather than being crudely manhandled.  And where Swoff is supposed to be an unaffected hero for us to care about, Kubrick's Private Joker was supposed to be an unreliable point-of-view character.  Kubrick trusted us to sort out his hero's biased viewpoint.  This movie doesn't trust us to remember the characters' names and relationships from one scene to the next.Like Private Joker, Swoff goes from boot camp to the war, though Swoff pauses for Advanced Individual Training.  In both AIT and the theatre of combat, Swoff stares at the world with a kind of wide-eyed wonder that makes Elijah Wood's Frodo look cynical by comparison.  Most notably, the bad treatment he receives at boot camp continues unabated.  Whether it's his thick-skulled battle buddies, his harsh platoon captain, or a dim journalist sent to his unit to cover the non-war of Operation Desert Shield, somebody is always doing him dirt somewhere.And crucially, Swoff is presented to us as a passive victim of this dirt.  With only one notable exception, nothing bad that happens to him is ever his fault.  He is not an actor, he is acted upon.  I can imagine making a movie with myself as the hero, in which everybody throws mud and spits on me for no good reason.  But come on, the only reason we ought to be interested in a character like this is because he's so perspicacious that he recognizes the part he plays in events, or else he's so self-centered that, like Private Joker, he has no idea how unreliable he actually is.  Swoff lacks the courage to be either of these; he just presents himself as helpless in the throes of forces over which he has no control or influence.The movie can't even decide how to reveal its characters to us.  At one point, all of a sudden and for no apparent reason, Swoff stops his squad mates on patrol and walks off to speak with some Bedouins they've spotted.  But as Swoff walks away, the camera stays with the squad.  We're left hanging for about two minutes without a point-of-view character, which means that, for about two minutes, the forward thrust of the narrative grinds to a halt.  And when Swoff returns, we find out he's been speaking to the Bedouins in their own language.  Swoff speaks Arabic?  Wow!  Prior to that moment, the movie had given us no reason to believe he knew anything at all beyond what the Army absolutely needed him to know.  If a character revelation like that is going to come out fairly late in the movie, it needs some prepared foundation.  Except, apparently, here.Perhaps, toward the end of the film, some event transpired to mitigate this tiresome drivel.  But when I looked at the counter on my DVD player and saw that I had been watching vor seventy-five minutes, and it felt like the movie was mired in a hypertrophic Act I from Hell, I stopped the disc.  I'd already lost more than an hour of my life to this pelf.  I went and read a book.

963886,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000DZIGDU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I knew from the start that ""Jarhead"" had the potential to be a polarizing film. Any time you address a contemporary and controversial political topic--you end up with reviews at both ends of that political spectrum. In other words, it's generally a love it or hate it proposition. It's either genius or its crap. After the film received decidedly mixed reviews upon its release, it's not something I rushed out to see. However, to my amazement, the film is surprisingly apolitical. It's a simple tale with a few observations about the nature of modern warfare, but no real message.I see most of the negative reviews posted here disparage the film because it's not a war film. True enough, but that doesn't complete negate the movie either. I do think that the film works as a character study, a slice of life. It was interesting to me how the expectations of what the experience would be like were thwarted with what this team actually encountered. The boredom, insecurity and need to feel a part of something important are a valid statement. After all, this was basically one guy's experience. And ""Jarhead"" is successful enough at showcasing that one element.Now, I will admit the talent associated with the film led me to believe that this would be an ""important"" film. It doesn't have the flair and audacity of ""Three Kings,"" for example. It's a more mundane story that shows a different aspect of battle, or lack thereof. It may not be what you're expecting--but that doesn't always make it bad. And it's definitely a well made picture with some amusing moments and some good performances.""Jarhead"" is a compelling study of a disaffected youth in a profession he questions.

963887,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000DZIGDU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 4]","Jarhead is neither a heroic, nor an entertaining war film.  Instead, Sam Mendes employs the ample cinematic brilliance that he also applied in his astonishing films American Beauty (1999) and Road to Perdition (2002).  The characters are far from perfect, as their imperfections emerge throughout the film.  The characters are not depicted as heroes, but like chauvinistic mindless brutes trained for one single purpose - to kill.  The title is also an allusion to this notion, as it refers in slang to Marines through their haircuts, but also the symbol of the head being a hollow container.  The story becomes a journey into a personal hell based on Anthony Swofford's book Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles that capture the indoctrination and transformation to murderous warriors that will serve orders faithfully.The first impression that Jarhead makes is much like a reproduction of several other war films such as Kubrick's brilliant Full Metal Jacket (1987), Stone's bloody Platoon (1986), and Coppola's surreal Apocalypse Now (1979) among many others.  Some of the film's uniqueness seems to suffer from the similarities of other cinematic experiences.  Yet, it is also where some of the films strengths rest, as most people only can relate to war through the movies.  Thus, through the audience's recognition of other war films Mendes reaches all viewers when he makes one of the closing arguments that ""Every war is different. Every war is the same.""A brief series of scenes portray some of the hard nose training that Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) had to endure, which included demeaning and cruel treatment.  It is some the methods that drill sergeants apply to bring out the hatred and anger needed for a cruel and merciless killing machine.  These images are put in the light of an introductory voice-over that echoes with the thoughtful notion that soldiers will never forget these murderous skills, as they will strive to reap the pleasures of life such as loving and nurturing.  It is obvious that Swofford truly hates it in the Marines, and sees the whole ordeal as a gigantic mistake, as he finds himself under a nasty drill instructor that tries to bring out the worst in him.Angry and troubled Swofford is shipped out to a new location where he meets his new unit, and is put under training as a scout sniper in the US Marine Corps. It is a rigorously harsh and difficult training lead by Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) whose job it is to weed out the weak.  Swofford finds the snipping business intriguing, and excels, as he becomes partner with Troy (Peter Sarsgaard).  Eventually the training comes to an end, and the first Gulf Conflict commences a short period after the training.  The idea of war makes all of the trigger-happy Marines cheerful that they are about to ship out to face the enemy that they have prepared for through the brutal training.The blissfulness of war soon ceases, as they learn that they will dig into defensive positions while awaiting the war. It is an extremely difficult time for the soldiers, as they find themselves isolated from civilization and the loved ones at home.  As the days run by Swofford and the other soldiers hydrate, eat, masturbate, train, or sleep. In between the daily routine, they find much time to think about life and death.  Swofford thinks about his girlfriend, and how much he wants to be with her.  Meanwhile, his buddies in desert camouflage makes fun of how much they also desire his girlfriend.  However, as the time goes by it becomes apparent through the letters that his girlfriend becomes restless and seeks new friendships.  It is when his insecurities begin a personal war on himself, a war that can drive a person mad.  In a sense, Mendes captures some of the same mystique that Malick's poetic The Thin Red Line (1998) posed, as his soldier desires to get away from the war and enjoy living life and all of its pleasures.As most people should know the war eventually starts, as Operation Desert Storm begins.  It also means that Swofford and his brothers-in-arms can finally do what they are trained to do.  However, it brings the audience through a surrealistic experience, especially when approaching the burning oil wells.  There is one scene where Swofford encounters an oil-drenched horse under the pitch-black sky covered in the sooty smoke.  The scene brings to mind Salvador Dali's painting The Burning Giraffe, which he painted to show his personal struggle with the war in Spain during the 1930s.  Swofford also seems to undergo some personal struggle, as he tries to keep his humanity intact around the death and darkness that surrounds him.Overall Jarhead presents a terrific cinematic experience.  The camerawork is extraordinary through some of its emotionally scaring imagery and its portrayal of the characters.  The lighting also feels scorching with its overwhelming whiteness in the desert day scenes.  Gyllenhaal's personification of Swofford accentuates the psychological war that often is undergone in each soldiers mind in a truthful manner, which also enhances the cinematic experience.  Many of the supporting cast also enhance the emotional predicament that Swofford experiences.  In addition, the small, but meaningful appearances by Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert also enhance the overall visual experience.  However, the story is not unique, as already mentioned, and this portion of the film, even though it serves the film well, has an impact on the cinematic experience.  Nonetheless, Jarhead presents a truly intriguing and worthwhile viewing.",4,Terrific Portrayal of the Personal Struggle Inside the US Marine Corps...,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,5610,"['Jarhead',

Swanson,"[6, 7]","Hate the war but love the soldier...or at least try to understand how good men can willingly be turned into killers who will shoot whatever they are told to.Jarhead seems to move back and forth between pointing out how the military is designed to create mindless, order-following killing machines, and then examining soldiers' frustration at not killing anyone. The scene with them cheering the battle scenes in Apocalypse Now is ironic in the extreme.The narrative moves well, even during the war-is-hellish-boredom parts. What lifts this film to a higher level are Gyllenhall's excellent performance (along with Foxx and most everyone else) and the stunning cinematography of the second half.The flaming oil fields and their resultant chaos are grippingly weird, making a strong but silent point about why we send our kids to die halfway around the world for the benefit of rich old men who don't give a damn about them. This film succeeds when it lets you get inside the heads of certain characters who have stopped thinking but can't stop feeling; it rarely judges the soldiers, instead showing their humanity and confusion when turned into automatons.My father was in the military, and he made me promise never to enlist, saying, ""Their goal was to make me stop thinking completely. If we thought about it, why would we want to kill fathers and brothers and sons who are just like us, but born somewhere else?""Thus the term ""jarhead""; the jar is emptied of Christian compassion for every one of God's children, and refilled with bloodlust.This is a much more subtle film in many ways, despite its graphic nature, than most reviewers here want to accept. The scene with the horse is absolutely perfect, saying so much with a simple, heart-breaking picture.Life isn't always ""you're with us or against us""; sometimes it's ""you're with us until we don't need you any more.""

963891,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000DZIGDU,LARRY,"[2, 4]","I'm not a fan of war movies.  However, I have to say that *Jarhead* was one of the best war movies, along with *Full Metal Jacket*, *Saving Private Ryan* and a few others.  It is true that *Jarhead* isn't truly a war action movie but it is still a good one to watch.*Jarhead* is an account of Tony Swofford's experiences as a Marine in pre-Desert Storm training as a sniper and the war.  Now, I've never read the book.  I didn't even know there was a book...not that I would read a war book.What I liked about *Jarhead* was that it covered aspects that are not usually covered in other war movies.  One aspect that got the biggest coverage was the fact that the soldiers' wives and girlfriends informed them that they were cheating with other men or divorcing.  It was interesting to see how these soldiers expected it as if it was one of the prices for joining the service and going to war.The other interesting part was seeing the young cocky men cheering and jeering while watching some war reels in a theatre room.  When they actually get sent to Kuwait, there's a complete change in their attitudes.  However, when boredom sets in after a time of inactivity, the cockiness resurfaces.There are so many aspects of the war in the movie.  You're gonna see some interesting punishments meted out.  You'll see some ""postal"" moments.  Of course, you'll see the guys bonding and getting on each other's nerves.  Testosterone is at an all-time high.Cinematography here is just really awesome but provocative and taunting as well.  These scenes were there to draw out emotions and reactions from you.  Overall, they'll tell you just how real war was and how high adrenaline and stress were running.  What's interesting is that the gore factor is low (for a war movie)...you're not gonna see blood and body parts flying everywhere.  However, you'll see charred bodies and a couple of other things.The one thing that I liked about this war movie was that it was able to maintain my interest/attention span.  There's so many going on that you're not stuck on one part for a long time.  Despite that there are a few war movies that I liked, I think that *Jarhead* would probably be the first (and only?) war movie that I wouldn't mind seeing again.",4,another good war movie...,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,2240,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'war', 'movies', 'However', 'have', 'say', '*Jarhead*', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', '*Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket*', '*Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan*', 'few', 'others', 'true', '*Jarhead*', ""n't"", 'truly', 'war', 'action', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'watch', '*Jarhead*', 'account', 'Tony', 'Swofford', 'experiences', 'Marine', 'pre-Desert', 'Storm', 'training', 'sniper', 'war', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'book', 'not', 'would', 'read', 'war', 'liked', '*Jarhead*', 'was', 'covered', 'aspects', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'covered', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'One', 'aspect', 'got', 'biggest', 'coverage', 'was', 'fact', 'soldiers', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'informed', 'were', 'cheating', 'other', 'men', 'divorcing', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'soldiers', 'expected', 'was', 'one', 'prices', 'joining', 'service', 'going', 'war.The', 'other', 'interesting', 'part', 'was', 'seeing', 'young', 'cocky', 'men', 'cheering', 'jeering', 'watching', 'war', 'reels', 'theatre', 'room', 'When', 'actually', 'get', 'sent', 'Kuwait', 'complete', 'change', 'attitudes', 'However', 'when', 'boredom', 'sets', 'time', 'inactivity', 'cockiness', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'war', 'movie', ""'re"", 'gon', 'see', 'interesting', 'punishments', 'meted', 'out', ""'ll"", 'see', 'postal', 'moments', 'course', ""'ll"", 'see', 'guys', 'bonding', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'Testosterone', 'all-time', 'high.Cinematography', 'here', 'just', 'really', 'awesome', 'provocative', 'taunting', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'were', 'there', 'draw', 'out', 'emotions', 'reactions', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'real', 'war', 'was', 'how', 'high', 'adrenaline', 'stress', 'were', 'running', 'What', 'interesting', 'gore', 'factor', 'low', 'war', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'see', 'blood', 'body', 'parts', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'However', ""'ll"", 'see', 'charred', 'bodies', 'couple', 'other', 'things.The', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'war', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'maintain', 'interest/attention', 'span', 'so', 'many', 'going', ""'re"", 'not', 'stuck', 'one', 'part', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'war', 'movies', 'liked', 'think', '*Jarhead*', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'only', 'war', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A

But yet I just couldn't quite imagine it as a film.  That's because there is very little action; it's all about what's going on in the young marine's mind.  But that was the nature of that war.  There was a lot of training, a lot of waiting, lots of boredom, and lots of reporters with microphones and videotape trying to find a story where there was none.  Maybe that's why one of the things I mostly remember from that war was the soldiers playing football in the sun while wearing  full chemical retardant gear.  And this was on a desert where the average temperature was about 112 degrees Fahrenheit.The film got poor reviews but I was still curious.  And that's why I made sure to see it.  I'm glad I did because I found it refreshing, a war movie was about one particular soldier with a voice-over narration of well chosen words.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of Brokeback Mountain fame, is the star.  His wears a  ""jarhead"" crew cut and a pensive expression most of the time.  We share his anticipation, his disappointments, and his realization that all his expectations have been wrong.  He and his fellow marines have been trained and trained and then over-trained by their sergeant, played by Jamie Foxx.  There is some great surreal cinematography of the unending desert and the landscape of the oil wells aflame while the soldiers do little but come across charred bodies.  There's no heroism and when Gyllenhaal and fellow marine, Peter Sarsgaard finally think they are going to use their sharpshooter skills, their hopes are shattered by a commanding officer who refuses to let them take that shot.There are different kinds of wars.

If this' an one man's view of his experience in the Marine Corps, its a pretty sad one at that.In Swofford's experiences, the US Marine Corps proves to be nothing more then but pronographic loving, lewd mannered sniveling jarheads who survived Operation Desert Storm only because their Iraqi enemies were even more weaker then they were. But this is one man's view and he wasn't a very happy Marine for sure. It pretty hard to called this a ""war movie"" since it really wasn't much of a war. The self-inflicted stress and trauma these Marines on screen suffered from were home sickness, boredom, losing their girlfriends and wives to guys at home and lack of enemies to kill. I am sure that the veterans of Vietnam, World War II and Korea wishes their stress and trauma were that terrible as well.The movie overall, however, appears to be well produced, directed and acted. Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job playing the main sniveler, Swofford. Swofford proves to be an interesting character because despite of all the whining he does on screen, he still tries to do his duty the best he can. Jaime Foxx also shine as well as Swofford's squad leader and the movie appears to be well supported by fine acting.However, if you watch...let say...Saving Private Ryan prior to watching this movie, you will probably feel a great deal of contempt toward the whining Marines of this movie.

I think Mendes should have payed attention to how Kubrick adapted the novel for his film.  The movie begins promisingly, but just keeps on reminding us of how close it is to Full Metal Jacket, with the hard drill instructor, the complete idiots in the corps, and the character stuck in the middle of it all.  Gyllenhaal does what he can with the script and I think he does a pretty good job of playing his part.  Most of the other characters are wholly forgettable, and even their stupid nicknames serves as another drawing point to Full Metal Jacket.  Peter Saarsgard, who is in every movie ever made these days, is also forgettable, but not as much as the other mediocre characters.  I would have liked to see more of Chris Cooper in this film, because having Cooper as a supporting actor automatically adds a better quality to a movie.  Cooper may be the best supporting actor of all time (see also: October Sky, Adaptation, Syriana).  Jamie Foxx seems to be drifting towards that category of actors who lost their career after winning an Academy Award (see also Cuba Gooding Jr.), but we'll have to see what his next project or two adds up to before we go jumping to conclusions.  There really is only one scene where he stands out (it's the one everyone saw in the trailer).

It mostly consists of a series of events strung together almost like vignettes. They hit all the usual training humiliations on the numbers, but once they are deployed, the sequence of the events is not particularly important for the most part and that element, along with the lead character's fantasizing, which is shown as daydreams that look just like reality but quirkier, make it all seem a little awkward and random. There are amazing visual moments, painful dramatic moments, pragmatic and plebian daily daily moments and great acting all the way through. I just found the lack of cohesion a little off-putting and the ending feels like something that was tacked on a year later: it's so distanced from the rest of the movie that I almost wished I'd shut the film off before that last act. They also don't push the daydreaming far enough--it's almost incidental and not used enough in either advancing the character or creating an escape for him, so it seems unneeded. Funny, but unneeded.

As one who greatly enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" and ""Enemy at the Gates"", I couldn't wait to see this thing.Flatout disliked it from the first unpleasant moments!  It just went down hill at great velocity as the focus seemed to be on how bad life is for this guy that seemed to be a suicidal candidate before he even arrived in the middle east.  The whole thing seemed to be some kind of psychological study of this one guy who mulls over the expected unfaithfulness of his girlfriend, and the necessity of attaining some kind of mindless state to survive in the military, which for him is depicted as a last, possible choice of a career.  I really am not sure what the final conclusions were for this ""mental study"", except that he is so disappointed when he didn't get to shoot somebody quick enough.Maybe I missed something in this show, but I don't think so.

It tells the story of a  young man who joins the marines, he's actually a bit disillusioned by the experience until he trains as a scout sniper and finds his calling. Like many soldiers he yearns for the chance to put his training to use and that opportunity comes when Kuwait is invaded and he is deployed as part of Desert Shield and ultimately  Desert Storm.If you're looking for an action film then this isn't the film you are looking for, however it is interesting look at the characters and interactions of a small unit. Like most modern war films it doesn't shy away from the horrors of war, although it doesn't do so in any real detail, it's covered only in glancing as something these marines see. One scene that did stand out for me was the burning of the oilfields, an oddly beautiful as well as a disturbing sight.For a character based film it's all down to the actors playing their roles and everyone does a good job here. They are all convincing as marines, but also as young men under the stresses of war and naturally of the relationships between the marines and those back in the world.There's also a fair spread of dark humour throughout the film, which helps balance some of the more morose moments.

963902,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000DZIGDU,Mel Odom,"[2, 5]","JARHEAD recounts author Anthony Swofford's personal journey through the First Iraqi War of the early 1990s.  Based on his bestselling book of the same name, the movie marches through his experiences from boot camp to the deserts of Iraq, from the uncertainty of being accepted by the Marines to losing his girlfriend to a ""Jody"" to the harsh realities of civilian losses strewn all around him.  The movie is a hard and unflinching look at that war, and at the men involved in it.Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) directed.  Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Swoff, the principal character, but it's Peter Sarsgaard's protrayal of Troy and Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense approach to Staff Sergeant Sykes that really steal the show.Although off to a rather rocky beginning, with the immediate comparison of Swoff's drill instructor to the one in FULL METAL JACKET, JARHEAD moves quickly into its own rhythm.  The narrative and pacing of the movie is extremely well done and becomes totally hypnotic.  I found myself watching with rapt attention.  Swoff became very real to me, as did Troy.  Jamie Foxx turned in a stellar portrayal of Staff Sergeant Sykes, showing a depth of acting that he isn't often given a chance to do.  He came across as hard, but in one-on-one moments with Swoff, he revealed the dichotomy inherent, I think, in most professional soldiers:  they love what they do, but they're appalled by it at the same time, and even more confused by their love of it.Despite the direction and the acting, though, the substance of the movie seems to be lacking.  The emotion doesn't exactly come out of nowhere at the end, but it definitely goes nowhere.  I know that this is how many of the soldiers felt at the end of that war, but I think it would have helped if we'd gotten to know the characters a little more deeply.  Troy was getting kicked out of the Marines, but why?  Peter Sarsgaard earned a lot of sympathy from me, but I still don't know what he lied about, or why the military felt compelled to kick him out after he was such a good Marine.  That lack of knowledge really hurt at the end of the movie.The HD DVD release offers extremely intense video presentation.  The images are clear and sharp, well-defined.  However, even though the sound separation is done well for surround sound systems, it isn't uncompressed.  With a killer soundtrack laying down the score, the high-def fans willing to buy an enriched product even if they'd already owned a copy of the movie should have gotten that enrichment all the way around.JARHEAD is definitely worth a look from military movie fans, but it's not something that's going to completely satisfy.  Perhaps guys who have actually been over there during the wars will get more out of it, but I just ended up with more questions.",3,"Hypnotic, But Lacking Substance",1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,2774,"['JARHEAD', 'recounts', 'author', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'personal', 'journey', 'First', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'early', '1990s', 'Based', 'bestselling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'experiences', 'boot', 'camp', 'deserts', 'Iraq', 'uncertainty', 'being', 'accepted', 'Marines', 'losing', 'girlfriend', 'Jody', 'harsh', 'realities', 'civilian', 'losses', 'strewn', 'movie', 'hard', 'unflinching', 'look', 'war', 'men', 'involved', 'it.Sam', 'Mendes', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'directed', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Swoff', 'principal', 'character', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'protrayal', 'Troy', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Sykes', 'really', 'steal', 'show.Although', 'rather', 'rocky', 'beginning', 'immediate', 'comparison', 'Swoff', 'drill', 'instructor', 'one', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'JACKET', 'JARHEAD', 'quickly', 'own', 'rhythm', 'narrative', 'pacing', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'totally', 'hypnotic', 'found', 'watching', 'rapt', 'attention', 'Swoff', 'became', 'very', 'real', 'did', 'Troy', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'turned', 'stellar', 'portrayal', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Sykes', 'showing', 'depth', 'acting', ""n't"", 'often', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'came', 'hard', 'one-on-one', 'moments', 'Swoff', 'revealed', 'dichotomy', 'inherent', 'think', 'most', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'love', 'what', 'do', ""'re"", 'appalled', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'love', 'it.Despite', 'direction', 'acting', 'though', 'substance', 'movie', 'be', 'lacking', 'emotion', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'come', 'nowhere', 'end', 'definitely', 'nowhere', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'soldiers', 'felt', 'end', 'war', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'helped', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'know', 'characters', 'little', 'more', 'deeply', 'Troy', 'was', 'getting', 'kicked', 'Marines', 'why', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'earned', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'lied', 'why', 'military', 'felt', 'compelled', 'kick', 'out', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'Marine', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'really', 'hurt', 'end', 'movie.The', 'HD', 'DVD', 'release', 'extremely', 'intense', 'video', 'presentation', 'images', 'are', 'clear', 'sharp', 'well-defined', 'However', 'even', 'sound', 'separation', 'done', 'well', 'surround', 'sound', 'systems', ""n't"", 'uncompressed', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'laying', 'down', 'score', 'high-def', 'fans', 'willing', 'buy', 'enriched', 'product', 'even', ""'d"", 'already', 'owned', 'copy', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'enrichment', 'way', 'around.JARHEAD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'military', 'movie', 'fans', 'not', 'something', 'going', 'completely', 'satisfy', 'Perhaps', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'there', 'wars', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'more', 'questions']",N/A

Both films have strong emotional centers and defined points-of-view both things that Mendes' latest does not.""Jarhead"" is about Anthony Swofford (a detached Jake Gyllenhaal) and his experiences training for/being in and living through Desert Storm. There are the requisite scenes of Marine camaraderie, tough drill sergeant stuff and basic guy-to guy humiliation. And these scenes are humorous at times and sometimes not.The problem with ""Jarhead""is that, at its core it is empty and more damaging...it is often boring. Once Swofford and his company arrive in the Middle East, it's a lot of waiting, more training and even more training. And when it finally dawns on us that there will be no actual combat...that Swofford will never actually aim and shoot his rifle at an enemy, we are more than ready for the ordeal to be over.Most of the performances lack energy and this we can only place on the shoulders of Mendes for Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx and the formidable Chris Cooper have been excellent elsewhere. The only palpable energy is generated by a showing, to the company of Marines, of the helicopters swooping down onto a Viet Nam village scene to the strains of the ""Ride of the Walkueres"" in Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"": an unfortunate reminder of how a war film should be made.Though beautiful to look at because of Roger Deakins's gorgeous, evocative camerawork, ""Jarhead"" is like a beautifully wrapped gift when, upon untying the bow, you find the box sadly and forlornly empty.",3,War is Hell,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1692,"['Sam', 'Mendes', 'made', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'very', 'fine', 'very', 'different', 'American', 'Beauty', 'evisceration', 'American', 'Society', 'Road', 'Perdition', ""30's-era"", 'film', 'family', 'fathers', 'revenge', 'films', 'have', 'strong', 'emotional', 'centers', 'defined', 'points-of-view', 'things', 'Mendes', 'latest', 'not', 'Jarhead', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'detached', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'experiences', 'training', 'for/being', 'living', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'are', 'requisite', 'scenes', 'Marine', 'camaraderie', 'tough', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'stuff', 'basic', 'guy-to', 'guy', 'humiliation', 'scenes', 'are', 'humorous', 'times', 'not.The', 'problem', 'Jarhead', 'core', 'empty', 'more', 'damaging', 'often', 'boring', 'Once', 'Swofford', 'company', 'arrive', 'Middle', 'East', 'lot', 'waiting', 'more', 'training', 'even', 'more', 'training', 'when', 'finally', 'will', 'be', 'actual', 'combat', 'Swofford', 'will', 'never', 'actually', 'aim', 'shoot', 'rifle', 'enemy', 'are', 'more', 'ready', 'ordeal', 'be', 'over.Most', 'performances', 'lack', 'energy', 'can', 'only', 'place', 'shoulders', 'Mendes', 'Gyllenhall', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'formidable', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'elsewhere', 'only', 'palpable', 'energy', 'generated', 'showing', 'company', 'Marines', 'helicopters', 'swooping', 'down', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'village', 'scene', 'strains', 'Ride', 'Walkueres', 'Coppola', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'unfortunate', 'reminder', 'how', 'war', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made.Though', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'gorgeous', 'evocative', 'camerawork', 'Jarhead', 'beautifully', 'wrapped', 'gift', 'when', 'untying', 'bow', 'find', 'box', 'sadly', 'forlornly', 'empty']",N/A

963907,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000DZIGDU,Michael Zuffa,"[0, 0]","""Jarhead"" is the true story of Anthony Swafford (Gyllenhaal) from basic training through the Gulf War.  Basic training is rough and reminiscent of the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Swafford emerges from the training as a sniper candidate, and becomes best friends with his spotter, Tony (Sarsgaard).  Sergeant Siek (Foxx) is their commander, and sees them as the best snipers of the group.  In 1990, Swafford's unit is sent to Iraq to participate in the Gulf War, but this war is not a war for snipers, and he soon finds himself ready to fight, but never allowed to.The unit is trained and trained and trained to be their very best, but there is no outlet for all their training, and soon that begins to take its toll.  They are soldiers who are unable to use the skills that they have, and sooner or later someone is going to snap.Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the baby faced Swafford, and is a definite candidate for an Oscar nomination.  Sarsgaard, who has been in a number of films this year, finally has found a role to really shine in.  Finally, Foxx is perfect as a true Marine that loves being a Marine.  ""Jarhead"" is an interesting war movie that really has little war in it.  Its focus is on the people that are there to fight the war, and what happens when the highly trained men are not allowed to do what they have been trained for.

963909,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000DZIGDU,mirasreviews,"[8, 14]","""Jarhead"" is based on Anthony Swofford's memoir ""Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles"" about his experiences as a Marine during the Untied States' first military action against Iraq, Operation Desert Storm. The book was considerably condensed and adapted for the screen by William Broyles, Jr., a former Marine himself who served in the Vietnam War. Corporal Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) narrates the film, beginning in boot camp, when he first questions the wisdom of joining the Marines. In training for the elite STA Platoon, where he will be a sniper, Swoff meets Corporal Alan Troy (Peter Saarsgard), who becomes his friend and mentor. Their platoon, under the command of Marine Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is among the first to be deployed in Operation Desert Shield after Iraq invades Kuwait. And so the wait for war begins. Hot, dehydrated, and always anxious about wives and girlfriends back home, the men get stir crazy wondering if they'll ever see any action.""Jarhead"" is an exploration of what it was like to be a Marine in a particular place and time. More than any other war movie I have seen, ""Jarhead"" conveys the tedium of war. Anthony Swofford's platoon saw little action, but what they did see is rendered so visually stunning that it makes a real impression. The fact that there isn't much action allows the film to concentrate on the personalities and relationships of the men of 2nd Platoon. That's not to say the film is dull; it is deftly paced to keep us interested. And the scenes of the Kuwaiti oil wells afire, raining black gold for miles and billowing toxic fumes, are worth the price of the movie alone. Jamie Foxx delivers another strong performance as a man who loves being a Marine, looks forward to a long career, and is sympathetic to the young men under his command but at the same time contrasted to them. ""Jarhead"" offers some insight into the Marines' lifestyle as well as the frustration of these men who were sent to wait idly to do their jobs and then thrust into a phantasmagory of desert and fire.The DVD (MCA 2006): Bonus features include 3 sets of deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch and 2 full audio commentaries. ""Swoff's Fantasies"" are 4 short deleted scenes. ""News Interviews in Full"" (16  min) are much longer versions of the press interviews that the Marines give in the movie. And there are 11 miscellaneous ""Deleted Scenes"". I didn't find much of interest in the deleted scenes, but the audio commentaries are good. The first audio commentary by director Sam Mendes is a detailed scene-by-scene ""who, what, and why"" of what was included in the film, what was left out, and how the film is structured. This is more about filmmaking than about themes. The second audio commentary is by author Anthony Swofford and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.  They talk about their mutual experiences in the military as it relates to the film, the film's characters, its structure, and condensing the book for the screen.

OOOOHHHH RAAAHHHH!!!Actually, the military isn't all that exciting.  Sure, there is the initiation....forgive me, bootcamp - most fraternities consider that pledging, or hazing - where you commit yourself 100% and are temporarily brainwashed into thinking that this organization that you're initiated into is the most important thing in the world....But then you get out of bootcamp, and your days are dominated by formations, classes, getting yelled at for no reason, and other service men and women finding different ways to spend their time.This movie was one of the BEST representations of that I have EVER seen.  Unless you're actually on the front lines during a war, you're stuck, bored, bonding with your colleagues (sorry, couldn't think of a better word).I found it completely believable that Jake's character had little to no battle experience.  I thought it was actually really refreshing to see some of the myths that I had heard as a military wife (the cookies and the video, for instance) come to light on the big screen.  I think, to me, the most important part of the movie was seeing them NOT get to shoot their target, and to miss out on the mission as snipers.  That, leading up to the first time they actually got to shoot their guns at the end of the film, I really think was important.

Gives us another masterpiece, with Jarhead, based on the gulf war novel written by Anthony Swoffword.In Jarhead, we see the making of a marine sniper from boot camp to the deserts of Kuwait. Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) lets you know right from the start that joining the suck wasn't the greatest of ideas. Swoff's experience at boot camp isn't much different then Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. In fact, it seems that the entire corp is fasnated with the way that the pop culture depicts them, as macho bad ass professional killers.When Gulf war begins, Swoff and his unit are deployed to defend the oil fields of Kuwait in opertaion desert shield. But, instead of crossing the broader and kicking ass, the marines find themselves doing nothing. It is here that Swoff must wrestle with the thoughts of loneiness and boredom. The fun comedic atmosphere of the movie is taken away as Swoff starts to worry what his girlfriend is doing with a ""jody"". To pass the time the marines bet on scorpian fights, writing letters, throwing parties, and masterbating (a lot!). Sgt Sykes often keeps the marines on their toes by forcing them to put on their MOBB gear despite the 123 degree temp. The football scene is probably one of the best in the movie. If your expecting to see a blackhawk down type of movie with non-stop action you will be let down. Swoff's story seems to be a story based on a man verses himself, rather then a man verses man. Swoff is very selfish. His main reasons for hating the corp is that it seperates him for his girlfriend and that its boring. So boring that he even ask a fellow marine to shoot him to ""end the waiting"". But Swoff also realize that for some people the suck means everything. ""I want to do anything to get out, you want to do anything to get in"" says Swoff to his friend Troy. Swoff begains to admire the comradery and friendship among his fellow marines. That once your a marine your always a marine. And that situtions like war seem to draw men closer to together in a common bond. A bond that includes the shamed Vietnam vets as well.Lucas Black who plays Kruger and Chris Cooper who plays Lt Col Kazinski are also pretty good. They seem to reinforce the typical marine sterotype. Kruger says some of the most dumbest if not funniest things in the movie.Finally this is not an ""anti war film."" Despite what some people who want to take advantage of certain situtions would say.

This is all the hallmarks of a great movie - great director, terrific acting, epic cinematography, relevant message. And yet without a real narrative to hang on, this is a movie about the atmosphere - in particular, the cumulative effect of atmosphere.  It will depend on the viewer if that atmosphere is enough to sustain interest.Jake Gyllenhaal is terrifically convincing as the nave young `average young man' who joins up instead of going to college.  His journey is the lynchpin of the movie, and he makes it work.  He starts off in the usual drill sergeant shouting at recruits type scenes, and finally gets to the Gulf.  There, the movie is about the waiting.  The boredom and frustration of being built up to act, and then sit on their heels unable to act..  Problem is, in convincingly conveying the boredom and frustration of the men, the viewer is equally bored and frustrated.  The war starts, and yet the frustration is never truly released for the group of marines, and in the final scenes the end is somewhat bleak to say the least.  The cream of the most macho soldiers are made to look impotent.This is a timely look at what some of the pressures must have been like - there are probably also parallels to be made with today's conflict, even though the situation is quite different.  As the lead says towards the end - Every war is different - and every war is the same.So is this enough to spend your two hours on the couch..?

Watching this film, you'd get the notion that our nation's best are whiney little cry babies with emotional issues more befitting spoiled societal gadflies who have a real desire to simply kill people. The manner in which our finest are depicted is, in my opinion, insulting and contrary to the actual Marines who defend our nation. I felt it was degrading of the Marines and resent the belittlement of those noble souls who stand the gap for us all.As for ""leftist"" as someone implied earlier on, that is simply a nonsensical statement. There was no moral issues involved, or whether the war is right or wrong, nor whether we ought to have sent troops to Iraq in defense of Kuwait. Instead, it seemed to depict the Marines as demeaning of women, sociopathic in their desire to attack something, and seemed to abdicate any notion of duty and honor among these men.Turning to the production itself, it was dull. Not your average, run-of-the-mill dull, but astoundingly and mindbogglingly dull.I like good dramatic films, and better if a message is conveyed in some way. Okay, so the waiting for something to happen was tedious for the Marines. Great. Peachy. It seems very unlikely that Marines would come unglued over it! The strain of waiting the Marines endured is matched by the strain of waiting for this movie to get interesting, which it really didn't.My standards are pretty light. I appreciate all manner of movies, so long as they prove entertaining. This one did not provide entertainment so much as an opportunity to wallow in tedium.Thus, I only give it two stars here.

963922,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B000DZIGDU,No one of consequence,"[2, 4]","I rented this one last night, expecting a typical war story.  What I got was something else entirely.  This is the movie adaptation of the autobiographical book of the same name by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Marines during the first Gulf War.  As a former military guy myself from that era, I was initially drawn into the story because I could relate to Swofford's introduction into military life at boot camp.  It was a scene familiar to anyone with armed forces experience.  Unfortunately, the movie went downhill from there.As the story traces Swofford's short military career through his garrison time and into Desert Shield, there remains an aura of credibility, although frankly some of the behavior depicted by the servicemen began to stretch the limits of what was believable based on what I knew of military life.  As Desert Shield drags on for months, the focus shifts to the emotional and psychological toll of wartime inactivity, which admittedly is more pronounced among sex-starved young men who know nothing but loneliness and boredom.  Even so, these scenes become exaggerated and even caricatured by the onset of the Desert Storm phase.Finally, the theme moves on to the futility and senselessness of war from the perspective of the average grunt on the ground.  Again, there was some familiarity here for one who had lived through eight years of often nonsensical and contradictory military culture.  However, some of the Marines' responses simply didn't jive with the reality of their circumstances, or reflect fairly on the immense professionalism that characterizes the modern U.S. military, both now and during the early 90s when this story takes place.Oddly enough, for a ""war movie"" this had almost no violence in it whatsoever.  It is much more of a character study and a psychological inquiry into the nature of young men trained to fight and kill.  It renders an indictment of high-level military leadership which, while true, is also one-sided.  In short, this story offers up heavy doses of both reality and exaggeration, and it is up to the viewer to try to sort out which is which.  For people with military experience that shouldn't be too hard, but others will likely walk away with a distorted view of our armed forces.",3,Not at all what I expected,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,2272,"['rented', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'expecting', 'typical', 'war', 'story', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'autobiographical', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'experiences', 'Marines', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'former', 'military', 'guy', 'era', 'was', 'initially', 'drawn', 'story', 'could', 'relate', 'Swofford', 'introduction', 'military', 'life', 'boot', 'camp', 'was', 'scene', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'armed', 'forces', 'experience', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'went', 'downhill', 'story', 'Swofford', 'short', 'military', 'career', 'garrison', 'time', 'Desert', 'Shield', 'aura', 'credibility', 'frankly', 'behavior', 'depicted', 'servicemen', 'began', 'stretch', 'limits', 'what', 'was', 'believable', 'based', 'what', 'knew', 'military', 'life', 'Desert', 'Shield', 'months', 'focus', 'shifts', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'toll', 'wartime', 'inactivity', 'admittedly', 'more', 'pronounced', 'sex-starved', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'loneliness', 'boredom', 'Even', 'so', 'scenes', 'become', 'exaggerated', 'even', 'caricatured', 'onset', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'phase.Finally', 'theme', 'futility', 'senselessness', 'war', 'perspective', 'average', 'grunt', 'ground', 'Again', 'was', 'familiarity', 'here', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'eight', 'years', 'often', 'nonsensical', 'contradictory', 'military', 'culture', 'However', 'Marines', 'responses', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'jive', 'reality', 'circumstances', 'reflect', 'fairly', 'immense', 'professionalism', 'modern', 'U.S.', 'military', 'now', 'early', '90s', 'when', 'story', 'place.Oddly', 'enough', 'war', 'movie', 'had', 'almost', 'violence', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'psychological', 'inquiry', 'nature', 'young', 'men', 'trained', 'fight', 'kill', 'indictment', 'high-level', 'military', 'leadership', 'true', 'also', 'one-sided', 'short', 'story', 'up', 'heavy', 'doses', 'reality', 'exaggeration', 'viewer', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'people', 'military', 'experience', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'others', 'will', 'likely', 'walk', 'away', 'distorted', 'view', 'armed', 'forces']",N/A

Jarhead is not so much a war movie as it is the adventures of a disgruntled worker with a very demanding job, its main focus is on the childish antics he plays on his fellow soldiers in cynical acts of rebelious superiority. This material is presented in the exact same way as Fight Club, right down to the cynical tone in the narraters voice. While sitting through all of this, I can not help but imagine a room full of movie executives deciding what film to rip off next for their latest investment. I can even hear one of the producers saying to the others in this board meeting, ""Why not copy Fight Club, it's made money for us before."" There is plenty opportunity for people to nit pick the inexactitude of military behavior and proceedure in this film, especially if their aim is to discredit the film for not representing Marine life or war as something highly sacred, but these very discretions are about the only real meat on the bones of this film, the rest is just a copy, of a copy, of a copy.",2,No guts no glory.,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,1405,"['Jarhead', 'few', 'things', 'offer', 'viewer', 'least', 'power', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'gung-ho', 'American', 'Patriot', 'types', 'Support', 'troops', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'back', 'cars', 'indeed', 'such', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'concider', 'depiction', 'Marines', 'cynisism', 'protagonist', 'be', 'down', 'right', 'disrespectful', 'not', 'flat', 'leftist', 'propoganda', 'niether', 'Jarhead', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'war', 'movie', 'adventures', 'disgruntled', 'worker', 'very', 'demanding', 'job', 'main', 'focus', 'childish', 'antics', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'cynical', 'acts', 'rebelious', 'superiority', 'material', 'presented', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'Fight', 'Club', 'right', 'down', 'cynical', 'tone', 'narraters', 'voice', 'sitting', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'imagine', 'room', 'full', 'movie', 'executives', 'deciding', 'what', 'film', 'rip', 'off', 'next', 'latest', 'investment', 'can', 'even', 'hear', 'one', 'producers', 'saying', 'others', 'board', 'meeting', 'Why', 'not', 'copy', 'Fight', 'Club', 'made', 'money', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'people', 'nit', 'pick', 'inexactitude', 'military', 'behavior', 'proceedure', 'film', 'especially', 'aim', 'discredit', 'film', 'not', 'representing', 'Marine', 'life', 'war', 'something', 'highly', 'sacred', 'very', 'discretions', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'meat', 'bones', 'film', 'rest', 'just', 'copy', 'copy', 'copy']",N/A

963928,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000DZIGDU,Peter Shermeta,"[8, 10]","I really enjoyed the performances by Peter Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even Jamie Foxx deserves credit for the work he did in Jarhead.I do not normally like Jake Gyllenhaal. It is not that I dislike him at all, in most of his roles I have simply found him unremarkable. He brought a passion to Jarhead that he has not had the ability to display in previous movies. He has come a long way since Bubble Boy.I like Peter Sarsgaard. I have liked him in pervious parts and I appreciate the complexity he brought to the character in Jarhead.Not too long ago I could be heard requesting the end of Jamie Foxx's 15 minutes of fame. More often than not he plays a relatively transparent character and he does little, if anything, to bring the parts to life. (Granted, I have not seen Ray, so I am speaking only of his other work.) If he continues to bring the maturity to future characters that he brought to Jarhead, I will gladly eat my words.I liked the way Jarhead, in a subtle fashion, portrayed different types of Marines. The movie primarily featured the enlisted son of a proud veteran, the cowboy Marine who can't wait to kill anything and everything, the man with the haunted past trying to lose himself in the Marines, and the firm-but-fair, almost fatherly, commanding officer. There were many other men and women who fought and participated bravely in the war, but these characters were the focus of the movie.I liked two main themes/symbols from the movie. I found it very interesting the way the movie suggests that soldiers are coached on how to address the press when expressing their opinions on the war. I also enjoyed the contrast in one of the final scenes as the veteran Marine joins the young men on the bus. This scene was brilliant in its awkwardness.(I was a little disappointed by how similar boot camp experience with the drill sergeant was to the beginning of Full Metal Jacket, but it may not bother you at all.)I approached Jarhead very objectively and found myself very pleased with the movie. I had no expectations, lofty or otherwise. I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was. The language and some subject matter may make the movie prohibitive to a younger audience, but I believe Jarhead is an important movie for the respect and appreciation of our armed forces.",4,Well acted.

It's not a soldiers-in-peacetime movie; either; it's about that period of ""hurry up and wait"" the we called Operation Desert Shield.Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a marine. No one, least of all him, knows why. (""I got lost on the way to college, sir!"") He survives boot camp and, after some training, ships off to the desert for Desert Shield, where there was little to do but play tricks on reporters, watch war movies, and slowly go insane. Swofford and his seven teammates do a lot of all three.Despite the fact that this movie is, basically, about nothing, it's very well done. Mendes brings in some of the out-of-touch-with-reality vibe that made American Beauty such a fun movie and combines it with a very, very wrong humor. It's all the insanity of Apocalypse Now-- a film to which it wears its debt naked on its sleeve-- without all the things blowing up. Gyllenhaal is supported by a fine cast of others, including Jamie Foxx (who's really come into his own as a dramatic player), Peter Sarsgaard, and Evan Jones, who looks more like Flea with each passing day.Fun, even-- especially, perhaps-- if you're not a fan of war movies. *** ?",4,Not your typical war movie.,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1319,"['Jarhead', 'Sam', 'Mendes', '2005', 'First', 'off', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'what', 'trailers', 'imply', 'Jarhead', 'not', 'typical', 'soldiers-in-wartime', 'movie', 'not', 'soldiers-in-peacetime', 'movie', 'period', 'hurry', 'up', 'wait', 'called', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Shield.Anthony', 'Swofford', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'marine', 'one', 'least', 'why', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'college', 'sir', 'boot', 'camp', 'training', 'desert', 'Desert', 'Shield', 'where', 'was', 'little', 'do', 'play', 'tricks', 'reporters', 'watch', 'war', 'movies', 'slowly', 'go', 'insane', 'Swofford', 'seven', 'teammates', 'do', 'lot', 'three.Despite', 'fact', 'movie', 'basically', 'nothing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Mendes', 'out-of-touch-with-reality', 'vibe', 'made', 'American', 'Beauty', 'fun', 'movie', 'combines', 'very', 'very', 'wrong', 'humor', 'insanity', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'film', 'debt', 'naked', 'sleeve', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'Gyllenhaal', 'supported', 'fine', 'cast', 'others', 'including', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'dramatic', 'player', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Evan', 'Jones', 'who', 'more', 'like', 'Flea', 'passing', 'day.Fun', 'even', 'especially', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'war', 'movies', '***']",N/A

This film has several problems that essentially will ruin it for almost any viewer.  There is virtually no plot, there is virtually no war, and the depiction in the film of the Marines does not cut the mustard in terms of accuracy or plausibility.With respect to plausibility--to take just one example, in the film a recruit dies in a live-fire exercise.  The drill sergeant curses up a storm, and things move on, apparently with no consequences.  What rubbish.  Anyone who has ever served knows that such events, rare but not unheard-of, involve huge consequences and the military (yes, including those tough Marines) take such events very seriously.  Generally losing a soldier or Marine under such circumstances is a career-ending move for the man in charge.  This flick implies that the Sarge went out for a beer afterwords and forgot about it.  Not likely.Another outrageous matter in this mediocre film was the notion that one Marine could (or would) pull a firearm on a fellow Marine.  Complete nonsense.  This would constitute, at a minimum, an assault under the UCMJ and would never be tolerated, not anywhere or anywhen.  A court-martial would be the inevitable outcome, probably ending with a bad-conduct discharge.The overall depiction of Marines was more or less a Hollywood stereotype.  Yes, combat troopers, whether Marines or Army, are loud, irreverent, and yes profane, but not to the idiotic extremes depicted in this film.  After awhile the endless (and they are endless in the movie) antics, yelling, and horseplay by the Marines starts to grate.I could have (barely) tolerated and forgiven the Hollywood stereotype of Marines if this film had had a decent plot.  Sorry, there pretty much is no plot.  I can handle the notion that the First Gulf War was 99% hurry-up-and-wait.  That is the gist of modern warfare, and probably most warfare going back to ancient Sparta.  But this is, after all, a movie with a presumed purpose of entertaining the viewer.

963937,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000DZIGDU,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 14]","""Jarhead"" is a war movie not really about war.  Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford, a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991.  The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training.  When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm.  For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.At no time does ""Jarhead"" pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time.  As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects.  Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war.  Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole.  The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act.  The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in ""Apocalypse Now;"" their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape.  The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find ""Jarhead"" a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie.",4,"impressive, thoughtful war drama",1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,2956,"['Jarhead', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'war', 'Rather', 'strange', 'time', 'war', 'when', 'young', 'men', 'boys', 'are', 'trained', 'kill', 'hesitation', 'remorse', 'when', 'group-think', 'group', 'cohesion', 'become', 'goal', 'soldier', 'when', 'boredom', 'tedium', 'waiting', 'enemy', 'strike', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'unnerving', 'unbearable', 'horrors', 'war', 'itself.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'Marine', 'sniper', 'who', 'served', 'Gulf', 'War', '1991', 'story', '1989', 'Anthony', 'undergoing', 'grueling', 'rigors', 'boot', 'camp', 'training', 'When', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Kuwait', 'Anthony', 'shipped', 'Middle', 'East', 'part', 'operation', 'known', 'Desert', 'Shield', 'soon', 'become', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'Anthony', 'fellow', 'Marine', 'sharpshooters', 'waiting', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'endurable', 'aspect', 'assignment', 'battle', 'discomforts', 'life', 'Arabian', 'Desert', 'often', 'time', 'Jarhead', 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'story', 'one', 'particular', 'soldier', 'one', 'particular', 'war', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'Anthony', 'supposed', 'be', 'representative', 'Marines', 'given', 'time', 'such', 'movie', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'heavy-handed', 'moralizing', 'preaching', 'glorify', 'denigrate', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'subjects', 'Instead', 'life-sized', 'realistic', 'showing', 'how', 'ordinary', 'men', 'cope', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'being', 'Marine', 'times', 'peace', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'war', 'Writer', 'William', 'Broyles', 'Jr.', 'moment', 'count', 'major', 'characters', 'confronts', 'sort', 'personal', 'demon', 'Broyles', 'never', 'issues', 'indulges', 'cheap', 'theatrics', 'hyperbole', 'men', 'remain', 'complex', 'real', 'character', 'drawing', 'strength', 'weakness', 'him.Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'scale', 'intimate', 'story', 'tightly', 'focused', 'interplay', 'men', 'reserving', 'most', 'actual', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'filled', 'memorable', 'moments', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'often', 'border', 'surrealistic', 'boys', 'achieving', 'near-orgasmic', 'frenzy', 'watching', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'stumbling', 'endless', 'rows', 'burned-out', 'vehicles', 'filled', 'charred', 'corpses', 'fleeing', 'civilians', 'oil', 'set-afire', 'wells', 'raining', 'down', 'ink-black', 'clouds', 'turning', 'day', 'night', 'covering', 'earth', 'thick', 'coating', 'sludge', 'ooze', 'oil-drenched', 'horse', 'mysteriously', 'emerging', 'nowhere', 'only', 'disappear', 'back', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'ruined', 'darkened', 'landscape', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'imagery', 'alone.Those', 'seeking', 'traditional', 'war', 'film', 'one', 'heavily', 'booming', 'artillery', 'graphic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'may', 'find', 'Jarhead', 'bit', 'slow', 'go', 'times', 'mood', 'film', 'personal', 'relationships', 'set', 'military', 'context', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'celebrate', 'movie']",N/A
963938,A2UR0J92JAR2TW,B000DZIGDU,"Roman Martel ""R. Martel""","[2, 5]","This movie falls on my list of unusual war films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Thin Red Line"".  I enjoyed both of those films, and I think it's safe to say that if you enjoyed both of those ""Jarhead"" is worth checking out.Visually this film is astounding.  The cinematography captures beautiful desert vistas, the horror of burning oil fields and black rain, and the endless flow of time.  Costumes, special effects and sound effects are also top notch, putting you in the period and in war itself.  I also enjoyed the music selections from the early 90's.  Not only did they fit the scenes, but they brought me back to those years.  The score was also noteworthy creating a kind of dreamlike ambient mood (much like the score from ""The Thin Red Line"")The acting was excellent all around.  Jake Gyllenhaal has a difficult part, creating a soldier who has been trained to kill, and is not allowed to do his job.  Gyllenhaal lets his anger seethe, and boil under the surface.  We can almost taste his frustration, and feel bad for him.  At the same time he's a frightening figure; his intense need to kill almost coming across as psychotic.  Peter Sarsgaard is always good, bringing more depth to parts that seem to be surface only.  He gives Troy added dimensions.  His confrontation with the Major at the end of the film is expected and yet explosive at the same time.  Jamie Foxx turns in a good performance.  His part is by the book, but his charisma and skill make it memorable.  The supporting cast measures up just as well; but in the end this is Gyllenhaal's movie.The script and direction are what will make or break this movie for viewers.  If you go in expecting a traditional war film, with plenty of action and heroics, you'll end up disappointed.  This movie takes a very personal view of a unique aspect of modern war.  It's a character study more than a war film.  It is more thematic than plot centric.  The theme is about frustration and boredom.  It takes guts to make a film about these topics, and Sam Mendes does the best he can.  In the end ""Jarhead"" is an excellent film, but not an enjoyable one.  It takes the right frame of mind to get into it and absorb it.  Those looking for action thrills will be disappointed.  Those looking for a meditation on one man's experience of the Gulf War will be rewarded.",5,Can a war movie about boredom and frustration not leave the viewer bored and frustrated?,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2330,"['movie', 'list', 'unusual', 'war', 'films', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Jarhead', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.Visually', 'film', 'astounding', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'vistas', 'horror', 'burning', 'oil', 'fields', 'black', 'rain', 'endless', 'flow', 'time', 'Costumes', 'special', 'effects', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'putting', 'period', 'war', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'selections', 'early', '90', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'fit', 'scenes', 'brought', 'back', 'years', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'creating', 'kind', 'dreamlike', 'ambient', 'mood', 'much', 'score', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'around', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'difficult', 'part', 'creating', 'soldier', 'who', 'been', 'trained', 'kill', 'not', 'allowed', 'do', 'job', 'Gyllenhaal', 'anger', 'seethe', 'boil', 'surface', 'can', 'almost', 'taste', 'frustration', 'feel', 'bad', 'same', 'time', 'frightening', 'figure', 'intense', 'need', 'kill', 'almost', 'coming', 'psychotic', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'always', 'good', 'bringing', 'more', 'depth', 'parts', 'seem', 'be', 'surface', 'only', 'Troy', 'added', 'dimensions', 'confrontation', 'Major', 'end', 'film', 'expected', 'yet', 'explosive', 'same', 'time', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'good', 'performance', 'part', 'book', 'charisma', 'skill', 'make', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'up', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'Gyllenhaal', 'movie.The', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'movie', 'viewers', 'go', 'expecting', 'traditional', 'war', 'film', 'plenty', 'action', 'heroics', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'very', 'personal', 'view', 'unique', 'aspect', 'modern', 'war', 'character', 'study', 'more', 'war', 'film', 'more', 'thematic', 'plot', 'centric', 'theme', 'frustration', 'boredom', 'guts', 'make', 'film', 'topics', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'best', 'can', 'end', 'Jarhead', 'excellent', 'film', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'get', 'absorb', 'looking', 'action', 'thrills', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'looking', 'meditation', 'one', 'man', 'experience', 'Gulf', 'War', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded']",N/A
963939,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000DZIGDU,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[4, 5]","Before seeing this film, I'd read Anthony Swofford's Desert Storm memoir, ""Jarhead,"" and found it moving, thoughtful, compelling, funny, and beautifully written. The performances and the photography in the film go a long way to capturing the time and place of Swofford's story and portraying the particular culture that is specific to the U.S. Marines. But overall, I found that it paled significantly by comparison with the book.The commentaries on this DVD and the many deleted scenes are a lesson in what happens when a book-length narrative gets squeezed like toothpaste into 90 minutes of linear movie storytelling. Interesting complexities get oversimplified, and film's literal immediacy minimizes more truthful ambiguities. What's missing in this film, for instance, is that Swofford's book is a 30-year-old's memory of himself as a 20-year-old. Those ten years make a big difference in the way he tells his story and what he chooses to tell us. He also interweaves many more threads and connects many more dots for readers.More mystifying is the wish of the filmmakers (as explained in the commentaries) to make the character of Swofford's friend Troy more ambiguous by withholding information about him. Their friendship is central to the book, yet the film makes a puzzle out of it. At the end, the film doesn't even tell us what has happened to him.See the film, if you keep in mind that it asks us to settle for a lot less than what Swofford originally wrote. This doesn't make it a bad movie, just a reminder of what the printed word can achieve in the hands of a fine writer.

963944,A3FNZQU6KBXWLM,B000DZIGDU,Scott Delo,"[2, 2]","I went into this expecting something else and now I'm glad I didn't get what I expected. From the previews, you would think this to be a gulf war version of such films as Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, with young men scarred by horrible visions of combat and violence. In the end, they are changed but as the protagonist says, ""I didn't get to fire a single shot.""Jarhead is the story of Anthony Swofford, a disenfranchised youth who enlists in the Marines because he doesn't have anything better to do and because he wants to measure up to his old man who served in Viet Nam. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford with all of the ennui that the role requires. The movie takes him through basic training, into area specific training (he's a scout sniper) and into action in the first gulf war. I actually enjoyed more the acting of Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx. Sarsgaard does a better job than Gyllenhaal of conveying the sense of loss and disillusionment that followed the first gulf war. From the previews, I expected Foxx's character to be a stereotypical gung ho marine sergeant but by the end of the film you realize how much he cares about the men under him. Most of us probably don't realize how many good men like him we have in our military.If you see a parallel to Full Metal Jacket, that appears to be intentional. The filmmakers want us to understand that it is films like that which make men want to go off to war in the first place. I found it difficult to feel sorry for the marines for not getting the chance to shoot and get shot at.

A co-worker told me that this movie was a comedy...there was nothing comedic about this movie after the first 20 minutes. This was a solid, realistic look at how a soldier goes into the military.  It shows how they are broken down and built back up, the mind games the superiors play to get them to follow their commands, the manipulation involved in 9/11, the REAL point of the war (read: gas), how the soldiers had to survive in the desert, and how their relationships were tested in the process.  The branding scenes were a little too much for my eyes, but I thought this was an excellent movie.  The main character in this movie did a great job at playing a decent guy who just needed to learn how the military REALLY works and Jamie Foxx did a great job too.  This was a really, really good movie.  A couple of slow scenes happened during the bombing, but I loved the underlying meaning.

It dwells upon the rigors of Marine basic training, the sadistic drill sergeants, the lack of freedom men have as soldiers and many other negative aspects of soldier life. It also seems to paint every wife and girlfriend of a Marine as a cheating tramp.There were not many people in the theatre when I went to see this movie. Now I know why. Not only is this movie insulting to our soldiers, it is down right boring. I strain to remember a ""war"" movie which shows less action than Jarhead. It is very simular to the movie ""Full Metal Jacket,"" in that both movies emphasize upon US Marine training, and only devote a few minutes at the very end to actual combat. Jarhead, however, has no combat depicted whatsoever. The characters witness one bombing.There is little in the way of characterization.

963951,A33CKZ1FZGYXZO,B000DZIGDU,Theodore,"[7, 12]","I have seen this movie twice so far, and was enthralled for every second each time.  I never agree with the hyperbolic ravings of critics, but I have to say that Gene Shalit's comment (to be found on the cover of the collector's edition DVD) that ""Jarhead is more than a movie - it's an experience"" couldn't be more true.  A word of advice before I start talking about the movie, SEE IT IN THE THEATRES, not at home.Jarhead made me feel like no other movie ever has - it drops you in among the soldiers and you feel genuinely surrounded by them.  This is no doubt due to the unique perspective from which the story is told.  Through Swofford's first-hand account of his and his unit's experiences during the Gulf War, you see a very different side of what you would normally witness in movies dealing with war.You hear Marine Corps jargon being bandied around, you witness initiation tricks/rituals, see enlistees in training/drills, and witness how Swofford and his buddies evolved from enlistees into Scout Snipers.  The training Jamie Foxx's Staff Sgt. Sikes puts Swofford and his buddies through is especially interesting and sometimes funny to watch.  The football in the NBC suits followed by the ""FIELD F___!!!"" had me in stitches.  That is part of what makes this movie's funniness unique - it is the Marines' own brand of humor - you hear them insulting each other via spouses, girlfriends, or simply due to appearance.  A dark form of humor emerges from frustrated, bored and angry mental state that many of the men appear to experience - who sometimes lose it completely.  At one point, Swofford pushes the barrel of his loaded M16-A2 into a friend's face and then, screaming, holds it up to his own face, begging to be shot.  In another scene, Swofford's buddy Troy breaks down when he is told not to take the shot on a target - his would-be first kill after months of waiting, training and sweating in the Saudi desert.This movie is at times funny (very much so) as well as shocking, sad and mesmerising.  The cinematography is breathtaking, especially the scenes after the fire wells have been set alight by the retreating Iraqis.While Jake Gyllenhaal is great as Anthony Swofford, Jamie Foxx, in my opnion, steals the show.  A man of multiple and admirable talents, Foxx portrays his character effortlessly.  Jamie Foxx is hilarious at times, while as serious as can be at others.  His charater's articulateness and Foxx's expression of emotion portrays Foxx's Staff Sgt. Sikes as an intelligent man and a true altruist, ""I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps; ooh-rah.""As many will know, this is not an action movie, and that is what makes it so great.  (Spoiler in following sentence) The only action we witness is that of friendly fire, and all other hostilities are simply distant off-screen noises (except for a brief scene in which mortars fired by an invisible enemy land around Swofford's unit's position).  As mentioned before, I would strongly urge you to see this movie in the theatres as opposed to DVD.  (Spoiler in following sentence)  There are certain scenes which will just not be the same on your TV: the scene where one of Swofford's buddies exclaims ""Hey, the oil fields"" and the camera jostles over the shoulder of a soldier to reveal plooms of infernos topped with thick black smoke in the distance, or when, on patrol, two USAF bombers roar (and I mean roar - it was defeaning and the ground in the theatre literally shook) overhead, bombing the Marine units in friendly fire.The music is also phenomenal in this movie.  I have ordered the soundtrack but it hasn't arrived yet, so I can't comment specifically - but I can say that Thomas Newman's score was truly noticable in the movie, and complemented it perfectly; he's a true genius.No doubt this movie will overshadowed at the Oscars by Gyllenhaal's lesser movie of '05, which is certain to sweep everything for obvious reasons, but it's the Oscars - since when do the deserving win (think Lord of the Rings)?I can't express how great this movie was, on so many levels.  It showed a different side of war, and dropped you right in with the men on the ground in doing so.  It showed the bonds that developed between the soldiers, and the camaradeie that held them together.  Jamie Foxx is - as always - outstanding, and deserves Best Supporting Actor for his performance.  My love of this movie may have led to this review to be a bunch of unstructured and unexplained praise, but I can't begin to express how great an experience Jarhead was.And, an afterthought; ignore any idiot - critic or not - who says that this movie is 'gung-ho' or 'pro-war propaganda' etc.  I'm a proudly staunch Democrat when I say that this is Swofford's PERSONAL ACCOUNT of the Gulf War; he's presenting the views and actions of his fellow-soldiers in this movie - not exploring or discussing broader political themes.  Swofford has recorded his personal account of the war, and that of the members his unit - it would've been amoral to let an attempted political commentary overshadow the movie, and that is precisely what he didn't do.  This movie is not discussing politics, or the Middle East, it's a personal record of a war, and anyone who states otherwise has missed the point completely.I want to applaud Anthony Swofford for recording his experiences so vividly and humorously, and Sam Mendes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast for portraying Swofford's account so well (on all levels), and Thomas Newman for adding a layer of atmosphere that would've been lacking, had he not been part of this masterpiece.",5,A Truly Phenomenal Movie,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,5619,"['have', 'seen', 'movie',

I personally liked the acting and how Jamie Foxx once again shined in a movie plus Jake Gyllenhaal showed he can act in almost any role convincingly. [Although I don't think I should remind any of you about Bubble Boy] This is one story about a man who joined the army, suffers some intensive training, and whose war lasts a mere four days and doesn't even have a chance to fire his rifle.Anthony Swoff [Gyllenhaal] is a young man who joins the Marines back in the first Gulf War. He leaves behind a young girlfriend to become a sniper, one of the best the Marines have to offer. He is joined by Staff Seargant Sykes [Jamie Foxx] who is a no nonsense, ""Marine for life"" man who wants no bullsh*t from anyone and is as tough as he is passionate about being a Marine.After surviving live fire obstacle courses, scouting and learning how to judge distances with nothing more than the knowledge of the lengths of football fields, and even having to play musical instruments looking like a fool in front of his fellow marines with nothing more than his vocal cords, Swoff survives and becomes a sniper. A few weeks later the war starts and Swoff is sent off to prepare for an attack in Iraq.What was one unique aspect of the movie was seeing how different numbers of troops in the war steadily grew as another day passed. In the beginning it said, ""Time in desert - 14 minutes. Troops in desert - 5,000."" Then 3 months later it would say, ""Time in desert - 93 days. Troops in desert - 100,000."" Meanwhile Swoff and his friends are left to camp in their base with nothing more to do than talk about anything and everthing to keep from being bored.Whether it's talking about every girlfriend they ever had, to talking about different religions they believe in, and even holding a fighting ring for wild scorpions they caught, the marines desperately wait for the chance to get the word to head into fighing.This movie shows mostly the horrors about war including after finally getting the word to go into Iraq, Swoff and his men find a bombed out area of cars and bodies of people while patrolling along the deserts. There is even a tense moment after an altercation with several men on camels who can't be indentified as hostiles or not.This is one movie that you should definately check out if you want to see great acting as each character shines in their own way. Plus there is a great bonfire party scene after the men get the word that they are going home and everyone fires their guns into the air.Extras of the DVD:Deleted scenesShowing the interviews shown in the movie in their entiretyplus subtitles and more!Definately rent this to check out. I'm not going to highly recommend this movie because I don't want you wasting your money and thinking you should have bought ""Black Hawk Down"" or something.

963953,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B000DZIGDU,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 5]","Director: Sam MendesCast:  Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lo Ming, Lucas Black, Kevin Foster, Brian Geraghty, Chris Cooper.Running Time: 123 minutesRated R for Rated R for pervasive language, some violent images and strong sexual content.Jarhead, as many people know, is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, largely to even his own surprise, finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he ""took a wrong turn on the way to college."" His explanation doesn't go over well. Later, he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps. Eventually, between the friendship and support of his partner, Allen Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the tough example set by his commander, Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swoff becomes very, very good at his new job: a scout sniper. Needless to say, when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.  The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there, and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills, and the boredom, anxiety, heat, and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear. The men, of course, find some very creative (and usually very naughty) ways to entertain themselves and each other during this time. But when war is at last declared, they move out like the professionals they've been trained to be.  In the midst of burning oil wells and charred vehicle convoys, Swoff and his company make their way into enemy territory. They endure enemy fire and fear; fights amongst themselves and utter despair. And then, as suddenly as it began, the war is over. But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience (his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days), he and everyone else is changed by their experiences, and not all of those changes are easy to live with.""Jarhead"" gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such, it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits, some creatively managed flashbacks, and some astounding settings (the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome; the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving). Of course, the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real, or at least was.  Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed, and holds his own with Oscar(tm)-winner Jamie Foxx, whose performance could very well garner him another awards-season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific.  ""Jarhead"" isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action, but it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurry-up-and-wait that is the reality for many soldiers.  That the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do, and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them, is unquestionably honored here.  Not quite up to the quality of director Sam Mendes's ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"", but with his first three films, he has solidified himself as one of the most aggressive, intelligent, and thought-provoking filmmakers out there.",4,Jarhead (2005),1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,3948,"['Director', 'Sam', 'MendesCast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Scott', 'MacDonald', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Lo', 'Ming', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Kevin', 'Foster', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Chris', 'Cooper.Running', 'Time', '123', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'Rated', 'R', 'pervasive', 'language', 'violent', 'images', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content.Jarhead', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'slang', 'term', 'US', 'Marine', 'One', 'newly', 'minted', 'jarheads', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'largely', 'even', 'own', 'surprise', 'enduring', 'rigors', 'basic', 'training', 'then', 'still', 'more', 'brutal', 'training', 'assigned', 'specialty', 'Swoff', 'one', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'Marines', 'only', 'took', 'wrong', 'turn', 'way', 'college', 'explanation', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'well', 'Later', 'everything', 'can', 'think', 'drum', 'Corps', 'Eventually', 'friendship', 'support', 'partner', 'Allen', 'Troy', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'tough', 'example', 'set', 'commander', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Sykes', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Swoff', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'new', 'job', 'scout', 'sniper', 'Needless', 'say', 'when', 'news', 'breaks', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'invaded', 'Kuwait', 'Swoff', 'group', 'one', 'first', 'be', 'sent', 'overseas', 'troops', 'are', 'welcomed', 'desert', 'Lt.', 'Col', 'Kazinski', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'large', 'segment', 'Marines', 'deployed', 'there', 'who', 'tells', 'must', 'maintain', 'constant', 'vigilance', 'be', 'ready', 'fight', 'moment', 'notice', 'months', 'go', 'nothing', 'do', 'drills', 'more', 'drills', 'boredom', 'anxiety', 'heat', 'desolation', 'circumstances', 'begin', 'wear', 'men', 'course', 'find', 'very', 'creative', 'usually', 'very', 'naughty', 'ways', 'entertain', 'other', 'time', 'when', 'war', 'last', 'declared', 'move', 'professionals', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trained', 'be', 'midst', 'burning', 'oil', 'wells', 'charred', 'vehicle', 'convoys', 'Swoff', 'company', 'make', 'way', 'enemy', 'territory', 'endure', 'enemy', 'fire', 'fear', 'fights', 'amongst', 'utter', 'despair', 'then', 'as', 'suddenly', 'began', 'war', 'brevity', 'Swoff', 'experience', 'own', 'fighting', 'war', 'only', 'little', 'four', 'days', 'everyone', 'else', 'changed', 'experiences', 'not', 'changes', 'are', 'easy', 'live', 'Jarhead', 'firsthand', 'experience', 'one', 'soldier', 'Gulf', 'War', 'attendant', 'good', 'bad', 'moments', 'such', 'fascinating', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'added', 'dramatically', 'story', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'edits', 'creatively', 'managed', 'flashbacks', 'astounding', 'settings', 'burning', 'oil', 'wells', 'are', 'bizarrely', 'heart', 'breaking', 'even', 'depiction', 'screen', 'awesome', 'destruction', 'wreaked', 'American', 'bombs', 'graphic', 'moving', 'course', 'fact', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'real', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'own', 'experiences', 'Gulf', 'War', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'back', 'minds', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'real', 'least', 'was', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'become', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'indeed', 'own', 'Oscar', 'tm', '-winner', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'garner', 'awards-season', 'nod', 'supporting', 'role', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'also', 'just', 'terrific', 'Jarhead', ""n't"", 'war', 'movie', 'se', 'sense', 'lot', 'shoot', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'war', 'movies', 'actually', 'graphically', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'hurry-up-and-wait', 'reality', 'many', 'soldiers', 'men', 'perform', 'so', 'well', 'emotional', 'obstacles', 'where', 'are', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'do', ""'re"", 'cohesive', 'group', 'when', 'matter', 'flaws', 'unquestionably', 'honored', 'here', 'Not', 'quite', 'quality', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'solidified', 'one', 'most', 'aggressive', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'filmmakers', 'there']",N/A
963954,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000DZIGDU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[88, 172]","Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Proof"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"") is quickly assigned to C Company upon his arrival at the Marine base. Entering the barracks, he finds other Marines struggling to use a homemade USMC brand on a guy's leg. After they finish, they move on to Swoff. Struggling, he passes out as the brand approaches his flesh. When he wakes up, Troy (Peter Saarsgard) explains that he has to earn the brand; the whole thing was a show, for his benefit. Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) picks Swoff and Troy for sniper duty and they begin to train and bond. Shortly after they finish training, Operation Desert Shield begins and they ship out to Saudi Arabia. Eager for action, they quickly become bored sitting in the desert, waiting for some guns to go off.Director Sam Mendes' follow-up to ""American Beauty"", ""Jarhead"" is a film with high expectations that it ultimately fails to meet. It wants to be the next ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Platoon"" but lacks the key ingredients to get there.A friend told me that she saw the film as well and liked it because it really captured the experience of going to war, ready to defend the country, and then sitting around waiting for something to happen. She was in the Army for a while and can attest to the accuracy of that part of the film. I can't.What I can do is evaluate if the film works from a narrative and dramatic point of view. It does and it doesn't.The film quickly and efficiently establishes Swoff through a series of brief flashbacks and some voice over narration. We learn that Swoff had a screwed up childhood, but we don't really understand why he would join the Marines. His dad was in Vietnam and we quickly learn that this screwed up his family life. So why would that make Swoff interested in joining the military? It would seem to accomplish just the opposite.Once he arrives at the Marine base, the film becomes a series of scenes that we have seen in other, better films about the military; the abusive drill sergeant, the humiliation of a new recruit, the hard training. After the film moves to the desert, we meet Swoff's buddies in more detail. Again, characters from other, better war films; the joker, the earnest guy who wears glasses and listens to tapes from his family, the family man excited about the birth of his new child, the two Latino men who fight over the differences between their cultures.  ""Jarhead"" can't really be faulted for including these, because we expect that they will be here. And these scenes are done well. They just don't offer anything new.Once they set out for the desert, the film begins to push the envelope a little, introducing some elements that we haven't seen before. Mendes manages to convey what it was like to sit in the desert and wait, and wait, and wait. But what about this would make it interesting or compelling to an audience? The characters. And this is where the film falls short. Swoff has to deal with the same feelings that all of the men in his company have to deal with. They begin to suspect that their girlfriends and wives are cheating on them which leads Swoff to begin to suspect his relationship with the `girl back home', as he pays daily visits to a bulletin board covered with pictures of the cheating spouses.  One day, she sends the t-shirt featured prominently in a sexy photo back to him. So we get that. We get that he is jealous and unsure of his relationship and unhappy. What we don't get is the reason why he starts to act crazy. It's almost as though there is a scene missing in the development of this trait. One moment, he is bored and anxious about his relationship. The next he's buying homemade alcohol and dancing around wearing nothing but two Santa caps, one of which is on his head.There is also supposed to be a relationship between Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Saarsgard), the two central characters, we are supposed to live this experience through them. Troy is Swoff's buddy, confident and partner, the guy who `has his back'. In one scene, Troy helps Swoff deal with an issue, but that is about it. There is a scene, late in the film, which is supposed to be the `grand moving moment', showing us how important their relationship has become. It comes off as hollow and formulaic.All of the production's physical elements are there. The cinematography is beautiful and evocative. The setting is perfect. The editing is great. There are small artistic flourishes throughout that add to the story, without detracting from it. But the narrative elements are lacking.In addition to a lack of character development, the film doesn't really take a stance for or against the war. In one scene, Swoff and all of his buddies are watching ""Apocalypse Now"", cheering when the helicopters begin to attack the small village on the beach. I'm sure this is the message Coppola intended for this scene, for this film. In another scene, Kruger (Lucas Black, ""Sling Blade"", ""Friday Night Lights""), one of Swoff's tent mates, begins talking about how the war is being fought for oil, etc. The message is mixed, or non-existent. Why is this important? Because if the film doesn't take a stand, one way or another, why should we even watch the film?To see the relationship between the characters? It is superficial, at best. So, no.To watch the great action scenes and/ or battles. Not here. Sorry.To watch the acting. Maybe. But it isn't enough to warrant a full price ticket.",3,Operation Mediocrity,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,5433,"['Swoff', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Proof', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'quickly', 'assigned', 'C',

963955,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000DZIGDU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 3]","Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford served in Gulf War One, and then came home to write about it. His gripping book, ""Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles,"" was quickly optioned to be a movie. Where the book captures the fleeting explosions of adrenaline that briefly hits you between countless days of tedium, the film version really loads up the tedium.Really, this uninspiring true-life take on being a soldier may be the most honest take on war ever filmed. There are no heroics. No moments of raging brilliance to stop an enemy. Just hot sweaty men in a desert, scared as hell and maybe bored beyond it. What that translates to is tedious viewing. War is the long stretches of nothing between battles, and these long stretches form the majority of ""Jarhead."" If you're looking for ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon"" or even ""The Boys of Company C,"" you're not getting any of that here. ""Swoff"" spends his entire stay in Desert Shield to Desert Storm wondering when he will finally get the chance to use his elite sniper training to make his first kill. The kill that never comes.""Jarhead"" comes closest to mimicking the superior ""Full Metal Jacket"" in that the drollness of Swofford matches Private Joker in Kubrick's film. But ""Jarhead"" has no payoff. Theirs is a place where no point of view ever happens...what politics there are in the movie will come strictly from your own point of view. The film itself is visually stunning, I doubt if the scene where oil rains down on Swoff's unit in the night, the desert lit only from flaming oil wells will easily be forgotten, or the horrific ""highways of death"" recreation.

And when they're not partying or hazing each other, these guys are stoked about killing the enemy.

When they come home after the war is over, they're faux heroes.Gyllenhall has been lighting up the screen since ""October Sky,"" but I was actually most impressed by Peter Sarsgaard this time.

963961,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000DZIGDU,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 28]","Sam Mendes' account of the Gulf War, based on the memoirs of the same title, is as hollow and empty as his much overrated `American Beauty.' By the word `hollow' I am not trying to describe its content or story which avoids the clich&eacute;s of the war films. The biggest and fatal flaw is that the sneering attitudes of `Jarhead' about the characters it describes.You don't need any minute summery of the film. It is about one soldier's look on the war, which could be different from the other soldiers', or could be just the same. Though I haven't read the book, it is clear that the film thinks it important to keep the touch of the first-person account of the Gulf War written by former Marine Anthony Swofford. At least I thought so in the first half of the film, which is devoted to the descriptions of the marines' boring and almost aimless life in the desert, just waiting for the war. Well, I have never been in the Marines, but it looks real.But as the film goes on, I started to doubt. I do not hate the film because few things happen in the film (because that is exactly the point of the film). On the contrary, too many things happen in it, all of which attempt to give an emphasis upon the emptiness of the war and the life of the Marines. If marines would hate the film because of the negative images of them with crude and immature behaviors, it is understandable. You would keep thinking, either amused or disguised, ""Is this reality?"" You never know, because this is after all the first-person account, but the film's real problem lies behind that.In spite of the strong acting (I agree reluctantly) from Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, the characters in the film look like amalgam of many exaggerated traits of the Marines. Look at Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) the `spotter,' who can keep cool at various trying experiences in the desert, but suddenly blows it at the moment when he is denied one thing - killing. Look at Staff Sgt, Sykes (Jamie Foxx), mouthy stereotype who suddenly speaks (briefly, as usual) of his background before the burning oil well. Mendes means something profound in these scenes, but what we see is typical war film formula that could have been more effectively done with better hands like Samuel Fuller who really went to war. And behind all of the negative images you can see the sneer of the director who really doesn't believe in anything, who doesn't care the characters even if they are based on t the real-life people.But after all, what kind of film, whether it is about war or suburbia, can we expect from Sam Mendes, who is a master of cynicism? It is beautifully shot cynicism, but cynicism never believes in anything good in humans. And it is always afraid of finding some merit in what it is sneering at.",2,"War without Battle, Film without Heart: War Film with Very Cynical View on the Marines or Anything",1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2755,"['Sam', 'Mendes', 'account', 'Gulf', 'War', 'based', 'memoirs', 'same', 'title', 'hollow', 'empty', 'much', 'overrated', 'American', 'Beauty', 'word', 'hollow', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'describe', 'content', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'war', 'films', 'biggest', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'sneering', 'attitudes', 'Jarhead', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'minute', 'summery', 'film', 'one', 'soldier', 'look', 'war', 'could', 'be', 'different', 'other', 'soldiers', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'same', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'clear', 'film', 'important', 'keep', 'touch', 'first-person', 'account', 'Gulf', 'War', 'written', 'former', 'Marine', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'least', 'thought', 'so', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'descriptions', 'marines', 'boring', 'almost', 'aimless', 'life', 'desert', 'just', 'waiting', 'war', 'Well', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Marines', 'film', 'started', 'doubt', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'film', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'exactly', 'point', 'film', 'contrary', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'attempt', 'give', 'emphasis', 'emptiness', 'war', 'life', 'Marines', 'marines', 'would', 'hate', 'film', 'negative', 'images', 'crude', 'immature', 'behaviors', 'understandable', 'would', 'keep', 'thinking', 'amused', 'disguised', 'reality', 'never', 'know', 'first-person', 'account', 'film', 'real', 'problem', 'that.In', 'spite', 'strong', 'acting', 'agree', 'reluctantly', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Swofford', 'characters', 'film', 'look', 'amalgam', 'many', 'exaggerated', 'traits', 'Marines', 'Look', 'Troy', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'spotter', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'cool', 'various', 'trying', 'experiences', 'desert', 'suddenly', 'moment', 'when', 'denied', 'one', 'thing', 'killing', 'Look', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'Sykes', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'mouthy', 'stereotype', 'who', 'suddenly', 'briefly', 'usual', 'background', 'burning', 'oil', 'well', 'Mendes', 'something', 'profound', 'scenes', 'what', 'see', 'typical', 'war', 'film', 'formula', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effectively', 'done', 'better', 'hands', 'Samuel', 'Fuller', 'who', 'really', 'went', 'war', 'negative', 'images', 'can', 'see', 'sneer', 'director', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'are', 'based', 'real-life', 'people.But', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'war', 'suburbia', 'can', 'expect', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'who', 'master', 'cynicism', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'cynicism', 'cynicism', 'never', 'anything', 'good', 'humans', 'always', 'afraid', 'finding', 'merit', 'what', 'sneering']",N/A

963965,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000DZIGDU,Utah Blaine,"[3, 3]","The production team had a great idea with this film, but in the end they didn't quite succeed.  In my view, the goal of this film was to create a war film that lies somewhere in between the antiwar documdramas like `Born on the 4th of July' and the gung-ho type stories such as `Saving Private Ryan' or even earlier war movies (like John Wayne films).  The image of military service and the reality are two very different things.  Some find that they take to the military life quite easily, but for others, it is tedious and unfulfilling.  It is this last aspect of military service that is presented in this film.  We follow the main character through basic training, through scout sniper school and into the desert as part of Operation Desert Shield after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Several mind numbing months later, they are ready to go to war, march into Kuwait, and the war is over before it started without anyone having fired a single shot in anger.  Everyone is left with the feeling that their perseverance was, in the end, a complete waste of time and energy.This movie is obviously based on the book by the same name.  I've never read the book, but I've been told that there are important differences.  The drill sergeant at the beginning of the film who physically abuses the recruits is subsequently discharged.  This important detail is left out of the film and really changes the impression.  The whole basic training scene is poorly (and unfairly) done in my opinion.  Doesn't hold a candle to R. Lee Ermey's performance in `Full Metal Jacket', and in any case, they should have balanced it out somewhat by showing the transformation in the Marines after the Crucible.  One thing emphasized in the book that isn't as fully developed in the film (but really is the key point) is the notion that many (although not all) young Marines want to leave the service as quickly as possible.  Some enjoy their military service, but for many (most?), it is really a mind numbing duty that they want to put behind them as quickly as possible.  I think this is particularly true for someone with a reasonably active intellect.  That being said that, I wonder if Swofford (the author of the book and main character in the movie) actually regrets enlisting?  I wonder if he asks himself how he would feel today if he didn't enlist?In the end, I think that the idea of creating a nuanced film that described the mind numbing boredom of much of military service was a good idea, but this film really didn't deliver the goods.  Throughout history, young men have been making foolish, ill informed decisions.  Military service is clearly vital to our national interest.  Many will go into the military and have a good experience, many won't have a good experience.  That's pretty much like everything in life.  There are no guarantees.

It is important to note that this movie is NOT attempting to make a statement about warfare - neither for nor against it, and it is not providing a commentary on the current situation in Iraq. Instead, Jarhead puts a movie camera in front of a Marine platoon and then lets the viewer decide for himself or herself.Through Swafford (played by Jake Gyllenhall) and other characters, we are given a glimpse on the emotional toll that life in the armed forces takes on recruits. Being thrown into the midst of a war complicates matters ten times worse. Emotions range from excitement, brotherhood, fear, anger, and alienation. I appreciated the fact that the film tried to get this point across to the viewers.Gyllenhall gives a great performance as Swafford, but the star who steals the movie is Jamie Foxx who plays Sargeant Sykes, a Los Angeles native who values the corps more than he values his own life.The movie may not have too many scenes of action, but there is plenty of drama and emotion nonetheless. This is a movie that is definitely worth seeing, but be forewarned...there is a fairly large amount of sexual humor, nudity, and masturbation in this film (as odd as that might sound).",4,"""I thank God for every day I have in the Corps...""",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,1335,"['Jarhead', 'based', 'autobiography', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'Anthony', 'Swafford', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'claimed', 'be', 'important', 'note', 'movie', 'NOT', 'attempting', 'make', 'statement', 'warfare', 'neither', 'not', 'providing', 'commentary', 'current', 'situation', 'Iraq', 'Instead', 'Jarhead', 'movie', 'camera', 'front', 'Marine', 'platoon', 'then', 'viewer', 'decide', 'herself.Through', 'Swafford', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'emotional', 'toll', 'life', 'armed', 'forces', 'recruits', 'Being', 'thrown', 'midst', 'war', 'matters', 'ten', 'times', 'worse', 'Emotions', 'range', 'excitement', 'brotherhood', 'fear', 'anger', 'alienation', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'film', 'tried', 'get', 'point', 'viewers.Gyllenhall', 'great', 'performance', 'Swafford', 'star', 'who', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'Sargeant', 'Sykes', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'native', 'who', 'corps', 'more', 'own', 'life.The', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'action', 'plenty', 'drama', 'emotion', 'nonetheless', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'be', 'forewarned', 'fairly', 'large', 'amount', 'sexual', 'humor', 'nudity', 'masturbation', 'film', 'as', 'odd', 'might', 'sound']",N/A

I wasn't sure why the bond between Swofford and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) was so strong. I wasn't sure why Staff Sgt.

Honestly, much of the camera work is mesmerizing despite it obviously being some of Roger Deakins' least inspired work: raining oil, ""bleeding earth,"" camels and natives in the distance, blurred shots of men in gas masks playing foot ball, etc. The image of a horse galloping up to Swofford covered in oil against a background of fire and dark sky seemed to be straight from ""Apocalypse Now."" Still, it doesn't add much. Honestly, how much does the actual package matter when what's inside is plain and emotionally uninvolving. Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"" had the same problem.

That is not to say that it can yet be elevated to that lofty status, but that it captures and evokes the time with brutal cynicism mixed with a taste for the surreal in a similar way to Copola's masterpiece. In many ways it also resembles Full Metal Jacket, beginning as it does in the training camp with the anonomous 'jarheads' being put through the paces by a tyrannical drill sergeant. Where it surpasses Kubrick's vision is its ability to translate the process of dehumanisation onto the battle field engagingly, albeit with a more contextual message.Mendes's Jarheads are mere ordinance in a technological war. Trudging across the desert they encounter the burnt-out convoys hit by US laser-guided bombs, its victims anonymous, probably civillian. Their's is a modern war where the enemy is unclear, where the battle is won from the air, and their experience is defined by their never having shot their rifles. It deals with a generation of disenfranchised young men brought up to believe in American superiority but who never had to fight to achieve it. Many will leave unable to consider themselves a hero in a country obsessed by heroism, and some are left, finally, in despair at the seeming futility of it. Having been moulded into testosterone-fuelled, unthinking (hence 'Jarhead'), killing-machines, the war for many of them is one of boredom and frustration.Where the film is really elevated is in its highly stylised vision of the desert, unrelentingly oppressive in stark, unflinching white. Its use of contemporaneous music is also clever, even if one character comments that they don't even have music to define their age in the same way that Vietnam did. Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' accompanies a terrifying dream sequence where Swofford goes to be sick in the mess hall sink, but unleashes a torrent of sand instead of vomit. Equally brilliant is the marines offloading their munitions into the sky to Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power' in an archly symbolic vision of end of the war celebrations. There are many entirely cinematic conceits such as Gyllenhaal's protagonist Anthony Swofford encountering a oil-covered horse in the mecadamised apocalypse of a sabotaged oilfield. This seemingly offers the bewildered Swofford an almost mythological dimension to his experience, but this is soon debased by a drunken party. Swofford often seems on the verge of some kind of epithany but is misguided by the sensless machismo of 'The Core'. This theme is best realised in the brutal irony of the scene where the marines are shown patriotically chanting to Apocalypse Now's famed Ride of the Valkaries helicopter assault, apparently unaware of its subversive connotations and highly seduced by the spectacle of American military might ('Shock and Awe').",5,Possible Classic & Underrated,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,2887,"['highly', 'underrated', 'film', 'will', 'come', 'define', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'way', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'defined', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'say', 'can', 'yet', 'be', 'elevated', 'lofty', 'status', 'time', 'brutal', 'cynicism', 'mixed', 'taste', 'surreal', 'similar', 'way', 'Copola', 'masterpiece', 'many', 'ways', 'also', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'beginning', 'training', 'camp', 'anonomous', ""'jarheads"", 'being', 'put', 'paces', 'tyrannical', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'Where', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'ability', 'translate', 'process', 'dehumanisation', 'battle', 'field', 'engagingly', 'more', 'contextual', 'message.Mendes', 'Jarheads', 'are', 'mere', 'ordinance', 'technological', 'war', 'Trudging', 'desert', 'encounter', 'burnt-out', 'convoys', 'hit', 'US', 'laser-guided', 'bombs', 'victims', 'anonymous', 'probably', 'civillian', 'modern', 'war', 'where', 'enemy', 'unclear', 'where', 'battle', 'won', 'air', 'experience', 'defined', 'never', 'having', 'shot', 'rifles', 'generation', 'disenfranchised', 'young', 'men', 'brought', 'up', 'believe', 'American', 'superiority', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'fight', 'achieve', 'Many', 'will', 'leave', 'unable', 'consider', 'hero', 'country', 'obsessed', 'heroism', 'are', 'left', 'finally', 'despair', 'seeming', 'futility', 'Having', 'been', 'moulded', 'testosterone-fuelled', 'unthinking', 'hence', ""'Jarhead"", 'killing-machines', 'war', 'many', 'one', 'boredom', 'frustration.Where', 'film', 'really', 'elevated', 'highly', 'stylised', 'vision', 'desert', 'unrelentingly', 'oppressive', 'stark', 'unflinching', 'white', 'use', 'contemporaneous', 'music', 'also', 'clever', 'even', 'one', 'character', 'comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'music', 'define', 'age', 'same', 'way', 'Vietnam', 'did', 'Nirvana', ""'Something"", 'Way', 'accompanies', 'terrifying', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'Swofford', 'be', 'sick', 'mess', 'hall', 'sink', 'torrent', 'sand', 'instead', 'vomit', 'Equally', 'brilliant', 'marines', 'offloading', 'munitions', 'sky', 'Public', 'Enemy', ""'Fight"", 'Power', 'archly', 'symbolic', 'vision', 'end', 'war', 'celebrations', 'are', 'many', 'entirely', 'cinematic', 'conceits', 'such', 'Gyllenhaal', 'protagonist', 'Anthony', 'Swofford', 'encountering', 'oil-covered', 'horse', 'mecadamised', 'apocalypse', 'sabotaged', 'oilfield', 'seemingly', 'bewildered', 'Swofford', 'almost', 'mythological', 'dimension', 'experience', 'soon', 'debased', 'drunken', 'party', 'Swofford', 'often', 'verge', 'kind', 'epithany', 'misguided', 'sensless', 'machismo', ""'The"", 'Core', 'theme', 'best', 'realised', 'brutal', 'irony', 'scene', 'where', 'marines', 'are', 'shown', 'patriotically', 'chanting', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'famed', 'Ride', 'Valkaries', 'helicopter', 'assault', 'apparently', 'unaware', 'subversive', 'connotations', 'highly', 'seduced', 'spectacle', 'American', 'military', 'might', ""'Shock"", 'Awe']",N/A

It showed war from a much more realistic standpoint through the eyes of the main character, the troops motto was ""welcome to the suck"".

963977,AP3B615GM191G,B000DZIGDU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","A few weeks prior to watching ""Jarhead"" in its entirety, I saw some clips of it on television and thought that perhaps it would be the ""Rambo"" of our generation.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.Basically (Spoiler Alert), the plot of Jarhead follows a Marine Unit (focusing on one solider played by Jake Gyllenhaal) that is called into active duty during Operation Desert Storm.  However, ""action"" is the furthest thing from the minds of the Marines, as they (in the words of their commanding officer) do nothing but ""train, hydrate, train, hydrate some more, and maintain a constant state of suspicious alertness"".  Even when the unit does get the opportunity to carry out a designated mission, they are quickly and easily booted aside by the ever-popular air attacks.  As the Gulf War ends, the entire unit has not fired a single shot in aggression throughout the entire campaign.This film did one major thing right, but also seemed to generalize about a number of things that I did not appreciate:What works is the focus on Gyllenhaal's character and the mind-set the he embodies through the entire process.  He is pretty much lost when he enters the Marines, but then goes (in stages) from being utterly confused, to angry for enlisting, to ready to fight, to confused once again about his role in the entire process.  Though uncomfortable at times (as we prefer to think of our returning soldiers as no less than out and out heroes), it was interesting to see a sampling of the emotions that likely beset our young men and women serving abroad.The main reason the film turned me off a bit, though, is the generalization it made about the U.S. military.  Sure, I understand that the ground troops may not have been as effective in a war fought out in the desert, but I cannot bring myself to believe that all military life (while not bombing the crap out of something from above) is boring and pointless.  The Marines are still an elite combat unit that serves their country to the utmost, and I don't believe for a second that they find their task to be as boring or inane as director Sam Mendes portrays it.  It almost seems as if Mendes (although not overly preachy about it, which was good) was using the example of the Gulf War to cast a pall over the entire current military structure/usefulness.Thus, while Jarhead is a decent film that touches on some uncomfortable social/personal issues surrounding enlistment in the U.S. military, it ultimately fails to live up to my ""next Rambo"" tag due to a few over-generalizations that could very easily be used to unfairly steer audiences into an anti-military frame of mind.",3,Can A Movie About Boredom Really Be Good?,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,2640,"['few', 'weeks', 'prior', 'watching', 'Jarhead', 'entirety', 'saw', 'clips', 'television', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'Rambo', 'generation', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'severely', 'disappointed.Basically', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'plot', 'Jarhead', 'Marine', 'Unit', 'focusing', 'one', 'solider', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'called', 'active', 'duty', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'However', 'action', 'furthest', 'thing', 'minds', 'Marines', 'words', 'commanding', 'officer', 'do', 'nothing', 'train', 'hydrate', 'train', 'hydrate', 'more', 'maintain', 'constant', 'state', 'suspicious', 'alertness', 'Even', 'when', 'unit', 'get', 'opportunity', 'carry', 'out', 'designated', 'mission', 'are', 'quickly', 'easily', 'booted', 'aside', 'ever-popular', 'air', 'attacks', 'Gulf', 'War', 'entire', 'unit', 'not', 'fired', 'single', 'shot', 'aggression', 'entire', 'campaign.This', 'film', 'did', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'right', 'also', 'seemed', 'generalize', 'number', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'What', 'focus', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'mind-set', 'entire', 'process', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'when', 'Marines', 'then', 'stages', 'being', 'utterly', 'confused', 'angry', 'enlisting', 'ready', 'fight', 'confused', 'once', 'again', 'role', 'entire', 'process', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'prefer', 'think', 'returning', 'soldiers', 'less', 'out', 'heroes', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'sampling', 'emotions', 'likely', 'beset', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'serving', 'abroad.The', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'turned', 'off', 'bit', 'generalization', 'made', 'U.S.', 'military', 'Sure', 'understand', 'ground', 'troops', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'war', 'fought', 'out', 'desert', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'believe', 'military', 'life', 'not', 'bombing', 'crap', 'something', 'boring', 'pointless', 'Marines', 'are', 'still', 'elite', 'combat', 'unit', 'country', 'utmost', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'find', 'task', 'be', 'boring', 'inane', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'almost', 'Mendes', 'not', 'overly', 'preachy', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'using', 'example', 'Gulf', 'War', 'cast', 'pall', 'entire', 'current', 'military', 'structure/usefulness.Thus', 'Jarhead', 'decent', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'social/personal', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'enlistment', 'U.S.', 'military', 'ultimately', 'live', 'up', 'next', 'Rambo', 'tag', 'due', 'few', 'over-generalizations', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'used', 'unfairly', 'steer', 'audiences', 'anti-military', 'frame', 'mind']",N/A

He is going to be out of a job, at least for a while.3) There is a hell of a lot of homoeroticism.  Also, all if not most of the women are seen as unfaithful and useless. This aspect of the film is very questionable.  A lot of [...] references, we know it's going on....but OK enough already.  Men do it, but we aren't very proud.4)  I wasn't in the Gulf, but I know that there was shelling for 30 days straight prior to engagement, constant, constant, constant...day and night.  I've heard that it was sickening.  I didn't see that in the movie, but maybe because of the Marines location I could be in error.This movie is like the Thin Red Line.  It is not strong but it wants to illustrate a statement about the suffering of War from a single perspective.  The statement that I like is that the military is not pretty, the life of a private is and can be very, very stressful.  In hind sight, most people for whatever reason, minimalize their military experiences; this movie succesfully portrays the agony that a typical private must endure.  I was not in the Gulf, but in the IRR released out of the US Army at the time. I could identify with the stress and the immediacy of wanting to be identified for your efforts.The fact that War shouldn't necessarially be glorified is, I believe, the goal of this movie.  This seems to be War at a realistic viewpoint.  This movie is meant to be a follow up of Full Medal Jacket, the synsicism and humor is there.  Some of the personal practices and beliefs are stretched.  The fact that the Gulf War was a huge success is captured and that is a welcome benefit.",3,"Flawed, but useful",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1778,"['1', 'Why', 'Kayne', 'West', 'song', 'appear', 'was', 'produced', '10', 'years', 'Gulf', 'War', '2', 'Marine', 'killed', 'training', 'instructor', 'going', 'be', 'investigated', 'going', 'be', 'job', 'least', 'while.3', 'hell', 'lot', 'homoeroticism', 'Also', 'not', 'most', 'women', 'are', 'seen', 'unfaithful', 'useless', 'aspect', 'film', 'very', 'questionable', 'lot', '[', ']', 'references', 'know', 'going', '.but', 'OK', 'enough', 'already', 'Men', 'do', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'proud.4', 'was', ""n't"", 'Gulf', 'know', 'was', 'shelling', '30', 'days', 'straight', 'prior', 'engagement', 'constant', 'constant', 'constant', 'day', 'night', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'sickening', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Marines', 'location', 'could', 'be', 'error.This', 'movie', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'not', 'strong', 'illustrate', 'statement', 'suffering', 'War', 'single', 'perspective', 'statement', 'like', 'military', 'not', 'pretty', 'life', 'private', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'stressful', 'hind', 'sight', 'most', 'people', 'reason', 'minimalize', 'military', 'experiences', 'movie', 'succesfully', 'agony', 'typical', 'private', 'must', 'endure', 'was', 'not', 'Gulf', 'IRR', 'released', 'US', 'Army', 'time', 'could', 'identify', 'stress', 'immediacy', 'wanting', 'be', 'identified', 'efforts.The', 'fact', 'War', 'should', ""n't"", 'necessarially', 'be', 'glorified', 'believe', 'goal', 'movie', 'be', 'War', 'realistic', 'viewpoint', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'follow', 'up', 'Full', 'Medal', 'Jacket', 'synsicism', 'humor', 'there', 'personal', 'practices', 'beliefs', 'are', 'stretched', 'fact', 'Gulf', 'War', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'captured', 'welcome', 'benefit']",N/A
