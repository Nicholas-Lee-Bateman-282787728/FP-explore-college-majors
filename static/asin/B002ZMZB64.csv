The film takes elements from North By Northwest, a mistaken identity film by Alfred Hitchcock.  It's equal parts smooth British spies, expressionless Eastern Europeans, and cutthroat diamond merchants.Val Kilmer is uninspiring as a hapless American doctor in Bulgaria that ultimately travels to Prague to evade his assailants.  The movie's cover is misleading, as it portrays Kilmer as something of a spy or action hero.  Helping him along the way is the lovely secret agent played by Polish actress Izabella Miko (Athena in Clash of the Titans).The direction and cinematography are both decent, but the acting and writing both are sub-par.  The film lacks an original story, and just isn't suspenseful.

1314371,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B002ZMZB64,Israel Drazin,"[2, 3]","This 2010 film is an excellent suspense thriller, with many twists. Val Kilmer gets into trouble when in 1992 Bulgaria he allows a pretty woman to enter his car and avoid people who are trying to catch her. He drops her off where she wants to exit and continues to his destination, to help deliver a child. For Kilmer is a physician working with ""Doctors without Borders."" But since he was seen helping the woman, those who saw him think he is John Charter, who they expected would be coming to town. Hence the film's title: Kilmer is a physician and Charter; he has a double identity. He is arrested, but the doctors arrange for his release.It appears that there are at least four conflicting groups involved in this crime caper, the unauthorized selling of diamonds, against the rules of the diamond cartel who want to restrain sales to keep diamond prices high. There are agents of the cartel, mob figures who want to sell the illegal diamonds, criminals who want to buy the diamonds, and other criminals who hear about the possible sale and want to steal the diamonds and the money. The police may also be involved, or at least some of them.Kilmer knows nothing of this. He does not know who Charter is. He also has no idea what the girl is up to or which side she is on. As we watch the film, we are also left in the dark for a long time. We see that he and the girl become attracted to one another. We see how she tries to protect him. We watch double cross after double cross. We see Kilmer's friend murdered and the police searching for him as the suspected murderer. We watch many chases. We have no idea who John Charter is until near the end of the film. Thus the film is filled with action and suspense. Will Kilmer live to the end of the film? Will the girl survive? Will they get together?

Instantly Val knows how to disarm somebody with his bare hands, shoot a gun with perfect accuracy, and talk himself out of any situation.In a nutshell: the script is dreadful, the plot is absurd, the budget is a shoestring, and the acting flounders.

A doctor who is with Doctors Beyond Borders (a take off of Doctors Without Borders) gets accidentally caught up in international intrigue dealing with an international smuggling ring.What I like about the movie is you have no idea who is trying to save him.  You get the hint that Izabella Miko's character is spying at the beginning of the flick, so no spoiler here.  Yet, whom is she spying for?  The action is much more calculating than a spy thriller.  I think the title could have been more of mistaken identity.  Even though he shows he is a doctor, his accusers will not let him be.  There is definately a North by Northwest type of theme here, yet, it is not as exciting, with a much more deliberate tempo.  There are some scenes where there is a bit of time, driving, walking, looking in windows, I actually did a minimum fast forward through these getting the gist and making sure not to miss the dialog.  Hence, the movie dragged less.I think there is a lot of potential with this movie.  The character actors playing the various roles portrayed a verys serious side of things, I guess international organized crime is more like that than what you may find in a more entertaining film.The DVD itself needed at least one extra where they told you why they made the film.

1314375,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B002ZMZB64,ninjasuperstar,"[5, 6]","Other than the beautiful Izabella Miko (who plays Katrine), this movie is unwatchable.  In an attempt to make this boring story a thriller, director and co-writer Dennis Dimster gives the audience as much information as to what is going on as the protagonist (Dr. Nicholas Pinter, played by the bloated Val Kilmer).  Essentially, Dr. Pinter is misidentified as John Charter, a character who is not credited.  The film consists of Val Kilmer being made to run (which is unintentionally funny) or be delivered to a series of random scenes.  It's disorienting for the audience, because most of the other characters have some idea of their roles, but Kilmer's character is clueless.Because this movie is so poor, and there's nothing really much to say about it, I am going to blame Kilmer's long greasy hair and beard for how dumb this movie is.  If your bearded, greasy-haired mug is in every newspaper, and you want to escape detection, perhaps the ""doctor"" would have thought to, I don't know, have a shave and wash and cut his hair.

1314377,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZMZB64,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Double Identity (Dennis Dimster, 2009)Val Kilmer was once one of Hollywood's most bankable names, appearing in what seemed to be every blockbuster that came out of Hollywood in the late eighties and early nineties, from Top Gun to The Princess Bride to Tombstone and everything in between. But somewhere along the way, something happened, and Kilmer started taking roles that are, shall we say, a little less Hollywood and a little more, well, Moscow Zero and The Thaw and Double Identity. And I will admit, I defended the middle of those.Plot: Kilmer plays an American doctor who's part of a Doctors Without Borders-style organization, going wherever his talents are needed. This often takes him behind what was at one point the iron curtain; his travels start getting noticed by certain government forces, and he ends up being misaken for a famous Eastern Bloc spy after getting caught in the middle of a nasty firefight where he helps a beautiful young woman (Coyote Ugly's Izabella Miko) escape a hail of bullets. Cue generic thriller.To be fair, it's not a bad little film; unlike a number of actors whose career has gone to the dogs, requiring them to take roles like this, Kilmer still has a full set of acting chops, and Miko stands up to him just fine most of the time. One more rewrite with an eye towards originality, or even memorability, would have done this movie an excellent turn. As it stands, though, you will likely have forgotten a great deal about it within ten minutes of it ending. There is nothing of substance here, and that is to the movie's great detriment. **",2,Weevil Twin.,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,1587,"['Double', 'Identity', 'Dennis', 'Dimster', '2009', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'bankable', 'names', 'appearing', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'came', 'Hollywood', 'late', 'eighties', 'early', 'nineties', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Tombstone', 'everything', 'somewhere', 'way', 'something', 'happened', 'Kilmer', 'started', 'taking', 'roles', 'are', 'shall', 'say', 'little', 'less', 'Hollywood', 'little', 'more', 'well', 'Moscow', 'Zero', 'Thaw', 'Double', 'Identity', 'will', 'admit', 'defended', 'middle', 'those.Plot', 'Kilmer', 'American', 'doctor', 'who', 'part', 'Doctors', 'Borders-style', 'organization', 'going', 'talents', 'are', 'needed', 'often', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'iron', 'curtain', 'travels', 'start', 'getting', 'noticed', 'certain', 'government', 'forces', 'up', 'being', 'misaken', 'famous', 'Eastern', 'Bloc', 'spy', 'getting', 'caught', 'middle', 'nasty', 'firefight', 'where', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'escape', 'hail', 'bullets', 'Cue', 'generic', 'thriller.To', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'film', 'number', 'actors', 'career', 'gone', 'dogs', 'requiring', 'take', 'roles', 'Kilmer', 'still', 'full', 'set', 'acting', 'chops', 'Miko', 'up', 'just', 'fine', 'most', 'time', 'One', 'more', 'rewrite', 'eye', 'towards', 'originality', 'even', 'memorability', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'excellent', 'turn', 'though', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'forgotten', 'great', 'deal', 'ten', 'minutes', 'ending', 'nothing', 'substance', 'here', 'movie', 'great', 'detriment', '**']",N/A
