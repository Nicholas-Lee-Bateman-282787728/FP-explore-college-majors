The Double Coma. Wow. Maybe I dont watch enough drama but I was impressed. New to me.3. Crazy Guy. Its not that he intends bad things, its just that bad things happen when hes around. He even looks crazy.4. Actress abuse. The lead actress is a GREAT ACTOR. The fact she can even talk while wearing those shoes is a trbute to her skill. As an aside, shame on those horrible kdrama producers, how could they subject such a cute girl to such horrible torture.5. Wait, this isnt going where I thought. I cant give it away.6. When s*** is boring or confusing I can just look at the awesome Korean women. +1 Internet.Try to watch it on a service that has the broadcast 16:9. All the dvd stuff is 4:3 and looks dodgy imo.",4,Flawed Masterpiece,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,837,"['Very', 'uneven', '1', 'still', 'dont', 'understand', 'pilates', 'now', 'love', 'almost', 'fetish', 'display', 'Very', 'nice', 'imo.2', 'Double', 'Coma', 'Wow', 'Maybe', 'dont', 'watch', 'enough', 'drama', 'was', 'impressed', 'New', 'me.3', 'Crazy', 'Guy', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'just', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'when', 'hes', 'around', 'even', 'crazy.4', 'Actress', 'abuse', 'lead', 'actress', 'GREAT', 'ACTOR', 'fact', 'can', 'even', 'talk', 'wearing', 'shoes', 'trbute', 'skill', 'aside', 'shame', 'horrible', 'kdrama', 'producers', 'how', 'could', 'subject', 'cute', 'girl', 'such', 'horrible', 'torture.5', 'Wait', 'isnt', 'going', 'where', 'thought', 'cant', 'give', 'away.6', 'When', 's***', 'boring', 'confusing', 'can', 'just', 'look', 'awesome', 'Korean', 'women', '+1', 'Internet.Try', 'watch', 'service', 'broadcast', '16:9', 'dvd', 'stuff', '4:3', 'dodgy', 'imo']",When a Man Loves / When a Man Falls In Love Korean Drama - English Subtitle

I love how we see the characters mature through the series.  You love them initially, then you hate them, and then you love them again.  The story was amazing.

Then it gets fairly good, then it starts avalanching at the speed of sound back into sheer crap.ALL of the characters are unpleasant and annoying. NONE of them smile, are endearing, or caused me to give a crap what happened to them. I could not root for anybody. The female lead is nothing to leave home for, NEVER smiles, and is a constant ""Ninna-nonna-ninna-nnaa-ninnna"" party pooper stick-in-the-mud and an all-around jerk.By episode 5 ALL of the characters become extreme exaggerations of their own characters, and ALL of them have commenced to whining, complaining, doing unpleasant things, and just beeing all around annoying.There are SO MANY plot twists and subplots that they become a joke, as if written via algorithm looking for conflct and the pairing of opposites.I watch A LOT of Korean film, but this is crap.Miss it..",1,Sheer Crap - Skip It,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,897,"['out', 'crappy', 'Then', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'Then', 'fairly', 'good', 'then', 'avalanching', 'speed', 'sound', 'back', 'sheer', 'crap.ALL', 'characters', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'annoying', 'NONE', 'smile', 'are', 'endearing', 'caused', 'give', 'crap', 'happened', 'could', 'not', 'root', 'anybody', 'female', 'lead', 'nothing', 'leave', 'home', 'NEVER', 'constant', 'Ninna-nonna-ninna-nnaa-ninnna', 'party', 'stick-in-the-mud', 'all-around', 'jerk.By', 'episode', '5', 'ALL', 'characters', 'become', 'extreme', 'exaggerations', 'own', 'characters', 'ALL', 'have', 'commenced', 'whining', 'complaining', 'doing', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'just', 'beeing', 'are', 'SO', 'MANY', 'plot', 'twists', 'subplots', 'become', 'joke', 'written', 'algorithm', 'looking', 'conflct', 'pairing', 'opposites.I', 'watch', 'LOT', 'Korean', 'film', 'crap.Miss', 'it..']",When a Man Loves / When a Man Falls In Love Korean Drama - English Subtitle
1668836,AJH2JD8YFC72S,B00EUN4748,kathryn,"[1, 1]","SSH has been in a couple of dramas where his character dies...so watching this drama, the viewer spends a good part of their viewing time hoping he doesn't die off.  Once you forget that, there is the issue of the young female lead's sullen expression, the annoying actor playing her love interest and the dawning feeling that the second (& older female) lead is too likable & lovely to be a dastardly second lead.  Having waited out all those emotions, eventually, the viewer is rewarded by the sheer attractiveness of SSH.  His character has one judgment failure.  Beyond that, he is too perfect for words.  So I give up describing him and say I would watch this drama again, given his amount of screen time.  Sure he suffers too much, but he does it so handsomely!  SSH fans enjoy!",4,SSH::sigh::,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,784,"['SSH', 'been', 'couple', 'dramas', 'where', 'character', 'dies', 'so', 'watching', 'drama', 'viewer', 'good', 'part', 'viewing', 'time', 'hoping', ""n't"", 'die', 'off', 'Once', 'forget', 'issue', 'young', 'female', 'lead', 'sullen', 'expression', 'annoying', 'actor', 'playing', 'love', 'interest', 'dawning', 'feeling', 'second', 'older', 'female', 'lead', 'too', 'likable', 'lovely', 'be', 'dastardly', 'second', 'lead', 'Having', 'waited', 'out', 'emotions', 'eventually', 'viewer', 'rewarded', 'sheer', 'attractiveness', 'SSH', 'character', 'one', 'judgment', 'failure', 'Beyond', 'too', 'perfect', 'words', 'So', 'give', 'up', 'describing', 'say', 'would', 'watch', 'drama', 'again', 'given', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'handsomely', 'SSH', 'fans', 'enjoy']",When a Man Loves / When a Man Falls In Love Korean Drama - English Subtitle
1668837,A1M585V9OXGTP8,B00EUN4748,Van,"[0, 0]","This movie has superb casts. Their performances are spot on, most of the time. As the story progressed I found myself drawn into their drama, even though the drama can be over dramatic in some parts. In my opinion the writing needs some improvement. For example, the accident scene was too cruel to my taste, they could have re-shoot it or rewrite it. At some points a few characters were pushed to their breaking points and became too cruel. It was hard to watch. However, overall it is very good drama. I especially liked the way a few characters communicate their feeling via the blackboard at the bookstore. Some of the messages are very inspiring. The title really says it all about the main character. If you really love you have to be willing to give up everything. I like it enough that I'm going to buy this series",4,Very Good K-Drama,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,823,"['movie', 'superb', 'casts', 'performances', 'are', 'spot', 'most', 'time', 'story', 'progressed', 'found', 'drawn', 'drama', 'even', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'over', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'opinion', 'writing', 'improvement', 'example', 'accident', 'scene', 'was', 'too', 'cruel', 'taste', 'could', 'have', 're-shoot', 'rewrite', 'points', 'few', 'characters', 'were', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'points', 'became', 'too', 'cruel', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'However', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'drama', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'few', 'characters', 'communicate', 'feeling', 'blackboard', 'bookstore', 'messages', 'are', 'very', 'inspiring', 'title', 'really', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'love', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'everything', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'series']",When a Man Loves / When a Man Falls In Love Korean Drama - English Subtitle
