The disc went on to sell over 6 million copies wordwide and is a fan favorite. This year he released Scenes that You Know By Heart which features live video versions of the same songs from the album plus two newer bonus tracks ( Hey Good Lookin' and It's Five O'Clock Somewhere).The cuts were taken from concerts in the United States, Anguilla and France and have been featured on several other videeos that Buffett has released over the years but this is not a real problem. The disc was originally sold as a Walmart exclusive and at a price of around $10 it is quite a bargain. The sound is an excellent 5.1 Stereo Surround mix and the video picture quality is excellent for the material.If you are a fan this is a must have for your collection.",4,Another Small Gem,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,832,"['1985', 'Jimmy', 'Buffett', 'released', 'greatest', 'hits', 'album', 'Songs', 'Know', 'Heart', 'disc', 'went', 'sell', '6', 'million', 'copies', 'wordwide', 'fan', 'favorite', 'year', 'released', 'Scenes', 'Know', 'Heart', 'live', 'video', 'versions', 'same', 'songs', 'album', 'two', 'newer', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'Hey', 'Good', 'Lookin', 'Five', ""O'Clock"", 'Somewhere', '.The', 'cuts', 'were', 'taken', 'concerts', 'United', 'States', 'Anguilla', 'France', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'several', 'other', 'videeos', 'Buffett', 'released', 'years', 'not', 'real', 'problem', 'disc', 'was', 'originally', 'sold', 'Walmart', 'exclusive', 'price', '10', 'quite', 'bargain', 'sound', 'excellent', '5.1', 'Stereo', 'Surround', 'mix', 'video', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'material.If', 'are', 'fan', 'must', 'have', 'collection']",N/A

However, in terms of music, this DVD is bad because of 2 reasons. First, the music and singing are drowned out by the shouting of the audience. For example, I can hardly hear he sing and the music in the first song ""Cheese burger in paradise"". Ironically, I bought this DVD after listening to that song on a CD which was recorded in a studio, not in a live show. The main purpose that I bought this is to enjoy the music not just to watch the picture. Secondly, after the first two songs, I found most of them sound very much like each other. Consequently, I became bored.",2,Beautiful and Colorful Scenes + Enthusiastic Artist + The Singing and Music can hardly be heard = Bad Music DVD,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,720,"['love', 'Jimmy', 'personality', 'video', 'enjoying', 'life', 'singing', 'happiness', 'spreads', ""'m"", 'watching', 'video', 'However', 'terms', 'music', 'DVD', 'bad', '2', 'reasons', 'First', 'music', 'singing', 'are', 'drowned', 'out', 'shouting', 'audience', 'example', 'can', 'hardly', 'hear', 'sing', 'music', 'first', 'song', 'Cheese', 'burger', 'paradise', 'Ironically', 'bought', 'DVD', 'listening', 'song', 'CD', 'was', 'recorded', 'studio', 'not', 'live', 'show', 'main', 'purpose', 'bought', 'enjoy', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'picture', 'Secondly', 'first', 'two', 'songs', 'found', 'most', 'sound', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'Consequently', 'became', 'bored']",N/A

I didn't get what I bought as there is NO INDICATION this was taped LIVE. So I feel ripped off.
