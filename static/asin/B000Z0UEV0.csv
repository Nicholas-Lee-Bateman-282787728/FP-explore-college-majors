I think that the camera should focus on Richard and the rest of the people are basically in the back ground. I noticed that the  videos  become more difficult and more fun actually as the numbers increase. I like the little motivations Richard throws in  like you are doing great and thank you for dancing with me etc. It is fun to watch the end when the people come out and proudly dance and show you how many pounds they have lost. It is fun to watch people who are struggling to lose weight  getting out there and taking care of their health and trying so hard to help others.

You don't even want them to end. Richard's first four ""Sweatin'"" videos are the best of his work and they are the videos I most turn to when I want to get moving. They are great for people who love oldies music like I do and each video is an oldies theme with live music. They are really cute. The four videos get progressively harder so it's worth it to start with number one first, but I find I actually like the later videos better because they become more like dancing and less like exercising. Because Richard doesn't really teach the steps or do much verbal coaching (he does occasionally announce when the step changes, but more often not), it takes a few times of watching before you learn all the moves. But the moves are all really easy so you don't need to worry if you don't know how to dance. Also, the best thing is to just get started and not worry if you can't get your hands and feet to do everything exactly as is on the first few times. You'll see on the video that even the people in the video make mistakes. The important thing is to just get started and eventually you'll get it. Once you do, you'll realize how fun and easy it really is.I also like all the extras that come with this set. The interviews are really inspiring and great motivators. I will admit that most people will not look like models just from these videos alone, but they will probably help overweight people lose a few pounds and they are definitely good for staying fit and active. If you are looking for maximum benefit for your exercise routine, you should try something harder. These are really just for fun and for people who would otherwise not exercise at all.

I pictured a workout dvd by him to be something of the same and wouldn't have dreamed I'd own won because of it, ,much less the whole collection! However, I kept reading the accolades on Amazon and it didnt seem to be just a workout for those really out of shape...it seemed to be a workout for both beginners and daily fitness buffs and the word ""fun"" was used quite a bit. So I tried it. Wow! Now I get why he's still on radio and tv as a fitness guru 20 years after his debut. (or more)I can't believe I was enjoying myself so much during a workout that I found myself grinning from ear to ear...and my heart rate stayed in the target zone, burning great calories.Whats different? Several things...while most fitness dvds are set to instrumental music that sounds, I'm sorry, like bad instrumental porn music, they actually paid the royalties to use REAL songs with words and music you know. That is a tremendous boost even if you arent into the ""oldies"" (as Im not...I still loved it) and he has a live band playing and real people all doing the workout.visually, this gives you so much to look at that you never get bored no matter how often you do it. The multitude of people, shapes and personalities, and the live band, as well as other visual bonuses he adds such as Elvis dancing out onto the set, a motorcycle rider riding onto the set, etcPhysically, the moves are fun, he cues very well, you never get lost in the steps even though you wind up ""dancing"". I have found other fitness dance dvds to leave me confused and out of step and frustrated and feeling like a need a degree in dance. Not true for Richard's dvds...they are simple aerobic moves put together so that they have the movement and feel that you are just having fun dancing while you are doing great cardio.Time flies on these dvds!! He is motivating, fun, energetic, and these dvds are truly unique in any collection. They are a great workout but a fun workout that anyone can do...from beginner to athlete...and still get exactly what you want out of it.I can't believe I'm saying it, but i'm now a true fan He is a household name for a reason.

Worth every penny. Richard Simmons' words will keep you motivated to lose weight and make you feel good about yourself and he was a genius for the idea to make these videos. They are so much fun to do even if you're not too overweight but would like to get up and be active. And it features a live band and real people of all shapes and sizes and fun dances that start out slow then get a bit more challenging. Each set has been remastered for excellent quality and comes with new interviews by Richard himself, and some of the exercisers, which are very interesting to listen to. I used to watch these videotapes all the time when I was a little kid and it brings back a lot of memories.Volume 1. is set at the Prom. Some songs include ""It's My Party,"" ""Dancing in the Street,"" ""Ain't no mountain high enough,"" ""He's a rebel"" and ""Peggy Sue."" I love how everyone is dressed, very late 80s! So what if the clothes and set are ""outdated?"" That's what makes it fun to watch. I love the set in this one, it's decorated like a party with streamers and balloons and lights. Not a typical prom of today but oh wellVolume 2. is set at Pop's Diner. I don't do this one that often as the exercises are a bit more challenging but I still like to do it every now and then and I'll admit this is a fun one. I like the atmosphere in this one, that it takes place at a 1950s style diner. Some songs include ""Fever,"" ""Loco-motion,"" ""My Boyfriend's Back,"" ""Breakin' up is hard to do,"" and ""Windy.""Volume 3. is set at Sweatin' Land. One of my favorites. Again I love the atmosphere, that it takes place at an amusement park complete with a Ferris Wheel and a carousel, balloons, and various ""props"" in the background. Some songs include ""Gimme some lovin,"" ""Rockin Robin,"" ""Louie Louie,"" ""California Dreamin'"" and ""The Name Game."" I love the ""behind the scenes"" during the end credits. I wish there was some for volume 1.Volume 4. Not my favorite as I can't really tell what the ""set"" is and it's not one I normally do, but I do like the gospel choir and some of the music. ""Someday, We'll Be Together,"" ""Mony Mony,"" ""Shout,"" and ""Dance to the music"" are all featured.Buy this set. You will most likely lose a few pounds and you will be active.
