She denounces it as a lousy portrayal of lesbianism. Yeah, I answer, but it is a great sports movie! And it is  too. Personal Best is not just a great sports movie, but is also a great  bildungsroman (&quot;coming of age&quot; movie). In it the lead character,  Chris Cahill (Mariel Hemingway) is involved in a dysfunctional relationship  with her father who is a coach. We see little of her family life. The movie  revolves around her moving to a new family and getting new parents: Tory  Skinner (Patrice Donnelly) and Terry Tingloff (Scott Glenn, who is, you  guessed it, a coach). The problem is the tranference of parental relations  is confused from the very beginning by a sexual relation between Chris and  Tory. The waters are muddled even further when jealousy rears his head  between the &quot;parents,&quot; and between Tory and Chris who are set in  competition against each other by Tingloff. Through it all, Chris grows up  so that, when Tingloff comes on to her in a vulnerable situation, she  staves him off (unlike Tory in a earlier scene) and begins to develop her  own relationships and her own philosophy of competition. The moral of the  movie is: To be competitive you don't have to be better than everybody  else, just a little bit better than you were yesterday. You don't have to  kill the competition, you can love the competition, but always remember,  you are the competition.",5,All time favorite &quot;jock&quot; movie,961200000,"06 17, 2000",2000,1503,"['So', ""'m"", 'having', 'party', 'conversation', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'quot', 'Personal', 'Best', 'quot', 'up', 'lousy', 'portrayal', 'lesbianism', 'Yeah', 'answer', 'great', 'sports', 'movie', 'too', 'Personal', 'Best', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'sports', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'bildungsroman', 'quot', 'coming', 'age', 'quot', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', 'Chris', 'Cahill', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'involved', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'father', 'who', 'coach', 'see', 'little', 'family', 'life', 'movie', 'moving', 'new', 'family', 'getting', 'new', 'parents', 'Tory', 'Skinner', 'Patrice', 'Donnelly', 'Terry', 'Tingloff', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'who', 'guessed', 'coach', 'problem', 'tranference', 'parental', 'relations', 'confused', 'very', 'beginning', 'sexual', 'relation', 'Chris', 'Tory', 'waters', 'are', 'muddled', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'jealousy', 'head', 'quot', 'parents', 'quot', 'Tory', 'Chris', 'who', 'are', 'set', 'competition', 'other', 'Tingloff', 'Chris', 'up', 'so', 'when', 'Tingloff', 'vulnerable', 'situation', 'off', 'Tory', 'earlier', 'scene', 'develop', 'own', 'relationships', 'own', 'philosophy', 'competition', 'moral', 'movie', 'be', 'competitive', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'better', 'everybody', 'else', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'yesterday', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kill', 'competition', 'can', 'love', 'competition', 'always', 'remember', 'are', 'competition']",Personal Best VHS

First, the behind-the-scenes look at athletic training techniques is incomparable.

Also, the details about various events were intriguing -- setting the blocks for sprinting, determining one's &quot;pace&quot; for high-jumping, the muscular ballet employed for the shot put.  Watching Coach Scott Glenn (Urban Cowboy's &quot;Wes Hightower&quot;) was inspirational, he obviously knew how to get the most from a team member.  And the work-outs themselves were marvelous, the long runs, the hill-climbs, the post-workout massages and other physical therapy, with particular attention to specific body areas -- all of this information is extremely important for any male athlete, and should probably be viewed several times, numerous times, again and again, in order to ensure full comprehension and complete appreciation.",5,Perfect Chemistry To Produce A Superlative Guy Movie,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,1094,"['film', 'EXACTLY', 'right', 'ingredients', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'Guy', 'Flicks', 'time', 'First', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'athletic', 'training', 'techniques', 'incomparable', 'preparation', 'methods', 'are', 'highly', 'educational', 'stretching', 'warm-ups', 'cool-downs', 'actually', 'seeing', 'activities', 'demonstrated', 'invaluable', 'aspiring', 'athletes', 'Also', 'details', 'various', 'events', 'were', 'intriguing', 'setting', 'blocks', 'sprinting', 'determining', 'one', 'quot', 'pace', 'quot', 'high-jumping', 'muscular', 'ballet', 'employed', 'shot', 'put', 'Watching', 'Coach', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'quot', 'Wes', 'Hightower', 'quot', 'was', 'inspirational', 'obviously', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'team', 'member', 'work-outs', 'were', 'marvelous', 'long', 'runs', 'hill-climbs', 'post-workout', 'massages', 'other', 'physical', 'therapy', 'particular', 'attention', 'specific', 'body', 'areas', 'information', 'extremely', 'important', 'male', 'athlete', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'viewed', 'several', 'times', 'numerous', 'times', 'again', 'again', 'order', 'ensure', 'full', 'comprehension', 'complete', 'appreciation']",Personal Best VHS
