Ringo was always my favorite narrator! I remember watching shining time station as a kid, and i loved the stories! But due to whatever Ringo Never re-did all 52 episodes for the US audience which led to George Carlin finishing and re-narrating all of the first season which leads him to many people to favor George Carlin in the US! But for me Ringo had the better narration for the first two seasons! But anyways this was one of my first thomas VHS's i got the strand home video version first, and i played it so much i wore it out, and then i got the Strand VCI verison in 2003! The stories on this VHS like all american thomas is not released in broadcast order in a sense, but keeps stories together. We Start off with Better Late than never, about thomas trying to deal with repairs on the viaduct, for the rest of the second season we would see the viaduct under repair, but on this episode aired after all the other Episodes but yet it is the opening one! Then We go into the trilogy about Duck and Diesel, and how duck ends up in a predicament in the barbers shop, which led to Sir Topham Hat telling duck he never believed Disel and he wants him back home in the yard. Now 5 of the episodes are season 2 episodes, and the opening episode is a season 2 episode giving us the ONLY US Season 2 opening, after this we skipped to Season 3 intros! While Thomas breaks the rules was a season 2 release with season two style nameboards and stuff, it still had a season 1 intro! So the next two stories on this release were season 1, one of my favorites Gordon Takes a Dip, where gordon thinks hes too important to pull a freight train and runs into a ditch, and Down the Mine where Thomas i cheeky to gordon and then needs his help to get out of the mine. The next episode which did air before the other two season 2 episodes was MY FAVORITE thomas episode growing up, THE RUNAWAY! I don't know what it is about, but theres still a lot of nostalgia with that episode! Now when i was a kid i had the Strand Home Video version, but i played it so much the VHS got warped during Gordon takes a dip, and down the mine and The Runaway. Then i purchased the strand VCI entertainment version as a replacement and now have found the original cover verison! There should have been another Ringo Starr VHS after this one in the US, there was 6/7(if you count the version of thomas and the missing christmas tree on tis a gift). For whatever reason Tenders and turntales, Thomas breaks the rules and better late than never was discontinued, and trust thomas showed that another ringo starr RS US VHS would never be released! Its to bad, but luck has been on our side because a high quality verison of Percy takes the Plunge, A New Friend for Thomas, and Saved from Scrap have been released on DVD! I would give this VHS 20/10. Even with all the UK RS stuff i do have this VHS will always be the best..",5,Still my Favorite Thomas VHS even if its not made anymore,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,3056,"['Recently', 'i', 'have', 'felt', 'increase', 'season', '1/season', '2', 'collection', 'Thomas', 'tank', 'engine', 'i', 'have', 'purchased', 'UK', 'VHS', 'get', 'complete', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'UK', 'Narration', 'Ringo', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'narrator', 'remember', 'watching', 'shining', 'time', 'station', 'kid', 'i', 'loved', 'stories', 'due', 'whatever', 'Ringo', 'Never', 're-did', '52', 'episodes', 'US', 'audience', 'led', 'George', 'Carlin', 'finishing', 're-narrating', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'people', 'favor', 'George', 'Carlin', 'US', 'Ringo', 'had', 'better', 'narration', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'thomas', 'VHS', 'i', 'got', 'strand', 'home', 'video', 'version', 'first', 'i', 'played', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'wore', 'out', 'then', 'i', 'got', 'Strand', 'VCI', 'verison', '2003', 'stories', 'VHS', 'american', 'thomas', 'not', 'released', 'broadcast', 'order', 'sense', 'stories', 'together', 'Start', 'off', 'Better', 'Late', 'never', 'thomas', 'trying', 'deal', 'repairs', 'viaduct', 'rest', 'second', 'season', 'would', 'see', 'viaduct', 'repair', 'episode', 'aired', 'other', 'Episodes', 'yet', 'opening', 'one', 'Then', 'go', 'trilogy', 'Duck', 'Diesel', 'how', 'duck', 'up', 'predicament', 'barbers', 'shop', 'led', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hat', 'telling', 'duck', 'never', 'believed', 'Disel', 'back', 'home', 'yard', 'Now', '5', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'opening', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'episode', 'giving', 'ONLY', 'US', 'Season', '2', 'opening', 'skipped', 'Season', '3', 'intros', 'Thomas', 'rules', 'was', 'season', '2', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'style', 'nameboards', 'stuff', 'still', 'had', 'season', '1', 'intro', 'next', 'two', 'stories', 'release', 'were', 'season', '1', 'one', 'favorites', 'Gordon', 'Dip', 'where', 'gordon', 'thinks', 'hes', 'too', 'important', 'pull', 'freight', 'train', 'ditch', 'Mine', 'where', 'Thomas', 'cheeky', 'gordon', 'then', 'help', 'get', 'mine', 'next', 'episode', 'did', 'air', 'other', 'two', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'was', 'MY', 'FAVORITE', 'thomas', 'episode', 'growing', 'up', 'RUNAWAY', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'theres', 'still', 'lot', 'nostalgia', 'episode', 'Now', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'kid', 'i', 'had', 'Strand', 'Home', 'Video', 'version', 'i', 'played', 'so', 'much', 'VHS', 'got', 'warped', 'Gordon', 'dip', 'mine', 'Runaway', 'Then', 'i', 'purchased', 'strand', 'VCI', 'entertainment', 'version', 'replacement', 'now', 'have', 'found', 'original', 'cover', 'verison', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'VHS', 'one', 'US', 'was', '6/7', 'count', 'version', 'thomas', 'missing', 'christmas', 'tree', 'tis', 'gift', 'reason', 'Tenders', 'turntales', 'Thomas', 'rules', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'was', 'discontinued', 'trust', 'thomas', 'showed', 'ringo', 'starr', 'RS', 'US', 'VHS', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'bad', 'luck', 'been', 'side', 'high', 'quality', 'verison', 'Percy', 'Plunge', 'A', 'New', 'Friend', 'Thomas', 'Saved', 'Scrap', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', 'VHS', '20/10', 'Even', 'UK', 'RS', 'stuff', 'i', 'do', 'have', 'VHS', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best..']",N/A

It's like The Flying Kipper only with Duck helping Henry. I am a big fan of Henry and this was a great story for the Henry fans. Anyway, I'll tell you about the rest of the stories: In HENRY AND THE ELEPHANT find out what surprise awaits Henry when he takes some workman to clear out a tunnel of a rather mysterious object. In YOU CAN'T WIN see how Stuart and Falcon get to help old Duke when he can't pull his passenger train by himself. In SPECIAL ATTRACTION, Toby is on his way to the carnival as the special attraction. But when he gets there, someone tells him that the carnival doesn't need a special attraction after all. In PASSENGERS AND POLISH, Duncan is mad that he didn't get polished and decides to come to a standstill on the viaduct while pulling passengers. In GALLANT OLD ENGINE, find out how Rheneas saves the railway and welcome him home when he finally comes back from the works. And in FISH, see what happens to Duck when he helps Henry with the Flying Kipper and ends up in a very fishy situation. The music video on this tape is ""REALLY USEFUL ENGINE"", a cute song about everyone's favorite #1 blue engine, Thomas. I'd recommend this Thomas video, you'll enjoy it. :)",5,Fish!,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,1306,"['Gallant', 'Old', 'Engine', 'great', 'Thomas', 'video', 'stories', 'are', 'fantastic', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Fish', 'Flying', 'Kipper', 'only', 'Duck', 'helping', 'Henry', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Henry', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'Henry', 'fans', 'Anyway', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'rest', 'stories', 'HENRY', 'THE', 'ELEPHANT', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'surprise', 'awaits', 'Henry', 'when', 'workman', 'clear', 'out', 'tunnel', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'object', 'YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'WIN', 'see', 'how', 'Stuart', 'Falcon', 'get', 'help', 'old', 'Duke', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'passenger', 'train', 'SPECIAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'Toby', 'way', 'carnival', 'special', 'attraction', 'when', 'there', 'someone', 'carnival', ""n't"", 'need', 'special', 'attraction', 'PASSENGERS', 'AND', 'POLISH', 'Duncan', 'mad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'polished', 'come', 'standstill', 'viaduct', 'pulling', 'passengers', 'GALLANT', 'OLD', 'ENGINE', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Rheneas', 'railway', 'welcome', 'home', 'when', 'finally', 'back', 'works', 'FISH', 'see', 'what', 'Duck', 'when', 'Henry', 'Flying', 'Kipper', 'up', 'very', 'fishy', 'situation', 'music', 'video', 'tape', 'REALLY', 'USEFUL', 'ENGINE', 'cute', 'song', 'everyone', 'favorite', '1', 'blue', 'engine', 'Thomas', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Thomas', 'video', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A
