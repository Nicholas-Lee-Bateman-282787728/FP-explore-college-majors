1378718,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B004047Y06,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[33, 34]","As with just about every anime series ever, there are good things about Sekirei, and there are bad things. In Sekirei's case, though, the good things far outweigh the bad.For the uninitiated, Sekirei revolves around a battle royale of sorts, centering around 108 super-soldiers fighting for ultimate supremacy. There's more on the line than just bragging rights, though: The winner of the entire tournament, along with their Ashikabi (contract partner), will gain entrance into heaven, where they can stay for all eternity. The rest... will die in the process.The premise seems tired and cliched at first: voluptuous ladies fighting amongst themselves for the affection of a particular male. However, this series gives the cliche some welcome twists. An Ashikabi does not have to stick with just the one Sekirei that he ""wings"" (in this series, ""winging"" refers to the Ashikabi unlocking the Sekirei's true powers. How is this done? How else? A kiss.) Rather, one Ashikabi can ""wing"" multiple Sekirei, forming a battle harem of sorts. You can see that coming from a mile away, and the protagonist Minato does indeed start building up his harem in a hurry.In spite of the harem cliches obviously present, the series excels in other areas. The combat scenes are fast-paced and always pleasing. The fan-service is definitely there, though not in the amount present in anime like Green Green et. al; in other words, there's enough to please, but not enough to turn a majority of anime viewers off from it. Another thing I liked about the series, is that the creators didn't fall back on the old trope of having -all- of the fighters be female; at least one of the Sekirei- Homura- is a full-blooded male, which adds some more well-needed variety to the series. (As a side note, Homura's story alone is worth watching. If the Sekirei story were nothing but Homura, I'd still watch it.)Aside from the whole harem thing, there's really only one problem I had with the series, and it has to deal with one of the Sekirei that Minato ""wings."" Kusano is only eight or nine years old, and it kind of disturbed me to think that a girl as small and innocent as her would even be in a series like this, much less having to be ""winged"" by someone who could potentially be arrested for something like that. I guess it's her age that disturbs me, the most. *shrugs*I won't say anything else about the series itself, but I will say this: The manga goes a lot further than the anime does; the anime will take a second season to span the events of the manga, and yes the second season has already been confirmed. So until the second season releases, I'll have to keep myself entertained with the wonders of the first season. And you know, I really don't have a problem with that.",4,"A story to please, but not for all",1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,2758,"['just', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'Sekirei', 'are', 'bad', 'things', 'Sekirei', 'case', 'though', 'good', 'things', 'far', 'outweigh', 'bad.For', 'uninitiated', 'Sekirei', 'battle', 'royale', 'sorts', 'centering', 'around', '108', 'super-soldiers', 'fighting', 'ultimate', 'supremacy', 'more', 'line', 'just', 'bragging', 'rights', 'winner', 'entire', 'tournament', 'Ashikabi', 'contract', 'partner', 'will', 'gain', 'entrance', 'heaven', 'where', 'can', 'stay', 'eternity', 'rest', 'will', 'die', 'process.The', 'premise', 'tired', 'cliched', 'first', 'voluptuous', 'ladies', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'affection', 'particular', 'male', 'However', 'series', 'cliche', 'welcome', 'twists', 'Ashikabi', 'not', 'have', 'stick', 'just', 'one', 'Sekirei', 'wings', 'series', 'winging', 'refers', 'Ashikabi', 'unlocking', 'Sekirei', 'true', 'powers', 'How', 'done', 'How', 'else', 'kiss', 'Rather', 'one', 'Ashikabi', 'can', 'wing', 'multiple', 'Sekirei', 'forming', 'battle', 'harem', 'sorts', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'protagonist', 'Minato', 'indeed', 'start', 'building', 'up', 'harem', 'hurry.In', 'spite', 'harem', 'obviously', 'present', 'series', 'excels', 'other', 'areas', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'always', 'pleasing', 'fan-service', 'definitely', 'there', 'not', 'amount', 'present', 'anime', 'Green', 'Green', 'et', 'al', 'other', 'words', 'enough', 'please', 'not', 'enough', 'turn', 'majority', 'anime', 'viewers', 'thing', 'liked', 'series', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'old', 'trope', 'having', '-all-', 'fighters', 'be', 'female', 'least', 'one', 'Sekirei-', 'Homura-', 'full-blooded', 'male', 'more', 'well-needed', 'variety', 'series', 'side', 'note', 'Homura', 'story', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'Sekirei', 'story', 'were', 'nothing', 'Homura', ""'d"", 'still', 'watch', 'Aside', 'whole', 'harem', 'thing', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'series', 'deal', 'one', 'Sekirei', 'Minato', 'wings', 'Kusano', 'only', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'kind', 'disturbed', 'think', 'girl', 'small', 'innocent', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'series', 'much', 'less', 'having', 'be', 'winged', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'arrested', 'something', 'guess', 'age', 'most', '*shrugs*I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'series', 'will', 'say', 'manga', 'lot', 'further', 'anime', 'anime', 'will', 'take', 'second', 'season', 'span', 'events', 'manga', 'yes', 'second', 'season', 'already', 'been', 'confirmed', 'So', 'second', 'season', 'releases', ""'ll"", 'have', 'keep', 'entertained', 'wonders', 'first', 'season', 'know', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem']",Sekirei: Season 1
1378719,AOB5695UUUJ0,B004047Y06,"Anime Lover ""D""","[36, 37]","I have watched the first season and getting into the second season now.  And I must say that both series are amazing.  you would think despite the lovely lady on the cover and how they put the description from the back that this is a story full of nothing but attractive men and women beating on each other until their clothes are gone showing their assets - you are partially right, but under it all there is a great story, memorable characters (besides the obvious) and non stop action and humor (even when things get serious).Our hero, Minato, is the typical nice shy guy, so much so he never has much chances with the ladies, but that changes when out of the sky a bouncy, beautiful girl literally falls on him, smothering him with her chest.  She is on the run from a twin set of sisters who can shoot lightning from their hands, but when the two kiss Musubi gains special power to drive off the assialants.  This is just the beginning as Minato learns of a dark orginization who is trying to determine the next step of human evolution and using these powerful warriors called Sekirei's to choose it, with the winning Sekirei and master getting whatever wish they desire.  As the two begin their journey, they are joined by other bouncy ladies all wanting Minato to turn on their ""special"" desires.  Can Minato survive dinner, let alone the tournament?As I said, this series is full of everything, but definately not child friendly (HIgh nudity and fan service). But give it a shot if you are a fan if Ikki Tousen or looking for something a little different in you anime titles.edit:  this is only season one, as two came in a 2 pack.  the reason is if you look at the extras and there is only the OVA Ku's shopping day (which is adorable as Ku is my favorite character).",5,there IS a story under all this loveliness,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1776,"['have', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'getting', 'second', 'season', 'now', 'must', 'say', 'series', 'are', 'amazing', 'would', 'think', 'lovely', 'lady', 'cover', 'how', 'put', 'description', 'back', 'story', 'full', 'nothing', 'attractive', 'men', 'women', 'beating', 'other', 'clothes', 'are', 'gone', 'showing', 'assets', 'are', 'partially', 'right', 'great', 'story', 'memorable', 'characters', 'obvious', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'humor', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'serious', '.Our', 'hero', 'Minato', 'typical', 'nice', 'shy', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'much', 'chances', 'ladies', 'changes', 'when', 'sky', 'bouncy', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'literally', 'smothering', 'chest', 'run', 'twin', 'set', 'sisters', 'who', 'can', 'shoot', 'lightning', 'hands', 'when', 'two', 'kiss', 'Musubi', 'gains', 'special', 'power', 'drive', 'off', 'assialants', 'just', 'beginning', 'Minato', 'dark', 'orginization', 'who', 'trying', 'determine', 'next', 'step', 'human', 'evolution', 'using', 'powerful', 'warriors', 'called', 'Sekirei', 'choose', 'winning', 'Sekirei', 'master', 'getting', 'wish', 'desire', 'two', 'begin', 'journey', 'are', 'joined', 'other', 'bouncy', 'ladies', 'wanting', 'Minato', 'turn', 'special', 'desires', 'Can', 'Minato', 'survive', 'dinner', 'let', 'alone', 'tournament', 'said', 'series', 'full', 'everything', 'definately', 'not', 'child', 'friendly', 'HIgh', 'nudity', 'fan', 'service', 'give', 'shot', 'are', 'fan', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'anime', 'titles.edit', 'only', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'came', '2', 'pack', 'reason', 'look', 'extras', 'only', 'OVA', 'Ku', 'shopping', 'day', 'adorable', 'Ku', 'favorite', 'character']",Sekirei: Season 1
1378720,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B004047Y06,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[2, 2]","When the cover of a anime DVD have the word boobs written all over you know what you are getting, and Sekirei do indeed deliver boobs. This anime is what I would call fan service with a plot, and as such it is very good. Sekirei is a rather typical magic girl/harem anime, the main character is a wimpy teenager who accidentally get involved with the Sekirei plan. Now Sekirei are men and woman with supernatural powers who are pitted against one another to fight until only one remain. Now these Sekirei, if they can find special people of, typically of the opposite gender and kiss them then they form a bond with this person and their powers become more powerful, are you seeing where this is going yet? Good so is everyone who have ever read manga or watched anime before. Our main protagonist are off course one of these magical kissers called Ashikabi and he attracts a group of Sekirei who off course falls in love with him.You are not going to find anything new in this series, it have all been done before, but Sekirei takes this true and tried method and dos it very well. The animation is beautiful, the characters are interesting, the fight scenes are well choreographed. Sekirei also do something well which many do wrong and that is phasing, the story moves along nicely and there is a good balance between action scenes and drama.Now I could not talk about this show without mentioning the fan service, for there is allot of it. This is the kind of anime which really do not have that many panty shots for the simple reason that the characters spend so much time naked that there are no panty to shoot. In every fight someone's cloths are being ripped off, and when the girls are not fighting and thereby getting naked they are sitting in the bath talking. I however do not mind the fan service here as the show clearly states this is what it is about. This is fan service with a plot. Everything in this anime is made to be an excuse to show naked, animated boobs. Now if you have a regular show, especially one who try to be serious and all you have is fan service (I am not mentioning any names but I am looking at you High School of the Dead) then that can get annoying, here you know what you are getting and the show do not hide what it is. If you hate fan service do not get this show plain and simple, the box even warns you that there will be boobs. But if fan service is what you are looking for or you just want a good story and a bit of fun then the fan service in this sort of just fit in with the whole.I love the story in Sekirei, it is perfect for what the show is trying to be, it is not exactly Lein, it is not trying to be deep, but it is fun, involving and it kept me wanting to put on the next episode to see what happens. Sekirei is also a good beginner anime I think as the storyline is fairly straight forward, without the often rather strange twist and turns typical to anime. This series also do have an ending, though the ending feel more like the end of a season than the end of a series so hopefully there will be more Sekirei anime in the future.As for Sekirei have a good opening theme, it is a little to generic, but I watched the intro to most of the episodes as I liked the song. There is two ending themes, and I did not really care for any of them. I am not really a music critic though so what do I know, you might like the ending themes, I found them incredible bland, tough the second one is better than the first.In conclusion I loved this show, it is a light hearted, fun romp, the story is interesting and the animation is great, however there are loads and loads of fan service so your opinion on that really is what determines if Sekirei is worth getting or not. If you like or tolerate fan service then I think you will enjoy Sekirei for it is really quite good.",4,Fan service with a plot.,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,3822,"['When', 'cover', 'anime', 'DVD', 'have', 'word', 'boobs', 'written', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'Sekirei', 'do', 'indeed', 'deliver', 'boobs', 'anime', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'fan', 'service', 'plot', 'such', 'very', 'good', 'Sekirei', 'rather', 'typical', 'magic', 'girl/harem', 'anime', 'main', 'character', 'wimpy', 'teenager', 'who', 'accidentally', 'get', 'involved', 'Sekirei', 'plan', 'Now', 'Sekirei', 'are', 'men', 'woman', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'who', 'are', 'pitted', 'one', 'fight', 'only', 'one', 'remain', 'Now', 'Sekirei', 'can', 'find', 'special', 'people', 'typically', 'opposite', 'gender', 'kiss', 'then', 'form', 'bond', 'person', 'powers', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'are', 'seeing', 'where', 'going', 'yet', 'Good', 'so', 'everyone', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'manga', 'watched', 'anime', 'main', 'protagonist', 'are', 'course', 'one', 'magical', 'kissers', 'called', 'Ashikabi', 'group', 'Sekirei', 'who', 'off', 'course', 'love', 'him.You', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'anything', 'new', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Sekirei', 'true', 'tried', 'method', 'dos', 'very', 'well', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'choreographed', 'Sekirei', 'also', 'do', 'something', 'well', 'many', 'do', 'wrong', 'phasing', 'story', 'moves', 'nicely', 'good', 'balance', 'action', 'scenes', 'drama.Now', 'could', 'not', 'talk', 'show', 'mentioning', 'fan', 'service', 'allot', 'kind', 'anime', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'panty', 'shots', 'simple', 'reason', 'characters', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'naked', 'are', 'panty', 'shoot', 'fight', 'someone', 'cloths', 'are', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'when', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'fighting', 'thereby', 'getting', 'naked', 'are', 'sitting', 'bath', 'talking', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'fan', 'service', 'here', 'show', 'clearly', 'what', 'about', 'fan', 'service', 'plot', 'Everything', 'anime', 'made', 'be', 'excuse', 'show', 'naked', 'animated', 'boobs', 'Now', 'have', 'regular', 'show', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'try', 'be', 'serious', 'have', 'fan', 'service', 'am', 'not', 'mentioning', 'names', 'am', 'looking', 'High', 'School', 'Dead', 'then', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'here', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'hide', 'what', 'hate', 'fan', 'service', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'show', 'plain', 'simple', 'box', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'boobs', 'fan', 'service', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'story', 'bit', 'fun', 'then', 'fan', 'service', 'sort', 'just', 'fit', 'whole.I', 'love', 'story', 'Sekirei', 'perfect', 'what', 'show', 'trying', 'be', 'not', 'exactly', 'Lein', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'deep', 'fun', 'involving', 'kept', 'wanting', 'put', 'next', 'episode', 'see', 'what', 'Sekirei', 'also', 'good', 'beginner', 'anime', 'think', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'often', 'rather', 'strange', 'twist', 'typical', 'anime', 'series', 'also', 'do', 'have', 'ending', 'ending', 'feel', 'more', 'end', 'season', 'end', 'series', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'Sekirei', 'anime', 'future.As', 'Sekirei', 'have', 'good', 'opening', 'theme', 'little', 'generic', 'watched', 'intro', 'most', 'episodes', 'liked', 'song', 'two', 'ending', 'themes', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'music', 'critic', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'might', 'like', 'ending', 'themes', 'found', 'incredible', 'bland', 'tough', 'second', 'one', 'better', 'first.In', 'conclusion', 'loved', 'show', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'romp', 'story', 'interesting', 'animation', 'great', 'however', 'are', 'loads', 'loads', 'fan', 'service', 'so', 'opinion', 'really', 'what', 'Sekirei', 'worth', 'getting', 'not', 'like', 'tolerate', 'fan', 'service', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Sekirei', 'really', 'quite', 'good']",Sekirei: Season 1

1378729,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B004047Y06,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[6, 7]","Let me set the record straight and tell you that FUNimation's marketing for this gem of a show is completely idiotic. If you were to listen to its double entendre-laden summary on the package, or watch any of the trailers, you'd think it was idiotic exploitation with no artistic merits whatsoever. Once again, this proves the company's complete inability to market something that has risque elements to it. Listening to the way they describe this series, it sounds like a ridiculous farce on the same level as ""Heaven's Lost Property."" What surprised me most about ""Sekirei"", however, is its earnest attempt to tell a compelling story underneath all of the fan service.Minato Sahashi comes from the ""Love Hina"" vein of anime protagonists: young, decently attractive, and a total academic failure. Much like shows of that type, a bevy of beautiful women start crowding around him, most notably the busty and powerful Musubi, who is the show's charming, unique love interest. But this show eschews the typical perverted high jinks, outside of some bath scenes and ""boy walks in on girl changing"" moments, for an intriguing, fight-oriented plot. See, Musubi is what is known as a Sekirei, which are powerful superhuman beings capable of incredible feats. In order to fully unleash her power, however, she needs what is known as Ashikabi, which is a handler of sorts that a Sekirei forms a spiritual bond with. How is the bond formed? Why, with kissing, of course!All silliness aside, this concept is surprisingly pliable. The Sekirei are competing in a government game to see which one is the strongest, and thus, many of the Sekirei are desperately seeking Ashikabi to boost their power. Others are hopelessly enslaved by rich, spoiled Ashikabi, who only want to win the game for power and recognition, abusing their Sekirei in order to get what they want. Seeing how different individuals handle this newfound power and status makes for some compelling entertainment, due to the distinct contrasts between Minato and some of the other, lesser Ashikabi. It adds a solid human element to the series, one that other fighting-focused ecchi shows could learn a thing or two from.But despite the tinge of humanity, this is still a show that emphasizes on two things: fighting and mammary glands. The first of these two things is done surprisingly well. Each Sekirei has different powers and wicked martial arts abilities, and with the excellent animation, battles never devolve into plodding ""Naruto""-esque bouts. The combat is actually very reminiscent of ""Queen's Blade"", another excellent fan-service show, in the sense that it's always engaging and keeps you wanting more. Throughout this first season, the fighting was always conservatively placed and never tiresome. Given some of the other shows featuring similar content, this is definitely a feat in and of itself.Worth noting to this critic, though, is the fan service itself. I know, it seems kind of weird to praise a show for its handling of titillation, but ""Sekirei"" does it so well that it definitely deserves special note. This series is never coy or teasing with its fan service, instead opting to shove the nudity in your face whenever it sees fit. This makes for an overall more honest experience, breaking it free from the confines of a ""tee-hee, look, BOOBIES!"" teen sex comedy. Having the actual nudity put on display shows that the animators were aiming for an older male crowd as opposed to an adolescent crowd of snickering tween boys, and that definitely gives it some extra clout in my book.That's not to say the show is perfect, however; after all, this type of anime rarely is. The biggest issue with ""Sekirei"" is its unevenness with the pacing and tone of the overall story arc. At one moment, we're expected to bust a gut laughing at a comedic misunderstanding, and then a few minutes later, the show throws an emotional curveball at us. While it is true that art should not be faulted for attempting to encompass a wide range of emotions, I did feel that the show couldn't settle on what it wanted to be and thus decided to be a little bit of everything. When this works, it's beautiful, but when it doesn't, it comes across as a bit uneven. That being said, the characters are all quite unique and multi-faceted, and you shouldn't be shocked if you become emotional during some of the more intense scenes. By the end of series, you'll definitely have some heavy investment in one or two of the characters.""Sekirei"" is a strong show that, against all odds, is one of the most and entertaining anime I've seen in a long while. With a strong dub, great animation, and a pleasantly breezy soundtrack, it makes for not only some fine Summer viewing, but fine viewing for anytime of the year. At this price, it's a complete steal for a show that will definitely leave some sort of impression on you.Plot: B+Animation: A-Music: B-Voice Acting (Dub): A-Overall: B+NOTE: I didn't know quite how to slide this into my review, but it feels necessary to point out that despite how male-oriented this show seems, there are in fact a bevy of attractive men for women to get some kicks out of. Thus, I feel this is a show that a couple could comfortably watch and enjoy together.",4,Bouncy In More Ways Than One,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,5242,"['Let', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'tell',

She is a warrior taking part in a game/experiment to try and unlock ancient secrets by battling other such empowered women.  She needs a partner and Minato, who kindly looks after her, is it. It is further explained to Minato that he is now part of the top secret game/experiment and if he tells anyone about it he will suffer.Musubi is powerful and very straight forward but beyond naive. Minato unable to find a job or get into school but with a good heart finds a way to thrive, for once, though he is regularly freaked out by both the magical powers of his partner, the violence and her lack of modesty. Indeed the fan boy service is the greatest failing of Sekirei. All of the women are stupidly over endowed and usually someone crashing down on Minato leads to him to have his face either buried in massive cleavage or someone's panties. Both of which makes him embarrassed and..he freaks out. That gets old fast.The plot for Sekirei is fairly straight forward and in fact so straight forward that it is formulaic. Anyone whose seen a lot of anime will see this very quickly. It's a shame because the characters are nice. They are almost but not quite the stereotypes  of the current wave of anime romance but deliver their parts with just enough quirkiness to make them stand out. The problem is between the formulaic delivery and the fan boy artwork there is a pretty good chance that particular quality will get lost. In deed I would have enjoyed the love story and comedy far more has Musubi been normally proportioned and still unaware of her looks.The bottom line is this is in many ways a typical anime of the genre.

The main character builds his harem out of several fighters each seemingly more busty then the last (if that's possible) and they all ""want"" him for themselves - yet he's not really man enough to take advantage of his situation. Some of the fight scenes are quite good, and the Funimation english voice actors as usual do a good job. I particularly like the very proper speaking blond and the extremely busty drunk. At times it is very cute and light hearted and other times very dire and tense when the stakes are raised and some of the characters die. But the whole time you are going to have plenty of huge boobs in your face and up close and personal on your screen, bouncing, jiggling and being squeezed.",3,A Guilty Pleasure,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1056,"['eye-candy', 'type', 'anime', 'basically', 'geared', 'towards', 'fanservice', 'pleasing', 'senses', 'plot', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'need', 'know', 'right', 'there', 'cover', 'anime', 'about', 'big', 'breasted', 'women', 'nudity', 'innuendo', 'however', 'real', 'sexual', 'content', 'main', 'character', 'harem', 'several', 'fighters', 'seemingly', 'more', 'busty', 'then', 'last', 'possible', 'want', 'yet', 'not', 'really', 'man', 'enough', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Funimation', 'english', 'voice', 'actors', 'usual', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'particularly', 'very', 'proper', 'speaking', 'blond', 'extremely', 'busty', 'drunk', 'times', 'very', 'cute', 'light', 'hearted', 'other', 'times', 'very', 'dire', 'tense', 'when', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'characters', 'die', 'whole', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'plenty', 'huge', 'boobs', 'face', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'screen', 'bouncing', 'jiggling', 'being', 'squeezed']",Sekirei: Season 1

Season one is probably the better of the two seasons. Season two doesn't really expand much and it starts to fall back on traditional harem comedy bits. Its definitely worth a watch. But that doesn't mean its perfect. The art style, takes time to get used to. Women are without a doubt the worst drawn. Bodies are either completely out of proportion or full of odd angles. You can tell it's the artist's style but it is distracting because it takes away from the characters.
