But the movie has nobility and growth as well.  All this in a culture and land most Americans no little about.

How does Miguel (Christian Mercado), a man with all his Latino machismo, devotion to his pregnant wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), and a deep affinity for his humble fishing village with its centuries old traditions reconcile his love for another man, Santiago (Manolo Cardona)--- a known gay painter whom the entire village shuns?Miguel's denial is deep and strong and his guilt and shame are sometimes overbearing. When Santiago drowns in an undertow, he returns to Miguel as a ghost who cannot be seen or heard by anyone other than Miguel.  But Miguel is faced with a heart wrenching dilemma. Santiago will never be able to find peace in death unless his body is found and offered to the Lord with a traditional funeral service involving a public ceremony and burial at sea.  But this tiny Peruvian village with its fundamental Christian beliefs is an unlikely backdrop for any type of service honoring a deceased homosexual who was well known and considered a destructive force to everything the villagers stood for.In order to convince the people to honor his lover in death, Miguel will have to make public the relationship the two men shared. He will also have to convince Santiago's mother as well as the villagers and the local priest that this ""proper"" burial is not only what Santiago wanted but what is required for him to rest in peace. It will also mean that he will never see Santiago's ghost again or share any more time with the man he loved.Treat yourself to a viewing of this achingly beautiful masterpiece which showcases love, compassion, honor, dignity, and acceptance in their purest and sincerest form.",5,It's Difficult To Express in Words How Beautiful This Film Is!

They make you ask if there was a meaning or message involved, and they also surprise you in many other ways. That is the best way - for now, at least - that I can describe ""Undertow"" (Contracorriente), one of the most remarkable and passionate Peruvian movies that I have seen in quite some time. And I'm sure that there will be some that label it controversial. Hell, for that matter, I would also describe it as educational.Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is happily married to Mariela (Tatiana Artengo). Theirs is a simple life, in a small coastal Peruvian town, where Miguel makes a living as a fisherman. They also happen to be anxiously waiting for the birth of their first child. However, one of Miguel's relatives dies, and it's up to him to give the last rites before the corpse is buried in the sea - a tradition in this village. It is at this point that we meet Santiago (Manolo Cardona), who appears out of nowhere, taking photographs at the funeral ceremony, particularly of Miguel. As it turns out, both men have been lovers for some time, and Santiago came to town -- he's from the big city, from a wealthy family - to convince Miguel to go away with him on a vacation. Theirs, also, is a secret, illicit love. This, of course, is a problem for Miguel, because his wife is about to deliver his child any minute. Santiago seems to not understand Miguel's position, and gets upset at his lover. Eventually and mysteriously, Santiago disappears, and that's when Miguel's problems really begin.""Undertow"" is not just any gay movie, as you may think during its first minutes. It is quite a powerful indictment against many issues at the same time. It asks the question about what it is to be a real gay male. How do you know if it is just a one event thing? It also questions the values of a small town in regards to loyalty and friendship, and the power of gossip. It also talks about true love under harsh conditions, and director by Javier Fuentes-Le&oacute;n does a fantastic job in gluing all these feelings together. The acting is superb, as well as the natural colorful locations. Not in vain, the film deservedly won awards at the Sundance, Miami San Sebastian International, and 42 more film festivals.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","CONTRACORRIENTE (a/k/a UNDERTOW, 2011, Spanish with subtitles) is a haunting, plain and simple love story about the consequences of any relationship. Miguel ""Chino"" (Cristian Mercado) is a respected fisherman in the little fishing village of Cabo Blanco, Peru. Though happily married, he harbors a secret: his love affair with out-of-town artist Santiago (Manolo Cardona). Desperate that no one ever discover the secret, Miguel forces Santiago to live the lie with him: they are to pretend they know nothing of each other - and if anyone asks Miguel, he'll answer that he ""has nothing to do with that fag.""After Santiago accidentally drowns in the ocean, his body lost at sea, he appears only to Miguel. Happy to be together at last, since no one else can see Santiago, Miguel, though frequently diving to search for Santiago's body, is glad to be together with him. Santiago informs Miguel that unless they are together, there is a sort of nothingness embracing Santiago. Soon, he asks Miguel to let him rest. With the village talking and Miguel's baby recently born, things begin to unravel emotionally and metaphysically. It doesn't help that Miguel has actually found the body and tied it to a rock on the ocean floor - so Santiago cannot leave him.This quiet, well acted film reminds me of some Icelandic and Norwegian films. The Peruvian fishing community is quite interesting, plain superstitious folk who believe a body must be ""offered up"" to the sea and buried at sea by a loved one. The village priest is instrumental in the custom, which is one I know a bit about, but had never really observed. Our people do not do this and our custom is they must be buried in the ground.This is a gorgeous film: acting very fine, cinematography flawless, a location most stunning by the seaside, and a tender love story that illustrates the best and the worst in us. In time, Santiago will teach Miguel what it means to be a man and own up to who he really is. The love between them will not count as much as the stronger, nobler feelings. Therein lies the unusual metaphysical power of this film, since the Latin countries all tend to be extremely homophobic.This is not a children's film, and there is some sex in it. Nothing too excessive, but I found an element of creepiness in the fact that Miguel was quite able to have sex with Santiago's ghost!Still, UNDERTOW is an important, provocative film that cannot be missed. An American remake would be perfect, therefore I suspect it will never be made.

It's so romantic and so dramatic that I didn't know if I wanted to smile to the clear and wonderful love I could read in Mico and Tiago's eyes, or cry for the not happily ever after that I was obviously approaching.It's not much of a spoiler, since it's in the blurb of the movie the production house released, but if you don't want to know more, stop read here. This is a ghost story, meaning that Tiago and Mico are lovers, and they are since they were young and Tiago was spending his summers in Mico's little seaside village. But now Mico is married and his wife is pregnant. It's clear that more than his wife Mico desperately loves the child they are waiting. Mico loves his wife with a love that you can have for a dear friend, he is a good husband, but there is no passion between them. The passion is all for Tiago, and their love is so strong that Tiago accepts to be Mico's little dirty secret, to share pieces of his life from afar and to endure the village's disapproval for the ""maricon"", as if he was the only one. The in a odd accident that is not clear if it's a suicide or a stupid accident (I think the second one), Tiago drowns, but his spirit is trapped with Mico. Why? Is their love so strong that Tiago doesn't want to leave Mico? maybe. Or maybe it's time for Mico to admit who he really loves, and with this admission, he will at the same time free and lose Tiago. And at this point I was in tears.The setting is wonderful, the use of the characters' facial expression masterly, the feelings were conveyed more with images than words.

The roles of Santiago and Miguel are brilliantly played by Cristian Mercado and Manolo Cardona.  In watching them in this film, one really believes in their love for each other.

1405070,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004FKNFJ4,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","Now and then a small quiet film surfaces without ballyhoo or even much press and finds its way before audiences who are deeply moved by a film about which few have even heard.  Such is the case for UNDERTOW (CONTRACORRIENTE), a little film from Peru that is not only well written and directed  (Javier Fuentes-Le&oacute;n) and well acted by a fine and credible group of actors, but one that also deals with story and information that few film dare to touch. The film has won many awards at film festivals on the order of Sundance and GLAAD, but it has failed to make the public take notice in the theaters - probably because it is a Latin American male love story.According to the writer/director, the story 'takes place in a small conservative seaside village in Peru. On the surface, all appears well for a fisherman and his devoted wife who are expecting their first baby. The hero is a hardworking and respected member of his community, which holds fast to rigid traditions. There is one wrinkle - he is also devoted to his male lover. A catastrophic accident does not erase the presence of his lover, as the fisherman must now contend with the apparitions of his forbidden love and the gossip and disapproving stares of his neighbors. And it may go without saying - his wife isn't too pleased either.'Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is the little fisherman who seems to have it all - a loving wife Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), a solid group of friends and family, and the incipient birth of his first child.  But Miguel is a closeted gay man/bisexual who is in love with a painter/photographer, the handsome Santiago (Manolo Cardona) who seems content to maintain a relationship with Miguel in secret.  But there is an accident in which one of Miguel's young friends dies and Miguel is asked by the family to prepare the body for burial, carry the boy on a bamboo stretcher, offer a eulogy and then take the body out to sea to bury it in the water - an old tradition in this small Peruvian fishing village that assures that the dead person's soul will find rest.Santiago takes photos of the funeral procession and it is obvious that the townspeople gossip about the painter - a man who paints pictures and is not married is suspect and homophobia rages.  As Mariela gives birth to their son Miguelito, Miguel is torn between his devotion to his wife and son and his desire for Santiago's physical presence.  In a series of beautifully realized love scenes between the two men it is obvious that there is a struggle on the part of both Miguel and Santiago: they love each other but that love is forbidden.  Santiago appears to Miguel one night and says that he is dead, that Miguel is the sole person able to see Santiago's ghost. This allows Miguel and Santiago to be together in the village, as  Santiago cannot be seen: they are able at last to love each other in the open.  But the village discovers that the missing Santiago's home contained nude paintings of men - men who appear to be images of Miguel.  The village treats Miguel as an outcast, his wife is outraged and leaves, and Miguel feels he has lost everything. Santiago's family come to claim the body and Miguel finally has the courage to be the man he really is.  The film ends with a deeply moving tradition upheld.Both Cristian Mercado and Manolo Cardona  handle their difficult roles brilliantly: their physical chemistry is visceral and their dealing with the Peruvian prejudice is poignant.  But each of the actors is excellent.  The cinematography by  Mauricio Vidal captures the flavor of the Peruvian seaside and the many underwater scenes are breathtaking. Selma Mutal Vermeulen provides the musical score that is the perfect balance of folksongs and background music. But in the end it is writer/director Javier Fuentes-Le&oacute;n  who deserves the kudos for a brilliant film that took considerable courage to make.  Hopefully we will be seeing more of his work in the near future.  Highly recommended.

And every now and again, to remind us of this, as happens in this tale, there will come some sign or object...perhaps as simple as a ""Candle""...which mysteriously appears in our lives, causing us to recall what we've lost ))(( Have you ever thought...or said to a Beloved: ""Without you, there is Nothing?"" If yes, then you were foretelling a major theme of this film ))A married, coastal fisherman (Miguel) as our main lead, and an unattached, visiting artist (Santiago) are the focus of this passionate love story between 2 men, spanning youth into adulthood. We'll learn this affair has a likely background of boys spending summers together...of fun times...and, no doubt, moments of finding love with one another. Sadly, however, this is a film focusing on their current day relationship which, like that of Romeo & Juliet, is being thwarted in almost every way.So, for now, we find ourselves watching and becoming absorbed in an extremely impassioned--though well hidden--love affair. With nearly every scene involving these two leads, our view of the intensity of their love for one another continues to be reinforced, as the film makes its way to a heart-rending conclusion. Of hundreds of such films in my possession, none surpass the realistic displays of love and affection given us by these actors...this director. And in watching this story play out, it becomes oh so obvious that, while Miguel deeply cares for his pregnant wife, it is Santiago who is the Great Love of his life. We see a relationship which has even reached the point of loving ""endearment names"" being used for one another (Miguel as ""Mico"" / Santiago is ""Tiago""), not to mention our witnessing numerous scenes of closeness--erotic and otherwise.Some final thoughts: You will come to see theirs as an Everlasting Love. And you will witness pure joy in something as simple as a hand-in-hand stroll....and sadness as stirring as a loving hand against cheek. Happy emotions deep enough to hit you in the gut....but also sadness...tears...loss. If you're not ashamed of crying, you will probably do so. This is a movie of lessons for many of we viewers, importantly telling us that letting go of a love, even one we may have at times denied, is an impossibility. It is an especially apt reminder...if we are to live a truthful future life (just watch as our main lead resolves his truth during a heartbreaking moment with his wife near film's end).PS--Watch for a young, fellow fisherman, Tano by name, who I often see lending support when most others don't, and taking a definite interest in our beleaguered Miguel. See where he positions himself in at least one group gathering....notice where his eyes flicker in scenes involving Miguel. Ah, who knows if he is a possible harbinger for Miguel's future and whether, in this man, ""Mico"" will find the solace and warmth he now so desperately needs. (Am I dreaming this up?

1405077,A3CDX0ZJVG63PI,B004FKNFJ4,"L. S. Philip ""Obiphil""","[4, 4]","The story is set in a quiet little South American (Peruvian?) fishing village out in the middle of nowhere. It has the classic gay movie theme : heavily closeted gay man caught between his true romance on one hand and oppressive Catholic, provincial macho values and, most devastatingly, his own wife and child on the other. It would have been a Latino BrokeBack Mountain had there not been a cheeky plot twist that brings in the supernatural. But don't be mistaken to think that from then on the movie sinks into a tacky semi-comic fairy tale flick where everybody ends up happy. Instead, the director cleverly uses the surrealistic element to highlight a poignant theme : for as long as there's societal pressure, a closeted gay man's highest aspiration is having a visible family on one side and an invisible gay lover on the other - living a cowardice lie.Plot surprises aside, what really sets the movie apart is skillful story telling and exquisite acting.

I am not usually turned on by films with subtitles but this film has not bothered me to say the least.  In fact it reminded me to brush up on my Spanish as I was able to follow along with few problems. Anyhow, the film was beautifully directed and the cast was superb. The Musical Score only heightened the movie.  The Director should be commended for his risk taking with his story (Although) nothing new here it does have a refreshing twist.  It's similar to BBM in that the story lines are so tragic.  Different because it is showing that no matter what Race, Religion you belong to everyone deals with the same emotions, struggles and losses. I am a DEVOUT supporter of Indie Films and this one has made my list of favorites. I've watched it quite a few times and I always end up feeling a sense of cleansing has taken place.  The ONLY bad mark in my opinion and it really isn't bad is that as I've watched the Bonus Features I noticed the passionate kiss between Miquel and Santiago hit the cutting floor.  I don't understand why this was taken out because it displayed to me the DEPTH of love they had for one another more deeply than a scene with them rolling around in the (hay). I mean sand.  So I felt that although the Director had taken a risk with this film he pulled back just a little by deleting that scene. He either deleted because it was too INTENSE and didn't want eyes or heads rolling or he was trying to stay within editing limits. I hope that the latter is true.

It looked a lot likeBrokeback Mountainset by an ocean, and in some ways it is, but it is also completely and utterly different. Honestly, the only safe way to compare Undertow to BBM is to say that they are both brilliant.So brilliant. My jaw literally dropped while watching this movie. Scene after scene kept getting more and more touching, more emotional, and in creative/unusual ways. This isn't a cliche movie, or a spin-off movie, or a ""gay agenda"" movie, it is its own story and boy does it hold its own.I desperately want to describe the plot to you, but I think it's absolutely best not to be too spoiled. Yes, a married man is having conflicting emotions about his homosexuality (That story isn't really new) but the way it's captured in Undertow is like nothing you've ever experienced before. It's fresh in the right places, well acted, well directed, subtly scored... Overall, a work of art that should be placed high on the mantel of gay cinema. Or ANY cinema for that matter! This is a love story and anybody can relate to that.About the Blu Ray: The film was recorded in 16mm so its got plenty of data for a nice HD transfer, and it does look nice, but it may not be quite as glossy as some of the BDs in your collection because films in 35mm definitely look more impressive in 1080p. I also get the slight hint that maybe such a low budget film as this one didn't quite get the proper digital treatment one would expect from a major release.

Undertow is one of those films. Sadly, not too many films targeted towards gay men are very good...often many of them are too cheesy, too stereotypical, far too hyper-sexual, or just very badly shot with one-dimensional or wooden characters...so it came to a surprise to me that there was nothing cheesy, stereotypical, and hyper-sexual about this movie. The characters come to life. Not to mention, this film is absolutely gorgeous...yes it's slow in its pacing...but it's far from boring or tedious. You really get a feel of the setting and the characters are very relatable. The rarest of all is finding a gay film that also makes you want to cry, and oh boy, will this movie get at least one tear to fall at the corner of your eye, possibly more. It's such a heart wrenching story, and yet so beautiful, lush, poignant, and uplifting. I can't say enough good things about Undertow.

1405086,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,B004FKNFJ4,wolfgang731,"[37, 40]","This beautiful ghost/love story is an eloquent and haunting exploration of the road not taken, of the aching that comes from realizing, too late, that you allowed your greatest happiness, you're most profound love, to fade from your life with no chance of ever retrieving it.  In a small coastal village in Peru lives Miguel, a fisherman, and his pregnant and devoted wife, Mariela.  Theirs is a life of simple pleasures and surroundings, but they have love, family and a sense of community.  Santiago, a worldly artist has been living off and on in the village for many years but to the town's residents he's an outsider, an untrustworthy interloper living on the fringe of their tight-knit existence.  However, for Miguel, Tiago (as he refers to him) is anything but; in many ways, he is his other self.  These two men have for many years, shared a profound and intense love that due to fear has sadly lingered in shadows for too long.  Where Santiago wants to share a more open relationship with Miguel, the latter refuses, even going so far as to reject his own nature and dismissing their shared feelings as nothing more than a special friendship albeit one that he is unwilling to even acknowledge to the outside world; however, when Santiago threatens to leave again, perhaps for good this time, Miguel is crestfallen and equally angry.  SPOILERS - One afternoon, Miguel arrives home to find Santiago sitting at his dinner table and becomes enraged and when Santiago sees his reaction he realizes that Miguel can see him.  You see, Santiago is now a ghost.  He died in an accident and his soul is trapped in that village but is, luckily, visible to Miguel and only Miguel, who, in turn, promises that he will do everything possible to free his soul from its Earth bound existence.  But nothing could be further from the truth as now Miguel can openly love Santiago without fear of being ostracized yet all the while maintaining his comfortable domestic life.  Now he may walk along the beach holding hands with his true love and now he may sit on the couch between his wife and Santiago and watch television and relax in selfish contentment.  For once Miguel is seemingly at peace with himself and he's unwilling to ever part with that.  After a couple of village kids stumble into Santiago's old beach shack and find paintings and drawings of a nude Miguel, the truth of his relationship with Santiago comes to light and it's rough going for everyone from that moment on.  The magical realism quality of this film worked so exquisitely, it made my heart ache with both joy and pain.  To see these two men who were so much in love but afraid be able to openly express it to one another is as moving as anything I have ever seen in a film.  There are no tidy endings here so don't look for them.  There are many casualties and those that survived bear scars.  The performances were uniformly excellent, even the smallest role is acted perfectly but Cristian Mercado as Miguel is absolutely amazing.  The score by Selma Mutal Vermeulen merits special mention as it adds immeasurably to the feel of the film.  Both the screenplay and direction are uncontrived, honest and direct, thankfully lacking in pretense.  The art direction and cinematography by Diana Trujillo and Mauricio Vidal, respectively, is almost lyrical.  They turn a hardscrabble and poor fishing village into a magical place where both sea and arid landscapes merge to create windswept vistas of unusual and powerful beauty.  Undertow is a poetic and poignant testament to the power of love, loss and redemption.  It is filmmaking of the highest caliber.",5,"Magical realism, love and the hereafter",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,3626,"['beautiful', 'ghost/love', 'story', 'eloquent', 'haunting', 'exploration', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'aching', 'realizing', 'too', 'late', 'allowed', 'greatest', 'happiness', ""'re"", 'most', 'profound', 'love', 'fade', 'life', 'chance', 'ever', 'retrieving', 'small', 'coastal', 'village', 'Peru', 'Miguel', 'fisherman', 'pregnant', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Mariela', 'Theirs', 'life', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'surroundings', 'have', 'love', 'family', 'sense', 'community', 'Santiago', 'worldly', 'artist', 'been', 'living', 'off', 'village', 'many', 'years', 'town', 'residents', 'outsider', 'untrustworthy', 'interloper', 'living', 'fringe', 'tight-knit', 'existence', 'However', 'Miguel', 'Tiago', 'anything', 'many', 'ways', 'other', 'self', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'many', 'years', 'shared', 'profound', 'intense', 'love', 'due', 'fear', 'sadly', 'lingered', 'shadows', 'too', 'long', 'Where', 'Santiago', 'share', 'more', 'open', 'relationship', 'Miguel', 'latter', 'refuses', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'reject', 'own', 'nature', 'dismissing', 'shared', 'feelings', 'nothing', 'more', 'special', 'friendship', 'one', 'unwilling', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'outside', 'world', 'however', 'when', 'Santiago', 'leave', 'again', 'perhaps', 'good', 'time', 'Miguel', 'crestfallen', 'equally', 'angry', 'SPOILERS', 'One', 'afternoon', 'Miguel', 'home', 'find', 'Santiago', 'sitting', 'dinner', 'table', 'enraged', 'when', 'Santiago', 'reaction', 'Miguel', 'can', 'see', 'see', 'Santiago', 'now', 'ghost', 'died', 'accident', 'soul', 'trapped', 'village', 'luckily', 'visible', 'Miguel', 'only', 'Miguel', 'who', 'turn', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'free', 'soul', 'Earth', 'bound', 'existence', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'now', 'Miguel', 'can', 'openly', 'love', 'Santiago', 'fear', 'being', 'ostracized', 'yet', 'while', 'maintaining', 'comfortable', 'domestic', 'life', 'Now', 'may', 'walk', 'beach', 'holding', 'hands', 'true', 'love', 'now', 'may', 'sit', 'couch', 'wife', 'Santiago', 'watch', 'television', 'relax', 'selfish', 'contentment', 'once', 'Miguel', 'seemingly', 'peace', 'unwilling', 'ever', 'part', 'couple', 'village', 'kids', 'stumble', 'Santiago', 'old', 'beach', 'shack', 'find', 'paintings', 'drawings', 'nude', 'Miguel', 'truth', 'relationship', 'Santiago', 'light', 'rough', 'going', 'everyone', 'moment', 'magical', 'realism', 'quality', 'film', 'worked', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'made', 'heart', 'ache', 'joy', 'pain', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'afraid', 'be', 'able', 'openly', 'express', 'one', 'as', 'moving', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'tidy', 'endings', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'are', 'many', 'casualties', 'survived', 'bear', 'scars', 'performances', 'were', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'even', 'smallest', 'role', 'acted', 'perfectly', 'Cristian', 'Mercado', 'Miguel', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'score', 'Selma', 'Mutal', 'Vermeulen', 'special', 'mention', 'immeasurably', 'feel', 'film', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'are', 'uncontrived', 'honest', 'direct', 'thankfully', 'lacking', 'pretense', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Diana', 'Trujillo', 'Mauricio', 'Vidal', 'respectively', 'almost', 'lyrical', 'turn', 'hardscrabble', 'poor', 'fishing', 'village', 'magical', 'place', 'where', 'sea', 'arid', 'landscapes', 'merge', 'create', 'windswept', 'vistas', 'unusual', 'powerful', 'beauty', 'Undertow', 'poetic', 'poignant', 'testament', 'power', 'love', 'loss', 'redemption', 'filmmaking', 'highest', 'caliber']",N/A
