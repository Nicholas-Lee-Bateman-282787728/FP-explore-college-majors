HupFons ""Hup234""","[6, 9]","This is by far the best cinematic production about the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to 3 children in the fields of Fatima, Portugal.  For those who are not familiar with the Fatima story, I think the film is a bit sketchy, but the essentials of the story are shown.What I liked most was that period details (costumes, scenery, etc.) seemed authentic (based on photos that I've seen previously, as well as those shown in the movie during the October apparition).  The soundtrack & the Black & White film medium added to the mood of the film.  The special effects of the apparitions were well done and portrayed the actual events of that October 13th day in a tasteful, yet realistic manner.One ""flaw"" that seemed significant to me was that the children hardly seemed seriously upset at the threats of the police interrogator.  Perhaps that was the director's intent, but it seems unlikely that 3 young naive peasant children who were imprisoned without knowing when or if they would be released would react so impassively at the threat of being lowered slowly into a cauldron of boiling oil.  In the early 1900s, while ""the great war"" (World War I) raged across the European continent, government officials, especially local police were feared by most of the people.Overall, I highly recommend THE 13th DAY to family viewers, fans of faith & spirituality movies, and anyone else who would like to find out about the events of Fatima.",4,The Best Movie about the Miracle at Fatima,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,1434,"['far', 'best', 'cinematic', 'production', 'apparitions', 'Virgin', 'Mary', '3', 'children', 'fields', 'Fatima', 'Portugal', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Fatima', 'story', 'think', 'film', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'essentials', 'story', 'are', 'shown.What', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'period', 'details', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'etc', 'seemed', 'authentic', 'based', 'photos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previously', 'as', 'well', 'shown', 'movie', 'October', 'apparition', 'soundtrack', 'Black', 'White', 'film', 'medium', 'added', 'mood', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'apparitions', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'portrayed', 'actual', 'events', 'October', '13th', 'day', 'tasteful', 'yet', 'realistic', 'manner.One', 'flaw', 'seemed', 'significant', 'was', 'children', 'hardly', 'seemed', 'seriously', 'upset', 'threats', 'police', 'interrogator', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'director', 'intent', 'unlikely', '3', 'young', 'naive', 'peasant', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'knowing', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'would', 'react', 'so', 'impassively', 'threat', 'being', 'lowered', 'slowly', 'cauldron', 'boiling', 'oil', 'early', '1900s', 'great', 'war', 'World', 'War', 'raged', 'European', 'continent', 'government', 'officials', 'especially', 'local', 'police', 'were', 'feared', 'most', 'people.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', '13th', 'DAY', 'family', 'viewers', 'fans', 'faith', 'spirituality', 'movies', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'find', 'out', 'events', 'Fatima']",N/A

Although it muddles and compresses many events, it does present some main ideas very effectively: the reality of the apparitions, the faith of the children, their resistance to parental and secular opposition, and the Miracle of the Sun. I found the movie to be quite impressive and very moving in parts. However, I had some problems with it:* the actress playing 10 year old Lucia Santos, while very good, seemed a bit too old for the part.* at the death of Jacinta, a tear of blood is shown flowing from her eye. I'm not aware of any account of that happening. Its depiction seems unnecessary and grotesque.* the depiction of the Miracle of the Sun, while impressive, was made to appear absolutely horrific in its final stage when the sun appeared to head towards the earth. Although some people did report being frightened by the spectacle, this movie shows the majority of the crowd fleeing in terror, as if they were in some Godzilla movie.* The secrets of Fatima are dealt with so perfunctorily that one might miss them if they weren't paying attention. After all, weren't the heavenly warnings the main point of the Fatima apparitions, and not the impressive light show? Also, since the Third Secret of Fatima was never truly revealed, the movie chooses to dramatize the almost unbelievably shabby and implausible forgery the Vatican fabricated in 2000, of a bishop in white walking through a ruined city. Anyone with the least familiarity with this issue will see at first glance that it was not for this paltry imagery that the Vatican had kept the Third Secret under lock and key for 4 decades, in direct disobedience of our Lady's command. No, the Third Secret is so dangerous that the men in charge in Rome are still running scared.So, by emphasizing the experience and de-emphasizing the message, and by taking the Vatican's official version as their starting point, the film makers have detracted from the full import of Fatima.

1276169,A1G6NL5AQMZDAC,B002LDCZCU,Ludix,"[16, 22]","This is the fifth feature-length dramatization of the Fatima story.The first, THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA (Warner Brothers, 1951), is a shamelessly sentimental Hollywood tear-jerker. Despite many serious flaws and inaccuracies, it recounts the basic facts in an entertaining way, and builds up to a genuinely moving climax that communicates the spiritual import of the story. This is the movie I loan to people who know little or nothing about Fatima.In the same year, a Spanish feature, LE SENORA DE FATIMA, told the tale with similar sentimentality and inaccuracy, on an even lower budget.The third, APPARITIONS AT FATIMA (1992), is the film that is shown (in several languages) at the tourist theater in the Sanctuary of Fatima. It was filmed entirely in Portugal at the actual locations, using Portuguese talent. The actors cast as the children are dead ringers! It includes the ""angel"" visitations reported by Lucia years after the main events, and is more faithful to the facts than the Hollywood version. Unfortunately, the pacing is often very slow, and the low budget and feeble special effects make the apparitions and climax seem somewhat less than miraculous. This a worthwhile choice for viewers already familiar with Fatima who don't need to be entertained or impressed.The fourth, FATIMA (1996), a Portuguese-Italian TV production, is burdened with a leaden script and mediocre effects.THE 13TH DAY is the latest attempt, and a very strange film indeed. Created on a modest budget by Ian and Dominic Higgins, a pair of British illustrators, it looks like a graphic novel about vampires, and plays like a Gothic music video.Anyone unfamiliar with the Fatima story will have a hard time following this version. The events are related in flashback as Lucia recalls them twenty years later, narrated in her adult voice. The exposition is fragmented; locations and characters are not always clearly identified. Many of the interiors look exactly the same: bare rooms with whitewashed walls. Where are we? Who is that talking? It's often hard to be sure.The actress playing Lucia (Filipa Fernandes) is clearly too old to portray a 10-year-old girl. She and the other two children (Ana-Sofia Vilas Boas as Jacinta, Vitor Machado as Francisco) are practically expressionless throughout the film, seemingly disengaged from the drama around them. Jane Lesley steals the show as Lucia's mother. Terek Merlin is an odd casting choice for the villain, Arturo Santos; instead of projecting malice, he seems pensive, half-asleep, and as emotionally uninvolved as the children he is threatening. The whole cast feels under-directed.Most of the presentation is in black and white, with occasional flashes of color, usually (but not consistently) used to highlight ""spiritual"" moments. Every shot is a careful, deliberate visual composition. This is admirable when done unobtrusively (see Kubrick, Visconti), but tedious and annoying when it draws attention to itself, as it does throughout this film. The degree of stylization is occasionally ludicrous. Every sky churns with boiling clouds, every forest is mottled with spooky shadows. It's like watching a TV commercial for some dark, sinister product that is never named.Obvious care went into the special effects. The first appearance of the ""lady"" is very luminous and beautiful. Too bad the children react as if they're watching a mildly interesting puppet show instead of the glorious vision being shown onscreen.The big money scene is, of course, the Miracle of the Sun. This begins well, with thrilling images that convincingly reproduce the solar ""dance"" described by some of the eyewitnesses. But things get silly as it takes on the aspect of a giant earthquake, with shaking cameras and cartoonish whooshings and rumblings as the sun ""descends"" from the sky. It comes across more like a cheap disaster movie than a spiritual event.For all its technical sophistication, this Miracle of the Sun is neither as powerful nor as moving as the 1951 Warner version. The weak storytelling just doesn't lead up to it as effectively.People interested in the Fatima story will certainly want to see this film. But the material deserves better treatment. Someday, a director will come along with the right combination of taste, restraint, budget and showmanship to bring this powerful story to life for a new generation.It's time, Mel.",3,"Some interesting moments, but too stylish for its own good",1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,4388,"['fifth', 'feature-length', 'dramatization', 'Fatima', 'story.The', 'first', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'OF', 'OUR', 'LADY', 'OF', 'FATIMA', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '1951', 'shamelessly', 'sentimental', 'Hollywood', 'tear-jerker', 'many', 'serious', 'flaws', 'inaccuracies', 'basic', 'facts', 'entertaining', 'way', 'up', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'climax', 'spiritual', 'import', 'story', 'movie', 'loan', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'nothing', 'Fatima.In', 'same', 'year', 'Spanish', 'feature', 'LE', 'SENORA', 'DE', 'FATIMA', 'told', 'tale', 'similar', 'sentimentality', 'inaccuracy', 'even', 'lower', 'budget.The', 'third', 'APPARITIONS', 'AT', 'FATIMA', '1992', 'film', 'shown', 'several', 'languages', 'tourist', 'theater', 'Sanctuary', 'Fatima', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'Portugal', 'actual', 'locations', 'using', 'Portuguese', 'talent', 'actors', 'cast', 'children', 'are', 'dead', 'ringers', 'angel', 'visitations', 'reported', 'Lucia', 'years', 'main', 'events', 'more', 'faithful', 'facts', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Unfortunately', 'pacing', 'often', 'very', 'slow', 'low', 'budget', 'feeble', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'apparitions', 'climax', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'less', 'miraculous', 'worthwhile', 'choice', 'viewers', 'already', 'familiar', 'Fatima', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'entertained', 'impressed.The', 'fourth', 'FATIMA', '1996', 'Portuguese-Italian', 'TV', 'production', 'burdened', 'leaden', 'script', 'mediocre', 'effects.THE', '13TH', 'DAY', 'latest', 'attempt', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'indeed', 'Created', 'modest', 'budget', 'Ian', 'Dominic', 'Higgins', 'pair', 'British', 'illustrators', 'graphic', 'novel', 'vampires', 'plays', 'Gothic', 'music', 'video.Anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'Fatima', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'following', 'version', 'events', 'are', 'related', 'flashback', 'Lucia', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'narrated', 'adult', 'voice', 'exposition', 'fragmented', 'locations', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'clearly', 'identified', 'Many', 'interiors', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', 'bare', 'rooms', 'whitewashed', 'walls', 'Where', 'are', 'Who', 'talking', 'often', 'hard', 'be', 'sure.The', 'actress', 'playing', 'Lucia', 'Filipa', 'Fernandes', 'clearly', 'too', 'old', 'portray', '10-year-old', 'girl', 'other', 'two', 'children', 'Ana-Sofia', 'Vilas', 'Boas', 'Jacinta', 'Vitor', 'Machado', 'Francisco', 'are', 'practically', 'expressionless', 'film', 'seemingly', 'disengaged', 'drama', 'Jane', 'Lesley', 'show', 'Lucia', 'mother', 'Terek', 'Merlin', 'odd', 'casting', 'choice', 'villain', 'Arturo', 'Santos', 'instead', 'projecting', 'malice', 'pensive', 'half-asleep', 'emotionally', 'uninvolved', 'children', 'threatening', 'whole', 'cast', 'feels', 'under-directed.Most', 'presentation', 'black', 'white', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'color', 'usually', 'not', 'consistently', 'used', 'highlight', 'spiritual', 'moments', 'shot', 'careful', 'deliberate', 'visual', 'composition', 'admirable', 'when', 'done', 'unobtrusively', 'see', 'Kubrick', 'Visconti', 'tedious', 'annoying', 'when', 'attention', 'film', 'degree', 'stylization', 'occasionally', 'ludicrous', 'Every', 'sky', 'churns', 'boiling', 'clouds', 'forest', 'mottled', 'spooky', 'shadows', 'watching', 'TV', 'commercial', 'dark', 'sinister', 'product', 'never', 'named.Obvious', 'care', 'went', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'appearance', 'lady', 'very', 'luminous', 'beautiful', 'Too', 'bad', 'children', 'react', ""'re"", 'watching', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'puppet', 'show', 'instead', 'glorious', 'vision', 'being', 'shown', 'onscreen.The', 'big', 'money', 'scene', 'course', 'Miracle', 'Sun', 'well', 'thrilling', 'images', 'convincingly', 'reproduce', 'solar', 'dance', 'described', 'eyewitnesses', 'things', 'get', 'silly', 'aspect', 'giant', 'earthquake', 'shaking', 'cameras', 'cartoonish', 'whooshings', 'rumblings', 'sun', 'descends', 'sky', 'more', 'cheap', 'disaster', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'event.For', 'technical', 'sophistication', 'Miracle', 'Sun', 'powerful', 'as', 'moving', '1951', 'Warner', 'version', 'weak', 'storytelling', 'just', ""n't"", 'lead', 'up', 'effectively.People', 'interested', 'Fatima', 'story', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'material', 'better', 'treatment', 'Someday', 'director', 'will', 'come', 'right', 'combination', 'taste', 'restraint', 'budget', 'showmanship', 'bring', 'powerful', 'story', 'life', 'new', 'generation.It', 'time', 'Mel']",N/A

The language is English.""The Miracle of Our Lady  of Fatima""  available at Amazon and shown about yearly on TCM, is more of a Hollywood version of the historical event.  I always liked this movie and still do.  ""The 13th Day"" is a better retelling and more in keeping with the facts.The purposefully use of black-and-white  for most of the movie gives the movie the feel of something from 1917, with color parts of the movie used to highlight the  supernatural events.If you are not familiar with the historical facts, watch anyway and then if  you feel moved to learn more, watch the extra ""Message of Fatima"" which are multiple 20 minute segments from Fr. Apostoli; these are very good and fill in the gaps and provide a lot of good information.  For even more info, there are several books on the topic available from Amazon.The site of the visions, Fatima Portugal,  remains today a site of pilgrimage for millions (yes millions) of people each year.Other than the ""Message of Fatima"" mentioned above, and the theatrical trailer,  the other ""extras""  people mention in their reviews are contained in a booklet which is included with the DVD.  There are no other video extras.Movie does good job of depicting the attitude of the mother, the towns people, and the threats, deceptions and actions of the communist government officials in Portugal.The astronomical event seen by 30,000 to 70,000 people (numbers vary by who tells the story)  was one never seen before and has  never been seen again. (no spoiler here - lets just say it was incredible! )  The event was witnessed by believers and skeptics.  The event was reported in several newspapers.  The event was even seen by people NOT  in Fatima.  Skeptics will say it was mass hypnotism, or some events explained by science. Or some say it was similar to when people see a figure in the clouds, or the shape or face of a religious figure in a tortilla.Yes the children were very poor and uneducated.  Yes, they were imprisoned and prayed with prisoners.  Yes, they were told and shown many prophetic things.Cons:Does not include  the visitations by an angel  preceding the events in 1917;  the children were ""educated"" by this  angel.The central theme associated with Fatima was not stressed enough.  I wish they gave the lady in white a voice, rather than a narration of what she said ....And the lady in white grew very sad and said: ""Do not offend the Lord our God any more, because He is already so much offended.  People must amend their lives, and ask forgiveness of their sins, if they wanted healings or conversions.""  Then rising into the air and opening her hands towards the sun ....On the day of the previously promised ""sign"" to add credence to the children's story, an astronomical event took place and it was pouring rain.

I hoped it would be good, and praise God, I am not disappointed. This movie, in my opinion, is the most honest retelling of the apparitions of Fatima.This DVD comes with optional subtitles in Spanish and a segment by Father Andrew Apostoli on the message of Fatima, its meaning and relevance today.The DVD comes with a 24 page colour booklet whick explains the film, the events at Fatima of 1917 (with a full paged black and white picture of Lucia, Francisco and Jacinta), a segment by Bishop Fulton Sheen, a message from the world apostolate of Fatima, a page on how to say the rosary, an interview with the recently deceased Father Robert Fox of the Fatima Family Apostolate, a 'Behind the Secenes' section, a written message by Fr. Apostoli, 3 prayers to O.L. of Fatima, one of which composed by Pope John Paul II and a few questions that act as a study guide.The movie is mostly shot in black and white with certain parts in full colour. I will not go on to explain when and where as it will ruin the whole cinematic experience. Lucia's role is very strong and she is prominent as it is narrated through her perception of the events. Jacinta's and Francisco's roles are mostly silent but their presence is nevertheless beautifully captured. And I know one question on everybody's mind would be 'What about the Miracle of the Sun'? Well, I can tell you, it is dramatic, magnificient and beautiful.a very realistic portrayal.A reviewer stated that he/she felt that the charachters were sketched in. I beg to differ. I think it was quite well done. The emotions are raw and one can actually feel the difficulties and suffering experienced by the children and their families. a second point made by the afore mentioned reviewer was that there were too mane 'close ups'. again, this in my humble point of view, only serves to enhance the drama and strength of the movie.My only disappointment about 'The 13th Day' was that the Apparitions of the Angel of Peace was omitted. A great pity, as this would have further moved this film a notch higher than its present position (which in my opinion, is already quite high!) and surpassed all other films that have dealt with this subject.This movie also captures certain little known events, that while one is watching it, would tend to write off as 'artistic licence'. However this is not the case , if you watch the segment by Fr. Apostoli.All in all, 'The 13th Day' is a great movie in spreading the message of Fatima, a wonderful tool in evangelization and spreading the devotion of the Rosary. It is a wonderful investment and am sure it will be treasured by every family for many years to come.",5,1917...93 years later!,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,2774,"['Ever', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '13th', 'Day', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'eagerly', 'awiting', 'release', 'DVD', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'praise', 'God', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'opinion', 'most', 'honest', 'retelling', 'apparitions', 'Fatima.This', 'DVD', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'segment', 'Father', 'Andrew', 'Apostoli', 'message', 'Fatima', 'meaning', 'relevance', 'today.The', 'DVD', '24', 'page', 'colour', 'booklet', 'whick', 'film', 'events', 'Fatima', '1917', 'full', 'paged', 'black', 'white', 'picture', 'Lucia', 'Francisco', 'Jacinta', 'segment', 'Bishop', 'Fulton', 'Sheen', 'message', 'world', 'apostolate', 'Fatima', 'page', 'how', 'say', 'rosary', 'interview', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Father', 'Robert', 'Fox', 'Fatima', 'Family', 'Apostolate', ""'Behind"", 'Secenes', 'section', 'written', 'message', 'Fr', 'Apostoli', '3', 'prayers', 'O.L', 'Fatima', 'one', 'composed', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'few', 'questions', 'act', 'study', 'guide.The', 'movie', 'mostly', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'certain', 'parts', 'full', 'colour', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'explain', 'when', 'where', 'will', 'ruin', 'whole', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Lucia', 'role', 'very', 'strong', 'prominent', 'narrated', 'perception', 'events', 'Jacinta', 'Francisco', 'roles', 'are', 'mostly', 'silent', 'presence', 'nevertheless', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'know', 'one', 'question', 'everybody', 'mind', 'would', 'be', ""'What"", 'Miracle', 'Sun', 'Well', 'can', 'tell', 'dramatic', 'magnificient', 'beautiful.a', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal.A', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'he/she', 'felt', 'charachters', 'were', 'sketched', 'beg', 'differ', 'think', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'emotions', 'are', 'raw', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'difficulties', 'suffering', 'experienced', 'children', 'families', 'second', 'point', 'made', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'was', 'were', 'too', 'mane', ""'close"", 'ups', 'again', 'humble', 'point', 'view', 'only', 'enhance', 'drama', 'strength', 'movie.My', 'only', 'disappointment', '13th', 'Day', 'was', 'Apparitions', 'Angel', 'Peace', 'was', 'omitted', 'great', 'pity', 'would', 'have', 'further', 'moved', 'film', 'notch', 'higher', 'present', 'position', 'opinion', 'already', 'quite', 'high', 'surpassed', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'dealt', 'subject.This', 'movie', 'also', 'certain', 'little', 'known', 'events', 'one', 'watching', 'would', 'tend', 'write', 'off', ""'artistic"", 'licence', 'However', 'not', 'case', 'watch', 'segment', 'Fr', 'Apostoli.All', '13th', 'Day', 'great', 'movie', 'spreading', 'message', 'Fatima', 'wonderful', 'tool', 'evangelization', 'spreading', 'devotion', 'Rosary', 'wonderful', 'investment', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'treasured', 'family', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A
