I really liked the way the director tells us that THE MEN's main theme is sexuality. Note that one of the first scenes of the film is the doctor's speech in front of twenty woMEN.

781842,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B0000EYUEI,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[5, 10]","Marlon Brando's first feature film, ""The Men"" tells the story of a group of injured veterans of WWII who try to put their lives together.  Overall I feel this is a well-done film, as it's not pretentious as many such films tend to be.  Brando turns in solid performance, even though at times he over-acts which makes his character less than believable.  The g/f character, unfortunately, is not very likeable; the actress never seems to get into the role, and there's little chemistry between her and Brando.  The best chacrater is Dr. Brock; it's probably because of my own exposure to such physicians that I find him very believable and powerful.In the end, the reason to watch this film is really to see Brando as a first-time feature actor.  He *is* good.  Many of the supporting actors are good, too; unfortunately the second half of the film seems too hurried and becomes shallow compared to the first half.  I think this is a movie not to be missed.",3,Still a good film despite unevenness,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,956,"['Marlon', 'Brando', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Men', 'story', 'group', 'injured', 'veterans', 'WWII', 'who', 'try', 'put', 'lives', 'together', 'Overall', 'feel', 'well-done', 'film', 'not', 'pretentious', 'many', 'such', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'Brando', 'solid', 'performance', 'even', 'times', 'character', 'less', 'believable', 'g/f', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'actress', 'never', 'get', 'role', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Brando', 'best', 'chacrater', 'Dr.', 'Brock', 'probably', 'own', 'exposure', 'such', 'physicians', 'find', 'very', 'believable', 'end', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'really', 'see', 'Brando', 'first-time', 'feature', 'actor', '*is*', 'good', 'Many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'unfortunately', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'too', 'hurried', 'shallow', 'compared', 'first', 'half', 'think', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
