It had good acting, good characters (mostly), and a simple story. I thought the beginning set up the movie very well w/the family sitting around watching the old tape with dad during his football days, mom in her cheer outfit, and the ex who at the time was w/dad. From the beginning, it's clear that something made Dad hold on to the memories of 'Ava,' and Mom is still a tad insecure about it. Well, Ava's back in town to bury her mother, and tensions begin. Not going to get too into the plot. It comes on Lifetime often enough if you're interested in checking it out. I ended up buying the dvd to check to see if there are deleted scenes included. I know some tv movies are actually longer on the dvd.I feel this movie could have been a little longer. I'd be interested in knowing what got edited. It seemed like there was a lot of build up, but the actual betrayal and breakdown of the family happened in the last 30-40 minutes. I did like the ending though w/Ben at Thanksgiving. I got the impression that things would eventually work out.",4,"Liked this one, but feel it should have been an hour longer (possible spoiler)",1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1162,"['edited', 'review', 'Eye', 'Em', 'Dee', 'Bee', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Lifetime', 'hit', 'miss', 'one', 'was', 'winner', 'had', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'characters', 'mostly', 'simple', 'story', 'thought', 'beginning', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'w/the', 'family', 'sitting', 'watching', 'old', 'tape', 'dad', 'football', 'days', 'mom', 'cheer', 'outfit', 'ex', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'w/dad', 'beginning', 'clear', 'something', 'made', 'Dad', 'hold', 'memories', ""'Ava"", 'Mom', 'still', 'tad', 'insecure', 'Well', 'Ava', 'back', 'town', 'bury', 'mother', 'tensions', 'begin', 'Not', 'going', 'get', 'too', 'plot', 'Lifetime', 'often', 'enough', ""'re"", 'interested', 'checking', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'dvd', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'know', 'tv', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'longer', 'dvd.I', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'what', 'got', 'edited', 'seemed', 'was', 'lot', 'build', 'up', 'actual', 'betrayal', 'breakdown', 'family', 'happened', 'last', '30-40', 'minutes', 'did', 'ending', 'w/Ben', 'Thanksgiving', 'got', 'impression', 'things', 'would', 'eventually', 'work', 'out']",Unanswered Prayers

It was so good about a loving family and the old fling who comes into their lives and how things get out of control by trying to live the past again. How an act can mess up a whole family. But it does end on a good note. Great acting and so true too not only the song, but to real life.
