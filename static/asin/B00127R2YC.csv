1135493,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B00127R2YC,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[0, 0]","It was 2008 and I had just finished watching the Darker Than Black anime which later became one of my favorites. When had an intense need to look for another anime series that would be just as great or maybe even more so. The parameter was set and was really in the mood for some action and a darker take in anime. A stark contrast to what currently has my attention in an anime series which is comedy and slice of life. Still at that time was looking for some action maybe some shounen. Black Cat came across and it was Shounen Jump anime. I wasn't sure how good it would turn out but once I saw a few episodes knew this was one phenomenal anime. The animation was so incredibly good but even the story. The characters too had their own subtle unique traits that made you truly care about them and just the overall story. It was quite the luck that FUNimation released a SAVE Edition of Black Cat which made me getting Black Cat one of my all time anime series favorites very affordable.Black Cat is all about , Train Heartnet, an assassin known as Black Cat that has always completed his assigned list of kills until he meets a woman bounty hunter named Saya who he deeply begins to care for who teaches him that if his heart is not in killing he shouldn't try to force himself. He begins to change his life around but because of his new decision his old life brings danger to his new one. Still even in such a dark world he lives in he eventually meets his new family.One of the top reasons will recommend this series to anime fans is due to the fact that the anime series has such a good soundtrack with the Opening Theme Song and Ending Theme Songs. Voice acting is very fitted to the characters in the English Dub in the voicing.If your an anime fan that likes anime with substance and good animation and good story such as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion than Black Cat is a good choice. The series is very affordable so that's a plus!A very good investment for anime watchers!-Find review also at The Huge Anime Fan",5,Black Cat worth the Buy,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2028,"['was', '2008', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'anime', 'later', 'became', 'one', 'favorites', 'When', 'had', 'intense', 'need', 'look', 'anime', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'great', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'parameter', 'was', 'set', 'was', 'really', 'mood', 'action', 'darker', 'take', 'anime', 'stark', 'contrast', 'what', 'currently', 'attention', 'anime', 'series', 'comedy', 'slice', 'life', 'Still', 'time', 'was', 'looking', 'action', 'maybe', 'shounen', 'Black', 'Cat', 'came', 'was', 'Shounen', 'Jump', 'anime', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'good', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'once', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'knew', 'was', 'one', 'phenomenal', 'anime', 'animation', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'good', 'even', 'story', 'characters', 'too', 'had', 'own', 'subtle', 'unique', 'traits', 'made', 'truly', 'care', 'just', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'luck', 'FUNimation', 'released', 'SAVE', 'Edition', 'Black', 'Cat', 'made', 'getting', 'Black', 'Cat', 'one', 'time', 'anime', 'series', 'very', 'affordable.Black', 'Cat', 'Train', 'Heartnet', 'assassin', 'known', 'Black', 'Cat', 'always', 'completed', 'assigned', 'list', 'kills', 'woman', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'named', 'Saya', 'who', 'deeply', 'care', 'who', 'heart', 'not', 'killing', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'force', 'change', 'life', 'around', 'new', 'decision', 'old', 'life', 'danger', 'new', 'one', 'Still', 'even', 'such', 'dark', 'world', 'eventually', 'new', 'family.One', 'top', 'reasons', 'will', 'recommend', 'series', 'anime', 'fans', 'due', 'fact', 'anime', 'series', 'such', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Opening', 'Theme', 'Song', 'Ending', 'Theme', 'Songs', 'Voice', 'acting', 'very', 'fitted', 'characters', 'English', 'Dub', 'voicing.If', 'anime', 'fan', 'anime', 'substance', 'good', 'animation', 'good', 'story', 'such', 'Code', 'Geass', 'Lelouch', 'Rebellion', 'Black', 'Cat', 'good', 'choice', 'series', 'very', 'affordable', 'plus', 'very', 'good', 'investment', 'anime', 'watchers', '-Find', 'review', 'also', 'Huge', 'Anime', 'Fan']",Black Cat: The Complete Series

I saw trailers that looked really awful, and things that look cliched... but, I was pleasantly mistaken.The series is amazing.  It has a rich and broad cast of a variety of characters, nods to other animes, such as Trigun, Evangelion, Outlaw Star, Dragon Ball Z, and Ranma 1/2, and though there are alot of typical anime cliches in it, they are all executed to the highest quality.The main characters do seem to be invincible though, and for some reason, ungodly amazing.  Its a common thing in anime, and it does make things a little less believable sometimes, like, why is X person so damn important that this is happening?  It also can bring down suspense, but not to the point where you care.  I can honestly say, that even though that may be a rather annoying point, I didn't even really notice until I read someones review and thought ""oh yeah... that IS true."" so yes, its true, but, it doesn't matter too much, if you ask me.  It doesn't seem to really HURT the series a great deal.The story is well thought out and goes together fluidly, not a single string left unwoven, and the ending is amazing, unexpected, and thrilling to the last moment.  The series is flawlessly both hilarious, and also heart warming and touching, without any missteps.  Though the beginning could have been built up better, its really a minor complaint, in a series that does not stop delivering!

1135497,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00127R2YC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","In a world that is just slightly different from our own, he's one of Chronos' Numbers, an elite assassin who's known for the XIII branded on his chest.Kentaro Yabuki had a pretty cool idea when he used that for his action/comedy manga ""Black Cat,"" all about the ex-Number's adventures as a sweeper (bounty hunter) and his attempts to save the world from his former partner. The anime is a mixed bag -- the overall story arc is scrambled up enthusiastically, but it's full of action and wild comedy (the white cat and his kisses!) and some thoroughly likable anti-heroes out to pay the bills.Sweeper Sven Vollfield is about to nab a notorious gangster when Train Heartnet, the notorious ""Black Cat,"" bursts in and kills the man and escapes before anyone can react. Elsewhere in the town, Train reluctantly befriends a perky young sweeper named Saya, who starts to make him change his views on killing and subservience. Just in time, since he's been ordered to kill a human bioweapon -- a little named named Eve, who Sven is determined to protect.Then Train breaks away from Chronos, declaring that he won't serve anyone. The Numbers attempt to kill him, and his ex-partner Creed attempts to lure him away -- saying that he plans to rule the world instead of Chronos. And to get Train, he'll kill the person Train holds dear.Some months later, Train is roaming with Sven and Eve as a newly minted sweeper, hunting down assorted bad guys for cash (but never killing them). Unfortunately Creed's organization ""The Apostles of the Star"" is giving criminals Tao water that gives them superpowers, and organizing a deadly company that is nearly unstoppable -- they can breathe fire, manipulate blood/wind/gravity, regenerate instantly, splinter concrete, and even open rips in space/time.But the mad Creed is still determined to have Train at his side. The Numbers and Train are both determined to hunt down and take out Creed before he can hurt anyone else, but the Apostles of the Star are a match for the Numbers. With his friends' help, he'll stop them.""Black Cat"" deviates pretty drastically from its original manga -- the over-arcing storyline is scrambled up and parts are removed, the characters are given bucketloads of angst, Train's motivations are dumbed down, the moral greyness is wiped clean, and the entire start of the series is radically different. And due to some random filler episodes (Train and Eve help a bunch of homeless kids?), the last fourth of the series unravels as it tries to cram way too much into too few episodes. And it even adds on an extra anime-only arc at the end, which is hideously anticlimactic and out of place -- and changes the grand finale drastically.Despite those flaws, ""Black Cat"" is a colorful action anime. There are brilliant acrobatic fight scenes, using weapon ranging from unbreakable guns to invisible swords, corrosive skin to a razor-sharp floating scarf -- and these can be pretty harrowing when they're personal for Train. The battles can get so explosive that one episode has an entire castle crumbling out from under the characters, but there are long stretches of contemplation and flashbacks.There's also a lot of angst in here, and a dark undertone runs through most of the series' characters -- even the perky ones have something unpleasant in their lives. Fortunately this is offset by a healthy dose of comic relief, usually from Sven or Train (""Everyone's in a panic over a stupid pet lizard, DAAAAAAHLING!""), and some straight-faced humor from Eve due to her limited experience with... well, just about everything.And the entire series is graced with shadowy, elaborate animation full of glowing roses, dark rooms, moonlit rooftops, harsh sunsets and rainy duels. Even dark nights include a luminous soft light.Train is a hero with a mildly split personality, since he seems to be either the angsty abused-killer-since-he-was-six gunman, or a delightfully goofy bounty hunter who can easily eat his own weight in food and milk. Sven serves as a good counterpoint -- an ex IBI agent with a magic eye and a perpetual ulcer over their bills. And the quiet, solemn Eve quickly grows from a ""killing machine"" to a naive little girl experiencing the world for the first time, along with enough books to overflow a library.Creed serves as a pretty creepy villain -- he's megalomaniacal, arrogant, and has a massive gay crush on Train based on his prowess as a killer. The Apostles and the Numbers are patchily characterize, but some of them stand out -- the elegant and smart Charden, teenybopper Kyoko, the flirtatious Jenos Hazard, and the beautiful master of disguise Lin Shaolee.""Black Cat"" pads itself with filler (why does Train's background take seven whole episodes?) and then rushes through its ending, but it's still an enjoyable action anime with some tragedy, comedy, and a little bit of romance.",3,I've come to deliver some bad luck,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,4866,"['world', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'own', 'one', 'Chronos',

1135503,A3F2VVGAVQLQ91,B00127R2YC,Kimberly Huebner,"[31, 32]","What can I say? This is one hell of a anime series! As one of probably only a few handful of people left who doesn't actually download or watch anime online, I was browsing Amazon looking to add some more anime to my collection, I ran across this one. It seemed interesting enough, so I thought I'd give it a try. Let's just say, when I sat down to watch it, (please excuse the awful pun, 'cuz I just can't help myself) it sunk its claws in & damn if I didn't end up wasting an entire Saturday in front of my TV because of it. Very few anime series have had that effect on me.Train Heartnet (aka Black Cat) is an eraser (assassin) for Chronos. He is number XIII. He does what he's told, when he's told & thinks nothing of it. That is until he meets Saiya & it causes him to rethink his beliefs & way of life. Sven has the misfortune to keep crossing paths with Black Cat.  Eventually they team up as partners to end the evil that is Creed Diskenth, his group the Apostles of the Star & other various villians. I really don't want to get too detailed in my review, as I don't want to ruin it for those who of you haven't seen it. Let me just say this: The story line is GREAT, the action is AWESOME, the heroes are heroic, the villians are deliciously villianous (Creed is an especially sick & twisted evil piece of work)& you will laugh your ass off (or, if your sense of humor in no way resembles mine, chuckle heartily) in several places. This is an anime that both guys & girls will enjoy.This collection consists of four DVDs with six episodes on each disc, housed in a clear plastic DVD case that is a bit thicker than a standard DVD case. The discs are arranged as two on each side with the discs overlapping a bit. It's NOT my favorite set up, but I suppose it could be worse. Textless beginning & ending songs & trailers are the only ""extras"".In short, I loved this series so much that I went back on Amazon & ordered the first run individual DVDs with the starter box. I definitely recommend this series for those who are just getting aquainted with anime, are fans of action anime, or those who just really don't have a lot to do & just want to take it easy & spend the day watching an really good anime.",5,"Curiosity Didn't Kill This Cat (It did,however, cause me to sit all day in front of my TV)",1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,2214,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'hell', 'anime', 'series', 'one', 'probably', 'only', 'few', 'handful', 'people', 'left', 'who', ""n't"", 'actually', 'download', 'watch', 'anime', 'online', 'was', 'browsing', 'Amazon', 'looking', 'add', 'more', 'anime', 'collection', 'ran', 'one', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'enough', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'please', 'excuse', 'awful', 'pun', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sunk', 'claws', 'damn', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'wasting', 'entire', 'Saturday', 'front', 'TV', 'Very', 'few', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'had', 'effect', 'me.Train', 'Heartnet', 'aka', 'Black', 'Cat', 'eraser', 'assassin', 'Chronos', 'number', 'XIII', 'what', 'told', 'when', 'told', 'nothing', 'Saiya', 'rethink', 'beliefs', 'way', 'life', 'Sven', 'misfortune', 'keep', 'crossing', 'paths', 'Black', 'Cat', 'Eventually', 'team', 'up', 'partners', 'end', 'evil', 'Creed', 'Diskenth', 'group', 'Apostles', 'Star', 'other', 'various', 'villians', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'detailed', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'story', 'line', 'GREAT', 'action', 'AWESOME', 'heroes', 'are', 'heroic', 'villians', 'are', 'deliciously', 'villianous', 'Creed', 'especially', 'sick', 'twisted', 'evil', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'laugh', 'ass', 'off', 'sense', 'humor', 'way', 'mine', 'chuckle', 'heartily', 'several', 'places', 'anime', 'guys', 'girls', 'will', 'enjoy.This', 'collection', 'four', 'DVDs', 'six', 'episodes', 'disc', 'housed', 'clear', 'plastic', 'DVD', 'case', 'bit', 'thicker', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'discs', 'are', 'arranged', 'two', 'side', 'discs', 'overlapping', 'bit', 'NOT', 'favorite', 'set', 'up', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'Textless', 'beginning', 'ending', 'songs', 'trailers', 'are', 'only', 'extras', '.In', 'short', 'loved', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'back', 'Amazon', 'ordered', 'first', 'run', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'starter', 'box', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'aquainted', 'anime', 'are', 'fans', 'action', 'anime', 'who', 'just', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'just', 'want', 'take', 'easy', 'spend', 'day', 'watching', 'really', 'good', 'anime']",Black Cat: The Complete Series

He was correct, but amazon proved him wrong. I didn't do anything about this though because I was too busy watching this awesome series that I fell in love with just becuase of the name.I am a cat lover and so Train instantly made my heart go doki doki. Anyways the story is about Train and how he's part of this organization in which he goes around and assasinates bad guys. He never misses and always completes his mission in a timely manner. So what's the actual story line? That comes in when a new cat arrives in town by the name of Sven. He's a gentleman who smokes and always seems to be broke and he's out to help some girl with long blond hair who happens to be Train's next target.So what's so big about Black Cat that sets it apart from any other awesome anime adventure? I dont really know, I just love the name and love the series. Black Cat brings to us a series of awesome killings from huge buff dudes with green afros, to our main bad guy who has a sword that no one can see. The entire show is all about Train getting revenge and us watching this and learning about him. It brings to the plate a full serving of humor that could make soda come flyign out of your nose, but don't worry the show has it's serious moments as well. I will say that I don't reccomend watching this one in front of your parents due to the fact that a busty girl seems to flaunt her chest openly with low cut dresses and other ways, even if there is no real nudity, my parents got ofended.",4,"Black Cats, Green hair. and tons of trouble",1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1764,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'ordered', 'one-day', 'shipping', 'Sunday', 'got', 'Wednesday', 'when', 'said', 'would', 'arrive', 'Tuesday', 'when', 'pointed', 'UPS', 'man', 'dog', 'attacked', 'said', 'say', 'anything', 'package', 'was', 'correct', 'amazon', 'proved', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'watching', 'awesome', 'series', 'fell', 'love', 'just', 'becuase', 'name.I', 'am', 'cat', 'lover', 'so', 'Train', 'instantly', 'made', 'heart', 'go', 'doki', 'doki', 'story', 'Train', 'how', 'part', 'organization', 'around', 'bad', 'guys', 'never', 'always', 'mission', 'timely', 'manner', 'what', 'actual', 'story', 'line', 'when', 'new', 'cat', 'town', 'name', 'Sven', 'gentleman', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'broke', 'out', 'help', 'girl', 'long', 'blond', 'hair', 'who', 'be', 'Train', 'next', 'target.So', 'what', 'so', 'big', 'Black', 'Cat', 'apart', 'other', 'awesome', 'anime', 'adventure', 'dont', 'really', 'know', 'just', 'love', 'name', 'love', 'series', 'Black', 'Cat', 'series', 'awesome', 'killings', 'huge', 'buff', 'dudes', 'green', 'afros', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'sword', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'entire', 'show', 'Train', 'getting', 'revenge', 'watching', 'learning', 'plate', 'full', 'serving', 'humor', 'could', 'make', 'soda', 'come', 'flyign', 'nose', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'show', 'serious', 'moments', 'well', 'will', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'watching', 'one', 'front', 'parents', 'due', 'fact', 'busty', 'girl', 'flaunt', 'chest', 'openly', 'low', 'cut', 'dresses', 'other', 'ways', 'even', 'real', 'nudity', 'parents', 'got', 'ofended']",Black Cat: The Complete Series
1135506,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00127R2YC,maskedgamer,"[1, 2]","I caught Black Cat on the funimation Channel. They play this anime 24/7. I've seen this series about 3-4 times now. I did enjoy watching Black Cat, it was a pretty good action anime, but it really has that run of the mill been there done that vibe to it. So let me break it down for you.First you have ""Train Heartnet"" probably the worse anime name, but atleast his alternative is a bit better as Black Cat. Train is the typical gun slinging hero. He's invincible when he has his gun in his hand, and no one can touch him. As soon as you grabs his piece and starts firing away nothing in his sights are safe. Hmmm this sounds like someone else I know... let me think... How about ""TRIGUN!"" Ah yes, I've seen this all before. There's a gun slinging bad guy, and a specialized organization of marksmen and assisans with unique abilities are out to get the gun slinging hero. Yes, been there done that. Matter of fact there  really aren't too many differences. People in this anime are as scared of hearing the name ""Black Cat"" as people in ""Trigun"" were affraid of hearing ""Vash the Stampede"". Too many similarities... just too coincidental.Then we have the other characters.EVE, who is the quiet put super powerful little girl. Now her character is kind of new because of her abilities, but the reserved quiet girl/ ultimate killer routine has been done over to death. Although the spin in black cat is that Eve does not want to fight, she just wants to be a normal girl. That is what sets the tone apart, so really she is a likeable character.Then we have Rinslet Walker. She is the much done over materialistic glamour girl with a loud mouth and a passion for money. She is pretty much ""Bulma from DBZ"", although she is a theif so she reminds me alot of ""Rose Anderson"" from Solty rei(wich is an awsome Anime btw!),actually she is alot like Rose only slightly less chatty.But, we have all seen this type of character before. Just because Rinslet is so cliche, her character is really predictable.Next we have Sven Vollfied, Now he should be the main characters best friend and come to aid him with his gun (in this case a briefcase) when needed, but Sven is actually like a dual main character. I like Sven alot and he really makes the show worth watching. He is not as powerful as Black Cat, but he has 100% more personality which makes him that much more interesting to watch. It feels at times in the Anime that Black cat takes a back seat to Sven, which I think is a good thing.Then lets add in Kyoko, She is the quirky girl with an rediculous crush on the main character black cat. She will stop at nothing to gain his love and affection. He is all she dreams of, and she will do anything to be by his side. Pretty much she is the ""unwanted"" admirer in any anime.Last but not least the Evil Villian ""Creed Diskenth"". This guy is every evil villian ever. He is a phsycopath, he has a passion/hate for the main character, he runs an organization that plans to take over the world, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, which includes him expirementing on his own body. All I can say is seen it! seen it! seen it! Nothing is new about this guy. I can't even hardly began to compare him to villians from other anime's because the list would just be too long. He is that Cliche. The one thing I can say that's different about him is that he has a sword with an invisible blade, but I'm quite sure someone on ""Bleach"" has the same thing.I think by far the thing that mostly makes this anime easy to forget or look over is the fact that the characters or so very unoriginal. They really don't stand out at all because you've already seen them in shows 100 times before. The only memorable characters that stands out is Sven & Eve. The only thing that sets this anime apart from being every other anime ever is it's plot.The plot basicly is another dual one. On one side we have the Organizations of Assasins trying to come after the main character because he left their group. They either want him to come back, or they will stop at nothing to kill him. SEEN IT!Then we have the good guys rescuing a girl from the bad guys only to find out that this girl has been misstreated by life, so the good guys go out their way to show her how great life can be. SEEN IT!How about this? There is an evil group of rebels with unique abilities that want to take over the world, and they are lead by a mentally unstable phsycopath. SEEN IT!Ok, lets try this... The little girl they rescued isn't just a little girl but she has a unique ability that the bad guys are after because her powers can be used to take over the world. I'm not even going to go there.Now the new interesting element added to the plot is the heavy science fiction with the nano technology. That is something new and interesting, and does stand out quite a bit in this anime. I give Black Cat the points for doing something different along those lines.Overall Black Cat is an OK anime to watch. It's not bad, but it's not exactly something new. It doesn't really stand out, and there aren't really  that many highlights about it just because it's ideas have been done to death. It's worth watching if you come across it by chance. As far as buying it, if the price is right sure, but I wouldn't go out my way to get it.",3,Very Cliche but OK to watch,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,5285,"['caught', 'Black', 'Cat', 'funimation',

He is a master gunman and an emotionless, cold blooded killer, until the sweeper (bounty hunter) Saya enters his life and teaches how to feel again. He leaves Chronos and becomes a sweeper, trying to mend his past mistakes. Unfortunately, his past won't leave him alone, and he learns that a former co-worker of his has decided he wants to rule the world, and he wants Train to join him.A few years ago I read all 20 volumes of manga (yes, on the computer, I am buying them now to make up for it) and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. So when I found out that the anime was getting a legal release, I was excited. I bought the set and watched it with my sisters. It was entertaining to watch, though at 24 episodes, they couldn't fit the content of all 20 volumes. Normally anime adaptions of this length cover between 6-8 volumes of the source materiel. Rather than just covering the first few volumes and leave it hanging, the TV writers took the important storyline and rewrote it to fit into 20 episodes (the last four episodes were obviously written when the writers were drunk or on drugs and had no business being included). I thought this was a wise move on their part, but I did miss the depth that manga gave to the characters and story. Train is extremely likable character. Like several popular heros before him (Vash, Kenshin), he has the sort of split personality thing, where most of the time he is a goofy, lovable, harmless seeming guy, but when threatened he becomes calm and competent. This leads to both good comedy and good drama. The characters are all interesting, and Creed is pretty good bad guy.My sisters and I all enjoyed this anime, so I would recommend it. But it is a little confusing at times, and for some reason filled with fillers (excluding the end arc, they aren't that bad). So it hovers between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I settled on 4 in honor of the original manga.I watched this series in Japanese, and the voice actors did a great job. The soundtrack did a good job of setting the mood. The art and animation were well done.Other titles that might be of interest:Darker Than Black,Fullmetal Alchemist, andTrigun.",4,13 + Black Cat = Bad Luck,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2262,"['Train', 'Heartnet', 'assassin', 'known', 'Black', 'Cat', 'who', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'Chronos', 'master', 'gunman', 'emotionless', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'sweeper', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Saya', 'life', 'how', 'feel', 'again', 'Chronos', 'sweeper', 'trying', 'mend', 'past', 'mistakes', 'Unfortunately', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'former', 'co-worker', 'decided', 'rule', 'world', 'Train', 'join', 'him.A', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'read', '20', 'volumes', 'manga', 'yes', 'computer', 'am', 'buying', 'now', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'anime', 'was', 'getting', 'legal', 'release', 'was', 'excited', 'bought', 'set', 'watched', 'sisters', 'was', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'though', '24', 'episodes', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'content', '20', 'volumes', 'Normally', 'anime', 'adaptions', 'length', 'cover', '6-8', 'volumes', 'source', 'materiel', 'Rather', 'just', 'covering', 'first', 'few', 'volumes', 'leave', 'hanging', 'TV', 'writers', 'took', 'important', 'storyline', 'rewrote', 'fit', '20', 'episodes', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'obviously', 'written', 'when', 'writers', 'were', 'drunk', 'drugs', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'included', 'thought', 'was', 'wise', 'move', 'part', 'did', 'miss', 'depth', 'gave', 'characters', 'story', 'Train', 'extremely', 'likable', 'character', 'several', 'popular', 'heros', 'Vash', 'Kenshin', 'sort', 'split', 'personality', 'thing', 'where', 'most', 'time', 'goofy', 'lovable', 'harmless', 'seeming', 'guy', 'when', 'threatened', 'calm', 'competent', 'good', 'comedy', 'good', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Creed', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'guy.My', 'sisters', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'would', 'recommend', 'little', 'confusing', 'times', 'reason', 'filled', 'fillers', 'excluding', 'end', 'arc', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', '3', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'settled', '4', 'honor', 'original', 'manga.I', 'watched', 'series', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'art', 'animation', 'were', 'well', 'done.Other', 'titles', 'might', 'be', 'interest', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'andTrigun']",Black Cat: The Complete Series
1135512,AFV2584U13XP3,B00127R2YC,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[9, 14]",I just got this a couple of days ago from SunCoast and have found myself to be astounded by this great series the plot you read from Amazon gives some info but more of the storyline is that Train Heartnet an assassin for the mysterious Chronos group who give him assignments to kill off anyone they see as an evil influence on the world than a Sweeper(Bounty Hunter for an easy description)by the name of Saya starts awakening his lost humanity and compassion this starts him questioning the missions that Chronos has him do.The final part is a job he has to do kill the bio-weapon EVE that they see as a threat to humanity but Train instead lets her live an decides to leave Chronos for good along the way he joins Sven Volfield another sweeper Sven who has also decided during one of his missions to protect Eve.There is of course more to the series but you will have to see that for yourself what I found intriguing is the conceptof the Chronos group that has them saying that to protect the world and give people the right to freedom and for good to stay strong that they must commit evil acts.I say this brings to mind many political and religious groups that have said the same thing and it seems a little hypocritical of these groups saying to battle evil or corruption we must use the same methods.I love how Funimation has once again found great voice actors as well as the great japanese voice actors the video format is widescreen and you have 5.1 english audio or 2.0 japanese audio the extras sadly aren't much you mostly just get trailers the series has comedic moments in it great action sequences and a great music track this series is perfect for any action anime fan,5,Another Great Anime From Gozo&Funimation,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,1684,"['just', 'got', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'SunCoast', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'astounded', 'great', 'series', 'plot', 'read', 'Amazon', 'info', 'more', 'storyline', 'Train', 'Heartnet', 'assassin', 'mysterious', 'Chronos', 'group', 'who', 'give', 'assignments', 'kill', 'off', 'anyone', 'see', 'evil', 'influence', 'world', 'Sweeper', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'easy', 'description', 'name', 'Saya', 'awakening', 'lost', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'questioning', 'missions', 'Chronos', 'do.The', 'final', 'part', 'job', 'do', 'kill', 'bio-weapon', 'EVE', 'see', 'threat', 'humanity', 'Train', 'instead', 'live', 'decides', 'leave', 'Chronos', 'good', 'way', 'Sven', 'Volfield', 'sweeper', 'Sven', 'who', 'also', 'decided', 'one', 'missions', 'protect', 'Eve.There', 'course', 'more', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'found', 'intriguing', 'conceptof', 'Chronos', 'group', 'saying', 'protect', 'world', 'give', 'people', 'right', 'freedom', 'good', 'stay', 'strong', 'must', 'commit', 'evil', 'acts.I', 'say', 'mind', 'many', 'political', 'religious', 'groups', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'little', 'hypocritical', 'groups', 'saying', 'battle', 'evil', 'corruption', 'must', 'use', 'same', 'methods.I', 'love', 'how', 'Funimation', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'great', 'voice', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'video', 'format', 'widescreen', 'have', '5.1', 'english', 'audio', '2.0', 'japanese', 'audio', 'extras', 'sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'mostly', 'just', 'get', 'trailers', 'series', 'comedic', 'moments', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'music', 'track', 'series', 'perfect', 'action', 'anime', 'fan']",Black Cat: The Complete Series
1135513,A217YVBBC6JOTC,B00127R2YC,"Safariangel ""safariangel""","[3, 4]","I got to say it was a great series, plot, art, voice acting just awesome, no real extras, but alittle to fast on the episodes ploting.Funimation does it again by picking another great series and great actors for the series. It is great don't get me wrong but the series ended to fast for me. I think they could of done at least 4-8 more episodes for the right closure of the series. But that's how most of the anime is now and then, they just get a short time to make the series. So I'm not to mad about it. This is a awesome series and anime and the manga is great too.Well when you watch the first episodes you just get hooked it was just man I couldn't stop watchng it. I just got this series a week ago and watched the whole series in one day. On my only day off man. I couldn't stop watching it. I didn't even go shoot pool and drink with my friends like I do on my day off. Man was they mad dude. :P.Anyways Train is not like Samurai X ok. If Everybody wanted to say someone was copying someone. Everyone has a idea of1) A girl and guy meets, boy and girl don't like each other, later boy and girl slowly fall in love.2) Boy and girl long time friends and find out they was in love.3) Boy and girl meet and girl falls in love with boy, Boy doesn't like girl but later realize he loves her more than he know.4) Boy and girl fall in love and have to fight to stay together.5) Boy and girl fall in love, girl dies or boy dies, then wants revenge or saver on one self.Ok you get it now right. Many series have the idea but the ploting of how and what happens in the time of all this is what makes it great. I was glad to see Saya for a short time in the series. It was sad to see what happened to her. But understand this is not like samurai X just because it go's a different way of the idea. She is always with him in his mind and heart so you start to feel the pain more with him through out the series. It makes you understand truely what was happening to him and how he felt, even if he never said anything you can tell. As well the idea of what she did in the time she was with him. Even after she is gone. It is alittle sad only on that. Nothing else really is sad in this series to me. I fell in love with everyone in this series and it was sad to see it end. I'm glad to see the anime of a manga set which is not yet complete to come alive. So check it out and it's not Kenshin dude, you just don't know what your talking about dude. Train weird name but he is so kwel man alot of the characters was so kwel, but he was just the best man. I like the name Black Cat too. ;p laterTHIS IS WELL WORTH TO WATCH AND THE MONEY, BUT I WOULD BUY IT SOME WHERE ELSE TO. SORRY AMAZON BUT I DO BUY MANGA FROM YOU. ;P",5,Funimation does it again.
