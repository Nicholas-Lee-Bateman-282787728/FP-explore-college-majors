1068811,A14Q6R4481YFFG,B000P6R6XS,Hinkle Goldfarb,"[2, 4]","Like Carlos Mencia, Mr. Lopez mines ethnic stereotypes not just of Mexicans (Mariachi music, illegal immigration, drinking, crime) but also of mostly-hypothetical WASPs (BlackBerries, Bluetooths, feng shui, Starbucks).  There's plenty of jokes about how Mexicans do all the dirty work Americans supposedly won't do (""Do you know who's rebuilding New Orleans?  FEMA - Find Every Mexican Available"").But Mr. Lopez actually shows pretty good range -- it's not just jokes based on ethnic stereotypes, but also matters as diverse as hirsute grooming, family problems and growing up poor.  He's actually funniest when he talks about the differences between his childhood and children growing up today:  ""Do you know what our `Lunchables' was?  Two weenies on a fork, over a stove!""  Overall, he has a few laugh out loud moments and is worth the time to watch, if not to purchase.",3,Solid entry in ethnic standup,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,873,"['Carlos', 'Mencia', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'just', 'Mexicans', 'Mariachi', 'music', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'drinking', 'crime', 'also', 'mostly-hypothetical', 'WASPs', 'BlackBerries', 'Bluetooths', 'feng', 'shui', 'Starbucks', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'how', 'Mexicans', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Americans', 'supposedly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Do', 'know', 'who', 'rebuilding', 'New', 'Orleans', 'FEMA', 'Find', 'Every', 'Mexican', 'Available', '.But', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'range', 'not', 'just', 'jokes', 'based', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'also', 'matters', 'as', 'diverse', 'hirsute', 'grooming', 'family', 'problems', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'actually', 'funniest', 'when', 'differences', 'childhood', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'today', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'Lunchables', 'was', 'Two', 'weenies', 'fork', 'stove', 'Overall', 'few', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'time', 'watch', 'not', 'purchase']",George Lopez - America's Mexican

Why comedians think that makes their material funny is beyond me.  I never would have bought it had I known the language he would use all the way through.

If any of you are buying this based on loving the TV series, you just need to be aware that it is not as family friendly as some of George's other material and certainly not as appropriate for younger ears as the TV show.

Anyone who wants an honest look at George's childhood and adult experiences will definitely find this a riot.  He talks about all the crazy and ironic stuff from a typical and traditional Mexican American family!  There are some big differences in the way different cultures think . . . and George is great at nailing the visual images in this regard!  Absolutely no fluff . . . and never a dull moment!!
