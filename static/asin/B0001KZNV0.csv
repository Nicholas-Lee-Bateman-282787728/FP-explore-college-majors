809397,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0001KZNV0,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[5, 5]","This is one of the best films I have ever seen that uses an art theme, here in a fictitious but plausible plot based on Tracy Chevalier's bestselling novel using one of Vermeer's most loved paintings as a central plot device.The detail in the film is exceptional, from the exquisite light that reminds us of Vermeer's work, to the costumes and set design, the atmosphere of 17th century Delft, where one can almost smell the stench from the canal where all the refuse is dumped, to Griet's hands, which look as if they have scrubbed many a cold, tile floor.Best of all is the mixing of the paint and glazes, done from stones, oils and many exotic materials, all in graceful containers.After many cast and director shifts, the final roster that was chosen is superb, and fate must have waited for just the right mix of actors and director, for one cannot imagine it better. Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the almost mute part of Griet, and Colin Firth is a manly and terrific Vermeer. Especially good is Essie Davis as Vermeer's needy wife Catherina, who knows she will never become a part of her adored husband's world, a world she doesn't understand or inspire.The melodic score by Alexandre Desplat, cinematography by the great Eduardo Serra, and directorial skills of Peter Webber all contribute to making this film a gem, one that as an artist I appreciate for its portrayal of Vermeer, and those glimpses into some of his rare (only 35 of his pieces are known) paintings, especially that enigmatic girl, wearing the now famous pearl earring.DVD extras include a music video (not sure what the relevance to the film is, other than it has Johansson in it), and a Sundance Channel production of the making of the film, centering on the set design and its authenticity.Total running time for the film is 100 minutes.",5,"lovely, quiet and atmospheric",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1821,"['one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'art', 'theme', 'here', 'fictitious', 'plausible', 'plot', 'based', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'using', 'one', 'Vermeer', 'most', 'loved', 'paintings', 'central', 'plot', 'device.The', 'detail', 'film', 'exceptional', 'exquisite', 'light', 'Vermeer', 'work', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'atmosphere', '17th', 'century', 'Delft', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'stench', 'canal', 'where', 'refuse', 'dumped', 'Griet', 'hands', 'look', 'have', 'scrubbed', 'many', 'cold', 'tile', 'floor.Best', 'mixing', 'paint', 'glazes', 'done', 'stones', 'oils', 'many', 'exotic', 'materials', 'graceful', 'containers.After', 'many', 'cast', 'director', 'shifts', 'final', 'roster', 'was', 'chosen', 'superb', 'fate', 'must', 'have', 'waited', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'actors', 'director', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'better', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'excellent', 'almost', 'mute', 'part', 'Griet', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'manly', 'terrific', 'Vermeer', 'Especially', 'good', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'Vermeer', 'needy', 'wife', 'Catherina', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'part', 'adored', 'husband', 'world', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'inspire.The', 'melodic', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'cinematography', 'great', 'Eduardo', 'Serra', 'directorial', 'skills', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'contribute', 'making', 'film', 'gem', 'one', 'artist', 'appreciate', 'portrayal', 'Vermeer', 'glimpses', 'rare', 'only', '35', 'pieces', 'are', 'known', 'paintings', 'especially', 'enigmatic', 'girl', 'wearing', 'now', 'famous', 'pearl', 'earring.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'music', 'video', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'relevance', 'film', 'other', 'Johansson', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'production', 'making', 'film', 'centering', 'set', 'design', 'authenticity.Total', 'running', 'time', 'film', '100', 'minutes']",N/A

Everyone has an angle,  as they used to say in 1940's gangster movies.Vermeer himself is no prize -- unable by the force of circumstances to act on his attraction to the servant girl,  he gives her not even a glance as she leaves his household in semi-disgrace,  even though she has (symbolically) given up her virginity to the artist and his painting.Yet,  from the interactions of all these morally compromised characters comes a fabulous work of art,  the painting we contemplate at the very end.

Approach with caution!Girl With a Pearl Earring was visually beautiful.  This film deserves every nomination it ever got for anything related to cinematography, costume, art direction and lighting.  Unfortunately, that's where its praise ends as far as I'm concerned.Although I had my problems with the book, I was able to recognize it as a fine achievement nonetheless and gave it five stars in a previous review.  Not so with the film version.  This movie is a very shallow interpretation of the themes, events and emotions presented in GWAPE the book.  The screenwriter(s) apparently ignored huge chunks of/ events in Griet's past life, a few characters and scenes in the plot's present time and rearranged elements of the story to their liking.  We don't see the maid Griet's little personality quirks that make her so unusual for her time, like a preoccupation with sanitary habits and a view of the world that is rather independent and unique.  We don't know about her sad family situation, in which her father lost his sight and his own artistic ability with it, her brother (with whom she was quite close once) left to apprentice as a tilemaker. We don't see the little dinner scenes in which her parents push her engagement with the butcher's son so that they can have meat.  Basically, we never meet the young woman named Griet, only a pale shadow of her.  The result of all this is great disappointment to anybody who's read the book beforehand, and a much more simplistic story that focuses on Griet's dilemma as a thwarted crush on her master, painter Vermeer -- rather than the thwarted romance with her true love, Art.If the movie had appeared to at least try, then failure would have been understandable.  I don't think readers generally expect a perfect interpretation of the written word into a visual medium like film.  But...the movie didn't even try.  The director, writers, team et al. cut the heart and soul of GWAPE to leave us with a very mediocre Hollywood romance set in a costumed historical time period.  All style and no substance.On the other hand, if you've not read the book, go ahead and see this movie.  It's not bad as a simple historical romance story, and as I've already said, it is beautiful to watch.

809408,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0001KZNV0,azindn,"[3, 5]","Introspective and ambiguous are the work of the brilliant 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. So little is known of his life that in translating it to the screen in the fictional account, The Girl With a Pearl Earring, the film at times seems equally filled with blank spaces. The story of a lowly scullery maid, Griet (Scarlett Johanson) whose family must send her to work in the chaotic and expanding Catholic family of the painter, Vermeer is stage for the drama of too many hens, too few roosters. Status and riches are the concerns of all who surround Vermeer including his shrewish but beautiful, vacuous wife and her ambitious, manipulative mother (Judy Parfit). While the lecherous attentions of Tom Wilkinson's character, a bourgeois patron whose purse forgives his boorish manners adds insult to the beauty of his Vermeer collection.Colin Firth as Vermeer is a posterboy for the passive-aggressive husband, loath to most of his household until Griet catches his attention by her ability to recognize the elements which motivate the painter -- quiet, and good color sense. This is not an overwhelming art film in the sense of angst, a la Van Gough, but it suggests Vermeer was motivated by something more than light and domestic interiors. As Firth presents the painter, he is a pawn between duty to provide for his always growing family, and his desire for someone to understand his attention to detail, color, and composition which Griet, in her silences seems to provide. While the quietness of both servant girl and painter infuriate some, it is the space provided by their quietness that is the most productive. Everything around the couple is cacophony except in the studio where the only sound that enters are the muffled noises below the floor.As Griet, Scarlett Johanson is compared visually to the sublime painting, but has little resemblance to the actual model who looks more like the French actress, Julie Delpy than Johanson. She is only competent in the role of tentative servant without conviction in several scenes where she is put upon by her betters. While Griet slaps the face of daughter, Cornellia, an evil brat whose own story -- the Bad Seed -- was yet to be written; Johanson often seems overwhelmed how to portray the passivity a maid in her situation was required. She simply displays deadpan for every emotion. Perhaps it is the Americanness of Johanson that shines through, but one half expects her to snap her gum and blast rap music from her iPod while cleaning Vermeers studio. She is simply too modern in her body movements to convey the 17th century with believability.What wins the film is the stunning cinematography that lights the dim house setting with scene after scene taken from Vermeer works.

Delft is wonderfully recreated based on the works of Vermeer and many other painters. The basic story line about a Calvinist girl warily going into a Bohemian artist household is fine, and Scarlett Johanson is very good, as is her butcher's apprentice boyfriend.The only problem is that this isn't Vermeer -- they should have simply used another name as in ordinary Roman a' clef novels such as The Sun Also Rises.  While we do not have a dense background on Vermeer, we do know enough to say he wasn't a broody British Heathcliff.  Painting wasn't his only gig nor even perhaps his main one -- he traded rugs & paintings & took over his dad's tavern.  He knew all the artists in town and painted himself as a happy camper at least 3 times we know of.  There is no reason to imagine his marriage and household wasn't happy, either -- it's an island of calm in 25 pics painted over 25 years.  I guess you can't slander the dead, but as they used to say in the old days, there oughta be a law.Colin Firth is otherwise fine as Heathcliff in this spin off of Wuthering Heights moved to Delft, and the rest of the cast as Heathcliff's batty family.  Remove the historicist pretension and the film works beautifully. Unfortunately, the cartooning of major artists is getting epedemic with films like Shakespeare in Love and Amadeus.

No. The film tries to look deeper into Vermeer's stunning painting by offering Chevalier's interpretation of who the young girl was. However, where the film succeeds is flexibly creating a tentative but emotionally explosive relationship between master and servant - Firth and Johansson.Set in 17th century in the Netherlands, the film begins calmly, carefully unravelling itself to the viewer so that one can absorb it visually and mentally. The pace can be seen as slow but this type of film needs that type of pace to make it work because if it was fast, how could we as the viewers enjoy the tentative, innocent and beautiful love that Griet and Vermeer share?Scarlett Johansson plays Griet, the quiet and demure Dutch maid that invokes anger, jealousy and confusion in Catherina's heart (Essie Davis) while indirectly capturing Johannes Vermeer's attention (Colin Firth) and Master van Ruijven sleazy eye (acted with pure sinisterness by Tom Wilkinson). In one aspect, what ensues makes the film very good in my eyes because it portrays the issues of the impressive supporting cast such as Cornelia's blatant antagonism towards Griet, Catherina's undeniable envy and Pieter's unrequited interest in Griet while simultaneously using them as a platform to present the perfect example of repressed love between two people who know that they are worlds apart.Johansson was simply magnificent in this film. I will be surprised and annoyed if she does not get an Oscar nomination because she played this part with such precision, it is hard to see another woman who could match her emotive performance.Firth always delivers but this time, he was sublime. Like Johansson in terms of intensity, Firth was outstanding as the pensive but caring painter who appeared as if he was preoccupied with a certain someone.The brilliance of this film does not only stem from the actors, the cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes and the soundtrack fits the shy mood of the film.Slight apprehension before walking into the cinema.

809418,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0001KZNV0,C. B Collins Jr.,"[6, 6]","This excellent film can be enjoyed at four different levels. Of course not every level is appreciated by all viewers, as evidenced by some of the reviews.The film can be viewed as a smoldering and mismatched romance; an essay on class difference and the loborious life of the 17th century for the poor; an art historical film; or a beautiful film that evokes Delft Holland in the 1600's with amazing grace and beauty.First, the young working girl, Griet, played very sensitively by Scarlett Johanssen, is caught between the attentions of a smoldering, moody Johannes Vermeer and a handsome butcher's assistant, who is her own age and class.  Colin Firth plays the part of Vermeer very well. He appreciates intelligence and beauty and he sees these qualities in Griet. She is gradually asked to assume more duties of the artist assistant as well as her duties cleaning the Vermeer home. Vermeer is married however with 5 or 6 kids (they keep popping up and it is hard to keep count). His aristocratic wife Maria grows more jealous of Griet as her husband's appreciation and attention toward Griet increase. When Maria is told by her oldest daughter that Vermeer has been secretly painting Greit's portrait as a commission from his patron, Master van Ruijven, she has a major melt-down which results in Griet being fired from her job and thus ending the budding love between Griet and Vermeer. This is a blessing. Now nothing should stand in the way of Griet's attraction with the butcher boy, her match in beauty, wit, class, and age.Second, the working poor in the 17th century never got a break. Cooking and cleaning consumed long 16 hour days. Since there was no refrigeration in spring, summer, and autumn, cooking was a daily ritual of buying food in the market, preparing it ;such as beheading the animals and skinning them before putting them on a work burning hearth.  Poor Greit sweeps, mops, cleans, scrubs,shops, cooks, serves table, feeds kids, etc all day long until she is allowed to sleep in a ratty basement or freezing attic. The film realistically captures the terrible amount of labor the working poor had to endure.Third, the films was excellent art history, explaining the camera obscura technique as well as giving a good explantion of the underpainting process that Vermeer used to create his small masterpieces. The range of pigments and the hard work of grinding the paint pigments into paint paste was very well done. Even the artists of the time had to labor just to produce the products they used in production of a painting.Fourth, the film itself is superbly beautiful. The slower pace captures the 17th century. The settings, both interior and exterior were beautiful and probably the best art direction of 2004.I hate mindless action films full of murder and sarcastic testosterone filled bullys ; so you can see my attraction to an intelligent and beautiful film.",5,Four ways to appreciate this beautiful film,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,2895,"['excellent', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'four', 'different', 'levels', 'course', 'not', 'level', 'appreciated', 'viewers', 'evidenced', 'reviews.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'smoldering', 'mismatched', 'romance', 'essay', 'class', 'difference', 'loborious', 'life', '17th', 'century', 'poor', 'art', 'historical', 'film', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Delft', 'Holland', '1600', 'amazing', 'grace', 'beauty.First', 'young', 'working', 'girl', 'Griet', 'played', 'very', 'sensitively', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'caught', 'attentions', 'smoldering', 'moody', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'handsome', 'butcher', 'assistant', 'who', 'own', 'age', 'class', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'part', 'Vermeer', 'very', 'well', 'intelligence', 'beauty', 'qualities', 'Griet', 'gradually', 'asked', 'assume', 'more', 'duties', 'artist', 'assistant', 'as', 'well', 'duties', 'cleaning', 'Vermeer', 'home', 'Vermeer', 'married', 'however', '5', '6', 'kids', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'hard', 'keep', 'count', 'aristocratic', 'wife', 'Maria', 'more', 'jealous', 'Griet', 'husband', 'appreciation', 'attention', 'Griet', 'increase', 'When', 'Maria', 'told', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Vermeer', 'been', 'secretly', 'painting', 'Greit', 'portrait', 'commission', 'patron', 'Master', 'van', 'Ruijven', 'major', 'melt-down', 'results', 'Griet', 'being', 'fired', 'job', 'thus', 'ending', 'budding', 'love', 'Griet', 'Vermeer', 'blessing', 'Now', 'nothing', 'should', 'stand', 'way', 'Griet', 'attraction', 'butcher', 'boy', 'match', 'beauty', 'wit', 'class', 'age.Second', 'working', 'poor', '17th', 'century', 'never', 'got', 'break', 'Cooking', 'cleaning', 'consumed', 'long', '16', 'hour', 'days', 'was', 'refrigeration', 'spring', 'summer', 'autumn', 'cooking', 'was', 'daily', 'ritual', 'buying', 'food', 'market', 'preparing', 'such', 'beheading', 'animals', 'skinning', 'putting', 'work', 'burning', 'hearth', 'Poor', 'Greit', 'sweeps', 'mops', 'cleans', 'scrubs', 'shops', 'cooks', 'serves', 'table', 'feeds', 'kids', 'etc', 'day', 'long', 'allowed', 'sleep', 'ratty', 'basement', 'freezing', 'attic', 'film', 'realistically', 'terrible', 'amount', 'labor', 'working', 'poor', 'had', 'endure.Third', 'films', 'was', 'excellent', 'art', 'history', 'explaining', 'camera', 'obscura', 'technique', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'good', 'explantion', 'underpainting', 'process', 'Vermeer', 'used', 'create', 'small', 'masterpieces', 'range', 'pigments', 'hard', 'work', 'grinding', 'paint', 'pigments', 'paint', 'paste', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Even', 'artists', 'time', 'had', 'labor', 'just', 'produce', 'products', 'used', 'production', 'painting.Fourth', 'film', 'superbly', 'beautiful', 'slower', 'pace', '17th', 'century', 'settings', 'interior', 'exterior', 'were', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'best', 'art', 'direction', '2004.I', 'hate', 'mindless', 'action', 'films', 'full', 'murder', 'sarcastic', 'testosterone', 'filled', 'bullys', 'can', 'see', 'attraction', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'film']",N/A

After reading all of the glowing reviews for it, though, I must say that I feel rather guilty for not rating it as highly. Understand, I have no set criterea for what makes a good movie, really. If it touches me or entertains me, if it shows me something I've never seen before or perhaps teaches me something, it was worth the time and money spent. In all honesty, I'm not sure that I can say that 'Girl With a Pearl Earring' did any of those things.The main reason for seeing it, I must admit, was to watch Colin Firth. He's a fine and compelling--not to mention often underrated--actor. And he has a wonderful knack for pulling off period characters. Plus, he does 'brooding' very well. And the second reason for seeing it was for its theme/concept. I love speculative fiction that involves art, though I've never read the novel upon which this movie is based. For the first reason I was paid back in spades. For the second...not so much.The movie's backdrop was spectacular. As other's have noted, the color and the light were just beautiful. A particular scene comes to mind--when Griet is walking with the butcher's son through what I suppose was some kind of park or forested area and the light was golden and subdued--and it was just so surreal and evocative...I felt like I could touch it as though that one scene was nothing more than a still, a canvas with paint that had been applied so lush and thick. But exquisite scenery couldn't help the pacing and even though the story needed to build slowly, it grew a bit tedious. Especially since a lot of the film is caught in some kind of hush. There is very little dialogue and even music is used sparingly.There is no denying the intimacy between Vermeer as portrayed by Firth and Griet. It was lovely to watch. But...I guess, for me, it wasn't enough that that intimacy stood as the substance of the film.By the time it drew to its conclusion, my companion was frustrated by its lack of, well, a conclusion. It is very open-ended and you are left to your own devices in figuring out what road Griet has taken. You are not entirely sure where it is ending and what has happened to many of the players. As I understand it, the book finishes a little bit more definitely than the film. For some, the obscurity of the ending could be a little bit of a put off.I wouldn't say that one should not see this movie. Though I can't say I would recommend it heartily either. I know that once the credits were scrolling by I felt nothing. I had no immediate response (which was odd because I thought I surely would) and I couldn't have given anyone a definite ""yes, I liked it"" or ""no, I didn't"" if they were to ask me right then.

At a time when the Dutch ruled much of the world and there was the emergence of the middle class, women and artists still walked a very fine line between working and poverty; marriage is not much different. Like in Vermeer's paintings, the movie luxuriates in the details of never-ending and labor-intensive housework, preparing a feast for a patron, knoodling of couples, treachery of benignly neglected children, grinding and mixing paints and even taking a puppy off the kitchen table. It effectively portrays all the dimensions of the erotic nature of possessing objects.  Vermeer's mother-in-law exclaims that they are all caught like a fly in a web, and the characters and direction weave that web visually and metaphorically through this seamless production.  Who gets caught in it?  Who doesn't? Griet's loving young suitor warns her to be careful not to get caught up in Vermeer's world, and he is talking to us too.  We remember who we are and why that painting speaks to us in 2004 as an allegory of the modern age. Do you remember that old problem about a house being on fire and you can only save one thing:  a cat or a masterpiece painting of the cat?  Well, Tracy Chevalier with her novel, Peter Webber and the cast and crew of this film found a way to save both.

Viewing the film on DVD, one could actually watch the entire piece with the sound turned completely off and enjoy it just as much...as has been said many times before; the film is like viewing a Vermeer painting in motion.Based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier of the same name, the story is a speculative exploration into the identity of the model of the famous Vermeer painting. A young woman from a poor family is forced to seek employment and finds work as a maid in the Vermeer household. A tacit love affair develops between Griet (Scarlett Johansson) and Vermeer (Colin Firth) though in a purely emotional and mental sense, as her appreciation of art, due to Griet's father being a painter, intrigues the master, and he begins to teach her about colour and the delicate skill of mixing paint to achieve just the right shade and depth. I loved the scene where Vermeer asks Griet to tell him the colour of the clouds in the sky. She responds with the answer, ""white"", to then observe more intently, to answer, ""Yellow, blue and grey..."" Vermeer is pleased with this answer.It is no wonder that the film won many awards and was Oscar nominated for art direction, set design and costume design because the historical accuracy and beauty in all three categories is simply astounding.In fact, viewing the DVD with a good friend, she would comment after a particular scene that she was sure she had seen ""that"" painting before. Going back over the film, one can almost detect past master works of that time. It would be interesting to investigate this further and possibly connect certain scenes with actual paintings of the period.The soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat, also nominated for many awards including the Oscar for The Queen (2006) and the Golden Globe for The Painted Veil and Girl with a Pearl Earring, is both beautiful and haunting.In itself, Girl with a Pearl Earring is a true work of art.

809425,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0001KZNV0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","The painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) paints light on faces beautifully. Griet (Scarlett Johansson), a new maid in his household, is shy, even timid, and dares not lose her position. Her family needs the money she earns. Before long Vermeer notices her and Vermeer's wife notices him noticing her. But instead of bedding her, Vermeer, a moody sort, wants to paint her. He does, as she poses next to a window, sunlight pouring over the side of her face. But something is missing. The balance is off. So he takes a valuable pearl earring he gave to his wife and has her wear it. And that is why, 350 years later, we can see if we choose this luminous, intimate, enigmatic masterpiece.The story behind the painting is all make believe. Still, it's nice to think that Vermeer really did teach Scarlett Johansson how to mix paints and to recognize Johansson's untrained but true artistic instincts. Firth and Johansson do impressive jobs. So does Tom Wilkinson as a rich sponsor who would like very much to bed Griet. I suspect that the Dutch Republic in 1665 never looked more picturesque.Girl with a Pearl Earring is the kind of well-made movie that doesn't go anywhere.

809427,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0001KZNV0,Craig Matteson,"[3, 4]","As I watched this movie it seemed to me that the substance of the story is all about projection.  This is a completely made up story (except for the details of it is believed Vermeer actually worked), a Romance in the original sense of the word, or a ""backstory"" to use a particularly ugly term that seems to be used lately, on the famous painting by Johannes Vermeer.  It is set in Vermeer's 17th century Delft and mostly in his house.  The movie is based on a novel by Tracy Chevalier (of whom I know nothing).What do I mean by projection?  Well, it is natural that when you or I look at the painting and see this enigmatic young woman, we begin to ask ourselves questions about who she is and what she is thinking and feeling.  When we begin to answer those questions we are projecting from our inner self onto the painting things that are not there.  It says everything about us, but nothing real about the painting.  We may even love the painting for the story it represents for us, but do not mistake it for the piece Vermeer painted.The film opens with vegetables being cut, rather slowly.  Their colors are saturated and let us know what the visual effect of the film is going to be.  The movie is framed, lit, and given the color of Vermeer paintings.  There is strong light and shadow effects and at times the kind of almost washed away look that some of the paintings have today.We don't know who the girl preparing the salad is.  Even when we hear her name called, ""Griet"", we do not know if the woman commanding her is her mistress, a head servant, or her mother.  We start putting pieces together when she talks with this man who clearly has suffered a severe accident.  He is her father and the girl is being sent away to be a servant.  The father was a painter of sorts - for ceramics and gives her a memento of one of the tiles he has painted.  So, we begin our projection.  What was his accident?  What were their circumstances before and after?  What will become of them?When Griet (Scarlett Johansson) shows up at the Vermeers' it is obvious that the mistress of the house does not feel comfortable about having this pretty young girl in the household.  The other servants are wary of her, but soon take her to heart.  I won't provide any more of the plot except to note that Griet has the same effect on everyone in the film as she has on us in the painting (remember that this character is entirely made up - know one knows who the girl in the painting really was or when it was actually made, although there are good guesses).  Vermeer (Colin Firth) projects on her an understanding for his art that she likely does not posses, although the wonder of the art is powerful to her.  Van Ruijven, Vermeer's principle patron (Tom Wilkinson), projects his own appetites and lusts for the girl onto Vermeer and Griet.  The wife (Essie Davis) projects her fears about her husband onto Griet and blames her for the alienation she feels.  The only one who seems to see reality is the mother-in-law (Judy Parfitt).This is a visually beautiful movie, and we do get to see something about how Vermeer's art was made.

This movie is one of the most beautifully photographed and lit that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of movies!) In addition, the performances are subtle, nuanced and ultimately overwhelming.The movie takes place in mid-17th century Holland. Griet, a 15-year old girl from a proud but recently impoverished family, takes a job as a maid with the family of Johannes Vermeer, the painter.The family has a well-defined cast of characters: Johannes(or Jan) played by a smoldering Colin Firth, whose art takes precedence over anything in his life, including food and heat for his family; his beautiful but silly wife who lives for her jewels; his many children; and his mother-in-law/sales agent, who will do anything to keep selling his paintings. The Vermeer family depends on the good graces of their patron, played by a wicked Tom Wilkinson, who commissions and collects Jan's paintings.Griet has an artist's eye-for example, she is concerned about dusting the windows and changing the light-and slowly, very slowly, Vermeer begins to appreciate her gifts. His patron notices her beauty and commissions a painting of her (with the hope that Griet will thank him in kind). The interplay between Griet (an outstanding Scarlett Johansson) and Vermeer simmers with erotic tension. Nothing much happens-their hands briefly touch, they are beneath a blanket together-but then again a lot happens.I would recommend this movie to lovers of art and lovers of art house movies.

God knows I'm a big fan, having loved her performances in movies like 'Lost in Translation' and 'Love Song for Bobby Long' but here, in the eyes of Griet, I saw range I didn't know an actress of her age could possess.  No wonder she's been nominated FOUR times in the past THREE years at the golden globes...She's amazing.  The film centers around Griet, a poor peasent girl in 17th century Holland who must move into and work for a Catholic family since her father can no longer work.  She is a hard worker yet critisized harshly due to her masters fondness for her and the families anger towards that.  Her master, famous painter Johannes Vermeer, is obviously smitten with her innosence and beauty, but so are others, others who want her for themselves.  And then theres Vermeer's wife who is incredibly jealous of Griet as if from day one at that.  The film may move slowly but its in order to capture the way things were and the way things needed to be.  I felt it was superb, mostly due to the amazing acting on the part of Johansson.  I give it 4 1/2* mostly because after you look at Johansson's performance...no one else really stands out.  Firth is stiff as a board and boring to say the least, Murphy is decent but it was really this year that he shone as an acter and leading man...it's Davis, the jealous wife, that struck me out of the rest of the cast as noteworthy, mostly due to her outburst towards the climax of the film.

It received two Oscar nominations: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.  It explores the making of Johannes Vermeer's painting of the same name.  It shares why it was so controversial during the time and why it was so dangerous to paint.  Meanwhile, the life of the girl in the painting, Griet, becomes the biggest emotional aspect.  Though the plot moves too slow occasionally, this film is great for most audiences.  Its mixture of drama, romance, and danger keeps audiences interested.  Behind the chain of events, the characters' emotional elements of the times remain throughout the movie.  Though all actors portray their roles wonderfully, Scarlett Johannson's Golden Globe nominated role as Griet stands out.  This is one in two movies released in 2003 (also &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;) that launched her career.  She proves in this film that her best is yet to come.The physical backgrounds wonderfully blend with Vermeer's art style and Holland's 17th century style, including the setting, the costumes, and the make-up.  The research behind the era presents itself greatly.  The details also deeply explore the motives behind his art style.  Such elaborate quality offers added viewing pleasure.

It's beautifully filmed, well-crafted, evokes a nice sense of time & place, has believably restrained performances by the entire cast (though Tom Wilkinson is a bit heavy-handed), and offers a plausible (if entirely conjectural) story about Vermeer and the subject of his luminous painting. Colin Firth's Vermeer is a weak householder enraptured with the new maid, Griet (Scarlett Johannson), who is not only lovely but also shares his ability to see the beauty in things.  Their performances are competent, but neither is given much to work with in the screenplay.  The real star performance is given by Judy Parfitt, absolutely splendid as the Machiavellian mother-in-law who keeps her daughter's jealous temper in check, while manipulating artist, patron, and servant to ensure the survival of her home and family.Though Griet is not a very forthcoming character, we have no doubt about her virtues and find it easy to sympathize with her plight as a powerless young woman anxious to avoid becoming the prey of a powerful would-be protector.  The story is hardly new, but it's told fairly well in this film. Director Peter Webber is content simply to show the conditions of her life and not insult our intelligence with needless editorializing.I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible, for I liked it's craftsmanship and Parfitt's performance very much, yet the story is slight and its aims rather modest.  Still, it's significantly superior to the boring amalgamations of explosions, car chases, gunplay, irresponsible sex, sophomoric repartee, stock characters, and stale plot elements that masquerade as entertainment at most cineplexes these days.

Every scene of it is indeed a scene that Vermeer could have painted.Many details of Vermeer's life remain unknown, which gave author Tracy Chevalier a blank canvas on which to write a fictitious tale about the Dutch painter's life, and subsequently a blank canvas for director Peter Webber to recreate 17th Century Delft to perfection, from the canals in various seasons, to the blue and white of the town's famous tiles, amid a score that has been partially swiped from ""A Beautiful Mind"".The heroine of this story is a teenager named Griet--whose name, noticeably is a pet form of the name Maigriet, which means ""pearl"".Played with frequently appropriate silence by a full-lipped and perceptive looking Scarlett Johansson, whose white cap highlights the pastiness of her complexion, she is the daughter  of a disabled tile worker who must work as a maid to support her family, and in so doing, begins a road to immortality.The chief housekeeper, Tanneke (Johana Scanlan), who resembles a woman prominently featured in Vermeer's ""The Procuress"", initiates the young girl to her duties, but in an anticipatory moment, she prevents Griet from going to clean the master's studio because he is painting there, holding off unraveling the mystery about what face has been given to the Great Artist for just a little bit longer.Vermeer never painted his own portrait, except in one painting where only his back is visible, adding to his mystique. But as the actor who gives Vermeer a defineable face, Colin Firth is excellent, at turns explosive, amiable, and brooding as he helps bring out a young maid's latent talent for art appreciation, which she apparently inherited from her father.Everyone featured in the movie--from Judy Parfitt as his soberly clad mother-in-law, Essie Davis as his emotional and ever-pregnant wife, Catharina, to Griet's straw-haired, apple-cheeked butcher-boy suitor, Pieter(Cillian Murphy)-- is a character Vermeer could have painted, although with her curly red-gold hair, Alakina Mann as Vermeer's bratty daughter, Cornelia, might have captured the eye of another artist, Titian, had she lived in Italy a century earlier.We observe Griet as she goes about her daily tasks, and get a sense of her exploitable powerlessness, especially when she is confronted with the dishonorable conduct of Vermeer's patron, Van Ruijiven (Tom Wilkinson).But we see Griet's assertiveness and resolve at certain moments, as well as her discomfort in meeting certain demands her master makes of her. There is a lovely and tense moment when she removes her cap and hair the color of autumn leaves tumbles down her shoulders.After posing for Vermeer, a confused Griet rushes into a moment of passion with Pieter, perhaps to remind herself of her station and to relieve herself after having gone too far into the Great Painter's vortex.There is a final confrontation between Griet and her mistress after Catharina discovers the painting.But what a legacy! A close-up reveals the painting to have been made on wood rather than canvas. But it evokes thoughts about the mysterious girl against the black backdrop, leaving a viewer wondering about the real story behind the paintng, which  will most likely never be known.",5,The Mystery Behind the Masterpiece,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,3318,"['can', 'only', 'repeat', 'observation', 'made', 'other', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'scene', 'indeed', 'scene', 'Vermeer', 'could', 'have', 'painted.Many', 'details', 'Vermeer', 'life', 'remain', 'unknown', 'gave', 'author', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'blank', 'canvas', 'write', 'fictitious', 'tale', 'Dutch', 'painter', 'life', 'subsequently', 'blank', 'canvas', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'recreate', '17th', 'Century', 'Delft', 'perfection', 'canals', 'various', 'seasons', 'blue', 'white', 'town', 'famous', 'tiles', 'score', 'been', 'partially', 'swiped', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', '.The', 'heroine', 'story', 'teenager', 'named', 'Griet', 'name', 'noticeably', 'pet', 'form', 'name', 'Maigriet', 'pearl', '.Played', 'frequently', 'appropriate', 'silence', 'full-lipped', 'perceptive', 'looking', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'white', 'cap', 'highlights', 'pastiness', 'complexion', 'daughter', 'disabled', 'tile', 'worker', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'maid', 'support', 'family', 'so', 'doing', 'road', 'immortality.The', 'chief', 'housekeeper', 'Tanneke', 'Johana', 'Scanlan', 'who', 'woman', 'prominently', 'featured', 'Vermeer', 'Procuress', 'young', 'girl', 'duties', 'anticipatory', 'moment', 'Griet', 'going', 'clean', 'master', 'studio', 'painting', 'there', 'holding', 'off', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'what', 'face', 'been', 'given', 'Great', 'Artist', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'longer.Vermeer', 'never', 'painted', 'own', 'portrait', 'one', 'painting', 'where', 'only', 'back', 'visible', 'adding', 'mystique', 'actor', 'who', 'Vermeer', 'defineable', 'face', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'excellent', 'turns', 'explosive', 'amiable', 'brooding', 'bring', 'out', 'young', 'maid', 'latent', 'talent', 'art', 'appreciation', 'apparently', 'inherited', 'father.Everyone', 'featured', 'movie', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'soberly', 'clad', 'mother-in-law', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'emotional', 'ever-pregnant', 'wife', 'Catharina', 'Griet', 'straw-haired', 'apple-cheeked', 'butcher-boy', 'suitor', 'Pieter', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'character', 'Vermeer', 'could', 'have', 'painted', 'curly', 'red-gold', 'hair', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'Vermeer', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'Cornelia', 'might', 'have', 'captured', 'eye', 'artist', 'Titian', 'had', 'lived', 'Italy', 'century', 'earlier.We', 'observe', 'Griet', 'daily', 'tasks', 'get', 'sense', 'exploitable', 'powerlessness', 'especially', 'when', 'confronted', 'dishonorable', 'conduct', 'Vermeer', 'patron', 'Van', 'Ruijiven', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', '.But', 'see', 'Griet', 'assertiveness', 'resolve', 'certain', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'discomfort', 'meeting', 'certain', 'demands', 'master', 'lovely', 'tense', 'moment', 'when', 'cap', 'hair', 'color', 'autumn', 'down', 'shoulders.After', 'posing', 'Vermeer', 'confused', 'Griet', 'rushes', 'moment', 'passion', 'Pieter', 'perhaps', 'remind', 'herself', 'station', 'relieve', 'having', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'Great', 'Painter', 'vortex.There', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Griet', 'mistress', 'Catharina', 'painting.But', 'what', 'legacy', 'close-up', 'painting', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'wood', 'rather', 'canvas', 'thoughts', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'black', 'backdrop', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'real', 'story', 'paintng', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'known']",N/A
809438,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0001KZNV0,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 6]","One of the things that Tracy Chevalier wanted to do in the novel was to make the relationship between Griet and Johannas Vermeer nonsexual.  Olivia Hetreed's script and the direction by Peter Webber adhere to this ideal.  In her imaginings of what the girl with the pearl earring was like and what her life was like, I believe Chevalier thought it would be romantic in an artistic sense to have Vermeer's interest in her be artistic and not carnal.  It is obvious from the exquisite beauty of the painting (actual title: ""Girl in a Turban"") that he very much admired her.  It is difficult for me to believe that in that admiration he did not also feel some desire for her.Be that as it may--and I certainly respect Chevalier's interpretation and in fact think it makes for a more interesting story than if there had been some sexual involvement--Vermeer's wife, Catharina, sees in the painting beauty that she herself does not possess.  She also cannot help but wonder just what it is that her husband and the pretty young girl do during all those hours upstairs.  Yet, the emphasis is on Catharina's jealousy of Griet's beauty and not on any imagined infidelity.  I think this is consistent with Chevalier's interpretation of what the relationship between the maid and the great artist might have been.This movie surprised me in how beautiful it is and how carefully Peter Webber, whose previous credits are in television, reconstructed 17th century Delft, Holland.  If you go to the IMDb you will see that there were some goofs and anachronisms, such as a person in the background in one scene riding a bicycle.  However, the Holland of 340 years ago seemed authentic and graphically atmospheric, including all the chores Griet had to do and the errands she had to run--note her red and bruised hands.  (They used lye in soap in those days.)Still the open air market could have used a few more flies (ha!) and the butcher boy (Cillian Murphy) was entirely too pretty (ha!), but Vermeer's studio seemed magical and I love the mixing of the colors and the way the light came through the windows.  There are at least three Vermeer paintings in which we see the same light from the same window: the title painting; the painting he was working on without the chair in the foreground that Griet removed called, ""Young Woman with a Water Jug""; and ""The Painter's Studio.""  If I made a list of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, Girl with a Pearl Earring would make the list, along with, e.g., Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) and maybe a dozen more.As for Scarlett Johansson who had the title role I must say she won me over.  At first I thought she was a bit too voluptuous for the part.  (It is interesting to compare the reconstruction of the painting with Johansson with the original shown at the end of the movie.  The real girl was a bit more delicate and of course not as sensual as Johansson.)  Johansson won me over because of the subtly of her interpretation and because of the hard work she obviously put into the part.  She is an actress we will see a lot of in the future.  If you want to see her in less severe garb, catch her in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) where her sensual beauty is more fully presented.Colin Firth very much caught the intensity of the artist and seemed to do so almost without effort.  His eyes beheld Griet and indeed all the world not in a carnal way, but in the penetrating way of the artist who wants to see the world as it really is, not as our needs demand.  We see this in the scene in which he insists that Griet see the real colors in the clouds, not just the white that we think we see.  Note too (continuing Chevalier's theme) that it would be inopportune, careless and threatening to his artistic career for Vermeer to have an affair with the maid since with his mother-in-law in the house (her house, her money), and his wife and some nosy, tattling children, he would have been caught.  Vermeer only completed about 40 paintings in his lifetime.  His wife (or most especially his mother-in-law) was indeed his most important ""patron.""  An artist without a patron sleeps in the streets, especially in such a mercantile world as a small town in 17th century Holland.Catharina Vermeer (Essie Davis in an underappreciated role) provided exactly the right counterpoint with her vile, snake-in-the-garden-of-artistic-eden presence and her purely burgher mentality and her oppressive jealousy and her high-handed treatment of her servants.  Without Davis's excruciatingly vivid performance this movie would have been flat and lacking in tension.As for the ending and for the inevitable comparison with the novel, let's say the ending here (and the question of Griet's future life with the ""butcher boy"") is more open to interpretation than in the book where more is explained.  (See my review, or better yet read the novel.)  The strength of the book is in how deeply we can go into the mind of Griet and into the artistic intimacy of her relationship with Vermeer, whereas in the movie we can more fully appreciate the atmosphere and the beauty of the artist's vision.By the way, in the novel it is clear that Griet does indeed desire Vermeer but realizes that his station is too much above hers, and his circumstances with five children and a sixth on the way leave no room for her.  Also clear in both mediums is the fact that Vermeer's exquisite portrait is, in effect, his way of making love to her.",5,Exquisitely beautiful adaptation of the novel,1138060800,"01 24,

After seeing her in Ghost World and then years later in Lost in Translation, I have fallen in love with her classic beauty and superb acting. So let me put it out there - I saw this movie to see Scarlett.As an artist, I found the film to be intriguing. Almost every scene, like a Vermeer, had perfect light, wonderful color, and fantastic composition. The cinematography is breathtaking. But also, as the characters prance around in an utterly perfect atmosphere, it is hard to miss the superb acting of the cast as a whole, especially by the females. Griet (Johannson), her mistress, and her misstress' mother are all played with quiet conviction and simulatenous compassion. While each character holds in place, none, even the young daughter, is without multiple dimensions and vast emotion.That said, the film had a feel for a made-for-TV movie. The plot was subtle yes. But much happened - maybe too much.  Meanwhile, there were parts of the film that drove me insane (why was the sky high noon blue when the light in the room was that of early evening?), but it did manage to keep me calmly entertained. The ending lacked strength, but when Scarlett puts on the cloth, the earring, and turns her head behind her shoulder to reveal the ""perfect"" pose, chills ran down my spine for 5 minutes straight.

Hartley,"[0, 0]","A lushly filmed, atmospherically detailed historical drama in the &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; tradition that will captivate art lovers, or anyone who has a fascination for the mysteries of the creative process. Costume drama favorite Colin Firth puts another plumed feather in his cap as the Dutch master Vermeer. Refreshingly, there is only a minimum of the usual &quot;tortured artist&quot; angst brushed on here (a la &quot;Lust For Life&quot; or &quot;Pollock&quot;)- in fact, Firth's Vermeer is closer to a modern-day yuppie, scrambling to support his children, pay for the servants and keep his vain, neurotic wife happily bejewelled. The bulk of Vermeer's income is derived from commissioned paintings, and it is the speculative story behind one of these &quot;jobs&quot; that forms the basis of the film. Scarlett Johansson is perfectly cast as Vermeer's maid, who is destined to become the model for his iconic 'girl with a pearl earring' portrait. The film is deliberately paced, but quite compelling as it teasingly peels away the layers of the creative process. The growing, unspoken attraction between Vermeer and his maid is never physically acted on, but expressed in the little details; a scene where Firth teaches Johansson how to mix oils and create primary colors is fraught with subtle sensuality. The most striking (and inevitable) moment in the film occurs when Johansson's onscreen image, through lighting, pose, costume (and not to mention an uncanny physical likeness) becomes an exact mirror replica of the original painting. It is a truly sublime moment, and a credit to the filmaker's craft.

809441,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0001KZNV0,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","Definitely a mood piece, this lemon-tinted celluloid confection relating to the genesis of Vermeer's masterpiece, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot;, provides mere mortals not only a glimpse into 17th century Flemish life, where the formula creating great art relies on the not-so-constant variables of fickle patron, tight-fisted mother-in-law, and an insecure ever-pregnant wife, but a  silent communication between a visionary and his inspiration.For dialogue plays second-fiddle to lusciously crafted cinematic moments infused with expertly-rendered replications of Vermeer's famous settings -- we watch Griet, the newly hired maid, reach to wash the studio windows and &quot;Woman with A Water Jug&quot; materializes from concept to canvas.  Conversation between the players merely enhances an already ionically charged scene, explaining the pressures--pressures that transcend period and are equally threatening in the 21st century--- of Vermeer's overextended household where secondary character moter-in-law Maria Thins, finds herself in the omnipotent managerial position og balancing her budget, salving her daughter's self-persecuting vulnerability, securing further commissions, turning a blind eye to patron Van Ruijven's lascivious appetites and understanding Vermeer's need for a form of intimacy with his muse in order to produce his great art.Colin Firth, ever smouldering, plays Vermeer with a quiet acceptance of his circumstances; his impatience to create supercedes his desire for making the explanations pleaded for by his wife.  But Scarlett Johansson as the teenaged Griet and lead, provides the ethereal quality so necessary to the success of this film. Her upturned face shines with her character's pride---cold and translucent with the perfect symmetry of the full moon, yet imploring and nascent in her innocence.

809442,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B0001KZNV0,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[1, 4]","I read the book, I saw the film and I love Vermeer, but I  have my own ideas about this mysterious painter, and some how I have never pictured him as looking like Colin Firth, whom I like very much but not in this role. I would have cast an unknown actor and a Dutch one at that given there is so little dialogue in this film.  Scarlett Johannson is certainly a fine actress, and probably a good choice for her role (as are Judy Parfitt and Tom Wilkenson for their roles) but if Ms Johannson's lips get any bigger they will burst.  She is an excellent example of a beautiful young woman on the verge of being ruined by plastic surgery.  Why do women think making their lips look like labia makes them more attractive?Thanks to the historian Simon Schama, whom Vreeland praises in her book, we have a good idea of the ""look"" of the 16th Century Netherlands. Few historical genre films are made about small places like the Netherlands, from whence emigrated my own ancestors, so I found this film a special treat. One of my own 7xgreat grandmothers was a washer-woman in Groeningen during this period, and I know her life was hard. I thought of her as I watched Griet wash clothes and hang them out to dry. And, it wasn't that long ago when I myself took frozen wash off the clothes line, so I know how things were dried before dryers.Anyone familiar with Vermeer's work will recognize the ""bringing to life"" of several of his interior paintings, including of course, ""The Girl..""  We know little about the man, but something about the world around him which he painted.  Vermeer and other Dutch painters of his era, are distinguished because they captured common"" men, women, and children engaged in everyday activities that most of us recognize, and not the war moments and other' heroic' themes loved by the aristocracy. That Vermeer's life and times have been partially committed to film is no small thing.

809445,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B0001KZNV0,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is a relatively uneventful historical drama about Griet, the 17-year-old maid, nicely played by Scarlett Johansson, for painter Johannes Vermeer and his family. At the prodding of Van Ruijven, Vermeer's wealthy, imperious, dirty old man patron, she winds up becoming the model for the famous painting in the title of this film; however, it's supposed to be kept a secret from Vermeer's equally imperious wife. . .Meanwhile, Griet is being courted by Pieter the butcher's apprentice, a strong and likeable character who, although the accent sounds more British than Dutch, is memorably played by Cillian Murphy.GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING reveals the personal politics and entanglements between its characters very, very well. The situations shown here are the sort that people of all ages and eras go through all the time. It may be too slow-moving for those who want action, dramatic twists, etc, and I would have liked a little more punch somewhere. Still, it has a quiet, subtle tension that's just all its own, and I had no trouble staying with it. By necessity, the scenery is confined almost entirely to the Vermeer household, with some street scenes of Delft, Holland, 1665, and it captures these settings pretty admirably. From what I understand, no one is certain of who the model was for this painting, but most experts think it probably was a servant girl such as Griet. This film is certainly worth seeing for anyone with a basic interest in the history behind the story, and there is also a lot of interesting stuff about the artistic processes of the Old Dutch Masters.GPE is a realistic but clean film: No nasty stuff besides a quickly aborted, half-hearted rape attempt; also, with some prodding by Vermeer, Griet goes so far as to (gulp!) briefly remove her bonnet for him. No seriously disturbing gore or violence. Still, most younger audiences would probably be quite bored by this film.GPE is based on a 1999 novel by Tracy Chevalier, which I am now eager to read. While I have no regrets about investing 100 minutes watching it, it seems like the sort of story that can only be done justice when it's read.",4,"""You looked inside me!""",1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2151,"['GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'relatively', 'uneventful', 'historical', 'drama', 'Griet', '17-year-old', 'maid', 'nicely', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'painter', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'prodding', 'Van', 'Ruijven', 'Vermeer', 'wealthy', 'imperious', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'patron', 'up', 'becoming', 'model', 'famous', 'painting', 'title', 'film', 'however', 'supposed', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'Vermeer', 'equally', 'imperious', 'wife', '.Meanwhile', 'Griet', 'being', 'courted', 'Pieter', 'butcher', 'apprentice', 'strong', 'likeable', 'character', 'who', 'accent', 'more', 'British', 'Dutch', 'memorably', 'played', 'Cillian', 'Murphy.GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'personal', 'politics', 'entanglements', 'characters', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'situations', 'shown', 'here', 'are', 'sort', 'people', 'ages', 'eras', 'go', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow-moving', 'who', 'want', 'action', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'punch', 'somewhere', 'Still', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'tension', 'just', 'own', 'had', 'trouble', 'staying', 'necessity', 'scenery', 'confined', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'street', 'scenes', 'Delft', 'Holland', '1665', 'settings', 'pretty', 'admirably', 'what', 'understand', 'one', 'certain', 'who', 'model', 'was', 'painting', 'most', 'experts', 'think', 'probably', 'was', 'servant', 'girl', 'such', 'Griet', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'basic', 'interest', 'history', 'story', 'also', 'lot', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'artistic', 'processes', 'Old', 'Dutch', 'Masters.GPE', 'realistic', 'clean', 'film', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'quickly', 'aborted', 'half-hearted', 'rape', 'attempt', 'also', 'prodding', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'so', 'far', 'gulp', 'briefly', 'remove', 'bonnet', 'seriously', 'disturbing', 'gore', 'violence', 'Still', 'most', 'younger', 'audiences', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'quite', 'bored', 'film.GPE', 'based', '1999', 'novel', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'am', 'now', 'eager', 'read', 'have', 'regrets', 'investing', '100', 'minutes', 'watching', 'sort', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'done', 'justice', 'when', 'read']",N/A

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","2003's ""Girl with a Pearl Earing"" offers a detailed recreation of the Delft, Holland of 1665, and specifically, of the house of gifted painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth).  The house is run by Vermeer's mother-in-law (Judy Parfit), who understands its survival depends on earning commissions from weathly art patrons, including the manipulative Master van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson).  Vermeer has just finished a painting, and is in need of inspiration.Into the house comes a new young maid, Griet (Scarlett Johansson).  Griet is poor, shy, and illiterate.  She is also hardworking, curious, and, to the surprise of Vermeer, has an instinctive grasp of the essentials of color, light, and composition in painting.  Her assistance to his work draws the jealousy of Vermeer's bitter wife Katrina (Essie Davis), the hatred of one of the children, and the mischief-making of Master van Ruijven, who demands she be the subject of Vermeer's next painting.Griet's life becomes complicated.  She is an object of courtship for the handsome butcher's boy Pieter (Cillian Murphy), of sensuous inspiration for Vermeer, and of a crude rape attempt by van Ruijven.  A quiet conspiracy to complete the painting without Katrina's knowledge is betrayed, leading to a fateful confrontation over Griet's status in the house.""Girl with a Pearl Earing"" has a solid cast, outstanding production values, and a subtle but intense plot centering on the young Griet.  As a servant forbidden to speak unless spoken to, Scarlett Johansson's Griet compellingly portrays her moods and emotions through gesture and expression.  Unglamorous in servant's clothing, scrubbed white skin, and work-roughened hands, the innocent act of removing her cap and letting down her long red hair in the presence of Vermeer becomes an unconscious intimacy.

809447,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B0001KZNV0,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[6, 8]","The novel, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&quot; by Tracy Chevalier, was deservedly acclaimed by the literary world.  Chevalier captured the atmosphere of 17th Century Holland perfectly, and she brought the characters of Johannes Vermeer and Griet, the maid who loves art, to vibrant life. The book inspired discussion groups, a gorgeous exhibit in the Met, and many newspaper and magazine spreads.  It was a cultural phenomenon.The film, alas, although beautiful to behold, is slow-moving and too shallow to do justice to the book.  The director, Peter Webber, evokes little emotional resonance from his actors.  Griet is supposed to be a very intelligent and intuitive young woman with strong artistic leanings. A restrained Scarlett Johansson plays Griet as a timid and bewildered maiden.  Colin Firth is a disheveled and distracted Vermeer, who fails to impart the genius behind the man.The story takes place mostly in the house of the great Dutch painter.  Vermeer is surrounded by a passel of women, including his sharp-tongued mother-in-law, Maria Thins, his fertile wife, Catharina, his resentful daughter, Cornelia, and numerous other children and servants.  Thins is constantly pressuring her son-in-law to paint faster, since the family needs money to maintain their costly lifestyle.  Vermeer, however, is a perfectionist who works slowly and deliberately.  He refuses to churn out assembly-line paintings. Although the playful butcher's son, Pieter, is courting Griet, her heart belongs to Vermeer and his art.Griet is fascinated by the complexities of painting.  How are beautiful colors mixed, and how does an artist decide to place his subject in a particular position or in a certain light?  Vermeer finds Griet to be an apt and eager pupil and she secretly becomes his assistant.  She also becomes his model when the lecherous Van Ruijven, played with relish by Tom Wilkinson, commissions Vermeer to paint her.  The result is the timeless work of art that has captured the imagination of the world.The lighting, cinematography, and costume design in &quot;Pearl Earring&quot; are all breathtaking.  However, it takes more than surface beauty to make a memorable motion picture.  If the director and the actors had dug deeper into the book's themes to better explore the tempestuous emotions that lay beneath the surface, they might have imbued the film with a bit more animation and depth.",3,Static movie fails to come alive.,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,2408,"['novel', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'quot', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'was', 'deservedly', 'acclaimed', 'literary', 'world', 'Chevalier', 'captured', 'atmosphere', '17th', 'Century', 'Holland', 'perfectly', 'brought', 'characters', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'maid', 'who', 'art', 'vibrant', 'life', 'book', 'inspired', 'discussion', 'groups', 'gorgeous', 'exhibit', 'Met', 'many', 'newspaper', 'magazine', 'spreads', 'was', 'cultural', 'phenomenon.The', 'film', 'alas', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'slow-moving', 'too', 'shallow', 'do', 'justice', 'book', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'little', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'actors', 'Griet', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'intelligent', 'intuitive', 'young', 'woman', 'strong', 'artistic', 'leanings', 'restrained', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Griet', 'timid', 'bewildered', 'maiden', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'disheveled', 'distracted', 'Vermeer', 'who', 'impart', 'genius', 'man.The', 'story', 'place', 'mostly', 'house', 'great', 'Dutch', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'surrounded', 'passel', 'women', 'including', 'sharp-tongued', 'mother-in-law', 'Maria', 'Thins', 'fertile', 'wife', 'Catharina', 'resentful', 'daughter', 'Cornelia', 'numerous', 'other', 'children', 'servants', 'Thins', 'constantly', 'pressuring', 'son-in-law', 'paint', 'faster', 'family', 'money', 'maintain', 'costly', 'lifestyle', 'Vermeer', 'however', 'perfectionist', 'who', 'slowly', 'deliberately', 'churn', 'out', 'assembly-line', 'paintings', 'playful', 'butcher', 'son', 'Pieter', 'courting', 'Griet', 'heart', 'Vermeer', 'art.Griet', 'fascinated', 'complexities', 'painting', 'How', 'are', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'mixed', 'how', 'artist', 'decide', 'place', 'subject', 'particular', 'position', 'certain', 'light', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'be', 'apt', 'eager', 'pupil', 'secretly', 'assistant', 'also', 'model', 'when', 'lecherous', 'Van', 'Ruijven', 'played', 'relish', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'commissions', 'Vermeer', 'paint', 'result', 'timeless', 'work', 'art', 'captured', 'imagination', 'world.The', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'design', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'quot', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'However', 'more', 'surface', 'beauty', 'make', 'memorable', 'motion', 'picture', 'director', 'actors', 'had', 'dug', 'deeper', 'book', 'themes', 'better', 'explore', 'tempestuous', 'emotions', 'lay', 'surface', 'might', 'have', 'imbued', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'animation', 'depth']",N/A

Featuring an inspired cast of Scarlet Johansson, who plays Griet, the servant girl whom inspires Vermeer to paint his masterpiece, Colin Firth as Vermeer, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy and showcasing some of the most astounding cinematography and art direction I've ever scene on screen, this is truly a film to behold.  It is visually stunning, virtually a painting in movement and is simply breathtaking to behold.  The atmosphere is so perfectly created by the lavish sets, intricate costumes, enchanting lighting, striking cinematography, and beautiful music that one cannot help but be impressed by the amount of effort that went into creating this piece of art.Unfortunately, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" suffers from a severe case of ""high on style, low on substance syndrome"".  All in all, not much happens in this film and along with the sparse dialogue, it soon becomes difficult for audiences to stay interested; despite the abundant visual radiance of the film.

809452,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0001KZNV0,Erica Anderson,"[11, 13]","I just saw ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" this afternoon. I was thoroughly entertained with the fictional story of behind Vermeer's painting of a young girl with a pear earring. Normally I am not really big on period pieces but I was completely engrossed through out the film. It makes up for the shoddy film ""Carnage"" I saw last weekend. ""Girl With Pearl Earring"" stars Scarlett Johansson (my favorite actress at the moment) as Griet, the object of Johanne Vermeer's (Colin Firth) painting. I haven't read the novel written by Tracy Chevalier but now that I have seen the film, I have this compelling urge to read the book now. Anyways, Griet is a young peasant girl who is forced to make a living for her family because her father was maimed in a serious accident as a tile maker. She is sent to work as a maid for the Vermeer household. Colin Firth looked absolutely gorgeous as Johanne Vermeer despite the grungey look he had going in the movie. Like Johansson, Firth put in a stellar performance as Vermeer. The supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson as master patron Van Ruijven, Judy Parfitt as Maria Thins, Jo Scanlan as Tanneke (the other maid), Cillian Murphy (Griet's boyfriend), and Essie Davis as the insecure and control freak wife Catherina were equally compelling to say the very least. I loved the sinister daughter Cornelia (played by Alakina Mann). Although she didn't say much in the movie, her actions spoke louder than words. One couldn't help but feel pity for Vermeer who appeared to be emotionally beaten down by his insecure wife Catherina. Perhaps that is how Peter Webb intended for Vermeer. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra was excellent. The dark, moody cinematography fit the mood of the film. The costumes and the entire set of the film was equally wonderful. I guess if there was a flaw with the film is the minimal dialogue but I wasn't really bothered by that. It enhanced the mood of the film in my opinion. I loved ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"".

809454,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0001KZNV0,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 3]","This film captures social, cultural and everyday life in 17th Century Holland beautifully and artistically through the eyes of Griet, a young hired servant who works in the household of a famous Dutch artist. Her emotions are captured superbly by the camera through long and short shots of her facial features. Griet is perfectly portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen. Essentially, the film is about the relationship that develops very gradually and subtley between the artist Johannes Vermeer and Griet as she learns about creating art. She is sent by her family to work in their house because her father is ill and the family needs the money. Griet learns a lot about different lifestyles and class differences by living with this family. She sees how the artist and his family totally depend on the patron for their living. They plan a grand dinner for the patron, Van Ruijven and his family to unveil the completion of a portrait of his wife and also to celebrate the birth of a baby into the Vermeer household. The dependency of the artist and his family on the patron, the absolute need to accomodate to his personal tastes and wishes, no matter what his character and behavior ... even to the point of compromise and deception within the Vermeer family is very well shown. Griet's own limited choices in life, her budding friendship with the butcher's son, the possibility for romance and a future together is nicely presented.The flow of life within the Vermeer household is artistically filmed using different color schemes and shadings of light ... portrayng the life of the servants contrasted with the life of the family. Colin Firth plays Vermeer, the quiet, handsome, brooding and thoughtful artist ... He shuts himself off in his studio to paint, to create artistic pieces using elegant color and light, capturing distinct moods and feelings. His wife Catherine is less artistic and more shallow. She is viewed as the dependent, spoiled wife of the artist, whose wit and charm can have a razor sharp edge when they are crossed. Her instincts register a threat after Griet's sleeping quarters are moved to the artists studio although the move is done to provide privacy for another servant. When Catherine again becomes pregnant ...  Catherine's mother makes clear that everyone depends on Vermeer for their livlihoods - she is not averse to deceiving her own daughter by letting Johannes paint Griet in order to continue their lifestyle. Griet is warned by Pietr, the butcher's son, ""you are a fly in his web"". The character of Van Ruijven is very well explored ... catering to his whims and procliviites.  There are several episodes within the film where Catherine's shrewish jealous fits are sure signs that Griet's future is not assured within this family structure. Rumors surface at the marketplace about Griet and the artist. Amazingly, there is a magnificent conclusion to the events of Griet's relationship with Johannes Vermeer. The ending is quite touching and sensitively filmed. For this viewer, it was a total surprise.Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",5,A Portrait Comes to Life  and Captures the Viewer's Heart,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,3069,"['film', 'social', 'cultural', 'everyday', 'life', '17th', 'Century', 'Holland', 'beautifully', 'artistically', 'eyes', 'Griet', 'young', 'hired', 'servant', 'who', 'household', 'famous', 'Dutch', 'artist', 'emotions', 'are', 'captured', 'superbly', 'camera', 'long', 'short', 'shots', 'facial', 'features', 'Griet', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'Essentially', 'film', 'relationship', 'very', 'gradually', 'subtley', 'artist', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'creating', 'art', 'sent', 'family', 'work', 'house', 'father', 'ill', 'family', 'money', 'Griet', 'lot', 'different', 'lifestyles', 'class', 'differences', 'living', 'family', 'how', 'artist', 'family', 'totally', 'depend', 'patron', 'living', 'plan', 'grand', 'dinner', 'patron', 'Van', 'Ruijven', 'family', 'unveil', 'completion', 'portrait', 'wife', 'also', 'celebrate', 'birth', 'baby', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'dependency', 'artist', 'family', 'patron', 'absolute', 'need', 'accomodate', 'personal', 'tastes', 'wishes', 'matter', 'what', 'character', 'behavior', 'even', 'point', 'compromise', 'deception', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'very', 'well', 'shown', 'Griet', 'own', 'limited', 'choices', 'life', 'budding', 'friendship', 'butcher', 'son', 'possibility', 'romance', 'future', 'together', 'nicely', 'presented.The', 'flow', 'life', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'artistically', 'filmed', 'using', 'different', 'color', 'schemes', 'shadings', 'light', 'life', 'servants', 'contrasted', 'life', 'family', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Vermeer', 'quiet', 'handsome', 'brooding', 'thoughtful', 'artist', 'off', 'studio', 'paint', 'create', 'artistic', 'pieces', 'using', 'elegant', 'color', 'light', 'capturing', 'distinct', 'moods', 'feelings', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'less', 'artistic', 'more', 'shallow', 'viewed', 'dependent', 'spoiled', 'wife', 'artist', 'wit', 'charm', 'can', 'have', 'razor', 'sharp', 'edge', 'when', 'are', 'crossed', 'instincts', 'register', 'threat', 'Griet', 'sleeping', 'quarters', 'are', 'moved', 'artists', 'studio', 'move', 'done', 'provide', 'privacy', 'servant', 'When', 'Catherine', 'again', 'pregnant', 'Catherine', 'mother', 'clear', 'everyone', 'Vermeer', 'livlihoods', 'not', 'averse', 'deceiving', 'own', 'daughter', 'letting', 'Johannes', 'paint', 'Griet', 'order', 'continue', 'lifestyle', 'Griet', 'warned', 'Pietr', 'butcher', 'son', 'are', 'fly', 'web', 'character', 'Van', 'Ruijven', 'very', 'well', 'explored', 'catering', 'whims', 'procliviites', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'film', 'where', 'Catherine', 'shrewish', 'jealous', 'fits', 'are', 'sure', 'signs', 'Griet', 'future', 'not', 'assured', 'family', 'structure', 'Rumors', 'surface', 'marketplace', 'Griet', 'artist', 'Amazingly', 'magnificent', 'conclusion', 'events', 'Griet', 'relationship', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'ending', 'quite', 'touching', 'sensitively', 'filmed', 'viewer', 'was', 'total', 'surprise.Erika', 'Borsos', 'flower']",N/A
809455,A1FX80GAU3K2D5,B0001KZNV0,Franz N. I.,"[10, 10]","It is a joy to watch this definitive art movie, helped with one of the most exceptional cinemaphotagraphy ever made. The entire film was like stepping into a painting and each scene is like a painting in itself. It always amazes me how good a movie can be with so little dialogue spoken. A good actor can speak volumes with just a glance. A stolen glance, or a seemingly accidental touch between the two central characters---the artist Johannes Vermeer and his iridescent house maid Griet, communicated more subtly than any words could ever. I have always loved Flemish paintings for their simplicity and the use of light. And this is story telling at its best, a movie with heart and soul...about a painting many art critics call  ""The Mona Lisa of the North.""This is not a fast paced movie. Vermeer's paintings are incredibly hypnotic, drawing us into a time and place that no longer exists.  The elementally envigorating music mixes well with the time and place. It's good to be transported several centuries back to live for a moment through the eyes of Griet (Johanson) and Vermeer (Firth). They played well the repressed passion between the two that was so thrilling where the film stayed so close to the plot of the book.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has an eye for beauty or films that involve thought and emotion rather than just gratuitous explosions of violence and random sex...despite some flawed pieces in the story line: In the  film, as in the book,  the painting is commissioned by the patron Van Ruiven specifically because he is in lust with Griet, and Van Ruiven carefully specified who he wanted to be in it (Griet). Katarina's (Vermeer's wife) fury towards the end of the film therefore doesn't make sense at all.Also Vermeer's gift to Griet of the pearl earrings  is not believable. At the end of the film (and story),  Vermeer would have known that after several years,  Griet was married and living comfortably, while his eleven children were going to be destitute when he is gone. It is hard to believe that he would have given away valuable pearls to a former maid, even under the strength of his feelings for her, when the earrings weren't even his to give; they belonged to his wife.Still the movie is  a stunning visual experience.  GWAPE is a Vermeer painting come to life. The cinematography was marvelous, but the editing and direction didn't live up to what could have been a more magical film about obsession, love,  beauty and art. Not that the film doesn't work, because it does...it just feels incomplete as a whole.  I ended watching the movie  wanting more out of the experience. All of this said, it  is still a gorgeous, worthwhile film... just one that isn't as great in the end as it should have been.  It won't go down as a great film, but there is a great film lurking somewhere inside it.Colin Firth brings his considerable repertoire of talents as the enigmatic Johannes Vermeer and makes him a formidable figure with sparse dialogue. Scarlet is the perfect Greit.  Perhaps it is Scarlet Johanson's movie, and it may very well be.  But  Firth has the film in his own quiet and strong competent grasp. All the actors are outstanding...and this memorable movie is worthy to be seen again and again.5 out of 5",5,GWAPE is a Vermeer painting come to life.,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,3268,"['joy', 'watch', 'definitive', 'art', 'movie', 'helped', 'one', 'most', 'exceptional', 'cinemaphotagraphy', 'ever', 'made', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'stepping', 'painting', 'scene', 'painting', 'always', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'little', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'speak', 'volumes', 'just', 'glance', 'stolen', 'glance', 'seemingly', 'accidental', 'touch', 'two', 'central', 'characters', '-the', 'artist', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'iridescent', 'house', 'maid', 'Griet', 'communicated', 'more', 'subtly', 'words', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Flemish', 'paintings', 'simplicity', 'use', 'light', 'story', 'telling', 'best', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul', 'painting', 'many', 'art', 'critics', 'call', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'North', 'not', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'are', 'incredibly', 'hypnotic', 'drawing', 'time', 'place', 'longer', 'elementally', 'envigorating', 'music', 'mixes', 'well', 'time', 'place', 'good', 'be', 'transported', 'several', 'centuries', 'back', 'live', 'moment', 'eyes', 'Griet', 'Johanson', 'Vermeer', 'Firth', 'played', 'well', 'repressed', 'passion', 'two', 'was', 'so', 'thrilling', 'where', 'film', 'stayed', 'so', 'close', 'plot', 'book', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'eye', 'beauty', 'films', 'involve', 'thought', 'emotion', 'rather', 'just', 'gratuitous', 'explosions', 'violence', 'random', 'sex', 'flawed', 'pieces', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'book', 'painting', 'commissioned', 'patron', 'Van', 'Ruiven', 'specifically', 'lust', 'Griet', 'Van', 'Ruiven', 'carefully', 'specified', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'Griet', 'Katarina', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'fury', 'end', 'film', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'all.Also', 'Vermeer', 'gift', 'Griet', 'pearl', 'earrings', 'not', 'believable', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'Vermeer', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'several', 'years', 'Griet', 'was', 'married', 'living', 'comfortably', 'eleven', 'children', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'destitute', 'when', 'gone', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'away', 'valuable', 'pearls', 'former', 'maid', 'even', 'strength', 'feelings', 'when', 'earrings', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'belonged', 'wife.Still', 'movie', 'stunning', 'visual', 'experience', 'GWAPE', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'come', 'life', 'cinematography', 'was', 'marvelous', 'editing', 'direction', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'magical', 'film', 'obsession', 'love', 'beauty', 'art', 'Not', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'just', 'incomplete', 'whole', 'ended', 'watching', 'movie', 'wanting', 'more', 'experience', 'said', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'just', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'end', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'lurking', 'somewhere', 'inside', 'it.Colin', 'Firth', 'considerable', 'repertoire', 'talents', 'enigmatic', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'formidable', 'figure', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'Scarlet', 'perfect', 'Greit', 'Perhaps', 'Scarlet', 'Johanson', 'movie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Firth', 'film', 'own', 'quiet', 'strong', 'competent', 'grasp', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'memorable', 'movie', 'worthy', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'again.5', '5']",N/A

L'hoir,"[2, 2]","Long ago, I lived in Amsterdam, and one of the things I recall so vividly--besides the icy October wind--was the cool intensity of the light that shimmered from the reflections of the canals, and it is the play of light and shadow that Johannes Vermeer captured in his paintings in the Netherlands' city of Delft.Although ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" based on a novel that imagines the artist's inspiration for his eponymous masterpiece, is minimalist in its approach to narrative, its cinematography, which cannot be faulted, puts the viewer in the centre of a Vermeer painting. It is certainly worth viewing for anyone who is interested in art history, or life in seventeenth-century Netherlands, as viewed in one of Vermeer's paintings. The contrast between the cool blue tinges of the servants' quarters and the warm shades of the household, with its Turkish carpeted table coverings, wood-panelled and whitewashed walls, is startling.Some of the most interesting scenes show the artist cutting and mixing his pigments; they also demonstrate (but do not explain) his reliance on the camera obscura--the box with a lens that reflected the images that he painted and which is said to have emphasised contrast between light and shadow.The acting is underplayed (Colin Firth at his broodiest; and Scarlett Johansson as the mute victim of class and society) to such an extent that some viewers might find it on the soporific side, especially given the lack of attention to plot or development of character, but the magnificence of the visual details more than compensates.Just sit back and enjoy this visual feast.",4,A Play of Light and Shadow,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1617,"['Long', 'ago', 'lived', 'Amsterdam', 'one', 'things', 'recall', 'so', 'vividly', 'icy', 'October', 'wind', 'was', 'cool', 'intensity', 'light', 'shimmered', 'reflections', 'canals', 'play', 'light', 'shadow', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'captured', 'paintings', 'Netherlands', 'city', 'Delft.Although', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'based', 'novel', 'artist', 'inspiration', 'eponymous', 'masterpiece', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'narrative', 'cinematography', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'viewer', 'centre', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'art', 'history', 'life', 'seventeenth-century', 'Netherlands', 'viewed', 'one', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'contrast', 'cool', 'blue', 'tinges', 'servants', 'quarters', 'warm', 'shades', 'household', 'Turkish', 'carpeted', 'table', 'coverings', 'wood-panelled', 'whitewashed', 'walls', 'startling.Some', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'show', 'artist', 'cutting', 'mixing', 'pigments', 'also', 'demonstrate', 'do', 'not', 'explain', 'reliance', 'camera', 'obscura', 'box', 'lens', 'reflected', 'images', 'painted', 'said', 'have', 'emphasised', 'contrast', 'light', 'shadow.The', 'acting', 'underplayed', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'broodiest', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'mute', 'victim', 'class', 'society', 'extent', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'soporific', 'side', 'especially', 'given', 'lack', 'attention', 'plot', 'development', 'character', 'magnificence', 'visual', 'details', 'more', 'compensates.Just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'visual', 'feast']",N/A
809457,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001KZNV0,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING was a dazzling novel by Tracy Chevalier, an achievement so stunning that artists, art historians, art lovers and readers all willingly sacrificed historic accuracy for the illuminating insight on how a painting comes into being. Now Peter Webber with the help of his screenwriters has enhanced the novel and made visual all the magic the book contained and more. The story is so well known by now that rehashing the plot seems pointless. This is simply a take on how Vermeer created a mysteriously beautiful portrait of a young girl in his studio, a painting that though small, holds all of the magic of light source, absorption, and reflection that became the hallmark of the great Dutch master painter. Though the story is minimal it is the cinematography/picture composition that is the main feature here. Care is given to the exteriors of Delft (as staged in Luxembourg) to be cold and misty, making the interior shots all the more claustrophobic and intimate and lighted only by candle or by the limited light from leaded glass windows. This is a movie that would be thoroughly understood even if the soundtrack were lost. But that is not giving importance to the actors who people this painting come to life. Colin Firth as Vermeer says little with his lips but says vistas with his eyes: this is a sensitive understated performance. The wearer of the earring is Scarlett Johansson as Griet and she brings to her role a physical beauty of face and presence that make this version of how Vermeer created his 28 masterpieces believable. As a maid in Vermeer's house she is under the scrutiny of Vermeer's ever-pregnant wife (an excellent Essie Davis) and even more controlled by the presence of Vermeer's mother-in-law - the wondrous Judy Parfitt who is so elegant in her Elizabethan type white collar over her black gowns that she begs to be a painting Vermeer never did! Tom Wilkinson adds credence to Vermeer's patron and Cillian Murphy receives all the benefits of Griet's coming into the knowledge of ecstasy as her butcher boyfriend, a lad with penetrating blue eyes and brusque charm. The musical score is most fitting (Alexandre Desplat). This is a treat of the eyes and the mind and sure to become a staple in the libraries of all who love art.

Especially a novel with the nuances and complexities of this one. I should also note that, unlike the book, this film tells the story in the 3rd person.  Even so, director Peter Webber does a terrific job of capturing the tension of attraction between master painter Vermeer and the title character, a house maid whom he discovers shares his understanding of and love for the color, light, composition, and even materials of painting.  I give him a lot of credit for this because a lesser filmmaker would have made the cheap, easy change to a sexual affair, which would have sold more tickets, but undercut Vermeer's passion for art, ignored the book's core plot, and been much more ""expected.""In addition, the acting is very good across the board.  Johansson is terrific throughout, and fulfills the very specific visual demands of the lead role perfectly, as well.  Colin Firth hits the nuances that would make or break his role just right.  Tom Wilkinson is that mix of handsome sophisticate and creepy slimeball which so many of his roles have called for.  And Essie Davis portrays Vermeer's wife so wanly that you won't know whether you want to hug her or slap her.Of course, the book has more opportunity to develop scenes, story, and the main character's thinking in detail, but the excellent art direction and photography of the film almost make up for what's lost in the conversion.  It's not just that the filming is consistently lush and rich, but that it accurately reflects the way the master painters of Holland painted at the time, right down to the darkness of their homes' interiors.  And the sets are incredibly realistic, especially the exteriors featuring the canals.  If you watch the ""Anatomy of the Scene"" extra in the DVD's Special Features (which you should), you'll be amazed at how much of that was built for the film, not just found in some small European town.  It genuinely looks 300 years old.I also really liked the energy of the film.  For a small, dark historical fiction, the tension is everywhere. The previously-mentioned tension between the artist and the maid is just the beginning, more than equalled by tension between artist and patron, between husband and wife, between child and servant, and even the tension of a household struggling to ""keep up appearances"" while practically broke, in order to bring in more much-needed money.  All of which is very nicely accented by a great musical score.All in all, it's a quiet, subtle film that is anything but uplifting, but it's executed so well that you really should see it.",4,A Very Good Movie of a Slightly Better Book,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2788,"['Based', 'tightly', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'scene', 'consolidation', 'event', 'rearranging', 'required', 'when', 'converting', 'most', 'novels', 'film', 'Especially', 'novel', 'nuances', 'complexities', 'one', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'book', 'film', 'story', '3rd', 'person', 'Even', 'so', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'terrific', 'job', 'capturing', 'tension', 'attraction', 'master', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'title', 'character', 'house', 'maid', 'whom', 'shares', 'understanding', 'love', 'color', 'light', 'composition', 'even', 'materials', 'painting', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'lesser', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'cheap', 'easy', 'change', 'sexual', 'affair', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'more', 'tickets', 'undercut', 'Vermeer', 'passion', 'art', 'ignored', 'book', 'core', 'plot', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'addition', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'board', 'Johansson', 'terrific', 'very', 'specific', 'visual', 'demands', 'lead', 'role', 'perfectly', 'well', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'nuances', 'would', 'make', 'break', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'mix', 'handsome', 'sophisticate', 'creepy', 'slimeball', 'so', 'many', 'roles', 'have', 'called', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'so', 'wanly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'want', 'hug', 'slap', 'her.Of', 'course', 'book', 'more', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'scenes', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'thinking', 'detail', 'excellent', 'art', 'direction', 'photography', 'film', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'lost', 'conversion', 'not', 'just', 'filming', 'consistently', 'lush', 'rich', 'accurately', 'way', 'master', 'painters', 'Holland', 'painted', 'time', 'right', 'down', 'darkness', 'homes', 'interiors', 'sets', 'are', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'especially', 'exteriors', 'featuring', 'canals', 'watch', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'extra', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'should', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'built', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'found', 'small', 'European', 'town', 'genuinely', '300', 'years', 'old.I', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'energy', 'film', 'small', 'dark', 'historical', 'fiction', 'tension', 'everywhere', 'previously-mentioned', 'tension', 'artist', 'maid', 'just', 'beginning', 'more', 'equalled', 'tension', 'artist', 'patron', 'husband', 'wife', 'child', 'servant', 'even', 'tension', 'household', 'struggling', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'practically', 'broke', 'order', 'bring', 'more', 'much-needed', 'money', 'very', 'nicely', 'accented', 'great', 'musical', 'score.All', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'film', 'anything', 'uplifting', 'executed', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'should', 'see']",N/A

In my experience, seldom does a film even begin to capture the beauty of a good book.  However, this film has shown me that my previous theory is not always true; &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; captures most, if not all, of the beauty of the book while maintaining cinematic excellence.While I do agree with a few of the other reviewers' view that certain wonderful parts of the book were left out of the movie, this is understandable; for the most part, I feel that the right moments were captured.I do believe that my favorite aspects of this film are the colors used and the silence that prevails throughout the film.  The colors used were absolutely beautiful: almost too dark, plush, real. The strategically-placed lack of talking also left more the imagination, making it easy for viewers to fill in the silences with imagined thoughts.I also thought that the casting was perfect.  Scarlett Johansson resembles the girl with a pearl earring in Vermeer's famous painting very closely, and Colin Firth portrayed Vermeer with a skill I never knew he had.This tale of a girl whose blinded father can no longer support her Protestant family and is forced to send her off to be a maid in a Catholic artist's household is poignant and vividly &quot;painted&quot; into a masterpiece of a film.  The underlying emotions between silences and syllables are heartwrenching and true to human form.I would recommend this beautiful film to anyone with interest in art, history, or wonderfully-told fiction.

809463,A183RGDCCC913M,B0001KZNV0,"Hugh S. Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[5, 7]","Johannes Vermeer is now considered to be one of the great Dutch master-painters. But shortly after his death in 1675, his work was all but forgotten. It wasn't until the late 19th century that his astonishing stroke was once more familiar in the psyche of art historians the world over, despite only a fraction of his paintings still existing.I hardly consider myself to be much of an art scholar, but I must say Vermeer's artwork has always caught my eye. His stellar proficiency in capturing not only space and composition, but also the intangible, has long snared a parcel of intrigue in my mind.Sure, Vermeer was extraordinary at casting everything visible to the naked eye to canvas, but I am more impressed with his ability to capture allegory and inner radiance in his oil productions. Iconography is the word I seek. In fact, there is one Vermeer painting that to this day nearly moves me to tears for this reason. The magnum opus is aptly referred to as ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" the focal point of the motion picture by the same title.""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" is a gloriously photographed fictional account of Vermeer (Colin Firth) and his infamous subject (Scarlett Johansson). Adapted from the novel by Tracy Chevalier, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" it marks Peter Webber's filmmaking debut.Although admittedly slow - audible snoozing was evident in the theater - the film glimmers with breathtaking beauty. Every shot is a virtual representation of a Vermeer painting.Besides the astounding photography, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" acts as a flawless period piece. The costuming, set design and dialogue are all perfect. It truly feels as though the spectator is whisked away to 17th century Holland.The acting is phenomenal. Truth be told, it troubles me that Johansson was shunned by the Academy for her role as a bashful, yet strong-willed maid providing for Master Vermeer and his materialistic spouse.Tom Wilkinson also puts forth a stunning performance as the artist's chief benefactor. In those days, it was customary for the artists to thank their benefactors with a feast. One wonders if he backs Vermeer out of appreciation for his art or out of his desire for a hearty meal.In addition, the forbidden romance shared between Vermeer and the simple-minded chambermaid is one of outright resplendence. Vermeer's wife fails to gather the implications of his craft, but it is the maid that fully understands the significance of every layer, every square millimeter, of paint that coats the canvas. When Vermeer asks her to describe the color of the clouds, she at first says white.

Eduardo Serra's cinematography is brilliant and captures, remarkably, the luminescent quality of light in Delft - the same light which Vermeer so skillfully put to use in his masterpieces. Serra's visuals give us a glimpse of what Holland must have been like in 1665. Through Director Peter Webber's camera we view scenes as if they are painted on canvas - the shimmer of silk cloth, of water in the canals, of the sun on snow; the haze of sunlight through clouds, light through a window; the brilliance of color contrasted with dark shadows; scenes as beautifully composed as a great painting. Daylight, candle and shadow are used dramatically. The atmosphere is as rich as an artist's palette.Not much is known about the Dutch master, who lived and worked in 17th century Delft. Only 35 of his paintings survive. Among these works, perhaps his greatest, is the portrait, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring.&quot; Director Webber has transformed Tracy Chevalier's novel, of the same name, into this extraordinary movie for the big screen.Scarlett Johansson is superb as the young servant girl, Griet, who is sent to the Vermeer household to work after her father has an incapacitating accident. The labor is pure drudgery and seemingly endless, with little pay and fewer thanks. Since the Vermeers are dependent on wealthy patrons to commission paintings, money is tight and Vermeer's young wife is pregnant almost every year. Griet's work is made more difficult by jealous coworkers, the brood of spoiled Vermeer children, the suspicious wife and her manipulating mother, (Essie Davis), who holds the purse strings tightly.Griet's unusual intelligence begins to show, as does her curiosity and sensitivity. She is fascinated by Vermeer's work and the world of light and color. She wonders, at one point, whether to wash the murky studio windows and risk losing the precious quality of muted light. This is not just an ordinary maid. She has a quality of stillness and purity about her which attracts Vermeer, (Colin Firth is wonderful as the brooding artist), as well as his super rich, lecherous patron, (Tom Wilkinson). Eventually, Griet is pressured to sit for a portrait, which will, centuries later, be marveled at.The production design and period settings are award-worthy. Olivia Hetreed's screenplay is excellent. She places as much emphasis on silence as she does on dialogue and the result is extremely effective. And the cast is exceptional. Johansson's and Firth's performances are nuanced and subtle.Vermeer is one of my favorite artists and I have traveled far to see his available work.

First-time director Peter Webber makes something of a visual feast out of Tracy Chevalier's extremely thin novel about the painting of one of the world's most beautiful Old Masters. Scarlett Johanssen is ideally cast as Griet, a young Protestant in seventeeth-century Delft who crosses to the Catholic side of the town (where women do not always cover their hair, as she must) to work as a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Within her workaday life Griet discovers the combustible tensions within the Vermeer household, ruled over by his vain and insecure spendthrift wife (Essie Davis) and her shrewd mother (the estimable Judy Parfitt), who must figure out how to market her son-in-law's painting so as to keep their burgeoning household going. Complicating matters even further is their spoiled daughter Cornelia (Alakina Mann, the otherworldly daughter from THE OTHERS), and the fact that both Vermeer and his patron (Tom Wilkinson) cannot  keep their eyes off of the gorgeous Griet. The film takes full advantage of its painterly subject, and each scene is staged and lit so exquisitely it seems to have been painted by Vermeer or his peers. Wisely, Webber and his screenwriter, Olivia Hetreed, keep the dialogue to an absolute minimum, allowing the actors to express what they cannot say to one another in the repressed Delft atnmosphere via looks and body language. Johanssen and Firth have never been better, although the real honors might go to Parfitt (in a marvelously complex performance). And Davis also acquits herself beautifully in her unsympathetic role of Catarina, and gets besides to deliver the film's most classic line when she finally unveils the title painting that has been kept hidden from her.",5,"Quiet, tense, still, and nearly perfect--like the paintings that inspired it",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1838,"['Rarely', 'film', 'adaptation', 'so', 'vastly', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'inspired', 'one', 'First-time', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'something', 'visual', 'feast', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'extremely', 'thin', 'novel', 'painting', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Old', 'Masters', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Griet', 'young', 'Protestant', 'seventeeth-century', 'Delft', 'who', 'Catholic', 'side', 'town', 'where', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'cover', 'hair', 'must', 'work', 'maid', 'house', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'workaday', 'life', 'Griet', 'combustible', 'tensions', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'ruled', 'over', 'vain', 'insecure', 'spendthrift', 'wife', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'shrewd', 'mother', 'estimable', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'who', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'market', 'son-in-law', 'painting', 'so', 'keep', 'burgeoning', 'household', 'going', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'even', 'further', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'Cornelia', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'otherworldly', 'daughter', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'fact', 'Vermeer', 'patron', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'eyes', 'gorgeous', 'Griet', 'film', 'full', 'advantage', 'painterly', 'subject', 'scene', 'staged', 'lit', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'have', 'been', 'painted', 'Vermeer', 'peers', 'Wisely', 'Webber', 'screenwriter', 'Olivia', 'Hetreed', 'keep', 'dialogue', 'absolute', 'minimum', 'allowing', 'actors', 'express', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'one', 'repressed', 'Delft', 'atnmosphere', 'looks', 'body', 'language', 'Johanssen', 'Firth', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'real', 'honors', 'might', 'go', 'Parfitt', 'marvelously', 'complex', 'performance', 'Davis', 'also', 'beautifully', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'Catarina', 'besides', 'deliver', 'film', 'most', 'classic', 'line', 'when', 'finally', 'title', 'painting', 'been', 'kept', 'hidden']",N/A

The filmmakers expertly captured the soft, diffuse light that permeates paintings of the era. The film also captures the otherworldly look of Dutch costumes of the period as well, with their panoply of white lace, starched headgear and pointy ""Pilgrim"" hats. It was amazing to watch street scenes populated by characters for whom such bizarre outfits were considered everyday clothing. If the films were judged solely on costuming and atmosphere, this film would be an instant classic.The film's flaws are with its characters. I haven't read the book, so I'm not aware of plot changes, but some things just didn't work for me. Scarlett Johansson bears an uncanny resemblance to the girl who modeled for the painting, but I think the filmmakers got her personality wrong. The girl in the painting exudes a sly, sensuous sense of confidence, whereas Johansson plays her as timid, repressed and even fearful. This difference is made painfully apparent at the end of the film when a close-up a Johansson dissolves into Vermeer's actual painting.I should have been paying attention to the story -- the illicit fascination of Vermeer (Colin Firth) for his young maid. But the best parts of the movie were about the effects of hand-laundering during winter, about the process of grinding pigments to make paint, about the process of painting and about the effect of afternoon light on Dutch interiors. The movie moves slowly too, as thought rh filmmakers were attempting to portray temporally the airiness and languor of the architecture.All in all, a movie in which there's much less than meets the eye.",3,When imitation does not flatter,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1718,"['anyone', 'who', '17th-century', 'Flemish', 'painting', 'do', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'filmmakers', 'expertly', 'captured', 'soft', 'diffuse', 'light', 'paintings', 'era', 'film', 'also', 'otherworldly', 'look', 'Dutch', 'costumes', 'period', 'well', 'panoply', 'white', 'lace', 'starched', 'headgear', 'pointy', 'Pilgrim', 'hats', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'street', 'scenes', 'populated', 'characters', 'whom', 'such', 'bizarre', 'outfits', 'were', 'considered', 'everyday', 'clothing', 'films', 'were', 'judged', 'solely', 'costuming', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'instant', 'classic.The', 'film', 'flaws', 'are', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'plot', 'changes', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'girl', 'who', 'modeled', 'painting', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'personality', 'wrong', 'girl', 'painting', 'sly', 'sensuous', 'sense', 'confidence', 'whereas', 'Johansson', 'timid', 'repressed', 'even', 'fearful', 'difference', 'made', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'close-up', 'Johansson', 'Vermeer', 'actual', 'painting.I', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'story', 'illicit', 'fascination', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'young', 'maid', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'effects', 'hand-laundering', 'winter', 'process', 'grinding', 'pigments', 'make', 'paint', 'process', 'painting', 'effect', 'afternoon', 'light', 'Dutch', 'interiors', 'movie', 'slowly', 'too', 'thought', 'rh', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'attempting', 'portray', 'temporally', 'airiness', 'languor', 'architecture.All', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'eye']",N/A

If for nothing else, one should 'study' this film for its gorgeous play of light and shadows to create that picturesque setting which was uniquely 17th century Dutch, and which defined Vermeer as one of the greats of his era.  However, what defined this movie for me was the ending.  Some reviewers complain that it was vastly underrated, especially compared to the twisted and dramatic finish of the book from which this movie is based on, but I found it rather suitable when, soon after, the movie comes to a complete end with a still of the painting itself.  For me, it was as if the movie was saying: ""take a look, and tell me how betrayed she must have felt when she got the earrings; and glean from that how warm and full of hope she must have felt while she was sitting for the painting itself.""  perhaps others may interpret it different, but, after the 90 min movie, my perception of Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was both completed and reinforced - a girl full of hope for the future, represented in subtle eloquence with a single earring.

809469,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0001KZNV0,Joe Sherry,"[6, 6]","A film by Peter WebberHave you ever looked at a painting and wondered who sat for the portrait and what her story may be?  Or what the inspiration behind a particular painting was?  Tracy Chevalier apparently has because four of her novels have dealt with this very idea.  Her most popular novel was ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", which looks into one possible origin for the famous Vermeer painting of the same name.  Peter Webber's 2003 film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is an adaptation of Chevalier's bestselling novel.Griet (Scarlet Johansson) is a young Dutch girl living in the 1600's.  Her family is poor, so she is hired as a maid in the household of the painter, Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth).  This is a very big opportunity for her, though she is viewed with suspicion by Vermeer's wife because he has been indiscreet with the maids in the past.  Griet is a quiet girl and is assigned the basic drudge work of cleaning.  When she is cleaning Vermeer's studio, being careful not to move anything, Master Vermeer notices her, permits her to continue to work while he is around, and eventually permits Griet to help him.  Helping Vermeer means, at various times, mixing paint and posing for portraits to be used as a guide to help Vermeer paint.  From this develops a bond between Griet and Vermeer (or perhaps it happens because of the bond), and Griet ultimately becomes the subject of Vermeer's famous and somewhat mysterious painting.""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" can almost be described as a silent film.  Griet has very little dialogue, but Scarlet Johansson is able to portray Griet so well that she is a compelling character even without dialogue.  Johansson's acting is such that without speaking we are being told a story and being given characterization.  Besides Johansson's work, the other main point of note is simply how beautiful this movie is.  To make an overly obvious comparison, it is like a painting.  This makes sense since the movie is about a particular painting as well as being partly inside the world of Vermeer and art.  To be honest, little needs to be said during ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and the film does not suffer for it.Given Vermeer's past history with the family's maids, and given Griet's beauty (she is pursued also by the butcher's son as well as Vermeer's patron); there is a suspicion of impropriety between Griet and Vermeer.  The movie suggests that there might be more to the relationship, and the household believes it, but there is certainly a level of attraction between Griet and Vermeer.  It is very understated, but with looks and visual suggestion and maybe even the lack of dialogue helps foster this impression.Scarlet Johansson was nominated for two Golden Globes in 2003 for her work in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  Many feel that ""Lost in Translation"" was her stronger work and that she had deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award.  I agree that she should have been nominated, but for ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"".  Here she is being asked to carry the movie with very little dialogue.

They are both lost opportunities of creating movies about artists, composers which reflect truth.  How much more exciting, interesting and moving would it have been if it had followed what we know of the life of the artist and the creation of the painting...which is not much, but less is more.In this one, we know little about the life of Vermeer, so what do directors, screenwriters, producers do...they make up salacious sensational soap-opera events to attract the 21st century movie going audience.  What they have done is blasphemous to the integrity and art of Vermeer.  Why couldn't we have had a movie about ONLY the creation of this incredible painting...""The Girl with the Pearl Earring""?

809471,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0001KZNV0,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 2]","This film was nominated for three academy awards: Art Direction, Costume Design, and Cinematography. Unfortunately for it, The Return of the King, and Master & Commander, were also nominated for those categories. Stiff competition.Mind you, this film was a marvelous evocation of its period and of Delft (they actually filmed there, amongst other places), from the cutting of the vegetables in the opening scene to the vividly and beautifully painted interior lid of the harpsichord played by Vermeer's mostly unhappy wife. We even have a powerful sense of smell, from Griet's rejection of the meat for not being fresh, to the dumping of garbage into the river (street) outside their home. This is where the movie succeeded brilliantly - in sensory images. And that's appropriate, as the movie is about one of the greatest works of art by one of the world's greatest artists.Scarlet Johansson once again plays the role of a younger woman whose fate is entwined with an older man, but - and sorry to all of you fans of Lost in Translation - this is simply a better, more believable film. Her character, Griet, is a poor girl sent to work in the home of Vermeer, and from the moment she sets foot into Vermeer's studio (to clean it, of course) you can sense her relation to his work. The very first indication we get of this is when she asks Vermeer's wife if she should clean the windows. The wife has no idea why this should be important, but when Griet informs her that it would affect the lighting, Vermeer's wife says yes, of course. We see that Vermeer has a wife and mother-in-law who care nothing for his art, who see him as a meal ticket. Here he is seen as almost maddeningly misunderstood, and although allusions are drawn to perhaps a previous indiscretion with a serving girl, it is Griet's character who understands him. Indeed, she took it upon herself to move a chair away from the set of one of his paintings, and explained later that it appeared to be blocking her (ostensibly, Griet, for the painting was inspired by her cleaning of the studio windows) in. We see that immediately after this, Vermeer paints the chair out of the picture.However, there were flaws. Griet's ""love interest"", Pieter, has at most ten minutes of screen time. I was perplexed at his inclusion, and could only guess that he existed for one reason: that when Griet felt sexual tension occurring between her and Vermeer, she instead ran to Pieter. Whatever her reasons for that were, she kept them quiet. Her dialogue was limited to very few lines, and she communicated mostly through her eyes. Perhaps this was done on purpose, to call to mind the painting that gives the film its name. Unfortunately, in a film, more communication is necessary than in a painting. I would have liked to see her character more interactive. But that's just my tiny, humble opinion.As a side note, for anyone interested in young adult books, an excellent book was just released, Chasing Vermeer, which is available here on amazon.com. It's kind of a Da Vinci Code for kids, and although it's for young adults, the scholarship on Vermeer is top notch.",4,Just like the painting,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3123,"['film', 'was', 'nominated', 'three', 'academy', 'awards', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Cinematography', 'Unfortunately', 'Return', 'King', 'Master', 'Commander', 'were', 'also', 'nominated', 'categories', 'Stiff', 'competition.Mind', 'film', 'was', 'marvelous', 'evocation', 'period', 'Delft', 'actually', 'filmed', 'other', 'places', 'cutting', 'vegetables', 'opening', 'scene', 'vividly', 'beautifully', 'painted', 'interior', 'lid', 'harpsichord', 'played', 'Vermeer', 'mostly', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'even', 'have', 'powerful', 'sense', 'smell', 'Griet', 'rejection', 'meat', 'not', 'being', 'fresh', 'dumping', 'garbage', 'river', 'street', 'home', 'where', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', 'sensory', 'images', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'works', 'art', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'artists.Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'once', 'again', 'role', 'younger', 'woman', 'fate', 'entwined', 'older', 'man', 'sorry', 'fans', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'simply', 'better', 'more', 'believable', 'film', 'character', 'Griet', 'poor', 'girl', 'sent', 'work', 'home', 'Vermeer', 'moment', 'foot', 'Vermeer', 'studio', 'clean', 'course', 'can', 'sense', 'relation', 'work', 'very', 'first', 'indication', 'get', 'when', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'should', 'clean', 'windows', 'wife', 'idea', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'important', 'when', 'Griet', 'would', 'affect', 'lighting', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'yes', 'course', 'see', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', 'who', 'nothing', 'art', 'who', 'see', 'meal', 'ticket', 'Here', 'seen', 'almost', 'maddeningly', 'misunderstood', 'allusions', 'are', 'drawn', 'perhaps', 'previous', 'indiscretion', 'serving', 'girl', 'Griet', 'character', 'who', 'Indeed', 'took', 'upon', 'move', 'chair', 'away', 'set', 'one', 'paintings', 'explained', 'later', 'appeared', 'be', 'blocking', 'ostensibly', 'Griet', 'painting', 'was', 'inspired', 'cleaning', 'studio', 'windows', 'see', 'immediately', 'Vermeer', 'chair', 'picture.However', 'were', 'flaws', 'Griet', 'love', 'interest', 'Pieter', 'most', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'perplexed', 'inclusion', 'could', 'only', 'guess', 'existed', 'one', 'reason', 'when', 'Griet', 'felt', 'sexual', 'tension', 'occurring', 'Vermeer', 'instead', 'ran', 'Pieter', 'reasons', 'were', 'kept', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'was', 'limited', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'communicated', 'mostly', 'eyes', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'call', 'mind', 'painting', 'film', 'name', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'more', 'communication', 'necessary', 'painting', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'character', 'more', 'interactive', 'just', 'tiny', 'humble', 'opinion.As', 'side', 'note', 'anyone', 'interested', 'young', 'adult', 'books', 'excellent', 'book', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'Chasing', 'Vermeer', 'available', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'kind', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'kids', 'young', 'adults', 'scholarship', 'Vermeer', 'top', 'notch']",N/A

Tracy Chevalier's story is greatly transported to the big screen by director Peter Webber. But that's not what's best about ""Girl with a pearl earring"".Like Leonardo's Mona Lisa, nobody is sure about who was Jan Vermeer's model for his most famous portrait. Tracy Chevalier's story took care of that. The book is very enjoyable, leaving the reader's imagination work free, but when you're reading about Vermeer, and his paintings are an important part of the plot, you feel something is missing. And this ""something"" are concrete visions of his fantastic works. Some of them were displayed in the movie. But Peter Webber went further, and, with help of Director of Cinematography Eduardo Serra, transformed the whole movie in a Vermeer painting.There evidently is an enormous care taken concerning historic portrayal. Watching the movie, the viewer feels he's in 17th century Delft. The supporting cast is great in the sense that it helps creating the ancient atmosphere. For example, the maid Tanneke (who was the model for Vermeer's ""Milkmaid"") is played by Joanna Scanlan, who really looks (at least in the movie) like a dutch maid from 350 years ago. The figure, the scenery, the chosen colors, all great. Many of the frames are purposedly created to resemble Vermeer's paintings: the light, the objects, the gestures of the people. Sometimes, during the movie, I caught myself with a hanging jaw, truly emotioned by the beauty of the scenes.All this bonded together by the simple soundscore, present always at the right moments, and by rising star Scarlett Johanson's acting: strong, objective, believable.

809474,A2EERM752BMSQD,B0001KZNV0,just some guy,"[1, 1]","I'll go against the grain here and say I think the movie is better than the book, mostly because the format of a movie in general is a third-person viewpoint of events. We are voyeurs while watching films, witnessing events and intimate moments like hidden ghosts. Griet's character in the movie is more believable, she's illiterate, she's hard working, she's ignorant of many things (but far from stupid). But the book makes the mistake of using Griet as the narrator of the book, as if we are to believe she's telling us what's happening. I just don't buy it. An illiterate character telling her story like a novelist? Nuh uh. It jolts me out of any realism the book tries to convey. However, the movie is like a secret camera capturing the subtle and VERY important language of the face and eyes. Most of the movie is short on dialogue, but FULL of expressive language by way of body movement and glances of the eyes and even the use of clothing. The movie's plot or story has been boiled down by many other reviews, so there's no need to keep mining that ore. But I've heard some people complain about how the characters don't &quot;talk&quot; enough. But this movie communicates more with expressions of the face than anything words could do. Colin Firth, who plays Vermeer, has even said he wished the movie had LESS dialogue. The choice of Scarlett Johansson is perfect, and it's sad to think most people consider the talented delivery of lines to be the barometer of &quot;good acting,&quot; because it's rare to see someone brilliantly convey so much emotion and &quot;language&quot; without even talking. I don't know if Johansson is consciously aware how expressive and talented she is with her eyes and face, but it doesn't matter - she's a gem. And it's very important to get the right actors in a movie like this. They wanted Kate Hudson at first, but she backed away at the last minute. What a relief. I think she would have ruined the movie, or at least degraded it to subpar quality. The movie might be boring for those who are too immersed in the culture of babbling. We in America are blunted by talking heads, talking friends, talking and words and more talking. But in the class society of Vermeer's world, where maids are to keep quiet until spoken to, and where people don't babble at each other with any random thought that occurs to them, holding the tongue was a way of life. But if you can transport yourself away from modern culture and enter this movie with an open mind, there's a treasure of beauty and intelligence.

The cool, blonde fragility of Griet is a striking contrast to the fiery Mrs. Vermeer. Griet's youth and simplicity balances against Vermeer's jaded brooding. The blindness of Griet's beloved father is opposed by the ability of her beloved Vermeer to see in impossible detail.I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the novel, as well as esthetically pleasing and very well cast.

The ambiguity is obvious when the story unfolds as there are so many missed moments where words where not exchanged, actions were not taken, and feelings not expressed.  These moments are the very essence of the film as they set the audience free in an artistic environment that encourages cerebral participation.Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is sent away from home to work for the Vermeer as a maid.  The Vermeer can afford luxuries and maids through Johannes Vermeer's (Colin Firth), a Dutch painter in the mid-1600s, paintings that are usually ordered.  Johannes lives with his wife and children under his mother-in-laws strict rule, which seems to suffocate Johannes artistically.  However, Griet's presence appears to cheer up Johannes as his artistic drought suddenly seems to have faced a monsoon of creativity.Johannes discovers that Griet is an untapped well of artistic talent as she begins to mix his colors with extraordinary detail for hue, tint, and shade.  The paint mixing becomes an allegorical symbol how the two unite without truly expressing feelings for one another.  A connection between Griet and Johannes is unthinkable as several factors meddle between them such as the mother-in-law's iron fist, Johannes wife's vivid insecurity, and the daughter's envy.The director Peter Webber grabs the audience with the same subtle force that Vermeer's paintings seize the viewer.  Vermeer's paintings trigger the audience's curiosity through the expressed uncertainty which seemingly hides some secrets that demand answers.  These answers are left for the audience to ponder as the film is highly introspective, and is delivered with a painters gentle touch.",5,Brilliantly Ambiguous & Visually Stunning!!!,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,1793,"['Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'ambiguous', 'painting', 'same', 'name', 'ambiguity', 'obvious', 'when', 'story', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'moments', 'where', 'words', 'where', 'not', 'exchanged', 'actions', 'were', 'not', 'taken', 'feelings', 'not', 'expressed', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'essence', 'film', 'set', 'audience', 'free', 'artistic', 'environment', 'cerebral', 'participation.Griet', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'sent', 'away', 'home', 'work', 'Vermeer', 'maid', 'Vermeer', 'can', 'afford', 'luxuries', 'maids', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Dutch', 'painter', 'mid-1600s', 'paintings', 'are', 'usually', 'ordered', 'Johannes', 'wife', 'children', 'mother-in-laws', 'strict', 'rule', 'suffocate', 'Johannes', 'artistically', 'However', 'Griet', 'presence', 'cheer', 'up', 'Johannes', 'artistic', 'drought', 'suddenly', 'have', 'faced', 'monsoon', 'creativity.Johannes', 'discovers', 'Griet', 'untapped', 'well', 'artistic', 'talent', 'mix', 'colors', 'extraordinary', 'detail', 'hue', 'tint', 'shade', 'paint', 'mixing', 'becomes', 'allegorical', 'symbol', 'how', 'two', 'unite', 'truly', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'one', 'connection', 'Griet', 'Johannes', 'unthinkable', 'several', 'factors', 'meddle', 'such', 'mother-in-law', 'iron', 'fist', 'Johannes', 'wife', 'vivid', 'insecurity', 'daughter', 'envy.The', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'grabs', 'audience', 'same', 'subtle', 'force', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'seize', 'viewer', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'audience', 'curiosity', 'expressed', 'uncertainty', 'seemingly', 'secrets', 'demand', 'answers', 'answers', 'are', 'left', 'audience', 'ponder', 'film', 'highly', 'introspective', 'delivered', 'painters', 'gentle', 'touch']",N/A

Colin Firth portrays Vermeer as a perpetually brooding, demanding, and ultimately spineless phantom who cares only for his art.  Griet must also handle with diplomacy the unwelcome advances of the artist's patron, while unsure of her feelings for the attentive young butcher.The story is slight and almost secondary to the photography here.  Each frame of the movie is filmed with an emphasis on a warm, natural light source that fills each scene with a radiant glow.  I found myself holding my breath while watching the film, as one does in the presence of sheer loveliness.Johannsson is perfect as the young maid and Firth seethes with intensity.

809486,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B0001KZNV0,Larry L. Looney,"[4, 6]","...it permeates and imbues the masterpieces that flowed from the brush of Johannes Vermeer - and it breathes life and subtle but tangible vitality into this wonderfully filmed adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's best-selling novel of the same title.  Chevalier says that her book looks at the creation of a painting - one of the great works of art of the 17th century - and imagines the story behind it.  Working closely with the author, Olivia Hetreed has produced a script that skillfully converts the images of Chevalier's glowing prose into light and images and actions on the screen - a daunting task, especially in this case.  Choosing to illuminate the differences between the classes at play in this story through images more than dialogue placed an additional burden on the shoulders of the director and actors - but they have managed it very nicely indeed.Scarlett Johansson is nothing short of luminous - appropriate in a Vermeer subject - in the title role of Griet, a seventeen year-old girl who has come to live in the home of the artist and his large, continuously growing family.  Aside from the dynamics at play between the classes - masters and servants - there are emotional and psychological forces involved as well.  The artist's wife is a stunningly beautiful by neurotic and insecure woman.  Her mother, who lives with them and manages the household with a necessarily tight fist, is so dedicated to their collective financial survival (bankruptcy claims neighbors, and looms over the Vermeer household ominously) that she is willing to accept her son-in-law's obsession with Griet in order that he be inspired to create yet another great painting - the commission of which is of vital monetary importance to the family.Colin Firth is cast well as the great master, Johannes Vermeer - he plays the `tortured artiste' angle gently but realistically, never going over the top with it.  He obviously loves his wife - but his almost immediate fascination with Griet blossoms into a driving obsession.  Without acting on their feelings by more than an occasional touch or a lingering glance, the two learn from and inspire each other immeasurably - Vermeer is astonished to find within Griet a kindred spirit, the soul of an artist in the body of a serving girl.  The film hints at her understanding of the interplay of colour and light - the novel, understandably, goes into it in much greater detail - but the script and the fine work of the cast and crew pull it off very well indeed.The dark force at play in this story is Vermeer's patron and benefactor, Master van Ruijven, portrayed with oily excellence by Tom Wilkinson.  A man whose wealth is seemingly out of reach of any potential creditors, van Ruijven revels in his position, in his ability to coerce and direct the actions of Vermeer and his family as if they were marionettes.  When he first sets eyes on Griet, the dark lust within him can be seen to smoulder - and he sets about machinating stress and anxiety in the Vermeer household as if it were his personal toy.Griet's family background is portrayed with much more detail in the novel - her father is a former artisan, a tile maker, blinded in an accident, depending on the meager support offered by the Guild to sustain his family.  When it becomes clear that this small stipend will not be enough for them to survive, the decision is made that Griet should go to work for Vermeer - and arrangement made through the Guild.  When she moves into the artist's home, she takes with her a lovely tile that her father had made years before, as a physical token of his presence and importance in her life.The pace of the film is slow and careful - befitting the mood and look of Vermeer's paintings.  The cinematography is gorgeous throughout - as pointed out by other reviewers, there are many scenes that come as close as commercial cinema can come to the atmosphere of one of the master's paintings.  It's a stunningly beautiful film, and a captivating story - all in all, a job very well done.The DVD edition available at this time doesn't boast many extras - but a nice bonus is the `Anatomy of a scene' feature from the Sundance Channel, which takes the lavish banquet scene from the film and examines the 'hows' and 'whys' of the methods used in filming it.  It features snippets of interviews with the director, author, screenwriter and Johansson - some longer versions of these interviews would be nice in a later edition.",5,THAT EVANESECENT DELFT LIGHT...,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,4461,"['masterpieces', 'flowed', 'brush', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'life', 'subtle', 'tangible', 'vitality', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Chevalier', 'book', 'creation', 'painting', 'one', 'great', 'works', 'art', '17th', 'century', 'imagines', 'story', 'Working', 'closely', 'author', 'Olivia', 'Hetreed', 'produced', 'script', 'skillfully', 'images', 'Chevalier', 'glowing', 'prose', 'light', 'images', 'actions', 'screen', 'daunting', 'task', 'especially', 'case', 'Choosing', 'illuminate', 'differences', 'classes', 'play', 'story', 'images', 'more', 'dialogue', 'placed', 'additional', 'burden', 'shoulders', 'director', 'actors', 'have', 'managed', 'very', 'nicely', 'indeed.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'nothing', 'short', 'luminous', 'appropriate', 'Vermeer', 'subject', 'title', 'role', 'Griet', 'seventeen', 'year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'come', 'live', 'home', 'artist', 'large', 'continuously', 'growing', 'family', 'Aside', 'dynamics', 'play', 'classes', 'masters', 'servants', 'are', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'forces', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'artist', 'wife', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'neurotic', 'insecure', 'woman', 'mother', 'who', 'household', 'necessarily', 'tight', 'fist', 'so', 'dedicated', 'collective', 'financial', 'survival', 'bankruptcy', 'neighbors', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'ominously', 'willing', 'accept', 'son-in-law', 'obsession', 'Griet', 'order', 'be', 'inspired', 'create', 'yet', 'great', 'painting', 'commission', 'vital', 'monetary', 'importance', 'family.Colin', 'Firth', 'cast', 'well', 'great', 'master', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'tortured', 'artiste', 'angle', 'gently', 'realistically', 'never', 'going', 'top', 'obviously', 'wife', 'almost', 'immediate', 'fascination', 'Griet', 'blossoms', 'driving', 'obsession', 'acting', 'feelings', 'more', 'occasional', 'touch', 'lingering', 'glance', 'two', 'learn', 'inspire', 'other', 'immeasurably', 'Vermeer', 'astonished', 'find', 'Griet', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'soul', 'artist', 'body', 'serving', 'girl', 'film', 'hints', 'understanding', 'interplay', 'colour', 'light', 'novel', 'understandably', 'much', 'greater', 'detail', 'script', 'fine', 'work', 'cast', 'crew', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'indeed.The', 'dark', 'force', 'play', 'story', 'Vermeer', 'patron', 'benefactor', 'Master', 'van', 'Ruijven', 'portrayed', 'oily', 'excellence', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'A', 'man', 'wealth', 'seemingly', 'reach', 'potential', 'creditors', 'van', 'Ruijven', 'revels', 'position', 'ability', 'coerce', 'direct', 'actions', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'were', 'marionettes', 'When', 'first', 'eyes', 'Griet', 'dark', 'lust', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'smoulder', 'machinating', 'stress', 'anxiety', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'were', 'personal', 'toy.Griet', 'family', 'background', 'portrayed', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'novel', 'father', 'former', 'artisan', 'tile', 'maker', 'blinded', 'accident', 'depending', 'meager', 'support', 'offered', 'Guild', 'sustain', 'family', 'When', 'clear', 'small', 'stipend', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'survive', 'decision', 'made', 'Griet', 'should', 'go', 'work', 'Vermeer', 'arrangement', 'made', 'Guild', 'When', 'artist', 'home', 'lovely', 'tile', 'father', 'had', 'made', 'years', 'before', 'physical', 'token', 'presence', 'importance', 'life.The', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'careful', 'befitting', 'mood', 'look', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'pointed', 'out', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'come', 'as', 'close', 'commercial', 'cinema', 'can', 'come', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'master', 'paintings', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'captivating', 'story', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'available', 'time', ""n't"", 'boast', 'many', 'extras', 'nice', 'bonus', 'Anatomy', 'scene', 'feature', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'lavish', 'banquet', 'scene', 'film', ""'hows"", ""'whys"", 'methods', 'used', 'filming', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'director', 'author', 'screenwriter', 'Johansson', 'longer', 'versions', 'interviews', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'later', 'edition']",N/A

The film is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, with a screenplay by Olivia Hetreed, that imagines a whole story behind Johannes Vermeer's painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (1665-66) involving the Dutch painter, his family, and the model he used for what is his most famous and most intriguing painting.Griet (Scarlett Johannson), is a young girl from a Calvinist family who has to seek employment as a maid in the Roman Catholic household of the famous painter.

Before she meets the artist (peter Firth), Griet sees his current painting, ""Woman with a Pearl Necklace"" (1664-65) and we can tell from her eyes that she is looking at something wondrous.We know that Griet is no fool, because she refuses to accept bad meat from the local butcher, which causes his son, Pieter (Cillian Murphy), to notice her.  But in the house she is beneath notice, told not to speak until spoken to first.  One day she asks the ladies of the house, Catharina and her mother, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), if when she is cleaning the studio if she should do the windows.  Her concern is that doing so would change the light.  The women look at her without comprehension and Catharina tells her to go ahead and clean the windows.  For Maria these are just paintings, things that allow her son-in-law to make money, but for Griet they are something else, and it while cleaning the windows in the corner of the studio that Vermeer used in most of his paintings, that the artists sees her and discovers a new source of inspiration.The fact that neither his perpetually pregnant wife nor his coin counting mother-in-law has any appreciation for art explains in large part why Vermeer is drawn to Griet.  She might not be able to read but he asks her what color are the clouds, she knows the obvious answer is not right for a painter and comes up with the correct one.  But then when Vermeer shows her the canvas he is working on, ""Young Woman with a Water Pitcher"" (1994-65), she knew that the colors were all wrong, and he explains why.This is a film in which the most erotic moment comes when we finally see Griet's hair, although others might disagree and find mixing paints to be the height of the film's sexuality.  But I tended to dismiss such things because I find ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" to be about an intimacy that transcends the mere physical realm of sex (the actual painting is of intimate size, 18 by 16 inches).  Whatever feelings they might have for each other have to be expressed in other ways, because this is a film that has its sensibilities firmly set in the world of art in the 17th century.  Besides, the venality of man is amply represented by Vermeer's patron, the wealthy businessman Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson).Ultimately the film comes down to not just the girl, but to the pearl earring, which belongs to Catharine, but which Vermeer insists must be dangling from Griet's ear in the portrait.  Griet knows this is going too far, but we know that she cannot deny him in the end, especially since we have seen the finished painting, which is one of the most beguiling in art history this side of ""The Mona Lisa.""  But also because she is given a push in a somewhat surprising move by one of the characters.  The notion that if this is romance it is of a transcendent type that cannot be judged by normal rules.  He immortalizes her in a painting and what does she do in return?  She lets him pierce her ear and of equal importance, she moves a chair.  I so admire films that can work on that lyrical a level.This 2003 film has been nominated for Oscars for Cinematography Eduardo Serra, Art Direction, set director Ben van Os and set decorator Cecile Heidman, and Costume Design by Dien van Straalen.  All clearly take their inspiration from Vermeer's paintings.  The lighting throughout the film reflects that of Vermeer's studio, which means it never looks quite as good when we are elsewhere, because the studio is the heart of the film.  Tanneke (Joanna Scanlan), the family maid, looks like ""The Milkmaid"" (1958-60) and Vermeer's wife at one point is costumed exactly like ""Woman in Blue Reading a Letter"" (1663-64).Like the painting from which it takes its name and whose enduring image naturally ends the film, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is Quiet and contemplative.  The entire story is speculative because little is known about Vermeer besides his 35 painting, and whether his model for this one was his daughter, a neighbor, or a tradeswoman, no one will ever know.  But it is impossible not to look at this painting without wondering who this girl was and what thoughts are going through her mind.Johannson's performance commands the film, although she is seldom required to speak and rarely asked what she might be thinking.  Parfitt as the true power in the Vermeer household offers the other stellar performance, while Firth's dazzling charm from other films is sublimated to his character's artistic temperament.  Of course, the greatest compliment that can be paid to first time director Peter Webber is that he has crafted this film with the same care that Vermeer used in painting his own canvases.",5,The

809489,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001KZNV0,Lawyeraau,"[11, 13]","Based upon a best selling book of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, they were not fully realized. While the cinematography is exquisite, as every frame brings to mind a Vermeer painting or one by an old Dutch master, the film is static and becomes  enervated, sinking into a torpor that not even its beauty can cure.The story line seems fairly simple. A pretty and seemingly intelligent Dutch girl, Griet (Scarlett Johansson), daughter of an artisan with failing eyesight, goes to work as a maid the home of painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), when her family's financial circumstance mandates that she seek employment. While in the Vermeer household, she is caught up in the undercurrents that exist within. When Griet catches the eye of Vermeer's wealthy patron (Tom Wilkinson),  she becomes the object of the patron's lust, the object of Vermeer's wife's (Essie Davis) jealousy, and the subject of one of Vermeer's most noted paintings.Unfortunately, the storyline is static in its presentation, never fully realizing any of its plots or sub-plots. Too much is left unexplained and too little is alluded  for the viewer to draw inferences to fill in the story gaps.  This is a shame, given the time, expense, and attention to detail given to the entire production.  Consequently, the film moves as if it were a montage of beautifully drafted paintings transplanted to film. It is ponderously slow,  forgetting that it is a film requiring some cohesion of story or plot, something that this film lacks. More telling, it lacks real dramatic tension. It is almost as if the filmmaker  were more interested in the form of the film rather than its substance. Therein lies the rub.Still, the sheer beauty of the cinematography alone makes this film worth seeing. Seventeenth century Holland is painstakingly brought to life. There is no detail that is left to chance in the exquisite re-creation of the environs and material goods of the characters. Much effort is devoted to authenticity of detail. Moreover, the use of lighting is extraordinary, causing every scene to look as if it were a moment captured in time for all posterity. This film was justifiably nominated for an Academy Award in 2004 for its cinematography. I am only surprised that it lost to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.Scarlett Johanssen bears a remarkable resemblance to the subject of the noted painting by Vermeer, and she shimmers with a compelling luminosity throughout the film. She is simply sheer physical perfection in the role. In terms of illuminating the viewer as to the psyche of her character, she falls somewhat short, giving only tantalizing glimpses of what lays beneath her impassive demeanor, as she forms a bond with Vermeer, sharing a seemingly mutual appreciation of aesthetics. Colin Firth, in the role of Vermeer, falls a little short of the mark. Disheveled and seemingly unkempt, he appears doltish and boorish rather than artistic. One gets very little sense of the artist through his performance, but, in all fairness, he has very little dialogue with which to work. Perhaps that is intentional, as a sublimation to his artistry. The viewer is left unsure. Whatever the reason, his performance simply fails to paint a meaningful portrait of the artist.The roles of Vermeer and Griet  are the primary roles, yet they fail to carry the film, as they are too underdeveloped to convey the story the director seems to be trying to tell. Essie Davis gives an excellent performance as Catharina, Vermeer's jealous and histrionic wife. Judy Parfitt is compelling as Maria Thins,  Vermeer's practical and socially conscious mother-in-law. Tom Wilkinson gives a fine performance as the wealthy, lustful patron, Van Ruyven. Cillian Murphy is outstanding as Pieter, the very handsome butcher's boy who falls in love with Griet. Joanna Scanlan is very good in the role of Tannake, the cook and housekeeper. Still, their performances are not sufficient to bring the story together, as they are secondary characters that are as underdeveloped as the primary ones.See the film for its beauty, but do not expect a story that is compelling.",3,LESS THAN PICTURE PERFECT...,1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,4188,"['Based', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'not', 'fully', 'realized', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'frame', 'mind', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'one', 'old', 'Dutch', 'master', 'film', 'static', 'becomes', 'enervated', 'sinking', 'torpor', 'not', 'even', 'beauty', 'can', 'cure.The', 'story', 'line', 'fairly', 'simple', 'pretty', 'seemingly', 'intelligent', 'Dutch', 'girl', 'Griet', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'daughter', 'artisan', 'failing', 'eyesight', 'work', 'maid', 'home', 'painter', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'when', 'family', 'financial', 'circumstance', 'mandates', 'seek', 'employment', 'Vermeer', 'household', 'caught', 'up', 'undercurrents', 'exist', 'When', 'Griet', 'eye', 'Vermeer', 'wealthy', 'patron', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'object', 'patron', 'lust', 'object', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'jealousy', 'subject', 'one', 'Vermeer', 'most', 'noted', 'paintings.Unfortunately', 'storyline', 'static', 'presentation', 'never', 'fully', 'realizing', 'plots', 'sub-plots', 'Too', 'much', 'left', 'unexplained', 'too', 'little', 'alluded', 'viewer', 'draw', 'inferences', 'fill', 'story', 'gaps', 'shame', 'given', 'time', 'expense', 'attention', 'detail', 'given', 'entire', 'production', 'Consequently', 'film', 'moves', 'were', 'montage', 'beautifully', 'drafted', 'paintings', 'transplanted', 'film', 'ponderously', 'slow', 'forgetting', 'film', 'requiring', 'cohesion', 'story', 'plot', 'something', 'film', 'More', 'telling', 'real', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'almost', 'filmmaker', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'form', 'film', 'rather', 'substance', 'Therein', 'rub.Still', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'film', 'seeing', 'Seventeenth', 'century', 'Holland', 'painstakingly', 'brought', 'life', 'detail', 'left', 'chance', 'exquisite', 're-creation', 'environs', 'material', 'goods', 'characters', 'Much', 'effort', 'devoted', 'authenticity', 'detail', 'Moreover', 'use', 'lighting', 'extraordinary', 'causing', 'scene', 'look', 'were', 'moment', 'captured', 'time', 'posterity', 'film', 'was', 'justifiably', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', '2004', 'cinematography', 'am', 'only', 'surprised', 'lost', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World.Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'remarkable', 'resemblance', 'subject', 'noted', 'painting', 'Vermeer', 'compelling', 'luminosity', 'film', 'simply', 'sheer', 'physical', 'perfection', 'role', 'terms', 'illuminating', 'viewer', 'psyche', 'character', 'somewhat', 'short', 'giving', 'only', 'tantalizing', 'glimpses', 'what', 'beneath', 'impassive', 'demeanor', 'bond', 'Vermeer', 'sharing', 'seemingly', 'mutual', 'appreciation', 'aesthetics', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'role', 'Vermeer', 'little', 'short', 'mark', 'Disheveled', 'seemingly', 'unkempt', 'doltish', 'boorish', 'rather', 'artistic', 'One', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'artist', 'performance', 'fairness', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'intentional', 'sublimation', 'artistry', 'viewer', 'left', 'unsure', 'reason', 'performance', 'simply', 'paint', 'meaningful', 'portrait', 'artist.The', 'roles', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'are', 'primary', 'roles', 'yet', 'fail', 'carry', 'film', 'are', 'too', 'underdeveloped', 'convey', 'story', 'director', 'be', 'trying', 'tell', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Catharina', 'Vermeer', 'jealous', 'histrionic', 'wife', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'compelling', 'Maria', 'Thins', 'Vermeer', 'practical', 'socially', 'conscious', 'mother-in-law', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'fine', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'lustful', 'patron', 'Van', 'Ruyven', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'outstanding', 'Pieter', 'very', 'handsome', 'butcher', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'Griet', 'Joanna', 'Scanlan', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Tannake', 'cook', 'housekeeper', 'Still', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'sufficient', 'bring', 'story', 'together', 'are', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'underdeveloped', 'primary', 'film', 'beauty', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'story', 'compelling']",N/A
809490,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0001KZNV0,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","In Peter Webber's directorial debut, we have a slow methodical telling of how Vermeer painted his &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; masterpiece.  Eduardo Serra received his second Oscar nomination for cinematography to follow his first for &quot;The Wings of the Dove.&quot;  While most awards went to the Lord of the Rings, Serra's accomplishment is no less impressive.  The film unfolds as if it were a painting with emphasis being placed on light, shadow and color.  Just as light visually reflects on the space between objects, Webber's often wordless shots reflect on the space between characters, emphasizing relationship as much as plot.Colin Firth from &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; does a breathtaking job as the darkly tempted painter whose talent only barely controls his hormonal attraction to Griet, the maid who becomes the subject of the painting.  Scarlett Johansson who shined in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; with Bill Murray and &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot; comes across as mysterious and self-controlled.  Her continual reactions, uncertainty of youth, and beauty deepen the dialogue and the spaces between words.As Vermeer's wife Catharina, Essie Davis does a marvelous job as the jealous wife.  She seems totally different from her appearances in &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;Matrix Reloaded.&quot;  Her jealously, her rage, her social consciousness are played with such style and grace that I found myself a new fan of this fine actress.  The character of her mother was also well done.Tom Wilkinson usually plays a brooding hurt character such as his Oscar nominated role for &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; or a pompous fellow such as van Juijven, Vermeer's benefactor.  Wilkinson is compiling a quite large body of work after appearances in &quot;The Full Monty,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; that he gives a depth to his characterizations beyond the dialogue.  Here there is menace as he controls the Vermeer purse strings and attempts a quickie with Griet behind the clotheslines.Griet's boyfriend is Irish heartthrob Cillian Murphy who is most known on this side of the Atlantic for &quot;28 Days Later.&quot;  He does a great job as the butcher's son who is Griet's romantic interest.  The film felt a bit abrupt in its ending.  I would have liked to see Griet married to the butcher lad as in the novel rather than seeming to have been hung in space after the completion of the painting.This is an interesting piece.  Vermeer has long been one of my favorite artists.  I thoroughly enjoyed the period piece set in Delft.  Although slow, this film does show an exquisite beauty.  The DVD extras do add to our appreciation for the film.

809491,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0001KZNV0,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 6]","This 2003 film brings the 2001 best-selling novel by Tracy Chevalier to life.  It's the story of a famous painting entitled ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"".  Like the book, the film is also a lesson about art.  In a very direct way we learn about mixing paint and looking for good light and the art of composition. And it's also the story of the painter, Johannes Vermeer, played by Colin firth, and his model, Griet, played by Scarlett Johansson.Of course I never lived in the world of 17th century Holland.  But the film feels so authentic that it makes me think I did.  I get an excellent sense of how it must have been then, a center of the artistic world, in which an inflexible class structure kept the servant class and the upper class severely apart. One of the things I liked about the story was that it kept the relationship between the painter and the servant girl strictly within the limits of the culture.  They do not have a romance in the usual sense of the word.  However, they were both sensitive to artistic composition, and they connected in that way.  Vermeer was married with a houseful of children, a wife who was continually pregnant, and an overbearing mother-in-law.  Griet was a young servant with a natural wisdom.  How this all played out is the author's imagination, of course.  But it is a good story.This is a quiet film.  It moves slowly and with purpose.  And, along the way, we learn about mixing paints and the business of art and the differences in the quality of light.

The film could have explored more into Greit's (Scarlett) background to explain her religious upbringing and how it impacted her relationships with Vermeer (Firth) and his family.  All I know is that she was from some religion that required women to cover their hair.  Also, Mrs. Vermeer could have been made more sympathetic, instead of appearing crazy and rather unattractive from the get go.

But for me, the best part of the movie was the cinematography and set design which does a beautiful job of conveying the suffused and luminous treatment of light in Vermeer's paintings. For that alone I give it four stars.A brief aside here, art forgers of fake masterpieces have actually been caught because they couldn't duplicate Vermeer's technical mastery of light such as his treatment of specular highlights. No painter, even the great Rembrandt van Rijn, who was a contemporary of Vermeer, could paint light and optical effects as Vermeer could.Anyway, I digress on the technical details of Vermeer but obviously a great deal of thought and effort went into the visuals and the set designer and cinematographer deserve a lot of credit for that. I'm a big fan of Vermeer so I just had to see the movie. The emotional climax of the movie is reached when Vermeer's wife discovers Vermeer is painting Johansson's character instead of her and basically flips out. But for the modern viewer it just seems like much ado about nothing. If you're a fan of Vermeer you'll like the visuals and might want to see it just for that.Vermeer clearly painted the maid because he liked how her skin reflected the light. I'm reminded of when the Impressionist painter Renoir was looking for a new model and Gabrielle (who became his favorite and most famous model) first appeared at his door, he exclaimed ""Her skin does not reject the light!""The book stays close to the spirit of the book, although a lot of things had to be left out of the movie. The entire cast, though, is excellent, with finely tuned performances by Colin Firth in an understated and introspective portrayal of Vermeer; Tom Wilkinson as Vermeer's wealthy but lewd patron who manages to seem like he's leering at something even when he isn't; Judy Parfitt as Vermeer's mother and forbiddingly stern matriarch, Essie Davis as Vermeer's overwrought wife; and of course Scarlett Johansson as the deferential, illiterate but not unintelligent maid who nevertheless is the only person in the household with the aesthetic sensibilities to truly appreciate her master.",4,Visually compelling,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2308,"['compelling', 'mood', 'piece', 'ways', 'overall', 'found', 'plot', 'story', 'not', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'portrayal', '17th', 'century', 'domestic', 'Delft', 'very', 'authentic', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'beautiful', 'job', 'conveying', 'suffused', 'luminous', 'treatment', 'light', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'alone', 'give', 'four', 'stars.A', 'brief', 'aside', 'here', 'art', 'forgers', 'fake', 'masterpieces', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'caught', 'could', ""n't"", 'duplicate', 'Vermeer', 'technical', 'mastery', 'light', 'such', 'treatment', 'specular', 'highlights', 'painter', 'even', 'great', 'Rembrandt', 'van', 'Rijn', 'who', 'was', 'contemporary', 'Vermeer', 'could', 'paint', 'light', 'optical', 'effects', 'Vermeer', 'could.Anyway', 'digress', 'technical', 'details', 'Vermeer', 'obviously', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'effort', 'went', 'visuals', 'set', 'designer', 'cinematographer', 'deserve', 'lot', 'credit', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Vermeer', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'emotional', 'climax', 'movie', 'reached', 'when', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'discovers', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'Johansson', 'character', 'instead', 'basically', 'out', 'modern', 'viewer', 'just', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Vermeer', ""'ll"", 'like', 'visuals', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'just', 'that.Vermeer', 'clearly', 'painted', 'maid', 'liked', 'how', 'skin', 'reflected', 'light', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'when', 'Impressionist', 'painter', 'Renoir', 'was', 'looking', 'new', 'model', 'Gabrielle', 'who', 'became', 'favorite', 'most', 'famous', 'model', 'first', 'appeared', 'door', 'exclaimed', 'skin', 'not', 'reject', 'light', 'book', 'close', 'spirit', 'book', 'lot', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'left', 'movie', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'finely', 'tuned', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'understated', 'introspective', 'portrayal', 'Vermeer', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Vermeer', 'wealthy', 'lewd', 'patron', 'who', 'seem', 'leering', 'something', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'Vermeer', 'mother', 'forbiddingly', 'stern', 'matriarch', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'Vermeer', 'overwrought', 'wife', 'course', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'deferential', 'illiterate', 'not', 'unintelligent', 'maid', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'only', 'person', 'household', 'aesthetic', 'sensibilities', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'master']",N/A

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[11, 11]","Peter Webber's film ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" speculates about the events around the painting of Vermeer's masterpiece of the same name.  The art direction, costumes, sets and cinematography do a fantastic job of invoking that time period. Small details such as how the actual paint was made from the various ingredients Vermeer would gather add a wonderful authenticity to the proceedings.Scarlett Johansson portrays Griet, a young woman from a family that has come upon financial hardhip only recently and needs Griet to work to help support the family.  Griet goes to be the maid in the household of the great Painter.As a woman in a male-dominated society of centuries ago, eons before words like ""political correctness"" or ""sexual harrassment"" were coined, Griet is subject to the whims of her social superiors, and as maid almost everyone she meets is socially her superior.  Griet has spunk, though, and I liked the scene where Vermeer's bratty daughter deliberately smears Griet's freshly hung laundry with her muddy hand - Griet slaps the brat, then goes to pack her things thinking she is about to be let go.Vermeer sees something in Griet that he doesn't see in his family or acquaintances. Griet has an artists eye, and an eagerness for learning, so Vermeer becomes both her master (as in employer) and her mentor.Complications arise as Vermeer's wife does not possess the artistic eye and is insanely jealous, and Vermeer's wealthy patron Van Ruijven pays the bills but doesn't hesitate to puts his eyes and hands on any woman he cares to.I found the work realistic, and the movie has a real orchestral score that compliments the film well.

It's not something I would have picked out for myself, but after watching it, and being simply transfixed throughout, I'm so glad I got it now. Even watching the trailer, it's that brilliant, that I didn't even realise it was Colin Firth, until my Dad said that he kept seeing Darcy. Duh!Scarlett Johansson is stunning in this, even though she's playing a very plain servant girl. She hasn't really done a role like this since Ghost World, she was plain in that. But even when she's wearing virtually no makeup, and her hair's scraped back, and under a cap thing, and that infamous cleavage of hers is covered up, she still exudes beauty from every pore. And not many girls can do that. She managed to speak so much with just her eyes and lips, and even when she went ages without speaking, she didn't need to really. She's never going to be Hollywood beautiful, but she's a gorgeous girl, and it's shown through in many of her films.Colin Firth plays a great role opposite Scarlett, there's even chemistry, which I didn't expect between them. There's barely any contact between them, but the sexual tension is just crackling away.I haven't read the book yet, but in so many other reviews, I've read that it's better than the film (obviously) and fills in a few gaps. Like the fact that despite there's no contact, the piercing of her ear is meant to be a metaphor that he took her virginity. Tom Wilkinson is really sleazy in this, which I did not expect, and every line is just dripping with innuendo.Although Vermeer and the painting both are real historic figures, the screenplay is based on Tracy Chevalier's novel and therefore largely fictional or hypothetical. Only 36 Vermeer paintings are known to exist today, and none of the models have ever been positively identified. A poster of the painting in her bedroom inspired Chevalier to write her own version of how it came to exist based on the framework of Vermeer's known history. Chevalier sold the film rights and opted not to have any involvement in the film or screenplay, although after its release said she was pleased with the results.This is definitely a film to see, and I'll definitely be watching it again. I disagree with another reviewer who said that it was too slow to be watched by anyone under 40 - I'm half that age, and I managed to sit through it, which I haven't been doing with too many films recently.

809503,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B0001KZNV0,Melissa Niksic,"[19, 30]","I HATE when this happens! You take a perfectly good story (in this case, Tracy Chevalier's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring""), and then the buffoons in Hollywood mess with it for no apparent reason and ruin what has the potential of being an excellent movie.The reason I gave the film two stars is because two major aspects of the movie are dead on: the casting and the setting. The cast of this movie is absolutely perfect, and the visual elements of the film are exactly what I pictured when I was reading the book. However, the screenplay is a disaster. There are many small omissions from the book that make the movie confusing for people who aren't familiar with the story.  The scene where Griet and Vermeer are supposed to meet in Griet's parents' kitchen is completely omitted from the film, as is a basic explanation of why Griet is forced to go to work as a maid in the first place. Many scenes in the film are out of order, which completely destroys the main ideas that Chevalier outlined in her book. Griet's relationship with Pieter is depicted very differently in the film than in the book, and many of the other character relationships are skewed as well. And although Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth are flawless in their performances, I winced during the scene where Vermeer pierces Griet's ear in the movie...IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY IN THE BOOK, and there's a REASON it doesn't happen that way! I think the entire film completely jeopardized the integrity of the original novel, and there was no reason for it.Perhaps the worst deviation from the novel occurs in the final minutes of the film: everything that happens from the moment Catharina discovers the painting of Griet is a complete fabrication. In the novel, Griet runs out of the house and is unsure of where she should go. Although she was never really sold on the idea of marrying the butcher's son, she realizes that he's her best chance for survival, and so she goes ahead with it. Ten years later, Tanneke visits Griet as she is working in the butcher shop and tells her that her mistress wishes to see her. Griet pays a visit to the Vermeer house for the first time in years. It has been several months since Vermeer has passed away, and Catharina informs Griet that her late husband has left her the pearl earrings in his will. Griet is obviously stunned, and she decides that she can't keep the earrings, so she sells them and gives the money to Pieter, telling him the Vermeers wanted to pay off their debt to the butcher shop. Now WHY did those Hollywood idiots rewrite the end of the movie so it didn't make any SENSE?! I'll never understand it.""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is perfectly cast and is visually stunning, but the screenplay really sucks. I don't understand why the director felt the need to rearrange scenes from the book and omit little details that would have made the film less confusing to the audience.

The story was interesting, however this film fell flat.  It was nonengaging and left the viewer with a lot to be desired.While the cast is excellent, each character seems emotionless and the viewer feels very disconnected.  A lot happens in the story, yet none of the characters seem to care.  Greit has a relationship with a butcher, but it is difficult to tell if she even likes him.  She is expressionless around him, and does not seem at all in love at any point in the film.  At first I had the impression she only wanted to avoid him.  This was changed when we see a breif smile when she is with him deep into the film.The rest of the relationships, as well, seem uninspired and flat.  Vermeer and Greit seemed to not care at all about each other.  There was no tension between them.  It felt empty.  The same was with all the characters, none of them seemed to care.  By the end, it felt as if nothing had happened between any of them.Another big disappointment was the way the characters handled issues.  A lot happens that people would normally not take lightly, but nothing that occurs in this film seems to affect the characters later in the movie.I found this movie, in short, completely unmoving and boring.

But if you want to be dazzled by color and light and costume and set design, you'll love this one. Johannes Vermeer was one of the masters of the great period of Dutch and Flemish painting, and probably his best-known work is a study of an unknown young girl in a head-wrap and a single pearl earring, looking back over her shoulder. It's been called the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" and it's the kind of painting you can sit in front of for hours. This film, and Tracy Chevalier's novel on which it was based, is a fictional exploration of the young model, a maid in Vermeer's house, who slowly, quietly falls in love with her master, helps him grind his pigments, tries to survive the jealousy of his misunderstanding wife, and becomes the sexual target of Vermeer's wealthy patron (who must be placated if the artist's family is to survive). Scarlett Johansson is not a great actress, but she's perfect for this part. She seems made to wear the linen cap and homespun dress. She doesn't have that many lines -- indeed, there's relatively little dialogue at all in this film -- but she communicates beautifully with expression and gesture and posture. (Colin Firth, who plays Vermeer, seldom acts at all, in any of his movies and miniseries; he just glowers.)

While fortunate, in the seventeenth century, to enjoy a relatively comfortable life selling his paintings to a lecherous patron, Vermeer seems imprisoned in his attic studio. And then along comes Griet (Scarlett Johansson) who, as a nubile maid, enters the Vermeer household and discovers talents for composition and color and thus attracts the eye of the genius painter Vermeer who may be bored with his beautiful but shallow and spoiled upper class wife. One is struck by how great Vermeer's talent was and yet how under appreciated he must have been if the film's making him so dependent on a single patron is historically accurate. Vermeer's ability to capture light and color is reflected in the scenes of the film which show us Dutch life at home or marketplace in the 1600's about as realistic as you can get without having actors squatting over chamber pots. With all the hard manual work (no washing machines), it makes the movie-goer glad we didn't live four centuries ago. While there isn't much plot to THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING and things move slowly in the film,  the visual beauty of the film lingers and touches the viewer, especially the beauty of Scarlett Johansson.

Although she cannot read or write, Griet's appreciation of color, light and composition stirs Vermeer from his isolation and brooding disposition, and Griet's face and daily chores become subjects of his paintings. As Griet and Vermeer's attraction to one another becomes obvious, his wife Catharina (Essie Davis) and mother-in-law (Judy Parfitt) develop strong but disparate opinions of Griet's place in the household.Little is known about the painter Johannes Vermeer, and nothing is known about the young woman who is the subject of his portrait ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". But the inscrutable expression on her face inspired author Tracy Chevalier to write a fictional account of how the painting came to be. ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is based on Chevalier's novel of the same name. It has been adapted for the screen by Olivia Hetreed and directed by Peter Webber. It's pure historical fiction.This is a beautiful, quiet film about love, jealousy, and life's realities. The story is small; it concerns the emotions of the people in one household. Not much actually ""happens"" in the concrete sense. The story's events and its arc are primarily emotional. There is relatively little dialogue, and Griet, being a domestic servant, speaks even less than the other characters. Scarlett Johansson is left to convey her feelings with facial expressions. Sometimes this works better than others. There are moments in this film where Johansson seems to be trying too hard. It's not terrible, but it could be better. On the other hand, when Griet speaks, Johansson is spot-on. The supporting performances are all exceptional. Essie Davis effectively evokes the audience's antipathy as Vermeer's insecure and demanding wife. Judy Parfitt steals every scene she is in as the imposing, pragmatic head of household. Tom Wilkinson is simultaneously aristocratic and sleazy as Vermeer's wealthy patron Van Ruijven. And Colin Firth reveals the passion, intelligence, and frustration that  seethes just below the fictional Vermeer's surface. Even as these performances are a pleasure to watch, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring""'s cinematography and production design are moreso. Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography within the closed spaces of the Vermeer household is simply the best of 2003. Ben van Os' production design, with art direction from Christina Schaffer, bathes this film in the subdued yet crisp colors of Vermeer's paintings and brings this household to life with details that seem so real that I wished I could touch them.""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a story of personal proportions.

From the folds of the dresses to the attitudes of the day, the film stays in character and does not add Hollywood gimmicks to modernize the tale. Servants are servile and illiterate, though not necessarily unintelligent. The titular teenage maid does not have an insolent attitude.Scarlett Johansson plays the young Griet, the daughter of a former tile painter who is sent across town to serve the Vermeer household. Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a painter, is drawn to Griet's quiet loveliness. Though few words pass between them, their mutual eye for aesthetics develops into strong attraction and deep appreciation. Her pure complexion also attracts Vermeer's vulgar patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) and the young butcher Pieter (Cillian Murphy).Each frame is a painting within itself, supported by a charming score (though some have called the music obnoxious). Though every scene is beautiful, Griet's position is not romanticized; her arduous labor is evident throughout the movie. Instead of altering the story to conform to a 95 minute film, sections of the story are simply deleted or unexplained. Particularly the character of Tanneke is underdeveloped, compared to the book character.The acting is dramatic yet understated. Expressions are affectively portrayed without losing subtlety. Johansson expressively displays the young, almost timid side of Griet. Colin Firth is an attractive Vermeer; he has natural and exciting reactions.

Performance from all parties were top-notch and through research, it's now been said that it's more probable that the girl with the pearl ear ring could be Vermeer's own daughter as he relished his time painting domestic scenes.  Still, credit still went to the author for having such a credible fictitious mind to suggest quite a domestic thriller that was captivating to watch as much as to learn about Vermeer's world in the 17th century.

Griet's understanding of art combined with her beauty draws Vermeer to her. Her beauty also attracts the butcher's son, Pieter (the beautiful Cillian Murphy). Vermeer's obsession with Griet becomes obvious to Catharina, (Essie Davis) his jealous and possessive wife and her scheming mother. Vermeer's lustful patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) agrees to continue his patronage if Vermeer will paint Griet. Therefore, Griet becomes the subject of one of Vermeer's most famous pieces.The acting is very good; each actor portrays his or her character just as they should be represented - separated by a strict class system. From a female perspective, it was entertaining to watch the sexual tension and the evolution of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. You long for them to end up together, but it would have been out of the question in such a society. The most notable component of this film is the lighting and cinematography. It is so delicate, so precise, and so atmospheric that it feels as if you are watching a painting in motion.

809527,A2QM44SYXT2PTO,B0001KZNV0,"""rfbsupg""","[12, 21]","I wanted to kill some time and decided to go to the nearest cinema... unfortunately, the movies I wanted to see had already begun and I've seen a beautiful poster of &quot;girl with a pearl earring&quot;... Then I recalled that this movie was one of the movies that could win some Oscars (I just didn't remember which ones), and I decided to see it.It's nice when you enter in a theater with an open mind. The first minutes of the movie are quite promising, and it really captures the environment of an old european time.Basically it makes us accompany the story of a young maid that goes to work in a house of a famous painter.It's quite interesting to see that this movie isn't full of cliches... I mean, the poor girl doesn't become a cinderella in the end (much on the contrary), she doesn't behave badly, her patrons treat her quite fairly (of course, sometimes a bit rudely, but she's just a servant!), she works hard, and she dates a butcher guy.The problem with this movie is that when you see that it's finished, you can't avoid the feeling that there's a lot of things missing here.Along the movie the girl begins to help the painter in his work.Before I proceed, I'm not complaining that she doesn't have some crush with him. Actually, that's other good point in the movie (and one less cliche). Even if he desired her, he wouldn't have anything serious with her, and would always rather his wife to her because of his social status.On the other hand, the movie lets the impression that there's something in the air between them. Moreover, the movie lets a lot of things in the air. However, none of them are ever explored further.The girl is quite always with the same impassive face. It's difficult to get engaged with her feelings, or feel anything about her end, and the end of other characters. This is the great problem of this movie, it is very cold, completely dispassionate, a lot unsatisfactory.We know that the girl doesn't have many friends and that she can't afford to be complaining along the movie. But there's not enough scenes, when we can see her making reflections about her life, or that we are able to see clearly her thoughts (since, her face doesn't say much)! She has a romance with a butcher boy, but except for a short passage when we see a brief smile at her face, we never know if she really feels anything for him!

Indeed, it's a feast for the eyes and ears. Music, costumes, sets and glorious widescreen photography capture so very much of the period. Hyped as about the life of Johannes Vermeer, it's really about Griet (a lovely Scarlett Johanssen) and her role as a servant in Vanmeer's household. In the hands of director Peter Webber, the visuals take precedence to an otherwise mundane story. The acting is impeccable. Scarlett is completely in touch, and excellent performances from Essie Davis (as the wife) and Judy Parfitt (as her mother) are complete and rife with issues. Colin Firth, as Vanmeer, is moody and broody; I was rather annoyed with his character for being such a wimp. Also, excellent support from Tom Wilkinson (snakey, evil charm) and Cillian Murphy (never looked better). The film is never boring, but the plot is simple, ad Griet's angst, charm and renewal are well handled. Still, it'll be hard to find a prettier film to watch.

But where Girl with a Pearl Earring is concerned, the Academy knew what they were doing; the folks behind the Golden Globes must have been blind, stupid drunk, and in some way distracted.The Academy nominated the film for all the fine things about it; Art Direction, Cinematography, and Costume Design, all places in which the movie excelled. Granted, when you have in front of you an adaptation of a book as visually conceived as Girl with a Pearl Earring, you've got a headstart on the rest of the pack. That said, Eduardo Serra (previously nominated for the Wings of the Dove, and who has also shown his talent on such brilliantly photographed films as Unbreakable, What Dreams May Come, and The Widow of St. Pierre) was the perfect choice to complement the script, and nailed the final pieces of the film's Oscarworthy bits into place.The Golden Globes, on the other hand, nominated the film for Best Score (Alexandre Desplat's music is so horribly derivative that at times I thought I was watching other movies) and Best Actress. For what, exactly? Scarlett Johansson is a fine actress, when she wants to be (Lost in Translation, The Man Who Wasn't There), but she has so very little to work with here that she seems wasted in the role.The film, which (purportedly) details Chevalier's flight of fantasy on the genesis of Vermeer's famous painting, commits the double-edged sin of both condensing the book to an excruciating level, and then changing what it's condensed; had they stopped with the gratuitous additions and kept closer to the source material, they might have had a decent film. As it is, it's something of a mess. I've read the book (made my top ten that year, in fact), and I was still lost in places. I shudder to think what happened to those unfamiliar with the source material, though perhaps the changes didn't jar quite as much.In the face of all the awful things about the movie, I should mention that Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom, The Patriot, etc.), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later...), and the wonderful Judy Parfitt (Ever After, Wilde, the upcoming Asylum, and many other criminally-neglected flicks) all turn in wonderful performances in relatively minor roles. They make the washed-out natures of both the roles of Johansson and Colin Firth (The Importance of Being Earnest, Valmont, and other unintentionally humorous period pieces) all the more pale.A very pretty film, to be sure. But I'm not sure whether those who've read the book first (so they have half an idea what's going on) or those who haven't (blissful in their ignorance) would be a better audience for this.

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[2, 2]","Using absolutely stunning imagery and sets with a artistically shot work, Girl With a Pearl Earring is a beautiful picture with a relatively thin story.  Recreating the Flemish 17th century to tell the story about an enigmatic yet less than revolutionary painting might seem like little to which a story could be built about especially in comparison to ""the Da Vinci Code"" but this movie establishes a pretty notable plot and delivers the audience a convincing feel once again proving that good movies can be built on minimal premise if done with an attention to detail and a sense of caring.  All that being said this movie could be viewed with the sound off and still be impressive.  The costumes are very authentic and not overly garish or even too clean like we often see in period piece film.  The sets used are too well done both in the adorned homes and the bawdy and ruff taverns.  But something more is working in this film: there is a plot as tightly woven as the alleys of a Flemish walled city with as many loves, lies and secrets that any one romance film can handle.The film painstakingly assures the viewers of the class differences between the servants including Griet, the girl with the pearl earring, the artist and his upper class clients.  This is historically accurate and well portrayed.  Though the script is relatively austere the pictures provide words unto themselves.  Using the copious Flemish and Dutch still life paintings as a guide to the style of the age it appears that the set designers may have laid the imagery on a little thick but never the less this is an art movie and a movie about art so the more allusion the better even if it is at the expense of realism.  I enjoyed the film and while the ending is less than a resolution to the plot it was effective.  Vermeer is one of those artists that, in spite of his enormous talent, seems to get less than his full share of regard in the pantheon of European masters.  I certainly think this film provides some needed recognition and is a very good period piece film.  I recommend this as a top rank romantic film and a decent art film all alike. For students of history and art history this film to provides a great background on an era though it must be remembered that this is historical fiction.

This movie killed any interest I could have had with this story. I haven't seen such stiff and unconvincing actors in a long time that brought absolutely nothing to their characters worth any interest. Honestly they all bored me to tears. I can't really blame the actors though entirely, but Scarlett especially was boring. Movies of this sort can be so rich and wonderful if only there are characters worth giving a damn about, which there aren't in this film. They're so dull and lifeless in my opinion. Where's the passion at all? There is none. They just stand around staring blankly at each other but you're supposed to just get everything they don't do and don't say. And poor Cillian Murphy is so limited in this film, and yet to me was still ironically the most interesting person in the film.What can I say? There is nothing I liked about this film. Sure the scenery is done well enough but the characters, the storyline itself- is not worth watching at all. So I say to pass this movie by.

Zwick,"[3, 6]","Behind every picture there lies a story, and the film ?Girl With a Pearl Earring? purports to give us the inside scoop into the making of Vermeer?s classic painting of the same name.  In the mid 1600?s, a young, illiterate peasant girl named Griet came to live and work as a servant in the home of the promising, yet still financially struggling, Dutch master.  Obsessed by her beauty, Vermeer insisted on using her as the subject for one of his works, much to the horror and chagrin of his jealous and shrewish wife.  Despite the domestic havoc it caused, the collaboration between artist and subject resulted in one of the genuine masterpieces of the art world.Visually, this film could not be more stunning.  Thanks to luminous cinematography, art direction and costume design, the audience watching this film feels almost as if it has been transported into a Vermeer work.  Director Peter Webber recreates every element of that world in loving detail, right down to his choice of actress Scarlett Johansson, who is a dead ringer for the model in the original portrait.  Alexandre Desplat?s score also captures the lyrical, haunting tenderness of the subject matter.?Girl With a Pearl Earring? is a very fine movie in many respects, but it is ultimately unsatisfying because it cannot match in content what it achieves in style.  Despite the exquisite look of the film, the characters seem strangely underdeveloped, most especially Vermeer himself, who remains frustratingly superficial throughout.  Thanks mainly to his taciturn moodiness, we never get to know much of what he is thinking or feeling.  The romantic moments between artist and subject are admirably restrained ? and thereby all the more erotic in nature ? but we do feel as if we would like to know more about him as a person.  Griet is only slightly more fully developed, although, in her case, we can at least ascribe this lack of information to the restrictions placed on her by her station in life and the society of her time.  Unlike Vermeer, Griet was conditioned by the world around her to be a passive observer.  But Vermeer needs to be a more dynamic presence in the story.One admires the fact that the filmmakers have remained truthful to the spirit of the enterprise, refusing to indulge in cheap melodramatics to make the story more salacious and scandalous than in truth it really was.  Yet, in dramatic terms, such integrity comes with a price, for the film often has the effect of lulling rather than stimulating us, of raising our expectations then failing to fully satisfy them.  Perhaps, in the case of this particular artwork, the story-behind-the-picture wasn?t really all that interesting to begin with.",3,visually stunning but lacking in dramatic intensity,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,2693,"['picture', 'story', 'film', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'purports', 'give', 'inside', 'scoop', 'making', 'Vermeer', 's', 'classic', 'painting', 'same', 'name', 'mid', '1600', 's', 'young', 'illiterate', 'peasant', 'girl', 'named', 'Griet', 'came', 'live', 'work', 'servant', 'home', 'promising', 'yet', 'still', 'financially', 'struggling', 'Dutch', 'master', 'Obsessed', 'beauty', 'Vermeer', 'insisted', 'using', 'subject', 'one', 'works', 'much', 'horror', 'chagrin', 'jealous', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'domestic', 'havoc', 'caused', 'collaboration', 'artist', 'subject', 'resulted', 'one', 'genuine', 'masterpieces', 'art', 'world.Visually', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'stunning', 'Thanks', 'luminous', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'costume', 'design', 'audience', 'watching', 'film', 'almost', 'been', 'transported', 'Vermeer', 'work', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'element', 'world', 'loving', 'detail', 'right', 'down', 'choice', 'actress', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'model', 'original', 'portrait', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 's', 'score', 'also', 'lyrical', 'haunting', 'tenderness', 'subject', 'matter', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'very', 'fine', 'movie', 'many', 'respects', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'content', 'what', 'style', 'exquisite', 'look', 'film', 'characters', 'seem', 'strangely', 'underdeveloped', 'most', 'especially', 'Vermeer', 'who', 'frustratingly', 'superficial', 'Thanks', 'mainly', 'taciturn', 'moodiness', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'what', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'romantic', 'moments', 'artist', 'subject', 'are', 'admirably', 'restrained', 'thereby', 'more', 'erotic', 'nature', 'do', 'feel', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'about', 'person', 'Griet', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'case', 'can', 'least', 'ascribe', 'lack', 'information', 'restrictions', 'placed', 'station', 'life', 'society', 'time', 'Vermeer', 'Griet', 'was', 'conditioned', 'world', 'be', 'passive', 'observer', 'Vermeer', 'be', 'more', 'dynamic', 'presence', 'story.One', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'remained', 'truthful', 'spirit', 'enterprise', 'refusing', 'indulge', 'cheap', 'melodramatics', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'salacious', 'scandalous', 'truth', 'really', 'was', 'dramatic', 'terms', 'such', 'integrity', 'price', 'film', 'often', 'effect', 'lulling', 'rather', 'stimulating', 'raising', 'expectations', 'then', 'failing', 'fully', 'satisfy', 'Perhaps', 'case', 'particular', 'artwork', 'story-behind-the-picture', 'wasn', 't', 'really', 'interesting', 'begin']",N/A

She finds herself in the home of the painter Vermeer and his family.  The setting is 17th century Holland, and the historically authentic sets and brilliant photography relentlessly drive home to the viewer the physical harshness of life in that time.  Even people of means must contend with cold and damp, filth, cramped living spaces, and a myriad other sources of physical discomfort.But the film also explores the emotional suffering of the time through its portrayal of Vermeer's family.  We see very little kindness in this family, and plenty of resentment, grief, rage, sadness, and downright meanness.  Griet comes from a family which is very poor but which seems to have real affection for her.  Settling in with her employers, she must learn to navigate the shoals of the bitterness which surround her.  Indeed, the Vermeer family seems to be representative of an age when the currency of power dominated human relationships in a much more obvious and raw fashion than we see today.  The world outside Griet's family is one of darkness; grasping, cruelty, and ignorance are accepted modes of behavior.But Griet does not become overwhelmed by this darkness.  Instead, she discovers the paintings of Vermeer.  Soon, her mind begins to open up to greater possibilities, and a new sort of consciousness seems to take hold in her.  As the movie progresses, she becomes caught up in the growth of her interior vision so much so that the destructive energies of the household cannot distract her from this growth.  In this way, she is an embodiment of the paintings themselves, which are very much about light appearing in the midst of darkness, and the power of illumination emerging from physical limitation.  The photography mirrors this theme, with shots that are lit in the same manner as Vermeer's paintings.  Thus the development of Griet's character, the photography, Vermeer's art, and the dynamics of the family conflict all weave together to create one overriding image:  light emerging from darkness.This movie moves slowly. We watch a young woman's enlightenment taking place against a backdrop of rising tension and hatred which are intensified by her presence.  But it is the quality of her spirit more than her physical beauty which causes much of the tension within the family.  Johansson convincingly portrays a woman who embodies a luminous, interior beauty-- and it is this that thoroughly captivates the artist Vermeer.  A beautiful and awe inspiring film.",5,Light emerging from darkness.,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,2572,"['movie', 'young', 'woman', 'Griet', 'forced', 'leave', 'home', 'find', 'employment', 'maid', 'home', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'setting', '17th', 'century', 'Holland', 'historically', 'authentic', 'sets', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'relentlessly', 'drive', 'home', 'viewer', 'physical', 'harshness', 'life', 'time', 'Even', 'people', 'means', 'must', 'contend', 'cold', 'damp', 'filth', 'cramped', 'living', 'spaces', 'myriad', 'other', 'sources', 'physical', 'discomfort.But', 'film', 'also', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'time', 'portrayal', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'kindness', 'family', 'plenty', 'resentment', 'grief', 'rage', 'sadness', 'downright', 'meanness', 'Griet', 'family', 'very', 'poor', 'have', 'real', 'affection', 'Settling', 'employers', 'must', 'learn', 'navigate', 'shoals', 'bitterness', 'surround', 'Indeed', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'be', 'representative', 'age', 'when', 'currency', 'power', 'dominated', 'human', 'relationships', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'raw', 'fashion', 'see', 'today', 'world', 'Griet', 'family', 'one', 'darkness', 'grasping', 'cruelty', 'ignorance', 'are', 'accepted', 'modes', 'behavior.But', 'Griet', 'not', 'become', 'overwhelmed', 'darkness', 'Instead', 'paintings', 'Vermeer', 'Soon', 'mind', 'open', 'up', 'greater', 'possibilities', 'new', 'sort', 'consciousness', 'take', 'hold', 'movie', 'caught', 'up', 'growth', 'interior', 'vision', 'so', 'much', 'destructive', 'energies', 'household', 'can', 'not', 'distract', 'growth', 'way', 'embodiment', 'paintings', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'light', 'appearing', 'midst', 'darkness', 'power', 'illumination', 'emerging', 'physical', 'limitation', 'photography', 'mirrors', 'theme', 'shots', 'are', 'lit', 'same', 'manner', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'Thus', 'development', 'Griet', 'character', 'photography', 'Vermeer', 'art', 'dynamics', 'family', 'conflict', 'weave', 'together', 'create', 'one', 'overriding', 'image', 'light', 'emerging', 'darkness.This', 'movie', 'moves', 'slowly', 'watch', 'young', 'woman', 'enlightenment', 'taking', 'place', 'backdrop', 'rising', 'tension', 'hatred', 'are', 'intensified', 'presence', 'quality', 'spirit', 'more', 'physical', 'beauty', 'much', 'tension', 'family', 'Johansson', 'convincingly', 'woman', 'who', 'luminous', 'interior', 'beauty', 'thoroughly', 'artist', 'Vermeer', 'beautiful', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'film']",N/A

And so, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" argues, it goes with artists - the arrangement of shade and texture is hard-wired into their senses; they understand, intrinsically, what series of brushstrokes, with which series of colors, need to be made to create a satin skirt that looks alive.When handmaiden Griet chops vegetables in 1665 Holland, she arranges the beats, onions and cabbage in order of color that adheres to a certain logic inside her brain. Later, when she's asked by famous Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) to name the colors in the clouds outside his studio window, Griet at first says white. Vermeer knows she sees more. Griet does too. She sees yellow. Then blue. Then gray. She knows what he knows.In a movie that does justice to Tracy Chevalier's quiet, powerful source novel, the tragedy is Griet, played mostly in silence by Scarlett Johannson, cannot do anything with what she knows but become Vermeer's muse, and eventually his subject in his best-known, titular painting. That in itself is dangerous:The women of the Vermeer house, wife Catharina (Essie Davis) and mother-in-law Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), are brittle and insecure; they need Vermeer to keep painting on terms they consistently want to change for a fickle, vicious patron in Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) who enjoys the women in Vermeer's paintings as much as he enjoys the paintings. ""You are a fly in (Van Ruijven's) web,"" Maria Thins says to Griet. ""Just like the rest of us."" Vermeer was a slow painter, needing nearly divine intervention to begin a work, and months of tinkering to complete one. Van Ruijven, thus, is a necessity.""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is a subtle work, anchored by Johannson, who radiates Griet's fierce intelligence and curiosity underneath the customary courtesies and nods of a maid. This is a shrewd, darkly comic girl discovering the complexities, and fruits, of aristocratic life, and preferring them a to night out with the butcher's son. Could an indentured maid enjoy a better life than the ""free"" wife of a meat merchant? If it involves an art studio, Griet seems to think, maybe.Eduardo Serra's distinct camerawork matches Vermeer's moody paintings - shades of dark and light, cramped interiors, a slight haze to any shot outdoors. When Griet and a young suitor walk the fields outside town, the sky is a bright, alive tan - something out of a Terrence Malick film. Director Peter Webber has to linger on Johannson's face a great deal in preparation for the painting, so you'd better like it. Johannson's lips, it should be noted, give Angelina Jolie's a run for their money.Griet does not mean trouble in the Vermeer household, but her sensuality makes her trouble, and the women of the house, out of boredom and pastime jealousy, badly want to make trouble. Vermeer, under the watch of Maria Thins, could never sleep with Griet. But he could make paints with her. And use his wife's earrings in a portrait. These deceits are more intimate than sex, and when Catharina begs her husband to paint her, his answer is more painful than adultery.The film has a weakness: Firth. The British comedy veteran is a stooped-over failure as Vermeer, his constipated, oatmeal expressions passing for mercury. When Vermeer is supposed to ignite a passion in Griet, we can only believe it because Johannson, in breathless hyperventilation, sells it so well. One ""intense"" moment, where Vermeer meets Griet on the street in a hat the size of a Honda, is unintentionally funny.And yet the final half-hour of ""Girl With Pearl Earring,"" most of it involving Firth, gains momentum.  Serra's camera becomes unmoored from its station and begins to bear down on its subjects with zooms and pans, the best of which frame Johannson as the painting will. It is a remarkable shot, and Johannson holds the pose. She does not much look like the girl in the painting, but she is the girl. So it goes, I'd argue, with acting.",4,A portrait of an artist never to be.

809536,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0001KZNV0,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","Girl With A Pearl Earring, based on Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, chronicles the creation of one of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's greatest paintings. Griet (the luminous Scarlett Johansson) becomes a maid at the Vermeer house after a family tragedy, and learns to adapt to the dynamics of the Vermeer household: a jealous, constantly-pregnant wife (Essie Davis, bearing a striking resemblance to Cate Blanchett's Queen Elizabeth), a shrewd mother-in-law in charge of finances and keeping Johannes' wandering in check, and a gaggle of children underfoot (one of whom hates Griet from day one and makes life miserable for her). While at the Vermeers, Griet meets Pieter, the butcher's assistant, and the two begin a slow courtship as the seasons pass.The film's main story follows Vermeer's struggle to paint (he only produced around 35 canvases his entire career) with little money for supplies and the household, an iron-fisted mother-in-law that disdains him and urges him to paint more and faster, and the frustration at being with people who do not understand his calling, the intricacies of colour, texture, light and shadow. Enter Griet, who possesses a sensitive, artistic nature and is assigned to clean Vermeer's studio. Before long she is secretly grinding and mixing paints for Vermeer in between her other household chores, and one fateful day Vermeer asks Griet to sit for him. She does so reluctantly, afraid to invoke the wrath of his wife, but Vermeer quietly forces her to bend to his will, including piercing her ears so that she can wear his wife's earrings for the painting. Griet is found out, and all hell breaks loose. The film's finest moment is when Griet poses for the infamous painting, a haunted look in her liquid eyes. ""You have looked inside me,"" she accuses Vermeer.There is a great deal of unrealized sexual tension between maid and master, the smallest movement an expression of unspoken desire: the accidental brush of a hand, a thumb's caress as an earring is put in, the furtive glimpse of Griet's hair that entrances Johannes. One of Vermeer's regular patrons lusts after Griet and attempts to rape her, leaving Vermeer angry but helpless to turn down the commission.This is a gorgeous film, lushly sensual and full of moments of quiet beauty. Each scene is composed as though a Vermeer painting, careful studies in placement, colour, and light.  Colin Firth plays a superbly tortured soul seeking his muse, and Scarlett Johansson is radiant as the timid, blossoming Griet, tantalized by that which she can never have.

809537,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0001KZNV0,Sarah Schenkkan,"[3, 4]","The year is 1665, and 17-year-old Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is forced out into the job market in Delft, Holland, after an accident at her father's pottery studio leaves him blind and unable to support the family. After little searching, she is employed as a common maid in the household of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a master painter. Although Vermeer posesses impeccable talent, his painstakingly slow process for his art strains on his family of ten children (soon to be eleven) and haughty wife Catharina (Essie Davis), who are dependent on his meager salary. Although they teeter on the edge of poverty, they continue to mantain their lavish lifestyle under the roof of Catharina's mother, Maria (Judy Parfitt). Griet is subsequently thrown into this caustic mix, and soon attracts the attention of the reclusive painter, who struggles to find a subject for his next work. Her notice of detail, color, shadow, and her ability to see beyond the paint and challenge him quickly makes her the object of Vermeer's inspiration and obsession. Vermeer's patron, Master van Ruijvin (Tom Wilkinson), who notices their relationship, proposes for Vermeer to paint a portrait of Griet, and with the green light from Maria, the two carry on under Catharina's nose in the secretive attic studio. Along with the attention from Vermeer and van Ruijven, Griet is also noticed by Pieter (Cillian Murphy), a butcher's son, and much drama ensues, culminating in one of the greatest, and most mysterious paintings ever created.In terms of acting, ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" certainly showcases Scarlett Johansson, one of today's most promising young stars, as the innocent and intelligent Griet. Painfully beautiful, her luminosity shines near through the film, and her lines, while few, are full of realistic feeling and emotion. Colin Firth does a fine job as the restrained Vermeer, and his brooding eyes, slighted speech, and slower movements truly capture the character. As a supporting cast, Tom Wilkinson is irresistably slimy, Essie Davis shines in her role as Vermeer's bitter wife, and Alakina Mann, who made her debut in 2001's ""The Others"" is amazing as Cornelia, Vermeer's oldest daughter, who tortures Griet.The thing that intrigues me about this film was the script. With nearly no dialogue, it shows how a look, movement, or sound can convey an entire mood or give the plot direction. Characters are succesfully developed, conflict is raised, and resolution is searched for, all with minimal words, which, in my opinion, is exactly the technique needed for this movie.Overall, this is truly one of the most beautiful films of the year, with not only the script, but in particular the sets cinematography. The dark, bustling streets of 17th century Holland are amazingly shot, and the camera captures light, movement, and use of shadow so perfectly, it almost rivals one of Vermeer's paintings. It transitions from spring to summer to the swirling snows of wintertime seamlessly, which does nothing but add to the splendor onscreen. The acting is superb, the cinematography jaw-dropping, and the script a lasting tribute to the mystery behind Vermeer's canvas.",4,"""Pearl Earring"" Is A Gem (4.5 OUT OF 5)",1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,3165,"['year', '1665', '17-year-old', 'Griet', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'forced', 'out', 'job', 'market', 'Delft', 'Holland', 'accident', 'father', 'pottery', 'studio', 'blind', 'unable', 'support', 'family', 'little', 'searching', 'employed', 'common', 'maid', 'household', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'master', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'impeccable', 'talent', 'painstakingly', 'slow', 'process', 'art', 'strains', 'family', 'ten', 'children', 'soon', 'be', 'eleven', 'haughty', 'wife', 'Catharina', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'who', 'are', 'dependent', 'meager', 'salary', 'teeter', 'edge', 'poverty', 'continue', 'mantain', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'roof', 'Catharina', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'Griet', 'subsequently', 'thrown', 'caustic', 'mix', 'soon', 'attention', 'reclusive', 'painter', 'who', 'find', 'subject', 'next', 'work', 'notice', 'detail', 'color', 'shadow', 'ability', 'see', 'paint', 'challenge', 'quickly', 'object', 'Vermeer', 'inspiration', 'obsession', 'Vermeer', 'patron', 'Master', 'van', 'Ruijvin', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'relationship', 'Vermeer', 'paint', 'portrait', 'Griet', 'green', 'light', 'Maria', 'two', 'carry', 'Catharina', 'nose', 'secretive', 'attic', 'studio', 'attention', 'Vermeer', 'van', 'Ruijven', 'Griet', 'also', 'noticed', 'Pieter', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'butcher', 'son', 'much', 'drama', 'ensues', 'culminating', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'mysterious', 'paintings', 'ever', 'created.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'certainly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'one', 'today', 'most', 'promising', 'young', 'stars', 'innocent', 'intelligent', 'Griet', 'Painfully', 'beautiful', 'luminosity', 'shines', 'film', 'lines', 'few', 'are', 'full', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fine', 'job', 'restrained', 'Vermeer', 'brooding', 'eyes', 'slighted', 'speech', 'slower', 'movements', 'truly', 'capture', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'irresistably', 'slimy', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'shines', 'role', 'Vermeer', 'bitter', 'wife', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'who', 'made', 'debut', '2001', 'Others', 'amazing', 'Cornelia', 'Vermeer', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'Griet.The', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'script', 'nearly', 'dialogue', 'how', 'look', 'movement', 'sound', 'can', 'convey', 'entire', 'mood', 'give', 'plot', 'direction', 'Characters', 'are', 'succesfully', 'developed', 'conflict', 'raised', 'resolution', 'searched', 'minimal', 'words', 'opinion', 'exactly', 'technique', 'needed', 'movie.Overall', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'year', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'particular', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'bustling', 'streets', '17th', 'century', 'Holland', 'are', 'amazingly', 'shot', 'camera', 'light', 'movement', 'use', 'shadow', 'so', 'perfectly', 'almost', 'one', 'Vermeer', 'paintings', 'spring', 'summer', 'swirling', 'snows', 'wintertime', 'seamlessly', 'nothing', 'add', 'splendor', 'onscreen', 'acting', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'jaw-dropping', 'script', 'lasting', 'tribute', 'mystery', 'Vermeer', 'canvas']",N/A

Her roles in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and in this movie gained two nominations for the Golden Globes, and even though she did not win any of them, everyone recognized her talent. It is particularly enlightening to the Johansson playing two roles that are complete opposites, a married young woman in the twentieth century in Japan and an introverted young maid in seventeenth century Holland.Griet (Johansson) is an adolescent that has a blind father and is forced to leave her home and go work for a wealthy family when the economic situation warrants it. The master of the house is no other than the painter Johannes Vermeer, who lives there with his wife, several kids, his mother in-law and a myriad of servants. The madam of the house and her eldest daughter receive Griet in an unfriendly manner, but she receives the &quot;gift&quot; of being in charge of cleaning Vermeer's atelier. She is mesmerized by the paintings and treats everything with immense respect and reverence.Vermeer takes his time with each painting, having to constantly fight with the pressure his wife and mother in-law put upon him when the funds become meager. Now he has received the news that his patron Peter van Ruijven will not pay for another painting right away, but will go with another painter instead. He then seeks to find a new source of inspiration and thus starts a peculiar relationship with Griet.This film has various admirable attributes, like the impeccable settings, the uplifting music and the fascinating details presented about the life in Holland in the seventeenth century.

After more than a century  of study, the work still poses significant questions. Who was the sitter and was the painting even intended as a portrait? Why had it  remained in complete obscurity until it was rediscovered in 1882 and sold for the mere pittance of a reproduction?  Did Vermeer sell this painting during his lifetime? Many questions surround this masterpiece.  Tracy Chevalier's novel is just one of the many historical tales that COULD HAVE happened to answer the unanswered.All of the characters are strong in this well made, period piece.  Collin Firth's most excellent portrayal of Vermeer, Scarlett Johansson as Griet, the Vermeer Family maid, Judy Parfitt as Vermeer's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, Essie Davis as Catharina, Vermeer's wife, and the disgustingly lurid, Van Ruijven is played aptly by Tom Wilkinson.I won't give you a blow by blow of the story as you should see it for yourself.  It is mainly about the unrequited lust and love between Griet and Vermeer, their eye for art, and the many similiarities that they share.The cinematography, music, &amp; lighting are TOP NOTCH and it's like watching a Vermeer painting come to life right on your TV screen.You don't need to be an art lover to love this movie.

In the role of Griet, a servant girl in the home of Johannes Vermeer(Colin Firth), Johannsson gives a delicately worked out interior performance that equals if not betters her work in LOST IN TRANSLATION.It's too bad that the movie can't keep up with her. Based on Tracy Chevalier's novel, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is an imagining of how the titular painting came to be. The Vermeer house is in an uproar, under constant pressure to please the artist's wealthy patron (Tom Wilkinson, hammy). Vermeer's large family seems almost entirely concerned with superficialities, while the artist, who Firth plays rather sullenly, toils away on commissions. Griet is the only one who understands the play of color and light that moves Vermeer, and Johansson beautifully gets the girl's sensual (and later sexual) awakening. Griet's character is much too obviously a modern imagining of what a 17th century house servant SHOULD have been like. By the end of the film, it seems that her nascent artistic impulses and sexuality have come to life, never mind the fact that she's poor, unemployed, and illiterate. . The ""journey"" Griet goes on gives the film what little dramatic shape it has -- there's much too little incident. Subplots -- Wilkinson's character's lecherous designs on Griet, Vermeer's daughter's jealousy of Griet -- are started and then forgotten about. Johansson handles everything with a beautiful light touch though, and certainly manages to be moving despite the narrowly conceived role.Despite Johansson's work and the gorgeous costumes and cinematography, I can't quite recommend this one.",2,art history lite,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,1702,"['Everything', 'important', 'GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'face', 'role', 'Griet', 'servant', 'girl', 'home', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Johannsson', 'delicately', 'worked', 'out', 'interior', 'performance', 'equals', 'not', 'work', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION.It', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Based', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'novel', 'GIRL', 'WITH', 'A', 'PEARL', 'EARRING', 'imagining', 'how', 'titular', 'painting', 'came', 'be', 'Vermeer', 'house', 'uproar', 'constant', 'pressure', 'please', 'artist', 'wealthy', 'patron', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'hammy', 'Vermeer', 'large', 'family', 'almost', 'entirely', 'concerned', 'superficialities', 'artist', 'who', 'Firth', 'rather', 'sullenly', 'away', 'commissions', 'Griet', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'play', 'color', 'light', 'Vermeer', 'Johansson', 'beautifully', 'girl', 'sensual', 'later', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'Griet', 'character', 'much', 'too', 'obviously', 'modern', 'imagining', 'what', '17th', 'century', 'house', 'servant', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'film', 'nascent', 'artistic', 'impulses', 'sexuality', 'have', 'come', 'life', 'never', 'mind', 'fact', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'illiterate', 'journey', 'Griet', 'film', 'what', 'little', 'dramatic', 'shape', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'incident', 'Subplots', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'lecherous', 'designs', 'Griet', 'Vermeer', 'daughter', 'jealousy', 'Griet', 'are', 'started', 'then', 'forgotten', 'about', 'Johansson', 'everything', 'beautiful', 'light', 'touch', 'certainly', 'be', 'moving', 'narrowly', 'conceived', 'role.Despite', 'Johansson', 'work', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

Girl With a Pearl Earring explores a theory of the biography of the largely unknown life of artist Johannes Vermeer, and his painting ""The Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" whose purpose still remains unknown. Scarlett Johansson plays young servant Griet who moves in with a very wealthy family consisting of the painter Vermeer, his wife, his children, and his mother-in-law. Vermeer spends all of his time in his private studio painting and does not let anyone in the house enter. Eventually as Griet works in the house Vermeer grows attracted to her and begins to paint her in his studio without the other mean-spirited owners of the house not knowing. The story progresses and is ultimately a very mysterious movie that uses a HELL of a lot of symbolism in every way, and every shot of the movie seems like an actual Vermeer painting.

809545,A31CXEZDNUT3OF,B0001KZNV0,The Busy Bee,"[1, 1]","I was pleasantly surprised that this period piece fictionalized the ""story behind a painting"" without the typical need for overt sexual involvement. What I mean by that, is that this book-to-film was more about the understanding between house-maid and artist, not a sexual realtionship...... which was a welcome difference in fictional period films about muses and their masters.It is a quietly developing film, neither tedious nor upbeat. The story of Vermeer stays financially and pictorially correct to history - down to the names, scenery, and the likeness of the characters depcited in his true paintings (which was refreshing). The drama of his financial need to stay afloat, while being supported by his mother inlaw, is historically accurate - as well as his patronige with one affluent buyer, keeping the truth of Vermeer's Dutch local fame true to life as well.The fictional involvement of Johansson's house-maid character is the meat of the film - but as I said before - I found a serene beauty in her being Vermeer's muse, without either infidelity or even many words being spoken between she and the master painter. It was a fascination on both parts more than a romance. She understood his art; Through his fascination with her she learned/understood light, space and movement, the mixing of pigments and had an appreciation for his art that Vermeer's wife could not compete with or comprehend - causing the main dramas.The film is subtlely endearing.... some may find it too slow, but I thought the many quiet moments and unspoken thoughts in this film added to artistic appreciation, instead of plot distraction and chaos.  The nasty characters inflict just enough threat to make both painter and maid pitiable in their plight. But overall, you are left with a serenity and sadness for how the painting of the Pearl Earring came about and captivated with the purity of Vermeer's art.",5,A fascination more than romance - Sadly & Quietly captivating,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,1899,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'period', 'piece', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'painting', 'typical', 'need', 'overt', 'sexual', 'involvement', 'What', 'mean', 'book-to-film', 'was', 'more', 'understanding', 'house-maid', 'artist', 'not', 'sexual', 'realtionship', 'was', 'welcome', 'difference', 'fictional', 'period', 'films', 'muses', 'masters.It', 'quietly', 'developing', 'film', 'tedious', 'upbeat', 'story', 'Vermeer', 'stays', 'financially', 'pictorially', 'correct', 'history', 'down', 'names', 'scenery', 'likeness', 'characters', 'depcited', 'true', 'paintings', 'was', 'refreshing', 'drama', 'financial', 'need', 'stay', 'afloat', 'being', 'supported', 'mother', 'inlaw', 'historically', 'accurate', 'as', 'well', 'patronige', 'one', 'affluent', 'buyer', 'keeping', 'truth', 'Vermeer', 'Dutch', 'local', 'fame', 'true', 'life', 'well.The', 'fictional', 'involvement', 'Johansson', 'house-maid', 'character', 'meat', 'film', 'said', 'found', 'serene', 'beauty', 'being', 'Vermeer', 'muse', 'infidelity', 'even', 'many', 'words', 'being', 'spoken', 'master', 'painter', 'was', 'fascination', 'parts', 'more', 'romance', 'understood', 'art', 'fascination', 'learned/understood', 'light', 'space', 'movement', 'mixing', 'pigments', 'had', 'appreciation', 'art', 'Vermeer', 'wife', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'comprehend', 'causing', 'main', 'dramas.The', 'film', 'subtlely', 'endearing', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'slow', 'thought', 'many', 'quiet', 'moments', 'unspoken', 'thoughts', 'film', 'added', 'artistic', 'appreciation', 'instead', 'plot', 'distraction', 'chaos', 'nasty', 'characters', 'inflict', 'just', 'enough', 'threat', 'make', 'painter', 'maid', 'pitiable', 'plight', 'overall', 'are', 'left', 'serenity', 'sadness', 'how', 'painting', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'came', 'about', 'captivated', 'purity', 'Vermeer', 'art']",N/A

809547,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B0001KZNV0,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","Wow. This 100-minute film, nominated for three Oscars and two Golden Globes in 2003, is one of the most exquisitely lensed art house movies I've ever seen. Every frame looks like a masterpiece come to life, full of vivid colors and extraordinary imagery. The music is also excellent, adding to the mystery of a painting (the titular &#34;Girl With a Pearl Earring&#34;) that has come to rival the Mona Lisa in its powerful mystique. Set in 1660s Holland, the film is based on an historical novel speculating about the origins of this work by Johannes Vermeer.Despite the racy-looking cover art, the movie is not a sexualized or romantic tale, and there are no intense or naughty scenes. Rather, very much in the style of Martin Scorcese's &#34;The Age of Innocence,&#34; one must infer the true emotions and thoughts of this film's characters from a series of masterfully staged interactions. Colin Firth, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy make up the excellent cast.The story is simple. In a Venice-style city of Holland, a girl from a financially strapped Protestant family goes to work as a maid for the household of Catholic painter Johannes Vermeer. The girl -- named Griet -- becomes the pawn in the ongoing business arrangements between Vermeer's patron and mother-in-law, who manages the household. Vermeer's insecure wife and vindictive daughter, a local butcher in love with Griet, and various other servants play a role in this Downtown Abbey-style household. After Vermeer discovers a soulmate in Griet, she begins mixing his paints for him and eventually poses for the titular painting of this film, to the consternation of Vermeer's artistically tone-deaf spouse. But the journey here is far more intriguing than the destination, as we slowly become immersed in the mysterious interactions of this carefully maintained family.As a film on the passions and creative process behind great works of art, this movie is one of my favorites alongside &#34;The Agony and the Ecstasy&#34; (1965) with Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison. Unlike that other film, this one tells its story more through visuals than through dialogue, inviting the viewer to see things through the eyes of an artist rather than through the lens of a historical biographer. It's a brilliant, moving, and historically rich (17th century Holland really feels like a real place here) human drama. Those who find great art boring may also find this film a bit dull and slow-moving, as it's definitely not the painter's equivalent of &#34;Amadeus,&#34; but those who appreciate the dynamics of human relationships and their impact on art will love it. I highly recommend it.

809548,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0001KZNV0,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 5]","Girl With a Pearl Earring is a genuine revelation, a quite remarkable film that pares down the narrative to concentrate on the unsaid, creating a remarkably sensual film in every sense of the word. That it looks beautiful should be and is a given, but more importantly it's a real piece of cinema. You really get a sense of the huge importance of art and the strong emotions it can unleash without resorting to speechifying or purple prose, just beautiful filmmaking that reveals a whole world with a subtle intensity: the wife's feeling of betrayal at the painting seems absolutely and horribly believable - it really is a far greater infidelity than if he had slept with her.

809549,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001KZNV0,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 13]","If you don't know much about painting, or Verneer for that matter, you don't have to worry.  'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not about the painting of the title itself; the film is rather a romance behind the (much fictional) account of the making of the painting, or the forbidden relation between a man and a girl.  As such, it is stunning, so are the actors, especially Scarlet Johanssen.The simple story begins with a girl Griet perfectly played by New-York-State born Johanssen.  Living in Holland, 1665 (around the time the painting is supposed to be made), Griet now has to work at the painter Verneer's house as maid, and as you may expect, the menial jobs only make the life there very drab.But the painter himself, rather strange, and laconic guy Verneer (Colin Firth, with long hair), is not a bad master.  By the time she understands that, she actually becomes the only person who in turn understands the importance of his work in the entire household of his.  And the painter, whose wife just don't understand, and who is surrounded by many (more than 10) kids, also finds a solace in her....The film could be more melodramatic, and some part almost become so (the theatrical portrait of Tom Wilkinson's greedy patron nearly did it), but thanks largely to the subtle lighting of photographer Eduardo Serra (known for Patrice Leconte films) and very credible production designs by Ben Van Oz (known for Peter Greenaway films), the film itself becomes a Vermeer painting itself.  The story, relying on less dialogues than other costume films, manages to be engaging and involving, with the superb acting from the two leads.But the greatest thing happens at the ending, which is inspired by the original painting.  How to end a film is one of the trickiest parts of the job, and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' ends with a very clever, and also beautiful way.  It still remains with me.Some may call the film predictable, but that is a minor thing.  As a costume drama this film is first-rate, but first and foremost it is a romance with a heart, the very universal theme.",5,"A Painter and a Girl, Inspiration and Romance;Just Beautiful",1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,2077,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'painting', 'Verneer', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'not', 'painting', 'title', 'film', 'rather', 'romance', 'much', 'fictional', 'account', 'making', 'painting', 'forbidden', 'relation', 'man', 'girl', 'such', 'stunning', 'so', 'are', 'actors', 'especially', 'Scarlet', 'Johanssen.The', 'simple', 'story', 'girl', 'Griet', 'perfectly', 'played', 'New-York-State', 'born', 'Johanssen', 'Living', 'Holland', '1665', 'time', 'painting', 'supposed', 'be', 'made', 'Griet', 'now', 'work', 'painter', 'Verneer', 'house', 'maid', 'may', 'expect', 'menial', 'jobs', 'only', 'make', 'life', 'there', 'very', 'drab.But', 'painter', 'rather', 'strange', 'laconic', 'guy', 'Verneer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'long', 'hair', 'not', 'bad', 'master', 'time', 'actually', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'turn', 'importance', 'work', 'entire', 'household', 'painter', 'wife', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'surrounded', 'many', 'more', '10', 'kids', 'also', 'solace', '.The', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'part', 'almost', 'become', 'so', 'theatrical', 'portrait', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'greedy', 'patron', 'nearly', 'did', 'thanks', 'largely', 'subtle', 'lighting', 'photographer', 'Eduardo', 'Serra', 'known', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'films', 'very', 'credible', 'production', 'designs', 'Ben', 'Van', 'Oz', 'known', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'films', 'film', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'story', 'relying', 'less', 'dialogues', 'other', 'costume', 'films', 'be', 'engaging', 'involving', 'superb', 'acting', 'two', 'leads.But', 'greatest', 'thing', 'ending', 'inspired', 'original', 'painting', 'How', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'trickiest', 'parts', 'job', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'ends', 'very', 'clever', 'also', 'beautiful', 'way', 'still', 'me.Some', 'may', 'call', 'film', 'predictable', 'minor', 'thing', 'costume', 'drama', 'film', 'first-rate', 'first', 'foremost', 'romance', 'heart', 'very', 'universal', 'theme']",N/A

Marshall,"[1, 2]","This film is cinematically stunning and makes an impact in subtle ways just as the book did, but offers a few alterations to the original novel.The story involves a young maid (Scarlett Johansson) who is employed to work for the family of painter Vermeer (Colin Firth) in Holland during the 17th century. Instilled within Griet, the young maid, is sensitivity to art which she received from her father who was once an artistic tile maker until blinded in an accident. Griet is sent to work for the Vermeer's because her family no longer has a breadwinner to support their expenses. She toils about in her new job unable to really fit in with the children of the family or the other maid. Her love of color and art draws the attention of the house master, Johannes Vermeer, and she is soon his unofficial assistant. Vermeer is entranced by Griet because in his own wife (Essie Davis) and mother in law (Judy Parfitt) he is seen as merely a commodity to maintain their aristocratic lifestyle. Vermeer struggles to matter and bonds with Griet. Needless to say the story becomes complex and ends with the power and beauty of a little pearl earring.Johansson is perfectly cast as the young woman depicted in Vermeer's famous painting, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" and the masterpiece is brought to life when she poses for the painting in this film. Colin Firth plays Vermeer in a troubled sense, restless and alone in his art while bowing to subjects in order to make a living for his ever growing family. Firth is both distant and intimate in his role with few lines but great intensity. The role of Vermeer's jealous wife, Catharina, is played with excellence by the luminous Essie Davis. Other mentions are Judy Parfitt who plays the controlling mother in law and Tom Wilkinson who portrays Master Van Ruijven with expert creepiness. The scenes are beautifully shot and bring the gray chill of Holland in 1664 to life with great effect all intermingled of course with Vermeer's fantastic art.My only complaint with this film is that the story does not follow the book in the end. It is not incomplete but will seem so if you read the novel first. Either way I feel it is well worth the viewing but don't forget to read the novel by Tracy Chevalier as well. Both formats explain the innocence of the era while weaving tremendous passion and beauty into a simple story filled with naive obsession and the power of a little pearl earring on a beautiful girl.",3,As Simple and Complex as a Pearl,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,2453,"['film', 'cinematically', 'stunning', 'impact', 'subtle', 'ways', 'just', 'book', 'did', 'few', 'alterations', 'original', 'novel.The', 'story', 'young', 'maid', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'employed', 'work', 'family', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Holland', '17th', 'century', 'Instilled', 'Griet', 'young', 'maid', 'sensitivity', 'art', 'received', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'artistic', 'tile', 'maker', 'blinded', 'accident', 'Griet', 'sent', 'work', 'Vermeer', 'family', 'no', 'longer', 'breadwinner', 'support', 'expenses', 'new', 'job', 'unable', 'really', 'fit', 'children', 'family', 'other', 'maid', 'love', 'color', 'art', 'draws', 'attention', 'house', 'master', 'Johannes', 'Vermeer', 'soon', 'unofficial', 'assistant', 'Vermeer', 'entranced', 'Griet', 'own', 'wife', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'law', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'seen', 'merely', 'commodity', 'maintain', 'aristocratic', 'lifestyle', 'Vermeer', 'matter', 'bonds', 'Griet', 'Needless', 'say', 'story', 'complex', 'power', 'beauty', 'little', 'pearl', 'earring.Johansson', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'young', 'woman', 'depicted', 'Vermeer', 'famous', 'painting', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'masterpiece', 'brought', 'life', 'when', 'painting', 'film', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Vermeer', 'troubled', 'sense', 'restless', 'alone', 'art', 'bowing', 'subjects', 'order', 'make', 'living', 'ever', 'growing', 'family', 'Firth', 'distant', 'intimate', 'role', 'few', 'lines', 'great', 'intensity', 'role', 'Vermeer', 'jealous', 'wife', 'Catharina', 'played', 'excellence', 'luminous', 'Essie', 'Davis', 'Other', 'mentions', 'are', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'who', 'controlling', 'mother', 'law', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'portrays', 'Master', 'Van', 'Ruijven', 'expert', 'creepiness', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'bring', 'gray', 'chill', 'Holland', '1664', 'life', 'great', 'effect', 'intermingled', 'course', 'Vermeer', 'fantastic', 'art.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'follow', 'book', 'end', 'not', 'incomplete', 'will', 'seem', 'so', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'way', 'feel', 'well', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'read', 'novel', 'Tracy', 'Chevalier', 'as', 'well', 'formats', 'explain', 'innocence', 'era', 'weaving', 'tremendous', 'passion', 'beauty', 'simple', 'story', 'filled', 'naive', 'obsession', 'power', 'little', 'pearl', 'earring', 'beautiful', 'girl']",N/A

Red,"[4, 5]","Contrary to some, I don't think that Scarlett Johansson does such a brilliant job in this lovely film about the genesis of Vermeer's painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring."" Rather, I think the camera is infatuated with her, which is appropriate considering that the theme of this film is the deep connection between art and eros.This carefully constructed film shows that art is transgressive, even that it is a kind of rape, as the scene in which Vermeer pierces young Griet's earlobe clearly reveals. The billowing white garments on their clotheslines, the carefully pressed white cap which must be put aside for the artful headpiece in the painting, the washtubs and soap scrubbing scenes -- all of these contribute to the theme, most baldly revealed when Vermeer's patron Pieter Van Ruijven violently approaches Griet by the clotheslines. ""Unplucked still?"" he asks. All that's left to expose is the proverbial blood on the sheets.If Vermeer truly has, as Griet accuses him, ""looked inside"" her to paint his picture, his wife, played brilliantly by Essie Davis, is right to feel betrayed. Mother and son-in-law play pimp to the quasi-pornographic, voyeuristic needs of the patron. The film explores this nexus of interests slowly, carefully, with a single-minded focus that itself amounts to a kind of rape. A very dark film about the intimate link between sex and art.

It excels in creating a strong mood, but lack interesting story that it fell rather slow most of the time. If it weren't for the participation of Scarlett Johansson(Griet, the muse/servant) and the mysterious and sexy Colin Firth(Johannes Vermerr, the painter), then this film would lack the heart to capture the audiences attension. It's not a very entertaining movie, and it's not emotionally impacting like Frida and Pollock.Vermeer is a struggling artist who paints portraits for wealthy clients including Van Ruijven(Tom Wilkinson in a low-key villian character). He's a often silent and submissive man under the control of his emotionally unstable wife(Maria/Judy Parfitt), and his overly eccentric mother. Griet is his maid, and she eventually became his inspiration for his most famous painting simply known as Girl With A Pearl Earring, and it was commisioned by Ruijven, because he desired Griet to the point of almost raping her. Griet secretly had a crush on Vermeer, and the painting of her portrait ultimately caused the wife to have a nervous breakdown, because she was so insecure.The story pretty much revolved around the events that took place before, during and after the completion of the famous portrait. I found the reaction of Maria was so hideous when she lost herself emotionally and verbally just because her husband didn't paint her portrait. She behave like a child trying to get a toy or something. Tom Wilkinson is good as usual, even though his role is kind of nasty. The most memorable scene was when Vermeer pierced Griet's unpierced ear. Scarlett was mesmerizing when she shed a few drops of tears before giving ""The Look"" to the artist.

809553,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0001KZNV0,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[0, 0]","That's the big thing I respond to in this movie: Griet locked in a loneliness she can't even name, a visual senstivity that no one around her can share. You see that loneliness first in that opening scene, where she arranges the colors of beets, cabbage, and onion into a composition that only she can see. When her family falls into unfortunate times, she must leave to make her own way in the world. There, just a few minutes in, we see her standing in a compass rose and symbolically choosing her new direction.That new direction leads her to Vermeer, and to a realization that she is not alone. She can converse with him - not always through talking - about light, color, and composition. And he responds. It's a chaste but intense kind of intimacy. Vermeer's wife is jealous, as if Griet is taking her place in some way. The jealousy is well founded but Griet's relationship to Vermeer is one that his wife can never fill, something that can only add bitterness to the jealousy. Partly though the spiteful viciousness of a daughter in the household, Griet is cast out. In the closing scene, she stands in the middle of the compass rose again, uncertain for a moment, then off in the direction of the next stage of her life.The movie is beautifully filmed, even if Scarlett Johansson is not shown as an outwardly beautiful woman. If anything, she is shown as somewhat lumpish, as if to emphasize that her beauty is inward. And, despite her generally passive and obedient role, Griet does take charge of what she can. At one point, she realizes that her virginity will probably be taken by force. She is powerless against forcible attack, but discharges her virginity in the manner of her own choosing. Maybe she couldn't lose it to love, but should could save it from violence by giving it in affection. And no, she didn't give it to Vermeer. That relationship already had an intensity of a different order.If you want absolute historical veracity, you won't find it here. According to ""Vermeer's Camera,"" for example, the camera obscura was probably a whole closet rather than the box shown in this movie. So let it be fiction in a historical setting - it's a beautiful movie, and a depiction of a very real kind of loneliness.
