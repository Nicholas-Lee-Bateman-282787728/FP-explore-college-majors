By voicing an orgasm, Natasha Richardson sexually arouses all who watch this movie. And she does this fully dressed!  What a lesson in eroticism. [Jane Fonda could do that...in ""Klute""]Natasha Richardson fans know her from other films such as ""Haven"" and ""The Handmaids Tale.""  Her co-star, Bob Hoskins, is also fantastic.  He offers a humble, understated performance as a photographer of cheap religious images.The scenes of his bungling efforts to photograph the great stories of the New Testament - whether of the LAST SUPPER or ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI - are hysterically funny.  The apostles, most of whom are drug addicts or skid row bums, are depicted as models of devotion.  One factor that makes the movie so funny is that Jeff Goldblum's character takes his role of playing Jesus so seriously,  he slowly comes to believe that he is the Son of God. Astonishing - with a beard and long hair, he really does look like Jesus!Because the movie does not hold back from poking fun at religion devotion,  it is likely to offend a crowd of fundamentalists.  Notwithstanding, the film examines the ""big questions"" more deeply than let's say, the better known ""Life of Brian."" I actually think it is funnier too.This is a unique film, for the reasons stated.  I recommend it to cinephiles looking for an offbeat satire outside the mainstream of Hollywood fare.  Consider the funniest line when Jeff Goldblum dressed in a white robe starts to walk slowly into a lake and sinks.  A skid row drunk wakes up his neighbor - ""I just saw someone trying to walk on water.""  The other responds:  ""It happens. Go back to sleep.""",5,To Add one more Good Review to the others....,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1743,"['Most', 'positives', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'other', 'reviews', 'one', 'aspect', 'movie', 'likely', 'be', 'hushed', 'up', 'voicing', 'orgasm', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'sexually', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'fully', 'dressed', 'What', 'lesson', 'eroticism', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'could', 'do', 'Klute', ']', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'fans', 'know', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Haven', 'Handmaids', 'Tale', 'co-star', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'also', 'fantastic', 'humble', 'understated', 'performance', 'photographer', 'cheap', 'religious', 'images.The', 'scenes', 'bungling', 'efforts', 'photograph', 'great', 'stories', 'New', 'Testament', 'LAST', 'SUPPER', 'ST.', 'FRANCIS', 'OF', 'ASSISI', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'apostles', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'drug', 'addicts', 'skid', 'row', 'bums', 'are', 'depicted', 'models', 'devotion', 'One', 'factor', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'character', 'role', 'playing', 'Jesus', 'so', 'seriously', 'slowly', 'believe', 'Son', 'God', 'Astonishing', 'beard', 'long', 'hair', 'really', 'look', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'poking', 'fun', 'religion', 'devotion', 'likely', 'offend', 'crowd', 'fundamentalists', 'Notwithstanding', 'film', 'big', 'questions', 'more', 'deeply', 'let', 'say', 'better', 'known', 'Life', 'Brian', 'actually', 'think', 'funnier', 'too.This', 'unique', 'film', 'reasons', 'stated', 'recommend', 'cinephiles', 'looking', 'offbeat', 'satire', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Consider', 'funniest', 'line', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'dressed', 'white', 'robe', 'walk', 'slowly', 'lake', 'sinks', 'skid', 'row', 'drunk', 'up', 'neighbor', 'just', 'saw', 'someone', 'trying', 'walk', 'water', 'other', 'responds', 'Go', 'back', 'sleep']","The Favor, the Watch, and the Very Big Fish VHS"

She only had a cameo role and didn't say one word, but I got a big laugh out of her performance anyway. It was Jeff Goldblum's best role and Hoskins was very funny because he played his role STRAIGHT at all times. This is a movie {Ebert gave it 3 stars] that has a lot of subtle sight gags that are big belly laughs when they sink in and you get them.There is one scene where a bunch of old French ladies force Jeff Goldblum[a Jesus look alike] to try to ""cure"" a blind boy. The boy does see again - but how it comes about is comic inventiveness at its best.I would definitely watch this movie again because even its stupid moments are forgiveable for the BIG BELLY LAUGHS that are gotten from viewing this offbeat comedy.",4,This movie was deliciously funny.,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,781,"['bought', 'movie', 'am', 'fan', 'Yvonne', 'Constant', 'only', 'had', 'cameo', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'word', 'got', 'big', 'laugh', 'performance', 'anyway', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'best', 'role', 'Hoskins', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'played', 'role', 'STRAIGHT', 'times', 'movie', 'Ebert', 'gave', '3', 'stars', ']', 'lot', 'subtle', 'sight', 'gags', 'are', 'big', 'belly', 'when', 'sink', 'get', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'bunch', 'old', 'French', 'ladies', 'force', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Jesus', 'look', 'alike', ']', 'try', 'cure', 'blind', 'boy', 'boy', 'see', 'again', 'how', 'about', 'comic', 'inventiveness', 'best.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'even', 'stupid', 'moments', 'are', 'forgiveable', 'BIG', 'BELLY', 'LAUGHS', 'are', 'gotten', 'viewing', 'offbeat', 'comedy']","The Favor, the Watch, and the Very Big Fish VHS"

Louie works for a religious articles curator making photographic art of great Christian figures like St. Francis and John the Baptist.  He finds someone who resembles our perception of what those figures should have looked like, puts them in costume with appropriate props, and takes their picture. Voila! Only problem is he hasn't been able to find a suitable Jesus and he is close to losing his job unless he can find a model for Christ.His friend, Zalman, who is going to sit for one of Louie's pictures is a voice over man and has just landed a voice over contract with a new studio.  But he's sick and can't make it to the voiceover.  He doesn't want to make a bad impression and never get called back so he convinces Louie to go in his place and pretend to be him. That is how Louie meets Sybil and spends the afternoon with her. Did I mention that the voice over was for a porno flick?Sybil has problems.  First of all, her sick grandfather needs medication she can't afford.  Then she tells how she had fallen in love with a pianist at a resataurant in which she worked and, through a series of comical errors, he was imprisoned over his passion for her.  He was getting out the next day and she would like to have a new dress to meet him in.  Louie, smitten, gives her the money for both only to return later to find the dress returned.Thinking he has been ripped off when he was so hopeful of a romance with Sybil and threatened again to find a suitable Jesus or lose his job, Louie is thrilled when a downtrodden Jeff Goldblum appears outside the window hungry, tired and wet from rain. The resemblance is wonderful and Goldblum becomes an overnight sensation with his pictures on buses and keychains and the whole works.These three paths crisscross and intersect in the most ingenious ways as Sybil tries to find Louie (thinking his name is Zalman), Louie tries to find Sybil and Goldblum becomes convinced that he IS Jesus but is torn between his new found identity and his desire for revenge on the woman who sent him to prison.While there is nothing patently offensive, there are adult situations.",5,Very original plot - Very Funny Movie,1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,2217,"['So', 'much', 'film', 'almost', 'somber', 'air', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'Louie', 'religious', 'articles', 'curator', 'making', 'photographic', 'art', 'great', 'Christian', 'figures', 'St.', 'Francis', 'John', 'Baptist', 'someone', 'who', 'perception', 'what', 'figures', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'costume', 'appropriate', 'props', 'picture', 'Voila', 'Only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'suitable', 'Jesus', 'close', 'losing', 'job', 'can', 'find', 'model', 'Christ.His', 'friend', 'Zalman', 'who', 'going', 'sit', 'one', 'Louie', 'pictures', 'voice', 'man', 'just', 'landed', 'voice', 'contract', 'new', 'studio', 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'voiceover', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'bad', 'impression', 'never', 'get', 'called', 'back', 'so', 'Louie', 'go', 'place', 'pretend', 'be', 'how', 'Louie', 'meets', 'Sybil', 'afternoon', 'Did', 'mention', 'voice', 'was', 'porno', 'flick', 'Sybil', 'problems', 'First', 'all', 'sick', 'grandfather', 'needs', 'medication', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'Then', 'how', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'pianist', 'resataurant', 'worked', 'series', 'comical', 'errors', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'passion', 'was', 'getting', 'next', 'day', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'new', 'dress', 'meet', 'Louie', 'smitten', 'money', 'only', 'return', 'later', 'find', 'dress', 'returned.Thinking', 'been', 'ripped', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'so', 'hopeful', 'romance', 'Sybil', 'threatened', 'again', 'find', 'suitable', 'Jesus', 'lose', 'job', 'Louie', 'thrilled', 'when', 'downtrodden', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'window', 'hungry', 'tired', 'wet', 'rain', 'resemblance', 'wonderful', 'Goldblum', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'pictures', 'buses', 'keychains', 'whole', 'works.These', 'three', 'paths', 'crisscross', 'intersect', 'most', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'Sybil', 'find', 'Louie', 'thinking', 'name', 'Zalman', 'Louie', 'find', 'Sybil', 'Goldblum', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'Jesus', 'torn', 'new', 'found', 'identity', 'desire', 'revenge', 'woman', 'who', 'sent', 'prison.While', 'nothing', 'patently', 'offensive', 'are', 'adult', 'situations']","The Favor, the Watch, and the Very Big Fish VHS"

I would call it a sleeper. I went to see it at a theatre which specialized in screening arthouse and foreign movies.Jeff Goldblum can either be sympathetic or very irritating as an actor, and in this film he shines. He portrays a man down in the dumps after losing his girlfriend through a comedy of errors, and is picked up by an artist looking for a likeness of Christ. Goldblum becomes very successful at modelling for paintings of Christ, so much so that he develops a Christ-fixation, believing he is the reincarnation of Jesus.Natasha Richardson plays his old girlfriend, who meanwhile has got a job doing voice-overs for Italian porn flicks. There she meets Bob Hoskins as the male voice-over. He is trying to get out of the rut he is in looking after his weird mother, who has this bizzare habit of mincing swordfish.Hoskins and Goldbum meet by chance, unaware that the other is pursuing Natasha Richardson.
