I think what he would say about Americans to the British would be far more entertaining.Still, he is soooo funny.I only wish he did less phallic and penis jokes, and stuck more to sex-neutral themes.  For example, his take on nursery rhymes is hilarious.  Sex is so overdone, cheap, lowest common denominator, and repetitive.  It takes real wit to shed light on seemingly harmless stuff like children's songs.",5,Would've preferred Ricky's England shows,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,499,"['Somehow', 'got', 'feeling', 'Ricky', 'was', 'toning', 'show', 'down', 'American', 'audience', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'Americans', 'British', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining.Still', 'soooo', 'funny.I', 'only', 'wish', 'did', 'less', 'phallic', 'penis', 'jokes', 'stuck', 'more', 'sex-neutral', 'themes', 'example', 'take', 'rhymes', 'hilarious', 'Sex', 'so', 'overdone', 'cheap', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'repetitive', 'real', 'wit', 'shed', 'light', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'stuff', 'children', 'songs']",Ricky Gervais Out of England: The Stand-up Special

But no show would be and Extras was in fact quite funny on its own terms. So he did seem a bit infallible. But while he's been a big success doing stand-up (which is still highly regarded in the UK), his first special feels a bit forced. So, funny at moments (especially that goofy cover costume) but not SO funny that we will all feel inferior forever.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 8]","I'm a big fan of ""The Office"" - the original created by Gervais, not the US version - and have enjoyed the interviews added to those DVDs. I missed this show on HBO last year and caught up with it on the DVD.While not a ""stand up"" comic per se, Gervais is more of a ""story teller"" and some of those on this DVD are pieces I'll remember for a while. Others are somewhat offensive - though that's what Gervais is trying to make fun of. They can just be a bit uncomfortable. Also, most  lower-level stand-up comedians I've seen have to resort to ""male member"" jokes to try to get a laugh. They usually fail, except for young kids who are hearing these for the first time. Gervais hits his low points when he resorts to a riff on the size of his, shall I refer to it as, ""male member"". (Note that he uses cruder language in the show.)The show is not very long (70 minutes) and there is a 10-minute ""Interview"" as a bonus - though half of that 10 minutes is devoted to replaying scenes you've already seen in the concert.I'm hoping he'll go back to writing comedy shows like ""The Office"" and ""Extras"".
