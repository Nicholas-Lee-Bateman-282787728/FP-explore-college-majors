Taking Malcolm all the way to the bank - literally - Letty's blackmail and bitchery eventually leads to her predictable ruin...Marion Burns gamely plays Grant's rather passive and uninteresting wife (she was much more enjoyable in Monogram's ""Sensation Hunters"" which is available via Alpha Video); BORN TO BE BAD is mainly notable for the pairing of Grant and Young, thirteen years before their most celebrated co-starring vehicle, ""The Bishop's Wife"".Co-starring Jackie Kelk and Henry Travers, BORN TO BE BAD will interest Cary Grant completists and Pre-Code fans; the performance of Loretta Young should make it a worthwhile title for casual viewers as well.

778370,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B0000DD77S,J. Michael Click,"[40, 45]","Movie: **  DVD Quality: **  DVD Extras: ****I've seen enough of Loretta Young's and Cary Grant's early work to know that this movie surely represents some kind of nadir for both stars.  Despite their considerable skills, no one could possibly turn this sow's ear of a script into anything resembling a decent film.  Loretta plays a 22-year-old never- married mother of a 7-year-old son; the kid is being raised to be just as morally compromised as Mom.  Enter Cary as a victim of one of their scams; before you can say, ""What the hey?!!!?"", Cary and his wife are raising Loretta's son ... Loretta's moving in on Cary to get her boy back ... Cary's wife is all-forgiving of her husband's dalliance ... Loretta does the ""noble"" thing by walking away and abandoning her son to Cary and wife's care.  This all takes a scant 61 minutes that drags on f-o-r-e-v-e-r because no one does anything but talk, talk, and talk ... oh! they also slam doors - lots of doors - in Cary's lavish mansion.  It couldn't have been fun for the actors to make this rubbage, but at least they must have known enough to stay away from the finished film!Certainly whoever wrote the insert notes for this Fox Home Video release never watched the movie!  They identify Cary's character as a ""dairy farmer"" (he's actually the very wealthy head of a dairy corporation); they name aged 50-something character player Henry Travers (Clarence the Angel in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") as the actor playing Loretta's 7-year-old son; and they describe the film as a ""heartwarming, well-made classic"" as well as a ""gripping classic"" (maybe they had this confused with Cary and Loretta's later film, ""The Bishop's Wife"", which really is a classic).I doubt that whoever was in charged of transferring the film to video paid much attention to the movie, either.  The picture is grainy throughout with some noticeable jumps (indicating bad splices); and the sound is frequently muddy as well. At least Fox doesn't claim it was restored.  There is a nice selection of trailers from other movies Grant starred in at Fox, including ""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949), ""People Will Talk"" (1951), ""Monkey Business"" (1952), ""Kiss Them For Me"" (1957), and ""An Affair to Remember"" (1957) ... but the trailer to this film isn't among them.  There's also a small photo gallery.Overall, I can't in good conscience recommend this DVD to anyone except the most diehard Young and Grant fans.  But if for some reason you insist on watching it, check out the jurors in the trial scene ... doesn't the man on the front row to the right of your screen bear a resemblance to the producer of the film, Darryl F. Zanuck?",2,Too Boring to Be Bad,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2650,"['Movie', '**', 'DVD', 'Quality', '**', 'DVD', 'Extras', '****I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'early', 'work', 'know', 'movie', 'surely', 'kind', 'nadir', 'stars', 'considerable', 'skills', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'turn', 'sow', 'ear', 'script', 'anything', 'resembling', 'decent', 'film', 'Loretta', '22-year-old', 'never-', 'married', 'mother', '7-year-old', 'son', 'kid', 'being', 'raised', 'be', 'just', 'morally', 'compromised', 'Mom', 'Enter', 'Cary', 'victim', 'one', 'scams', 'can', 'say', 'What', 'hey', 'Cary', 'wife', 'are', 'raising', 'Loretta', 'son', 'Loretta', 'moving', 'Cary', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'Cary', 'wife', 'all-forgiving', 'husband', 'dalliance', 'Loretta', 'noble', 'thing', 'walking', 'away', 'abandoning', 'son', 'Cary', 'wife', 'care', 'scant', '61', 'minutes', 'drags', 'f-o-r-e-v-e-r', 'one', 'anything', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'oh', 'also', 'slam', 'doors', 'lots', 'doors', 'Cary', 'lavish', 'mansion', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'actors', 'make', 'rubbage', 'least', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'enough', 'stay', 'away', 'finished', 'film', 'Certainly', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'insert', 'notes', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Video', 'release', 'never', 'watched', 'movie', 'identify', 'Cary', 'character', 'dairy', 'farmer', 'actually', 'very', 'wealthy', 'head', 'dairy', 'corporation', 'name', 'aged', '50-something', 'character', 'player', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Clarence', 'Angel', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'actor', 'playing', 'Loretta', '7-year-old', 'son', 'describe', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'well-made', 'classic', 'as', 'well', 'gripping', 'classic', 'maybe', 'had', 'confused', 'Cary', 'Loretta', 'later', 'film', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'really', 'classic', '.I', 'doubt', 'whoever', 'was', 'charged', 'transferring', 'film', 'video', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'movie', 'either', 'picture', 'grainy', 'noticeable', 'jumps', 'indicating', 'bad', 'splices', 'sound', 'frequently', 'muddy', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'claim', 'was', 'restored', 'nice', 'selection', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'Grant', 'starred', 'Fox', 'including', 'Was', 'Male', 'War', 'Bride', '1949', 'People', 'Will', 'Talk', '1951', 'Monkey', 'Business', '1952', 'Kiss', 'Them', 'Me', '1957', 'Affair', 'Remember', '1957', 'trailer', 'film', ""n't"", 'also', 'small', 'photo', 'gallery.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'most', 'diehard', 'Young', 'Grant', 'fans', 'reason', 'insist', 'watching', 'check', 'out', 'jurors', 'trial', 'scene', ""n't"", 'man', 'front', 'row', 'right', 'screen', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'producer', 'film', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck']",Born To Be Bad

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Born To Be Bad is a very good pre-Code film even though it had to be somewhat reworked at the last minute because the new Hayes Code was becoming the law of the land. The plot moves along well; I wasn't bored for a minute and the snappy one-liners, especially by Loretta Young, Jackie Kelk and Cary Grant make the picture even better! The cinematography and choreography work well and the quality of the print, which I watched on television, was actually rather good! There's also some suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat.When the film starts, we meet Letty Strong (Loretta Young), a promiscuous woman who gets paid to spend romantic time with men. Letty became pregnant and unmarried at the age of fifteen and it was only through the kindness and generosity of a stranger--now a friend, named ""Fuzzy"" (Henry Travers), that she and her son Mickey (Jackie Kelk) were able to survive. Although Letty looks happy when she's an escort, in reality she is angry with the world and she teaches her young son Mickey to lie, cheat, steal, skip school , literally fight for what he wants and more so that he won't grow up to be taken advantage of the way she was.One day Mickey is injured when a truck driven by the president of Amalgamated Dairies (Malcolm Trevor, played by Cary Grant) hits Mickey. Although Mickey's injuries are really not serious, Letty and her crooked lawyer Adolph (Harry Green) concoct a plan to get as much money as they can out of Malcolm so Letty and Mickey never have to worry about money again--and Letty can stop being a paid ""romantic"" escort for men. Yet the court trial doesn't go as planned--Letty loses her son to the court and social workers. When Malcolm intervenes to take Mickey in and raise him as his own along with Malcolm's wife Alyce (Marion Burns), Letty sees an opportunity to steal Malcolm away from Alyce and live a life of incredible luxury.Of course, there's more to the plot; I won't write much more to avoid giving out spoilers. Suffice it to say that the plot remains intriguing.I highly recommend Born To Be Bad for fans of the actors in it; people who enjoy films from the pre-Code era will want to get this film as well.

778373,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B0000DD77S,Nix Pix,"[22, 26]","&quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; is a very uncharacteristic Cary Grant movie. Uncharacteristic because it's at the beginning of his career, features him in an almost non-comedic role and has him cast as a man double-crossed by a woman of easy virtue in an almost maudelin plot. The story concerns Grant hitting the son of a woman of easy virtue (Loretta Young) with his car. He then having to make the mends. The rest is pure melodrama but pulled off with such panache that you'd scarcely mind any of the hockum. Truly, this is a very, very good movie.TRANSFER: Unfortunately the same can't be said for FOX's transfer. We get a very dirty, very gritty, very grainy transfer that - although free of digital anomalies - is so heavily damanged by age that seeing the film is hardly worth the effort. Black and contrast levels are extremely weak, fine detail is lost in practically every scene and the ravages of time are glaring and obvious throughout. The audio hasn't been cleaned up either for a slight hiss and some unexpected pops along the way.EXTRAS: Trailers from the other Grant films. Boring, unworthy and disappointing.BOTTOM LINE: Someone should point out to studio executives that films pre-Star Wars are worth the time, effort and, oh yes, the MONEY that is required to make them sparkle like they did when they were premiered.
