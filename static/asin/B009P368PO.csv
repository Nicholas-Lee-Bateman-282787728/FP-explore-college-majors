1601118,A9ZVPES37RJVH,B009P368PO,Karl,"[0, 0]",The beginning of the film didn't do justice to the latter part of the story. It could have started out with more involvement in the relationships. On the suggestion of psychic phenomena was really what helped the story to the end. The cast could have been less deliberate of the activity since psychic phenomena seems to just happen unexpectedly with no real explanation why?,3,Strange Movie,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,375,"['beginning', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'latter', 'part', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'started', 'out', 'more', 'involvement', 'relationships', 'suggestion', 'psychic', 'phenomena', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'helped', 'story', 'end', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'deliberate', 'activity', 'psychic', 'phenomena', 'just', 'happen', 'unexpectedly', 'real', 'explanation', 'why']",Awaken

1601120,AM4XOWSH9IESE,B009P368PO,sara,"[0, 0]",It's a story that illustrates what it feels like when you have deep connection with someone that isn't logical or linear. The fact that it isn't what is typically considered a happy ending doesn't diminish the emotional impact. Most relationships in real life don't make perfect sense but they still impact us so the story felt real in that way. The production felt a little overly clean but the acting pulled it together- lesser actors would have ruined it. Happy I got to see it.,5,Touching,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,481,"['story', 'what', 'when', 'have', 'deep', 'connection', 'someone', ""n't"", 'logical', 'linear', 'fact', ""n't"", 'what', 'typically', 'considered', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Most', 'relationships', 'real', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'still', 'impact', 'story', 'felt', 'real', 'way', 'production', 'felt', 'little', 'overly', 'clean', 'acting', 'pulled', 'together-', 'lesser', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'Happy', 'got', 'see']",Awaken
