1616533,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00ARX2VZW,C. Sawin,"[5, 13]","In Europe at the end of the 18th century, religious oppressors dominate the land. However change is in the air and those radical enough to think differently are suddenly being heard; it's the age of Enlightenment. A young English queen named Caroline (Alicia Vikander) is to be wed to King Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Folsgaard) of Denmark, but the Danish censorship laws crack down on the queen as soon as she arrives. Christian's childish behavior, his persistent use of alcohol, and particular liking of promiscuous women results in Caroline being absolutely miserable.After Caroline gives birth to Christian's son, Christian goes on a tour of Germany and is thought to have lost his mind. The Court orders him to find a personal physician which he finds in Dr. Johann Friedrich Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen). Christian becomes extremely fond of Johann, which results in Christian being completely blind to the love affair that blossoms between his best friend and his wife. Johann and Caroline start a revolution while being the brains behind the King, but their ideas soon become a thorn in the side of the Court and extreme actions must be utilized.It's fascinating how the beginning and even a brief section in the middle of ""A Royal Affair"" wraps around and connects to the ending of the film. Jumping around in time isn't exactly groundbreaking in the land of cinema, but it's satisfying to see it done well even with so much going on in between each segment. The historical drama begins in England in 1766, proceeds to Altona in 1768, jumps to Copenhagen in 1769, glosses over events that occur in 1773, and ends in Denmark in 1783. ""A Royal Affair"" mostly focuses on the transition of Caroline moving from England to Denmark while most of the film is stationed in Denmark with a few detours to Copenhagen for Johann along the way.The performances of ""A Royal Affair"" are fairly robust. The weakest is perhaps Alicia Vikander who is rather bland until she portrays sorrow and then she is absolutely crippling. Mikkel Folsgaard does an incredible job handling Christian's eccentricity. Christian is extremely childish, mentally unstable, and really only has the desire to play and have fun at all times. He has a particular flair for showmanship and hates having somebody else steal his thunder. His violent episodes are his most memorable scenes. Mads Mikkelsen is who you really want to keep your eye on though. His character Johann seems to be the voice of reason that tries to accomplish a little too much for his own good. The method in which Mikkelsen is able to fluctuate so many of his emotions results in this absolutely riveting performance from the Danish actor.Johann is seen as a bad influence because he only seems to encourage Christian's destructive nature, but it's his vast ideas that could one day lead to people finally being free that results in him being viewed as such a dangerous individual. His frowned upon and once thought to be absurd ideas are reevaluated once he successfully gives the King's son a smallpox inoculation. Other than falling in love and having all of the slip and slide action any man could possibly ask for with the wife of the King he just befriended, all that's left for Johann to do is use Christian as a puppet to get his ideas across to the Court which he does.The cinematography isn't overly extravagant, but there are several shots in the film that will remain burned in your mind because of how they were shot. The close-up shot of the pen being dipped in ink at the start of the film, the lavish greenery of the Danish countryside, that amazing shot of Johann sitting in that throne like chair deluged with his own emotions and the scene where Johann and Caroline go horseback riding. It's the way they take shelter under that ominous tree once it starts raining and time seems to stand still as Caroline tells Johann that the rain reminds her of England that makes it so memorable.What's so frustrating about ""A Royal Affair"" is its final act. The lying that's involved, the backstabbing that's used to get to the top, and the elaborate hoax that's concocted only makes the whole situation worse. The way it's written is entirely believable as surely this sort of thing had to have happened at some point in history (and is more than likely reoccurring in some capacity), but it's just infuriating to see people that stubborn, pig-headed, and close-minded get what they desire. Nobody ever counts on the maid snorting the sheets.There's some crazy foreshadowing occurring in ""A Royal Affair,"" but no one seems to want to listen to its warnings. The performances are powerful and the set pieces are exquisite, but the conclusion will leave you feeling enormously agitated thanks to what seems like the encouragement of thickheadedness.",3,A royal pain,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,4794,"['Europe', 'end', '18th', 'century', 'religious', 'oppressors', 'dominate', 'land', 'However', 'change', 'air', 'radical', 'enough', 'think', 'differently', 'are', 'suddenly', 'being', 'heard', 'age', 'Enlightenment', 'A', 'young', 'English', 'queen', 'named', 'Caroline', 'Alicia', 'Vikander', 'be', 'wed', 'King', 'Christian', 'VII', 'Mikkel', 'Boe', 'Folsgaard', 'Denmark', 'Danish', 'censorship', 'laws', 'crack', 'down', 'queen', 'as', 'soon', 'Christian', 'childish', 'behavior', 'persistent', 'use', 'alcohol', 'particular', 'liking', 'promiscuous', 'women', 'results', 'Caroline', 'being', 'absolutely', 'miserable.After', 'Caroline', 'birth', 'Christian', 'son', 'Christian', 'tour', 'Germany', 'thought', 'have', 'lost', 'mind', 'Court', 'orders', 'find', 'personal', 'physician', 'Dr.', 'Johann', 'Friedrich', 'Struensee', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Christian', 'extremely', 'fond', 'Johann', 'results', 'Christian', 'being', 'completely', 'love', 'affair', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'Johann', 'Caroline', 'start', 'revolution', 'being', 'brains', 'King', 'ideas', 'soon', 'become', 'thorn', 'side', 'Court', 'extreme', 'actions', 'must', 'be', 'utilized.It', 'fascinating', 'how', 'beginning', 'even', 'brief', 'section', 'middle', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'wraps', 'connects', 'ending', 'film', 'Jumping', 'time', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'groundbreaking', 'land', 'cinema', 'satisfying', 'see', 'done', 'well', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'segment', 'historical', 'drama', 'England', '1766', 'proceeds', 'Altona', '1768', 'Copenhagen', '1769', 'events', 'occur', '1773', 'Denmark', '1783', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'mostly', 'transition', 'Caroline', 'moving', 'England', 'Denmark', 'most', 'film', 'stationed', 'Denmark', 'few', 'detours', 'Copenhagen', 'Johann', 'way.The', 'performances', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'are', 'fairly', 'robust', 'weakest', 'perhaps', 'Alicia', 'Vikander', 'who', 'rather', 'bland', 'sorrow', 'then', 'absolutely', 'crippling', 'Mikkel', 'Folsgaard', 'incredible', 'job', 'handling', 'Christian', 'eccentricity', 'Christian', 'extremely', 'childish', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'really', 'only', 'desire', 'play', 'have', 'fun', 'times', 'particular', 'flair', 'showmanship', 'having', 'somebody', 'else', 'steal', 'thunder', 'violent', 'episodes', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'keep', 'eye', 'character', 'Johann', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'accomplish', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'own', 'good', 'method', 'Mikkelsen', 'able', 'fluctuate', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'results', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Danish', 'actor.Johann', 'seen', 'bad', 'influence', 'only', 'encourage', 'Christian', 'destructive', 'nature', 'vast', 'ideas', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'lead', 'people', 'finally', 'being', 'free', 'results', 'being', 'viewed', 'such', 'dangerous', 'individual', 'frowned', 'upon', 'once', 'thought', 'be', 'absurd', 'ideas', 'are', 'reevaluated', 'once', 'successfully', 'King', 'son', 'smallpox', 'inoculation', 'Other', 'falling', 'love', 'having', 'slip', 'slide', 'action', 'man', 'could', 'possibly', 'ask', 'wife', 'King', 'just', 'befriended', 'left', 'Johann', 'do', 'use', 'Christian', 'puppet', 'get', 'ideas', 'Court', 'cinematography', ""n't"", 'overly', 'extravagant', 'are', 'several', 'shots', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'burned', 'mind', 'how', 'were', 'shot', 'close-up', 'shot', 'pen', 'being', 'dipped', 'ink', 'start', 'film', 'lavish', 'greenery', 'Danish', 'countryside', 'amazing', 'shot', 'Johann', 'sitting', 'throne', 'chair', 'deluged', 'own', 'emotions', 'scene', 'where', 'Johann', 'Caroline', 'go', 'horseback', 'riding', 'way', 'take', 'shelter', 'ominous', 'tree', 'raining', 'time', 'stand', 'still', 'Caroline', 'Johann', 'rain', 'England', 'memorable.What', 'so', 'frustrating', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'final', 'act', 'lying', 'involved', 'backstabbing', 'used', 'get', 'top', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'concocted', 'only', 'whole', 'situation', 'worse', 'way', 'written', 'entirely', 'believable', 'surely', 'sort', 'thing', 'had', 'have', 'happened', 'point', 'history', 'more', 'likely', 'reoccurring', 'capacity', 'just', 'infuriating', 'see', 'people', 'stubborn', 'pig-headed', 'close-minded', 'get', 'what', 'desire', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'maid', 'snorting', 'sheets.There', 'crazy', 'foreshadowing', 'occurring', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'one', 'want', 'listen', 'warnings', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'exquisite', 'conclusion', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'enormously', 'agitated', 'thanks', 'what', 'encouragement', 'thickheadedness']",N/A

There's a slight problem with her new husband: he is mentally ill. The king hires free-thinking German doctor Johann Friedrich Struensee as his personal physician. You know what's coming next -- the queen falls in love with Struensee, who gradually takes over more and more control and is soon running Denmark. He introduces a series of laws to make the peasants' lives easier, thereby angering the Royal Court, who plot their revenge. The film is beautifully shot and features some good performances, but at 2 hours and 17 minutes is half an hour too long. We have one too many scenes of the king's advisers over-ruling him; the other challenge is that Struensee never really comes to life. We don't know what drives him and -- crucially -- we don't see how his many changes improve the life of average citizens, who remain largely off screen. Mads Mikkelsen is to my mind rather wooden as Struensee and this rather detracts from the film.",3,"Overlong, somewhat clunky Danish historical drama",1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,1196,"['15-year-English', 'girl', 'royal', 'descent', 'married', '1766', 'cousin', 'Denmark', 'country', 'still', 'stuck', 'many', 'ways', 'mediaeval', 'era', 'nation', 'repressive', 'system', 'government', 'where', 'peasants', 'have', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'treated', 'animals', 'slight', 'problem', 'new', 'husband', 'mentally', 'ill', 'king', 'free-thinking', 'German', 'doctor', 'Johann', 'Friedrich', 'Struensee', 'personal', 'physician', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'queen', 'love', 'Struensee', 'who', 'gradually', 'more', 'more', 'control', 'soon', 'running', 'Denmark', 'series', 'laws', 'make', 'peasants', 'lives', 'easier', 'thereby', 'angering', 'Royal', 'Court', 'who', 'plot', 'revenge', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'good', 'performances', '2', 'hours', '17', 'minutes', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'king', 'advisers', 'over-ruling', 'other', 'challenge', 'Struensee', 'never', 'really', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'crucially', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'many', 'changes', 'improve', 'life', 'average', 'citizens', 'who', 'remain', 'largely', 'screen', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'mind', 'rather', 'wooden', 'Struensee', 'rather', 'film']",N/A

Virtually everyone in the Danish court treats the king as if he were suffering from some form of mental illness, but whether they really believe he is mentally ill or whether this is merely a convenience that allows them to ignore his political will and exert their own, is never altogether clear. Whatever it is that the king lacks, however, is filled perfectly by the German doctor who seems to be the only person who has ever made any attempt to get to know him. The two get along wonderfully. With Streunsee as a companion and tutor, Christian becomes far more sociable and far more confident in his own opinions and thus far more effective as a king. This friendship is by far the most interesting and moving relationship in the film. So when the doctor begins an affair with the King's beautiful wife, Mathilde (who remains only a partially developed character here), we are intrigued but this relationship, the royal affair, remains relatively secret to all but a few while Struensee and Christian together transform Denmark into an Enlightened country (or at least come very near to doing so). However, since this is the 1760's, the Danish nobility feels threatened by Struensee's authority/power which they righfully perceive to be undermining their own authority/power, so they decide to retaliate to save themselves and the country (or at least their version of it) before its too late. ""The Royal Affair"" is just the scandal they need to turn the people (and perhaps Christian himself) against the ""dangerous foreigner"" Struensee. Its an excellent and true story but it is based on two separate sources (one that focuses on the doctor's story and the other that focuses on the queen's) and the film never completely resolves its twin interests and this results is some narrative confusion: The film is framed as the queen's story (beginning and ending with the writing and delivery of her memoirs to her children) but the bulk of the film is dedicated to the doctor's story (and we are much more invested in his story than we are in hers by films end as he is the more remarkable character played by the more remarkable actor). Viewers will likely forgive the film this minor flaw as its such a sumptuous and intriguing Enlightenment ride. And I suspect the thing that will linger in the viewer's mind days after the film is over is not the affair (which was fairly generic) but the relationship between the lonely king and his remarkable friend.Must-See Danish Cinema:Carl Dreyer, Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Vampyr (1932)Lars Von Trier, Breaking the Waves (1997), Melancholia (2012)Thomas Vinterberg, The Celebration (1998)Susanne Bier, In a Better World (2010) *Best Foreign Language Film Oscar Winner",4,Narrative Confusion Only Partially Resolved,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,3098,"['ROYAL', 'AFFAIR', 'first', 'looks', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'marriage', 'Caroline', 'Mathilde', 'Danish', 'King', 'Christian', 'VII', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'so', 'much', 'friendship', 'Danish', 'king', 'small', 'town', 'German', 'physician', 'Johann', 'Streunsee', 'who', 'Christian', 'meets', 'European', 'tour', 'Virtually', 'everyone', 'Danish', 'court', 'king', 'were', 'suffering', 'form', 'mental', 'illness', 'really', 'believe', 'mentally', 'ill', 'merely', 'convenience', 'ignore', 'political', 'will', 'exert', 'own', 'never', 'altogether', 'clear', 'Whatever', 'king', 'lacks', 'however', 'filled', 'perfectly', 'German', 'doctor', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'made', 'attempt', 'get', 'know', 'two', 'get', 'wonderfully', 'Streunsee', 'companion', 'tutor', 'Christian', 'far', 'more', 'sociable', 'far', 'more', 'confident', 'own', 'opinions', 'thus', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'king', 'friendship', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'moving', 'relationship', 'film', 'So', 'when', 'doctor', 'affair', 'King', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Mathilde', 'who', 'only', 'partially', 'developed', 'character', 'here', 'are', 'intrigued', 'relationship', 'royal', 'affair', 'relatively', 'secret', 'few', 'Struensee', 'Christian', 'together', 'transform', 'Denmark', 'Enlightened', 'country', 'least', 'come', 'very', 'doing', 'so', 'However', '1760', 'Danish', 'nobility', 'feels', 'threatened', 'Struensee', 'authority/power', 'righfully', 'perceive', 'be', 'undermining', 'own', 'authority/power', 'decide', 'retaliate', 'save', 'country', 'least', 'version', 'too', 'late', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'just', 'scandal', 'need', 'turn', 'people', 'perhaps', 'Christian', 'dangerous', 'foreigner', 'Struensee', 'excellent', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'two', 'separate', 'sources', 'one', 'doctor', 'story', 'other', 'queen', 'film', 'never', 'completely', 'twin', 'interests', 'results', 'narrative', 'confusion', 'film', 'framed', 'queen', 'story', 'beginning', 'ending', 'writing', 'delivery', 'memoirs', 'children', 'bulk', 'film', 'dedicated', 'doctor', 'story', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'invested', 'story', 'are', 'hers', 'films', 'end', 'more', 'remarkable', 'character', 'played', 'more', 'remarkable', 'actor', 'Viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'forgive', 'film', 'minor', 'flaw', 'such', 'sumptuous', 'intriguing', 'Enlightenment', 'ride', 'suspect', 'thing', 'will', 'linger', 'viewer', 'mind', 'days', 'film', 'over', 'not', 'affair', 'was', 'fairly', 'generic', 'relationship', 'lonely', 'king', 'remarkable', 'friend.Must-See', 'Danish', 'Cinema', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', '1928', 'Vampyr', '1932', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'Breaking', 'Waves', '1997', 'Melancholia', '2012', 'Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'Celebration', '1998', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'Better', 'World', '2010', '*Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'Winner']",N/A

1616553,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00ARX2VZW,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","The Danes have done it again! A ROYAL AFFAIR (En kongelig affre)  is  a brilliantly  executed and performed step back into history  that succeeds on every level.  Based on historical fact and the  Bodil Steensen-Leth novel `Prinsesse af blodet' as adapted for the screen by Rasmus Heisterberg and writer/director Nikolaj Arcel, it blossoms from the opening touching moments to the grand and gory closure.The story can be summarized as follows: In 1767, the British Princess Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) is betrothed to the strange and deranged King Christian VII of Denmark (Mikkel Boe Flsgaard), but her life with the near bipolar monarch in the dank and dark kingdom becomes oppressive: Caroline is disliked by the dowager queen Juliane (Trine Dyrholm) and her confidant Ove Hegh-Guldberg (David Dencik) who both would prefer Christian be de-throned, and Caroline must submit to the somewhat distracted and loony acting king on her first night in the palace - but the king's interest soon lags for want of prostitutes and frivolous parties. However, Christian soon gains a fast companion with the German Dr. Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelson), a quietly idealistic man of the Enlightenment. As the only one who can influence the King, Struensee is able to begin sweeping enlightened reforms of Denmark through Christian even as Caroline falls for the doctor. However, their secret affair proves a tragic mistake that their conservative enemies use to their advantage in a conflict that threatens to claim more than just the lovers as their victims.The cast is extraordinarily fine, not only the three main characters (Mikkel Boe Flsgaard finds just the right delicate balance for Christian's moments of sanity and flights of lunacy) but all members of the court and the masses of people living in the last country to move into the age of equality of all peoples.  The story is beautifully photographed by Rasmus Videbk, the stunning costumes are by Manon Rasmussen and the important musical score is in the capable hands of Gabriel Yared and Cyrille Aufort. Though the film is lengthy it is so rich in history and passion that it moves very quickly.  Highly recommended, especially for lovers of historical drama.

1616558,A167K0YA96FD56,B00ARX2VZW,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[0, 1]","This Danish film tells a harrowing tale of political machination, sexual intrigue and revolutionary zeal that accompanied one of the country's most tempestuous periods: the era of the mad King Christian VII where everything is possible. The main players in this comic opera made for history are a king in the advanced stages of syphillis, a Prussian court doctor who likes reading Voltaire and had an eye for the queen, and the royal courtiers who feel aggrieved that their power is being eroded by an outsider preying on the affections of their king. It is the eighteenth century and the age of reason is only just starting to break through into the tyrannically-run courts of Denmark: the nation still allows, serfdom, favours authoritarian rule, and taxes the life out of the common folk. Change is the air, however, and it is about to come about by a crazy monarch and his idealistic doctor forming the most improbable alliance to shake a nation out of its stupor. But as the film shows, this would never have happened unless the good Dr. Struensee had not formed a liaison with Queen Caroline who was a prominent advocate for reform in her own right. The relationship blossoms into a love affair that leads to the doctor strangely gaining the confidence of the crazy kings and taking over the running of the nation's affairs. With the age of enlightenment finally arrived in Copenhagen, one can be sure that traditional forces will push back big time. Revolutions are just like that. What starts out as an ideal, morphs into an idea, only to become a chain of uncontrollable events usually resulting in unintended consequences and tragic outcomes. This film very masterfully covers this history by representing the often strange and violent course of history a nation has to take to come of age. While there is plenty of political and personal romance packed into this story, political tyranny, fear, and corruption are equally compelling opponents in the fight for the hearts and minds of the people. If revolutions have any value, it is the process of change that they start that is often completed long after the turbulence is over.

If this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, then you know where this story is headed.The young Queen quickly finds out that she has married a bit of a whack-job, but endears herself to Denmark by quickly providing a royal heir.Her loony King Christian then announces that he is leaving for an extended tour of Europe, to which she replies the Danish equivalent of ""So? What do I care?"". Oh, did I forget to mention that this film is in Danish with English subtitles? They would actually have been speaking German in the Danish Court of the time, but it's a Danish film so let's not quibble about that.Christian brings back a certain German Dr. Johann Struensee with him from his Grand Tour, who as well as befriending and acting as a calming influence on the young King, brings some radical notions to Denmark like smallpox vaccination, freedom for serfs and the abolition of torture. He is able to use the King's power to drag Denmark into the ""modern era"" of The Enlightenment. This film takes place around the time of the American and French Revolutions to give some context.Dr. Struensee finds a kindred spirit for his progressive ideas in the young Queen and, well, let's just say that the history books seem to agree that her second child, a daughter, was fathered by the good doctor!If you enjoy a gorgeous, slow political romance then this is your film.

1616582,A19TPA1AJFOH11,B00ARX2VZW,Michael Buratovich,"[1, 1]","This is a beautiful movie that is masterfully directed and wonderfully and convincingly acted.  The view feels a genuine sympathy for the English Queen Caroline who is whisked off to Denmark to marry King Christian who is, at the very least, extremely eccentric and might even be mentally disturbed.  At the beginning of the movie the viewer develops a strong dislike for King Christian, but once you see how he is treated and patronized by his council, you begin to develop more than a little sympathy for him as well.  Caroline, being so very young herself, fails to understand the young king and his debauched and weird ways and the two become estranged.Alicia Vikander plays the part of Queen Caroline extremely well.  Her starstruck princess act gives way to her disgust for her new husband while still playing the part of a dedicated mother.  Vikander resists the temptation to overact many of these scenes and gives them a grace and nuance all their own.  Mikkel Flsgaard is especially good as the mercurial,eccentric, and highly changeable King Christian IV.  His fickle moods are convincing and quite well done.  His character is also well developed in the story.Later, the king is given a court companion, a German physician Dr. Johan Freidrich Struensee, who is also an intellectual child of the Enlightenment.  His friendship with Christian changes him for the better, and with the help of Struensee, and Queen Caroline, with whom Struensee has an unfortunately love affair, Christian brings modern reforms to Denmark.  The star-struck lovers and reformers are doomed, however, by the nobility whom they have royally ticked off.  Their affair is discovered,and Caroline is exiled and Struensee is executed.Danish film icon Mads Mikkelsen does a remarkable job playing Struensee.  He embodies the intellectual passion of the 18th century reformer and the carnal passion for the Queen that eventually dooms him.  Mikkelsen gives an outstanding performance that, in many ways, makes the story.I must also give kudos to director Nikolaj Arcel who expertly constructed each scene with enough attention to detail to make this a period piece that really drew the audience into the times and the narrative of the story without cluttering it to the point of confusion and weariness.This is one of the finest foreign films I have ever seen and it is well worth your time and money.",5,Beautiful movie in every way,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2383,"['beautiful', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'wonderfully', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'view', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'English', 'Queen', 'Caroline', 'who', 'whisked', 'Denmark', 'marry', 'King', 'Christian', 'who', 'very', 'least', 'extremely', 'eccentric', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'beginning', 'movie', 'viewer', 'strong', 'dislike', 'King', 'Christian', 'once', 'see', 'how', 'treated', 'patronized', 'council', 'begin', 'develop', 'more', 'little', 'sympathy', 'as', 'well', 'Caroline', 'being', 'so', 'very', 'young', 'understand', 'young', 'king', 'debauched', 'weird', 'ways', 'two', 'become', 'estranged.Alicia', 'Vikander', 'part', 'Queen', 'Caroline', 'extremely', 'well', 'starstruck', 'princess', 'act', 'way', 'disgust', 'new', 'husband', 'still', 'playing', 'part', 'dedicated', 'mother', 'Vikander', 'temptation', 'overact', 'many', 'scenes', 'grace', 'nuance', 'own', 'Mikkel', 'Flsgaard', 'especially', 'good', 'mercurial', 'eccentric', 'highly', 'changeable', 'King', 'Christian', 'IV', 'fickle', 'moods', 'are', 'convincing', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'character', 'also', 'well', 'developed', 'story.Later', 'king', 'given', 'court', 'companion', 'German', 'physician', 'Dr.', 'Johan', 'Freidrich', 'Struensee', 'who', 'also', 'intellectual', 'child', 'Enlightenment', 'friendship', 'Christian', 'changes', 'better', 'help', 'Struensee', 'Queen', 'Caroline', 'whom', 'Struensee', 'unfortunately', 'love', 'affair', 'Christian', 'brings', 'modern', 'reforms', 'Denmark', 'star-struck', 'lovers', 'reformers', 'are', 'doomed', 'however', 'nobility', 'whom', 'have', 'royally', 'ticked', 'off', 'affair', 'discovered', 'Caroline', 'exiled', 'Struensee', 'executed.Danish', 'film', 'icon', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'remarkable', 'job', 'playing', 'Struensee', 'intellectual', 'passion', '18th', 'century', 'reformer', 'carnal', 'passion', 'Queen', 'eventually', 'Mikkelsen', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'many', 'ways', 'story.I', 'must', 'also', 'give', 'kudos', 'director', 'Nikolaj', 'Arcel', 'who', 'expertly', 'constructed', 'scene', 'enough', 'attention', 'detail', 'make', 'period', 'piece', 'really', 'drew', 'audience', 'times', 'narrative', 'story', 'cluttering', 'point', 'confusion', 'weariness.This', 'one', 'finest', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'well', 'time', 'money']",N/A

1616586,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00ARX2VZW,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""A Royal Affair"" (En kongelig affre) is an account of the love affair between Queen Caroline Mathilde of Denmark and her husband's physician, the reformist Dr. Johann Struensee, in late-eighteenth century Denmark that led briefly to sweeping political reforms in that country. This account draws heavily on two novelizations of the relationship. In 1766, a teenaged Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) arrives from England to marry King Christian VII of Denmark (Mikkel Flsgaard), not realizing that he is mentally ill, childlike, and prone to outbursts. The King's jealousy of his new wife causes him to mistreat her, and the Queen, in turn, openly resents her husband. In 1769, the King returns from a trip abroad with a new physician who is able to calm his mood swings. Dr. Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen) is a radical Enlightenment thinker, however, and finds the Queen like-minded.Director Nikolaj Arcel has made a beautiful period film. The cast is beautiful too, conspicuously moreso than these people were in real life, though Mikkel Flsgaard does look a bit like Christian VII. Mads Mikkelsen is downright swarthy and much more masculine, by modern standards, than Dr. Struensee. The Danish film industry is learning from Hollywood. These are attractive people in attractive costumes, against a backdrop of gloomy Denmark, where the Enlightenment had not yet reached. The reformers must fight pestilence, abusive serfdom, a budget crisis, and powerful reactionary forces. The language spoken in the film is Danish, which would not have been the case in reality. German and French were spoken at court. Queen Caroline Mathilde didn't speak Danish, in fact. But the filmmakers understandably wanted to emphasize the story's Danish-ness.The Queen and Dr. Struensee are painted as flawed but heroic and ahead of their time. I'm sure they were those things, but they went out of their way to flaunt their affair in a socially conservative culture, and they tried to do too much too fast with limited resources and without the support of key factions in the government. It's interesting that the film chooses to make the couple more discreet than they actually were and de-emphasizes their libertine convictions, though those were as much a part of their ideology as their views on social justice. ""A Royal Affair"" is an enjoyable film that brings pivotal events in Danish history to a broad audience. The camera loves Alicia Vikander, who is Swedish and has since taken a number of roles in Hollywood films.

1616587,A3OJERVDCVKUGL,B00ARX2VZW,"M Marsh ""Mermarsh""","[0, 0]","As others have said, this film is based on a true story which is also an important story, especially for Denmark but also for the vastly more liberal Europe that was in the process of being born. The story begins with the arranged marriage between King Christian VII of Denmark and Princess Caroline Matilda of England.  By the time the princess was born her brother was already King George III of England, the same king who presided over our own revolution as well as the uneasy union of Ireland with England, making him the first true monarch of the UK.  One valuable thing the movie does is to flesh out the very appealing character of Matilda, who was both informal in her manners and a great reader, always curious about, and sympathetic with, the ideas of equality and liberty which were gaining traction in her lifetime.  Evidently the realization that their young queen was always considered charming and bright is new even to Danes, who learn the rudiments of this story as schoolchildren much as we learn about our revolutionary figures when we are that age, which is to say, as little more than stick figures.  Naturally enough the Danish focus has always been on the king whom Matilda married and their son, who became a very great, justly famous king.  At the age of fifteen, Caroline Matilda voyaged to Denmark where she found that she was unlucky in her marriage.  Whether Christian was mad or merely erratic, whether he was homosexual or merely inclined to confuse his wife with his daunting mother, he was always viewed as a foolish child by the nobility who controlled him and, through him, the country.  Their wish was to insulate Denmark from the modern ideas beginning to permeate Europe while preserving and maximizing their own wealth and power.  Social change began when a brilliant German doctor, Struensee, became Christian's first friend and, gradually, his sole political advisor. Eventually, however, for whatever reason (possibly bi-polar illness), Christian sank into a catatonic depression that left Struensee in power as de facto king -- and a very energetic king, too, issuing some 1,069 cabinet orders in about ten months.  During this time the two free-thinking foreigners, a low-born German doctor and the English Queen, almost certainly found both joy and solace in the queen's bed, forming as a small and very happy family into which the queen bore a daughter who was almost certainly fathered by Struensee.  These events comprise most of the movie which is a joy to watch, beautiful, fascinating, and very erotic.  Perhaps because the acting is so very good, the film never becomes either a preachy history lesson or a stilted costume drama.  Of course the preternaturally gifted Mikkelsen is a joy to watch, but so are the young Swedish actress who plays the queen and the novice actor who gives a masterful performance as the unfortunate king.  Still, even as we enjoy watching the two sensual and charming lovers, we realize that they are behaving very unwisely, failing at every step to protect themselves from the malice of the nobles and the superstitious rage of the people over whom the nobles have great influence.  Struensee's worst failure may have been scorning to form any coalition of power with the few nobles who might have been able to protect him from the many nobles who believed that both he and the queen were flouting all Danish custom while demeaning the beloved monarchy.  Therefore, for the two lovers, the ending had to be sad, and because the movie has so much emotional power from the first scene, of course their downfall is sad to watch, although it is also brief.  Moreover, as we learn in a final summary, in some sense the revolutionary doctor and his queen will triumph in the end, because the Denmark which they wanted so very much to create was soon recreated by Caroline Matilda's son, Frederick, who outdid Struensee himself in bringing about a famously bloodless, and even more liberal, revolution.  And that revolution has, of course, endured.  This is a movie I can unequivocally recommend as emotionally and aesthetically irresistible.",5,Superb Film,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,4117,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'also', 'important', 'story', 'especially', 'Denmark', 'also', 'vastly', 'more', 'liberal', 'Europe', 'was', 'process', 'being', 'born', 'story', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'King', 'Christian', 'VII', 'Denmark', 'Princess', 'Caroline', 'Matilda', 'England', 'time', 'princess', 'was', 'born', 'brother', 'was', 'already', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'England', 'same', 'king', 'who', 'presided', 'own', 'revolution', 'as', 'well', 'uneasy', 'union', 'Ireland', 'England', 'making', 'first', 'true', 'monarch', 'UK', 'One', 'valuable', 'thing', 'movie', 'flesh', 'out', 'very', 'appealing', 'character', 'Matilda', 'who', 'was', 'informal', 'manners', 'great', 'reader', 'always', 'curious', 'sympathetic', 'ideas', 'equality', 'liberty', 'were', 'gaining', 'traction', 'lifetime', 'Evidently', 'realization', 'young', 'queen', 'was', 'always', 'considered', 'charming', 'bright', 'new', 'even', 'Danes', 'who', 'learn', 'rudiments', 'story', 'schoolchildren', 'much', 'learn', 'revolutionary', 'figures', 'when', 'are', 'age', 'say', 'little', 'more', 'stick', 'figures', 'Naturally', 'enough', 'Danish', 'focus', 'always', 'been', 'king', 'whom', 'Matilda', 'married', 'son', 'who', 'became', 'very', 'great', 'justly', 'famous', 'king', 'age', 'fifteen', 'Caroline', 'Matilda', 'voyaged', 'Denmark', 'where', 'found', 'was', 'unlucky', 'marriage', 'Whether', 'Christian', 'was', 'mad', 'merely', 'erratic', 'was', 'homosexual', 'merely', 'inclined', 'confuse', 'wife', 'daunting', 'mother', 'was', 'always', 'viewed', 'foolish', 'child', 'nobility', 'who', 'controlled', 'country', 'wish', 'was', 'insulate', 'Denmark', 'modern', 'ideas', 'beginning', 'permeate', 'Europe', 'preserving', 'maximizing', 'own', 'wealth', 'power', 'Social', 'change', 'began', 'when', 'brilliant', 'German', 'doctor', 'Struensee', 'became', 'Christian', 'first', 'friend', 'gradually', 'sole', 'political', 'advisor', 'Eventually', 'however', 'reason', 'possibly', 'bi-polar', 'illness', 'Christian', 'sank', 'catatonic', 'depression', 'left', 'Struensee', 'power', 'de', 'facto', 'king', 'very', 'energetic', 'king', 'too', 'issuing', '1,069', 'cabinet', 'orders', 'about', 'ten', 'months', 'time', 'two', 'free-thinking', 'foreigners', 'low-born', 'German', 'doctor', 'English', 'Queen', 'almost', 'certainly', 'found', 'joy', 'solace', 'queen', 'bed', 'forming', 'small', 'very', 'happy', 'family', 'queen', 'bore', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'almost', 'certainly', 'fathered', 'Struensee', 'events', 'comprise', 'most', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'fascinating', 'very', 'erotic', 'Perhaps', 'acting', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'never', 'preachy', 'history', 'lesson', 'stilted', 'costume', 'drama', 'course', 'preternaturally', 'gifted', 'Mikkelsen', 'joy', 'watch', 'so', 'are', 'young', 'Swedish', 'actress', 'who', 'queen', 'novice', 'actor', 'who', 'masterful', 'performance', 'unfortunate', 'king', 'Still', 'even', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'two', 'sensual', 'charming', 'lovers', 'realize', 'are', 'behaving', 'very', 'unwisely', 'failing', 'step', 'protect', 'malice', 'nobles', 'superstitious', 'rage', 'people', 'whom', 'nobles', 'have', 'great', 'influence', 'Struensee', 'worst', 'failure', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'scorning', 'form', 'coalition', 'power', 'few', 'nobles', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'protect', 'many', 'nobles', 'who', 'believed', 'queen', 'were', 'flouting', 'Danish', 'custom', 'demeaning', 'beloved', 'monarchy', 'Therefore', 'two', 'lovers', 'ending', 'had', 'be', 'sad', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'power', 'first', 'scene', 'course', 'downfall', 'sad', 'watch', 'also', 'brief', 'Moreover', 'learn', 'final', 'summary', 'sense', 'revolutionary', 'doctor', 'queen', 'will', 'triumph', 'end', 'Denmark', 'wanted', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'create', 'was', 'soon', 'recreated', 'Caroline', 'Matilda', 'son', 'Frederick', 'who', 'outdid', 'Struensee', 'bringing', 'famously', 'bloodless', 'even', 'more', 'liberal', 'revolution', 'revolution', 'course', 'endured', 'movie', 'can', 'unequivocally', 'recommend', 'emotionally', 'aesthetically', 'irresistible']",N/A

Oleson,"[2, 2]","Up for an Oscar for best foreign language film, this Danish import delves into the true story of a British noblewoman betrothed to King Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Folsgaard).  Destined to never see England again Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander) is charged with delivering an heir to the throne.  The problem is that the young king is a bit shy and a bit touched in the head.  He is controlled by a counsel of advisors who pass restrictive laws and just tell the King to sign them.In what appears to be a rare opportunity, the new Queen entices Christian to perform and they manage to produce a healthy boy.  A couple of displaced Danish nobles are diplomats in Germany and convince Dr. Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen) that he should become the King's personal physician.  King Christian and Dr. Struensee become quickly connected as the doctor accepts the King's odd behavior.  As comely Caroline must remain chaste while her husband engages prostitutes, her connection with the handsome doctor portend problems ahead, both romantically and politically.While Struensee and the Queen conduct their clandestine affair, the King listens more and more to Struensee's counsel over the objections of the collective advisors.  Together Struensee and Christian remove arcane obstacles to freedom like censorship.  When the Queen becomes pregnant again, she must entice the King to visit her bedroom, long neglected.Adapted from Bodil Steensen-Leth's novel, director Nikolaj Arcel delivers a beautiful film.  Glorious photography (Rasmus Videbaek) flows throughout the film.  Excellent costumes and the elaborate sets distance the film from lesser efforts.  The film certainly has its soap opera moments but who cares.  The intrigue of the various interwoven plots, secrets and betrayals give the film an almost thriller feel, especially in the final act.  Even with an R rating the film eschews gory violence and even the bedroom scenes are not very explicit.

1616590,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00ARX2VZW,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[4, 6]","Swedish cinema (Danish colaboration) continues to show us what our movies, sometimes, only wish they could be - with just a fraction of the budget.  This is so much more than costume drama and is based on true events.  Whether you like political intrigue, the progress of human freedoms, costume drama or star crossed love, this movie will impress.Early 1770's - Young, progressive English Princess Caroline Mathilda is sent to Denmark as the bride of King Christian VII.  Her teenage romantic hopefulness is answered almost immediately in her first meeting with the young king who seems foppish and immature as a young child at the very best.  Her early fears are confirmed as the young king appears to be mad and is manipulated and marginalized by his corrupt counsel.  The archaic, essentially still feudal, system is causing the people to suffer and die while corruption funnels away the county's finances into ruin.Enter a German Doctor Struensee.  He is brought to court to help control the king's wilder behavior in spite of his views on human rights and ideas about modern governance (which he initially keeps secret).  He finds that being a friend to the king and showing a modicum of respect actually helps calm him and moderates his loathfull behavior to the queen.  Queen Caroline then finds that the very one she thought was her enemy is actually her best ally, like mind, confidant, and eventually lover.  The older doctor can of course not resist a woman so beautiful, young and of high standing that he could never dream to win.Their alliance, along with several other courtiers brought in, helps to seize control from the corrupt council and begins to affect policies of good governance which benefit the people immensely.  The ""how"" is very engaging and the entire process is an epoch and a treat.  Sacrifices are made along the way and one might ask if it was all worth it.  The policies enacted by Denmark were noted by great thinkers you would immediately recognize and were a shining light in Europe which was itself in turmoil of great change.  This movie was beautiful and romantic.  Yet, it also makes one ask questions of themselves at different points.  I wondered where my thought would have fallen back then.  I am a moderate conservative.  However, the principles of governance and human rights proposed at this period were considered very radical and progressive for their time.Again, I asked myself if the sacrifices were worth it.  But, Struensee won the love of a beautiful young queen , became primary consul of a nation, and changed the world.  He is immortalized.  What would one give for that?This is a shining example of what Swedish (and other Nordic countries) are accomplishing with their cinema right now. Stories of great depth and character development that Hollywood often refuses to attempt.  Only after movies like ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" or ""Battle Royal"" (Japanese), Hunger Games as we know it, gain such world acclaim does Hollywood come back and copy them.  I love the two Holywood productions I just mentioned, but it took someone else proving their value before they were willing to do stories like that.Alicia Vikander is hauntingly charming as Caroline, not so exotic that it's excessive.  In other words - perfect.  Mads Mikkelsen has so many terrific roles to his credit I should hardly even have to mention it.  Yet, his role as a marginally attractive, slightly older man that wins a queen with ideas is completely beleivable, never overdone.",5,"POLITICAL INGRIGUE, HISTORIC ENLIGHTENMENT, FORBIDDEN LOVE",1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,3508,"['Swedish', 'cinema', 'Danish', 'colaboration', 'show', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'fraction', 'budget', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'costume', 'drama', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'like', 'political', 'intrigue', 'progress', 'human', 'freedoms', 'costume', 'drama', 'star', 'crossed', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'impress.Early', '1770', 'Young', 'progressive', 'English', 'Princess', 'Caroline', 'Mathilda', 'sent', 'Denmark', 'bride', 'King', 'Christian', 'VII', 'teenage', 'romantic', 'hopefulness', 'answered', 'almost', 'immediately', 'first', 'meeting', 'young', 'king', 'who', 'foppish', 'immature', 'young', 'child', 'very', 'best', 'early', 'fears', 'are', 'confirmed', 'young', 'king', 'be', 'mad', 'manipulated', 'marginalized', 'corrupt', 'counsel', 'archaic', 'essentially', 'still', 'feudal', 'system', 'causing', 'people', 'suffer', 'die', 'corruption', 'funnels', 'away', 'county', 'finances', 'ruin.Enter', 'German', 'Doctor', 'Struensee', 'brought', 'court', 'help', 'control', 'king', 'wilder', 'behavior', 'spite', 'views', 'human', 'rights', 'ideas', 'modern', 'governance', 'initially', 'secret', 'being', 'friend', 'king', 'showing', 'modicum', 'respect', 'actually', 'calm', 'loathfull', 'behavior', 'queen', 'Queen', 'Caroline', 'then', 'very', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'enemy', 'actually', 'best', 'ally', 'mind', 'confidant', 'eventually', 'lover', 'older', 'doctor', 'can', 'course', 'not', 'resist', 'woman', 'so', 'beautiful', 'young', 'high', 'standing', 'could', 'never', 'dream', 'win.Their', 'alliance', 'several', 'other', 'courtiers', 'brought', 'seize', 'control', 'corrupt', 'council', 'affect', 'policies', 'good', 'governance', 'benefit', 'people', 'immensely', 'how', 'very', 'engaging', 'entire', 'process', 'epoch', 'treat', 'Sacrifices', 'are', 'made', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'was', 'policies', 'enacted', 'Denmark', 'were', 'noted', 'great', 'thinkers', 'would', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'were', 'shining', 'light', 'Europe', 'was', 'turmoil', 'great', 'change', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'also', 'one', 'ask', 'questions', 'different', 'points', 'wondered', 'where', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'back', 'then', 'am', 'moderate', 'conservative', 'However', 'principles', 'governance', 'human', 'rights', 'proposed', 'period', 'were', 'considered', 'very', 'radical', 'progressive', 'time.Again', 'asked', 'sacrifices', 'were', 'worth', 'Struensee', 'won', 'love', 'beautiful', 'young', 'queen', 'became', 'primary', 'consul', 'nation', 'changed', 'world', 'immortalized', 'What', 'would', 'one', 'give', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'Swedish', 'other', 'Nordic', 'countries', 'are', 'accomplishing', 'cinema', 'right', 'now', 'Stories', 'great', 'depth', 'character', 'development', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'attempt', 'Only', 'movies', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'Japanese', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'know', 'gain', 'such', 'world', 'acclaim', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'back', 'copy', 'love', 'two', 'Holywood', 'productions', 'just', 'mentioned', 'took', 'someone', 'else', 'proving', 'value', 'were', 'willing', 'do', 'stories', 'that.Alicia', 'Vikander', 'hauntingly', 'charming', 'Caroline', 'not', 'so', 'exotic', 'excessive', 'other', 'words', 'perfect', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'so', 'many', 'terrific', 'roles', 'credit', 'should', 'hardly', 'even', 'have', 'mention', 'role', 'marginally', 'attractive', 'slightly', 'older', 'man', 'queen', 'ideas', 'completely', 'beleivable', 'never', 'overdone']",N/A

Caroline's dreams of a fairy tale-like marriage are soon destroyed when it turns out that the King is utterly insane. After the royal couple's first child is born, Caroline becomes attracted to, and eventually becomes romantically involved with, the King's personal physician, Struensee (played by Mads Mikkelsen). As it happens, Struensee's role is much larger than just being the King's physician, as he has substantial influence over the King's political actions as well. Soon Struensee and Caroline are using the King as a pawn to advance their political ideas of freedom of speech and other such ""radical"" ideas. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, kudos to the producers who worked with a budget of 46 million Danish Krone (about US$ 8 million, mere peanuts in Hollywood terms) and bring us a grand scale historical drama, the likes of which we don't get to see made very often in Europe. The overall feeling of the movie is quite epic as a result. Second, also kudos to Mads Mikkelsen for his portrayal of the German physician Struensee, it is quite the tour-de-force.This movie premiered at the 2012 Berlin Film Festival, to great acclaim, and rightfully so.

It my opinion, american audiences have greatly missed on such wonderful costume drama and it is unfortunate that film did not receive as much publicity in the US as it should.It is a historical drama set in Denmark at the time when Voltaire was making his mark in France.  Europe was comprized of countries that lived in feudal social strata.  There were kings and queens and nobility and then there were indentured servants.  At the same time the age of enlightment was becoming to make its mark and many proponents of this philosophy were considered to be enemies of the state.Caroline was a young British princess promised to marriage to Denmark's king since she was a child.  He upbringing was marked be her education about Denmark, danish language, fine arts and subordination to her future husband and king.  She is thoughful and sensitive creature and she willingly accepts her fate as she sees it as a part of her royal duty.  Danish king on the other hand is immature and weak.  He is not happy about his destiny of being a ruler since he prefers havign fun, going to the parties and chasing other women.  Their marriage is an arrangement, until one day new doctor comes to the court whose only task is to manage increasingly unpredictable young ruler.  This moment changes destiny of all three people involved, as well as history of Denmark.At the time, film drags on, but it is interesting to watch court intrigues, rush for power and prestige, fabulous costumes....  Game between autocracy and democracy is blurred and everyone is interested in keeping their power, money and influence off and on the court.  Before long these three young people are entangled in the private affairs and affairs of the state and for such young and inexperienced people without strong political backup it is a game of self destruction when it is only a matter of time when their house of cards will fall right under them.For anyone who likes good historical drama, this is a perfect film.

Unfortunately, it didn't really do it for me. That is not to say this isn't a beautiful film with costumes to die for... because it has all that. What this movie didn't have for me was passion. I never felt that Caroline was really there emotionally as a character. King Christian VII of Denmark is emotionally disturbed but strangely loveable. He isn't cruel or unfeeling, he just doesn't want to be king, or may he doesn't want any responsibilities. Doctor Struensee is tossed into the royal court because King Christian likes him, or rather Dr. Struensee knows how to deal with the king.As the film progresses Caroline, the queen, has a long love affair with the doctor, and between the two of them they ""manage"" the King to begin enacting reforms for Denmark. The realization that this movie is based on fact was a major selling point for me. That the events happened is not so surprising. I mean, there was a reason the common folk rebelled and overthrew most of the monarchs in the world. They were either so inbred as to be mentally challenged or so removed from the needs of their population and inept that the populace was willing to try anything new.So, as with everything, this is based on my opinion.

Set in the Eighteenth Century when he needs a bride and a suitable wife is found in the English court in the form of Welsh, Caroline Mathilde played beautifully by Alicia Vikander  (`Anna Kerenina'). When she arrives at court it doesn't take too long to realise that her betrothed is a bit of a cad. He has beastly table manners, rude as I don't know what and is as much fun in bed as a randy cockroach - so love was never going to blossom. But she manages to give him an heir anyway.Meantime's the somewhat eccentric King goes on a tour, or progress, of Europe where he finds himself in dire need of a physician. Enter Dr. Johan Freidrich Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen - `Casino Royale') who is by all accounts a silver tongued charmer. But apart from that appendage he also has dangerous ideas in the new thinking department - yes he is part of the enlightenment movement that is sweeping across Europe. Ideas expounded and fuelled by the writings of Rousseau and Voltaire has meant a new imagination has taken hold and Queen Caroline is in for a bit of enlightening herself. So when the King decides she is too serious and that with the help of a physician she may improve her temper, Dr Struensee jumps at the chance like a school boy up for a game of conkers. What ensues is passion in the bedroom at court and intrigue that will set them on a collision course with all vested interests in Denmark.This is a sumptuous production that gets right into the very fabric of the times and is as visually rewarding as entertaining from a plot perspective. The acting is effortless in its execution, so much so that you are swept along with the entire thing. This is a film where you just lap it up. The cinematography is just brilliant and everything seems understated by what is actually unfolding on the screen. Director Nikolaj Arcel (`The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' 2009) has taken a truly unique script and made something remarkable and all the more so because of the collaboration involved. It is in Danish, English, German and French with good sub titles even though they are all in white which causes a few problems but I managed fairly well and in no way irritating enough to detract from what is a great film experience truly exceptional.",5,"Mad Danish King, Welsh Queen and an Enlightened German Doctor - Stuffs Gonna happen!",1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,2355,"['Danish', 'Swedish', 'Czech', 'co', 'production', 'life', 'god', 'old', 'mad', 'King', 'Christian', 'VII', 'Denmark', 'Set', 'Eighteenth', 'Century', 'when', 'bride', 'suitable', 'wife', 'found', 'English', 'court', 'form', 'Welsh', 'Caroline', 'Mathilde', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Alicia', 'Vikander', 'Anna', 'Kerenina', 'When', 'court', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'realise', 'betrothed', 'bit', 'cad', 'beastly', 'table', 'manners', 'rude', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'bed', 'randy', 'cockroach', 'so', 'love', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'blossom', 'give', 'heir', 'anyway.Meantime', 'somewhat', 'eccentric', 'King', 'tour', 'progress', 'Europe', 'where', 'dire', 'need', 'physician', 'Enter', 'Dr.', 'Johan', 'Freidrich', 'Struensee', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'who', 'accounts', 'silver', 'tongued', 'charmer', 'apart', 'appendage', 'also', 'dangerous', 'ideas', 'new', 'thinking', 'department', 'yes', 'part', 'enlightenment', 'movement', 'sweeping', 'Europe', 'Ideas', 'expounded', 'fuelled', 'writings', 'Rousseau', 'Voltaire', 'meant', 'new', 'imagination', 'taken', 'hold', 'Queen', 'Caroline', 'bit', 'enlightening', 'So', 'when', 'King', 'too', 'serious', 'help', 'physician', 'may', 'improve', 'temper', 'Dr', 'Struensee', 'chance', 'school', 'boy', 'up', 'game', 'conkers', 'What', 'passion', 'bedroom', 'court', 'intrigue', 'will', 'set', 'collision', 'course', 'vested', 'interests', 'Denmark.This', 'sumptuous', 'production', 'right', 'very', 'fabric', 'times', 'as', 'visually', 'rewarding', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'perspective', 'acting', 'effortless', 'execution', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'swept', 'entire', 'thing', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'lap', 'up', 'cinematography', 'just', 'brilliant', 'everything', 'understated', 'what', 'actually', 'unfolding', 'screen', 'Director', 'Nikolaj', 'Arcel', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '2009', 'taken', 'truly', 'unique', 'script', 'made', 'something', 'remarkable', 'more', 'so', 'collaboration', 'involved', 'Danish', 'English', 'German', 'French', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'even', 'are', 'white', 'few', 'problems', 'managed', 'fairly', 'well', 'way', 'irritating', 'enough', 'detract', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'experience', 'truly', 'exceptional']",N/A

At the Danish court, however, looking at the troubled king's erratic behavior, Caroline realizes that her marriage will be a disaster. She was not as lucky as the young Queen Victoria.The debauched king gets ill, and a skilled doctor and radical thinker Johann Friedrich Struensee (charismatic Mads Mikkelsen) is called in. That's where the story becomes really interesting. While acting as the King's advisor in political matters, Struensee starts having an affair with the Queen.I hear everyone in Denmark knows these historical events. Set in the late 1760s and early 70s (about two decades before the French Revolution), ""A Royal Affair"" offers an engaging look at a unique era in Danish history, when so many progressive ideas were put into practice.

1616620,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00ARX2VZW,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Who knew? The history of the Danish Royal family is just as fascinating as the British Monarchy. 'A Royal Affair' is a historical drama based on the 18th century machinations of the court of King Christian VII of Denmark.The film begins when Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, travels to Denmark, to consummate her arranged marriage to King Christian VII. Keep in mind that Caroline was only 15 years old when she got hitched to Christian (Alicia Vikander, who plays Caroline, was about 24 when the film was made). To put it mildly, Caroline is shocked when she discovers that the King is not the prince of her dreams. In fact, he's both coarse and possibly mentally ill.'A Royal Affair' is most fascinating when the focus is on King Christian. Was he really mentally ill? Some say he would have been diagnosed as schizophrenic today and certainly he had a number of 'meltdowns' that would suggest that he was seriously off his rocker. My theory is that he probably would have been diagnosed as bi-polar and placed on medications, if he was alive today. In addition to his violent mood swings, the King alienated his wife due to his debauched lifestyle. He was a frequent visitor to brothels and had relationships with prostitutes.Right away we see how out of control Christian is, when he humiliates Caroline, while she's playing the harpsichord in front of members of the court. The uncouth Christian comments on her ""fat thighs"" and she flees the room in tears. Eventually, Caroline must endure having sex with Christian in order to produce an heir. The second act concerns the appearance of a German national, Johann Friedrich Struensee, who becomes the King's personal physician and confidante. The affair that develops between Caroline and Struensee is rather perfunctory. Bored and disgusted by Christian, she turns to the German physician after she's attracted to his liberal world view (Struensee is a proud promoter of the Enlightenment, the liberal philosophy sweeping Europe at the time).Eventually, Struensee gains influence over Christian and convinces him to dismiss the conservative council which basically rules the country. For a short time, Struensee is in charge, and issues new, progressive laws, that enrage the conservative coterie of landholders. Struensee ends up getting his head chopped off after the conservatives intimidate the king, who ends up signing a warrant for his arrest. Caroline is deported to a Danish colony in Germany, where she ends up contracting scarlet fever and dies at the very young age of 25.In the closing narration, we learn that Christian's son, King Frederick, eventually re-institutes many of Struensee's reforms and is hailed as a progressive hero. According to Wikipedia, Frederick did indeed issue progressive laws while he was regent and his father was still alive. But after he became king, he reverted to conservatism and sided with the monied interests.'A Royal Affair' is an extremely well-made film about quite an interesting period in Danish history. Do not expect many fireworks when it comes to the actual affair between Caroline and the doctor. The two principals have little chemistry together. But the king's personality and the politics are fascinating and the film is beautifully photographed.
