There are no beautiful scenes of Canada that I was hoping to see.  Only the blue dress with the lace edging that Dr. Ogden wears in almost every episode.  She should have stayed a coroner for the police and not go to the sanatorium to work as a psychiatrist.  The never-ending love story between Detective Murdoch and the good doctor is getting very stale.  One episode they are full of passion and the next she is going off in a huff with all this loyalty for a husband she is divorcing and the man who discouraged her during her marriage for any forward step she wanted to take for her caree.  Detective Murdoch is so supportive and patiant with her and even sacrifices his religion for her and she has gotten to be a pain.  I am sorry this series has taken a turn for the worse.  The new coroner is lovely and her relationship with George, the nice policeman is refreshing. They have lost a fan with this series for me.

1668865,A39G8T57TC0R6R,B00EV1YZD2,"Douglas Echaiz ""Photo Phan""","[9, 13]","I have been a fan of this series early on - despite its cost. Regrettably, the main story between Murdoch and Julia is getting stale and pretty far from believable. Worse yet, almost every time Dr Odgen gets inserted in the stories she hurts Murdock. The icing on the cake was when Murdock finally gave Darcy what he deserved; she ends on Murdock opposite side. If the ending is attempting to pull you into the next series, as in Series 5, they are not succeeding. Dr. Ogden character sorry to say lost its value as the potential Murdock partner. The writers got lost in their attempt to provide her with moral character, integrity, leader of the feminist movement. If anything, I would be looking forward to Murdock dumping her, There have been so many better characters for him. Murdoch, even with a poor Catholic characterization has chosen love over questionable principles. Also, I must say that bluray does not favor Helene Joy in the latest seasons.In conclusion, It is really amazing that the supporting characters, particularly Crabtree and Dr. Grace saved this season. Best episodes were with Dr. Odgen being distant. Perhaps she should go too...After all the series is about Murdock not about her.",2,Too much of a good thing..,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1208,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'series', 'early', 'cost', 'Regrettably', 'main', 'story', 'Murdoch', 'Julia', 'getting', 'stale', 'pretty', 'far', 'believable', 'Worse', 'yet', 'almost', 'time', 'Dr', 'Odgen', 'inserted', 'stories', 'Murdock', 'icing', 'cake', 'was', 'when', 'Murdock', 'finally', 'gave', 'Darcy', 'what', 'deserved', 'Murdock', 'opposite', 'side', 'ending', 'attempting', 'pull', 'next', 'series', 'Series', '5', 'are', 'not', 'succeeding', 'Dr.', 'Ogden', 'character', 'sorry', 'say', 'lost', 'value', 'potential', 'Murdock', 'partner', 'writers', 'got', 'lost', 'attempt', 'provide', 'moral', 'character', 'integrity', 'leader', 'feminist', 'movement', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'Murdock', 'dumping', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'characters', 'Murdoch', 'even', 'poor', 'Catholic', 'characterization', 'chosen', 'love', 'questionable', 'principles', 'Also', 'must', 'say', 'bluray', 'not', 'favor', 'Helene', 'Joy', 'latest', 'seasons.In', 'conclusion', 'really', 'amazing', 'supporting', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Crabtree', 'Dr.', 'Grace', 'saved', 'season', 'Best', 'episodes', 'were', 'Dr.', 'Odgen', 'being', 'distant', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'go', 'too', 'series', 'Murdock', 'not']",Murdoch Mysteries: Season 6

1668867,A1C70R9KCILEU,B00EV1YZD2,Elle,"[2, 2]","Season six is as good as ever!  I'm looking forward to the next season.  I love this series.  It's hard, if not impossible, to find a series of excellent mysteries that involve the unsavory aspect of murder that doesn't degenerate into something rather sordid and even salacious or revel in that theme.  Murdock Mysteries, by today's standards is refreshingly devoid of sex scenes and foul language. I think in this respect, it reminds me very much of Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes.  There certainly is no lack of adult situations but they aren't prurient in nature.  It's very Victorian...as it should be considering it is set in the late 1800's.If you are new to the series, lucky you!  You have all six seasons to occupy yourself with while waiting for season seven!  I will be anxiously awaiting next season without that benefit...although I like to re-watch episodes from previous seasons.  There are only a handful of series that I enjoy enough to re-watch but this is definitely one of them.  (Seasons are available individually or in collection such asMurdoch Mysteries, Season One,Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4; Blu-ray is also available.)In addition to the old-fashioned and polite etiquette, what makes this series special to me is the tongue-in-cheek references to inventors and their inventions, the famous, and even the notorious of the 20th century.  The genius Detective Murdock also invents and discovers many of the forensic tools available today to enable him to solve mysteries of great magnitude plaguing Toronto, Canada. He's a man ahead of his time (or maybe he has a time machine.)  Of the gizmos created by Murdock and others, we see the invention of a flying machine, (nope, Wilbur and Orville Wright do not make an appearance), the use of radium dust and its properties are explored and a hint of its destructive powers are given, a metal detector, and others.  In a nod to the famous, we meet Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle (before his knighthood) returns to be introduced to the fictional character he created.  Winston Churchill makes an appearance in which, Inspector Brackenreid speculates he could be ""Prime Minister"" one day.  My favorite invention of this season is ""silly rubber.""  I will date myself and say that as a kid I played with the 20th century version of this.  Do they still make it?Thank goodness, all the great supporting characters return.  Inspector Brackenreid, Constable George Crabtree, Constable Henry Higgins, Dr. Emily Grace, Dr. Julia Ogden, Dr. Darcy Garland, and Chief Constable Giles.  Inspector Brackenreid continues to ""occasionally"" knock back a few glasses of his favorite beverage and his wife continues to frown upon it.  We meet his growing sons who are polite and respectful.  A concept totally foreign in today's portrayal of children/parent relationships.  Constable Crabtree and Dr. Grace step tentatively toward a budding romance and together they make some scientific discoveries of their own.  Constable Higgins is still efficient as the identifiable colleague in the collection of busy constables.  Dr. Julia Ogden is well, Julia.  She remains a lone crusader for equality for women in all issues with an emphasis on birth control and now divorce.  She and Murdock remain in love and wish to marry.  Julia's husband Darcy throws up some roadblocks there causing the two star-crossed lovers to consider their options.  (I confess to tiring of this thread in the series.)  And what would a season be without Mr. James Pendrick?All episodes are fun, fanciful, intriguing, and an all-around pleasure to watch.  I don't want to give anything away but I will say that I enjoyed episode five, Murdoch Au Naturel, wherein someone (or two?) goes undercover, or rather, uncovered to infiltrate a nudist colony.Enjoy!",5,Has Murdock Invented a Time Machine?,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,3804,"['Season', 'six', 'as', 'good', 'ever', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'season', 'love', 'series', 'hard', 'not', 'impossible', 'find', 'series', 'excellent', 'mysteries', 'involve', 'unsavory', 'aspect', 'murder', ""n't"", 'degenerate', 'something', 'rather', 'sordid', 'even', 'salacious', 'revel', 'theme', 'Murdock', 'Mysteries', 'today', 'standards', 'refreshingly', 'devoid', 'sex', 'scenes', 'foul', 'language', 'think', 'respect', 'very', 'much', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'certainly', 'lack', 'adult', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'prurient', 'nature', 'very', 'Victorian', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'set', 'late', ""1800's.If"", 'are', 'new', 'series', 'lucky', 'have', 'six', 'seasons', 'occupy', 'waiting', 'season', 'seven', 'will', 'be', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'next', 'season', 'benefit', 'like', 're-watch', 'episodes', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'series', 'enjoy', 'enough', 're-watch', 'definitely', 'one', 'Seasons', 'are', 'available', 'individually', 'collection', 'such', 'asMurdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Season', 'One', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Collection', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'available', 'addition', 'old-fashioned', 'polite', 'etiquette', 'what', 'series', 'special', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'references', 'inventors', 'inventions', 'famous', 'even', 'notorious', '20th', 'century', 'genius', 'Detective', 'Murdock', 'also', 'invents', 'discovers', 'many', 'forensic', 'tools', 'available', 'today', 'enable', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'great', 'magnitude', 'plaguing', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'man', 'ahead', 'time', 'maybe', 'time', 'machine', 'gizmos', 'created', 'Murdock', 'others', 'see', 'invention', 'flying', 'machine', 'nope', 'Wilbur', 'Orville', 'Wright', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'appearance', 'use', 'radium', 'dust', 'properties', 'are', 'explored', 'hint', 'destructive', 'powers', 'are', 'given', 'metal', 'detector', 'others', 'nod', 'famous', 'meet', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'knighthood', 'be', 'introduced', 'fictional', 'character', 'created', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'appearance', 'Inspector', 'Brackenreid', 'could', 'be', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'one', 'day', 'favorite', 'invention', 'season', 'silly', 'rubber', 'will', 'date', 'say', 'kid', 'played', '20th', 'century', 'version', 'Do', 'still', 'make', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'great', 'supporting', 'characters', 'return', 'Inspector', 'Brackenreid', 'Constable', 'George', 'Crabtree', 'Constable', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'Dr.', 'Emily', 'Grace', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Ogden', 'Dr.', 'Darcy', 'Garland', 'Chief', 'Constable', 'Giles', 'Inspector', 'Brackenreid', 'occasionally', 'knock', 'back', 'few', 'glasses', 'favorite', 'beverage', 'wife', 'frown', 'meet', 'growing', 'sons', 'who', 'are', 'polite', 'respectful', 'concept', 'totally', 'foreign', 'today', 'portrayal', 'children/parent', 'relationships', 'Constable', 'Crabtree', 'Dr.', 'Grace', 'step', 'tentatively', 'budding', 'romance', 'together', 'make', 'scientific', 'discoveries', 'own', 'Constable', 'Higgins', 'still', 'efficient', 'identifiable', 'colleague', 'collection', 'busy', 'constables', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Ogden', 'well', 'Julia', 'lone', 'crusader', 'equality', 'women', 'issues', 'emphasis', 'birth', 'control', 'now', 'divorce', 'Murdock', 'remain', 'love', 'wish', 'marry', 'Julia', 'husband', 'Darcy', 'up', 'roadblocks', 'causing', 'two', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'consider', 'options', 'confess', 'tiring', 'thread', 'series', 'would', 'season', 'be', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Pendrick', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'fanciful', 'intriguing', 'all-around', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'five', 'Murdoch', 'Au', 'Naturel', 'wherein', 'someone', 'two', 'undercover', 'rather', 'uncovered', 'infiltrate', 'nudist', 'colony.Enjoy']",Murdoch Mysteries: Season 6

I have purchased every series plus the mini series that came before the TV series. I liked it from the beginning because Murdoch was an intelligent, scientifically inclined, morally upright Catholic, who had left the Seminary to become a policeman. He used far sighted and modern (in the late 19 century) techniques ideas to solve crimes. I thought it was beautiful when he started falling in love with the female forensic doctor. They became close (kissing and hugging), and he dreams of having children with her. When he finds out much later that she had committed fornication and had an abortion (she didn't want a child to interfere with her career), he was at first surprised and cool towards her but eventually he forgave her because he loved her. Later she decided to leave Toronto for America without even telling him about it. When he found out he was saddened and hurt because she had not told him of her plans. After she had been gone for about 6 months he had an occasion to see her again. He had hoped to rekindle their relationship but she informed him that she was now engaged (in just 6 months!!). He congratulates her and wish her the best. Later she comes back to Toronto to visit her family. After helping him on a few cases she decides to stay. She is now married but you can see that she still has feeling for Murdoch (incidentally she never told her fianc&eacute; of her previous love relationship with Murdoch). In this last season she has now decided to divorce her husband, but in order to get a divorce she must say that she had been in an adulterous relationship. She ask Murdoch to sign a document saying he is the man who is involved in the adulterous relationship with her. At first he hesitates because of the religious implications (remember this is supposed to be the early 20th century). She then curses G-D and berates him for his moral thinking. Eventually he agrees. In one of the shows she is found at a nudist colony (this is the early 20th century). Who is writing the script for this show? What will be next? A lesbian scene with the atheist doctor  Look at how this morally upright Catholic has been beaten down into this type of servile behavior by a woman who doesn't deserve such a man. The crimes and their solutions are still very good, but every time the atheist shows up on the screen it's like a bad penny that you can't get rid of.",5,"Tired of the Atheist, Unfaithful Female Doctor",1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2487,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'have', 'purchased', 'series', 'mini', 'series', 'came', 'TV', 'series', 'liked', 'beginning', 'Murdoch', 'was', 'intelligent', 'scientifically', 'inclined', 'morally', 'upright', 'Catholic', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'Seminary', 'become', 'policeman', 'used', 'far', 'sighted', 'modern', 'late', '19', 'century', 'ideas', 'solve', 'crimes', 'thought', 'was', 'beautiful', 'when', 'started', 'falling', 'love', 'female', 'forensic', 'doctor', 'became', 'close', 'kissing', 'hugging', 'having', 'children', 'When', 'out', 'much', 'later', 'had', 'committed', 'fornication', 'had', 'abortion', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'child', 'interfere', 'career', 'was', 'first', 'surprised', 'cool', 'towards', 'eventually', 'forgave', 'loved', 'Later', 'decided', 'leave', 'Toronto', 'America', 'even', 'telling', 'When', 'found', 'was', 'saddened', 'hurt', 'had', 'not', 'told', 'plans', 'had', 'been', 'gone', 'about', '6', 'months', 'had', 'occasion', 'see', 'again', 'had', 'hoped', 'rekindle', 'relationship', 'informed', 'was', 'now', 'engaged', 'just', '6', 'months', 'wish', 'best', 'Later', 'back', 'Toronto', 'visit', 'family', 'helping', 'few', 'cases', 'stay', 'now', 'married', 'can', 'see', 'still', 'feeling', 'Murdoch', 'incidentally', 'never', 'told', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'previous', 'love', 'relationship', 'Murdoch', 'last', 'season', 'now', 'decided', 'divorce', 'husband', 'order', 'get', 'divorce', 'must', 'say', 'had', 'been', 'adulterous', 'relationship', 'ask', 'Murdoch', 'sign', 'document', 'saying', 'man', 'who', 'involved', 'adulterous', 'relationship', 'first', 'religious', 'implications', 'remember', 'supposed', 'be', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'then', 'G-D', 'moral', 'thinking', 'Eventually', 'one', 'shows', 'found', 'nudist', 'colony', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Who', 'writing', 'script', 'show', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'atheist', 'doctor', 'Look', 'how', 'morally', 'upright', 'Catholic', 'been', 'beaten', 'down', 'type', 'servile', 'behavior', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'such', 'man', 'crimes', 'solutions', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'atheist', 'up', 'screen', 'bad', 'penny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid']",Murdoch Mysteries: Season 6

First off let me say this, if you are a fan of the show by all means get this and watch it.  It is not bad, it is just seriously lacking in the original chemistry of the characters.  All of them!  I don't know why they even bothered with Julia, they should have just written her out of the show.  She walks through her lines, and her appearance is so changed. The new medical examiner that started a couple seasons back far exceeds her role.  She is wonderful.  Julia basically comes back as a love interest, and is not in the same role that endeared her to me. Just being Julia is not enough to warrent her being in the show.  JMHO.  Why they bleached her hair this awful shade that matches her complexion I will never know.  The love between Murdoch and Julia doesn't have the desire and tension it had in the previous series.  All that aside, the main problem is the scripts.  They are predictible, almost unbelievable at times. The ideas start out unique, but soon fade into silliness or just a walk though.  Nothing bad, nothing spectacular either.  Just so so.The last episode with Julia being convicted of murder was just unreal and stupid.  The sets were lacking and so was authenticity.I would still buy this DVD and watch it, because I feel dedicated to do so, and I will get the new one when it comes out.  I just hope they repair the characters, and get better writers.",3,"Disappointing, but buy it anyway!",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1503,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'beginning', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'release', 'season', '6', 'was', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'means', 'get', 'watch', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'original', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'even', 'bothered', 'Julia', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'written', 'show', 'walks', 'lines', 'appearance', 'so', 'changed', 'new', 'medical', 'examiner', 'started', 'couple', 'seasons', 'back', 'far', 'role', 'wonderful', 'Julia', 'basically', 'back', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'same', 'role', 'endeared', 'Just', 'being', 'Julia', 'not', 'enough', 'warrent', 'being', 'show', 'JMHO', 'Why', 'bleached', 'hair', 'awful', 'shade', 'complexion', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'love', 'Murdoch', 'Julia', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'tension', 'had', 'previous', 'series', 'aside', 'main', 'problem', 'scripts', 'are', 'predictible', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'ideas', 'start', 'unique', 'soon', 'fade', 'silliness', 'just', 'walk', 'Nothing', 'bad', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Just', 'so.The', 'last', 'episode', 'Julia', 'being', 'convicted', 'murder', 'was', 'just', 'unreal', 'stupid', 'sets', 'were', 'lacking', 'so', 'was', 'authenticity.I', 'would', 'still', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watch', 'feel', 'dedicated', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'get', 'new', 'one', 'when', 'out', 'just', 'hope', 'repair', 'characters', 'get', 'better', 'writers']",Murdoch Mysteries: Season 6
