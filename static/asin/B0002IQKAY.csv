Second, where did this $80 price tag come from for the first season COMPLETE box set?  I got mine from Best Buy the day it came out for $50.  Third, one set or two for season two, who really cares?  Obviously Fox is trying to worm a few more dollars out of the fans on this one which is just a fact of life these days and all of us blah blahs are going to pay it anyway no matter what so shut up.  The big question here is are there going to be any commentaries, featurettes or documentaries included on this set since season one didn't have anything worth mentioning?  I met the entire surviving cast of the show back in February of this year and they all said they had not been asked to participate on the DVDs even though they would love to.  I can live without any other extras and having this split up into two sets and having to pay a premium for it FOX, but it is criminal of you not to take advantage of these wonderful people sharing their memories of making this great series.

836174,A1475UMRVD1E6X,B0002IQKAY,Bob Siegel,"[13, 18]","As Season Two begins, something isn't quite the same as Season One. I'm not talking about the fact that the series is now in color( although, boy, you sure can see those paper boulders now)  I'm talking about the fact that the stories aren't quite as good and the feel is a little bit lighter.Still, the show begins with a blast off into space (something we waited for the entire first season), but just three episodes later, they crash land on another planet just like the first (and we automatically suspect they will be there for another whole year, even when we watched it in its original broadcast back in the sixties as a 7th grader, as I was)Two episodes later, we see the Jupiter traveling through space again but only through flashbacks as the Robinsons are put on trial for  ""crimes in space,""( probably an attempt to postpone our observation that this season is still going to be a one planet season. Incidentally, that was an excellent episode, mostly because it showed footage from the first two episodes of Season One, which, up to that point had never been repeated. Back in those days, so many episodes were made per season that an entire summer of reruns was not enough to repeat them all.As the year moves forward, we begin to notice less science fiction stories and more fantasy. I do not mean Lord of the Rings quality fantasy,(the understatement of the century) but rather stupid singing Vikings, space cowboys,  well. you get the picture. (Mercifully I will not say much about the rock bottom episode with Penny and the dragon, that looked like a first grade school pageant and comes into a dead tie with the infamous vegetable people episode in Season Three)The show gets so stupid that many of the fans feel betrayed. Then, somewhere in the second half of the season it looks as if somebody at CBS got the message. The stories get better again(never as good as Season One, those days are gone) but better, with aliens that look like aliens and a usage of characters other than Dr. Smith, Will and the robot.(characters that I liked before they became too overdone and before Dr. Smith went from being an evil but eccentric villain and before the robot turned from a real robot to a creature that sings, laughs cries and make you feel embarrassed for even admitting that you watch the show.All in all, since it started out fair and ended up with an effort to return to the original magic, I am buying Season Two. Admittedly most of my reasons are nostalgic. I would be hard pressed to call any of this quality.But all the nostalgia in the world will not get me to buy Season Three. Although they traveled through space again on and off for the whole year and tried again to make the show science fiction, the truth is, it had gotten so stupid that the producers didn't seem to know how to get out of it.Bottom line: I love Lost In Space. But if I ever run for public office, I may have to employ a publicist who will ""categorically deny any ties to the series.""",3,Not Season One But At Least It's Not Season Three,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2984,"['Season', 'Two', 'begins', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'Season', 'One', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'fact', 'series', 'now', 'color', 'boy', 'sure', 'can', 'see', 'paper', 'boulders', 'now', ""'m"", 'talking', 'fact', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'lighter.Still', 'show', 'blast', 'off', 'space', 'something', 'waited', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'three', 'episodes', 'later', 'crash', 'land', 'planet', 'just', 'first', 'automatically', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'whole', 'year', 'even', 'when', 'watched', 'original', 'broadcast', 'back', 'sixties', '7th', 'grader', 'was', 'Two', 'episodes', 'later', 'see', 'Jupiter', 'traveling', 'space', 'again', 'only', 'through', 'flashbacks', 'Robinsons', 'are', 'put', 'trial', 'crimes', 'space', 'probably', 'attempt', 'postpone', 'observation', 'season', 'still', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'planet', 'season', 'Incidentally', 'was', 'excellent', 'episode', 'mostly', 'showed', 'footage', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'up', 'point', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'repeated', 'Back', 'days', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'season', 'entire', 'summer', 'reruns', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'repeat', 'all.As', 'year', 'forward', 'begin', 'notice', 'less', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'more', 'fantasy', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quality', 'fantasy', 'understatement', 'century', 'rather', 'stupid', 'singing', 'Vikings', 'space', 'cowboys', 'well', 'get', 'picture', 'Mercifully', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'rock', 'bottom', 'episode', 'Penny', 'dragon', 'looked', 'first', 'grade', 'school', 'pageant', 'dead', 'tie', 'infamous', 'vegetable', 'people', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'show', 'so', 'stupid', 'many', 'fans', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'Then', 'somewhere', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'somebody', 'CBS', 'got', 'message', 'stories', 'get', 'better', 'again', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'Season', 'One', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'better', 'aliens', 'look', 'aliens', 'usage', 'characters', 'other', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'Will', 'robot', 'characters', 'liked', 'became', 'too', 'overdone', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'went', 'being', 'evil', 'eccentric', 'villain', 'robot', 'turned', 'real', 'robot', 'creature', 'sings', 'cries', 'make', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'even', 'admitting', 'watch', 'show.All', 'started', 'out', 'fair', 'ended', 'up', 'effort', 'return', 'original', 'magic', 'am', 'buying', 'Season', 'Two', 'Admittedly', 'most', 'reasons', 'are', 'nostalgic', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'call', 'quality.But', 'nostalgia', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'buy', 'Season', 'Three', 'traveled', 'space', 'again', 'whole', 'year', 'tried', 'again', 'make', 'show', 'science', 'fiction', 'truth', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'stupid', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'Lost', 'Space', 'ever', 'run', 'public', 'office', 'may', 'have', 'employ', 'publicist', 'who', 'will', 'categorically', 'deny', 'ties', 'series']",N/A

836176,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B0002IQKAY,Brian A. Wolters,"[8, 8]","Lost In Space Season 2 picks right up where Season 1 ended, by introducing us again to ""comedic villain"" of the week. And despite an almost 3 episode stretch where you can feel a slight return to pure adventure, it takes the ""comedic villain"" of the week formula and adds on farce and fantasy. Thus, you have season 2.Season 2 Volume 1 is the first half of a season that tried to reinvent the series but it then crashes (literally) head first into farce. That doesn't mean it wasn't often charming and fun, but the Lost in Space of early Season 1 would never return. The opening episode, Blast of Into Space is an episode that rids us of the villain early to focus once again on the plight of their situation. ""Wild Adventure"", the best of Season 2 and one of the strongest of the series, is a great space bound adventure getting them close to Earth. And while Ghost Planet was silly at times, it wasn't a planet that they were stuck on.However, from the middle of Forbidden World on, the adventure element was nearly gone and we had fun, comical episodes wish some dashes of danger. The first half of Season 2, featured in this volume, is arguably the best. ""Prisoners of Space"" gave us a break from the visiting villain and while a flashback show, it was fairly riveting for the series. After that, we enter a stretch of bland yet still entertaining episodes. ""The Golden Man"" featured horrible masks and beach ball bombs but it was one of the stronger shows of the season. As volume 1 ends, we start hitting some of the worst episodes of the series.The DVD transfers are crisp and colorful but one expected them to be just a little better. I understand the marketing reasons for splitting the seasons up but for fans of the show, it isn't a great idea.Volume 1 is an essential part of your Lost in Space Collection.

I was retunctantly going to buy Season 2 so that I would have a complete collection. However, Fox's unsuppported and illogical decision to split Season 2 into two volumes, has made me postpone my decision to buy Season 2. I've never heard or seen such a thing. I hope Fox releases a decision as to why American buyers are being subjected to this version verses UK buyers, who are not. Unfair! I may just wait and purchase Season 3 and forego Season 2.

At first I was upset about the split season sets but I quickly did the math.  I paid $59 for season one at Sam's Club.  Today I paid $24 for season two, part one.  Now, assuming I pay the same for season two, part two, that is $11 less for the complete season two than I paid for season one.  Sure I have to wait a while to get the rest of season two, but it is cheaper, despite what many perceived as split sets intended to gouge our wallets.

As a teenager watching these shows in reruns my pleasure came from the cheap looking sets and often re-used props and stock footage of alien space ships arriving and leaving.  Jonathan Harris' Dr Smith was no longer an annoyance (as I thought as a child) but the best reason to watch the show.  As an adult I can only think of Dr Smith's character which due to the ""special guest star"" status credit as the best series long guest star in the history of TV.  Jonathan Harris is just brilliant at pulling the hood over the white toast Robinson family episode after episode.

836193,ATY3CA83198BC,B0002IQKAY,KEN,"[2, 5]","I love the non-campy, serious episode when John and Don are tinkering with some machine and out of nowhere, the evil ""anti-world"" John Robinson appears from that machine, and then he somehow takes John back to his ""anti"" world, and locks him up in a cage.  And the evil John attempts to get the Don and the famiy to prepare to launch the ship off of that planet, leaving the real John behind.I forget how he gets found out by the Robinsons, but, anyways, the Robinsons go into that ""anti"" world via that machine to rescue him.  The neat thing in the ""anti"" world is when the crew travel along that wierd path in space to the ""anti"" world.  It's like a one of those moving walking paths at an airport, where you can just stand still and it will move you, but in space. Great episode.And I LOVE the episode, when the Robinson's encounter those alien teenagers on that planet who cannot age any further.  They appear friendly to the Robinsons at first, but, then their motive later on is to perform some kind of surgery on Will and Penny and take something from them (I forget what) that will let the Aliens grow into adults.  It was great when those alien teens would, after hearing a loud alarm that would sound off periodically during the episode, would just stop whatever they are doing and start dancing to a neat sounding piece of music from the 60's. Just out of the blue, they start dancing.How about the VERY silly episode, when Dr Smith and the Robot turn the Jupiter 2 into the ""Happy Acres Hotel"" for aliens after the other Robinsons leave the ship for some reason in that Chariot.  I liked this one, although, very, stupid and silly.And I love when the Robot grows to a much larger size.  And Will and Dr Smith get in trouble while walking inside the Robot, because they are being pursued by the Robot's inner protective mechanisms.  These machines persue Will and Smith just like white blood cells pursue a virus in our own bodies.  And then the robot starts to shrink back to normal while they are still inside, and they have to race to escape. Great!!!!I hope these are on Season 2, volume 1.

836196,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B0002IQKAY,Kevin R. Austra,"[0, 0]","Do not let my review title lead you astray.  LOST IN SPACE was one of my all time favorite television shows. When the show ended its CBS prime time run in 1968 I subsequently enjoyed the series again in syndication.  I am thoroughly enjoying all three seasons of the show on DVD.  It has been more than three decades since I last had the pleasure of viewing many of these episodes.  Even better that Season Two is in color.  When LOST IN SPACE first aired on network television I was limited to watching it on black and white TVs.Playing the DVD episodes on a large flat screen television it is almost as if I am seeing these chapters for the first time.  There are things going on and props in various scenes that I never noticed before.  Particularly with Season Two I never fully realized how frequently props were recycled and often show up in back to back episodes.Season Two continues the transition from Season One where Dr. Smith, Will and the Robot most often take center stage.  Let's face it, by Season Two Jonathan Harris emerged as the star of the show.  Almost every episode revolved around Zachary Smith.  At the very least Dr. Smith was the catalyst for most of the problems suffered by the Robinson family.  Yes, some of the shows can seem a bit goofy if you try to apply too much logic.  To enjoy this show you have to put astro-physics and astronomy aside, particuarly when the scripts use ""Solar System,"" ""Galaxy"" and ""Universe"" interchangeably.In Season Two the Robinsons finally coax the battered Jupiter 2 back into space and even enjoy a fly-by of their home solar system, including fleeting contact with Alpha Control, before exiting the galaxy again.  After this episode the Jupiter crew is technically no longer lost as their jaunt through a familiar solar system would have given them a solid reference point.  Had it not been for the rescue of Dr. Smith from the Green Lady the Robinsons would have had enough maneuvering fuel to return to Earth.Early in Season Two the Robinsons crash on yet another desert planet (almost identical to the plant they just left) that seems to be a galactic Grand Central Station.  Aliens of every sort are drawn to the planet.  Sadly everyone except the Robinsons have the ability to effortlessly come and go.  As in Season One many of the set dressings relied heavily on left over Twentieth Century Fox historic period movie props.I gave this season only four stars because the quality of the DVDs, at least those I received in Volume One and Two, leave something to be desired.  The quality is very good, but it is not what I have come to expect of classic television shows transferred to DVD.  Granted that the image is on a screen larger than was ever intended -- or available -- in the 1960s.  That having been said I found that some of the episodes do not have the absolute clarity of the black and white Season One LOST IN SPACE DVDs.  In all honesty some of the Season Two DVD episodes appear more like images from VHS tapes than they do from DVDs.  Additionally I have to ask:  ""Why no special features?""  There are no special features in Volume One and only some scanty recorded radio interviews on the last disk of Volume Two.Overall Season Two was well worth the purchase.

836198,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0002IQKAY,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[30, 30]","Season 1 of ""Lost in Space"" was presented as a single collection of eight DVDs.  Season 2 was split into two volumes.  Season 2 was originally shown in 1966-67, and though I no longer recall the contrast between ""Star Trek,"" which I watched contemporaneously with ""Lost in Space,"" and this show, the contrast had to be significant.  Though some of the first sixteen episodes of season 2 attempted serious subjects, as the first sixteen episodes progressed the series became increasingly campy, with ""The Girl from the Green Dimension"" being the silliest of the bunch.  I have to believe that Harry Raybould, who played Urso, looked back on his role in this episode and groans.On the other hand there are the episodes such as ""The Golden Man.""  This episode attempts to show that beauty is only skin deep.  While the acting is more than a little over the top, with veteran actor Dennis Patrick barely visible behind his golden makeup, the show does an excellent job of making its point.I found the episode ""A Visit to Hades"" to be very interesting.  Veteran actor Gerald Mohr does a nice job of playing a character with more than a passing resemblance to Satan, though we learn he is not.  Wally Cox takes a turn as a character with more bluff than bite in ""The Forbidden World.""  Peter Brocco, a veteran of more than 200 film and television appearances, makes his mark in ""The Deadly Games of Gamma 6.""You can count the number of science fiction television shows that left a lasting impression on viewers on your fingers.  As campy as ""Lost in Space"" sometimes was, it left an impression that is nearly as strong for many people as the impression that ""Star Trek"" left.  Of course ""Star Trek"" was a much bolder show, and tried to present some of the infinite possibilities that exist in the universe.  ""Lost in Space"" reached only a brief distance into the future and was the first non-animated television show that focused on a family of space pioneers.  There are plot holes galore.  Dr. Smith has to be one of the most obnoxious central characters in a television show ever.  And yet, I retain my fondness for this show.I think it is easy in this age of sophisticated digital effects and a chain of quality and classic science fiction television that extends back to at least the original ""Outer Limits"" to look down on ""Lost in Space"" as unworthy of appreciation.  However, the series was influential and it was memorable.  Had Irwin Allen been allowed to maintain the serious nature of the show, it is possible that ""Lost in Space"" would have been the landmark television show that ""Star Trek"" became.  I know I watched both, and I know I enjoyed ""Star Trek"" when it came out the year following the debut of ""Lost in Space.""  I considered myself lucky that two such wonderful shows were on at the same time.I look back on ""Lost in Space"" with fondness, and I absolutely enjoyed watching every single episode in this collection as well as those in season 1.  I know I will enjoy the remaining episodes in season 2 and those of season 3.  Perhaps my fondness is all nostalgia.  If so, I will revel in my nostalgia and just maybe I will watch all the episodes one more time.As a side note, after being a little boy and watching ""Lost in Space,"" I admired Will Robinson a lot.  I credit Will being a role model for my later years when I studied electronics and physics in college.  This show may have been campy, but I am glad that I was encouraged by a show like this one.  Perhaps we should all wish for more campy science fiction shows to encourage children to become scientists and engineers.",4,Danger!

836199,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B0002IQKAY,magellan,"[6, 9]","Lost in space came out when I was 13 years old, and although overshadowed by the much more sophisticated Star Trek a few years later, for the time it was state of the art as a sci fi TV series and I hardly ever missed a show. Also, I had a little crush on Penelope (played by Angela Cartwright) as no doubt did many other young teenage boys across the U.S.Lost in Space was the ultimate in sci-fi camp as it degenerated (or evolved, depending on your point of view) from the initial more serious episodes into a something that was sort of a combination of Swiss Family Robinson in space combined with the campiness of Gilligan's Island. Jonathan Harris's antics as he enlists the unwitting robot in various villainous but ultimately doomed schemes became an endless source of increasingly silly and cheesy plot ideas.I can't say I have a favorite episode, but I did like the one featuring Robbie the Robot from the movie, Forbidden Planet, and one episode features a very young Kurt Russell for all you Russell fans out there.I have to mention that I had the opportunity to meet the guy who was inside the robot at an event in Los Angeles last year, played by Bob May. Amazingly, 40 years later he still looked the same as in the original publicity photos. I wonder what the guy's secret was.Bob was pleased that I remembered that he (as the robot) had the biggest fan club of anyone in the show and received more fan mail than everyone in the cast combined. In fact, hundreds of fan clubs sprouted up across the U.S. devoted to the robot. :-)During the second season, the show got even campier and Dr. Smith even more dastardly and villainous and even more of a poltroon. Oddly enough, Jonathan Harris was a competent actor but his silly, unflattering role on LIS is probably how he will be remembered. I seem to remember he deliberately cultivated his semi-British sounding, villainous baritone that became his trademark, but I don't recall anymore how he got the idea.In the second season, Strother Martin and Wally Cox offer some relief from the bland acting of the other members of the cast. Until this series came out I mostly remembered Guy Williams as the handsome, dashing Zorro in that series, but unfortunately he'll probably be remembered more for this one as will Jonathan Harris.By the way, people to this day still make fun of the Billy Mumy character, but he has had a successful career as a composer, especially for commercials, but his band also has a few hit singles, I have read. He also plays half a dozen different instruments. And oddly enough, he wrote the song made famous by Dr. Demento on his show, ""Dead Puppies,"" which is supposedly the top-rated Dr. Demento song. And he is the house composer for I think it's Allstate Insurance's commercials. Anyway, it's one of the big insurance companies.In the 1970s and 1980s, I recall seeing bumper stickers that said, ""Bring the Lost in Space Crew Back."" How many of you saw those at the time? Well, eventually they did bring sort of bring them back when they did the Lost in Space movie in the late 90s. :-)If you're an old Lost In Space fan like me yearning for some classic nostalgia from a simpler, more innocent time in our history, you'll probably enjoy having all the old LIS episodes on these DVDs.",4,True nostalgia from a less troubled time,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3277,"['Lost', 'space', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', 'overshadowed', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Star', 'Trek', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'was', 'state', 'art', 'sci', 'fi', 'TV', 'series', 'hardly', 'ever', 'missed', 'show', 'Also', 'had', 'little', 'crush', 'Penelope', 'played', 'Angela', 'Cartwright', 'doubt', 'did', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'teenage', 'U.S.Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'ultimate', 'sci-fi', 'camp', 'degenerated', 'evolved', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'initial', 'more', 'serious', 'episodes', 'something', 'was', 'sort', 'combination', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'space', 'combined', 'campiness', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'antics', 'unwitting', 'robot', 'various', 'villainous', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'schemes', 'became', 'endless', 'source', 'increasingly', 'silly', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'ideas.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'favorite', 'episode', 'did', 'one', 'featuring', 'Robbie', 'Robot', 'movie', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'one', 'episode', 'very', 'young', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Russell', 'fans', 'out', 'there.I', 'have', 'mention', 'had', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'robot', 'event', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'last', 'year', 'played', 'Bob', 'May', 'Amazingly', '40', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'looked', 'same', 'original', 'publicity', 'photos', 'wonder', 'what', 'guy', 'secret', 'was.Bob', 'was', 'pleased', 'remembered', 'robot', 'had', 'biggest', 'fan', 'club', 'anyone', 'show', 'received', 'more', 'fan', 'mail', 'everyone', 'cast', 'combined', 'fact', 'hundreds', 'fan', 'clubs', 'sprouted', 'up', 'U.S.', 'devoted', 'robot', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'got', 'even', 'campier', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'even', 'more', 'dastardly', 'villainous', 'even', 'more', 'poltroon', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'was', 'competent', 'actor', 'silly', 'unflattering', 'role', 'LIS', 'probably', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'seem', 'remember', 'deliberately', 'cultivated', 'semi-British', 'sounding', 'villainous', 'baritone', 'became', 'trademark', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'anymore', 'how', 'got', 'idea.In', 'second', 'season', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'offer', 'relief', 'bland', 'acting', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'mostly', 'remembered', 'Guy', 'Williams', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'Zorro', 'series', 'unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'remembered', 'more', 'one', 'will', 'Jonathan', 'Harris.By', 'way', 'people', 'day', 'still', 'make', 'fun', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'character', 'had', 'successful', 'career', 'composer', 'especially', 'commercials', 'band', 'also', 'few', 'hit', 'singles', 'have', 'read', 'also', 'dozen', 'different', 'instruments', 'oddly', 'enough', 'wrote', 'song', 'made', 'famous', 'Dr.', 'Demento', 'show', 'Dead', 'Puppies', 'supposedly', 'top-rated', 'Dr.', 'Demento', 'song', 'house', 'composer', 'think', 'Allstate', 'Insurance', 'commercials', 'Anyway', 'one', 'big', 'insurance', 'companies.In', '1970s', '1980s', 'recall', 'seeing', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'said', 'Bring', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Crew', 'Back', 'How', 'many', 'saw', 'time', 'Well', 'eventually', 'did', 'bring', 'sort', 'bring', 'back', 'when', 'did', 'Lost', 'Space', 'movie', 'late', '90s', ""'re"", 'old', 'Lost', 'Space', 'fan', 'yearning', 'classic', 'nostalgia', 'simpler', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'history', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'having', 'old', 'LIS', 'DVDs']",N/A

The black and white era was one of shaky special effects, method acting, and weird storylines in the science fiction genre. Irwin Allen is a legend of this type of television and the cliffhangers were always worth coming back to, though were often resolved with outlandish solutions. The great thing about having the DVD box is not having to wait to see how they get out of all the messes week after week. The characters are the best thing about this and they are lovable, none more than Robot and Dr Smith. Both have become iconic to science fiction by themselves and have many quotable dialogue excerpts such as Robot's ""Danger Danger Will Robinson!"" or ""Warning! Warning!"". Dr Smith of course was the slimy mongrel villain who always gave false hope with his ""Never fear Smith is here!"" mantra. The girls in the show were nicely played and often the girls were just objects to be rescued when the monster of the week attacked.Season 2 was not up to the standard of Season 1 in terms of storylines and it got way out and campy beyond belief at times.

There aren't too many reviews written about Season Two volume 1, just a lot of unsure people writing about what they think may or may not happen. The Season Two release was Sept 14/04 and yet all the so called pre-reviews were done in June and July. Season Two Volume 1 starts to entertain ""Lost in Space"" fans from the moment you slip the disc into your player. The picture is clear and crisp and the mono sound is clean. The disc menus are well done and I haven't had any problems playing my DVD's. Season Two is in color and In my opinion the colors are vibrant and sharp. The box artwork and the disc artwork are well done and make the set look even more attractive. Listed below are the specs of the Season Two Volume 1 set.Season Two Volume 1. This 4-disc set runs 819 minutes and contains the following episodes:Disc 1 - blast off into space; wild adventure; the ghost planet; forbidden worldDisc 2 - space circus; the prisoners of space; the android machine; the deadly games of gamma 6Disc 3 - the thief from outer space; curse of cousin smith; west of mars; a visit to hadesDisc 4 - wreck of the robot; the dream monster; the golden man; the girl from the green dimensionThe Audio Soundtrack is in English, Spanish, or French, and subtitles are present in both English and Spanish.

I look at the series more for nostalgia and as a time capsule of the times in which the show was created.  The author of the book Lost in Lost in Space, was quite correct in saying that it's more about 60's fashions and family values than anything else.
