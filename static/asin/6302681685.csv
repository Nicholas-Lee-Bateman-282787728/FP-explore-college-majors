327634,A2DDH56KN6VHBU,6302681685,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Pure Country is a wonderful review of history, not because the film is historical in nature but because it is part of the early Strait years and helped to establish what George Strait country music was and would be.  The acting is visibly acting and the storyline is classic with little attempt at original plotting.  Essentially, the successful artist has lost his grip on where he started, leaves the stage long enough to visit his home, takes the advice and love of the grandmother who reared him, finds himself and a sweetheart, then returns to dismiss the foolish imposter who would like to be in his place, and the ending is happy for everyone with the artist even forgiving his longtime friend for attempting to control and use him; everyone is redeemed to some extint.  When you have had enough blood and guts, this is a sweet story with the added presence of a man who has been a sqeaky clean role model for at least twenty five years in the entertainment world.  It is okay if you don't cry at the end, just count how many times Strait kisses this actress.

Remember?  Garth Brooks was climbing the charts faster than a chimp up a banana tree and he was doing it with what?  With un-country-like special effects including bizarre light shows, pyrotechnics and smoke. Many other Country stars followed suit.To a purest like George Strait the rock-and-roll-ization of Country Music was tantamount to the vilest heresies.  What better way to speak out against it than with a movie that depicts a Country singer who has lost his way and rediscovers his roots and his life?  PURE COUNTRY makes an eloquent statement against the crossover efforts of Brooks and others while telling an enchanting story about the simplicity of the Country life.  The music, as would be expected, is fabulous and the cast performances, including George Strait doing some riding and roping, are terrific too.As far as the statement is concerned, I agree wholeheartedly with Strait's assessment of things.  Leave the lights and noise and smoke to KISS and other groups and performers who made that type of outlandish performance famous.

Sad to say, outside of that beautiful theme song (`I Cross My Heart') this film fails to be anything other than a notch in Strait's belt.  His performance is void of all emotion, and the clich&eacute; ridden plot cannot rise above the film's flaws.  The pacing is terrible and leads to a rather bland and emotionless ride that wears thin mere minutes in and drags on far longer than it should have.  This is not an engaging or a rewarding film, and Strait isn't the only `actor' messing up here.  Even Lesley Ann Warren muddles everything to the point of being an irritant.  My sister loves this.

327643,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302681685,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Pure Country is a good movie if you like Country Music--as played by George Strait. Strait acts in it, something he hasn't done before or since, and plays a character named Dusty Wyatt Chandler who is a big Country star.Dusty feels like he is not really playing the kind of music he wants to--his act is packaged like a 70's arena rock band with pyrotechnics and bright lights, and the show is so tightly choreographed that even if he drops out and stops singing in the middle of a song, no one even notices. He takes a hiatus to get back to his Pure Country roots. Earl Blackstock (John Doe of Los Angeles punk rock group X), his drummer, tries to find him--followed by Lula Rogers (Lesley Anne Warren) his manager, who has desperately tried to replace Dusty with road crew member Buddy Jackson (Kyle Chandler). Buddy's a wannabe singer and aspiring songwriter. Buddy lip syncs to a tape of Dusty and they are able to pull off an entire show, but no one is happy about it--except perhaps Buddy, who thinks he is now a big star.Meanwhile Dusty is wooing rodeo rider Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser), while working as a ranch hand on her father Ernest Tucker's (Rory Calhoun) ranch. Will the two love birds (Dusty and Harley) ever get together? That is the question. Will Dusty return to show business, albeit playing pure country music the way he wants? That is the even bigger question. If the story sounds a little hokey, that's because it is. But the story is really nothing more than an excuse for some really good music, after all, George Strait has an incredible number of hits, and he has been successful while remaining true to his country roots.George Strait should stick to what he does best--singing, but in a role that so closely resembles who he is, he did a great job. One thing though: even though he had a beard, ponytail, flashy clothes, and a fancier cowboy hat as the ""before"" Dusty--the impure Country singer--he still didn't dance. If George Strait ever starts dancing, then it's all over; but wouldn't it have been truer to the story if he had? In fact, the central metaphor of the film was the dancing chicken Earl and he had seen at the County Fair; where they peaked backstage and saw the barker cuing up the chicken music with one hand while turning on a stove underneath the stage with the other. They wondered: why didn't the chicken just jump off the stage? (What? And give up Show Biz?!?!?)?John Doe was good as the loyal sidekick Earl Blackstock, but I felt sorry for him having to deliver the corniest lines in the movie:----------------------------------Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Man, I should've known you'd find me. How'd you do it?Earl Blackstock: Oh, something to do with trees and roots. You wouldn't believe me if I told you.Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Grandma Ivy.==================================================----------------------------------Lula Rogers: [Earl is leaning against the back of Dusty's tour bus, breathing in the exhaust fumes] Earl, *what* are you doing?Earl Blackstock: Just tryin' to feel like I was back in California.================================================Was this the same man I shared a bottle of Jack Daniels with at a wrap party for a documentary on William S. Burroughs given at Survival Research Laboratories? The man I watched as stage manager at the Russian Center in San Francisco lead seminal Los Angeles punk band X, singing duets with his wife Exxene while pounding out the beat on his bass guitar with drummer Don Bonebreak, and the phenomenal Billy Zoom on guitar? Well, of course it was, and Doe was probably having the time of his life due to an early interest in Country Music, what with the obvious parallels to punk rock, and he fit right in with the musicians, who were played by George Strait's actual group.Lesley Ann Warren was fantastic as band manager and impresario Lula Rogers. She was a cougar on the prowl, always keeping an eye out for fresh young talent. The friction between Dusty and her was palpable:-----------------------------Lula Rogers: If it wasn't for me, you would probably still be singing in some run-down rat hole for a bunch of fat cowgirls from Iowa.Dusty Wyatt Chandler: Yeah, and if it wasn't for me, you would probably be a waitress there.==============================================This was the last movie for Rory Calhoun, who has hundreds of film and television credits going back as far as 1944. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film and one for television. He has also served time in San Quentin. He added a lot to Pure Country, or grits ain't groceries.In the beginning of the film you hear a young boy singing about the joys of pure Country Music. One would assume that this is meant to be a young Dusty, and indeed, it is the voice of George Strait's son, George Jr., AKA Bubba. He sings it totally out of tune, which made me wonder if George Strait's talent skipped a generation--or maybe he sounded just like his son when he was his age, but through hard work and dedication he developed his voice to the point that he is at today--a star Country Singer with tons of hit records to his name.George StraitShowgirls (Fully Exposed Edition)(1995) (performer: ""THE FIREMAN"")Lesley Ann WarrenSecretary(2002) ....

327656,AY12DBB0U420B,6302681685,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I listen to a little Country Music now and then. As a younger person I used to listen to a lot more but my tastes have gradually changed over the last six decades. However, I was shopping for DVDs in the Wal-Mart five-dollar bins and came across ""Pure Country"" starring George Strait, Lesley Ann Warren and Isabel Glasser. Well, I figured, that might make a nice addition to my music DVD collection, particularly since that modest collection had no country entries. Into the shopping cart it went and onto the TV it went last night.My first impression of the movie was negative. The sound was awful. I have a big-rig stereo (100 watts/channel, 7 speakers including dual 12-inch woofers and an 80-watt powered sub-woofer) and the sound came across as loud and muddy. The acoustics of the hall must have been terrible. I couldn't make out hardly any of the lyrics and even couldn't recognize the song itself. Yet, the people in the movie were all having a great time with it. Then a funny thing happened. The band manager talked to a another person and English subtitles appeared beneath the image. I chuckled. They were badly needed, that's for sure! But even funnier, those English subtitles stayed and were there even through all parts of the movie where there wasn't music in the background. I'd never seen a movie like this, at least not an American movie in America and with English subtitles. Well, they were helpful with all that noise and also helped with the strong country accents exhibited by  some of the actors. Strange movie.The acting was low grade and it took me a long time to get used to it. Well, they were portraying country folk and they came across as, well, country folk. It took a while for me to adjust, but I gradually came to feel that I was deep in country territory. I'd have to say it was effective, but I'm still not certain if it was intentional or the side effects of really bad acting. My feeling is, it's the latter. All of this probably comes across as snobbish and disrespectful, but I enjoyed this movie very much. It took a long time to win me over, but by the end of the movie I regarded it as an excellent movie and I think you might especially enjoy the movie if you're deeply immersed in Country Music and used to country people. I guess I'd have to say that it's a somewhat crudely done but a very enjoyable movie.Gary Peterson",4,"This Is An Enjoyable Movie, But Allow Time To Adjust.",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2370,"['listen', 'little', 'Country', 'Music', 'now', 'then', 'younger', 'person', 'used', 'listen', 'lot', 'more', 'tastes', 'have', 'gradually', 'changed', 'last', 'six', 'decades', 'However', 'was', 'shopping', 'DVDs', 'Wal-Mart', 'five-dollar', 'bins', 'came', 'Pure', 'Country', 'starring', 'George', 'Strait', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Isabel', 'Glasser', 'Well', 'figured', 'might', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'music', 'DVD', 'collection', 'particularly', 'modest', 'collection', 'had', 'country', 'shopping', 'cart', 'went', 'TV', 'went', 'last', 'night.My', 'first', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'negative', 'sound', 'was', 'awful', 'have', 'big-rig', 'stereo', '100', 'watts/channel', '7', 'speakers', 'including', 'dual', '12-inch', 'woofers', '80-watt', 'powered', 'sub-woofer', 'sound', 'came', 'loud', 'muddy', 'acoustics', 'hall', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'hardly', 'lyrics', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'song', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Then', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'band', 'manager', 'talked', 'person', 'English', 'subtitles', 'appeared', 'image', 'chuckled', 'were', 'badly', 'needed', 'sure', 'even', 'funnier', 'English', 'subtitles', 'stayed', 'were', 'there', 'even', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'music', 'background', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'American', 'movie', 'America', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Well', 'were', 'helpful', 'noise', 'also', 'helped', 'strong', 'country', 'accents', 'exhibited', 'actors', 'Strange', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'low', 'grade', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'Well', 'were', 'portraying', 'country', 'folk', 'came', 'well', 'country', 'folk', 'took', 'while', 'adjust', 'gradually', 'came', 'feel', 'was', 'deep', 'country', 'territory', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'effective', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'intentional', 'side', 'effects', 'really', 'bad', 'acting', 'feeling', 'latter', 'probably', 'across', 'snobbish', 'disrespectful', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'win', 'end', 'movie', 'regarded', 'excellent', 'movie', 'think', 'might', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'re"", 'deeply', 'immersed', 'Country', 'Music', 'used', 'country', 'people', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'somewhat', 'crudely', 'done', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Gary', 'Peterson']",Pure Country VHS

327676,A2BRSYSJO4L7VV,6302681685,"Ken ""KC Music Fan""","[58, 63]","I bought the video to Pure Country after listening to the soundtrack album. The movie is well-done. George Strait plays Dusty Chandler, a country music superstar who gets tired of the loud sound and overhyped special effects(smoke and strobe lights) in his shows. After an argument with his manager, Lula Rogers(played by Lesley Ann Warren), Dusty says to his best friend, Earl(John Doe), ""I'm just gonna take me a little walk,"" and he does that. He returns to his old hometown, cuts off his beard and ponytail, and tries to get back to his down-home country roots, going first to his Grandma Ivy's house and then to the bar where he once played. After Dusty leaves town, Lula tries to keep his show going at all costs. With some important concert dates coming up, including one in Las Vegas, she hires Buddy(Kyle Chandler), a member of Dusty's road crew, to lip-synch his songs. Most of the band members have doubts, but Lula goes ahead with the plan. The first concert date goes smoothly, and Lula justifies what she does by blaming Dusty for walking out. Lula also hires a private detective and goes off herself to find Dusty.Meanwhile, Dusty goes to a night club, where he meets the young rancher Harley, the other principal character(played by Isabel Glasser). Harley's boyfriend gets jealous upon seeing her with another guy, and a fight starts. After breaking his rival's nose, Dusty is knocked out in the parking lot and wakes up the next morning. He accepts Harley's offer of breakfast and later finds himself taking roping lessons. Before too long, with the help of Harley and her brothers, he becomes a good roper, and it turns out that his skills are needed. Harley's dad, Ernest(Rory Calhoun), is in danger of losing the ranch, and he is depending on Harley's winning her event at a big rodeo in Las Vegas to stay afloat.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it turns out to be a fairy tale in which things eventually work out well for everyone. Harley wins at the rodeo, saving her ranch. Dusty comes back, patches things up with everybody(except Buddy, whom he gets rid of after learning how much publicity Buddy's lip-synching act has gotten) and puts on a great show in Vegas--minus the ponytail, beard and fancy costume. Lula at long last gives Dusty an emotional apology. And despite Lula's efforts to break up his romance, Dusty gets his girl(Harley) in the end.Though George is the movie's star, Lesley Ann Warren, in my opinion, steals the show as the crafty Lula. Lula professes to be concerned about Dusty and his band members, but everything she does(using Buddy as a stand-in, hiring a private detective, and following Dusty) shows me that she's really in it for the money. It is only after watching Buddy's TV interview and seeing Harley, who turns out to be Dusty's true love, that Lula breaks down. We're not told much about Dusty and Lula's non-business relationship, although those who saw the movie(including myself) will see, from the barroom photo Dusty looks at, that she played in his band before he got popular and that she was his old girlfriend. John Doe's character, Earl, also plays an important role, though it's a minor one. He reminisces with Dusty about the old days(when they went to the carnival and watched the ""dancing chicken""). He defends Dusty against Lula's accusations that he(Dusty) walked out, and, being the loyal friend that he is, he walks out himself and follows Dusty to Harley's ranch.Director Chris Cain and writer Rex McGee did a very good job on this film. Their failure to develop Dusty and Lula's relationship further is the only flaw in an otherwise fine movie. The acting, though there aren't many well-known actors, is first-rate, and George sings a lot of great tunes, including the hit ""I Cross My Heart"", on an awesome soundtrack. I think, too, that George, who had never acted before except in TV commercials, does a very convincing job as Dusty. I became a George Strait fan after watching this movie. I think that even those who aren't music fans will like it. It's a great portrayal of country music, and it also is a good slice-of-life movie.",4,Straightforward plot; fine acting by George,1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,4134,"['bought', 'video', 'Pure', 'Country', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'movie', 'well-done', 'George', 'Strait', 'Dusty', 'Chandler', 'country', 'music', 'superstar', 'who', 'tired', 'loud', 'sound', 'overhyped', 'special', 'effects', 'smoke', 'strobe', 'lights', 'shows', 'argument', 'manager', 'Lula', 'Rogers', 'played', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Dusty', 'best', 'friend', 'Earl', 'John', 'Doe', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'take', 'little', 'walk', 'old', 'hometown', 'beard', 'ponytail', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'down-home', 'country', 'roots', 'going', 'first', 'Grandma', 'Ivy', 'house', 'then', 'bar', 'where', 'once', 'played', 'Dusty', 'town', 'Lula', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'costs', 'important', 'concert', 'dates', 'coming', 'up', 'including', 'one', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Buddy', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'member', 'Dusty', 'road', 'crew', 'lip-synch', 'songs', 'Most', 'band', 'members', 'have', 'doubts', 'Lula', 'ahead', 'plan', 'first', 'concert', 'date', 'smoothly', 'Lula', 'what', 'blaming', 'Dusty', 'walking', 'out', 'Lula', 'also', 'private', 'detective', 'off', 'find', 'Dusty.Meanwhile', 'Dusty', 'night', 'club', 'where', 'young', 'rancher', 'Harley', 'other', 'principal', 'character', 'played', 'Isabel', 'Glasser', 'Harley', 'boyfriend', 'jealous', 'seeing', 'guy', 'fight', 'breaking', 'rival', 'nose', 'Dusty', 'knocked', 'out', 'parking', 'lot', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'Harley', 'offer', 'breakfast', 'later', 'finds', 'taking', 'roping', 'lessons', 'too', 'long', 'help', 'Harley', 'brothers', 'good', 'roper', 'out', 'skills', 'are', 'needed', 'Harley', 'dad', 'Ernest', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'danger', 'losing', 'ranch', 'depending', 'Harley', 'winning', 'event', 'big', 'rodeo', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'stay', 'afloat.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'out', 'be', 'fairy', 'tale', 'things', 'eventually', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'everyone', 'Harley', 'rodeo', 'saving', 'ranch', 'Dusty', 'back', 'patches', 'things', 'up', 'everybody', 'Buddy', 'whom', 'rid', 'learning', 'how', 'much', 'publicity', 'Buddy', 'lip-synching', 'act', 'gotten', 'great', 'show', 'Vegas', 'minus', 'ponytail', 'beard', 'fancy', 'costume', 'Lula', 'long', 'last', 'Dusty', 'emotional', 'apology', 'Lula', 'efforts', 'break', 'up', 'romance', 'Dusty', 'girl', 'Harley', 'end.Though', 'George', 'movie', 'star', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'opinion', 'show', 'crafty', 'Lula', 'Lula', 'be', 'concerned', 'Dusty', 'band', 'members', 'everything', 'using', 'Buddy', 'stand-in', 'hiring', 'private', 'detective', 'following', 'Dusty', 'really', 'money', 'only', 'watching', 'Buddy', 'TV', 'interview', 'seeing', 'Harley', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Dusty', 'true', 'love', 'Lula', 'down', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'much', 'Dusty', 'Lula', 'non-business', 'relationship', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'including', 'will', 'see', 'barroom', 'photo', 'Dusty', 'played', 'band', 'got', 'popular', 'was', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'John', 'Doe', 'character', 'Earl', 'also', 'important', 'role', 'minor', 'one', 'Dusty', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'went', 'carnival', 'watched', 'dancing', 'chicken', 'Dusty', 'Lula', 'accusations', 'Dusty', 'walked', 'out', 'being', 'loyal', 'friend', 'out', 'Dusty', 'Harley', 'ranch.Director', 'Chris', 'Cain', 'writer', 'Rex', 'McGee', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'failure', 'develop', 'Dusty', 'Lula', 'relationship', 'further', 'only', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'movie', 'acting', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'well-known', 'actors', 'first-rate', 'George', 'lot', 'great', 'tunes', 'including', 'hit', 'Cross', 'My', 'Heart', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'think', 'too', 'George', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'TV', 'commercials', 'very', 'convincing', 'job', 'Dusty', 'became', 'George', 'Strait', 'fan', 'watching', 'movie', 'think', 'even', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'music', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'great', 'portrayal', 'country', 'music', 'also', 'good', 'slice-of-life', 'movie']",Pure Country VHS

George Strait proves why he's a superstar by turning in a great first time acting job as the fictitional country music star Dusty Chandler. One night after Dusty stops singing for three bars during a concert he figures out that it's the ""glitz"" and not the ""hits"" that fans are coming to see. This rude awakening causes him to take immediate stock of himself when he begins to feel like a ""dancing chicken"" in a traveling road show. And so he abruptly sets out on a search to find his roots and to recapture the love and passion he once had for performing. One night by way of a drunken stuper in a cowboy bar he meets the georgeous Harley Tucker (in a scene stealing performance by Isabel Glasser) and tries to defend her honor but he can barely stand up. So after losing a fight she takes one look at that killer smile and says.....hmmmm.....I think I'll bring this one home with me tonight. When Dusty's manager Lula Rogers (another scene stealing performance played by Lesley Ann Warren) finaly catches up with Dusty and sees her ""competition"" she sabotages the budding relationship by lying to Harley. When Dusty finds out what Lula did he lays down the law and Lula repents and finds Harley and comes clean with her. Then at his Vegas show Dusty (George that is) procedes to sing to Harley one of the greatest country ballads of all time ""I Cross My Heart"" in a spine tingling performance that will make you want to jump up and watch the movie all over again!

327703,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,6302681685,Rick Galati,"[11, 12]","First of all, George Strait is not a polished actor, and does not pretend to be. Yet for years Hollywood types, including Col. Tom Parker, (Elvis's manager) encouraged George to make a film. Talent scouts saw in him a handsomeness, a stage presence, and a likability that fans always knew. But George consistently turned down the offers, preferring to concentrate on his special brand of country music. Finally, a script was fashioned he could relate to. In certain ways, the plot holds to similarities that Strait adheres to. I have been to several of his sold-out concerts. And some of what he chaffes at in ""Pure Country"" is true. He does not like, and does not feel comfortable with the smoke, the lights, the ""volcano blasts"" deemed essential by some of his contemporaries. An intensely private man, his character of Dusty, relentlessly promoted by his ambitious manager Lula Rodgers, (Lesley Ann Warren) mirrors a view of a dissillusioned country superstar refusing to be a manipulated ""dancing chicken"" anymore. His spontaneous side trip off the concert circuit leads him back to his small town roots, where he rediscovers the passion that helped him attain superstar status. Shaving off his beard and pony tail in an attempt to remain anonymous, he meets the beautiful Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser). Instantly smitten, he hides his stage identity from Harley and makes no attempt to dazzle her with his status as a country music superstar. Indeed, he is just Wyatt and both start to fall deeply in love. Lula, however, will have no part of that, and conspires to undermine the relationship to get Dusty back on the road. Almost all of the songs in this wonderful movie are sung by Strait, and can be found on the Pure Country CD. For an album to be assembled so quickly to meet the requirements of film deadlines, it has gone on to become one of his best selling albums. One of the great mysteries of country music is why the catchy song ""Overnight Male"" was never released as a single and as a consequence never received radio air play. Rare is the concert where his fans do not clamor for him to sing it. Oh well. ""Pure Country"" is pure entertainment. If George Strait never makes another movie, he can be dang proud of this effort.

The film, which debuts country superstar George Strait's acting ability, is a quality film with a fun story that takes a look at the world of country music from the singer's point of view.George Strait plays Dusty Wyatt Chandler, a Garth Brooksesque superstar whose show has outgrown everyone's expectations, especially his own.  While performing at a massive arena to a sold out show, he has an epiphany that the fans are so caught up in his hype, in the pyro-technics and the fireworks and all the flash and dance, that they fail to notice when Dusty stops singing for several seconds.  Downed by the realization that people have forgotten his music, and angry with his manager, Lula Rogers (Lesley Ann Warren), after a disagreement about how his show should be performed, Dusty takes off, hitch-hiking his way back home to his small-town roots, leaving Lula, the band, and indeed, his entire entourage, scrambling to find him before their next show.When he returns home, he re-discovers why he began on the musical journey that took him into the big time, and at the same time meets and falls for Harley Tucker (Isabel Glasser), a proud but struggling ranch owner whose ranch is in risk of going under.The story takes the audience on a journey into America's heartland, where front porch philosophy, strong family values, and the need to return to your roots are the more important parts of a ""pure country"" life.  Through the experiences that unfold in his time off, Dusty discovers that there he must be responsible to the people that depend on him, but he must be true to himself and his music as well.With a ""feel-good"" ending that's sure to please, this movie is chock full of George Strait's music, including the hit ""I Cross My Heart"" which went on to become a number 1 hit for the singer after the movie's debut.This is a great film for all ages, and a movie parents can feel comfortable watching with the kids.  (NOTE: Minor ""make out"" scene near beginning of the film (nothing inappropriate, but as I am labelling this a ""family"" film, I want parents to be aware for younger audiences)).In a time when the world seems to be reeling from a lack of values, this is a great film that really is ""Pure Country"", with a down-home feel good story for the whole family.-Scott Kolecki",5,"A ""Pure"" Movie the Whole Family Will Enjoy!",1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,2490,"['large', 'amount', 'smut', 'ultra-violence', 'graphic', 'language', 'movies', 'today', 'Pure', 'Country', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'anyone', 'looking', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'film', 'country', 'superstar', 'George', 'Strait', 'acting', 'ability', 'quality', 'film', 'fun', 'story', 'look', 'world', 'country', 'music', 'singer', 'point', 'view.George', 'Strait', 'Dusty', 'Wyatt', 'Chandler', 'Garth', 'Brooksesque', 'superstar', 'show', 'outgrown', 'everyone', 'expectations', 'especially', 'own', 'performing', 'massive', 'arena', 'sold', 'out', 'show', 'epiphany', 'fans', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'pyro-technics', 'fireworks', 'flash', 'dance', 'fail', 'notice', 'when', 'Dusty', 'singing', 'several', 'seconds', 'Downed', 'realization', 'people', 'have', 'forgotten', 'music', 'angry', 'manager', 'Lula', 'Rogers', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'disagreement', 'how', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'performed', 'Dusty', 'off', 'hitch-hiking', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'small-town', 'roots', 'leaving', 'Lula', 'band', 'indeed', 'entire', 'entourage', 'scrambling', 'find', 'next', 'show.When', 'home', 'why', 'began', 'musical', 'journey', 'took', 'big', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'meets', 'falls', 'Harley', 'Tucker', 'Isabel', 'Glasser', 'proud', 'struggling', 'ranch', 'owner', 'ranch', 'risk', 'going', 'under.The', 'story', 'audience', 'journey', 'America', 'heartland', 'where', 'front', 'porch', 'philosophy', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'need', 'return', 'roots', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'parts', 'pure', 'country', 'life', 'experiences', 'unfold', 'time', 'off', 'Dusty', 'must', 'be', 'responsible', 'people', 'depend', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'music', 'well.With', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'sure', 'please', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'George', 'Strait', 'music', 'including', 'hit', 'Cross', 'My', 'Heart', 'went', 'become', 'number', '1', 'hit', 'singer', 'movie', 'debut.This', 'great', 'film', 'ages', 'movie', 'parents', 'can', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'kids', 'NOTE', 'Minor', 'make', 'out', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'nothing', 'inappropriate', 'am', 'labelling', 'family', 'film', 'want', 'parents', 'be', 'aware', 'younger', 'audiences', 'time', 'when', 'world', 'be', 'reeling', 'lack', 'values', 'great', 'film', 'really', 'Pure', 'Country', 'down-home', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'whole', 'family.-Scott', 'Kolecki']",Pure Country VHS

What a shame this was his only film !Colonel Tom Parker was a friend of Strait's manager and told him that George Strait had the same kind of charisma on film that the great Elvis Presley had,and that a movie career was his for the asking.However, the long delays between takes, the endless sitting around on the set was not appealing to George and he was never keen to repeat the experience.However, playing a singer who is sick and tired of the remoteness of his live performances, huge stadiums and lots of special effects, and no real contact with his audiences,  was a role tailor made for an artist as good as George Strait.His character Dusty, decides to escape the mindless existence he is currently living and walks away, hitches a ride and heads for anonimity.It is while he is ""on the run"" that he meets a young woman rodeo rider, well played by Isabel Glasser who takes him home where he awakes with a cruel hangover to meet her family, including her father the late Rory Calhoun in one of his last roles.The soundtrack of Pure Country was a best selling album for George Strait and stands on its own as a fine album. The song, I Cross My Heart sung at the end of the film became a favourite request at weddings, a beautiful love song indeed. Other great songs include Thoughts Of A Fool, The King Of Broken Hearts, Heartland, When Did You Stop Loving Me, and all are  worthy of countless replays.A good movie,great soundtrack, and George Strait - who could ask for more?",4,Pure Country - A Pure Delight,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,1663,"['George', 'Strait', 'been', 'headline', 'country', 'western', 'star', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'showed', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'holding', 'own', 'good', 'company', 'What', 'shame', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'was', 'friend', 'Strait', 'manager', 'told', 'George', 'Strait', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'charisma', 'film', 'great', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'had', 'movie', 'career', 'was', 'asking.However', 'long', 'delays', 'endless', 'sitting', 'around', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'appealing', 'George', 'was', 'never', 'keen', 'repeat', 'experience.However', 'playing', 'singer', 'who', 'sick', 'tired', 'remoteness', 'live', 'performances', 'huge', 'stadiums', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'real', 'contact', 'audiences', 'was', 'role', 'tailor', 'made', 'artist', 'as', 'good', 'George', 'Strait.His', 'character', 'Dusty', 'escape', 'mindless', 'existence', 'currently', 'living', 'walks', 'away', 'ride', 'heads', 'anonimity.It', 'run', 'young', 'woman', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'well', 'played', 'Isabel', 'Glasser', 'who', 'home', 'where', 'cruel', 'hangover', 'meet', 'family', 'including', 'father', 'late', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'one', 'last', 'roles.The', 'soundtrack', 'Pure', 'Country', 'was', 'best', 'selling', 'album', 'George', 'Strait', 'own', 'fine', 'album', 'song', 'Cross', 'Heart', 'sung', 'end', 'film', 'became', 'favourite', 'request', 'weddings', 'beautiful', 'love', 'song', 'indeed', 'Other', 'great', 'songs', 'include', 'Thoughts', 'A', 'Fool', 'King', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'Heartland', 'When', 'Did', 'Stop', 'Loving', 'Me', 'are', 'worthy', 'countless', 'replays.A', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'George', 'Strait', 'who', 'could', 'ask', 'more']",Pure Country VHS

I grew up on this movie and love it, so my 2 stars is for the product itself.First off, I put the DVD in my player on the widescreen side. Unfortunately, no matter which side I put the disc on, it was full-screen format. Second, the sound isn't that great. The movie hasn't been enhanced in any way, shape, or form. The sound is that of a VHS and those gross little white specks from older, non-enhanced films make quite a few appearances. I was hoping it would have been upgraded to be compatible with surround systems. Lastly, and thank God it's fixable, subtitles are always turned on when you start the movie.
