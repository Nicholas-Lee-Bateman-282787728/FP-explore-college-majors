Steve McQueen does all of his stunts, and they are authentic. He more than makes up for it in On Any Sunday after he didn't do the iconic jump scene during The Great Escape. Probably the coolest man alive during the film is Malcolm Smith who partakes in everything imaginable related to motorcycling. If a viewer isn't inspired by On Any Sunday to take up motorcycling, I suppose nothing else will. Within ten minutes of On Any Sunday, The Endless Summer immediately comes to mind if he has seen the film beforehand because there is an unmistakable identification of Bruce Brown's documentary style. In the film, the viewer is going to see what a motorcycle can do on any terrain possible, and there are plenty of ways of doing it, no matter the weather. There is one film trivia to mention. Bruce Brown, the director, initially sought permission from the Marine Corps officials at Camp Pendleton to use the beach for some of the scenes shown in On Any Sunday but was denied. So, Steve McQueen went to work and was awarded the full nine yards of the beach. That's what being the King of Cool is all about. All in all, kick back, relax, and enjoy On Any Sunday, one of the fastest and most inspiring films one can see on motorcycles.",5,Inspiring.,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1344,"['Viewed', '4/14Rate', '104/14', 'What', 'one', 'thing', 'King', 'Cool', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'motorcycle', 'film', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'stunts', 'are', 'authentic', 'more', 'up', 'Any', 'Sunday', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'iconic', 'jump', 'scene', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Probably', 'coolest', 'man', 'alive', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'Smith', 'who', 'partakes', 'everything', 'imaginable', 'related', 'motorcycling', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'Any', 'Sunday', 'take', 'up', 'motorcycling', 'suppose', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'Within', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Sunday', 'Endless', 'Summer', 'immediately', 'mind', 'seen', 'film', 'beforehand', 'unmistakable', 'identification', 'Bruce', 'Brown', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'viewer', 'going', 'see', 'what', 'motorcycle', 'can', 'do', 'terrain', 'possible', 'are', 'plenty', 'ways', 'doing', 'matter', 'weather', 'one', 'film', 'trivia', 'mention', 'Bruce', 'Brown', 'director', 'initially', 'sought', 'permission', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'officials', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'use', 'beach', 'scenes', 'shown', 'Any', 'Sunday', 'was', 'denied', 'So', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'went', 'work', 'was', 'awarded', 'full', 'nine', 'yards', 'beach', 'what', 'being', 'King', 'Cool', 'kick', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'Sunday', 'one', 'fastest', 'most', 'inspiring', 'films', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'motorcycles']",On Any Sunday VHS

I enjoyed the movie and found myself replaying it over 10 times and it is always nice to come back to it again. I especially liked the last bit at the end where all three bikers are riding around what appears to be a desert area near the coast of California.

The word went out that there was this movie that the makers would like to have reviewed by some real racers.  So many of us convened at the old Sacramento Memorial Auditorium for a private showing of the film.  We then were asked to rate it.  (I was surprised, but not that surprised to see a guy who had been a temporary guest at our house in the Steve McQueen MX section, leading Mr. McQueen - (the one with the tire marks on the yellow jersey whose initials are JH))!  So we all gave it our approval and the rest is history.  Later, at the 1971 Saddleback Park InterAm, (or Trans AMA by then) the filmakers took a parade lap in a dune buggy before the race started - in silence.  I was there for that too.  30 plus years later, I saw the film again and thought that it was a little condescending to everything but professional AMA racing, poking a lot of fun at the grassroots - sportsman riders.  But regardless of that, this film represents a historical document when MX was quickly becoming a popular race form in the U.S. It is good to have it as it is, but it would have been even better if more personalities of the day had been included rather than focusing on a handful of favorites.  (I always liked Steve McQueen, but he was not a champion racer ever).  But I don't wish to look back into a gift-horses mouth, we are fortunate to have ANY film from that period - and a sort of arbitrary McQueen document also exists because of this film.

It was one of the first movies I saw as I kid, and since then I have watched it whenver I can. Affectionate and witty, OAS gives a clear overview of the sport of motorcycle racing, showing the both its beauty and its brutality.  We see motocross, speedway, dirt bikes, desert racing, superbikes, ice racing, hill climbing and trials riding, plus a few things I probably forgot.Of course, the film was shot about 30 years ago (it can't be that long!) so it only shows the sport as it existed in 1970 or so, but as snapshot of a time and a group of people, it is nothing less than brilliant.When I saw it was out on DVD I pounced immediately.  The only quibbles I have are with the opening titles (cheesy 80's-vintage video) and the sound.  The narrator's voice only comes out of the left speaker.  Still, considering that this was not produced in dolby surround sound, it's a very minor complaint.",5,On Any Sunday,978393600,"01 2, 2001",2001,979,"['Sunday', 'simply', 'put', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'produced', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'saw', 'kid', 'then', 'have', 'watched', 'can', 'Affectionate', 'witty', 'OAS', 'clear', 'overview', 'sport', 'motorcycle', 'racing', 'showing', 'beauty', 'brutality', 'see', 'motocross', 'speedway', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'desert', 'racing', 'superbikes', 'ice', 'racing', 'hill', 'climbing', 'trials', 'riding', 'few', 'things', 'probably', 'forgot.Of', 'course', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'only', 'sport', 'existed', '1970', 'so', 'snapshot', 'time', 'group', 'people', 'nothing', 'less', 'brilliant.When', 'saw', 'was', 'out', 'DVD', 'pounced', 'immediately', 'only', 'quibbles', 'have', 'are', 'opening', 'titles', 'cheesy', ""80's-vintage"", 'video', 'sound', 'narrator', 'voice', 'only', 'left', 'speaker', 'Still', 'considering', 'was', 'not', 'produced', 'dolby', 'surround', 'sound', 'very', 'minor', 'complaint']",On Any Sunday VHS

I had initially been the Account Executive on the Yamaha motorcycle account with two Los Angeles advertising agencies and this is what got me in to racing. I met Malcolm Smith and Steve McQueen once at the Indian Dunes MX track. A friend and I had been play racing when those two got on the track. The blew us away and in a short time were about to lap us. I signaled me friend to get of the track and we waited until they got off. Who are these guys? We went over to meet them and recognized them when they took off their helmets. I was with Yamaha and Harley Davidson for nearly ten years. After my racing days I became an avid street rider and rode across America for the HD 75th Anniversary. Too many other memories to recount here, but if you want to know the way racing was in the 1970's this is the film.
