My views on religion basically agree with a comment Albert Einstein once made when asked for his take on religion. He said, ""I don't believe in fairy tales"". I feel differing views on religion has caused many times the pain, suffering and turmoil in the world compared to what would have existed in the absence of all religions. I believe any all powerful deity worth his salt, if he truly existed, would be capable of convincing all men of his existence. Instead, most religions blame man for his lack of faith, when in fact the blame should go to God for not making his presence clear in the minds of all men. Of course, if there is no God, that couldn't possibly happen (which for the logical thinker, is the situation we've got)!",1,I hated it.,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,832,"['quit', 'watching', '1/3', 'way', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'history', 'religion', 'views', 'religion', 'basically', 'agree', 'comment', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'once', 'made', 'when', 'asked', 'take', 'religion', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'fairy', 'tales', 'feel', 'differing', 'views', 'religion', 'caused', 'many', 'times', 'pain', 'suffering', 'turmoil', 'world', 'compared', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'existed', 'absence', 'religions', 'believe', 'powerful', 'deity', 'salt', 'truly', 'existed', 'would', 'be', 'capable', 'convincing', 'men', 'existence', 'Instead', 'most', 'religions', 'blame', 'man', 'lack', 'faith', 'when', 'fact', 'blame', 'should', 'go', 'God', 'not', 'making', 'presence', 'clear', 'minds', 'men', 'course', 'God', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'happen', 'logical', 'thinker', 'situation', ""'ve"", 'got']",Megiddo II The New Age: Part Two In The Megiddo Series
