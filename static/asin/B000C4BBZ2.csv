I have never heard such detail in any instrument in other bands only rush can use all thier instruments to full effect.  And drums and bass don't take back seat to the gitar riffs.  Niel Joined them in 1975(or sone such before Anthem release) in a begging attemp(so I've heard) by the others who lost thier other drummer from diabetes or something.  Neil was easily put into the captain's chair as Rush was desparate.  He was not only a great drummer but a decent writer of songs and got better around Caress of Steel and 2112, the very epic album in thier career to me personally.  These are his drum only solos but I think some close footage of his drum work in other songs would be nice too.(Anthem is quite odvious as you see a good shot of his aggression using full arm strenght on the cymbols. very good Peart footage there).  Usually in these concerts and ""videos"" you only see his shadow but for the drum solos.  Here you get the lined up collective of solos(minus maybe a few as in ""Broon's Bane, and the '76 All the World concrert).  If you want to see him in action on other songs you get only a few clips of an unsteady cam in ""Exit Stage Right"" and ""A show of Hands"".  this contains also the O'Bastiria from the latest concert.  Neil also has a tutorial but don't even try to buy the collective of his drum set it will cost in excess of half a mill!",5,the main reason for Rush's greatness(though not the only  one).,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1545,"['percussian', 'solos', 'will', 'make', 'ears', 'rattle', 'have', 'good', 'ears', 'can', 'appreicate', 'intricate', 'put', 'togethers', 'cymbols', 'other', 'odd', 'assortments', 'sound', 'drummer', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'such', 'detail', 'instrument', 'other', 'bands', 'only', 'rush', 'can', 'use', 'thier', 'instruments', 'full', 'effect', 'drums', 'bass', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'gitar', 'riffs', 'Niel', 'Joined', '1975', 'sone', 'such', 'Anthem', 'release', 'begging', 'attemp', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'others', 'who', 'lost', 'thier', 'other', 'drummer', 'diabetes', 'something', 'Neil', 'was', 'easily', 'put', 'captain', 'chair', 'Rush', 'was', 'desparate', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'drummer', 'decent', 'writer', 'songs', 'got', 'better', 'Caress', 'Steel', '2112', 'very', 'epic', 'album', 'thier', 'career', 'personally', 'are', 'drum', 'only', 'think', 'close', 'footage', 'drum', 'work', 'other', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'too', 'Anthem', 'quite', 'odvious', 'see', 'good', 'shot', 'aggression', 'using', 'full', 'arm', 'strenght', 'cymbols', 'very', 'good', 'Peart', 'footage', 'there', 'Usually', 'concerts', 'videos', 'only', 'see', 'shadow', 'drum', 'solos', 'Here', 'get', 'lined', 'up', 'collective', 'solos', 'maybe', 'few', 'Broon', 'Bane', ""'76"", 'World', 'concrert', 'want', 'see', 'action', 'other', 'songs', 'get', 'only', 'few', 'clips', 'unsteady', 'cam', 'Exit', 'Stage', 'Right', 'A', 'show', 'Hands', 'also', ""O'Bastiria"", 'latest', 'concert', 'Neil', 'also', 'tutorial', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'buy', 'collective', 'drum', 'set', 'will', 'cost', 'excess', 'mill']",Neil Peart - Anatomy of a Drum Solo

This DVD is boring and looks more like what a kid does in his bedroom when he is just screwing around after school.Peart deserves the credit he gets for performances on albums like Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Exit Stage Left..., Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and those tours. But in my personal opinion the man has nothing left in the tank.I have seen this solo done in various presentations since the Hold Your Fire tour. Nothing changes tour to tour with the exception of the same parts being rearranged.So if you want to spend an afternoon watching a guy warm up and going out of his way to do nothing then this is your dream package. If you want to be inspired by drummers who go out of their way to bring something exciting, new, fresh, and truly goes to the max with his playing...then I suggest you look elsewhere.",2,Tired,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,937,"['Neil', 'Peart', 'tired', 'gave', 'great', 'music', 'influential', 'drumming', 'decades', 'DVD', 'boring', 'more', 'what', 'kid', 'bedroom', 'when', 'just', 'screwing', 'around', 'school.Peart', 'credit', 'performances', 'albums', 'Hemispheres', 'Permanent', 'Waves', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'Exit', 'Stage', 'Left', 'Signals', 'Grace', 'Pressure', 'Power', 'Windows', 'tours', 'personal', 'opinion', 'man', 'nothing', 'left', 'tank.I', 'have', 'seen', 'solo', 'done', 'various', 'presentations', 'Hold', 'Your', 'Fire', 'tour', 'Nothing', 'changes', 'tour', 'tour', 'exception', 'same', 'parts', 'being', 'rearranged.So', 'want', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'watching', 'guy', 'warm', 'up', 'going', 'way', 'do', 'nothing', 'then', 'dream', 'package', 'want', 'be', 'inspired', 'drummers', 'who', 'go', 'way', 'bring', 'something', 'exciting', 'new', 'fresh', 'truly', 'max', 'playing', 'then', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere']",Neil Peart - Anatomy of a Drum Solo

Neil turned all that around for me!  I never realized how much he puts into what you are listening to.  I now listen to his drum solos like I would a piece of classical music.

955149,A12X9NSAZKSOVQ,B000C4BBZ2,Paul Binder,"[11, 15]","Much like spending time with one's best friend, this DVD is equally enjoyable! For the first time, Neil seems to be really comfortable in front of the camera. Everything a Neil Peart fan would want is presented here.As a hobby drummer, a couple of years ago, I sold my drums and gave it up for a while. After watching this DVD, I'm tempted to get another set. The one thing that made an impression on me was that Neil implied that no matter what your skill level, use your inspiration to create your own voice. Thats important to me. I've tried twice to take lessons and learn music, I couldn't do it. Its like I understood, without understanding. I knew how to play, just not what I was playing. Despite that, I've taught myself to play by ear and managed to create my own style. ( After 25yrs ). Even though I'll never be professionally trained, I still have a great love and affection for the drums. Neil was a big reason for that in my life.One highlight was watching ""Subdivisions"" being played from Neil's viewpoint. Thats the one Rush song I really enjoyed playing along to when I had my set. In watching Neil, I was pretty close at mimicking his playing. Not too bad for playing by ear.Finally, on this DVD, Neil mentions other drummers that influenced him. Its really nice to hear him talk about John Bonham of Led Zeppelin. John was my other hero of the drums. John was a completely different drummer, and yet equally inspiring. To hear that Neil was influenced by him and his right foot bass pedal abilities was surprising. Despite learning more humility on the drum kit after watching Neil, I'm grateful for the DVD's insight into one of the greatest drummers of our time.One special mention has to go to the behind the scenes guru's, Paul Northfield and Lorne Wheaton. What a job they do!!!  Thanks,  Paul.",5,Behind the scenes with your hero,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1819,"['Much', 'spending', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'DVD', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'time', 'Neil', 'be', 'really', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'Everything', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'fan', 'would', 'want', 'presented', 'hobby', 'drummer', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'sold', 'drums', 'gave', 'up', 'while', 'watching', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'get', 'set', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'impression', 'was', 'Neil', 'implied', 'matter', 'what', 'skill', 'level', 'use', 'inspiration', 'create', 'own', 'voice', 'Thats', 'important', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'twice', 'take', 'lessons', 'learn', 'music', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'understood', 'understanding', 'knew', 'how', 'play', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'playing', ""'ve"", 'taught', 'play', 'ear', 'managed', 'create', 'own', 'style', '25yrs', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'professionally', 'trained', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'love', 'affection', 'drums', 'Neil', 'was', 'big', 'reason', 'life.One', 'highlight', 'was', 'watching', 'Subdivisions', 'being', 'played', 'Neil', 'viewpoint', 'one', 'Rush', 'song', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'along', 'when', 'had', 'set', 'watching', 'Neil', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'mimicking', 'playing', 'Not', 'too', 'bad', 'playing', 'ear.Finally', 'DVD', 'Neil', 'other', 'drummers', 'influenced', 'really', 'nice', 'hear', 'talk', 'John', 'Bonham', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'John', 'was', 'other', 'hero', 'drums', 'John', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'drummer', 'yet', 'equally', 'inspiring', 'hear', 'Neil', 'was', 'influenced', 'right', 'foot', 'bass', 'pedal', 'abilities', 'was', 'surprising', 'learning', 'more', 'humility', 'drum', 'kit', 'watching', 'Neil', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'DVD', 'insight', 'one', 'greatest', 'drummers', 'time.One', 'special', 'mention', 'go', 'scenes', 'guru', 'Paul', 'Northfield', 'Lorne', 'Wheaton', 'What', 'job', 'do', 'Thanks', 'Paul']",Neil Peart - Anatomy of a Drum Solo
