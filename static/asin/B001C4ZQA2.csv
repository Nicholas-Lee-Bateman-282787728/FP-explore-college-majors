Harris ""Steve Harris""","[0, 0]","The second half of Season 2 of the 2003 Turtle series, and thus far none of the episodes have been lacking in anything, although there's been some filler episodes but what animated action show isn't expected to have at least a couple every now and then.  Season 2, I feel went about taking what Season 1 established and go about taking it a step further.  I have to say that they sure outdid themselves with this season doing things I never thought that they would go about doing for a TMNT show, with having episodes of City at War.  Even going back to something that was brought up in the first season, by helping out some friends they needed to help out from that season.  To top it off the turtles get to take part in something they never competed in before in their lives, but the question is who's going to win that?  Overall it's definitely worth 5 stars out of 5.",5,Another great season,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,871,"['second', 'half', 'Season', '2', '2003', 'Turtle', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'none', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'anything', 'been', 'filler', 'episodes', 'what', 'animated', 'action', 'show', ""n't"", 'expected', 'have', 'least', 'couple', 'now', 'then', 'Season', '2', 'feel', 'went', 'taking', 'what', 'Season', '1', 'established', 'go', 'taking', 'step', 'further', 'have', 'say', 'sure', 'outdid', 'season', 'doing', 'things', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'go', 'doing', 'TMNT', 'show', 'having', 'episodes', 'City', 'War', 'Even', 'going', 'back', 'something', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'helping', 'out', 'friends', 'needed', 'help', 'out', 'season', 'top', 'off', 'turtles', 'get', 'take', 'part', 'something', 'never', 'competed', 'lives', 'question', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'Overall', 'definitely', 'worth', '5', 'stars', '5']","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 2, Part 2"
1174910,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B001C4ZQA2,Simon,"[5, 6]","This 2-disc set collects the remainder of season 2 from the 2003 Ninja Turtles animated series. Note that while the Amazon graphic lists 13 episodes, there are actually 14 on this set and the final packaging has the correct number.Season 2 of TMNT took the Turtles on a wild roller coaster of stories, and the episodes here reflect this. There are gang wars, inter-dimensional tournaments, alien planets, underground civilizations, and more. One of my favourites is the two-parter ""Rogue in the House"" where the Turtles team with a lost Triceraton to take down the Shredder's newest fortress. You also get crossovers with Stan Sakai's ""Usagi Yojimbo"" characters and a loving homage to the golden age DC/Marvel superhero teams.There's definitely enough TMNT for your buck here - a few of the stand-alone stories do feel filler-ish and there's occasionally some story pacing issues (a result of TMNT having its last commercial break so close to the end of each show), but the problems are easily over-looked. Kudos again to another great original cover - can't wait to see what season 3 will look like.One final note: the synopsis on the back cover actually lists the story arc for the beginning of season 3, which is only briefly teased in the last episode on this disc.

I would've thought that since Nickelodeon now owns the Ninja Turtles franchise, Nickelodeon would also stock up on those old episodes of the 2003 series and the 1980's series.Besides that, I know that many people are trying to see if this is a great series to watch, and in my opinion, it is the only TV show that 4Kids channel did right, for once. TMNT 2003 series holds a darker tone and takes its audience seriously, unlike their previous shows. It has a lot of action, mythical elements, aliens, ninjas, samurais, dragons, Triceratons, time travel, and alternate dimension travel. Another thing that this show hits is its' character development, story arc, and maturity level. It definitely raised the bar to how serious the creators are taking the audience and the fact that it doesn't even apologize for being so dark and sophisticated, just like Batman the Animated Series.I have very few problems with the show and if you do have money and/or time on your hands, go ahead, check it out, and find out for yourself.",5,A Great Series That Needs to be Rereleased onto DVD/Blu-ray.,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,1184,"['love', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'Turtles', 'fan', 'can', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'price', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'ridiculiously', 'high', 'very', 'little', 'DVD', 'sets', 'episodes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Nickelodeon', 'now', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'franchise', 'Nickelodeon', 'would', 'also', 'stock', 'up', 'old', 'episodes', '2003', 'series', '1980', 'series.Besides', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'see', 'great', 'series', 'watch', 'opinion', 'only', 'TV', 'show', '4Kids', 'channel', 'did', 'right', 'once', 'TMNT', '2003', 'series', 'darker', 'tone', 'audience', 'seriously', 'previous', 'shows', 'lot', 'action', 'mythical', 'elements', 'aliens', 'ninjas', 'samurais', 'dragons', 'Triceratons', 'time', 'travel', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'travel', 'thing', 'show', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'arc', 'maturity', 'level', 'definitely', 'raised', 'bar', 'how', 'serious', 'creators', 'are', 'taking', 'audience', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'apologize', 'being', 'so', 'dark', 'sophisticated', 'just', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series.I', 'have', 'very', 'few', 'problems', 'show', 'do', 'have', 'money', 'and/or', 'time', 'hands', 'go', 'ahead', 'check', 'out', 'find', 'out']","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 2, Part 2"
