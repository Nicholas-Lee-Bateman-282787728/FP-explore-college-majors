What's up with that? You can pre-order purchase in March 2013 ALL 3 SEASONS TOGETHER from an Amazon competitor for $51.98! Guess one should no longer purchase the separate seasons anymore and just wait around & hope the whole series is released? Look at what the single previous seasons are now selling for!! If you just can not be patient, do yourself a favor & be sure you shop around and price check as there are better prices at some of Amazons competitors. Guess I will just be patient & hope I can pick this up down the road.These studios and merchants are insulting their most loyal followers who wanted to make sure they were able to collect each season of favorite old shows. If no one bought the single seasons the studios probably wouldn't bother to put the rest of the seasons out since they would feel there wasn't a profitable interest in the series so can not understand why their loyal customers are charged more?

I was very disturbed when I received this set and discovered that the front cover plastic was badly wrinkled and crimped.  I assume this was caused by the excessive heat they use when they melt the shrink wrap on the box.  It appears to be melted and just looks terrible in my opinion.  This type of DVD case has been around for years now and I really think this issue should have been resolved by now.  CBSs' MSRP for this DVD set is nearly $60! (which I think is just ridiculous).  For that price I think a factory defect like this is just simply a slap in the face to consumers.  I could maybe accept it if I found this on Wal-Mart's $5 rack. Fortunately I got my set for much less by purchasing all 3 sets on Amazon together for $35.  I already own the first 2 sets but should be able to sell the new ones for around $20 making the price of this set comparable to what I paid for the other 2.,2,"Great show, cheap packaging",1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,997,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'solely', 'based', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'watched', 'yet', 'was', 'very', 'disturbed', 'when', 'received', 'set', 'discovered', 'front', 'cover', 'plastic', 'was', 'badly', 'wrinkled', 'crimped', 'assume', 'was', 'caused', 'excessive', 'heat', 'use', 'when', 'melt', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'box', 'be', 'melted', 'just', 'terrible', 'opinion', 'type', 'DVD', 'case', 'been', 'years', 'now', 'really', 'think', 'issue', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'now', 'CBSs', 'MSRP', 'DVD', 'set', 'nearly', '60', 'think', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'price', 'think', 'factory', 'defect', 'just', 'simply', 'slap', 'face', 'consumers', 'could', 'maybe', 'accept', 'found', 'Wal-Mart', '5', 'rack', 'Fortunately', 'got', 'set', 'much', 'less', 'purchasing', '3', 'sets', 'Amazon', 'together', '35', 'already', 'own', 'first', '2', 'sets', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'new', 'ones', '20', 'making', 'price', 'set', 'comparable', 'what', 'paid', 'other', '2']",Father Dowling Mysteries: The Third and Final Season
