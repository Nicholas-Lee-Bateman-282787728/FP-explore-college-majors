1167319,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001AQR3LC,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","England, 1536. Anne Boleyn has been executed and King Henry VIII has married Jane Seymour. Henry is incredibly happy with his new wife, who soon bears him his much-longed-for son. However, Jane is also keen for Henry to reconcile with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and Henry is concerned that Jane is meddling in affairs beyond her interest. Such matters become less important when the north of England rises in rebellion against the crown, furious with the dissolution of the monasteries and what they see as the corruption of the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell.The third season of The Tudors covers the period running from 1536 and the immediate aftermath of the execution of Anne Boleyn, to 1540 and the king taking Catherine Howard as a mistress. In terms of wives, it's the busiest of the four seasons as it has to get through three of them whilst also addressing the popular rebellion known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the downfall of Thomas Cromwell, the rise to prominence of the Seymour family (who would retain some power even beyond Henry's death) and the religious opposition of Cardinal Reginald Pole, who stirs up opposition to Henry VIII in Europe. Furthermore, it only has eight episodes to do all this in (as opposed to the ten apiece of the other seasons). They even fit in a somewhat bizarre episode in which Henry has a mini-breakdown and works through it with the help of his fool (a great performance by David Bradley).The third season is therefore quite impressive in that it manages to pack all of these storylines into a very short space of time and explore them quite thoroughly without feeling rushed. It's a fairly dynamic season, complete with more action-adventure subplots as the would-be assassin Sir Francis Bryan chases Reginald Pole across Europe and as the Pilgrimage of Grace marches across England with Charles Brandon leading an army against them.The performances range from the excellent to the okay. James Frain's Thomas Cromwell is probably the season highlight as he loses control, but Henry Cavill improves yet more as Brandon is ravaged by guilt over the deaths he causes. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, again, is fairly neutral in his performance, but there's a nice turn from singer Joss Stone as Anne of Cleeves. Giving an unproven actress a tricky role with a German accent was quite a challenge, but she handles it reasonably well. The season also benefits from Sarah Bolger coming more to the fore as Mary Tudor, a difficult character to get right. Mary was a woman of principal and authority, but one who became increasingly ruthless when she herself became queen, and Bolger combines those traits quite well. Unfortunately, the loss of Natalie Dormer's Anne Boleyn is more keenly felt, with Annabelle Wallis's Jane Seymour being rather unmemorable in comparison, despite an odd attempt to draw parallels between her and Diana, Princess of Wales.The season is also let down a little by the arrival of Catherine Howard at the end of the season. Though Tamzin Merchant (probably better known for almost being Daenerys in Game of Thrones, playing the role in the unaired pilot and later being replaced by Emilia Clarke for reasons that have never been divulged) does a good job with the material, the writing never really explains why Henry would fall for such a flighty creature. That has to wait until Season 4, when the suggestion that Henry is having what we'd now term a mid-life crisis is better-explored.Season 4 of The Tudors (***) maintains the show's run of being watchable, entertaining, historically interesting (though not hugely accurate), slightly trashy but lacking in depth.",4,A busy and fun season,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,3643,"['England', '1536', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'been', 'executed', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'married', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Henry', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'new', 'wife', 'who', 'soon', 'much-longed-for', 'son', 'However', 'Jane', 'also', 'keen', 'Henry', 'reconcile', 'daughters', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Henry', 'concerned', 'Jane', 'meddling', 'affairs', 'interest', 'Such', 'matters', 'become', 'less', 'important', 'when', 'north', 'England', 'rises', 'rebellion', 'crown', 'furious', 'dissolution', 'monasteries', 'what', 'see', 'corruption', 'king', 'chief', 'minister', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell.The', 'third', 'season', 'Tudors', 'period', 'running', '1536', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'execution', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', '1540', 'king', 'taking', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'mistress', 'terms', 'wives', 'busiest', 'four', 'seasons', 'get', 'three', 'whilst', 'also', 'addressing', 'popular', 'rebellion', 'known', 'Pilgrimage', 'Grace', 'downfall', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'rise', 'prominence', 'Seymour', 'family', 'who', 'would', 'retain', 'power', 'even', 'Henry', 'death', 'religious', 'opposition', 'Cardinal', 'Reginald', 'Pole', 'who', 'up', 'opposition', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Europe', 'Furthermore', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'do', 'opposed', 'ten', 'apiece', 'other', 'seasons', 'even', 'fit', 'somewhat', 'bizarre', 'episode', 'Henry', 'mini-breakdown', 'help', 'fool', 'great', 'performance', 'David', 'Bradley', '.The', 'third', 'season', 'therefore', 'quite', 'impressive', 'pack', 'storylines', 'very', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'explore', 'quite', 'thoroughly', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'fairly', 'dynamic', 'season', 'complete', 'more', 'action-adventure', 'subplots', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Bryan', 'Reginald', 'Pole', 'Europe', 'Pilgrimage', 'Grace', 'marches', 'England', 'Charles', 'Brandon', 'leading', 'army', 'them.The', 'performances', 'range', 'excellent', 'okay', 'James', 'Frain', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'probably', 'season', 'highlight', 'control', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'yet', 'more', 'Brandon', 'ravaged', 'guilt', 'deaths', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'again', 'fairly', 'neutral', 'performance', 'nice', 'turn', 'singer', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'Anne', 'Cleeves', 'Giving', 'unproven', 'actress', 'tricky', 'role', 'German', 'accent', 'was', 'quite', 'challenge', 'reasonably', 'well', 'season', 'also', 'benefits', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'coming', 'more', 'fore', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'difficult', 'character', 'get', 'right', 'Mary', 'was', 'woman', 'principal', 'authority', 'one', 'who', 'became', 'increasingly', 'ruthless', 'when', 'became', 'queen', 'Bolger', 'combines', 'traits', 'quite', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'loss', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'more', 'keenly', 'felt', 'Annabelle', 'Wallis', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'being', 'rather', 'unmemorable', 'comparison', 'odd', 'attempt', 'draw', 'parallels', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales.The', 'season', 'also', 'let', 'down', 'little', 'arrival', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'end', 'season', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'almost', 'being', 'Daenerys', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'playing', 'role', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'later', 'being', 'replaced', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'reasons', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'divulged', 'good', 'job', 'material', 'writing', 'never', 'really', 'why', 'Henry', 'would', 'fall', 'such', 'flighty', 'creature', 'wait', 'Season', '4', 'when', 'suggestion', 'Henry', 'having', 'what', ""'d"", 'now', 'term', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'better-explored.Season', '4', 'Tudors', '***', 'show', 'run', 'being', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'historically', 'interesting', 'not', 'hugely', 'accurate', 'slightly', 'trashy', 'lacking', 'depth']",The Tudors: Season 3

I say short, because it is the shortest season yet with 8 episodes instead of the 10 episode seasons 1 & 2. I kept waiting for the last 2, until I finally accepted the fact that they ended the season with the dubious introduction of Katherine Howard.In season 3 you begin to more fully see the transition of Henry from an energetic youth of passion and intellectual promise to an irritable tyrant. His ego, always his greatest obstacle, becomes more pronounced as he dismisses Anne of Cleaves as looking 'like a horse' and refuses to fully recognize her as his queen, ultimately dissolving the marriage. His leg injury continues to grow more septic, lending to his lack of athleticism and irritability, and with Thomas Moore dead he has no one close to him to temper his passions. Cromwell's fall from favor is rapid and severe, largely due to his self-interested advocation of Anne of Cleaves.The Tudors is , first and foremost, good entertainment, and should not be embraced as historically accurate (a common criticism that I've seen). It paints the history of Henry VIII with broad strokes, capturing the spirit of the events with dramatic license.

1167348,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B001AQR3LC,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[100, 113]","*This review is based upon the series as shown on cable network Showtime*After the superlative season 2 of 'The Tudors' (which featured outstanding, Emmy-worthy performances by Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More), I was completely prepared for a ""letdown"" of sorts for series 3. After all, the true story (Henry VIII's marriage to Jane Seymour, birth of Prince Edward, death of Queen Jane and marriage to Anne of Cleves 2 years after that) goes at a relatively quick 4 years in English history. I was UNprepared for the economic downturn and PeaceArch's (the production company of 'The Tudors') decision to only have 8 episodes for 2009. If you thought seasons 1-2 were a whirlwind, prepare to be whip lashed by season 3.Queen Jane's (Annabelle Wallis-in a replacement role from season 2's Anita Briem) relationship with Henry is so chaste and ""pure,"" and he swears she is his most ""beloved"" queen (which he also claimed toward Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn). Unfortunately, Queen Jane dies of peripureal fever after giving birth to Prince Edward. Wallis's acting is measured-so measured in fact, you almost forget she is in the scene. She blends too well-unlike the performance given by Anne Stallybrass in the PBS production of 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII,' who captured the proper spirit of meekness and servitude necessary to BECOME Henry's 3rd wife.Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves is a treat-although she is not featured enough in the series. Her scenes are few and far between, but she makes a fantastic impact (witness her scene with Lord Privy Seal Cromwell). There is a passion and fervor in her acting that is nothing but natural ability and talent. I look forward to seeing her more and hopefully she will be back in a guest starring role in season 4.The gentlemen actors do acquit themselves beautifully. James Frain has been a purposeful, manipulative, charming and insecure Thomas Cromwell. His fall from grace is swift, merciless and ultimately degrading (spoiler-his execution is the MOST brutal and vindictive of any on 'The Tudors'). Henry Cavill is glossing into a solid actor-although the aging process for his Duke of Suffolk is not believable (he looks as though he is in his late 20's still-although the actor is only in his mid-20's). I have a complaint about Sir Francis Bryan though. Alan Von Sprang's portrayal is too lascivious, too voluptuous and thusly, mildly irritating. One can only hope he will not feature prominently for season 4.Ultimately this season belongs and is owned by the king himself. I am continually amazed at the transformation Jonathan Rhys Meyers takes on as Henry VIII. Episode 5 (directly after Queen Jane's death) shows Henry and his Fool, Will Somers, locked in his chambers, drinking and reminiscing. The heartache, devastation and to some degree, hopelessness felt by Henry is palpable. This actor takes risks, doesn't hesitate to muck it up and make emotional vulnerability ""ugly."" Season 4 will end with his death, but Rhys Meyers has put his stamp on Henry VIII.I have purposely not mentioned Katherine Howard (Tamzyn Merchant) because her story will be told in depth in season 4 (plus the portrayal was atrocious in the 3/4 of an episode she was in). This season was unsatisfying because it was too rushed, too condensed, too compacted. We can only pray for a return to the strength shown in season 2 for series 4.

Once again it ends with a dramatic beheading of a key figure (as frequently happened in the real Tudor times), and we have a continuation of the queen-for-a-day motif for which Henry VIII was so well known.Jane Seymour, played well but not excitingly by Anita Briem, is a continuation of the character by a new actress from season two.  However, in terms of the plot (and the actual history), she doesn't last as long nor does she have the same spark as the now-absent Anne Boleyn.  The intrigues of the Seymours are not as gripping as those of the Boleyns, and the main political figure, Cromwell (played by James Frain) doesn't cut the same figure as either  Wolsey (Sam Neil) or Thomas More (Jeremy Northam).  There feels like there's too much arcane politicking in his downfall for it to be truly exciting.  The introduction of the figure of Pole (premature and out of place politically) seems almost pointless, alas.Jonathan Rhys Meyers continues to do a great job as Henry, and Henry Cavill as Brandon turns in a servicable performance, but one feels that the writing is letting the Brandon side down.  At one point Brandon remarks to Henry that they have both lost their youth, and there is that sense about the series as whole to me.  It is still good, but it is no longer remarkable and new.The brief marriage (historically speaking) to Anne of Cleaves was dealt with very quickly in the story lines as well.  We barely get to see Anne (played by Joss Stone) before she is pensioned off, an unconsummated match (and one can't really understand why the lusty Henry wouldn't find Joss Stone alluring).There are a few DVD extras, including episodes to another show (United States of Tara -- not quite The Tudors), and a few interviews and timeline features.

Unfortunately things aren't much helped by the casting of the inexpressive Annabel Wallis as Jane Seymour, the third of Henry's wives, or by the addition of a new important character by Alan von Sprang, named after--and only extremely loosely based on--Sir Francis Bryan, here conceived as a kind of studly head thug in the king's service who brutally chases down his enemies and couples with various court wenches in palace alcoves. The suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace doesn't create much narrative interest, either, nor does the persecution of the family of Cardinal Pole (mostly we see lots of suffering people being executing in multiple creative ways with little explanation as to why, say, one should be sodomized with a red-hot poker, or why another should be hanged from a castle's walls wearing heavy chains). Frankly, I wouldn't have stuck around had I not been waiting to see how the Anne of Cleves marriage would be handled, but when Joss Stone enters as that German princess, everything comes to life again because of her great dignity as the awkward and poignant ""Flanders mare"" whom Henry rejects for not being attractive enough. Stone and Sarah Bolger, as the complex and careful Princess Mary, are the only two actors who deserve any honors for their performances: we can be grateful they will figure importantly into the fourth and final season of this series. (On the other hand, we have much to dread given the already annoying performance of the simpering Tamzin Merchant, who plays Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard, as if she were playing Nomi Malone in SHOWGIRLS.) The series suffers more gravely than ever by this season from the producers' ghastly decision to envision the Tudor court as motivated entirely by lusts for sex and power (in that order), and Rhys Meyer is pretty much a complete embarrassment by this point. When his Henry VIII confers with his bishops as to the central tenets of Anglican doctrine, or designs Nonesuch Palace while sequestered after the death of Jane Seymour, it's simply unbelievable. By this point we're pretty much just ticking off the wives one by one until they're all gone; one wonders whether the producers will finally have the common sense to make Henry VIII obese and old by the final season (there are many displays here even still of Rhys Meyer's perfect sixpack).",3,"Four wives down, two to go",1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,2801,"['Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'dead', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'THE', 'TUDORS', 'best', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'series', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'are', 'gone', 'unable', 'help', 'awesomely', 'miscast', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyer', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'pretty', 'dismally', 'start', 'third', 'season', 'THE', 'TUDORS', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'helped', 'casting', 'inexpressive', 'Annabel', 'Wallis', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'third', 'Henry', 'wives', 'addition', 'new', 'important', 'character', 'Alan', 'von', 'Sprang', 'named', 'only', 'extremely', 'loosely', 'based', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Bryan', 'here', 'conceived', 'kind', 'studly', 'head', 'thug', 'king', 'service', 'who', 'brutally', 'down', 'enemies', 'couples', 'various', 'court', 'wenches', 'palace', 'alcoves', 'suppression', 'Pilgrimage', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'create', 'much', 'narrative', 'interest', 'either', 'persecution', 'family', 'Cardinal', 'Pole', 'mostly', 'see', 'lots', 'suffering', 'people', 'being', 'executing', 'multiple', 'creative', 'ways', 'little', 'explanation', 'why', 'say', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'sodomized', 'red-hot', 'poker', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'hanged', 'castle', 'walls', 'wearing', 'heavy', 'chains', 'Frankly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'stuck', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'marriage', 'would', 'be', 'handled', 'when', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'enters', 'German', 'princess', 'everything', 'life', 'again', 'great', 'dignity', 'awkward', 'poignant', 'Flanders', 'mare', 'whom', 'Henry', 'rejects', 'not', 'being', 'attractive', 'enough', 'Stone', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'complex', 'careful', 'Princess', 'Mary', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'deserve', 'honors', 'performances', 'can', 'be', 'grateful', 'will', 'figure', 'importantly', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'series', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'much', 'dread', 'given', 'already', 'annoying', 'performance', 'simpering', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'who', 'Henry', 'fifth', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'were', 'playing', 'Nomi', 'Malone', 'SHOWGIRLS', 'series', 'more', 'gravely', 'ever', 'season', 'producers', 'ghastly', 'decision', 'envision', 'Tudor', 'court', 'motivated', 'entirely', 'lusts', 'sex', 'power', 'order', 'Rhys', 'Meyer', 'pretty', 'much', 'complete', 'embarrassment', 'point', 'When', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'confers', 'bishops', 'central', 'tenets', 'Anglican', 'doctrine', 'designs', 'Nonesuch', 'Palace', 'sequestered', 'death', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'simply', 'unbelievable', 'point', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'ticking', 'off', 'wives', 'one', 'one', ""'re"", 'gone', 'one', 'producers', 'will', 'finally', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'make', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'obese', 'old', 'final', 'season', 'are', 'many', 'displays', 'here', 'even', 'still', 'Rhys', 'Meyer', 'perfect', 'sixpack']",The Tudors: Season 3

Acting, set, costumes, script (more often than not), all of the highest quality. Ok, watching some Brit monarch running around yelling ""I am the King of England"" or ""I Am the Queen of England"" gets a bit fraying on the nerves, but one can a least tolerate it when it's part of a dramatic whole.One thing I liked about Seasons 1 & 2 is the slant it gives to the main female characters. Princess Mary, usually depicted by British history as inherently sinister, is given a less propagandized role in this movie. She is more balanced, even attractive. Another case of this approach is seen in the character of Queen Jane. History usually paints her as a kind-hearted simpleton. Again, not in this flix. Not only is the actress who plays Jane ravishingly blonde & beautiful, her acts of charity in trying to reconcile Henry to his 2 daughters are based as much on a thoughtful, diplomatic overview then a simple, kindly nature. Little Princess Elizabeth is adorableAll good stuff, right? So what went wrong?The elements of physical torture & sexual manipulation that were more or less intrinsic to the storyline, become increasing cruel & even grotesque in Season 3. This could be overlooked but for one simple fact: Like movie stars in old Hollywood, romantic, historic characters (especially women) were not allowed to appear to age from teen to middle age. This is how Jonathan Rhys Meyers is presented. Oh, he's a little rough around the edges in Season 3, but he doesn't essential age, not his face, not his character. In short, he is completely out of his depth.There is a totally ridiculous scene thrown in where the bitter, aging Henry is approaching madness (in part probably physically caused by disease) and has a sort of artsy-fartsy dialogue with his ""Fool."" Where the hell did this ""Fool"" come from? Not from any preceeding scene in the series. The actor who plays the Fool is a veteran of British drama, but for all his technique he cannot do anything but appear completely out of context. It is an embarrassing & unnecessary interludeWell, enough said--but my last remark is this: Look at the cover art of each program. From 1-2 to 3 is a descent from class to sleaze.

McQueen ""Anti-Charisma""","[6, 7]","While the first two seasons presented King Henry VIII as a young, hedonistic king, Season 3 gives viewers a unique opportunity to consider, historically, what may have been if he had been a less capricious and more morally serious and intellectually-principled statesman.What sort of king could Henry VIII have been if the gentle, tolerant and politically savvy Jane Seymour had remained long enough to exert substantive influence on her husband? Perhaps he would have been compared to a middle-age Solomon as opposed to a Dionysian - ""Neroesque"" figure.What would have happened if the King hadn't eventually turned on his trusted advisor, Thomas Cromwell (and ultimately engineered his economic and political destruction)? Conversely, what would have happened if Henry had rid of himself of Cromwell sooner? Would there still have been an uprising against the king? Would the bloodshed that resulted from those uprising been averted?For those of you who have watched Seasons 1 and 2, it is interesting to contrast Cromwell's gradual and humiliating fall from grace with the swift, cool and profoundly dignified dismantling of his intellectual, philosophical and political rival, Sir Thomas More.Jane Seymour and Thomas Cromwell are presented in the season 3 as Henry VIII's super ego (his always self-conscious angels) and id (the demons which seems to grow ever stronger as the King's youthful vitality slips away).King Henry's story is quickly coming to a close. Cumulatively, the King had six wives. The fourth and fifth wives of the King are introduced in this season--- there is Anne of Cleves who makes a brief and powerful impression on the viewer (she is essentially the Protestant version of Catherine of Aragon -- which may explain the King's visceral reaction to her) and Katherine Howard, who is presented as such a cipher that she makes virtually no impression at all.I am extremely impressed with this series. Even those who are not well-versed in history know what transpired during the Tudors' reign. But this show somehow manages to maintain a fresh perspective on said events.Season 3 is a must-see.",4,The Dubious Choices of an Amoral King,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2118,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'presented', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'young', 'hedonistic', 'king', 'Season', '3', 'viewers', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'consider', 'historically', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'less', 'capricious', 'more', 'morally', 'serious', 'intellectually-principled', 'statesman.What', 'sort', 'king', 'could', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'have', 'been', 'gentle', 'tolerant', 'politically', 'savvy', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'had', 'remained', 'long', 'enough', 'exert', 'substantive', 'influence', 'husband', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'compared', 'middle-age', 'Solomon', 'opposed', 'Dionysian', 'Neroesque', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'King', 'had', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'turned', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'ultimately', 'engineered', 'economic', 'political', 'destruction', 'Conversely', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Henry', 'had', 'rid', 'Cromwell', 'sooner', 'Would', 'there', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'uprising', 'king', 'Would', 'bloodshed', 'resulted', 'uprising', 'been', 'averted', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Cromwell', 'gradual', 'humiliating', 'fall', 'grace', 'swift', 'cool', 'profoundly', 'dignified', 'dismantling', 'intellectual', 'philosophical', 'political', 'rival', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More.Jane', 'Seymour', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'are', 'presented', 'season', '3', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'super', 'ego', 'always', 'self-conscious', 'angels', 'id', 'demons', 'grow', 'ever', 'stronger', 'King', 'youthful', 'vitality', 'away', '.King', 'Henry', 'story', 'quickly', 'coming', 'close', 'Cumulatively', 'King', 'had', 'six', 'wives', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'wives', 'King', 'are', 'introduced', 'season', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'who', 'brief', 'powerful', 'impression', 'viewer', 'essentially', 'Protestant', 'version', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'may', 'explain', 'King', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'who', 'presented', 'such', 'cipher', 'virtually', 'impression', 'all.I', 'am', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'series', 'Even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'well-versed', 'history', 'know', 'what', 'transpired', 'Tudors', 'reign', 'show', 'somehow', 'maintain', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'said', 'events.Season', '3', 'must-see']",The Tudors: Season 3

It was as if the makers of the series were too self conscious about the show and how it would be received.  By the third season and the death of Anne, the show really gets going.  There are no expectations on how the subject is to be covered and in past shows and movies, the story of Henry VIII becomes dull as if nothing happened to him after Anne's death.  Somehow this series hits the bar in making the Jane Seymour story much more moving than I have seen before, is able to cover the time when he was in mourning and make the brief marriage to Anne of Cleaves very interesting.  This is the season where I went from liking the show to loving it.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers does an excellent job as Henry VIII and the women who portray his wives are wonderful.

He thinks if he screams and sprays spittle one minute and then gets in someone's face and whispers the next, we might actually think he's passionate.  His acting is calculated and takes me out of the story and into his caricature of Henry VIII.The actress who plays Jane Seymour, Annabelle Wallis, is so wooden that she doesn't even appear real.  She tried to act queenly and instead she gave the impression that she was auditioning for a high school play.  Anita Briem did a much better job in Season 2.  Even in Wallis' childbirth scene, they dubbed in Natalie Dormer's cries from HER childbirth scene.  Pathetic.  There was no chemistry whatsoever between JRM and Wallis.  Dormer made JRM look good and his poor acting was overlooked solely b/c of her.Both the men and women have been stunningly attractive throughout all three seasons and yet, judging from artists' rendering, they were anything BUT attractive in reality.  Of course, we want to be swept up in the romance of the era but to have JRM shriek ""She looks like a horse"" about his wife Anne of Cleves is ridiculous when someone as pretty as Joss Stone is playing the part.The focus on fictional characters such as Lady Misseldon is also objectionable.  Why spend so much time on them when there is so much history that could have been covered?  The actress portraying the part also made her appear cocky, especially when entering a room and yet we know that women were to keep their eyes lowered and assume a subservient manner especially when dealing w/royalty.James Frain is the only worthwhile character in this season, although he, too, was made to evoke our sympathy for Thomas Cromwell in the end but given his participation in the execution of so many, it would be difficult to feel anything but revulsion for him.  Still, Frain's acting was solid throughout all three seasons.  His execution scene was over done.  The axe man was hung over and chopped away at Cromwell until someone took the axe away from him and finished the job.  In reality, the axe man was an axe ""boy"", a young boy who had to swing the axe three times.  It's the unnecessary exaggeration and gore that adds to the unlikeability of Season 3.  I'll watch Season 4 only because I want to see how Michael Hirst butchers history and panders to JRM's ridiculous acting.  Maybe if JRM had worn some padding to indicate the tremendous weight gain that Henry experienced it would help but his acting isn't strong enough to make us forget history.  Can't wait to see Henry VIII get his but given how history has been treated throughout all three seasons, it's doubtful it will be accurate.  No matter that it's ""historical fiction"".  It's more fiction than history.",1,The quality is lacking in acting and storyline,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,2822,"['Season', '3', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'JRM', ""n't"", 'much', 'actor', 'anyhow', 'so-called', 'transformation', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'laughable', 'spittle', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'someone', 'face', 'next', 'might', 'actually', 'think', 'passionate', 'acting', 'calculated', 'story', 'caricature', 'Henry', 'VIII.The', 'actress', 'who', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Annabelle', 'Wallis', 'so', 'wooden', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'real', 'tried', 'act', 'queenly', 'instead', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'auditioning', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Season', '2', 'Even', 'Wallis', 'childbirth', 'scene', 'dubbed', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'cries', 'HER', 'childbirth', 'scene', 'Pathetic', 'was', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'JRM', 'Wallis', 'Dormer', 'made', 'JRM', 'look', 'good', 'poor', 'acting', 'was', 'overlooked', 'solely', 'b/c', 'men', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'three', 'seasons', 'yet', 'judging', 'artists', 'rendering', 'were', 'anything', 'BUT', 'attractive', 'reality', 'course', 'want', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'romance', 'era', 'have', 'JRM', 'shriek', 'horse', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'someone', 'as', 'pretty', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'playing', 'part.The', 'focus', 'fictional', 'characters', 'such', 'Lady', 'Misseldon', 'also', 'objectionable', 'Why', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'actress', 'portraying', 'part', 'also', 'made', 'appear', 'cocky', 'especially', 'when', 'entering', 'room', 'yet', 'know', 'women', 'were', 'keep', 'eyes', 'lowered', 'assume', 'subservient', 'manner', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'w/royalty.James', 'Frain', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'character', 'season', 'too', 'was', 'made', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'end', 'given', 'participation', 'execution', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'feel', 'anything', 'revulsion', 'Still', 'Frain', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'three', 'seasons', 'execution', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'axe', 'man', 'was', 'hung', 'chopped', 'away', 'Cromwell', 'someone', 'took', 'axe', 'away', 'finished', 'job', 'reality', 'axe', 'man', 'was', 'axe', 'boy', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'swing', 'axe', 'three', 'times', 'unnecessary', 'exaggeration', 'gore', 'unlikeability', 'Season', '3', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Season', '4', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'Michael', 'Hirst', 'butchers', 'history', 'panders', 'JRM', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'Maybe', 'JRM', 'had', 'worn', 'padding', 'indicate', 'tremendous', 'weight', 'gain', 'Henry', 'experienced', 'would', 'help', 'acting', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'history', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'get', 'given', 'how', 'history', 'been', 'treated', 'three', 'seasons', 'doubtful', 'will', 'be', 'accurate', 'matter', 'historical', 'fiction', 'more', 'fiction', 'history']",The Tudors: Season 3

In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives his best performances ever as King Henry VIII. (Warning: the next few paragraphs contain details that some people may consider spoilerish, but seeing as how this is a retelling of British history, I'm sure most people know what's going to happen this season.)At the start of Season Three, Henry is married to Jane Seymour, a gentle woman who thrills her husband by giving him a son. Unfortunately, Jane's reign as Queen of England is short-lived, and Henry soon finds himself mourning the only one of his wives thus far who he has truly loved (or at least been able to appreciate at the very end). The impertinent Thomas Cromwell then convinces Henry that a new marriage to Anne of Cleaves would benefit the country. Henry reluctantly goes through with the marriage, but never consummates the union because, according to him, his new bride ""looks like a horse."" It doesn't take long for Henry to tire of this marriage as well, and he passes the time in the company of the ditzy young Katherine Howard.As all these romantic entanglements are taking place, England is threatened by rebels, Princess Mary becomes even more disenchanted with her unfortunate circumstances at court, and Thomas Cromwell becomes less and less popular, as members of the court desperately try to find a way to bring him down.Overall, this was a fast-paced and entertaining season. I still miss the Anne Boleyn years, but ""The Tudors"" has managed to stay fresh and engaging. I don't see how this show can go on for more than another season, unless it continues after Henry's death, which would be a very interesting twist.

However following the death of Jane Seymour (a decent queen by any standards) henry began to deteriorate in body as well in mind. Gone was the most handsome prince of europe, a giant of a man who stood 6.5 feet when the average man was 5.2! HE was A true renaissance man who was willing to promote commoners for the good of the kingdom. he could be ruthless and kill people : but until his last seven years he can be said to be no worse than any other prince of his day as far as the average citizen was concerned. in fact he served his better than most,  but by the time of this series he was on his way to becoming the rotting mugwarp monster. so by the time of 1540 and of anne of cleaves  he was  obese and this just the beginning. his last seven years were even worse. This is the next series and hopefully they will allow the main actor to protray that moral and physical decay.Henry's last five years or so were when he was a huge rotting man.  He was in agony and the people called him the mugwarp and everyone lived in terror around him.  This series however is the start of that process, his wound on his leg hasn't spread into a huge painful rotting mess that could be smelled far away from him yet.  however it's already reaking havoc on him and causing him pain.  This series is less about a great king but instead about the kings beginning slide into the monster mugwarp he would become.  His slaughter of the northern rebels is vengeful but standard for any kingdom of that century still the younger Henry wasn't as bloddthirsty and would have settle with a smaller number of dead.

Buffington,"[0, 0]","As I mentioned in my review of The Tudors Second Season, I am an American who knew virtually nothing about the reign of King Henry VIII before I watched this series.  I think it is safe to say that from an American perspective, we Americans can thank our Founding Fathers for making a clean break from the institution of monarchy and founding, instead, a form of government the prime directive of which is the will and welfare of the people.  Lest I be accused of jingoism, Britain too, found its way, a slightly different way, towards this goal by later establishing the supremacy of Parliament as sovereign, at the expense of the monarchy.  In the twentieth century, when the mutual affections of our two peoples was reestablished, it is safe to say that this was facilitated by both countries having rejected monarchism, albeit in different ways.  The value of ""The Tudors"" is that it really does show the viewer why monarchy as a system of government was ultimately shown to be unsatisfactory.  King Henry is shown in this series, as he has been judged in real life, to have been a self-indulgent and selfish ruler who was indifferent to the welfare of his subjects.King Henry VIII is shown in Season Three in his full maturation as an arbitrary and unreasonable tyrant.  He quashes his subjects' rebellion with a complete disregard for justice or compromise, and the strange conventions of European monarchy make it difficulty for the King to establish a dynasty, threatening governmental instability and lack of continuity.  King Henry himself is impossible to please or serve.  A great line from the series which is quite true is that ""King Henry never makes a man without then unmaking him.""  All of the King's intimates seem to come to an arbitrary bad ending.I have to say that the King's German wife seemed fine to me!  Perhaps the makers of this superb series simply could not find it within themselves to cast a homely actress for the part!  A minor nit, I freely admit.This series is great fun and I have enjoyed every second of it!  This is addicting and grand entertainment.  Highly recommended.

So I continued, but after Anne Boleyn's death, Henry really never seemed happy. He was partially happy and looked happy with Jane Seymour, but that spark he had never revived after Anne. Anne was his true love, but because of his injury to his head from the joust, he really lost control and was losing his ability to rule just, like he used to do. He would have stayed with Anne, but again, he could not. The story continues as Jane ends up dying after child birth and after giving him a son, and it shows him losing control. It shows that it is because of Jane, but I think with the death of Jane, it triggered his mourning for Anne, as Anne had been strong in child birth, and would have continued to be strong, but he hurt his chances.

Certainly there are some weaknesses as noted by the other reviewers. Regardless, season 3 was totally fascinating and so well done on so many levels.Not only does the writing tell the story beautifully, it reveals the complex personalities, relationships and motives of the main players. The movie also explores the religious battles and changes that were happening at that time. This was amazing to see, especially in light of the fact that what happened then still impacts Christians today. This was facinating! It also explores how the King's lust and love life impacted world politics, which of course had long lasting effects.The majority of the acting was outstanding. Of course Jonathan Rhys Meyers is amazing as King Henry, and so believable. He is clearly, utterly commited to the role. James Frain as Lord Cromwell was fantastic. He's a fine actor and I always enjoy his performances, such as in the Count of Monte Cristo. I must disagree with another reviewer when it comes to Annabelle Wallis's performance as Queen Jane. She was real in the role, projecting a kind heart, humility, a submissive attitude and total devotion towards her husband the King - even when he was cheating on her. I think she did a wonderful job. Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves was so effective. However she's very attractive and I just had to wonder if that was realistic, since Henry seemed to find Anne of Cleves so unappealing. It seems they should have chosen someone more plain. Lastly I want to mention that the young lady who played the princess Mary did a beautiful job and was so believable.Lastly, the sets and costumes are absolutely amazing. The realism of this series is top notch. I think anyone who's seen season 1 and 2 will certainly want to see season 3. If you haven't seen this series, it's highly recommended. I'm looking forward to season 4.I must add a caution - there is nudity. However it's cable and they're trying to get ratings.

Beginning in Season 1 when Henry VIII was growing desperate for an heir and growing distant from his first wife, the series moves quickly to the period when Anne Boelyn became his obsession. During this time Cardinal Wolsey rose to become the power behind his throne, ruling ruthlessly and nearly absolutely while Henry (played by Johnathon Rhyes Meyers) for the most part followed the Cardinal's advice, maneuvering through a series of betrayals and plots against him. When Anne Boelyn plays much harder to get than any woman ever has, Henry begins to search for a way out of his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, so that he can make Anne his wife. Needing a divorce, Henry turns to Wolsey, who promises to help him create waves of backlash from the church, as well as the Spanish Habsburg dynasty and its overseas empire. The Tudors is a fantastic show which showcases the life and times of King Henry the VIII.

This is an interesting take [inside view] in the life of the infamous Henry VIII. We get to see Henry have many tantrums because he does not get his way. From a historical perspective, of course, it is from a British point of view- thus I do not know how accurate it.  None the less, it is an entertaining series.  Although it could have been done in one season, rather it drags too many seasons.

King Henry's cruelty seemed to know no limits.  And yet I couldn't stop watching the series altogether; I would have missed all the other great material:  the actors, the amazing costumes, the sets and scenery, music, dancing, sex, plotting and scheming and subterfuge and manipulation.  It's a fascinating look at the world of several centuries ago, with a tyrant on the throne and his people subject to his whims.Rhys Myers seemed to do better this time around in terms of his acting, while the others were as wonderful as ever.
