1135358,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00127OVPU,D. S. Thurlow,"[1, 1]","The Kansas City Chiefs have fielded a number of good football teams over the years, but the high water mark remains the Super Bowl win by the 1969 team, who overcame a ton of adversity en route to a 23-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in New Orleans in January 1970.""The 1969 Kansas City Chiefs"" is another excellent NFL films production; Len Dawson, Jim Lynch, and Willie Lanier provide the commentary on a long season, which included injuries to key personnel, an outstanding defensive squad, and a string of tough wins when it counted.  The commentary highlights Coach Hank Stram's ability to innovate using his available players, and the team's willingness to field large numbers of black players at a time when most AFL and NFL players were white.  The narrative almost inevitably centers on quarterback Len Dawson, who missed games due to injury, lost his father in mid-season, and suffered the disruption of being (erroneously) linked to a gambling probe in the week before the Super Bowl.  The Super Bowl itself was an indication of what can happen when a young team on a roll meets a mature team on a mission.This DVD may even be of interest to non-Chiefs fans as a microcosm of professional football 40 years ago, a smaller scale production not much removed from the college game, when the children of players could be on the cheerleading squad and most players had a second job to make ends meet.  There is also some history here: 1969 was the last year of the separate American Football League before it was merged with the NFL.  This DVD is highly recommended to Kansas City Chiefs fans.",5,Remember When?...,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,1604,"['Kansas', 'City', 'Chiefs', 'have', 'fielded', 'number', 'good', 'football', 'teams', 'years', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'win', '1969', 'team', 'who', 'overcame', 'ton', 'adversity', 'route', '23-7', 'victory', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'New', 'Orleans', 'January', '1970', '1969', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Chiefs', 'excellent', 'NFL', 'films', 'production', 'Len', 'Dawson', 'Jim', 'Lynch', 'Willie', 'Lanier', 'provide', 'commentary', 'long', 'season', 'included', 'injuries', 'key', 'personnel', 'outstanding', 'defensive', 'squad', 'string', 'tough', 'wins', 'when', 'counted', 'commentary', 'highlights', 'Coach', 'Hank', 'Stram', 'ability', 'innovate', 'using', 'available', 'players', 'team', 'willingness', 'field', 'large', 'numbers', 'black', 'players', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'AFL', 'NFL', 'players', 'were', 'white', 'narrative', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'centers', 'quarterback', 'Len', 'Dawson', 'who', 'missed', 'games', 'due', 'injury', 'lost', 'father', 'mid-season', 'suffered', 'disruption', 'being', 'erroneously', 'linked', 'gambling', 'probe', 'week', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'was', 'indication', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'young', 'team', 'roll', 'mature', 'team', 'mission.This', 'DVD', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'interest', 'non-Chiefs', 'fans', 'microcosm', 'professional', 'football', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'smaller', 'scale', 'production', 'not', 'much', 'removed', 'college', 'game', 'when', 'children', 'players', 'could', 'be', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'most', 'players', 'had', 'second', 'job', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'also', 'history', 'here', '1969', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'separate', 'American', 'Football', 'League', 'was', 'merged', 'NFL', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Chiefs', 'fans']",NFL America's Game: 1969 CHIEFS Super Bowl IV
1135359,A1CQCS17LQCHIH,B00127OVPU,Jinkyu,"[1, 1]","I have always been an admirer of NFL Films for everything it has accomplished.  Certainly, the 1969 season is a familiar story to a Chiefs fan like me.  Some of the things on this DVD are clips I had seen previously on NFL Films products, such as Otis Taylor's great catch (controversial play) against Oakland in the 1969 AFL Championship game and Mike Garrett scoring in the Chiefs' Super Bowl IV victory on the 65 toss power trap play.  Still, this DVD contains many football clips I had not seen previously.  There is, indeed, much good material on regular season games, the two AFL playoff victories, and Super Bowl IV.However, what is distinctive about this video is how it involves the viewer in the Chiefs' story and even Kansas City itself.  For starters, the season's story is told personally by quarterback Len Dawson and star linebackers Jim Lynch and Willie Lanier, each of whom was among the most cerebral of the Chiefs in those days.  There are clips on the warmth between the team and the fans; the Chiefettes (cheerleaders); the clubhouse, locker room, and practices; players interacting and commenting; and Dawson interviewing his teammates in his role as broadcaster (he did both radio and TV work in Kansas City).  The Chiefs were the dapper, wholesome midwestern team, and Coach Hank Stram was the consummate dresser.  The Chiefs were indeed a real family and were pioneers for good race relations in football, as Lanier (black) and Lynch (white) tell how they competed for the middle linebacker position when they first came up.  The 1969 Chiefs started eight black players on defense when to do so was unprecedented.Viewers should definitely check out the extras here -- it is good live film, not just stills.  There you can see more on individual stars, including several who should be in the Hall of Fame and are not, plus other material such as Super Bowl IV locker room interviews.The quality of the film is excellent; maybe it is the bright red colors of the Chiefs' uniforms, but one wonders how the overall film quality is so consistently good.  At times it seems better than Blu-ray. Strongly recommended for Chiefs and NFL fans.",5,The Chiefs' Finest Hour,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2160,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'admirer', 'NFL', 'Films', 'everything', 'accomplished', 'Certainly', '1969', 'season', 'familiar', 'story', 'Chiefs', 'fan', 'things', 'DVD', 'are', 'clips', 'had', 'seen', 'previously', 'NFL', 'Films', 'products', 'such', 'Otis', 'Taylor', 'great', 'catch', 'controversial', 'play', 'Oakland', '1969', 'AFL', 'Championship', 'game', 'Mike', 'Garrett', 'scoring', 'Chiefs', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'IV', 'victory', '65', 'toss', 'power', 'trap', 'play', 'Still', 'DVD', 'many', 'football', 'clips', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'previously', 'indeed', 'much', 'good', 'material', 'regular', 'season', 'games', 'two', 'AFL', 'playoff', 'victories', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'IV.However', 'what', 'distinctive', 'video', 'how', 'viewer', 'Chiefs', 'story', 'even', 'Kansas', 'City', 'starters', 'season', 'story', 'told', 'personally', 'quarterback', 'Len', 'Dawson', 'star', 'linebackers', 'Jim', 'Lynch', 'Willie', 'Lanier', 'whom', 'was', 'most', 'cerebral', 'Chiefs', 'days', 'are', 'clips', 'warmth', 'team', 'fans', 'Chiefettes', 'cheerleaders', 'clubhouse', 'locker', 'room', 'practices', 'players', 'interacting', 'commenting', 'Dawson', 'interviewing', 'teammates', 'role', 'broadcaster', 'did', 'radio', 'TV', 'work', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Chiefs', 'were', 'dapper', 'wholesome', 'midwestern', 'team', 'Coach', 'Hank', 'Stram', 'was', 'consummate', 'dresser', 'Chiefs', 'were', 'indeed', 'real', 'family', 'were', 'pioneers', 'good', 'race', 'relations', 'football', 'Lanier', 'black', 'Lynch', 'white', 'tell', 'how', 'competed', 'middle', 'linebacker', 'position', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'up', '1969', 'Chiefs', 'started', 'eight', 'black', 'players', 'defense', 'when', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'unprecedented.Viewers', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'here', 'good', 'live', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'stills', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'individual', 'stars', 'including', 'several', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'are', 'not', 'other', 'material', 'such', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'IV', 'locker', 'room', 'interviews.The', 'quality', 'film', 'excellent', 'maybe', 'bright', 'red', 'colors', 'Chiefs', 'uniforms', 'one', 'how', 'overall', 'film', 'quality', 'so', 'consistently', 'good', 'times', 'better', 'Blu-ray', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'Chiefs', 'NFL', 'fans']",NFL America's Game: 1969 CHIEFS Super Bowl IV
1135360,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00127OVPU,Larry VanDeSande,"[14, 14]","Released by NFL Films as part of its 20 greatest Super Bowls package, this film relates the story of the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs, who won the Super Bowl by defeating Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in early 1970. For Chiefs fans, this is must viewing since it is still the team's only Super Bowl win.The storylines of that famous 1969 season are, for the most part, all told in this video. The Chiefs were a dominant AFL team throughouth the 1960s, having won the 1962 championship in their final year as the Dallas Texans, then winning again in 1966 to get the honor of losing to Green Bay in the first Super Bowl.Among memorable moments in the video is the story of QB Len Dawson's alleged gambling scheme, a story that broke during Super Bowl week and grabbed a big share of headlines. Turned out Dawson was clean and the story, coming on the heels of his dad's death, added drama to the upcoming game, which -- following the Jets remarkable win the year before over the Colts -- confirmed the authenticity of the AFL. It was the last Super Bowl played before the two leagues merged.Another memorable moment caught here is coach Hank Stram (whom the NFL Network recently ranked among the top 10 greatest motivational coaches in NFL history) being miked throughtout the game, the first time NFL Films ever did this. It resulted in legend for both NFL Films and Stram, who uttered now famous lines including, ""Keep matriculating the ball down the field"" and ""65 toss power trap.""Having been a Chiefs fan from their 1960 organization in Dallas, I was a little disappointed some of the great moments of the 1969 season weren't included. One I remember vividly came near the end of the 13-6 playoff win against the Jets where the Chiefs defense, led by Hall of Fame linebacker Willie Lanier, stretched the Jets and Joe Namath to the sideline, forcing an incomplete pass late in the game in the shadow of the end zone. The final regular season loss to the hated rival Raiders that season had the Chiefs so secretive of their playoff agenda that they started the game offensively in the T-formation.These memories aside, anyone that thinks they're a Chiefs fan should own this video, one of NFL Films enduring set about great Super Bowl champions.",5,"Sad to say, but still the Chiefs greatest moment",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2234,"['Released', 'NFL', 'Films', 'part', '20', 'greatest', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'package', 'film', 'story', '1969', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Chiefs', 'who', 'won', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'defeating', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', '23-7', 'early', '1970', 'Chiefs', 'fans', 'must', 'viewing', 'still', 'team', 'only', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'win.The', 'storylines', 'famous', '1969', 'season', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'told', 'video', 'Chiefs', 'were', 'dominant', 'AFL', 'team', 'throughouth', '1960s', 'having', 'won', '1962', 'championship', 'final', 'year', 'Dallas', 'Texans', 'then', 'winning', 'again', '1966', 'get', 'honor', 'losing', 'Green', 'Bay', 'first', 'Super', 'Bowl.Among', 'memorable', 'moments', 'video', 'story', 'QB', 'Len', 'Dawson', 'alleged', 'gambling', 'scheme', 'story', 'broke', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'week', 'grabbed', 'big', 'share', 'headlines', 'Turned', 'out', 'Dawson', 'was', 'clean', 'story', 'coming', 'heels', 'dad', 'death', 'added', 'drama', 'upcoming', 'game', 'following', 'Jets', 'remarkable', 'win', 'year', 'Colts', 'confirmed', 'authenticity', 'AFL', 'was', 'last', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'played', 'two', 'leagues', 'merged.Another', 'memorable', 'moment', 'caught', 'here', 'coach', 'Hank', 'Stram', 'whom', 'NFL', 'Network', 'recently', 'ranked', 'top', '10', 'greatest', 'motivational', 'coaches', 'NFL', 'history', 'being', 'miked', 'game', 'first', 'time', 'NFL', 'Films', 'ever', 'did', 'resulted', 'legend', 'NFL', 'Films', 'Stram', 'who', 'uttered', 'now', 'famous', 'lines', 'including', 'Keep', 'matriculating', 'ball', 'down', 'field', '65', 'toss', 'power', 'trap', 'Having', 'been', 'Chiefs', 'fan', '1960', 'organization', 'Dallas', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'great', 'moments', '1969', 'season', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'One', 'remember', 'vividly', 'came', 'end', '13-6', 'playoff', 'win', 'Jets', 'where', 'Chiefs', 'defense', 'led', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'linebacker', 'Willie', 'Lanier', 'stretched', 'Jets', 'Joe', 'Namath', 'sideline', 'forcing', 'incomplete', 'pass', 'late', 'game', 'shadow', 'end', 'zone', 'final', 'regular', 'season', 'loss', 'hated', 'rival', 'Raiders', 'season', 'had', 'Chiefs', 'so', 'secretive', 'playoff', 'agenda', 'started', 'game', 'offensively', 'T-formation.These', 'memories', 'aside', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'Chiefs', 'fan', 'should', 'own', 'video', 'one', 'NFL', 'Films', 'enduring', 'set', 'great', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'champions']",NFL America's Game: 1969 CHIEFS Super Bowl IV

For example, Len Dawson was injured much of the season, but able to play by getting a second, more accurate examination of his injury, which enabled him to play in the Superbowl. Also didn't realize that Dawson was falsely accused of being in on a gambling ring just before the Superbowl. What a devastating thing that was for him, his family, and the team. What's more, Dawson's father suddenly died during the season. The emotional impact of that was shared. The '69 Chiefs were a great team that was well-coached.
