633849,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JNQG,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 22]","This film was bad.  Not in the sense that there was at least one redeemable scene in the entire film, but in the sense that everything from the opening to closing credits in this film was horrendous.  There was nothing of value in this entire film.  I have no idea how this film grossed a little over thirty million in its first weekend.  There must have been a good trailer before it, or perhaps there was a generation of people that missed the film when it was originally called Kindergarten Cop.  Either way, for an hour an a half we were duped into watching nothing more than scene after scene of diaper humor, a comically unbalanced Diesel wading through the supposed funny moments, a duck, scenes where the baby of the family is left unattended, sloppy (and I mean sloppy) editing, and quick resolutions that will leave the avid film watcher confused and disoriented.  Coupled with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, Diesel proves that he is better left in the action genre, the leaving the humor to anyone else in the world except for him.There are several people that I am extremely upset with in the world of film today.  Tim Burton is currently at the top of my list, but right below him is Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon.  I grew up with the humor of these guys by watching the decently funny Reno 911 and the hysterically funny MTV show, The State.  When I saw that they had written this film, I was expecting to see a new level of comedy.  I was hoping to see a film where the humor was sharp, the dialog was perhaps paradoxical, while laughing at all the ways they could play off the already clich&eacute; scenes that have been done in early 80s movies.  Alas, this was not the case.  They literally sold out.  Garant and Lennon created a film that fit well into the structure of Disney by giving us bathroom humor, jagged bonding moments, and that inevitable unclimactic ending which sums everything up in a nice little bow.  Did they need the cash?  My guess is ""yes"".  For those that may be fans of Reno 911 or The State, I would not go into this film expecting classic humor, but instead be prepared for unfunny diaper scenes which seem to be the staple of this film.Since the story was filled with more holes than Swiss cheese, it seemed only right for Diesel to fall into that one of those holes as well.  He cannot do comedy.  This film, The Pacifier, proves that.  There were no scenes in which he was able to generate a laugh by anyone in our house.  His comic timing seemed invisible to non-existent, all the while it just seemed as if he kept waiting for the chance to walk around without his shirt and perhaps fight some bad-guys.  You could tell that he felt uncomfortable in this film and was not ready to handle the pressures of comedy.  Perhaps it was the direction that he was given, but Diesel continually went in and out of character.  His main focus was to watch the children, but whenever he had to do something else, he completely forgot about the children and moved on.  This is hard to explain, but there were several scenes when Diesel left small children unattended in the house, or in the car, or somewhere off-screen while he went searching for his ""actual"" mission.  I was surprised that Social Services didn't try to boycott this film.  Perhaps it was Diesel's way of being funny, but for me it just came off as sloppy.  Comedy is hard and Diesel needs more work at it before he headlines another Disney bomb.Finally, I would like to say that Adam Shankman needs to really work on his direction skills.  I know he has done more films than just this, but for some odd reason the editing was horrible in this film.  Scenes would occur randomly while conclusions to those scenes would arise sporadically as well.  It was chaos.  We, as viewers, jumped around so much in this film that you just didn't get a feel of any of the characters.  The Disney touch was so apparent that it forced the story to become unstructured and confusing.  The wrestling to Nazi scene was especially bad, in fact, the entire Sound of Music moment was painful and disruptive to the entire film.  Didn't these children's father just pass away horribly about two weeks ago?  Nobody seemed to care and there wasn't one tear shed throughout the entire film.  The structure on helping the children while continuously looking for ""Ghost"" just didn't fit.  There needed to be more stories, more moments between the children, more glue instead of chaos holding these scenes together.  The random relationship between Diesel and Graham was idiotic, while the entire concept of falling in love with these children in just short of two weeks blew my mind.  We were all over the place in this film, and it hurt.Overall, this film was worse than pathetic.  All three key elements to this film, the writers, the ""major"" star, and the director just didn't seem to be on the right page.  It was sad to see such great comics like Lennon and Garant churn out duds like this.  It was sad to see Hollywood resort to the clich&eacute;d 80s concept of bringing an action star into comedy and watch him fail miserably.  The story was horrendous and glued together by a two-year old.  The comedic moments were non-existent, while Diesel wandered through the entire film, in and out of character, hoping to revive a dying career.  Nobody made me laugh.  Nobody was funny.  Nothing was worth viewing a second time.  If you are looking for a decent comedy that fully represents the key elements in this film, I would check out the comedic actor John Candy tackle it in Uncle Buck.  This film should be burned from Hollywood's records.Grade: * out of *****",1,Why are your boobs so big?,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,5645,"['film', 'was', 'bad', 'Not', 'sense', 'was', 'least',

633854,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNQG,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 10]","I found myself asking `what was he thinking' quite a bit during this film.  I remember when it was first released I was excited to see a family comedy that looked entertaining but `The Pacifier' truly proves to be anything but.  It's the true definition of clich&eacute;d corny antics with no real plot other than some washed up implausible, prefabricated, ridiculous, contrived storyline that grows old before it gets started.  I felt like I had seen this done before in every other ridiculously unauthentic family comedy yet each and every other time I feel it was done better.  The first and largest mistake was the casting of Vin Diesel as the lead.  He's not funny, not even in the whole tough guy gets schooled kinda way they tried for.  He doesn't land a single joke and his physical humor is nothing more than awkward and just plain painful to watch.  The second major mistake was the inclusion of Brad Garrett's character.  Not the fact that Garrett played him (although I find Garrett annoying and unfunny anyways) but his character as a whole, even played by someone else, was a total waste of script paper.The story follows Shane Wolfe, Navy S.E.A.L., as he's assigned to watch the children of a slain scientist while his widow is retrieving some valuable information from his safety deposit box in Switzerland.  In her absence Shane has to deal with intruders looking for some top secret disc or something like that.  Shane's biggest problem though is the children who don't want him there and fight him every step of the way.  Our biggest problem is the script that the actors muddle through and we have to try and find entertainment and or enjoyment in.  That is a hard job and one not worth fulfilling.Vin Diesel was at one time a Hollywood `it' guy.  He was in the big blockbusters of the season thanks to his pivotal role in `The Fast and the Furious'.  After that he was admired by all men and swooned over by all women.  But it's apparent that his career has taken a dive.  His choice in films lately has been anything but inspired or even smart.  Turning up in a film much better suited for washed up talents as apposed to rising stars goes to further twist the knife.  I can't really think of anything nice to say about this movie.  Granted, there are a few scenes, very few, that made me chuckle, like when Shane teaches the Girl Scout troop to fight and they get to try it out on some rival troopers, but it's not enough for me to say I'd consider watching this mess again.  It was nice to see Lauren Graham, but I say that only because she's very easy on my eyes.  In fact the ending alone is so outrageously ridiculous that I can't help but chastise this movie for trying to be taken seriously.  It's not funny unless you find cheap imitations utterly hilarious.",1,"A lot of the same thing, just worse...",1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,2788,"['found', 'asking', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'quite', 'bit', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'family', 'comedy', 'looked', 'entertaining', 'Pacifier', 'truly', 'proves', 'be', 'anything', 'true', 'definition', 'clich', 'eacute', 'corny', 'antics', 'real', 'plot', 'other', 'washed', 'up', 'implausible', 'prefabricated', 'ridiculous', 'contrived', 'storyline', 'old', 'started', 'felt', 'had', 'seen', 'done', 'other', 'ridiculously', 'unauthentic', 'family', 'comedy', 'yet', 'other', 'time', 'feel', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'first', 'largest', 'mistake', 'was', 'casting', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'lead', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'even', 'whole', 'tough', 'guy', 'schooled', 'kinda', 'way', 'tried', ""n't"", 'land', 'single', 'joke', 'physical', 'humor', 'nothing', 'more', 'awkward', 'just', 'plain', 'painful', 'watch', 'second', 'major', 'mistake', 'was', 'inclusion', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'character', 'Not', 'fact', 'Garrett', 'played', 'find', 'Garrett', 'annoying', 'unfunny', 'anyways', 'character', 'whole', 'even', 'played', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'script', 'paper.The', 'story', 'Shane', 'Wolfe', 'Navy', 'S.E.A.L.', 'assigned', 'watch', 'children', 'slain', 'scientist', 'widow', 'retrieving', 'valuable', 'information', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'Switzerland', 'absence', 'Shane', 'deal', 'intruders', 'looking', 'top', 'secret', 'disc', 'something', 'Shane', 'biggest', 'problem', 'though', 'children', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'fight', 'step', 'way', 'biggest', 'problem', 'script', 'actors', 'muddle', 'have', 'try', 'find', 'entertainment', 'enjoyment', 'hard', 'job', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'fulfilling.Vin', 'Diesel', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'guy', 'was', 'big', 'blockbusters', 'season', 'thanks', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'was', 'admired', 'men', 'swooned', 'over', 'women', 'apparent', 'career', 'taken', 'dive', 'choice', 'films', 'lately', 'been', 'anything', 'inspired', 'even', 'smart', 'Turning', 'up', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'suited', 'washed', 'up', 'talents', 'apposed', 'rising', 'stars', 'further', 'twist', 'knife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'anything', 'nice', 'say', 'movie', 'Granted', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'very', 'few', 'made', 'chuckle', 'when', 'Shane', 'Girl', 'Scout', 'troop', 'fight', 'get', 'try', 'out', 'rival', 'troopers', 'not', 'enough', 'say', ""'d"", 'consider', 'watching', 'mess', 'again', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'say', 'only', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'fact', 'ending', 'alone', 'so', 'outrageously', 'ridiculous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chastise', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'not', 'funny', 'find', 'cheap', 'imitations', 'utterly', 'hilarious']",The Pacifier

633857,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,B00005JNQG,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[1, 2]","I have to say the first time I saw a ad for this movie all I could think about was ""Good Heavens, not another Hulk Hogan-Suburban Commando flick"". However, having been dragged to this I was pleasently surprised. Although the plot is hokey, predictable, and downright silly at times there are many things to like about this picture.First of all, Vin Diesel really isn't that bad of an actor. He tends sometimes to seem out of place in a comedy but then again, the whole plot is about him being out of place, so it works. The rest of the cast is quite good. Second, the humor, while being hit-&-miss at times, was more hit than miss. For once, all the funny scenes were not included in the TV ads. Third, and to me one of the most important, the director & writers never had to resort to ""bathroom"" humor. No dirty-mouth little kids, no body noises (except when it came to the baby, of course).

Might as well forget about XXX. Oh, I did like his voice in The Iron Giant. But now I can honestly say that I like the guy. And I can finally see why so many other woman find him so, well, hunky.Diesel stars as Shane, a Navy Seal who is assigned the task of guarding a family of five children. Their father was an inventor and he created some software called The Ghost that would enable the takeover of another country's missiles. Or something like that. That's not really important. What is important is the characters, and they're really good and surprisingly well-developed in this movie. All the kids are adorable, especially the little girl, who inquires as to whether her boobs will someday be as big as Shane's. ""They're not BOOBS!"" he says. So funny. There's also a couple of rebellious teenagers, one boy and one girl-- the girl is an accident-behind-the-wheel waiting to happen and the boy has a secret that just may surprise you. So of course, this hardened military man will eventually soften up. Brad Garrett co-stars (ohhhh, how I loathe his character... what a jerk!) as well as Lauren Graham as the eventual love interest for Shane.Very cute movie.

It is ""Kindergarten Cop,"" ""Uncle Buck,"" and ""Mr. Mom,"" with a light ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" thrown in. It is not as good as any of those, but I am not 10 years old. Your young boy or girl will love it.It is a mix of slapstick, family style humor and situation gags. Nothing in the story will surprise moviegoers, but nothing will offend them either. It is a fun, decent, average 1960s-style Disney film.The plot:Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel), Navy Seal, is assigned to protect the family of a slain scientist. Their home may have a special device the enemy wants. The mother is out of town trying to open a safe deposit box, and Shane's stay last longer than expected.Shane, muscle-bound and bald, looks intimidating. He's tough, a ""leave no man behind"" kind of guy. All man. As a protector/babysitter, he runs aground into all of the expected gags. He changes a diaper with typical disgust, drives the kids to school, and feeds them dried MREs (Meals Ready To Eat). Parenting is new, and he starts learning.He catches a boyfriend sneaking in, and has run-ins with the wresting coach, played by huge Brad Garrett. Some minor subplots about relating to the children bring a few laughs and ""awes.""It isn't really an action movie, not beyond a few ""Home Alone"" scenes.Vin Diesel shows he can act here, and occasionally shines in a few sequences. When he finds the code in the ""Peter Panda Dance,"" we see an indication that there's hope for him in a better movie that relies on his personality more than his biceps.Critically, from an adult perspective, Brad Garrett was not believable as a wrestling coach, and Lauren Graham as the military women-turned-principal did not work. It was as much of a casting problem as it was a writing and directing issue.Brittany Snow as oldest daughter Zoe Plummer is great. She plays the character honestly, and within her ability. There a Hillary Duff aspect to her, with an edge. Unfortunately, Faith Ford as her mom, Julie Plummer overplayed her. Luckily, we only suffer with her in a few scenes.Oldest son, Seth Plummer, is likewise overplayed by Max Thieriot, who seems like he was handed the roll for growing up in Hollywood. His conversion from weak trench coat outsider, to thespian acting in ""Sound of Music,"" was more than a stretch.The nanny, Helga, played by Carol Kane, is given terrible lines. Remembering her in ""The Princess Bride,"" I shuddered as she tried to squeeze out comedy.The movie is disposable, and will not rank among Disney's best movies. However, it shows that Disney is willing to toss a few dollars into a movie that is clean, with a message that is pro-family, pro-parents, pro-father, and old fashioned fun.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",4,"Old Style, Innocent Disney Humor for Young Children",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2763,"['had', 'children', '5-12', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'see', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Mr', 'Mom', 'light', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'thrown', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'am', 'not', '10', 'years', 'old', 'young', 'boy', 'girl', 'will', 'love', 'it.It', 'mix', 'slapstick', 'family', 'style', 'humor', 'situation', 'gags', 'Nothing', 'story', 'will', 'surprise', 'moviegoers', 'nothing', 'will', 'offend', 'fun', 'decent', 'average', '1960s-style', 'Disney', 'film.The', 'plot', 'Shane', 'Wolfe', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'assigned', 'protect', 'family', 'slain', 'scientist', 'Their', 'home', 'may', 'have', 'special', 'device', 'enemy', 'mother', 'town', 'trying', 'open', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'Shane', 'stay', 'last', 'longer', 'expected.Shane', 'muscle-bound', 'bald', 'intimidating', 'tough', 'leave', 'man', 'kind', 'guy', 'man', 'protector/babysitter', 'aground', 'expected', 'gags', 'diaper', 'typical', 'disgust', 'kids', 'school', 'dried', 'MREs', 'Meals', 'Ready', 'Eat', 'Parenting', 'new', 'learning.He', 'catches', 'boyfriend', 'sneaking', 'run-ins', 'wresting', 'coach', 'played', 'huge', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'minor', 'subplots', 'relating', 'children', 'bring', 'few', 'laughs', 'awes', ""n't"", 'really', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'few', 'Home', 'Alone', 'scenes.Vin', 'Diesel', 'can', 'act', 'here', 'occasionally', 'shines', 'few', 'sequences', 'When', 'code', 'Peter', 'Panda', 'Dance', 'see', 'indication', 'hope', 'better', 'movie', 'personality', 'more', 'biceps.Critically', 'adult', 'perspective', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'military', 'women-turned-principal', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'casting', 'problem', 'was', 'writing', 'directing', 'issue.Brittany', 'Snow', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Plummer', 'great', 'character', 'honestly', 'ability', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'aspect', 'edge', 'Unfortunately', 'Faith', 'Ford', 'mom', 'Julie', 'Plummer', 'overplayed', 'Luckily', 'only', 'suffer', 'few', 'scenes.Oldest', 'son', 'Seth', 'Plummer', 'likewise', 'overplayed', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'who', 'was', 'handed', 'roll', 'growing', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'conversion', 'weak', 'trench', 'coat', 'outsider', 'thespian', 'acting', 'Sound', 'Music', 'was', 'more', 'stretch.The', 'nanny', 'Helga', 'played', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'given', 'terrible', 'lines', 'Remembering', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'shuddered', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'out', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'disposable', 'will', 'not', 'rank', 'Disney', 'best', 'movies', 'However', 'Disney', 'willing', 'toss', 'few', 'dollars', 'movie', 'clean', 'message', 'pro-family', 'pro-parents', 'pro-father', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fun.Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",The Pacifier

How could they produce a film, that's meant for a family and kids, be so outlandishly racist, stereotypical, violent, and degraded? Also, how many times I have seen this before? Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, Adventures in Babysitting, Overboard, Mr. Mom, and Kindergarten Cop are enough to close the genre out. When I thought that Vin Diesel couldn't be that bad of an actor after having a great experience of him in XxX, boy, I was wrong totally....he is certainly one of the worst actors in the business today. He needs to retire and show off his body as an athletic trainer. That was enough for me to suspect him being on steroids. Again, yes...The Pacifier being a kids' film, what was the idea of showing off his body to 5 years old movie watchers? 7 years old girls? What would they think? That his body is the most important feature? Is it supposed to be a sexual film? How could Disney produce a film that promotes violence by guns? By boys taunting girls? By girls lashing out their anger by pummeling the boys? That violence is the answer to all the problems in the world? What kind of a message is The Pacifier supposed to be? I couldn't believe how the producers of this film could allow a Romanian gypsy be so stereotyped? Do they have any idea how much the Romanian gypsies had to go through the Holocaust during World War II? Also, I couldn't believe the words ""skank"" and ""balls"" were used in this film. Oh my goodness, the values of decency have gone into the toilet. What happened to the magic that Disney claimed to have to produce? What happened to films like Mary Poppins? I know almost nobody of this generation had seen The Sounds of Music, and it was quite inappropriate to have displayed the Nazi swastikas in The Pacifier. A kid movie needs to be made sure that the relevant symbols are applicable, so there won't be any befuddlement. It's definitely one of the worst films I've seen. Now, I have completely no trust in Disney when it comes to movies. I know it when I've seen stinkers like The Incredibles, A Shark Tale, and this abdominal piece of crap. Why so much senseless violence in gun play and wasted kung-fu fighting? How can the kids be able to differentiate what is reality and what violates the laws of physics when it comes to impossible stunts? The kids could have been seriously hurt by trying to mimic the kung-fu moves a la The Matrix.",1,Awful Dreck.,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2479,"['Viewed', '5/06Rate', '15/06', 'am', 'furious', 'Disney', 'Company', 'letting', 'Pacifier', 'happen', 'How', 'could', 'produce', 'film', 'meant', 'family', 'kids', 'be', 'so', 'outlandishly', 'racist', 'stereotypical', 'violent', 'degraded', 'Also', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'Overboard', 'Mr', 'Mom', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'are', 'enough', 'close', 'genre', 'out', 'When', 'thought', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'actor', 'having', 'great', 'experience', 'XxX', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'totally', '.he', 'certainly', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'business', 'today', 'retire', 'show', 'off', 'body', 'athletic', 'trainer', 'was', 'enough', 'suspect', 'being', 'steroids', 'Again', 'yes', 'Pacifier', 'being', 'kids', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'idea', 'showing', 'off', 'body', '5', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'watchers', '7', 'years', 'old', 'girls', 'What', 'would', 'think', 'body', 'most', 'important', 'feature', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexual', 'film', 'How', 'could', 'Disney', 'produce', 'film', 'violence', 'guns', 'boys', 'taunting', 'girls', 'girls', 'lashing', 'out', 'anger', 'pummeling', 'boys', 'violence', 'answer', 'problems', 'world', 'What', 'kind', 'message', 'Pacifier', 'supposed', 'be', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'producers', 'film', 'could', 'allow', 'Romanian', 'gypsy', 'be', 'so', 'stereotyped', 'Do', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'Romanian', 'gypsies', 'had', 'go', 'Holocaust', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Also', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'words', 'skank', 'balls', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'values', 'decency', 'have', 'gone', 'toilet', 'What', 'happened', 'magic', 'Disney', 'claimed', 'have', 'produce', 'What', 'happened', 'films', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'know', 'almost', 'nobody', 'generation', 'had', 'seen', 'Sounds', 'Music', 'was', 'quite', 'inappropriate', 'have', 'displayed', 'Nazi', 'swastikas', 'Pacifier', 'A', 'kid', 'movie', 'needs', 'be', 'made', 'sure', 'relevant', 'symbols', 'are', 'applicable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'befuddlement', 'definitely', 'one', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Now', 'have', 'completely', 'trust', 'Disney', 'when', 'movies', 'know', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stinkers', 'Incredibles', 'A', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'abdominal', 'piece', 'crap', 'Why', 'so', 'much', 'senseless', 'violence', 'gun', 'play', 'wasted', 'kung-fu', 'fighting', 'How', 'can', 'kids', 'be', 'able', 'differentiate', 'what', 'reality', 'laws', 'physics', 'when', 'impossible', 'stunts', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'trying', 'mimic', 'kung-fu', 'moves', 'la', 'Matrix']",The Pacifier

The only action flick of his I enjoyed was the first Fast and The Furious (and I did not think that was great- Just Good).  And I never cared much for everything else that followed- xXx, A Man Apart, Knockaround Guys, or Chronicles of Riddick.  So I had pretty much viewed every film he was in to sort of be the same thing- Some adrenaline feuled action movie soley aim for guys.  However, when I first trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it.  Its was VIN DIESEL in a DISNEY MOVIE.  Howver, I did not hear much good stuff about it, so I missed it in theaters.But of course I would catch it on DVD some time later and I very much enjoyed.  I found myself laughing throughout the movie.  So far, this is the only Vin movie I am considedring to buy no matter how many times I have seen it.  Here is the plot.Shane Wolf (Vin) is a disgraced navy seal after having failed to rescue a Professor who was creating a military program called ""Ghost"" which many terrorists want their hands on.  His next assignment is rather simple- keep the professor's children while there mom is out of town helping the army obtain ""Ghost"".  The kids are Zoe (Brittany Snow), Seth (Max Theriot), Lulu (Morgan York), and toddlers Tyler and Peter.  However, these kids have a problem with authority and they seem to defy him at any chance they get.  It seems that Shane's high discplinary skills are no match for a group of kids.  However, they eventually all realize they may need to be depend on each other when the danger.  Shane starts to deeply understand these kids and the troubles they are going through, while the kids give him a lesson on how to live a normal suburbian life.All in all, Pacifier was a very enjoyable film.  Howver, my only problem in the film was actually Vin himself.  I know he was the real selling point of the movie (and proboboly why the movie made $100 million +) but I did not find him to be funny even he when he so desperatly tries.  The only scene he made me laugh was this part where bologne falls on his shirt and he says angerly ""This is my favorite shirt"".  I believe the kids were the real stars of the movie.  They were really and made me laugh alot.  Pretty everyone except Vin was funny ESPECIALLY Brad Garret as the sadistic wrestling coach.  He was hilarious.

The movie had trouble deciding what it was. It was a cross between action and a family movie. The acting was terrible but that mostly had to do with the writing. Britney Snow was especially bad in this and gave me a headache. The film has few funny moments. I didn't care too much about the characters and it's important for the viewer to like some of the characters. The movie is boring.Carol Kane is a nice surprise but doesn't give a performance to match her Scrooged performance. Vin is disappointing but hopefully for him he got a good paycheck because this is a movie that will set your career back. Vin is great in action but given the proper script and movie he may do better.I had to turn off the movie close to half way through because it was so bad.

If you enjoy movies like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""Spy Kids"" you should find this one right up your alley. It is a bit more sugar coated than ""Kindergarten Cop"", but entertaining still. It was nice to see Vin Diesel do one like this since his image has usually been the tough guy. As Schwartzenegger did with ""Kindergarten Cop"", Vin Diesel now shows he can do comedy and light family acting as well.The story involves a leader of a seal team protecting a scientist family after he is killed for project Ghost. Diesel plays the seal leader. His encounters are mostly comedic ones with the children and a few people at the school. Although there is a little violence in the beginning and at the end, this is not rough for most children. I have seen much rougher on TV.Diesel is a natural and I hope to see him do more. I really wish he had done the second Triple X movie. I think it would have done better at the box office. Pacifier is a good quality DVD with a few extras. Overall a good family movie.

633876,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B00005JNQG,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[0, 0]","The Pacifier is one of those movies that starts off a little slow but really delivers in the end.  The beginning of the film makes the viewer wonder how we will ever be drawn into caring about the well being of the cast, then suddenly, we are.  I found myself really drawn to the family that Vin Diesel was protecting from the bad guys.  The entire cast was convincing and funny.  Since my daughter is just learning how to drive, I found the parts with the teenage girl learning how to drive hilarious.  But overall, the movie delivers a little bit of everything.Vin Diesel is the John Wayne of today.  In a lot of his movies he stands up for what is right even when everyone around him is following the wrong path.  He makes a good hero simply because his visual expressions are fantastic when it comes to showing shock at others bad behavior.  We just can't wait for him to slap the ""bad guy"" around and explain to him how stupid he is!  In this movie shows quite a few bad guys the error of their ways.  And he even teaches some Girl Scouts how to defend themselves against a group of cookie-crushing bad-boy scouts.Is the plot in this movie too simple?  You betchya'.  Is this movie still a fun ride with a cast that seemed to be having a blast on the set?  You betchya!  Disney made a great choice picking Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast.  I laughed, and yeah, I admit it, I even cried, but just for a second.  I think the butter on the popcorn got in my eyes.I realize the critics will eat this movie alive.  And that's one reason I'm glad critics don't make movies.  A simple script can be made into an amazing movie when the acting rises above and beyond what is required.  Watching this film reminded me of the old Disney movies that though about entertaining the entire American family, not just a select group of movie-goers.I hope the director, cast, and crew, get to see this review, because I want to say thanks for making my family smile, laugh, and cry together.

633877,A1EFS5PV3HOFDI,B00005JNQG,"Danielle Muller ""Shulamith""","[1, 3]","The funniest scene in this movie was where the little girl asks Vin if ""My chest will get as big as yours?"" The dumbstricken look on his face, and the wild desire to hide is quite apparent on Vin. Other than that, there's not much here to keep adults laughing, but the younger generation should be pleased with their taste of Vin. Even the towel scene was designed for children in mind, and while being amusing to them, its going to leave us rather disappointed.Disney certainly did all they could to turn the heat off in this movie, making the sexy lug from the hits such as Pitch Black, Riddick and the fast and the furius turning into a complete nurse maid. Even learing the 'Panda Dance' where we get to hear and see Vin show us that he certainly didn't become famous for his ability to sing and dance. But like I said, its a moment for children, and they seem to enjoy it.Armed with Diapers, bottles and germ infectants, Vin carries his S.W.A.T habits into the real world, and contrives to look undercover and tough even when hoisting a baby on his hip, and cleaning up after a duck that thinks its a dog. He's every mothers dream ,and every babies nightmare.The romance in this movie is also toned down as he falls in love with the high school principle, and becomes a stage director. Its rather funny to think of after seeing the steamy scenes from The Fast and the Furious that it becomes quite comical to Vin's character and style. He just doesn't seem the type to date someone so mild. But this is Disney, and there are rules to follow. (Sigh)On summing up, don't look for anything wild or exciting, unless its evading a laser field or teaching a teen to drive a van.

633881,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,B00005JNQG,Dave,"[1, 2]","How come I always miss the good movies when they cycle through the theaters? Probably because I'm no fan of the action flicks of the flavor Vin Diesel is known for, and don't pay all that much attention anyway. Regardless, I saw The Pacifier playing in a Wal-Mart one day and thought it looked good. Watched it with my family the following Friday night, and after a second run-through of my favorite fight scenes, sat down to write my review.PLOT: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel, but you already KNEW that) is assigned to protect the Plummer family after the father, a military strategist, dies in an attempted rescue mission led by Lt. Wolfe. While Mrs. Plummer departs to recover her husband's secret plans, Shane is put in charge of the Plummer children: Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter and baby Tyler. Shane finds himself dealing with typical family issues, such as bratty teenagers, Lulu's Girl Scouts, and changing Tyler's diapers, all while maintaining the strictest of military discipline and protective vigilance.BAD: (""Bad"" in this case is anything that might be objectionable to younger kids, since it IS supposed to be a family movie) There is an opening sequence where Shane leads a patrol of Navy SEALS to rescue Mr. Plummer. Shane and his crew dispatch bad guys with some well-placed blows, and well-choreographed action that results in most of the bad guys getting blown up. Shane fires a missile at a helicopter, taking it down. At first, everything seems well until Shane boards the military transport chopper and finds the pilot slumped in the cockpit. He turns, only to be hit (bloodlessly) by a bullet. Later violence consists of bloodless fast-paced kung-fu/karate/martial arts fights between dark-clad ninjas and Shane. Shane also has to dodge several booby traps, which could frighten young ones. Profanity consists of a dozen or so usages of God's name in vain, and one or two ""h*lls."" Lulu comments on Shane's physique, asking several different questions about his chest, and if she will have as big a chest as his, and does he wear a bra. Many sequences and/or related dialogue involve discussion of threats to children, and at times, children being held at gunpoint, or threatened. The kids (even the baby) are guarded at one point by a very nasty terrorist with a gun. Shane finds the oldest daughter Zoe sitting outside on an upper-level patio, and cautions ""Even a rookie sniper could drop you like a deer."" You would know best if your kids can handle it, but sometimes I'm surprised what goes into a ""PG"" movie. From my perspective, this one's safe for the kiddos.GOOD: (""Good"" in this case means anything positive that attracted me about the movie, and/or provided redeeming values) Shane may be a tough Navy SEAL, but he's all heart. He begins by instilling discipline in the family, albeit under protest from the kids. Shane eventually realizes that while discipline is needed, the kids also need a friend, and he winds up stepping in to take that role. He steps in to ward off Zoe's jerky boyfriend, which she initially resents, but soon appreciates the wisdom of. He helps train Lulu and her Girl Scout troop in self-defense against the swaggering eight-year-old Boy Scout bullies. He puts his own life in danger several times to protect Mrs. Plummer, and the children. The kids hate his military ways, but gradually accept, then love him. The movie's overall emphasis on how hard Shane's job is (replacing both mother AND father) is a welcome tip of the hat to the toughest job in the world; stay-at-home Mom.THOUGHTS: Tough guys taking over family duties is nothing new, but movie-goers haven't seen any (that I know of) which also deals with terrorists. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and if you're looking for a good Friday night movie for the whole family, Pacifier's a good one to watch.DVD CONTENT: The extras are shockingly dismal, but I suppose the movie was more character-based than effects-based. The small scope of interviews and behind-the-scene clips (one featurette about how Vin Diesel is actually a nice guy, one about Brad Garrett, some surprisingly UN-funny bloopers, some cut scenes without any explanation behind them and a small selection of previews) plus an absence of easter eggs all demonstrate that Hollywood needs to have separate behind-the-scenes crews to make the DVD extras.

633882,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JNQG,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 2]","Shane Wolfe (Diesel) is a top Navy SEAL assigned to protect the family of a top secret scientist (Donovan). While Mom (Ford) is away helping with the case, Shane has to watch their five kids--rebellious 16-year-old Zoe (Snow), sulky teen Seth (Thieriot), precocious 8-year-old Lulu (York), a couple of rugrats, a duck and a Romanian nanny (Kane). Soon Shane's over his head in chaos, with frequent visits to the school principals (Graham and Garrett).After opening with a big action sequence, we pretty much know that there'll be at least two more: one in the middle to remind us of the threat and one at the end to tie up loose ends. And there's not a single thread left untied. Including the duck. This is such a heavily structured script that there's no doubt at all about what will happen, so we're left to enjoy the details. And at least there's a lot of goofy fun to be had along the way. It's not particularly clever or original, but it's lively and energetic and sometimes just a little inspired.The three older kids turn out to be superb actors--all have strong scenes that show surprising depth for this kind of movie. And they prove to be adept on-screen foils for Diesel's muscle-man act. Diesel wisely avoids hamming it up, allowing the filmmakers to poke gentle fun at his beefy physicality (on the other hand, the gratuitous scene in which he walks around the house in nothing but a towel would, in real life, spark a lawsuit of Jacko proportions). There's not nearly enough of Kane; and the extremely game Garrett is only on screen to be humiliated time and time again, including one scene that's surprisingly mean-spirited.

633896,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNQG,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[1, 2]","Every once in a while, the movie industry does something so weird that you are forced to wonder what was going on the day some executive okayed the idea.  Was the L. A. smog particular poisonous or something?  For the most part, these bizarre movie ideas (example: ""Hey!  Let's make ANOTHER movie about an enchanted racing Volkswagen Beetle!"") turn out to be total duds, but every so often, these crazy plots actually turn into something remotely resembling a good movie.  Such is the case here, where tough action star Vin Diesel is thrown into a silly family comedy.On the surface, ""The Pacifier"" seems like a really dumb idea: Putting an action movie tough guy in charge of a bunch of kids in a goofy family movie.  And deep down, it is.  But for whatever reason, it works- occasionally.Shane Wolfe (Diesel) is a hard-edged Navy SEAL who is tasked with protecting the family of a (now-murdered) scientist from those who would try to hurt them.  It seems this scientist invented some kind of ballistic missile scrambler, which all manner of nasty types want for themselves.  What, exactly, is with Disney's fascination with ingenious scientists who invent truly incredible things, but live in normal American suburbia?  Isn't there one of those in nearly every Disney action/comedy ever made?  Anyway, as is completely expected, Wolfe is left to fend for himself, while the scientist's widow heads for Geneva to, yes, get into his safe deposit box which contains, supposedly, the vital technology.  She's only supposed to be gone for a couple of days, but it turns out to be more like several weeks, because (this is so pathetic) she can't guess the password to access the deposit box.  You'd think after about, I don't know, a day or so of guessing wrong passwords, the bank people would toss her out.So, Wolfe must take care of a rather large clan of kids, including a boy-crazy teenage girl, a surly teenage boy, an irresistibly cute little girl, a couple of younglings, and for no apparent reason: a duck.  And just like that, (that was the intent anyway), hilarity ensues.  To be honest, there are some pretty funny moments here, but nothing too spectacular.  Mostly it's just an overabundance of diaper humor, a given when dealing with several young kids, but enough is enough.  No need to be disgusting.  It was pretty amusing to see the rigidly-trained SEAL trying to deal with a bunch of unruly kids on his militaristic terms, even when it was stuff like Girl Scouts.  One of the funnier moments is Vin Diesel getting ready to take the kids out by wearing baby bottles like grenades and juice boxes like ammo cartridges.What I found most interesting however, was that there actually was a sufficient amount of action in this family comedy.  You can't completely take Vin Diesel away from the fight.  The opening credits sequence had enough explosions and guns going off to get MY attention.

Boy, have you seen this storyline time and time again.  It's your typical fish-out-of-the-water scenario, where a Navy seal (Diesel) is placed in a situation that he is not ""comfortable or suited"" (i.e. care provider of five kids).The movie opens with LT Wolfe on a search and rescue mission, in which, he blotches.  The victim is killed, and Wolfe is injured.  The film fast-forwards two months, Wolfe has fully recovered and back on the mission; however, there's one small exception, he must now ensure the safety of the Plummer children.  Dr. Plummer, who was killed earlier in the film, has developed the ""GHOST"" program which can prevent foreigner threats from launching their nuclear armaments by changing their launch codes.  The only problem is that no one knows where the program has been hidden.  Wolfe's secondary mission is to search the Plummer house as well providing security.As in all these films, Wolfe struggles initially; however, by the end of the film, everything always seems to work out.

But soon he is taken out of water and plunged into a household (the family of the widow of his failed Navy Seal opening mission) where is uncomfortably cast in the role of babysitter/house mom/inept disciplinarian - you know the oft repeated situation of 'fish out of water'.The whole thing is rather silly and overplayed and Diesel is a charmer, but a comedian he is not.

With THE PACIFIER Vin Diesel joins the ranks of tough film action stars who strove to soften their hard-boiled images by co-starring in family friendly flicks with cutesy kids. THE PACIFIER, no, it won't blow anyone away with taut plotting or surprising twists or electrifying characterizations or anything like so. This flick pretty much falls into that category of been there, done that, nothing new here. That I ended up liking it is due more to the unexpected sight of Vin Diesel playing nanny to five incorrigible children. Naturally, the kids start out being bratty and subversive, that is, until Diesel's brand of tough love eventually gets them all squared-away. Far-fetched, you say? Heck, yeah! But fun? I would say, yes.Vin Diesel plays U.S. Navy Seal Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, and no one is harder-than-nails than this squid. Doesn't mean he's not infallible. When Shane muffs a rescue ops by getting a key scientist killed, he gets a chance to atone by babysitting the dead scientist's five kids while their mom (Faith Ford) is away on a government assignment overseas. But Shane learns quick that he's got the parenting skills of a spoon, and that surveillance cameras, tracking devices, and enforced military discipline don't sit too well with traumatized children who had just lost their dad. Still, military regs are all Shane knows and so he persists in dispensing MREs and doling out code names (dubbing the kids ""Red One,"" ""Red Two,"" and so on all the way down to ""Red Baby""). Obviously, this can only lead to prankish shenanigans.Vin Diesel and the Maryland suburbs go together like... well, they don't go together. And that's the humor of it. THE PACIFIER is partly a conventional Disney family film, partly a mild action thriller, and partly a fish-out-of-water story, and it's this last part which most makes the thing watchable. In his child-minding assignment, Shane Wolfe ends up being Den Mother to a bunch of girl scouts, the director to an amateur production of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and engages in a chase while riding a little girl's pink bicycle. Things get so preposterous that, later on, when ninjas show up, you just kinda roll with it. Oh, and there's also a homicidal duck somewheres.Vin Diesel's stiffness actually works in his favor this time. He doesn't quite have that flair for slapstick, but he's so earnest in his pratfalls that the guy is actually endearing. Call me a sucker, but there's something pretty neat about a rugged, menacing-looking dude like the Diesel rendered all mushy by adorable tots. But, man, I can live without seeing yet one more dirty diaper gag in these kinds of movies.Lauren Graham (GILMORE GIRLS) plays the attractive head school principal and Diesel's platonic love interest. Carol Kane's Romanian nanny (I think she's Romanian) is only in for a bit, but I like Carol Kane and think she's pretty funny. Brad Garrett is always funny, and he steals every scene as the offensive vice principal who's also an objectionable wrestling coach. He's an utter tool in this one, but I can't hate on him. He's just a funny, hairy guy. Of the kids in this film, the one to watch is Morgan York as the wiseacre Lulu. She develops the best chemistry with Vin.THE PACIFIER goes down nice and easy if all you're looking for is an uncomplicated watch or maybe something wholesome enough to occupy the kids at home. Vin Diesel as an uncompromising Navy Seal-turned-frantic babysitter makes for a nice change of pace, and sometimes I guess you just get in the mood to watch a beefy, growly dude sorting it out with a gaggle of cute, unruly kids. Tough guy Charles Bronson starred in YES, VIRGINIA, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS. Heck, even Kenny Rogers tried it with SIX PACK.

The Pacifier surely wasn't a better option.Anyway, much like Arnold Schwarzanegger doing ""Kindergarten Cop"", Sly Stallone doing ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot"", and Pacino doing ""Scent of a Woman"", Vin Diesel sold his acting sole for the almighty dollar.Now his grisled voice makes him sound less like a tough guy, and more like a someone from Dateline's ""To Catch A Predator"".  Great.I'm not even sure I watched the entire movie because the sheer vapid nature and banality of this movie caused me to go into a boredom-coma.  What I did catch, however, was the fact that Diesel plays a former Navy Seal who is assigned to protect some spoiled brats who deserve a beating.

The other thing I noticed was that Vin Diesel is incredibly unfunny, and has probably never told a successful joke in his life.

Shane Wolfe (VIN DIESEL) is a Navy SEAL who's been trained to deal with most any situation he might encounter while serving his country. He rescued Howard Plummer (TATE DONOVAN), a kidnapped government scientist When Shane lets down his guard by allowing Howard to call home, the scientist is assassinated.Two months later, after Shane heals from a `battle wound', he is ready to reassume SEAL duties, but Capt. Bill Fawcett (CHRIS POTTER) informs him of a new mission. While Fawcett accompanies Howard's widow, Julie (FAITH FORD), to open a safety deposite box overseas, Shane must watch Julie's kids while search for a computer program. He must keep the kids safe, basically. Considering his background and the fact that the family's nanny, Helga (CAROL KANE), is still there, Shane figures this will be an easy assignment. He is wrong.Zoe (BRITTANY SNOW) and Seth (MAX THIERIOT) Lulu (MORGAN YORK) and Peter (KEEGAN & LOGAN HOOVER), and Baby Tyler's (BO AND LUKE VINK) are the kids, and they are quite a handful, even for a SEAL. The kids make life extra hard for Shane.Character Development----I think that character development, as well as the plot, is what really made this movie a let down. There wasn't any. First one thing's happening and then the other, without much background. For example (this might 'ruin' the ending, so please skip) the two Korean neighors are shown in one-two scenes until the end of the movie. Two people break into the house at one point. At the end of the movie, (in the safe beneath the garage) the two criminals who broke into the house are shown to be the neighbors who are Korean spies.

Now the government wants to get the scientist's work by takinging the wife to a Swiss vault.  Diesel is assigned to guard the rest of the family for the two days the mother is away.  It should be an easy assignment but this is no ordinary family.  The kids are nothing but trouble (at home and at school) and the nanny gives up.  To make matters worse, the mother's trip gets extended.  Now Diesel is in for the long haul in an area he has no experience with.We get plenty of scenes of Diesel being dumbfounded by civilians and their lack of discipline.  But eventually Diesel begins to deal with the issues one by one.  There are the individual kids, the scouts, school, the principal and vice-principal, sports teams and even enemy agents after the scientist's work.  Eventually Diesel rises to the top as things are put straight.Diesel's inflexible military ways really take a beating for the civilian influence in this movie.

633947,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00005JNQG,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[6, 7]","Initially, before watching this movie, I was unsure as to whether I would enjoy it or not, depending on Vin Diesel's performance. However, after watching this movie, I found it very entertaining, and was glad that I saw it.The story starts off with Lt. Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) and his team trying to rescue Dr. Plummer, a scientist who is being held hostage by Bosnian terrorists for inventing some kind of a new gadget GHOST. Shane succeeds in saving Dr. Plummer, but something happens in the last minute, because of which Plummer is killed. After a few days, Shane is given a new assignment: to guard Plummer's children (since the bad guys are still searching for the GHOST program and suspect that it could be in the Plummer house)  while his widow (Faith Ford) goes to Zurich to reclaim possessions of her husband. Shane hates taking care of the children in the beginning, especially after the maid Helga runs away, but soon, things change, and he starts becoming closer to them.The movie is a little slow during the first few minutes, but quickly picks up when Vin Diesel starts babysitting the Plummer children. Even though we know how the movie is going to turn out eventually (since it's a Walt Disney one), it is nevertheless, still fun to watch Vin Diesel take on a different role from his usual stuff, and show a different side of himself. Along with that, various scenes in this movie were hilarious, some of them which were: (a) when Shane changes the diaper on the baby for the first time (b) the way Helga leaves the house in the beginning leaving Shane to do all the housework (c) The wrestling match between Shane and the Vice Principal, and (d) The way the girl scouts get back at their nemesis for messing up their cookies. Acting-wise, I think everyone acted well for their role, especially the kids. Lauren Graham played her role well, even though she didn't have much of one, and Brad Garrett, of course, is highly entertaining to watch and played his part well.Overall, this movie has a little something for everyone, and it succeeds in delivering what it intended to do: providing a good family comedy.",5,Slow at first but quickly catches up..,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2127,"['Initially', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'unsure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'not', 'depending', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'performance', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', 'glad', 'saw', 'it.The', 'story', 'Lt.', 'Shane', 'Wolfe', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'team', 'trying', 'rescue', 'Dr.', 'Plummer', 'scientist', 'who', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'Bosnian', 'terrorists', 'inventing', 'kind', 'new', 'gadget', 'GHOST', 'Shane', 'saving', 'Dr.', 'Plummer', 'something', 'happens', 'last', 'minute', 'Plummer', 'killed', 'few', 'days', 'Shane', 'given', 'new', 'assignment', 'guard', 'Plummer', 'children', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'still', 'searching', 'GHOST', 'program', 'suspect', 'could', 'be', 'Plummer', 'house', 'widow', 'Faith', 'Ford', 'Zurich', 'reclaim', 'possessions', 'husband', 'Shane', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'beginning', 'especially', 'maid', 'Helga', 'away', 'soon', 'things', 'change', 'becoming', 'closer', 'them.The', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'up', 'when', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'babysitting', 'Plummer', 'children', 'Even', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'eventually', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'one', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'watch', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'take', 'different', 'role', 'usual', 'stuff', 'show', 'different', 'side', 'various', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'hilarious', 'were', 'when', 'Shane', 'diaper', 'baby', 'first', 'time', 'b', 'way', 'Helga', 'house', 'beginning', 'leaving', 'Shane', 'do', 'housework', 'c', 'wrestling', 'match', 'Shane', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'd', 'way', 'girl', 'get', 'back', 'nemesis', 'messing', 'up', 'cookies', 'Acting-wise', 'think', 'everyone', 'acted', 'well', 'role', 'especially', 'kids', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'one', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'course', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'played', 'part', 'well.Overall', 'movie', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'delivering', 'what', 'intended', 'do', 'providing', 'good', 'family', 'comedy']",The Pacifier

633954,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B00005JNQG,R. Kyle,"[27, 28]","Vin Diesel had a choice when ""Pacifier"" was offered to him.  He could star in this low-budget release or return for ""XXX State of the Union.""  Mr. Diesel opted to do ""Pacifier"" because he'd have the opportunity to make a film that his children could watch and enjoy with him--unlike his previous releases which he considered too violent.Surprise, ""Pacifier"" isn't just for kids.  While there is a ""family feel"" to the film, there's enough action and suspense to keep the adults on the edge of their seats.  Besides, the whole film is surprisingly funny as well.Vin Diesel stars as a Special Ops soldier who lost a famous scientist on a mission.  When he's assigned to guard the scientists' children while their mother is away, Diesel is triply determined to make sure the kids are safe.  The children pose their own problems:  the son dresses as a Nazi (turns out he's secretly gotten a part in ""Sound of Music""), the daughter is having problems learning to drive, the baby just really doesn't know what's happening.  Everyone's traumatized by the loss of their father--and having such a rough-and-ready guardian is hard on all of them.  But, they band together when the family's at risk.Overall, an excellent film with a lot of good messages for children.  Plus, a lot of laughs.  Kudos to Vin Diesel.  This little-known film actually shows a lot of depth in his ability to act that we have not seen before.",5,Congrats to Vin Diesel and the whole crew!,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,1408,"['Vin', 'Diesel', 'had', 'choice', 'when', 'Pacifier', 'was', 'offered', 'could', 'star', 'low-budget', 'release', 'return', 'XXX', 'State', 'Union', 'Mr.', 'Diesel', 'opted', 'do', 'Pacifier', ""'d"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'make', 'film', 'children', 'could', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'previous', 'releases', 'considered', 'too', 'violent.Surprise', 'Pacifier', ""n't"", 'just', 'kids', 'family', 'feel', 'film', 'enough', 'action', 'suspense', 'keep', 'adults', 'edge', 'seats', 'Besides', 'whole', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'well.Vin', 'Diesel', 'stars', 'Special', 'Ops', 'soldier', 'who', 'lost', 'famous', 'scientist', 'mission', 'When', 'assigned', 'guard', 'scientists', 'children', 'mother', 'away', 'Diesel', 'triply', 'determined', 'make', 'sure', 'kids', 'are', 'safe', 'children', 'pose', 'own', 'problems', 'son', 'Nazi', 'out', 'secretly', 'gotten', 'part', 'Sound', 'Music', 'daughter', 'having', 'problems', 'learning', 'drive', 'baby', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'Everyone', 'traumatized', 'loss', 'father', 'having', 'such', 'rough-and-ready', 'guardian', 'hard', 'band', 'together', 'when', 'family', 'risk.Overall', 'excellent', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'messages', 'children', 'lot', 'laughs', 'Kudos', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'little-known', 'film', 'actually', 'lot', 'depth', 'ability', 'act', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'before']",The Pacifier
633955,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JNQG,RMurray847,"[4, 6]","Yes, this is an inane movie.  It was pretty much marketed perfectly.  If you have seen the trailers at the movies or the ads on TV, you know you're getting a movie tough guy (Vin Diesel), playing against type as a reluctant softie (a la KINDERGARTEN COP).  He bonds with a bunch of kids, we enjoy some obvious diaper jokes, and watch as the kids go from hating him to loving him.  Meanwhile, some well-known television actors eagerly add movie credits to their resumes in thankless roles.  We laugh about 10 times, walk out, and immediately forget it.If you walk IN expecting more, I feel sorry for you.  There was nothing deceptive about the marketing.  It properly lowers expectations.I won't rehash the plot (again, the previews pretty much give it to you).  Vin Diesel gamely assails the role of hard-hearted guy melted by those weaker than him (see ARE WE THERE YET or MAN OF THE HOUSE for VERY recent examples).  He really isn't much of an actor, but he does manage a few cute reactions to the shenanigans of the kids.  He gets to use his military training to try to whip the kids into shape, with predictably silly results.  Poor Vin, I think he peaked with PITCH BLACK, became famous with FAST AND THE FURIOUS, and has been on a downward spiral ever since.  The box office success of this movie should in no way be an indication that his career is revitalized.  It's unlikely he could get away with a similar role again...how many times can he make fun of his persona when no one cares that much about his persona in the first place?It's all mindless, and pointless.  The kids have recently lost their father, and yet they seem to show no grief.  Yeah, the act out a little bit around Vin, but it doesn't seem to be anything worse than a little teen peevishness.  When they finally believe their lives are in danger, they change their behavior by being a little nicer to Vin.  Do they stay home and away from activities?  No!  Do they perhaps even stay home from school for a day or two?  Nope.  We buy absolutely none of it.Faith Ford (TV personality trying a movie role) is completely wasted in the mother role.  She has no personality, nothing funny to do...zip.  Lauren Graham (GILMORE GIRLS) is the school principal, and we see brief flashes of charisma, but basically, the role is a device.  She's certainly better in BAD SANTA. And Brad Garrett (EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND), as the villainous wrestling coach, is a one-dimensional character whose comeuppance is not as fun as it should have been.The only surprising thing in the movie were some clumsy but still amusing scenes related to THE SOUND OF MUSIC.

You've got the single-male-raising-kids thing from Three Men and a Baby (including, yes, the diaper-changing scene), you've got the buddy-cop thing, you've got the international-intrigue thing, you've got the romantic-entanglement thing, you've got... well, all sorts of things. It all works relatively well, surprisingly.Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel of Pitch Black fame) is a Navy SEAL who's been laid up in the hospital after a snatch-and-grab went bad, resulting in the death of its target, Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan, presently in The O.C.). Upon his release from the hospital, Wolfe is informed that the project Plummer was working on is still MIA, but that it might be in a safety deposit box in Switzerland. Plummer's wife (Faith Ford of Murphy Brown) and Wolfe's boss (Chris Potter of Wild Card) are off to Switzerland to get the box, and Wolfe is left to look after Plummer's five kids. Cue hilarity.Yeah, it's predictable, and you've seen all these jokes before. Under the surface, however, Shankman is doing a very good job of connecting all those things mentioned above into one coherent narrative, and he does it very well. There is some good attention to detail paid in the movie, and it all sets up rather like a game of Mousetrap (for those of you old enough to remember the game Mousetrap, anyway). It's stupid, but it's fun, and surprisingly enough, it does contain a few surprises.

This is the vehicle starring Vin Diesel as a baby sitter/Navy seal/talent director...This is also one of the films that makes no sense if you start asking questions about it, or wonder how one sequence led to another. I can't fault the actor too much. He had been out of a job, presumably, for requesting too much money, and this Jackie Chan reject for Disney was a step up. Let's see--as a Navy Seal, he is directly involved in the death of a man who is important to National Security. As a result, he has to take care of the guy's kids, while Mom has to search a bank vault in Switzerland...And the more you continue to dig into the plot, the less sense it makes.

But Diesel, a tough guy who has been trained to take on the baddest dudes imaginable (and a man with apparently only one t-shirt to his name), finds he has gotten more than he bargained for in this latest assignment.""The Pacifier"" pretty much goes straight for all the garden variety, lowbrow slapstick routines one would expect from such a corny setup.  Yet, the movie generates a surprising number of genuinely charming moments, thanks mainly to Vin Diesel himself who, though still not an actor, manages to convey a certain befuddled innocence that works well in this part.  There are some perfectly awful scenes in the closing stretches that work hard to erase much of the goodwill the movie has managed to generate up to that point, but if you can look past the badness and you're in a forgiving mood, you might not hold them against the entire film.  When all is said and done, it's not really much of a movie, but it's at least better than the genuinely dreadful ""Daddy Day Care"" and the two ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films.And I sure would like to know what magical spot-removal product Diesel used to get that mustard stain out of that white t-shirt.

However, I will criticize it for its lack of originality. This has all been done before in other movies. It borrowed a lot from the movie ""Major Payne"" (a way superior movie) plus it had stuff from other movies like Mr. mom, and home alone. The characters in the movie also have no depth, they are very superficial. They were pretty much there just to be there. It's a movie you will watch and then never watch again. It is definitely a movie not too many adults are going to repeatedly watch. It just lacked ideas. However, it did make my son laugh several times. So from a kids perspective, I guess it's not all that bad, even though I didn't care for it.Side Note: I actually have a bone to pick with Disney: I am so sick of Disney's subjective censorship in their movies. They are hypocrites! Let me explain: I watched the new ""where the red fern grows"" and Disney took it upon itself to edit all the gun fire out of the movie (and it's a movie about hunting), they edited all the violence to the point that you have to rewind the movie a couple times to make heads are tales out of a bad editing scene where a boy dies. They also edited the violence out of the dog fighting with the mountain lion scene; it was so bad that it actually looks like a stuffed animal fight. So Disney likes to edit out any thing it finds ""questionable"" or ""offensive, YET IN THIS MOVIE, Disney found it ""ok"" to encourage children to fight, be violent, and setup traps that could actually kill someone. Disney also found it ""ok"" that this movie uses terms like ""boobs"" (repeatedly) and uses a wrestling move term called a ""nipple crippler"" these are terms taken straight from this movie.

That is exactly what makes this film so funny.  He is out of his element.  He isn't trying to be funny.  The humor is in the tough guy being saddled with watching these bratty kids.  He's tough throughout most of this film despite all the silliness that goes on around him.  This heightens the humor.The supporting cast sparkles with Brittany Snow as the oldest daughter, her tearful scene with Diesel is well acted and believable, and Brad Garrett as the vice principal is nothing less than hysterical.  He steals every scene he's in.  In addition, Lauren Graham and Faith Ford are always a pleasure to watch and I wish they had even more to do in this film.  The rest of the cast lends fine support as well.The plot is not meant to be taken seriously, but when Vin Diesel decides to direct ""The Sound of Music"" for a small playhouse for one of the kids he's watching we are really stretching things too much.  It's a very silly segment in the film, but tolerable if not funny to some.  The segment adds nothing much to the film and could have been edited out even though I do like how it closes out the film.No matter how many times I sit down and watch this with my family, we enjoy it and have a good laugh.

I didn't enjoy it too much, but then again I am a 24 year old without children.My first problem with the movie is that the father of the family dies in the opening sequence, leaving a widow and a family without a father. Vin Diesel is supposed to watch over the family while the mother goes out of town to open the dead father's lock box and find out what he left behind. Right after the father's death, we see the family and they don't seem to be very bothered by the death. In fact, with the exception of a COUPLE of scenes, the father isn't really mentioned (other than the fact that he created this ghost system the bad guys really want). It seems that his death was just so we could have hilarity involving a Navy Seal out of water story. And that kind of bothers me. I just don't see a family bouncing back so quickly; it almost appears as if the father doesn't matter except that it pushes the story along.The other mainstay of the movie is it's continual feces-based jokes. Whether its Vin Diesel diving in sewer water and emerging feces-soaked, Vin Diesel changing diapers (with tools no less), Vin Diesel diving into a ball pen to retrieve a dirty diaper, and other assorted fart jokes, the movie is filled with cliched poop.One comic area that actually worked for me was Helga, the Transylvanian accented help maid (after falling downstairs, another joke) who ends up leaving early. There were a few more areas that were pretty funny, but overall it's been done before in children comedy and done much better.This movie is like a 21st century Kindergarten Cop. Except Kindergarten Cop was more funny (and I didn't care too much for it either). All said, it was mildly entertaining, and judging from the current films out there right now it's probably one of the better family films out. Just not as good as I was hoping. Maybe a little less poop jokes and more funny would have helped",2,Lackluster,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1959,"[""'m"", 'trying', 'look', 'perspective', 'family', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'again', 'am', '24', 'year', 'old', 'children.My', 'first', 'problem', 'movie', 'father', 'family', 'opening', 'sequence', 'leaving', 'widow', 'family', 'father', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'supposed', 'watch', 'family', 'mother', 'town', 'open', 'dead', 'father', 'lock', 'box', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'left', 'behind', 'Right', 'father', 'death', 'see', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'bothered', 'death', 'fact', 'exception', 'COUPLE', 'scenes', 'father', ""n't"", 'really', 'mentioned', 'other', 'fact', 'created', 'ghost', 'system', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'want', 'death', 'was', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'hilarity', 'involving', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'water', 'story', 'kind', 'bothers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'family', 'bouncing', 'back', 'so', 'quickly', 'almost', 'father', ""n't"", 'matter', 'story', 'other', 'mainstay', 'movie', 'continual', 'feces-based', 'jokes', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'diving', 'sewer', 'water', 'emerging', 'feces-soaked', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'changing', 'diapers', 'tools', 'less', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'diving', 'ball', 'pen', 'retrieve', 'dirty', 'diaper', 'other', 'assorted', 'fart', 'jokes', 'movie', 'filled', 'cliched', 'poop.One', 'comic', 'area', 'actually', 'worked', 'was', 'Helga', 'Transylvanian', 'accented', 'help', 'maid', 'falling', 'downstairs', 'joke', 'who', 'up', 'leaving', 'early', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'areas', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'overall', 'been', 'done', 'children', 'comedy', 'done', 'much', 'better.This', 'movie', '21st', 'century', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Except', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'was', 'more', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'said', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'judging', 'current', 'films', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'family', 'films', 'out', 'Just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'hoping', 'Maybe', 'little', 'less', 'poop', 'jokes', 'more', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'helped']",The Pacifier

And as to the jokes, there are plenty of them, and the clever duck is also funny to see.Another good thing about the film is some of the relative newcomers.  Among the kids, Morgan York playing precocious little girl Lulu is a real find.  The director must have known it, for the film spends considerable time in showing her character.  Surely his decision is justified.[BAD THINGS] But there is something I do not like about the film.  Though the death(s) are not directly shown, they are suggested, and the family who need Vin's protection in fact suffer from the death of the father.  Isn't that unnecessary in making family pictures?In addition to this, there are many ill-advised decisions.  Now let me count, 1)  bullying wrestling coach (Brad Garrett) who is simply there to be despised  2) Helga, babysitting lady with intentionally heavy accent played by Carol Kane who looks like coming from 'The Addams Family'  and 3) the 'ninja' idea which should have been dead back in the 80s.  Oh, and 4)  the suddenly introduced ""love interest"" (school principal played by Lauren Graham) for Vin Diesel, which is far from convincing.But the best way to describe the quality of 'The Pacifier' is to take a look at the CV of director Adam Shankman, which who has done J-Lo's unremarkable romantic comedy 'The Wedding Planner,' sweet but melodramatic 'Walk to Remember' and 'Bringing Down the House' so-so Steve Martin comedy.  They are all commercially successful, but there are nothing particularly outstanding about them.  Though it is fun to see, 'The Pacifier' does not change my impressions about his films.",3,"Typically Disney, For Better Or For Worse ...

The Pacifier was surely my pacifier as it lulled me into a peaceful sleep the first time I watched the movie. I forced myself to stay awake on the second try.  While some actors are gifted with the ability of versatility, Diesel should stick with action or dramatic films. He is no comedian and it is all too evident here. His superstar appeal could not carry the burden of a run-away script, an empty plot, and poor editing. The rest of the cast is okay at best.I thought the blooper reel would be The Pacifier's saving grace - no dice.  The ""outrageous"" bloopers (as stated on the jacket) are not great at all. They are mainly a few line trips that even the cast didn't particularly find extremely amusing.I gave this movie one star for effort.  If Vin Diesel promises to work on his comedic skills - verbal and non-verbal - I promise to try again. But as for this one...it's going up for sale with the 152 others above.

The family's original Dad was a secret scientist, and was assassinated before he revealed all of his secrets. Mom, mostly in the dark about Dad's work, is out trying to recover something left in a Swiss safe deposit box - safe even from her. Vin's job is to guard the kids while Mom's away.It's pretty predictable after that. There's the encounter with the Dirty Diaper, trying to figure out how to feed the family when they turn down military meal packs (""You expect me to eat all those carbs?"" complains the teen girl), shopping, girl scout-like meetings, and the trials of school. There are other trials, like when the boy is found with an Aryan hair dye and a swastika arm band. The biggest trial may be yours, when you're asked to believe that military unarmed combat is glorified pro wrestling. Don't worry, though, this is just a feel-good comedy where everything works towards a happy, sappy ending.I wouldn't go out of my way to see this one again, but I wouldn't run if I saw it coming on the screen. (Well, I saw it in a plane at 35,000 feet - running would have created other problems.) It's the McDonalds of movies: predictable, mostly digestible, just what you want when you don't want to think about it, but not really memorable.
