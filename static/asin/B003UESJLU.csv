Stephen Dorff does an excellent job and is highly believable, since he is not (yet) so famous, where this would end up another episode of TMZ. Although the movie is slow at times, like a great Cabernet from the Coppola estate, you can enjoy it slowly develop into some interesting interactions on screen. Luckily for the viewer, Sofia has made her own experiences, which come to life her like they did in Lost in translation.If you want to see, how dating and life in New York City was during the times of decadence and endless harmless fun, please check out the Manhattan Dating Project.",4,Setting for Californication?,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,722,"['like', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'wonder', 'inspired', 'season', 'Californication', 'also', 'set', 'hip', 'Chateau', 'Marmont', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'excellent', 'job', 'highly', 'believable', 'not', 'yet', 'so', 'famous', 'where', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'episode', 'TMZ', 'movie', 'slow', 'times', 'great', 'Cabernet', 'Coppola', 'estate', 'can', 'enjoy', 'slowly', 'develop', 'interesting', 'interactions', 'screen', 'Luckily', 'viewer', 'Sofia', 'made', 'own', 'experiences', 'come', 'life', 'did', 'Lost', 'translation.If', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'dating', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'times', 'decadence', 'endless', 'harmless', 'fun', 'please', 'check', 'out', 'Manhattan', 'Dating', 'Project']",N/A

1365630,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003UESJLU,Andrew Ellington,"[22, 28]","Being the fan of Sophia Coppola that I am, `Somewhere' was my most anticipated film from last year.  I literally could not wait to see it, so much so that I downloaded it to my computer months before it was released in theaters near me so that I could watch it.For me, `Somewhere' doesn't quite live up to my expectations.First things first, this is not a bad film at all.  In fact, it is a very good film.  Some of my friends have noted that they feel this is Coppola's most mature offering, and in many ways I totally agree.  She has a beautiful knack for fleshing out the humanity in her stories with such graceful subtlety.  She masters that here, allowing the fluid movement of the scenes to do most of the talking.  While some would make sweeping statements that this is, `by far', we worst film, I can only half agree.  While she shows definite maturity here, this is my least favorite of her films.  In that same respect though, I can't say `by far' since the film is a very good film.  I just found it too familiar. Coppola often regurgitates similar themes in her films, but she manages to make them feel fresh and unique to her own style. She doesn't quite manage that here. It drips with style (it is beautiful to look at and it moves with the grace and fluidity that we expect from Coppola) but it feels too rehashed to be anything monumentally moving. It felt like 'Lost in Translation' lite. I really liked it, and the performances are beautifully detailed, but the film itself reaches short of the greatness I was expecting.The idea of being lost within your own life and trying to find an outlet, anything really to save you from yourself, is a great idea, but Sophia has done that four times over now and it shows on this film that she is running out of ways to make it feel soulfully individualized.This just felt somewhat halfhearted.And yet, I can't help but admit that had `Lost in Translation' not been released on '03 I'd probably be lauding this particular film as a masterpiece and placing it at the top of my personal ballot for Best Picture last year.  Like I said, it's very good, but it is also very familiar.But, one cannot overlook the glorious Elle Fanning and her marvelous contribution to this film.  In fact, I would hand her a win over ANY of Oscar's nominated supporting actresses; in a heartbeat.  I'm just going to post straight from a piece I wrote about her performance on my blog back in January.""In Sophia Coppola's latest entry, `Somewhere', she cast the `other' Fanning girl, Elle, to play a fictional variation of herself (or I assume as much).  While Coppola is one of my favorite working directors, I must say that the familiar nature of `Somewhere' was a tad underwhelming for me.  That said; the naturally organic presence of Elle Fanning utterly blew me away.  By merely doing nothing at all, Fanning does SO much with this character.  Playing Cleo, the young daughter to Hollywood megastar Johnny Marco, Fanning isn't discomfited by her father's world.  She isn't afraid to call a spade a spade (that stare at the breakfast table was superbly executed) and yet she realizes the nature of the world in which her father dwells and so she allocates herself to it with childlike ease.  The construction of a Coppola film is already wildly organic in tone (it just flows in such a sublimely effortless manner) but Fanning adds so much weight to the film by relaxing right into the pace.  Her character arc may seem oddly anticlimactic (also the signature ways of the director) but there is the sting of her presence that never quite goes away.  You can feel her spirit moving her father to contemplate his own footsteps, and you understand why.  It is less the notion that a child can reconstruct a parent and more the understanding that THIS child is something special to THAT parent.  There is such intimacy presented in this performance (as well as Dorff's).In fact, dwelling on Fanning's performance is making me appreciate the film more than I initially thought I did.""In the end, I like this movie and I highly recommend it.  Sophia Coppola is a masterful director and I cannot wait to see what she delivers to us next.  She understands the beauty of the human spirit and she weaves magic out of simplicity, which is something most directors don't bother to consider.  I want her to branch out on her next project though.  I want to see her step outside her comfort zone and prove to the world that she isn't one-track minded.  I know she has more in her.  As it is, she ranks very high for me and is probably one of my top five working directors today.  With a little spice she could easily become number one.",4,Not quite over the rainbow...,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,4664,"['Being', 'fan', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'am', 'Somewhere', 'was', 'most', 'anticipated', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'literally', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'downloaded', 'computer', 'months', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'could', 'watch', 'it.For', 'Somewhere', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations.First', 'things', 'first', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'friends', 'have', 'noted', 'feel', 'Coppola', 'most', 'mature', 'offering', 'many', 'ways', 'totally', 'agree', 'beautiful', 'knack', 'fleshing', 'out', 'humanity', 'stories', 'such', 'graceful', 'subtlety', 'here', 'allowing', 'fluid', 'movement', 'scenes', 'do', 'most', 'talking', 'would', 'make', 'sweeping', 'statements', 'far', 'worst', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'half', 'agree', 'definite', 'maturity', 'here', 'least', 'favorite', 'films', 'same', 'respect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'far', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'found', 'too', 'familiar', 'Coppola', 'often', 'similar', 'themes', 'films', 'make', 'feel', 'fresh', 'unique', 'own', 'style', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'here', 'style', 'beautiful', 'look', 'grace', 'fluidity', 'expect', 'Coppola', 'too', 'rehashed', 'be', 'anything', 'monumentally', 'moving', 'felt', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'lite', 'really', 'liked', 'performances', 'are', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'film', 'short', 'greatness', 'was', 'expecting.The', 'idea', 'being', 'lost', 'own', 'life', 'trying', 'find', 'outlet', 'anything', 'really', 'save', 'great', 'idea', 'Sophia', 'done', 'four', 'times', 'over', 'now', 'film', 'running', 'out', 'ways', 'make', 'feel', 'soulfully', 'individualized.This', 'just', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'halfhearted.And', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'had', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'not', 'been', 'released', ""'03"", ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'lauding', 'particular', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'placing', 'top', 'personal', 'ballot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'last', 'year', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'very', 'familiar.But', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'overlook', 'glorious', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'marvelous', 'contribution', 'film', 'fact', 'would', 'hand', 'win', 'ANY', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'heartbeat', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'post', 'straight', 'piece', 'wrote', 'performance', 'blog', 'back', 'January', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'latest', 'entry', 'Somewhere', 'cast', 'other', 'Fanning', 'girl', 'Elle', 'play', 'fictional', 'variation', 'herself', 'assume', 'as', 'much', 'Coppola', 'one', 'favorite', 'working', 'directors', 'must', 'say', 'familiar', 'nature', 'Somewhere', 'was', 'tad', 'underwhelming', 'said', 'naturally', 'organic', 'presence', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'utterly', 'blew', 'away', 'merely', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Fanning', 'SO', 'much', 'character', 'Playing', 'Cleo', 'young', 'daughter', 'Hollywood', 'megastar', 'Johnny', 'Marco', 'Fanning', ""n't"", 'discomfited', 'father', 'world', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'call', 'spade', 'spade', 'stare', 'breakfast', 'table', 'was', 'superbly', 'executed', 'yet', 'nature', 'world', 'father', 'dwells', 'so', 'childlike', 'ease', 'construction', 'Coppola', 'film', 'already', 'wildly', 'organic', 'tone', 'just', 'such', 'sublimely', 'effortless', 'manner', 'Fanning', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'film', 'relaxing', 'right', 'pace', 'character', 'arc', 'may', 'seem', 'oddly', 'anticlimactic', 'also', 'signature', 'ways', 'director', 'sting', 'presence', 'never', 'quite', 'away', 'can', 'feel', 'spirit', 'moving', 'father', 'contemplate', 'own', 'footsteps', 'understand', 'why', 'less', 'notion', 'child', 'can', 'reconstruct', 'parent', 'more', 'understanding', 'THIS', 'child', 'something', 'special', 'parent', 'such', 'intimacy', 'presented', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Dorff', '.In', 'fact', 'dwelling', 'Fanning', 'performance', 'making', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'initially', 'thought', 'did', 'end', 'like', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'masterful', 'director', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'beauty', 'human', 'spirit', 'magic', 'simplicity', 'something', 'most', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'consider', 'want', 'branch', 'out', 'next', 'project', 'want', 'see', 'step', 'comfort', 'zone', 'prove', 'world', ""n't"", 'one-track', 'minded', 'know', 'more', 'very', 'high', 'probably', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'working', 'directors', 'today', 'little', 'spice', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'number', 'one']",N/A
1365631,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B003UESJLU,applewood,"[1, 6]","Fooled into renting it by the cover proclaiming it ""one of the year's best"", and winner of some award, I couldn't believe how bad this film actually was. I figure the only way this could have been produced was Coppola's name. I'll try not to spoil the story line but will say there is the kernel of a classic tale of cultural alienation and personal crisis and awakening hidden somewhere within. But it takes so incredibly long to find it (and it's pretty weak when it finally emerges). I felt it may appear meaningful and poignant to Hollywood insiders, but to the rest of us it's just the obvious and tedious consequence of self-absorbed indulgences. It was clear foreshadowing when the movie opened to a lone car racing around a desert track over and over, way past normal editing standards; I thought and hoped it would have more focus and relevance... right to the pale ending. (As a disclaimer, I usually love slow movies, as Wings of Desire, The Scent of Green Papayas, Babette's Feast, The Lives Of Others, Departures, The Fast Runner, The Sea Inside and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly are some of my favorites. Maybe if it was in a foreign language I'd have found it more unique and significant, but I truly doubt it.)Somewhere near the end (desperate to find some redeeming value in the film) I thought perhaps it's really all about the daughter since she is the only genuine person in the whole story - how she wants to achieve and succeed and become a productive adult, but how all her sweet innocence will be lost in the process. The problem is this (depressing but realistic) story could have been told well, even interestingly, and I'm sure it has.

This is without question a different film but it is no doubt a Sofia Coppola film. I am struck by the other reviewers and how there seems to be little common ground.

It is startling to realize that all the other people hanging around these places are hangers on, call girls or guys, wannabes, and so forth.  the more intelligent end of the movie business (writing, directing) is absent from these places.  his daughter is self reliant.  she can cook.  she can shop in a regular store. she dresses like a real person.  she likes to swim in the pools.  she keeps a journal.  she uses a computer.  she is going to camp shortly.  she reads.  she is eleven. she is real. no one else hanging around him is this self reliant and they are all adults!  after seeing this, i think anyone stuck in this life should marry the most intelligent, life loving person he or she can as a spouse and probably start having a fairly large family.  that is as normal as life will probably ever be.  oh, and get a hobby.  anything.  stamp collecting will do! such a person needs a home a lot more than call girls.and that's where the title comes from. he is nowhere.  he has no real place.  he needs to be somewhere real.i notice here at amazon that others are scoring it really low for the most part.  i think it is because it seems boring and slow when they expected to see a movie about a glamorous movie star.  well, that is her point.  THIS is the way it really is and it can be a real shock to discover that these people lead even more vacuous lives than we expected them to lead.oh, welcome back to stephen dorf, our lead character, who took a short detour into a tv series, Law & Order LA.  i'm glad he's back in film.",5,coppola knows about the reality of movie stars,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,3861,"['sophia', 'coppola', 'writer', 'director', 'francis', 'coppola', 'daughter', 'cousin', 'nicholas', 'cage', 'cousin', 'jason', 'schwartzman', 'Bored', 'Death', 'HBO', 'mother', 'talia', 'shire', 'Rocky', 'sister', 'sofia', 'was', 'married', 'director', 'spike', 'jonze', 'probably', 'known', 'one', 'movie', 'people', 'entire', 'life', 'movie', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'far', 'being', 'fascinating', 'guy', 'closer', 'being', 'total', 'zero', 'personality', 'course', 'everyone', 'who', 'barely', 'fascinating', 'sofia', 'coppola', 'devastating', 'portrait', 'top', 'actor', 'first', 'half', 'movie.i', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'might', 'miss', 'satire', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'johnny', 'played', 'stephen', 'dorf', 'unmade', 'bed', 'walking', 'around', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'bothered', 'comb', 'hair', 'change', 'clothes', 'do', 'much', 'passively', 'participate', 'twin', 'pole', 'dancers', 'asleep', 'act', 'asleep', 'sex', 'costar', 'big', 'nothing', 'women', 'text', 'complaining', 'behavior', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'following', 'can', 'sit', 'makeup', 'chair', 'hours', 'everything', 'nostrils', 'covered', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'stimulation', 'be', 'fine', 'also', 'hot', 'tubs', 'massages', 'tv', 'shows', 'FRIENDS', 'reruns', 'video', 'games', 'when', 'asked', 'meaning', 'movie', 'been', 'complete', 'blank', 'when', 'next', 'movie', 'poster', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'same', 'guy', 'driving', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'aimlessly', 'driving', 'back', 'forth', 'desert', 'asked', 'party', 'ever', 'studied', 'anyone', 'perhaps', 'method', 'school', 'acting', 'just', 'easy', 'natural', 'pretend', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'seemingly', 'so', 'little', 'personality', 'i', 'say', 'seemingly', 'whole', 'hollywood', 'lifestyle', 'put', 'deep', 'state', 'hibernation', 'only', 'real', 'person', 'can', 'bring', 'person', 'daughter', 'played', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'who', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role.the', 'one', 'thing', 'finally', 'exhibit', 'liveliness', 'daughter', 'mother', 'daughter', 'stay', 'come', 'hibernation', 'real', 'person', 'startling', 'realize', 'other', 'people', 'hanging', 'places', 'are', 'hangers', 'call', 'girls', 'guys', 'wannabes', 'so', 'forth', 'more', 'intelligent', 'end', 'movie', 'business', 'writing', 'directing', 'absent', 'places', 'daughter', 'self', 'reliant', 'can', 'cook', 'can', 'shop', 'regular', 'store', 'real', 'person', 'swim', 'pools', 'journal', 'computer', 'going', 'camp', 'shortly', 'eleven', 'real', 'one', 'else', 'hanging', 'self', 'reliant', 'are', 'adults', 'seeing', 'i', 'think', 'anyone', 'stuck', 'life', 'should', 'marry', 'most', 'intelligent', 'life', 'loving', 'person', 'can', 'spouse', 'probably', 'start', 'having', 'fairly', 'large', 'family', 'as', 'normal', 'life', 'will', 'probably', 'ever', 'be', 'oh', 'get', 'hobby', 'anything', 'stamp', 'collecting', 'will', 'do', 'person', 'home', 'lot', 'more', 'call', 'girls.and', 'where', 'title', 'nowhere', 'real', 'place', 'be', 'somewhere', 'real.i', 'notice', 'here', 'amazon', 'others', 'are', 'scoring', 'really', 'low', 'most', 'part', 'i', 'think', 'boring', 'slow', 'when', 'expected', 'see', 'movie', 'glamorous', 'movie', 'star', 'well', 'point', 'THIS', 'way', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'shock', 'discover', 'people', 'lead', 'even', 'more', 'vacuous', 'lives', 'expected', 'lead.oh', 'welcome', 'back', 'stephen', 'dorf', 'lead', 'character', 'who', 'took', 'short', 'detour', 'tv', 'series', 'Law', 'Order', 'LA', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'back', 'film']",N/A

1365637,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJLU,Chris Pandolfi,"[18, 25]","Sofia Coppola's ""Somewhere"" opens with a drawn out shot of a lonely desert road. A black sports car zooms into view, turns a corner, disappears, and after a few seconds, reappears and does the same thing over again. The driver is traveling in circles. This symbolically introduces us to Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff), a Hollywood actor living a life that goes nowhere other than back in on itself. Holed up in a room in West Hollywood's Chateau Marmont, we find a man who drinks too much, smokes too much, and knows a few too many women. Judging by a scene where he falls asleep as twin strippers do a pole dance in his bedroom, it seems he's reached the point at which being a bad boy is no longer fun. It's just empty.He occasionally gets visits from his eleven-year-old daughter, Cleo (Elle Fanning), and while they're not as close as they should be, they always manage to have a decent time together. Out of the blue, Cleo's mother (Lala Sloatman) calls Johnny and tells him that she needs a little time to herself. She will not elaborate on this, although it's clear that this so-called time to herself will not include her daughter. The time Johnny and Cleo spend together initially plays like two friends goofing off during a sleepover, but over time, more meaningful moments develop; there's no sweeping score, nor is there any emotional breakthrough that ends with a tearful hug, but there is a quiet, solemn sense that they deeply enjoy each other's company.There's also the sense that, through his daughter, Johnny has something to live for. Without her, his life is a meaningless loop of parties, premieres, and press conferences. If he ever was into the Los Angeles celebrity scene, he almost certainly isn't now. The sad thing is, most of his actions indicate that he doesn't know how to live any other way. Even the time he spends with Cleo is augmented by indulgences most of us can never hope to have access to, including helicopter rides, room service, and limo escorts. There's a moment late in the film where he says something to Cleo as she prepares to be driven to camp; although I had no doubt that he meant what he said, the fact that his words were all but drowned by an idling helicopter and the downdraft is sadly telling.This is the Sofia Coppola film I've been waiting for, and now that it has been released, I'm finally ready to forgive her ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Marie Antoinette."" At last, I can see beneath the layers and understand what she's trying to tell me. She weaves a subdued but resonant tale about those who seem to have everything and yet have nothing, about those who go through the motions but have no idea who they really are. It's said to be partially inspired by her early days as the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola. I have no way of knowing how true this is, but I suppose it doesn't really matter; it's thoughtful, intelligent, and touching, and that should be enough for anyone.One of her more interesting approaches is to let visuals do the explaining rather than dialogue. There a many scenes in which she lets the camera linger for a while on minor events. Some moments are precious while others are pointless. An example of the former: Cleo practices her ice-skating as Johnny sits in the bleachers looking at his Blackberry. An example of the latter: Johnny sitting on a couch in a darkened, quiet room drinking a beer. Most of these scenes have little to no spoken words; the film's first fifteen and a half minutes are essentially those of a silent movie. In a lesser film, we'd be inundated with sentimental sermons about how Johnny hasn't been the man he should have been and how, from now on, he'll always be there for Cleo. But this isn't a lesser film. Everything that's said - more importantly, everything that's not said - is completely within the realm of possibility.Another interesting approach is the use of symbolism, which is mostly in service of statements regarding celebrity. There's a scene in which Johnny has a cast made of his head in a makeup studio. After the makeup people leave the room to let the alginate solidify, the camera zooms in ever so slowly; apart from Johnny breathing heavily, no other sound is heard. Is this line of work suffocating him? When the scene cuts to a shot of Johnny's face made up as that of an old man, there's an unshakable sense that what he sees represents how he feels within. Couple this with a later scene, in which Johnny and Cleo attend a movie premiere in Italy; while appreciated as a movie star, communication with the press is hindered by an obvious language barrier. Is Hollywood just as foreign to him? These nuances make ""Somewhere"" not only a thoroughly engaging film, but also one of the year's most surprising.",5,"He Has Everything, and Yet He Has Nothing",1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,4744,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Somewhere', 'drawn', 'shot', 'lonely', 'desert', 'road', 'black', 'sports', 'car', 'zooms', 'view', 'corner', 'disappears', 'few', 'seconds', 'reappears', 'same', 'thing', 'again', 'driver', 'traveling', 'circles', 'symbolically', 'Johnny', 'Marco', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'living', 'life', 'nowhere', 'other', 'back', 'Holed', 'up', 'room', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'Chateau', 'Marmont', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'smokes', 'too', 'much', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'women', 'Judging', 'scene', 'where', 'asleep', 'twin', 'strippers', 'do', 'pole', 'dance', 'bedroom', 'reached', 'point', 'being', 'bad', 'boy', 'no', 'longer', 'fun', 'just', 'empty.He', 'occasionally', 'visits', 'eleven-year-old', 'daughter', 'Cleo', 'Elle', 'Fanning', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'close', 'should', 'be', 'always', 'manage', 'have', 'decent', 'time', 'together', 'blue', 'Cleo', 'mother', 'Lala', 'Sloatman', 'Johnny', 'little', 'time', 'herself', 'will', 'not', 'elaborate', 'clear', 'so-called', 'time', 'herself', 'will', 'not', 'include', 'daughter', 'time', 'Johnny', 'Cleo', 'spend', 'together', 'initially', 'two', 'friends', 'goofing', 'off', 'sleepover', 'time', 'more', 'meaningful', 'moments', 'develop', 'sweeping', 'score', 'there', 'emotional', 'breakthrough', 'tearful', 'hug', 'quiet', 'solemn', 'sense', 'deeply', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company.There', 'also', 'sense', 'daughter', 'Johnny', 'something', 'live', 'life', 'meaningless', 'loop', 'parties', 'premieres', 'press', 'conferences', 'ever', 'was', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'celebrity', 'scene', 'almost', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'now', 'sad', 'thing', 'most', 'actions', 'indicate', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'live', 'other', 'way', 'Even', 'time', 'Cleo', 'augmented', 'indulgences', 'most', 'can', 'never', 'hope', 'have', 'access', 'including', 'helicopter', 'rides', 'room', 'service', 'limo', 'escorts', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'something', 'Cleo', 'be', 'driven', 'camp', 'had', 'doubt', 'meant', 'what', 'said', 'fact', 'words', 'were', 'drowned', 'idling', 'helicopter', 'downdraft', 'sadly', 'telling.This', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'now', 'been', 'released', ""'m"", 'finally', 'ready', 'forgive', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'last', 'can', 'see', 'layers', 'understand', 'what', 'trying', 'tell', 'subdued', 'resonant', 'tale', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'everything', 'yet', 'have', 'nothing', 'who', 'go', 'motions', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'partially', 'inspired', 'early', 'days', 'daughter', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'true', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'touching', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'anyone.One', 'more', 'interesting', 'approaches', 'let', 'visuals', 'do', 'explaining', 'rather', 'dialogue', 'many', 'scenes', 'camera', 'linger', 'while', 'minor', 'events', 'moments', 'are', 'precious', 'others', 'are', 'pointless', 'example', 'former', 'Cleo', 'practices', 'ice-skating', 'Johnny', 'bleachers', 'looking', 'Blackberry', 'example', 'latter', 'Johnny', 'sitting', 'couch', 'darkened', 'quiet', 'room', 'drinking', 'beer', 'Most', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'spoken', 'words', 'film', 'first', 'fifteen', 'half', 'minutes', 'are', 'essentially', 'silent', 'movie', 'lesser', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'inundated', 'sentimental', 'sermons', 'how', 'Johnny', ""n't"", 'been', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'now', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'there', 'Cleo', ""n't"", 'lesser', 'film', 'Everything', 'said', 'more', 'importantly', 'everything', 'not', 'said', 'completely', 'realm', 'possibility.Another', 'interesting', 'approach', 'use', 'symbolism', 'mostly', 'service', 'statements', 'regarding', 'celebrity', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'cast', 'made', 'head', 'makeup', 'studio', 'makeup', 'people', 'leave', 'room', 'let', 'alginate', 'solidify', 'camera', 'zooms', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'apart', 'Johnny', 'breathing', 'heavily', 'other', 'sound', 'heard', 'line', 'work', 'suffocating', 'When', 'scene', 'cuts', 'shot', 'Johnny', 'face', 'made', 'up', 'old', 'man', 'unshakable', 'sense', 'what', 'how', 'Couple', 'later', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'Cleo', 'attend', 'movie', 'premiere', 'Italy', 'while', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'star', 'communication', 'press', 'hindered', 'obvious', 'language', 'barrier', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'foreign', 'nuances', 'make', 'Somewhere', 'not', 'only', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'year', 'most', 'surprising']",N/A

1365642,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003UESJLU,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","SOMEWHERE is a film that can be taken on several levels and depending on the willingness of the viewer to tolerate endless moments of stationary stillness it can either be a numbing bore, or it can be an intuitive examination of  a life of the rich and famous and vacuous creatures the film industry supports.  Given writer/director Sofia Coppola's personal background, it appears to this viewer that she has recreated that second stance.The setting is the decadent Chateau Marmont, still a hideaway for stars and spot for manipulative interviews of stars by the nosey media, above Sunset Strip in Hollywood.  Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a world famous movie star whose life is controlled by his PR manager Madge when he is not indulging in wild drunken parties with hired girls (he breaks his wrist early on, leaving him in a small arm cast).  He admits to a new actor wannabe that he never trained for acting, that he just was discovered and became successful, leaving education and thinking behind, or drowned in alcohol. His private persona is pathetic, yet there is something about Johnny that attracts a need for companionship.  Into this sorry state arrives his 11 year old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) who brings a sense of sparkle into Johnny's life: Cleo studies ballet and ice skating and is a mature, genuinely loving and talented daughter.  Johnny's ex-wife Layla (Lala Sloatman) informs Johnny (and Cleo) that she is leaving for an indeterminate period of time and Johnny must take Cleo to her summer camp.  But Johnny has public appearances and interviews to promote his latest feature film, requiring him to visit Milan, Italy, and Johnny simply takes Cleo along with him.  Cleo adjusts well, tolerating the extended periods of ennui and the watching of glamorous women seducing her father, and finds that something in her father that Johnny has lost - a reason to be alive.  There is no real beginning to this story and no end - it is just glimpses into a life wasted by self indulgence that has created a man with no purpose, observed by a talented daughter who must face the fact that she likely will be always baggage in the lives of both her parents, at times wanted  and at times just as casually discarded.Stephen Dorff inhabits this empty movie personality's life with surprising accuracy and Elle Fanning continues to prove that she is a growingly capable talent.  Sofia Coppola's direction could use some tightening: some frozen scenes or views linger far too long on the screen, seemingly wasting time until the next idea arises.

This is one movie that truly has people divided regarding its merits. For me, ""Somewhere"" was beguiling, fascinating, humorous and ultimately deeply moving. I suppose Sophia Coppola's films are an acquired taste but if so I can only state that those who are able to tune in to her work have great taste in movies. Coppola's screenplays are very spare, and this film follows that tradition. The storytelling that the director utilizes goes beyond a formal script but don't think for a minute that what is going on onscreen (or not going on, for that matter) is nothing at all. The characters here are utterly real, the emotions are genuine and the day to day, seemingly mundane, along with joyous and melancholy moments, create a specific point of view very unique to this filmmaker. ""Somewhere"" doesn't quite have the magic that made ""Lost In Translation' so unforgettable, but it succeeds nevertheless in creating characters the viewer can care about. Stephen Dorff  gives a memorable performance as a not quite middle aged movie actor whose life has reached an impasse. Holed up in Hollywood's famed Chateau Marmont between movie press engagements, Dorff as Johnny Marco seems to be deeply depressed, living day to day in nearly non-existence mode, until his young daughter (the lovely Elle Fanning) shows up.

1365654,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B003UESJLU,M. Oleson,"[1, 3]","This is a love it or hate it movie by Sofia Coppola starring a collection of unknown actors.  The movie opens with a cool black Ferrari circling a dirt race track ""somewhere"" in a desolate area.  The camera is fixed on one shot as the sports car makes 3 or 4 passes with no explanation.  I suspect this is a metaphor for the rest of the movie. The car is driven by Johnny Marco, a modern day movie star.  Young, handsome he has it all.  He lives in an upper crust private hotel in L. A.  It comes with all the trimmings, including booze, drugs, parties and beautiful women clamoring to get a taste of Johnny's fame.  He's not happy though.  Something is missing.There is virtually no dialog for the first 30 minutes or so in this film, and very little after that.  The actors must communicate through their eyes and their actions.  It works.  Stephen Dorff plays Johnny and coulda, shoulda won some awards.  He's terrific.  Elle Fanning is his 11 year old daughter Cleo.  He shares custody with his ex but the visits are mostly taxiing her to various appointments.  In one scene he takes her to ice skating practice where she skates an entire number to Gwen Stefani's ""Cool"" and he starts to realize he is missing her childhood and watches more attentively.  It's a beautiful thing to watch.  Ms. Fanning pulls it off.  The girl can skate, and dance, and swim, and cook and of course, she can act.  There is a scene in Italy where she accompanies Johnny to a premier of his latest movie.  Johnny hooks up with a beautiful woman he knows and brings her back to his suite unbeknownst to Cleo until the next morning.  Fanning gives her disapproval using only her eyes and facial expression.  Not too obvious, but you know she's pissed and so does Dad.Coppola has a unique way of telling stories.  They are simple and without much substance.  So it is here.  She uses very long, stationary camera shots.  You must be patient.  The soundtrack was done by rock group Phoenix and there is a great mix of old and new music.

Shows you should always listen to the people's reviews here on Amazon.  This movie was a pointless, meaningless total waste of time. I kept waiting for a point to be made, no such luck. Just one unexplained meaningless scene after another totaling nothing.  The ""star"" looks at or sees one person after another, none of these people is ever explained who they are, where did they come from, why are they here now, why are they gone just as fast as they show up?  The ""star"" also appears in one unexlained mystery room after another. I spent most of the movie asking myself, where is he supposed to be now???  Who are these people he's talking to?  Why the heck doesn't anything happen???  Is that his piano in his house he's playing, where is he anyway?  Oy, Sofia, please try to say something next time, and it wouldn't hurt to get to a point, & maybe even consider (this is a shock!) having a story to tell!  There was no story, no plot, no star for that matter.  Just one unexplained meaningless scene after another then (as is, sadly, the case with most movies today) it stopped.  Notice I didn't say the movie ended, that would imply there was an ending, this movie just finally stopped ran out of film I suppose but at least that put everyone out of their misery.  And even where the film runs out and stops it didn't make any sense either, keeping with the theme of this whole mess.  The ""end"" was idiotic and sensless.  What follows might be considered a spoiler, but not really, how can you spoil a plotless pointless series of scenes, so just before the film runs out (it ends) where the heck was the ""star"" walking to? He was out in the middle of the desert and left his corvette on the road behind as he walks down the long highway to???  Did he die of the elements out there?  Who knows, who cares.  Yeah, that's ""the end"", completely senseless.

1365656,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B003UESJLU,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[2, 2]","For those who've seen Sofia Coppola's other films, such asLost in TranslationandMarie Antoinette, this is familiar terrain.  What she's done here is focus it even further, as minimal as possible.  Here it's not so much about story as about the character of a life.  Coppola seems to be aiming for something on par with Antonioni's films about the ennui of those whose lives are isolated from others through the abstraction of wealth, but with a redemptive strain that's almost always expected in American family dramas.  Johnny (Stephen Dorff), a celebrity action film star, is bored and feeling empty, surrounded by people who aren't so much interested in him as in what he represents.  Maybe he's reached that point, too, where he's lost the capacity to make contact with anyone else, except to use them to escape for a while from himself.What we see is his life between the glamorous moments - when he's not on set or on screen or at press junkets, or on television projecting an image of a careless and carefree existence.  The one thing he cares for and cares about is his daughter (played to pitch perfection, with just the right blend of confident and shy by Ella Fanning, who strikes me as even more talented and natural than her older sister Dakota was at that age).  When her mother drops her off and leaves her with him for a couple weeks, it's a chance to relate to someone on other terms, and it may be what he needs to make a difference.  Maybe it's about learning to care, or maybe it's about seeing his own situation anew as he introduces it to her, or maybe its about seeing himself and his lifestyle through her eyes.  There's no way a life can turn around in a couple of weeks, but maybe there's a glimpse of new possibilities.The opening shot of the film, that shows him driving in circles, in a fast car going nowhere, might be a bit heavy handed.  Later, though, there are a series of shots that establish in a subtle way who Johnny is and how he relates to the world.  He lies in bed, entertained by a couple of women, and can barely stay awake, barely even muster desire, as if he's watching television rather than having an encounter with real people.  It's as if he doesn't really see them.  When his daughter first comes to visit, though, and he observes her ice skating performance, the contrast is sharp.  She's also performing for him, and at first he's distracted by texts on his phone, but the camera reveals him developing fascination and he comes to look upon her with pride and surprise.  It's an intriguing film, that's beautifully lensed, but one that requires some patience from viewers not used to the more contemplative approach of some European films.  I liked it quite a bit, but I expect some might be put off by the pacing.",4,"Not quite a masterpiece, but a seriously underrated film about celebrity: an isolated life, surrounded by people",1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2767,"['who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'asLost', 'TranslationandMarie', 'Antoinette', 'familiar', 'terrain', 'What', 'done', 'here', 'focus', 'even', 'further', 'as', 'minimal', 'possible', 'Here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'character', 'life', 'Coppola', 'be', 'aiming', 'something', 'par', 'Antonioni', 'films', 'ennui', 'lives', 'are', 'isolated', 'others', 'abstraction', 'wealth', 'redemptive', 'strain', 'almost', 'always', 'expected', 'American', 'family', 'dramas', 'Johnny', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'celebrity', 'action', 'film', 'star', 'bored', 'feeling', 'empty', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'interested', 'what', 'Maybe', 'reached', 'point', 'too', 'where', 'lost', 'capacity', 'make', 'contact', 'anyone', 'else', 'use', 'escape', 'while', 'himself.What', 'see', 'life', 'glamorous', 'moments', 'when', 'not', 'set', 'screen', 'press', 'junkets', 'television', 'projecting', 'image', 'careless', 'carefree', 'existence', 'one', 'thing', 'cares', 'daughter', 'played', 'pitch', 'perfection', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'confident', 'shy', 'Ella', 'Fanning', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'talented', 'natural', 'older', 'sister', 'Dakota', 'was', 'age', 'When', 'mother', 'off', 'couple', 'weeks', 'chance', 'relate', 'someone', 'other', 'terms', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'make', 'difference', 'learning', 'care', 'maybe', 'seeing', 'own', 'situation', 'anew', 'her', 'maybe', 'seeing', 'lifestyle', 'eyes', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'turn', 'around', 'couple', 'weeks', 'maybe', 'glimpse', 'new', 'possibilities.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'film', 'driving', 'circles', 'fast', 'car', 'going', 'nowhere', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Later', 'though', 'are', 'series', 'shots', 'establish', 'subtle', 'way', 'who', 'Johnny', 'how', 'world', 'bed', 'entertained', 'couple', 'women', 'can', 'barely', 'stay', 'awake', 'barely', 'even', 'muster', 'desire', 'watching', 'television', 'rather', 'having', 'encounter', 'real', 'people', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'When', 'daughter', 'first', 'visit', 'ice', 'skating', 'performance', 'contrast', 'sharp', 'also', 'performing', 'first', 'distracted', 'texts', 'phone', 'camera', 'developing', 'fascination', 'look', 'pride', 'surprise', 'intriguing', 'film', 'beautifully', 'lensed', 'one', 'patience', 'viewers', 'not', 'used', 'more', 'contemplative', 'approach', 'European', 'films', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit', 'expect', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'pacing']",N/A

This is her fourth film and the two ones in a middle, I personally did not care much for.  This time, it was a treat to see another well done, deeply emotional movie about adults growing up once faced with tough choices in their lives.  This film moves slowly, and that is done intentionally on director's part, since main character's life seems to be in limbo.  His life is one big groundhog day that repeats between sleeping around with women he barely knows or cares about, hiring strippers to entertain him in his hotel room, while he's falling asleep and having endless movie promotions spiced with picture taking, and occasional run in with a former lover.  This suddenly all comes under his own scrutiny when his ex-wife drops off their pre-teen daughter for indefinite amount of time.Having young daughter around definitely changes all arrangements he makes in his life. His daughter is endearing, patient with her father and well behaved.  She has her routines that she follows dilligently and she is a source of a lot of fun for her father.  She also stirs emotions this disillusioned actor thought he lost long ago and wakes up a sleeping giant inside of him.  In any case, this visit and a few weeks spent with his daughter, change the man forever.I have learnt to appreciate Sofia Coppola's movies as an acquired taste.  This film is no exception.

When Johnny, an actor who spends his days living in a motel and sleeping with random women is surprised by his 11 year old daughter Cleo (Fanning) he realizes that his life is not where he wants it to be. This is a hard movie to review and explain. I enjoyed it, but it is a very deliberate moving movie. It is slow, but with a purpose. Scenes that in other movies would take a few seconds are stretched out into minutes in this one. It makes sense in this movie, based on the usage of how Johnny spends his life, but it does seem that some scenes are excessively long. This is a good movie and I liked it, but this is one you must be in the mood for. This is a ""Focus Feature"" movie and for those that are familiar with their style you will know what to expect, as well as those who have seen Sofia Coppola's previous movies. It is good, but be prepared for long scenes that seem to go nowhere. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I think I would, just to see it I can catch the symbolism I missed the first time.",4,A good but very deliberate moving movie.

Like her previous outing, the visual of ""Somewhere"" is quite attractive. Music is also great (as in her ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Virgin Suicides""). But good music and visual are not enough to make a good film.""Somewhere"" begins with a scene of a black car running around wildly on the same place. As one of the previous reviewers pointed out, there is a similar scene in Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny,"" in which the hero drives his motorcycle around and around on the race track. Not a bad idea to suggest the state of the characters' empty lives. The trouble is, in both films, the scene is way too long and eventually become pretentious.""Somewhere"" is about one Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff), a rich and famous actor. In spire of (or because of) his success, something is missing in Johnny's life. That something comes in the form of his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) visiting the Chateau Marmont hotel. Johnny and Cleo have a good time together. Their scenes, though stretched, are nice and natural.Sofia Coppola was never much of a storyteller. I know that is not her forte. The strength of ""Lost in Translation"" does not lie in that. But, flawed as it is, ""Lost in Translation"" offered not only visuals but the characters we cared. Sorry, but there is no Bill Murray in ""Somewhere."" No Scarlett Johansson, either.To their credits, two leading actors are likable and their performances are decent. Stephen Dorff's is effectively understated, while Elle Fanning's charming. Only that we find it hard to relate to their sadness. The emotional depth you found in Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's characters, you will not find in ""Somewhere.""
