151354,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0792844718,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 8]","I think, more often than not, that I get caught up in these deeply rooted dramas that are more disturbing than entertaining.  I love films that break the mold of the modern movie and go beyond what Hollywood 2000 is currently releasing.  It seems to be the same old recycled material that has been in place for the past four years.  Maybe we are experiencing Hollywood's ""rut"", or maybe there is something more, but films today just don't seem as personal as they once were.  This is especially true in the comedies where bathroom humor comes first and plot development is somewhere in third or forth.  What ever happened to films like Mr. Mom?  Did we become too good or to technologically advanced to ever create films like this again?  If this is the case, it is very frightening to see this change in events.  Mr. Mom represents one of Hollywood's early chapters.  This was the chapter of comedy that placed genuine human settings in very humorous situations.  It was when ideas sold the film instead of sex or violence.  It was a time in Hollywood when writers were paid to use intelligence instead of just whatever the kids will laugh at.  Sadly, this chapter no longer exists, thus we are forced (willingly!) to watch films like Mr. Mom over and over again without any disappointment in our eyes.  In a way, I hope that Hollywood doesn't revert back to this style of filmmaking so that it doesn't ruin my perception of 80s comedies.If you couldn't already tell, I really enjoyed this film.  There was just something about it that stood out for me.  I think it had something to do with the simplistic nature of this film.  There wasn't any convoluted plots, any dark sinister tumbles, any overplayed characters, or even any wildly confusing settings.  This was a very simple film and it worked at every level.  With the simplistic nature of the film, you could easily fall in love or feel a connection with Keaton's Jack.  The family, although fabricated by Hollywood, seemed like one of your own or at least one that is not too far away from your own.  There was a sense of ownership with this film that is missed in today's cinema.  The chemistry between Garr and Keaton only helped add more enjoyment to this film.  The continual ""motherly"" things that Garr did while not at home were not just funny, but somehow poignant.  It reminded me of my childhood and those days when my father had to stay at home while my mother went to work.  It was real life, or at least felt closer than what we see in the theaters today.  There were money issues, dirty homes, and small televisions ... everything the American family needs to see.Where the real humor occurs is in the home during the day.  Keaton has the best ability to take simple chores and create disastrous, yet completely laughable, moments.  His interactions with the kids are impeccable.  You can see from the quote above the type of language he uses around one of his youngest children.  This is a scene where it is time for the kid to give up his ""security"" blanket and move forward in life.  Simply put, Keaton does fantastic as the stay at home mom.  He combines moments of Uncle Buck with the pensive nature of Steve Martin.  He is a comic, while Hollywood seems to dub him for other roles.Perhaps that is why this film grabbed me as tight as it did.  Mr. Mom reminded me of the classic family structure and also how our world has changed so much since this film.  The ""Mr. Mom"" idea is very relevant in today's society.  Men are staying at home with the children while mothers are the sole providers.  It isn't embarrassing or uncommon to see this anymore.  Also, this was one of those films where ""nothing"" happened outside the house.  We are never taken outside the house into the real world for any extended period of time.  We never see any newspaper articles or any television news, only soap operas and radio shows.  While we can assume that there is a bad economy going on out there, we are never given a hint on how bad it is.  This again allows us to stay focused on the family.  It allows us to fall in love with them without worrying that anything bad will happen to them.  We believe, throughout this film, that they are the best representation of family possible.  They forge through any adversity and yet still come out on top.  This would be a perfect film for families to watch together that may have some struggles in their lives.  It would help them to see a family that works together for the common good.Have I strayed off this film too much?  I don't think so.  This movie was more than just the story of a man accepting the role of the mother, but also a quick glimpse into the future.  It was an American family story that would be perfect to watch at any point in your life.  While the humor is enticing, what is most enjoyable to watch is the family and its reactions to adversity.  It fills you with hope for all of us as we enter into any unknown times in our lives.Too philosophical?  I don't know, all I know is that I loved this film and cannot wait to watch it again.  Keaton steals the show and proves that he is more than just a regular ""Joe"" in Hollywood!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Are you crazy?

Keaton stars as Jack Butler, a man who is laid off from his job. As soon as he is, his wife(Teri Garr)decides to go back to work and gets a great job. Poor Jack is now home dealing with all of the normal,everyday things that you usually do. He is raising the kids, doing the dishes, laundry, making dinner. He has even started to watch soaps and hang out the neighborhood ladies. Grocery shopping is a nightmare for him. The review on this page stated that the movie is sexist. Please. People make arguments over something that's not even there. Sigh. This movie has many classic scenes as well as dialogue that you can repeat over and over.

It was perhaps the first major film of its kind in which the mom/dad and husband/wife roles were reversed.  The movie is tactful - for the most part - in dealing with the circumstances regarding these role reversals.  Though moral and marital blunders always remain close at hand, this husband/wife team remain devoted to each other, and that's a rare thing in movies today.My personal favorite parts of the movie are the ROCKY references, espceially when Jack (Michael Keaton, the title character) gets off the beer and soaps, and starts working out, shaving, and basically redeeming himself once again - all to the tune of the upbeat ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme from ROCKY.  The very best parts of the movie - and almost everyone will agree on this - is simply watching the initial encounters and finally the rise of Jack Butler the homemaker.  These range from watching soap operas (namely THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS), adventures with the kids at the supermarket, and changing dirty diapers (after the baby finds an open can of chili!).My complaints (and the reason for four stars instead of five) include times when the film gets a little too close to extra-marital affairs.  As I insinuated before, this does not happen, but it may still get too close for certain viewers' comfort.  Also, as one reviewer has already stated, the male stripper scene was totally out of place in a film of this kind.  (MR. MOM was released one year before the implementation of the PG-13 rating.)

Whenever I think of Michael Keaton, I think of this movie. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Butler who falls victim to layoffs at the company he works for. His wife Caroline played by Terri Garr makes a bet with him over who gets a job first. Caroline manages to get a job at an advertising agency headed by Ron Richardson (Martin Mull). The only drawback is that Caroline hasn't worked in awhile so she is like a fish out of water at the company until she comes up with a snazzy ad campaign for tuna fish. In the meantime, Jack has to take over the role of housewife and learn to clean the house, take care of the children, fix dinner, do laundry, and go grocery shopping. It takes Jack awhile to adapt to the role of Mr. Mom but he has the help of Caroline's friends. The results is hilarious especially when Jack goes to the grocery store and loses one of his children. Another favorite moments is when the women and Jack are playing poker with grocery coupons or when they end up going to a Chippendale's nightclub. ""Mr. Mom"" is good, clean fun.

Times certainly have changed, but so many things have stayed the same.Michael Keaton is Jack, a working, everyday white collar employee in Detroit working for the auto industry who finds himself out of a job.  In a somewhat odd twist of fate for the early 80s, his wife Caroline (Teri Garr) finds a job and goes to work, leaving him to care for the house and kids.  Jack is now a house husband, caring for the kids and giving into the hilarity of being a stay at home Mom.  This goes on for months on end and Jack gives into the tedium of being a stay at homer.  He gives into the endless hours of daytime television, letting the house go, letting the kids overtake him, not knowing or caring enough to learn the ropes of running a house, and having the tension mount between him and Caroline.There are a series of screwball comedy antics between him, the kids, the household chores, and trying to keep it all under control, and the classic battle of the sexes theme is always there (a man trying to keep things under control in a woman's world).  He adopts a clique of women friends, even being chased by a shark of a divorcee, Joan.Funny how things have changed since then.  With the poor economy and the changing gender roles in society today, it's not so uncommon to find a man staying at home with the kids.  More women are working than ever before, and more than half of the married women are the breadwinners of their families.  It might have been a little strange back then, but it's become more commonplace now.  Who knows?  Maybe someday we'll go back to these simplier times.  I see a world of slightly more courtesy in their working worlds, well behaved kids, and little to no dysfunction.",4,Mr. Mom still entertains after 25 years ...,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,1818,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'not', 'seeing', 'many', 'years', 'Hard', 'believe', 'been', '25', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'certainly', 'have', 'changed', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'stayed', 'same.Michael', 'Keaton', 'Jack', 'working', 'everyday', 'white', 'collar', 'employee', 'Detroit', 'working', 'auto', 'industry', 'who', 'job', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'twist', 'fate', 'early', '80s', 'wife', 'Caroline', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'job', 'work', 'leaving', 'care', 'house', 'kids', 'Jack', 'now', 'house', 'husband', 'caring', 'kids', 'giving', 'hilarity', 'being', 'stay', 'home', 'Mom', 'months', 'end', 'Jack', 'tedium', 'being', 'stay', 'homer', 'endless', 'hours', 'daytime', 'television', 'letting', 'house', 'go', 'letting', 'kids', 'overtake', 'not', 'knowing', 'caring', 'enough', 'learn', 'ropes', 'running', 'house', 'having', 'tension', 'mount', 'Caroline.There', 'are', 'series', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'antics', 'kids', 'household', 'chores', 'trying', 'keep', 'control', 'classic', 'battle', 'sexes', 'theme', 'always', 'man', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'control', 'woman', 'world', 'clique', 'women', 'friends', 'even', 'being', 'chased', 'shark', 'divorcee', 'Joan.Funny', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'then', 'poor', 'economy', 'changing', 'gender', 'roles', 'society', 'today', 'not', 'so', 'uncommon', 'find', 'man', 'staying', 'home', 'kids', 'More', 'women', 'are', 'working', 'ever', 'more', 'half', 'married', 'women', 'are', 'breadwinners', 'families', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'strange', 'back', 'then', 'become', 'more', 'commonplace', 'now', 'Who', 'Maybe', 'someday', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'simplier', 'times', 'see', 'world', 'slightly', 'more', 'courtesy', 'working', 'worlds', 'well', 'behaved', 'kids', 'little', 'dysfunction']",Mr. Mom VHS

151397,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,0792844718,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[0, 0]","The storyline to this 1983 comedy is quite formulaic and predictable if you've seen enough movies.  It's a role reversal comedy that has Michael Keaton playing the stay at home dad and Teri Garr playing the bread winning mom.  As perhaps unoriginal as the story may be, I challenge other viewers to find a better and more wholesome comedy that touches on the subjects of role reversal, unemployment, and child raising without crossing the zany line.  For the most part ""Mr. Mom"" is able to touch on some real critical every day issues with a winning and light touch, keeping us giggling and smiling along the way.  This isn't a comedy that has you belly laughing, it's a chuckling movie with memorable parts.I've always felt Michael Keaton always brought a sincere character to the screen whether he played Beetlejuice, Batman, or Jack Butler.  Jack is Mr. Mom, who gets laid off work and cannot find a job before his wife does.  Teri Garr plays Carol Butler who has  instant success as a marketing assistant.  While Jack is trying to learn how to hold down a household with three kids, crazy appliances, and personal hygiene woes, Carol finds herself climbing the corporate ladder but disappearing in her role as mom on the home front.  I think the movie works because it doesn't try to introduce us to a wacky household like most other comedies try to do in order to garner some unearned laughs.  All the characters are quite believable and a lot of the events are things that every household can relate to or find humorous.My warnings for this film is that as much as this is an easy family film, it does deal with adult issues and situations.  I always thought that Jack being shanghaied to a male strip club was in bad taste given the kind of audience it will attract; and the tempting Joan trying to seduce Jack may be inappropriate for a family audience.  There's also some mild language to watch out for.  I grew up watching Mr. Mom and I had no issues resulting from watching this movie as a kid.The few one star reviews you will read are either incoherent or those folks confused this film with a Will Ferrell like comedy.  If you want a relaxing comedy that's good hearted and contains some funny, memorable parts then look no further.

Teri Garr was great in ""The Black Stallion"" and in ""Oh God!"" as John Denver's wife.It's interesting how accurate it is about how the auto industry was going through changes and that job lay-offs are eminent even back in the eighties before mass global industry started to kill off American jobs.Anyway, as a comedy, I can relate to how difficult it is for a man to enter the commonly recognized 'woman's world' of daytime television and running a household of various chores. It is so easy for a man to take for granted of what a homemaker goes through while we men are busting our butts out in the cold working world of sales and industry.  Imagine how hard it is for a woman to take care of the house, AND have a job too.  Guys! Our wives need our help!  It's not so easy these days.And, of course, you'll even see a little sexism in how some corporate giant can think he can persuade an attractive married woman to give up her family just for more money and status.  Martin Mull played a perfect slime ball in this film.  He thought that his high corporate status would be more influential to persuade and charm a woman than that of his own natural character.I'd give this movie a five star rating if they ever re-release it in widescreen (not simulated widescreen by cutting off the top and bottom of the already chopped up fullscreen version like some re-releases have done).Movies like ""Mr. Mom"" are great Saturday afternoon entertainment that you can watch with your kids.  I miss good family entertainment like this.  Another great 80's comedy that I'd like to recommend with Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously.""Yes, I love the 80's!",4,I love the 80's!,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,2195,"['movie', 'just', 'classic', 'how', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'were', 'back', '1980', 'good', 'simple', 'family', 'comedy', 'getting', 'too', 'tasteless', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'exploiting', 'common', 'vices', 'weaknesses', 'Jack', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'too', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'exhume', 'behavior', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'family', 'course', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'supportive', 'wife', 'great', 'caring', 'mother', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'was', 'great', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'Oh', 'God', 'John', 'Denver', 'wife.It', 'interesting', 'how', 'accurate', 'how', 'auto', 'industry', 'was', 'going', 'changes', 'job', 'lay-offs', 'are', 'eminent', 'even', 'back', 'eighties', 'mass', 'global', 'industry', 'started', 'kill', 'off', 'American', 'jobs.Anyway', 'comedy', 'can', 'relate', 'how', 'difficult', 'man', 'enter', 'commonly', 'recognized', ""'woman"", 'world', ""'"", 'daytime', 'television', 'running', 'household', 'various', 'chores', 'so', 'easy', 'man', 'take', 'granted', 'what', 'homemaker', 'men', 'are', 'busting', 'butts', 'cold', 'working', 'world', 'sales', 'industry', 'Imagine', 'how', 'hard', 'woman', 'take', 'care', 'house', 'have', 'job', 'too', 'Guys', 'wives', 'need', 'help', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'days.And', 'course', ""'ll"", 'even', 'see', 'little', 'sexism', 'how', 'corporate', 'giant', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'persuade', 'attractive', 'married', 'woman', 'give', 'up', 'family', 'just', 'more', 'money', 'status', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'played', 'perfect', 'slime', 'ball', 'film', 'thought', 'high', 'corporate', 'status', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'influential', 'persuade', 'charm', 'woman', 'own', 'natural', 'character.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'ever', 're-release', 'widescreen', 'not', 'simulated', 'widescreen', 'cutting', 'off', 'top', 'bottom', 'already', 'chopped', 'up', 'fullscreen', 'version', 're-releases', 'have', 'done', '.Movies', 'Mr', 'Mom', 'are', 'great', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'entertainment', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'miss', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'great', '80', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'like', 'recommend', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Johnny', 'Dangerously', 'Yes', 'love', '80']",Mr. Mom VHS
