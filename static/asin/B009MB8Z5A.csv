However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD.  I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN/DW is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs.  You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap.  So many customers demand full seasons ONLY!  You may fool the average consumer, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN/DW's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed.  What ever happened to producing quality products?  What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal?  The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD.  I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics.
