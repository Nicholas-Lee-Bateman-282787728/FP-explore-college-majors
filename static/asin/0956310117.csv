So you have to watch it a couple times to get it down.

He is very serious and VERY good at what he does.  I am a bona fide beginner and this workout was a little over my head (speed-wise).  I think this workout would be a bit more beneficial to those with some Kung Fu experience; there is not a lot of step by step break down of the moves.  He announces a movement (his English is very broken), he demonstrates once or twice (he's really amazing!), and then the students take off like whirlwinds.  I think over time (with a lot of pausing and reviewing) I can make it through the combinations.  I really liked the stretching segment (toward the end of the workout).  He gave a lot of modification advice for those of us whose joints have not reached the consistency of spaghetti.  He also gave a lot of breaks between each set of exercises (punches, kicks, forms), so my heart rate never stayed up.  It's really going to take patience on the beginner's part to slowly learn the footwork and hand placement if you are not coordinated or already knowledgeable in Kung Fu.  Overall, I liked the video.",4,Patience,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1135,"['Well', 'Shifu', 'Yan', 'Lei', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'giggly', 'bouncy', 'bubbly', 'instructor', 'award', 'year', 'very', 'serious', 'VERY', 'good', 'what', 'am', 'bona', 'fide', 'beginner', 'workout', 'was', 'little', 'head', 'speed-wise', 'think', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'beneficial', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'experience', 'not', 'lot', 'step', 'step', 'break', 'moves', 'movement', 'English', 'very', 'broken', 'once', 'twice', 'really', 'amazing', 'then', 'students', 'take', 'off', 'whirlwinds', 'think', 'time', 'lot', 'pausing', 'reviewing', 'can', 'make', 'combinations', 'really', 'liked', 'stretching', 'segment', 'end', 'workout', 'gave', 'lot', 'modification', 'advice', 'joints', 'have', 'not', 'reached', 'consistency', 'spaghetti', 'also', 'gave', 'lot', 'breaks', 'set', 'exercises', 'punches', 'kicks', 'forms', 'heart', 'rate', 'never', 'stayed', 'up', 'really', 'going', 'take', 'patience', 'beginner', 'part', 'slowly', 'learn', 'footwork', 'hand', 'placement', 'are', 'not', 'coordinated', 'already', 'knowledgeable', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Overall', 'liked', 'video']",Shaolin Warrior - Workout - Vol 1 - Beginners

I can across a few Yan Lei's videos on You Tube, and decided to purchase this workout [along with the Qi Gong vol 1] in early january.Even for a beginner of Martial Arts, this instructional video is easy to follow [clear audio and visual instruction], adaptable to your physical fitness level and level of flexibility, and you can see benefits early on in your training [if you exert yourself with some level of effort].I also find his blog posts very helpful [ [...]].  In them he gives additional insights to assist your training, and to encourage you along the way.  With the workouts, it is a good 1-2 punch.I have noticed that some find his accent hard to understand.  Yet, I am neither chinese nor learned in chinese, and after some familiarizing myself with his speech, I do not find him difficult to understand at all.I highly recommend this video.  I look forward to his vol 2, of this series, as I progress in my own training.",5,Easy to follow instructions; adaptable to situation [physically]...,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1089,"['had', 'seen', 'amazing', 'footage', 'Shaolin', 'Monks', 'training', 'overall', 'benefits', '[', 'physically-', 'internal', 'external', 'mentally/spiritually', ']', 'can', 'across', 'few', 'Yan', 'Lei', 'videos', 'Tube', 'decided', 'purchase', 'workout', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'vol', '1', ']', 'early', 'january.Even', 'beginner', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'instructional', 'video', 'easy', 'follow', '[', 'clear', 'audio', 'visual', 'instruction', ']', 'adaptable', 'physical', 'fitness', 'level', 'level', 'flexibility', 'can', 'see', 'benefits', 'early', 'training', '[', 'exert', 'level', 'effort', ']', '.I', 'also', 'find', 'blog', 'posts', 'very', 'helpful', '[', '[', ']', ']', 'additional', 'insights', 'assist', 'training', 'encourage', 'way', 'workouts', 'good', '1-2', 'punch.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'find', 'accent', 'hard', 'understand', 'am', 'chinese', 'learned', 'chinese', 'familiarizing', 'speech', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'difficult', 'understand', 'all.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'look', 'forward', 'vol', '2', 'series', 'progress', 'own', 'training']",Shaolin Warrior - Workout - Vol 1 - Beginners
167219,A1LLG2MPYVFAIK,0956310117,Mr. Ed,"[0, 0]",Just realized that I reviewed this product under the Qi gong workout which I also purchased. This is an intense workout and if you are not in athletic condition you may want to start off with his Qi Gong workout and work up to this one. It's a perfect fighting style and he's a wonderful master teacher.,5,Great with Qi Gong workout,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,303,"['Just', 'realized', 'reviewed', 'product', 'Qi', 'gong', 'workout', 'also', 'purchased', 'intense', 'workout', 'are', 'not', 'athletic', 'condition', 'may', 'want', 'start', 'off', 'Qi', 'Gong', 'workout', 'work', 'up', 'one', 'perfect', 'fighting', 'style', 'wonderful', 'master', 'teacher']",Shaolin Warrior - Workout - Vol 1 - Beginners
