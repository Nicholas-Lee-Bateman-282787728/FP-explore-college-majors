264448,AD5JI9UN98JPH,6301760387,christmas lover,"[0, 0]",I was glad to find this because I watched it when I was little and hadn't seen it in years. I wasn't sure it was going to be the same thing because I only had a vague memory of the storyline. Long story short it is the same story. A mouse named Albert and a few of his friends write a letter calling Santa Claus a fraudulent myth which angers him and he returns every-ones letters to him unopened. A clockmaker hoping to show Santa Claus that they really do love him and believe in him makes a clock that will play a special song for him to hear at the stroke of midnight. Santa Claus does come but first a miracle has to happen because Albert accidently breaks the clock when he climbs inside to see how it works insuring that Santa Claus may not be coming. This is a very good story and a very good show. One review complained about the lack of extras the disc has. Obviously she didn't have the Blu-ray because that gives you the DVD and what little extras are on that plus the movie on Blu-ray with at least one other extra that I haven't watched yet. Anyway like I said this is a good story and a good show. You should get it because youll regret it if you don't.

I recall the songs being very catchy and memorable, along with the inclusion of Clement C. Moore's original tale. But there was something about it that bothered me. It's almost as though it intends to enforce a cynical tone about the existence of Santa Claus to younger viewers, uncharacteristic for the Rankin-Bass production team. Their adaptations of 'Rudolph' and 'Frosty', by comparison, respond more warmly to the chidhood innocence and wonder often associated with the Christmas season. That doesn't happen until towards the end, but it may leave some children questioning their faith in Santa.

The story is simple but is executed very well (like Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer).The story is that Santa Claus receives a rude letter which has prompted him to cancel Christmas. On top of that, the Big Ben clock of a town which signifies the arrival of Santa hasbeen temporarily derailed. So the clockmaker of town, Joshua Trundel (voice of Joel Grey) tries his best to make the clock work, while Father Mouse (Part of a family of mices that lives under and features the voice of (George Gobel )the mouse who  tries to discover who sent the letter to Santa and what he can do to help.The special is a classic for several reasons. Firstthe animation (big budget) is beautiful and colorous.The animators obviously put forth a good effort and it shows. There aren't too many Christmas cartoons that match the quality of this one with the exception of a couple (Rudolph The Red Reindeer, Santa Claus is coming to town and others).Then there is the wonderful voice and musical scores for the special. Again another rarity, this cartoon is one of a few that executes both good animation and Christmas music and songs to the finest:""Well do whats necessary because even a  miracle needs a hand.Youll hope and Ill hury, youll wish and ill widdle.. well do whats necessary because even a miracle needs a hand.""I could go and on about the quality of this special but it's just absurdly obvious how great it is. I watched it 3 days before Christmas, and even after all these years, it still gave me that Christmas feeling all over again. Great animation and sound.

No matter what age someone is, I believe they can appreciate this great work of art.  Adults can go beneath the surface and find deeper meaning in the message sent out.  For instance, Albert doesn't believe anything he can't see.  His father tells him, ""You don't know as much as you think you do because you only think with your head.""  Then he sings a song about the beautiful things in the world you can't see or touch.  This short film shows how important it is to consult your heart in life and it sends out a very hopeful and entertaining message.  It makes you aware that miracles ARE possible, but you need to be at least a little active to get them going.  Even when Santa bypasses the town because of doubters, there are those in the town that refuse to give up hope and do whatever it takes to bring Santa back.  It's inspiring.
