McVay ""Writer""","[0, 0]","I'm a fan of Toni Collette's acting talents ever since watching her play Muriel in 'Muriel's Wedding' (A film I've watched so many times that I'm ashamed to admit the number). I was just as enamored with her brilliant performance in this wonderful film. In fact, the entire cast in 'Cosi' are absolutely brilliant and I laughed so hard I know I sounded like a hen about to lay an egg. Once you've encountered the unique characters in this movie they will become unforgettable. The task of a director attempting to put together a difficult play casting mentally ill patients is a witty concept in itself, but the movie's director, Mark Joffe, molds the story into a revolutionary comedy while also bringing to the surface the underlying struggles of mental illness, relationships, and the all-consuming magic of the theatre.

It's funny...it's sad...it's human...it's life.  As moving as this story is, I don't recommend it for children due to the language.  On my scale of buy, or not to buy...definitely a buy!This is the story of a young man (Lewis), an amateur theatre director, who's just having the devil of a time figuring out his life.  He looses his job and reluctantly takes a position as an activities director in a government-run program for the rehabilitation of people with varying degrees of mental illness.As activites director, Lewis is tasked with organizing a seriously dysfunctional group of mentally ill individuals to put on a show to justify the funding and existance of the program.  He's absolutely horrified when introduced to his ""charges"" and wants nothing to do with the project.  He's persuaded to take on the challenge, and the adventure of a lifetime begins.  As hard as Lewis tries to stay emotionally detached from his cast, he finds he can't help but let them into his life.  To his surprise, the closer he gets to them the more he learns about himself, his own life, and life in general.For their presentation, the group decides they want to do a play and pick Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte.  I don't think this particular production was quite what Mozart had in mind for his play!  What could go wrong?  Oh my!  What couldn't go wrong?!?!  Everything you can think of happens during the rehearsals and the actual presentation of the play.  The actors are trained well though, and the show goes on to finish...and...what a finish it is!The sadness, humor and frailty of each character portrayed in this movie is just fantastic.

He meets an vaired assortment of societal outcasts and oddballs who in the end don't appear to be all that different from the people outside the institution.Notable performances-Ben Mendelsohn as Lewis the directorRachel Griffiths as Lucy his girlfriendToni Collette as Julie a troubled young woman whose parents have sent her to a mental institution to deal with her drug problemDavid Wenham ( aka Faramir from Return of the King) plays Doug a disturbed pyromaniac who stirs up trouble for the production.The patients do not settle for some lame variety show and push to put on an opera- Cosi Fan Tutte by Mozart. They do the opera as a play in English with singing for the finale. The play's theme is echoed by the events of the film- Lewis's friend Nick moves in with Lewis and Lucy and tells Lewis she is cheating on him. They make a bet. The play revolves around two young soldiers who make a bet that their women will be true- and then deceive them and the women fall in love with the new men they think they have met while their men are off at war.The comedy is typical Aussie- a combo of physical slapstick and sight gags and some biting verbal barbs.Toni Collette proves here she can sing beautifully- does an a cappella rendition of Stand By Me that steals the show.Enjoyable overall- a gem in the rough I was pleased to stumble onto!,4,Enjoyable,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,1518,"['funny', 'poignant', 'story-', 'hero', 'hired', 'direct', 'play', 'mental', 'hospital', 'type', 'therapy', 'patients', 'Lewis', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'vaired', 'assortment', 'societal', 'outcasts', 'oddballs', 'who', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'different', 'people', 'institution.Notable', 'performances-Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'Lewis', 'directorRachel', 'Griffiths', 'Lucy', 'girlfriendToni', 'Collette', 'Julie', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'parents', 'have', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'deal', 'drug', 'problemDavid', 'Wenham', 'aka', 'Faramir', 'Return', 'King', 'Doug', 'disturbed', 'pyromaniac', 'who', 'up', 'trouble', 'production.The', 'patients', 'do', 'not', 'settle', 'lame', 'variety', 'show', 'push', 'put', 'opera-', 'Cosi', 'Fan', 'Tutte', 'Mozart', 'do', 'opera', 'play', 'English', 'singing', 'finale', 'play', 'theme', 'echoed', 'events', 'film-', 'Lewis', 'friend', 'Nick', 'Lewis', 'Lucy', 'tells', 'Lewis', 'cheating', 'make', 'bet', 'play', 'two', 'young', 'soldiers', 'who', 'make', 'bet', 'women', 'will', 'be', 'true-', 'then', 'deceive', 'women', 'fall', 'love', 'new', 'men', 'think', 'have', 'met', 'men', 'are', 'off', 'war.The', 'comedy', 'typical', 'Aussie-', 'combo', 'physical', 'slapstick', 'sight', 'gags', 'biting', 'verbal', 'barbs.Toni', 'Collette', 'here', 'can', 'sing', 'beautifully-', 'cappella', 'rendition', 'Stand', 'Me', 'show.Enjoyable', 'overall-', 'gem', 'rough', 'was', 'pleased', 'stumble', 'onto']",N/A
