Instead, the actual film (which was released direct-to-video in the US) consists of marginally creepy British characters boring Jessica Alba to tears in a secluded English mansion. Alba turns in an indifferent, awkward perfomance and I can't blame her. In fact I felt sorry for the poor girl.

673365,A2ORMBJU6V5UV5,B00005PJ78,"Fleseastorm ""SAS""","[9, 11]","This movie is really a 3 1/2 star movie but I rounded up.  Jessica Alba plays a super model who is two-timing her boyfriend with another man.  The other man brings her to a old hotel run by a friend of his and soon she is left alone with just the family but is not able to remember if she is being hurt by them or what they might have done to her.  Mishca Barton (of O.C. fame) plays a deaf girl who sorta kinda saves the day.  Also the bad guy in the movie is someone you just plain hate.  He is creepy and disturbing...the movie wasn't bad...but it wasn't scary and the plot didn't come together at the end.  They ending was a little disturbing but the movies puzzle as a whole never fit together right.  Jessica Alba makes this movie 100%.  She doesn't really do a lot in it except say things like, ""why are you doing this?!"" or, ""Let me go!""  but she is fun to watch.  This movie is not a great movie but it entertains.  I would say you should get it if you are a die-hard Jessica Alba fan but stay away if you don't care for scary movies.  It isn't scary, but it might scare younger kids.  The movie is not rated but if it were it would be a R movie.  They use the F word many times and show many woman's breasts throughout the whole movie.  The violence level is nonexistent.  This is a good movie if you are a JA fan but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.",4,Not Bad...,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1362,"['movie', 'really', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'movie', 'rounded', 'up', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'super', 'model', 'who', 'two-timing', 'boyfriend', 'man', 'other', 'man', 'old', 'hotel', 'run', 'friend', 'soon', 'left', 'alone', 'just', 'family', 'not', 'able', 'remember', 'being', 'hurt', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'Mishca', 'Barton', 'O.C', 'fame', 'deaf', 'girl', 'who', 'kinda', 'day', 'Also', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'someone', 'just', 'plain', 'hate', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'end', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'disturbing', 'movies', 'puzzle', 'whole', 'never', 'fit', 'together', 'right', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'movie', '100', '%', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'lot', 'say', 'things', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'Let', 'go', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'should', 'get', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'fan', 'stay', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'scary', 'movies', ""n't"", 'scary', 'might', 'scare', 'younger', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'rated', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'movie', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'many', 'times', 'show', 'many', 'woman', 'breasts', 'whole', 'movie', 'violence', 'level', 'nonexistent', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'JA', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'otherwise']",Paranoid

But it's definitely cheesy.  I realize that Jessica Alba's character is not supposed to be multi-dimensional, but if she claims to be ""a real person with feelings"" she should do more than pout and roll her eyes.The ""bad guy"" looks like a British clone of Jack Nicholson.  The features, the facial expression, the tone - it all echoes of ""The Shining"".

673367,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005PJ78,Only-A-Child,"[5, 7]","My used VHS copy of ""Paranoid"" made an immediate bad impression. It is a bad sign when you pick up a used VHS and find that it has ""not"" been rewound from a point midway into the movie. There is a very good chance that the last viewer got so disgusted by that point that they just bailed out and traded the thing in without even bothering to fast forward to the ending. Bad impression #2 came when I discovered the poor audio quality and tried to activate the subtitles-the tape does not have this feature (nor does the DVD version). Subtitles are added between  the final cut and distribution. They represent a modest additional expense so when they are missing from post-1996 movies it is because the producers were so unimpressed with the final product that they were already trying to cut their losses.That said ""Paranoid"" is not as bad as most commentary would lead you to believe. This is a psychological thriller that borrows heavily from ""Rear Window"" and ""The Collector"". Unfortunately, the generally decent cast is hampered by the limited talents of Jessica Alba, who not only looks the part of a fashion model, but exhibits the expected thespian skills of most fashion models.Although the distributors promote the movie as if the title refers to Chloe's (Alba) mindset, it actually is a reference to main captor Stan's (Iain Glen) delusions. These pass for irony as his damage control measures transform a minor and easily concealed crime into a high stakes situation. Although we are told at one point that Stan's last name is Kowalski and wait patiently for him to scream ""Stella"", director John Duigan somehow resists the temptation to go there.The just-under-the-surface depravity of the household is masked by the presence of a deaf child, nicely played by Mischa Barton. Barton gives a subtle non-verbal performance as the movie's only totally sympathetic character. Unfortunately, Duigan's script does not explore her motivations or how she has remained uncorrupted despite growing up in this environment. Instead the character is just an ethereal presence, helping to advance the story line but too distanced to really connect with the audience. Interestingly, when her parents ""sign"" to her they also say the words. Given the poor audio quality and inaudible dialogue it would have been useful for all the characters to ""sign"" their lines (after a few minutes of ""Paranoid's"" audio everyone can relate better to a deaf child).Also helping to advance the story line is Kevin Whately who plays the Jimmy Stewart ""Rear Window"" character. He perfectly plays a voyeur who is the only one who genuinely cares for Chloe's wellbeing. He cares enough to risk exposure in order to save her. But in attempting to illustrate his binocular observations of Chloe's apartment the folks in post-production not only added the silly black circles around the binocular image but desaturated all the color from these views-duh!Duigan is such a poor storyteller and his direction so laid back that he does generate any tension or suspense. But ""Paranoid"" is more tiring than boring, as you have to stay focused and work hard just to decipher what is happening in each scene (not because it is complicated but because it is so poorly illustrated). There are simply too many characters here and they are too unconventional, Duigan does not come close to giving us even one fully developed character. A good director would have used behaviors to complement dialogue but Duigan is too focused on style to provide any substance.The movie has good production design style and a fair number of nice visual moments. Like the unexpected and very sudden change in Chloe's situation when Stan slips the handcuffs on her wrist. And later when Gordon (Ewen Bremer) seemingly brings a tray of toast to the handcuffed Chloe and then casually eats it himself without even offering it to her.Even if you can follow what is supposed to be the final twist (Chloe's photographer boyfriend is the obsessive phone caller but Duigan's slips this revelation in so poorly that few will comprehend what he is showing), you just don't care because there so little character development or foreshadowing that it has no emotional impact.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2,Not Completely Awful,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,4252,"['used', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Paranoid', 'made', 'immediate', 'bad', 'impression', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'used', 'VHS', 'find', 'not', 'been', 'rewound', 'point', 'midway', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'last', 'viewer', 'got', 'so', 'disgusted', 'point', 'just', 'bailed', 'out', 'traded', 'thing', 'even', 'bothering', 'fast', 'forward', 'ending', 'Bad', 'impression', '2', 'came', 'when', 'discovered', 'poor', 'audio', 'quality', 'tried', 'activate', 'subtitles-the', 'tape', 'not', 'have', 'feature', 'DVD', 'version', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'added', 'final', 'cut', 'distribution', 'represent', 'modest', 'additional', 'expense', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'missing', 'post-1996', 'movies', 'producers', 'were', 'so', 'unimpressed', 'final', 'product', 'were', 'already', 'trying', 'cut', 'losses.That', 'said', 'Paranoid', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'commentary', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'heavily', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Collector', 'Unfortunately', 'generally', 'decent', 'cast', 'hampered', 'limited', 'talents', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'fashion', 'model', 'expected', 'thespian', 'skills', 'most', 'fashion', 'distributors', 'promote', 'movie', 'title', 'refers', 'Chloe', 'Alba', 'mindset', 'actually', 'reference', 'main', 'captor', 'Stan', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'delusions', 'pass', 'irony', 'damage', 'control', 'transform', 'minor', 'easily', 'concealed', 'crime', 'high', 'stakes', 'situation', 'are', 'told', 'one', 'point', 'Stan', 'last', 'name', 'Kowalski', 'wait', 'patiently', 'scream', 'Stella', 'director', 'John', 'Duigan', 'somehow', 'temptation', 'go', 'there.The', 'just-under-the-surface', 'depravity', 'household', 'masked', 'presence', 'deaf', 'child', 'nicely', 'played', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Barton', 'subtle', 'non-verbal', 'performance', 'movie', 'only', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Duigan', 'script', 'not', 'explore', 'motivations', 'how', 'remained', 'uncorrupted', 'growing', 'up', 'environment', 'Instead', 'character', 'just', 'ethereal', 'presence', 'helping', 'advance', 'story', 'line', 'too', 'distanced', 'really', 'connect', 'audience', 'Interestingly', 'when', 'parents', 'sign', 'also', 'say', 'words', 'Given', 'poor', 'audio', 'quality', 'inaudible', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'useful', 'characters', 'sign', 'lines', 'few', 'minutes', 'Paranoid', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'better', 'deaf', 'child', 'helping', 'advance', 'story', 'line', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'who', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Rear', 'Window', 'character', 'perfectly', 'voyeur', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Chloe', 'wellbeing', 'enough', 'risk', 'exposure', 'order', 'save', 'attempting', 'illustrate', 'binocular', 'observations', 'Chloe', 'apartment', 'folks', 'post-production', 'not', 'only', 'added', 'silly', 'black', 'circles', 'binocular', 'image', 'desaturated', 'color', 'views-duh', 'Duigan', 'such', 'poor', 'storyteller', 'direction', 'so', 'laid', 'back', 'generate', 'tension', 'suspense', 'Paranoid', 'more', 'tiring', 'boring', 'have', 'stay', 'focused', 'work', 'hard', 'just', 'decipher', 'what', 'happening', 'scene', 'not', 'complicated', 'so', 'poorly', 'illustrated', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'unconventional', 'Duigan', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'giving', 'even', 'one', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'good', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'behaviors', 'complement', 'dialogue', 'Duigan', 'too', 'focused', 'style', 'provide', 'substance.The', 'movie', 'good', 'production', 'design', 'style', 'fair', 'number', 'nice', 'visual', 'moments', 'unexpected', 'very', 'sudden', 'change', 'Chloe', 'situation', 'when', 'Stan', 'handcuffs', 'wrist', 'later', 'when', 'Gordon', 'Ewen', 'Bremer', 'seemingly', 'tray', 'toast', 'handcuffed', 'Chloe', 'then', 'casually', 'even', 'offering', 'her.Even', 'can', 'follow', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'final', 'twist', 'Chloe', 'photographer', 'boyfriend', 'obsessive', 'phone', 'caller', 'Duigan', 'slips', 'revelation', 'so', 'poorly', 'few', 'will', 'comprehend', 'what', 'showing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'foreshadowing', 'emotional', 'impact.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",Paranoid
673368,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005PJ78,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Paranoid (John Duigan, 2000)There are some movies that make me wonder, after I have suffered through them, what on Earth anyone involved in making them was thinking. Paranoid may be the best example of this I have ever come across. Jessica Alba was fresh off the success of Idle Hands. Iain Glen was in something of a slump, but did have The Wyvern Mystery coming out that year. Jeanne Tripplehorn had just done the wonderful Very Bad Things, and was actually at the high point of her career (despite the dire predictions made by everyone, myself included, that Waterworld would sink the careers of everyone involved). Ewen Bremner had just become the darling of critics everywhere as the title character in Julien Donkey-Boy and was about to achieve major commercial success with Snatch. And all one needs to say about Mischa Barton is The Sixth Sense. Now, how on earth did John Duigan manage to get all these people to appear in this utter dog of a film?I grant you, when Duigan's on his game, as with Wide Sargasso Sea or Lawn Dogs, he's capable of turning out a relatively good film, sometimes bordering on greatness. But when he misses, he shoots so wide of the mark that one often wonders if it's the same director-- and Paranoid is the biggest miss of Duigan's career. Aside from a couple of what one can assume (based on interviews Alba has given about later films) are body-double glimpses of a half-naked Alba (and a number of other model-type girls) at the beginning of the flick, and a bunch of model-shots of Alba in some pretty nifty lingerie ads, only the most hardcore Jessica Alba fan is going to get anything at all out of this tired, predictable, not-even-a-smidge-as-kinky-as-it-thinks-it-is ""thriller."" It's the only movie I can think of that I could possibly describe as being as erotic as Eyes Wide Shut, as mysterious as Mother, May I Sleep with Danger?, and as dangerous as Path of Destruction (or fill in any other Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie here). ""Bad"" does not even begin to sum it up. I cannot recommend highly enough that you avoid this movie at all costs. *",1,Worthless.,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2093,"['Paranoid', 'John', 'Duigan', '2000', 'are', 'movies', 'make', 'wonder', 'have', 'suffered', 'what', 'Earth', 'anyone', 'involved', 'making', 'was', 'thinking', 'Paranoid', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'example', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'was', 'fresh', 'success', 'Idle', 'Hands', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'was', 'something', 'slump', 'did', 'have', 'Wyvern', 'Mystery', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'had', 'just', 'done', 'wonderful', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'was', 'actually', 'high', 'point', 'career', 'dire', 'predictions', 'made', 'everyone', 'included', 'Waterworld', 'would', 'sink', 'careers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'had', 'just', 'become', 'darling', 'critics', 'everywhere', 'title', 'character', 'Julien', 'Donkey-Boy', 'was', 'achieve', 'major', 'commercial', 'success', 'Snatch', 'one', 'say', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Now', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'John', 'Duigan', 'manage', 'get', 'people', 'appear', 'utter', 'dog', 'film', 'grant', 'when', 'Duigan', 'game', 'Wide', 'Sargasso', 'Sea', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'capable', 'turning', 'out', 'relatively', 'good', 'film', 'sometimes', 'bordering', 'greatness', 'when', 'so', 'wide', 'mark', 'one', 'often', 'same', 'director', 'Paranoid', 'biggest', 'miss', 'Duigan', 'career', 'Aside', 'couple', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'assume', 'based', 'interviews', 'Alba', 'given', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'body-double', 'glimpses', 'half-naked', 'Alba', 'number', 'other', 'model-type', 'girls', 'beginning', 'flick', 'bunch', 'model-shots', 'Alba', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'lingerie', 'ads', 'only', 'most', 'hardcore', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'fan', 'going', 'get', 'anything', 'tired', 'predictable', 'not-even-a-smidge-as-kinky-as-it-thinks-it-is', 'thriller', 'only', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'could', 'possibly', 'describe', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'erotic', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'as', 'mysterious', 'Mother', 'May', 'Sleep', 'Danger', 'as', 'dangerous', 'Path', 'Destruction', 'fill', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'here', 'Bad', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'sum', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'avoid', 'movie', 'costs', '*']",Paranoid

The film is about a supermodel (Jessica Alba) who is cheating on her boyfriend.  She goes with her new love interest to his home which happens to be located hundred of miles away from her place of residence, and is also rather isolated from others.  She is drugged and held hostage for several days by the now cruel and abusive man she thought she loved.  This sounds interesting doesn't it?  However the film contains too many gaps of almost nothing being done on screen in between the actual scenes that contain anything that could be considered as action.  There are scenes that fill you with suspense, however these scenes rarely occur and are too far apart from each other.  This often results in unnecessary dialogue that has nothing to do with the story in anyway, instead it simply distract from the suspense that could have been occurring in its place.  The film does pick up, and the ending is rather good.
