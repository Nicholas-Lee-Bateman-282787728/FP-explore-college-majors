1296882,AYBX5U5Y70BSC,B002WIDRLC,Bryan,"[6, 6]","I enjoyed the First Season of this set and the quality is very good.  It's great to see the entire episodes at their full length of about 25 minutes.  I was hoping for the bumper advertisements (""the Patty Duke Show is brought to you by... Breck"", and other stuff like that), like they did on that 8 episode Laser Disc set released years ago, which I still have.  That set had Patty and Cathy doing a couple of the Breck commercials.  Oh well, we're lucky to finally get The Patty Duke Show on DVD at all.  Beggars can't be choosers.  The best TV shows are always released last.  The junk always comes first.I have watched all 6 discs of Season Two.  Discs 1, 5 and 6 have no problems, but discs 2, 3 and 4 have a minor glitch.  I have this same problem on another DVD player so it must be these 3 discs.  At the menu on disc 3 there is a choice of PLAY ALL or EPISODES.  If PLAY ALL is selected, that will take you to the intro teaser and beginning credits of ""Best Date In Town"".  Then it goes directly to the intro teaser and beginning credits of ""Can Do Patty"", then the episode (""Best Date In Town"" is skipped).  On disc 4, if PLAY ALL is selected the first title, ""Patty Meets A Celebrity"" is played out correctly, but the second title, ""The Raffle"" goes through the intro teaser and beginning credits, then jumps to ""The Newspaper Game"" intro teaser and beginning credits then the episode (""The Raffle"" is skipped).  This also applies to Disc 2 on ""The Greatest Psychologist In The World"".  That episode is skipped if PLAY ALL is selected.This problem for discs 2,3 and 4 can be solved by selecting ""EPISODES"" and select the first one.  When the episode is finished, it goes back to the episode menu, highlights the next one to be played and you just press enter on your remote.  No big deal, but this could be a sign of a quality control problem that I hope does not get worse on the Third Season set, assuming Shout Factory does release the last season.  Hey, Shout Factory.  Please release Season Three with extra extras!I would love to see bloopers and outtakes of Patty Duke on the set talking to her Director or the other actors and smoking a cigarette while in her Cathy or Patty digs.  What a sight that would be!  She was eighteen in the middle of Season Two.  She was almost twenty when the Third Season ended.The Patty Duke Show has always been one of my favorite 60's comfort sitcoms.  It's so damn wholesome and well done.  And dig that music.  The situational and background music is perfectly suited to the show.  Good job, Sid Ramin.  And by the way, has anyone noticed that Patty danced like nobody else?  I think they call it Patty Duke dancing.Byeeee!",5,I enjoyed the First Season of this set and the quality is very good.

1296883,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B002WIDRLC,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Season Two is, by far, my all-time favourite year of THE PATTY DUKE SHOW.  By this stage in the game, Patty Duke had completely settled into her trademark dual roles, and the show also opened up a whole new gallery of exciting guest stars.Sal Mineo drops by in ""Patty Meets a Celebrity"".  Turns out he's a former Brooklyn Heights High alum., and looking for some fresh talent to play opposite him in a revue performance.  Could Patty be his leading lady?  Remember what happened the last time Patty got into the highschool play?!...Patty turns into a music manager in the charming ""Patty Pits Wits, Two Brits Hits"".  Whilst Cathy debuts as the new voice of classical music on the highschool's radio station, Patty discovers her own ""long haired"" musical group (Jeremy Clyde and Chad Stuart) and resolves to land them a record deal.""Will the Real Sammy Davis Please Hang Up?"" is the legendary episode in which Sammy Davis Jr. (starring on Broadway in ""Golden Boy"" at the time) is asked to appear at the Brooklyn Heights prom.  Patty patrols Broadway with a sandwich sign when her letters to Davis appear to have fallen on deaf ears.  This episode is a real time capsule, and Broadway lovers will have a fun time spotting the marquees and posters from many shows of the day.The first season is also charming, but for me personally, the second year is where THE PATTY DUKE SHOW really comes into it's own.  36 episodes of sheer delight, plus a selection of recent Social Security advertisements in which Ms Duke revives the characters of Patty and Cathy.

Wednesday evenings were always special because THE PATTY DUKE SHOW was on. Years later, seeing the show, it is still funny and overall very good. My only criticism is that the show was called THE PATTY DUKE SHOW, not The Patty LANE Show. What is a very good series could have been a great one IF the writers paid the same amount of time and attention to the CATHY Lane character. Remember the PARENT TRAP? Equal time was paid to the twins, played first by HAYLEY MILLS and later by LINDSAY LOHAN.Patty Duke is a wonderful actress and did an incredible job making the two cousins  (as well as a third cousin: BETSY) individuals. The Cathy character left us wanting so much more, while the Patty character overstayed her welcome.

But I wish Shoutfactory would dig up some more photos of the Star. The photo of Duke in the Green Dress is not the most flattering portrait, her face looks thin and her nose dominates, plus it just doesn't look like the Patty/Cathy Lane character at all. It was all over the DVD discs last time and now they have stuck it on the cover which I suppose they are wanting us to think it is Cathy with Patty on the phone in the background. Right. Sorry, it just doesn't fly and looks totally faked. Is SF going to keep using the same photos over and over repeatedly? Surely we can get more variety.

It's great! The quality of the video and the sound are excellent. It would be nice to have an added bonus of seeing and hearing that ""The Patty Duke Show is brought to you by Breck"" - but even without the commercial promos it's still very much as when I first watched this TV program when I was a kid in the 1960s. The stories for season two are well written and there are several guest stars in season two, such as the very talented vocalist Bobby Vinton and the fine actor Sal Mineo. Two favorite episodes of mine are the sentimental Best Date In Town from December 9, 1964 where Patty is counting on her father to take her to the father & daughter dance but things take an unexpected turn and also the episode It Takes A Heap Of Livin' from February 24, 1965 where the Lane family home may be taken over by the historical society as it was supposedly an important site during the Revolutionary War - you must see this fine episode. The DVD packaging is nice and colorful with authentic Patty Duke Show photos (you'll even notice on the cover of the DVD episode guide that Patty and Richard are listening to an LP on a 1964 Webcor record player) and the graphics are very early-mid 1960s which adds to the authentic feeling.

It starts out kind of slow, and it takes place in San Fransisco rather than Brooklyn, but if you want the beginnings of this loved show, I would check it out.Maybe Shout Factory will be able to release the Pilot in the Third Season of the DVD collection, or release a special edition with it.

I couldn't be more happier! Shout! Factory, who is releasing the classic 1960's series, has proven again that they are dedicated in bringing back pure, family television from a decade long ago for new viewers to enjoy. Although not as popular as season 1 (the show fell out of the Top 20 shows in its second year), ""The Patty Duke Show"" continued its reign as one of network TV's most well-written and well-acted sitcoms. The second year began on September 16th, 1964 with the opener entitled ""The Green Eyed Monster"" in which poor Patty is torn between two boys at school. Other highlights this season are the episode called ""Practice Makes Perfect"" where Patty decides to take up the tuba much to the chagrin of her family. In ""Patty and The Peace Corps"" Patty wants more out of life and joins the Peace Corps. Finally, in ""High Society"" Patty battles her old nemesis Sue Ellen for the attention of the new boy at school. All 36 episodes of ""The Patty Duke Show-Season 2"" are included in this set and are remastered from the original United Artists prints. So far no special features have been announced. I am sure, however, season 3 is not far behind.

1296904,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002WIDRLC,trebe,"[0, 0]","Wacky gimmicks in television comedy were very common in the 1960's, so the premise of The Patty Duke Show (1963-66), which featured teenager Patty Duke playing dual roles, really wasn't that ""far out"" compared to the kind of programs that would soon follow.  Patty Duke Show creators William Asher and Sidney Sheldon, would later be involved with programs that heavily relied on special effects.  Bewitched (1964-72), and The Flying Nun (1967-70), for Asher, while Shelton was the creator of I Dream Of Jeannie (1965-70).Set in Brooklyn Heights, New York, The Patty Duke Show is a light, fun program that definitely highlights the talents of Patty Duke, who stars as Patty Lane, and her cosmopolitan cousin Cathy Lane.  In addition to Duke, the show has a pretty good cast, led by the wonderful William Schallert, as newspaperman Martin""Popo"" Lane.  Jean Byron is wife and mother Natalie, Paul O'Keefe is Patty's nerdy younger brother Ross, and Eddie Applegate is Patty's boyfriend Richard.Basing an entire series on the dual role concept, was an innovative idea, but one that clearly put many constraints on what could be done, and required special planning to shoot.  The program gets locked into shooting particular angles, where a double is used for either Patty or Cathy.  After a while, the novelty wears off, and the limitations of the format, become evident and start to become cliche.  There was a lot of pressure on Patty Duke, who was only 16 when the series began, as she had to regularly change her appearance for the dual roles.Actors playing dual roles, was an interesting idea that many TV programs explored, such as on Bewitched, where Elizabeth Montgomery played Samantha Stevens and her wacky cousin Serena.  The ploy is fun for a while, but it generally gets played out rather quickly.  Given the significant limitations of the central premise, the writers for Patty Duke do a pretty good job.  The stories usually center around family, school, and teen romance, and are in line with the typical idealistic view of teenage life in the 60's.  The series is entertaining, although rarely laugh out loud funny.  Between the two girls, the mildly spoiled Patty, is usually the dominant character.  She has issues with her parents, has a regular boyfriend, is more outgoing, and liable to get in trouble.  Cathy certainly has a significant role, but she's not in the spotlight as much.Season Two has 36 black and white episodes on six discs.  Image quality is very good.  The episodes have chapter stops, but no subtitles.  Among the bonus features is a cool six minute featurette from 2009 which features recent interviews with Patty Duke, William Schallert, Paul O'Keefe, and Eddie Applegate.  For those that enjoy family based comedies from the 1960's featuring teenage girls, The Patty Duke Show is a fine example, along withGidget - The Complete Series(1965-66), an excellent series that stars Sally Field and Don Porter.",3,"light and fun 60's comedy, delivers a double dose of Patty Duke...",1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2941,"['Wacky', 'gimmicks', 'television', 'comedy', 'were', 'very', 'common', '1960', 'premise', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', '1963-66', 'featured', 'teenager', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'playing', 'dual', 'roles', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'out', 'compared', 'kind', 'programs', 'would', 'soon', 'follow', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'creators', 'William', 'Asher', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'involved', 'programs', 'heavily', 'relied', 'special', 'effects', 'Bewitched', '1964-72', 'Flying', 'Nun', '1967-70', 'Asher', 'Shelton', 'was', 'creator', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', '1965-70', '.Set', 'Brooklyn', 'Heights', 'New', 'York', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'light', 'fun', 'program', 'definitely', 'talents', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'who', 'Patty', 'Lane', 'cosmopolitan', 'cousin', 'Cathy', 'Lane', 'addition', 'Duke', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'led', 'wonderful', 'William', 'Schallert', 'newspaperman', 'Martin', 'Popo', 'Lane', 'Jean', 'Byron', 'wife', 'mother', 'Natalie', 'Paul', ""O'Keefe"", 'Patty', 'nerdy', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ross', 'Eddie', 'Applegate', 'Patty', 'boyfriend', 'Richard.Basing', 'entire', 'series', 'dual', 'role', 'concept', 'was', 'innovative', 'idea', 'one', 'clearly', 'put', 'many', 'constraints', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'required', 'special', 'planning', 'shoot', 'program', 'locked', 'shooting', 'particular', 'angles', 'where', 'double', 'used', 'Patty', 'Cathy', 'while', 'novelty', 'limitations', 'format', 'become', 'evident', 'start', 'become', 'cliche', 'was', 'lot', 'pressure', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'who', 'was', 'only', '16', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'had', 'regularly', 'change', 'appearance', 'dual', 'roles.Actors', 'playing', 'dual', 'roles', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'many', 'TV', 'programs', 'explored', 'such', 'Bewitched', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'played', 'Samantha', 'Stevens', 'wacky', 'cousin', 'Serena', 'ploy', 'fun', 'while', 'generally', 'played', 'out', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Given', 'significant', 'limitations', 'central', 'premise', 'writers', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'stories', 'usually', 'center', 'family', 'school', 'teen', 'romance', 'are', 'line', 'typical', 'idealistic', 'view', 'teenage', 'life', '60', 'series', 'entertaining', 'rarely', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'two', 'girls', 'mildly', 'spoiled', 'Patty', 'usually', 'dominant', 'character', 'issues', 'parents', 'regular', 'boyfriend', 'more', 'outgoing', 'liable', 'get', 'trouble', 'Cathy', 'certainly', 'significant', 'role', 'not', 'spotlight', 'much.Season', 'Two', '36', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'six', 'discs', 'Image', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'subtitles', 'bonus', 'cool', 'six', 'minute', 'featurette', '2009', 'recent', 'interviews', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'William', 'Schallert', 'Paul', ""O'Keefe"", 'Eddie', 'Applegate', 'enjoy', 'family', 'based', 'comedies', '1960', 'featuring', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'fine', 'example', 'withGidget', 'Complete', 'Series', '1965-66', 'excellent', 'series', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Don', 'Porter']",The Patty Duke Show: Season 2
