It's based on the novel by Shirley Conran and it is very engrossing and if you love high drama and lots of tension then this is a show for you. It was a huge hit in the early 80's and very successful and it has a great cast.In my opinion it still has one of the best cliff hanging lines at the end of part one.,5,"Fantastic, Engaging TV Series",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,356,"['would', 'recommend', 'mini', 'series', 'anyone', 'based', 'novel', 'Shirley', 'Conran', 'very', 'engrossing', 'love', 'high', 'drama', 'lots', 'tension', 'then', 'show', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'early', '80', 'very', 'successful', 'great', 'cast.In', 'opinion', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'cliff', 'hanging', 'lines', 'end', 'part', 'one']",N/A

1343176,A3KWSNJD5OOAIF,B003F9LS90,"JesusIsLordDLWC ""DLWC""","[0, 0]","I purchase this 6 hour mini series drama which orginally came out on television about 1984 (on 2 VHS tapes) and I also purchased the sequel Lace II which also came on 2 DVD discs. This happened about 8 years ago. I do not remember whom I purchased  the VHS 2 tape version from other than it came from amazon.com's merchant. The VHS tapes were blank tapes and could not be viewed, I was totally ripped off and the 2 disc sequel - Lace II was fine. Please be very careful when you are purchasing VHS tape movie products because you will be ripped off!!!!  I have done business with Amazon.com for 20 years or more in terms of buying movies and other products. This particular newly designed version of Lace which shows all of the actresses on the cover seems to have a glitch when starting to play the DVD movie. When you put it in the DVD player and push play, the movies will start to play and then it stops!!!! If I had not known better, something inside me told me to push the DVD play button again and then the movie continued playing all the way through. This happened on both discs!!!  I don't know how the merchant was able to get a copy of this mini - series drama which came out in the year Feb. 1984. The miniseries drama was written by: Shirley Conran and the actresses whom placed in the television mini-series drama was: Phoebe Cates as &#34;Lily&#34;; Brooke Adams as Pagan Trelawney; Bess Armstrong as Judy Hale; Arielle Dombasle (french actress - Maxine Pascal ). Oneof the three young women, Brooke Adams as Pagan Trelawney; Bess Armstrong as Judy Hale; and Arielle Dombasie as Maxine Pascal while in their teen years were sent very good friends and sent away to a very strict european boarding school. They had formed a ridiculous pact between between them and one night after attending a valentine's day dance, one of them was raped, thus producing Phoebe Cates as &#34;Lily&#34;. The story does not let you know which of three girls was pregnant with Lily, but, finds a doctor whom helps them find foster parents whom takes care of &#34;Lily&#34; until one of the three girls gets on their feet and becoomessucessful and was to return to the foster parents and care for her child. However, it did not turn out that way. They had gone onwith their lives as they became older and forgot about lily. The foster parents were killed during World War II and &#34;LiLy&#34; was forced to take care of herself. She became a &#34;Very Successful Porn Queen&#34; whom later sought revenge on the three women whom had deserted her. Lace was the name of Judy Hale's Magazine (Bess Armstrong) whom became the editor and chief of Lace, she was also the one whom was raped and pregnant with &#34;LiLy&#34; (Phoebe Cates) - as quoted, &#34;which one of you bitchesis my mother&#34;. They had thought that &#34;Lily&#34; died in the war and did not know that Lily was Bess Armstrong's daughter. None of them realized that &#34;LiLY&#34; was still alive and very much in revenge for them abandoning her, but, you did not find this out untilyou watched the sequel of Lace. All three women seem to have had affairs with very wealthy and affulent men. Lace II is not available unless someone has copied it and is selling it without copyright permission. Be careful purchasing this 2 - disc versionof lace because it does have a glitch in it when you are trying to play it on your DVD and I have a brand New Sony DVD/Blue Ray/VHS combo player recorder. The movie came well before it was due and packaged quite well. The merchant will probablytry to hide this review towards the back of other negative reviews so that you will not be able to read it. The movie was produced in 1983 to 1984 and the Production company was Lorimar Productions. It is well worth viewing if you can get a legitmate copy. Lace II came out in 1985. It was named the best line in television history by TV Guide in its 1993 issue celebrating 40 years of television and aired on &#34;ABC&#34;. Lace II goes on to not only reveals who &#34;LILY's&#34; mother was but also reveals who &#34;LILY's&#34; Fatherwas. You need to see this mini-series drama, I think it is a movie that a lot of people today can relate to in terms of relationships.Mrs. Dione  L. WilliamsCrayton, Craytond2000@msn.com, Naperville, IL.

1343178,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B003F9LS90,Kasey G,"[17, 18]","Based on the trashy Shirley Conran novel, ""Lace"" was more-than-successfully adapted to the small screen in a two-part mini-series that aired in February 1984.Those of us who were teenagers in 1984 remember that this was the program everyone was talking about the next day at school. The shocking cliff-hanger ending with the infamous ""Which one of you bitches is my mother?"" line was on everyone's lips for days.While the book had four schoolgirls as the main characters, the TV version wisely got rid of one of them so our main cast consists of Maxine, Pagan and Judy. This trio is getting ready to graduate from an exclusive Swiss boarding school circa 1960, where they engage in typical teenage behaviours; smoking on the sly in their dorm room, mocking their elders, and chasing boys.A Valentine's Day dance finds each of them having issues with their various beaus, and a few months later, one of the girls (which one we're not told) ends up pregnant.With help from Maxine's rich Aunt Hortense (Angela Lansbury), they make a pact to hide the pregnancy and give the child up for adoption. The first one of them to establish a solid career will send for the child and take over raising her.Flash-forward nearly a quarter-century and that girl has grown into International porn-star/actress Lili (Phoebe Cates). It seems the now-famous-and-powerful Lili has pulled herself out of the gutter and is ready to extract her revenge on the mother than abandoned her. But first she needs to find out ""Which one of those bitches"" is her mother.This sets the story in motion, as we see Maxine, Pagan and Judy at various stages after graduation dealing with rich sultans, wine tycoons and the Vietnam War. The framing device that unleashes the flashbacks is a novel that teenage Judy had penned titled ""The Adventures of Lucinda Lace"".There is drama a-plenty, much of it over-the-top. Cates speaks in a non-descript Eurotrash accent and chain-smokes throughout. The three female leads are all likeable but no single one stands out. The men, on the other hand, are quite unremarkable.There was one moment of real drama and suspense when the young Lili and her adoptive parents are trying to cross the border near Budapest and are chased through the woods by dogs and soldiers. Otherwise, this is high-camp extraordinaire; imagine ""Dynasty"" on steroids.""Lace"" is not brilliant television (not even for its time). It's trash (though trash of the highest order). The producers likely knew this, so they tried to disguise the fact with dozens of glamorous outfits and hairdos; expansive, exotic locales and lots of ripe dialogue. And you know what, they pulled it off.In one of the rare cases of style over substance being a good thing, they manage to make you forget that what you're watching is really a giant turd, because it's served up on a silver platter with pretty, colorful garnishes to disguise the fact it's nothing but a pile of dung.But it IS positively engrossing. You just can't wait to see what happens next. I dare you to try and watch ""Lace"" and not turn it off half-way!After many years of fans' cries to get this on DVD, Warner finally released it as part of their Warner Archives collection which is Manufacture-on-Demand and not readily available in stores.For a rainy weekend, ""Lace"" will bring back fun memories for Gen X-ers, and be an interesting historical artifact of the trashy, excessive '80s to show their kids.",4,A Giant Turd in a Beautiful Package,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,3429,"['Based', 'trashy', 'Shirley', 'Conran', 'novel', 'Lace', 'was', 'more-than-successfully', 'adapted', 'small', 'screen', 'two-part', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'February', '1984.Those', 'who', 'were', 'teenagers', '1984', 'remember', 'was', 'program', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking', 'next', 'day', 'school', 'shocking', 'cliff-hanger', 'ending', 'infamous', 'Which', 'one', 'bitches', 'mother', 'line', 'was', 'everyone', 'lips', 'book', 'had', 'four', 'schoolgirls', 'main', 'characters', 'TV', 'version', 'wisely', 'got', 'rid', 'one', 'so', 'main', 'cast', 'Maxine', 'Pagan', 'Judy', 'trio', 'getting', 'ready', 'graduate', 'exclusive', 'Swiss', 'boarding', 'school', 'circa', '1960', 'where', 'engage', 'typical', 'teenage', 'behaviours', 'smoking', 'sly', 'dorm', 'room', 'mocking', 'elders', 'chasing', 'boys.A', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'dance', 'having', 'issues', 'various', 'beaus', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'one', 'girls', 'one', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'up', 'pregnant.With', 'help', 'Maxine', 'rich', 'Aunt', 'Hortense', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'make', 'pact', 'hide', 'pregnancy', 'give', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'first', 'one', 'establish', 'solid', 'career', 'will', 'send', 'child', 'take', 'over', 'raising', 'her.Flash-forward', 'nearly', 'quarter-century', 'girl', 'grown', 'International', 'porn-star/actress', 'Lili', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'now-famous-and-powerful', 'Lili', 'pulled', 'gutter', 'ready', 'extract', 'revenge', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'first', 'find', 'out', 'Which', 'one', 'bitches', 'mother.This', 'story', 'motion', 'see', 'Maxine', 'Pagan', 'Judy', 'various', 'stages', 'graduation', 'dealing', 'rich', 'sultans', 'wine', 'tycoons', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'framing', 'device', 'flashbacks', 'novel', 'teenage', 'Judy', 'had', 'penned', 'titled', 'Adventures', 'Lucinda', 'Lace', 'drama', 'a-plenty', 'much', 'over-the-top', 'Cates', 'non-descript', 'Eurotrash', 'accent', 'chain-smokes', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'likeable', 'single', 'one', 'out', 'men', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'quite', 'unremarkable.There', 'was', 'one', 'moment', 'real', 'drama', 'suspense', 'when', 'young', 'Lili', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'cross', 'border', 'Budapest', 'are', 'chased', 'woods', 'dogs', 'soldiers', 'Otherwise', 'high-camp', 'extraordinaire', 'imagine', 'Dynasty', 'steroids', 'Lace', 'not', 'brilliant', 'television', 'not', 'even', 'time', 'trash', 'trash', 'highest', 'order', 'producers', 'likely', 'knew', 'tried', 'disguise', 'fact', 'dozens', 'glamorous', 'outfits', 'hairdos', 'expansive', 'exotic', 'locales', 'lots', 'ripe', 'dialogue', 'know', 'what', 'pulled', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'style', 'substance', 'being', 'good', 'thing', 'manage', 'make', 'forget', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'really', 'giant', 'turd', 'served', 'up', 'silver', 'platter', 'pretty', 'colorful', 'garnishes', 'disguise', 'fact', 'nothing', 'pile', 'dung.But', 'positively', 'engrossing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'dare', 'try', 'watch', 'Lace', 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'half-way', 'many', 'years', 'fans', 'cries', 'get', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'finally', 'released', 'part', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'collection', 'Manufacture-on-Demand', 'not', 'readily', 'available', 'stores.For', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'Lace', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'fun', 'memories', 'Gen', 'X-ers', 'be', 'interesting', 'historical', 'artifact', 'trashy', 'excessive', ""'80s"", 'show', 'kids']",N/A

""Martin Boucher""","[4, 4]","When supervixen Lili utters the now infamous line ""Which one of you bitches is my mother?"" in the digitally re-mastered LACE now out on DVD, no doubt a huge collective sigh of relief must have been heard everywhere.  Indeed, after years of demanding that the ABC two night 1984 television event be available on DVD, fans of the popular miniseries finally got their wish come true with the help of Warner Brothers who owns the rights. Surely a big thank you to them is in order.  So thank you, WB. That being said, let's not beat around the bush and declare that the overall delivery of this sought-after item is perhaps a bit of a let down with the missing chapters and nowhere to found extra features.  Oh, the clear picture and sound quality rock--just as of owning a legitimate copy of this wonderful gem does--no doubt about it; but let's be quite frank here: yes, you may have done us one big favor in releasing this title, WB, but the fun alas stops right there. We expected a bit more from you guys.  Now, all you need to do to make it up to us is to re-release this hot commodity with all the extra goodies it so much deserves and make a promise to never again shortchanged fans of miniseries of this caliber. For sure a bigger sigh of relief will shake the nation when that happens.-----Martin Boucher",4,A Definite Classic,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1310,"['When', 'supervixen', 'Lili', 'now', 'infamous', 'line', 'Which', 'one', 'bitches', 'mother', 'digitally', 're-mastered', 'LACE', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'huge', 'collective', 'sigh', 'relief', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'heard', 'everywhere', 'Indeed', 'years', 'demanding', 'ABC', 'two', 'night', '1984', 'television', 'event', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'fans', 'popular', 'miniseries', 'finally', 'got', 'wish', 'come', 'true', 'help', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'who', 'rights', 'Surely', 'big', 'thank', 'order', 'So', 'thank', 'WB', 'being', 'said', 'let', 'not', 'beat', 'bush', 'declare', 'overall', 'delivery', 'sought-after', 'item', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'missing', 'chapters', 'nowhere', 'found', 'extra', 'features', 'Oh', 'clear', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'rock', 'just', 'owning', 'legitimate', 'copy', 'wonderful', 'gem', 'doubt', 'let', 'be', 'quite', 'frank', 'here', 'yes', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'big', 'favor', 'releasing', 'title', 'WB', 'fun', 'alas', 'stops', 'right', 'there', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'guys', 'Now', 'need', 'do', 'make', 'up', 're-release', 'hot', 'commodity', 'extra', 'goodies', 'so', 'much', 'deserves', 'make', 'promise', 'never', 'again', 'shortchanged', 'fans', 'miniseries', 'caliber', 'sure', 'bigger', 'sigh', 'relief', 'will', 'shake', 'nation', 'when', 'happens.', 'Boucher']",N/A
