It does not have the slick animation that the others have, but it does not seem to need it.  Baby us glued to the screen whenever I show it, and started using the signs after the second viewing.  It has a lot more signs than other DVDs and both the segment for parents and the included booklet are full of even more signs.  This is really a learning resource!I have seen the DVD at least a dozen times now, and I still like watching it.",5,Wow!,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,506,"['third', 'baby', 'sign', 'language', 'DVD', 'bought', '2-year', 'old', 'not', 'have', 'slick', 'animation', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'seem', 'need', 'Baby', 'glued', 'screen', 'whenever', 'show', 'started', 'using', 'signs', 'second', 'viewing', 'lot', 'more', 'signs', 'other', 'DVDs', 'segment', 'parents', 'included', 'booklet', 'are', 'full', 'even', 'more', 'signs', 'really', 'learning', 'resource', 'have', 'seen', 'DVD', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'now', 'still', 'watching']",My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs

954605,A1MFIVHYJS11WY,B000C3L27A,"Kathy Carrington ""book fiend""","[2, 2]","My daughter (18 months now!) loves this series.  She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.The only odd thing I've noticed is with the Mommy and Daddy signs.  These are hard concepts to get across in a video and my daughter has ended up thinking all women are called mommy and all men are daddy.  My husband and I are still DADDY and MOMMY however - note the captial letters - so I don't see it as a problem.  In time she will learn that the correct word for other women is WOMAN and the correct word for other men is MAN.",5,Great series!,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,950,"['daughter', '18', 'months', 'now', 'series', 'whenever', 'put', 'on.We', 'started', 'showing', 'series', '7', 'months', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'interested', '13', 'months', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'quickly', 'began', 'making', 'signs', 'point.Her', 'verbal', 'skills', 'are', 'expanding', 'rapidly', 'point', 'pronunciation', 'still', 'horrible', 'most', 'toddlers', 'only', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'Signing', 'get', 'point', 'much', 'more', 'easily', 'far', 'less', 'frustrated.The', 'only', 'odd', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'signs', 'are', 'hard', 'concepts', 'get', 'video', 'daughter', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', 'women', 'are', 'called', 'mommy', 'men', 'are', 'daddy', 'husband', 'are', 'still', 'DADDY', 'MOMMY', 'however', 'note', 'captial', 'letters', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'time', 'will', 'learn', 'correct', 'word', 'other', 'women', 'WOMAN', 'correct', 'word', 'other', 'men', 'MAN']",My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs

I have been signing with my children for 6 years and can say that they really loved this DVD.The selection of signs presented is very good. I was happy to see ""please, share and thank you"" included. Even if a child is too young to fully understand the concept, introducing it at an early age creates polite requests which everyone can benefit from.The music, as before, is excellent and pleasant for baby and parent to listen to. The activities shown and how Baby Hands Productions chose to illustrate each sign is very unique and holds my children's interest. It is fun to watch and I really enjoy watching my kids learn signs from the DVD. It's not limited to babies and preschoolers - my 7- and 10-year-old sons get into it as well!Good job!!",5,Excellent DVD for little ones on up,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,837,"['My', 'Baby', 'Can', 'Talk', 'First', 'Signs', 'children', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'extremely', 'engaging', 'have', 'been', 'signing', 'children', '6', 'years', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'loved', 'DVD.The', 'selection', 'signs', 'presented', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'please', 'share', 'thank', 'included', 'Even', 'child', 'too', 'young', 'fully', 'understand', 'concept', 'introducing', 'early', 'age', 'polite', 'requests', 'everyone', 'can', 'benefit', 'from.The', 'music', 'excellent', 'pleasant', 'baby', 'parent', 'listen', 'activities', 'shown', 'how', 'Baby', 'Hands', 'Productions', 'chose', 'illustrate', 'sign', 'very', 'unique', 'children', 'interest', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'kids', 'learn', 'signs', 'DVD', 'not', 'limited', 'babies', 'preschoolers', '7-', '10-year-old', 'sons', 'get', 'as', 'well', 'Good', 'job']",My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs

This coupled with more frequent non-sequential video clips giving a general busy feeling. The signs are less pronounced as a result. The rhymes have lost its creativity as well.My son lost interest after 20 minutes into it and asked for ""Baby Einstein"". I have to watch the later half on my own.
