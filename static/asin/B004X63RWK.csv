1431467,AA231NH7SQZ4P,B004X63RWK,Blitzkrieg,"[0, 0]","This is a film that Sam Fuller wrote, directed, produced, and paid for himself. It really captures the time period it is portraying with great sets and costumes. It never tries too hard to tell anything more than the story it sets out to, the birth of the modern newspaper. For those who only know Sam's pulp fiction films, don't expect that sort of thing with Park Row. His love of the subject was personal and great, since Sam himself had worked in the paper's, before he joined up to fight the Nazi's in North Africa. His fondness of the pioneers of modern print comes through in every written word of the script and spoken by the great actor's who inhabit the film. It's a valentine to the industry that gave him his first career and jump started his love of storytelling.The print for this release is mostly in good shape and does not detract from the viewing experience.",4,Linotype!

My set of ""Highway Patrol, Season One"" is chock full of problems, but because it's a 12-disc set, I didn't catch the problems until after the 45-day warranty ran out.Now, Amazon won't take back that 12-disc set, so I'm just out the $50++ cost.Well, it won't happen again.Once I get my refund on ""Park Row,"" I'm finished with this MGM M.O.D. line.If ever there was a case of ""let the buyer beware,"" this is it.",1,Right DVD CASE-- WRONG MOVIE on Disc!,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,1270,"['Park', 'Row', 'one', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'movie', 'many', 'Fuller', 'fans', 'including', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', '.well', 'wait', 'continues.I', 'received', 'copy', 'Park', 'Row', 'week', 'DVD', 'case', 'disc', 'are', 'labeled', 'Park', 'Row', 'However', 'when', 'went', 'play', 'film', 'Harry', 'Pocket', 'was', 'disc', 'NOT', 'Park', 'Row', ""'m"", 'going', 'return', 'Amazon', ""'ve"", 'discovered', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'happened', 'will', 'NOT', 'ask', 'replacement.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'opt', 'refund.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'company', 'manufactured', 'MGM', 'Movies-On-Demand', 'discs', 'was', 'dumped', 'mistakes', 'as', 'well', 'lots', ""'freeze-up"", 'image', 'problems', 'discs', 'would', ""n't"", 'load', 'properly', '.Now', '2nd', 'manufacturer', 'MGM', 'M.O.D', 'products', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'first', 'manufacturer.I', 'got', 'stuck', 'first', 'MGM', 'line', 'set', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'Season', 'One', 'chock', 'full', 'problems', '12-disc', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'problems', '45-day', 'warranty', 'ran', 'out.Now', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', '12-disc', 'set', ""'m"", 'just', '50++', 'cost.Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'again.Once', 'get', 'refund', 'Park', 'Row', ""'m"", 'finished', 'MGM', 'M.O.D', 'line.If', 'ever', 'was', 'case', 'let', 'buyer', 'beware']",Park Row
