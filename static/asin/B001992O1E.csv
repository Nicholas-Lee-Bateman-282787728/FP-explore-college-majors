He plays a police officer that mysteriously loses the love of his life. He searches for her at Wolf Lake. We all know what is happing but it is fun to learn of this mysterious place through the eyes of John Kanin. You will not get a blow by blow from me. However you will soon be wolfing down each episode.

Series like this that are a touch quirky take alittle longer to find its footing,& would of loved many more episodes of this unique series. I loved it & still do. Thankfully i've got it on dvd & have had it for quite a few yrs now & watch it atleast 3-5 times a yr. Would of loved to find out if Lou Diamond would of ended up turning & if he'd of found Ruby. I like the whole cast & the setting itself is another character, espically since humans have a hard time seeing into the deep dark woods at night & don't have a clue if anything is looking out at them...

Wolf Lake was a nice escapism series and just when it started hitting its stride it was gone. But thanks to sci-fi and of course dvd/blu-ray it can be checked out again.

1162207,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B001992O1E,K. Boullosa,"[58, 59]","I'm waiting impatiently for this series to come out on DVD.  It was one of those shows that you both laugh at and enjoy sitting down to when you need easy entertainment.  The premise: a town where many of the inhabitants experience a ""change"" in their teens that is more than just the usual hormonal mayhem, and folks are divided into those who do and those who either don't or won't.  It's a bit thin on its face, but is nevertheless appealing to those of us who enjoy the idea of secret magical communities and transformation stories. The core conflicts are the mischief made by these powerful teen werewolves, who pay only as much attention to outside restrictions, such as school, as necesssary to keep up appearances; the ""will she or won't she"" anguish of the sherriff's pretty daughter, ripe for her transformation but torn between her father's values and the call of the wild (Dad married ""out"", declined to join the pack, and doesn't want the daughter to join, either); the search for Ruby Wilder, the missing fiancee of an outside law enforcement agent; and the fight for leadership of the next generation of the pack among the Cates family, who currently head it up.  The young people are, of course, deadly attractive (dig those white teeth!), and the adults go along with good humor and straight faces, notably Tim Matheson as Sheriff Donner, trying to keep his daughter from going over, and Lou Diamond Phillips as John Kanin, the cop who has traced his missing girlfriend, Ruby, as far as Wolf Lake.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead at an earlier point in her now slightly larger career, does a nice turn as Sheriff Donner's daughter, Sophia, trying to figure out whether or not to howl with the clan. Great fun, in this reviewer's opinion, rarely re-run on television, and would be a welcome addition to the TV library if only you all would get off your butts and release it!",3,Great Cheesy Fun,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,1883,"[""'m"", 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'down', 'when', 'need', 'easy', 'entertainment', 'premise', 'town', 'where', 'many', 'inhabitants', 'experience', 'change', 'teens', 'more', 'just', 'usual', 'hormonal', 'mayhem', 'folks', 'are', 'divided', 'who', 'do', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'bit', 'thin', 'face', 'nevertheless', 'appealing', 'who', 'enjoy', 'idea', 'secret', 'magical', 'communities', 'transformation', 'stories', 'core', 'conflicts', 'are', 'mischief', 'made', 'powerful', 'teen', 'werewolves', 'who', 'pay', 'only', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'outside', 'restrictions', 'such', 'school', 'necesssary', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'anguish', 'sherriff', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'ripe', 'transformation', 'torn', 'father', 'values', 'call', 'wild', 'Dad', 'married', 'declined', 'join', 'pack', ""n't"", 'want', 'daughter', 'join', 'search', 'Ruby', 'Wilder', 'missing', 'fiancee', 'outside', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agent', 'fight', 'leadership', 'next', 'generation', 'pack', 'Cates', 'family', 'who', 'currently', 'head', 'up', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'course', 'deadly', 'attractive', 'dig', 'white', 'teeth', 'adults', 'go', 'along', 'good', 'humor', 'straight', 'notably', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Sheriff', 'Donner', 'trying', 'keep', 'daughter', 'going', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'John', 'Kanin', 'cop', 'who', 'traced', 'missing', 'girlfriend', 'Ruby', 'as', 'far', 'Wolf', 'Lake', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'earlier', 'point', 'now', 'slightly', 'larger', 'career', 'nice', 'turn', 'Sheriff', 'Donner', 'daughter', 'Sophia', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'howl', 'clan', 'Great', 'fun', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'rarely', 're-run', 'television', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'addition', 'TV', 'library', 'only', 'would', 'get', 'off', 'butts', 'release']",Wolf Lake 2001 TV series
