400910,A2LJKDPRVR907S,6304097808,Lisa Siegel,"[0, 0]","I remember watching Night of the Twisters when it first aired on the Family Channel back in 1996.  I had read the book when I was in 5th grade, and I thought this was a very good adaptation.  For a TV movie, the special effects for the tornadoes were very well done.  I had wanted to purchase the VHS tape when it became available, but never got around to it.  When I saw that there was a DVD for the movie, I bought it.  It's really nice watching the movie without commercials.I really liked the casting choices -- especially Dan Hatch.  Who wouldn't want to see Devon Sawa in his teenage years?  He was a little older than I had pictured Danny being in the book, but it still worked quite well.  John Schneider as Jack Hatch was another good casting move.  I felt he was a little too harsh at times, but other than that it was a good portrayal.I found it interesting that this was released the same year as Twister was.  If you compare the two, of course Twister is going to have the better CGI special effects, but I am not going to compare the two movies, as they are completely different from one another.If you liked the book, you'll most likely like the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who is old enough to read the book since they will know what to expect when the twisters come.",4,Great Adaptaion of the Book,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1296,"['remember', 'watching', 'Night', 'Twisters', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'Family', 'Channel', 'back', '1996', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'was', '5th', 'grade', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'TV', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'tornadoes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'had', 'wanted', 'purchase', 'VHS', 'tape', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'never', 'got', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'DVD', 'movie', 'bought', 'really', 'nice', 'watching', 'movie', 'commercials.I', 'really', 'liked', 'casting', 'choices', 'especially', 'Dan', 'Hatch', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'teenage', 'years', 'was', 'little', 'older', 'had', 'pictured', 'Danny', 'being', 'book', 'still', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Jack', 'Hatch', 'was', 'good', 'casting', 'move', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'harsh', 'times', 'other', 'was', 'good', 'portrayal.I', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Twister', 'was', 'compare', 'two', 'course', 'Twister', 'going', 'have', 'better', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'one', 'another.If', 'liked', 'book', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'twisters', 'come']",Night of the Twisters VHS
