1300198,A10VCNH9CMDERZ,B002ZFKE90,Markku Ojanen,"[17, 18]","This is really a comprehensive collection. That is its best feature. But remember, the older the show, the poorer the quality. Some of these are really of poor quality. Included are some first parts of serials (Rocky Jones, Flash Gordon). These are quite terrible. One must be really nostalgic in order to watch those silly efects. Perhaps this makes it fun for some. Some of the shows are in other packages, but it does not bother much. Some of the comedies were too much for my taste, but these depend on what you like. There are a few I have not watched, yet, but The Deputy was a very fine episode with good film quality, too. I liked also Cowboy G-men. Sergeant Preston has great color and natural vistas. The cost is not much for 101 ""classics"", some of which did not last long.
