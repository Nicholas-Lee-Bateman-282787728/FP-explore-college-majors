I wasn't expecting much since anyone with even a passing PR acquaintance knows who won Season 1 and the runners up who went to Fashion Week.  Nevertheless I found the season fascinating and addictive and even a bit suspenseful.PR in season 3 really had a fairly high caliber of competition, a bigger budget and higher profile sponsors.  It was very interesting watching the show find its footing in the first season.  There were some favorite challenges like the Postal Uniform one, and the Look of the Future where they had to design an entire collection for 2055.  And of course there were the two who made the whole season worth watching--Jay with his snark and big gay fabulousness and Wendy Pepper with her combination of ruthlessness and wanting to be looooved.  She is definitely a love-to-hate reality show character!Some of the suspense is inevitably lost, of course, by knowing how it all turned out, but watching the various people get there is still great entertainment.  Also, I didn't know enough to know the order of how all the lesser also-rans went out, so some of the elimination segments were still nail-biters for me as I rooted for people who I knew didn't go all the way to at least get past that round.If you have never watched PR and want to know what all the hoopla is about, why not start at the beginning?

933226,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B000ATQYSS,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[1, 2]","I was immediately hooked when I caught some re-runs of this show on Bravo, and decided to buy the DVDs...ALL OF THEM! As an artist and photographer, I was immediately captured by the premise of the creative challenges presented to the budding designers each week. Heidi Klum is the attractive hostess of the show, ably supported by Tim Gunn, the Director of the renowned Parsons New School of Design. 12 hopeful designers start off the competition, and are eliminated one at a time each week after they are evaluated by judges (including designer Michael Kors & Nina Garcia from Elle Magazine) on the runway for their fashion creations. Some of the creative challenges include using things purchased at a grocery store to create a dress, re-designing the uniform of a postal worker (after spending a day in the field wearing the uniform), and working with the models (who also get eliminated one at a time each week) to create the model's ideal wedding gown. Reality TV is usually about the drama and contrived situations; do they exist here? Sure, however, it is refreshing to see that the majority of the show is about design and critiquing the unique creations that the designers whip up...and I do mean whip, as each challenge is done with very little lead time. The last 3 ""survivors"" get to exhibit an entire line at New York's Fashion week (actress Parker Posey sits in as one of the judges), with the grand prize including a photo spread in Elle Magazine and $100k in funding to create their own design line of clothes.Extras on the DVD include ""Wear Are They Now"" featurettes for the final 5 designers; deleted scenes (which are best watching AFTER you watch the episodes, as they show further behind-the-scenes antics of the 12 contestants); a design photo gallery for all 12 designers.An excellent set for up-and-coming designers as well as models. This show is a class act that rarely gets bogged down in the emotional drama (although there are a few choice scenes!).",5,FINALLY!

Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints. The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show. The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!"" And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques. And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.But at the core of it all is the fashion.

933237,ADSCVPRCMTDY6,B000ATQYSS,La Blue Eyes,"[4, 5]","I watched the 1st season of Project Runway for the first time just today.  I had never even heard of the show until last month (no cable) so I watched the 2nd season to try it out.  Because of watching it I knew how the first season ended, but decided to watch it anyway because I liked the designers in the 2nd season.  Well, I wasn't impressed with the first season and my main bother was, why did all the designers hate Wendy?  I honestly watched the whole season and was mystified at the complete hatred that the show, viewers and even reviewers on this site had to Wendy.  What exactly was it that she did that was so awful? ***Spoiler Alert***I can only conceive of two instances - when she dissed two of her fellow designers on the runway.  However the first was required and the second was true.  So, where was all the manipulation that was spoken of and that warranted them saying she didn't have a soul and being ""the evil one""?  I found this whole situation of exaggerated emotions completely ridiculous and contrived.  I'm not ignorant, I know the situation was drawn out by the producers, but it mystifies me that hardly anyone seems to see that. Wendy is STILL the evil one, even after all these years though there is nothing there really to show why she is.  Any negative remark she made is zeroed on, while whatever her fellow contestants said that wasn't positive was brushed off or considered deserved.  I had to laugh when at the ""reunion"" the general opinion of Wendy was very negative when the majority of the designers weren't even on the show anymore when the hostility really started to grow.  The negative opinions weren't contrived because of actual fact, but because it was a popularity contest.  If Wendy hadn't beat out Austin as the final three, who was the wonder boy and fave of the season, I know they wouldn't have wasted so much negative emotion on her.",3,Why is Wendy the evil one?,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1888,"['watched', '1st', 'season', 'Project', 'Runway', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'today', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'show', 'last', 'month', 'cable', 'so', 'watched', '2nd', 'season', 'try', 'out', 'watching', 'knew', 'how', 'first', 'season', 'ended', 'decided', 'watch', 'anyway', 'liked', 'designers', '2nd', 'season', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'first', 'season', 'main', 'bother', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'designers', 'hate', 'Wendy', 'honestly', 'watched', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'mystified', 'complete', 'hatred', 'show', 'viewers', 'even', 'reviewers', 'site', 'had', 'Wendy', 'What', 'exactly', 'was', 'did', 'was', 'so', 'awful', '***Spoiler', 'Alert***I', 'can', 'only', 'conceive', 'two', 'instances', 'when', 'dissed', 'two', 'fellow', 'designers', 'runway', 'However', 'first', 'was', 'required', 'second', 'was', 'true', 'So', 'where', 'was', 'manipulation', 'was', 'spoken', 'warranted', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'soul', 'being', 'evil', 'one', 'found', 'whole', 'situation', 'exaggerated', 'emotions', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'contrived', ""'m"", 'not', 'ignorant', 'know', 'situation', 'was', 'drawn', 'out', 'producers', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'see', 'Wendy', 'STILL', 'evil', 'one', 'even', 'years', 'nothing', 'there', 'really', 'show', 'why', 'Any', 'negative', 'remark', 'made', 'zeroed', 'fellow', 'contestants', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'positive', 'was', 'brushed', 'off', 'considered', 'deserved', 'had', 'laugh', 'when', 'reunion', 'general', 'opinion', 'Wendy', 'was', 'very', 'negative', 'when', 'majority', 'designers', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'anymore', 'when', 'hostility', 'really', 'started', 'grow', 'negative', 'opinions', 'were', ""n't"", 'contrived', 'actual', 'fact', 'was', 'popularity', 'contest', 'Wendy', 'had', ""n't"", 'beat', 'out', 'Austin', 'final', 'three', 'who', 'was', 'wonder', 'boy', 'fave', 'season', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wasted', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'emotion']",Project Runway - The Complete First Season

933247,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B000ATQYSS,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[6, 6]","What sets ""Project Runway"" apart are innovative contests - the first project (called ""Innovation"") sets the tone, as it actually involves the designers going to a grocery store with $50 and being required to build an outfit out of things they find at the store. The challenges during the series are just that - challenges; they don't take it easy on the contestants and require definite skill to succeed. The results of the tasks are definitely interesting to see, as there are some that are remarkably creative, and others that just don't work.Another refreshing point about ""Runway"" is although there are definitely big personalities in the pool of contestants and the show does show some catfights and arguments, the series focuses more on the actual work that the contestants are trying to do. Additionally, some of the people are actually pleasant to one another, which is a real shocker for a reality series. Additionally, Heidi Klum actually makes a very good host, managing to not keep the focus on her in her scenes, and yet not be so subdued that she becomes a non-factor. It's a tough balance, but she achieves it quite well. The pacing and documentary-style cinematography are also faster and sharper than most similar shows on TV today.Extra FeaturesThe bonus features are fun, included is a series of rather interesting ""WEAR Are They Now?"" segments, as well as deleted ""SEAMS"" and a pictorial gallery of some of the designers work throughout the course of the show. The ""WEAR"" segment catches up with Jay, Kara Saun, Austin, Robert, and Wendy. Totaling 40 minutes in length (all combined) I found these to be fairly interesting, offering a rather extensive look into what the designers have been doing since the show's conclusion. The deleted scenes (with a total run time of 15 minutes) offer the typical helping of ""the stuff we didn't show"" scenes where the camera was too shaky for the footage to make the final cut.  Lastly, the designer gallery is simply a slide show of the designers work including final products of clothing they made, as well as looks at sketches of ideas that they may have had during the creative design process. There are no audio commentaries on this disc set but hopefully there will be one in a future season release.I really enjoy watching Runway, although I do not always agree with the voted off designer, it remains an edgy an innovative show. I think that just might be the charm of the show.  We all have our personal favorites but you can never be sure who will win !!  Each week when the current episode airs, I call my sister and we gossip through the entire show each trying to predict the winner and loser !!!",5,"~* I hope Project Runway ""Carries On"" for many seasons to come  ~*",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2667,"['What', 'Project', 'Runway', 'apart', 'are', 'innovative', 'contests', 'first', 'project', 'called', 'Innovation', 'tone', 'actually', 'designers', 'going', 'grocery', 'store', '50', 'being', 'required', 'build', 'outfit', 'things', 'find', 'store', 'challenges', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'challenges', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'contestants', 'require', 'definite', 'skill', 'succeed', 'results', 'tasks', 'are', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'see', 'are', 'are', 'remarkably', 'creative', 'others', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work.Another', 'refreshing', 'point', 'Runway', 'are', 'definitely', 'big', 'personalities', 'pool', 'contestants', 'show', 'show', 'catfights', 'arguments', 'series', 'more', 'actual', 'work', 'contestants', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'Additionally', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'pleasant', 'one', 'real', 'shocker', 'reality', 'series', 'Additionally', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'host', 'managing', 'not', 'keep', 'focus', 'scenes', 'yet', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'subdued', 'non-factor', 'tough', 'balance', 'quite', 'well', 'pacing', 'documentary-style', 'cinematography', 'are', 'also', 'faster', 'sharper', 'most', 'similar', 'shows', 'TV', 'today.Extra', 'FeaturesThe', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'fun', 'included', 'series', 'rather', 'interesting', 'WEAR', 'Are', 'Now', 'segments', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'SEAMS', 'pictorial', 'gallery', 'designers', 'work', 'course', 'show', 'WEAR', 'segment', 'up', 'Jay', 'Kara', 'Saun', 'Austin', 'Robert', 'Wendy', 'Totaling', '40', 'minutes', 'length', 'combined', 'found', 'be', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'offering', 'rather', 'extensive', 'look', 'what', 'designers', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'show', 'conclusion', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', 'run', 'time', '15', 'minutes', 'offer', 'typical', 'helping', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'scenes', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'too', 'shaky', 'footage', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'Lastly', 'designer', 'gallery', 'simply', 'slide', 'show', 'designers', 'work', 'including', 'final', 'products', 'clothing', 'made', 'as', 'well', 'looks', 'sketches', 'ideas', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'creative', 'design', 'process', 'are', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'set', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'future', 'season', 'release.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Runway', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'agree', 'voted', 'designer', 'edgy', 'innovative', 'show', 'think', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'charm', 'show', 'have', 'personal', 'favorites', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'week', 'when', 'current', 'episode', 'airs', 'call', 'sister', 'gossip', 'entire', 'show', 'trying', 'predict', 'winner', 'loser']",Project Runway - The Complete First Season
