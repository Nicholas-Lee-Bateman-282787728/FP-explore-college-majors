734778,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B000087F5T,Brett D. Cullum,"[6, 6]","INSOMNIAC is probably one of the best travel shows produced! A blur of streets, bars, and clubs all across the country - it shows more of what you will see in a city if you head there.  No exotic places, just real people doing there own thing late at night.  All hosted by regular funny guy Dave Attell!  He's a likable comedian that seems more like the guy next door.  Here is REALITY TV finally!  Well ... there is one notable production illusion.  The show is shot over two nights and not one!  But why fault it for that white lie?  The DVD holds 5 episodes from the series.  No notable extras are here except that no body parts are blurred and no language bleeped.  It's not a whole season, and there is little insight into the show itself.  But what could you offer?  Maybe outtakes and bloopers!  Commentary seems a little useless for a documentary show that is 100% commentary in itself.  Behind the scenes could be nice.  But I'll settle for no commercials and 5 strong episodes of one of my favorite shows!",4,Stay awake for Dave!,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,1015,"['INSOMNIAC', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'travel', 'shows', 'produced', 'blur', 'streets', 'bars', 'clubs', 'country', 'more', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'city', 'head', 'there', 'exotic', 'places', 'just', 'real', 'people', 'doing', 'there', 'own', 'thing', 'late', 'night', 'hosted', 'regular', 'funny', 'guy', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'likable', 'comedian', 'more', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'Here', 'REALITY', 'TV', 'finally', 'Well', 'one', 'notable', 'production', 'illusion', 'show', 'shot', 'two', 'nights', 'not', 'one', 'why', 'fault', 'white', 'lie', 'DVD', '5', 'episodes', 'series', 'No', 'notable', 'extras', 'are', 'here', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'blurred', 'language', 'bleeped', 'not', 'whole', 'season', 'little', 'insight', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'offer', 'Maybe', 'outtakes', 'bloopers', 'Commentary', 'little', 'useless', 'documentary', 'show', '100', '%', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'nice', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'commercials', '5', 'strong', 'episodes', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows']",The Best of Insomniac: Uncensored - Volume 1
734779,AD7WSMZTFWHKZ,B000087F5T,Buddy James Fazzio,"[37, 41]","Insomniac is one of my favorite TV shows. I love watching each week as Dave tours city after city in his own twisted alchoholic comedian type persona. If I visited these towns, these are the places I would go. It's a great idea and a great show.But this DVD gives us nothing new. No new footage at all, just the original shows uncensored. We get to hear the bleeped cussing and we get to see a little nudity. But, like another reviewer said, the show really isn't about that, and honestly, the nudity we do get to see is not really worth seeing (Okay, the chick in Montreal is nice, but otherwise it's nothing exciting).I was really hoping for some behind the scenes stuff. Maybe bloopers, out takes, and deleted scenes, or stuff so shocking or sexy it had to be cut out all together on the TV edition. I was hoping to see Brian the cameraman. All you get on this DVD is the exact same show you saw on TV without the Bleeps and the Blurs.And who picked these cities as the best of season one anyway? The New York episode on this DVD is from season 2, and it is the worst of the three times Dave has done New York. The two New York episodes that really were in Season one were both great, and where is Memphis. That was the best epsiode from season one, hands down!Anyway, love the show, love Dave Attell, totally dissapointed in the DVD.",2,"I love this show, but the DVD is not worth the money",1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,1337,"['Insomniac', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'love', 'watching', 'week', 'Dave', 'tours', 'city', 'city', 'own', 'twisted', 'alchoholic', 'comedian', 'type', 'persona', 'visited', 'towns', 'are', 'places', 'would', 'go', 'great', 'idea', 'great', 'show.But', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'new', 'new', 'footage', 'just', 'original', 'shows', 'uncensored', 'get', 'hear', 'bleeped', 'cussing', 'get', 'see', 'little', 'nudity', 'reviewer', 'said', 'show', 'really', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'nudity', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Okay', 'chick', 'Montreal', 'nice', 'otherwise', 'nothing', 'exciting', '.I', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'Maybe', 'bloopers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'so', 'shocking', 'sexy', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'together', 'TV', 'edition', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'Brian', 'cameraman', 'get', 'DVD', 'exact', 'same', 'show', 'saw', 'TV', 'Bleeps', 'Blurs.And', 'who', 'picked', 'cities', 'best', 'season', 'one', 'anyway', 'New', 'York', 'episode', 'DVD', 'season', '2', 'worst', 'three', 'times', 'Dave', 'done', 'New', 'York', 'two', 'New', 'York', 'really', 'were', 'Season', 'one', 'were', 'great', 'where', 'Memphis', 'was', 'best', 'epsiode', 'season', 'one', 'down', 'Anyway', 'love', 'show', 'love', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'totally', 'dissapointed', 'DVD']",The Best of Insomniac: Uncensored - Volume 1

On this DVD, Dave starts in New Orleans.  A little stand-up routine in a club that will get you laughing.  Then he takes you on a late night, all-night tour of what's happening in New Orleans while most normal people sleep.  This is the standard for all Insomniac episodes.  Dave visits a bar and drinks. Maybe two bars or three.  Talks with people on the street.  Some get crazy (females and males) to expose themselves for the camera.  All nudity and language is shown on this DVD, that was originally edited and blurred on Comedy Central cable network.  What is edited on this DVD is beer cans and telephone numbers.  No advertising beer names.  But we all know what Dave is drinking don't we?  Dave is alot of fun and he is funny too.  He will take you to many other cool places from 10:00pm until 7:00am.  It's educational too.  Adults Only! This DVD includes only five episodes. Dave visits New Orleans, Louisiana. Houston, Texas. Chicago, Illinois. Montreal, Canada. New York City, New York (last episode of first season).  The New Orleans, Houston and New York episodes are from the first season in 2001.  The Chicago and Montreal episodes are from the second season in 2002.

The guy's funny, sarcastic and very entertaining.  So I knew the show would be good.  After seeing an episode of the new season, I decided to get the DVD ""The Best of Insomniac with Dave Attell: Volume 1.""  The show goes to show you that the fun and hijinx of comedy doesn't end when the act or set is over.Dave Attell is the host and takes you on a journey full of booze, women, interesting people and wild parties.  As soon as his comedy act is over, that's when he takes you for a ride you won't forget.  And what's great is that this is an uncensored look, meaning that the language and other shenanigans that could never air on Comedy Central without being bleeped or blurred is here.  Get ready to enjoy the nightlife as you cruise around with Dave in the cities of Chicago,  Houston, New Orleans, New York and Montreal.The show is very original and unique.  It doesn't fail to entertain for a second.  It's 107 minutes long, giving you tons of material to watch.  Although it would've been nice to have the complete season of the show, this is still a nice thing to have.  And you know there will be a Volume 2 coming out in the near future.""The Best of Insomniac with Dave Attell: Volume 1"" is more than enjoyable.  It's funny, edgy, entertaining and memorable.  If you've seen the show on Comedy Central or love Dave Attell, then check out this DVD as soon as you can.  I can hardly wait for a Volume 2 and I would love it if a complete season would be released on DVD.
