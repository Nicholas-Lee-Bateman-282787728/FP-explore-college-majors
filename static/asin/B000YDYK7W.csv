1119259,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000YDYK7W,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","Lake Dead (2007), directed by George Bessudo. 90 minutes.Plot:A gaggle of good-looking 20-somethings take a road trip up north to a motel which was recently inherited by about a half dozen or so sisters (none of which even remotely resemble one another) within the group. While they have fun getting stoned in their RV, listening to terrible screamo and taking their clothes off at every opportunity, some grim looking fellows set out to put a wrench in the whole thing. Or a spike. Or a hatchet. Something. I don't know. They have sex. They die. You know the score. Something something Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Something something Friday the 13th. Lather, rinse, repeat. Please pass the bottle, this is going to be a long 90 minutes.Writing and Directing:I would say this movie was poorly directed, but that would be an insult to directors in general. To his credit, George Bessudo can at least frame a scene and capture his actors and their actions clearly. Shame he can't breathe any life into the turgid, stale script. The only element that sets this time-waster apart from the average slasher/backwoods horror flick is the heavy-handed and ridiculous soap opera that plays out in the first fifteen minutes. If you sit around the house all day watching shows like ""Days Of Our Lives"" and ""The Young And The Restless"" and think ""Gee, this is great, but a couple buckets of fake blood and some gratuitous T & A would really make it sparkle!"" then this may be the flick for you.Acting:Acting is virtually non-existent. Two people named Kelsey. Someone named Tara. Who cares? At least the bad guys seemed to be trying and, subsequently, the actors portraying them look like they had a little fun with it. For the bulk of the cast, you get the sense that the producer, reeking of hair gel and Axe body-spray, just called in some friends and was all like ""Broseph, I got this film! You got to come down and be in it! You can be my lead! We got these girls who are willing to take their tops off for us!"" It's actually a bit depressing that perfectly decent looking women took their clothes off for THIS.Music:Stale, standard score. Nothing impressive. I think the producer's cousin (his name is probably Derrick, and he probably has black, spikey hair and wears short-sleeved button-up shirts all the time) and his screamo/pop-punk band provided the rest of the soundscape. I hear they almost got to play the parking lot at the Warped Tour back in 2005, but it didn't work out. Keep shooting for the stars, guys!The Bottom Line(s):This movie is terrible and virtually irredeemable. Tolerable if left on in the background while you do more important things like, say, scooping your cat's litter box or picking lint out of your bellybutton. The standard T&A; and buckets of red stuff offer a slight bit of relief, but for the most part, this one deserves to be left at the bottom of a lake. I had more fun writing this review than I did watching the movie, if that tells you anything.Lesson Learned:Don't bring a wallet with you when you go swimming.

1119262,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YDYK7W,Chris Pandolfi,"[17, 27]","If the goal of ""Lake Dead"" was to be tasteless, then mission accomplished. If its goal was to be entertaining, better luck next time. This is one of the most dreadful horror films I've ever seen--so dreadful that I'm not sure it was made with the horror genre in mind. I say this because, so far as I can tell, it's not about scaring the audience, but about being excessive, and not in a way that's campy or satirical. I saw this movie late at night, with a small but dedicated group of people who actually laughed, cheered, and applauded all throughout. I immediately knew that I was out of my league, but since it's a league I have absolutely no intention of signing up for, I guess it's okay.This film functions on a few basic levels: (1) it crams in as many slasher movie clich&eacute;s as possible; (2) it erases the fine line between scary good fun and indecency; and (3) it creates completely one-dimensional characters and uses them in a plot so contrived, predictable, and disgusting that it would work much better as a parody (but even that's pushing it). If you can imagine a cross between ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" with a little bit of ""Psycho"" thrown in, you still wouldn't come close understanding what ""Lake Dead"" is all about, simply because the first three films are much better. And since I'm no fan of ""Friday the 13th,"" that really must give you an idea of just how much I hated ""Lake Dead.""The plot: three sisters--Brielle (Kelsey Crane), Sam (Tara Gerard), and Kelli (Kelsey Wedeen)--find out that they have a long lost grandfather, who just died (under circumstances I won't reveal). His will states that they're to be given ownership of a family-run motel located in a remote wooded area. As the product of an alcoholic father, the three sisters are at odds with their family. Sam is the worst of all: a boozy, foulmouthed drug addict who wants nothing to do with anyone, least of all her father. When Brielle and her fianc&eacute;e, Ben (Jim Devoti), tell her that they plan to go up to the motel after the grandfather's funeral, they open up to the possibility of selling the property and walking away with handsome sums of money.Brielle and Ben meet with Bill (Alex A. Quinn) and his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Viola). They also meet with Kelli, and she brings along her friend Tanya (Malea Richardson). They all gather in Bill's RV and begin the journey to the motel. Almost as soon as the trip begins, Tanya and Bill begin eyeing each other, and this is bad because Bill has a reputation of cheating on his girlfriends. I guess attractive young women are too irresistible, which is interesting since every female character (with one exception) fits that description. There seems to be a rule in slasher films that at least one of these characters has to be a flirtatious nymphomaniac, and for ""Lake Dead,"" that role is assumed by Tanya, who at one point jumps at the opportunity to help Bill collect firewood for camp; to collect wood means having to leave the group, and leaving the group means a few minutes alone, etc. etc.But it isn't until the villains appear that the film really nosedives. Running the motel is an old woman named Gloria (Pat McNeely), who proves once and for all that a horror movie character with a Southern drawl is always a part of some insane, inbred family. There's a tradition, you see, of keeping the bloodline pure, and she'll do whatever it takes to ensure that this tradition stays. And then there's her son, Chuck (James C. Burnes), who, of course, is a sheriff. The brute forces of the family are twin brothers who are large, ugly, and mute--they're the ones who actually do the killing, and they usually rely on hatchets. This family begins stalking Brielle and her sisters, and these scenes pave the way for blood, gore, and a ridiculous showdown.I can't imagine why anyone would want to see this film, and I definitely can't imagine how those who do see it would find it enjoyable. ""Lake Dead"" is truly one of the worst of the worst, a shameful, unpleasant, sick, hopeless film that doesn't earn the right to go as far as it does. If it had gone in the direction of a spoof, then maybe some of the revolting excess could be overlooked. But this film plays itself seriously, and it actually expects us to treat it as such. To whoever is reading this right now: don't even consider giving this movie a chance. Do yourself a tremendous favor and forget that you've ever heard of it. It's not worth it. I think one of Kelsey Wedeen's lines says it best: ""This is bad! This is just ... awful!"" Yes.

1119263,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000YDYK7W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","What an original concept!  A family of inbred hillbillies living in the middle of nowhere who like to brutally kill people - gosh, what genius came up with this brilliant idea?  No one's ever made a movie like this before!  Folks, I don't mind telling you that I am sick and tired of this whole hillbilly family subgenre of horror.  It was bad enough when such brainless duds asWrong Turnwere tarnishing the image of horror, but Lake Dead is made even more unbearably awful by the fact that this stupid idea has now been thoroughly done to death and then some.  I do appreciate the filmmakers casting some attractive women in the film - but gee whiz, at least have the gumption of coloring a little outside the lines when making a cheap paint-by-numbers rip-off film like this one.  Even if you've never even heard of Lake Dead, believe me when I say you've already seen it - that's how unoriginal and derivative it is.Brielle Lake (Kelsey Crane) and her sisters Kelly (Kelsey Wedeen) and Sam (Tara Gerard) are surprised to learn that their grandfather has died, especially since they had been told he died many years ago.  Their nonexistent grief quickly turns into a bit of excitement when they learn that they've inherited a hotel from this granddad they never knew.  They decide to invite some friends and make a vacation out of their trip to see the old place - well, except for Sam, who sobers up long enough to drive up there by herself.  Their estranged, alcoholic father begs them not to go, but they aren't about to listen to anything he says.  If he had told them the real story of the family he ran away from, they probably wouldn't have listened, but I still think he should have mentioned the fact that his first cousins look like the Geico cavemen.  Anyway, the young folks arrive at the dump of a hotel, there's some pointless sex and nudity, and then the killing begins.  It's all utterly predictable.By and large, the acting in this film isn't quite as awful as I expected it to be.  That - and the fact that the girls aren't bad looking - is about the only good thing I can say about Lake Dead.  There must have been slim pickings indeed for this travesty to have made the cut in the 2007 After Dark Horrorfest 8 Films to Die For.

The movie is totally sick, depraved, disgusting, disturbing, incestuous, without any moral values and above all......So nicely done!! Not as shocking as the human centipede but definitely as entertaining.I think that once again, the reason for the poor reviews is probably because some of the scenes in there goes against moral values and  what is ""borderline"" acceptable for most people. As for me......i didn't really  care.....you know me........this is a horror movie.....not a comedy starring Adam Sandler..... the characters in here are just actors.....nothing more......this is NOT based on true events....and this sick family is not a real family......Three sisters just found out that their grandfather passed away and he left them a motel near a lake in his will. Definitely excited and in need for money, they decide to go up there with their friends to see what the motel looks like and what they should do with it. They will soon realise that the motel is owned by a very sick family and they already have their own plans for the motel's future and the 3 sisters future as well......... The plot is Ok, the acting is good and the cinematography is just perfect. We also have some pretty twisted killing scenes that will sometimes remind you of WRONG TURN......and that should bring a smile to any horror fan's face!!...lol5 Stars well earned for a real shocker!!, there was enough action and suspense to satisfy me and it has a lots of sexy moments...one of them i suspect was the main reason for the poor reviews but hey........thats all good......BTW, check out those AFTERDARK HORROR FEST - 8 FILMS TO DIE FOR releases, some of them are really good and worth checking out!!

1119273,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000YDYK7W,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 12]","Is it cutting too fine of a line to say that I did not like this movie but I enjoyed it for the sick, twisted, and demented film that it is?  Of all of the films in the 2007 After Dark Horrorfest collection, ""Lake Dead""(which for some reason is stuck in my head as ""Dead Lake"") is the real groaner.  But to give credit to the first time effort by director George Bessudo and writer Daniel P. Coughlin, they want you to groan when you see one of the most twisted screen kisses of all time and they want you to bang your head against the wall when the final double entendre is offered as the smoke clears and the final body count is established.  This is not a movie so bad that it is good, but a horror flick that revels in coming up with a disgusting situation, without resort to disgusting amounts of blood and gore.The film begins with a murder out at the lake, the context of which is conveniently cryptic.  The victim turns out to be the grandfather of pretty young Brielle (Kelsey Crane), who did not know that her paternal grandfather was alive until now that he is dead.  It seems grandpa has left Brielle, her sister, and their half-sister, a motel in the woods in the middle of nowhere (but near a lake).  Their estranged father warns them not to go, but the girls and their friends jump in a camper and head out to the lake, where they manage to stay alive until shortly after the film's one nude scene.  People start getting killed, things go from bad to worse, and when we find out what is really going on, then you can feel free to start groaning away.All that being said, for me at least, living in my own little universe, ""Lake Dead"" has several things going for it.  First of all, the title does a nice little bit of misdirection, because corpses might go into this particular lake, but they do not come out.  So there is no way from looking at the title of this film that you can guess the specifics of this particular horror film (the cover art says either ghost film or splatter flick, but even if you guess right things are too general).  Second of all, and more importantly, once things hit the fan the victims are not scared stupid (once again in the realm of stupid people doing everything they can to insure horrible deaths, I would point you to most of the cast of the remake of ""House of Wax,"" who truly go out of their way to ask for it and then get it).  Scared, yes, but they actually come up with some actions to help insure their survival (at least for the short term).  When you are sending the psychic message ""go, go, go"" to characters in a horror film and it actually means something different than ""run for your lives, idiots,"" then that is a good thing.  This is not to say that the characters are fleshed out as human beings, because they are not; but if you can take somebody out while tied to a chair, I am going to be impressed.Ultimately I would say that ""Lake Dead"" fits in the mold of the traditional exploitation film, because that is the cinematic niche where taking a taboo and running with it (usually into the ground) is the name of the game.  I know that ""Lake Dead"" is the consensus pick as the worst one of last year's crop of 8 films 2 die 4, but it ended up being one of the most memorable ones for me (not that that is necessarily a good thing).  It might be because once again I saw the best film first (that would be ""Borderland"" and everything has paled in comparison, but this one actually got a response from me several times.  True, those responses were ""Ewwww,"" ""Eewwwwww,"" and ""EEEWWWWW,"" but at least it got me to respond, and that becomes my justification for rounding up on this 2007 film (but I do not feel good about it, if that helps you swallow my rationale).As is the case with all but three of these octet of films all you get for bonus features on the DVD are the same Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes includes on all of them.  Yes, it was a bit much with the2006 Horrorfest filmswhen they came out on DVD and each one started off with the trailers for all of the other movies in the series, but at the very least they could have tossed the trailers for each film on the DVD.  I know ""Lake Dead"" had one and at the very least it should have been included.  Horrorfest 2007 is a notch below what we saw with the original films and that is reflected in the bonus features on the DVDs as well.",3,"Blood is thicker than water, but apparently some blood is thicker than most...",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,4366,"['cutting', 'too', 'fine', 'line', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'sick', 'twisted', 'demented', 'film', 'films', '2007', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'collection', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'reason', 'stuck', 'head', 'Dead', 'Lake', 'real', 'groaner', 'give', 'credit', 'first', 'time', 'effort', 'director', 'George', 'Bessudo', 'writer', 'Daniel', 'P.', 'Coughlin', 'want', 'groan', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'twisted', 'screen', 'kisses', 'time', 'want', 'bang', 'head', 'wall', 'when', 'final', 'double', 'entendre', 'offered', 'smoke', 'clears', 'final', 'body', 'count', 'established', 'not', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'horror', 'flick', 'coming', 'up', 'disgusting', 'situation', 'resort', 'disgusting', 'amounts', 'blood', 'gore.The', 'film', 'murder', 'out', 'lake', 'context', 'conveniently', 'cryptic', 'victim', 'out', 'be', 'grandfather', 'pretty', 'young', 'Brielle', 'Kelsey', 'Crane', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'paternal', 'grandfather', 'was', 'alive', 'now', 'dead', 'grandpa', 'left', 'Brielle', 'sister', 'half-sister', 'motel', 'woods', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'lake', 'estranged', 'father', 'not', 'go', 'girls', 'friends', 'jump', 'camper', 'head', 'lake', 'where', 'manage', 'stay', 'alive', 'shortly', 'film', 'one', 'nude', 'scene', 'People', 'start', 'getting', 'killed', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'then', 'can', 'feel', 'free', 'start', 'groaning', 'away.All', 'being', 'said', 'least', 'living', 'own', 'little', 'universe', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'First', 'all', 'title', 'nice', 'little', 'bit', 'misdirection', 'corpses', 'might', 'go', 'particular', 'lake', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'So', 'way', 'looking', 'title', 'film', 'can', 'guess', 'specifics', 'particular', 'horror', 'film', 'cover', 'art', 'ghost', 'film', 'splatter', 'flick', 'even', 'guess', 'right', 'things', 'are', 'too', 'general', 'Second', 'more', 'importantly', 'once', 'things', 'hit', 'fan', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'scared', 'stupid', 'once', 'again', 'realm', 'stupid', 'people', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'insure', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'would', 'point', 'most', 'cast', 'remake', 'House', 'Wax', 'who', 'truly', 'go', 'way', 'ask', 'then', 'get', 'Scared', 'yes', 'actually', 'come', 'up', 'actions', 'help', 'insure', 'survival', 'least', 'short', 'term', 'When', 'are', 'sending', 'psychic', 'message', 'go', 'go', 'go', 'characters', 'horror', 'film', 'actually', 'something', 'different', 'run', 'lives', 'idiots', 'then', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'say', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'not', 'can', 'take', 'somebody', 'tied', 'chair', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'impressed.Ultimately', 'would', 'say', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'mold', 'traditional', 'exploitation', 'film', 'cinematic', 'niche', 'where', 'taking', 'taboo', 'running', 'usually', 'ground', 'name', 'game', 'know', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'consensus', 'pick', 'worst', 'one', 'last', 'year', 'crop', '8', 'films', '2', 'die', '4', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'ones', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'because', 'once', 'again', 'saw', 'best', 'film', 'first', 'would', 'be', 'Borderland', 'everything', 'paled', 'comparison', 'one', 'actually', 'got', 'response', 'several', 'times', 'True', 'responses', 'were', 'Ewwww', 'Eewwwwww', 'EEEWWWWW', 'least', 'got', 'respond', 'justification', 'rounding', 'up', '2007', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'swallow', 'rationale', '.As', 'case', 'three', 'octet', 'films', 'get', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'same', 'Miss', 'Horrorfest', 'Contest', 'Yes', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'the2006', 'Horrorfest', 'filmswhen', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'one', 'started', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'very', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'tossed', 'trailers', 'film', 'DVD', 'know', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'had', 'one', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Horrorfest', '2007', 'notch', 'what', 'saw', 'original', 'films', 'reflected', 'bonus', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well']",N/A

And then I thought about it, and really, given the obvious potential for crossbreeding there, you don't really see as much of it as you should. Still, when you do see it, it should certainly be better than this.In any case, as these things go, you've got your young-and-beautifuls. In this case, they are composed of three sisters, Brielle, Kelly, and Samantha Lake (respectively, Pretty/Handsome's Kelsey Crane, Curse of the '49er's Kelsey Wedeen, and Girls Gone Psycho's Tara Gerard), and one flirtatious friend, Amy (Vanessa Viola, who seems to have been in a flick called Killer Shrimps that I absolutely must track down), as well as a couple of boyfriends (The Devil Inside's Alex Quinn and TV character actor Jim Devoti). They inherit a passel of land up north, and over the strenuous objections of the girls' father, head up to take a look around.  It becomes obvious very quickly that not all is as tranquil as it seems, as there is a serial killer at work in the area. (The big reveal comes pretty quick, but it's a spoiler, so I'll leave it be.)It's not that Lake Dead is a bad movie, per se. The acting is about par for the course in After Dark movies, the script is silly (but, again, no more so than usual), etc. It's just kind of there. Watchable, but easily forgettable afterwards. Not an awful way to kill an hour and a half, but there are so many better ways to do so. ** ",2,You've seen it all before.

That's the only explanation I can come up with after watching nearly niney minutes of rehashed material. Certainly a film can be enjoyable if pays homage to formulaic flicks, or a least gives it a twist, but this only tries to make you uncomfortable with its blatant theme of inbreeding...which only leads you to feel nasty.Two beautiful young women (apparently, they got the good inbreeding genes, while the brothers got the mutated ones) inherit a hotel near a secluded lake. Warned by their estranged (and quite drunk) father to avoid it, they pack an RV with their equally attractive friends and discover local hospitality to be lacking as they are killed in horribly bland fashion by fiends in rubber masks. There is one truly disturbing scene early in the film that gives some hope, but it soon gives way to the tedium of familar plot twists and pointless dialogue. I would add here that of all the horrorfest films, this has the worst acting, with apologies to Nightmare Man. It's porn bad at times.Of course, the villains are at times indestructable, and other times prone to a knee to the gullet. Our hero and heroines try to hide along, what else, an open road as they attempt to escape. There is also the inevitable twisted ankle scene where one of our ladies trips over her own foot while walking and requires escorts, slowing down their getaway. Unfortunately, it also prolongs the film, which drags to its predicatable conclusion with little more than a whimper.I'll admit, despite the bad reviews, I was very curious about this flick. There is a story there to be told, but not by this group of filmmakers. It's storyline is a tease, but it ultimately doesn't deliver.",2,I feel dirty for waching it,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,1829,"['Someone', 'sat', 'one', 'evening', 'assortment', 'exploitation/slasher', 'flicks', 'pen', 'paper', 'put', 'together', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'watched', 'only', 'explanation', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'watching', 'nearly', 'niney', 'minutes', 'rehashed', 'material', 'Certainly', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'pays', 'homage', 'formulaic', 'flicks', 'least', 'twist', 'only', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'blatant', 'theme', 'inbreeding', 'only', 'feel', 'nasty.Two', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'apparently', 'got', 'good', 'inbreeding', 'genes', 'brothers', 'got', 'mutated', 'ones', 'inherit', 'hotel', 'secluded', 'lake', 'Warned', 'estranged', 'quite', 'drunk', 'father', 'avoid', 'pack', 'RV', 'equally', 'attractive', 'friends', 'discover', 'local', 'hospitality', 'be', 'lacking', 'are', 'killed', 'horribly', 'bland', 'fashion', 'fiends', 'rubber', 'masks', 'one', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'hope', 'soon', 'way', 'tedium', 'familar', 'plot', 'twists', 'pointless', 'dialogue', 'would', 'add', 'here', 'horrorfest', 'films', 'worst', 'acting', 'apologies', 'Nightmare', 'Man', 'porn', 'bad', 'times.Of', 'course', 'villains', 'are', 'times', 'indestructable', 'other', 'times', 'prone', 'knee', 'gullet', 'hero', 'heroines', 'try', 'hide', 'along', 'what', 'else', 'open', 'road', 'attempt', 'escape', 'also', 'inevitable', 'twisted', 'ankle', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'ladies', 'own', 'foot', 'walking', 'escorts', 'slowing', 'down', 'getaway', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'film', 'predicatable', 'conclusion', 'little', 'more', 'whimper.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'flick', 'story', 'there', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'group', 'filmmakers', 'storyline', 'tease', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'deliver']",N/A
