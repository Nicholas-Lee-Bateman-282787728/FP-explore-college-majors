874993,A1HOVGEE981HS0,B0006VXMNA,"A. Bennett ""Will 'vouge' For Food""","[7, 10]","I am a huge fan of Pammy Lee/Anderson/Whatever in all her forms.  Model, actress, and American Icon.  And I feel that ""Stripperella"" is her greatest gift to the world!  Pam is a cartoon so it makes it a no brainer that she teamed up with Stan Lee to create what is one of campiest most fabulous cartoon series ever.  I truly believe that Pammy had her gay fans in mind when she dreamed up this one...then snuck ""Stripperella"" on SPIKE TV (sneaky sneaky)!In all seriousness Pam gives her best performances on this show.  She plays the stripper/superhero part perfectly.  And her stance on animal rights is well acted and comes off as sincere.  The supporting cast of characters are all hilarious and well voiced.  The stories are all well crafted and the villians are dynamite.My one problem with the series is the sudden (and rather dramatic) production switch.  The characters and setting were all redesigned with some characters barely resembling their pre-reproduced counterparts.  The initial art style was done a la Bruce Timm Batman and swicthed to a more contemporary style mid season.But that's not enough to detract from a great series that deserves to be added to every DVD collection (gay or straight) out there.",4,Super Duper Stripperella,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1223,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Pammy', 'Lee/Anderson/Whatever', 'forms', 'Model', 'actress', 'American', 'Icon', 'feel', 'Stripperella', 'greatest', 'gift', 'world', 'Pam', 'cartoon', 'brainer', 'teamed', 'up', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'create', 'what', 'one', 'campiest', 'most', 'fabulous', 'cartoon', 'series', 'ever', 'truly', 'believe', 'Pammy', 'had', 'gay', 'fans', 'mind', 'when', 'dreamed', 'up', 'one', 'then', 'snuck', 'Stripperella', 'SPIKE', 'TV', 'sneaky', 'sneaky', 'seriousness', 'Pam', 'best', 'performances', 'show', 'stripper/superhero', 'part', 'perfectly', 'stance', 'animal', 'rights', 'well', 'acted', 'off', 'sincere', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'hilarious', 'well', 'voiced', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'villians', 'are', 'dynamite.My', 'one', 'problem', 'series', 'sudden', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'production', 'switch', 'characters', 'setting', 'were', 'redesigned', 'characters', 'barely', 'resembling', 'pre-reproduced', 'counterparts', 'initial', 'art', 'style', 'was', 'done', 'la', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'Batman', 'swicthed', 'more', 'contemporary', 'style', 'mid', 'season.But', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'great', 'series', 'be', 'added', 'DVD', 'collection', 'gay', 'straight', 'there']",N/A

This season one show from Spike TV's beginnings was an experiment which failed-it only lasted one season! This one joke wonder is a curse to all SUPERHEROES-STAN HOW COULD YOU?However Lee and Anderson poked fun at Anderson's image and so called rep of playing dumb blonde characters with hearts of gold. Stripperella was no different, Stripper by night/Superhero by night was the cute tag line for the show.For an adult sexual comedy, it was cute. It has bad jokes blended with bad innuendos...it satire that talked down to even  adults. It was a 13 year old type jokes in an R rated cartoon. In my opinion that why the cartoon block that Spike TV started with failed badly> They  tried Playboy humor in prime time and failedIs it worth the price?

I knew it was going to be cheesy just from the fact that the lead character is a stripper who fights crime. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did, but at the same time the show really didn't live up to the amount of expectation that I had for it.The show sets off to be a parody of the super-hero genre & it's characters, but falls short of that goal at times. I think that's partially why it only lasted about 13 episodes- it never seemed to actually go beyond the initial blue humor of the series. While that was fun at first, the writers just never seemed to do anything that could really flesh out the characters. (I refuse to believe that the skanky IRL ""Stripperella"" had anything to do with the cancellation.) I mean, there's only so many times you can reuse the same jokes about sex, strippers & such.Even so, the promise in this show really shines through & makes you as ""what if..."".

The show turned out to be better than what I expected and less sleazy, with some gratuitous topless stuff at the strip club and rampant bathroom humor throughout the series.  It's primarily a superhero/spy spoof, sort of in the style of Austin Powers.  Stan Lee developed the show and one of the directors is Kevin Altieri, who worked on Batman: The Animated Series, so there's automatically a certain level of quality brought to the show.  The animation and designs are very well done, on par with Batman.  The artists also do a great job caricaturing many different types of people.  Stripperella herself comes across as a dorky likeable character and is well-acted by Pamela Anderson.  The villains are over-the-top parodies of megalomaniacs you see over and over in comic books and James Bond movies.  Many characters are funny, like the strip club employees, the siamese twins, and especially the spy agency scientists.  The spy chief is whacked out.  There is also quite a bit of subtle social satire throughout the show.  I did feel that a few of the episodes try a little too hard to be funny and cheesy.  But episodes like ""Beauty and the Obese"" and ""The Bridesmaid"" are pretty good.  It's interesting that the visual design for the series changes about halfway through the season.  Overall, I felt that Stripperella's new design (the one you see on the DVD cover) has a bit more character than the original design, although the original one is also quite cool.
