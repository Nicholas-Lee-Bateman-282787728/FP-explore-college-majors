The action is static. But worst, much of the acting is not believable. Worst here is the son &quot;Tony&quot; (portrayed by Ellis Rabb), who comes across as a dime store Kevin Kline. Rosemary Harris, portraying Julie Cavendish, is the only particularly likeable character in this drama.I am afraid this show is a yawner......",2,A disappointment.....,1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,439,"['am', 'afraid', 'play', 'not', 'great', 'interest', 'plot', 'rather', 'bland', 'nothing', 'much', 'quot', 'quot', 'here', 'action', 'static', 'worst', 'much', 'acting', 'not', 'believable', 'Worst', 'here', 'son', 'quot', 'Tony', 'quot', 'portrayed', 'Ellis', 'Rabb', 'who', 'across', 'dime', 'store', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'portraying', 'Julie', 'Cavendish', 'only', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'character', 'drama.I', 'am', 'show', 'yawner']",N/A

Kaufman and Edna Ferber hit play, about a theatrical clan towering over Broadway from their Manhatten penthouse, is still a comedic gem, with knock-out performances from Rosemary Harris, as Broadway's leading lady who regards every doorway as a grand entrance, Ellis Rabb, who also co-directed, as her John Barrymore-ish brother, a tempermental actor who remains just this side of frantic measures, and Keene Curtis, a leading man past his prime, grasping at roles with shoe polish adorning his graying hair. The biting 1920's theatrical sarcasm is still very funny, and serves as historical document of what was relevant at a time when emerging radio, silent movies, and sensational staged productions were Broadways's only competition. The foreign collection of exotic people and animals accompanying brother Tony, (Rabb), on his return trip from Europe, gives the production an authentic 1920's global glitz. I would have preferred to see this play filmed before a live audience, which would have comforted the sometimes hollowness of a filmed staged play, but ""The Royal Family"", is a real treat for lovers of theatre, and historical Broadway.",4,DE-LIGHTFUL,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1192,"['staged', 'production', '1927', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'hit', 'play', 'theatrical', 'clan', 'towering', 'over', 'Broadway', 'Manhatten', 'penthouse', 'still', 'comedic', 'gem', 'knock-out', 'performances', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Broadway', 'leading', 'lady', 'who', 'doorway', 'grand', 'entrance', 'Ellis', 'Rabb', 'who', 'also', 'co-directed', 'John', 'Barrymore-ish', 'brother', 'tempermental', 'actor', 'who', 'just', 'side', 'frantic', 'measures', 'Keene', 'Curtis', 'leading', 'man', 'prime', 'grasping', 'roles', 'shoe', 'polish', 'adorning', 'graying', 'hair', 'biting', '1920', 'theatrical', 'sarcasm', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'as', 'historical', 'document', 'what', 'was', 'relevant', 'time', 'when', 'emerging', 'radio', 'silent', 'movies', 'sensational', 'staged', 'productions', 'were', 'Broadways', 'only', 'competition', 'foreign', 'collection', 'exotic', 'people', 'animals', 'accompanying', 'brother', 'Tony', 'Rabb', 'return', 'trip', 'Europe', 'production', 'authentic', '1920', 'global', 'glitz', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'play', 'filmed', 'live', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'comforted', 'sometimes', 'hollowness', 'filmed', 'staged', 'play', 'Royal', 'Family', 'real', 'treat', 'lovers', 'theatre', 'historical', 'Broadway']",N/A
573754,A5PGGHYHIDYA5,B000059PEX,Kenton Couch,"[2, 2]","It was privilege to watch this outstanding performance of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's play. The quality of this production is a credit to theater. Every actor seemed to relish working together to bring to life the wacky, wonderful, and totally endearing, Cavendish family.One cannot help but be irresistibly drawn into the story by the warmth, wit, and humanity of its vibrant characters. I have to say it: Today's plays don't hold a candle to this production.  Everyone should see ""The Royal Family"" so they can know what great theater is and should be.I purchased this DVD after reading reviews extolling Rosemary Harris' acting in the play. I now understand why she is held in such high regard. Every aspect of her performance was a tour de force lesson in acting:  pace, energy, inner monologue, movement, timing, character development, ensemble work - all perfection. I can only compare her work with that of the marvelous Geraldine Page, and that is high praise indeed.  I wanted to learn more about Ms. Harris and was pleased to discover she is still doing fine work. She recently played the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt, in the Spiderman movies.I also discovered her first movie was ""Beau Brummell"" with Stuart Granger and Elizabeth Taylor. The movie is now only available as a used VHS. I remember it as a fine production although I didn't remember Ms. Harris in it. I bought a used copy just to see Ms. Harris' first film performance. I hope ""Beau Brummell"" will be released on DVD. It deserves to be saved as does this marvelous play.I can only imagine the quality she brought to the many stage productions she performed in. I wish there were film versions of her performances in such works as ""The Lion in Winter"" and her Shakespearean plays. That would be a golden gift to theater.I don't want, in lauding Ms. Harris' remarkable work, in any way to dminish the fine performaces of the other cast members. Everyone in the play deserves accolades for their superior acting.Director Ellis Rabb, who also played the role of Tony in the play, is marvelous. His superb character development brings to life every subtle aspect of his rich role. His work in this play showes an outstanding actor who has complete mastery of his art.Mr. Rabb's directorial work was also a joy to watch. I don't know of anyone who could have done a better job in bringing this wonderful play to life.I was glad to learn Mr. Rabb also directed my favorite version of ""You Can't Take It With You."" The 1984 production starring Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst has the same grace, beauty, and clarity of purpose as ""The Royal Family."" This production was also filmed, and there are some VHS copies floating around. If you find one, buy it, so you can see another sterling theatrical production by Mr. Rabb. I hope someone will also save this fine play and release it on DVD.Of course, one cannot comment on this play without paying tribute to Eva Le Gallienne's portrayal of Fanny Cavendish. One of the great actresses of American theater, she presented her character with beauty, depth, and honesty. It was an honor to see her perform.Lastly, I want to pay homage to Sam Levene, who played Oscar Wolfe, the theatrical agent for the Cavendishes. It was such a pleasure to see him on stage and doing the fine work he brought to so many movies. There is a lovely French scene between Ms. Harris and Mr. Levene where they are discussing how to handle telling Fanny Cavendish she can't go on the road again - what poignant moment of acting.The Broadway Theatre Archive is to be commended for its excellent restoration  work. Thank you for the care and attention you gave to a true work of art. I hope you will consider restoring and releasing Rabb's ""You Can't Take It With You."" It so deserves to be part of our theater heritage.Don't miss this fine play. It is all that good theater and entertainment should be.  As a former theater teacher, it holds a special place in my heart, and, I'm sure, it will find a special place in your heart too.",5,Marvelous Theater - A Privilege to Watch,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,4037,"['was', 'privilege', 'watch', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'play', 'quality', 'production', 'credit', 'theater', 'actor', 'seemed', 'relish', 'working', 'together', 'bring', 'life', 'wacky', 'wonderful', 'totally', 'endearing', 'Cavendish', 'family.One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'irresistibly', 'drawn', 'story', 'warmth', 'wit', 'humanity', 'vibrant', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'Today', 'plays', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'production', 'Everyone', 'should', 'see', 'Royal', 'Family', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'great', 'theater', 'should', 'be.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'reading', 'reviews', 'extolling', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'acting', 'play', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'held', 'such', 'high', 'regard', 'aspect', 'performance', 'was', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'lesson', 'acting', 'pace', 'energy', 'inner', 'monologue', 'movement', 'timing', 'character', 'development', 'ensemble', 'work', 'perfection', 'can', 'only', 'compare', 'work', 'marvelous', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'still', 'doing', 'fine', 'work', 'recently', 'played', 'role', 'May', 'Parker', 'Peter', 'aunt', 'Spiderman', 'movies.I', 'also', 'discovered', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'Beau', 'Brummell', 'Stuart', 'Granger', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'movie', 'now', 'only', 'available', 'used', 'VHS', 'remember', 'fine', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'bought', 'used', 'copy', 'just', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'first', 'film', 'performance', 'hope', 'Beau', 'Brummell', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'be', 'saved', 'marvelous', 'play.I', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'quality', 'brought', 'many', 'stage', 'productions', 'performed', 'wish', 'were', 'film', 'versions', 'performances', 'such', 'works', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'Shakespearean', 'plays', 'would', 'be', 'golden', 'gift', 'theater.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'lauding', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'remarkable', 'work', 'way', 'dminish', 'fine', 'performaces', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Everyone', 'play', 'accolades', 'superior', 'acting.Director', 'Ellis', 'Rabb', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'role', 'Tony', 'play', 'marvelous', 'superb', 'character', 'development', 'life', 'subtle', 'aspect', 'rich', 'role', 'work', 'play', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'who', 'complete', 'mastery', 'art.Mr', 'Rabb', 'directorial', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'joy', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'bringing', 'wonderful', 'play', 'life.I', 'was', 'glad', 'learn', 'Mr.', 'Rabb', 'also', 'directed', 'favorite', 'version', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', '1984', 'production', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'same', 'grace', 'beauty', 'clarity', 'purpose', 'Royal', 'Family', 'production', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'are', 'VHS', 'copies', 'floating', 'around', 'find', 'one', 'buy', 'can', 'see', 'sterling', 'theatrical', 'production', 'Mr.', 'Rabb', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'also', 'save', 'fine', 'play', 'release', 'DVD.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'play', 'paying', 'tribute', 'Eva', 'Le', 'Gallienne', 'portrayal', 'Fanny', 'Cavendish', 'One', 'great', 'actresses', 'American', 'theater', 'presented', 'character', 'beauty', 'depth', 'honesty', 'was', 'honor', 'see', 'perform.Lastly', 'want', 'pay', 'homage', 'Sam', 'Levene', 'who', 'played', 'Oscar', 'Wolfe', 'theatrical', 'agent', 'Cavendishes', 'was', 'such', 'pleasure', 'see', 'stage', 'doing', 'fine', 'work', 'brought', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'lovely', 'French', 'scene', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'Mr.', 'Levene', 'where', 'are', 'discussing', 'how', 'handle', 'telling', 'Fanny', 'Cavendish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'road', 'again', 'what', 'poignant', 'moment', 'acting.The', 'Broadway', 'Theatre', 'Archive', 'be', 'commended', 'excellent', 'restoration', 'work', 'Thank', 'care', 'attention', 'gave', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'hope', 'will', 'consider', 'restoring', 'releasing', 'Rabb', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'so', 'be', 'part', 'theater', 'heritage.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'fine', 'play', 'good', 'theater', 'entertainment', 'should', 'be', 'former', 'theater', 'teacher', 'special', 'place', 'heart', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'find', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'too']",N/A

After watching her act as Julie Cavendish in the Royal Family, I have to admit that she is one of England's finest actresses. I like seeing her with Eva La Gallienne and Mary Louise Wilson. I didn't care for the daughter. The play itself is outdated but the cast is worth watching. In researching Eva La Gallienne, I couldn't believe such an actress existed to create and work in the theater for love. Eva's performance is a reminder of such a great American dame of the theater not to be forgotten. I have read the biographies of this woman's life, difficult and passionate.

Lovingly filmed for PBS's Great Performances series, every character gets a major entrance and exit.  Eva LeGallienne, who had some claim to &#34;First Lady of the American Stage,&#34; is steely knowledgeable in her last performance as the family matriarch.  Rosemary Harris hit another high point in her career as Julie, and Ellis Rabb not only directed the show but scores as Tony, the flamboyant parody of John Barrymore.  Sam Levene is the definitive Oscar, their long-suffering agent, and Keene Curtis and Mary Louise Wilson are hysterical as the less-succesful members of the family.  Keep your eyes peeled for a very young Ben Stiller in a non-speaking walk-on as a bellboy.

The cast is amazing, and the direction is superb.  The talents of Rosemary Harris and Keene Curtis and all the rest are unparalleled.  There are too few chances to enjoy these mostly stage actors.  But most satisfying is the rare opportunity to watch the magnificent Eva LaGallienne in action.  She was one of the all time greatest performers on the American stage.  She started in the '20s as an ingenue -- playing on her youth and good looks while learning her craft to perfection.  Later she became a producer, built theaters, and took on other roles traditionally closed to women of the time.  Here she was already in her mid-70s, but her talent is unmistakeable.  She remained active until her death at 93. (Look her up on the Internet if you don't believe me.)Few televised plays have ever been this successful.  It is classic comedy in its truest sense.
