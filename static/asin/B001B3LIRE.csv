At first I disliked the weak main character, but then I got used to him. The characters and story could be referred to many of us. Like the father deer that can be referred to irresponsible fathers, step father that adopted another being as his son,etc. While I didn't love the movie I did have one favorite character and the story was interesting. The story didn't get me bored and while there are many bad reviews, I do believe it deserves a better rating. Because they are simply silly. But I won't go into depth about anything but the movie. Maybe most of the plot could be too childish and full of fantasy, but those who dream, achieve wondrous things. It was silly from me to hesitate to watch it.

The wolfes could be a little scary for children and the storyline a little too modern for some adults but all in all I think you will enjoy it.

1170365,A1YHG9E4GZ8UXK,B001B3LIRE,Jeffery P. Babineau,"[3, 7]","The opening scenes of this 2008 film left me feeling awkward watching with a 6 year old. The hero teen deer has been told his father is a member of Santa's reindeer. His mom had met the buck while he was repairing in the sleigh and he took her for a ride on the sleigh and the fawn was born the next spring and the buck was never heard from again. so not even a one night stand. Just a ride in the sleigh and she's having a baby and the father claims NO responsibility. Later a lead character is introduced, a fox that wants to be a singer, so she runs away from home and hangs out in a reindeer bar singing for Santa's reindeer while they consume massive amounts of ""barley juice"" after training. When the fawn confronts the reindeer to find out who his father might be, he asks, ""have any of you taken a doe out for a sleigh ride on Christmas eve?"" To which they ALL respond ""hahaha, of coarse we all have, it's what we do."" None of the reindeer own up that they might be the kids father. Another one of the main characters is a pink female shaved poodle. Her butt is not a dogs butt, but the butt of a typical bikini model with no bikini and a tail. How we doing on this concept of a kids movie? Yes, the little 6 year old was laughing quite a bit. The final moral of the story? It doesn't matter who your mom had sex with to give you life and ran off to never be seen again, what matters is who happens to be nearest and most kind to you.

1170366,AIX5U6987QITP,B001B3LIRE,Joe,"[2, 3]","I first saw this as a 45 minute special on CBS a few weeks ago.  It looked pretty good from the previews, so I had to check it out.  While I thought the story was pretty good, I thought it left a lot of loose ends and unfinished plot.  So imagine my surprise when I did a web search on it, and found out this was actually an 80 minute movie made in Finland!  So I immediately sent for the DVD, which features the full length movie, and I have to say it was much better than the 45 minute ""condensed for TV"" version.  All of my questions were answered and all of the loose ends were tied up.  I honestly don't know what CBS was thinking, making a 45 minute special out of an 80 minute movie (essentially, cutting out half of the movie!)  All of Niko's quest to find his father, and all of the dangers he encounters along the way, make the story so much more epic!  Also, one reviewer pointed out that in the TV special version, the poodle character, Essie, simply vanishes once her part is complete - well, in the full length movie, you do get to find out what happens to her (nothing bad, by the way).  I thought it was a very enjoyable story, and it's become my favorite Christmas movie this year.  Santa's Flying Forces are a riot, as well!  And I really liked the main message of the story, that if you believe in yourself, you really can accomplish your dreams.  Another good message was that your heroes often just turn out to be ordinary people like you and me, so don't put them up on a pedastal.  I know a lot of reviewers don't like the ""one night stand"" aspect of the story, but it's not really dwelt upon to any extent.  Overall, I think this is a really great and exciting Christmas story, which I am sure I'll be watching every Christmas from now on.The sequel movie, ""Little Brother, Big Trouble"" is also available on DVD, but I was only able to find it through Wal*mart.  Amazon does have it as a download, though.
