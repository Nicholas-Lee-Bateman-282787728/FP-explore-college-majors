It was preceded by a 1926 silent version and followed by 1974, 2000 and 2013 versions.  All versions differ from each other and are worth seeing, but are based on the same structure including a two men, one woman love triangle, a hit-and-run car accident killing the mistress of one of the men with disputes over who was driving and a murder of the other man with links to the car accident and disputes over the choice of the killer's target.  For more details on these matters, please see my review of The Great Gatsby 1974, and then consider my comparisons of the 1949 and 1974 versions that appear below as sufficient information to guide someone trying to decide whether to buy the 1949 version or not,Black & White versus color differences give the 1949 version more dramatic impact and less beauty than the 1974 version.  The plot is more explicitly stated and complete in the 1949 version, favoring viewers who want to know what is going on at all times.  The plot has more omissions, key information stated in a whisper or delayed revelations in the 1974 version, favoring those who want to be mystified for a time, with revelations falling together late.  The 1949 acting reveals people more like they probably were in the 1920s, with the loud staccato male voices and with rottenness selectively revealed as characteristics of individuals.  The 1974 acting reveals smoother, less forceful behavior patterns in men living farther the 1920s and rottenness distributed widely as an almost universal characteristic.",5,"Elliot Nugent Directs Alan Ladd, Betty Field, Barry Sullivan and Shelly Winters in 1949 Black & White Gem",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1619,"['movie', 'adapted', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'published', '1925', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'was', 'preceded', '1926', 'silent', 'version', 'followed', '1974', '2000', '2013', 'versions', 'versions', 'differ', 'other', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'based', 'same', 'structure', 'including', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'woman', 'love', 'triangle', 'hit-and-run', 'car', 'accident', 'killing', 'mistress', 'one', 'men', 'disputes', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'murder', 'other', 'man', 'links', 'car', 'accident', 'choice', 'killer', 'target', 'more', 'details', 'matters', 'please', 'see', 'review', 'Great', 'Gatsby', '1974', 'then', 'consider', 'comparisons', '1949', '1974', 'versions', 'appear', 'sufficient', 'information', 'guide', 'someone', 'trying', 'decide', 'buy', '1949', 'version', 'not', 'Black', 'White', 'versus', 'color', 'differences', 'give', '1949', 'version', 'more', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'less', 'beauty', '1974', 'version', 'plot', 'more', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'complete', '1949', 'version', 'favoring', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'times', 'plot', 'more', 'omissions', 'key', 'information', 'stated', 'whisper', 'delayed', 'revelations', '1974', 'version', 'favoring', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'mystified', 'time', 'revelations', 'falling', 'together', 'late', '1949', 'acting', 'reveals', 'people', 'more', 'probably', 'were', '1920s', 'loud', 'staccato', 'male', 'voices', 'rottenness', 'selectively', 'revealed', 'characteristics', 'individuals', '1974', 'acting', 'reveals', 'smoother', 'less', 'forceful', 'behavior', 'patterns', 'men', 'living', 'farther', '1920s', 'rottenness', 'distributed', 'widely', 'almost', 'universal', 'characteristic']",N/A

Ladd, though polished in his carriage, does gangster-like stuff himself, like knocking out the guy from his past, Reba, who crashes his party and calls Gatsby ""Gatz"" (his real name from his poverty-stricken Dakotas past) in front of his guests and friends.So I have no idea why this film has such a low rating.
