Several instances in which the moderator speaks German, songs are cut off too quickly, some good sound and picture quality, but mostly very mediocre sound and picture quality. Less than 50 minutes long (even though box shows it at over 80 min. long). I'm glad I got it, but not sure if I could recommend it. The Dr. Hook piece was the worst, but most other were worth seeing if you're a fan. A CD that I think only  the 60's and early 70's generation can appreciate.",3,Have a Pretty Nice Day,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,570,"['great', 'see', 'bands', 'original', 'members', 'CD', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'Several', 'instances', 'moderator', 'speaks', 'German', 'songs', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'too', 'quickly', 'good', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'mostly', 'very', 'mediocre', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'Less', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'even', 'box', '80', 'min', 'long', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'recommend', 'Dr.', 'Hook', 'piece', 'was', 'worst', 'most', 'other', 'were', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'CD', 'think', 'only', '60', 'early', '70', 'generation', 'can', 'appreciate']",N/A

What a great idea and what a great start with this release.  Rhino has collected some great video footage of some of the top acts of the late 1960's and the 1970's.  Much of the footage comes from artists' performances at the German Musicladen locale.  The lighting varies a bit from excellent for America to poor for BTO where Randy Bachman looks like a creature from a horror movie.  The sound however, is consistantly good throughout.  This is an excellent addition to a musical DVD collection.  It presents material that is not likely to be available elsewhere.
