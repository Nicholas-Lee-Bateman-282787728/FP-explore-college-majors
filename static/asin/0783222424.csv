49525,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,0783222424,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[1, 1]","""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" is based on Neal Cassady's letters to Jack Kerouac trying to explain his life in Denver before he fell in with Kerouac and the rest of the beat generation players. The movie is based on the famous ""Cherry Mary"" letter to Kerouac in which Kerouac says he found the voice of ""On The Road"" in Cassady's writing.The film takes place when Cassady is 19 years old he works nights in a tire factory and Cassady wants better things for himself in life, he'd been in reform school for a series of car stealing, joy riding actually and he has a weakness for pretty women. Cassady does  wants to conform to societal norms, he wants a wife and family with the white picket fence, like it's will contain his every and need, but Cassady's wanderlust for what's around the next bend or the next chick will finally satisfy him. The suicide described in the title isn't a literal one but a figurative one that Cassady kept inflicting on himself when he was close to getting what he said he wanted.Thomas Jane catches the conman aspect of Cassady's personality, and resembles the Cassady, even though he looks about 10 years too old to be playing a 19 year old Cassady. Keanu Reeves plays Harry, a pool playing pal of Cassady's who plays the devils advocate to the better angels of Cassady's intentions.Director Stephen Kay tries to mimic Cassady's frenetic cadences of his letters through editing in parts of the film.There are no special features. A little documentary about Kerouac and Cassady might have made the film a little more accessible to those who aren't familiar with their relationship. The film could stand for that information to be contained some where knowing about Kerouac and Cassady would fill in information for the viewer, without it the uninitatiated may find themselves a little lost in the plot.",4,Neal Cassady Explains Himself,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1839,"['Last', 'Time', 'Committed', 'Suicide', 'based', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'letters', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'trying', 'explain', 'life', 'Denver', 'fell', 'Kerouac', 'rest', 'beat', 'generation', 'players', 'movie', 'based', 'famous', 'Cherry', 'Mary', 'letter', 'Kerouac', 'Kerouac', 'found', 'voice', 'Road', 'Cassady', 'writing.The', 'film', 'place', 'when', 'Cassady', '19', 'years', 'old', 'nights', 'tire', 'factory', 'Cassady', 'better', 'things', 'life', ""'d"", 'been', 'reform', 'school', 'series', 'car', 'stealing', 'joy', 'riding', 'actually', 'weakness', 'pretty', 'women', 'Cassady', 'conform', 'societal', 'norms', 'wife', 'family', 'white', 'picket', 'fence', 'will', 'contain', 'need', 'Cassady', 'wanderlust', 'what', 'next', 'bend', 'next', 'chick', 'will', 'finally', 'satisfy', 'suicide', 'described', 'title', ""n't"", 'literal', 'one', 'figurative', 'one', 'Cassady', 'kept', 'inflicting', 'when', 'was', 'close', 'getting', 'what', 'said', 'wanted.Thomas', 'Jane', 'conman', 'aspect', 'Cassady', 'personality', 'Cassady', 'even', '10', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Cassady', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Harry', 'pool', 'playing', 'pal', 'Cassady', 'who', 'devils', 'advocate', 'better', 'angels', 'Cassady', 'intentions.Director', 'Stephen', 'Kay', 'mimic', 'Cassady', 'frenetic', 'cadences', 'letters', 'editing', 'parts', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'little', 'documentary', 'Kerouac', 'Cassady', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'accessible', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'relationship', 'film', 'could', 'stand', 'information', 'be', 'contained', 'where', 'knowing', 'Kerouac', 'Cassady', 'would', 'fill', 'information', 'viewer', 'uninitatiated', 'may', 'find', 'little', 'lost', 'plot']",Last Time I Commited Suicide VHS
49526,A3I7B5OA1TYCCB,0783222424,Lesley Z,"[1, 1]","The cinematography is intentionally choppy, skewed and angular. It slowly lets you enter the doorway to the world of Cassady.However,just when you think you may be sinking into the mire of his life, you are yanked out and thrown haphazard against a wall of antic jazz.Back then, men had no desire to come in touch with their feminine side. They would have said ""WTF are you talking about? "" Men remained detached and bonded over beer and pool. Not so difference from today? There was a feeling of freedom and utter carelessnes for those few who chose not to enter the conventional roles. After all, the war was over and the future promised and held anything we yearned for. Summers were long, pleasures were simple...get high, ride the roads in a cool, hopped-up convertable, or hot-rod, if you were lucky. If everything really came up trumps, that back seat saw some major action!There is no way to get inside a man who lived for the moment, chased etherial dreams and earthly pleasures. Some lives you can nail down, twist the ends so the pinion can not be removed, and only then you can define the meaning of it all. Others, like Cassidy's, turn into mist and fly away. So what are we trying to glean from this study of a misanthrope? Cassady took that one part of us that analyses everything, desires everything, and figures there must be a way to make it all happen, and forged something akin to a life. Most of us just drag this part of our psyche out once in while, and when we are done musing, tuck it back away in some safe, dark place to hibernate til the mood hits us one day when we are lonely, weak or depressed.Back then rules were rules, not just guidelines. Guilt shadowed us everywhere like a demon on our heels. If you fell in love,got pregnant etc. marriage was the next step. No one questioned that. It was the dream for which men and women had fought and died. Who would question that? Cassidy did! All of us did a little, though we might not have said so around the Sunday dinner table. We needed to fit in, to assimilate into the culture of the time.Here comes Cassady....he followed the less taken path. True, he felt all the basics... lust, passion, hunger for it all. Some people say men never get older than 12. Maybe that is true. For Cassady 12 seemed to be a great age to be....full of the mysteries of being! He grabbed onto moments like a drowning man grapples for a rope. Each moment was a patch on an unfinished quilt. The overall effect of said quilt is exquisite when you stand back and view the whole. It is only when you zoom in on each individual scrap can you see the the tears, sweat, and the blood from needle-pricked fingers. Cassady, a life lived only in retrospect.Thomas Jane captures the vibrant, sometimes exhilerating, spirit that was Neal Cassady, in this homage to a troubled soul. Taken from letters written by Cassady, a smoky, untethered glimpse into what we may only surmise is a tortured attempt to define a man, this movie doesn't answer any questions, but then again, it never intended to! It lets us be a fly on the wall. For those of us who go back that far, the characters in this movie remind us of people we once knew, hung out with at the corner gas staion, and with whom we rode ""chicken"""" races along country highways etc. For the younger viewer, unless you are a 40's/50's buff, it may not hold much for you. You need to have lived in a less complicated time to understand how such unequivicable simplicity of life illicits such passion, such pain, such agony of living.What was Cassady doing? He was chasing a dream only he hoped to understand! Wanna come along for the ride? Be aware there are bumps and detours and dead ends along the way!P.S. fine supporting role for Keanu...clean, precision acting in his lesser role!",4,"Cassady, a life lived only in retrospect.",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,3790,"['cinematography', 'intentionally', 'choppy', 'skewed', 'angular', 'slowly', 'enter', 'doorway', 'world', 'Cassady.However', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'sinking', 'mire', 'life', 'are', 'yanked', 'thrown', 'haphazard', 'wall', 'antic', 'jazz.Back', 'then', 'men', 'had', 'desire', 'come', 'touch', 'feminine', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'WTF', 'are', 'talking', 'Men', 'remained', 'detached', 'bonded', 'beer', 'pool', 'Not', 'so', 'difference', 'today', 'was', 'feeling', 'freedom', 'utter', 'carelessnes', 'few', 'who', 'chose', 'not', 'enter', 'conventional', 'roles', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'future', 'promised', 'held', 'anything', 'yearned', 'Summers', 'were', 'long', 'pleasures', 'were', 'simple', 'get', 'high', 'ride', 'roads', 'cool', 'hopped-up', 'convertable', 'hot-rod', 'were', 'lucky', 'everything', 'really', 'came', 'up', 'trumps', 'back', 'seat', 'saw', 'major', 'action', 'way', 'get', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'moment', 'chased', 'etherial', 'dreams', 'earthly', 'pleasures', 'lives', 'can', 'nail', 'down', 'twist', 'ends', 'pinion', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'removed', 'only', 'then', 'can', 'define', 'meaning', 'Others', 'Cassidy', 'turn', 'mist', 'fly', 'away', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'glean', 'study', 'misanthrope', 'Cassady', 'took', 'one', 'part', 'everything', 'everything', 'figures', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'make', 'happen', 'forged', 'something', 'akin', 'life', 'Most', 'just', 'drag', 'part', 'psyche', 'out', 'once', 'while', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'musing', 'tuck', 'back', 'away', 'safe', 'dark', 'place', 'hibernate', 'mood', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'are', 'lonely', 'weak', 'depressed.Back', 'then', 'rules', 'were', 'rules', 'not', 'just', 'guidelines', 'Guilt', 'shadowed', 'everywhere', 'demon', 'heels', 'fell', 'love', 'got', 'pregnant', 'etc', 'marriage', 'was', 'next', 'step', 'one', 'questioned', 'was', 'dream', 'men', 'women', 'had', 'fought', 'died', 'Who', 'would', 'question', 'Cassidy', 'did', 'did', 'little', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'said', 'so', 'Sunday', 'dinner', 'table', 'needed', 'fit', 'assimilate', 'culture', 'time.Here', 'Cassady', '.he', 'followed', 'less', 'taken', 'path', 'True', 'felt', 'basics', 'lust', 'passion', 'hunger', 'people', 'say', 'men', 'never', 'get', 'older', '12', 'Maybe', 'true', 'Cassady', '12', 'seemed', 'be', 'great', 'age', 'be', '.full', 'mysteries', 'being', 'grabbed', 'moments', 'drowning', 'man', 'grapples', 'rope', 'moment', 'was', 'patch', 'unfinished', 'quilt', 'overall', 'effect', 'said', 'quilt', 'exquisite', 'when', 'stand', 'back', 'view', 'whole', 'only', 'when', 'zoom', 'individual', 'scrap', 'can', 'see', 'tears', 'sweat', 'blood', 'needle-pricked', 'fingers', 'Cassady', 'life', 'lived', 'only', 'retrospect.Thomas', 'Jane', 'vibrant', 'sometimes', 'exhilerating', 'spirit', 'was', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'homage', 'troubled', 'soul', 'Taken', 'letters', 'written', 'Cassady', 'smoky', 'untethered', 'glimpse', 'what', 'may', 'only', 'surmise', 'tortured', 'attempt', 'define', 'man', 'movie', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'then', 'again', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'fly', 'wall', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'far', 'characters', 'movie', 'people', 'once', 'knew', 'hung', 'out', 'corner', 'gas', 'staion', 'whom', 'rode', 'chicken', 'races', 'country', 'highways', 'etc', 'younger', 'viewer', 'are', ""40's/50"", 'buff', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'much', 'need', 'have', 'lived', 'less', 'complicated', 'time', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'unequivicable', 'simplicity', 'life', 'illicits', 'such', 'passion', 'such', 'pain', 'such', 'agony', 'living.What', 'was', 'Cassady', 'doing', 'was', 'chasing', 'dream', 'only', 'hoped', 'understand', 'Wan', 'come', 'ride', 'Be', 'aware', 'are', 'bumps', 'detours', 'dead', 'ends', 'way', 'P.S', 'fine', 'supporting', 'role', 'Keanu', 'clean', 'precision', 'acting', 'lesser', 'role']",Last Time I Commited Suicide VHS

I also bought Tomb Raider, and was expecting to hate that, and like this. Funny that.I survived a very long 28 minutes, and then switched it off. I just couldn't watch it anymore. I wasn't concentrating on it, and if I'm getting bored during a film, I will check how long has gone by. I first checked 15 minutes into the film.I am crazy about Keanu Reeves, so I thought this film would be a good buy. Plus, it's not very well known, and I was shocked to find out it was made in 1997 - I thought it would have been early nineties or so. If you think Keanu Reeves is gorgeous, do not buy this. He looks about average. I dunno whether its due to the storyline or what, but he acts like he's drunk, and looks &amp; acts like a total sleazebag. His hair looks greasy, and he just doesn't look like him!Anyway, back to the film. None of the characters are introduced, leading to me get very confused about the lead character, who starts off the film, kissing a girl in a hospital, and then going home, and sleeping with another girl, who decides to slash her wrists just before I stopped watching. He then proceeds to run off with his &quot;mate&quot; Keanu Reeves, and pick up two girls along the way.Maybe the film gets better later on, and maybe I'll watch it again sometime.

49528,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0783222424,mirasreviews,"[26, 29]","&quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; was adapted for the screen by director Stephen Kay from a letter written by Beat  icon Neal Cassady to his friend, author Jack Kerouac. In this letter, Cassady recounted his youthful adventures in Denver in 1945-1946. During this time, Cassady supported himself working the graveyard shift for a tire company and spent his days chasing women, &quot;borrowing&quot; cars, and hanging out at the pool hall with an older deadbeat acquaintance named Harry. The film's sights and sounds often mimic Cassady's  frenetic personality. His skirt-chasing and petty mischief are set to the sounds of bebop, and the film's cinematography sometimes exhibits a hyperactive nervousness. &quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; doesn't seem to have a point...or even a focus. It is simply a dramatization of the events of Neal Cassady's life when he was 18-19 years old. He was no more or less aimless than than he was to become, although he did not yet consider aimlessness to be a vocation in itself. Actor Thomas Jane does a nice job as Cassady, although he appears too old for the part. Keanu Reeves put on some weight for his role, and he is convincing as Neal's vaguely creepy and frequently drunk pool hall buddy Harry. Adrien Brody and Gretchen Mol also contribute interesting supporting performances. This is not a bad movie. But the audience's reaction to this film is going to depend entirely upon their attitude toward -and knowledge of- the real Neal Cassady. &quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; is simply a slice of his life. There is no attempt to place Cassady's experiences in any larger context, concrete or abstract. So the film doesn't have general appeal. You either find Cassady interesting or you don't. So I'm recommending &quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; to fans of Neal Cassady and students of Beat culture.

Gretchen Mol surprises as a hot, sexy underage sexpot Neal can't keep his hands off of.

While not action packed like many block buster movies the public is used to seeing Keanu Reeves star in, it does have an emotional depth that is well acted.I must add that it is wonderful to see young stars like Thomas Jane, Adrian Brody, Amy Smart and Gretchen Mol before they became popular and stars of blockbuster movies.",4,Subtle and Tragic,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,619,"['wife', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'writers', 'recently', 'found', 'movie', 'based', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'letter', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'great', 'story', 'choices', 'people', 'make', 'how', 'may', 'change', 'trajectory', 'ones', 'life', 'not', 'action', 'packed', 'many', 'block', 'buster', 'movies', 'public', 'used', 'seeing', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'star', 'have', 'emotional', 'depth', 'well', 'acted.I', 'must', 'add', 'wonderful', 'see', 'young', 'stars', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'became', 'popular', 'stars', 'blockbuster', 'movies']",Last Time I Commited Suicide VHS
