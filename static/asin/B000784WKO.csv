For light-hearted entertainment about a young married couple set on self-sufficiency and all its highs and lows, with no violence (except for the slaying of occasional pig or chicken -- but even that was out of sight -- and only for survival of the Good's.  Except for the clothing, the program never ages.  It is fun to watch how the Good's lifestyle &#34;rubs off&#34; on their next door neighbors, who still try to maintain their roles in the rat race and class consciousness.Unfortunately after watching the entire four seasons, I was disappointed that the last show did not include the visit of Queen Elizabeth to the set, which was included in the television broadcst.Reading up on the actors in the program, I just learned of the recent passing of Mr. Richard Briers.

I'm thrilled to finally have the whole thing.  All of the characters are brilliantly done, my personal favorites being the very sophisticated neighbors that act as the foyle for the Goods and their self-sufficiency lifestyle.  The situation is hillarious.  The neighbors, the Leadbetters, are a stitch because they take take their sophistication and position in society so seriously (Margo is a little bit of a Hyacinth Bucket).  Barbara Good is so cute you just can't help loving her.  Tom Good is a nutcase, but his determination to live an alternative lifestyle fuels the humor of the show.  The cast members are all very distinguished British actors; Richard Briars, Penelope Keith, Paul Eddington, and Felicity Kendal are all well known from other very popular British shows.  This series is a classic you'll watch over and over again.  I've been watching episodes for the last 20 years and have never tired of them.  There is nothing trite or cheap about the humor; the laughs all flow from character, not gag lines.  So, in my opinion, it is much more sophisticated and clever than American TV.

I have watched these episodes again and again and never grow tired of them.Meet Tom.  Tom is tired of working for a company that needs him to design stuff like plastic toys for breakfast cereals.  Ah ha!  Tom gets wild idea of chucking it all in and going back to nature by turning his suburban home into a self-sufficient farm, animals and garden and woodstove and all.  Meet his wife, the long-suffering, ever-delightful Barbara.  Watch out for her flashing temper and wicked sense of humor as she learns to muck out pig styes, attempts to create their own clothing, and bemoans the ruin of her one remaining good frock.Meet Jerry and Margo, their next door neighbors.  Jerry still works as an executive in the corporate rat-race Tom leaves behind.  He's aided in this by well-meaning but sometimes more snooty than her own good Margo, who fancies herself not just the wife of an up-and-coming exec, but as the center of the social whirlwind.  Jerry would rather just put his feet up and have a drink.  Margo can't bear the thought of pigs living next door or her Christmas in a Van not being delivered on time--what is England coming to, after all?This show has wonderful dialogue, great characters that you will never forget, bits that will make you fall down laughing and bits that will make you cry.

Today's producers would see this as sappy or unrealistic, and give us the humor without the heart: The Good's and the Ledbetter's would be friends at the beginning, but then be moving away and/or divorcing by the end of the series (or perhaps trying a bit of wife-swapping).Thankfully, these very diverse personalities were drawn together not by similarities in their tastes and values, but by location and circumstance, and grew to value each other as a result.

877880,A1DMYUSXX77JEW,B000784WKO,Robert Bauer,"[12, 12]","This is one of the greatest not only of British, but of American TV shows as well. Such a great group of actors and some of the greatest acting and writing as well. I fell in love with this show when it ran on PBS in the late 1970's as ""The Good Neighbors"", and since the early 1980's it hasn't been shown on tv at all. Many times while watching I laughed so hard that I hurt myself. It's very rare to find a show that makes you laugh and at the same time makes you feel good. It has very funny moments but also some very touching moments as well. Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal, Penelope Keith, and Paul Eddington are some of the most professional actors around and they were perfectly cast in this show. And what a great premise for a show. Briers plays Tom Good, a middle class suburban draftsman who at 40 is sick and tired of the rat race and wants something fulfulling in his life. Most people can agree with that. Thats one reason that his character is so loved. He decides to become self sufficient. Kendal is his loving wife who goes along with his dream. She is 100 percent supportive of him. Briers decides to get rid of most material things. No electricity(he builds his own generator for light), no phone, tv, stove to cook (he finds an old wood burning one), etc. He turns to farming and in no time rips up his back lawn, and starts to grow vegetables on it. He trades in his car for a cultivator. He wants to live off the land. It is very hard work but Tom and Barbara(his wife) feel it will be fulfulling. Keith and Eddington play Margot and Jerry Ledbetter, his next door neighbors. Jerry worked with Tom, and was stunned to learn of Toms new undertaking. Jerry is quite similar to Tom. Middle class and easy going and is willing to help Tom if he needs it. At times you almost feel that Jerry would want to give up his chaise lounge chair, and his daily cocktails to join up with Tom. Margot,on the other hand, is the primadonna of the snobs. She can't stand what Tom and Barbara are doing, bringing in pigs, goats, and chickens which Tom and Barbara are raising right next door to her garden which she loves and cherishes. She is constantly trying to make Tom feel guilty for dragging ""Poor Barbara"" into all of this. She is always ordering henpecked husband Jerry into answering the door or phone, or lighting her cigarette or any of her other little whims.They all perform brilliantly.This Dvd set contains the first 3 seasons (7 shows each) from 1975-1977, along with a 1977 Christmas episode. A fourth season was done in 1977-78, but those episodes are not included here. They were included on a earlier Dvd set that is now out of print. Hopefully BBC video (or Acorn video which originally issued the Dvd) will rerelease it so all four seasons will be available. The very last episode was filmed as a Royal Command Performance and this is also available with the final 7 episodes on the same Dvd. The Queen of England was a huge fan of this show and it was performed especially for her. The quality of Series 1-3 is very good considering the 30 years ago of filming or videotaping. The Dvd also contains interviews of cast, and crew, and fans of the show. In closing I'm so happy that the first 3 seasons of the show are now available, and hopefully the last season will be reissued soon so I have the complete collection. This is a must 4 dvd set for anyone interested in good, clean comedy that they just don't make anymore.

But I own all of these episodes on VHS, and so had to write something to encourage anyone looking at this item to purchase it.""The Good Life"" is at its base the story of Tom and Barbara Good, a happily married couple living in Surbiton, a London suburb.  Tom designs toy prizes for cereal boxes until the night he decides that he and Barbara should try something new: living in an entirely self-sufficient manner.  What this translates to is transforming their suburban home into a smallholding (farm).How this happens, and the Good's adventures in farming, are only part of the humor.  Tom and Barbara are funny, but it's their neighbor, Margot Leadbetter, who makes tis show really stand out.  Margot's husband Jerry used to be Tom's boss, and they've all been friends for a long time.  Margot is a dreadful snob, even thought deep down she truly is a good and caring friend.  It's an indication of the writing quality (and the quality of Penelope Keith's performance) that while Margot could have become a caricature, she never does.  Instead she is slowly revealed as a fascinating and affectionate woman who, although she thinks Tom and Barbara are crazy, nonetheless loves them and wants to be their friend.The actors are all solid, and soldily funny, the concept cute and fertile ground for jokes, but it's the timelessness and non-gimicky friendship of the show's characters, and the solid cast, that makes ""The Good Life"" a classic, not just in British comedy, but all comedy.  The fact that this show was selected to do a Royal Command Performance will give some indication of how enormously popular and funny it was.If you like ""Fawlty Towers,"" ""The Office,"" ""Father Ted,"" etc., you will love The Good Life.

Another reviewer compared it to ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Good Neighbors was described as a 1970s show about an upper-middle-class couple, Tom and Barbara, leaving the rat race to become self-sufficient farmers. Since I lived through the 70s ""revolution"" I envisioned great potential for comedy.Alas, none of the above is accurate.The rat race Tom was leaving was a well paying, low pressure, comfortable job as a designer, to convert his London suburb house into a farm with a noisy tractor, pigs, a goat and even a horse, to which the neighborhood, and the government did not seem to object. On one hand the show aims to express the 70s ideology of back to nature, self-sufficiency, etc., on the other the couple still enjoys the trappings of upper-middle-class life, like a fancy restaurant and jewelry. Tom even has no problem taking illegal size fish, or shooting rabbits with a shotgun on a public golfcourse. Barbara takes the hard work and impoverished life with a somewhat fake perkiness and glee.Their neighbors, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington, are much more fun to watch. Without them the show would be quite flat.It is interesting that the show was a favorite of the Queen of England.I could overlook the improbable and contrived situations if the show was funnier.

Blessed with a uniformly superb cast & exceptionally sharp writing, these episodes are thoroughly rewatchable; and if I have any complaint, it's only that there aren't more of them. But perhaps that's just as well: better to have a few A+ episodes than too many sub-par ones.The ideal of self-sufficiency ... haven't we all considered it at some point or another, if only for a fleeting moment? Getting out of the rat race, making a life that's far more meaningful? OK, few of us will ever actually manage that! But we can certainly enjoy this comedic depiction of such an attempt. It does make clear just how hard a life it would be, even within the cozy confines of a TV sitcom!And the characters themselves! I especially like that the writers didn't settle for one-dimensional cutouts. Tom Good can be a bit pushy & irritating at times, but he'd need such qualities to make the leap from vague wish to grimy reality in the first place. And his deep love for wife Barbara is plain to see, as is hers for her determined husband. Of course, Barbara herself may look like a lovely waif, but she's got plenty of backbone & fire -- Tom doesn't push her around!Neighbors Jerry & Margot could easily have been flat characters, existing as negative foils for the Goods; instead, we get two real people, generally happy with their own way of life, genuinely puzzled by Tom & Barbara's rejection of that life -- but ultimately supportive of their friends. Margot is a special delight: not the mere snob she first appears, she's honest, loyal, and a force to be reckoned with. Despite their squabbling, it's clear that she & Jerry do love one another, and treasure their eccentric best friends.So treat yourself to many evenings of viewing pleasure with this fine collection!
