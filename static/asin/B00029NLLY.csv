Lots of people think he was a poor actor and was ""in over his head"". . . so not true! He portrays Cotton, a young outlaw gang, perfectly. And you gotta love the trench coat.I also read some reviews (not necessarily on this site) when people said Willie Nelson should stick to singing or whatever. I thought he was good. He plays a guy who (kinda) wants to be good, but he just can't help it, like it's a bad habit or something.So many old actors!The old man on the bike was just too funny. Especially that shot when he's riding down a hill against the sunset and three of his buddies are behind him on horseback.This is a great movie, a classic, and will always have a place in my home.",5,Once upon a Texas Train,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,826,"['really', 'knew', 'funny', ""'80s"", 'sisters', 'watched', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing.Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Lots', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'actor', 'was', 'head', 'not', 'true', 'Cotton', 'young', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'perfectly', 'got', 'ta', 'trench', 'coat.I', 'also', 'read', 'reviews', 'not', 'necessarily', 'site', 'when', 'people', 'said', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'should', 'stick', 'singing', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'kinda', 'be', 'good', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'bad', 'habit', 'something.So', 'many', 'old', 'actors', 'old', 'man', 'bike', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'Especially', 'shot', 'when', 'riding', 'down', 'hill', 'sunset', 'three', 'buddies', 'are', 'horseback.This', 'great', 'movie', 'classic', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'place', 'home']",Once Upon a Texas Train
828399,AXWMTQ35JH01S,B00029NLLY,"Gerald T. Westbrook ""GTW""","[2, 4]","Once Upon a Texas TrainNear the start of this movie there is a prison scene, where a prisoner is being released. The head administrator and the warden are shown in very sharp looking clothing. However, there is no way one would expect to see such very well dressed individuals working in ome miserable jail. Hence there is a bit of loss in credibility at the start.However, this movie is cast as a spoof on westerns, but it is not as good a spoof as:* The Cheyenne Social Club;* The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday;* The Hallelujah Trail and* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.In spite of these two shortcomings this is a rather interesting movie. One of the major pluses in this movie is to see some of the old characters that were originally seen in such classics as:* The Over the Hill Gang, and* The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again.The plot features an attempted train robbery 20 years ago. The robbers are caught by the Texas Rangers and shipped off to jail. The head robber (Willie Nelson) is now being released for good behavior. But the minute he is released he, and his brother (Dub Taylor) pull off bank robbery. And they plan to go after the train robbery they bungled 20 years ago. Nelson's aged gang includes:* former ""Gun-smoke"" deputy, Ken Curtis and* western character actors, Royal Deno and Gene EvansThe head of the Texas Rangers (Richard Widmark), who sent Nelson to jail prepares to chase him again. The now somewhat aged Rangers include:* former ""Rifleman"", Chuck Conners;* past ""Cimarrin Strip"" marshal, Stuart Whitman and* former ""Dakota's"" deputy jack Elam.This plot is made even more complicated when one learns that Angie Dickinson originally intended to wed the character played by Willie Nelson, but marries the character played by Richard Widmark, when Nelson goes to jail. Despite this complexity, the question on credibility and the lower ranking of it as a spoof, this movie is worth ones time and money. On balance it gets four stars.",4,A Train and Bank Robbery in Texas,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,1969,"['Once', 'Texas', 'TrainNear', 'start', 'movie', 'prison', 'scene', 'where', 'prisoner', 'being', 'released', 'head', 'administrator', 'warden', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'sharp', 'looking', 'clothing', 'However', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'such', 'very', 'well', 'dressed', 'individuals', 'working', 'ome', 'miserable', 'jail', 'Hence', 'bit', 'loss', 'credibility', 'start.However', 'movie', 'cast', 'spoof', 'westerns', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'spoof', 'Cheyenne', 'Social', 'Club', 'Great', 'Scout', 'Cathouse', 'Thursday', '*', 'Hallelujah', 'Trail', 'and*', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid.In', 'spite', 'two', 'shortcomings', 'rather', 'interesting', 'movie', 'One', 'major', 'pluses', 'movie', 'see', 'old', 'characters', 'were', 'originally', 'seen', 'such', 'classics', 'Over', 'Hill', 'Gang', 'Hill', 'Gang', 'Rides', 'Again.The', 'plot', 'attempted', 'train', 'robbery', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'robbers', 'are', 'caught', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'shipped', 'jail', 'head', 'robber', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'now', 'being', 'released', 'good', 'behavior', 'minute', 'released', 'brother', 'Dub', 'Taylor', 'pull', 'off', 'bank', 'robbery', 'plan', 'go', 'train', 'robbery', 'bungled', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Nelson', 'aged', 'gang', '*', 'former', 'Gun-smoke', 'deputy', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'western', 'character', 'actors', 'Royal', 'Deno', 'Gene', 'EvansThe', 'head', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'who', 'sent', 'Nelson', 'jail', 'prepares', 'chase', 'again', 'now', 'somewhat', 'aged', 'Rangers', 'include', '*', 'former', 'Rifleman', 'Chuck', 'Conners', '*', 'Cimarrin', 'Strip', 'marshal', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'former', 'Dakota', 'deputy', 'jack', 'Elam.This', 'plot', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'one', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'originally', 'intended', 'wed', 'character', 'played', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'character', 'played', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'when', 'Nelson', 'jail', 'complexity', 'question', 'credibility', 'lower', 'ranking', 'spoof', 'movie', 'worth', 'ones', 'time', 'money', 'balance', 'four', 'stars']",Once Upon a Texas Train
