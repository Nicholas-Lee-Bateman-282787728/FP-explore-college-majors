Don't they have other actors?  But this is beside the point, and in this movie he's done quite well.  Jeanne Moreau is superb as his mother, and Ardant also gives a very satisfying performance.  Overall, it's a good traditional production, in the realism style, and for those enjoying films of this kind it will be a pleasure to watch. But don't expect any novelty in it, and that's why I gave it 3 stars - I would want to see something more unusual or witty, maybe not such a traditional approach, something in style of the statue of Balzac by August Rodin.",3,Good quality production,1006473600,"11 23, 2001",2001,694,"['good', 'sturdy', 'film', 'Balzac', 'great', 'cast', 'one', 'little', 'tired', 'Gerard', 'being', 'French', 'production', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'actors', 'beside', 'point', 'movie', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'superb', 'mother', 'Ardant', 'also', 'very', 'satisfying', 'performance', 'Overall', 'good', 'traditional', 'production', 'realism', 'style', 'enjoying', 'films', 'kind', 'will', 'be', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'novelty', 'why', 'gave', '3', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'unusual', 'witty', 'maybe', 'not', 'such', 'traditional', 'approach', 'something', 'style', 'statue', 'Balzac', 'August', 'Rodin']",Balzac: A Life of Passion

No, but this one does sweep through Balzac's life and hits the high points enough to make one want to read or know more.If there is one central theme to this entire series it is this:the little boy in Balzac NEVER got over the simple fact that his Mother never loved him.Everything he did,touched,wrote was colored by his cold abandonment of his Mother.With that in mind,watch this sweeping biopic masterfully executed by the likes of Gerard Depardieu,Jeanne Moreau and Fanny Ardent and be transported into a very accurate portrayal of the times that the likes of Balzac,Hugo,Sand and Sue lived and wrote.EXCELLENT COMPANION FILMS would be COLONEL CHABERT and COUSIN BETTE (both adapted from Balzac) and LES MISERABLES (by Victor Hugo) and IMPROMPTU (about Georges Sand and Chopin) to help fill in the spaces in that period of history.DO NOT PURCHASE THE ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION!!!!

558406,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00004Y7CX,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","Personally, I enjoyed reading Balzac's novels and as a writer he fascinated me.  But I knew next to nothing about Balzac, the man.  I found this 2 disc DVD French biography of a writer performed by Gerard Depardieu to be greatly informative about his life and personal struggles.  Obese and physically unattractive, Balzac has wonderful mind and great spririt that women find irresistible.  He finds his inspiration everywhere: people he mets and interacts with, art, friend artists (like Victor Hugo) who share his passion for writing.Jeanne Moreau gives unforgetable performance as Balzac's emotionally cold and distant mother.  It is her demand and criticism that pushes Balzac to become one of the greatest writers in French literature.  He did everything he could throughout his life to earn her love and approval without any success.This DVD will not educate much about the works of Balzac, but it will give a complete picture of Balzac's temperament, his excesses and passion for life and love.  I enjoyed the wit and humor and charged emotion of performers in this biographical story about an extraodinary man who personal suffering helped create some of the most beautiful works of literature to this day.",4,Balzac's life,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,1214,"['Personally', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'Balzac', 'novels', 'writer', 'fascinated', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'Balzac', 'man', 'found', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'French', 'biography', 'writer', 'performed', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'be', 'greatly', 'informative', 'life', 'personal', 'struggles', 'Obese', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'Balzac', 'wonderful', 'mind', 'great', 'spririt', 'women', 'find', 'irresistible', 'inspiration', 'everywhere', 'people', 'interacts', 'art', 'friend', 'artists', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'who', 'share', 'passion', 'writing.Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'unforgetable', 'performance', 'Balzac', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'distant', 'mother', 'demand', 'criticism', 'Balzac', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'writers', 'French', 'literature', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'life', 'earn', 'love', 'approval', 'success.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'educate', 'much', 'works', 'Balzac', 'will', 'give', 'complete', 'picture', 'Balzac', 'temperament', 'excesses', 'passion', 'life', 'love', 'enjoyed', 'wit', 'humor', 'charged', 'emotion', 'performers', 'biographical', 'story', 'extraodinary', 'man', 'who', 'personal', 'suffering', 'helped', 'create', 'most', 'beautiful', 'works', 'literature', 'day']",Balzac: A Life of Passion

Depardieu, looking bigger than ever, is certainly a perfect embodied of the bloated physical persona of Balzac. And is even a match for the well-known sculpture by Auguste Rodin.What's missing are the things that triggered the great writer's stories. A top notch international cast, including Jeanne Moreau as Balzac's domineering mother, and Fanny Ardent as married Russian noblewoman Eva Hanska, the love of his love, contribute a lot to making this three hour French TV biopic an engaging diversion.
