A turk in Greece and a greek in Turkey, young Fanis can only find himself at home in the kitchen  making the recipes that he learned from the women of his family, and from his dear grandfather, who teached him about spices  while teaching him about the wonders of the universe.A  love story about a city, Istambul, the movie is a delight while young Fanis is a young boy: the family is loving and funny, and you can almost smell the cooking; but as he grows and turns into a middle age science wiz who can't forget not  his childhood city, neither the beautiful girl he left behind; the movie becomes too mellow, too sweet, too predictable.It  just missed the right spice.",3,It just missed the right spice,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,928,"['list', 'favorites', 'movies', 'Life', 'beautiful', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Il', 'Postino', 'Touch', 'spice', 'perfect', 'movie', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'boy', 'unable', 'find', 'welcome', 'two', 'cities', 'life', 'Istambul', 'Athens', 'turk', 'Greece', 'greek', 'Turkey', 'young', 'Fanis', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'home', 'kitchen', 'making', 'recipes', 'learned', 'women', 'family', 'dear', 'grandfather', 'who', 'teached', 'spices', 'teaching', 'wonders', 'universe.A', 'love', 'story', 'city', 'Istambul', 'movie', 'delight', 'young', 'Fanis', 'young', 'boy', 'family', 'loving', 'funny', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'cooking', 'middle', 'age', 'science', 'wiz', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'not', 'childhood', 'city', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'left', 'behind', 'movie', 'too', 'mellow', 'too', 'sweet', 'too', 'predictable.It', 'just', 'missed', 'right', 'spice']",N/A

1253822,A2FJBJ947VUOGT,B0027AB988,giovanni,"[2, 5]","A family movie at it's core , Touch Of Spice tells the story of Fanis , who has to leave Istanbul at an early age for Athens , due to the difficult relationships between Greece and Turkey . The memories that have stayed in his mind more than anything , are the stories , recipies and knowledge about cooking his grandfather used to tell him , the time the two were spending together . At 45 , our hero has to go back in order to visit his grandpa who has suddently fallen ill .The film had been one of the biggest hits of greek cinema in the past decade yet it's a strangely harmless , spineless proposition , totally apolitikal and rather mellow . Director Tasos Boulmentis has chosen to take as few risks as possible . Considering the huge iamount of money the production costed ( for greek standards always ) , maybe that's not so unexpected .A Touch Of Spice avoids to examine the sensitive issues of that period in Greece's history . The script fails to convicingly present the simple love themes it choses to tell as well . When Fanis fo back to Istanbul , he meets a childhood friend played by the gorgeous turkish actress Basak K&ouml;kl&uuml;kaya . She used to dance for him in his grandfather's attic when they where little . She has never stopped loving him , she says and sheds a tear...ah come on! Weren't they , like , seven year olds when they last met ? Both Chorafas and K&ouml;kl&uuml;kaya are talented and beautiful yet they are given little to work with . As for the rest of the characters , they all remain strictly one dimensional as well through out the whole movie .Overall ,the movie is sweet , nostalgic , feel good and withought any edge ( salt ? pepper ? ) whatsoever . More of a lost opportunity than a hit and miss then .",2,"Too much sugar , not enough spice",1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1751,"['family', 'movie', 'core', 'Touch', 'Spice', 'story', 'Fanis', 'who', 'leave', 'Istanbul', 'early', 'age', 'Athens', 'due', 'difficult', 'relationships', 'Greece', 'Turkey', 'memories', 'have', 'stayed', 'mind', 'more', 'anything', 'are', 'stories', 'recipies', 'knowledge', 'cooking', 'grandfather', 'used', 'tell', 'time', 'two', 'were', 'spending', 'together', '45', 'hero', 'go', 'back', 'order', 'visit', 'grandpa', 'who', 'suddently', 'fallen', 'ill', '.The', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'biggest', 'hits', 'greek', 'cinema', 'past', 'decade', 'yet', 'strangely', 'harmless', 'spineless', 'proposition', 'totally', 'apolitikal', 'rather', 'mellow', 'Director', 'Tasos', 'Boulmentis', 'chosen', 'take', 'few', 'risks', 'possible', 'Considering', 'huge', 'iamount', 'money', 'production', 'costed', 'greek', 'standards', 'always', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'unexpected', '.A', 'Touch', 'Spice', 'avoids', 'examine', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'period', 'Greece', 'history', 'script', 'convicingly', 'present', 'simple', 'love', 'themes', 'tell', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Fanis', 'back', 'Istanbul', 'childhood', 'friend', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'turkish', 'actress', 'Basak', 'K', 'ouml', 'uuml', 'kaya', 'used', 'dance', 'grandfather', 'attic', 'when', 'where', 'little', 'never', 'stopped', 'loving', 'tear', 'come', 'Were', ""n't"", 'seven', 'year', 'olds', 'when', 'last', 'met', 'Chorafas', 'K', 'ouml', 'uuml', 'kaya', 'are', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'work', 'rest', 'characters', 'remain', 'strictly', 'one', 'dimensional', 'well', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', '.Overall', 'movie', 'sweet', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'good', 'withought', 'edge', 'salt', 'whatsoever', 'More', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'hit', 'miss', 'then']",N/A
