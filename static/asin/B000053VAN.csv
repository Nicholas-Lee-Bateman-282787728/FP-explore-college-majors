Then one of the kids from Steinmetz finds the answers to the test they have to take. Only one girl has to even think about ""if"" they should cheat. The real question is how to get away with it.

Steinmetz HS is an overcrowded, underfunded school located in a poorer section of Chicago. Most of the students appear to be from blue-collar backgrounds. Gerard Plecki, an English teacher (well played be Jeff Daniels) organizes the AD team to try to compete at regionals, particulary against favorite and rival, Whitney Young High School, portrayed as a magnet school. At first the morale and motivation is high amongst the Steinmetz team but as they severely lose to Whitney Young at regionals, they increasingly view their situation as hopeless and lack confidence to compete at the state finals. However an interesting dilemma comes up as one of the team members comes up with a copy of the test for the state finals. Should the team cheat or stay honest? If they cheat, will they get away with it?I thought this movie was excellent and honest. Although it wasn't right for Steinmetz to cheat, the movie shows that the world is not a level playing field and that people from more white-collar walks of life have much higher advantages and potential for success than those from blue-collar walks of life.",5,Excellent movie,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1186,"['Cheaters', '1995', 'Academic', 'Decathlon', 'team', 'Steinmetz', 'High', 'School', 'Steinmetz', 'HS', 'overcrowded', 'underfunded', 'school', 'located', 'poorer', 'section', 'Chicago', 'Most', 'students', 'appear', 'be', 'blue-collar', 'backgrounds', 'Gerard', 'Plecki', 'English', 'teacher', 'well', 'played', 'be', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'AD', 'team', 'try', 'compete', 'regionals', 'particulary', 'favorite', 'rival', 'Whitney', 'Young', 'High', 'School', 'portrayed', 'magnet', 'school', 'first', 'morale', 'motivation', 'high', 'Steinmetz', 'team', 'severely', 'lose', 'Whitney', 'Young', 'regionals', 'increasingly', 'view', 'situation', 'hopeless', 'lack', 'confidence', 'compete', 'state', 'finals', 'However', 'interesting', 'dilemma', 'up', 'one', 'team', 'members', 'up', 'copy', 'test', 'state', 'finals', 'Should', 'team', 'cheat', 'stay', 'honest', 'cheat', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'Steinmetz', 'cheat', 'movie', 'world', 'not', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'people', 'more', 'white-collar', 'walks', 'life', 'have', 'much', 'higher', 'advantages', 'potential', 'success', 'blue-collar', 'walks', 'life']",Cheaters

The students were of Latino descent and most of them were from the barrio and the media perception on them was negative.  He proved them wrong by standing by his students and delivering to the mainstream that these students weren't as stupid as they were made out to be.In this movie, the teacher Gerald Plecki taught his students to cheat out of frustration with the school's lack of interest in promoting academics and the drastic budget cuts on the use of equipment (photocopier).  Plecki wanted to ensure the students that they were bright and could win the decathalon despite what was happening.  But disappointment came when they wer in fifth place.  To be first place and go on to nationals they would have to pump harder into their studies.  But some of the students had other responsibilities like an afterschool job or babysitting siblings when the parent had to work.  The only way for them to get into nationals was to cheat.  With help from a student in the group, they were set to win.  Through the exhilaration of being champions, they never counted on being thrusted into the other side of the spotlight.&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; was a triumph for a teacher who didn't give up on his students and for the students who didn't give up on themselves.  &quot;Cheaters&quot; was a downfall for a teacher who was tired of being kicked around by the elitist, the school board, and the faculty and for the students, despite their academic abilities, were tired of being made to feel that they don't count.Nobody likes a snitch as much as dishonesty, but Irwin was in his right to say what he had to say.  He watched as his fellow classmates were winning medals, while he was playing judge, which was tearing him up inside.  He wrote it down on paper in class, which he had to cover his tracks for the sake of the school and the teacher but it was too much to bear when he knew he wasn't a part of the group anymore.  He contacted a reporter and gave her the scoop.Talk about honesty!  Despite what had happened, there are some people out there that put on a great show when they are doing far worse than the students and the teacher.

I was incensed while reading the reviews that customers have given this movie.  There are a few common misconceptions that people seems to believe, and it's entirely the fault of irresponsible filmmakers seeking a better plot through sensationalism.  Prior to this film's release, the monitors in our lunchrooms advertised the movie because of our schools involvement.  However, after there was a screening to the staff of the school, we were told not to believe the film, that it was not all true.  Since no WY faculty was consulted for the film-- only Steinmetz faculty-- it's obvious why a bias existed.  Whitney Young is NOT a suburban school.  It is in the heart of Chicago.  We don't recieve any special funding.  Our bathroom stalls are written on,we have disciplinary problems, the usual.  True, maybe ours aren't as bad as Steinmetz', but we are in no way treated any differently by the Chicago PublicSchools.  The late Acadec coach who was shown betting in the movie was not the type of man who would do such a thing.  our cheerleaders don't go to acadec competitions!  we're not cocky, we don't think we're better than anyone else and we're one of the most diverse schools in chicago.  the acadec team alone probably represents at least 10 different races.

565585,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B000053VAN,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[22, 24]","I was lucky enough to catch Cheaters on HBO around two in the morning.  Though it might, at first, appear to be just another overly ""hip"" teen comedy, Cheaters is actually one of the best films about high school that I've ever seen.  Nicely blending comedy and coming-of-age drama, Cheaters tells the true story of how underdog Stienmetz High School won the 1995 Illinios Academic Decathalon just to then lose their accolades when it was revealed they'd cheated.  As someone who was a part of the whole AcDec subculture in high school, I can say that this film managed to perfectly capture the feeling and the atmosphere of that competition, showing not only how it often gives a much needed sense of purpose to students who, otherwise, don't have a place in the highly regimented caste system of high school but also how public, urban-based schools often face a great deal of elitist bias in favor of more exclusive private and magnet schools.  While the film never makes the mistake of excusing or trivializing the cheating, it also makes it clear that the students of Stienmetz and similar schools often are treated unfairly by a stagnant system that has decided to give up on them.  In the end, it's hard not to feel sympathetic to these students even as they cheat and it's also hard not to feel that, whatever mistakes were made, the actions taken as a result, by both the media and the Chicago School Board, were even worse.  The film perfectly captures the exhiliration of the student's initial victory and, just as perfectly, the terror of being judged in the mad feeding frenzy that grew out of the Stienmetz Scandal.  (In one of the film's best scenes, we watch as investigators tell lies of their own to trick the students into confessing just to then give a press conference where they tell reporters that the students are the ""coldest,"" most calculating bunch of liars they've ever experienced.)  The film benefits from a talented cast of mostly unknown young actors who manage to flawlessly blend into an always-watchable ensemble.  The stand-out amongst the younger actors is Jena Malone, showing a previously untapped range as the most unrepentant of the cheaters.  She manages to be chillingly single-minded in the way only a teenager can while at the same time displaying an appealing vulnerability.  Too smart for the world of teenagers yet to young for the world of adults, Malone gives a performance similar to Reese Whitherspoon's ground-breaking and brilliant work in Election (which, itself, makes a nice companion piece to this film) but at the same time claims this character as uniquely her own and establishes herself as an underrated actress to watch.  As the AcDec coach, Jeff Daniels gives probably his best performance since the Purple Rose of Cairo, bringing some wonderfully ambigous shadings to a character who, at first, just seems to be a stereotypical wimp.  After years of appearing in roles not up to his talent, Daniels reminds us that he is one of our most unpredictable actors and his performance here, bravely playing a character who isn't always likeable, will keep viewers guessing as to whether Daniels is the story's hero or its villian.  Amongst the other performances, mention should be made of Paul Sorvino who gives a brilliantly comical performance as the school's clueless principal.  Even as one is left to ponder the many issues raised by the film, it's hard not to smile at just the image of Sorvino, joyously and ineptly dancing at a school pep rally while the band plays a listless version of ""Gonna Fly Now.""  Its a small, almost cliched role but Sorvino brings a touch of inspired lunacy to both it and the film.John Stockwell, who both directed and wrote the script, has made a name for himself by making films that deal with flawed human beings whose only real mistake is realizing that the world is made up of shades of gray even as everyone else insists that everything is black-and-white.  A former actor who, like the students of Stienmetz, never quite got the appreciation he deserved, Stockwell has shown with this film, his later Crazy/Beautiful, and his script for Breast Men to have a valuable and unique talent for catching the absurdities of everyday life, consistently crafting scenes that manage to be both surprising and true-to-life.  (Certainly one of the highlights here is a small but knowing scene where Daniels and his students plan their post-scandal damage control by watching Stand and Deliver, the prototype for the many dedicated-teacher-in-urban-school-films that this film both comments on and sends up).  With Cheaters, Stockwell maintains a perfect combination of the absurd and the realistic while keeping the story moving at just the right pace.  As well, Stockwell takes one of the most overused techniques of modern film -- the montage scored by an alternative top ten hit -- and actually manages to pull it off.  This alone makes him nearly unique amongst Hollywood's young directors.  Perhaps even more so than Crazy/Beautiful, Cheaters proves that John Stockwell is one of the most interesting unknown directors out there and stands as a glowing testament to both his talent and the talents of his unsung actors.  By all means, see this film.",5,Track down this film,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,5242,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'Cheaters', 'HBO', 'two', 'morning', 'might', 'first', 'appear', 'be',

The startling defeat is challenged without any proof of misconduct and as a viewer you really sympathize with the inner-city kids, even though they cheated.The performances from Jeff Daniels and young Jena Malone ('Bastard out of Carolina' and 'Stepmom') really hold the film together and keeps you rooting for these kids against the hypocrisy of the school board and the rich kids who have everything handed to them.This is one of the better HBO films to come out over the last year (in addition to the amazing 'The Corner') and will really make you think about the disparity and difference between socio-economic groups and the stigmatization some face when they triumph against the odds - no matter what the circumstances.",5,Surprisingly thought provoking and engaging HBO film,980208000,"01 23, 2001",2001,982,"['quot', 'Cheaters', 'quot', 'interesting', 'study', 'differences', 'suburban', 'inner-city', 'schools', 'biases', 'exist', 'when', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'academic', 'decathlon', 'team', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'reigning', 'champions', 'plush', 'suburb', 'startling', 'defeat', 'challenged', 'proof', 'misconduct', 'viewer', 'really', 'sympathize', 'inner-city', 'kids', 'even', 'cheated.The', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'young', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Carolina', ""'Stepmom"", 'really', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'keeps', 'rooting', 'kids', 'hypocrisy', 'school', 'board', 'rich', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'handed', 'them.This', 'one', 'better', 'HBO', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'addition', 'amazing', ""'The"", 'Corner', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'disparity', 'difference', 'socio-economic', 'groups', 'stigmatization', 'face', 'when', 'triumph', 'odds', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances']",Cheaters

Right away, you are sucked into the story and its characters, and it just made me so thankful for renting it! There is never a dull moment, and all throughout the film you glued to the screen. Even for a cast of teens, there is NEVER even remotely poor acting. And since the film goes into each character's life, you care so much for them and you really do not want them to get caught. In fact, I was so nervous for them, it was as if you don't know they do. When they do, they feel so bad for them, you almost can't stand it. I really wish I knew the real kids and Dr. Plecki of the Steinmetz scandel. I would love to just talk with them about their experiences, that's what the movie makes you do. Jena Malone, who plays the leader of the group, and Jeff Daniels, just steal the show. Each play their part with brilliance, and you remember them from this movie in my opinion.Usually, I tell the bad parts of a movie, but I can't think of any for this film except one thing: They get caught. But we already know, so I can't say it counts. You will love this movie, and if you buy it, I know you'll be please.
