349893,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6302994071,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[2, 2]","I'm not sure I'd describe this movie as excellent, or one of the best comedies. I'll leave that to the classcs that have earned that, particularly through the test of time. However, the word ""classic"" is loosely interpreted these days (See ""TCM"" or ""AMC"")- comedy moreso. And ""The Son-In-Law"" has a comfort food feel about it, in spite of the presence of the obtrusive talents of Pauly Shore, of whom I don't consider myself a fan of, but indeed a fan of a few movies of his. This is my favorite. Direction of this movie does a good job of making you feel the different perspectives of its characters, especially for a movie that really isn't meant to be taken that seriously. I don't think it's any coincidence that this movie finds lots of TV time around the holidays, because it does have a warm, fuzzy, familar feel to it, especially for a ""fish out of water"" comedy. Shore plays that fish well. I had actually hoped for better future scripts to utilize Shore after this. But his run was  very short lived. The supporting cast around him and a well cast Carla Gugino, the simple country girl whom Shore transforms from caterpillar to butterfly, too is nicely cast, including one of my favorite supporting/character actors Lane Smith, who in my opinion has a tendency to steal scenes in the movies he's part of. Long time fave Tiffani-Amber Theisan, and one time fave Patrick Renna, who put out his 2 best efforts of his career (including ""The Sandlot"") the year this movie was released), along with a few other famiilar faces combine for an effective cast that takes a simple plot and script and creates a fun movie that depends on archetypes to achieve it's end. What else would you expect from a Shore movie? Did anyone really expect Academy material from Shore after ""Encino Man""? This is one of those movies that I find myself watching whenever it's on. It's just a simple, fun movie. And there ain't nothing wrong with that.",3,Guilty pleasure fave of mine,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,1933,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'describe', 'movie', 'excellent', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'classcs', 'have', 'earned', 'particularly', 'test', 'time', 'However', 'word', 'classic', 'loosely', 'interpreted', 'days', 'See', 'TCM', 'AMC', 'comedy', 'moreso', 'Son-In-Law', 'comfort', 'food', 'feel', 'spite', 'presence', 'obtrusive', 'talents', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'fan', 'indeed', 'fan', 'few', 'movies', 'favorite', 'Direction', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'different', 'perspectives', 'characters', 'especially', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'coincidence', 'movie', 'lots', 'TV', 'time', 'holidays', 'have', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'familar', 'feel', 'especially', 'fish', 'water', 'comedy', 'Shore', 'fish', 'well', 'had', 'actually', 'hoped', 'better', 'future', 'scripts', 'utilize', 'Shore', 'run', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'lived', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'cast', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'simple', 'country', 'girl', 'whom', 'Shore', 'transforms', 'caterpillar', 'butterfly', 'too', 'nicely', 'cast', 'including', 'one', 'favorite', 'supporting/character', 'actors', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'who', 'opinion', 'tendency', 'steal', 'scenes', 'movies', 'part', 'Long', 'time', 'fave', 'Tiffani-Amber', 'Theisan', 'one', 'time', 'fave', 'Patrick', 'Renna', 'who', 'put', 'out', '2', 'best', 'efforts', 'career', 'including', 'Sandlot', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'other', 'famiilar', 'combine', 'effective', 'cast', 'simple', 'plot', 'script', 'fun', 'movie', 'archetypes', 'achieve', 'end', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Shore', 'movie', 'Did', 'anyone', 'really', 'expect', 'Academy', 'material', 'Shore', 'Encino', 'Man', 'one', 'movies', 'find', 'watching', 'whenever', 'just', 'simple', 'fun', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nothing', 'wrong']",Son in Law VHS

I'm really not a Pauly Shore fan, but this is probably his best movie.My kids wanted to watch this on Thanksgiving, and now that we've finished, I realized that it really is a fairly decent film.  Besides its somewhat predictable plot, the story is quite funny.  Pauly Shore plays a California college student, nicknamed Crawl, who goes home over Thanksgiving with his friend, played by Carla Gugino, to her parents' farm in &quot;middle America,&quot; as he puts it.  Crawl pretends to be his friend's fiance so she doesn't have to face her high school sweetheart, and proceeds to help out at the farm.  Throw the California city boy into farm life, and you can only imagine what type of trouble he gets into.Shore seems to be at his best in the role, and Gugino adds a lot of flavor to the film as well.  The acting on the whole was pretty good, and overall, it was a pretty enjoyable film to watch with my family.  It's funny and leaves you with a warm feeling in the end.

Shore plays a Shore-like resident assistant named Crawl at the California university chosen for matriculation by Rebecca of some farm (probably not Sunnybrook) in South Dakota.  Her jock boyfriend Travis, who apparently spends all of his free time trying to look more and more like Tom Cruise, doesn't want her to go, afraid she will change out there on her own.  Becca, as Crawl calls her, has a hard time adjusting to college life and is ready to quit and come home when Crawl convinces her to stay and try a little harder to fit in with the crowd.  Soon, shy little Rebecca has been shorn of her long hair, clothed in ""weasel ware,"" and tattooed, allowing her to mingle easily on the beach and at mud wrestling bars.  When she learns that Crawl is going to be alone during Thanksgiving, she invites him home with her.  Her parents and Travis are shocked when they see Becca's new undeniably hot look, but they are even more shocked when a lunatic in the form of Crawl shows up with her.  He takes to country life in his uniquely Shore-ian way, horrifying just about everyone in the state of South Dakota.  This is before Crawl announces that he and Becca are getting married, a lie engineered on the spot to forestall Travis' own marriage proposal to the new and improved Becca.  Dad decides to show Crawl what farming is like, trying to drive him away with the nastiest farm chores known to man, at which point much hilarity ensues.  In time, Crawl begins to win over Becca's family and even becomes a star attraction on the local square dance circuit, inspired by such songs as the theme to Green Acres and John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy.  Travis has his own plans for getting Becca back, though; feathers fly, and not just those from the turkey that gets loose in the house.Pauly Shore is in full Pauly Shore mode in this movie, but it works tremendously well here.  The acting is great all the way around, Carla Gugino is adorable, Shore is hilarious, and there's not a dull moment to be found from beginning to end.  I've watched this movie several times, with no noticeable decrease in the enjoyment factor from one viewing to the next.  My parents, who haven't been to a movie since I was a kid dragging them along with me, actually borrowed this movie from me; some of their friends had been trying to find this hilarious movie they had seen but could not remember the name of for some time, and I recognized the plot as soon as they got around to asking me about it.  It's a pretty unforgettable movie that appeals to a wide audience.  If you have avoided Son in Law like the plague just because Pauly Shore stars in it, I urge you to reconsider and give this movie a chance.  This is a very funny film the whole family can enjoy.",5,One of the best comedies I've ever seen,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,2867,"[""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'great', 'actor', 'Son', 'Law', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Shore', 'Shore-like', 'resident', 'assistant', 'named', 'Crawl', 'California', 'university', 'chosen', 'matriculation', 'Rebecca', 'farm', 'probably', 'not', 'Sunnybrook', 'South', 'Dakota', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'Travis', 'who', 'apparently', 'free', 'time', 'trying', 'look', 'more', 'more', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'afraid', 'will', 'change', 'out', 'there', 'own', 'Becca', 'Crawl', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'college', 'life', 'ready', 'quit', 'come', 'home', 'when', 'Crawl', 'stay', 'try', 'little', 'harder', 'fit', 'crowd', 'Soon', 'shy', 'little', 'Rebecca', 'been', 'shorn', 'long', 'hair', 'clothed', 'weasel', 'ware', 'tattooed', 'allowing', 'mingle', 'easily', 'beach', 'mud', 'wrestling', 'bars', 'When', 'Crawl', 'going', 'be', 'alone', 'Thanksgiving', 'home', 'parents', 'Travis', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'see', 'Becca', 'new', 'undeniably', 'hot', 'look', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'when', 'lunatic', 'form', 'Crawl', 'up', 'country', 'life', 'uniquely', 'Shore-ian', 'way', 'horrifying', 'just', 'everyone', 'state', 'South', 'Dakota', 'Crawl', 'announces', 'Becca', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'lie', 'engineered', 'spot', 'forestall', 'Travis', 'own', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'new', 'improved', 'Becca', 'Dad', 'show', 'Crawl', 'what', 'farming', 'trying', 'drive', 'away', 'nastiest', 'farm', 'chores', 'known', 'man', 'point', 'much', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'time', 'Crawl', 'win', 'over', 'Becca', 'family', 'even', 'star', 'attraction', 'local', 'square', 'dance', 'circuit', 'inspired', 'such', 'songs', 'theme', 'Green', 'Acres', 'John', 'Denver', 'Thank', 'God', ""'m"", 'Country', 'Boy', 'Travis', 'own', 'plans', 'getting', 'Becca', 'back', 'feathers', 'fly', 'not', 'just', 'turkey', 'loose', 'house.Pauly', 'Shore', 'full', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'mode', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'well', 'here', 'acting', 'great', 'way', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'adorable', 'Shore', 'hilarious', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'be', 'found', 'beginning', 'end', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'noticeable', 'decrease', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'one', 'viewing', 'next', 'parents', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'movie', 'was', 'kid', 'dragging', 'actually', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'friends', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'name', 'time', 'recognized', 'plot', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'around', 'asking', 'pretty', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'appeals', 'wide', 'audience', 'have', 'avoided', 'Son', 'Law', 'plague', 'just', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'stars', 'urge', 'reconsider', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",Son in Law VHS

Granted, it is prone to a bit of cheesiness, but this is what we both love and respect about Pauly Shore. Becca is a fresh from the farm in South Dakota, now in California at college and on her own for the first time. She misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she doesn't fit in. But Crawl (Pauly Shore, in perfect Pauly form) her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be. When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly, Becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn't want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to Becca. Now absolute silliness takes over and it's just so much fun from here on out. If you need something fun and funny to watch, give Son-in-Law a try.

349945,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6302994071,trebe,"[1, 1]","The differences between rural and urban lifestyles has been made the source of humor many times before.  Perhaps the peak was in the 1960's, when Paul Henning's' rural based TV programs The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-1971), Petticoat Junction (1963-1970), and Green Acres (1965-1971), drew big numbers.  The comedy Son-In-Law (1993) works both sides of the culture clash street, with Carla Gugino playing a farm girl new to college life, and Pauly Shore starring as a spacey slacker, discovering the thrills and excitement of life on the farm.Leaving her boyfriend and life on a South Dakota farm behind, Rebecca Warner (Gugino) arrives at a college in California and is immediately immersed in a whole new world.  Confused and upset, Rebecca is about to quit school and go back home, when Crawl the dorm's resident advisor, takes her under his wing, and helps her to adjust.  Rebecca cuts and colors her hair, gets a new wardrobe and her first tattoo, and enjoys time hanging at the beach.Rebecca invites Crawl to come home with her for Thanksgiving, and that's where the fun really begins.  The Warner's are slightly in shock, at their daughter's transformation, but her parents Walter (Lane Smith), Connie (Cindy Pickett), and Grandfather (Mason Adams), try to take it in stride.  Crawl's presence is unexpected, but being polite, they invite him to stay for holidays, bunking with Rebecca's obnoxious brother Zack (Patrick Renna).When Rebecca's boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier) unexpectedly pops the question in the middle of a public gathering at the local country club, Crawl comes to her rescue, saying that he already proposed, and that he and Becca are engaged.  With an unexpected future son-in-law on their hands, the Wagner's begin the process of teaching him about life on the farm.  With farm hand Theo (Dennis Burkley) as his main instructor, hilarity soon ensues, as Crawl and chores don't exactly mix.Travis turns out to be a real scumbag, as with Theo's help, he executes a scheme to put Crawl in a compromising position with Tracy (Tiffani Amber Thiessen, Saved By The Bell), another girl that Travis is involved with.  This bit of dirty low down behavior is the only thing that spoils the lighthearted tone of the film, but fortunately the situation is quickly resolved.With a goofy, good-hearted innocence, Pauly Shore puts his stamp on this type of humor, which seems to work more than it flops.  Shore mostly resists going overboard, and trying too hard to be funny.  Even if you don't like him initially, Crawl gradually wins you over with his charming brand of deadhead humor.  The dude is really more perceptive than some might give him credit for.  While the range of Shore's acting talent may not be great, in this instance it does work fairly well.  One of the warmest moments is when Crawl gives Connie a beauty makeover, which turns her husband Walter into a frisky colt.Carla Gugino kind of looks like a young Blair Brown, and has some of Brown's flighty charm.  Watching her in this, it's a little hard to picture her in tougher roles (Karen Cisco, Threshold), or as the voluptuous Lucille in Sin City (2005).  Dan Gauthier was thirty when this was made, but is able to pass for someone much younger.  Veteran actors Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, and Mason Adams, add charm and wholesomeness to the film.Son-In-Law isn't great, but it provides a few laughs without resorting to tired clich&eacute;s and trying too hard to be funny.  The movie is available in either full screen or widescreen, but the image quality is not the greatest, with a lack of sharpness in places.  Besides a trailer, there are no bonus features.",3,Pauley Shore gets a taste of farm livin'...,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,3648,"['differences', 'rural', 'urban', 'lifestyles', 'been', 'made', 'source', 'humor', 'many', 'times', 'Perhaps', 'peak', 'was', '1960', 'when', 'Paul', 'Henning', 'rural', 'based', 'TV', 'programs', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', '1962-1971', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', '1963-1970', 'Green', 'Acres', '1965-1971', 'drew', 'big', 'numbers', 'comedy', 'Son-In-Law', '1993', 'sides', 'culture', 'clash', 'street', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'playing', 'farm', 'girl', 'new', 'college', 'life', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'starring', 'spacey', 'slacker', 'discovering', 'thrills', 'excitement', 'life', 'farm.Leaving', 'boyfriend', 'life', 'South', 'Dakota', 'farm', 'behind', 'Rebecca', 'Warner', 'Gugino', 'college', 'California', 'immediately', 'immersed', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'Confused', 'upset', 'Rebecca', 'quit', 'school', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'when', 'Crawl', 'dorm', 'resident', 'advisor', 'wing', 'adjust', 'Rebecca', 'cuts', 'colors', 'hair', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'first', 'tattoo', 'enjoys', 'time', 'hanging', 'beach.Rebecca', 'Crawl', 'come', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'where', 'fun', 'really', 'Warner', 'are', 'slightly', 'shock', 'daughter', 'transformation', 'parents', 'Walter', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Connie', 'Cindy', 'Pickett', 'Grandfather', 'Mason', 'Adams', 'try', 'take', 'stride', 'Crawl', 'presence', 'unexpected', 'being', 'polite', 'invite', 'stay', 'holidays', 'bunking', 'Rebecca', 'obnoxious', 'brother', 'Zack', 'Patrick', 'Renna', '.When', 'Rebecca', 'boyfriend', 'Travis', 'Dan', 'Gauthier', 'unexpectedly', 'question', 'middle', 'public', 'gathering', 'local', 'country', 'club', 'Crawl', 'rescue', 'saying', 'already', 'proposed', 'Becca', 'are', 'engaged', 'unexpected', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'hands', 'Wagner', 'begin', 'process', 'teaching', 'life', 'farm', 'farm', 'hand', 'Theo', 'Dennis', 'Burkley', 'main', 'instructor', 'hilarity', 'soon', 'ensues', 'Crawl', 'chores', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mix.Travis', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'scumbag', 'Theo', 'help', 'scheme', 'put', 'Crawl', 'compromising', 'position', 'Tracy', 'Tiffani', 'Amber', 'Thiessen', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'girl', 'Travis', 'involved', 'bit', 'dirty', 'low', 'down', 'behavior', 'only', 'thing', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'film', 'fortunately', 'situation', 'quickly', 'resolved.With', 'goofy', 'good-hearted', 'innocence', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'stamp', 'type', 'humor', 'work', 'more', 'Shore', 'mostly', 'going', 'overboard', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'initially', 'Crawl', 'gradually', 'charming', 'brand', 'deadhead', 'humor', 'dude', 'really', 'more', 'perceptive', 'might', 'give', 'credit', 'range', 'Shore', 'acting', 'talent', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'instance', 'work', 'fairly', 'well', 'One', 'warmest', 'moments', 'when', 'Crawl', 'Connie', 'beauty', 'makeover', 'husband', 'Walter', 'frisky', 'colt.Carla', 'Gugino', 'kind', 'looks', 'young', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Brown', 'flighty', 'charm', 'Watching', 'little', 'hard', 'picture', 'tougher', 'roles', 'Karen', 'Cisco', 'Threshold', 'voluptuous', 'Lucille', 'Sin', 'City', '2005', 'Dan', 'Gauthier', 'was', 'thirty', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'able', 'pass', 'someone', 'much', 'younger', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Cindy', 'Pickett', 'Mason', 'Adams', 'add', 'charm', 'wholesomeness', 'film.Son-In-Law', ""n't"", 'great', 'few', 'laughs', 'resorting', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'movie', 'available', 'full', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'image', 'quality', 'not', 'greatest', 'lack', 'sharpness', 'places', 'trailer', 'are', 'bonus', 'features']",Son in Law VHS
