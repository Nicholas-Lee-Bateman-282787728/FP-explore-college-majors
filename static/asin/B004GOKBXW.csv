1407073,AOB5695UUUJ0,B004GOKBXW,"Anime Lover ""D""","[9, 9]","I am not going to go over what has been said before.  I thought the story was a good premise, yokai (spirit creatures) living in our world and mostly blending in.  The story of a young man being pursued by a sexy fox girl and a young wolf lass and being exposed to that world, and all the dangers and rewards that go with them (the insults and banter between Chizuru and Nazomu always livens things up).This is a HIGH level Ecchii series, so not for younger kids.  It does toe the line between Ecchi and light Hentai, and a couple of times might put a toe or two over (disc three Girls Channel about Chizuru's mother and the snow girl is a prime example)but never crosses it which is a good thing.  Now I would not call it a real harem comedy (Tenchii, Dual, and Kampfer being prime examples), since there are only 2 girls pursuing our hapless lad (well three if you count one who appears near the end but never reveals herself to him so i do not think she counts.  But the characters are full of life and actually interact well together, both mundanes and yokai (my favorite is the little frog girl).  There are some holes in the story and the ending could have been better, but overall I loved it and will keep it in my collection and watch it again if there is ever a hole in releases ,or need to have something to watch while I am on the treadmill.  The only bad thing was when i got it, the disk holder was broken and the disks were lose (but none were damaged, thankfully).Enjoy!!!!!!",4,"Not a true harem anime, but still a good one.",1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1490,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'over', 'been', 'said', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'premise', 'yokai', 'spirit', 'creatures', 'living', 'world', 'mostly', 'blending', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'pursued', 'sexy', 'fox', 'girl', 'young', 'wolf', 'lass', 'being', 'exposed', 'world', 'dangers', 'rewards', 'go', 'insults', 'banter', 'Chizuru', 'Nazomu', 'always', 'things', 'up', '.This', 'HIGH', 'level', 'Ecchii', 'series', 'not', 'younger', 'kids', 'toe', 'line', 'Ecchi', 'light', 'Hentai', 'couple', 'times', 'might', 'put', 'toe', 'two', 'disc', 'three', 'Girls', 'Channel', 'Chizuru', 'mother', 'snow', 'girl', 'prime', 'example', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'Now', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'real', 'harem', 'comedy', 'Tenchii', 'Dual', 'Kampfer', 'being', 'prime', 'examples', 'are', 'only', '2', 'girls', 'pursuing', 'hapless', 'lad', 'well', 'three', 'count', 'one', 'who', 'end', 'never', 'reveals', 'so', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'full', 'life', 'actually', 'interact', 'well', 'together', 'mundanes', 'yokai', 'favorite', 'little', 'frog', 'girl', 'are', 'holes', 'story', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'overall', 'loved', 'will', 'keep', 'collection', 'watch', 'again', 'ever', 'hole', 'releases', 'need', 'have', 'something', 'watch', 'am', 'treadmill', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'when', 'i', 'got', 'disk', 'holder', 'was', 'broken', 'disks', 'were', 'lose', 'none', 'were', 'damaged', 'thankfully', '.Enjoy']",N/A

I thought that it was going to be a bad series at first but, as i watched it the results showed that it turned out not to be as bad as I thought. My top 3 favorite episodes of the series are (1)"" Eat Deliciously."",2) ""Can you feel it?"", and (3)""We can finally do it."" because of the way it shows the love triangle plot between two girls fighting over the boy they love and finally in the end of how they compromise in sharing him in order to make their relationship work. I wish that the show had more episodes to continue of what happens after words but, its just the way it is. I love Mona Marshall and her work as an anime actress in her roles as young male characters in anime series like Izzy from the Digimon Digital Monsters series. The one question that I have about the Kanokon OVA episode specials is that does it continue where the final episode left off or, does it go off in a completely different direction? I hope that the filmmakers that made the anime series make a second season for the show if they did that would be great.

It's your typical story about a high school guy that has a couple chicks that are way out of his league hanging all over him. Kota , the main character, is kind of a short and underdeveloped kid that could pass for like 12 years old. He's a good kid, but it's hard to fathom this hot chick that's totally stacked trying to give it all to him in the music room during school hours. That's one of the things that makes anime interesting though. Kota is a new high school student who attracts the attention of a Yokai Fox girl named Chizuru. She's a ditzy girl, but she's totally loyal and devoted to Kota. Her favorite thing is nearly suffocating him inn her huge chest. Kota also gains antoher potential lover named Nozomu. Nozomu is a Yokai Wolf. She's kind of small and underdeveloped like he is. The anime is basically about the two girls competing for his attention. Anyway, the animation is great, the music is good, and there are plenty of fun magical characters that keep you wanting to know what happens next. There's not a real concrete story line, but Kanokon is a whole lot of fun from beginning to end. I recommend Kanokon and all the other animes I mentioned earlier to anyone who likes a lot of laughs and a good romantic comedy. WARNING!

1407083,A278YDAPY4OWFP,B004GOKBXW,"OKAMI ""LANDA""","[55, 56]","One of the best Harem-fan service comedies arrives in American territory, KANOKON is not your typical ""pervy"" anime it could be THE best ECCHI anime ever made, ""Xebec""( To Love-Ru, Love Hina ) made this series as enjoyable as possible, meaning you won't be bored with all the mischief going on in each episode, the characters, backgrounds, the superb and well rendered animation, light and shadow effects are as detail as something that I've ever seen before specially for this type of anime, if you are into Harem-anime then you already know that most of them have bad quality and animation.Kanokon's story revolves around Kouta , a young first-year high school student. On his first day at his new school, a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru (long black hair) asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she reveals that she is in fact a fox deity and from that day on the two hang out together. Nozomu ( blonde short hair) is a first year female student at Kouta's school, she is a wolf deity in love with Kouta, and a rival of Chizuru for Kouta's affections.The story and plot lovers will be disappointed because there's barely a story here, then again this is a HAREM COMEDY, what makes this types of shows is not about the stories is all about fan service, and this anime has lots of it BUT I'm not talking of just panty shots, this anime goes beyond any innuendo ever imagined.PROS- Price- All 12 episodes.- OVA shorts.- English and Japanese audio.- Vivid colors, fluent and beautiful animation that I'll describe it not as eye candy but as eye protein.- Each character has a unique charm ( specially the squirrel girls).- Nozomu.- The opening and ending songs fit perfectly for the series, the opening is as if it says ""wake Up"" and the ending ""go to sleep"".- surprisingly funny.- Lots of innuendo.Cons- Plot holes.- The final episode felt flat in its conclusion, because it feels more like one of those bland Drama-Slice of life anime rather than a comedy ( so if you don't want to be disappointed at the very end DON'T watch episode 12 ).If you're into Ninja Nonsense, To Love-Ru and Girls Bravo then by all means buy it you won't be disappointed.",5,Fox vs Wolf,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,2193,"['One', 'best', 'Harem-fan', 'service', 'comedies', 'American', 'territory', 'KANOKON', 'not', 'typical', 'pervy', 'anime', 'could', 'be', 'THE', 'best', 'ECCHI', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'Xebec', 'Love-Ru', 'Love', 'Hina', 'made', 'series', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'possible', 'meaning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'mischief', 'going', 'episode', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'superb', 'well', 'rendered', 'animation', 'light', 'shadow', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'detail', 'something', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'specially', 'type', 'anime', 'are', 'Harem-anime', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'most', 'have', 'bad', 'quality', 'animation.Kanokon', 'story', 'Kouta', 'young', 'first-year', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'school', 'beautiful', 'second-year', 'female', 'student', 'named', 'Chizuru', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'meet', 'alone', 'music', 'room', 'When', 'fact', 'fox', 'deity', 'day', 'two', 'hang', 'together', 'Nozomu', 'blonde', 'short', 'hair', 'first', 'year', 'female', 'student', 'Kouta', 'school', 'wolf', 'deity', 'love', 'Kouta', 'rival', 'Chizuru', 'Kouta', 'affections.The', 'story', 'plot', 'lovers', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'barely', 'story', 'here', 'then', 'again', 'HAREM', 'COMEDY', 'what', 'types', 'shows', 'not', 'stories', 'fan', 'service', 'anime', 'lots', 'BUT', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'just', 'panty', 'shots', 'anime', 'innuendo', 'ever', 'imagined.PROS-', 'Price-', '12', 'episodes.-', 'OVA', 'shorts.-', 'English', 'Japanese', 'audio.-', 'Vivid', 'colors', 'fluent', 'beautiful', 'animation', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'not', 'eye', 'candy', 'eye', 'protein.-', 'character', 'unique', 'charm', 'specially', 'squirrel', 'girls', '.-', 'Nozomu.-', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'series', 'opening', 'wake', 'Up', 'ending', 'go', 'sleep', '.-', 'surprisingly', 'funny.-', 'Lots', 'innuendo.Cons-', 'Plot', 'holes.-', 'final', 'episode', 'felt', 'flat', 'conclusion', 'more', 'one', 'bland', 'Drama-Slice', 'life', 'anime', 'rather', 'comedy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'disappointed', 'very', 'end', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'watch', 'episode', '12', '.If', ""'re"", 'Ninja', 'Nonsense', 'Love-Ru', 'Girls', 'Bravo', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
1407084,AFV2584U13XP3,B004GOKBXW,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[17, 20]","As expected with a lot of harem animes out there the standard story is you have a young cute looking high school boy Kouta Oyamada who has attracted the romantic attentions of a disguised Yokai fox girl Chizuru Minamoto who is a year ahead of him and a young disguised female wolf yokai Nozomu Ezomori and the hijinx and hilarity that happens as the both battle each other for young Kouta's heart and affection.  The series as expected with the cover does have the usual fan service like a lot of these series with the standard nudity and hentai innuendos but stops short of anything to x-rated so don't worry about this being a henatai anime.  The animation is decent it's not bad but some people might not care for it,  the voice cast for the Japanese subbed did their roles very nicely but even with some known name casts on this series the dubbed cast just sometimes seemed to fall flat as they did their character roles especially on the actress for the characters of Chizuru and Nozumu as they seemed to make their voices for their characters more subservient than they actually were especially when you listen to the subbed voices doing their roles.  The added characters like Chizuru's younger brother and others bring a nice humorous line up with the series so the entertainment for the show doesn't drop anywhere really,  and as for the extras there mostly the standard textless intro/ending songs though there are some nice short OVA's.

1407087,A1APYPEZCIHICK,B004GOKBXW,Shaun P. Michalak,"[0, 0]","First let me say that the description says only Japanese language, but the copy I got had duel language with english in there also.The other descriptions that were in here I agree with to so no sense in doubling up the same story's.another thing to add is during the show, I think that they made too drastic of changes at times to the actions of the characters and the way that they did things. to give an example, Kota in one episode is still shy and is still complaining about chizuru shoving his head into her breasts, then the next episode he does not mind it and is asking for it and most of the shyness that he has shown through the show was gone. It does the same thing later on when chizuru goes from not caring about anybody seeing her affection for kota in public and constantly grabbing at him all the sudden the aggressiveness stops and they are suddenly boyfriend and girlfriend. I think that they should have made the transitions over several episodes and not as sudden.One thing that I think that the series does need is a second season. At the end, they left a lot of questions not answered. Like there was this girl that was after kota, and she called him big brother, but they never really said if she was actually related or not. This girl also never really met face to face with kota in the show either. also, kota showed signs of intense power at the end that came from him, and the girl said soemthing about him being awakened, but there was no description about any of that either. there was just too any unanswered questions at the end that I think that they should have made a second season to answer them. The best way i can explain the way that it ended is if you ever watched Tenchi Muyo OVA series, it left unanswered questions about the same as this show. Just looking at the original 13 of tenchi that is. I have not seen the ova's yet so maybe they are answered in there. I dont know but will find out when they finally release the OVA's in a little over a month.Overall, it was a decent show and definitely worth watching. It would even be worth re-watching a second time, just dont expect a show that answers all questions because the show leaves a lot of questions at the end.",3,decent show but needs a second season,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,2211,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'description', 'only', 'Japanese', 'language', 'copy', 'got', 'had', 'duel', 'language', 'english', 'other', 'descriptions', 'were', 'here', 'agree', 'so', 'sense', 'doubling', 'up', 'same', ""story's.another"", 'thing', 'add', 'show', 'think', 'made', 'too', 'drastic', 'changes', 'times', 'actions', 'characters', 'way', 'did', 'things', 'give', 'example', 'Kota', 'one', 'episode', 'still', 'shy', 'still', 'complaining', 'chizuru', 'shoving', 'head', 'breasts', 'then', 'next', 'episode', 'not', 'mind', 'asking', 'most', 'shyness', 'shown', 'show', 'was', 'gone', 'same', 'thing', 'later', 'when', 'chizuru', 'not', 'caring', 'anybody', 'seeing', 'affection', 'kota', 'public', 'constantly', 'grabbing', 'sudden', 'aggressiveness', 'stops', 'are', 'suddenly', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'transitions', 'several', 'episodes', 'not', 'sudden.One', 'thing', 'think', 'series', 'need', 'second', 'season', 'end', 'left', 'lot', 'questions', 'not', 'answered', 'was', 'girl', 'was', 'kota', 'called', 'big', 'brother', 'never', 'really', 'said', 'was', 'actually', 'related', 'not', 'girl', 'also', 'never', 'really', 'met', 'face', 'face', 'kota', 'show', 'also', 'kota', 'showed', 'signs', 'intense', 'power', 'end', 'came', 'girl', 'said', 'soemthing', 'being', 'awakened', 'was', 'description', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'end', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'second', 'season', 'answer', 'best', 'way', 'i', 'can', 'explain', 'way', 'ended', 'ever', 'watched', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'OVA', 'series', 'left', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'same', 'show', 'Just', 'looking', 'original', '13', 'tenchi', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'ova', 'yet', 'so', 'maybe', 'are', 'answered', 'there', 'dont', 'know', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'finally', 'release', 'OVA', 'little', 'month.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'worth', 're-watching', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'dont', 'expect', 'show', 'questions', 'show', 'lot', 'questions', 'end']",N/A
