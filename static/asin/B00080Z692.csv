It is pretty well acted and beautifully filmed with lots of horses. They didn't get carried away with things the bad guy did so that it is still palatable for the squeamish. As they say, no horses were hurt during the filming of this movie. The handling of the problems the woman had in early life that led her to the path she wound up on was well handled. The little girl could be more attractive and appealing but I guess she was someone's daughter. She was certainly adequate as an actress. The lead actress could have been better. Sort of a whiney irritating voice but an attractive woman. Why do jodhpurs make all women's hips look the size of Texas. Marsha Mason lifted the movie up to a very nice level.

897334,A84HFAB5HSZEO,B00080Z692,K. A. Connelly,"[23, 35]","This movie glorifies a woman's plight in a negative sense - meaning she does over come a lot of adversity for sure and I want to appreciate that - but at the same time it was adversity of her own making.  She had some responsibility in this - but the film just makes her a innocent victim.  Of course you have to ignore that because we're going to make her into Snow White.  The portrait of the man she marries is stereotyped in this movie as a someone who is a COMPLETE loser - but she is the COMPLETE saint & heroine.  It doesn't show in great detail how she made such a poor decision in marriage, brought a child into this terrible situation [surely not her fault again] and her responsibility in all this.  It is a completely unrealistic view of marriage and 2 people [her and her unfaithful husband] - because no one can be as bad as him and no one can be as good as her; real life at close range is just very different.  And the potential sutor that starts to come into the picture at the end . . . . he's just as totally unrealistic and wimpy . . . .  He's a guy that adores her way of thinking, never disagrees with her, is totally in orbit around her life, has all the time & money in the world to just follow her around and thinks she can do no wrong.  The little girl, who wants her original Daddy in the beginning [usually true in real life] also makes a weak attempt at holding on to some sense of true values.  But we're really going to wash this movie out - so the daughter eventually realizes her Daddy a bum too.  But Mommy is going to make it all better . . . .  This poor movie washes out any family love and any redeeming love toward Daddy in the end too - along with our having to swallow 100% empathy for our Mrs Snow White.  Ignore also that Snow White pushes her way into jobs, situations and into people's lives - even the other characters are eventually going to look a her with nothing but stars in their eyes.And we want to call this a family movie???? This just teaches the viewpoint of selfishness - in a woman's sense.  Who wants to sit their family down and show them 2 people that can't grow up and keep their commitments to really being a family - and then call this a ""family movie""?  She's just as bitter and angry toward him in the end as he was toward her - but she's justified???  This type of current thinking in our culture of ""a flexable family"" with new fathers & mothers coming in and out is beyond me.  I suppose if you throw a horse in we can give up all the human values that should be present????  Maybe Lassie can run across the screen and that will save this story too????  Surely Lassie can make this a family film!Give me a Sarah - Plain and Tall - who advocates commitment and stands by her decisions - and I'll call that a family movie and something worth watching.",1,A long shot not worth watching . . .,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2819,"['movie', 'woman', 'plight', 'negative', 'sense', 'meaning', 'come', 'lot', 'adversity', 'sure', 'want', 'appreciate', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'adversity', 'own', 'making', 'had', 'responsibility', 'film', 'just', 'innocent', 'victim', 'course', 'have', 'ignore', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'Snow', 'White', 'portrait', 'man', 'stereotyped', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'COMPLETE', 'loser', 'COMPLETE', 'saint', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'show', 'great', 'detail', 'how', 'made', 'poor', 'decision', 'marriage', 'brought', 'child', 'terrible', 'situation', '[', 'surely', 'not', 'fault', 'again', ']', 'responsibility', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'view', 'marriage', '2', 'people', '[', 'unfaithful', 'husband', ']', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'real', 'life', 'close', 'range', 'just', 'very', 'different', 'potential', 'sutor', 'come', 'picture', 'end', 'just', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'wimpy', 'guy', 'way', 'thinking', 'never', 'totally', 'orbit', 'life', 'time', 'money', 'world', 'just', 'follow', 'around', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'original', 'Daddy', 'beginning', '[', 'usually', 'true', 'real', 'life', ']', 'also', 'weak', 'attempt', 'holding', 'sense', 'true', 'values', ""'re"", 'really', 'going', 'wash', 'movie', 'out', 'so', 'daughter', 'eventually', 'Daddy', 'bum', 'too', 'Mommy', 'going', 'make', 'better', 'poor', 'movie', 'washes', 'out', 'family', 'love', 'redeeming', 'love', 'Daddy', 'end', 'too', 'having', 'swallow', '100', '%', 'empathy', 'Mrs', 'Snow', 'White', 'Ignore', 'also', 'Snow', 'White', 'way', 'jobs', 'situations', 'people', 'lives', 'even', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'eventually', 'going', 'look', 'her', 'nothing', 'stars', 'eyes.And', 'want', 'call', 'family', 'movie', 'just', 'viewpoint', 'selfishness', 'woman', 'sense', 'Who', 'sit', 'family', 'show', '2', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'keep', 'commitments', 'really', 'being', 'family', 'then', 'call', 'family', 'movie', 'just', 'bitter', 'angry', 'end', 'was', 'justified', 'type', 'current', 'thinking', 'culture', 'flexable', 'family', 'new', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'coming', 'suppose', 'throw', 'horse', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'human', 'values', 'should', 'be', 'present', 'Maybe', 'Lassie', 'can', 'run', 'screen', 'will', 'save', 'story', 'too', 'Surely', 'Lassie', 'can', 'make', 'family', 'film', 'Give', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'who', 'commitment', 'stands', 'decisions', ""'ll"", 'call', 'family', 'movie', 'something', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Young Annie's sister is killed in a car accident on an errand Annie was supposed to do, so she feels her mother blames her for her sister's death. Annie feels her mother favored her sister which adds to a growing chasm between mother and daughter. Now grown, Annie, her husband, daughter, and her horse Tolo are on their way to his new job, only to be deserted by him along the way. Annie manages to show up at a stable run by Mary Lou and talks her into hiring her. We see quite a bit of dressage from both Tolo and Mary Lou's horse Red, and things go well until Annie is unable to get Tolo out of his stall and finds out from the vet he is blind in both eyes. The vet recommends having him put down but Annie rises to the challenge and slowly gets him to adjust to his condition. When the bank threatens to repossess Tolo because Annie's husband defaulted on the loan, the only way to keep him is for her to win a musical dressage competition on Red despite an earlier fall leaving her with no feeling in one of her legs. She hurdles that obstacle, but when her husband attacks Red, causing him to be withdrawn, her last resort is to compete on Tolo. With her parents and daughter, and Mary Lou and her daughter watching, she and Tolo win first prize and more than enough money to pay off the loan. Best of all, her mother, who up until now had been showcasing her departed daughter's ribbons, presents Annie with all of her ribbons framed, so mother and daughter can finally heal their relationship. A great movie, though as some pointed out there is a bit of rough language so perhaps parents want to watch the movie before allowing their children to watch.

The scenes that had the husband in them always had an foul word or two, so if children are viewing watch out.  Had those few words be edited I would have given it 5 stars.  I look for family viewing items.

I knew at that point that any hopes I had were going to be dashed to the ground. Is it always the case that Hallmark Channel movies are such trite, predictable shit as the ones I've been exposed to? Because this is my seventh or eighth (my wife's grandmother always has the Hallmark Channel on when we're over for holiday dinners), and, well, they're about as fresh and original as Dame Barbara Cartland romance novels.Plot: Annie Garrett (Saw V's Julie Benz), her husband Ross (The Net's John Livingston), and daughter Taylor (Gage Golightly, of the recent Teen Wolf TV series...my, how she's grown up!) move from Denver, Annie's childhood home, to California to seek their fortune. The farm where Ross works goes under, and he exits stage left, leaving his family in the lurch. Annie, desperate for money and a place to board her horse Tolo, ends up living, and then working, at a farm owned by gruff-but-with-a-heart-of-gold owner Mary Lou O'Brian (The Goodbye Girl's Marsha Mason, slumming it before what would seem to have been a semi-retirement in 2005) and soft-hearted assistant Guido (Le Mat, who I just saw in Grave Secrets and was about equally fond of here).  This being a Hallmark Channel movie, you can be guaranteed that things are not going to stop there, though getting into the specifics of most of the problems Annie and Tolo encounter on their road to the local dressage finals (and I'll tell you, it's a loooooooooooong way from Devon) would be spoiler territory.Not that it's not painfully predictable in the sense that you know there are roadblocks (the main one, which turns this from a simple horse story into OMGHALLMARKINSPIRATIONALMOVIE, is cleverly concealed by changing the breed of the horse--this is, it turns out, based in part on a true story; the real-life cognate of Annie Garrett has posted about her experiences as a consultant on the film at IMDB), and I can't begin to imagine it would be a spoiler alert to say that Annie, Tolo, and Taylor soldier on through (I'm reminded of a line from a much better film I watched today, The Adventures of Tintin: ""You hit a wall, you push through it."") and everything turns out all right in the end. The problem is, the folks who write Hallmark and Lifetime and (fill in the basic cable channel) Original Movies never seem to realize that it's possible for everything to turn out all right and do so in a different way than the viewer is expecting. This was screenwriter David Alexander's first time working with Hallmark, though he had previously penned oh-so-inspirational TV movies like this for CBS; their partnership has continued to this day. Do I need to watch any of David Alexander's other movies to know they're going to be just as plodding and predictable as this one? No, I don't. *",1,You should bet the favorite instead.,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,3270,"['Long', 'Shot', 'Georg', 'Stanford', 'Brown', '2004', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'caused', 'have', 'such', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'languished', 'admittedly', 'massive', 'try', 'keep', '400', 'titles', 'Netflix', 'Instant', 'Streaming', 'queue', 'well', 'year', 'actually', 'got', 'watching', 'when', 'dialed', 'up', 'tonight', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'Paul', 'le', 'Mat', 'name', 'second', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'film', 'was', 'overlaid', 'words', 'Hallmark', 'Presents', 'knew', 'point', 'hopes', 'had', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'dashed', 'ground', 'always', 'case', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'movies', 'are', 'such', 'trite', 'predictable', 'shit', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exposed', 'seventh', 'eighth', 'wife', 'grandmother', 'always', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'when', ""'re"", 'holiday', 'dinners', 'well', ""'re"", 'fresh', 'original', 'Dame', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'romance', 'novels.Plot', 'Annie', 'Garrett', 'Saw', 'V', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'husband', 'Ross', 'Net', 'John', 'Livingston', 'daughter', 'Taylor', 'Gage', 'Golightly', 'recent', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'TV', 'series', 'how', 'grown', 'up', 'move', 'Denver', 'Annie', 'childhood', 'home', 'California', 'seek', 'fortune', 'farm', 'where', 'Ross', 'stage', 'left', 'leaving', 'family', 'lurch', 'Annie', 'desperate', 'money', 'place', 'board', 'horse', 'Tolo', 'up', 'living', 'then', 'working', 'farm', 'owned', 'gruff-but-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'owner', 'Mary', 'Lou', ""O'Brian"", 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'slumming', 'what', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'semi-retirement', '2005', 'soft-hearted', 'assistant', 'Guido', 'Le', 'Mat', 'who', 'just', 'saw', 'Grave', 'Secrets', 'was', 'equally', 'fond', 'here', 'being', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'stop', 'there', 'getting', 'specifics', 'most', 'problems', 'Annie', 'Tolo', 'encounter', 'road', 'local', 'dressage', 'finals', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'loooooooooooong', 'way', 'Devon', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'not', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'sense', 'know', 'are', 'roadblocks', 'main', 'one', 'simple', 'horse', 'story', 'OMGHALLMARKINSPIRATIONALMOVIE', 'cleverly', 'concealed', 'changing', 'breed', 'horse', 'out', 'based', 'part', 'true', 'story', 'real-life', 'cognate', 'Annie', 'Garrett', 'posted', 'experiences', 'consultant', 'film', 'IMDB', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'say', 'Annie', 'Tolo', 'Taylor', 'soldier', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'line', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'watched', 'today', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'hit', 'wall', 'push', 'everything', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'problem', 'folks', 'who', 'write', 'Hallmark', 'Lifetime', 'fill', 'basic', 'cable', 'channel', 'Original', 'Movies', 'never', 'seem', 'realize', 'possible', 'everything', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'different', 'way', 'viewer', 'expecting', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Alexander', 'first', 'time', 'working', 'Hallmark', 'had', 'previously', 'penned', 'oh-so-inspirational', 'TV', 'movies', 'CBS', 'partnership', 'continued', 'day', 'Do', 'need', 'watch', 'David', 'Alexander', 'other', 'movies', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'just', 'plodding', 'predictable', 'one', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", '*']",N/A
