I keep hearing people mention that it's the kind of movie made for older women.  My response is...whatever.  As a twenty yr old who watched this film with a male friend who makes hip hop music, I can say it's a film for everyone alike.  We both felt the characters had so much depth and all were highly interesting as people.  It's enjoyable and it moves at a nice brisk pace and regardless of some people say, it's a person movie, not a female movie. You don't have to wait for girl's night out, you can watch it with anyone who likes good character development and an interesting look at life from a new angle.  Judy Davis is excellent.  The movie only suffers from the fact that time is taken up with an unnecessary love interst for Sally Field...and wastes the time they could have used giving us a more solid understanding of the final relationship Field's character and Davis' character have developed.  Ah...what they do for poignancy.",5,"Different, but deeper.",994982400,"07 13, 2001",2001,1083,"['give', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'being', 'incredible', 'film', 'being', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'films', 'made', 'today', 'keep', 'hearing', 'people', 'mention', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'older', 'women', 'response', 'whatever', 'twenty', 'yr', 'old', 'who', 'watched', 'film', 'male', 'friend', 'who', 'hip', 'hop', 'music', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'everyone', 'alike', 'felt', 'characters', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'were', 'highly', 'interesting', 'people', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'brisk', 'pace', 'regardless', 'people', 'say', 'person', 'movie', 'not', 'female', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'girl', 'night', 'out', 'can', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'interesting', 'look', 'life', 'new', 'angle', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'excellent', 'movie', 'only', 'fact', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'interst', 'Sally', 'Field', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'giving', 'more', 'solid', 'understanding', 'final', 'relationship', 'Field', 'character', 'Davis', 'character', 'have', 'developed', 'Ah', 'what', 'do', 'poignancy']",Cooler Climate VHS

The film is about a woman, whose a recent divorcee and gets a job as a housekeeper. Sally Field plays the recent divorcee and housekeeper to another well-to-do woman (played by Judy Davis), her employer and they soon begin to realize that they have more in common than differences. They're both unhappy for different reasons, but begin to develop a friendship.The basic premise of the movie is about a well-to-do divorcee, Sally Field, who realizes that sometimes life isn't always the way you intend it, but you can make the best out of a difficult situation.If you enjoy movies that are entertaining, somewhat dramatic yet inspirational, then I would highly suggest this to anyone whether you're a man or woman because everyone can learn from Sally Field's character.*(Recommned for older children and adults due to profanity and some of the adult themes such as divorce, marital infidelity being mentioned, etc.)*",5,"Entertaining, funny, and motivational",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,968,"['found', 'A', 'Cooler', 'Climate', 'be', 'delightful', 'film', 'film', 'woman', 'recent', 'divorcee', 'job', 'housekeeper', 'Sally', 'Field', 'recent', 'divorcee', 'housekeeper', 'well-to-do', 'woman', 'played', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'employer', 'soon', 'begin', 'realize', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'differences', ""'re"", 'unhappy', 'different', 'reasons', 'begin', 'develop', 'friendship.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'well-to-do', 'divorcee', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'sometimes', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'way', 'intend', 'can', 'make', 'best', 'difficult', 'situation.If', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'dramatic', 'yet', 'inspirational', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'suggest', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'man', 'woman', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'Sally', 'Field', 'character', '*', 'Recommned', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'due', 'profanity', 'adult', 'themes', 'such', 'divorce', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'being', 'mentioned', 'etc', '*']",Cooler Climate VHS
557362,A20AWXWULWTD6Z,B00004XPQH,Boyd Henson,"[0, 0]","A COOLER CLIMATE  (1999)  99 minutesOscar winning Susan Seidelman directed this engaging story that was presented on the Showtime Network. The well-written script benefits from having Judy Davis and Sally Field playing a couple of unhappy middle age women that cannot come to grips with their circumstances. Sally plays a woman who lost her husband and daughter after she was caught in a dalliance with a younger man who took her to the cleaners. Brokenhearted and just plain broke, Sally takes a job as a domestic to a bitter upper class woman (Judy Davis) who has marital problems of her own. Judy is so abrasive you wonder how Sally does not quit after the first day, but she is so desperate to be employed she decides to absorb the abuse.Both the leads look great in this one. Judy, in particular, looks lovely wearing a couple of revealing outfits. This was a terrific movie for anyone who enjoys gripping drama and great performances.

557363,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004XPQH,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 5]","This movie was produced by women, for women, about women.  It was made for Showtime and is clearly targeted at women in the 35+ age category.  It is a good character study of two women and their stormy relationship as employer and housekeeper.  Iris Prue (Sally Field) is starting a new life.  She divorced her husband and abandoned her comfortable life to seek love and fulfillment with her paramour.  Unfortunately, after she gave up everything, her new love didn't work out.  She seeks employment as a live-in housekeeper, and she is hired by Paula Tanner (Judy Davis).  Paula is an angry, rude and oppressive woman, who goes through housekeepers faster than she goes through laundry.  Iris is desperate to keep this job because she has nowhere else to go, and dutifully endures Paula's condescending abuse.Paula disaffects everyone, so it is no surprise that both her daughter and husband can't stand her.  Ultimately, her life unravels as her daughter runs away and her husband leaves her.  Iris, whom she has completely alienated, is the only person to whom she can turn for support.  The rest of the story revolves around their tempestuous relationship and eventual transformation.Director Susan Seidelman (TV's ""Sex in the City"") keeps the story interesting, deftly avoiding bogging down, as often happens in such character studies.  Certain parts are very raw and real, capturing feelings only a woman would understand.  She is especially sensitive in portraying the difficulties between mothers and daughters.  However, though meticulous at capturing the deep emotions resulting from the characters' conflict, Seidelman rushes through the resolution to the point where Paula turns into a completely different person in the span of 10 minutes of screen time.The acting was superb.  Sally Field gives a wonderful performance as the flawed and self-doubting Iris, who is determined to keep her life from disintegrating despite her foolish mistakes.  Field captures the complexities of Iris' character, a woman both desperate and proud.  As good as Field is, Judy Davis is even better.  She is arrogant, insolent and mean, but shows subtle signs that it is all to compensate for her deep-seated insecurity.  Her portrayal of Paula's depression and angry blaming of others for her own shortcomings is brilliantly done.I rated this film a 7/10.  I enjoyed it, but I was disappointed by how Seidelman ties up the ending in such a neat little package, ultimately producing characters that bear no resemblance to the imperfect people that we spent so much time getting to know.  I believe that relationships can be transforming, but this requires an absurd leap of faith.Women should see this movie with a female friend.  It is probably destined for a long run on the Lifetime Channel.  Most men won't get it, and they will probably need at least three bathroom breaks while blithely suggesting you keep the recorder running in their absence.  Save this one for girls' night out.",4,Sensitive character study for women,979516800,"01 15, 2001",2001,2980,"['movie', 'was', 'produced', 'women', 'women', 'women', 'was', 'made', 'Showtime', 'clearly', 'targeted', 'women', '35+', 'age', 'category', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'women', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'employer', 'housekeeper', 'Iris', 'Prue', 'Sally', 'Field', 'starting', 'new', 'life', 'divorced', 'husband', 'abandoned', 'comfortable', 'life', 'seek', 'love', 'fulfillment', 'paramour', 'Unfortunately', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'new', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'employment', 'live-in', 'housekeeper', 'hired', 'Paula', 'Tanner', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Paula', 'angry', 'rude', 'oppressive', 'woman', 'who', 'housekeepers', 'faster', 'laundry', 'Iris', 'desperate', 'keep', 'job', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'dutifully', 'Paula', 'condescending', 'abuse.Paula', 'disaffects', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'daughter', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Ultimately', 'life', 'unravels', 'daughter', 'away', 'husband', 'Iris', 'whom', 'completely', 'alienated', 'only', 'person', 'whom', 'can', 'turn', 'support', 'rest', 'story', 'around', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'eventual', 'transformation.Director', 'Susan', 'Seidelman', 'TV', 'Sex', 'City', 'story', 'interesting', 'deftly', 'avoiding', 'bogging', 'down', 'often', 'such', 'character', 'studies', 'Certain', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'raw', 'real', 'capturing', 'feelings', 'only', 'woman', 'would', 'understand', 'especially', 'sensitive', 'portraying', 'difficulties', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'However', 'though', 'meticulous', 'capturing', 'deep', 'emotions', 'resulting', 'characters', 'conflict', 'Seidelman', 'resolution', 'point', 'where', 'Paula', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'span', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time.The', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Sally', 'Field', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'flawed', 'self-doubting', 'Iris', 'who', 'determined', 'keep', 'life', 'disintegrating', 'foolish', 'mistakes', 'Field', 'complexities', 'Iris', 'character', 'woman', 'desperate', 'proud', 'As', 'good', 'Field', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'even', 'better', 'arrogant', 'insolent', 'mean', 'subtle', 'signs', 'compensate', 'deep-seated', 'insecurity', 'portrayal', 'Paula', 'depression', 'angry', 'blaming', 'others', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'brilliantly', 'done.I', 'rated', 'film', '7/10', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'Seidelman', 'up', 'ending', 'such', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'ultimately', 'producing', 'characters', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'imperfect', 'people', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'believe', 'relationships', 'can', 'be', 'transforming', 'absurd', 'leap', 'faith.Women', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'female', 'friend', 'probably', 'destined', 'long', 'run', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'Most', 'men', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'least', 'three', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'blithely', 'suggesting', 'keep', 'recorder', 'running', 'absence', 'Save', 'one', 'girls', 'night']",Cooler Climate VHS
