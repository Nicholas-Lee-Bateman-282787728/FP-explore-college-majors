Like the others in the series, the performances are very good with excellent singing, costumes, & sets. A Night in Venice, although the story is rather silly, has many great Strauss tunes. Unfortunately, the director seems to have gotten carried away with using photographic tricks such as distorting images etc.",4,Excellent performance but tries to be too artsie,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,420,"['series', 'operettas', 'were', 'made', 'movies', 'Unitel', 'released', 'DVD', 'DG', 'others', 'series', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'singing', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Night', 'Venice', 'story', 'rather', 'silly', 'many', 'great', 'Strauss', 'tunes', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'have', 'gotten', 'carried', 'away', 'using', 'photographic', 'tricks', 'such', 'distorting', 'images', 'etc']",N/A

It should have deserved a four star rating. My problem is in the operetta itself. I just don&#8217;t like the music. It is nothing like the other operetta that I know. It is not tuneful at all. Yet, there are very few tunes that one can remember after watching it. Those two numbers sang by the tenor were OK, but the gondola song only lasted a few bars. If I were introduced to operetta by this one first I don&#8217;t think I would have become an operetta enthusiast.",2,Not a Good Strauss Material,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,564,"['production', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'singing', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'disc', 'very', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'deserved', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'problem', 'operetta', 'just', 'don', '8217', 'music', 'nothing', 'other', 'operetta', 'know', 'not', 'tuneful', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'tunes', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'two', 'numbers', 'sang', 'tenor', 'were', 'OK', 'gondola', 'song', 'only', 'lasted', 'few', 'bars', 'were', 'introduced', 'operetta', 'one', 'first', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'operetta', 'enthusiast']",N/A
