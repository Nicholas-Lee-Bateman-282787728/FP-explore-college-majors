1095512,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000UNYJWM,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 2]","Tsk, tsk, tsk.""Who's Your Caddy?"" is a story about a peaceful community and a loud group who's about to bring the house down.  There's a very exclusive country club owned by a sexless, pompous, agitated, bigoted rich man, played by Jeffery Jones. His prestigious lifestyle got interrupted when an unwelcomed guest approached him for membership, a top-hollerin' egotistical rap star named C-Note (Big Boi).  He and his posse recently bought an estate near the country club, and all he wanted was to join, but the guy from ""Ferris Bueller"" is too white and bigoted to accept.  Once C-Note made the club president's life a living hell through extravagant and unrealstically comical means, he got the membership and decided to get crunked up with his usual flair of booze and booty-shakers.  The club president tried to stop him with a black female lawyer, but she eventually gazed her eyes on the rapper like moth to a predictable character flame. No matter how he tried to one-up the brotha, C-Note and his crew kept sabotaging him in every step of the way, which all ended in a big tournament over who owns the country club.A loud-and-obnoxious black man trying to bring down a rich whitey?  That premise sounds a lot like the material ""The Boondocks"" used as a parody, except this movie is being completely straightforward; that's not good.  It's kinda depressing that these series of asinine ebony-catering jokes could've been avoided had the club president let the rapper be a member and be at peace.  In fact, the movie established that C-Note is a college graduate, he could've persuaded the club president by intellectual means.  His crew happened to be multi-cultural with a few white people on his side, and he even helped Andy Milinokis gained confidence and be cool, so he's very open-minded with others; he even had a talented white dude as his caddy, who I have to admire for his bravery and high tolerance for all the stuff his crew had to dish out, even Faizon Love for making him sniff his finger from wherever he used it on.  I noticed Terry Crews's making his brief appearance, and he could've had more time for better laughs than anything Faizon Love's fat repulsive butt could dish out; heck, get rid of Faizon Love altogether, and this movie would get my rating of approval.The point is, ""Who's Your Caddy?"" had the potential to not suck.  But it resorted to the lowest common denomination of stereotypical black antics that almost made it close to being as bad as ""Soul Plane"".  A couple of things about the movie really bothered me, particularly the polo and golf matches.  C-Note and his gang broke plenty of rules in those games, like Faizon on foot pushing some guy off his hose and hit the ball towards the post in Polo and disturbing a golfer's concentration by yelling and blowing gas, and yet they somehow win those matches; they even stoop low as to feed their enemy's horse with illicit substances.  They're just as bad as the rich guy they're trying to bring down, and I hated how cocky and overconfident they acted for most of the movie.  I doubt this is the story Our Stories Films really wanted to make, but a quick cash-grab for its targeted demographic in order to acquire extra dough; too bad it tanked at the box-office.",2,Tiger Wept,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,3258,"['Tsk', 'tsk', 'tsk', 'Who', 'Caddy', 'story', 'peaceful', 'community', 'loud', 'group', 'who', 'bring', 'house', 'down', 'very', 'exclusive', 'country', 'club', 'owned', 'sexless', 'pompous', 'agitated', 'bigoted', 'rich', 'man', 'played', 'Jeffery', 'Jones', 'prestigious', 'lifestyle', 'got', 'interrupted', 'when', 'unwelcomed', 'guest', 'approached', 'membership', 'top-hollerin', 'egotistical', 'rap', 'star', 'named', 'C-Note', 'Big', 'Boi', 'posse', 'recently', 'bought', 'estate', 'country', 'club', 'wanted', 'was', 'join', 'guy', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'too', 'white', 'bigoted', 'accept', 'Once', 'C-Note', 'made', 'club', 'president', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'extravagant', 'unrealstically', 'comical', 'means', 'got', 'membership', 'decided', 'get', 'crunked', 'up', 'usual', 'flair', 'booze', 'booty-shakers', 'club', 'president', 'tried', 'stop', 'black', 'female', 'lawyer', 'eventually', 'gazed', 'eyes', 'rapper', 'predictable', 'character', 'flame', 'matter', 'how', 'tried', 'one-up', 'brotha', 'C-Note', 'crew', 'kept', 'sabotaging', 'step', 'way', 'ended', 'big', 'tournament', 'who', 'country', 'club.A', 'loud-and-obnoxious', 'black', 'man', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'rich', 'whitey', 'premise', 'lot', 'material', 'Boondocks', 'used', 'parody', 'movie', 'being', 'completely', 'straightforward', 'not', 'good', 'kinda', 'depressing', 'series', 'asinine', 'ebony-catering', 'jokes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avoided', 'had', 'club', 'president', 'let', 'rapper', 'be', 'member', 'be', 'peace', 'fact', 'movie', 'established', 'C-Note', 'college', 'graduate', 'could', ""'ve"", 'persuaded', 'club', 'president', 'intellectual', 'means', 'crew', 'happened', 'be', 'multi-cultural', 'few', 'white', 'people', 'side', 'even', 'helped', 'Andy', 'Milinokis', 'gained', 'confidence', 'be', 'cool', 'very', 'open-minded', 'others', 'even', 'had', 'talented', 'white', 'dude', 'caddy', 'who', 'have', 'admire', 'bravery', 'high', 'tolerance', 'stuff', 'crew', 'had', 'dish', 'out', 'even', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'making', 'sniff', 'finger', 'wherever', 'used', 'noticed', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'making', 'brief', 'appearance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'time', 'better', 'laughs', 'anything', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'fat', 'repulsive', 'butt', 'could', 'dish', 'out', 'heck', 'get', 'rid', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'altogether', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'rating', 'approval.The', 'point', 'Who', 'Caddy', 'had', 'potential', 'not', 'suck', 'resorted', 'lowest', 'common', 'denomination', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'antics', 'almost', 'made', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'couple', 'things', 'movie', 'really', 'bothered', 'particularly', 'polo', 'golf', 'matches', 'C-Note', 'gang', 'broke', 'plenty', 'rules', 'games', 'Faizon', 'foot', 'pushing', 'guy', 'hose', 'hit', 'ball', 'post', 'Polo', 'disturbing', 'golfer', 'concentration', 'yelling', 'blowing', 'gas', 'yet', 'somehow', 'win', 'matches', 'even', 'stoop', 'low', 'feed', 'enemy', 'horse', 'illicit', 'substances', ""'re"", 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'rich', 'guy', ""'re"", 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'hated', 'how', 'cocky', 'overconfident', 'acted', 'most', 'movie', 'doubt', 'story', 'Stories', 'Films', 'really', 'wanted', 'make', 'quick', 'cash-grab', 'targeted', 'demographic', 'order', 'acquire', 'extra', 'dough', 'too', 'bad', 'tanked', 'box-office']",Who's Your Caddy?

Only difference is that movie was funny and this one is flat out boring.Plot: C-Note(Big Boi of Outkast) is a rich rapper who wants to join a golf club but the snooty owner Cummings(Jeffrey Jones) refuses to let C-Note and his pals join the club. C-Note does everything in his power to piss off Cummings and later on challenges him to a golf tournament.Opinion: Doesn't that plot remind you of that movie with Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield and that silly gopher? This movie has other problems besides it being a ripoff of Caddyshack. You're sitting there waiting for a laugh and it never comes. Big Boi is not funny and the movie relies too much on fart jokes and cliches. Jeffrey Jones is overacting to the extreme just like he did in Howard The Shmuck. Sheri Shepard plays a caricature of a black woman and as a matter of fact the majority of the actors in this movie are caricatures. You know a movie is in trouble when you have Andy Milonakis in it! And the scene where Faizon  Love and the rest of those guys are baring their naked buns in the locker room is not funny, its just sick.
