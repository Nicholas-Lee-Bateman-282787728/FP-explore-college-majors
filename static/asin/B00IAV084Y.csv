Unfortunately, it seems that Porgy&#8217;s goat-driven cart has gone the way of the Dodo, as in Rattle&#8217;s version, but in every other respect this is an infinitely superior rendition of A much neglected and maligned American opera.  Afro-Americans complain about its portrait of blacks, while South Carolina has made it its state opera!  However, the music will endure forever, and no one seems to realize the Gershwins expressly stated its performers had to be black, which was anathema in 1935 in this country ((read the very informative Wikipedia article).  And by the way: that much touted 1959 version was a thorough fake, for the principals were lip-synching to other people&#8217;s singing voices.  Here you get a superb cast, a glorious production and taut conducting, plus a whole second record of extras.  I saw both the Houston and Met productions, which have not surfaced in DVD format.  Thus, this is the one to have (I loathed the Rattle travesty).",5,"AT LAST, A MASTERPIECE DULY HONORED!",1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1045,"['8220', 'operatic', '8221', 'version', 'as', 'complete', 'will', 'find', 'Unfortunately', 'Porgy', '8217', 'goat-driven', 'cart', 'gone', 'way', 'Dodo', 'Rattle', '8217', 's', 'version', 'other', 'respect', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'rendition', 'A', 'much', 'neglected', 'maligned', 'American', 'opera', 'Afro-Americans', 'complain', 'portrait', 'blacks', 'South', 'Carolina', 'made', 'state', 'opera', 'However', 'music', 'will', 'endure', 'forever', 'one', 'realize', 'Gershwins', 'expressly', 'stated', 'performers', 'had', 'be', 'black', 'was', 'anathema', '1935', 'country', 'read', 'very', 'informative', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'way', 'much', 'touted', '1959', 'version', 'was', 'thorough', 'fake', 'principals', 'were', 'lip-synching', 'other', 'people', '8217', 'singing', 'voices', 'Here', 'get', 'superb', 'cast', 'glorious', 'production', 'taut', 'conducting', 'whole', 'second', 'record', 'extras', 'saw', 'Houston', 'Met', 'productions', 'have', 'not', 'surfaced', 'DVD', 'format', 'Thus', 'one', 'have', 'loathed', 'Rattle', 'travesty']",N/A

1693886,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B00IAV084Y,I. Giles,"[13, 13]","The original version of this opera of 1935 given at Carnegie Hall extended to some four hours which was considered too long even though in every other respect it was greeted with considerable acclaim. Within ten days, when given its Broadway premier, the opera had been cut by about 45 minutes. Further cuts and replacement of sung recitatives with spoken dialogue followed leading to the 1942 Broadway stage version which has been the favoured version ever since. The result of that editing and reduction was to change the emphasis of the music from an operatic to a stage show experience.The new `operatic' version presented on this blu-ray disc was conceived in the middle 1970's and produced at the opera house in Houston. This operatic version restored much of the earlier excised material plus the sung recitatives and re-established the operatic nature of the work. It has been widely admired and appreciated and it is that version that is presented on this disc. At 158 minutes it is still far shorter the original 1935 version but has nevertheless returned to the original operatic concept.The production is `traditional' and of correct period. There has been no attempt to change the period of the opera and the stage sets are impressively realistic and of considerable scale. The orchestral playing is expert and flexibility has been incorporated to allow the required freedoms essential in the more jazz-inspired sections of the work. This freedom of musical delivery is typical of the whole vocal cast and is a considerable achievement in cross-over stylistic performance.The vocal cast is, with the exception of the white detective, African-American ethnicity as it should be and the authenticity thus achieved is comprehensively `correct' and adds immeasurably to the impact of the drama. The singing of the whole cast, both soloist and chorus, is of the highest possible standard. The key main players, Eric Owens as Porgy, Laquita Mitchell as Bess, Lester Lynch as Crown, Chauncey Packer as Sportin' Life, Karen Slack as Serena and Alteouise deVaughn as Maria offer completely convincing and compelling stage presence as the drama builds and unfolds while consistently delivering vocal performances of power and accuracy.There are four bonus documentaries - Meet the Artists; Meet the Director; Meet the Conductor; Reflections from the General Director, David Gockley - run for a total of 29 minutes and focus on the reactions and opinions of the performers and the `creative team. ' These, taken together, offer a completely enthusiastic set of reactions to the current performance that set the scene in both a helpful and informative manner as well as illustrating considerable enthusiasm across the board. These were heard first in preparation for this review. I would suggest that this would be a good approach for most purchasers however familiar they may be with Porgy and Bess.The actual recording is of a `live' performance and offers excellent camera coverage and high definition imaging throughout. There is a palpable sense of involvement achieved with the action on stage for the viewer. The sound is presented in excellent DTS-HD surround sound as well as stereo. The orchestral and vocal sound is well mixed in a believable acoustic. There are subtitles in five languages. The booklet provides good background, synopsis, track details and cast lists.I would suggest that this is a very impressive presentation of an immensely important and unique American opera. It is given a performance and recording of such quality that this may well become the new benchmark standard against which future ventures will be judged.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work! (UK review)I'm sure there are many other serious collectors, besides myself, who wait for your synopsis and opinion before spending their hard-earned money on new releases...Thank you (UK review)I'd also add to this. When you in particular review a particular CD, I pay pretty close attention. I would say the characteristics of your reviews I value the most are the detail and general sense of balance and fairness that comes across. That's a great help. Thanks for taking the time on your reviews. (US review)............................................",5,An authentic presentation of the 'operatic' version of this essential American opera.
