778348,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B0000DD77R,Craig Connell,"[2, 2]","Phil Collins gives a long seriously long concert in Berlin, Germany, on July 25, 1990, doing 24 songs! This is one of the longest one-man concert videos I've ever seen.Actually, as good as Collins' songs are, and as good a singer as he is, it's almost too much....at least for one continuous viewing. It's almost three hours of music! I was surprised all of this could fit on a VHS tape. I'm not complaining, just saying it is very hard to sit down and watch this whole thing in one viewing. After the first look, I wound up breaking it into segments, and even skipping a number of songs that didn't have as much appeal as others. Having the DVD, as opposed to the old VHS tape, makes it a lot easier to skip to another number.Like all good performers, Collins has excellent backup help, instrumentally and vocally. The lighting also is very colorful in here which definitely adds tot he view-ability of the concert. You need colors and other visual gimmicks (dry ice, in here), otherwise you're better off with just a CD. Phil, to his credit, is pretty animated, too, which also helps. He is so self-assured that feels comfortable with the huge crowd, even though he doesn't speak their language. (He has to read his German from a sheet of paper.)Anywhile, like Rod Stewart and others with unlimited energy, Phil just keeps going and going. Although some songs sound very similar, it's still very good, solid music and entertainment. You sure get your money's worth!""",4,Collins Gives You A Lot Of Bang For Your Buck,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1468,"['Phil', 'Collins', 'long', 'seriously', 'long', 'concert', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'July', '25', '1990', 'doing', '24', 'songs', 'one', 'longest', 'one-man', 'concert', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Actually', 'as', 'good', 'Collins', 'songs', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'singer', 'almost', 'too', 'much', '.at', 'least', 'one', 'continuous', 'viewing', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'music', 'was', 'surprised', 'could', 'fit', 'VHS', 'tape', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'just', 'saying', 'very', 'hard', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'one', 'viewing', 'first', 'look', 'wound', 'up', 'breaking', 'segments', 'even', 'skipping', 'number', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'appeal', 'others', 'Having', 'DVD', 'opposed', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'lot', 'easier', 'skip', 'good', 'performers', 'Collins', 'excellent', 'backup', 'help', 'instrumentally', 'vocally', 'lighting', 'also', 'very', 'colorful', 'here', 'definitely', 'tot', 'view-ability', 'concert', 'need', 'colors', 'other', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'dry', 'ice', 'here', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'just', 'CD', 'Phil', 'credit', 'pretty', 'animated', 'too', 'also', 'so', 'self-assured', 'feels', 'comfortable', 'huge', 'crowd', 'even', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language', 'read', 'German', 'sheet', 'paper', 'Anywhile', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'others', 'unlimited', 'energy', 'Phil', 'just', 'going', 'going', 'songs', 'sound', 'very', 'similar', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'solid', 'music', 'entertainment', 'sure', 'get', 'money', 'worth']",Phil Collins: Serious Hits....Live!

778351,A1GZXVLCYY3LFI,B0000DD77R,"Kasper Michelsen ""Alcibiades""","[9, 10]","Giving the full concert, these DVDs offer plenty of evidence for why Phil Collins must be considered one of the greatest entertainers and performers of the 80's and 90's. No less than 25 songs a featured in the set, hits as well as favorites from his new album, and even though there are a few missers and missings, this should offer anyone plenty of 80's nostalgia.The performance is excellent without being Phil's best. I would at anytime recommand the Live And Loose In Paris DVD instead of this one - which is in fact probably his best live performance ever - but this doesn't meen that this concert isn't thoroughly enjoyable. In fact the performance of Take Me Home alone might be worth the purchase of the whole set, if you're into Phil's music - this traci brings new meening to the terms a-m-a-z-i-n-g and p-e-r-f-e-c-t. Must-see, must-hear, must-own. Other highlights include a wonderful versions of Do You Remember?, Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore? and A Groovy Kind Of Love. Also, seing the 16.000 people of the crowd waving their hands in unison to the beat of Two Hearts is very impressing.There are some drawbacks on this DVD. First of all, the sound is a bit sharp and metallic, even though this isn't as bad as on the CD release. On the visual side, the band is wearing some hideous dresses. Yes, I know, this is unimportant for the concert, but singer (?) Fred White is wearing a costume so lacking anything remote to good taste that I have to turn away from the screen everytime he's on (furthermore, he sounds most of all like a whorse crow). Also, the horn section Phil brought with him on this tour is not nearly as good as the one he used on the Dance Into The Light tour, as featured on the 1997 Live And Loose In Paris.Finally, a note on the set-list. Pretty much all the hits are plyed here, but it's a pitty that songs like I Wish It Would Raing Down and Find A Way To My Heart were removed from the setlist at this part of the tour. Instead a pointless piese like Saturday Night And Sunday Morning was played. Also one might miss older favorites like I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me and You Know What I Meen - but then, the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and more than 2 hours of music is pretty impressive.",5,Not his best but still fantastic.,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,2262,"['Giving', 'full', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'offer', 'plenty', 'evidence', 'why', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'entertainers', 'performers', '80', '90', 'less', '25', 'songs', 'featured', 'set', 'hits', 'as', 'well', 'favorites', 'new', 'album', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'missers', 'missings', 'should', 'offer', 'anyone', 'plenty', '80', 'nostalgia.The', 'performance', 'excellent', 'being', 'Phil', 'best', 'would', 'anytime', 'recommand', 'Live', 'Loose', 'Paris', 'DVD', 'instead', 'one', 'fact', 'probably', 'best', 'live', 'performance', 'ever', ""n't"", 'meen', 'concert', ""n't"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'performance', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'alone', 'might', 'be', 'purchase', 'whole', 'set', ""'re"", 'Phil', 'music', 'traci', 'new', 'meening', 'terms', 'a-m-a-z-i-n-g', 'p-e-r-f-e-c-t.', 'Must-see', 'must-hear', 'must-own', 'Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'wonderful', 'versions', 'Do', 'Remember', ""n't"", 'Anybody', 'Stay', 'Together', 'Anymore', 'A', 'Groovy', 'Kind', 'Love', 'Also', 'seing', '16.000', 'people', 'crowd', 'waving', 'hands', 'unison', 'beat', 'Two', 'Hearts', 'very', 'impressing.There', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'DVD', 'First', 'all', 'sound', 'bit', 'sharp', 'metallic', 'even', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'CD', 'release', 'visual', 'side', 'band', 'wearing', 'hideous', 'dresses', 'Yes', 'know', 'unimportant', 'concert', 'singer', 'Fred', 'White', 'wearing', 'costume', 'so', 'lacking', 'anything', 'remote', 'good', 'taste', 'have', 'turn', 'away', 'screen', 'everytime', 'furthermore', 'most', 'whorse', 'crow', 'Also', 'horn', 'section', 'Phil', 'brought', 'tour', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'used', 'Dance', 'Into', 'Light', 'tour', 'featured', '1997', 'Live', 'Loose', 'Paris.Finally', 'note', 'set-list', 'Pretty', 'much', 'hits', 'are', 'plyed', 'here', 'pitty', 'Wish', 'Would', 'Raing', 'Down', 'Find', 'A', 'Way', 'My', 'Heart', 'were', 'removed', 'setlist', 'part', 'tour', 'Instead', 'pointless', 'piese', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'was', 'played', 'Also', 'one', 'might', 'miss', 'older', 'favorites', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Care', 'Anymore', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Matter', 'Me', 'Know', 'What', 'Meen', 'then', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'drawn', 'somewhere', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'music', 'pretty', 'impressive']",Phil Collins: Serious Hits....Live!

778353,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B0000DD77R,M. Fields,"[24, 24]","Finally, this great concert is released on dvd.  I have the vhs and I've played it to death.  This concert never gets old or boring.  I put it on so I can listen to it while doing housework but I always end up sitting and watching it or just dancing all around the house.  It's a joy to hear a real musician play real music instead of all that sampled stuff that's out today.There is no lip synching or canned music here.  Phil and the band give an all out performance.  So much so that you can see how tired he is as the show is coming to an end and he sits down on stage to finish his last song.  You don't want to miss the drum duet by Phil and Chester.  It's one of the high points in the concert.  This dvd is a must have even if you've never heard of Phil Collins.The only quibble I have is the performance of ""You can't hurry Love"".  I can do without it but you may love it.  Even so, it's great to hear an artist that sounds as good out of the studio as he does in the studio.  While Phil is no Mario Lanza, he can sing and he has good pitch.  As I stated earlier, he and his band are a bunch of real musicians.  The sound quailty is excellent.  I was shocked at how good it sounded through my stereo.  Sometimes, live concerts can sound a bit fuzzy.  The camera work is excellent as well.  Editing is smooth and captures the feel and the excitement of being there.  You'll feel like you were there.Please treat yourself to this dvd.

778354,ADK6XWZTNAOE,B0000DD77R,newtonbosswell,"[10, 12]","I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  From the moment it fires up; it is obvious that this is a VHS transfer.  The Warner logo is grainy and stands in stark contrast to the DVD menu (circa 2003).  The colors are a bit muted and don't have that resolute quality we are used to with DVD transfers.  Then throughout the DVD there are tracking issues with the video (most glaring is In the Air Tonight).With that said, the performance is outstanding.  This is a big band and it is very cool to see a live horns section and very talented back-up singers.  Chester and Daryl are in fine form as always.  The sound is pretty decent, though a bit tinny.  The drums and guitar do sound very good; it's just the bottom end that is lacking.So it's a bit of a toss up.  The performance is great, but there was not great care in restoring this concert.  Sure, it's 13 years old, but I just watched the Zepplin DVD (which is at least twice as old) and it is wonderfully restored.

778361,A39KES33IH1GXR,B0000DD77R,Spike Spiegel,"[10, 17]","I own both the Paris DVD and the Berlin DVD.  Played both on my IBM ThinkPad T30 (with SHURE professional earbud) and my Nakamichi DVD Player (with Boston Acoutic speakers and later tried on QUAD Electro Magnetic Earphones).  The Berlin DVD sound reproduction is poor.  Case in point, the Berlin DVD shows the volume and clarity of the music with strong degree of volality throughout the concert, as if there were technical problems during recording. The problem is not salient if you listen to this DVD on a boombox type of player but its weakness was totally exposed when you play on a more demanding system. Initially, I thought it was a random product defect of my DVD and returned to the shop for an exchange but the problem persists thus I determine this is a universal problem.It is disappointing as the Berlin concert certainly has better energy and song selections than the Paris concert however, it was totally ruined by the acoustic quality.  If you are an audiophile, between the two, I advise you buy the Paris concert, much better acoustic reproduction. If you just listen to this on your low end laptop or low end DVD player with sound reproduction from the speakers on your TV, buy this one.",2,"Concert good, Acoustic Reproduction poor..",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,1207,"['own', 'Paris', 'DVD', 'Berlin', 'DVD', 'Played', 'IBM', 'ThinkPad', 'T30', 'SHURE', 'professional', 'earbud', 'Nakamichi', 'DVD', 'Player', 'Boston', 'Acoutic', 'speakers', 'later', 'tried', 'QUAD', 'Electro', 'Magnetic', 'Earphones', 'Berlin', 'DVD', 'sound', 'reproduction', 'poor', 'Case', 'point', 'Berlin', 'DVD', 'volume', 'clarity', 'music', 'strong', 'degree', 'volality', 'concert', 'were', 'technical', 'problems', 'recording', 'problem', 'not', 'salient', 'listen', 'DVD', 'boombox', 'type', 'player', 'weakness', 'was', 'totally', 'exposed', 'when', 'play', 'more', 'demanding', 'system', 'Initially', 'thought', 'was', 'random', 'product', 'defect', 'DVD', 'returned', 'shop', 'exchange', 'problem', 'thus', 'determine', 'universal', 'problem.It', 'disappointing', 'Berlin', 'concert', 'certainly', 'better', 'energy', 'song', 'selections', 'Paris', 'concert', 'however', 'was', 'totally', 'ruined', 'acoustic', 'quality', 'are', 'audiophile', 'two', 'advise', 'buy', 'Paris', 'concert', 'much', 'better', 'acoustic', 'reproduction', 'just', 'listen', 'low', 'end', 'laptop', 'low', 'end', 'DVD', 'player', 'sound', 'reproduction', 'speakers', 'TV', 'buy', 'one']",Phil Collins: Serious Hits....Live!
778362,AJSK0W7KQ19G1,B0000DD77R,steve,"[0, 0]","Finally on dvd, this concert is Phil at his best. Although I prefer Genesis over his solo stuff, this show is really amazing and full of energy. The cd only had 13 songs on it, but the dvd version has the entire 2 hour and 44 minute show. There's only one part in between In The Air Tonight and You Can't Hurry Love where it was abviouly edited. They didn't hide it very well.The sound quality is a little raw, but definitely not enough to make the dvd sound bad. Phil's drums are definitely more raw than Chester's. The video editing is perfect. The way ALL live dvds should be. The camera angles do not change every half second like a lot of live concert dvd's these days. It lets you focus on whatever is being shown and makes it a lot easier to watch.The song selection is okay, but like I said. I'm not as big of a fan of his solo work. All his solo hits are played, as well of plenty less known songs, which a lot of those are good. Although I can't believe they didn't play &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; from the album they were touring for at the time.This is the last thing Phil Collins released before he sucked. Everything that came out after this is basically horrible. So I recommend this dvd to mark his last great achievement. (although I have not seen the Live And Loose In Paris dvd)",5,Great show,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,1308,"['Finally', 'dvd', 'concert', 'Phil', 'best', 'prefer', 'Genesis', 'solo', 'stuff', 'show', 'really', 'amazing', 'full', 'energy', 'cd', 'only', 'had', '13', 'songs', 'dvd', 'version', 'entire', '2', 'hour', '44', 'minute', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hurry', 'Love', 'where', 'was', 'abviouly', 'edited', 'did', ""n't"", 'hide', 'very', 'well.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'little', 'raw', 'definitely', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'dvd', 'sound', 'bad', 'Phil', 'drums', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'raw', 'Chester', 'video', 'editing', 'perfect', 'way', 'ALL', 'live', 'dvds', 'should', 'be', 'camera', 'angles', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'half', 'second', 'lot', 'live', 'concert', 'dvd', 'days', 'focus', 'being', 'shown', 'lot', 'easier', 'watch.The', 'song', 'selection', 'okay', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'solo', 'work', 'solo', 'hits', 'are', 'played', 'well', 'plenty', 'known', 'songs', 'lot', 'are', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'quot', 'Wish', 'Would', 'Rain', 'Down', 'quot', 'album', 'were', 'touring', 'time.This', 'last', 'thing', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'released', 'sucked', 'Everything', 'came', 'out', 'basically', 'horrible', 'So', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'mark', 'last', 'great', 'achievement', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Live', 'Loose', 'Paris', 'dvd']",Phil Collins: Serious Hits....Live!
