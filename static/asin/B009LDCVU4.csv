This season, I guess they wanted better ratings so they added in a serial killer and have been making it all about bad guys trying to use the children for their greedy or evil purposes.  The father started out as almost the opposite of Jack Bauer of 24 (hated guns etc.).  Now J Baum is a crack shot and is able to beat people up (always in self-defense, of course).  It's starting to improve as we get toward the end of the season but it is like most shows now, just with a &#34;supernatural&#34; twist instead of being unique and wonderful.  EVERY episode of the first season made me cry (in a good way).  Every episode was about heroism and beauty.  Now, it's much like the rest of the other dreck on tv but still a bit better because it has some of the original elements in it.  I hope they have a season 3 and I hope they redeem the show.",4,Not as good as the first season,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,960,"['first', 'season', 'Touch', 'was', 'revelation', 'violence', 'was', 'minimal', 'story', 'was', 'connection', 'oneness', 'season', 'guess', 'wanted', 'better', 'ratings', 'added', 'serial', 'killer', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'bad', 'guys', 'trying', 'use', 'children', 'greedy', 'evil', 'purposes', 'father', 'started', 'out', 'almost', 'opposite', 'Jack', 'Bauer', '24', 'hated', 'guns', 'etc.', 'Now', 'J', 'Baum', 'crack', 'shot', 'able', 'beat', 'people', 'up', 'always', 'self-defense', 'course', 'starting', 'improve', 'get', 'end', 'season', 'most', 'shows', 'now', 'just', '34', 'supernatural', '34', 'twist', 'instead', 'being', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'made', 'cry', 'good', 'way', 'episode', 'was', 'heroism', 'beauty', 'Now', 'much', 'rest', 'other', 'dreck', 'tv', 'still', 'bit', 'better', 'original', 'elements', 'hope', 'have', 'season', '3', 'hope', 'redeem', 'show']",N/A

1597941,A3UPCYOO9LU726,B009LDCVU4,"Weinroth ""Music seeker""","[7, 7]","We watched the first season of Touch, becoming fans of the plot.  The &#34;harmonic convergence&#34; of stories based on an understanding of universal order, creating simultaneous lessening of psychic pain all over the world was an enthralling concept.  We had some questions about  Kiefer Sutherland's script - when would it be more than calling, &#34;Jake!  Jake!&#34;.  And we wondered how the parent of such a miracle child could keep leaving him on others' doorsteps in order to go on quests created by that child's needs.  But overall, it was at least a 5 star idea in a 4 star package.  And the possibilities were sure to keep the series going for quite some time.This season is different, sadly.  Did they make the mistake of getting new writers?  Or are we going back to &#34;Heroes&#34;?  Instead of a plot/homage to ideas like &#34;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close&#34;, we are back in shoot-em-up and cloak and dagger themes where Jake is conveniently out of the picture - either at school (who would have thought it) or sitting at a computer in a newspaper office.  Granted, that takes Sutherland away from, &#34;Jake! Jake!&#34;  But it also takes away the magnetic power of the first season.  The tension is still often very well done.  The trouble is, that's about all there is now.",3,Disappointed!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,1301,"['watched', 'first', 'season', 'Touch', 'becoming', 'fans', 'plot', '34', 'harmonic', 'convergence', '34', 'stories', 'based', 'understanding', 'universal', 'order', 'creating', 'simultaneous', 'lessening', 'psychic', 'pain', 'world', 'was', 'enthralling', 'concept', 'had', 'questions', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'script', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'calling', '34', 'Jake', 'Jake', '34', 'wondered', 'how', 'parent', 'miracle', 'child', 'could', 'keep', 'leaving', 'others', 'doorsteps', 'order', 'go', 'quests', 'created', 'child', 'needs', 'overall', 'was', 'least', '5', 'star', 'idea', '4', 'star', 'package', 'possibilities', 'were', 'sure', 'keep', 'series', 'going', 'quite', 'time.This', 'season', 'different', 'sadly', 'Did', 'make', 'mistake', 'getting', 'new', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'back', '34', 'Heroes', '34', 'Instead', 'plot/homage', 'ideas', '34', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', '34', 'are', 'back', 'shoot-em-up', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'themes', 'where', 'Jake', 'conveniently', 'picture', 'school', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'sitting', 'computer', 'newspaper', 'office', 'Granted', 'Sutherland', 'away', '34', 'Jake', 'Jake', '34', 'also', 'away', 'magnetic', 'power', 'first', 'season', 'tension', 'still', 'often', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'trouble', 'now']",N/A

My one question is who on earth at Amazon is writing the episode descriptions? They're terrible! But the show is intelligent and suspenseful.I do wish someone would buy Lucy a comb. And maybe some nice scrunchies.,4,Out of the ordinary,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,321,"[""'m"", 'enjoying', 'series', 'lot', 'vast', 'change', 'pace', 'so', 'much', 'nonsense', 'being', 'churned', 'out', 'today', 'one', 'question', 'who', 'earth', 'Amazon', 'writing', 'episode', 'descriptions', ""'re"", 'terrible', 'show', 'intelligent', 'suspenseful.I', 'do', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'buy', 'Lucy', 'comb', 'maybe', 'nice', 'scrunchies']",N/A
