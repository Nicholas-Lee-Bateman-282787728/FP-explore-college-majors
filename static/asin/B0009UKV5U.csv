913155,AK9AIU1HREZIW,B0009UKV5U,Doug johnston,"[2, 4]","The Star / Zvezda is a good movie to watch and believable action scenes.  Equipment and most uniforms used was somewhat accurate to period.  Not really worth the full price of a DVD in my opinion though.  I would've been happier to have rented this for less than $5.  Kind of a Russian version of Saints and Soldiers, but with a different plot.  Didn't demonize the Germans as much which was good as most Russian made movies about WW2 do that quite often.  Let's not forget how many of his own people Stalin killed and that he also invaded parts of Poland.",3,The Star / Zvezda,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,556,"['Star', '/', 'Zvezda', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'believable', 'action', 'scenes', 'Equipment', 'most', 'uniforms', 'used', 'was', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'period', 'Not', 'really', 'full', 'price', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'happier', 'have', 'rented', 'less', '5', 'Kind', 'Russian', 'version', 'Saints', 'Soldiers', 'different', 'plot', 'Did', ""n't"", 'demonize', 'Germans', 'much', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'Russian', 'made', 'movies', 'WW2', 'do', 'quite', 'often', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'how', 'many', 'own', 'people', 'Stalin', 'killed', 'also', 'invaded', 'parts', 'Poland']",The Star / Zvezda
913156,A2NOSVWQTG2ZE4,B0009UKV5U,"Extraordinary Gent. ""&#34;callous socio-path&...","[1, 2]","Brilliant portrayal of a reconaissance mission behind German lines by a group of elite scouts (The Star) during the later stages of the German/Russian war of 1941-45 when said Germans were preparing for a major offensive. The realism is at least on a par with anything produced by Hollywood. No English language, but that has its benefits as quite often English translations are in a 'flat monotone' without much emotion, inflection or passion, see my review of 'They Fought for Their Country'. Sub-titles are quite sufficient to enable the non-Russian speaker to follow the story line, and in this movie they are quite accurate translations, unlike those of some Russian movies where sub-titles are frequently just nonsense, see my review of Dostoyevsky's 'Idiot'.

913157,A2FWL734BXVJ8,B0009UKV5U,Keith Schur,"[1, 3]","Being a fan of military films, I found this movie to have a novel story idea, but poor in execution.  The cinematography was jerky and took me out of my ""suspension of belief"" when watching the film.  I also found the dialog to be very simple and the characters are really just sketches with little depth.  The viewer never really gets to know what is inside the the members of the scout squad; they are just tools for the action sequences.  On the plus side, I did enjoy seeing how the scouts operate behind enemy lines, gathering intelligence.  Overall, I would have to say I was a little dissapointed and am surprised how immature the craft of the Russian film is compared to U.S. or European equivalents.",3,Interesting concept but poor cinematography and weak dialog,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,708,"['Being', 'fan', 'military', 'films', 'found', 'movie', 'have', 'novel', 'story', 'idea', 'poor', 'execution', 'cinematography', 'was', 'jerky', 'took', 'suspension', 'belief', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'also', 'found', 'dialog', 'be', 'very', 'simple', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'sketches', 'little', 'depth', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'members', 'scout', 'squad', 'are', 'just', 'tools', 'action', 'sequences', 'plus', 'side', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'scouts', 'operate', 'enemy', 'lines', 'gathering', 'intelligence', 'Overall', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'immature', 'craft', 'Russian', 'film', 'compared', 'U.S.', 'European', 'equivalents']",The Star / Zvezda

913159,AYKN84MIK63TP,B0009UKV5U,M. Hughes,"[3, 3]","This is a really nice film. Great production values. Good acting. Good casting, in that the actors seem appropriate to their roles, and appear to be the appropriate age. Too often the actors cast as soldiers in war films are too old - and that always bugs me. I will also add that, generally, it is a good story without being too campy. There is a love interest thing going on, but fortunately they do not waste too much time on that and generally use it as a device to build some tension. Based on a true story - there is some artistic license taken - as nothing is known for sure what ultimately happened to this group of scouts, other than what was written in German reports and what was relayed via radio back to their comrades with their unit in the Red Army. A million stories or more like this from World War Two and it is nice to have a few from the Russian point of view, especially some that should appeal to Western audiences - and I mean that in terms of the quality of the actual production and the story. I have a number of Russian films made about the Great Patriotic War (WW2) and this is certainly among the best.

913160,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B0009UKV5U,Nachtjager,"[10, 10]","The Star took me very much by surprise.  Most Russian films I've seen on WWII seem to come off campy and overly patriotic - in a Soviet/Communist sort of way.  Not so here.  This is a straightforward story of a Russian squad and their harrowing experiences behind German lines - it's a superb movie, very well acted, good story line, and there's nothing dopey or of a propaganda nature in this one.My major points for this movie come in its extraordinary use of accurate equipment, uniforms, and weapons.  I'm crazy about accuracy in historical movies, and these guys nailed down every little detail beautifully.  If there's any gripe, and it would be minor, it's that the soldiers on both sides are a little too clean and a little too well groomed at times, but that's literally splitting hairs here.  If you're fanatical about equipment in war movies, The Star makes extensive use of correct Studebaker 6x6 trucks (a lot of them) more T-34 tanks than I think I've seen in any recent production (at least a dozen of them if not more) Jeeps, correct artillery pieces, you name it.  The attention to detail on the German side is equally good with at least three or four custom-built Tiger tanks that are much better looking than the ones in Saving Private Ryan.  The German weapons and uniforms are top drawer, and as others have stated, the Germans speak German, the Russians speak Russian, and the subtitles do all the work.This is an outstanding movie - wish there were more out there like this one.  I HIGHLY recommend this one to any history buff with an interest in the war on the Russian front.",5,Perhaps the best Russian WWII movie ever?

913161,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B0009UKV5U,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 6]","THE STAR (2002) Directed by Nikolay Lebedev.Starring several pretty impressive Russian actors.Set in the summer of 1944 in Belorussia during what appears to be theeve of Operation Bagration--the supposed Communist Russian offensive tosupport the Allied Invasion of Normandy though the Reds did not launchit until June 22 well after the June 6th invasion had already beendecided--thus placing the story somewhere around June 19-21?--a smallRussian reconnaissance squad is sent behind German lines to ascertaintheir troop deployments only to discover that the Germans are planninga massive counter-offensive presumably designed to blunt or even cancelBagration.Now with no radio and with the Germans hot on their trail, the quicklydwindling patrol must somehow warn the Red Army of the coming threat!Making films especially war films set during the era of CommunistRussia has its own set of problems since Communism is a genocidal evilof tremendous magnitude and to portray such a horror in a positivelight undercuts the intentions of the artist in seismic ways. Theusual technigue is simply to decommunize the story. American Liberalfilmmakers are past masters of this. The Russians are finally learninghow.Thus we have this film set in Communist Russia in 1944 where there isnary a communist word nor deed. No mass murders. No NKVD. No mass rapesof women by the Red Army. And even no Stalin. Only the ""Commander inChief in Moscow.""And it works acceptably.The old patrol behind enemy lines discovers an upcoming enemy attackand must warn his army is a plot as old as D. W. Griffith's Civil Warfilms and perfectly servicable here allowing an interesting, excitingand visually impressive dramatization of Bagration and the tactics ofRed Army scouts. Finally free of the Party stranglehood on the Arts,the film is allowed to show the Germans---not as the stumbling boobs ofso many Communist era films---but as the professional dangerousopponents they were. The battle scenes--coherent and sanely edited--are very nice. Except for some CGI planes, the equipment and vehiclesare a WW2 buffs joy and the script, direction and acting are truly fine.The result is a superb WW 2 film---one of the best of the lastdecade--and one with the always desirable advantage of dramatizingsomething that has not been dramatized before....or at least not in theWest.Highly recommended.",4,Highly satisfactory film about the Eastern Front and without the usual falsehoods!!!,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2364,"['STAR', '2002', 'Directed', 'Nikolay', 'Lebedev.Starring', 'several', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Russian', 'actors.Set', 'summer', '1944', 'Belorussia', 'what', 'be', 'theeve', 'Operation', 'Bagration', 'supposed', 'Communist', 'Russian', 'offensive', 'tosupport', 'Allied', 'Invasion', 'Normandy', 'Reds', 'did', 'not', 'launchit', 'June', '22', 'well', 'June', '6th', 'invasion', 'had', 'already', 'beendecided', 'thus', 'placing', 'story', 'somewhere', 'June', '19-21', 'smallRussian', 'reconnaissance', 'squad', 'sent', 'German', 'lines', 'ascertaintheir', 'troop', 'deployments', 'only', 'discover', 'Germans', 'are', 'planninga', 'massive', 'counter-offensive', 'presumably', 'designed', 'blunt', 'even', 'cancelBagration.Now', 'radio', 'Germans', 'hot', 'trail', 'quicklydwindling', 'patrol', 'must', 'somehow', 'Red', 'Army', 'coming', 'threat', 'Making', 'films', 'especially', 'war', 'films', 'set', 'era', 'CommunistRussia', 'own', 'set', 'problems', 'Communism', 'genocidal', 'evilof', 'tremendous', 'magnitude', 'portray', 'horror', 'positivelight', 'intentions', 'artist', 'seismic', 'ways', 'Theusual', 'technigue', 'simply', 'decommunize', 'story', 'American', 'Liberalfilmmakers', 'are', 'past', 'masters', 'Russians', 'are', 'finally', 'learninghow.Thus', 'have', 'film', 'set', 'Communist', 'Russia', '1944', 'where', 'communist', 'word', 'deed', 'mass', 'murders', 'NKVD', 'No', 'mass', 'rapesof', 'women', 'Red', 'Army', 'even', 'Stalin', 'Only', 'Commander', 'inChief', 'Moscow', 'acceptably.The', 'old', 'patrol', 'enemy', 'lines', 'upcoming', 'enemy', 'attackand', 'must', 'warn', 'army', 'plot', 'as', 'old', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'Civil', 'Warfilms', 'perfectly', 'servicable', 'here', 'allowing', 'interesting', 'excitingand', 'visually', 'impressive', 'dramatization', 'Bagration', 'tactics', 'ofRed', 'Army', 'scouts', 'Finally', 'free', 'Party', 'stranglehood', 'Arts', 'film', 'allowed', 'show', 'Germans', 'stumbling', 'boobs', 'ofso', 'many', 'Communist', 'era', 'films', 'professional', 'dangerousopponents', 'were', 'battle', 'scenes', 'coherent', 'sanely', 'edited', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'CGI', 'planes', 'equipment', 'vehiclesare', 'WW2', 'buffs', 'joy', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'truly', 'fine.The', 'result', 'superb', 'WW', '2', 'film', '-one', 'best', 'lastdecade', 'one', 'always', 'desirable', 'advantage', 'dramatizingsomething', 'not', 'been', 'dramatized', '.or', 'least', 'not', 'theWest.Highly', 'recommended']",The Star / Zvezda
