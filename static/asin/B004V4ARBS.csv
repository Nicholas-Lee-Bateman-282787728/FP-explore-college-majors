Positive family values are presented as the standard although there is an unsolved mystery about the daughter, Mia played by Ali Faulkner. The story moves along at an acceptable pace and the acting ranges from adequate to good.The overall ambience provides the feeling of Central Texas life and customs in an entertaining way. I've lived in Central Texas and a lot of the scenes and situations rang true to my experience there. The story takes some twists and turns and offers some surprises as well; all told it is a pleasant evening's entertainment.Although there is one rather intense scene I generally recommend the movie for the entire family.",4,Surprisingly Good Representation of Central Texas Life,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,696,"['movie', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'Positive', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'presented', 'standard', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'daughter', 'Mia', 'played', 'Ali', 'Faulkner', 'story', 'along', 'acceptable', 'pace', 'acting', 'ranges', 'adequate', 'good.The', 'overall', 'ambience', 'feeling', 'Central', 'Texas', 'life', 'customs', 'entertaining', 'way', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Central', 'Texas', 'lot', 'scenes', 'situations', 'rang', 'true', 'experience', 'there', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'well', 'told', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'entertainment.Although', 'one', 'rather', 'intense', 'scene', 'generally', 'recommend', 'movie', 'entire', 'family']",Secret at Arrow Lake

The critics here who point out the poor acting need to read Teddy Roosevelt's quote on criticism. There are films with bad acting where it is obvious that the people are acting and not playing a role naturally - but this one showed no signs of that. One of my favorite actresses GiGi Erneta only had a small role in this. Ali Faulkner is a rising star. The adult leads were good. I'm glad I didn't take the advice of reviewers who recommended I not waste my time on it. It is not really Christian in nature so if you're looking only for movies that have a message of eternal life, this one won't fit the bill.",4,Unique plot,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,729,"['have', 'be', 'careful', 'here', 'not', 'play', 'spoiler', 'role', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'plot', 'found', 'interesting', 'critics', 'here', 'who', 'point', 'out', 'poor', 'acting', 'need', 'read', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'quote', 'criticism', 'are', 'films', 'bad', 'acting', 'where', 'obvious', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'not', 'playing', 'role', 'naturally', 'one', 'showed', 'signs', 'One', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'GiGi', 'Erneta', 'only', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'Ali', 'Faulkner', 'rising', 'star', 'adult', 'leads', 'were', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'advice', 'reviewers', 'who', 'recommended', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'Christian', 'nature', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'only', 'movies', 'have', 'message', 'eternal', 'life', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bill']",Secret at Arrow Lake
