At times, you may have to stop the movie to regain your composure. One scene in particular shows a victim screaming in awful pain.  This HBO made for TV story is too sympathetic towards Miss Eunice Evers.  As matter of fact, it goes so far as to hint that she was a victim of the white establishment.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The woman was truly a vile human being.  She freely chose to betray her friends and neighbors infected with syphilis.  Her constantly reiterated rationalization that ""the doctors know best"" is laughable to say the least.  At the end, we learn there were never any indictments handed down regarding these Nazi like experiments. Why weren't Miss Evers and Dr. Broadus arrested?

That being said, there is no real reason to complain about this film. It depicts a despicable human experiment that took place near Tuskeegee, Alabama, beginning in 1932 and continuing for several decades. In a government study, black men with syphilis were offered treatment and records were kept on their progress. They got better. Suddenly, the funding for the program was cut. Some time later, a new program was begun. In this one, the black syphilitic men were studied and treated but the treatments were placebos. They served as a control group. Originally, the promise was that, upon completion of the program, the patients would be given the real treatments. In actuality, so much data was derived from these men that the program continued and continued for years with no real treatment. Eventually, the men began to die off and their minds an bodies succumbed to the devastation of the disease.One might well wonder why men would agree to take part in a study like this. The key was, they were never told that they were not being treated. They thought they were getting good health care but the system considered them expendable.One might well wonder why caring medical practitioners would agree to be involved with this study. They did not think they had any real choice. If the study was not done, the men would get no care at all. At least with the study, other health care treatments were given.This story is told from the point of view of a black nurse who was a part of the study from the beginning. It deals with her interactions with the patients and with her personal battles with her conscience. It is well done which just makes the film all the more distressing.",4,An American Tragedy,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,1786,"['made', 'cable', 'drama', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'such', 'historicity', 'back', 'seat', 'drama', 'being', 'said', 'real', 'reason', 'complain', 'film', 'despicable', 'human', 'experiment', 'took', 'place', 'Tuskeegee', 'Alabama', 'beginning', '1932', 'continuing', 'several', 'decades', 'government', 'study', 'black', 'men', 'syphilis', 'were', 'offered', 'treatment', 'records', 'were', 'kept', 'progress', 'got', 'better', 'Suddenly', 'funding', 'program', 'was', 'cut', 'time', 'later', 'new', 'program', 'was', 'begun', 'one', 'black', 'syphilitic', 'men', 'were', 'studied', 'treated', 'treatments', 'were', 'placebos', 'served', 'control', 'group', 'Originally', 'promise', 'was', 'completion', 'program', 'patients', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'real', 'treatments', 'actuality', 'so', 'much', 'data', 'was', 'derived', 'men', 'program', 'continued', 'continued', 'years', 'real', 'treatment', 'Eventually', 'men', 'began', 'die', 'off', 'minds', 'bodies', 'succumbed', 'devastation', 'disease.One', 'might', 'well', 'wonder', 'why', 'men', 'would', 'agree', 'take', 'part', 'study', 'key', 'was', 'were', 'never', 'told', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'treated', 'thought', 'were', 'getting', 'good', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'considered', 'expendable.One', 'might', 'well', 'wonder', 'why', 'caring', 'medical', 'practitioners', 'would', 'agree', 'be', 'involved', 'study', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'had', 'real', 'choice', 'study', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'men', 'would', 'get', 'care', 'least', 'study', 'other', 'health', 'care', 'treatments', 'were', 'given.This', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'black', 'nurse', 'who', 'was', 'part', 'study', 'beginning', 'interactions', 'patients', 'personal', 'battles', 'conscience', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'film', 'more', 'distressing']",N/A

678757,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005RDAN,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","""Miss Evers' Boys"" is one of the best made-for TV films I have ever seen. The acting is superlative and so is the writing. The casting is well done, too; and the musical score enhances the film. The plot flows along very well even though flashbacks are mixed with Nurse Evers' being questioned in the early `70s by a Senate panel.When the film begins we quickly learn of a program in Tuskegee, Alabama to treat African American men for syphilis. The men are told they are being treated for ""bad blood"" because the staff (including African Americans) doesn't want to scare them and they also aren't sure the relatively uneducated men will completely understand the physiology of their actual illness. Nurse Evers (Alfre Woodard) and Dr. Sam Brodus (Joe Morton) are eagerly on board to help these men. However, when Dr. Douglas (Craig Sheffer) tells Dr. Brodus that federal funding for the treatment program has dried up, the four hundred-plus men being treated are grossly and tragically misled--they are told that they are continuing to be treated when in actuality the government will now only pay for them to be studied, not treated and certainly not cured. Initially, Nurse Evers and Dr. Brodus are told by Dr. Douglas that they'll regain federal funding for more treatment inside of six to twelve months tops--but years go by and they begin to realize that they are participating in a horrific lie: These men will probably never be treated for syphilis and they will be studied until they die. Until they die--and this is all in the name of proving that the African American male reacts to syphilis the same way as the white man does.  The government purposely denies these men treatment because they are African American, poor and unimportant to the powerful people in Washington; that's disgusting, disturbing and horrific.Some will say that Nurse Evers should have left this program on principle--it's highly unethical, to say the least; and she has a very good prospective husband in Caleb (Lawrence Fishburne) who has syphilis but who gets a penicillin shot and then spends time overseas during World War Two to fight for our country. Caleb returns to Eunice and wants to move North somewhat to make a better life for the both of them. Even Nurse Evers' father wants her to go with Caleb! However, Eunice Evers stays because she is deeply attached to the suffering men and thus she has too big a heart to turn her back on them; she truly wants to do what little she can by comforting them and bringing at least a little smile to their faces now and then with some humor and genuine empathy.Alfre Woodard carries this film like a champ; what a performance she gives! Lawrence Fishburne's acting is superlative. Look also for fine performances by Obba Babatund&eacute; as Willie Johnson, one of a four man group calling themselves ""Miss Evers' Boys"" because they all love her so much; Thom Gossom Jr. as Ben; Ossie Davis as Eunice's father; E.G. Marshall as the Senate Chairman and Von Coulter as Hodman Bryan.Overall, ""Miss Evers' Boys"" is a fine dramatization of the real-life ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male."" I highly recommend this film for people interested in this matter; and people studying ethics would do well to get this film. Moreover, the film will also appeal to persons interested in medical and African-American issues.",5,disturbing but brilliantly done,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,3367,"['Miss', 'Evers', 'Boys', 'one', 'best', 'made-for', 'TV', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', 'superlative', 'so', 'writing', 'casting', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'mixed', 'Nurse', 'Evers', 'being', 'questioned', 'early', '70s', 'Senate', 'panel.When', 'film', 'quickly', 'learn', 'program', 'Tuskegee', 'Alabama', 'treat', 'African', 'American', 'men', 'syphilis', 'men', 'are', 'told', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'bad', 'blood', 'staff', 'including', 'African', 'Americans', ""n't"", 'want', 'scare', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'relatively', 'uneducated', 'men', 'will', 'completely', 'understand', 'physiology', 'actual', 'illness', 'Nurse', 'Evers', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Dr.', 'Sam', 'Brodus', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'are', 'eagerly', 'board', 'help', 'men', 'However', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Douglas', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'Dr.', 'Brodus', 'federal', 'funding', 'treatment', 'program', 'dried', 'up', 'four', 'hundred-plus', 'men', 'being', 'treated', 'are', 'grossly', 'tragically', 'misled', 'are', 'told', 'are', 'continuing', 'be', 'treated', 'when', 'actuality', 'government', 'will', 'now', 'only', 'pay', 'be', 'studied', 'not', 'treated', 'certainly', 'not', 'cured', 'Initially', 'Nurse', 'Evers', 'Dr.', 'Brodus', 'are', 'told', 'Dr.', 'Douglas', ""'ll"", 'regain', 'federal', 'funding', 'more', 'treatment', 'six', 'twelve', 'months', 'tops', 'years', 'go', 'begin', 'realize', 'are', 'participating', 'horrific', 'lie', 'men', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'treated', 'syphilis', 'will', 'be', 'studied', 'die', 'die', 'name', 'proving', 'African', 'American', 'male', 'reacts', 'syphilis', 'same', 'way', 'white', 'man', 'government', 'purposely', 'men', 'treatment', 'are', 'African', 'American', 'poor', 'unimportant', 'powerful', 'people', 'Washington', 'disgusting', 'disturbing', 'horrific.Some', 'will', 'say', 'Nurse', 'Evers', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'program', 'principle', 'highly', 'unethical', 'say', 'least', 'very', 'good', 'prospective', 'husband', 'Caleb', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'syphilis', 'who', 'penicillin', 'shot', 'then', 'spends', 'time', 'overseas', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'fight', 'country', 'Caleb', 'Eunice', 'move', 'North', 'somewhat', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'Even', 'Nurse', 'Evers', 'father', 'go', 'Caleb', 'However', 'Eunice', 'Evers', 'stays', 'deeply', 'attached', 'suffering', 'men', 'thus', 'too', 'big', 'heart', 'turn', 'back', 'truly', 'do', 'what', 'little', 'can', 'comforting', 'bringing', 'least', 'little', 'smile', 'now', 'then', 'humor', 'genuine', 'empathy.Alfre', 'Woodard', 'film', 'champ', 'what', 'performance', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'acting', 'superlative', 'Look', 'also', 'fine', 'performances', 'Obba', 'Babatund', 'eacute', 'Willie', 'Johnson', 'one', 'four', 'man', 'group', 'calling', 'Miss', 'Evers', 'Boys', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Thom', 'Gossom', 'Jr.', 'Ben', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Eunice', 'father', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'Senate', 'Chairman', 'Von', 'Coulter', 'Hodman', 'Bryan.Overall', 'Miss', 'Evers', 'Boys', 'fine', 'dramatization', 'real-life', 'Tuskegee', 'Study', 'Untreated', 'Syphilis', 'Negro', 'Male', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'matter', 'people', 'studying', 'ethics', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'film', 'Moreover', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'appeal', 'persons', 'interested', 'medical', 'African-American', 'issues']",N/A

Based on the true story of the infamous ""Tuskegee Study"", it is quite a shocker. Nurse Eunice Evers (played beautifully by Alfre Woodard) is invited to work with two doctors on a program that was federally funded to treat patients afflicted with the syphilis disease in Macon County, Alabama. The patients--who were men--were being given free treatment. But within a while, the program ended and was withdrawn by the government. When this happened, money was offered for what became known as ""The Tuskegee Experiment"", which was a study of the effects of the syphilis disease on patients who didn't get treatment. Immediately after, the men were being told that they were being cared for, when they were declined the proper medicine that would have fully cured them. Miss Evers was then faced with such a scary issue: she would have to abandon the study and inform her patients of the news or to stay quiet and offer nothing but comfort. The movie is mostly shown in flashbacks, starting in 1932 when the program started, up to the ""present"" in 1973. Laurence Fishburne (who also was executive producer of this movie) plays Caleb Humphries, who had known Eunice since childhood. This is a must see movie for anyone, whether they are going into the medical profession or not.

If they used all the FDA tests, instead of high grading the 2 that make the drug look good, placebos would be more effective than most drugs.  A GAO study  noted that chemo is not effective.  So was it immediately abandoned?  No, this extremely expensive, nonfunctional treatment is still being used.Our Bodies, Ourselvescited a study which showed that of all drugs introduced between 1964 and 1972, half had any effect at all, and 15% were effective for their prescribed use.  Elizabeth Kubler Ross notes that children with AIDS were treated just as the people in this film were.  The most important lesson of this film is that if, in this case, black people can be treated this way, anybody can be treated this way.  We should not tolerate the mistreatment of even one person, because it spreads.  Voltaire noted a long time ago that doctors amused the patient, while nature does its healing.  This has not changed much.  People like to cite emergency medicine.  That's true, EM is great.  Once you get out of that, it hasn't changed much.  A hospital bed in the South in the 1950's cost about $2/day.

Kyle,"[23, 23]","Unfortunately, the ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphillis in the Negro Male"", which began in 1932 in Alabama, is strong proof that clinical studies were not created equal. In this experiment, poor African American males were not treated for syphillis and not told of their true condition.When penicillin became available as a treatment, the subjects were not afforded the option of getting the shots. (NOTE:  Depending on the stage of syphillis, penicillin may not be a safe treatment option)As a result of unethical treatment on the part of the experimenters in this study,  the US National Health Investigation Board was developed in 1979. This board promulgated Institutional Review Boards and ethical guidelines for the conduct of clinical research studies. None of the clinical staff of this study faced any criminal charges.""Miss Evers Boys"" is a made for television dramatization of the Tuskegee Study from the point of view of Nurse Eunice Evers (Woodard).The film details the RN's enthusiastic enlistment into the study because she believed The New Deal was for everyone and was going to help African Americans.According to the film, the original study offered treatment for syphillis patients--who were told they had 'bad blood' because the doctors believed most of the men would not understand the physiology of their disease.Later, when treatment funds dried up, researchers were encouraged by the National Health Service to continue the study to determine the effects of the disease.  At the time, they believed that monies for treatment would be available within six months to a year, tops. The experimenters were depicted as sympathetic and trapped in an unfortunate situation.  The Congressional Hearing panel who conducted the expository hearings on this study apparently felt similarly because no researchers were charged with cruelty regarding this study.The film is an excellent study in medical ethics.  It's impossible to watch this movie without tears in your eyes and anger in your heart.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 1]","I read an article once that said something about how a good book can fail if you don't like the main characters. If not for Caleb (played by Laurence Fishburne), I'd have never finished this film. Alfre Woodard did a great job playing the role of nurse Eunice Evers, but I thought Evers' decisions were the most illogical, insulting, goofy I'd ever seen in a film, in addition to the government's decision and her arguments in court sounded about as smart as the ""you hit me last"" rationale.For those who don't know the history of the Tuskegee Experiment, this movie will be educational. For those who do, it'll be interesting to see it play out. I knew about the experiment, but I did not know how deep the doctors were in trying to prove that black people and white people were so similar when it comes to medicine and science. (That's a helluva ""sacrifice"" to prove it, too.)I don't ever want to watch this movie again because I was so frustrated with Woodard's character. I seldom watch a movie and get mad for real, but I almost turned this movie off three times because I was so angry at the way it was playing out. However, again, Fishburne kept me tuned in. My favorite line of his was ""I hope what you gettin' is better than what you givin' up."" The scene against the tree was my favorite. I think he deserves every single award that Hollywood has created. In every movie he's been in, he embodies the characters. From ""Higher Learning"" to ""Always Outnumbered"" to ""School Daze"" to ""The Matrix"" to this movie, he is an excellent actor. Watching him glance at another actor or speak a few words would trick the mind into believing he really IS the character he's playing.Although the story was hard to watch, looking at his acting was a delight for the eyes.

The movie makes one feel as if he/she must choose sides.  Did Eunice Evers do what was right?We know the government was wrong for funding such an experiment and denying the syphllitic men treatment.  Even the doctors reasons for carrying on with the study once a cure (penicillen) became available were questionable.  But Nurse Evers is the one answering questions at a congressional hearing in this movie and she is the one who cared most for the men. Watch Ms. Evers ""bare her burden in the heat of the day.""The racist belief of the time held that syphilis manifested itself differently in Blacks as compared to Whites.This movie is a very gripping account of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted on unsuspecting black men for over 40 years.  The men thought they were receiving medical treatment for ""bad blood"" but instead were lied to and monitored by a medical program sanctioned by the united states government. It is as much a story of moral ethics in science as it is a travesty of social injustice.The cast is brilliant, the story tragic, depressing and awfully real.  But as the good doctor Brodus says to nurse Evers as she battles with her conscience whether to climb up that next hill and continue with the study; ""where you gonna go, they don't just let us go where its nice and flat, its all hills for us, we either climb or we stay at the bottom, that's the only choice they give us.""I'd like to think that this movie gives tribute to the real nurse Eunice Rivers, as well as the real black men who participated in the study.  Their sacrifice and contributions may or may not have been ""For the greater good."" And if so, then who's greater good was it for?
