833086,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0002FZ78I,Enjolras,"[0, 2]","The problem any new movie faces is getting the audience to care about the characters immediately. Otherwise, the movie can get pretty slow. Unfortunately,The Christmas Wish, otherwise a charming movie, suffers from this problem. It begins very quickly with a mysterious mention of a woman in the journal of the lead character's recently deceased grandfather. However, it takes a while to really feel for the characters until deep into the movie. Too often, I wondered why I should care about them or the investigation into the mysterious woman's background. Fortunately, once you give it a chance,The Christmas Wishhas some charming, Jimmy Stewart-type moments that really do make you think about Christmas values. Sometimes it becomes a bit unrealistic (can anybody be quite so good and wholesome as the grandfather is portrayed?), but it is touching nonetheless. The mystery is pretty intriguing - and I doubt anybody would guess correctly just who that woman is.Just a note - in a discussion of dinosaurs, one of the characters refers to ""Brontosaurus,"" even though that name went out the window and paleontologists now use ""Apatosaurus.""

It is well written, performed well, and is uplifting and inspiring. There is a thread of romance through the story, but as others have written, the main storyline is a grandson coming home to take care of his grandfather's affairs after he dies. Grandpa had a real estate company and the grandson hires a manager to run it for him, but he clashes with loyal, long-time employees. His grandma is reading her husband's journals and sees repeated references of visits her husband made to someone named ""Lillian"", but there are no details.  She asks her grandson, as his Christmas gift to her, to find out who ""Lillian"" is.  He wants to get things wrapped up and get back to his real life, but between the problems in the real estate office , the mystery of Lillian, and his developing feelings for his grandpa's former secretary, he can't seem to pull himself away. Through it all, what they really learn is what the grandfather was all about. The ending took me by surprise the first time I watched it, and it continues to move me with each viewing.This is not ""just another Christmas movie"" with a syrupy storyline and a too-good-to-be-true ending.

This one wasn't just romantic, it was like an old fashioned Christmas story with a surprising mystery.Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds were wonderful in this movie. Neil plays a guy named Will Martin, a real-estate agent, who was raised by his grandparents after his parents had perished in a car accident. His grandfather, Warren ran a successful real-estate business, and was a loyal person to his wife, Ruth (Debbie Reynolds), family, and his employees. When Warren passes on, Will comes and stays with his grandmother, Ruth, so they can settle Warren's estate.  One night at dinner, Ruth tells Will that she'd been looking through Warren's library of journals from all the years that they were married, and comes across one that mentions about a woman named Lillian, who he'd see every Christmas Eve. Ruth is anxious to know who Lillian is, and asks Will to search for answers. Will starts a search for the mysterious Lillian, wondering if she was a mistress, or perhaps a long, lost relative. Will begins his search by reading the journals, visiting business associates and friends of Warren's, going through Warren's personal effects, but always runs into dead ends.  On the way, he meets a woman named Renee, who once worked for Warren, and now runs her own dance studio.  She's also divorced with a young son, Justin, who immediately likes Will. (Will likes Justin too.) The two of them join Will on his search. Will and Renee also begin to fall in love!At the same time, Will is also deciding whether or not to sell the family real-estate business. Fortunately, in the end, he decides to keep it. All the employees are overjoyed.When it seems like Will is out of ideas in his search, the three go to a Christmas tree farm to buy a tree. Will meets the owner, Jose Rivera, who actually knew Warren, and said that Warren always bought two trees. One for him and Ruth, and one for a place called the Martha Fields Nursing Home. Will goes there later, and meets Mrs. Baker, the manager, who mentions about Warren's visits every Christamas Eve, and also that he'd always go upstairs to visit with a woman named Lillian. Will's eyes light up. Mrs. Baker explains that Lillian is the longest living resident at the home (she had no family), and has been in bad health for some time. It also turns out that she was the mysterious driver who had fallen asleep at the wheel, and caused the the car accident.  Warren probably always visited Lillian as a way of forgiving her. Mrs. Baker takes Will upstairs to see Lillian.  Back at Ruth's house, while she, Will, Renee, and Justin are giving each other gifts, Will tells Ruth he has one special gift for her. The four go to the nursing home, and Will tells Ruth Mrs. Baker's story, then takes Ruth upstairs to meet Lillian. Ruth sits by Lillian, who's in bed, holds Lillian's hand, smiles at her and tells her she forgives her. Lillian smiles at Ruth. Ruth got her Christmas wish! Later, she, Will, Renee, and Justin sing Christmas carols with Mrs. Baker, and the other residents. Mystery solved!This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.

He is attempting to get the business into a position that he can oversee from his home in New York, where he is a shrewd Wall Street trader.  His grandmother tells him of her desire to know about a woman that his grandfather mentions in his journals, every Christmas Eve.  The mystery is the main plot of the story, as Harris plays novice detective, while trying to manage the real estate office.  As a result of both tasks, he learns more and more about his grandfather, his parents, and (of course) about himself.

The theme of the movie is forgiveness and the importance of family, and there is a little romance thrown in as well.  It's an excellent family film with no swearing.  The acting by Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds is superb.Will is a young man who moves from New York to manage the family realitor business after the death of his grandfather.  Will grew up with his grandparents because his parents were killed in a tragic car accident when he was very young.  Therefore his grandparents were the most important people in his life, and Will knew that they were very close to each other throughout their married life.  As he said, they were so close they were almost like one person.  After his grandfather's death, his grandmother Ruth starts to read her husband's journals that he wrote in volumes, one for every year of their married life.  In the journals it mentions that he goes to see a woman named Lillian every Christmas Eve and other times as well.  It was a secret that he kept from Ruth and she and Will fear the worst.  Ruth's Christmas wish is to know the answer to the mystery, and Will is determined to find out who Lillian was and why his grandfather would keep this a secret from the family.  In his quest, Will finds the answer to this haunting family mystery and finds romance along the way.  I would highly recommend this film.Just an additional note that there is another movie called ""A Christmas Wish"" but it is a classic with Jimmy Durante & Terry Moore, and has a completely different storyline.
