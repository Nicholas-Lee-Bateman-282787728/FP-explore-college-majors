This babysitter is supposedly taking care of these kids, two of whom are older than her, for an overnight stay.  There is one small child, a girl.  One boy gets interested in her for sex and she has to shut him down; he spends all his time watching porn on the net.  The other boy is a psycho.  This psycho boy holds them hostage in a bathroom by threatening them with violence.  He pounds on the door a lot and they sit in a bathroom doing stupid things forever.  The boy with her asks to see her breasts and she shows him her bra.  They end up eating cereal that he says he hides in the cabinet.

1666902,AEWAJRKEL38X9,B00EDAGZU2,"LM ""You are entitled to your INFORMED opinion...","[0, 0]","Decently well acted, but it failed to captivate me.  At first I was enjoying this.  It is obviously a film with a mediocre budget, and the acting was pretty good; in fact, I really liked all the actors and actresses.  Linda Hamilton caught my attention as the mother, but she had little screen time.  I feared that I would lose interest because of that, but the rest of the cast, especially the little girl, was very good!  The little girl was charming and fun, the younger brother was rather funny and touching in his own way as the one who has endured the most in this family, and the brother, Jack, was terrific.  The baby-sitter was great, but all of them together couldn't make the entire middle of the script riveting.SPOILERISH - but not in any major way -Yet despite all the talent and a decent plot, probably the fact that the majority of the film takes place in the bathroom got to be very boring very fast.  At first I didn't mind it too much, but there were so many opportunities for the baby-sitter and the kids to escape.  At first I couldn't even believe that Zoe believed the lame story she was told about why she woke up in the bathroom!  If I were her, I would have thought it was a giant joke or some sort of baby-sitter hazing.  She and the kids endured what...two days in a bathroom?They were hungry and bored and had to pee... we get it.  But nobody ever really took any real initiative to deal with a situation that didn't seem to be all that impossible to me.  Yes, the captor was dangerous, but against several of them and for every moment?  I just couldn't buy it.  I kept watching even tho my eyelids started to droop.  Talk, talk, let's play pretend, talk, talk...  It got to be very dull to me.It would have to pick up at some point, right?But no...it dragged on and on and the tense moments were too few and far between.I finally made it to the end and it was a real let-down.  One of those endings that is supposed to be some great twist but really isn't.  Or was it not a twist but we were just supposed to be shocked by the peoples' behaviour at the end?  And the fate of two characters is shown...sort of, I guess.  We are really supposed to believe that that is plausible forever?  Come on!It is just too implausible, even for fiction.  I wasn't shocked or even terribly surprised.  I was bored and then let down.I can't say that I regret watching this because I don't.  For some reason I'm glad I gave it a chance.  If the script had been a bit &#34;tighter&#34; and the ending more plausible (even just a little!) I would probably watch it again.As it stands, however, I won't be watching it again or recommending it.  I have a love for low-budget films, but most of the time I don't find them almost-drooling-into-my-lap dull, but this one was for quite some time.
