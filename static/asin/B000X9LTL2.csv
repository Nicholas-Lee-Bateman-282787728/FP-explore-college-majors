1113615,A3E83AUQV0I12X,B000X9LTL2,"DL753627 ""mystery fan""","[1, 2]","Philip Gardiner offers a provocative look into the psyche of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the classic Sherlock Holmes detective stories.  As bizarre as one of the 37 short stories written by Doyle, ""The Madness of Sherlock Holmes"" (2007) follows the author's spiritual journey from his time as a student at a Catholic Jesuit school to his peculiar explorations into the occult and membership in secret societies. Comparable to Gardiners other productions like ""Secret Societies"" and ""The Ark, The Shroud, and Mary"" his research into the intricacies of Doyle's background is thorough, and the numerous photographs from the author's life add to the historical authenticity of this documentary.  The odd characteristics of Doyle's family and friends are also disclosed. While anyone who likes psychic exploration or biographies of prominent authors will find this DVD interesting, I was most intrigued by the suggestion that ""Doyle's quest to solve the riddle of his own existence is expressed in the riddles solved by Sherlock Holmes.""  If you have ever wondered if Doyle and the methodical Holmes have similar personalities or how Dr. Watson was created, then this is the place to get those questions answered.  I was both surprised and engaged in all that is revealed in ""The Madness of Sherlock Holmes"" (2007).",5,An Author's Mysterious Life Revealed,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,1316,"['Philip', 'Gardiner', 'provocative', 'look', 'psyche', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'author', 'classic', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'detective', 'stories', 'As', 'bizarre', 'one', '37', 'short', 'stories', 'written', 'Doyle', 'Madness', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '2007', 'author', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'time', 'student', 'Catholic', 'Jesuit', 'school', 'peculiar', 'explorations', 'occult', 'membership', 'secret', 'societies', 'Comparable', 'Gardiners', 'other', 'productions', 'Secret', 'Societies', 'Ark', 'Shroud', 'Mary', 'research', 'intricacies', 'Doyle', 'background', 'thorough', 'numerous', 'photographs', 'author', 'life', 'add', 'historical', 'authenticity', 'documentary', 'odd', 'characteristics', 'Doyle', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'disclosed', 'anyone', 'who', 'psychic', 'exploration', 'biographies', 'prominent', 'authors', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'was', 'most', 'intrigued', 'suggestion', 'Doyle', 'quest', 'solve', 'riddle', 'own', 'existence', 'expressed', 'riddles', 'solved', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'Doyle', 'methodical', 'Holmes', 'have', 'similar', 'personalities', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'was', 'created', 'then', 'place', 'get', 'questions', 'answered', 'was', 'surprised', 'engaged', 'revealed', 'Madness', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '2007']",The Madness of Sherlock Holmes
1113616,AIA1X0R7JEIA8,B000X9LTL2,Duane Browning,"[12, 13]","I rented this movie with the expectation of learning something new about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his most famous creation, Sherlock Holmes.I was bored after the first ten minutes of the film. I continued to watch it later, became bored again and paused it. This kept happening over the course of the film for me. At no time did this film grab my attention and hold onto it.The soundtrack of this film varied between different genre of music, from instrumental, to classical to a type of modern rock. No consistency whatsoever.Likewise, the visuals of the film seemed disjointed. For example, there was a scene, repeated several times throughout the movie, of a group of phantom children playing in a room. A man comes in, not seeing the children playing in front of him, who stands in front of a fireplace and lights a pipe. I waited for an explanation of this scene and why it was repeated several time through the film, but none came. It seemed to just be there for no reason. There were other scenes in the film which seemed to have no purpose and I was left wondering what they were about. One particularly annoying scene was near the end of the film, where some one is holding a copy of a Sherlock Holmes book and is flipping backwards through the book. Again, another scene that was there for no apparent reason.The whole film consists of the narrator speaking. No one is interviewed by the narrator, so all you hear is his voice, along with some recordings of an interview Doyle did some years before his death. Nothing special about them and they add nothing to the film.From what I gathered, the film is supposed to be an expose of Doyle's personal beliefs about the supernatural. His links to the Theosophists and Freemasons are continously mentioned. The identities of other acquaintances of Doyle's, who were also members of those groups is likewise brought-up, as if being a Freemason or Theosophist is some sort of black mark against these people. Early on in the film, the Jesuits are painted as if they were some sort of diabolical agency, instead of a religious order. We can freely disagree with the beliefs of others, but I personally don't hold Doyle in any lower regard due to his own ties to these people and organizations. Further, Doyle's gullibility in believing in fairies is mentioned at length. Anyone who has read a biography of Doyle's life would already have known this.So, Doyle was a spiritualist, a freemason and believed in things that most people today consider strange. So what? Anyone who knows anything about famous authors would realize that odd behavior and beliefs are often part and parcel of the very talented. Edgar Allen Poe, Hunter S. Thompson, Truman Capote and many others had aspects of their personalities that most other people consider to be odd or even frightening. But, that did not make them any less talented. Neither does it prevent us from enjoying their works today.Despite the Product Details Synopsis' claim that ""You will never see Sherlock Holmes in the same way again"", it didn't even begin to explore the characters of Holmes, Watson and Moriarty, in comparison to Doyle's personality, until near the very end.For me, there was never a moment in this film where I was astounded by a new revelation. It was just a long and boring lecture about secret socieities and Doyle's involvment in them. So what? This film did not change my view of Sherlock Holmes or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the smallest way.",1,A Waste of Time,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3469,"['rented', 'movie', 'expectation', 'learning', 'something', 'new', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'most', 'famous', 'creation', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes.I', 'was', 'bored', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'continued', 'watch', 'later', 'became', 'bored', 'again', 'paused', 'kept', 'happening', 'course', 'film', 'time', 'did', 'film', 'grab', 'attention', 'hold', 'it.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'varied', 'different', 'genre', 'music', 'instrumental', 'classical', 'type', 'modern', 'rock', 'consistency', 'whatsoever.Likewise', 'visuals', 'film', 'seemed', 'disjointed', 'example', 'was', 'scene', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'group', 'phantom', 'children', 'playing', 'room', 'man', 'not', 'seeing', 'children', 'playing', 'front', 'who', 'front', 'fireplace', 'pipe', 'waited', 'explanation', 'scene', 'why', 'was', 'repeated', 'several', 'time', 'film', 'none', 'came', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'reason', 'were', 'other', 'scenes', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'purpose', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'One', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'scene', 'was', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'holding', 'copy', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'book', 'flipping', 'backwards', 'book', 'Again', 'scene', 'was', 'apparent', 'reason.The', 'whole', 'film', 'narrator', 'speaking', 'one', 'interviewed', 'narrator', 'all', 'hear', 'voice', 'recordings', 'interview', 'Doyle', 'did', 'years', 'death', 'Nothing', 'special', 'add', 'nothing', 'film.From', 'what', 'gathered', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'expose', 'Doyle', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'supernatural', 'links', 'Theosophists', 'Freemasons', 'are', 'continously', 'mentioned', 'identities', 'other', 'acquaintances', 'Doyle', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'members', 'groups', 'likewise', 'brought-up', 'being', 'Freemason', 'Theosophist', 'sort', 'black', 'mark', 'people', 'Early', 'film', 'Jesuits', 'are', 'painted', 'were', 'sort', 'diabolical', 'agency', 'instead', 'religious', 'order', 'can', 'freely', 'disagree', 'beliefs', 'others', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Doyle', 'lower', 'regard', 'due', 'own', 'ties', 'people', 'organizations', 'Further', 'Doyle', 'gullibility', 'believing', 'fairies', 'mentioned', 'length', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'biography', 'Doyle', 'life', 'would', 'already', 'have', 'known', 'this.So', 'Doyle', 'was', 'spiritualist', 'freemason', 'believed', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'consider', 'strange', 'what', 'Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'famous', 'authors', 'would', 'realize', 'odd', 'behavior', 'beliefs', 'are', 'often', 'part', 'parcel', 'very', 'talented', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'Hunter', 'S.', 'Thompson', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'many', 'others', 'had', 'aspects', 'personalities', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'consider', 'be', 'odd', 'even', 'frightening', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'less', 'talented', 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'works', 'Product', 'Details', 'Synopsis', 'claim', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'explore', 'characters', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Moriarty', 'comparison', 'Doyle', 'personality', 'very', 'end.For', 'was', 'never', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'astounded', 'new', 'revelation', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'boring', 'lecture', 'secret', 'socieities', 'Doyle', 'involvment', 'So', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'view', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'smallest', 'way']",The Madness of Sherlock Holmes

He explores and brings to life people, places, groups, and happenings that many of us wonder about but can't find enough information on or may have never thought about before.  This documentary is no different.  I've read a lot of Sherlock Holmes books and knew that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had an ""odd"" personality and life.  Mr. Gardiner introduced loads of information I wasn't even aware of.  In this film we follow Doyle from his time at a Catholic Jesuit school and into his interest into the occult and membership into secret societies. As with all Gardiner films, the amount of investigation he does is phenomenal and he shares it all with us, from well-known facts to curious speculation.Throughout The Madness of Sherlock Holmes we see many photos of the author and his life, which I found quite interesting in and of themselves.  Yes, Doyle was eccentric, there's no doubt about it.  When you read a Sherlock Holmes book it's like taking a walk through the author's mind, and it does seem that Holmes and Watson are really both sides of the author himself.
