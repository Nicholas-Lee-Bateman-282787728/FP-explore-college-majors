1616446,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00AREP9VE,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[16, 16]","It's great to finally see that this series has been released as a Region 1 set.  Its certainly about time and long overdue!Death in Paradise manages to be a detective series with a difference - all credit to the script writers that they have been able to come up with a completely unique scenario after all the police series which have been on our screens over the years. Personally I liked the first series from the word go, but I think it has got better as it has gone along and it is certainly now right up there with my favorite television viewing.At the end of Series 1 we saw Detective Inspector Richard Poole on the dock of the island of Sainte-Marie where the series is set, appearing to be considering remaining on the island. Series 2 sees a continuation of his career on the island, with new murders to exercise his considerable investigative skills. Ben Miller is an excellent choice for the straight laced Poole and plays the part to perfection. His rather unlikely partner is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey, played by Sara Martins. The chemistry between the pair is quite clear and has grown as the show has gone along. This is a major factor in its success. Mention should also be made of the parts of Dwayne Myers, the oldest member of the team, and Commissioner Selwyn Patterson who was responsible for bringing Poole on board as these characters are also memorably acted.The episodes are quite varied this time round and range from the white owner of a plantation who is found with a machete in his back, and who has rather a tangled personal life to Camille's friend, a singer, who dies mysteriously whilst performing on a yacht. Poole has his own distinctive style of operation. He quietly investigates, takes everything in and when he is ready gathers everyone together and makes his pronouncement. A different time and background, but in a strange way Poole's style does remind me of Poirot.The last episode paved the way for a third series since Poole had chosen to return to the island after a trip to London. Indeed it has now been confirmed that another series has been commissioned and is due to view next year. Something to look forward to!",5,Police Series With a Difference,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2171,"['great', 'finally', 'see', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'Region', '1', 'set', 'certainly', 'time', 'long', 'overdue', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'manages', 'be', 'detective', 'series', 'difference', 'credit', 'script', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'completely', 'unique', 'scenario', 'police', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'screens', 'years', 'Personally', 'liked', 'first', 'series', 'word', 'go', 'think', 'got', 'better', 'gone', 'along', 'certainly', 'now', 'up', 'there', 'favorite', 'television', 'end', 'Series', '1', 'saw', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Richard', 'Poole', 'dock', 'island', 'Sainte-Marie', 'where', 'series', 'set', 'appearing', 'be', 'considering', 'remaining', 'island', '2', 'sees', 'continuation', 'career', 'island', 'new', 'murders', 'exercise', 'considerable', 'investigative', 'skills', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'choice', 'straight', 'laced', 'Poole', 'part', 'perfection', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'partner', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Camille', 'Bordey', 'played', 'Sara', 'Martins', 'chemistry', 'pair', 'quite', 'clear', 'grown', 'show', 'gone', 'along', 'major', 'factor', 'success', 'Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'parts', 'Dwayne', 'Myers', 'oldest', 'member', 'team', 'Commissioner', 'Selwyn', 'Patterson', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'Poole', 'board', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'memorably', 'acted.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'varied', 'time', 'round', 'range', 'white', 'owner', 'plantation', 'who', 'found', 'machete', 'back', 'who', 'rather', 'tangled', 'personal', 'life', 'Camille', 'friend', 'singer', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'whilst', 'performing', 'yacht', 'Poole', 'own', 'distinctive', 'style', 'operation', 'quietly', 'everything', 'when', 'ready', 'gathers', 'everyone', 'together', 'pronouncement', 'different', 'time', 'background', 'strange', 'way', 'Poole', 'style', 'remind', 'Poirot.The', 'last', 'episode', 'paved', 'way', 'third', 'series', 'Poole', 'had', 'chosen', 'return', 'island', 'trip', 'London', 'Indeed', 'now', 'been', 'confirmed', 'series', 'been', 'commissioned', 'due', 'view', 'next', 'year', 'Something', 'look', 'forward']",Death in Paradise - Series 2 anglais
1616447,A2JCDEK5UVKU1Q,B00AREP9VE,"D. Demro ""Vietnam War and WWII historian""","[8, 8]","One night while skimming through the channels I came across this series on our local PBS channel and it looked interesting enough to make me pause. I don't know what it was about the show, other than it has such a unique format, but before long I watched the entire show and I was hooked! At the time I didn't know if ""Death In Paradise"" was a movie or what, so I looked it up on amazon and learned it was a detective series. The pre-order price on amazon was $31.48 for Season 1 and $31.48 for Season 2. I then read a review stating the season sets are available at amazon UK for much less than what amazon US is charging, so I went to amazon UK and ordered the combined Season 1 & 2 Box Set and the total price including shipping was only $18.11!!! PLEASE NOTICE that the UK sets are ""Region 2"" or (PAL) and will NOT PLAY on a machine that is NOT a multi-regional machine. Mine is and most newer DVD players/recorders are now multi-regional I'm told, but I would recommend checking your unit before ordering.

1616448,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B00AREP9VE,Happy Reader,"[0, 0]","The small island of St Marie (fictitious), part of the Caribbean's Lesser Antilles (real), is beautiful and hot, with a vibrant culture that's a mix of several countries. As the Police Commissioner told Detective Inspector Richard Poole when Poole arrived on the island in Season 1: ""Honor&eacute; was colonized by the French, who lost it to the British, who lost it to the Dutch. The Dutch lost it back to the French. The French then handed it back to the British in the mid-seventies. So, 30% of the population is still French.""This fantastic mystery series follows Detective Poole as he and his 3-person staff solve murders and assorted crimes. Poole, being a buttoned up London Metropolitan Police Detective, has culture clashes that are usually funny and sometimes sad. On the other hand, Poole is a brilliant deductor, or is it deducer, and Detective Camille and Constables Fidel and Dwayne are great in their jobs. All of them are wonderfully portrayed by excellent actors. I particularly like how Poole occasionally demonstrates forensic labwork on a shoestring. I highly recommend this series. It's not necessary, but if you can, start with Season 1, to really get the flavor of how Poole has to struggle with his new position, and how the four of them forge themselves into a formidable team.Season 2 of ""Death in Paradise"" first aired in England in January 2013. I just received my Region 1 DVD set from the BBC's American website, see shop(dot)bbc(dot)com. (All prices are in dollars and all DVD's are Region 1, and there're occasional sales.) You get two discs with four episodes each. That's 466 minutes of great mysteries, presented in 16.9 aspect ratio. English subtitles are available. There are no DVD extras, which is a crying shame, given the spell-binding history and culture of the islands.The episodes aren't given any names when you view them. And on the discs, they're just called Part One, Part Two, etc. In my episode synopsis, below, I've added the popular unofficial titles.PART ONE: A Murder on the PlantationThe police are called out to the Seymour Plantation, established 1715. Roger Seymour, its 71 year-old scion, has been found in the original mill with a machete in his back. This place must have seen untold pain and misery. Do you believe in psychic imprints? Retribution from beyond? Poole certainly doesn't, and he concentrates on the cast of disgruntled friends and family Roger had gathered on his porch for a big announcement.In a side story, Camille is pressed by her lively mother to pay attention to Honor&eacute;'s week-long celebration of Erzulie, the Voodoo Goddess of Love.PART TWO: An Unholy DeathFather John prepares to lead a service at the Convent of the Sacred Heart. But young Therese, a postulate, has not arrived. The Mother Superior goes to Therese's cell to get her, but finds the room engulfed in smoke. Therese has died from smoke inhalation. Father John tells Poole, ""It's a big transition to make. Giving up nearly all contact with the outside world. No possessions. No money. But the cigarettes. We knew it was a struggle for her. She always smoked when she was upset.""They find Therese's hidden cigarettes, but they're a different brand from the case found on her bedside table. And that's not all that doesn't makes sense to Poole. It's another locked room mystery.PART THREE: Death in the ClinicA patient is found floating face down in the pool at an exclusive clinic specializing in cosmetic surgery. How exclusive? They are called to the scene by the Police Commissioner, dressed in a bathrobe. He was there for physical therapy for a sports injury. ""Absolute discretion"" is required, which is not Poole's strong suit.Trivia: See if you can catch it. The autopsy report says the patient had water in her lungs. But in his grand denouement, Poole says she was dead before she was put in the pool. Both can't be true.PART FOUR: A Deadly CurseIn 1563, the pirate Franois le Clerc (a real person) buried his booty from a captured Spanish frigate on St Marie. He never came back for it, and legend has it that it's still waiting to be discovered, protected by a curse. Not that a curse keeps out the treasure hunters. Poole is called out to the jungle campsite by the latest group to make the attempt. So far, one hunter was injured in a cave explosion. And one man has been shot through the heart with a flint-lock pistol. If it's not le Clerc, who is it?PART FIVE: Murder OnboardCamille is dressed to the nine's. She's on a party boat, supporting her close friend Aimee Fredericks. This is the ultra-talented Aimee's last performance before she heads to Miami and the record producer waiting for her. Right in the middle of her sultry song, Aimee collapses to the floor. She has been poisoned, but how? And how many jealousies can there be?Trivia: Aimee is played by Jamelia, and that is her own beautiful voice, though we don't get to hear much of it.PART SIX: A Dash of SunshineJune Anderson, a freckled redhead on vacation with her husband and sister, is confined to a wheelchair after a car accident. She's alone in the hotel room when someone creeps up behind her and strangles her with her own scarf.Poole is nearly pole-axed when he meets June's husband. Douglas Anderson is a Met police officer, and, as Poole tells Camille, ""one of my most objectionable colleagues.""The prior episode's murder was personal for Camille. This murder is personal for Poole: ""That's just what bullies do, isn't it? They turn the pack against you by setting you apart from the group.""PART SEVEN: A Stormy OccurrenceHurricane Irma is approaching St Marie. At the meteorological center, five people divvy up duties at the 5 weather stations set up around the island. One of them, though, is killed before the hurricane even arrives. Poole doesn't understand why everyone wants to interrupt the murder investigation for just ""a little wind"".PART EIGHT: A Deadly PartyPoole and Camille have been ordered to attend a reception fundraiser for the St Marie Marine Reserve. Schmooze. Make a good impression. Meet the movers and shakers. None of these come easily to Poole. But at least he's on hand when the host, the wealthy Mr. Powell, is shot in his study.""No one can escape their past, can they?""A highly recommended mystery series!",5,You Can Get Your Region 1 DVD

1616453,AIWA57W45A0AX,B00AREP9VE,Victoria C. Wood,"[12, 13]","This is an altogether charming, visually gorgeous, well-done Whodunit that never fails to surprise us when the villain is revealed. It's not about grisly crime scenes or nerve-wracking chases - it's about becoming part of a likable fictitious community and having fun while figuring out Who Dun It. Despite the fact that it deals with murder, the show always leaves me smiling. I agree with other reviewers that the role of Poole is cast and played ideally, but this can be said for every member of the cast. Two of my favorite characters are actually Fidel, the young father who tries so hard to do well in his chosen career, and Bordey's French mother, a strong, charismatic woman who never beats us over the head with macho feminism. The fact that even the supporting characters win us over so completely says something wonderful about what a well-done show this is, yet one of the show's best achievements is actually quite subtle: they've managed to allow the characters and their relationships to evolve in ways that seem natural rather than staged.",5,My Favorite Show,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,1055,"['altogether', 'charming', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'well-done', 'Whodunit', 'never', 'surprise', 'when', 'villain', 'revealed', 'not', 'about', 'grisly', 'crime', 'scenes', 'nerve-wracking', 'chases', 'becoming', 'part', 'likable', 'fictitious', 'community', 'having', 'fun', 'figuring', 'out', 'Who', 'fact', 'murder', 'show', 'always', 'smiling', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'role', 'Poole', 'cast', 'played', 'ideally', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'member', 'cast', 'Two', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'Fidel', 'young', 'father', 'who', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'well', 'chosen', 'career', 'Bordey', 'French', 'mother', 'strong', 'charismatic', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'beats', 'head', 'macho', 'feminism', 'fact', 'even', 'supporting', 'characters', 'win', 'so', 'completely', 'something', 'wonderful', 'what', 'well-done', 'show', 'yet', 'one', 'show', 'best', 'achievements', 'actually', 'quite', 'subtle', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'allow', 'characters', 'relationships', 'evolve', 'ways', 'seem', 'natural', 'rather', 'staged']",Death in Paradise - Series 2 anglais
