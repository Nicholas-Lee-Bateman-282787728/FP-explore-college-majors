On that count, with that expectation this film does deliver.I'll admit, I'm a Joel McHale (he is the voice of Elliot the young buck) fan. I love The Soup on E! television. He's irreverant, biting, and a good comedian. So this film had a bit of an advantage going in. I also knew that the first Open Season (Open Season (Widescreen Special Edition)) was kind of stupid and funny.My 13 year old son and I laughed pretty hard about every 5 minutes, that's pretty darn good. The film is short, 1 hour 15 minutes, and actually is just about right. So the humor was there.It's a silly dopey road trip movie. Elliot is engaged to marry Giselle (Jane Krakowski). Poor Elliot's rack is broken off and he's embarassed to get married. During the cermony, Weiner dog wanders off. The rest of the movie is the whole Elliot crew trying to free Weiner dog from his family of humans.The cast of voices for this edition is not as star studded as the first. But these are excellent voices, they all fit well and are enjoyable. In the end does it matter if Martin Lawrence or Mike Epps is the voice of Boog? As long as the voice is good, and the jokes are funny?The movie is rated PG, but there are a lot of racy double entendres. That's probably some of the most difficult humor for younger viewers. Elliot talks about his rack, that would be his horns, and how big they are. He keeps saying look at my big rack and don't you love my big rack. There's a number of weiner jokes. The intention is clear, would younger viewers get that? A very sensitive parent might not like this kind of humor. There are plenty of other gag jokes to keep those young viewers happy.Very stupid. Nothing socially redeeming. But it's a funny animated film, just pure stupid entertainment that isn't overly offensive. Sometimes that is just what the doctor ordered.",4,Stupid Stupid Funny,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,1932,"[""n't"", 'high', 'cinema', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'deep', 'anything', 'down', 'right', 'stupid', 'funny', 'enterainment', 'count', 'expectation', 'film', 'deliver.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'Joel', 'McHale', 'voice', 'Elliot', 'young', 'buck', 'fan', 'love', 'Soup', 'E', 'television', 'irreverant', 'biting', 'good', 'comedian', 'film', 'had', 'bit', 'advantage', 'going', 'also', 'knew', 'first', 'Open', 'Season', 'Open', 'Season', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'was', 'kind', 'stupid', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'laughed', 'pretty', 'hard', '5', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'film', 'short', '1', 'hour', '15', 'minutes', 'actually', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'humor', 'was', 'there.It', 'silly', 'dopey', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'Elliot', 'engaged', 'marry', 'Giselle', 'Jane', 'Krakowski', 'Poor', 'Elliot', 'rack', 'broken', 'off', 'embarassed', 'get', 'married', 'cermony', 'Weiner', 'wanders', 'off', 'rest', 'movie', 'whole', 'Elliot', 'crew', 'trying', 'free', 'Weiner', 'dog', 'family', 'humans.The', 'cast', 'voices', 'edition', 'not', 'star', 'studded', 'first', 'are', 'excellent', 'voices', 'fit', 'well', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'matter', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'voice', 'Boog', 'As', 'long', 'voice', 'good', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'are', 'lot', 'racy', 'double', 'entendres', 'probably', 'most', 'difficult', 'humor', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Elliot', 'talks', 'rack', 'would', 'be', 'horns', 'how', 'big', 'are', 'saying', 'look', 'big', 'rack', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'big', 'rack', 'number', 'weiner', 'jokes', 'intention', 'clear', 'would', 'younger', 'viewers', 'get', 'very', 'sensitive', 'parent', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'kind', 'humor', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'gag', 'jokes', 'keep', 'young', 'viewers', 'happy.Very', 'stupid', 'Nothing', 'socially', 'redeeming', 'funny', 'animated', 'film', 'just', 'pure', 'stupid', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'overly', 'offensive', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered']",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the original and eagerly went into part 2 with similar expectations, the first of which earned suspicion when I noticed the Columbia Pictures logo was absent on the sequel's DVD case (replaced with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment distribution). What this all means is direct-to-DVD territory.I remained optimistic as; after all, Sony Pictures is no small-budget operation.  The possibility remained that this would capture some of the charm of the original, even if budget cuts were inevitable.  Conclusion after having invested $14 and 76-minutes: this one manages to do the impossible in undoing what was great about the first one.Boog and Elliot are back again but voiced by different actors in a tale that sets up a reluctant Elliot altar-bound when Mr. Weenie is kidnapped by his former owners and group of pampered pets.Boog, Elliot, McSquizzy, Buddy and Giselle launch a full-scale rescue mission for their sausage-shaped friend and soon find themselves in enemy camp: the world of domesticated pets. Led by a toy poodle named Fifi, the pets do not plan to let Mr. Weenie return to the wild without a fight.  And thus the action begins.If, in the event this premise sounds intriguing to you, let me dash any such hopes from the onset by complaining about the simple fact that the character dynamic the first film so flawlessly established has been turned on its head here.  Boog is no longer a formerly domesticated bear struggling to find his way in the wild, he's a clich&eacute; sidekick and little more.  Elliott has gone from humorous if slightly misguided to full aught blundering idiot with commitment phobia to boot (funny but when last we left him, wasn't he madly in love with Giselle, who was clearly out of his league?)But the persona shifts are only a fraction of the greater issues plaguing this film.  The cast swaps are the next nagging grievance.  Martin Lawrence integrated a style to the Boog character that Mike Epps struggles (sometimes painfully) to emulate and the loss of Ashton Kutchor to the entirely overly enthusiastic Joel McHale as Elliott is really felt in conjunction with the weak scripting.The very plot itself is thin- with the Mr. Weenie angle proving that what little humor existed in the character the first time around worked best as a background element to the primary cast.Pacing is fairly methodic if a bit unsure of itself and that leads us to the real biggest crime this film commits: It really isn't appealing to viewers of any potential age group.  The plot and humor have crossed that delicate line where adults will enjoy it and the PG rating (which is well deserved thanks to endless sexual innuendos and references) will likely keep parents from feeling confident about letting the youngsters run buck-wild (sorry, couldn't resist at least one bad pun).What humor there is to be found here is certainly more of the visual/ slapstick/ bodily harm variety, which, contrary to what the PG-rating suggests, clearly caters to the very little and/or easily amused.  One could go as far as to say that the characters we know and love from the first film are so relegated to the background this time as to be not even necessary to the plot.  Suspicions point to the notion that they were merely integrated so as to make use of the Open Season brand name.In all I came away from this one extremely disappointed.  On its own it would have been an entirely average computer generated feature film but the fact that it desiccates the first movie in effort to achieve its sub par performance makes it that much harder to forgive.  The tragedy is that commercial revenues have been strong enough to convince Sony Imageworks to give a third film of the franchise a go.  Here's hoping it more closely resembles the roots of the first one and not a continuation of this derailment.",2,A Very Shallow Follow Up Effort,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,4017,"['first', 'Open', 'Season', 'was', 'testament', 'how', 'create', 'layered', 'humor', 'would', 'appeal', 'multiple', 'age', 'groups', 'then', 'sequel', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'eagerly', 'went', 'part', '2', 'similar', 'expectations', 'first', 'earned', 'suspicion', 'when', 'noticed', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'logo', 'was', 'absent', 'sequel', 'DVD', 'case', 'replaced', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'distribution', 'What', 'direct-to-DVD', 'territory.I', 'remained', 'optimistic', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'small-budget', 'operation', 'possibility', 'remained', 'would', 'capture', 'charm', 'original', 'even', 'budget', 'cuts', 'were', 'inevitable', 'Conclusion', 'having', 'invested', '14', '76-minutes', 'one', 'do', 'impossible', 'undoing', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'one.Boog', 'Elliot', 'are', 'back', 'again', 'voiced', 'different', 'actors', 'tale', 'up', 'reluctant', 'Elliot', 'altar-bound', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Weenie', 'kidnapped', 'former', 'owners', 'group', 'pampered', 'pets.Boog', 'Elliot', 'McSquizzy', 'Buddy', 'Giselle', 'launch', 'full-scale', 'rescue', 'mission', 'sausage-shaped', 'friend', 'soon', 'find', 'enemy', 'camp', 'world', 'domesticated', 'pets', 'Led', 'toy', 'poodle', 'named', 'Fifi', 'pets', 'do', 'not', 'plan', 'let', 'Mr.', 'Weenie', 'return', 'wild', 'fight', 'thus', 'action', 'begins.If', 'event', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'let', 'dash', 'such', 'hopes', 'onset', 'complaining', 'simple', 'fact', 'character', 'dynamic', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'flawlessly', 'established', 'been', 'turned', 'head', 'here', 'Boog', 'no', 'longer', 'formerly', 'domesticated', 'bear', 'struggling', 'find', 'way', 'wild', 'clich', 'eacute', 'little', 'more', 'Elliott', 'gone', 'humorous', 'slightly', 'misguided', 'full', 'aught', 'blundering', 'idiot', 'commitment', 'phobia', 'boot', 'funny', 'when', 'last', 'left', 'was', ""n't"", 'madly', 'love', 'Giselle', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'league', 'persona', 'shifts', 'are', 'only', 'fraction', 'greater', 'issues', 'plaguing', 'film', 'cast', 'swaps', 'are', 'next', 'nagging', 'grievance', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'integrated', 'style', 'Boog', 'character', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'sometimes', 'painfully', 'emulate', 'loss', 'Ashton', 'Kutchor', 'entirely', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'Elliott', 'really', 'felt', 'conjunction', 'weak', 'scripting.The', 'very', 'plot', 'thin-', 'Mr.', 'Weenie', 'proving', 'what', 'little', 'humor', 'existed', 'character', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'worked', 'best', 'background', 'element', 'primary', 'cast.Pacing', 'fairly', 'methodic', 'bit', 'unsure', 'real', 'biggest', 'crime', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'appealing', 'viewers', 'potential', 'age', 'group', 'plot', 'humor', 'have', 'crossed', 'delicate', 'line', 'where', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'PG', 'rating', 'well', 'deserved', 'thanks', 'endless', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'references', 'will', 'likely', 'keep', 'parents', 'feeling', 'confident', 'letting', 'youngsters', 'run', 'buck-wild', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'least', 'one', 'bad', 'pun', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'certainly', 'more', 'visual/', 'slapstick/', 'bodily', 'harm', 'variety', 'what', 'PG-rating', 'suggests', 'clearly', 'caters', 'very', 'little', 'and/or', 'easily', 'amused', 'One', 'could', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'characters', 'know', 'love', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'relegated', 'background', 'time', 'be', 'not', 'even', 'necessary', 'plot', 'Suspicions', 'point', 'notion', 'were', 'merely', 'integrated', 'so', 'make', 'use', 'Open', 'Season', 'brand', 'came', 'away', 'one', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'own', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'average', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'film', 'fact', 'first', 'movie', 'effort', 'achieve', 'sub', 'par', 'performance', 'much', 'harder', 'forgive', 'tragedy', 'commercial', 'revenues', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'enough', 'convince', 'Sony', 'Imageworks', 'give', 'third', 'film', 'franchise', 'go', 'Here', 'hoping', 'more', 'closely', 'roots', 'first', 'one', 'not', 'continuation', 'derailment']",N/A

Sony Animation was behind this, but it had the whole Cartoon Network look to it instead. The main voice talents from the first film did not come over,nor did any of the writing/production staff (and it shows).The story is just ok, entailing friends helping and rescuing each other with plenty of adventure and rabbit abuse. One of the main characters is a dachshund so apparently the ""wiener"" humor is what passes for hilarity these days. While it has been playing in the store kids of all ages are entranced by it but the parents haven't been thrilled with the parts they have seen. The ""..that lady pulled my wiener.."" and ""..my beautiful rack.."" lines raise a few parent's eyebrows so it hasn't exactly been a hit like I had hoped.The BD supplements are painful, including ""deleted scenes"" which were hand sketched and not worth the time. The ""Weenie Arcade"" has a horribly spliced ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" video by the Baha Men, a how to draw the animals tutorial, and a featurette about the faces behind the voices.I loved Hoodwinked, even with that style of animation, and OS2 looks similar in nature (no pun meant) but is much less of a quality film. I have read where people say this an ideal family film, which nothing really offends me so I would watch it with my kids, but needless to say I lost a few rentals playing it in the store.
