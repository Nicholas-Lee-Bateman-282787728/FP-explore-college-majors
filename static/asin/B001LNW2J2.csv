Don't say I didn't warn you!3. Foreseeing a disaster of apocalyptic proportions, a group of builders construct a self-sufficient underground city, built to last for 200 years.4. After 200 years, everybody forgets the existence of the world above.5. As soon as the 200 year warranty runs out, the city starts to malfunction, and there aren't any contact numbers for customer service.6. Lina Mayfleet, a young girl (Saoirse Ronan from Atonement) finds a message from the builders, and along with her friend Doon Harrow, they begin to explore the possibility of leaving Ember.7. This is against the law, and the Mayor (Bill Murray) has his own reasons to keep the two friends contained.8. The movie rushes through several chapters to wrap up the movie in 95 minutes, leaving many viewers dazed and confused.9. The ending begs for the sequel that is unlikely to happen.Despite good acting performances, and several high caliber stars including Tim Robbins, Martin Landau and Toby Jones, the movie fails to capture the detail provided in the book, and ends up as a muddled and hopelessly convoluted mess.This weak and soggy movie extinguishes any hope for the coaxing of this Ember into a sequel.

I will say that ""City of Ember"" is a decent evening's entertainment, although probably more likely to be enjoyed by children than by adults. (Funny enough, the plot here reminds me strongly of the plot of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, with the similarities of the ""return to the surface"" plot.)For children, there is a lot here to admire. The child protagonists are smart and clever, but never smart-alecky or disrespectful. There's plenty of pluck to go around, and the adventure stays bright and active without ever being especially frightening or disturbing.For adults, the pickings are a little more sparse. There's an awful lot here that simply doesn't make sense and although I grant that it is entirely possible that the book explains some things more in depth, a movie needs to stand on its own explanations. It doesn't make sense that the kind of society that would have the power, technology, and foresight to create the city of ember would then rely on such a convoluted method for bringing the people back up to the surface - individual boats that flow through a system of rapids? The attrition rate would be very high. Certain elements of the movie are left as dead-ends, which is very disappointing - for instance, the tantalizing finding of the large beetle leg is abandoned as a plot point. Why don't the large beetles and mutated moles invade the city at large and eat the people - or at least their food? The ending, too, is problematic, as are most ""return to the surface"" endings - namely, what are the people supposed to eat? Even assuming the makers left seeds in hermetically sealed jars, it's going to take awhile to grow them. But this is a common issue with this type of science fiction.If you've got children or just want a decent evening at home, ""City of Ember"" is a decent investment.This movie has closed captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Good Movie for Children,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,2025,"['City', 'Ember', '/', 'B001LPWGBO*Spoilers*I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'City', 'Ember', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'how', 'true', 'movie', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'say', 'City', 'Ember', 'decent', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'probably', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'adults', 'Funny', 'enough', 'plot', 'here', 'strongly', 'plot', 'Breath', 'Fire', 'Dragon', 'Quarter', 'similarities', 'return', 'surface', 'plot', 'children', 'lot', 'here', 'admire', 'child', 'protagonists', 'are', 'smart', 'clever', 'never', 'smart-alecky', 'disrespectful', 'plenty', 'pluck', 'go', 'around', 'adventure', 'bright', 'active', 'ever', 'being', 'especially', 'frightening', 'disturbing.For', 'adults', 'pickings', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'sparse', 'awful', 'lot', 'here', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'grant', 'entirely', 'possible', 'book', 'things', 'more', 'depth', 'movie', 'stand', 'own', 'explanations', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'kind', 'society', 'would', 'have', 'power', 'technology', 'foresight', 'create', 'city', 'ember', 'would', 'then', 'rely', 'convoluted', 'method', 'bringing', 'people', 'back', 'up', 'surface', 'individual', 'boats', 'flow', 'system', 'rapids', 'attrition', 'rate', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'high', 'Certain', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'dead-ends', 'very', 'disappointing', 'instance', 'tantalizing', 'finding', 'large', 'beetle', 'leg', 'abandoned', 'plot', 'point', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'large', 'beetles', 'mutated', 'moles', 'invade', 'city', 'large', 'eat', 'people', 'least', 'food', 'ending', 'too', 'problematic', 'are', 'most', 'return', 'surface', 'endings', 'namely', 'what', 'are', 'people', 'supposed', 'eat', 'Even', 'assuming', 'makers', 'left', 'seeds', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'jars', 'going', 'take', 'awhile', 'grow', 'common', 'issue', 'type', 'science', 'fiction.If', ""'ve"", 'got', 'children', 'just', 'want', 'decent', 'evening', 'home', 'City', 'Ember', 'decent', 'investment.This', 'movie', 'closed', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

1215294,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B001LNW2J2,Anthony Pittore,"[15, 16]","When a film boasts a cast list comprised of some of the most talented Hollywood actors in Bill Murray, Tim Robbins, Martin Landau, and Toby Jones, not to mention newcomer and extraordinary talent Saoirse Ronan, it will most likely go one of two ways: Either the film deserves such a fine cast and will be a great film (take 'The Departed' (2006) for example) . . . or the cast is set in a subpar piece to make up for the film's lesser elements (like 'Valentine's Day' (2010)). Luckily, 'City of Ember' falls in closer with the former instead of the latter.The film, adapted from the novel by Jeanne Duprau, tells the story of a small city named Ember that, over two hundred years prior, was locked away by the city's founding builders. The city is run solely on the power of its massive generator that lies beneath like a beating heart. However, the old generator is slowly falling apart, casting the city into short periods of darkness. Doon Harrow (Harry Treadway), a young boy recently assigned to work on the pipes of the city, is convinced that only he can fix the generator and help the city. During his explorations of the piping systems, he finds a mysterious room that is unmarked on his maps. With the help of Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan), the two teens discover the secrets of Ember and the answers that may help save the townspeople from eternal darkness.When 'City of Ember' was released into theatres, it seemed to have gone by the attention of most people without much notice. With a production budget of over $50 million, the film only raked in about $8 million domestically. But, why was this film such a tremendous bomb? From the looks of it, it had little to do with the film's quality. It has a very solid cast behind it, the story is entertaining, kids movies at this level typically do well, and the trailers made it look to be very beautiful (which it was). It would seem, then, that the film was simply just undermarketed. Very little attention was given by the marketing team for this one and that's what killed it.Had 'City of Ember' been given a proper marketing campaign, it could've been very successful. The film is really quite good. The acting, as expected, is fantastic. The cast of legends like Bill Murray & Martin Landau were fantastically chosen; and, the 'Lovely Bones' star Saoirse Ronan is quickly becoming one of the best actors of her age group, not to mention a definite for a few Oscars in her lifetime. The story is very entertaining, even if it isn't the most original or mysterious. The set design, however, is really what sets the film apart. Ember is built into a fantastic and beautiful city, from the underground and above. One issue that many seem to have deals with the CGI effects in the film, especially some of the scenes towards the end. While some of the CGI is spotty, it's hardly distracting enough to remove from the overall beauty of the film and no one should allow such small issues to detract wholly from an overall good film.While book purists appear not to love the film for the oversimplification of the adaptation, those who have not read Duprau's novel should have a good time with it.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",4,"Amazing cast, stellar set design, fun story",1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3181,"['When', 'film', 'cast', 'list', 'comprised', 'most', 'talented', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'not', 'mention', 'newcomer', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'ways', 'film', 'deserves', 'such', 'fine', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'take', ""'The"", 'Departed', '2006', 'example', 'cast', 'set', 'subpar', 'piece', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'lesser', 'elements', 'Day', '2010', 'Luckily', ""'City"", 'Ember', 'falls', 'closer', 'former', 'instead', 'latter.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Jeanne', 'Duprau', 'story', 'small', 'city', 'named', 'Ember', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'prior', 'was', 'locked', 'away', 'city', 'founding', 'builders', 'city', 'run', 'solely', 'power', 'massive', 'generator', 'beating', 'heart', 'However', 'old', 'generator', 'slowly', 'falling', 'apart', 'casting', 'city', 'short', 'periods', 'darkness', 'Doon', 'Harrow', 'Harry', 'Treadway', 'young', 'boy', 'recently', 'assigned', 'work', 'pipes', 'city', 'convinced', 'only', 'can', 'fix', 'generator', 'help', 'city', 'explorations', 'piping', 'systems', 'mysterious', 'room', 'unmarked', 'maps', 'help', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'two', 'teens', 'secrets', 'Ember', 'answers', 'may', 'help', 'save', 'townspeople', 'eternal', 'darkness.When', ""'City"", 'Ember', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'seemed', 'have', 'gone', 'attention', 'most', 'people', 'much', 'notice', 'production', 'budget', '50', 'million', 'film', 'only', 'raked', '8', 'million', 'domestically', 'why', 'was', 'film', 'tremendous', 'bomb', 'looks', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'quality', 'very', 'solid', 'cast', 'story', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'movies', 'level', 'typically', 'do', 'well', 'trailers', 'made', 'look', 'be', 'very', 'beautiful', 'was', 'would', 'seem', 'then', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'just', 'undermarketed', 'Very', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'marketing', 'team', 'one', 'what', 'killed', 'it.Had', ""'City"", 'Ember', 'been', 'given', 'proper', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'acting', 'expected', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'legends', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'were', 'fantastically', 'chosen', ""'Lovely"", 'Bones', 'star', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'age', 'group', 'not', 'mention', 'definite', 'few', 'Oscars', 'lifetime', 'story', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'mysterious', 'set', 'design', 'however', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'apart', 'Ember', 'built', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'city', 'underground', 'One', 'issue', 'many', 'seem', 'have', 'deals', 'CGI', 'effects', 'film', 'especially', 'scenes', 'end', 'CGI', 'spotty', 'hardly', 'distracting', 'enough', 'remove', 'overall', 'beauty', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'allow', 'such', 'small', 'issues', 'detract', 'wholly', 'overall', 'good', 'film.While', 'book', 'purists', 'appear', 'not', 'love', 'film', 'oversimplification', 'adaptation', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Duprau', 'novel', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'it.Final', 'Verdict', '8/10.-AP3-']",N/A

1215297,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B001LNW2J2,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","With the recent internet publicity for the last of the Harry Potter films, there appeared an article on the so-called Harry Potter Wannabes and their ""failure"" to capture public attention.  The author of the article was somewhat rough on these films, so I decided I'd do a little research of my own.  I selected some of the DVDs of the movies and the books upon which they had been based to see what I thought of them myself.One of these was City of Ember.  I was really quite impressed with it.  It bore nothing at all that seemed to be in imitation of Harry Potter but was completely its own self.  While it was also a children's book/film and taught truths about society and about growing up, it was not a Harry Potter Wannabe at all.  It simply followed the rules of its genre; I would have considered it inappropriate if it had not done so.  That the film makers were taking advantage of an upsurge in interest in children's literature is hardly strange; money follows public interest in almost any field.  Personally I thought it was a good thing here.The main characters, as expected for children's films and books, were a young boy and girl--younger in the book than the film--whose lives are defined by the environment into which they had been born.  This is no different from our own experience except that theirs is not quite the environment that we know.  Like ours it is a very fragile, insular and manmade environment.  Again like ours may do, it is one that is about to collapse.  Here however it is underground with all of the caveats that that introduces.Since things started out quite comfortably for this community, the gradual slide into decline over some 250 years was ignored by some, denied by others, and ineffectively worried over by the balance.  It is particularly bright and attentive children that notice that the world into which they have been born and raised is tottering on the brink of extinction, but none of the adults want to deal with it.  Some continue with their lives as they are able accepting that they can do nothing else, others form friendship groups that are devoted to a philosophy that ""help will come"" from some outside source in the eleventh hour if they just ""believe,"" while some put by hidden goods to sustain at least themselves during the ""end-of-days.""  In short we have a pretty broad section of human reactions to slow pending disaster.  Ember is a microcosm of our own world.  Furthermore, just as in our world, political entities have a vested interest in keeping everyone in the dark--sometimes literally.  It is therefore the children who are left to save the society of Ember, and they do so at great risk to themselves--which makes for a very good story.The film managed to keep quite close to the format of the book; important--and sometimes difficult--if one is to keep the original audience of the book who will probably know every detail.  There were really only minor changes.  The adult roles were well played by skillful actors who had a capacity to reign in their egos in favor of the young, less experienced actors in the cast.  This shows incredible professionalism.  It also shows a good deal of common sense; my main complaint withLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Eventswas that the central adult actors, Jim Carey and Meryl Streep, overwhelmed the younger actors and even the story itself.  Here the young actors were allowed to shine in their roles and were very competent and comfortable with them; one thought entirely about the character and never about the actor playing it, which suggests either excellent talent or skillful direction--or both.Though many films these days get carried away with computerized graphics--to the point where they might as well be computer games--this one was a nice combination of live action and CGI.  One was never allowed to forget that this was a book about children and about a society at risk.  The city of Ember was a delightful set; a combination of almost medieval society and watered down 20th century, with cultural lacunae designed to get one thinking about what was actually happening here and why.  The set was dark and brooding, almost as much as one of the Alien films where humans made their lives in the midst of unearthly landscapes.  It gave the viewer a distinct sense of ""what had been lost,"" as The Builders had said and why they had prevented knowledge of the outside world from being known.  Costumes were designed to suggest poverty but an ongoing sense of human pride, even in adversity.  The population was poor, but they seemed to have made, not only the ""best of a bad situation,"" but a virtue of making do.  Furthermore, while there were people who were willing to lie and cheat to cushion themselves from difficult times, there were also people who were willing to make sacrifices for others, sharing what little they had.  Even The Builders may well have done so at the very beginning of ""time"" in Ember.  If there is anything about people that will help us through what may be a very difficult time in our own future, it will be just those psychological assets.It was a wonderful film.",4,A film with a

Mom""","[29, 31]","This is a movie which barely made a ripple at the box office, before apparently sinking without a trace, only to emerge in DVD release. Which is a pity, as it is eminently watchable, not least for the detailed visualization of the underground city of the title. It is based on a very popular series of `tween novels; I imagine that if you don't have children of an age to be entranced by the books, it would have been very easy to escape any knowledge of them at all.The set-up for the story involves an unspecified disaster on the surface of Earth, and the setting up of a refuge city deep under the earth; an entire city, completely self-contained in a vast cavern, supplied with enough food for 200 hundred years, powered by an enormous water-powered electrical generator. The civil authority, in the form of the Mayor of Ember is supplied with a small metal box, with a set of crucial instructions and a timer which will go off when supposedly it will be safe enough to emerge from Ember and live on the surface again. But there has been a break in the chain of mayoral authority; the box has been lost and forgotten, sitting on a dusty shelf. The current Mayor is a corrupt and manipulative fool, willing to see all decay around him, if he can hold onto power and privilege for a little longer.  More than 200 years have passed, and the electrical generator is breaking down. Blackouts are coming more often and lasting longer, and the only people who seem to have an interest in doing anything about it are a pair of teenage friends.  Lina works as a messenger, relaying personal messages among the inhabitants of Ember, since any electrical messaging system has long since decayed.  Doon works in the `pipes' repairing and maintaining an infrastructure tottering on the edge of collapse. Everything in this world has an authentic look of something worn out, used-up, patched and repaired many, many times.  The movie works and works well, right up until the very, very end - the escape from Ember by Doon and Lina, and Lina's little sister, which apparently seems to involve a wild water-ride - and an abrupt ending which leaves a number of questions unanswered; like, what actually happened on the surface so many years ago, and what was with the monstrously huge beetles and moles in the outlaying caverns? And what would happen to everyone else, left behind in the crumbling city? The ending seems quite rushed, and unsatisfactory - as if the budget didn't allow quite enough time for a satisfactory wrap-up.  Not having read the books themselves, we were left more than a little puzzled. But up until that point, it is an excellent movie, in comparison to some of the others which target the youth market. Lina and Doon are likeable, responsible teenagers, not a pair of bratty, spoiled know-it-alls.",4,"A beautifully visualized setting and set-up, but some questions",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2811,"['movie', 'barely', 'made', 'ripple', 'box', 'office', 'apparently', 'sinking', 'trace', 'only', 'emerge', 'DVD', 'release', 'Which', 'pity', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'not', 'least', 'detailed', 'visualization', 'underground', 'city', 'title', 'based', 'very', 'popular', 'series', 'tween', 'novels', 'imagine', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'age', 'be', 'entranced', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'escape', 'knowledge', 'all.The', 'set-up', 'story', 'unspecified', 'disaster', 'surface', 'Earth', 'setting', 'up', 'refuge', 'city', 'deep', 'earth', 'entire', 'city', 'completely', 'self-contained', 'vast', 'cavern', 'supplied', 'enough', 'food', '200', 'hundred', 'years', 'powered', 'enormous', 'water-powered', 'electrical', 'generator', 'civil', 'authority', 'form', 'Mayor', 'Ember', 'supplied', 'small', 'metal', 'box', 'set', 'crucial', 'instructions', 'timer', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'when', 'supposedly', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'enough', 'emerge', 'Ember', 'live', 'surface', 'again', 'been', 'break', 'chain', 'mayoral', 'authority', 'box', 'been', 'lost', 'forgotten', 'sitting', 'dusty', 'shelf', 'current', 'Mayor', 'corrupt', 'manipulative', 'fool', 'willing', 'see', 'decay', 'can', 'hold', 'onto', 'power', 'privilege', 'little', 'longer', 'More', '200', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'electrical', 'generator', 'breaking', 'down', 'Blackouts', 'are', 'coming', 'more', 'often', 'lasting', 'longer', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'interest', 'doing', 'anything', 'are', 'pair', 'teenage', 'friends', 'Lina', 'messenger', 'relaying', 'personal', 'messages', 'inhabitants', 'Ember', 'electrical', 'messaging', 'system', 'long', 'decayed', 'Doon', 'pipes', 'repairing', 'maintaining', 'infrastructure', 'tottering', 'edge', 'collapse', 'Everything', 'world', 'authentic', 'look', 'something', 'worn', 'out', 'used-up', 'patched', 'repaired', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'well', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'end', 'escape', 'Ember', 'Doon', 'Lina', 'Lina', 'little', 'sister', 'apparently', 'involve', 'wild', 'water-ride', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'number', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'surface', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'was', 'monstrously', 'huge', 'beetles', 'moles', 'outlaying', 'caverns', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'everyone', 'else', 'left', 'behind', 'crumbling', 'city', 'ending', 'quite', 'rushed', 'unsatisfactory', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'quite', 'enough', 'time', 'satisfactory', 'wrap-up', 'Not', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'were', 'left', 'more', 'little', 'puzzled', 'up', 'point', 'excellent', 'movie', 'comparison', 'others', 'target', 'youth', 'market', 'Lina', 'Doon', 'are', 'likeable', 'responsible', 'teenagers', 'not', 'pair', 'bratty', 'spoiled', 'know-it-alls']",N/A

1215307,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001LNW2J2,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""City of Ember"" succeeds in that it creates a world of its own. It takes place in an underground city that was once functional but is now falling apart; it has an appropriately ramshackle look, the structures looking as hand-me-down as the clothes worn by the citizens. Unfortunately, creating a world is the only thing this movie succeeds at. The filmmakers seemed to think that the audience would assume everything about the story, which is a fancy way of saying that absolutely nothing was explained. How disappointing, especially since some notable names are attached to the project. The screenwriter is Caroline Thompson, who penned ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and ""The Addams Family"" as well as a number of charming family films, including ""Homeward Bound"" and ""Black Beauty."" The director is Gil Kenan, who made his film debut with ""Monster House,"" one of the best animated films of 2006.""City of Ember"" begins with a barely developed back-story. When humanity faced certain doom, a group of people called Builders constructed a vast city beneath the Earth's surface, a city they named Ember. Exactly what happened is never revealed, I'm sorry to say. All anyone knows is that the builders encase a special set of instructions in a metal time capsule, one that has a digital timer set for 200 years. It was then given to a woman assigned as Ember's mayor. She then passed it down to the next mayor, and it continued like this until someone decided to hide the capsule in the back of a closet. Why this happened is anyone's guess. Be that as it may, it's now 200 years later, and Ember is faced with a multitude of problems, the biggest being that the city's generator is dying. This is bad because a multitude of light bulbs is the only thing illuminating the city. The bulbs are located so high that I'm forced to wonder how anyone has the ability to change them. I'm also forced to wonder where the citizens got the bulbs in the first place; the city may have been well stocked to begin with, although it's hard to imagine 200 years worth of light bulbs stashed away somewhere.For something that was built to save humanity, both the city and its population are surprisingly small. Maybe a lot of the people died through the years. Okay, but then how do they manage the dead? They can't bury them because there would be no room for other structures. They can't cremate them because there's nowhere for smoke to escape to. How did the Builders manage to work out sanitation issues? Where do the people go to the bathroom? How do they bathe? How is the sewage processed? We do see a network of pipes throughout the film, but it's still a mystery how the Builders got them there or even how water is pumped through. Exactly where did they find their water supply, anyway? And what about food? The implication is that the builders supplied them with enough canned food to last them 200 years. This is ridiculous; even when canned, it isn't possible for food to last that long. As far as I know (and this isn't just speculation on my part), the only food that doesn't spoil is honey.In the midst of these logistical and practical nightmares is an actual story about two young people--a motherless boy named Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and a parentless girl named Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan)--who discover things about the city no one ever knew. They're introduced during a pseudo-graduation ceremony, where the children of Ember are assigned permanent jobs. Out of a number of menial positions (with important ones like Police Officer or Janitor conveniently forgotten), Doon is assigned as a Messenger and Lina is assigned as a Pipe Worker. A Messenger is someone who runs back and forth across the city in a red cloak, delivering messages from one person to another. A Pipe Worker does maintenance work on the city's water pipes, which can't be replaced but can be patched up. Because Doon wants to be closer to the generators, he and Lena trade jobs. They then get involved in an escape plot, putting them at odds with the city's corrupt government, led by the gluttonous Mayor Cole (Bill Murray).A number of side characters populate the film. Tim Robbins plays Doon's father, who always seems to know more than he lets on. Martin Landau plays Doon's supervisor, Sul, who knows only what his job requires him to know and nothing else. Toby Jones plays the Mayor's sniveling right hand man. Liz Smith plays Lina's grandmother, and like another Liz Smith character--Grandma Georgina from Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""--she's slow, forgetful, and somewhat senile. We even have gigantic mutant bees and moles lurking about, which may or may not hint at what happened on the surface 200 years earlier.There are moments in this film that defy logic, such as the fact that Lina draws a picture of a city under a blue sky. The Builders make it clear that all future generations would not know about what happened on the surface, so that makes me wonder how she knows that there even is a sky above Ember. And then there's the ending, which is so elaborate that it's impossible to believe that the Builders had a hand in it. I won't describe it in detail; I will say that, if it were a log-flume attraction, it would be one of the most exciting a theme park has ever built. ""City of Ember"" is a valiant effort, but it overlooks far too many details. It doesn't tell us how or when, and it barely gets around to why. It's a great-looking but poorly developed story, and it's filled with characters we don't know much about. Clearly, someone's bulb went dim somewhere along the way.",3,Lights Out for the Underground City,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,5629,"['City', 'Ember', 'world', 'own', 'place', 'underground', 'city',

Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Not as good as either Lemony Snicket, A Series of Unfortunate Events; nor Harry Potter; but an enjoyable film nonetheless.The story of three children who try to find their way out of Ember, an underground city, to save mankind. This is a well told story of the mysteries they have to solve and perils they have to overcome to make their escape. Like Harry Potter, the lighting is dark, the color muted. There are several puzzles the three have to solve. The city has a feel of Diagon Alley. Like Lemony Snicket, the girl is extremely intelligent, the boy is strong, and the little girl never speaks; their age differences seem about the same. Their world has a retro-future look. Both are laced with voice over narration, that beautifully supports the film. The common element, all three movies are based on young adult novels and are intelligent mysteries. They are all pleasant, interesting, family movies.Telling more of the plot might well ruin the mystery. The children actors are fantastic. Tim Robbins is very well cast and plays his role well. Bill Murray, just perfectly creepy as a super fat mayor.From a film standpoint, this one is fairly well done. There were several moments that made us all jump, the surprises were well built. The conflict was extremely well constructed, the resolution at the end makes complete sense and works very well. In general shots were in focus, framing was well done to add to the suspense. Music was extremely well used to reinforce the mystery.The one not so great area was the CG work at the end of the film. On a movie theater screen the whole water montage might have looked really great. On a television screen, albeit a large one, the CG effect just looked very bad, like toys in a river or people in front of a green screen. The film also opens with, what must be, an animated series of shots of the city from above. It looked like a cartoon for too long.The DVD is really sad. The transfer is not great, there are many compression artifacts. Dark blacks are bands of color, not smooth black. The sound is well done, surround channels used to good effect. The subwoofer worked overtime rumbling the room. The worst part of the DVD, the bonus features are trailers for other movies.A film for the whole family. Intelligent enough that adults will enjoy the mystery and story. No violence. The mole montage is subtly done, Bill Murray is never seen actually being eaten.

1215315,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B001LNW2J2,DarthRad,"[4, 5]","So many previous reviews have focused on Bill Murray or Martin Landau that they ignore the actress who I thought was the key figure in this movie, then 13-year old Saoirse Ronan, playing the role of Lina Mayfleet.  Harry Treadway, then 23 years old, plays the other youth, Doon Harrow.In this movie, Saoirse Ronan, she of the nearly unspellable and unpronouncable Irish name, has the genuine gangly limbs, fresh face, and wide-eyed innocence of real youth.  You sense that she is barely out of childhood, because she was just out of childhood, at the time of this movie.She was nominated for an Academy Award for her earlier role as a young girl in ""Atonement"", and, like the child stars of the ""Harry Potter"" movies, it has been  neat to see her grow up onscreen.  Her next big role is in ""The Lovely Bones"", and that will be some movie for this seriously up and coming actress.As for ""City of Ember"", it's a fine movie and well made adventure story, wrapped in an old fashioned framework of youth empowerment.  Innocent and earnest young teens, through their exuberant curiosity and tenacious persistence, manage to make discoveries and accomplishments in their world that the dullard adults have somwhow managed to miss out on.  The message is that young teens can make a difference even as they seem to be ignored and of little use to the adults around them.It's the type of family entertainment and positive movie message that would have been fairly typical for the old Disney studio nameplate back in the 1960s.  I am dating myself here, I suppose - there used to be a lot of books, movies, and TV shows like this in the olden days, but they have largely died out as young teens today are portrayed onscreen largely in much harsher modern tones, involved in sex, drugs, crime, dysfunctional families, and vicious teen infighting.  Or, they get slaughtered in horror movies.  Think of ""Thirteen"", ""Mean Girls"",  ""American Beauty"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.Those movies, of course, did much better at the box office than this movie did, which says more about our modern society than about this fine movie.",4,Saoirse Ronan is luminescent in this movie!,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,2107,"['So', 'many', 'previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'focused', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'ignore', 'actress', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'key', 'figure', 'movie', 'then', '13-year', 'old', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'playing', 'role', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'Harry', 'Treadway', 'then', '23', 'years', 'old', 'other', 'youth', 'Doon', 'Harrow.In', 'movie', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'nearly', 'unspellable', 'unpronouncable', 'Irish', 'name', 'genuine', 'gangly', 'limbs', 'fresh', 'face', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'real', 'youth', 'sense', 'barely', 'childhood', 'was', 'just', 'childhood', 'time', 'movie.She', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'earlier', 'role', 'young', 'girl', 'Atonement', 'child', 'stars', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'been', 'neat', 'see', 'grow', 'up', 'onscreen', 'next', 'big', 'role', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'seriously', 'coming', 'actress.As', 'City', 'Ember', 'fine', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'adventure', 'story', 'wrapped', 'old', 'fashioned', 'framework', 'youth', 'empowerment', 'Innocent', 'earnest', 'young', 'teens', 'exuberant', 'curiosity', 'tenacious', 'persistence', 'manage', 'make', 'discoveries', 'accomplishments', 'world', 'dullard', 'adults', 'have', 'somwhow', 'managed', 'miss', 'out', 'message', 'young', 'teens', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'ignored', 'little', 'use', 'adults', 'them.It', 'type', 'family', 'entertainment', 'positive', 'movie', 'message', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'typical', 'old', 'Disney', 'studio', 'nameplate', 'back', '1960s', 'am', 'dating', 'here', 'suppose', 'there', 'used', 'be', 'lot', 'books', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'olden', 'days', 'have', 'largely', 'died', 'out', 'young', 'teens', 'today', 'are', 'portrayed', 'onscreen', 'largely', 'much', 'harsher', 'modern', 'tones', 'involved', 'sex', 'drugs', 'crime', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'vicious', 'teen', 'infighting', 'get', 'slaughtered', 'horror', 'movies', 'Think', 'Thirteen', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Friday', '13th', 'etc.Those', 'movies', 'course', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'did', 'more', 'modern', 'society', 'fine', 'movie']",N/A

This is a story that is generally set in an underground city which serves as a refuge for humanity while the surface of the earth recovers sufficiently from a cataclysmic event to be habitable again. The movie starts with a device being set for 200 years which will provide the alarm for the underground population that it is safe to return to the surface. The problem is the device gets lost and the idea of a return along with it.Mankind being what it is, the underground city after 200 years is wearing out and threatening to fall apart and there's no one left who knows how to make repairs and food is getting in short supply. The story focuses on a young man and his friend who are concerned about the future of the city, seeing the infrastructure is failing, and are seeking answers. The device had been entrusted to a succession of city mayors but had gotten lost about the time of the term of the seventh mayor and subsequently forgotten about. The last mayor, played by Bill Murray, is a self-serving politician who cares only for himself and is only paying lip service to caring for the city.The young man and his friend discover the missing device and start trying to discover its meaning because 200 years have passed and the device can now be opened. The movie is about this process of discovery and the opposition the young people must face to solve the problem and discover the secret of the device.The scenery and settings were intriguing to me and helped establish a perfect ambience for the story.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","This film was a quirky delight for me, precisely because of the statement of another reviewer: the kids are not weird, foul-mouthed or silly. In fact, the kids make this story, a rare thing these days.Before I begin, I'll just observe that every post-apocalyptic story in film--EVERY ONE--has the survivors living in a communist lifestyle. Ever notice that? From the little-known sci-fi horror film IN THE YEAR 2889 (1967) to THE POSTMAN (1997) to THE BOOK OF ELI (2010)--all communistic. I think the only exception was Bartertown in MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME, where they were all villains. Because they weren't commies!All that off my chest, CITY OF EMBER is charming, as I said, thanks to the young protagonists Lina Mayfleet (an incredibly addicting Saoirse Ronan) and her rather sexy male companion Doon Harrow (the virtually unknown English kid actor Harry Treadaway, somewhat grown here).Thanks to the Builders from 200 years earlier, these people of Ember City have survived what I can only surmise was a nuclear war or something, easier for us to identify with now than when this film was first released. A city below ground was made, and two centuries' worth of generations have prospered well and happy.With them was the Box, carrying instructions on how to get back to the surface when it was safe. The Builders figured 200 years ought to do it, so when the time arrives, naturally the Box is at the bottom of someone's closet. In fact, it is Lina's grandmother (the immortal Liz Smith) who was last in possession of the box, which had been handed from mayor to mayor. Granny's grandfather was the last mayor to have the box. His sudden death put the box into civvie hands where it didn't belong.Lucky for humanity: Lina and Doon together discover the secret of the Box, the city's destiny and their own. The city is crumbling, and in fact almost ready to fail. The Builders designed it that way, and it was in fact meant to self-destruct once the people had all left. I was thrilled to watch this story unfold, to learn the animals above had grown to massive size (or the humans shrunk horribly, I can't tell). The kids decide they will make the attempt to see the ""forbidden outer zone"" which is in fact part of the cave in which they live, the part that leads out.Bill Murray is hilarious, goofy and ultimately sinister as the mayor; he has some great help with a cast including Tim Robbins as Doon's father, Mary Kay Place, Toby Jones, Mackenzie Crook and several others you'll recognize from the English screen. FUN!One complaint I have is that this film is so darned short. At a realistic 84 minutes (officially that's 90) it seemed to have suddenly been cut short. Didn't another reviewer say something about a budget conflict? Conflict, phooey. This film got ripped off by the producers. It should have been a good two hours and as riveting as any HARRY POTTER. Instead, it sort of goes off the deep end and suddenly it's over...leaving the viewer wanting more Doon and Lina.I recommend this film (maybe the kids won't notice the commie subplot). It's fun, fairly wholesome and I know...it reminded me of many of Roald Dahl's stories. It was written by a Jeanne Duprau--perhaps a cousin of Roald's?I took away one star for that careless and quick ending.",4,The Builders would have made this movie longer,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,3275,"['film', 'was', 'quirky', 'delight', 'precisely', 'statement', 'reviewer', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'weird', 'foul-mouthed', 'silly', 'fact', 'kids', 'make', 'story', 'rare', 'thing', 'days.Before', 'begin', ""'ll"", 'just', 'observe', 'post-apocalyptic', 'story', 'film', 'EVERY', 'ONE', 'survivors', 'living', 'communist', 'lifestyle', 'Ever', 'notice', 'little-known', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'film', 'IN', 'THE', 'YEAR', '2889', '1967', 'POSTMAN', '1997', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'ELI', '2010', 'communistic', 'think', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'Bartertown', 'MAD', 'MAX', 'BEYOND', 'THUNDERDOME', 'where', 'were', 'villains', 'were', ""n't"", 'commies', 'off', 'chest', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'charming', 'said', 'thanks', 'young', 'protagonists', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'incredibly', 'addicting', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'rather', 'sexy', 'male', 'companion', 'Doon', 'Harrow', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'English', 'kid', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'somewhat', 'grown', 'here', 'Builders', '200', 'years', 'earlier', 'people', 'Ember', 'City', 'have', 'survived', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'was', 'nuclear', 'war', 'something', 'easier', 'identify', 'now', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'city', 'ground', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'centuries', 'worth', 'generations', 'have', 'prospered', 'well', 'happy.With', 'was', 'Box', 'carrying', 'instructions', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'surface', 'when', 'was', 'safe', 'Builders', 'figured', '200', 'years', 'ought', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'time', 'naturally', 'Box', 'bottom', 'someone', 'closet', 'fact', 'Lina', 'grandmother', 'immortal', 'Liz', 'Smith', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'possession', 'box', 'had', 'been', 'handed', 'mayor', 'mayor', 'Granny', 'grandfather', 'was', 'last', 'mayor', 'have', 'box', 'sudden', 'death', 'put', 'box', 'civvie', 'hands', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong.Lucky', 'humanity', 'Lina', 'Doon', 'together', 'discover', 'secret', 'Box', 'city', 'destiny', 'own', 'city', 'crumbling', 'fact', 'almost', 'ready', 'fail', 'Builders', 'designed', 'way', 'was', 'fact', 'meant', 'self-destruct', 'once', 'people', 'had', 'left', 'was', 'thrilled', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'learn', 'animals', 'had', 'grown', 'massive', 'size', 'humans', 'shrunk', 'horribly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'kids', 'decide', 'will', 'make', 'attempt', 'see', 'forbidden', 'outer', 'zone', 'fact', 'part', 'cave', 'live', 'part', 'out.Bill', 'Murray', 'hilarious', 'goofy', 'ultimately', 'sinister', 'mayor', 'great', 'help', 'cast', 'including', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Doon', 'father', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Mackenzie', 'Crook', 'several', 'others', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'English', 'screen', 'FUN', 'One', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'so', 'darned', 'short', 'realistic', '84', 'minutes', 'officially', '90', 'seemed', 'have', 'suddenly', 'been', 'cut', 'short', 'Did', ""n't"", 'reviewer', 'say', 'something', 'budget', 'conflict', 'Conflict', 'phooey', 'film', 'got', 'ripped', 'off', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'two', 'hours', 'as', 'riveting', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'Instead', 'sort', 'deep', 'end', 'suddenly', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'Doon', 'Lina.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'maybe', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'commie', 'subplot', 'fun', 'fairly', 'wholesome', 'know', 'reminded', 'many', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'stories', 'was', 'written', 'Jeanne', 'Duprau', 'perhaps', 'cousin', 'Roald', 'took', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'careless', 'quick', 'ending']",N/A

So instead of enjoying the movie, I starting scanning my brains for its 'predecessor'. Finally it came to me: Logan's Run, where because of a dangerous environment, every one had to live inside of a dome. The problem of course was over-population, hence at 30 years of age everyone had to terminated.In this film, a similar scenario is set, however, in this instant, a city is built way beneath the earth's surface. The designers of the city estimated that after 200 years, the surface of the earth would have been habitable again. However, the concept of over-population has been ignored.The mayor of the city was supposed to keep in careful possession, a control box that would have guided the citizens back to the surface at the end of the 200 year period. However, this box ends up instead in the hands of Liana, a young messenger.The adventure then begins for her and a companion to make it to the surface of the earth. This is now a critical issue since the supplies in the city and its utilities are now failing.The mechanical devices that pose as puzzles to be solved, gives the movie a Myst like adventure game feel to it, which I think is a definite plus to the film and adds a lot of texture to the adventure.

But this film proves that such doesn't have to be the case.  A family film can be as profound and immersive as any other film.FOR THE PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS:This is a family film.  There really isn't much to offend anyone.  In fact, I would say that if you do find something offensive, more often than not you are trying too hard haha.MOVING ON:This film is based off of a book...well to be exact it's based off of a series.  I, however, have not read the books, so I'm not aware if this movie is depicting one book or compressing the entire series.  Still, whatever it's doing, it does it wonderfully and wonderfully right.  In viewing this film, I was actually quite a bit hesitant...these kinds of films are not my usual cup of tea.  But it was strangely amazing and am glad I got this.  The world that was portrayed in this film was fantastically realized.  It always felt alive and the actors (major and minor) really added to the quality of the environment.  Not only that but it adds to the realism, making the world much more believable.  In fact, one aspect of the film I enjoyed was learning about the culture through the subtle social ambience continually existent.  The opening of the film is one of my favorite examples of this.  Also, the dialogue was actually really good.  It's amazing how these small minor details were so well crafted, the joys of the underground as well as the dangers and fear were not told, but felt.  Ya, no cussing or whatever, but that shouldn't be what makes things serious or real.  For what it was, the dialogue was very mature.  The two leads were also quite charming in their roles...for that matter, everyone was, actually.  The acting wasn't flawless, but the spirit they put in it made you forget about said flaws.  The music score is quite magical as well and adds to the vibe.  Really, the world depicted in this film was a joy to explore.  Narratively speaking, it may be a condensed version from the book...but remember, I never read the book.  The narrative was very cohesive and straightforward...and very well paced.  Nothing seemed like filler.  What I found amusing was that I actually experienced UNEXPECTED plot twists.  The reason is simple.  After seeing so many films about conspiracies and dark themes, you know what such films will throw at you...nothing new under the sun.  But this film, though dark themes did exist, was a very positive and warm narrative, and that threw me off as to what to expect.  It was a pleasant and refreshing experience...helped you remember hope.SPECIAL FEATURES:To be honest, I don't really remember what special features there were...so that most likely means they didn't leave that lasting of an impression on me.ALL IN ALL:A great film for the family.  It ain't about fluffy clouds, and deals with mature and realistic issues.  Definitely something the kids can learn from, too.  Great discussion material.  BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, it's a brilliant film with good acting and a well told story.  Even adults can find the film interesting and engaging on it's own merits.",5,Family Films can be Rather Beautiful Sometimes,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3199,"['strange', 'stigma', 'concerning', 'family', 'films', 'One', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'always', 'filled', 'cheese', 'film', 'such', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'case', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'profound', 'immersive', 'other', 'film.FOR', 'THE', 'PARENTS', 'AND', 'OTHER', 'INTERESTED', 'FOLKS', 'family', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'offend', 'anyone', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'do', 'find', 'something', 'offensive', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'are', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'haha.MOVING', 'ON', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'well', 'be', 'exact', 'based', 'series', 'however', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'movie', 'depicting', 'one', 'book', 'compressing', 'entire', 'series', 'Still', 'doing', 'wonderfully', 'wonderfully', 'right', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'kinds', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'usual', 'cup', 'tea', 'was', 'strangely', 'amazing', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'world', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'fantastically', 'realized', 'always', 'felt', 'alive', 'actors', 'major', 'minor', 'really', 'added', 'quality', 'environment', 'Not', 'only', 'realism', 'making', 'world', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'fact', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'learning', 'culture', 'subtle', 'social', 'ambience', 'continually', 'existent', 'opening', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'examples', 'Also', 'dialogue', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'amazing', 'how', 'small', 'minor', 'details', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'joys', 'underground', 'as', 'well', 'dangers', 'fear', 'were', 'not', 'told', 'felt', 'Ya', 'cussing', 'whatever', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'what', 'things', 'serious', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'dialogue', 'was', 'very', 'mature', 'two', 'leads', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'charming', 'roles', 'matter', 'everyone', 'was', 'actually', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'spirit', 'put', 'made', 'forget', 'said', 'flaws', 'music', 'score', 'quite', 'magical', 'well', 'vibe', 'Really', 'world', 'depicted', 'film', 'was', 'joy', 'explore', 'Narratively', 'speaking', 'may', 'be', 'condensed', 'version', 'book', 'remember', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'narrative', 'was', 'very', 'cohesive', 'straightforward', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'filler', 'What', 'found', 'amusing', 'was', 'actually', 'experienced', 'UNEXPECTED', 'plot', 'twists', 'reason', 'simple', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'conspiracies', 'dark', 'themes', 'know', 'what', 'such', 'films', 'will', 'throw', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'film', 'dark', 'themes', 'did', 'exist', 'was', 'very', 'positive', 'warm', 'narrative', 'threw', 'off', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'pleasant', 'refreshing', 'experience', 'helped', 'remember', 'hope.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'so', 'most', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'me.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'great', 'film', 'family', 'ai', ""n't"", 'fluffy', 'clouds', 'deals', 'mature', 'realistic', 'issues', 'Definitely', 'something', 'kids', 'can', 'learn', 'too', 'Great', 'discussion', 'material', 'BUT', 'MOST', 'IMPORTANTLY', 'brilliant', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'Even', 'adults', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

""City of Ember"" is based on the first book in a popular series of juvenile novels by Jeanne Duprau. According to a friend, if this first one does well at the box office, there will probably be a series of films based on the books. In this one, we follow a pair of teenagers who have been assigned their first adult jobs in a 200-year-old underground city. It is obvious that things are in an advanced state of decay; for example, the generator that provides the light, air and power for this mini-civilization is starting to falter, consequently the citizens are plagued by an accelerating incidence of brownouts and blackouts.Our girl Lina, portrayed by Saoirse Ronan (""Atonement"" and the upcoming ""The Lovely Bones""), is eager to perform her first ""grown-up"" task, that of being a messenger in the city... a task she takes very, very seriously. The boy Doon, portrayed by Harry Treadaway (""Control"" and ""The Disappeared""), will work with the ever-leakier pipes in the drippy labyrinth that serves the city. His overly cautious father is played by Tim Robbins (""The Lucky Ones"" and ""Noise""), while his narcoleptic co-worker/boss is played by Martin Landau (""The Majestic"" and ""Love Made Easy"").The plot has to do with The Builders, who prepared this underground city as a retreat for mankind in the wake of some cataclysmic event that made the surface of the earth uninhabitable. According to their calculations, in 200 years things will return to normal, humans may emerge from their shelter and mankind's regular life can resume.The current mayor of the city, played by Bill Murray (""Groundhog Day,"" ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums""), is vaguely aware that an important metal box had been misplaced a couple of mayors ago. As a result, no one knows that it contains detailed instructions for exiting the underground. Instead, the people blithely worship ""The Builders"" to whom they look for a safe return to ""The Outside."" The mayor's loyal sidekick is ably played by the always dependable Toby Jones (""Infamous"" and ""The Painted Veil"").For awhile I thought we were going to do Plato's allegory of ""The Cave,"" but things brightened up after we left those rusty, leaky corridors and jumped into a hi-tech carnival ride. This movie was probably originally intended for 3D, but it wasn't screened that way.

This time, the survivors are living deep, deep underground in a city designed by ancient people they never met, a city that is now quickly dying.  It's up to two kids to lead their people to salvation in the world above.The movie version of the book is very dull.  Despite decent set design and very good actors, it never rises above the mundane.  Everyone seems to be here for a paycheck, and the two lead actors almost seem to be in different movies at times.  Perhaps the TEN-YEAR age gap between them has something to do with their total lack of onscreen connection.  I simply don't understand why the producers didn't just hire two 14-year-olds, instead of one 14-year-old and one 24-year-old to play the part of two 12-year-olds.  The difference in their ages is painfully obvious throughout the film.The only ""extras"" here are some lame trailers for movies that look even worse than this one turned out to be.  As sorry as the movie was, it would have been nice to see at least one feature on the set design, since that was the only interesting part of the movie.  It's obviously a large set, so someone took a lot of trouble to design and bring to life an entire underground city.  I regretted missing this one in theaters, but now I'm glad I didn't waste my money.  Unfortunately, it's not even worth a rental.  Walden Media usually does a great job with their adaptations of YA literature (Holes, the Narnia movies, Bridge to Terebithia), but this time they missed the mark.  What a waste of a good book.

1215337,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001LNW2J2,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[2, 3]","CITY OF EMBER is a post-apocalyptic fantasy.  I have not read any of the books on which this movie is based, and, in fact, had never even heard of CITY OF EMBER prior to seeing this movie.  However, my husband and I both agree that watching this simple movie makes for a nice, entertaining evening at home.Hundreds of years in the past, the leaders of Earth realized a great cataclysm was coming that would destroy mankind.  To preserve the human race, a large, self-sustaining city, named Ember, was built deep underground.  The plan was for humans to live there, safe from the world above for 200 years.  So that they would not miss what they never had, there were no references to the world above anywhere in Ember.  After the first generation died out, it was as if the human race had always lived in Ember.  The secret was entrusted only to the mayor, who passed the timer and the secrets of the world above on to each successor.  Unfortunately, the seventh mayor of Ember died suddenly, before passing on the secret.  Now, many, many years have passed, and the CITY OF EMBER is failing.  The equipment that was meant to power the city for only 200 years is decrepit and can no longer be repaired, and they are running out of food.  Soon the final darkness will come, and with it, the death of the CITY OF EMBER and the remainder of the human race.  Of course, the city builders planned a way out of Ember at the end of their 200 year exile; it just has to be found in time.  Young Lina Mayfleet and her friend Doon Harrow believe that there must be a way out.  Lina finds part of a message from the original builders, which seems to be instructions for leaving Ember.  Even though it is against the law to leave the city, Lina, Doon, and Lina's little sister, Poppy, attempt to follow the instructions.  But will they make it in time?CITY OF EMBER is engaging from the beginning, with hints of the crisis to come, and the creation of Ember.  The city itself is very well done; the decaying Ember is detailed with depth and color; you can feel yourself underground.  Additionally, CITY OF EMBER enjoys the presence of several well known actors including Tim Robbins, Bill Murray, Mary Kay Place, and Martin Landau.  Overall, the performances by these strong actors, as well as the rest of the cast, are entertaining, if not completely believable.  The young leads, Saoirse Ronan and Harry Treadaway are delightful, although it is a bit typical and implausible that only these children can see that Ember is dying and can find the way out, and that all the adults are unaware of and unable to cope with what is happening.The biggest problem with CITY OF EMBER is the ending.  It is very rushed and lacks the punch and detail needed for a really outstanding finish.  It feels as if several key points were left out, perhaps to keep this movie short for a younger audience.  The discovery of the builders' intentions and the way to the surface happens too quickly, instead of unfolding in a slow and suspenseful manner.  Additionally, there are scenes missing after the ending; scenes that would have wrapped the movie up nicely and put a more satisfying bow on the end.As stated above, CITY OF EMBER is enjoyable and fun.  We liked it, in spite of the obvious flaws.  CITY OF EMBER is a nice evening at home for the entire family.  However, I will be ordering the books very soon, so I can read for myself the details that were clearly left out.",4,The Sky Is Falling,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,3448,"['CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'post-apocalyptic', 'fantasy', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'However', 'husband', 'agree', 'watching', 'simple', 'movie', 'nice', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'home.Hundreds', 'years', 'past', 'leaders', 'Earth', 'realized', 'great', 'cataclysm', 'was', 'coming', 'that', 'would', 'destroy', 'mankind', 'preserve', 'human', 'race', 'large', 'self-sustaining', 'city', 'named', 'Ember', 'was', 'built', 'deep', 'underground', 'plan', 'was', 'humans', 'live', 'there', 'safe', 'world', '200', 'years', 'So', 'would', 'not', 'miss', 'what', 'never', 'had', 'were', 'references', 'world', 'anywhere', 'Ember', 'first', 'generation', 'died', 'out', 'was', 'human', 'race', 'had', 'always', 'lived', 'Ember', 'secret', 'was', 'entrusted', 'only', 'mayor', 'who', 'passed', 'timer', 'secrets', 'world', 'successor', 'Unfortunately', 'seventh', 'mayor', 'Ember', 'died', 'suddenly', 'passing', 'secret', 'Now', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'failing', 'equipment', 'was', 'meant', 'power', 'city', 'only', '200', 'years', 'decrepit', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'repaired', 'are', 'running', 'food', 'final', 'darkness', 'will', 'come', 'death', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'remainder', 'human', 'race', 'course', 'city', 'builders', 'planned', 'way', 'Ember', 'end', '200', 'year', 'exile', 'just', 'be', 'found', 'time', 'Young', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'friend', 'Doon', 'Harrow', 'believe', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'out', 'Lina', 'part', 'message', 'original', 'builders', 'be', 'instructions', 'leaving', 'Ember', 'Even', 'law', 'leave', 'city', 'Lina', 'Doon', 'Lina', 'little', 'sister', 'Poppy', 'attempt', 'follow', 'instructions', 'will', 'make', 'time', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'engaging', 'beginning', 'hints', 'crisis', 'come', 'creation', 'Ember', 'city', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'decaying', 'Ember', 'detailed', 'depth', 'color', 'can', 'feel', 'underground', 'Additionally', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'presence', 'several', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'including', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Overall', 'performances', 'strong', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'entertaining', 'not', 'completely', 'believable', 'young', 'leads', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'are', 'delightful', 'bit', 'typical', 'implausible', 'only', 'children', 'can', 'see', 'Ember', 'dying', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'adults', 'are', 'unaware', 'unable', 'cope', 'what', 'happening.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'ending', 'very', 'rushed', 'punch', 'detail', 'needed', 'really', 'outstanding', 'finish', 'several', 'key', 'points', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'perhaps', 'keep', 'movie', 'short', 'younger', 'audience', 'discovery', 'builders', 'intentions', 'way', 'surface', 'too', 'quickly', 'instead', 'unfolding', 'slow', 'suspenseful', 'manner', 'Additionally', 'are', 'scenes', 'missing', 'ending', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'wrapped', 'movie', 'up', 'nicely', 'put', 'more', 'satisfying', 'bow', 'end.As', 'stated', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'liked', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'nice', 'evening', 'home', 'entire', 'family', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'ordering', 'books', 'very', 'soon', 'can', 'read', 'details', 'were', 'clearly', 'left', 'out']",N/A

1215339,A1ZGAZLH9K711I,B001LNW2J2,Keonyn,"[0, 1]","Take what the naysayers say with a grain of salt, there's always a group left bitter any time a book is adapted to film. What you get with City of Ember isn't exactly what you get with the book, so it isn't the greatest as far as an adaptation goes. You still get a movie that follows the themes and spirit of the book and brings the city to life, even if the story that's told sees some changes. In all reality, this is still a more faithful adaptation than the Lord of the Rings films, which saw huge changes in spite of their acclaim (I still love those books and films as well).This film creates a very intriguing steampunk styled world, which is a genre that gets very little attention in spite of its potential. We see a world that mixes both the old world and the modern world, and does so effectively. They did a fantastic job of bringing this world to life I though, which is quite an achievement considering everything that had to be created to do so. As far as the set and atmosphere is concerned, they did an amazing job, I can't really fault them here.As I mentioned though, the story sees a great deal of omissions and changes, even though the central concept and themes remain intact. As a translation of the book to the screen, I would probably say it is mediocre at best. As an adaptation of the book made for the screen, I would be much more forgiving. It's not a perfect movie, but it isn't terrible either, and I'm certain it will satisfy those looking for a good film for the family.I've heard some comments about the acting, but I thought the performances were pretty impressive. Bill Murray makes a good villain, even though his role is fairly limited to a handful of scenes. Harry Treadaway does an admirable job playing Doon, and Tim Robbins does well playing his father in another limited role. I felt the star was Saoirse Ronan as Lina Mayfleet though, she did a terrific job playing the spirited young girl that is ultimately the center of the film. I think some of the complaints about her performance comes from the fact that Lina is almost the exact opposite type of character that Briony was in Atonement, so what you're seeing is the same actress playing a completely different character. In the end, I thought it really demonstrated her fantastic range as I thought she pulled off the performance wonderfully. Martin Landau does a pretty good job in his minor role as well, playing the pipework Sul that Doon apprentices under.The soundtrack is pretty good too, and might be worth a look for those who enjoy soundtracks. It's a somewhat adventurous movie, so the score follows in that vein with a number of active themes, but also a good choice of slower themes as well.I would say the most disappointing aspect of this DVD is the DVD release itself. It still uses the fairly outdated method of putting the fullscreen version on one side with the widescreen on the other. I personally hate this method as I find, no matter how well I care for it, the side I use less often ends up scratched. There's also no special features on the disc either. They provide a couple trailers of other films to watch, but aside from that, there's nothing. The days of trailer only features has long passed I thought, but apparently Fox is still living in the DVD dark ages.All in all, it's a worthy watch, and a somewhat short film. Some aspects do seem tossed in with little thought or care (giant animals and insects), but the core of the film is solid. If it's a faithful translation of the book you want, you probably will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book and just want a fun family movie though, then I'd say this one is worth giving a shot. The atmosphere and sets alone are worth seeing, and the performances are pretty good. The story has a few holes, and it probably would have been served well by adding another 20 minutes to fill some of them in, but overall it's worth the watch unless you're a purist fan of the books who can't stomach the modifications.",4,"Not the book, but still a worthy film",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,3997,"['Take', 'what', 'naysayers', 'say', 'grain', 'salt', 'always', 'group', 'left', 'bitter', 'time', 'book', 'adapted', 'film', 'What', 'get', 'City', 'Ember', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'book', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'as', 'far', 'adaptation', 'still', 'get', 'movie', 'themes', 'spirit', 'book', 'city', 'life', 'even', 'story', 'told', 'changes', 'reality', 'still', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'saw', 'huge', 'changes', 'spite', 'acclaim', 'still', 'love', 'books', 'films', 'as', 'well', '.This', 'film', 'very', 'intriguing', 'steampunk', 'styled', 'world', 'genre', 'very', 'little', 'attention', 'spite', 'potential', 'see', 'world', 'old', 'world', 'modern', 'world', 'so', 'effectively', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'world', 'life', 'quite', 'achievement', 'considering', 'everything', 'had', 'be', 'created', 'do', 'so', 'As', 'far', 'set', 'atmosphere', 'concerned', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'here.As', 'mentioned', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'omissions', 'changes', 'even', 'central', 'concept', 'themes', 'remain', 'intact', 'translation', 'book', 'screen', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'mediocre', 'best', 'adaptation', 'book', 'made', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'forgiving', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terrible', ""'m"", 'certain', 'will', 'satisfy', 'looking', 'good', 'film', 'family.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'comments', 'acting', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'good', 'villain', 'even', 'role', 'fairly', 'limited', 'handful', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'admirable', 'job', 'playing', 'Doon', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'well', 'playing', 'father', 'limited', 'role', 'felt', 'star', 'was', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'spirited', 'young', 'girl', 'ultimately', 'center', 'film', 'think', 'complaints', 'performance', 'fact', 'Lina', 'almost', 'exact', 'opposite', 'type', 'character', 'Briony', 'was', 'Atonement', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'same', 'actress', 'playing', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'end', 'thought', 'really', 'demonstrated', 'fantastic', 'range', 'thought', 'pulled', 'off', 'performance', 'wonderfully', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'minor', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'pipework', 'Sul', 'Doon', 'under.The', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'might', 'be', 'look', 'who', 'enjoy', 'soundtracks', 'somewhat', 'adventurous', 'movie', 'score', 'vein', 'number', 'active', 'themes', 'also', 'good', 'choice', 'slower', 'themes', 'well.I', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'release', 'still', 'fairly', 'outdated', 'method', 'putting', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'one', 'side', 'widescreen', 'other', 'personally', 'hate', 'method', 'find', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'care', 'side', 'use', 'less', 'often', 'up', 'scratched', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'provide', 'couple', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', 'watch', 'aside', 'nothing', 'days', 'trailer', 'only', 'long', 'passed', 'thought', 'apparently', 'Fox', 'still', 'living', 'DVD', 'dark', 'ages.All', 'worthy', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'short', 'film', 'aspects', 'do', 'seem', 'tossed', 'little', 'thought', 'care', 'giant', 'animals', 'insects', 'core', 'film', 'solid', 'faithful', 'translation', 'book', 'want', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'just', 'want', 'fun', 'family', 'movie', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'worth', 'giving', 'shot', 'atmosphere', 'sets', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'few', 'holes', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'well', 'adding', '20', 'minutes', 'fill', 'overall', 'watch', ""'re"", 'purist', 'fan', 'books', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'modifications']",N/A

I have occasionally come across City of Ember on Netflix and finally got around to watching it. I had my brother watch it with me, and even he turned to me and said, ""They advertise the wrong movies."" We both agreed it was an incredibly unique and enjoyable movie, and of much higher quality than most movies that have come out recently!The movie is about a city called Ember that was created when the world was ending. The greatest minds of the time gathered and decided the city would be cut off from the rest of the world for 200 years, hopefully enough time for any radioactivity or whatever else to diminish. At the end of the 200 years, a box was to open that would lead them out of Ember and back to the surface. Unfortunately, the box was lost and when the 200 years were up, the citizens of Ember were left in the dark, literally. The generator that had been supplying them for 200 years was dying, and the lights that supplied their city started blacking out more and more often. Two young citizens of Ember decided they needed to act, and find a way out of Ember. After finding the box, they worked to discover the way out. A fantastic adventure unravels which shows you the ingenuity of the ""builders"" (the men who created Ember) in their plan to release the citizens from Ember.The quality of the movie is great (they obviously spared no expense) and the acting isn't bad either! There are many familiar faces, such as Bill Murray, Tim Robbins, Mary Kay Place, Martin Landau, Simon Kunz and Mackenzie Crook. There are also some new faces, such as the two main characters. The movie is a fantastic family movie, with no harsh language or crude humor. This is easily a movie for kids, however we're adults, and we loved it! My only wish is that the movie had given a bit more at the end to show what happens next. Oh well!From what I've read, those who have read the book judge the movie very harshly (That's nothing new in book/film adaptations). They feel as though much of the symbolism of the book has been left out. I haven't read the book, however, I can't say I watch movies to find the symbolism behind every detail. I watch a movie for enjoyment, not necesarily enlightenment.

Whilst not as amazingly awesome as the book it was based on, it is nonetheless engaging, and at times thriling. I have to say, though, the acting in it was the best part. Bill Murray had so much charisma, I found myself thinking that if he ever went into politics for real, I'd vote for him! And Martin Landau -- wow! His character acting was so superb, he transformed himself to the extent that I didn't even know it was him until I saw his name appear in the credits. He's a total chameleon.My only real criticism is that certain elements of the movie's plot were a tad rushed or confusing (it helped that I had read the book first!) and the one big change from the book -- the, er, fauna of Ember -- was a little odd. A hint of a stolen plotline from Godzilla movies and 50s sci-fi, perhaps? I guessed that it was probably done to make the plotline more exciting, but personally, I don't think it was needed, and it would make any possibility of a sequel based on the 'Sparks' book difficult, since humans surviving on the surface would have been living in the same conditions as those fauna, and it, er, would have changed them quite ridiculously in size.All in all, this was a much better movie than most teen films that have been released lately, which begs the question -- why wasn't it better promoted? Where was the hype? I wouldn't have even known this movie had been released if my Mum hadn't seen it reviewed on an obscure late-night TV show, and mentioned it to me in passing.

1215350,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B001LNW2J2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","It is a honest, solid science fiction/adventure film, targeting mostly young public, but also watchable for adults. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.With an unspecified catastrophe destroying human civilisation, a huge underground shelter is build to harbor a group of survivors - the &#34;City of Ember&#34;. The city is built into a vast underground cavern and is filled with conventionally sized buildings and houses - the lights of this place are powered by a massive generator. But the city is now 241 years old - and it is slowly decaying. As generator begins to fail blackouts are occurring - and the reserves of canned goods and light bulbs are becoming depleted.The Mayor (Bill Murray), a guy both clueless AND ruthless (the worst possible combination) is unable to cope with this crisis - but is quite competent at preventing anyone of doing anything... There are however two people, Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and especially Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) who want to do something for their dying city, even if they don't know yet what...Lina, being a descendant of one of early Mayors of City of Ember, comes from what is the higher strates in this underground society when Doon on another hand is clearly working class - but they are nevertheless good friends and quickly become &#34;partners in crime&#34; when they start investigating some clues from the distant past, which the Mayor wants to remain hidden... I will not say more about the story.This is not a bad film and I watched it with pleasure. Some really good actors play here, as other than Bill Murray we have Tim Robbins, Martin Landau and Toby Jones. But this film was especially the confirmation of great talent of Saoirse Ronan, who got her big break a year earlier in &#34;Atonement&#34; - here, at the tender age of 14, she gives an excellent performance and her next film was going to be &#34;Lovely Bones&#34;...However, I can absolutely see why this film underperformed at box office - it suffers from a narrow ecological market niche. It is definitely TOO DARK for children and when we watched it, my then 10 years old daughter became ultimately scared and uncomfortable with it... SPOILER and PARENTAL WARNING: there is also one (just one) monster, a quite grotesque and yet freakishly scary thing, which, without the slightest doubt, EATS PEOPLE! For this thing alone I would very strongly advise against watching it with young children - in fact this film should be rated PG 12.On another hand, for most of adults this film will be probably not serious enough - the main adult public for &#34;City of Ember&#34; are, I believe, terminal science-fiction freaks like me... This &#34;double trouble&#34; limitation of age category created indeed a box office trap, which resulted in a financial counter-performance.It is a pity, because the story and the visual aspect of this film are not bad at all and as I already said, I watched it with pleasure. It certainly deserves to be given a chance.

That being said, I'm not even sure that smaller children will enjoy this film. But those too young for adult films and adults should find something to rejoice at with CITY OF EMBER.The film opens with a group of scientists gathered together to seal off a box that contains special information. The box is set to open in 200 years, enough time for a ravaged world to rejuvenate itself and be inhabitable again. The case is entrusted to the mayor of the below ground city built and known as Ember. It is handed down from mayor to mayor except that along the way it is lost.Now, we are presented with the lost box in the untidy closet of a citizen of Ember. It opens to find no one waiting. Instead, we find a city about to crumble. The lights flicker as the generator that powers it has almost run its course. But life goes on.Where most science fiction films present us a landscape with leather studded malcontents attempting to kill anything that moves, this one features people just trying to survive in a more peaceful way. Gone are the rusted ruins of cars along highways and buildings blown to bits, replaced with a compact town filled with people living their daily lives such as they are. Clothes are a bit worn, housing is tight, but they're happy.The main characters we find are teens, about to enter their adult world with jobs they select out of a bag held in the hands of the newest mayor, Mayor Cole (Bill Murray). Doon Harrow (Harry Treadway) hopes to score a job as an electrician. His father tinkers and he has the knack and feels he can fix the generator given the chance. Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) dreads the job she picks working on pipes. A quick trade with her friend Doon and both end up happy.Doon learns his trade following his supervisor Sul (Martin Landau). Along the way he learns of a map in Sul's possession and after getting his hands on it finds a secret unmarked tunnel. But it will be some time before he can explore further.Lina accidentally discovers the secret box in her grandmother's house shortly before the lady passes away. Open, she finds the instructions slightly worse for the wear as he little sister has begun eating them. With Doon's help, they piece together the puzzle pieces it will take to find out the secret left for them so long ago.Mayor Cole convinces his people that all is well, that the blackouts are temporary. While telling them not to worry, he sets things up to insure his own well being. When Lina comes to him with questions, he attempts to silence her but a quick escape leads to her and Doon finding the answers they had been searching for.Based on a children's novel, CITY OF EMBER is a magical tale of hope for a troubled people. The story shows that given a chance, people can work together to find solutions to the most catastrophic predicaments possible. Sure, there will be some who try to take advantage of the situation, but that dying need to find an answer, to find better, percolates beneath the surface until it boils to the top in the most unlikely of heroes.The story seems simple and it is as are most of the characters. These are not deeply rooted and explained people, who and how they are becomes apparent in their daily lives and the performances of the actors. Each one turns in a totally believable turn.Murray as Mayor Cole fits the small role well. It's not the center of attention even if it is the main bad guy, but it gives him enough to work with and he does it well. Treadway as the hero of the film does a great job as well, showing a knowing mind in search of the solution to a puzzle. But it is Ronan who shines here, showing a mixture of youthful exuberance, energy and discovery in the world around her. She will become an actress to watch in the future.Smaller children will not gather the importance behind this movie.

The movie came out in late 2008, and lasted about 2 weeks at the theaters as it lost money and got middling reviews from fans and critics.  Neither was deserved as this is actually a very good movie.  It is not really a fantasy movie, as there is no magic.  I would classify it as somewhere between an adventure, and a children's drama.  The storyline is quite original, especially for a PG-rated movie, as many other children's movies seem quite similar to each other.  The two highlights of this film are the acting and the soundtrack.  The acting is highlighted by a young actor and actress; both of which are almost unknown in Hollywood.  They are backed by many experienced actors filling in supporting roles, such as Martin Landau and Bill Murray, who takes a turn as the conniving bad guy.  The soundtrack is the other major plus of this movie; great orchestral music befit of a major Hollywood release.

Their parents, all but one has died by the start of the film, have trained their children to search for the way out and so the kids want to do something about their underground world that is collapsing. It is never explained, but at some point, the secrets to leaving the underground city have been lost (whether from consipiriacy or error it is not clarified), however, young Lina Mayfleet finds a box that has concealed the secrets for 200 yrs. Apparently, some time during the Cold War something so terrible happened (nuclear destruction perhaps), that the smartest men on earth prepared the city and the plans for them to eventually escape and return to the surface.This is a grand watch if you are interested in imaginitive films. The character of Dune somewhat reminded me of Skandar Keynes from Narnia by his manner and looks, though of course he is not. Lina had me working my mind because I couldn't figure her out, she was always keeping the audience on edge by her manners, mostly by trying to take care of others leaving the audience with held breaths as they sat on edge hoping she would acheive her missions. As someone else has said, the characters were enjoyable, and I only once wished that they would hurry up and get on with it because of all the suspence!If I were to compare it to other films, I would say, that it is like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because of imagination as well as the color and lighting themes And Narnia because of the two different worlds and the characters struggle to reach another world to save theirs.There are beasts, hidden doors, greedy enemies and much more to keep an interested audience on edge.

""City of Ember"" is a story about what happened after Dr. Strangelove (1964) confirmed that his plan for post-nuclear war survival would mean living underground with a 10:1 female-to-male ratio.So think ""THX-1138"" (1971) with a ""Goonies"" (1985) production design or a PG version of ""A Boy and His Dog""(1975). The point being that the idea (be in the screenplay or the source novel) is not a new one. It is just the first one to target a family audience. And although considerable suspension of disbelief effort is required I found myself quite engaged by the film.It is a boy and girl action adventure, sort of Sci-fi thing, with fun sets and a couple young heroes. Enter Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan). Lina's dad drowned in an escape attempt with Doon's dad. We learn that Dr. Strangelove gave Ember a life of 200 years, at which point I guess it was hoped that it would be safe to return to the surface.The 200-year period has already passed and the city is beginning to break down but the Strangelove device that was supposed to clue the citizens about their destiny has been forgotten in the back of a closet.The supporting cast are some relatively big names (Tim Robbins, Bill Murray, Martin Landau, and Mary Kay Place) who with the exception of Landau add very little to the production. Landau plays a sleepy version of ""Back to the Future's"" Doc Brown and spends the first hour setting up for the film's funniest line.Ronan is the reason to watch as this part gives her a chance to show some stretch in her acting. This is the next Winona Ryder folks; perhaps even better because Winona was obviously working hard to sell her assorted characters. In contrast Saoirse's performances seem effortless, you don't think ""what great acting"", she keeps you so into the illusion that you forget that she is not actually the character she is playing.Then again, what do I know?

Ember was a refuge for humankind to escape a world gone bad with pollution and waste. Its inventors entrusted the original Mayor with a box to pass down to each succeeding mayor.  In 200 years, the box would open and show the residents the way out of the city to the renewed world outside.Unfortunately, the box and instructions don't get passed down and the city is failing.  Two young friends, Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) find incomplete instructions for escape and set about to find the rest to save the inhabitants of Ember from destruction as their 'refuge' decays around them.

Essentially all there is to talk about is the movie. The whole idea has great potential with there being an underground city that contains the last element of humanity. Amongst the plot holes you could walk an underground city through and the blatantly obvious sections of film that have been cut out, there remains a fun, semi-adventure tale of two young adults trying to save their city from dying and corruption.My 9 year old boy liked watching it and was adequately entertained to keep the interest level there. I think the entire family can watch it and feel they got something out of it with light adventure, a semi-scary creature, and Martin Landau sleeping. I would rate this even lower with that ridiculous ending, but I think this will hold us over until the additional cuts/versions get released.EDIT: As an additional warning sign as to the studios having no confidence in this title, they sold it in non-returnable four-packs for a much lesser price (typically that is only done with really bad horror titles and unknown independents).

And that goes doubly so for classic children's books. And triply so if the movie is a little too far towards being B-grade and low-budget. I hadn't read the books, and wasn't even sure if this was meant to be a children's movie or how much had been spent making it (I'll watch any budget sci-fi/fantasy movie that seems to have had some care in the making) - so this was an enjoyable cinematic experience for me, and I'd watch it again. Technically this British-made film is very workmanlike and polished - and especially so in the costume design, superb set design and the sustained ambience. The lighting might have been a lot more dynamic. The early-appearing supporting British character-actors such as Heathcote Williams and the grandmother set an excellent tone for the movie, and the supporting cast all convince. For most 10 to 13 year olds, this will be a highly enjoyable and engaging fantasy adventure, one they can watch together with adults without the adults getting bored.  I'm not sure about 7-9 year olds getting bored, though. Other reviews have said the first half is slow, but I didn't notice that and liked the relatively intelligent and atmospheric build-up. The first-half may well be too slow, though, for younger and/or non-bookish kids - especially if they expect a non-stop 90 minute all-action roller-coaster-ride from every movie they see. We could have had a little more quirky character depth from the two main characters, perhaps by adding some voiceover ""I remember..."" moments near the start and more facial expressiveness throughout - but thankfully the studio writers decided not to inject any of the oh-so-fashionable angst and horror that seems to be standard for ""young adult"" fare these days. The film rather reminded me of a videogame at times, and I would love to play it as such. It has something of the puzzle-adventure games Myst and Riven about it, but in the setting of Fallout 3. Yet the lacklustre box-office performance of the film in the U.S.A, and the similarity to the existing game Fallout 3, will inevitably mean that there'll be no videogame made of it now. To conclude - a robustly well-made and well-acted all-ages entertainment, which if not perfect still manages to be far more engaging and memorable than the dismal ""Voyage to the Center of the Earth"" which is flagged on the US DVD cover. Those who read the books on the back of seeing this film, might then like to try a grown-up sci-fi novel called ""Anathem"", which has a similar setting and young protagonist.",3,Enjoyable entertainment - how enjoyable probably depends on if you're already read the books,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2704,"['/This', 'review', 'plot-spoilers/', 'fantasy', 'science-fiction', 'films', 'based', 'novels', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'books', 'doubly', 'so', 'classic', 'children', 'books', 'triply', 'so', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'towards', 'being', 'B-grade', 'low-budget', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'children', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'making', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'budget', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'movie', 'have', 'had', 'care', 'making', 'so', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'cinematic', 'experience', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'Technically', 'British-made', 'film', 'very', 'workmanlike', 'polished', 'especially', 'so', 'costume', 'design', 'superb', 'set', 'design', 'sustained', 'ambience', 'lighting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'dynamic', 'early-appearing', 'supporting', 'British', 'character-actors', 'such', 'Heathcote', 'Williams', 'grandmother', 'set', 'excellent', 'tone', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'convince', 'most', '10', '13', 'year', 'olds', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'engaging', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'adults', 'adults', 'getting', 'bored', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '7-9', 'year', 'olds', 'getting', 'bored', 'though', 'Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'first', 'half', 'slow', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'liked', 'relatively', 'intelligent', 'atmospheric', 'build-up', 'first-half', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'though', 'younger', 'and/or', 'non-bookish', 'kids', 'especially', 'expect', 'non-stop', '90', 'minute', 'all-action', 'roller-coaster-ride', 'movie', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'quirky', 'character', 'depth', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'adding', 'remember', 'moments', 'start', 'more', 'facial', 'expressiveness', 'thankfully', 'studio', 'writers', 'decided', 'not', 'inject', 'oh-so-fashionable', 'angst', 'horror', 'be', 'standard', 'young', 'adult', 'fare', 'days', 'film', 'rather', 'reminded', 'videogame', 'times', 'would', 'love', 'play', 'such', 'something', 'puzzle-adventure', 'games', 'Myst', 'Riven', 'setting', 'Fallout', '3', 'lacklustre', 'box-office', 'performance', 'film', 'U.S.A', 'similarity', 'existing', 'game', 'Fallout', '3', 'will', 'inevitably', 'mean', ""'ll"", 'be', 'videogame', 'made', 'now', 'conclude', 'robustly', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'all-ages', 'entertainment', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'memorable', 'dismal', 'Voyage', 'Center', 'Earth', 'flagged', 'US', 'DVD', 'cover', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'back', 'seeing', 'film', 'might', 'then', 'like', 'try', 'grown-up', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'called', 'Anathem', 'similar', 'setting', 'young', 'protagonist']",N/A

However, a few too-convenient outcomes and a rushed introduction can't take away the undeniable enjoyment of solving the epic mystery of the once-grand city with the two enthusiastic leads.When the world ended, a group of elite scientists and engineers determined that the only way to save their way of life was to build an underground city far below the decimated surface. Deciding upon a lifespan of 200 years for their city, the key to salvation was locked away in a metal box to be handed down from one mayor to the next until the time was right. But somewhere along the way the box was forgotten...Years and years have passed and the once mighty City of Ember steadily falters as corrupt officials dictate an antiquated way of life and the massive generator that powers the city frequently fails. Now it is up to two ambitious youths, Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) to solve the mystery behind the origins of their city and find a way out before their world is blanketed in darkness forever.Easily the most impressive piece of the City of Ember puzzle is the delightfully ominous science-fiction visuals. The massive sets were built in Northern Ireland in the shipyard-turned-soundstage of the location the Titanic was actually constructed in (now the largest soundstage in the world) and it's never more apparent than in the beautiful crane shots through the underground city. The CG elements are also top-notch, but the practical effects flawlessly immerse the audience in the fantasy world of pipeworks and generators.While the setting is brilliantly realized, the characters that populate the grandiose city receive far too little development. The introduction and relationship between the two main characters feels truncated and never really furthers as the story progresses, and the origins of each remain as enigmatic as that of the shining city. The adult characters throughout never provide as much support as they should to enhance the understanding and motives behind the city's cryptic suppression. At least Bill Murray hams it up as the gluttonous mayor with a devious agenda of his own.Like something blended from a video game universe (Bioshock in particular) and 12 Monkeys' post-apocalyptic subterranean sewer-world (or even Terminator's hypogeal bomb shelters), City of Ember packs adventure and intrigue into the wondrous exploration of a society crumbling from age and deceit. As the young heroes scour the dank passages and forgotten tunnels, it's difficult not to become immersed in the fun of uncovering clues and discovering secrets alongside the venturous duo.- The Massie Twins",3,City of Ember Review from The Massie Twins,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2879,"['City', 'Ember', 'supremely', 'majestic', 'setting', 'unravel', 'end-of-the-world', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'several', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'keep', 'escaping', 'family-friendly', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'feel', 'becoming', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'However', 'few', 'too-convenient', 'outcomes', 'rushed', 'introduction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'undeniable', 'enjoyment', 'solving', 'epic', 'mystery', 'once-grand', 'city', 'two', 'enthusiastic', 'world', 'ended', 'group', 'elite', 'scientists', 'engineers', 'determined', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'way', 'life', 'was', 'build', 'underground', 'city', 'far', 'decimated', 'surface', 'Deciding', 'lifespan', '200', 'years', 'city', 'key', 'salvation', 'was', 'locked', 'away', 'metal', 'box', 'be', 'handed', 'down', 'one', 'mayor', 'next', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'somewhere', 'way', 'box', 'was', 'forgotten', 'Years', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'once', 'mighty', 'City', 'Ember', 'steadily', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'dictate', 'antiquated', 'way', 'life', 'massive', 'generator', 'city', 'frequently', 'Now', 'up', 'two', 'ambitious', 'youths', 'Doon', 'Harrow', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'Lina', 'Mayfleet', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'solve', 'mystery', 'origins', 'city', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'blanketed', 'darkness', 'forever.Easily', 'most', 'impressive', 'piece', 'City', 'Ember', 'puzzle', 'delightfully', 'ominous', 'science-fiction', 'visuals', 'massive', 'sets', 'were', 'built', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'shipyard-turned-soundstage', 'location', 'Titanic', 'was', 'actually', 'constructed', 'now', 'largest', 'soundstage', 'world', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'beautiful', 'crane', 'shots', 'underground', 'city', 'CG', 'elements', 'are', 'also', 'top-notch', 'practical', 'effects', 'flawlessly', 'immerse', 'audience', 'fantasy', 'world', 'pipeworks', 'generators.While', 'setting', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'characters', 'populate', 'grandiose', 'city', 'receive', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'development', 'introduction', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'feels', 'truncated', 'never', 'really', 'furthers', 'story', 'origins', 'remain', 'as', 'enigmatic', 'shining', 'city', 'adult', 'characters', 'never', 'provide', 'much', 'support', 'should', 'enhance', 'understanding', 'motives', 'city', 'cryptic', 'suppression', 'least', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'hams', 'up', 'gluttonous', 'mayor', 'devious', 'agenda', 'own.Like', 'something', 'blended', 'video', 'game', 'universe', 'Bioshock', 'particular', '12', 'Monkeys', 'post-apocalyptic', 'subterranean', 'sewer-world', 'even', 'Terminator', 'hypogeal', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'City', 'Ember', 'packs', 'adventure', 'intrigue', 'wondrous', 'exploration', 'society', 'crumbling', 'age', 'deceit', 'young', 'heroes', 'scour', 'dank', 'passages', 'forgotten', 'tunnels', 'difficult', 'not', 'become', 'immersed', 'fun', 'uncovering', 'clues', 'discovering', 'secrets', 'venturous', 'duo.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

However, I was hoping that they would do the same as they did with THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, and issue this elaborate two-disk dvd package complete with a map of Ember and the fragmented Builders instruction sheet.I was not troubled without having a lot of back story details. After all, the people living in Ember had forgotten the reasons of why they were living underground in the first place. I was a little shaken up with the idea of people eating 200 year plus canned and packaged food. No wonder it was time to back up, and leave Ember. All someone had to do was look at the expiration date on the packaging! There is no sense of population control that you have in the film THX 1138, and there is only  blessing is of electricity by the Builders.The two young friends, Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) did a great job in their roles. I only wish we had more on air time for Bill Murray and Martin Landau.  I am sure the character of ""Sul"" played by Martin Landau was just as it was in the book, a pipe worker who spent a lot of time sleeping, but knows when he needs to do his job. I could not help think of his (uncredited part) of Peter Van Garrett in the creepy SLEEPY HOLLOW film.  Tim Robbins had just enough air time, and was perfect in his role. The only thing I was a little miffed by was the INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM mine car/boat ride to exit the City of Ember. Hey! It will work as an amusement park ride one day. After all it is a children's movie (I said to myself), but thought the Builders would have came up with a better way to exit the city. I suppose it had to be just as hard for someone to get out, and even more difficult for others to get in. The City of Ember is hard to find from the surface of the planet, and hard for the Aliens to discover its location. You wiped us out, so we are crawling in our hole, and hope you get tired and leave by the time we decide to come out.I thought that the movie was a lot better than such films as BRIDGE OF TERABITHIA which is really more of a (not-so-good) after School Special than a theater release film. I think the films holds its own on the same level to other similar classic such as LOGAN'S RUN, and DARK CITY. In a lot of ways the film is very much like DARK CITY where their memories of the day have been wiped clean as they sleep in eternal darkness. The City of Ember's inhabitants have had their memories wiped clean because there appears to be only one book which is in the possession of the Mayor Cole who is more interested in making sure he as more food than everyone else in the City. There is no mass media, no folklore or mythology other than what they they created after they were entombed in the City of Ember. They lost the knowledge of why there were there, and how long they would have to stay. No wonder they also forgot how to read the meaning of expiration dates on food packaging. Like the Village in the PRISONER television series, the children have to realize that they are freemen, and should search for Sanctuary like in LOGAN'S RUN. If it really exists?The CITY OF EMBER is a fairy tale for all young adults. It evokes utopias and dystoias from Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS to THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN. Thank goodness the film was not made by Tim Burton who would have made it much darker. The movie holds its own, and perhaps should not be compared to the book. The film is largely about generation gaps and what happens when that is woven around a city that is dying and corrupted. The parents and the older generations have given up on the dream. In the spirit of the WIZARD OF OZ, a child (or children) can fix things that adults have messed up, or given up on.It is too bad the film received such poor box office performance because I would love to see a prequel and a sequel. I definitely would liked to have seen a longer movie to learn more about what life is like in the City of Ember. I was not bothered by a lot of missing information or detail not revealed in the film. People are left in the dark, and never are aware that they are living in an underground city. The movie goes forward, and we are never left with they question, ""Why don't they grow mushrooms in their underground city?"" Answer is, ""Because they don't know they are living underground!""The film was filmed in Belfast, Northern Ireland in the Titanic-Quarter area of the city. So the sound stage for the City of Ember was filmed was the same space where the HMS Titanic was constructed. That is how big of a sound stage area they needed to construct the sets. So in a sense you get the feeling that the inhabitants are sealed up in the Titanic, and the sea water is getting to the electrical wiring.Bill Murray did a great job as Mayor Cole. He is the Mayor Cole of the original book.  The film is not the leading role as GROUNDHOG DAY, or GHOSTBUSTERS, but it is always a treat to see Bill Murray in any film. Do more comedy-horror, science fiction and fantasy films, Bill! I don't have a burning desire to see you in a western on a horse.",5,"The Groundhog says ""Winter is over!,"" and its time to crawl out of the borrow!",1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,5759,"['had',

Now, two centuries after the founding, the city is counting down towards its own collapse, as its life support technology crumbles and stores of food dwindle.Some, like Lena's mother, just smile and go back to their singing. Others, like Doon's father, have already tried escape of their own, and failed. Yet others, like Bill Murray's venal mayor, hear the clock ticking as clearly as anyone, and take that as cue to grab what they can and crush the rest.
