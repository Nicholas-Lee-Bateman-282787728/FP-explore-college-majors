The re-recorded, perviously aborted sessions for the Lucipher Rising soundtrack does not count as new or relevant btw. I digress. Back to Robert.I've seen him live many times and this DVD is just the tip of the iceberg that his live performances can be.Don't expect 1973 Zeppelin-like energy cause this is a different band, same singer , and a new medium.Long story short - get out there and see him live, then buy this DVDPeace!",5,Robert's Planet,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,701,"['last', 'twelve', 'years', 'Plant', 'been', 'very', 'active', 'creative', 'great', 'form', 'wish', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'conteporaries', 'namely', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'who', 'been', 'threatening', 'release', 'new', 'music', 'last', 'several', 'years.We', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'hear/see', 'new', 'music', 're-recorded', 'perviously', 'aborted', 'sessions', 'Lucipher', 'Rising', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'count', 'new', 'relevant', 'btw', 'digress', 'Back', 'Robert.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'many', 'times', 'DVD', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'live', 'performances', 'can', 'be.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', '1973', 'Zeppelin-like', 'energy', 'cause', 'different', 'band', 'same', 'singer', 'new', 'medium.Long', 'story', 'short', 'get', 'there', 'see', 'live', 'then', 'buy', 'DVDPeace']",Live From The Artists Den
1546767,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B0085HWZ9Y,"John Werner ""JWW""","[13, 15]","If you are in any way like-minded to my thinking you'd say Robert Plant began an excellent ""Americana Roots"" influenced musical journey with Raising Sand which quite unexpectedly ramped up to a more emotively charged height with Band of Joy.  In fact, I was so personally drawn to this group's music that I eagerly looked forward to their next album and tour.  Well, that is not to be, apparently...But, by leaving us with an excellent concert on DVD and Blu-Ray, Plant has left us with a searing document of just how fantastic this band was.  I stress this is not just Plant with a backing band, it is a real band in the truest sense as this concert unequivocally proves.I was a bit slow to get on board as I found myself, after the initial honeymoon phase, not reaching for the Raising Sand CD very often.  Then I watched the BBC's Live at Electric Proms with Robert Plant and Band of Joy.  Wow!  Immediately this concert became a long-term favorite right up with the likes of such stellar concert DVDs at ""Concert for George"", ""The Last Waltz"", and my boot of Brian Wilson (& his band The Wondermints) at Glastonbury Festival.  I had to get the CD, which while not as quite as powerful as seeing the band live is wonderful and remains one I am drawn to.  This is a case where a live concert is even better than the CD which the tour supports.The BBC show isn't, AFAIK, available as a DVD.  You can find it to burn to DVD if you know the usual places to look for this kind of stuff.  That really doesn't matter very much, however, because if I had to pick one: this one is the winner by a bit more than a nose, IMHO.  While they are both similar they have some important differences.  The BBC show has a finale with a full choir, but pushing this concert over the top is the middle stretch where Miller, Scott, and Griffin unique talents are showcased to a point that is brilliant.  That plus Plant and company's Zep reworkings, added in this part, drive it over the top.  It is uniformly excellent in all categories.  Keep in mind that I am saying this before the DVD or BD is out because my recording of it from the PBS broadcast is superlative and the even better sound, and likely even crisper (if that is possible) video of an official release will assuredly raise the bar - I look forward to delivery of the Blu-Ray from Amazon!For me the knock-out unexpected centerpiece is fairly left-field. I am referring to Darrell's rendition, of all things, an old Porter Wagoner song: ""A Satisfied Mind"".  This warrants another ""Wow""!  Plant is selfless in allowing this group to contribute individually as well as collectively.  As mentioned Miller, Scott, and Griffin literally ""tear-it-up"" as they each take centerstage.  Not to forget the killer rhythym section of Byron House on bass and Marco Giovino on percussion.  Just listen to the fuzzed out electric bass (like on Move Up) as well as the articulate acoustic bass playing of House, it really is amazing.  Giovino's understanding of how to create texture is unsurpased as he's both fleet feeted with a lot of finesse as well as very heavy (Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down)...Brilliant percussive work!Well, to me any way, this is Robert Plant's real ""second coming"" and this DVD is all one should need to observe that.  This is one concert I truly have no complaints other than I wish it was even longer!",5,Perhaps An Even Better Show Than BBC's Live At Electric Proms,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3366,"['are', 'way', 'like-minded', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'say', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'began', 'excellent', 'Americana', 'Roots', 'influenced', 'musical', 'journey', 'Raising', 'Sand', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'ramped', 'up', 'more', 'emotively', 'charged', 'height', 'Band', 'Joy', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'personally', 'drawn', 'group', 'music', 'eagerly', 'looked', 'forward', 'next', 'album', 'tour', 'Well', 'not', 'be', 'apparently', 'leaving', 'excellent', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Plant', 'left', 'searing', 'document', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'band', 'was', 'stress', 'not', 'just', 'Plant', 'backing', 'band', 'real', 'band', 'truest', 'sense', 'concert', 'unequivocally', 'proves.I', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'get', 'board', 'found', 'initial', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'not', 'reaching', 'Raising', 'Sand', 'CD', 'very', 'often', 'Then', 'watched', 'BBC', 'Live', 'Electric', 'Proms', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'Band', 'Joy', 'Wow', 'Immediately', 'concert', 'became', 'long-term', 'favorite', 'right', 'up', 'likes', 'such', 'stellar', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'Concert', 'George', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'boot', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'band', 'Wondermints', 'Glastonbury', 'Festival', 'had', 'get', 'CD', 'not', 'as', 'quite', 'as', 'powerful', 'seeing', 'band', 'live', 'wonderful', 'one', 'am', 'drawn', 'case', 'where', 'live', 'concert', 'even', 'better', 'CD', 'tour', 'supports.The', 'BBC', 'show', ""n't"", 'AFAIK', 'available', 'DVD', 'can', 'find', 'burn', 'DVD', 'know', 'usual', 'places', 'look', 'kind', 'stuff', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'very', 'much', 'however', 'had', 'pick', 'one', 'one', 'winner', 'bit', 'more', 'nose', 'IMHO', 'are', 'similar', 'have', 'important', 'differences', 'BBC', 'show', 'finale', 'full', 'choir', 'pushing', 'concert', 'top', 'middle', 'stretch', 'where', 'Miller', 'Scott', 'Griffin', 'unique', 'talents', 'are', 'showcased', 'point', 'brilliant', 'Plant', 'company', 'Zep', 'reworkings', 'added', 'part', 'drive', 'top', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'categories', 'Keep', 'mind', 'am', 'saying', 'DVD', 'BD', 'out', 'recording', 'PBS', 'broadcast', 'superlative', 'even', 'better', 'sound', 'likely', 'even', 'crisper', 'possible', 'video', 'official', 'release', 'will', 'assuredly', 'raise', 'bar', 'look', 'forward', 'delivery', 'Blu-Ray', 'Amazon', 'knock-out', 'unexpected', 'centerpiece', 'fairly', 'left-field', 'am', 'referring', 'Darrell', 'rendition', 'things', 'old', 'Porter', 'Wagoner', 'song', 'Satisfied', 'Mind', 'warrants', 'Wow', 'Plant', 'selfless', 'allowing', 'group', 'contribute', 'individually', 'as', 'well', 'collectively', 'mentioned', 'Miller', 'Scott', 'Griffin', 'literally', 'tear-it-up', 'take', 'centerstage', 'Not', 'forget', 'killer', 'rhythym', 'section', 'Byron', 'House', 'bass', 'Marco', 'Giovino', 'percussion', 'Just', 'listen', 'fuzzed', 'out', 'electric', 'bass', 'Move', 'Up', 'as', 'well', 'articulate', 'acoustic', 'bass', 'playing', 'House', 'really', 'amazing', 'Giovino', 'understanding', 'how', 'create', 'texture', 'unsurpased', 'fleet', 'feeted', 'lot', 'finesse', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'heavy', 'Satan', 'Kingdom', 'Must', 'Come', 'Down', 'Brilliant', 'percussive', 'work', 'Well', 'way', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'real', 'second', 'coming', 'DVD', 'one', 'should', 'need', 'observe', 'one', 'concert', 'truly', 'have', 'complaints', 'other', 'wish', 'was', 'even', 'longer']",Live From The Artists Den

I just think he's about as close as one can ever be.The fact that he has been singing, writing, playing for somewhere in the neighbourhood of half a century and can and does still seek out new ways to express and share his gifts is uniquely remarkable in itself.In working with Alison Krauss - a combination few if any but T. Bone Burnett could have conceived - he won 5 Grammy Awards at the age of 60.  Every catagory in which they were nominated including Album of the Year.Band of Joy is another pivot giving a different perspective.  Whether he can hit high notes or not is, to me irrelevant.  As with Krauss, he can take Zeppelin tunes and give them new life and a beauty that was, perhaps before unseen.  His voice is every bit as remarkable, beautiful and emotively expressive as ever it was.  A whisper of a lyric with a bit of blues and soul embellishment is every bit the equal of the gut-wrenching screams from his Zeppelin days.He is also a fantastic interview.  Humour, self-deprecation, insight, intelligent, always seeking, honesty without tedious detail.  The rather impish twinkle that has always been in his eyes reflects, I think, a love of life and exploration.  Learning, openness, fearlessness and the burning urge to squeeze every drop out of life.  What more could one ask.  Working with other great artists ?  He's got that too.",5,Plant & Band of Joy - Artist's Den,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,1428,"['what', ""'m"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'perfect', 'just', 'think', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'be.The', 'fact', 'been', 'singing', 'writing', 'playing', 'somewhere', 'neighbourhood', 'century', 'can', 'still', 'seek', 'out', 'new', 'ways', 'express', 'share', 'gifts', 'uniquely', 'remarkable', 'itself.In', 'working', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'combination', 'few', 'T.', 'Bone', 'Burnett', 'could', 'have', 'conceived', 'won', '5', 'Grammy', 'Awards', 'age', '60', 'catagory', 'were', 'nominated', 'including', 'Album', 'Year.Band', 'Joy', 'pivot', 'giving', 'different', 'perspective', 'can', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'not', 'irrelevant', 'Krauss', 'can', 'take', 'Zeppelin', 'tunes', 'give', 'new', 'life', 'beauty', 'was', 'perhaps', 'unseen', 'voice', 'bit', 'remarkable', 'beautiful', 'emotively', 'expressive', 'ever', 'was', 'whisper', 'lyric', 'bit', 'blues', 'soul', 'embellishment', 'bit', 'equal', 'gut-wrenching', 'screams', 'Zeppelin', 'days.He', 'also', 'fantastic', 'interview', 'Humour', 'self-deprecation', 'insight', 'intelligent', 'always', 'seeking', 'honesty', 'tedious', 'detail', 'rather', 'impish', 'twinkle', 'always', 'been', 'eyes', 'think', 'love', 'life', 'exploration', 'Learning', 'openness', 'fearlessness', 'burning', 'urge', 'squeeze', 'drop', 'life', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'ask', 'Working', 'other', 'great', 'artists', 'got', 'too']",Live From The Artists Den
1546771,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0085HWZ9Y,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 4]","Before I begin my review, I want state up front that I did not come to this highly entertaining DVD from the point of a Led Zeppelin or Robert Plant fan, as many of the previous reviewers her have. In fact I don't even own one Led Zep album.I first saw (and heard) Plant performing with Alison Krauss at the Americana Music Awards in Nashville, on the eve of their embarking on the ""Raising Sand"" CD and tour. It was Krauss, and the incomparable guitarist/singer/producer Buddy Miller - the music director for that evening- that brought me to see Plant. I wasn't sure what to expect (and neither was the audience at the Awards Show) but we were all drawn in.After the Raising Sand project, Plant decided he like the ""Americana"" mode and used Miller to put together the Band of Joy. Nashville music stalwarts Byron House (bass) and Darrell Scott (multi-instrumentalist, but also a songwriter with a string of CDs to his credit) were brought in. Singer-songwriter Patty Griffin joined the group and subsequently married Plant in the last month. And there there was Miller holding it all together like glue.This ""concert"" was staged in Nashville specifically for the Live at The Artists Den television series and - as others have pointed out - it differs some from the national tour by the group. It runs 77 minutes (to fit TV schedules) so those who saw the tour will find songs missing.As for performance, I thought the band was in fine form and everyone got their own spotlight (not just the rock icon whose name is three times the size of the band's on the DVD cover. They work as a team with each member supporting the other.There are a few interview segments included and then a longer (nearly 30-minute) interview with Plant as a bonus.I'll leave it to my fellow reviewers to provide more details but just say that this is an interesting crossover concept where a British rocker gets to ""Americana"" and Nashville's best musicians get to rock out too!I've never seen any of the other ""Live From The Artists Den"" shows but, after seeing this DVD I'm looking forward to watching more.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Led Zep lead joins Nashville's finest musicians (and his soon to be future wife) for a great ""Americana"" concert acknowledging b",1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,2176,"['begin', 'review', 'want', 'state', 'up', 'front', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'point', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'fan', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'own', 'one', 'Led', 'Zep', 'album.I', 'first', 'saw', 'heard', 'Plant', 'performing', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'Americana', 'Music', 'Awards', 'Nashville', 'eve', 'embarking', 'Raising', 'Sand', 'CD', 'tour', 'was', 'Krauss', 'incomparable', 'guitarist/singer/producer', 'Buddy', 'Miller', 'music', 'director', 'evening-', 'brought', 'see', 'Plant', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'audience', 'Awards', 'Show', 'were', 'drawn', 'in.After', 'Raising', 'Sand', 'project', 'Plant', 'decided', 'Americana', 'mode', 'used', 'Miller', 'put', 'together', 'Band', 'Joy', 'Nashville', 'music', 'Byron', 'House', 'bass', 'Darrell', 'Scott', 'multi-instrumentalist', 'also', 'songwriter', 'string', 'CDs', 'credit', 'were', 'brought', 'Singer-songwriter', 'Patty', 'Griffin', 'joined', 'group', 'subsequently', 'married', 'Plant', 'last', 'month', 'was', 'Miller', 'holding', 'together', 'glue.This', 'concert', 'was', 'staged', 'Nashville', 'specifically', 'Live', 'Artists', 'Den', 'television', 'series', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'national', 'tour', 'group', '77', 'minutes', 'fit', 'TV', 'schedules', 'so', 'who', 'saw', 'tour', 'will', 'find', 'songs', 'missing.As', 'performance', 'thought', 'band', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'everyone', 'got', 'own', 'spotlight', 'not', 'just', 'rock', 'icon', 'name', 'three', 'times', 'size', 'band', 'DVD', 'cover', 'work', 'team', 'member', 'supporting', 'other.There', 'are', 'few', 'interview', 'segments', 'included', 'then', 'longer', 'nearly', '30-minute', 'interview', 'Plant', 'bonus.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'provide', 'more', 'details', 'just', 'say', 'interesting', 'crossover', 'concept', 'where', 'British', 'rocker', 'Americana', 'Nashville', 'best', 'musicians', 'get', 'rock', 'out', 'too', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'Live', 'Artists', 'Den', 'shows', 'seeing', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'more.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Live From The Artists Den
