She is a relevation and I was in awe of her range. She hasn't appeared in a lot of films but I can definitely see a star in the making. The storyline is great, the music is timeless, and the acting is flawless, even Tim McGraw proves he is more than just a country singer. Dirty Girl left me with a huge smile on my face, it's a fun coming-of-age film.

In Dirty Girl, first-time writer/director Abe Sylvia makes things even harder for himself by setting the film in the nostalgic 1980s and promising a subversive edginess in his titular protagonist, a promiscuous high schooler named Danielle who embarks on a cross-country road trip with an unlikely partner in crime: a closeted bisexual classmate named Clarke. Unfortunately, Sylvia fails to bring it all together and make it work; I found Dirty Girl tame and uneven, never quite bringing the Dirty and then trying to tie it all up in a sentimental bow that's wholly unearned. Despite an experienced cast that includes William H. Macy and Mary Steenburgen, Dirty Girl isn't worth watching.",1,Dirty Girl,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,938,"['may', 'not', 'seem', 'obviously', 'so', 'coming-of-age', 'films', 'are', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'balance', 'one', 'must', 'maintain', 'order', 'offer', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sentimentality', 'crossing', 'over', 'schmaltz', 'tricky', 'feat', 'master', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'first-time', 'writer/director', 'Abe', 'Sylvia', 'things', 'even', 'harder', 'setting', 'film', 'nostalgic', '1980s', 'promising', 'subversive', 'edginess', 'titular', 'protagonist', 'promiscuous', 'high', 'schooler', 'named', 'Danielle', 'who', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'unlikely', 'partner', 'crime', 'closeted', 'bisexual', 'classmate', 'named', 'Clarke', 'Unfortunately', 'Sylvia', 'bring', 'together', 'make', 'work', 'found', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'tame', 'uneven', 'never', 'quite', 'bringing', 'Dirty', 'then', 'trying', 'tie', 'up', 'sentimental', 'bow', 'wholly', 'unearned', 'experienced', 'cast', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Dirty', 'Girl', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching']",Dirty Girl
1505753,A9CHQYIX61N1T,B005Z9MGRG,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","Abe Sylvia, writer and director of Dirty Girl, brings ten years as a dancer and choreographer on Broadway into his debut feature film.  It goes without saying that Dirty Girl is filled with a slew of nostalgic music hits such as Teena Marie's Lovegirl, Melissa Manchester's Don't Cry Out Loud, and The Outfield's Your Love, and dance scenes that liven certain character roles. Dirty Girl is set in Oklahoma during the 1980's and centers around Danielle (Juno Temple) and Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), two high school misfits who become friends through fate and chance. Danielle is the natural born rebel that has a bad reputation, has a killer body and drives around looking for trouble in a red mustang.Clarke is an overweight, witty, closeted virgin, and suffers the emotional and physical abuse of his domineering, homophobic father, Joseph (Dwight Yoakum).  If Joseph finds out Clarke is gay, he will send him to military school. Danielle's unruly behavior forces the school principal to send her to remedial class where she is paired up with Clarke to complete a parenting project. Danielle is disrespectful and bitter towards her mother, Sue-Ann (Milla Jovovich), and Sue-Ann's Mormon fianc&eacute; Ray (William H. Macy), maybe because she feels left out or maybe she doesn't connect with the new future her mother is embracing. Either way, Danielle recruits Clarke to go with her to California to locate Danny Briggs (Tim McGaw), the father she never met.Finding the rebel inside of him, Clarke takes Joseph's prized Cadillac and his parent's credit card to finance the getaway trip.  Danielle and Clarke learn and laugh at each other along the journey. They even pick up Joel (Nicholas d'Agosto), a stripper who Clarke eventually becomes intimate with. The fun comes to a halt when Joseph reports his car stolen to the police and catches up with the two.  Clarke stays with Joseph to take the beatings while Danielle forges ahead to California. When she reaches Danny Briggs, he's not interested in a father-daughter relationship.  Both Danielle and Clarke were forced to grow up quickly under their dysfunctional family circumstances.In the end, the truth has set them both free.  Clarke is now out of the closet with his mother, Peggy (Mary Steenburgen) and Danielle realized her mother loved her enough to not to have an abortion. Dirty Girl is a creative and exciting movie. Each cast member holds their own when shifting between neuroses and normalcy. Director Abe Sylvia was very crafty with keeping the music in tow when tough scenes emerged. Overall, Dirty Girl is fun to watch and is a great first start for Director Abe Sylvia to build upon.",4,Dirty Girl,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2653,"['Abe', 'Sylvia', 'writer', 'director', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'ten', 'years', 'dancer', 'choreographer', 'Broadway', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'saying', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'filled', 'slew', 'nostalgic', 'music', 'hits', 'such', 'Teena', 'Marie', 'Lovegirl', 'Melissa', 'Manchester', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Out', 'Loud', 'Outfield', 'Your', 'Love', 'dance', 'scenes', 'liven', 'certain', 'character', 'roles', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'set', 'Oklahoma', '1980', 'centers', 'Danielle', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Clarke', 'Jeremy', 'Dozier', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'misfits', 'who', 'become', 'friends', 'fate', 'chance', 'Danielle', 'natural', 'born', 'rebel', 'bad', 'reputation', 'killer', 'body', 'around', 'looking', 'trouble', 'red', 'mustang.Clarke', 'overweight', 'witty', 'closeted', 'virgin', 'emotional', 'physical', 'abuse', 'domineering', 'homophobic', 'father', 'Joseph', 'Dwight', 'Yoakum', 'Joseph', 'out', 'Clarke', 'gay', 'will', 'send', 'military', 'school', 'Danielle', 'unruly', 'behavior', 'forces', 'school', 'principal', 'send', 'remedial', 'class', 'where', 'paired', 'up', 'Clarke', 'complete', 'parenting', 'project', 'Danielle', 'disrespectful', 'bitter', 'towards', 'mother', 'Sue-Ann', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Sue-Ann', 'Mormon', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ray', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'maybe', 'left', 'out', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'connect', 'new', 'future', 'mother', 'embracing', 'way', 'Danielle', 'Clarke', 'go', 'California', 'locate', 'Danny', 'Briggs', 'Tim', 'McGaw', 'father', 'never', 'met.Finding', 'rebel', 'inside', 'Clarke', 'Joseph', 'prized', 'Cadillac', 'parent', 'credit', 'card', 'finance', 'getaway', 'trip', 'Danielle', 'Clarke', 'learn', 'laugh', 'other', 'journey', 'even', 'pick', 'up', 'Joel', 'Nicholas', ""d'Agosto"", 'stripper', 'who', 'Clarke', 'eventually', 'intimate', 'fun', 'halt', 'when', 'Joseph', 'car', 'stolen', 'police', 'up', 'two', 'Clarke', 'Joseph', 'take', 'beatings', 'Danielle', 'ahead', 'California', 'When', 'Danny', 'Briggs', 'not', 'interested', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'Danielle', 'Clarke', 'were', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'quickly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'end', 'truth', 'set', 'free', 'Clarke', 'now', 'closet', 'mother', 'Peggy', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Danielle', 'realized', 'mother', 'loved', 'enough', 'not', 'have', 'abortion', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'creative', 'exciting', 'movie', 'cast', 'member', 'own', 'when', 'shifting', 'neuroses', 'normalcy', 'Director', 'Abe', 'Sylvia', 'was', 'very', 'crafty', 'keeping', 'music', 'tow', 'when', 'tough', 'scenes', 'emerged', 'Overall', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'fun', 'watch', 'great', 'first', 'start', 'Director', 'Abe', 'Sylvia', 'build', 'upon']",Dirty Girl
1505754,A1CK5G1VZ7QDRD,B005Z9MGRG,A. Thurston,"[1, 5]","Having read an early review when Dirty Girl got a very limited release(9 theaters what's up with that ?) and then watching the trailer I decided that I needed to see this film.It's the debut film of Abe Sylvia who's done a lot of Broadway work and some tv and short  films previously. Mr.Sylvia gets some things right and other things not so much. He also wrote the story so he's to blame here as well.And away we go the film is based on 2 characters the wild child Danielle played excellently by the petite and pretty Juno Temple and the shy,closeted gay character Clarke played excellently by Jeremy Dozier. Both are high school students at Norman Oklahoma High school in the year 1987. Danielle has the reputation of being shall we say a slut ? She wears provocative clothes,acts and talks in overly sexual ways and generally freaks out the  crowd of christian conservatives that seem to overrun Norman. After 1 too many rebellious episodes Danielle is sent to the Challengers class aka the special ed class. There she ends up being paired with the quiet reserved and chubby Clarke .The class project they are assigned is the parenting skills challenge.Each couple has a 5 lb bag of flour that they are to treat as if it were an actual child they were caring for.On a side note they actually do have classes like this or at least they did when I  was in High School back in the 80's. This is more than ironic as both Danielle and Clarke come from messed up to the max families. Danielle's Mom played quite nicely by Milla Jovovich is a former floozy who's been a less than stellar Mom and is trying to find redemption by marrying the Mormon and self righteous Ray (William H Macy ) .Danielle never knew her biological father other than what Sue Ann(Mom) has told her and from a small photo of him. Meanwhile poor Clarke has to deal with a bully of a Dad played with menace and a sense of pathos by Dwight Yoakum.His mother Peggy is a timid wallflower of a gal intimidated by husband Joseph played smartly by all world actress Mary Steenburgen. Peggy you can tell loves Clarke no matter if he's maybe gay or not.Joseph is a homo phobe to the extent that he berates Clarke endlessly about it.This of course would include therapy to try and ""straighten out"" Clarke and threats to ship him off to Military school to make  a real man out of him. After reluctantly paired together the sassy Danielle and the low key Clarke start a tepid relationship. Danielle knows Clarke is gay and is fine with that which is a relief to Clarke after he clumsily tries to act straight and seduce Danielle. It takes time but these two lost children find that they actually have some things in common and become friends. Danielle has a major falling out with Sue Ann and Ray and is hellbent on finding her real father.Meanwhile Clarke's Dad has gone off the deep end and assaults Clarke causing Clarke to flee in his Dads prized Cadillac. So feeling the need to get the hell out of Oklahoma they end up on a quest to find Danielle's Dad Danny (Tim McGraw) who's living in Fresno California now.They take their flour child now dubbed Joan (as in Joan Jett for Danielle and Joan Crawford for Clarke) and head west.Along the way they learn a lot of life's lessons and about each other.They pick up a hunky male stripper named Joel ( Nicholas D'Agasto) who in a sweet and thankfully non explicit way takes Clarke's virginity .Trouble ensues when all the parents find out what's gone on and each reacts in their own way.Joseph ends up in jail for B&E at Sue Ann's house.Sue Ann and Peggy decide to fly out to Fresno and head off a meeting between Danny and Danielle. The climax of the film is when our two mismatched friends are caught and split up with Joseph dragging Clarke back to Norman and Danielle fleeing for Fresno.Danielle makes it to Danny's abode in Fresno and I will not spoil things by revealing what happens. Where I had issues with the film were some of the set ups were either ridiculous or so cliche that it made you groan.Abe needed someone else to help him tighten up the story for one thing.The characters are all thinly drawn and if the actors were lesser talents this film would've been a disaster. Temple is amazing you learn to love Danielle warts and all and she could have been a bad joke of a character .Clarke could have been an even more stereotypical Gay character played for yucks in a less able actors hands than Dozier's. I found the set ups and little ribs as in ha,ha aint we clever annoying and take away from the character.Not being Gay myself I don't know if the stereotype's displayed here are offensive to the average gay viewer or not. One thing that was cute was how the flour aka Joan had changeable facial expressions and showed a range of facial expressions that were funny . Both Steenburgen and Jovovich are good as the respective Mom's. You'd expect that from Steenbergen who's an award winning actress of note but Jovovich noted more for her good looks than acting chops more than hold her own. I wish that Abe Sylvia had gotten some outside help on the story as it's really good in spots I even almost cried at one point. Really Dirty Girl is a good film that should have been a great one. i look forward to seeing the lovely Ms.Juno Temple for many years to come.",3,Good acting almost saves cliche loaded film

1505756,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B005Z9MGRG,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[3, 3]","Some time ago, I watched the trailer for ""Dirty Girl,"" and I told myself that I needed to see this film - it looked really funny. However, having finally watched the whole movie, my impression is now a little bit different. Yes, it is funny, as I saw in the trailer, but it switches to drama probably after the first half, and the result is just fascinating, a delightful surprise, a little undiscovered gem.The story takes place in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1987, and we immediately meet Danielle (Juno Temple), an incredibly flirtatious and vivacious young lady that is attending high school. It seems that she is only interested in boys and having fun, and getting away with anything she wants. Her three Ds of dating are: discriminate, designate, and dump. However, her world begins to crumble when the principal calls her to his office, informing her that she was going to be removed from her regular class and dumped in the ""challenge"" class, which is attended by problematic students. She reluctantly has to accept the demotion - for a lack of a better word - and joins that group. There, she is assigned to work on a project with Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), another student, who happens to be fat and of her dislike. However, they do need to do that project or they will fail school, so they put their act together, and, in doing so, they discover and/or realize some of their problems and deep secrets. This search will take them to Los Angeles in a joint adventure, without their parents knowing about it. On the way, they share some hilarious moments as well as some sad ones -a true life-changing experience for all involved, including us.""Dirty Girl"" will really surprise you. Mixing comedy and drama can be fatal most of the times, but director Abe Sylvia somehow does it successfully. This is a story about broken homes and dysfunctional families, and their long-term effects. It really touched me. Juno Temple and Jeremy Dozier are amazing, and the fantastic cast - Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, Dwight Yoakam, and the always dependable Mary Steenburgen -- provide great support. The DVD includes commentary by the director and deleted and extended scenes.

You, me, and Robin saw Luke Perry walking down the street, we hung out with the sea lions, and I paid the all-day parking fee because your sister lost the garage ticket.Good times, everyone. But, on to this review...Just because I had a passing acquaintance with the filmmaker doesn't mean I would give a good review. No, I watched this film twice over a six-month period to get the full feeling of the film, and I only have one word: LOVE! This movie is crafted and written with care and heart, and is brought to life by a stellar cast and a fast-paced storyline arc laced with fab 80's songs. Juno Temple plays Danielle, a promiscuous high schooler/wild child in late 80's Oklahoma.  Danielle's reputation as the school trollop is given a new level of indignity when she is sent to ""Challengers,"" the basement ghetto for marginalized and underperforming students at Norman High. Enter Danielle, a hair-tossing, attitude-laced, short-skirted dynamo who meets her polar opposite in Challengers: Clark (a career-making debut for Jeremy Dozier), a repressed, overweight, and withdrawn classmate who's  been labeled a ""f&g.;""  Danielle and Clark get off to a rocky start when they're paired off as parents of a ""flour sack"" baby which will ostensibly demonstrate to them the permanence and commitment of raising a baby. (Yes, there was a rumor that they did this exact curriculum in my high school's home ec class!) Cut to Clark's sexual orientation therapy, Danielle's spirited confrontation with her Mormon stepfather-to-be (played by William Macy) and the violence Clark endures at the hand of his abusive dad (played with creepy authenticity by Dwight Yoakam, countered with Clark's oppressed mom ( Mary Steenburgen in a memorable characterization). Things come to a bubbling head when a classroom assignment leads Danielle and Clark to a long-buried secret of Danielle's mother Sue Ellen (Milla Jovovich), a struggling single mom. When Clark's father has a meltdown, a road trip ensues, and before long Clark and Danielle are singing, fighting, and running from the law in a mid-80's Cadillac on a cross-country quest for identity and love. I won't give away al the details, beacause you should watch the film unfold yourself. This movie isn't simple to characterize: is it a gay ""coming-out"" story, a story of power struggles and disparity of relationships, the surprising alliances we find ourselves in, the dangers of labeling people, or the strength of friendship? It's all of those things and more; it's funny, full of heart, music, and message that we have to be strong and proud of who we inherently are.

Half way through the gem I paused the DVD, went on line, and purchased this movie.  Not only was I happy with Dwight's performance and want to add the movie to his other films on my own shelf; I want to be able to watch this delightfully touching film over and over.  It was so much more than what I expected it to be based on the snippets of description I had read.Juno Temple, who provided viewers with an excellent performance in 'Killer Joe', one again was amazingly natural, believable, and totally immersed in her character.  Jeremy Dozier I was not at all familiar with.  I had not seen him in any other film, and indeed, he has not been in my full-length movies, but he definitely should be appearing on the screen a great deal more.  He is an excellent actor and handled this part perfectly.  The each member of the well-known cast comprised of Mary Steenburgen, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy, Dwight Yoakam, and Tim McGraw, as well as lesser known, but busy, performers such as Nicholas D. Agosto, Brent Briscoe, and Gary Grubbs, gave sterling pitch-perfect and thoroughly natural performances.This was a lovely story and evoked an equal number of laughs and tears and was just a joy to watch. The sound track, heavily laced with Mellisa Manchester performances was very enjoyable and very well matched to the story.The DVD contains a commentary, as well as deleted scenes, and has closed captions.I thoroughly recommend this film and wish those in charge of such things had provided more appropriate art work to pitch the film and a more accurate description of the film for advertising so that more movie watchers would be interested in renting this wonderful little movie.

1505768,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005Z9MGRG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 13]","Despite my better instincts, I'd have to call writer/director Abe Sylvia's ""Dirty Girl"" fairly irresistible.  I'm not usually so soft-hearted, but a spirited cast led me to let go of my reservations and just go with the flow.  And I quite enjoyed ""Dirty Girl"" on those terms.  It may lack a bit of originality, but it's just so darned likable.  Yes, the movie employs every tired cliche expected in a road trip comedy.  Yes, the movie revisits the common themes of a hundred different coming-of-age sagas.  Yes, many of the peripheral characters are garishly over-the-top as are the eighties set pieces.  Yes, the film sometimes plays to easy punchlines, especially in relationship to homosexual themes.  Yes, the movie has some of the most patently ridiculous scenes you might imagine (wait until you catch a nightly striptease contest in rural Nevada!  The fact that it is a nightly event only scratches the surface of why it is so preposterous).  And yet, here I am recommending the movie.  It has a surprisingly big heart and a winning underdog duo with leads Juno Temple and newcomer Jeremy Dozier.  So in spite of my reservations, I found the movie undeniably fun.  And there's nothing wrong with that!In truth, ""Dirty Girl"" is a bit all over the place in its tone.  The movie starts with a pleasing nastiness but soon enough morphs into a heart-on-its-sleeve buddy comedy.  It sets off eliciting shock value but speedily evolves into a family weepy.  ""Dirty Girl,"" despite its salacious title and a few risque situations, is not nearly as edgy and confrontational as the early scenes would lead you to believe.  It is, at heart, a crowd pleaser that is tinged with real and serious situations but is ultimately a fantasy of sorts.  And viewed in that perspective, it really succeeds with some genuinely heartfelt moments.  And lest I forget, it's also has a lot of laugh-out-loud content.  I won't go into the plot too specifically.  Temple plays a promiscuous high school outsider who is struggling to understand who she is, her mother's new relationship, and the father that she's never known.  Dozier plays another loner who is battling to fulfill his parent's expectations, even though it seems an impossible task as they don't accept him for who he is.  Through movie magic, the two are thrown together and their comedic antagonism is the basis for numerous burgeoning buddy adventures.Of course, the two are both improved by and irrevocably affected by this new bond.  They end up in some precarious and wild situations and a grudging respect blossoms.  In the hands of Temple and Dozier, this central relationship really works.  As long as you care about them, the rest follows suit.  And I did care.  The cast is rounded out with Milla Jovovich (quite good as Temple's mother), William Macy (as Jovovich's fiance) and Mary Steenburgen and Dwight Yoakam as Dozier's conflicted parents.  But in many ways, this is a star-making performance by Juno Temple.  She commands the screen and sells this movie.  I have no doubt that we'll continue to see her in bigger and more prominent roles.  ""Dirty Girl"" is sometimes silly, sometimes sad--but a wildly enjoyable journey.  As a light and engaging diversion, it fits the bill nicely.  Perhaps it's not the perfect comedy I was hoping for, but its pleasures outweigh my intellectual reservations and melted my dead cold heart.

1505771,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B005Z9MGRG,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","Imagine if Alison Lohman had played the Dede Truitt part in ""The Opposite of Sex"" (1998) and subtly inserted a bit of Luna Lovegood into the character, and you will have a pretty good idea of the look and feel of ""Dirty Girl"" (2010).  Full of wisdom disguised as black comedy.The dialogue is not on quite the level of ""The Opposite of Sex"",  especially the voiceover narration; but what is?  Christina Ricci had so much to work with in that film that Roger Ebert commented specifically about the narration provided by her character: ""I hate people who talk during movies, but if she were sitting behind me in the theater, saying all of this stuff, I'd want her to keep right on talking"".Juno Temple (playing ""Dirty Girl's"" title character Danielle Edmondston) does not have as much to work with and her narration is much more conventional.  And since her narration does not contradict the events taking place on the screen,  any depth brought to her character must come from Temple's and Writer/Director Abe Sylvia's acting for the camera abilities.  They are up to the task and Temple non-verbally sells viewers a character who is a lot more that she first appears to be.  Sylvia's storytelling style juxtapositions crude and cute, which dooms the film commercially as there is a limited audience for a film structured around such contrasting elements.The main suspension of disbelief element is Danielle having a classic Mustang convertible at her personal disposal.  This was a moronic choice by Sylvia as there is not time to insert a credible explanation; the car is not just a needless distraction but is also a poor fit for the character whose development would have been better served by something funky like a beat up Volkswagen.Bottom line this is Temple's movie, although she is ably assisted by Jeremy Dozier and Mary Steenburgen (as Danielle's buddy Clarke and his mother).  The other characters are the deliberate stereotypes necessary for economically keeping the focus on Clarke and Danielle.Temple is really starting to take off, she is getting a lot of work and is stepping into the roles that Lohman would be doing if she were ten years younger. And Temple should have additional opportunities as she has more range than Lohman; with a nice off-kilter airhead quality when required. You could see that she was something special back in 2008 when her supporting role in ""Wild Child"" literally stole the movie.  And she has finally overcome the first name confusion with a certain Ellen Page character.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",4,Juno Breaks Out,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2565,"['Imagine', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'had', 'played', 'Dede', 'Truitt', 'part', 'Opposite', 'Sex', '1998', 'subtly', 'inserted', 'bit', 'Luna', 'Lovegood', 'character', 'will', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'look', 'feel', 'Dirty', 'Girl', '2010', 'Full', 'wisdom', 'disguised', 'black', 'comedy.The', 'dialogue', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'especially', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'what', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'film', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'commented', 'specifically', 'narration', 'provided', 'character', 'hate', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'movies', 'were', 'sitting', 'theater', 'saying', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'want', 'keep', 'right', 'talking', '.Juno', 'Temple', 'playing', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'title', 'character', 'Danielle', 'Edmondston', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'work', 'narration', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'narration', 'not', 'contradict', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'depth', 'brought', 'character', 'must', 'come', 'Temple', 'Writer/Director', 'Abe', 'Sylvia', 'acting', 'camera', 'abilities', 'are', 'up', 'task', 'Temple', 'non-verbally', 'viewers', 'character', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'be', 'Sylvia', 'storytelling', 'style', 'juxtapositions', 'crude', 'cute', 'film', 'commercially', 'limited', 'audience', 'film', 'structured', 'such', 'contrasting', 'elements.The', 'main', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'element', 'Danielle', 'having', 'classic', 'Mustang', 'convertible', 'personal', 'disposal', 'was', 'moronic', 'choice', 'Sylvia', 'not', 'time', 'insert', 'credible', 'explanation', 'car', 'not', 'just', 'needless', 'distraction', 'also', 'poor', 'fit', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'something', 'funky', 'beat', 'up', 'Volkswagen.Bottom', 'line', 'Temple', 'movie', 'ably', 'assisted', 'Jeremy', 'Dozier', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Danielle', 'buddy', 'Clarke', 'mother', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'deliberate', 'stereotypes', 'necessary', 'economically', 'keeping', 'focus', 'Clarke', 'Danielle.Temple', 'really', 'starting', 'take', 'off', 'getting', 'lot', 'work', 'stepping', 'roles', 'Lohman', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'were', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'Temple', 'should', 'have', 'additional', 'opportunities', 'more', 'range', 'Lohman', 'nice', 'off-kilter', 'airhead', 'quality', 'when', 'required', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'back', '2008', 'when', 'supporting', 'role', 'Wild', 'Child', 'literally', 'stole', 'movie', 'finally', 'overcome', 'first', 'name', 'confusion', 'certain', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'character.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",Dirty Girl

Macy, and Mary Steenburgen were fabulous in this eye-opening candid look at dysfunctional families and the destructive behavior it creates in the lives of the youngsters.  I was expecting a tongue-in-cheek comedy about the aches and pains of growing up...a genre I thoroughly enjoy a laugh from.  The film is highlighted by spectacular acting.  Juno is a diamond in the rough.  What a talent.  And her gay school buddy Jeremy Dozier is equally as effective.  I don't give away plots.  I just hand out kudos when deserved.  Yes, you'll laugh at the comedy.  Yes, you'll cringe at their behavior from time to time.  And yes, you'll shed a few tears as this unfolds into a LOUD statement of life in broken households.  I was laughing at myself for crying.  Does that make sense?  Then rent or get a copy of this fiick. It needs to be seen by the young and the old.  And don't let the DVD box fool you. It says in the rating box that there is graphic nudity.  There is not one single nude scene.  It is not needed and it would have taken away from development of characters.  I gave it a solid 10.  Juno Temple will someday be on the big stage as an Oscar nominee.  Once I saw this film, I ordered three more of hers in a starring role.  I can't wait to watch them.  What drew me to this film was Mary Steenburgen.  I saw &#34;Last Vegas' two week's ago and I was thoroughly impressed so I looked her up on the IMDB and started perusing her filmography.  This one struck a chord. I made a good choice.  But I CAUTION you.  It does contain profanity and some sick dialogue at the beginning.  But it fits the role(s) of the cast.
