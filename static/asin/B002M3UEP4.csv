Conveniently, it is done by the same director as the Digimon movie, so he's essentially just remaking his own idea. And it's fantastic.When the movie shows the world of OZ, it is joy to watch all of the craziness of a computer virus running wild. This is what you're coming here to watch. The concept of OZ almost makes sense. A social community that evolved to cater to business and transaction and eventually caught on and spread across the world. A lot of the avatars are cutesy little characters that you would imagine when thinking of Japan, but when the serious players step into the spotlight (King Kazma (who is an absolute badass), Love Machine, Natsuke and some of her family members) they are designed more intricately and they stand out.However, the real core of the story is Kenji, Natsuke, and the &#34;Jinnouchi Clan&#34;. Kenji and Natsuke's relationship progresses fairly realistically and the extended family is crazy and you grow to like them just as Kenji does. And, it's one of the few movies that really allows a lot of characters to play a necessary role in the plot. I can't go into it without spoilers, but you'll figure it out when it starts to happen. But, the plan requires, I think, 29 people to pull it off performing a multi-stage plan. And it's really gratifying to see people pull together when times are tough.The animation is top notch, the music is wonderful, and voice acting is great. And yeah, it's got a lot of anime tropes which I normally can't stand, but they're employed non-intrusively, for the most part. Overall, it's a great movie and is now my favorite non-Ghibli anime, thanks to Toonami's movie month.

I recommend purchasing it, though, because this is a great product, and you will be granted the luxury to view it at any time. As for why it is so good; as the description, and other reviews state, on the surface it's about a battle in cyberspace that leads to dire consequences, but it is so much more than that.

1277845,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B002M3UEP4,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 0]","Anime films have been the type to make a major crossover from Japan to the United States when it comes to the US mainstream audience. While anime series typically still remain the realm of the hardcore fans of the genre the stand-alone films get much more love from mainstream critics and audiences in addition to the hardcore. One such film which looks to have made a successful mainstream crossover to the United States was the anime film Summer Wars which was originally released in Japan in August 1, 2009. The film saw it's American debut at film festivals around the country in 2010, but since I saw it in late May 2011 I consider it a 2011 release for me thus qualifying it as one of the best films of 2011.Summer Wars was the project of director Hosada Mamoru whose previous stand-alone anime film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, was well-received by fans and critics alike. Working from a screenplay by Okudera Satoko (adapted from a story written by Hosada himself), Summer Wars was a nice blend of science-fiction, romance and Japanese slice-of-life. The story begins with the introduction and explanation of the OZ on-line community which becomes a major focal point to the film's story and the many characters in it. OZ was explained as an on-line, social networking community which has become so ingrained in the world community that everything anyone does was done through it's portals. Think of OZ was an amalgamation of Facebook, Second Life, iTunes, Netflix and every other social networking site all working under one umbrella. It's a virtual world where people just don't socially interact through games and chat lobbies, but also a place where every real-world store has a portal where people could purchase things online. It's also become a palce where governments from local cities to whole countries have set-up their own areas that would control their cities and countries' infrastructures. It's Facebook on steroids.One of the film's main characters happens to work as a part-time moderator for OZ. Koiso Keiji also happens to be a 17-year old math whiz who would become instrumental in the story to come. The bulk of the story has Keiji being invited by a high school friend in Shinohara Natsuki (explained to him as a job she needs for him to do) to come with her to her family estate where he ends up meeting the rest of Natsuki's very extended family and also it's soon-to-be 90-year old matriarch in Jinnouich Sakae. This part of the film makes up the romance and it's comedic aspect as Keiji gets introduced by Natsuki to her great grandmother Sakae as her boyfriend and future fiance much to Keiji's surprise. As Keiji tries to awkwardly play along with Natsuki's plan the second part of the film's story kick's in as he inadvertently assist someone or something into hacking into OZ and begin a sequence of events which threatens every account in OZ, but later on even threaten the world.This part of the story actually worked quite well due to the recent major hacking of Sony's Playstation and Qriocity networks which gave hackers access to tens of millions of account users' info. It was hard not to think about this real-life event as something similar (albeit much more massive and danegrous in scope) occurred in Summer Wars. The fact that the film was completed in 2009 and the Sony hack happened just a month ago was real life copying fiction instead of the other way around. It's this part of the story's plot which added to the thrilling aspect of the film as Keiji and others (mostly the extended Jinnouichi Clan he meets) try to take on the cause of the OZ hack (which we quickly learn wasn't a person but an advanced A.I. program released by the U.S. Army into OZ to test it's capabilities not knowing it would become self-aware and hard to control).Weaving in and around this science-fiction are some of what makes some Japanese anime so easily accessible to those outside of Japan. We see a slice-of-life that, at first looks to be typical Japanese daily life, but as the story moves along becomes something that everyone would recognize and have some sort of kinship with no matter their race or culture. It's the theme of family togetherness even through adversity and the occassional disagreements between family members. It's here we see Natsuki's great grandmother Sakae show the need for the family to always find time to sit down and eat dinner together no matter what problems each and everyone may be having. It's these very serene, at times quite hilarious, scenes of family life with the Jinnouichi Clan that Summer Wars will tug at audiences' heartstrings and cause more than just a few to tear up. Some have said these scenes were too maudlin and corny, but I look at that complaint as people trying to project their own cynical nature on what was really an honest look at family life and how keeping a family together through adversity (both big and small) becomes a reward unto itself.The Japanese voice cast did quite a good job bringing their animated characters to life from the main leads in Keiji, Natsuki and Sakae right up to the little children who added some levity to the situation. While I try to always watch anime with the Japanese language on with English subtitles for Summer Wars I also watched it with the English-voice dubbing. I was surprised to hear that the English-dubbed version was not as bad as most anime dubs and was actually quite good. Summer Wars looks to boast a who's-who of English dub voice actors which probably lent itself to a quality dubbing in the end.Summer Wars was produced by one of Japan's major animation studios with Madhouse and the look of the film bears this out. The virtual world which made up OZ looked beautiful and made great use of CGI-animation. The avatars used by OZ account members were inventive and a menagerie of characters that all looked to be very distinct each and everytime a new one came on the screen. The animation for the real-world aspect of the film used traditional hand-drawn animation. While it didn't have the sheen and flash of most anime series the flat-look and natural color scheme used for scenes when outside OZ lent a sense of realism and the natural that made it easier to get into the film. These two contrasting animation styles really helped in pointing out just how different OZ was to everything else.Hosada Mamoru's direction keeps everything from becoming a jumbled mess as the film juggles not just two major plot threads concurrently but smaller subplots involving certain individual family members of the Jinnouichi Clan. It's a testament to his handling of the film that we're never lost as the film's story unfolds. Whether it's the fake relationship between Keiji and Natsuki becoming something more real to the prodigal son coming back to the family after a self-imposed exile of ten years right up to a high school baseball tournament involving one of the family's younger members who also happens to be a star pitcher.In the end, Summer Wars should be seen as a landmark film that officially heralds the arrival of one of anime's great filmmakers. With the untimely passing of Satoshi Kon there's been a scramble within the anime community to find his heir apparent. Hayao Miyazaki will continue to be one of anime's godfathers and pillar of quality work, but amongst the younger generation there was really no one stepping up the way Satoshi Kon did in so short a time. I think with Summer Wars it wouldn't be too farfetched to say that Hosada Mamoru has also stepped up to join Miyazaki as one of the creative geniuses in the anime world. It also shows younger anime filmmakers that there is success to be had doing anime outside the usual mecha, mahou shoujo and shonen series which remains the backbone and meal-ticket for animation studios in Japan.Summer Wars is an anime film that I'd highly recommend to all whether they're fans of anime or have no idea what an anime was. This anime is that good and one that deserves to be called just film without the anime tag. It will be interesting to see what Hosada Mamoru comes up with next. I, for one, can't wait to see what it is. Also, I recommend people watch this on Blu-Ray. The difference in how the animation comes across between Blu-Ray and DVD is leagues apart.",5,Summer Wars is an anime film that I'd highly recommend to all,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,8289,"['Anime',

This online world is populated by avatars of nearly every person on Earth with access to a computer and internet.  People, companies, governments, all are online in Oz.  Very similar to the internet we know today except that this online world is hosted in a virtual reality interface of sorts.So to the film:  Though this isn't quite as solid as their film ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", it is a stunning film nonetheless.  The animation is fantastic, especially the computer animation used to depict Oz.  The characters are all likable, and the Japanese voice acting solid.Essentially this is a story about friendship, family, and togetherness.  There are a few sad moments, some funny moments, but overall it is very touching and heart warming.  The computer program as a villain is nothing new, but it is given a new and sinister twist in this film.  It is enjoyable to watch the main character Kenji fumble around, lacking common sense and confidence in the beginning, 'man up' as the movie progresses.

Well, last year my grandmother died. After the memorial service I was sitting in my apartment looking for something to keep my mind off the obvious when I remembered this. So I put it in the player, wrapped up in the blanket that my granny had given me when I was five years old, and started watching. Then I started crying for pretty much the entire movie (those who know the plot know why).By the title and the front cover, I was expecting an action focused movie of some sort I could use to escape. It wasn't. This movie is very much character and dialogue driven. A major part of the ""Summer Wars"" story is a granny, who is very much like how my granny was (strong and independent, yet faithful and loving), and the effect her life has on those around her and on, by extension, a major international disaster. It is a story about the strength derived from family and love. I highly recommend it to anyone who had a granny that they loved very much.The movie itself is extremely well made. The quality of voice acting is excellent, including the dub (I know this is an ancient debate, but for me, dubs are still marginally inferior to subs, most of the time). I watched it once in English and once in Japanese (because I felt like crying more, apparently) and I think I actually preferred the English version.The animation is amazing, along with the music. This is a Studio Ghibli-class release.

This colorful little anime movie spends most of its run straddling the line between a family reunion comedy and a world war entirely on the web. And the results manage to stir your heart and make you laugh at the same time.Math nerd Kenji is shocked when popular upperclassman Natsuki asks him to come to her family's country house for the weekend. Unfortunately, he's there under false pretenses -- not only is Natsuki claiming that he's her boyfriend, but that he's a wealthy college student at Tokyo U. Yeah, that is inevitably going to backfire.But something far worse happens when OZ (a crazy hybrid of amazon.com, Facebook, fighting video games and... well, just about everything you can find on the WWW) is hacked -- and Kenji is the main suspect.The truth is actually much more sinister -- a horrendous program called Love Machine is devouring OZ user avatars, and is using the computer connections to cause chaos all across the world. When tragedy strikes the family, Kenji inspires them to fight back against Love Machine. But can the family's plan stop the program before it has a chance to take revenge on them?""Summer Wars"" isn't really like any other movie I've ever seen -- it's part cyberthriller, part bittersweet family story, part crazy comedy, and part colorful anime. It starts off as a simple family dramedy, with Kenji getting thrown into Natsuki's eccentric family and dealing with all the baggage they bring with them. Plus, you know he's going to get busted.But when Love Machine appears, the stakes are suddenly the technological safety of the ENTIRE WORLD. So we get a wild, crazy guerilla cyberwarefare (involving a boat, a giant computer, an army truck and lots of ice!) as the family (plus Kenji) unites to battle Love Machine. At the same time, the writer maintains the focus on the eccentric family, their grudges, and their unique personalities.Plus, the animation for this movie is SPELLBINDING. The ""real world"" stuff is rendered in traditional hand-drawn anime, but the scenes set in OZ are brilliant, surreal, colorful and dreamlike. Whole civilizations on shelves, crowned whales, floating islands, stacked sports stadia, and endless chambers filled with strange little creatures.And all the characters are very well-fleshed-out.

Somehow, these two events are inextricably linked.  Naturally, the villains of this scenario are the US army, having bought the Love Machine for its military application (the Love Machine is an AI creation of one of the disgruntled members of the aforementioned large family).  The intent of this creation has to do with identity theft, Internet accounts being hijacked, any and all systems that rely on Internet applications being put in jeopardy (the fire department, traffic control, medical, et cetera).  Then the Love Machine hijacks a space probe and sends it hurtling towards the earth and any number of nuclear facilities.  It's up to this boisterous family to save the world and themselves.The plot is at times frustrating and fun, if not jarring, as it fluctuates wildly between slapstick and peril.

I was in the biz when they started to break and, as exciting and eye-popping as they were at the time, they wore thin pretty quickly. There were always the exceptions such as 'Ghost in the Shell' et al but I just grew tired. 'Summer Wars' received really good user reviews and the story outline seemed interesting so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm way glad I did.Here's the scoop. OZ is the new, ultimate web-site where anyone can do almost anything. It's used by individuals and governments alike. It's been inadvertently hacked into, and compromised by, a math geek who has unwittingly unleashed an AI construct that is fouling up the the whole thing.  To boot, while all this is going on, said math geek has been tricked into playing his female acquaintance's fiance at granny's 90th birthday at a huge family mansion out in the country. The party is populated by the entire clan and they're a diverse, wild bunch. Can the math geek save the world and find true love?There are a couple of other sub-plots involving a high school baseball championship, a particular card game and a black sheep cousin. It's the way the movie juggles both the main and sub-plots that puts it high on the quality scale. The animation is OK. The production design is a bit uneven. OZ is pretty cool with a great design and color palette. Some of the real life sets a very good, others are pedestrian. The character designs are OK but don't reach a level that you haven't already seen elsewhere, and some of the facial expressions don't reach beyond TV grade Anime. That being said though, overall, this is still one of the better looking pieces you'll find out there.I had a great time watching this. I liked the story, the characters and the pace. At 2 hours I was not at all in a hurry to get things over with. The final scene is more than a bit too cute but by then, the movie was over so what the heck. I can't put this up with any of the Miyazaki films but it's still really good. If you like this sort of thing at all you probably won't be disappointed in watching this.",4,Great Idea.

Summer Wars, like all great animation, succeeds on many levels. It has stunning visuals, an excellent and intriguing story, (that's not hard to follow despite it being largely set in cyberspace) and excellent characters. The story is about a family, but, unlike so many animated films, the family doesn't take a backseat to the story--it IS the story. It's amazing to watch a realistically depicted (although delightfully quirky) family reunion transform into a show of touching family resolve that will ultimately inspire viewers both young and old. I highly recommend Summer Wars to be viewed as a family or, of course, by any lovers of animation.One last thing I have to add. The Jinnouchi family's matriarch, Sakae, is the true star of this film.

1277875,A3LRVGJ73EMPQV,B002M3UEP4,"Issac K. Ohnheiser ""Ohnine""","[1, 1]","I ordered this movie while serving a tour in Afghanistan.  I remember watching the trailer for this movie time and time again, anxious for its release in the U.S.  I had such an interest in this movie my friends quickly became convinced that the movie would be worth their time to watch.  Now I admit that Anime isn't for everyone.  There are several Japanese culture and subculture fillers in all of Anime that for the casual movie or TV show watcher it might be a bit over-whelming.  Summer Wars is filled to the brim with said culture and it is exactly that which makes this movie both unique and extraordinary for all.  This movie fully assumes the audience is Japanese and as such is a wonderful and colorful experience for everyone.  This may seem contradictory to the previous fact but what a great way to see the culture in its purest form.  This isn't some action film that is full of unreal scenarios or Please Teacher setting where the women are objectified, but rather this movie is a full fledged family movie both funny and exciting.The film takes place in a modern day time setting where an MMO (massive multi-player online) system controls everything.  Everyone uses this system and even more so they depend on it.  This seems plausible considering how much we depend on technology today.  Well what would happen if something in that system went wrong?  This movie answers that question with an interesting and entertaining plot.So if an interesting crisis plot, a love story, family oriented, and Japanese Cultured movie sounds like something you might be interest in try this movie on for size.  Forget that it is animated and try to keep an open mind.  You might be surprised how much you like it.  The people I was deployed with loved it.

Alford,"[0, 0]","Mamoru Hosoda followed up his Academy Award-winning sci-fi shojo movie of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time with an extended remake of his original Digimon short movie(which was the second chapter in the American release of Digimon: The Movie). Summer Wars is a full-length feature blending in high school romance with digital armageddon.At the beginning of summer vacation in Japan, math whiz Kenji is working with his buddy Takashi as a moderator for the massive online network called OZ(no Wizard Of Oz puns present)which is a virtual world similar to WOW, but with less of a midevil setting and more like playful icons involved in fighter tournaments. Kenji's cute energetic classmate Natsuki offers him another quick job to help her prepare for her great-gramma's 90th birthday. He accepts, and the two of them go off to Natsuki's family estate in the country. They are a large and diverse family descended from a samurai clan, and the great-grandmother Sakae is about everything you'd be looking for in granny. Kenji is shocked though when Natsuki claims to her family that he is her boyfriend, but she says that in order to make her grandma feel safe about her. Confused during the night, he gets a strange text message send in code, which he uses his math skills to crack, and sends it back. He awakes the next morning to see on the news that OZ has been been hacked into and that he is being blamed for it. It turns out that an A.I. program masquerading as Kenji's avatar, calling itself Love Machine. It proceeds to take over OZ, which Kenji tries to stop with a new avatar Takashi made for him, along with Natsuki's cousin who is really the brilliant game fighter, King Kazma. They tangle with Love Machine, but after absorbing a few other avatars, it goes all Super-Saiyan and kicks them out of the system. It then proceeds to infect computer systems all over the world, causing mass confusion and hysteria. Its later revealed that Natsuki's estranged uncle is the one who actually created the A.I. that the American military try to use, but it escaped into OZ. This news infuriates Sakae as she banishes him from her home. The ensuing action causes Sakae to pass away in her sleep. The family believes that Love Machine is responsible, so they pull all the stops to try and pull the plug on it. They call in resouces from all over the country, even by bringing in a huge supercomputer to back them up. Natsuki uses her superior skills at tea ceremony card playing to challenge Love Machine to a final card game. She gets help from players all over the world to shut him down. However, it causes a satellite to begin falling towards their location. Kenji hacks into the satellite's system, and has it crash near the estate.Summer Wars features some impressive digital effects, specifically in the online world, although you sorta wish there was more added to it than the cartoonish avatars. The style used for the offline parts are a little more standard, at least for a generic non-Ghibli anime movie. The main appeal for this movie though is the compelling story, and the tightnit seperate world the family of characters exist in. They're very believable, despite some of the standard anime tropes that are present, and you can recognize at least one member of your own family in Natsuki's. This film makes for a great watch, at least as a gateway anime since it takes alot of what makes for a great story and an engaging syle.",5,Digimon: The Movie of The Movie,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,3439,"['Mamoru', 'Hosoda', 'followed', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'sci-fi', 'shojo', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'extended', 'remake', 'original', 'Digimon', 'short', 'movie', 'was', 'second', 'chapter', 'American', 'release', 'Digimon', 'Movie', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'full-length', 'feature', 'blending', 'high', 'school', 'romance', 'digital', 'armageddon.At', 'beginning', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Japan', 'math', 'whiz', 'Kenji', 'working', 'buddy', 'Takashi', 'moderator', 'massive', 'online', 'network', 'called', 'OZ', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'puns', 'present', 'virtual', 'world', 'similar', 'WOW', 'less', 'midevil', 'setting', 'more', 'playful', 'icons', 'involved', 'fighter', 'tournaments', 'Kenji', 'cute', 'energetic', 'classmate', 'Natsuki', 'quick', 'job', 'help', 'prepare', 'great-gramma', '90th', 'birthday', 'two', 'go', 'off', 'Natsuki', 'family', 'estate', 'country', 'are', 'large', 'diverse', 'family', 'descended', 'samurai', 'clan', 'great-grandmother', 'Sakae', 'everything', ""'d"", 'be', 'looking', 'granny', 'Kenji', 'shocked', 'when', 'Natsuki', 'family', 'boyfriend', 'order', 'make', 'grandma', 'feel', 'safe', 'Confused', 'night', 'strange', 'text', 'message', 'send', 'code', 'math', 'skills', 'crack', 'back', 'next', 'morning', 'see', 'news', 'OZ', 'been', 'been', 'hacked', 'being', 'blamed', 'out', 'A.I', 'program', 'masquerading', 'Kenji', 'avatar', 'calling', 'Love', 'Machine', 'take', 'over', 'OZ', 'Kenji', 'stop', 'new', 'avatar', 'Takashi', 'made', 'Natsuki', 'cousin', 'who', 'really', 'brilliant', 'game', 'fighter', 'King', 'Kazma', 'tangle', 'Love', 'Machine', 'absorbing', 'few', 'other', 'avatars', 'Super-Saiyan', 'kicks', 'system', 'then', 'infect', 'computer', 'systems', 'world', 'causing', 'mass', 'confusion', 'hysteria', 'later', 'revealed', 'Natsuki', 'estranged', 'uncle', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'created', 'A.I', 'American', 'military', 'try', 'use', 'escaped', 'OZ', 'news', 'Sakae', 'home', 'ensuing', 'action', 'Sakae', 'pass', 'away', 'sleep', 'family', 'Love', 'Machine', 'responsible', 'pull', 'stops', 'try', 'pull', 'plug', 'call', 'resouces', 'country', 'even', 'bringing', 'huge', 'supercomputer', 'back', 'up', 'Natsuki', 'superior', 'skills', 'tea', 'ceremony', 'card', 'playing', 'challenge', 'Love', 'Machine', 'final', 'card', 'game', 'help', 'players', 'world', 'shut', 'down', 'However', 'satellite', 'begin', 'falling', 'location', 'Kenji', 'satellite', 'system', 'crash', 'estate.Summer', 'Wars', 'impressive', 'digital', 'effects', 'specifically', 'online', 'world', 'sorta', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'added', 'cartoonish', 'avatars', 'style', 'used', 'offline', 'parts', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'standard', 'least', 'generic', 'non-Ghibli', 'anime', 'movie', 'main', 'appeal', 'movie', 'though', 'compelling', 'story', 'tightnit', 'seperate', 'world', 'family', 'characters', 'exist', ""'re"", 'very', 'believable', 'standard', 'anime', 'tropes', 'are', 'present', 'can', 'recognize', 'least', 'one', 'member', 'own', 'family', 'Natsuki', 'film', 'great', 'watch', 'least', 'gateway', 'anime', 'alot', 'what', 'great', 'story', 'engaging', 'syle']",N/A

When the other film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, went out of print, I decided to purchase this one just in case it also went out of print.  I ended up snatching it up for $12.50 on black Friday 2012 without really knowing anything about the movie, and wow, am I glad that I did.I watched the movie last night with my wife, and was totally shocked at what a great movie this is.  I skimmed the description and some of the other reviews, and I was under the impression that this was a movie about people using magical animals to do battle.  I was completely wrong, and to my surprise, it was a zany story about two kids who are thrown in to a situation where they need to save the world from a malicious AI that takes over the Internet.The story starts out so completely normal, similar to Miyazaki's films, then the protagonists are thrown into a completely surreal adventure.AudioThe audio is excellent.  It really makes good use of the 5.1 surround sound, I really enjoyed the entire experience.Video qualityThe video quality is very good.  Definitely on-par for an HD animation.ArtThe art in this film is just fantastic.

It's a computer hacking adventure story mixed together with a touching family reunion story. It almost seems to work, but not as well as one might like. In some ways, it might have been better to have just made two movies. To be honest, the computer hacking adventure was the weaker part for me, possibly because I had my own computer hacking adventures well before the age of avatars and virtual reality, so that stuff tends to feel added on. It might work for a more general audience, but when you've watched the Forbin Project with the whole Artificial Intelligence lab shouting control-S, flush that stuff, beside one, it's hard to take CGI world spaces seriously.I did like the family story which touched all of the bases having its outsider, matriarch, and black sheep, along with all the family stories and dynamics. That the family was an old samurai family still living in its old fortress and reliving old battles with the Tokugawa clan made it even more fun. Still, I've been trained to expect more emotional growth to be revealed in  such stories. There is some, but it feels a bit pasted on.

I went to see the movie Summer Wars in San Francisco on that rainy Christmas day and it was well worth the 100 mile drive.In my humble opinion Summer Wars directed by Hosoda Mamoru is the best animation I've seen in a long time and I just per-ordered this dvd on Amozon.The heroes of this exciting, hilarious and heartwarming movie are Kenji and the Jinnouchi family.The best animations have authentic believable characters and here we find several of them most notably Sakae, the family's charismatic matriarch. If there was an Academy award for best supporting actress in an animation it should go to her.  In what could have easily stayed a simple scifi adventure alone, Hosoda has seamlessly weaved in an extensive cast of charming heart and togetherness.The male lead Kenji is a shy math geek who has never even dated a girl before. He agrees to a summer job escorting Natsuki, the most popular girl in school, to her family's gathering. A sprawling earthy ancient rural family estate where the Jinnouchi clan has gathered to celebrate the family matriarch's 90th birthday. This is the real world setting where the enemy strikes however the movie doesn't just take place in this world. It starts introducing you to the white sterile appealing online universe called OZ that has all but completely taken over all the worlds workings.

1277887,A34PP1LDB9GNV5,B002M3UEP4,L. Roth,"[1, 1]","I'm not going to go into a long descriptive paean to the film here; the visual side of the film is more than acceptable, as are the characters and the story. What I particularly enjoyed about the film is the way the individual characters interacted within the bounds of their extended family. Like most families, there are inherent tensions and conflicts - but there are also shared pasts, common interests, and a recognition of the ties that transcend the petty. It's knowing that there are people who will always have your back.When Kenji, the introverted college student and math prodigy is inveigled into posing as the fiance of his classmate Natsuki so that she can cope with the expectations of  her extended family, he has no idea what he is getting into. A classic nerd type with a part time job doing systems upkeep on the vast virtual reality of Oz and no experience with girls (let alone one as attractive as Natsuki), he is way over his head. When he meets her vast family at the palatial estate in the country, presided over by her clan's matriarch on the occasion of her upcoming 90th birthday, much comedy and many awkward moments ensue.While attempting to sleep the first night, a mysterious math puzzle arriving via his phone turns into an obsessive all-night effort to solve it. When he does,  his reward is not what he expects. He goes back to sleep, only to find on awakening that he's now wanted as a cyber criminal who appears to have hacked into Oz. In the ensuing confusion, Natsuki's ruse about his real identity is unmasked as well; a family member who is also a policeman hauls him off under arrest.But the havoc now being unleashed within Oz is manifesting in the real world, which has become dependent on the cyber world as a place to meet, shop and carry on much of its business. Disorder spreads, and Kenji is brought back to the estate because massive traffic jams have made travel impossible. Now as there as himself, he begins to start finding out what is happening - and begins to really interact with Natsuki's family, which is where the story begins to take off with a number of twists and surprises.Watching Kenji discover what he has been missing from his own life, watching him unfold and blossom as he begins to become involved with Natsuki's family is a joy, as is watching how he the outsider begins to remind the group of its own strengths and values, something that familiarity  can obscure. His interactions with the matriarch of the clan are especially pleasurable. She is one formidable old lady, and she sees more in him than he knows about himself.The battles within the virtual world of Oz, the conflicts outside - ultimately the story is about how functioning families are made up of people who see each other for who they really are, care for each other despite the pain that sometimes results, and come together to face their challenges as a family. (Even if they are not related by blood.)  One of the turning points in the movie is seeing the ""On-line community"" in Oz suddenly become a cyber-extended family.  In a virtual world it's still possible for all the things that make us human to manifest when needed.While there's plenty of action and suspense in the story, there's also a wealth of great character interaction on a very human level.  That's what makes this much more than just another anime film with some flashy visuals and some violent action. All in all, it's a wonderful story.There's some extras in the DVD package I haven't had a chance to get to yet - some trading cards, and another disk full of extras.

1277894,A1CKY01WDLN1DK,B002M3UEP4,M. Zveris,"[2, 2]","Summer Wars isn't exactly a new theme for anime, or movies in general.  It's the sometimes trite and mostly overused boy meets girl meets problem = awww &lt;3.  That out of the way it is an original it is beautiful and it is a fantastically well done take on a tired theme.  I'm not going to delve into the actual plot, as there are plenty of other reviews that do so...as such please consider this a spoiler free review.The DVD comes with some small cards of characters you will meet in the anime, a beautiful box, and a second disk of extras, previews, and other bits of information on Summer Wars.  It's a nice way to handle the issue of adding extra content, a separate disc is far preferable to wading through the menus.  The subtitling is done very well and is never obtrusive nor does it move so quickly that you're distracted from actually watching the anime.  That in and of itself is often a difficult task to achieve with subtitles and they should be lauded just for that fact.The graphics are beautiful and the color palette is massive.  The change between the real world and OZ is a phenomenal example of this as things become brighter, the colors less natural and more deeply hued, and yet it all seems natural as if you could login to OZ today and create your own avatar.  In the real world the saturation and blending is most apparent with the backgrounds, sunsets, sunrises, fields, and cities are richly animated and nothing feels like an afterthought.  It is no wonder that this series won so many awards, just based on the art alone it is an epic achievement.The story of Summer Wars has more to do with family, cooperation, and faith in your fellow human being than the actual goings on of OZ.  Each character is well developed, though some are more distinct than others.  You can tell that the creators took each individual character very seriously and tackled subjects that may otherwise be difficult to handle.Your main characters are a painfully shy high school student who has never kissed a girl and is focused on math, a young lady unsure of where she is in the world and desperate to please her grandmother, uncle, and other relatives even if that means lying.  The grandmother is a proud matriarch of a respected but now (comparatively) penniless family who has lived a life of conviction, clearly holding her clan together.  Others include bombastic uncles, snotty aunts, overly inquisitive young children, a quiet loner of a child with a secret revealed halfway through the anime, and an uncle who fills the role of being the titular black sheep.It's a big cast that would be easy to lose track of if you weren't introduced to them so thoroughly and if they weren't all distinct.  It's a feat that Summer Wars manages to keep everything together so well throughout the entire show.Summer Wars is a very family oriented anime in that it is based around a family, and the ""family"" of a world connected all the time through OZ (a much evolved Internet).  It reflects that while we may want to solve our problems alone, hide our pain and worries from the world, and share only what makes us seem the best - we can't solve anything that way and we must learn to communicate.  This is a timeless message that still comes across fresh in Summer Wars and is endearing if just for the way it is presented to us.",5,A Timless Story in a New Light,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,3334,"['Summer', 'Wars', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'new', 'theme', 'anime', 'movies', 'general', 'sometimes', 'trite', 'mostly', 'overused', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'meets', 'problem', '=', 'awww', 'lt', '3', 'way', 'original', 'beautiful', 'fantastically', 'well', 'done', 'take', 'tired', 'theme', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'delve', 'actual', 'plot', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'so', 'such', 'please', 'consider', 'spoiler', 'free', 'review.The', 'DVD', 'small', 'cards', 'characters', 'will', 'meet', 'anime', 'beautiful', 'box', 'second', 'disk', 'extras', 'previews', 'other', 'bits', 'information', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'nice', 'way', 'handle', 'issue', 'adding', 'extra', 'content', 'separate', 'disc', 'far', 'preferable', 'wading', 'menus', 'subtitling', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'obtrusive', 'move', 'so', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'distracted', 'actually', 'watching', 'anime', 'often', 'difficult', 'task', 'achieve', 'subtitles', 'should', 'be', 'lauded', 'just', 'fact.The', 'graphics', 'are', 'beautiful', 'color', 'palette', 'massive', 'change', 'real', 'world', 'OZ', 'phenomenal', 'example', 'things', 'become', 'brighter', 'colors', 'natural', 'more', 'deeply', 'hued', 'yet', 'natural', 'could', 'login', 'OZ', 'today', 'create', 'own', 'avatar', 'real', 'world', 'saturation', 'blending', 'most', 'apparent', 'backgrounds', 'sunsets', 'sunrises', 'fields', 'cities', 'are', 'richly', 'animated', 'nothing', 'feels', 'afterthought', 'wonder', 'series', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'just', 'based', 'art', 'epic', 'achievement.The', 'story', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'more', 'do', 'family', 'cooperation', 'faith', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'actual', 'goings', 'OZ', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'more', 'distinct', 'others', 'can', 'tell', 'creators', 'took', 'individual', 'character', 'very', 'seriously', 'tackled', 'subjects', 'may', 'otherwise', 'be', 'difficult', 'handle.Your', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'painfully', 'shy', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'never', 'kissed', 'girl', 'focused', 'math', 'young', 'lady', 'unsure', 'where', 'world', 'desperate', 'please', 'grandmother', 'uncle', 'other', 'relatives', 'even', 'lying', 'grandmother', 'proud', 'matriarch', 'respected', 'now', 'comparatively', 'penniless', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'conviction', 'clearly', 'holding', 'clan', 'together', 'Others', 'include', 'bombastic', 'uncles', 'snotty', 'aunts', 'overly', 'inquisitive', 'young', 'children', 'quiet', 'loner', 'child', 'secret', 'revealed', 'halfway', 'anime', 'uncle', 'who', 'role', 'being', 'titular', 'black', 'sheep.It', 'big', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'lose', 'track', 'were', ""n't"", 'introduced', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'were', ""n't"", 'distinct', 'feat', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'keep', 'everything', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'entire', 'show.Summer', 'Wars', 'very', 'family', 'oriented', 'anime', 'based', 'family', 'family', 'world', 'connected', 'time', 'OZ', 'much', 'evolved', 'Internet', 'may', 'want', 'solve', 'problems', 'alone', 'hide', 'pain', 'worries', 'world', 'share', 'only', 'what', 'seem', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'solve', 'anything', 'way', 'must', 'learn', 'communicate', 'timeless', 'message', 'still', 'fresh', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'endearing', 'just', 'way', 'presented']",N/A

The Studio has produced some of the best anime to come out of Japan in the last decade, including the recent ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"".  Much of that team re-assembled to put together the ambitious ""Summer Wars"".  The result?I was entertained and disappointed.  I felt moments of ""wow, that's storytelling"" and stretches of ""that doesn't make sense"".  I was impressed by creative plot twists and turns that ultimately wound up in all-too-familiar territory.One thing I found was that two dozen one-dimensional characters didn't engage me in the least, but I would have sat and listened to the wisdom and life stories of the family matriarch for hours on end.  Unfortunately, even the main players -- whom I found really interesting, or bold, or mysterious at first -- evolved into stick figure shadows of themselves by the end of the film.Hosoda's attempt to create a sort of anime version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is daring, and I admire the effort.  I couldn't escape the film without wanting to ""tweak"" it here and there, to temper its extremes and make its deus-ex-machina moments a little more plausible.  It was as if the writers wanted it to be a slice-of-life fantasy with romantic elements and martial arts combat mixed in with deep historical roots set in a William Gibson-esque landscape -- and the whole thing collapsed under its own weight.So, I was less impressed by this than other Madhouse productions.

During holidays, his dream girl Netsuki - with whom he has only a casual acquantaince - convinces him to do a small favor for her - return home with her during the holidays and pose as her boyfriend.  (Why she's so frantic to find someone to fulfill this unusual task is part of a wonderful little subplot that unfolds as the movie goes along)  This favor is not exactly a hard sell for Kenji, it's more like winning a precious fantasy come to life.  Shortly before departing, in an unconnected event that will later have deep reprecussions during the vacation at Netsuki's family country home, Kenji is one of numerous people around the world who receives a mysterious email challenging the recipient to solve a numbers/logic puzzle.  Turns out, Kenji is the only one on the planet who manages to complete the task.Meanwhile, as all this is going on in the real world, you see a lot taking place within the Oz network, where users enter a virtual reality type domain using imaginative avatars for everything from socialization to communication to banking to virtual gaming and beyond.  The visuals and imagination and use of color inside the Oz-world are just amazing.As events unfold at Netsuki's family home (a really cool, unusual tale full of memorable characters, effective drama and the kind of genuine comedy that so many movies in the comedy genre fail to attain) the seemingly impossible happens: the Oz network is hacked, putting everything from personal information to traffic control to the electricity grid and even the codes for nuclear weapons in unknown, ominous hands.I'm not going to reveal any more of what happens here, I may have said too much already (even though you kind of get most of this from the back of the DVD box); the surprises are better left experienced rather than given away in spoilers.  I'll just make a few random observations: Kenji and Netsuki are one of the best couples to appear in a romantic movie, with a rare chemistry that really makes you root for them to get together.  The entire cast is quirky and excellently done - one thing I noticed is how the children of the family, often seen doing their own thing in the background, seem so lifelike in their little ways and mannerisms.  The visuals are great throughout, and inside Oz they just get progressively more awesome as the movie unfolds.  The climaxes to the movie's various plots are tremendous.Summer Wars is up there with anything Studio Ghibli has done (I consider that the utmost praise) and is one of those movies that makes you wonder why on Earth anime has, outside of Asia and a couple other countries, yet to break out beyond its dedicated cult following (of which I consider myself part) and start being embraced by legions more fans.",5,Highly Original Anime On Par With The Studio Ghiblis,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3403,"['Asia', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'particular', 'prolific', 'creating', 'hybrids', 'unlikely', 'genres', 'themes', 'excellent', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'yet', 'crossing', 'highly', 'quirky', 'touchingWhisper', 'Heart-type', 'tale', 'visually', 'mindblowing', 'technothriller', 'apocalyptic', 'touches.Math', 'genius', 'Kenji', 'student', 'who', 'part-time', 'one', 'thousands', 'freelance', 'programmers', ""'Oz"", 'near-future', 'unbiquitous', 'cyber-entity', 'basically', 'connected', 'everything', 'imagine', 'YouTube', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Tweet', 'Google', 'world', 'banks', 'governments', 'computer', 'data', 'networks', 'merged', 'single', 'huge', 'conglomerate', 'holidays', 'dream', 'girl', 'Netsuki', 'whom', 'only', 'casual', 'acquantaince', 'convinces', 'do', 'small', 'favor', 'return', 'home', 'holidays', 'pose', 'boyfriend', 'Why', 'so', 'frantic', 'find', 'someone', 'fulfill', 'unusual', 'task', 'part', 'wonderful', 'little', 'subplot', 'movie', 'along', 'favor', 'not', 'exactly', 'hard', 'sell', 'Kenji', 'more', 'winning', 'precious', 'fantasy', 'come', 'life', 'Shortly', 'departing', 'unconnected', 'event', 'will', 'later', 'have', 'deep', 'reprecussions', 'vacation', 'Netsuki', 'family', 'country', 'home', 'Kenji', 'one', 'numerous', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'mysterious', 'email', 'challenging', 'recipient', 'solve', 'numbers/logic', 'puzzle', 'out', 'Kenji', 'only', 'one', 'planet', 'who', 'complete', 'task.Meanwhile', 'going', 'real', 'world', 'see', 'lot', 'taking', 'place', 'Oz', 'network', 'where', 'users', 'enter', 'virtual', 'reality', 'type', 'domain', 'using', 'imaginative', 'avatars', 'everything', 'socialization', 'communication', 'banking', 'virtual', 'gaming', 'visuals', 'imagination', 'use', 'color', 'Oz-world', 'are', 'just', 'amazing.As', 'events', 'unfold', 'Netsuki', 'family', 'home', 'really', 'cool', 'unusual', 'tale', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'effective', 'drama', 'kind', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'comedy', 'genre', 'fail', 'attain', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'happens', 'Oz', 'network', 'hacked', 'putting', 'everything', 'personal', 'information', 'traffic', 'control', 'electricity', 'grid', 'even', 'codes', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'unknown', 'ominous', 'hands.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'more', 'what', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'even', 'kind', 'get', 'most', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', 'surprises', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'experienced', 'rather', 'given', 'away', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'few', 'random', 'observations', 'Kenji', 'Netsuki', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'couples', 'appear', 'romantic', 'movie', 'rare', 'chemistry', 'really', 'root', 'get', 'together', 'entire', 'cast', 'quirky', 'excellently', 'done', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'how', 'children', 'family', 'often', 'seen', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'background', 'seem', 'so', 'lifelike', 'little', 'ways', 'mannerisms', 'visuals', 'are', 'great', 'inside', 'Oz', 'just', 'get', 'progressively', 'more', 'awesome', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'climaxes', 'movie', 'various', 'plots', 'are', 'tremendous.Summer', 'Wars', 'there', 'anything', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'done', 'consider', 'utmost', 'praise', 'one', 'movies', 'wonder', 'why', 'Earth', 'anime', 'Asia', 'couple', 'other', 'countries', 'yet', 'break', 'out', 'dedicated', 'cult', 'following', 'consider', 'part', 'start', 'being', 'embraced', 'legions', 'more', 'fans']",N/A

The movie tells a story of High school teenagers who through angst, family commitment, and power overcome obstacles together through shared experiences and of course social networking. Think of FaceBook taking over the world in an official sense, but a hack breaks it, causing the world to collapse. The only downside to this well delivered drama is that at times it's marred with Hollywood and anime clich&eacute;s; these distractions remove the viewer from focusing on the plot at hand, and at certain moments the character development.

The blu-ray transfer is vivid and the animation is very detailed and beautiful. Overall it is a very high quality product.For those who saw and enjoyed ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", this is Hosoda's next masterpiece. For those who are not big anim&eacute; fans, but enjoy the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, this movie will more than satisfy them and, no doubt, they will probably want to check out ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", if they haven't already.The story of ""Summer Wars"" is rich and rewarding. We meet a nerdy young man who is tricked into being her pretend fianc&eacute; by his high school's resident ""queen bee"" (most attractive and popular girl). They go to the 90th birthday of the girl's grandmother in Ueda, along with the rest of the Jinouchi family. In the middle of the first night, the boy gets a text message on his mobile phone with a code and a message ""Solve me""....This is where things start getting interesting.I found the film to be a very strong emotional experience. It reminded me of some times in my life with my own family. If there is any message in this film it is this: ""Never give up on family, even when the going gets rough, especially when the going gets rough.""The film may be watched with or without subtitles in the original Japanese language. I am happy with that and it is good to hear the original voices, but I am not an original language chauvinist and the English dub is excellent. Brina Palencia (Natsuki) and J. Michael Tatum (wayward Uncle Wabisuke) are here, as they seem to be everywhere at the moment, (see ""Spice And Wolf"" and many other recent anim&eacute; movies and series) and both bring much to their characters, as they always do. Both Japanese and English language versions are fabulous.I will watch this movie again and I will enjoy it again and I think you will too.I eagerly await Mr Hosoda's next movie.

I happen to like them after reading more about them --they won't license an English release of their product.Taken from Wikipedia:""The company is well-known for its strict ""no-edits"" policy in licensing their films abroad. This was a result of the dubbing of Miyazaki's Nausica&auml; of the Valley of Wind when the film was released in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The film was heavily edited and Americanized, with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The ""no cuts"" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. In response, a Studio Ghibli producer sent an authentic katana with a simple message: ""No cuts"".[4]""I mentioned it because you can rest assured when watching this one, that you are getting the original dialog and plot without any Americanizing. This is important to me because I respect the difference in culture and want a dub to stay as true as possible to the original.I didn't watch this and come away thinking ""Hunh?"" because the edits didn't make sense.What I will say is this. I loved this film. More than enough of these reviews will rehash the plot, so I won't do that. The setting in Oz really isn't the centerpiece of the story. It's important, but you get the feeling that you could take these characters and put them in any sort of crisis and it wouldn't matter. This film is more about the strength of family and love. I felt like the writers took a Kenji and put him into their lives to allow us to see just a small part of what can make family so great. Here you're watching from Kenji's point of view, and watching him come into his own. By just being around a family he grows out of his shyness somewhat, develops confidence in himself and learns the importance of love and how it can literally move mountains. All of this because he found a place in a family who accepted him with open arms.This film has some genuine heart and by the end of it, my palms were sweaty and I was grinning ear to ear. I won't lie --I teared up at a few parts because it did a good job of reminding me what it can be like to lose someone important to your family, and how in times like those, we are the angels of each other's lives. Family can save you, and it also can tear you apart if you let it, and that almost happened. The characters were all wonderful and funny and quirky in the ways that make me think of my own family and I wouldn't hesitate to show this film to anyone else. There's no fan service in this film but there are a few jibes about sex --but nothing you wouldn't hear in your own home unless you're some kind of UBER prude or something.My daughter and I really enjoyed this together and I hope we can see other films as good as this one.",5,I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of the great ones.,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2905,"['can', 'pretty', 'much', 'recognize', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'production', 'when', 'see', 'Kind', 'think', 'Anime', 'version', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'happen', 'like', 'reading', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'license', 'English', 'release', 'product.Taken', 'Wikipedia', 'company', 'well-known', 'strict', 'no-edits', 'policy', 'licensing', 'films', 'abroad', 'was', 'result', 'dubbing', 'Miyazaki', 'Nausica', 'auml', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'Warriors', 'Wind', 'film', 'was', 'heavily', 'edited', 'Americanized', 'significant', 'portions', 'cut', 'plot', 'rewritten', 'cuts', 'policy', 'was', 'highlighted', 'when', 'Miramax', 'co-chairman', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'suggested', 'editing', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'make', 'more', 'marketable', 'response', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'producer', 'sent', 'authentic', 'katana', 'simple', 'message', 'cuts', '[', '4', ']', 'mentioned', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'when', 'watching', 'one', 'are', 'getting', 'original', 'dialog', 'plot', 'Americanizing', 'important', 'respect', 'difference', 'culture', 'want', 'dub', 'stay', 'as', 'true', 'possible', 'original.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'Hunh', 'edits', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.What', 'will', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'More', 'enough', 'reviews', 'will', 'rehash', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'setting', 'Oz', 'really', ""n't"", 'centerpiece', 'story', 'important', 'get', 'feeling', 'could', 'take', 'characters', 'put', 'sort', 'crisis', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'more', 'strength', 'family', 'love', 'felt', 'writers', 'took', 'Kenji', 'put', 'lives', 'allow', 'see', 'just', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'family', 'so', 'great', 'Here', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Kenji', 'point', 'view', 'watching', 'come', 'own', 'just', 'being', 'around', 'family', 'shyness', 'somewhat', 'confidence', 'importance', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'literally', 'move', 'mountains', 'found', 'place', 'family', 'who', 'accepted', 'open', 'arms.This', 'film', 'genuine', 'heart', 'end', 'palms', 'were', 'sweaty', 'was', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'teared', 'up', 'few', 'parts', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'reminding', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'lose', 'someone', 'important', 'family', 'how', 'times', 'are', 'angels', 'other', 'lives', 'Family', 'can', 'save', 'also', 'can', 'tear', 'apart', 'let', 'almost', 'happened', 'characters', 'were', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'quirky', 'ways', 'make', 'think', 'own', 'family', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'show', 'film', 'anyone', 'else', 'fan', 'service', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'jibes', 'sex', 'nothing', 'would', ""n't"", 'hear', 'own', 'home', ""'re"", 'kind', 'UBER', 'prude', 'something.My', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'together', 'hope', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'as', 'good', 'one']",N/A
