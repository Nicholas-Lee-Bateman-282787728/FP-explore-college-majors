289722,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630199616X,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Jayhawkers!, 1959 filmThis takes place in the Territory of Kansas just before the Civil War. A wounded man falls off his horse, his left arm is wounded. Then he goes to a house for shelter. Later two lawmen come by to look for an escaped prisoner. He is very dangerous, the reward for him is ""dead or alive"". Mrs. DuBois says he isn't there. The lawmen aren't fooled. Her husband was killed by Redlegs (the pro-slavery forces). She has two young children. Can Bleeker learn them good American? At night a gang of men arrive for him! The Army officer offers Bleeker a deal: he will escape hanging if he can deliver Luke Darcy to them. Darcy is the leader of the Redlegs who have taken over a town. Darcy offers peace and protection to the townspeople (at a price).Those who break his law suffer a harsh penalty. Darcy talks with Bleeker, who broke out of jail to find out why his wife stopped writing (she died of pneumonia). Darcy accepts him as a member (but investigates his background). Darcy's gang returns to their secret hideout. Darcy explains his plans to take over small towns then the whole territory of Kansas. Darcy's man checks out the place where Bleeker came from to ask questions. That woman talks too much under duress! Elsewhere Darcy sends for Bleeker and offers him a treat. Darcy explains his philosophy about women. He is remorseless! [A psychopath?] ""Did she ever say she loved you?"" Towns are raided and burnedd. Will they accept rule by Darcy? Yes, it's a protection racket. [But don't all governments offer protection in return for taxes?] Bleeker leaves on a trip for personal business. He is followed on Darcy's orders. Bleeker tells Mrs. DuBois to take a vacation.Should people give up their freedom for a promise of security? Not according to Mrs. DuBois. Bleeker catches a man in a lie. Norton draws and fires first, then escapes. Darcy is angered but accepts this. Darcy's gang rides out to raid another town. A train will arrive with a lot of money. Guns have to be surrendered when entering town, they are returned when leaving. [Does this apply to the townspeople?] A wagon of straw hides a shipment of guns. A train steams toward Abilene, it has a shipment of gold. [For what purpose?] The gang rounds up the townsmen and puts them in a meeting house. Darcy promises great things to the people. ""Trust me."" Darcy tells Bleeker to take Mrs. DuBois and her children out west (to avoid the coming conflict). Bleeker advises Darcy to leave town before the troops arrive. But Darcy has his own plans. ""Why?"" There is a dramatic fight in the empty saloon. Who will win? There is a final shoot-out. The military Governor keeps his word, Bleeker will get his pardon.Hollywood makes entertainment, not history. A book will educate you about this era of US history. It may be more entertaining than this movie. ""Bleeding Kansas"" was a rehearsal for the Civil War, the most destructive war in US history. The story of a gang taking over a city sounds fictional. In real life the local militia would have eliminated them (as in 1851 San Francisco). Was this meant as criticism of politics? Hammett wrote the novel ""Red Harvest"" about the control of a town by gangs and powerful landowners.

They do (the good ones do) deal with morality and social ethics.

Chandler brings  integrity and determination to his role. Parker is always good in his  homespun way. Henry Silva is also on hand demonstrating his wry presence.

The attractive French widow woman is played by Nicole Maurey.  Henry Silva plays his usual dirty slimy skunk role.  Others along for the picture's cast are Herbert Rudley, Frank DeKova, Don Megowan, Leo Gordon, Jimmy Carter, and many more you may or may not recognize.  ""The Jayhawkers"" is a pre-civil war setting (time frame) in what was then known as the Kansas Territory.  Basically the wounded gunslinger breaks out of prison and stumbles on the property of a widow, who nurses him back to health and they eventually decide to pair up.  Meanwhile, a mega maniacal outlaw with a huge gang of rough hewn men have  their hopes set upon manipulating Kansas into their own idea of Eden, and attempt accomplishing it through raids, looting, and occasionally killing.  This DVD has no extras, no subtitles, no additional language alternative, and qualifies as a ""bare bones"" packaging DVD.  Runs 1 hour and 40 minutes, excellent Vista Vision color, and the sound is as good as it was when the movie was first released, but IMHO, the talking is half as loud as the background score as the horsemen ride the transition from one part of the film to the next.  There's no sex scene in ""The Jayhawkers"" (1959) like there is in ""The Outsider"" (2002), and far less religious emphasis.  The acting is stiff and choppy, but if you like Daniel Boone, I mean, Fess Parker, that helps. There is gunfight type violence and some alcohol consumption, but otherwise no cussing, chewing, spitting, etc etc.  ** (spoiler alert) ** Although there is a sequence where the dirty slimy skunk starts attempting to rape the French widow woman but he's interrupted by the time her camisole is in view, and the skirt stays put.Actual recorded history has ""Jayhawkers"" as Kansas-based militant guerrilla fighters who railed against pro-slavery groups in Missouri known as ""Border Ruffians.""  The American patriot John Jay is credited as being the origin for the ""Jayhawker"" moniker.  This DVD's family viewable film as reviewed above, isn't the same thing, and the title for this film probably has more to do instead, with the fact that after the Civil War, people who lived in, or who hailed from, Kansas, were known as ""Jayhawkers.""",3,"not bad, but not among my favorites",1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2291,"['alleged', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Chandler', 'alleged', 'good', 'guy', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'attractive', 'French', 'widow', 'woman', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Maurey', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'usual', 'dirty', 'slimy', 'skunk', 'role', 'Others', 'picture', 'cast', 'are', 'Herbert', 'Rudley', 'Frank', 'DeKova', 'Don', 'Megowan', 'Leo', 'Gordon', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'many', 'more', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'Jayhawkers', 'pre-civil', 'war', 'setting', 'time', 'frame', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'known', 'Kansas', 'Territory', 'Basically', 'wounded', 'gunslinger', 'breaks', 'prison', 'stumbles', 'property', 'widow', 'who', 'back', 'health', 'eventually', 'decide', 'pair', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'mega', 'maniacal', 'outlaw', 'huge', 'gang', 'rough', 'hewn', 'men', 'have', 'hopes', 'set', 'manipulating', 'Kansas', 'own', 'idea', 'Eden', 'attempt', 'accomplishing', 'raids', 'looting', 'occasionally', 'killing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'additional', 'language', 'alternative', 'qualifies', 'bare', 'bones', 'packaging', 'DVD', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'excellent', 'Vista', 'Vision', 'color', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'IMHO', 'talking', 'half', 'as', 'loud', 'background', 'score', 'horsemen', 'ride', 'transition', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'next', 'sex', 'scene', 'Jayhawkers', '1959', 'Outsider', '2002', 'far', 'less', 'religious', 'emphasis', 'acting', 'stiff', 'choppy', 'like', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'mean', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'gunfight', 'type', 'violence', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'otherwise', 'cussing', 'chewing', 'spitting', 'etc', 'etc', '**', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'sequence', 'where', 'dirty', 'slimy', 'skunk', 'attempting', 'rape', 'French', 'widow', 'woman', 'interrupted', 'time', 'camisole', 'view', 'skirt', 'put.Actual', 'recorded', 'history', 'Jayhawkers', 'Kansas-based', 'militant', 'guerrilla', 'fighters', 'who', 'railed', 'pro-slavery', 'groups', 'Missouri', 'known', 'Border', 'Ruffians', 'American', 'patriot', 'John', 'Jay', 'credited', 'being', 'origin', 'Jayhawker', 'moniker', 'DVD', 'family', 'viewable', 'film', 'reviewed', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'title', 'film', 'probably', 'more', 'do', 'instead', 'fact', 'Civil', 'War', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'who', 'hailed', 'Kansas', 'were', 'known', 'Jayhawkers']",Jayhawkers VHS

Jeff Chandler steals the show as well as Kansas in one of his best ever performances (and he's had so many) as a Quantrill type ransacking Kansas towns, then reappearing with his private ""army"" to liberate the downtrodden offering protection, promising the Perfect Empire in exchange for support and loyalty. His methods prove to be very popular and our Napoleon of the plains is winning over the territory from the governor and his troops.One BIG mistake. Chandler's Darcy is responsible for the death of Parker's Cam Bleeker's wife while Cam was away in prison. Cam escapes and he wants vengence. Soon re-captured by the governor, he's offered a clean slate if he'll join the Jayhawkers and set Darcy up for capture.From here on it gets involved and plays out differently then might be expected...This is an important and must have release from Olive Films. It's a beautiful VistaVision print in glorious Technicolor, a sheer joy to watch and behold! Everyone involved is outstanding with an especially nice turn by Henry Silva as a demented psycho gunslinger, you know, just exactly what you would expect from him....Saw this on tv in the early 1960s in b&w; and liked it alot, so I was expecting to be disappointed, but this time the movie was actually far better than I had remembered it being. I was just a kid back then and so I only remembered the vague outline of what the film was about, as it was a film that somehow always escaped me throughout the years. So while watching this film anew I found myself in for a bonus.For 50 years now I had been haunted by a screen image. That of a little girl running out into the dusty street only to be run over, trampled in the frenzy by the bandits' countless horses. I couldn't remember the movie from which the scene had come from. I asked my Western film friends, but they didn't know. I actually thought that maybe I had imagined it, or that it was from some tv show. Then, it unfolded before my eyes and as it was happening I knew that this was it, the image reappeared, the horses came trampling down upon the little girl.Does she live or die? I won't say. I couldn't remember what her fate was, only the image.Finally, the Jerome Moross score. It's rousing, exciting, befitting of such an action-packed Western. And it's available on Amazon!

It's a pretty good movie, a good western... but as a film about the Jayhawkers in 1850's Kansas it's so wildly inaccurate and far from any resemblance to history that it almost defies belief.Fess Parker is good as the brooding, undecided not-quite-outlaw, and the rest of the cast is fine as well. The moral ambiguity is well done too. It's just the scenario that's the problem. This stuff just didn't happen, and in places that didn't exist.They have Fess Parker's character having been settled in Kansas before the Mexican War when Kansas wasn't really opened to settlement until years after. Then they have the army fighting the Jayhawkers for control of the kingdom of Kansas (which has a lot of astonishingly large, well-built towns in it). The Jayhawkers are a para-military band whose raids--in this movie--are entirely in Kansas, against Kansans. Missouri, which was the real target of the real Jayhawkers gets one token mention, then we're back to raids in Kansas. The real Jayhawkers were horsethieves who raided into Missouri, occassionally kidnapping a slave so they could claim to be abolitionists (to be fair, a few were genuine abolitionists). The movie's Jayhawkers wore &quot;Redlegs&quot; leggings but no mention of Jennison is made. There's also not a single African-American in the entire movie though there's a brief mention of--I think they called them--&quot;Missouri Redlegs&quot; killing a lady's husband after asking his opinion of slavery.It's bizarre. It's like they had the script for a stock western then went through and inserted a few pre-Civil War Kansas-Missouri border war phrases without bothering to find out anything about them. The women's costumes were decidedly not 1850s--looked more like generic 1870's-80's Hollywood western outfits. And the weapons... I'm not an expert on 1850's weapons but it struck me as more than passingly odd that everyone had such very fine repeating rifles. Oh, and a big chunk of the plot relied on the very extensive railroad that existed in this universe's 1850's Kansas.As a nice old western, this is a fine little adventure movie.

289742,A220FJEQNGMSRN,630199616X,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","An uncharacteristic drama in a career dominated by comedies like The Court Jester and A Touch of Class, Melvin Frank's The Jayhawkers! is an ambitious Western drama with some interesting psychological undercurrents as Fess Parker's escaped convict is promised his freedom if he can deliver Jeff Chandler's ruthless empire builder for execution. Rather than the customary cattle king or ruthless outlaw, Chandler's got bigger plans, forming a private army of Jayhawkers to seize control of Kansas and turn it into his personal kingdom. Masquerading as brutal redlegs brutally pillaging small towns and then `liberating' them under their own colours, he's a keen student of history as well as a callous womaniser who uses women like wine - when the bottle is empty, he just throws the bottle away, with one difference ""With a wine you sometimes learn the name, with women never."" And wouldn't you know it, one of the women he threw away and left to die in the gutter was Parker's wife. But Parker falls under the spell of his big ideas and powerful personality, and it's not a one-way attraction. Chandler clearly has a more than fraternal interest in his latest recruit, casting aside former favourite Henry Silva and even killing his own men when they threaten Parker because ""Nobody cheats me out of you!""Chandler dominates the film as the would-be dictator with a fear of being hung to dance on the end of a rope ""like a clown"" and something of a Napoleon complex (he even keeps a bust of the man in his home and gets Parker to read up on his campaigns) but who, as Nicole Maurey's French widow points out in the odd less than subtle nod to 20th century history, is just fooling the gullible to further his own ends. Often a better actor than his material, he has particularly strong material here and rises to the challenge admirably, leaving Parker's solid turn in the lead distinctly one dimensional by comparison. Silva, often either enjoyably over the top or disinterestedly walking through parts in many of his films is particularly impressive here as his homicidal spurned puppy as well. Sadly the film's climax is a bit underwhelming as the two protagonists go mano a mano in an abandoned bar while the sounds of offscreen battle rage around them before the film regains its footing, and at times the budgetary limitations show (some of the exterior locations are very noticeably studio interiors or backlots), but all told it works more than well enough to forgive the shortcomings. It's also helped along by a terrific Jerome Moross score that's got more than a hint of his previous year's The Big Country to it, while you can spot an unbilled Harry Dean Stanton as a lawman in an early scene.Olive Films' region-free Blu-ray disc is for the most part an impressive widescreen transfer that is more than sharp enough to show why the VistaVision system the film was shot in used to herald itself as `Motion Picture High-Fidelity,' though also clear enough to see a few scratches and slight tramlines on the negative around a couple of reel changes, some of the latter, because the film ran through the camera sideways, horizontal rather than vertical.
