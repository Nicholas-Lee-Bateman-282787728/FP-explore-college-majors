Before Grandma bought this, we had been reading a few books on shapes and my son was catching on pretty quickly.  I think that this program is helping to reinforce his newly acquired knowledge--he is recognizing circles, squares, triangles and ovals in everyday objects like plates, tiles, etc.I have to admit that the muppet gameshow host featured here is a little annoying, but so are the human ones at one time or another!  I think that he adds to the fun of the show.  Also parents, we need to remember that DVDs such as these are not really for our entertainment and try to watch through the eyes of our little sponges.I recommend this to kids who are hungry to learn and have parents that are excited to help.",5,Great DVD for avid little learners!,1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,839,"['First', 'must', 'say', 'hate', 'see', 'negative', 'reviews', 'product', 'son', 'almost', '2', 'absolutely', 'DVD', 'Grandma', 'bought', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'few', 'books', 'shapes', 'son', 'was', 'catching', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'think', 'program', 'helping', 'reinforce', 'newly', 'acquired', 'knowledge', 'recognizing', 'circles', 'squares', 'triangles', 'ovals', 'everyday', 'objects', 'plates', 'tiles', 'etc.I', 'have', 'admit', 'muppet', 'gameshow', 'host', 'featured', 'here', 'little', 'annoying', 'so', 'are', 'human', 'ones', 'one', 'time', 'think', 'fun', 'show', 'Also', 'parents', 'need', 'remember', 'DVDs', 'such', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'entertainment', 'try', 'watch', 'eyes', 'little', 'sponges.I', 'recommend', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'hungry', 'learn', 'have', 'parents', 'are', 'excited', 'help']",N/A

If I had it to do over again, I probably would have skipped it.  The program is a little strange in that it is a game-show format and they created the host to be just as annoying as they are in real life.  Not so enjoyable to watch and I find my daughter just isn't into it.
