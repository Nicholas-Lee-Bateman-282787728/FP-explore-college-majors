821611,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00022EEDU,bookloversfriend,"[13, 15]","I did not feel the movie at all sugary and ""sentimental"".  One of the friends reveals she's dying.  If the characters did not express sentiment, they'd be sociopaths.  The movie was slow-paced, but not painfully so, and the scenery was beautiful.  The film contains a wedding to end all weddings, certain to please many people.  My only quibble with the movie is the music played at the wedding.  It needed to be joyful and I'm sure the filmmaker thought this music was, but to me it was determined, abandoned, maybe defiant.  I would have preferred something more emotionally in tune with the rest of the music of the film.  Watching this movie a second time last night, I was reminded of the novel ""Last Things, First Things.""  Both are set largely on a beautiful island, both deal with death, both involve love and relationships, yet both manage to be upbeat with satisfying endings.",4,touching movie about friendship and relationships,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,886,"['did', 'not', 'feel', 'movie', 'sugary', 'sentimental', 'One', 'friends', 'dying', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'express', 'sentiment', ""'d"", 'be', 'sociopaths', 'movie', 'was', 'slow-paced', 'not', 'painfully', 'so', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'wedding', 'end', 'weddings', 'certain', 'please', 'many', 'people', 'only', 'quibble', 'movie', 'music', 'played', 'wedding', 'needed', 'be', 'joyful', ""'m"", 'sure', 'filmmaker', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'was', 'determined', 'abandoned', 'maybe', 'defiant', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'something', 'more', 'emotionally', 'tune', 'rest', 'music', 'film', 'Watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'reminded', 'novel', 'Last', 'Things', 'First', 'Things', 'are', 'set', 'largely', 'beautiful', 'island', 'deal', 'death', 'involve', 'love', 'relationships', 'yet', 'manage', 'be', 'upbeat', 'satisfying', 'endings']",Under the Lighthouse Dancing
