It reminds us to take that risk called love. The main female character in this movie would have married this man, but eventhough he thought so much about her, he used every excuse not to commit. Sounds like many young men in our day today. Given everything freely but chosing not to love...very sad.",5,"Liked this movie, but left me feeling quite sad...",1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,380,"['agree', 'what', 'Nightwater', 'commented', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'sad', 'take', 'risk', 'called', 'love', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'man', 'thought', 'so', 'much', 'used', 'excuse', 'not', 'commit', 'Sounds', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'day', 'today', 'Given', 'everything', 'freely', 'chosing', 'not', 'love', 'very', 'sad']",N/A

The first, is wanting something, and the second, is getting it!""  A young couple meet on a blind date. Actually, the girl contacted two men.  One, the least attractive, grows impatient and leaves.  The scene is set.  They spend the night together and eventually go their own way when she decides to marry a doctor.  He is a part-time literature teacher and feels incapable of leading a married life and supporting a family.  She wants the best and he knows his limitations.  She marries the doctor but cannot live without the man she loves.  A very painful situation.  The conclusion was accurate.  First rate acting  Honesty is a rare commodity in films today.

It's a guy who's afraid of committing, proccupied with his inability to support a wife, and untrusting of women in general.What makes the movie great is the fact that it rises above cliches & superficial ""goody-too-shoes"" hollywood hype. Rather, the story holds true to how modern society causes tremendous insecurities in couples. The female character marries a doctor in spite of the fact that she wants to be with the part-time literature professor. But this idiot prof doesn't feel that he's ""worthy."" Sound familiar?I would encourage couples to check this movie out. And after it finishes, talk about their own situation. If you want tripe, go rent some supercificial hollywood hogwash.
