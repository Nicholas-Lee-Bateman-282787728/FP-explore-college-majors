1672053,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B00FLT6YWI,AKN,"[0, 0]","I went to this, which is only playing in a local art house theater, because I like movies about women that you don't see all the time. How many movies are made about women over 50? While this can't hold a candle to another recent movie about an older woman, Philomena, this has some things to recommend it.We see Gloria dancing at a local dance hall in Santiago Chile of all places. She is vibrant and lively and loves to dance. Soon she attracts the attention of an over 60 man, Rudolpho, handsome and seemingly infatuated with Gloria. A torrid love affair blossoms, and there were some frontal nudity scenes I personally could have done without. I haven't before seen any scenes in movies of older people getting busy or smooching, but this had enough of that for a lifetime.I won't give away the plot. But this is all about the charming and full of life Gloria as she goes to her boring office job, interacts with her grown children, and goes dancing at her favorite dance hall. I admit to finding long stretches of this boring. The plot was a little bit thin. I did enjoy the scenery of Chile and seeing the living standard of its citizens which appeared to be very nice. There were a few musical numbers that were lovely.Clearly the spirited Gloria needed a good man to enjoy life with, and her chances of finding one seemed dim, even though she was attractive and reasonably well preserved. She was young at heart, healthy and warm hearted. This movie was certainly different and while there was little action or plot through long parts of it, it was worth seeing if you enjoy movies that aren't run of the mill.",4,A Movie About an Over 50 Woman?,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1618,"['went', 'only', 'playing', 'local', 'art', 'house', 'theater', 'like', 'movies', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'time', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'women', '50', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'recent', 'movie', 'older', 'woman', 'Philomena', 'things', 'recommend', 'it.We', 'see', 'Gloria', 'dancing', 'local', 'dance', 'hall', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'places', 'vibrant', 'lively', 'dance', 'Soon', 'attention', '60', 'man', 'Rudolpho', 'handsome', 'seemingly', 'infatuated', 'Gloria', 'A', 'torrid', 'love', 'affair', 'blossoms', 'were', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'scenes', 'personally', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'have', ""n't"", 'before', 'seen', 'scenes', 'movies', 'older', 'people', 'getting', 'busy', 'smooching', 'had', 'enough', 'lifetime.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'charming', 'full', 'life', 'Gloria', 'boring', 'office', 'job', 'grown', 'children', 'dancing', 'favorite', 'dance', 'hall', 'admit', 'finding', 'long', 'stretches', 'boring', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'thin', 'did', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'Chile', 'seeing', 'living', 'standard', 'citizens', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'were', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'lovely.Clearly', 'spirited', 'Gloria', 'needed', 'good', 'man', 'enjoy', 'life', 'chances', 'finding', 'one', 'seemed', 'dim', 'even', 'was', 'attractive', 'reasonably', 'well', 'preserved', 'was', 'young', 'heart', 'healthy', 'warm', 'hearted', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'different', 'was', 'little', 'action', 'plot', 'long', 'parts', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'run', 'mill']",Gloria

1672058,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FLT6YWI,Paul Allaer,"[10, 11]","&#34;Gloria&#34; (2013 release from Chile; 100 min.) brings the story of Gloria (played by Paulina Garcia), a fifty-something divorced woman. As the movie opens, we find Gloria in a dance club with Donna Summer's &#34;I Feel Love&#34; blasting away. Gloria is alone, but certainly not lonely. She loves to dance, and she attracts the attention of others. Pretty soon, Gloria makes the acquaintance of Rodolfo, a sixty-something who is also divorced, yet emotionally still close to his ex-wife and even more so his two grown daughters. Meanwhile, we get to also know Gloria's grown kids: her son Pedro is taking care of a new baby, and her daughter Ana is involved with her boyfriend from Sweden. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this is one great 'little' movie about the free-spirited Gloria. One can't help but marvel at the &#34;joie de vivre&#34; which Gloria lives by, even if things are not always easy or don't always go her way. Second, what can you say about the towering performance from Paulina Garcia in the title role! She is in virtually every frame of the movie, and she will blow you away. She brings a daring performance on every level. Co-star Sergio Hernandez as romantic interest Rodolfo is pretty good too. Beware: there are a number of nude scenes between these two, which may make uncomfortable viewing for some. I must say that I am surprised--and disappointed--that Paulina Garcia, who has won a number of international prizes for this performance (including &#34;Best Actress&#34; at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, where this movie premiered), did not even get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Third, there are a couple of key scenes in the movie that will stay with you, none better in my opinion than the awkward family reunion on Pedro's birthday, with Gloria's ex-husband and his new wife, and Gloria introducing Rodolfo to her family for the first time. Just watch what happens. Last but not least: there is a ton of great music in the movie, including of course Umberto Tozzi's late 70s classic &#34;Gloria&#34; (Laura Branigan's cover version a few years later became a monster hit in the US).This movie reminded me of the 1978 classic &#34;An Unmarried Woman&#34; starring Jill Clayburgh (I think she even won the Best Actress Oscar for this). Certainly these two movies are similar in spirit, if nothing else. &#34;Gloria&#34; opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and when I went to see it this weekend, the matinee screening was surprisingly well attended, which is great news. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie with stellar performances, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;Gloria&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"Post-divorce ""joie de vivre"", Chilean style",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,2809,"['34', 'Gloria', '34', '2013', 'release', 'Chile', '100', 'min', 'story', 'Gloria', 'played', 'Paulina', 'Garcia', 'fifty-something', 'divorced', 'woman', 'movie', 'find', 'Gloria', 'dance', 'club', 'Donna', 'Summer', '34', 'Feel', 'Love', '34', 'blasting', 'away', 'Gloria', 'alone', 'certainly', 'not', 'lonely', 'dance', 'attention', 'others', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Gloria', 'acquaintance', 'Rodolfo', 'sixty-something', 'who', 'also', 'divorced', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'still', 'close', 'ex-wife', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'two', 'grown', 'daughters', 'Meanwhile', 'get', 'also', 'know', 'Gloria', 'grown', 'kids', 'son', 'Pedro', 'taking', 'care', 'new', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Ana', 'involved', 'boyfriend', 'Sweden', 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'free-spirited', 'Gloria', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'marvel', '34', 'joie', 'vivre', '34', 'Gloria', 'even', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'way', 'Second', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'towering', 'performance', 'Paulina', 'Garcia', 'title', 'role', 'virtually', 'frame', 'movie', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'daring', 'performance', 'level', 'Co-star', 'Sergio', 'Hernandez', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Rodolfo', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Beware', 'are', 'number', 'nude', 'scenes', 'two', 'may', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'Paulina', 'Garcia', 'who', 'won', 'number', 'international', 'prizes', 'performance', 'including', '34', 'Best', 'Actress', '34', '2013', 'Berlin', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'movie', 'premiered', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Third', 'are', 'couple', 'key', 'scenes', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'none', 'better', 'opinion', 'awkward', 'family', 'reunion', 'Pedro', 'birthday', 'Gloria', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'introducing', 'Rodolfo', 'family', 'first', 'time', 'Just', 'watch', 'what', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'ton', 'great', 'music', 'movie', 'including', 'course', 'Umberto', 'Tozzi', 'late', '70s', 'classic', '34', 'Gloria', '34', 'Laura', 'Branigan', 'cover', 'version', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'became', 'monster', 'hit', 'US', '.This', 'movie', 'reminded', '1978', 'classic', '34', 'Unmarried', 'Woman', '34', 'starring', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'think', 'even', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Certainly', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'similar', 'spirit', 'nothing', 'else', '34', 'Gloria', '34', 'opened', 'last', 'weekend', 'local', 'art-house', 'theater', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'weekend', 'matinee', 'screening', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'attended', 'great', 'news', 'are', 'mood', 'top-notch', 'foreign', 'movie', 'stellar', 'performances', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', '34', 'Gloria', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Gloria
1672059,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00FLT6YWI,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","At 58, Gloria is in the midst of a midlife crisis. Divorced and with a seemingly strained relationship with her adult children, Gloria is also coping with a mundane job, a potentially psychotic upstairs neighbor, and days on end of perpetual loneliness (and, oh yes, a creepy hairless cat that keeps coming over for a visit). Until, that is, she meets Rodolpho, a divorced ex-naval officer, who has the opposite problem from Gloria: he&#8217;s TOO intimately involved with the lives of his grown daughters, so much so that he is unable to devote the time needed to nurture his relationship with Gloria.On the surface, &#8220;Gloria&#8221; feels like most of the other midlife crisis films we&#8217;ve seen, but the strength of this Chilean/Spanish co-production lies in its naturalism and in its focus on revelatory detail. Writer Gonzalo Maza and writer/director Sebastian Lelio provide enough specifics to make this a very particular story about a very particular woman. That manages to keep Gloria a sympathetic figure even when her understandable unhappiness begins to slide over into self-pity. The movie also refuses to tie its story up in a nice, neat little bow at the end to cater to audience expectations.Paulina Garcia won a number of awards, all richly deserved, for her nuanced, fully-developed portrayal of a woman whose life is all but put under a microscope for all the world to see. Yet, Garcia meets the challenge with a bravery rare for actresses her age. Sergio Hernandez matches her as the man who comes into Gloria&#8217;s life but who may be bringing plenty of his own baggage right along with him.Yet, for all its insight into late-in-life romance, the movie ultimately reveals that middle-aged lovers are often every bit as petulant, jealous and overly sensitive - not to mention, clueless - as the greenest teen when it comes to affairs of the heart.
