351022,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,6303019927,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[17, 18]","In 1986, a New Jersey state court sent Robert O. Marshall, a fomer insurance executive, to Death Row after a jury found him guilty in the murder-for-hire two years earlier of his wife, Maria. Earlier this year - 2006 - an appeallate court vacated the death sentence and reduced Marshall's sentence to life. That development rekindles this 1990 NBC-TV pic based on the true-crime novel by Joe McGinnis (of controversial ""Fatal Vision"" fame). ""Blind Faith"" is a compelling and faithful telling of the dynamics that trigger Maria Marshall's arranged killing in September 1984 and is so titled in reference to the painful acceptance by the couple's three sons that their father may have hired the gun that killed their mother. The late Robert Urich has the enormous burden of portraying the cowardly sociopath and self-indulgent, self-absorbed Marshall. As a hard-driven insurance salesman with a drop-dead beautiful wife and three privileged children in an upper middle class Norman Rockwell neighborhood in Toms River, N.J., Marshall was - according to prosecution evidence - drowning in debt to the tune of more than $300,000. Motivated by a $1.5 million life insurance policy on his wife, along with his carrying on an extramarital fling with a local vixen, Marshall conconcts the murder-for-hire scheme to get his wife out of the picture and thereby living happily ever after with his debt wiped out (with about $1.2 million left for pocket change) and frolicking openly with his new squeeze. Urich is magnificent in the role and plays Marshall with no redeeming qualities. As Marshall's doomed spouse, Joanna Kerns is her husband's antithesis that, also by most published sources, defined the real lady. Though Maria knows nothing of her fate, she's painfully aware of her husband's philandering but discards a planned divorce to salvage her marriage (why to man like her husband is a mystery). Along with Maria as a victim, though, are the couple's three sons, played wrenchingly by Jay Underwood, David Barry Gray and Johnny Galecki. And an A-list of other supporting players makes ""Blind Faith"" an overall well-acted piece, including Doris Roberts (""Everyone Loves Raymond"") as a well-intentioned but totally blind family friend whose support of Rob Marshall never waivers; superlative character actor Dennis Farina as the prosecutor who sets his sights on justice; William Forsythe and David Andrews as the two hired guns; and daytime soap femme fatal Robin Strasser as Marshall's on-the-side squeeze. But it is Urich's showcase in this one, and so convincing is he that our final word about the real Marshall is good riddance.",4,A killer in the family,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,2633,"['1986', 'New', 'Jersey', 'state', 'court', 'sent', 'Robert', 'O.', 'Marshall', 'fomer', 'insurance', 'executive', 'Death', 'Row', 'jury', 'found', 'guilty', 'murder-for-hire', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Earlier', 'year', '2006', 'appeallate', 'court', 'vacated', 'death', 'sentence', 'reduced', 'Marshall', 'sentence', 'life', 'development', '1990', 'NBC-TV', 'pic', 'based', 'true-crime', 'novel', 'Joe', 'McGinnis', 'controversial', 'Fatal', 'Vision', 'fame', 'Faith', 'compelling', 'faithful', 'telling', 'dynamics', 'trigger', 'Maria', 'Marshall', 'arranged', 'killing', 'September', '1984', 'so', 'titled', 'reference', 'painful', 'acceptance', 'couple', 'three', 'sons', 'father', 'may', 'have', 'hired', 'gun', 'killed', 'mother', 'late', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'enormous', 'burden', 'portraying', 'cowardly', 'sociopath', 'self-indulgent', 'self-absorbed', 'Marshall', 'hard-driven', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'drop-dead', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'three', 'privileged', 'children', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'neighborhood', 'Toms', 'River', 'N.J.', 'Marshall', 'was', 'according', 'prosecution', 'evidence', 'drowning', 'debt', 'tune', 'more', '300,000', 'Motivated', '1.5', 'million', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'wife', 'carrying', 'extramarital', 'fling', 'local', 'vixen', 'Marshall', 'murder-for-hire', 'scheme', 'get', 'wife', 'picture', 'thereby', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'debt', 'wiped', 'out', 'about', '1.2', 'million', 'left', 'pocket', 'change', 'frolicking', 'openly', 'new', 'squeeze', 'Urich', 'magnificent', 'role', 'Marshall', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Marshall', 'doomed', 'spouse', 'Joanna', 'Kerns', 'husband', 'antithesis', 'also', 'most', 'published', 'sources', 'defined', 'real', 'lady', 'Maria', 'nothing', 'fate', 'painfully', 'aware', 'husband', 'philandering', 'discards', 'planned', 'divorce', 'salvage', 'marriage', 'why', 'man', 'husband', 'mystery', 'Maria', 'victim', 'are', 'couple', 'three', 'sons', 'played', 'wrenchingly', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'David', 'Barry', 'Gray', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'A-list', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'Blind', 'Faith', 'overall', 'well-acted', 'piece', 'including', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'well-intentioned', 'totally', 'blind', 'family', 'friend', 'support', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'never', 'waivers', 'superlative', 'character', 'actor', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'sights', 'justice', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'David', 'Andrews', 'two', 'hired', 'guns', 'daytime', 'soap', 'femme', 'fatal', 'Robin', 'Strasser', 'Marshall', 'on-the-side', 'squeeze', 'Urich', 'showcase', 'one', 'so', 'convincing', 'final', 'word', 'real', 'Marshall', 'good', 'riddance']",Blind Faith VHS
