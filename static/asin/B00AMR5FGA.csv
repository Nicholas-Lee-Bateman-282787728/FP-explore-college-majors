1613420,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00AMR5FGA,Adam,"[0, 0]","The Bible is an interesting series. Alternately, it is awe-inspiringly good, and amazingly bad. It was a series where you felt directorial presence in every scene and some you just had to scratch your head about.The series took five episodes to focus on the Old Testament and five to focus on the New Testament.Let's go ahead and give some plaudits to what the series got right. The opening sequence to the series aboard Noah's Ark was awe-inspiring and a truly effective way to summarize those pivotal first few chapters of Genesis. They did a great job in the Abraham story making Abraham and Sarah's infertility and their joy at the birth of Isaac real and powerful.I also have to say that their portrayal of Jesus' passion while not as visually visceral as the Passion of the Christ, managed to be dramatic, using sound and reaction shots from those watching really creating a great effect.I also liked how the producers used the Old Testament episodes to emphasize the coming of Christ. It was a great use of foreshadowing.In the producers defense, most of their changes are understandable given the limits of this project. I get the idea of skipping the renaming of Abram to Abraham, and Saul to Paul. I get the idea of combining the biblical characters of Cyrus the Great and Darius the Meade. It saves time and moves the story forward within the limits given the project. I'll also say that unlike the movie, ""Noah,"" none of their changes besmirched God's character or really even that of Biblical heroes.That said, the program had a lot of problems. The biggest one may have been the scope of the project, which required massively condensed story lines. The idea that you're going to take 45 minutes and tell the story of Joshua's conquest of the Promised Land and Samson is crazy, and it's even more insane to imagine that you can cover the story of King Saul, King David, and also throw in David and Bathsheba in the same story. And jamming the Resurrection and the first six decades of church history into 45 minutes really hurt the whole episode. What happened is that they ended up with stories that lose their punch. It may save time to have Samson give into Delilah on her first request to know the secret of his strength, but it's certainly not as dramatically interesting, and it hurt Samson's character.This series needed to be twice as long or to have multiple series so that you could do the subject justice. Also, sometimes this was the producers' own fault. Episode 5 focused on Daniel, yet the first ten minutes focused on the Fall of Jerusalem and the Captivity and the occurred there so that we could see King Zedekiah's sons killed before his eyes than Zedekiah's eyes poked out. The event was biblically accurate but unnecessary for a number of reasons, most notably that Daniel and his friends were taken in a previous captivity before the Fall of Jerusalem. Why do this when those ten minutes could better be used to do Daniel's story justice, particularly since they already skipped ahead 400 years.The violence in this program was often just plain silly like the angels with swords being Angelic Samurai in Sodom and Gomorrah. It became critical that if the show could include sword fights in any scene, it would include them I don't think it added to the production or helped that they went for so many gross out points such as King Herod' s leeches. I tend to think less violence is more as the violence is more powerful if we haven't had it in every episode.The New Testament section's biggest flaws was its rushed resurrection and birth of the church section that left so much untold that really would have added value.  Then there was Diogo Morgado, who played Jesus. Outside of the Passion scene, Morgado's performance was and lifeless and limp as most performances of the role of Christ. The worst scene for Morgado was where he told a little girl that not one stone of the Temple would be left standing upon another in the same tone you might say, ""You're a pretty little girl, yes you are.""Morgado wasn't helped by a script that, in its attempt to avoid Christianese and explaining ancient traditions, substituted cliches. The seventh episode ends with Jesus telling Peter that they're going to ""change the world."" And we get rid of the scene where Peter is told to eat unclean animals as a sign that God wants to reach out to gentiles and instead have Jesus giving Peter an attaboy and hinting and telling gentiles. These efforts tend to suck the flavor out of scriptural stories.The series was frustrating for me. Every time I'd see a brilliant decision made, I'd see it followed up by one that left me scratching my head and wondering, ""What were they thinking?""If others enjoyed it and were blessed by it more than I, more power to them.  And if the series gets people to actually read the Bible to find out what actually happened,  than I salute the producers. From my perspective though, this miniseries tried to do too much and did much of it poorly.",3,The Book Was Better,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,4998,"['Bible', 'interesting', 'series', 'Alternately',

This alone creates a huge gap of credibility for me.  Given the landscape chosen to depict the holy land, all the English characters appeared grossly out of place. And the series may be ambitious in scope, but epic??? Not even close. Most of the individual stories are superficial in their portrayals, and many equally important bible stories were glossed over or even omitted. It's okay to present select parts of the Bible, but please, let's not call it epic. Many details of the individual stories were altered or embellished for, I suppose, dramatic effect, thus the need for a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode, always a warning that the content will be altered beyond the approval of many.

It's pretty common that &#34;the movie is never as good as the book,&#34; and this is no different.

They stick to the heart of the message (trust in God, work towards the Promised Land, love and forgiveness, etc) in a truly awesome manner. For example, the line Moses says to Pharaoh as God's people are crossing the Red Sea. ""You're not a god. There is only one god....and He is with us."" Moses might not have said EXACTLY that in the Bible but it is the spirit of the scene and it's a badass boast worthy of any action movie.There's lots of other cool stuff in the Old Testament: Samson and his massacre with the donkey's jaw bone, Joshua's conquest of Jerico, etc but the message is always prominent. It doesn't get buried in ""Hollywood"" action or drama etc. ""God is with you. Trust in Him and He will help you.""The New Testament is also great. Jesus is portrayed as humble and compassionate and wise and authoritive. The scene where he converts Matthew is breathtaking. I was afarid the 'chasing out the money lenders' scene would be cut for being too violent or whatever but no, it's here. The producers don't flinch away from it. Jesus looks around then overturns the tables and calls the people out for turning a 'house of prayer' into a 'den of thieves'.I don't understand why the 1 star reviewers are so mad. To cover every event in the Bible in full detail would have taken all year. I was disappointed that parts of Samson's story were left out (the lion scene and the following riddle, for instance) but Samson lived for decades. His life could be a mini-series in and off itself.

But reading is one thing, and watching is another, although most movies about Biblical history -- &#34;Cleopatra&#34; with Elizabeth Taylor in particular -- are absolutely unwatchable.  People in film always seem to speak in &#34;high English&#34; and it just comes across as fake.  But not here.If you've seen &#34;The Passion of the Christ,&#34; and you liked it (while I thought it was a tremendous film, it's still hard to recommend and I couldn't watch it twice due to the brutality) then I believe that you will like &#34;The Bible.&#34;  Now, I've only seen &#34;In the Beginning&#34; and &#34;Exodus,&#34; but they were really good.  There is, yes, sex and violence, but hey, that's what goes on in the real world so just deal with it already.  And the dialog was believable.  So I found this to be far more realistic than most Biblical movies or shows that I've seen.I did have a minor chuckle at one point, I have to admit.  When Moses comes down from the mountain carrying the 10 Commandments I laughed, not because the scene was intentionally funny, but due to the irony of the situation.  Just a few minutes earlier in the film, he had parted the Red Sea to &#34;let his people go&#34; through, but then released the water on the Egyptians, killing them through drowning.  Now of course, the 10 Commandments has &#34;Thou Shalt not Kill&#34; listed as one of those commandments and there would be the irony.  Well, The Bible does have some inconsistencies in it, like it or not.  How do you resolve those inconsistencies?  Well, I do believe that The Bible was written by many people with many different viewpoints.  And humans are quite flawed.But this series, while not being flawless, is pretty God-dang excellent.

Adam and Eve get a couple seconds, Cain and Abel half a second, Noah with the usual circus animals maybe five seconds, and we get to the first substantial segment, Abraham. After this there is no attempt even to summarize the copious missing material (e.g. Jacob and Esau, Joseph and his brothers).There are a number of interesting rough edges smoothed over in a manner all too typical of Bible adaptations. For example, Moses follows the tradition of bravely commanding Pharaoh, ""Let my people go!"" But in the Bible, Moses rather meekly attempts to con Pharaoh with the idea that the Hebrews need to go into the desert for a three-day sacrifice ceremony. (And, oh yes, they'll need all their cattle because the Lord will pick out the sacrifice on site.) Pharaoh isn't fooled for a minute. A more important rough edge obliterated from this story is that Pharaoh decides to let the Hebrews go after each of the plagues, but the Lord hardens his heart because He is anxious to use all His plagues. (No, I'm not making this up. Read the Bible.)The most dishonest segment shows King David celebrating the arrival of the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem while his wife Michal looks on admiringly. In the Bible, David celebrates by getting drunk and dancing naked in the streets. His wife -- the woman who saved his life, the woman who (I'm reading between the lines here), as the daughter of the former king, did much to legitimize his usurpation of the throne, is scandalized and berates David. David shows his gratitude by cursing her with barrenness.I guess most believers are happy to get the sanitized and bowdlerized version, but someday I'd love to see a warts-and-all adaptation of the Word of God.",1,Read the dead tree version,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1777,"['Bible', 'could', 'more', 'honestly', 'be', 'called', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Bible', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'get', 'couple', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'second', 'Noah', 'usual', 'circus', 'animals', 'maybe', 'five', 'seconds', 'get', 'first', 'substantial', 'segment', 'Abraham', 'attempt', 'even', 'summarize', 'copious', 'missing', 'material', 'e.g', 'Jacob', 'Esau', 'Joseph', 'brothers', 'are', 'number', 'interesting', 'rough', 'edges', 'smoothed', 'manner', 'too', 'typical', 'Bible', 'adaptations', 'example', 'Moses', 'tradition', 'bravely', 'commanding', 'Pharaoh', 'Let', 'people', 'go', 'Bible', 'Moses', 'rather', 'meekly', 'attempts', 'con', 'Pharaoh', 'idea', 'Hebrews', 'need', 'go', 'desert', 'three-day', 'sacrifice', 'ceremony', 'oh', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'need', 'cattle', 'Lord', 'will', 'pick', 'out', 'sacrifice', 'site', 'Pharaoh', ""n't"", 'fooled', 'minute', 'more', 'important', 'rough', 'edge', 'obliterated', 'story', 'Pharaoh', 'let', 'Hebrews', 'go', 'plagues', 'Lord', 'heart', 'anxious', 'use', 'plagues', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up', 'Read', 'Bible', 'most', 'dishonest', 'segment', 'shows', 'King', 'David', 'celebrating', 'arrival', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'Jerusalem', 'wife', 'Michal', 'admiringly', 'Bible', 'David', 'getting', 'drunk', 'dancing', 'naked', 'streets', 'wife', 'woman', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'woman', 'who', ""'m"", 'reading', 'lines', 'here', 'daughter', 'former', 'king', 'did', 'much', 'legitimize', 'usurpation', 'throne', 'scandalized', 'David', 'David', 'gratitude', 'cursing', 'barrenness.I', 'guess', 'most', 'believers', 'are', 'happy', 'get', 'sanitized', 'bowdlerized', 'version', 'someday', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'warts-and-all', 'adaptation', 'Word', 'God']",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

1613506,AY8THNLBY3IPL,B00AMR5FGA,Daniel L. Carter,"[5, 10]","If you have never read the Bible, do not think for one second that watching this abomination will give you anything close to a good understanding of what the Bible teaches. I've only watched disk one of four so far that I borrowed from my church, which is a Bible believing church, but for some odd reason wound up buying this movie. If you are a Christian(as I am) you may want to borrow this video sometime, rather than wasting any money on nonsense such as this, just so you can speak with people that may know a lot about this movie but not much about what the Bible actually teaches. Unfortunately I have already made arrangements to watch the Son of God movie that came right out of this series with my pastor and others this Wednesday, so I am hoping that they managed to get the New Testament a whole lot better that they have done the Old, otherwise me, my pastor and our whole church may be having some big discussions triggered by this nonsense. But God does cause all things to work together for good, for those that love Him Romans 8:28. I may be adding to this review later.Now I have watched disc 2 of 4 and it is crazy how carefree these guys were about flippantly adding to and taking away from what the Bible teaches. Disc 2 has already started covering a bit of the life of Jesus and I now know in advance that I will be wasting money to see this Son of God movie, but maybe I'll do a video review of that for the internet, they showed the temptation of Christ and it was interesting how Jesus avoided saying ""It is written"" or giving any allusions that He was directly quoting from the word of God to answer the very obviously demonic evil looking Satan.update 3/6/2014What bothers me the most with the Bible Miniseries is that most of the believers in God come across as nearly delusional, almost like they have the make believe friend that atheists would like to accuse anyone who believes in God of having. The Son of God movie was not as bad as I had feared, I would not discourage people from seeing that movie, though it does have some scenes that are not directly in line with Biblical teachings. I liked the way the Son of God Movie wrapped up and its closing song ""Mary did you know"". There are not a lot of direct contradictions in this series, but a lot of misleading scenes. The Ark scenes showed a very leaky ark. When Abraham offered his son(not actually killing him of course) the series made it look like he and Isaac went straight from home to the mountain alone. When Moses leads the children of Israel out of Egypt the ten plagues were done very strangely in the movie, Moses turns the water to blood as pharaoh is bathing in the water. The crossing of the red sea is weird with what looks like about three hundred people making up the children of Israel needing to quickly pass through the parted Red Sea with the Egyptians right behind them. In the series and also in the Son of God movie Jesus enters the tomb and kisses Lazarus on the forehead to raise him from the dead. The Bible indicates Jesus was outside of the tomb and called Lazarus forth, he came out tomb with his grave clothes and head covering still on and Jesus had those who witnessed this loose him from the clothes. I would recommend that if possible borrow this series from someone and watch it.

1613513,A1W27EA93ZNQF1,B00AMR5FGA,"Dead to self ""Agape Don Kie Tu in Yashua""","[32, 43]","I have read a few that are having a problem with us Bible Thumpers.  (Sorry that just reminds me of a picture of a rabbit holding a Bible).  The idea of a Scriptural error filled movie making people more hungry for God, is only making them more hungry for a false God the movie portrays.  How can one know the Biblical God?  By Reading the Word of God.  I Love God's Word, and when someone takes away God's Glory by changing the stories there is no way one can debate that as acceptable.  Would you like someone take your word out of context?  No, you would not.  So why debate any good reasons to accept an attack on God's Word.  Think about it, if you believe in God, you also know about Satan.  Satan loves to twist Gods word ... go ahead and read the debate between Eve and the Serpent.  The serpent/Satan uses ""Did God really Say ...???""  So if Satan twists the Word of God, do you really want to argue that this is good?Lets look at a few of the problems: I watched about 10+ minutes of the 7+ hours, in bits a pieces but EVERY Story that I did see, was filled with Scriptural errors just to make the movie more exciting??? (In the order I can remember them).Gen 19:1-10 Two angels are sent to rescue Lot and his family. In scripture The angels make the men blind, the movie makes them Ninja Angels. Gods angels swords can cut the world in half, if God would allow them, .... think about it which makes ""give God glory"" sense? Ninja angels that can be seen in most martial art movies, or a large group of men all becoming blind? Me, I think it would even be more funny with a bunch of men running around blind screaming, and in the next scene one guy say ""Man that is hot rain!"". (The hot rain could be added due to the next scene is Lot and family leaving the city, and the WORD of GOD does not cover what happened in the city as FIRE Rained down.JOSH 2:1-18, 6:22-24. In Scripture Rahab a prostitute protected the Israelite spies from the King, due to she chose to. The Scarlet rope was hung on the window on the outside wall, and the spies climbed down it, and it was used to identify her, and her family. In the Movie, the Spies threaten her with a sword to her throat and threaten to kill her family if she does not hide them. The rope is hung on a post outside the door, and the Spies have to sneak out thru the city. Heb 11:31 Rahab had FAITH and Welcomed the Spies. James 2:25 Rahab is used to show FAITH. MT 1:5-6 Rahab is in the LINE OF DAVID, which of course is the Line of Christ. This movie takes a woman of faith, in the LINE OF CHRIST ... into a forced captive, and 2 godly / honorable spies of Israel into street thugs.JN 11:1-45 Lazarus story. In the movie it shows the romans massacring a group of Israelites and then Jesus arriving at Lazarus's grave, and then going inside and kissing Lazarus's forehead, and Lazarus wakes up. This makes it look like Lazarus died at the massacre. Jesus going in the cave/grave is not seen and anything could have happened. In scripture Jesus receives a message from Lazarus's sisters that he whom Jesus loves is ill. Jesus waits long enough for Lazarus to die, so God can be Glorified. Jesus calls Lazarus out, which shows the power of the Voice of the Christ.JN 13:21-29, Last Supper. In the Movie Jesus points out Judas as the Betrayer, and all the Apostles then knew it was Judas Iscariot. In Scripture Jesus says ""whomever I sop bread with is the betrayer, does it with Judas, and tells him to go and do what needs to be done"". NOT ONE of the apostles even think Judas was the betrayer, Judas was seen as the best of them, they all wondered if the betrayer was themselves.JN 13:3-22 Road to Damascus. In the Movie, Saul of Tarsus is riding, and sees Jesus and charges him on his horse, but the horse rears, and Saul falls to the ground, and Jesus comes up and talks with him. Saul is then taken to a house in Damascus where he is still angry at Jesus. First, Saul had never met Jesus, and they did not have pictures so how did Saul recognize Jesus in the distance? Second, seeing Jesus alive even if Saul could have recognize him would have confused him, not make him angry but confused. In Scripture Saul is blinded by a Light, and hears a voice (NEVER sees Jesus), and Saul knows the light which has blinded him, and the voice is not from a helicopter above him ... say ""Who are you LORD?"". Saul knows these are not special effects, but GOD speaking to him.The show starts with a statement of trying to keep with the Spirit of the Book. It is easily seen they do NOT understand the ""Spirit"" is the HOLY SPIRIT, and JESUS, they do not FEAR GOD! I Pet 2:17, true believers FEAR GOD, REV 14:6-7 the First Angel of tribulation years will claim ""FEAR GOD!""You got to be kidding. There are so many blasphemies in this series; why recommend it? If one changes scripture they change Gods WORD!!! That is blasphemy! Now do right with GOD and tell the truth and warn people to stay away from this show! Go ahead and read the Bible that covers each story and see how they degrade Gods Word! Sadly, most people only know God's word via watching movies about the Bible. They do not read it. This is why so many people have problems with the Bible is because of scriptural error movies like this.The Bible is Called the WORD of GOD. Not ""Words"" of God. It is all one word of God. Just like we teach children how to understand long words (The longest word ever is just shy of 190,000 letters, and the longest English word is 45 letters ... google it). We teach the child by breaking the word down into sections. God slowly gave us His word in small sections to help us understand it. Rev 22:18-19 Jesus ends with saying if we change what is said in the Bible, we will be punished. Jesus can only make this statement in the end of the Word. John Chapter One tells us Jesus is the WORD of God. So when we change what scripture says, we are changing how Jesus wants people to hear HIS WORD.I have no problem with adding stuff that is not covered, but changing what is covered in the Word is clearly not acceptable to CHRIST. The only good this movie series I can recommend to get it, is to have your group read the scripture each story covers, then watch it, and it would be good training to see errors, and show they know the scripture. It would build some confidence. Think about the Treasury Dept Agents, they study real money, to be able to identify counterfeit money. Believers need to study scripture, so when false teachings like this series comes up, they will be able to tell it is wrong, and against scripture. Anyone who recommends this movie series, really does not know, or LOVES the Word of God.",1,filled with scriptural errors,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,6657,"['have', 'read', 'few', 'are', 'having',

As a Christian who follows the Bible and the teachings of God rather than some preacher that only wants money for his building, I think this was done very well. Showing the Angels as representing ALL races and not just aryan men with good builds and adonis like features shows that the makers actually took into account that the heavenly host wouldn't be so one race minded. I like the depictions of the characters, the sets, the fact that the men looked like biblical males as did the women. They didn't have Julia Roberts or some other very American looking actress playing the women. They also didn't look like they just had a make over by max factor. They looked like they'd been in the desert for a while. I feel the story went along with what I've read. It was a good depiction over all.There was only one beef that I have. I would have liked them to take a little bit longer. Actually showing each individual story. Not just touching on it. It felt rushed.I do think it showed guts to actually depict the Bible as it was and not make it some pretty Hollywood production that halfway showed it as a fairy tale. It shows that believing in God and having faith is hard. It doesn't have the song dance numbers or the pretty glamour of other bible stories.I don't know if there's gonna be another season if this was it.

Also,the stories of important Biblical characters such as Isaac,Jacob and Joseph were not told at all.Added to that,there were many creative license taken by the writers in almost all stories that did not fit well.Although the producers reminded the viewers that they have revised many stories but keep up with the so- called &#34;Spirit of the Bible&#34;,I felt that there were many stories that were somewhat out of place and lacking credibility.An example of this is the portrayal of Samson.As for story of Jesus,too bad that many events from his life were somewhat cherry-picked and lacked cohesion with the exception of the Passion and Death of Jesus.Also,most of Jesus' dialogues particularly when teaching the crowd aren't really what was stated from the scriptures. Some Christians may find this not good as well.

1613530,A2L3Y17SPNJ918,B00AMR5FGA,"DLAllen ""Len""","[3, 4]","Four things in the depicted episodes in The Bible: The Epic Miniseries left me wondering:(1) It's interesting to note that the Baptism of Jesus was an immersion baptism and it even featured an underwater shot rising out of the water in to the sunlight. HOWEVER, the subsequent baptisms portrayed such as Saul/Paul and Cornelius were NOT in the same fashion, just poring water on the head. If the sinless Jesus was baptized to ""show us the way"", how much more do we (sinners) need it! Why would our way be different than His way if He is the Way?(2) In the Samson episode, he is depicted as a descendant from Black African. I know modern tradition claims some members of Black African Tribes as descendants from the Old Testament Tribe of Dan (one of Jacob/Israel's sons). Depicting Samson as a modern Danite was an understandable but anachronistic choice as the Israelites were forbidden to intermarry with the Cainites and other nations of people.(3) Have you ever wondered how Moses at age 40 exiles himself into the desert, lives in the desert 40 years before returning to Egypt, THEN--- at Sinai (at the age of 100 or so,) has an encounter with his father-in-law Jethro who gives him counsel on dividing the Israelites into companies of 10, 100, 1000 etc to ease of the pressure of judgment and leadership from Moses? How old was Jethro?! This episode wasn't actually featured, but middle-aged Moses sure was young and vital at 80+ years! Maybe since the Hebrews clothes didn't wear out while they were in the desert, Moses didn't either...The visual effects of the Burning Bush, the Red Sea, and the Fiery Furnace were absolutely the best I have ever seen!(4) The way the separation of Hagar and Ishmael from Abraham's camp was presented seemed cruel and harsh as though Ishmael and his descendants somehow deserve ill treatment. Let's not forget that an Angel appeared to Hagar to lead her and the child from the wilderness AND provided a miraculous fountain of water to save the child. Also the Bible tells us that the Lord blessed Ishmael with twelve sons that became the Princes of the Desert. Ishmael and Isaac even reconciled when they came together at their father's death.I missed Joseph in Egypt which also has tie-ins to Mary's husband Joseph in Egypt when Jesus is a young child.Where's Ruth and the connection from Rehab, the hostess in the wall of Jericho, whose son was Boaz, who, with Ruth (herself a convert) were  great-grandparents of King David and hence, Jesus Christ through Joseph AND Mary's lineage? We could have also seen Esther, Deborah the Prophetess and others to bring in the faithfulness and leadership of women in the Story of God.The Bible miniseries did leave out many episodes that could have made the series a little more inclusive, but what they did portray was done exceptional well. The storytelling aspect of the dialogue was beautiful as well and, thankfully, was not restricted to stilted canonic utterances. With parent-guided viewing, this is a wonderful visual depiction of those great and colorful Bible Stories for Children editions of the past.",3,Beautifully produced. Slightly exclusionary.

The cameras capture throat slitting, beheadings, stonings, beatings, and the same kind of sword slashing, stabbing and hacking (with splattering blood) that we got from a movie like 300.That's the first thing that strikes you about this series. The second is that the production values, the casting, the writing--even the segues that help span huge chunks of the book that had to be omitted--are all quite good. The CGI effects are terrific in this big-screen quality production. In fact, the only thing that reminds you it's television are annoying ""Previously on"" and ""Next on"" montages that bookend each episode and run excessively long. But at least you can skip over those.Abraham's story is included, as is the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt, Joshua and the fall of Jericho, Samson and Delilah, King Saul, David and Goliath and David's reign, the Babylonian captivity with Daniel in the Lion's Den and the three men in the fiery furnace, and the more familiar territory of the New Testament: the story of Jesus' birth, miracle-working, disciple-gathering, teachings, and eventual betrayal and crucifixion. Filmmakers Roma Downey and Mark Burnett are to be commended for continuing the story beyond that, with Jesus' disciples trying to spread the gospel and Saul becoming Paul, the great converter of gentiles. It's a much more satisfying ending than if everything stopped at the cross.There are some interesting choices made throughout. Rastafarians always said that Samson wore dreads, and he does so here. Herod is a corpulent gourmand, while Jesus (played by Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado) is the long-haired beatific messiah that everyone envisions--but he's as believable a Jesus as I've seen in a film or television production. But I wasn't impressed by the addition of physical soldiers dressed in armor and cloaks who were shown every time God was speaking, or who brought God's message. It was the only hokey element in an otherwise solidly conceived production.Younger children and people disturbed by graphic violence won't be able to watch, but the rest of the family will find The Bible an interesting combination of the expected and unexpected.James PlathFamily Home Theater",4,"A surprising amount of violence, but great production values",1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2341,"['were', 'motion', 'picture', 'Bible', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'rated', 'least', 'PG-13', 'incredible', 'amount', 'graphic', 'violence', 'cameras', 'capture', 'throat', 'slitting', 'beheadings', 'stonings', 'beatings', 'same', 'kind', 'sword', 'slashing', 'stabbing', 'hacking', 'splattering', 'blood', 'got', 'movie', '300.That', 'first', 'thing', 'series', 'second', 'production', 'values', 'casting', 'writing', 'even', 'segues', 'help', 'span', 'huge', 'chunks', 'book', 'had', 'be', 'omitted', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'terrific', 'big-screen', 'quality', 'production', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'television', 'are', 'annoying', 'Previously', 'Next', 'montages', 'bookend', 'episode', 'run', 'excessively', 'long', 'least', 'can', 'skip', 'those.Abraham', 'story', 'included', 'story', 'Moses', 'Exodus', 'Egypt', 'Joshua', 'fall', 'Jericho', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'King', 'Saul', 'David', 'Goliath', 'David', 'reign', 'Babylonian', 'captivity', 'Daniel', 'Lion', 'Den', 'three', 'men', 'fiery', 'furnace', 'more', 'familiar', 'territory', 'New', 'Testament', 'story', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'miracle-working', 'disciple-gathering', 'teachings', 'eventual', 'betrayal', 'crucifixion', 'Filmmakers', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'continuing', 'story', 'Jesus', 'disciples', 'trying', 'spread', 'gospel', 'Saul', 'becoming', 'Paul', 'great', 'converter', 'gentiles', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'everything', 'stopped', 'cross.There', 'are', 'interesting', 'choices', 'made', 'Rastafarians', 'always', 'said', 'Samson', 'wore', 'dreads', 'so', 'here', 'Herod', 'corpulent', 'gourmand', 'Jesus', 'played', 'Portuguese', 'actor', 'Diogo', 'Morgado', 'long-haired', 'beatific', 'messiah', 'everyone', 'envisions', 'believable', 'Jesus', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'television', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'addition', 'physical', 'soldiers', 'dressed', 'armor', 'cloaks', 'who', 'were', 'shown', 'time', 'God', 'was', 'speaking', 'who', 'brought', 'God', 'message', 'was', 'only', 'hokey', 'element', 'otherwise', 'solidly', 'conceived', 'production.Younger', 'children', 'people', 'disturbed', 'graphic', 'violence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'rest', 'family', 'will', 'find', 'Bible', 'interesting', 'combination', 'expected', 'unexpected.James', 'PlathFamily', 'Home', 'Theater']",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

It is wayyyyy off, and presents pretty bad theology. I know it is hard to condense the entire Bible into 13 episodes, but still, that is no excuse to misrepresent the Bible. As a Masters of Theology student, I was disappointed. For example, in the story of Lot, the two angels go around Sodom and kill many with their swords. Although it is an interesting take, that is not what the Bible presents (and the writers state that they attempted to remain true to the stories). Also, Jesus in the series says that he came to change the world. Indeed he did. However, that really is not what he came to do; he came to save the world. It may sound like I am nitpicking, but that is not what the Bible says.

We pre ordered this series and could not wait to get this series. With a busy life, we also wanted the option to watch The Bible when we wanted to.What a treat we were in for! This series is full of excitement just like the word! Our children love this series and even know which stories are which! This drew their attention and kept them wanting more!The word is the best anytime any day! You will enjoy this series. You will learn so much. This series is quality, truth, anointed and so much more.I always did love Touched by an Angel and Highway to Heaven. We own all of the Highway to Heaven that have been released and only need one more season of Touched by an Angel to complete that series. The Bible will make a great addition to your library!Thank you to the producers and to the history channel for having the courage to air this much needed story! All we have is Abba, and we need series like this to humble ourselves and to turn back to our Abba.We don't have cable because of all the trash on T.V. now days, so this is a breath of fresh air!We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and inspiration! Great for family time! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set individually as it was more affordable to purchase that way. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price on pre paid order.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo, Animal plant etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show and Touched by an Angel since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!If you are looking for more shows and T.V. like this, try Sky Angel Fave T.V. you will find so many great shows similar to High Way To Heaven and Touched By An Angel.Happy viewing!  We need real T.V. to come back.. We will not pay for paid for T.V. with all of the trash that is on it.We educate and entertain ourselves on everything except the word.. We need to educate our selves on the Lord and stand on the word.Again, thank you for making this series!

There are some additions, conflations (e.g. compressing Eli's sons into Samuel's character), and inexplicable subtractions, especially in well-known stories. The special effects are decent.It may be interesting to watch some of their interpretation of the characters' motivations and so on. And some of the filled-in bits are also interesting, such as Paul's recruitment of Luke. But it's the omissions (even in pieces they did include) that really hurt. Many important pieces of dialogue and events are expected but oddly missing. Thomas loses his iconic line, ""My Lord and my God!"" Stephen is stoned without any hint of his sweeping prophetic message and petition for God to forgive his killers. We do not see Paul before Felix; we just see him arrested. No tongues of fire are seen on Pentecost (although the dramatization - people actually speaking in different languages - was OK).I understand there's a lot to pick and choose from to fit the important bits in. But surely many of these iconic lines could have been included.Some other choices are a bit odd.Of course, everyone was surprised that Samson was black, but I suppose it's possible, since anyone could choose to become Jewish.There are some fight scenes added, including a swordfighting Asian angel in Sodom. Heh. And, as mentioned, some other imagined scenes. But many things are glossed over, such as Lot offering his daughters to be abused. Not to say that things are whitewashed; the failures and sinfulness of many Biblical characters is portrayed, although the many failures of Israel as a nation - frankly recorded in the Bible - are not highlighted here. (For example, their grumbling and wanderings in the desert.)Appearances of the post-resurrection Jesus are somewhat subdued - not much in the way of pyrotechnics. This is accurate for many appearances, but I expected a bit more with John at Patmos. However, the sight of the nail prints in his hands is always moving, and the actor portraying him is compelling.There are other little, annoying inaccuracies. But on the whole, it's a good overview of the Bible, connecting the major parts together. I guess it's expected that anyone who has their curiousity aroused would read the actual Bible to get the missing material.For anyone who is interested yet a bit put off by the less glamorous parts, I recommendThe Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism,The Case for Christ:  A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus, andWhat's So Great about Christianity. D'Souza's book is a little too accepting of evolutionism, but that's rather a big topic, and the other stuff is thought-provoking. Keller's is an excellent examination of the usual criticisms of Christianity. Strobel's books are very readable and rely on interviews with top scholars.",3,"Somewhere in between, but still worth a watch",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2868,"['not', 'well-directed', 'acted', 'scripted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'additions', 'conflations', 'e.g', 'compressing', 'Eli', 'sons', 'Samuel', 'character', 'inexplicable', 'subtractions', 'especially', 'well-known', 'stories', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'decent.It', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'interpretation', 'characters', 'motivations', 'so', 'filled-in', 'bits', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'such', 'Paul', 'recruitment', 'Luke', 'omissions', 'even', 'pieces', 'did', 'include', 'really', 'hurt', 'Many', 'important', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'events', 'are', 'expected', 'oddly', 'missing', 'Thomas', 'iconic', 'line', 'Lord', 'God', 'Stephen', 'stoned', 'hint', 'sweeping', 'prophetic', 'message', 'petition', 'God', 'forgive', 'killers', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Paul', 'Felix', 'just', 'see', 'arrested', 'tongues', 'fire', 'are', 'seen', 'Pentecost', 'dramatization', 'people', 'actually', 'speaking', 'different', 'languages', 'was', 'OK', '.I', 'understand', 'lot', 'pick', 'choose', 'fit', 'important', 'bits', 'surely', 'many', 'iconic', 'lines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included.Some', 'other', 'choices', 'are', 'bit', 'odd.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'was', 'surprised', 'Samson', 'was', 'black', 'suppose', 'possible', 'anyone', 'could', 'choose', 'become', 'Jewish.There', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'added', 'including', 'swordfighting', 'Asian', 'angel', 'Sodom', 'Heh', 'mentioned', 'other', 'imagined', 'scenes', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'glossed', 'such', 'Lot', 'offering', 'daughters', 'be', 'abused', 'Not', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'whitewashed', 'failures', 'sinfulness', 'many', 'Biblical', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'many', 'failures', 'Israel', 'nation', 'frankly', 'recorded', 'Bible', 'are', 'not', 'highlighted', 'here', 'example', 'grumbling', 'wanderings', 'desert', 'Appearances', 'post-resurrection', 'Jesus', 'are', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'pyrotechnics', 'accurate', 'many', 'appearances', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'John', 'Patmos', 'However', 'sight', 'nail', 'prints', 'hands', 'always', 'moving', 'actor', 'portraying', 'compelling.There', 'are', 'other', 'little', 'annoying', 'inaccuracies', 'whole', 'good', 'overview', 'Bible', 'connecting', 'major', 'parts', 'together', 'guess', 'expected', 'anyone', 'who', 'curiousity', 'aroused', 'would', 'read', 'actual', 'Bible', 'get', 'missing', 'material.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'yet', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'less', 'glamorous', 'parts', 'recommendThe', 'Reason', 'God', 'Belief', 'Age', 'Skepticism', 'Case', 'Christ', 'Journalist', 'Personal', 'Investigation', 'Evidence', 'Jesus', 'andWhat', 'So', 'Great', 'Christianity', ""D'Souza"", 'book', 'little', 'too', 'accepting', 'evolutionism', 'rather', 'big', 'topic', 'other', 'stuff', 'thought-provoking', 'Keller', 'excellent', 'examination', 'usual', 'criticisms', 'Christianity', 'Strobel', 'books', 'are', 'very', 'readable', 'rely', 'interviews', 'top', 'scholars']",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

1613577,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B00AMR5FGA,HAMLET,"[34, 83]","Note: I saw the first episode laat week via XFinity On Demand and about 10 minutes of the 2nd episode last night.CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR EPISODES I AND II.I was interested in this series when I learned that Roma Downey (star of television's Touched By An Angel) & Mark Burnett (producer of Survivor, The Voice and several other television shows) were producing this. I read in an interview with them that they used many translations because they wanted to appeal to the younger generation. That should have raised a red flag for me. I was stupid, however, and chose to see what they did with it. Now I wish I hadn't. There are simply way too many inconsistencies with the Holy Scriptures. For example, Lot and his wife are taken captive whilst they are on their journey to Sodom. Scripture clearly saith that Lot was already IN Sodom when the kings attacked Sodom and took him captive (The First Book Of Moses Called Genesis 14:12; ""They took Lot also Abram's brother's son and his substance [for he dwelt at Sodom] and departed."") Lot was alao depicted as very ungrateful when Abram pleaded with him to turn back from going unto Sodom. That simply did not occur anywhere in the Scriptures. Also, it was ABRAM and not Lot, who said, ""Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me, neither between my herdsmen and thine herdsmen, for we be brethren Is not the whole land before thee? Depart, I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right: or if thou go to the right hand, then I will take the left.""-The First Book Of Moses Called Genesis 13:8-9. Abram was also a man of faith, and he did not doubt when God saith unto him that He would make of him a great nation. Scripture saith, ""And Abram believed, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness."" He did not waver in his faith, and never questioned Almighty God, whining, ""Have I not shown Thee enough faith?"" Personally, I also think that Isaac did not protest unto Abraham when he was going to be sacrificed unto God, for Isaac was but a figure of the True Sacrifice, which is Jesus Christ, and His death at Calvary accomplished redemption for all the world. God did not need to tell Abraham to have faith, because he HAD faith. Also, the man in drag at Sodom-the clothes he was wearing looked way too modern. And where in Holy Writ doth it say that either the Angels whom God had sent to destroy Sodom or the spies which Joshua sent into Jericho engaged in a swordfight or other physical confrontation of such a nature? It doth not say that anywhere. And in the bit of the second episode which I viewed last night, it clearly depicted David cutting off a corner of Saul's robe when he was covering his feet, whereas Scripture saith that Saul was ASLEEP when he did that. These inconsistencies are but a few examples of many that time and space proscribe me from relating.AVOID this miniseries, and view The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston or the silent version made in 1923, also directed by Cecil B. DeMille. I also recommend THE BIBLE...IN THE BEGINNING starring George C. Scott, Ava Gardner, Peter O'Toole and John Huston (who also directed) both the silent and sound versions of BEN-HUR (made in 1925 & 1959), The Prince Of Egypt and THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. All of these versions are closer to the Bible than this atrocious miniseries, the horrible computer-animated film The Ten Commandments and the 2006 miniseries The Ten Commandments.EDIT-3/13/13I have no interest in viewing the rest of this miniseries, as the scriptwriter(s) completely missed the mark with this project.EDIT-3/16/13Of course, no film version of a Biblical story is a substitute for reading The Holy Scriptures. I recommend the Geneva Bible, available now from Tolle Lege Press and or the King James Version.

But it went so quick, we hardly count build or form any emotional connect.  I feel the 1966 movie &#34;The Bible,&#34; directed by John Huston, was better in this manner, as it accounted the first 22 chapters of Gensis.  The Huston movie wasn't as generally accurate, but did do a good job in giving us a visual story to the written words of God.

The casting and acting is very inferior; as an example Moses has a permanent leer and seems almost to be on drugs! Bleeding chunks are inevitable with such a project but the script writing and dialogue is appalling, the sort of thing one would expect in a C grade movie. On the positive side the locations and special effects are excellent and the costumes, picture and sound very good so it is even more of a pity the script and acting is so bad. Another irritant is that each 47 minute episode starts with a recap and ends with a preview of the next episode. Unfortunately one cannot skip these as they are not linked to the chapter points and one loses part of the episode itself. Poor planning and another example of sloppy quality control. I am sure it is politically correct to cast a number of African Americans but I wonder how historically accurate that might be. Accents are all over the place representing a diverse cast but some are a bit hard to take!I am sure many Christians will want to see this, good or bad, but my advice would be rent at best or catch it on the box as I really doubt it will get many repeat viewings.

One of my biggest concerns, though, about the movie was how Sodom & Gomorrah was dealt with. I saw this episode on TV, not on the Blu-Ray that I later purchased, so I don't know if this detail was filled in or not, but my beef was that the wickedness in the city where the two angels had to show up and escort Lot's family out was not properly explained. In the episode, the city folk showed up with swords and just started bashing. That's NOT what the Bible says. The Bible says that they were very, very much intent on having homosexual sex with the handsome angels. In fact, the men in the city, young and old and from every corner of the city, surrounded his home trying to get these two handsome looking angels to come out because they wanted to boink them. It is true they got violent about it but the real intent was rape, not the sword. Lot even offered them his daughters, but no, they wanted to boink the angels whom they thought were men.

1613632,A1W98Q4MZK80VA,B00AMR5FGA,Joseph P. Tevington,"[2, 2]","Thus far, I have only watched one episode of this exciting miniseries.  Yet, it strikes me that this series would NOT be well suited to someone who does not already have a good command of Scripture.  For example, Genesis' themes of Creation/the Fall and the Promise of Redemption receive minimal attention.  Also, an incredible amount of material is not even glossed over.  After the first hour, the ""coming attractions"" indicate that this miniseries will be ""fast forwarding"" all the way to Moses!It is certainly true that all films based on the Bible have shortcomings and seem to use a good deal of poetic license.  Still, I would like to suggest an alternative viewing list....The Bible: In the Beginning: Wikepedia tells us that this 1966 film ""was originally conceived as the first in a series of films retelling the entire Old Testament, but these sequels were never made.""  As per a USCCB review, it is a ""reverent but entertaining spectacular,"" covering ""Creation, Adam & Eve, Cain & Abel, Noah, the Tower of Babel and Abraham"" from the Book of Genesis (cf, my Amazon review.).AbrahamJacobJosephMoses: While NOT free of poetic license, this seems comparatively faithful. Ben Kingsley is excellent: ""For sheer human realism, Kingsley's is probably the best interpretation of Moses any film has offered to date"" (www(dot)patheos(dot)com/blogs/filmchat/1996/12/review-moses-dir-roger-young-1995(dot)html; cf, my Amazon review.).Samson and Delilah: Yet again, there is plenty of poetic license and this film should NOT replace Chapters 13 to 16 of Judges. Be that said, it recounts basic aspects of Samsom's being beguiled and betrayed by Delilah - but never forgotten by God (cf, my Amazon review.).The Story Of Ruth: Background material in the New American Bible explains that ""Ruth's piety (Ruth 2:11), her spirit of self-sacrifice, and her moral integrity were favored by God with the gift of faith and an illustrious marriage whereby she became the ancestress of David and of Christ. In this, the universality of the messianic salvation is foreshadowed"" (old(dot)usccb(dot)org/nab/bible/ruth/intro.htm).  It does seem to capture the basic outline of the Book of Ruth (cf, my Amazon review.).David: ""Here is one of the greatest sagas in all human history--the story of Israel's greatest king. He became a nationally known hero while still a teenager in his battle with the giant Goliath. Thereupon his life was caught up in the whirlwind of his people's life and destiny. Never far from danger, political intrigue, the jealousy of opponents, and the problems caused by his own surging passions, David, nevertheless, emerged as a 'man after God's own heart'"" (www(dot)catholicvideo(dot)com/detail(dot)taf?_function=detail&a;_product_id=31783; cf, my Amazon review.).Solomon: Though this film does well when it follows the Bible, BE WARNED that it is HIGHLY excessive with poetic license. The Bible does NOT say that Solomon and the Queen of Sheba were lovers with a son! (cf, my Amazon review.)Jeremiah: This covers Jeremiah's 7th century BC birth, his call to prophecy, his opposition to idolatry, and his prophesying against policy toward Babylon. As God's warnings went unheeded, the prophesies came to pass (cf, my Amazon review.).Esther: This film struck me as superior to the better known ""One Night with the King,"" which also tells of how Esther was chosen queen and used her position to rescue her people. This film seems to avoid misleading poetic license excesses (cf, my Amazon review.).The Old Testament (1963): Since the focus of this film is Maccabees, the name ""Old Testament"" is confusing. ""The two Books of Maccabees contain independent accounts of events (in part identical) that accompanied the attempted suppression of Judaism in Palestine in the second century B.C.....The rededication of the Jerusalem Temple described in 4:36-59 (see 2 Mc 10:1-8) is the origin of the Jewish feast of Hanukkah"" (New American Bible; cf, my Amazon review.).The Gospel According to St. Matthew: As per the USCCB, this is a ""Straight-forward Italian dramatization of the evangelist's account of the life of Jesus and His message of salvation. It succeeds exceptionally well in placing the viewer within the Gospel events, avoiding the artificiality of most biblical movie epics. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini is completely faithful to the text while employing the visual imagination necessary for his realistic interpretation"" (old(dot)usccb(dot)org/movies/g/gospelaccordingtostmatthewthe1966(dot)shtml; cf, my Amazon review.).Peter & Paul: This film struck me as superior to that better known film about the early Church, ""A.D.""  Yet it is so HIGHLY INADEQUATE in its treatment of Peter, that it would be better packaged as ""peter and !!!PAUL!!!."" Saint Peter, to whom Christ gave the keys of the Kingdom, is treated as as afterthought!  (cf, my Amazon review.).The Apocalypse: This film presents the Book of Revelation, and I highly recommend reading Scott Hahn's The Lamb's Supper in conjunction (cf, my Amazon reviews.).",3,An

Spanning the breadth of the most important book ever put together, this sophisticated production accounts for most of the stories we all know (Sampson and Delilah, David and Goliath, and of course the story of Jesus of Nazareth). It does so in an unfanciful, gritty way (the angels are portrayed as typical humans with red robes; miracles are shown realistically; and the gruesome violence of the age comes through vividly). The CGI is fantastic and the storytelling is top-notch (granted they had some great material to work with).There are only a few gaffs in the entire series, most notably is the bizarre way they had Jesus saying that the temple would be destroyed. In the show, he randomly walks up to a little girl and playfully pokes her in her stomach saying, ""Not one of these stones will remain standing."" Some of the Passion is awkward too, but that's nothing a viewing ofThe Passion Of The Christcan't fix.Diogo Morgado overacts as Jesus often and I would have avoided the conflict of interest and cast someone else as Our Lady but the disciples were all brilliantly acted as were the major Old Testament characters.If you're fairly knowledgeable about the book and love history and a good plot, this is a must-see that you will love.",5,Epic,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1599,"['Two', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'when', 'dare', 'produce', 'television', 'version', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'told', '1', 'could', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'make', 'piece', 'trash', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations', '2', 'could', 'crush', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'did', 'latter', 'Bible', 'stunning', 'constantly', 'engaging', 'most', 'part', 'well-acted', 'Spanning', 'breadth', 'most', 'important', 'book', 'ever', 'put', 'together', 'sophisticated', 'production', 'accounts', 'most', 'stories', 'know', 'Sampson', 'Delilah', 'David', 'Goliath', 'course', 'story', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'so', 'unfanciful', 'gritty', 'way', 'angels', 'are', 'portrayed', 'typical', 'humans', 'red', 'robes', 'miracles', 'are', 'shown', 'realistically', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'age', 'vividly', 'CGI', 'fantastic', 'storytelling', 'top-notch', 'granted', 'had', 'great', 'material', 'work', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'gaffs', 'entire', 'series', 'most', 'notably', 'bizarre', 'way', 'had', 'Jesus', 'saying', 'temple', 'would', 'be', 'destroyed', 'show', 'randomly', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'playfully', 'stomach', 'saying', 'Not', 'one', 'stones', 'will', 'remain', 'standing', 'Passion', 'awkward', 'too', 'nothing', 'viewing', 'ofThe', 'Passion', 'Christca', ""n't"", 'fix.Diogo', 'Morgado', 'overacts', 'Jesus', 'often', 'would', 'have', 'avoided', 'conflict', 'interest', 'cast', 'someone', 'else', 'Lady', 'disciples', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'were', 'major', 'Old', 'Testament', 'characters.If', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'knowledgeable', 'book', 'love', 'history', 'good', 'plot', 'must-see', 'will', 'love']",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

1613656,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B00AMR5FGA,Kendal B. Hunter,"[0, 0]","In a series like this, there are some points of delicacy, four flashpoints. These production problems are common to all Bible epics--Quo Vadis,Ben-Hur / The Ten Commandments [Blu-ray],The Greatest Story Ever Told, or this one.The first flashpoint is Selective Streamlining. The Bible is a large book. The Catholic version has 73 books total: 39 in the Old Testament, 27 the New Testament, plus 7 in the Apocrypha. And there are more disputed texts--151 Psalm, and 3 and 4 Maccabees.How do we manage this bulk? Simple: we employ Selective Streamlining. This means we eliminate sections, stories, people and events. Hence, our favorite Bible story may be eliminated to make room for the overall flow. Think of the trade-off between strong episodes versus strong story arcs and you see the balancing act.This was handled well, with the main miniseries arc being the establishment of Israel, from Abraham to Jesus. And each episode is a strong standalone.The series began with the Flood, and showed Eden in flashback. All the minor prophets and Joseph of Egypt were eliminated, and also the Tower of Babel, and the adult Solomon.This, of course, is not sacrilegious, but a creative necessity.Tied to this is the level of graphicness--how bloody do you make it? Following Mel Gibson (The Passion Of The Christ Definitive Edition) and the recent revival of Sword and Sandal flicks (Gladiator), they have erred on the side of more. This is also a touchy area, since blood can be a turn-off to some people. And it can be a turn-on in the wrong way.Even so, I consider these words helpful:""Should the little children of the kindergarten be taught the events leading up to and culminating in the death of our Savior? It is a principle widely accepted that it is not desirable to teach these little ones those things that are horrifying to childish natures.  ... But death is not an unmixed horror. With it are associated some of the profoundest and most important truths of human life. Children should be taught early in life that death is really a necessity as well as a blessing, and that we would not and could not be satisfied and supremely happy without it. Upon the crucifixion and the resurrection of  Jesus, one of the grandest principles of the gospel depends. If children were taught this early in life, death would not have the horrifying influence that it does have over many childish minds.""Amen!Literary License is the second flashpoint. Simply put, this is where we tweak, tease, or trump historical facts. The segment on King David has him dancing both before the Lord and with Bathsheba, and then later sitting with Solomon on his lap, playing with the model of the temple. It did not happen this way (as the record stands), but it gets the main message across quickly and succinctly.This is a personal bugaboo of mine, and a main reason why I do not like historical fiction, or docudramas. (History is sacrificed to art, which means tit is not history.) But, for their part, Burnett/Downy handles this well, even for a critic like myself.The third flashpoint is Archeological Assessment. This covers all things of historical fact. Did they really dress that way? Did the building look that way, or did they changes things to fit the needs of the sound stage, the producer's and the director's taste, and the budget?Some historical questions are settled as best we can settle these things. Others are open. Some are disputed. Some things are just not known.Burnett/Downy have been following the trend away from DeMillian lushness and pageantry to more historically and archeologically sound presentation. Colors are subdued, sets have a George Lucas dirtyness and lived-in feeling, and leads do not necessarily have to be blue-eyed Norsemen. Again, this series does well in this area.Fourth, and the most explosive, are the Doctrinal Disputes. How Jewish, Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Evangelical do you make the series? You must include the ""upon this rock"" quote which is important to Catholics, you have ""born again"" dialogue  for Protestant thought, theosis for the Eastern Orthodox faithful, and the ""other sheep"" quote  and Joseph of Egypt for Mormons (the last two not being included).An essential quote, well-placed, here and there affirms faith.On the other hand, how do you depict baptism? This film solves this no-win situation by showing several types: immersion, effusion (pouring), partial immersion, but no aspersion (sprinkling).This question will never be settled this side of the Second Coming. But the workable, short-term solution for this is a sophisticated understanding that such things are disputed, and that other people believe other things. It should also motivate us to form our own opinions by going back to the source text.And that is the point of these films. Like the old Filmation cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, the moral of the episode is to go back to the original source text--read your Bible!",5,"""In essentials let there be unity; in non-essentials,

1613690,A1LF4NXBKM5W01,B00AMR5FGA,marsdaman,"[6, 21]","On the 1st 2 Episodes: This is coming from one who was reading the bible along side watching it. I felt that the first episode was better than passable as far as accuracy was concerned(certain things could have happened in a lot of different ways); while, the second seemed to become a biblical shell. Samson had no father. Both missed major parts that seemed to be unmissable in the telling of the bible: the story of Joseph, the sun standing still about Joshua, Jacob and Essau, details about Moses' and God's people in the wilderness(his and the people's faults), the Samuel and Eli relationship, and the Absalom problem. I also felt that Saul's story was moderately off and that David seemed too arrogant and prideful to be a man of God(at times, the prophet had to remind him where his place was and challenged the prophet when he gave him news that his child would not live after his great sin). Another thing is that they never showed where David was Godly sorry for what he had done! Almost as if God saw him as special even in the midst of his sin; that thought is utterly ridiculous. They should have done the screenplay off a really accurate bible story book(s) and then went from there, filling in the lose ends(other parts that they wanted to add)with the bible. Good bible story books are really inspired by the bible. The one that I read as a child was really accurate. I really felt that the creators may or may not have meant well, but--either way--it was too massive an undertaking to do without having tools at your disposal. They could have also did one or couple of major undertakings at a time(The creation through Abraham, Abraham's direct descendants, Moses to Samuel's childhood, older Samuel through young Solomon, adult Solomon through Elisha, etc.) and let a couple stand alone for awhile AND/OR Let some Christian churches and wealthy people invest in an idea, that was more accurate than most of the work out there and this would allow them to be as accurate as possible plus allowing there to be no delay with the accuracy. Instead of having no delay that was not well put together(as was the case). Also, can we ever make a biblical movie where the characters are historically accurate[with biblical movies, they make all the characters' lineage off--namely most are white people. Some could not be like traditional Jews in appearance--if they so chose--bc Jews had servants(which makes Samson somewhat believable), but most people in these movies should be traditional Jews in appearance. Note: To Prove Just How Problematic This Was and is For Practicing Christians, I'll just say that false images are created through treatment, media, video, and art! Many Muslims--whether they admit it or not--say that I'm not going to serve a white, blond, clear-eyed Jesus. M. Ali was raised a Christian, but used this as an excuse when he broke away from the faith and he--with his popularity and charisma--led many sharecroppers and Civil rights sufferers--who were only a generation or two from slavery--away from the faith. Malcolm X was known to refer to whites in evil terms before doing a 180 later in life(he lead some away from the faith and greatly influenced Ali). To me, it is not a legitimate argument, bc the BIBLE dispells the false images that racists and devils use to distort people down paths that they were not meant to go down when the truth's been in the bible the whole time; however, people do use this--and what they can see--as an excuse; I don't think that it was an accident that Jews(God's chosen people) seem to be the perfect mixture of all races--having white and black characteristics and it's the truth that is in the BIBLE besides; if it were not for this, many of these people would likely be Christians or sympathizers of it(still easily suasible to repent) and would not have an excuse for some charismatic speaker or popular idealogy to exploit and not be under the aspect of quickly passing time which breeds stronger loyalty in Islam]? Verdict: It has been seriously skimmed(important parts and people left out and it seems that it is becoming more of a biblical shell; therefore, I probably will not watch another of them)! Maybe the history channel(pagan channel--do your research) did edit out certain things or did dictate to the married couple what they would or would not air! Although them dictating to the couple is only a theory, they don't advertise it nearly as much as they do Vikings(no doubt full of paganism--do your research--the title is). Vikings is glaring across the screen announcing it on screen during its programs and the Bible show plus it is advertised on commercials, too!",2,Skim--Very Skim--Bible And Not Very Well Put

Donaghey ""JONASMAC""","[4, 12]","WILL THE REAL MESSIAH PLEASE STAND UP AND BE RECOGNIZED&#8230;Coming into do a nightshift at work the other night I found the previous shift enjoying one of those rare quiet times we experience as nurses in a hospital. They were sitting around watching something on television and when I asked what they were watching they said it was The Bible miniseries; which seems to be very popular of late around the globe. When they said this there was that usual unspoken little vibe I get from some of my colleagues, where there is just the slightest hint of what could perhaps be labelled amusement at the quaintness of my belief in Jesus as Saviour.Knowing a little of this particular production from the writings of authentic and genuine bible scholars I pointed out that this was not really the real story they were watching, informing them that this was yet another Hollywood New Age bible-lite version.If their expression had have been vocalized I imagine there would have been a few groans from this group; that, &#8220;Oh Anthony, can&#8217;t you just lighten up&#8221; kind of expression imprinted upon their faces.Nevertheless, that is all I said on the subject, (unusual for me I must add), and I went into the staff room to prepare for the shift ahead.A little later I did catch about a minute or so of the miniseries as I was passing the TV and in that short amount of time here is what I observed.Jesus is in a boat alone with Simon Peter, there is some pretty impressive, emotive sounding music going on to build up the drama of the scene unfolding before me, and leaning down to be face to face with Peter Jesus points his finger toward the shore line, pointing at the world and he says something along the lines of &#8220;Peter, follow me, and we shall change the whole world.&#8221;The emotive music swells to a rather grand level as I walk away to begin my duties.And that was all I saw&#8230;If I were not a person who read the bible myself I would be rather impressed with such a statement coming from the actor playing Jesus, what with the wind swept waters and billowing sails and emotional soundtrack, I would venture that I might actually come away quite inspired by what I just witnessed.But there are a number of problems with this miniseries, something I was able to pick up in a mere 60 seconds because of having read my bible.&#8226; A: Firstly, and this is nothing new, the Jesus being presented is yet another long haired, hippy Brad Pit lookalike version. The Bible gives very little physical descriptions of our Lord, but the few we do have reveal to us that Jesus was not some handsome looking model type man. In the book of Isaiah we are told: &#8220;Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.&#8221; Isaiah 53:1-2 There is a reason for every single word and sentence and paragraph and chapter found in the Word of God; The Spirit never wastes a single dot or tittle; we do not for instance have our Lord coming into Mary and Martha&#8217;s home and saying something like, &#8220;Ladies, I really love those curtains, they really match your sofa.&#8221; So when The Spirit inspires Isaiah to write down that Jesus has no form nor comeliness and that there is no beauty that we should desire him, it is for us not to be taken in by such glamorous depictions as what Hollywood seems constantly to be throwing our way. It seems important to the Lord that we follow Him for the right reasons; one of those reasons obviously not being that we follow him because he is pleasant to the sensual eye. How many women would have followed him for all the wrong reasons if He did in fact resemble the movie-dom versions? When Mel Gibson&#8217;s The Passion was all the rage, homosexual magazines reported many of their readers attending theatres just to catch a glimpse of the actor playing Jesus with his clothes off; which highlight&#8217;s the very point I am trying to make here; people in the flesh are very prone to following someone merely because they are of a comely appearance and this is not the reason to follow the Messiah of Israel.&#8226; B: Jesus is in the miniseries once again portrayed as having long, lavish locks, giving him a somewhat effeminate appearance, rather than the manly kind of man he so obviously was according to scripture; this is the step-son of a carpenter with big, rough carpenter&#8217;s hands, a man spending much time out in the dry, remorseless wildernesses of Galilee and Judea, this is not someone who has just stepped out of the local Hair Salon with a permanent wave and blow-dry we are speaking about here. Ever been camping? How do you look after only a few days out in the elements? Do you look like you just stepped out of a shampoo advertisement? The other thing I think important here is what Paul has to say about men sporting long hair:  &#8220;Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?&#8221; 1st Corinthians 11:14 Now unless Jesus decided to sport long locks as a mark of shame in the same manner He went to the cross, which is also seen as a mark of shame in the bible, then these depictions of the long haired hippy Jesus are completely wrong and we should be wary of them as they once again depict a rather physically gorgeous looking Christ, one that will be listened to and followed for all the wrong reasons; a point of fact that Isaiah is trying to point out to us in chapter 53 of his book.&#8226; C: When Jesus tells Simon Peter in this miniseries that He is here to find followers in order to change the world nothing could be further from the truth when it actually comes to the truth found in the Word of God. If Jesus came to change the world why didn&#8217;t the world change? Why is it as blood thirty and sin riddled today as it was back then? Why all the wars, including all the so called holy wars? Why all the years of Roman Catholicism oppressing and torturing and murdering all who oppose Mother Church for over a thousand years? Why all the burnings and decapitations carried out by Protestantism for hundreds of years? Why all the slaughter carried out by nearly every country throughout Europe on the Jews century after century? If Jesus came to change the world why has the world gone from bad to worse to almost downright unbearable for the majority of its inhabitants? What changed? The truth is Jesus did not come to change this world as was strongly suggested by this miniseries; we are told in scripture that the world will pass away, that there will one day be a new heavens and a new earth. What is the point of having a new earth if Jesus came to change the earth we now live in? We see what Jesus really came to do if we look at the Gospel of John:  &#8220;Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.&#8221; John 18:37 Jesus came to bear witness unto the truth, which means he came to reveal all the lies that send people to hell for the lies they are, those lies spun from times of old by the father of them; all the lies about good works outweighing bad works being a safe path to eternal life in paradise, (which incidentally is foundational to ALL religions outside of authentic bible based Christianity, including the many pseudo-Christian religions so popular in our world today). Jesus came to set the captives free from these lies that will lead countless billions into hell. This was a legal language our Lord was using with Pilate, meaning Jesus was about to put all the religious lies and the robbers and thieves who perpetrate those lies to the masses on trial. Jesus was reiterating what He said in chapter 14 of this very same Gospel account, that all others, and all the paths of others, those myriad paths that supposedly lead to paradise, from the teachings of the Pope to the Imam to the Dali Lama to Joseph Smith to whoever produced this latest miniseries, all of them have been put on trial by Jesus and have been found more than wanting. Jesus did not come here to change a fallen world into an unfallen world; He did not come to make bad people good people, He came to bring dead people back to life; to bring people eternally dead in trespasses and sin back to life eternal to escape hell and end up living with Him in heaven.&#8226; D: Finally, I saw another few minutes of this miniseries today as I was getting ready to go to work and it had Jesus hunkering down to be face level with a child, telling that child in a sing-songy voice that there would not be one stone left upon another of the Jerusalem temple. Jesus playfully pokes this child to emphasize each word he says and he is smiling as the child giggles. To those who know the bible and what our Lord was talking about here, the misrepresentation is as plain as noses on faces. What Jesus is referring to is what began to happen as a result of unbelief of Him as the authentic Messiah in AD66 when the siege of Jerusalem began under the onslaught of the Romans. The destruction was so obliterating that tens of hundreds of thousands of Jews died; they starved to the point that they turned on one another behind those towering walls, they murdered each other, it is reported by the historian Josephus that they even went so far as to eat their own children before being murdered by Rome. The Messiah, the real Messiah, would never have recounted this prophesy in this sing-song manner to a child, telling this child that the temple she was taught by her parents as being foundational to their very lives was about to be destroyed; the child would not have been giggling if he had done this, in fact it would have traumatized this child beyond belief. Jesus did not do this in the bible. He prophesied about the ruin of the temple; that there would no longer be a temple, therefore no more sacrifices of animals would take place to annually atone for the sins of the Jewish people; He was to be the final sacrifice, once for all who would come to believe; therefore what is labelled Judaism today is a false one; there is no other sacrifice to be accepted for the atonement of sins; that sacrifice had been fulfilled by the crucifixion of Yeshua of Nazareth; and one must believe that the ransom  has been delivered , the debt for sin paid in full by the precious blood of the Lamb forevermore in order to be rescued from the approaching flames that have no end.These inaccurate Hollywood New Age depictions are a dangerous devise devised by dangerous men and women intent on keeping the truth, the biblical truth, even Yeshua Himself, in the dark; to keep this truth from the masses whilst giving them the impression that the truth has in fact been presented to them. And even though some may roll their eyes and inwardly groan, (in and out of church circles), desiring that we who believe the biblical account would just &#8216;lighten up&#8217; and &#8216;wink the eye&#8217; at such worldly depictions of our Saviour, we must continue to do as our Lord has taught us to do, to bear witness of the truth He came to die for, that truth so unpopular in our world, that truth that saves souls from hell and, hopefully, has heaven one glorious day overflowing.With Prayers of Shalom-Peace & May you remember me loving you enough to tell you the truth,Your brother in

From the old testament some of the tales included the story of Abraham, the battle of Jericho, David and Goliath, and Sampson and Delilah to name just a few.  Each of these tales were told with stunning  graphics and stayed reasonable true to the story, though at times certain things were added for effect.  Many parts of the old testament were quickly glossed over, like the story of Adam and Even, Cain and Able, and Noah and the Ark, but these important characters were at least acknowledged.The new testament was even more beautiful. It was stunning watching Jesus touch the lives of the people. I was especially happy to see Mary Magellan given a primary role among this followers, equal to that of the men.  The crucifixion scene was especially well done. Religious views aside, to see a undeserving man suffer in such a horrible, to see his mother and friends weeping as they watched,  brought tears to my eyes. Yes, there are some plot holes.

It's like a bunch of writers with no narrative talent heard a few stories in a sunday school somewhere, decided to base a show off of it, and then grabbed a few excerpts from the most generic melo-dramatic scores they could possibly find to set as the backgroundmusic all throughout the ENTIRE thing. And then they decided to throw an asian kung-fu fighting angel dressed as a gladiator wielding two dull swords somewhere in the middle of it all. Considering this is the history channel, all we're missing is space aliens.The Bible miniseries is a densely vague series of happenings strung together by events which seemingly have no connection to one another offering no explanations, no context, no development, and no substance, with wooden characters that are all on screen for only ten minutes at a time before being dropped entirely for new characters that also seemingly have no connection to one another all begging for our sympathy even though we've got absolutely no time to get to know any of them or how they even fit into this massively dense vague piece of shclop written by people who have absolutely no understanding about what they're even writing about. It's like the writers are ten year olds with ADHD tripping on cocaine. They have no attention span and their points are too rushed and incoherent to make any sense of.I also felt it bordered on blasphemous while demonstrating a minute understanding of faith with an even smaller sense for how God works, it almost seemed repudiate. This series doesn't work as a drama because the characters are only on for fifteen minutes at a time before they're dropped entirely for new characters. It doesn't work as a historic chronicle because it's far too apparent the writers don't understand anything about Jewish customs or history, and they also completely fabricate lot of things while skipping over vital events entirely in some shameless and pathetic attempt at dramatization, offering no explanation for how the events are even connected.

1613752,AZH44E4JCQ1GM,B00AMR5FGA,"PJ ""PJ""","[1, 7]","I'm only 3 hours into this ""Epic Mini-Series"" from the folks at The History Channel and I already have so many issues I don't know where to begin. I guess the obvious place is where everyone else has already commented: the gratuitous violence and non-stop bloody gore. WTF??? I can't get my mind around how this kind of bloodfest can be touted as ""wholesome entertainment with a message."" I mean, I can just imagine the casting call notice in Variety:Wanted:500 dirty, oily, sweaty, muscular, long-haired males who can sneer and clank swords loudly while gnashing their teeth and screaming ""ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH"" over and over and over at the top of their lungs in skimpy Roman costumes.For the life of me I can not figure out what the demographic is that this series is targeting. Definitely not children, or even young adults. CERTAINLY not women, of any age. Perhaps there is a heretofore unknown sub-sect of white, male, raw-goat-eating barbarians in need of religious conversion? I'm mystified.The whole draw for me here was Roma Downey. Yes, ""Touched By An Angel's"" Roma-God-Loves-You-Downey, perhaps the loveliest and gentlest Irish lass ever to have walked the earth. Although I haven't gotten to that part yet, I understand she plays Mary, mother of Jesus, and I can't think of a more suitable role for her. I keep telling myself as I plod through this (I can only take a few minutes at a time but I WILL get through the whole thing- I am COMMITTED) I keep telling myself that surely Roma will somehow redeem this unholy MESS called ""The Bible"" which, thus far appears to have VERY LITTLE to do with the real message of the Great Holy Book.Another thing I take issue with is this: why is it considered so politically incorrect to expect that Middle-Easterners should be played by people who look, and sound, like Middle-Easterners? Racially and ethnically this thing is all over the map! But we know it couldn't have been that way in reality. Delilah had a British accent? Samson was a Jamaican? I can understand the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"" when I'm watching a dramatization, especially fiction or science-fiction. What I am unable to manage is the required ""suspension of intellect"" that filmmakers require of anyone unfortunate enough to try to ingest godforsaken crap like this. What's next? A biopic of Hitler portrayed by an Asian? A white woman as Muhammed Ali? A red-headed Irish boy as Confuscius? Give me a break!I guess the lesson here is that The History Channel stopped being about History a long, long time ago. Gone are the days of wonderful, enjoyable quality educational fare with narration by the wonderful Edward Herrmann. How I miss that! No, now it's reality shows and blood-and-guts Vikings and Romans and Swamp People and heaven knows what's next! This ""Bible"" series is a perfect example of how far today's entertainment has sunk.Something else that is troublesome for me is the narration. This story is sooooo egregiously condensed and the way that it literally zips through centuries in a matter of seconds can be dizzying. The narration is supposed to cover this but it doesn't. It breaks up the film, bringing the viewer out of the distant past and into the modern day by the usage of a too-informal, relaxed, conversational narration style rather than one that fits the film and which bespeaks HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. It also takes the story-telling into documentary format which is jarring and offputting. Those two words apply as well to the jerky, convulsive, constantly swinging camera movements, especially in the battle scenes. We never get to actually SEE what's going on, or how a character reacts to the action, for more than the fleetingest of instants. I assume this ""technique"" is intended to put me into the picture by making me seasick? Or perhaps it is intended to disguise shoddy production. Methinks the latter. I know I sound smug, and that's really not me. But I am not fooled by tricks intended to make me think some work was done where needed effort was actually WITHHELD, and that is happening continually throughout this movie. It's a shame, too, because the actual production VALUES appear to be rather high. After a while the viewer begins to feel his intelligence, and that of the audience at large, is being insulted, plain and simple.Personally, when I think ""Bible"" I immediately think of the Love-of-God. So far that concept hasn't even been HINTED at in this series. I'm a collector of biblical movies and truly enjoy the simple yet authoritative wisdom imparted in such films and shows. I find it encouraging and healing. But so far this series has shown only the absolute WORST of humanity imaginable: man killing man, senselessly, constantly, unthinkingly and uncaringly, destroying families and innocents, plundering and raping and looting and robbing and damning and condemning and hating, hating, hating. Always furious, with bloodthirst unquenchable, that is the man we see here, in just about every scene thus far. Heaven help us if that's what we ever were! I for one simply DO NOT believe it! But we live in a day and age when even the document most sacred to a very large segment of humanity can be bastardized and trashed in the name of profit by using methods geared toward garnering ratings, ratings, ratings above all else. Above being true to the content of the source. Above the best interests and the uplifting of the audience for whom the film was supposedly made. We know who this film was made for, and it was NOT the masses. It was made for the people whose bank accounts might be enriched, period. And that's disgraceful.Anyway, in case I haven't made it clear I am hating this series. And remaining open-minded is proving a tremendous challenge.I may have more to say as I watch more of this unspeakable trash, I'll have to see if I can make it through to the end.Stay tuned!UPDATE 6-27-13:I have now made it into hour 5 of this godforsaken MESS. Which is Part III, so I'm halfway through. I'm pretty sure the body count is now equal to that of all the Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, Stallone and Willis movies put together. When I saw the scene where two tots have their throats slit while their father, the king, is forced to watch just before his own eyes are gauged out I was deeply, deeeeply disturbed. Then it hit me: the goal of the producers was to get people to TURN AWAY from the Bible! Aha! Now it makes sense. And with that as its goal I am able to say that this ""production"" is pretty much a resounding success.Regardless, black holes in deep space don't suck as much as this mini-series.",1,Bible

This highly anticipated miniseries achieved high ratings and praise from Christians and non-Christians but this could also be defined as a problem. Where was Joseph in ""The Bible?"" Was he not the link to the Hebrews entering Egypt? Did Moses plunge his staff into the Red Sea to divide it as the miniseries depicts? Did not God tell Moses to lift his staff, stretch his hand out over the sea and divide it (Exodus 14:16). Remember, a similar action later in the Wilderness disqualified Moses from Canaan (Numbers 20). When Jesus walked on the water during the storm and Peter joined him on the waves (Matthew 14) was it a dream or an actual event? The actor playing Peter awoke as if it was a dream. Before entering Jerusalem for the last time did Jesus know he would be betrayed and have to die on the cross? The scriptures say yes (Matthew 16, 17, 20. Mark 10. Luke 9. John 12:7 etc;.) ""The Bible"" depicts this differently.

It is an overview of the whole bible in less than 10 hours, so they had to leave some stuff out, to make it interesting and develop some characters. We felt ourselves drawn into the story. it is very engaging and the producers have done a  great job keeping the thread through it all. I love how they connect all the dots and not just put all the stories next to each other.It starts w/ Noah in the ark, but he tells the story of creation and connects Adams and eves sin w/ the flood.They added their own imaginations to it,for example how Sarah would respond to the sacrifice. I also saw a nice clip of Jesus during  the interview and Jesus is portrait as a gentle man w/ authority.

Thomas never went to India. John was exiled to Patmos but was never poisoned. Also, Saul of Tarsus had his name changed to Paul, after his conversion on the road to Damascus. I realize that any presentation of Revelation would be difficult. However, the small bit, which was shown, did not do justice to or properly present Revelation.  Also, the Bible does not state that Jesus showed the hole in hand to John. He showed it to Thomas, after His resurrection.

So, at first, some of the omissions, the simplifications and the variations from familiar accounts bothered me.That all ended when I got my first glimpse of Jesus in part 3. This was the Jesus I have come to know and love! I was impressed with the characterization, with the approach this Jesus had in dealing with people. For example, the mental image I always got of Jesus' first encounter with Simon Peter was much more formal and distant. In this depiction, Jesus wades out into the water waist-deep and compels Peter to help him aboard the boat.I admit a prejudice. My experience has taught me Jesus is much more than just a concept, more than a historical figure in some dry and dusty book. I've seen Him get involved in the lives of many people, pretty much the same way as He did with Simon Peter. It resonated with me because I've experienced much the same thing myself.While &#34;The Bible&#34; was entertaining, it shouldn't be mistaken for a substitute for a personal relationship with God.

1613794,A2C3GGKSWI4OZB,B00AMR5FGA,S. A. S. L.,"[1, 2]","Never have I seen a show that has touched me so deeply as this epic mini-series. I'm all for it when 'The Bible' reaches new listeners, picks up those that have fallen, those who are lost or refreshes their faith when it has gone stale.I was struggling this past year with many things. I am a person of faith but felt that even I had lost some of the fire in my soul.  I was having trouble finding it again. I had faith. I just felt it was becoming 'stale'.Then, I watched 'The Bible' when it first came out on the History Channel.  I loved every minute of the stories from 'Genesis' to the book of 'Revelation'.  I felt some of that fire returning. Diogo Morgado lit up the screen with his portrayal of Jesus Christ. I saw such passion on his face and love in his eyes every second he was on screen. But, what lifted my spirits and renewed every ounce of faith I had in me was when I saw the interview of Diogo on Youtube.  With so much warmth and conviction, he teared up as he talked about how he was haunted by the Crucifixion scene.  I know Diogo is a very talented actor but he seemed completely genuine and humbled by going through this experience. He did shine when he talked about his role. It was evident on his face.But, can we please drop the #HotJesus now?(I never jumped on that bandwagon). It feels sacrilegious to me.  He gets asked about that hashtag in every interview and I know he's being nice but I can tell it makes him a little uncomfortable. I like #SexyDiogo, however. I like #LovingJesus or #MercifulJesus. But not #HotJesus.  This beautiful story isn't about how sexy people think Jesus(Morgado) is but what He came here to do for us.  Matthew 26:28: ""For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remissions of sins."" That's the message this whole series is trying to convey.  Jesus gives his heart freely and loves unconditionally. He sacrificed so that we may live.Darwin Shawn, as the disciple, Peter, did a fantastic job embracing the role of Jesus' favorite follower. He truly let the Lord work through him and was so convincing in his role that I wanted to be there in that moment with him;  with them all.  Roma Downey was excellent as Mary. To watch her help her son pick up his cross, knowing what was in store for him was heart breaking. We get to see suffering on different levels and in various ways. We suffer through the eyes of another--'suffering by proxy'.Since I've already watched it on t.v., I'm leaving a review now. Though, I will be getting the DVD for my birthday next month! :)Diogo Morgado said he would be happy if this series even touched one soul. No, you have touched millions with your gifts. Never let them die or become corrupted by the monsters of the industry. Your role has renewed my spirit. He was perfect for this role as Jesus Christ. He seems down to earth and humble. He wanted to play the Jesus he knew. In Matthew 11:29---""Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto you souls."" No one could portray Jesus so humbly as Diogo has so beautifully done. Who better to play the part than one who is kind, warm and also humble? Example: When asked if he was 'famous' in Portugal, he said, ""I'm known there."" A perfect answer. He didn't say 'I'm a famous actor/model'. It does one no good to think too highly of him/herself. It's better to let others praise your work than to praise yourself.I highly recommend this series to any and all who are looking for more; for those who are tired of what they are watching on t.v. and in movies; for those who have seen enough violence and depravity to last two lifetimes; for those seeking the positive to overshadow all the negative we endure in this world.Diogo didn't have say a word or even move.  I've never seen an actor convey everything they had in them as Diogo did portraying Jesus.  I knew exactly what he was 'saying' just by looking in his eyes. Diogo is extremely blessed and gifted when all he needs to do is show his eyes and you just know. The eyes are the windows to the soul. It seems Diogo really is a sweet person if the saying is true.Watch my video that is dedicated to this series. [...]ETA: I couldn't wait for my birthday so I went ahead and ordered it express. I didn't want to wait an extra 8 days. I know, patience is a virtue. ;)5+ stars.",5,Soul wrenching,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,4361,"['Never', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'touched', 'so', 'deeply', 'mini-series', ""'m"", 'when', 'Bible', 'reaches', 'new', 'listeners', 'up', 'have', 'fallen', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'refreshes', 'faith', 'when', 'gone', 'stale.I', 'was', 'struggling', 'past', 'year', 'many', 'things', 'am', 'person', 'faith', 'felt', 'even', 'had', 'lost', 'fire', 'soul', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'finding', 'again', 'had', 'faith', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'becoming', ""'stale'.Then"", 'watched', 'Bible', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'History', 'Channel', 'loved', 'minute', 'stories', ""'Genesis"", 'book', ""'Revelation"", 'felt', 'fire', 'returning', 'Diogo', 'Morgado', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'saw', 'such', 'passion', 'face', 'love', 'eyes', 'second', 'was', 'screen', 'what', 'lifted', 'spirits', 'renewed', 'ounce', 'faith', 'had', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'interview', 'Diogo', 'Youtube', 'so', 'much', 'warmth', 'conviction', 'teared', 'up', 'talked', 'how', 'was', 'haunted', 'Crucifixion', 'scene', 'know', 'Diogo', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'seemed', 'completely', 'genuine', 'humbled', 'going', 'experience', 'did', 'shine', 'when', 'talked', 'role', 'was', 'evident', 'face.But', 'can', 'please', 'drop', 'HotJesus', 'now', 'never', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'sacrilegious', 'asked', 'hashtag', 'interview', 'know', 'being', 'nice', 'can', 'tell', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'like', 'SexyDiogo', 'however', 'like', 'LovingJesus', 'MercifulJesus', 'not', 'HotJesus', 'beautiful', 'story', ""n't"", 'how', 'sexy', 'people', 'think', 'Jesus', 'Morgado', 'what', 'came', 'here', 'do', '26:28', 'blood', 'new', 'testament', 'shed', 'many', 'remissions', 'sins', 'message', 'whole', 'series', 'trying', 'convey', 'Jesus', 'heart', 'freely', 'unconditionally', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'may', 'live.Darwin', 'Shawn', 'disciple', 'Peter', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'embracing', 'role', 'Jesus', 'favorite', 'follower', 'truly', 'let', 'Lord', 'work', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'moment', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'was', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'watch', 'help', 'son', 'pick', 'up', 'cross', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'was', 'heart', 'breaking', 'get', 'see', 'suffering', 'different', 'levels', 'various', 'ways', 'suffer', 'eyes', ""'suffering"", ""proxy'.Since"", ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 't.v.', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'review', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'DVD', 'birthday', 'next', 'month', 'Diogo', 'Morgado', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'series', 'even', 'touched', 'one', 'soul', 'No', 'have', 'touched', 'millions', 'gifts', 'Never', 'let', 'die', 'become', 'corrupted', 'monsters', 'industry', 'role', 'renewed', 'spirit', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'down', 'earth', 'humble', 'wanted', 'play', 'Jesus', 'knew', 'Matthew', '11:29', 'Take', 'yoke', 'learn', 'am', 'meek', 'lowly', 'heart', 'ye', 'shall', 'find', 'rest', 'souls', 'one', 'could', 'portray', 'Jesus', 'so', 'humbly', 'Diogo', 'so', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Who', 'better', 'play', 'part', 'one', 'who', 'kind', 'warm', 'also', 'humble', 'Example', 'When', 'asked', 'was', ""'famous"", 'Portugal', 'said', ""'m"", 'known', 'there', 'perfect', 'answer', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'famous', 'actor/model', 'one', 'good', 'think', 'too', 'highly', 'him/herself', 'better', 'let', 'others', 'praise', 'work', 'praise', 'yourself.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'tired', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 't.v', 'movies', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'violence', 'depravity', 'last', 'two', 'lifetimes', 'seeking', 'positive', 'overshadow', 'negative', 'endure', 'world.Diogo', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'word', 'even', 'move', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'convey', 'everything', 'had', 'Diogo', 'did', 'portraying', 'Jesus', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', ""'saying"", 'just', 'looking', 'eyes', 'Diogo', 'extremely', 'blessed', 'gifted', 'when', 'do', 'show', 'eyes', 'just', 'know', 'eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'soul', 'Diogo', 'really', 'sweet', 'person', 'saying', 'true.Watch', 'video', 'dedicated', 'series', ']', 'ETA', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'birthday', 'went', 'ahead', 'ordered', 'express', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'extra', '8', 'days', 'know', 'patience', 'virtue', '5+', 'stars']",The Bible: The Epic Miniseries

It of course very much sanitized some parts of the stories and in some cases add some creative license.  One notable sanitation was they changed the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah to violence and sexual promiscuity rather than the rampant homosexuality the bible describes.  There were ugly human failings that were omitted.  They failed to explain that Ishmael was the father of the Arab race that would spend all of human history from that day trying to kill the Jews.  This would have been a great tie in since the Muslim Brotherhood is linking all Arab nations together right now for that purpose.  (With American help I might add).  They also portrayed Moses with his hands held up in Triumph as they paraded him through the city.  According to the Bible Moses was the most humble man who ever lived and would never have allowed this,  plus he had a speech impediment, a fact that most movies skip simply because it would be hard to have a lead character who rarely speaks.If the show interests some young people to actually pick up and read this book that has survived unchanged for thousands of years it will have served a good purpose.

1613816,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00AMR5FGA,Steven Hancock,"[0, 0]","In the past two millennia, no other work has had the profound impact on the people of the world as that of the stories found in the Holy Bible. Full of stories about faith, hope, love, courage and sacrifice, these stories continue to inspire millions around the globe. This past March, executive producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey brought these powerful stories to life in a ten-part miniseries for the History Channel. In less than ten hours, they attempted the daunting task of taking as many of the narrative stories as they could, and fit them into a cohesive narrative. And what they created became the miniseries event of 2013, scoring high ratings, and breathing fresh life into these stories.The first five parts of this series are devoted to stories from the Old Testament. This proved to be the most difficult part of the Bible to adapt for the miniseries. Consisting of 39 books, and a great many narrative stories, it would be impossible to tell the entire Old Testament in a dramatic way. For the series, the producers focus on seven stories from the first part of the Bible: Creation to the Flood, Abraham, Moses, Joshua and the Fall of Jericho, Samson, Saul and David, and Daniel. These first five episodes can be considered a ""cliff notes"" version of the biblical tales. Each episode covers a good chunk of time, and only hits the highlights of those stories. But what makes these episodes work are the terrific writing, fantastic performances, and beautiful visual effects. Several of the stories (In particular, Abraham commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac, and Daniel and the Fiery Furnace) are very powerful, and will move viewers to tears. Despite the leap-frog over the stories, the acting and writing alone give these five episodes a 9/10, or A-.The second half of the series is devoted to the New Testament. This is the easier part of the Bible to translate to film. Of the 27 books in this part of the Bible, only five are strict narrative, with four focusing on the story of Jesus Christ. So, telling this story in five hours meant more time for the story to breathe. And it is here that the series hits its high-mark. Once again, the writing is fantastic, and the visual effects well-done. But the highlight of this part of the series is the acting. In particular, Diogo Morgado's soulful portrayal of Jesus. From the first moment he steps on the screen, to the final image of the series, Morgado gives one of the best portrayals of the Messiah on film (Best portrayal still goes to Jim Caviezel inThe Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray], but Morgado ranks a very close second), and will leave many who watch it emotionally connected to Him. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. For this part of the series, I give a 10/10, or A+.One of the further highlights over the entire program is the amazing score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe. This work connects all ten episodes emotionally, and really help to pull the full drama out of the scenes. In particular, the same piece of music (entitled ""Faith"" on the soundtrack album) is played over both the scene where Abraham prepares to sacrifice Isaac, and the scene of Christ being crucified. In both cases, you are overcome by what is being seen on film. The acting, writing and music all three come into such beautiful connection in these two scenes, and will definitely make viewers cry.The Blu-ray release presents the series with terrific picture and sound, and a few extras that give good background information on the making of the series. Overall, ""The Bible"" is a powerful filmed version of some of the greatest stories ever told. Whether you know these stories by heart, or wish to learn what makes these stories so important to over two-billion people worldwide, this miniseries is an excellent place to go.

1613837,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B00AMR5FGA,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 2]","When this highly rated miniseries first aired on the History Channel in spring 2013, I was unimpressed. I caught a few minutes of the first episode, watched at least one of the Jesus episodes, and concluded that it was mostly flash over substance. But after finally buying the DVD set in March 2014, and watching it all the way through, I'm surprised to say that it's actually quite an impressive series despite its flaws. As a scripture teacher at a Catholic high school, I can now say I highly recommend it as a good visual sampling of the sacred text.The best thing about this series is that it depicts the entire Bible, in 10 episodes, as one overarching theme of God's love for humanity. There is a continuity of style and theme in the filmmaking that is breathtaking to witness on film, as the video flies through the Hebrew Torah and New Testament with startling narrative drive. Rather than having to rent multiple videos with different actors and technical crews to follow the Bible on film, we've got it all -- well, the greatest hits -- here in one miniseries.The Old Testament episodes wisely depict God's relationship with humanity through God's five covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David. Some of these episodes are quite good, particularly the deeply moving episode concerning Abraham, which captures his story -- a highlight is the climactic near-sacrifice of his son Isaac -- with poignancy and clarity. Each episode is organized by a theme that holds together disparate Biblical sources remarkably well. The Moses episode is excellent despite ending too abruptly as he returns from Sinai with the commandments, depriving us of the Golden Calf and many other memorable moments. The episodes on Joshua, Samson, King Saul, and King David do a fine job in depicting the rise of Israel's kingdom. But the episode featuring Israel's subjugation under Babylon and Persia carries perhaps the greatest power outside of the Abraham material, giving us iconic renditions of the fiery furnace and Lion's Den captivity stories from the Book of Daniel, with heartfelt performances by the actors playing Daniel and others.The New Testament episodes slow down quite a bit, minimizing the narration as we come to focus four full episodes on Jesus of Nazareth, with just the tenth and final episode used to squeeze in the Acts of the Apostles and a hint of Revelation. The Jesus episodes are so-so, but the Acts of the Apostles episode at the end of the series is particularly good, inasmuch as one feels the continuity of watching the same actors from the Jesus episodes. I would have liked to see more of the apostolic martyrdom traditions (particularly Peter) depicted rather than just described by the narrator, but it's really neat to see Acts and Revelation building to a climax with the same actors in the same series. By the end, you really feel like you've sampled the whole Bible, albeit the ""greatest hits"" version. It doesn't feel like 9 hours at all and the last disc of this four-disc set even includes a moving ""Mary, Did You Know?"" music video in addition to a helpful documentary feature.Presentation style is a plus here. The framing device with Noah relating Genesis 1-3 at the start of episode one is clever, reflecting the fact that this primeval history emerges from a symbolic oral storytelling tradition designed to impart religious truth rather than scientific facts. The Hans Zimmer-infused musical score, costumes, and filmmaking all create a theatrical unity to this material. The color-blind casting of the roles (i.e. a black Samson and many middle eastern actors mixed with the British thespians) make the series feel particularly representative of the Middle Eastern melting pot. And the narration by Keith David does a nice job of providing transitions between many stories.On the negative side, one often feels the absence in this show of what is left out from the Bible, wishing the filmmakers had gone for broke by filming a few more episodes. Cutting straight from Abraham to Moses overlooks the story of Jacob (Israel) and his 12 sons, ancestors of the 12 tribes, and of the particularly moving Joseph story of reconciliation among these brothers that concludes Genesis. Ending the Moses episode right when it was getting really exciting is a bummer. And the story of Solomon, or at least of the division of Israel into a northern and southern kingdom under Solomon's son, would have helped alleviate the narrative incoherence of the rushed effort to portray Babylon's conquest of Jerusalem and the story of the prophet Jeremiah. There's no hint here that the northern kingdom, including prophets like Isaiah and Jonah, ever existed. Finally, I wish the series would have at least acknowledged Alexander the Great and the revolt of the Maccabees (subject of Hanukkah) that re-established an independent Jewish kingdom prior to the Roman conquest in 63 BC. Although most Protestant and Jewish Bibles exile the two books of Maccabees to second-canon status, these events would still help us understand the Roman conquest better.This brings me to the only weakness of the series, which is its general unevenness. It tries to squeeze the 46 books of the Old Testament into 5 episodes while spreading out the 27 New Testament books over 5 episodes as well. As a result, the Old Testament episodes gradually feel rushed while the New Testament episodes linger over the gospel accounts of Jesus to the exclusion of much other material.Nevertheless, this series is contemporary enough (John the Baptist has dreds!) and breezy enough (episodes range from 40 to 54 minutes) to be a powerful teaching tool for group study or classroom use. While the excellent TNT Bible Series has richer miniseries teleplays, they tend to be three hours long and frequently padded with extra-biblical material, limiting their classroom use unless one has lots of time to spare. This History Channel series is more like a summary or paraphrase of the Bible, giving us (as the opening scrawl proclaims) the spirit of the text in digestible nuggets rather than word-for-word accuracy. I highly recommend it for teenagers, particularly younger ones, as an entree into the Bible. Older students will want more meat, but this series is more than enough to whet the appetite of spiritual seekers who normally avoid religious material.I revisited this miniseries after seeing ""Son of God"" in theaters and being favorably impressed with its 2 1/2 hour theatrical cut of the 4 hours of Jesus material from the series. To be candid, I found the Jesus material in ""Son of God"" far more compelling than it is in the miniseries, where it is chopped up over four episodes and dramatically weighed down by the omniscient narration. I found it helpful to purchase the full miniseries DVD set for this reason: The last episode on Acts and Revelation, titled ""Courage,"" makes a great epilogue to watching ""Son of God"" on its own! It feels like a 50-minute sequel to the theatrical film, which is particularly valuable since there are no top-notch films on Acts of the Apostles (only miniseries and low-budget stuff) available to buy.The Bible Miniseries take on ""Acts of the Apostles"" is not comprehensive, but it hits the major plot points and grows organically out of the Jesus episodes. With so many creaky older Biblical TV films floating around, it's great to have one portable DVD package with visuals from the whole Bible that hold together well in one narrative. This four-disc DVD set in a thin clamshell case is definitely worth owning if you want a visual taste of scripture.",5,Contemporary effort to portray the entire Bible on film,1395705600,"03 25,
