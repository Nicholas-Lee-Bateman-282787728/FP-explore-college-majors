239059,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6300273369,Alex Udvary,"[12, 12]","Michelango Antonioni is one of the great figures in Italian cinema. He has worked with Fellini, they co-wrote &quot;The White Sheik, a film I think is one of Fellini's best. Antonioni, of course, is a great filmmaker himself. Probably best known for his films &quot;L'Avventura&quot; and &quot;Blowup&quot;. &quot;The Passenger&quot; is a film I admire very much. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the film. It moves at a subtle pace, but it's a strong gripping film. Antonioni just seems to let the scenes flow with their own certain rhythm. Nothing in his style seems forced to me. And what about Jack Nicholson's performance!? I personally feel this was the period where Jack was in his stride. He has just finished Roman Polanski's &quot;Chinatown&quot;, a true masterpiece, and his next project would be Milos Forman's &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;. Proving just how great he is. He's one of the best actors we have, no question!&quot;The Passenger&quot; tells the story of a man who is upset with his life. He's a tv reporter, who is married with an adopted son. Things in the marriage are not going very well. The love has faded and David Locke, the reporter played by Nicholson seeks a way out. He wants to begin a new life.David Locke is sent to Africa to do a documentary on a war going on. When there David meets a Mr. Robertson (Chuck Mulvehill). While staying at a hotel David notices that Roberston has died. And it's at this moment David feels here's his chance. He is able to get a chance to start all over again. So David switches passports with the man and assumes his identity. Word gets out about &quot;David Locke's&quot; passing. His wife, Rachel (Jenny Runacre) and tv producer Martin Knight (Ian Mendry)try to track down Robertson, thinking perhaps he'll have some answers fot them, since it is known that David knew him. And was staying at the same hotel.Now, meanwhile David (Nicholson) starts leading the life of Robertson, which is not safe (and I won't say why). He meets a girl (Marie Schenider). Together they have a little affair, can anyone remember &quot;Last Tango In Paris&quot;? Just there's no butter here lol.As might me expected Antonioni avoids the chances at given the movie too much human emotion. The same way he did with &quot;L'Avventura&quot;. &quot;The Passenger&quot; is a character study of sorts. Not too much information is given away back David's past, but, that's okay. The movie works. And I can only hope the film is put on dvd soon. The film has become forgotten. More people need to see it.I also want to note that the cinematograpy has a very intimate feel to it. Luciano Tovoli manages to catch, at moments, this loneliness that we sense in David. The movie might move too slow for some viewers, but, maybe if you watch it twice you'll notice there's a lot more than meets the eye.Bottom-line: One of Nicholson's best performance. A strong subtle film with wonderful directing by Antonioni. Many might say it's slow moving, but, it's powerful.",5,Passing Through,1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,3011,"['Michelango', 'Antonioni', 'one', 'great', 'figures', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'worked', 'Fellini', 'co-wrote', 'quot', 'White', 'Sheik', 'film', 'think', 'one', 'Fellini', 'best', 'Antonioni', 'course', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'Probably', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'quot', ""L'Avventura"", 'quot', 'quot', 'Blowup', 'quot', 'quot', 'Passenger', 'quot', 'film', 'admire', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'subtle', 'pace', 'strong', 'gripping', 'film', 'Antonioni', 'just', 'let', 'scenes', 'flow', 'own', 'certain', 'rhythm', 'Nothing', 'style', 'forced', 'what', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'personally', 'feel', 'was', 'period', 'where', 'Jack', 'was', 'stride', 'just', 'finished', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'quot', 'Chinatown', 'quot', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'next', 'project', 'would', 'be', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'quot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'quot', 'Proving', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'have', 'question', 'quot', 'Passenger', 'quot', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'upset', 'life', 'tv', 'reporter', 'who', 'married', 'adopted', 'son', 'Things', 'marriage', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'very', 'well', 'love', 'faded', 'David', 'Locke', 'reporter', 'played', 'Nicholson', 'way', 'begin', 'new', 'life.David', 'Locke', 'sent', 'Africa', 'do', 'documentary', 'war', 'going', 'When', 'David', 'Mr.', 'Robertson', 'Chuck', 'Mulvehill', 'staying', 'hotel', 'David', 'Roberston', 'died', 'moment', 'David', 'here', 'chance', 'able', 'get', 'chance', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'So', 'David', 'switches', 'passports', 'man', 'identity', 'Word', 'out', 'quot', 'David', 'Locke', 'quot', 'passing', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'Jenny', 'Runacre', 'tv', 'producer', 'Martin', 'Knight', 'Ian', 'Mendry', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'Robertson', 'thinking', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'have', 'answers', 'fot', 'known', 'David', 'knew', 'was', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel.Now', 'meanwhile', 'David', 'Nicholson', 'leading', 'life', 'Robertson', 'not', 'safe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'girl', 'Marie', 'Schenider', 'Together', 'have', 'little', 'affair', 'can', 'anyone', 'remember', 'quot', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'quot', 'Just', 'butter', 'here', 'lol.As', 'might', 'expected', 'Antonioni', 'chances', 'given', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'human', 'emotion', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'quot', ""L'Avventura"", 'quot', 'quot', 'Passenger', 'quot', 'character', 'study', 'sorts', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'given', 'away', 'back', 'David', 'past', 'okay', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'film', 'put', 'dvd', 'soon', 'film', 'become', 'forgotten', 'More', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'it.I', 'also', 'want', 'note', 'cinematograpy', 'very', 'intimate', 'feel', 'Luciano', 'Tovoli', 'catch', 'moments', 'loneliness', 'sense', 'David', 'movie', 'might', 'move', 'too', 'slow', 'viewers', 'maybe', 'watch', 'twice', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'lot', 'more', 'eye.Bottom-line', 'One', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'performance', 'strong', 'subtle', 'film', 'wonderful', 'directing', 'Antonioni', 'Many', 'might', 'say', 'slow', 'moving', 'powerful']",N/A
239060,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300273369,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Michelangelo Antonioni.  What can I say?  I mean, I haven't seen a lot of his work (I've only seen 4 films) but I certainly admire his vision as a director.  He is always true to himself first, which is one of the first requirements for any auteur.  Yes, I've mentioned in past reviews that I am not a giant fan of his work.  I absolutely loved `La Notte' but found myself indifferent to both `Blow-Up' and `L'Eclisse'.`Professione: Reporter' is, by far, my favorite of the films I've seen from him.While the film is wrapped up in the genre of an international thriller (and semi-romantic love story), the film is more of an intelligently disguised character study.  Delving into the subject of self-discovery, Antonioni's masterpiece truly understands that underlying desire dwelling in all of us.The film tells the story of David Locke, a reporter working in Africa.  When a fellow traveler by the name of David Robertson suddenly dies, Locke decides (almost impulsively) to take on the man's identity.  This allows Locke to completely leave his old life (husband, father, journalist) and start over.  Locke knows nothing about Robertson, but he has his datebook and so he starts using it as a guide to his new life, taking meetings and slowly putting the pieces of Robertson's life together.  Soon, Locke uncovers the dangerous business Robertson was a part of, but he's far more concerned about his former life catching up with him.The film is truly intense, but it is the more human elements that prove the most haunting.  Locke represents every individual who has ever wanted to just walk away and start over.  His life isn't horrible, but his just unsatisfied with where he is headed.  He longs to find something that gives him a feeling of purpose.  By wandering aimlessly into another mans life, Locke has found that rush he was looking for.  In a conversation had towards the end of the film, Locke recounts his interactions with a blind man who had undergone a surgery to regain his sight.  He mentioned how the man was at first elated, but soon began to fear everything he never knew existed.  He became sheltered and reclusive and eventually killed himself.  That story adds layers to the character of David Locke, for it helps us to understand his mindset, which is not that uncommon or unique.  The fact is that this world is not a nice place, and even when things are going well for us, sometimes we can find ourselves derailed just by comprehending the world's darkness.Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors of all time, and here he is magnificent.  I loved Maria Schneider in `Last Tango in Paris', and while I found her a tad ragged in this film, she embodied her character nicely.  Jenny Runacre was, in my opinion, the films star performance.  It is a small but pivotal role (that of Locke's wife) and she smolders on the screen.This film is truly a directors vision, and it carries with it Antonioni's aesthetic, but it is certainly a film that all can enjoy.  Don't be afraid that this will be an artsy film, for while I won't say that it is commercial, I will say that it is accessible.",5,A journey into the soul...,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,3116,"['Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'mean', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'work', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', '4', 'films', 'certainly', 'admire', 'vision', 'director', 'always', 'true', 'first', 'one', 'first', 'requirements', 'auteur', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'past', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'giant', 'fan', 'work', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'La', 'Notte', 'found', 'indifferent', 'Blow-Up', ""L'Eclisse'."", 'Professione', 'Reporter', 'far', 'favorite', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'wrapped', 'up', 'genre', 'international', 'thriller', 'semi-romantic', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'intelligently', 'disguised', 'character', 'study', 'Delving', 'subject', 'self-discovery', 'Antonioni', 'masterpiece', 'truly', 'underlying', 'desire', 'dwelling', 'us.The', 'film', 'story', 'David', 'Locke', 'reporter', 'working', 'Africa', 'When', 'fellow', 'traveler', 'name', 'David', 'Robertson', 'suddenly', 'Locke', 'almost', 'impulsively', 'take', 'man', 'identity', 'Locke', 'completely', 'leave', 'old', 'life', 'husband', 'father', 'journalist', 'start', 'Locke', 'nothing', 'Robertson', 'datebook', 'so', 'using', 'guide', 'new', 'life', 'taking', 'meetings', 'slowly', 'putting', 'pieces', 'Robertson', 'life', 'together', 'Soon', 'Locke', 'dangerous', 'business', 'Robertson', 'was', 'part', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'former', 'life', 'catching', 'up', 'him.The', 'film', 'truly', 'intense', 'more', 'human', 'elements', 'prove', 'most', 'haunting', 'Locke', 'individual', 'who', 'ever', 'wanted', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'start', 'life', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'just', 'unsatisfied', 'where', 'headed', 'find', 'something', 'feeling', 'purpose', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'mans', 'life', 'Locke', 'found', 'rush', 'was', 'looking', 'conversation', 'had', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'Locke', 'interactions', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'undergone', 'surgery', 'regain', 'sight', 'mentioned', 'how', 'man', 'was', 'first', 'elated', 'soon', 'began', 'fear', 'everything', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'became', 'sheltered', 'reclusive', 'eventually', 'killed', 'story', 'layers', 'character', 'David', 'Locke', 'understand', 'mindset', 'not', 'uncommon', 'unique', 'fact', 'world', 'not', 'nice', 'place', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'sometimes', 'can', 'find', 'derailed', 'just', 'comprehending', 'world', 'darkness.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'time', 'here', 'magnificent', 'loved', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'found', 'tad', 'ragged', 'film', 'embodied', 'character', 'nicely', 'Jenny', 'Runacre', 'was', 'opinion', 'films', 'star', 'performance', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Locke', 'wife', 'smolders', 'screen.This', 'film', 'truly', 'directors', 'vision', 'Antonioni', 'aesthetic', 'certainly', 'film', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'artsy', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'commercial', 'will', 'say', 'accessible']",N/A
239061,ARA48345JZPZR,6300273369,Archmaker,"[8, 9]","Michaelangelo Antonioni takes as a starting point a plot that could have easily made a standard or even quite good thriller, and quietly dismantles nearly all of its thriller tropes to create a strange and moody meditation on the fragile veneer of identity, and the danger both psychic and real from stepping off from the known and familiar into the unknown and mysterious.A free-lance TV journalist forlornly trying to get some inside film on a North African rebel group abruptly switches identities with a look-alike stranger, dead of a heart attack, in the same run-down provincial hotel where both are staying. The remoteness of the locale, their close resemblance, and the unsophisticated institutions of this dismal country allow the journalist's impulsive caprice to succeed, and he begins an examination of both the life he's left behind and a search to answer the riddles of the identity he has stolen.All of this is told in unconventional fashion, 70's style, with wide vistas, deliberately leisurely pace, enigmatic dialogue or no dialogue at all, with a great attention to the visual space the characters inhabit and a mimimum of explanation as to what these characters are feeling.  There is some very clever work with time shifts done within continuing single shots, and of course, in the celebrated finale that elapses without dialogue and brings the film full circle in a single, justly famous, continuous shot.This film will try the patience of many a 21st.Century viewer.  Antonioni was all about breaking conventional screen story-telling devices, no less so than here, although this is actually one of his more accessible works.  I have found some of his other films impenetrable.Jack Nicholson's commentary is very welcome, less in recalling the shoot, however interesting, but more in his pointed comments as to how and where Antonioni breaks with traditional narrative.

Like ""Blow Up,"" this is another metaphysical thriller that uses the skeleton expectations of the action/adventure genre but slows down the tempo to focus on identity and alienation. The plot is improbable. How could the gunrunners not recognize that Jack Nicholson is not the gentleman they were expecting?But the storyline is not the reason to watch this film. The way Antonioni films the world is a feast for the eyes.  The North African landscape is especially stunning -- the desert, villages, and people. The film begins there and ends in a similarly dry and striking landscape, this time in southern Spain. At this final resting point Jack Nicholson delivers a monologue about how hopeless and dusty the world is.

That's because, despite Antonioni's usual visual brilliance, daring use of silences, and a unusually reserved performance from Jack Nicholson- one that is a bit of true acting, from long before he started phoning in performances; it is mild, void of memorable tics or quotes (save a humorous taking of Christ's name in vain in a German church that he reflexively apologizes to the air for, such as in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shining, or Batman), the film grinds to an emotional and narrative halt whenever Maria Schneider (no relation) appears onscreen. Simply put, she's not that good of an actress- which is why she faded after the 1970s, in her first post-Last Tango In Paris role, and she's not even particularly physically attractive, even in a European sense. No, her sorry and dull performance is not enough to torpedo the film like the weak last half of L'Avventura does that film, but it is enough to keep the film from the pantheon. The Passenger was also Antonioni's third English language film, after Blowup and Zabriskie Point. Music is almost wholly absent in this film. Seeing is all important in Antonioni films, and the effect of such silences is jarring. Antonioni's use of silences and spaces in the film frame reminds of the visuals of Vermeer's paintings, usually set in rooms that exude silences.The tale, what little there is of it, is very similar, from a macro perspective, to that in Blowup, in that much of what seems to be is not. The central character, Dave Locke (Nicholson), leads a shallow, anomic life as a documentary film reporter from England- who speaks with an American accent because he was educated in the States, a silly contrivance, who is trying to make not break news of a supposed war going on in an African country that is home to a pink desert with black mountains- perhaps Chad?, but instead of stumbling on to a mystery, as in Blowup, the lead character is the mystery. He impulsively switches places with a dead man, named Robertson (Charles Mulvehill) in a hotel room adjoining his, who could be a veritable doppelganger- the first of many coincidences in this film, after he has to walk back when his vehicle gets stuck in the desert after he goes to film rebels for a documentary. Such synchronicities are a major theme. The problem for Locke is that the ringer is a gun runner for the rebels in the meager little civil war that the country is enduring. This is the set up. However, this is all done with a bravura touch- as Locke stares deeply into Robertson's unblinking dead eyes, as if absorbing his identity, as a flute plays- the rare intercession of a soundtrack. The black Africans at the hotel never question Locke's claim that he is Robertson, despite not speaking with a British accent, as Antonioni nicely inverts the racist belief that all blacks look and sound alike, as the blacks cannot distinguish between two white men.The film was beautifully shot by Luciano Tovoli in France, Spain, and North Africa and is shown in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The Sony Classics DVD transfer is excellent, although not quite as pristine as the DVD for Blowup, despite being a decade younger. The only extra features are the film's trailer, and the film commentaries by Nicholson, and one with Peploe and journalist Aurora Irvine. Nicholson seems to have recorded his commentary with a sore throat, and goes for long minutes without a word. He does have some insight, but overall the lack of insight into the film or its making makes the track seem superfluous. Nicholson may have done it only because he owns the rights to the film and felt his name on a commentary track could add to the film's DVD sales. Peploe adds some interesting technical comments, as well as letting us know that an interesting scene of ants walking up a wire in the African hotel was scripted.That many dense American critics and viewers do not respond to Antonioni is sadly predictable, and an illustration of their frenetic MTV-level need to be spoonfed every possible detail and interpretation of a work of art, rather than engage it, imbue it, and find satisfactory answers to such queries on their own. Antonioni subverts such lowest common denominator expectations with ease and glee, and The Passenger is a terrific illustration of that claim, chock with its ellipses in time and narrative, as well as proof that film was the last century's most important and defining art form, well beyond writing or music, whose heydays were in earlier centuries. Its flaws are minors, but the things it offers to those willing to take from it are major.

239070,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,6300273369,Doreen Appleton,"[2, 4]","The structure, so reminiscent of L'Avventura, but with the opposite momentum: in L'Avventura, the lovers are wandering aimlessly from place to place, while in The Passenger Nicholson and Schneider are running away from his wife and the police for the last 50 minutes of the movie, sometimes making narrow escapes.You can't really understand To Kill A Mockingbird until you can thematize the hingelike relationship between Boo Radley and Tom Robinson. Similarly, in The Passenger, one must understand the relationship between impulsively changing your identity, and the world of politics and revolution. When David Locke impulsively assumes the identity of Robertson, he has become a gunrunner providing guns to revolutionaries in Africa. Locke is forced to confront the political world as an actor rather than as an observer (as a journalist he had interviewed the fascist dictator whose minions are now pursuing him as Robertson).Perhaps the link between the two concepts is the fact that a revolution is a starting-over, a violent abandoning of an enormous past, a step into an unknown future. The dislocation is profound. And the old guard, the dictatorship, clings to power with all its might, resisting change. Just as a person's identity clings to him or her, not so willing to be thrown away.The arc of the movie is described by Locke himself near the end, when he tells the story of a blind man who regained his sight. After an initial period of elation, the blind man began to notice the ugliness, the dirtiness of the world. He retreated into his room and eventually killed himself. Similarly, David Locke, initially exhilarated by his new identity (he said to Robertson, ""Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could leave each day behind, forget about it and start over?""), becomes depressed by it as the film goes on. He says to Maria Schneider, ""Let's go eat. The old me is hungry.""Soon after their meeting, as they are driving in his convertible, Schneider asks Locke, ""What are you running away from?"" He replies, ""Turn your back to the front seat."" She turns and sees a tree-lined road receding behind her. At first she smiles, amused by his metaphor. Then her smile fades as she senses the falseness of his position.At the end Locke is murdered by the dictator's secret police. But do they know his real identity? Do they believe they are murdering Robertson? Or do they realize that Locke is an impostor, and they are eliminating the impostor? In any case, Locke dies as another man. And when the police show his wife his dead body, she says significantly, ""I never knew him,"" which means, ""I never knew Robertson"" but also ""I never knew my husband. I never thought him capable of a stunt like taking on another man's identity.""My favorite sequence is the beginning, where the Africans treat Locke with arrogant indifference, and the empty desert helps conspire to frustrate him in his desire to get a story about the guerrillas who are fighting against the fascist government. There is an impressive aridity about this sequence, which is followed by the hotel's airy interior, where Locke converses with Robertson. The ceiling fan is used ingeniously by Antonioni as a time lapse device. We see Locke sitting at the table in his checked shirt, the camera looks up at the fan, and when it returns to Locke he is wearing Robertson's blue shirt.When Locke finds Robertson's body and decides to take on his identity, he correctly assumes that the Africans who run the hotel won't know the difference between one white man and another. He tells them Locke is dead, and they immediately inform the authorities.The film ends with the famous shot of the camera in Locke's room moving slowly toward the window, then through the bars of the window, as Locke is murdered off screen. Once outside the hotel, the camera watches the police arrive and take Locke's wife to the room where he is lying dead.The color lime green plays an important visual role in the movie. It is seen in the African hotel, it is on a wall in the German sequence, it it bathes the entire large restaurant where Locke and the girl are found by the police, who tell Schneider that Locke's wife thinks he is in danger.The Sony transfer is magnificent. The movie looks better on my plasma TV than it looked in the theater. There are commentaries by Jack Nicholson, interesting,[for instance, when Schneider says ""People disappear every day"" and Locke replies significantly, ""every time they leave the room,"" Nicholson comments that he himself added this line to the screenplay] and screenwriter Mark Peploe, less interesting.A complex, thought-provoking thriller which re-established Antonioni as a great filmmaker after the critical disaster of Zabriskie Point.",5,The danger of starting over,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,4735,"['structure', 'so', 'reminiscent', ""L'Avventura"", 'opposite', 'momentum', ""L'Avventura"", 'lovers', 'are', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'place', 'place', 'Passenger', 'Nicholson', 'Schneider', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'wife', 'police', 'last', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'making', 'narrow', 'escapes.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'can', 'thematize', 'hingelike', 'relationship', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'Similarly', 'Passenger', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'relationship', 'impulsively', 'changing', 'identity', 'world', 'politics', 'revolution', 'When', 'David', 'Locke', 'impulsively', 'identity', 'Robertson', 'become', 'gunrunner', 'providing', 'guns', 'revolutionaries', 'Africa', 'Locke', 'forced', 'confront', 'political', 'world', 'actor', 'rather', 'observer', 'journalist', 'had', 'interviewed', 'fascist', 'dictator', 'minions', 'are', 'now', 'pursuing', 'Robertson', 'link', 'two', 'concepts', 'fact', 'revolution', 'starting-over', 'violent', 'abandoning', 'enormous', 'past', 'step', 'unknown', 'future', 'dislocation', 'profound', 'old', 'guard', 'dictatorship', 'clings', 'power', 'might', 'resisting', 'change', 'Just', 'person', 'identity', 'clings', 'not', 'so', 'willing', 'be', 'thrown', 'away.The', 'arc', 'movie', 'described', 'Locke', 'end', 'when', 'story', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'regained', 'sight', 'initial', 'period', 'elation', 'blind', 'man', 'began', 'notice', 'ugliness', 'dirtiness', 'world', 'retreated', 'room', 'eventually', 'killed', 'Similarly', 'David', 'Locke', 'initially', 'exhilarated', 'new', 'identity', 'said', 'Robertson', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wonderful', 'could', 'leave', 'day', 'forget', 'start', 'becomes', 'depressed', 'film', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'Let', 'go', 'eat', 'old', 'hungry', 'Soon', 'meeting', 'are', 'driving', 'convertible', 'Schneider', 'Locke', 'What', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'Turn', 'back', 'front', 'seat', 'tree-lined', 'road', 'receding', 'first', 'amused', 'metaphor', 'Then', 'smile', 'fades', 'falseness', 'position.At', 'end', 'Locke', 'murdered', 'dictator', 'secret', 'police', 'do', 'know', 'real', 'identity', 'Do', 'believe', 'are', 'murdering', 'Robertson', 'do', 'realize', 'Locke', 'impostor', 'are', 'eliminating', 'impostor', 'case', 'Locke', 'man', 'when', 'police', 'show', 'wife', 'dead', 'body', 'significantly', 'never', 'knew', 'never', 'knew', 'Robertson', 'also', 'never', 'knew', 'husband', 'never', 'thought', 'capable', 'stunt', 'taking', 'man', 'identity', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'where', 'Africans', 'treat', 'Locke', 'arrogant', 'indifference', 'empty', 'desert', 'conspire', 'frustrate', 'desire', 'get', 'story', 'guerrillas', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'fascist', 'government', 'impressive', 'aridity', 'sequence', 'followed', 'hotel', 'airy', 'interior', 'where', 'Locke', 'Robertson', 'ceiling', 'fan', 'used', 'ingeniously', 'Antonioni', 'time', 'lapse', 'device', 'see', 'Locke', 'sitting', 'table', 'checked', 'shirt', 'camera', 'up', 'fan', 'when', 'Locke', 'wearing', 'Robertson', 'blue', 'shirt.When', 'Locke', 'Robertson', 'body', 'take', 'identity', 'correctly', 'Africans', 'who', 'run', 'hotel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'difference', 'one', 'white', 'man', 'Locke', 'dead', 'immediately', 'inform', 'authorities.The', 'film', 'famous', 'shot', 'camera', 'Locke', 'room', 'moving', 'slowly', 'window', 'then', 'bars', 'window', 'Locke', 'murdered', 'off', 'screen', 'Once', 'hotel', 'camera', 'police', 'arrive', 'take', 'Locke', 'wife', 'room', 'where', 'lying', 'dead.The', 'color', 'lime', 'green', 'important', 'visual', 'role', 'movie', 'seen', 'African', 'hotel', 'wall', 'German', 'sequence', 'entire', 'large', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Locke', 'girl', 'are', 'found', 'police', 'who', 'tell', 'Schneider', 'Locke', 'wife', 'danger.The', 'Sony', 'transfer', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'better', 'plasma', 'TV', 'looked', 'theater', 'are', 'commentaries', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'interesting', '[', 'instance', 'when', 'Schneider', 'People', 'disappear', 'day', 'Locke', 'replies', 'significantly', 'time', 'leave', 'room', 'Nicholson', 'comments', 'added', 'line', 'screenplay', ']', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Peploe', 'less', 'interesting.A', 'complex', 'thought-provoking', 'thriller', 're-established', 'Antonioni', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'critical', 'disaster', 'Zabriskie', 'Point']",N/A

That alone might not sound like much of an aesthetic but Antonioni is a master at using stark visuals to convey how each of his characters feel their particular brand of isolation. The opening sequence of Jack Nicholson driving his Land Rover first through a small village where he seeks directions from a villager then out into the wide open desert are perfectly paced and filmed and are a perfect introduction to this man who has dealt with his own failings at human contact by devoting himself to his career as international journalist. The opening scenes of this lone figure among villagers with whom he can not even speak and then against the backdrop of the biggest desert on the planet emphasize what a singular thing each life is. While in the desert Jack steps out of his Land Rover for an instant and watches a man on a camel pass by. The figure on the camel is an example of a man perfectly integrated with his surroundings. In contrast Jack, of course, is not. I have seen the film several times and am always impressed by the opening sequence. The rest of the film for me kind of drags. There are some great locations but the theme of isolation which is visually stated so clearly and impressively in the beginning of the film is just not one that allows for much elaboration. What drama there is happens in those first few moments and the rest of the picture is like one very long and drawn out denoument. Its certainly watchable but is probably Antonioni's least satisfying picture as its scope is so narrow. Even the presence of Maria Schneider fails to create much excitement. Shes an oddball and an interesting creature who is vital and curious and has her own perspective and she provides an interesting contrast to Jack Nicholsons character but even she cannot shake Jacks character out of his existential malaise/torpor/entropy. Antonioni is a master who didn't make very many films but I think I would recommend this only to people who are already Antonioni fans and like to see every work by a favorite director.

Unfortunately, that new role is tangled in more political tripwires than a moth in a spiderweb and he's almost immediately navigating some very tricky waters. Extremely vacant storytelling is the rule of the day here, with a Camus-like degree of passivity. In retrospect, or particularly during the great climax that closes the film, it becomes clear that there are a surprising number of independently moving pieces key to the plot. The problem is in how casually they sneak up on the viewer. For all its cinematic beauty, deep existential ruminations and whirling asides, this is a very dull, slow-moving picture that's painfully deliberate at times. That ultimately makes it inaccessible to most and largely unrewarding to those who stick with it to the end.

On one level it is about the literal danger in stealing someone else's identity. That premise alone presents numerous dramatic possibilities, but ""The Passenger"" goes much further, to become a haunting meditation on rootlessness and ennui. It examines the paradox of seemingly endless freedom gradually becoming a prison with only one means of escape.David Locke (Jack Nicholson, in one of his greatest performances), is a photojournalist working in North Africa. Out of nothing more than boredom, apparently, he steals the identity of a dead man, the only other guest in his hotel. The man, known only as Mr. Robertson, is barely known to Locke. They have had one conversation, and Robertson has said little more than that he is a businessman who travels all over the world and has no family.Once Locke becomes Robertson, he begins meeting the appointments in Robertson's datebook. It becomes his own personal Michelin guide and sends him all over Europe to gorgeous locations, filmed to their greatest advantage by Luciano Tovoli. In Munich, Locke learns that he is an arms dealer. But, as Jack Nicholson notes in his wry commentary on the DVD, ""at least he knows he's selling to the rebels.""Locke keeps all the appointments in the datebook, but the people he is supposed to meet abruptly stop showing up. He is mystified, confused, bewildered. There is trouble and fear in the silence that seems to meet him everywhere. Along the way he meets a young student, ""The Girl,"" played enigmatically by Maria Schneider. She speaks in epigrams, is intrigued by Locke and views the life he has adopted as something of a game.If we're not who we know ourselves to be, who are we? This is the question Antonioni repeatedly raises, and wisely never answers. One more than one occasion, Locke asks the girl, ""what the ---- are you doing here with me?"" Her first response is the most telling: ""which 'me'?"" Repeatedly he pushes her away, whether to protect her from himself, his alter ego or those who might be after either one of them, we can't say. But she remains cleverly steadfast.There is very little dialogue and not a great deal of action. But the feeling of menace and dread grows more powerful with each reel. And the payoff -- and it's a big one -- comes in the final seven minutes, with a single shot that is justifiably famous. It neatly ties up all the loose ends, although you may not realize it on first viewing. There are technical questions about how this shot was accomplished which the DVD commentaries answer. As with many scenes in many Antonioni movies, the final shot of ""The Passenger"" appears to say nothing while saying everything. It's just remarkable. No other word will do.I did not find screenwriter Mark Peploe's commentary to be particulary interesting. He talks too fast, he backtracks, he gets ahead of himself. He has a female friend with him who had no involvement in the film; she doesn't get the chance to say much and when she raises (good) questions, Peploe fails to answer them. I did not finish listening.Jack Nicholson's commentary -- which I believe he says is the first he's ever done for a DVD -- is quite good. He has owned the rights to ""The Passenger"" for many years, and it was his choice to re-release it to theatres in late 2005, and then to release it on DVD.  Nicholson takes a great deal of pride in having worked with Antonioni. (He remains the highest-caliber actor to have done so.) Jack sounds like he has one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel, but listen to the words. He's not intrusive, he chooses his words carefully, and he displays great intelligence and sly wit. It is he who says ""The Passenger"" is ""beautifully hypnotic"", and he is correct.",4,"""Beautifully hypnotic""",1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,3778,"['Michaelangelo', 'Antonioni', '1975', 'film', 'dreamlike', 'mysterious', 'one', 'level', 'literal', 'danger', 'stealing', 'someone', 'else', 'identity', 'premise', 'alone', 'presents', 'numerous', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'Passenger', 'much', 'further', 'become', 'haunting', 'meditation', 'rootlessness', 'ennui', 'paradox', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'freedom', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'prison', 'only', 'one', 'escape.David', 'Locke', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'photojournalist', 'working', 'North', 'Africa', 'Out', 'nothing', 'more', 'boredom', 'apparently', 'identity', 'dead', 'man', 'only', 'other', 'guest', 'hotel', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'Mr.', 'Robertson', 'barely', 'known', 'Locke', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'conversation', 'Robertson', 'said', 'little', 'more', 'businessman', 'who', 'world', 'family.Once', 'Locke', 'Robertson', 'meeting', 'appointments', 'Robertson', 'datebook', 'own', 'personal', 'Michelin', 'guide', 'Europe', 'gorgeous', 'locations', 'filmed', 'greatest', 'advantage', 'Luciano', 'Tovoli', 'Munich', 'Locke', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'notes', 'wry', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'least', 'selling', 'rebels', 'Locke', 'appointments', 'datebook', 'people', 'supposed', 'meet', 'abruptly', 'stop', 'showing', 'up', 'mystified', 'confused', 'bewildered', 'trouble', 'fear', 'silence', 'meet', 'everywhere', 'way', 'young', 'student', 'Girl', 'played', 'enigmatically', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'epigrams', 'intrigued', 'Locke', 'life', 'adopted', 'something', 'game.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'who', 'know', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'question', 'Antonioni', 'repeatedly', 'wisely', 'never', 'answers', 'One', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Locke', 'girl', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'first', 'response', 'most', 'telling', ""'me"", 'Repeatedly', 'away', 'protect', 'alter', 'ego', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'cleverly', 'steadfast.There', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'feeling', 'menace', 'dread', 'grows', 'more', 'powerful', 'reel', 'payoff', 'big', 'one', 'final', 'seven', 'minutes', 'single', 'shot', 'justifiably', 'famous', 'neatly', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'first', 'viewing', 'are', 'technical', 'questions', 'how', 'shot', 'was', 'accomplished', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'answer', 'many', 'scenes', 'many', 'Antonioni', 'movies', 'final', 'shot', 'Passenger', 'say', 'nothing', 'saying', 'everything', 'just', 'remarkable', 'other', 'word', 'will', 'do.I', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Peploe', 'commentary', 'be', 'particulary', 'interesting', 'too', 'fast', 'ahead', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'involvement', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'say', 'much', 'when', 'good', 'questions', 'Peploe', 'answer', 'did', 'not', 'finish', 'listening.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'commentary', 'believe', 'first', 'ever', 'done', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'owned', 'rights', 'Passenger', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'choice', 're-release', 'theatres', 'late', '2005', 'then', 'release', 'DVD', 'Nicholson', 'great', 'deal', 'pride', 'having', 'worked', 'Antonioni', 'highest-caliber', 'actor', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'Jack', 'one', 'foot', 'grave', 'other', 'banana', 'peel', 'words', 'not', 'intrusive', 'words', 'carefully', 'great', 'intelligence', 'sly', 'wit', 'who', 'Passenger', 'beautifully', 'hypnotic', 'correct']",N/A

That's saying plenty, and probably explains why the actor did his first solo commentary for the DVD. Nicholson clearly remains a disciple of his ""Passenger"" director.The actor frets about talking over some of the master's mysterioso scenes, apologizing for ""distracting"" viewers. No worries -- Nicholson is great company, of course, and his memories of making ""The Passenger"" are rich and fairly detailed.The restored ""Passenger"" made the rounds of art houses last fall. The film needs to be seen on a cinema screen but it's rewarding on DVD as well. Repeat viewings pay off as the movie reveals more of its secrets with every spin.A second commentary track comes from screenwriter Mark Peploe (""The Sheltering Sky""), who based the tale on his experiences as a docu maker. Peploe's talk drags at times, but if you want to dig into the movie he provides a lot of detail. The journalist who shares the track just saw the film for the first time and adds nothing.The remastered ""Passenger"" looks quite good for a 1970s movie, its images wear-free and mostly easy on the eyes -- a tad stringent or sun-bleached on occasion, probably by design. Images are widescreen, of course, enhanced for 16x9 monitors. The two-channel audio is good enough.",4,"""People disappear every day ...

239077,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,6300273369,Green Manalishi,"[2, 3]","It's hard to judge this movie.  It's meditative and windswept and transfers the feeling of traveling to remote places where you are an unknown amongst people you do not know.  Its premise was more intriguing than the actual experience of watching the story unfold however, which is slow indeed.  Being a traveler and amateur photography buff myself, I have great patience for looking at travel photos and find National Geographic magazine interesting, if not for the reading than at least for the photography of exotic places and the work of talented photographers.  My girlfriend however doesn't have that same love of pictures and won't spend much time critcally  analyzing what makes a picture good or bad..So how to judge this movie becomes the issue for me.  This is no high speed ride.  It's fine cinematography with a few shots that are probably more famous than the movie (she in back of the car as the trees go by her is an incredibly beautiful visual image).  The story again while conceptually interesting didn't go as deep for me as it seemed to for other reviewers.  While forgivable, I didn't find the scenes where Jack interacts with the arms buyers extremely likely - he obviously looked like he didn't know what was going on and I didn't wholly buy their complete oblivion to this..  I liked the girl.  She was a real work of art.  Her presence in the movie made about as much sense as anything else, but I was glad she was there.  It was a fun ""what if"" study.  What if a man went to the extreme of getting rid of his whole history in this way?  This idea is probably attractive to most people from time to time in their lives, so there's no question that the idea appeals.  The next question is would such a thing be possible, and would it play out something like the way it is depicted in ""The Passenger""?  My gut reation to that is probably ""no"".  But these are not the most important questions  - like one of the interviewees says to Jack when he asks him loaded questions before an interview.  The questions tell you more about the asker than the subject questioned.  For me, the question is what makes this a good movie?  Is it a good movie or a great movie?  The answer will depend on the criterion that you bring.If being intellectually or intuitionally intrigued is a condition for your idea of a great movie, then.. you will have to answer whether or not it does that for you.  For me, there were moments.  Definite moments.  There was always this kind of vast isolation, and mild uneasiness wrapped up in a sense of possibility that didn't seem likely to produce.  But the journey seemed a worthwhile one just for the sake of being what it was - an attempt to escape.  Chances are, our watching these movies is nothing less than that same urge, on some level.  Thus, the protagonists story has meaning and was worthwhile for me. Other things too, make it worthwhile.  Antonioni's rendering of the story - the scenery and some of the scenes were worthwhile.  One I liked - near the end, a little girl is casually blowing a bubble as Jack is walking by, and that pink bubble just gets bigger and bigger, but before it pops - the shot stops.  The concept of the movie, the subdued loveliness of the actress very much a part of the Spanish landscape, the moments of sparse dialogue where brilliance occasionally flashes through - I tip my hat to all these things - but what keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars is that it didn't succeed in helping ME escape.  And while the ending was fitting and somewhat ironic, it didn't blow me away content wise.  And let me also say that while there are some good shots in this movie camerawise, there are also many that go on long enough to test your endurance.  So much so, that I could go look outside my window for ten minutes and have a similar emotional reaction.  Not usually what I go to the movies for.  So, all things considered, the movie'll probably be even more interesting for viewers after they've seen it, should they care to think about it, rather than while they are undergoing the actual movie.",4,The Great Escape,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,4080,"['hard', 'judge', 'movie', 'meditative', 'windswept', 'feeling', 'traveling', 'remote', 'places', 'where', 'are', 'unknown', 'amongst', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'premise', 'was', 'more', 'intriguing', 'actual', 'experience', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'however', 'slow', 'indeed', 'Being', 'traveler', 'amateur', 'photography', 'buff', 'have', 'great', 'patience', 'looking', 'travel', 'photos', 'find', 'National', 'Geographic', 'magazine', 'interesting', 'not', 'reading', 'least', 'photography', 'exotic', 'places', 'work', 'talented', 'photographers', 'girlfriend', 'however', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'love', 'pictures', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'critcally', 'analyzing', 'what', 'picture', 'good', 'bad..So', 'how', 'judge', 'movie', 'issue', 'high', 'speed', 'ride', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'few', 'shots', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'famous', 'movie', 'back', 'car', 'trees', 'go', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'image', 'story', 'again', 'conceptually', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'deep', 'seemed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'forgivable', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jack', 'arms', 'buyers', 'extremely', 'likely', 'obviously', 'looked', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'buy', 'complete', 'oblivion', 'this..', 'liked', 'girl', 'was', 'real', 'work', 'art', 'presence', 'movie', 'made', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'fun', 'what', 'study', 'What', 'man', 'went', 'extreme', 'getting', 'rid', 'whole', 'history', 'way', 'idea', 'probably', 'attractive', 'most', 'people', 'time', 'time', 'lives', 'question', 'idea', 'appeals', 'next', 'question', 'would', 'such', 'thing', 'be', 'possible', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'something', 'way', 'depicted', 'Passenger', 'gut', 'reation', 'probably', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'important', 'questions', 'one', 'interviewees', 'Jack', 'when', 'loaded', 'questions', 'interview', 'questions', 'tell', 'more', 'asker', 'subject', 'questioned', 'question', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'answer', 'will', 'depend', 'criterion', 'bring.If', 'being', 'intellectually', 'intuitionally', 'intrigued', 'condition', 'idea', 'great', 'movie', 'then..', 'will', 'have', 'answer', 'not', 'were', 'moments', 'Definite', 'moments', 'was', 'always', 'kind', 'vast', 'isolation', 'mild', 'uneasiness', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sense', 'possibility', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'produce', 'journey', 'seemed', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'what', 'was', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Chances', 'are', 'watching', 'movies', 'nothing', 'less', 'same', 'urge', 'level', 'Thus', 'protagonists', 'story', 'meaning', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'Other', 'things', 'too', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'Antonioni', 'rendering', 'story', 'scenery', 'scenes', 'were', 'worthwhile', 'One', 'liked', 'end', 'little', 'girl', 'casually', 'blowing', 'bubble', 'Jack', 'walking', 'pink', 'bubble', 'just', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'shot', 'stops', 'concept', 'movie', 'subdued', 'loveliness', 'actress', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'Spanish', 'landscape', 'moments', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'where', 'brilliance', 'occasionally', 'tip', 'hat', 'things', 'what', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'helping', 'ME', 'escape', 'ending', 'was', 'fitting', 'somewhat', 'ironic', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'content', 'wise', 'let', 'also', 'say', 'are', 'good', 'shots', 'movie', 'camerawise', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'go', 'long', 'enough', 'test', 'endurance', 'So', 'much', 'could', 'go', 'look', 'outside', 'window', 'ten', 'minutes', 'have', 'similar', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'Not', 'usually', 'what', 'go', 'movies', 'So', 'things', 'considered', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'should', 'care', 'think', 'rather', 'are', 'undergoing', 'actual', 'movie']",N/A

Billed as an international romantic thriller, it is actually more of a psychological study.  Antonioni's films dealt with the themes of internal emptiness, and search for purpose.  As such, they were often slow-moving.  To its credit, The Passenger features more of a consistent plot.  Jack Nicholson plays a tired, burned-out journalist, disaffected with his career, and hoping for something more meaningful.  When presented with an opportunity, he exchanges his identity for that of a dead man, only to become caught up in a sequence of events he cannot control.  Temporarily free of his earlier life, he makes no effort to build a new one.  Undercut by his own indecisiveness, he is unable to create his own sense of purpose.  Confronted with new options and facing very real dangers, he does not rise to the occasion, but remains curiously passive, allowing himself to be swept along by outside forces.

It was the last film on an MGM contract that Antonioni signed with Carlo Ponti for 3 films.  The films were Blow Up (major success), and Zabriskie Point (notorious bomb, at least financially).  This is arguably Antonioni's best film, with one of Jack Nicholson's greatest performances.  The film has been out of circulation for years, but recently was restored and released on DVD in a slightly longer version than the one that played on its initial theatrical run.  Nicholson himself actually owned the rights to the film, and lovingly took care of it for all those years.  Nicholson has said that he held Antonioni (and Kubrick) in deep respect, and Nicholson isn't easy to please.  He's one of the greatest actors ever, and he wants to work with great directors (like all great actors).  This film is really quite stunning, with some gorgeous cinematography (by Luciano Tovoli), great performances, some humour (especially for an Antonioni film), tension, romance (a real one), and it has one of the greatest shots in the history of cinema.  The final shot is a masterful long take, one of the greatest in cinema history.  The film was originally titled Profession:  Reporter, but the American distributor retitled it The Passenger.  Normally, when an American studio/distributor retitles something, it's for the worst.  Not here.  The Passenger is a much more puzzling, ambiguous title, and it works very well.

I notice that most of the interpretations/reviews (outside of Amazon) have been by male reviewers.  Perhaps they didn't ""get"" the subtleties that to me, a woman, seem rather obvious.  First off: the ""Passenger"" is symbolized by Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider (who passed away recently, RIP Maria, you were exquisite in this film).  Nicholson is the ""passenger"" of life, buffeted this way and that, a nomad, suddenly taking a doomed detour.  Schneider is his literal passenger riding with him to his end (and setting up much of the transportation, in case you didn't notice).  If you watch the ending closely, you will see that Schneider, lingering in the courtyard as Nicholson naps in his (separate) room, is approached by men we know to be foreign national thugs who have come for him, probably to kill him before he can create an international scandal for their (African) country.  Nicholson, as the imposter, is now an embarrassment for the country's ruler, who wants to quell all rumors that the guerillas are still a threat to him. Therefore, Nicholson, a famous journalist who may or may not know too much, must be eliminated.  When the men surround Schneider, you at first think they might harm her, or force her to take them to Nicholson's room.  However, she subtly points to the front office and keeps walking around the courtyard, seemingly unphased by what has just occurred.  Then she sort of wanders off as if uninterested in Nicholson or the men she must know have come for him (since the pair has been on the run from these thugs since she met him).  Shortly thereafter, Nicholson's wife and Barcelona authorities arrive and break into his room, only to find him dead on his bed, just as he found the man whose identity he has assumed.  Maria Schneider suddenly wanders in, and views the body with Nicholson's widow.  Both women disavow him.  His wife shakes her head: it's not him. (Better to let him have died, uneventfully, in Africa, than in this strange and disturbing setting and manner).  Schneider says ""I never knew him,"" which, to some degree, is true.

239082,A9I40WFF40R4,6300273369,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[3, 3]","Michelangelo Antonioni's 1975 film ""The Passenger"" is set in North Africa, London and Barcelona where the Gaudi architecture alone would make the film worth seeing. Gaudi's work complements this exotic movie where things are seldom what they seem to be. A very young and slim Jack Nicholson is cast as David Locke, a British journalist who was educated in the United states-- hence no need for a British accent-- who is covering a war in Africa. While on assignment, he discovers the dead body of David Robertson, someone whom he resembles, and decides to take on the dead man's identity.Nicholson gives a fine understated performance and only once ventures into the character that we now expect from him where his temper flares and proverbial heads roll. The scene occurs early in the film when, out of frustration, he attacks his vehicle stuck in the desert sand with a shovel. This is obviously Nicholson before ""Five Easy Pieces,"" etc. It becomes obvious early on that this film is a director's rather than an actor's; Antonioni is in full control. There are beautiful images repeated, enough to satisfy the most pretentious of us. (For example, Nicholson stretches out his arms over Barcelona and a similar scene takes place when he and Maria Schneider are later riding in a convertible on a highway in Spain when she asks him what is he running from.) About Ms. Schneider-- she appears for all the world to have wandered in on this set from ""Last Tango In Paris,"" having swapped one leading man for another. She plays the same sometimes sullen, often pouting, mumbling character as in the previous film. Are we to assume that this is the only role she can play?Included on the DVD version is Nicholson's commentary on the film. He describes making this movie as ""probably the biggest adventure of filming in my life,"" no small compliment to the director since Mr. Nicholson, for my money, is one of our best living actors and has created many memorable characters during his long career. One final word: the ending of this film is as suspenseful and effective as any you will ever see as well as  ingeniously filmed.",4,I'd Give This Movie a B+,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,2122,"['Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', '1975', 'film', 'Passenger', 'set', 'North', 'Africa', 'London', 'Barcelona', 'where', 'Gaudi', 'architecture', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'Gaudi', 'work', 'complements', 'exotic', 'movie', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'seldom', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'young', 'slim', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'cast', 'David', 'Locke', 'British', 'journalist', 'who', 'was', 'educated', 'United', 'states', 'hence', 'need', 'British', 'accent', 'who', 'covering', 'war', 'Africa', 'assignment', 'dead', 'body', 'David', 'Robertson', 'someone', 'whom', 'take', 'dead', 'man', 'identity.Nicholson', 'fine', 'understated', 'performance', 'only', 'once', 'ventures', 'character', 'now', 'expect', 'where', 'temper', 'flares', 'proverbial', 'heads', 'roll', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'frustration', 'vehicle', 'stuck', 'desert', 'sand', 'shovel', 'obviously', 'Nicholson', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'etc', 'obvious', 'early', 'film', 'director', 'rather', 'actor', 'Antonioni', 'full', 'control', 'are', 'beautiful', 'images', 'repeated', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'most', 'pretentious', 'example', 'Nicholson', 'out', 'arms', 'Barcelona', 'similar', 'scene', 'place', 'when', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'are', 'later', 'riding', 'convertible', 'highway', 'Spain', 'when', 'what', 'running', 'Ms.', 'Schneider', 'world', 'have', 'wandered', 'set', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'having', 'swapped', 'one', 'leading', 'man', 'same', 'sometimes', 'sullen', 'often', 'pouting', 'mumbling', 'character', 'previous', 'film', 'Are', 'assume', 'only', 'role', 'can', 'play', 'Included', 'DVD', 'version', 'Nicholson', 'commentary', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'probably', 'biggest', 'adventure', 'filming', 'life', 'small', 'compliment', 'director', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', 'money', 'one', 'best', 'living', 'actors', 'created', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'long', 'career', 'One', 'final', 'word', 'ending', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'effective', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'ingeniously', 'filmed']",N/A

Antonioni made a powerful portrait around the life of a man bored of being himself decides to live another life. In this state of things he will experience multiple issues derived from this decision.Somehow you must be involved with the essential roots of the Existentialism Literature Movement and having read at least three fundamentals books: Albert Camus' The Stranger and Sartre' s The wall  and The word. So having put in context the fundamental basis it will be easier to come to the dramatic core.And thanks to that advise you'll understand why Antonioni maintains almost twelve minutes the camera absolutely quiet in the middle of the desert .To my mind this film meant for Nicholson the definitive jump as actor , facing and winning with this unusual performance and excellent film leaving the normal critics of peaceful movie and extremely slow script.Remember you will initiate a weird journey with the master of the silence: Michelangelo Antonioni.",5,The futility of the existence!,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1560,"['story', 'Cinema', 'may', 'count', 'fingers', 'two', 'hands', 'films', 'have', 'focused', 'so', 'artistic', 'commitment', 'level', 'ontological', 'loneliness', 'loneliness', 'oppression', 'existence', 's', 'lack', 'sense', 'first', 'glance', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Seventh', 'seal', 'Winter', 'light', 'Silence', 'Louis', 'Malle', 's', 'Fire', 'Polanski', 'Repulsion', 'Bertolucci', 'last', 'Tango', 'Fassbinder', 'Desperation', 'Antonioni', 'Adventure', 'one.So', 'consider', 'are', 'hostile', 'merciless', 'unscrupulous', 'movie', 'who', 'will', 'show', 'last', 'frontier', 'waste', 'land', 'human', 'mind', 'Antonioni', 'made', 'powerful', 'portrait', 'life', 'man', 'bored', 'being', 'live', 'life', 'state', 'things', 'will', 'experience', 'multiple', 'issues', 'derived', 'decision.Somehow', 'must', 'be', 'involved', 'essential', 'roots', 'Existentialism', 'Literature', 'Movement', 'having', 'read', 'least', 'three', 'fundamentals', 'books', 'Albert', 'Camus', 'Stranger', 'Sartre', 's', 'wall', 'word', 'So', 'having', 'put', 'context', 'fundamental', 'basis', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'come', 'dramatic', 'core.And', 'thanks', 'advise', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'Antonioni', 'almost', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'camera', 'absolutely', 'quiet', 'middle', 'desert', '.To', 'mind', 'film', 'meant', 'Nicholson', 'definitive', 'jump', 'actor', 'facing', 'winning', 'unusual', 'performance', 'excellent', 'film', 'leaving', 'normal', 'critics', 'peaceful', 'movie', 'extremely', 'slow', 'script.Remember', 'will', 'initiate', 'weird', 'journey', 'master', 'silence', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni']",N/A

His mixed up mid Atlantic origins, failing marriage and dissatisfaction with his work come to a head in a small hotel in an obscure town in a war torn African country. The only other guest is the enigmatic business man Mr Robertson who confesses to having no family or friends only a list of appointments. The mid-life crisis fantasy turns into reality for Locke when Robertson dies from a heart attack. Locke switches passport photos, assumes the other man's identity and heads off to keep the apointments.The list of apointments in the dead man's diary lead Locke on a journey across Europe. He is pursued by a team of assassins who, believing him to be the real Mr Robertson, want to kill the man selling guns to the rebels in their country. Also on the trail are the police together with his wife who is the only other person in the film to have realised the identity swap. Despite the state of her marriage, (she has taken a lover) she still  cares about him and wants to warn about the danger that he faces.No mid life crisis film would be complete without the younger woman with beautiful eyes and no past herself who falls for the leading man. Maria Schneider plays this role very well providing both an innocent acceptance and a sophisticated understanding of Locke's game.Very few actors could have played the part of Locke as well as Nicholson. He brings an air of detachment to the part that fits in with the character's behaviour. He is taking part in another man's life but as a spectator.As well as the storyline, the film is shot with the artistic poise and exquisite technique that I always enjoy when I see the work of director Antonioni. From the scenes in the African dessert to the final moments in a small sun baked Spanish town, the film is a joy to view. At the end of the film comes one single camera shot that is quite magical. The scene starts in Nicholson's hotel room and slowly homes in on the barred window. We zoom towards the window and then fly out through the bars into the square outside. Then slowly, the camera, now clearly on the other side of the bars pans around the square before returning to view the window from the outside. At the time, this was the longest and technically the most demanding camera shot ever attempted.",5,One of the best films ever made.,1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,2353,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'David', 'Locke', 'successful', 'jaded', 'reporter', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'mixed', 'up', 'mid', 'Atlantic', 'origins', 'failing', 'marriage', 'dissatisfaction', 'work', 'come', 'head', 'small', 'hotel', 'obscure', 'town', 'war', 'torn', 'African', 'country', 'only', 'other', 'guest', 'enigmatic', 'business', 'man', 'Mr', 'Robertson', 'who', 'having', 'family', 'only', 'list', 'appointments', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'Locke', 'when', 'Robertson', 'heart', 'attack', 'Locke', 'passport', 'photos', 'other', 'man', 'identity', 'heads', 'keep', 'apointments.The', 'list', 'apointments', 'dead', 'man', 'diary', 'lead', 'Locke', 'journey', 'Europe', 'pursued', 'team', 'assassins', 'who', 'believing', 'be', 'real', 'Mr', 'Robertson', 'want', 'kill', 'man', 'selling', 'guns', 'rebels', 'country', 'Also', 'trail', 'are', 'police', 'together', 'wife', 'who', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'film', 'have', 'realised', 'identity', 'swap', 'state', 'marriage', 'taken', 'lover', 'still', 'warn', 'danger', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'younger', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'past', 'herself', 'who', 'leading', 'man', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'providing', 'innocent', 'acceptance', 'sophisticated', 'understanding', 'Locke', 'game.Very', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'Locke', 'as', 'well', 'Nicholson', 'air', 'detachment', 'part', 'character', 'behaviour', 'taking', 'part', 'man', 'life', 'spectator.As', 'well', 'storyline', 'film', 'shot', 'artistic', 'poise', 'exquisite', 'technique', 'always', 'enjoy', 'when', 'see', 'work', 'director', 'Antonioni', 'scenes', 'African', 'dessert', 'final', 'moments', 'small', 'sun', 'baked', 'Spanish', 'town', 'film', 'joy', 'view', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'single', 'camera', 'shot', 'quite', 'magical', 'scene', 'Nicholson', 'hotel', 'room', 'slowly', 'homes', 'barred', 'window', 'zoom', 'window', 'then', 'fly', 'out', 'bars', 'square', 'outside', 'Then', 'slowly', 'camera', 'now', 'clearly', 'other', 'side', 'bars', 'square', 'returning', 'view', 'window', 'outside', 'time', 'was', 'longest', 'technically', 'most', 'demanding', 'camera', 'shot', 'ever', 'attempted']",N/A
239085,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300273369,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","""The Passenger"" is a lost film by legendary director Michelangelo Antonioni. I had never heard of this move until it was issued on DVD not two months ago, but was drawn to it because Jack Nicholson was in it. It's in own odd way, ""The Passenger"" is surreal, hypnotic, and truly a beautiful movie. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performance, Maria Schneider (has she made anything besides this and ""Last Tango in Paris"") is great. This movie manages to entertain even during points where there a long gaps without dialogue. The movie begins with a journalist named David Locke (Nicholson) who's somewhere in Africa, at a cheap motel. At the motel he meets a man named David Robertson and a while later finds the man dead from a heart attack. Locke is burned out with his journalism and decides to steal the man's identity; he switches the pictures on the passports and takes the man's belongings. Turns out, Robertson was a gun-runner so Locke begins to follow suit. Schneider appears in the film early on for a few minutes, but doesn't really enter the movie as a character until about an hour or so in. Schneider's character doesn't have a name either, she's merely Girl. As some colleagues of Locke's await to recieve his belongings, Locke begins running from a man who knows him but doesn't know that Robertson is him. He also meets the Girl and falls for her. The movie, make no mistake, moves at a slow pace and it's not a movie for everybody. This is a movie that's directed more towards film buffs and people who actually know who Maria Schneider is. This film is a masterpiece and I'm happy it's been released on DVD. I recommend it, if you're capable of sitting through slow-paced movies; Movies that many people would call dull.GRADE: A-",5,Surreal & Hypnotic,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1753,"['Passenger', 'lost', 'film', 'legendary', 'director', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'move', 'was', 'issued', 'DVD', 'not', 'two', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'drawn', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'own', 'odd', 'way', 'Passenger', 'surreal', 'hypnotic', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'best', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'made', 'anything', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'great', 'movie', 'entertain', 'even', 'points', 'where', 'long', 'gaps', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'journalist', 'named', 'David', 'Locke', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'somewhere', 'Africa', 'cheap', 'motel', 'motel', 'man', 'named', 'David', 'Robertson', 'while', 'later', 'man', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'Locke', 'burned', 'out', 'journalism', 'decides', 'steal', 'man', 'identity', 'pictures', 'passports', 'man', 'belongings', 'out', 'Robertson', 'was', 'gun-runner', 'so', 'Locke', 'follow', 'suit', 'Schneider', 'film', 'early', 'few', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'really', 'enter', 'movie', 'character', 'hour', 'so', 'Schneider', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'name', 'either', 'merely', 'Girl', 'colleagues', 'Locke', 'await', 'recieve', 'belongings', 'Locke', 'running', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Robertson', 'also', 'Girl', 'movie', 'make', 'mistake', 'moves', 'slow', 'pace', 'not', 'movie', 'everybody', 'movie', 'directed', 'more', 'towards', 'film', 'buffs', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'know', 'who', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'film', 'masterpiece', ""'m"", 'happy', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'capable', 'sitting', 'slow-paced', 'movies', 'Movies', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'call', 'dull.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Nicholson plays a disillusioned, depressed reporter who switches identity with a dead man in hopes of freeing himself from his old life. But life follows anyway, in the form of his wife and producer, who want to find out what happened to him, and the men who knew the arms dealer that Nicholson has now unwittingly become. Along the way he falls in like with Maria Schnider as a young woman who seems lost herself, and who seems to be using Jack's journey to give her own life meaning.Nicholson is lower key than usual, and very, very good; by far the most human of all Antononi's leads. His accessibility makes the film easier and more fun than most of Antonioni's movies, but somehow there's a lack of depth and resonance of the earlier, more obtuse Antonioni films. (And still that penchant for stilted, weighty dialogue).It's not as amazingly shot as most of the earlier films, except for a shot near the end that's one of the mot amazing 'how did they...?' shots I've ever seen.If Schnieder could act this might well have been a truly great film, but she's so wooden, especially next to Nicholson's humanity, that the central relationship doesn't carry the weight it should (and I don't buy that it's intentional).All in all a very worthwhile, watchable film, but frustratingly seems to just miss being a true masterpiece.",4,"A very strong film, on the edge of brilliance",1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1460,"['More', 'accessible', 'less', 'mysterious', 'other', 'widely', 'known', 'Antonioni', 'movies', 'more', 'plot', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Nicholson', 'disillusioned', 'depressed', 'reporter', 'who', 'identity', 'dead', 'man', 'hopes', 'freeing', 'old', 'life', 'life', 'anyway', 'form', 'wife', 'producer', 'who', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'men', 'who', 'knew', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Nicholson', 'now', 'unwittingly', 'become', 'way', 'Maria', 'Schnider', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'who', 'be', 'using', 'Jack', 'journey', 'give', 'own', 'life', 'meaning.Nicholson', 'lower', 'key', 'usual', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'far', 'most', 'human', 'Antononi', 'leads', 'accessibility', 'film', 'easier', 'more', 'fun', 'most', 'Antonioni', 'movies', 'somehow', 'lack', 'depth', 'resonance', 'earlier', 'more', 'Antonioni', 'films', 'still', 'penchant', 'stilted', 'weighty', 'dialogue', '.It', 'not', 'amazingly', 'shot', 'most', 'earlier', 'films', 'shot', 'end', 'one', 'mot', 'amazing', ""'how"", 'did', 'shots', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.If', 'Schnieder', 'could', 'act', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'wooden', 'especially', 'next', 'Nicholson', 'humanity', 'central', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'should', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'intentional', '.All', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'watchable', 'film', 'frustratingly', 'just', 'miss', 'being', 'true', 'masterpiece']",N/A
239088,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6300273369,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[74, 83]","Unlike Antonioni's two attempts at capturing the personal alienation brought about by the cultural changes of the 60s--Zabriskie Point and Blow-Up--The Passenger is a signficantly more grounded film that focuses as well on alienation, but uses a diversity of foreign cultures to underline one man's alienation from life regardless of location.The two films prior to The Passenger, also set outside the director's native country, but now obviously dated, tried using specific individual cultural settings (America and England) to highlight the emptiness of human behavior in the face of shallow cultural values.  The Passenger is a decidedly more timeless film because instead of focusing on a specific culture, it wisely focuses on an individual, a globe-trotting reporter, whose own focus is on war and revolution in third world nations.David Locke begins to grow weary of his life that constantly exposes him to the negative forces between and within nations all too common in today's world (another reason this film is still tremendously fresh and powerful today).  When another man with a similar appearance suddenly dies in a small remote African village hotel Locke himself is staying in, he assumes the other man's (Robertson's) identity and follows an international trail to keep the appointments in Robertson's little black book. This takes him from Africa to Germany to Spain.Without giving too much away here, it becomes all too clear that Locke--now Robertson--wants to escape himself.  Antonioni, in collaboration with brilliant scripter Mark Peploe, moves us with Locke/Robertson from place to place as he blindly follows his nose, or, more accurately, runs from other noses following him--one of which is his own.  Another of them belongs to his wife who begins to believe her husband is still alive somewhere.  Still others are those of the police.  But the most dangerous noses are those of some of the same people Locke, while a reporter, passively interviewed.  Now, as Robertson, his role is not so passive anymore.In his haste to escape, Locke finds that Robertson was involved in a dangerous business that could result in the ultimate escape. This is a great film that fuses thriller elements with drama that penetrates because we see and understand what Locke thinks and does.  Jack Nicholson's portrait of the escapee is right on the money; he sounds, at least half the time, as though he's not really sure that what he's saying is true, or that he can believe it--exactly what someone running from himself would sound like.Antonioni emphasizes the isolation of people from each other in interesting visual ways.  He often shoots scenes with the camera at a noticeable distance from the actors; we are physically removed from the action, and with this distance, there is the distinct feeling of what we see as observers being not really action, but a kind of indistinct or unclear version of action.  As well, the camera intermittently closes up on Locke when he is doing nothing, or waiting, or is stuck in a rut (literally, in a sand rut when his vehicle is snagged in the African desert).  These close-ups are a very effective counerpart to the distance shots; the first removes us from what could possibly be critical action, and the second hits us in the face with the opposite.A real shame this is not on DVD.

Either the print or projection was awful while the sound system just plain stunk!This new DVD edition has the ""feel"" of age (I could never understand why Antonioni used dark titles, same as on his Blow-Up) but is nonetheless very watchable (and listenable!) with brilliant color saturation and nary a noticeable scratch.Needless to say, a keen sense of ""place"" and the emotional ""distance"" we keep from protagonist/reporter David Locke (Jack Nicholson) amidst his developing boredom and burn-out are brilliantly rendered through Antonioni's trademark cinematic sensibility.  We see and feel Locke's need for change and are held rapt as he carries out his impromptu plan for self-reinvention.  In my opinion, this consistent theme of Antonioni's is as well-performed and technically executed as in any of his films.From the North African desert to London to Germany and finally to Spain, Locke embraces his newfound identity through unintended political intrigue and a search by his wife and former colleague (who believe his former self to be dead!) while sharing his exploit with a young fellow soulmate and nameless lover (Maria Schneider).  The trip is both fascinating and spellbinding.The denouement is something to behold, not only from a technical standpoint (which is extraordinary!) but from the sheer emotional dispatch we feel upon Locke's ultimate realization. The slowly diminishing ""distance"" from him we were feeling to that point utterly collapses!  We're left feeling strangely as one with Locke, but more detached than ever from a mostly inert and indifferent world.Any fan of Antonioni's renowned Italian trilogy (L'avventura, La Notte, and L'eclisse) or his wonderfully enigmatic English language masterpiece Blow-Up will certainly enjoy this.  I also wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Passenger to the Antonioni uninitiate who wants a more accessible entry in which to explore a unique cinematic vision and language.  Though I've yet to hear the commentary track from the screenwriter Mark Peploe and journalist Aurora Irvine, that of the seemingly world-weary yet self-satisfied modern-day Jack Nicholson was fun to hear if not overly insightful.One of these days I may just give Antonioni's much maligned Zabriskie Point a ""second chance""...one of these days.",5,Book Passage On This Unique Trip,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,2616,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'give', 'Passenger', 'second', 'chance', 'first', 'seeing', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'screening', 'now', 'long-defunct', 'local', 'film', 'society', 'rustic', 'decades-old', 'Footliters', 'Theater', 'downtown', 'Cadillac', 'Michigan', 'erstwhile', 'venue', 'local', 'community', 'theater', 'troupe', 'lost', 'electrical', 'fire', 'print', 'projection', 'was', 'awful', 'sound', 'system', 'just', 'plain', 'stunk', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', 'feel', 'age', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'Antonioni', 'used', 'dark', 'titles', 'same', 'Blow-Up', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'watchable', 'listenable', 'brilliant', 'color', 'saturation', 'nary', 'noticeable', 'scratch.Needless', 'say', 'keen', 'sense', 'place', 'emotional', 'distance', 'keep', 'protagonist/reporter', 'David', 'Locke', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'amidst', 'developing', 'boredom', 'burn-out', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'rendered', 'Antonioni', 'trademark', 'cinematic', 'sensibility', 'see', 'feel', 'Locke', 'need', 'change', 'are', 'held', 'rapt', 'out', 'impromptu', 'plan', 'self-reinvention', 'opinion', 'consistent', 'theme', 'Antonioni', 'well-performed', 'technically', 'executed', 'films.From', 'North', 'African', 'desert', 'London', 'Germany', 'finally', 'Spain', 'Locke', 'newfound', 'identity', 'unintended', 'political', 'intrigue', 'search', 'wife', 'former', 'colleague', 'who', 'believe', 'former', 'self', 'be', 'dead', 'sharing', 'exploit', 'young', 'fellow', 'soulmate', 'nameless', 'lover', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'trip', 'fascinating', 'spellbinding.The', 'denouement', 'something', 'behold', 'not', 'only', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'extraordinary', 'sheer', 'emotional', 'dispatch', 'feel', 'Locke', 'ultimate', 'realization', 'slowly', 'diminishing', 'distance', 'were', 'feeling', 'point', 'utterly', 'collapses', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'strangely', 'one', 'Locke', 'more', 'detached', 'ever', 'mostly', 'inert', 'indifferent', 'world.Any', 'fan', 'Antonioni', 'renowned', 'Italian', 'trilogy', ""L'avventura"", 'La', 'Notte', ""L'eclisse"", 'wonderfully', 'enigmatic', 'English', 'language', 'masterpiece', 'Blow-Up', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'Passenger', 'Antonioni', 'uninitiate', 'who', 'more', 'accessible', 'entry', 'explore', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'language', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'hear', 'commentary', 'track', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Peploe', 'journalist', 'Aurora', 'Irvine', 'seemingly', 'world-weary', 'yet', 'self-satisfied', 'modern-day', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'fun', 'hear', 'not', 'overly', 'insightful.One', 'days', 'may', 'just', 'give', 'Antonioni', 'much', 'maligned', 'Zabriskie', 'Point', 'second', 'chance', 'one', 'days']",N/A

Maybe there's nothing wrong with liking a film for how it looks.The story is quite good--better than most of A's stories.  A man, tired of his life, grabs a chance to be someone else and then discovers that he can't escape himself after all.  It's a good theme, worthy of exploring and A. does it masterfully.  The title, The Passenger, reminded me of Camus' short novel, The Stranger.  Both ""heros"" are basically observers, unable to connect meaningfully with life.  The Stranger takes place in Northern Africa, too, and again we see a European searching for something in a culture that's very different from his own.A young, trim Jack Nicholson is a pleasure to watch and Maria Schneider is appropriately mysterious and appealing at the Girl.  She delivers her lines badly but that adds, maybe to the foreign feeling of the film.Mostly it's a mood that Antonioni spells...it's almost as if he is a musician and you leave the theater with the tune stuck in your mind, playing over and over.

The movie's not really a thriller or a mystery, but rather an excuse for Antonioni to explore his favorite themes of identity and the difficulty of meaningful engagement with others and with the meaning of life itself.Mood and atmosphere dominate in wonderfully composed images and set pieces.  A charismatic, petulant, luminous Schneider again holds the eye of the viewer in every scene in which she appears.THE PASSENGER sealed Schneider's international fame.  Not long afterwards, she abandoned a film set and checked into a mental hospital in Rome (1975).  In 2007, she recalled: ""[the glare of the spotlight] made me go mad.  I got into drugs - pot and then cocaine, LSD and heroine - it was like an escape from reality. I took pills and tried to commit suicide, but I survived because God decided it wasn't time for me to go.""Maria Schneider worked steadily and acted in over 50 movies as a featured player or star.  Some of her more obscure but interesting films  are: THE KEY (2007), THE REPENTANT (2002), JANE EYRE (1996), THE CONVICTION (1991), THE PRINCESS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER (1984), LOOKING FOR JESUS (1982), MAMA DRACULA (1980), MEMOIRS OF A FRENCH WHORE (1979).On February 3, 2011, Marie Christine G&eacute;lin, aka Maria Schneider, died in Paris after a long battle with cancer.

His films had a reputation of good cinematography.  Zabriskie Point (in Death Valley) is one such film.  The Passenger is another.Jack Nicholson is very good as David Locke, a journalist who is hanging around with another foreigner, David Robertson, in Africa.  Locke is a journalist, but not a terribly successful one, or maybe it's just bad luck.  In any case, his buddy David and he are staying in the only hotel in town, and it's not much.  Nicholson starts to draw a bath after a stint out in the desert, trying to interview some members of warring faction.  He calls after his friend, and, getting no reaction, checks on him, and finds him dead.On what seems like somewhat of a lark, Locke decides to assume Robertson's identity.  As long as no one checks too closely, he can take over Robertson's life, by following notebook entries.  It predictably leads to trouble, as Robertson turns out to have somewhat of a dangerous avocation.  He meets and then hooks up with a young girl played by Maria Schneider.In addition to the acting, the film has great appeal with the look.  The vast, almost trackless desert of Africa at the beginning of the film, exteriors in a relatively lush Germany, and, perhaps most impressive of all, small-town Spain.  The film ends on an eight minute shot starting in Locke's hotel room, slowly moving out to take in the exterior of the hotel.  I'm not sure how he did the shot, as there is a large grate over the full-length window in the room.  The camera ends up outside the hotel, somehow moving right through the grate, and turns around at the hotel the camera just came from.  It's all one continuous take.

239099,A1DHFQP9G5F7LY,6300273369,Stephen C. Bird,"[1, 1]","With ""The Passenger"", Michaelangelo Antonioni reinvented himself as a filmmaker.  For some reason, that remains mysterious, the character of David Locke (Jack Nicholson) decides to take the risk of assuming the identity of David Robertson.  In Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"", the disillusioned character of Anna disappears;  in ""The Passenger"", Locke attempts to vanish by becoming Robertson; the common thread between the two films being the reaction to the disappearance and / or death of those characters.  Locke is a man who has become detached, in part because he's a globe-trotting journalist.  Yet other questions remain: Has Locke decided to ""fall through the cracks"" just because he likes the excitement of dangerous living?  Or does he somehow feel deep down that no-one cares about him?  Or maybe both .......... ?For Jack Nicholson as David Locke, this is one of several compelling roles he undertook in the 1970s. As for the female lead, Maria Schneider--first of all, I'm sorry that she is no longer with us.  As for her character in ""The Passenger"" (The Girl)--she has an interesting presence as an ""amoral-pseudo-double agent""--but I can't truly call hers a great performance, as it is difficult for me to discern whether her quality of laid-back apathy that she projects is a part of her character, or merely an aspect of her personality.  Her line readings sometimes border on the mechanical.  [What was she on?  It was the Seventies, after all.]  In any case--her presence conforms well with the tone of this film.  As for the penultimate scene that is filmed in one take--Several other Amazon reviewers have already deconstructed it in other reviews of this DVD, so I won't repeat that process.  This picture reaches its fatalistic conclusion quietly; the ending could even be considered to be ""creepy"".  In a perverse way this film has the atmosphere of a European / Mediterranean vacation--on the surface there's a hazy yet idyllic ambiance, while underneath a much grimmer reality unfolds.This picture has some of the mid-1970s-post-Watergate paranoia-influenced qualities of Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" and Alan J. Pakula's ""The Parallax View"", both of which were released in 1974 (according to Wikipedia, Coppola had been influenced by Antonioni's ""Blow Up"").  Like ""The Parallax View"", this film also features a hunted man.  In Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"" (many have panned that film, but I'm a fan)--the Death Valley / desert scenes are among its most memorable.  Antonioni once again returns to a desert locale in ""The Passenger""; the desert works effectively as a metaphor for Antonioni's usage of / interest in / obsession with .......... silence / desolation / bleak reality.  In closing--for foreign language buffs, this DVD features subtitles in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Thai--the Spanish subtitles complement the scenes filmed in Barcelona, as well as those filmed further south in Spain.Stephen C.

Somehow he loses the trail and himself in the endless rolling sand dunes and ""stillness"" of the desert that's like ""a kind of waiting."" Locke is weary, impatient, disillusioned and tired of ""waiting"", preferring ""men to landscapes"" and when a fellow traveler in the hotel room adjacent his has a heart attack and dies, Locke seizes the opportunity to reinvent himself by literally stepping into the shoes of another. Who was this man Robinson? What did he believe in? Ironically the answer is tied to the search initiated by Locke at the beginning of the film. Of course he has no way of knowing this and must travel this fatalistic journey in which there are no coincidences. Director Antonioni has patience enough to listen to the wind, an omnipresent presence that seems to mock the urgency of man. With visual acuity he shows us the marvelous architectural wonders of Gaudi, and other places of refuge where man can hide from man but ultimately can never escape himself or the ever persistent question: ""What are you running away from?"" Jack Nicholson's portrayal of David Locke is brilliantly low key - having a distinctive presence that carries the film but does not overwhelm. The pivotal final scene (film making at it's finest!) is executed with a whimper - not a bang, and yet its reverberations are felt internally like an earthquake. Ultimately the words and works of man are carried away by the wind, leaving us with only long sweeping panoramic landscapes captured with patience by Antonioni's camera.",5,No man can escape himself.,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1618,"['David', 'Locke', 'reporter', 'out', 'North', 'African', 'desert', 'looking', 'story', 'truth', 'trail', 'endless', 'rolling', 'sand', 'dunes', 'stillness', 'desert', 'kind', 'waiting', 'Locke', 'weary', 'impatient', 'disillusioned', 'tired', 'waiting', 'preferring', 'men', 'landscapes', 'when', 'fellow', 'traveler', 'hotel', 'room', 'adjacent', 'heart', 'attack', 'dies', 'Locke', 'opportunity', 'reinvent', 'literally', 'stepping', 'shoes', 'Who', 'was', 'man', 'Robinson', 'What', 'did', 'believe', 'Ironically', 'answer', 'tied', 'search', 'initiated', 'Locke', 'beginning', 'film', 'course', 'way', 'knowing', 'must', 'travel', 'fatalistic', 'journey', 'are', 'coincidences', 'Director', 'Antonioni', 'patience', 'enough', 'listen', 'wind', 'omnipresent', 'presence', 'mock', 'urgency', 'man', 'visual', 'acuity', 'marvelous', 'architectural', 'wonders', 'Gaudi', 'other', 'places', 'refuge', 'where', 'man', 'can', 'hide', 'man', 'ultimately', 'can', 'never', 'escape', 'ever', 'persistent', 'question', 'What', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Locke', 'brilliantly', 'low', 'key', 'having', 'distinctive', 'presence', 'film', 'not', 'overwhelm', 'pivotal', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'making', 'finest', 'executed', 'whimper', 'not', 'bang', 'yet', 'reverberations', 'are', 'felt', 'internally', 'earthquake', 'Ultimately', 'words', 'works', 'man', 'are', 'carried', 'away', 'wind', 'leaving', 'only', 'long', 'sweeping', 'panoramic', 'landscapes', 'captured', 'patience', 'Antonioni', 'camera']",N/A
