Fox got rid of it and then the WB picked it up just to cancel it as well. So neither stations are that smart lol. Donal Logue (Blade, The Patriot) is an a hilarious leading man as Sean Finnerty . Each weak he has to deal with a different family problem. He also has great chemestry with Megyn Price who plays his wife. The rest of the cast is fine as well. Kevin Corrigan steals the show every time he's shown as Sean's scheming brother Eddie. I get baffled to why this show was canceled every time I see re-runs on ABC Family Channel.

In it's rookie season, it was good, but as each season progressed, I think it got better.  My favourite character is Eddie who comes across as a dark, moody, brooding and mysterious guy, who is actually a puppy dog.  The kids are great and the parents are fun.  What this show does in each and every episode, is have flashbacks.  The story lines always have a reason to go back in time and explain how a particular situation occured.  The Finnerty's are the fun kind of family we all wish we were a part of.  Through all the teasing and fighting, you know they love each other.  This is a keeper, and I'm sorry it was cancelled.

958024,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B000CEXF7O,Mr. J. Murdock,"[1, 1]","Grounded for Life will go down as one of those overlooked sitcoms of our time with Lynsey Bartilson's performance as Lily Finnerty rarely getting the attention it deserves. Bartilson got the screeching at the top of her lungs and the temper tantrums down to an exact hilarious science! Lily Finnerty wants to be part of the popular clique, date the hot boyfriend but she wasn't a malicious person. She wouldn't stab her best friend in the back. Whenever she tried to climb the social ladder of popularity it would more often times than not end in an embarrassing failure. And we can all relate because we've all been teenagers and been in Lily Finnerty's shoes at one time or another.In the episode ""Devil in a Plaid Skirt"" Lily is at home suspended because her skirt was too short. One scene stands out to mind is when the doorbell rings and Lily is right there to answer it but, too lazy, she keeps yelling at somebody else to open the door. This prompts Sean to say, ""Get off your lazy butt and open the damned door!"" I had to rewind that scene over and over again. I just couldn't stop laughing! Or in ""Jimmy was Kung-Fu Fighting"" Lily, after beating up Jimmy's bully in school, saw her social status drop immensely in her class and she became the butt of jokes. This causes her to take drastic action and have her tongue pierced so she can be popular once again. She sticks her tongue out to her parents but Sister Helen inadvertently caught her in the act and that's when you knew Lily is in deep trouble!A brilliant series which was sadly canceled by the FOX network a few episodes into its third season (FOX canceling a great series? What else is new?) only to be picked up the WB network but never really getting the exposure it needed to thrive. On the up side, at least this series lasted for 91 episodes.",5,Lynsey Bartilson underappreciated in her role as Lily Finnerty,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,1816,"['Grounded', 'Life', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'overlooked', 'sitcoms', 'time', 'Lynsey', 'Bartilson', 'performance', 'Lily', 'Finnerty', 'rarely', 'getting', 'attention', 'Bartilson', 'got', 'screeching', 'top', 'lungs', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'down', 'exact', 'hilarious', 'science', 'Lily', 'Finnerty', 'be', 'part', 'popular', 'clique', 'date', 'hot', 'boyfriend', 'was', ""n't"", 'malicious', 'person', 'would', ""n't"", 'stab', 'best', 'friend', 'back', 'Whenever', 'tried', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'popularity', 'would', 'more', 'often', 'times', 'not', 'end', 'embarrassing', 'failure', 'can', 'relate', ""'ve"", 'been', 'teenagers', 'been', 'Lily', 'Finnerty', 'shoes', 'one', 'time', 'another.In', 'episode', 'Devil', 'Plaid', 'Skirt', 'Lily', 'home', 'suspended', 'skirt', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'One', 'scene', 'out', 'mind', 'when', 'doorbell', 'rings', 'Lily', 'right', 'there', 'answer', 'too', 'lazy', 'yelling', 'somebody', 'else', 'open', 'door', 'prompts', 'Sean', 'say', 'Get', 'off', 'lazy', 'butt', 'open', 'damned', 'door', 'had', 'rewind', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'Kung-Fu', 'Fighting', 'Lily', 'beating', 'up', 'Jimmy', 'bully', 'school', 'saw', 'social', 'status', 'drop', 'immensely', 'class', 'became', 'butt', 'jokes', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'have', 'tongue', 'pierced', 'can', 'be', 'popular', 'once', 'again', 'tongue', 'parents', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'inadvertently', 'caught', 'act', 'when', 'knew', 'Lily', 'deep', 'trouble', 'brilliant', 'series', 'was', 'sadly', 'canceled', 'FOX', 'network', 'few', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'FOX', 'canceling', 'great', 'series', 'What', 'else', 'new', 'only', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'WB', 'network', 'never', 'really', 'getting', 'exposure', 'needed', 'thrive', 'up', 'side', 'least', 'series', 'lasted', '91', 'episodes']",Grounded for Life: Season 1

958029,AEOPJVBT9OLUQ,B000CEXF7O,"SpookCentral.tk ""SpookCentral.tk""","[26, 38]","This is a review of this product:Grounded For Life Season 1 DVD.  Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------[Please Note: The 1 Star rating is NOT for the episodes themselves, but for the misleading packaging and for Carsey-Warner's lack of cooperation in helping the fans identify the altered episodes.]I'm a big fan of Grounded For Life and have every episode on tape from the original Fox and WB broadcasts since day one (January 10, 2001).  I was thrilled with the prospect of buying all of the episodes on DVD (save for season 5 which hasn't been released yet) so that I could have better quality copies, taking up less shelf space, and could then erase all of the tapes I recorded.Although I have not had the chance to watch any of the episodes on the Season 1-4 DVD sets, I did check out all of the discs (to ensure playability) and actually stumbled upon something that I did not like: The season 1 episode ""I Wanna Be Suspended"" (disc 1, episode 3) has been ALTERED!  The Ramones song ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" played during the concert scene in the original tv broadcast was replaced with generic music on the DVD (at 4:37), a brief concert flashback a few minutes later (at 7:28) replaced some instrumental song with a different instrumental song.  There may be more alterations to this episode, or other episodes in any of the sets, as I didn't check any further than this.I know why music is routinely replaced on TV-on-DVD releases, so I don't have a problem with the replacing of the music.  However, I am displeased by the misleading packaging which states that these are ""uncut"" episodes.  Although there is a difference between ""uncut"" and ""unaltered"", the ""uncut"" remark on the box implies that the episodes are exactly the same as what was originally shown on TV, which obviously isn't true.  The ""uncut"" statement should have had an asterisk directing to text at the bottom to tell that music has been altered in some episodes.I sent an e-mail to Anchor Bay (TVonDVD-AT-anchorbayent-DOT-com), the company that released the DVD sets, to get a complete list of all alterations (music or otherwise) for every Grounded For Life set.  Surely a list of alterations for every set must exist, as the person at Carsey-Warner whose job it is to replace the music when the episodes are prepped for DVD has to have a list to work off of.  Since I have the entire series on tape in their original network broadcast versions, I need to know which of my recorded episodes I need to keep because they're different from what I just bought on DVD, as I plan on erasing the taped episodes that are 100% exactly the same as on the DVD.I received a reply from Rose Zivkovich.  She e-mailed Janet Bonifer, Executive Director of Marketing & Creative Services at Carsey-Warner (her address is either jbonifer-AT-carseywerner-DOT-com or jbonifer-AT-cwm-DOT-com), who told Rose that ""Our legal department advises against providing this type of information to consumers.""These is no legal reason why Janet, or anyone else at Carsey-Warner, could not furnish the list to me (whether through Rose, or to me directly).  Anyone who has every episode on tape from the original Fox and WB broadcasts (like me) and has the time (not like me) could check every one of the 78 episodes (91 episodes, including Season 5) one-by-one to compile the same list.  Getting the list from Carsey-Warner would save time, energy, and insure completeness in the list.I tried e-mailing Carsey-Warner directly via the most appropriate contact I could find (Janet's boss): Barron Postmus, bpostmus-AT-cwm-DOT-com, Vice President of Marketing & Creative Services.  To no surprise, he has not replied to any of the e-mails that I've sent to him.I made one final attempt to obtain the list of alterations by writing a letter to the series creators Mike Schiff & Bill Martin via their agent (c/o Nancy Jones, Creative Artists Agency, 2000 Avenue Of The Stars, Los Angeles, CA 90067).

The sets aren't very elaborate and the cast isn't huge, so the show relies on excellent writing & excellent acting. The basic premise finds a young married couple who married very early in life now have three children, but are sort of children themselves, and throws in a sleazy brother and a domineering (in a funny dopey way) father.A lot of the show focuses on dealing with their teenage daughter. She rebels, she deals with boys, that kind of thing.  They also have two sons who seem to play slightly smaller roles, but are nonetheless extremely entertaining. Considering they're child actors, all three children do excellent jobs. There's also a boyfriend in the picture, but he doesn't get that much room to act in this season so hard to tell what his range is.The closest show that comes to mind when I think about similar sitcoms was the extraordinaryTitus, probably my favorite sitcom of all time. All the episodes are good to great, but many of them do come to that level of excellence. My wife was laughing at me because I was laughing like a mental patient at some scene.  If you want to show that doesn't rely on a lot of flash to entertain you, but instead is just genuinely funny and well-written, you really can't go wrong with this series. You can really tell just from looking at all the other reviews here. The show was well loved and you'll enjoy it.My only complaint, season 1 was too short at only 13 episodes.Season 2has 22.  I literally just found out tonight that it went a whole 5 seasons, so I may have to pick up some other ones at some point.",5,Awesome Show!,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1606,"['true', 'situation', 'comedy', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'elaborate', 'cast', ""n't"", 'huge', 'show', 'excellent', 'writing', 'excellent', 'acting', 'basic', 'premise', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'married', 'very', 'early', 'life', 'now', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'sort', 'children', 'sleazy', 'brother', 'domineering', 'funny', 'dopey', 'way', 'father.A', 'lot', 'show', 'dealing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'boys', 'kind', 'thing', 'also', 'have', 'two', 'sons', 'who', 'seem', 'play', 'slightly', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Considering', ""'re"", 'child', 'actors', 'three', 'children', 'do', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'also', 'boyfriend', 'picture', ""n't"", 'get', 'that', 'much', 'room', 'act', 'season', 'so', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'range', 'is.The', 'closest', 'show', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'similar', 'sitcoms', 'was', 'extraordinaryTitus', 'probably', 'favorite', 'sitcom', 'time', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'great', 'many', 'do', 'come', 'level', 'excellence', 'wife', 'was', 'laughing', 'was', 'laughing', 'mental', 'patient', 'scene', 'want', 'show', ""n't"", 'rely', 'lot', 'flash', 'entertain', 'instead', 'just', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'well-written', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'series', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'just', 'looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'loved', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', '1', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'only', '13', 'episodes.Season', '2has', '22', 'literally', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'tonight', 'went', 'whole', '5', 'seasons', 'may', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'other', 'ones', 'point']",Grounded for Life: Season 1
