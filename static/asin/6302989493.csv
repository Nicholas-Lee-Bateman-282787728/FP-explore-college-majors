349335,A2E9TIXXL6WEJ3,6302989493,Betty La Fongga,"[2, 3]","This movie is cute, but you probably don't want to buy it unless1) You're a teenage girl. Not saying that's a bad thing, mind you.2) You're a big fan of this genre (coming of age, set in the late 50s-early 60s), or a Juliette Lewis fan.Basic plot(s): 10-year old Ally is kind of a dork. Her friends are mean to her, and the neighborhood boys tease her, too. Ally lives across the street from teenage Catholic school girl Sheryl(Juliette Lewis). Ally idolizes Sheryl from afar, because she thinks she is so cool. Meanwhile Sheryl meets a ""bad boy"" and falls in love with him. It's a predictable story that goes back and forth between Ally and Sheryl, until they become friends.It's not a terrible movie, just not the kind of movie you would watch more than once unless like I said, you're a young girl. Story has been done a million times. The acting is okay, but I personally have seen Juliette Lewis do better, a C. Thomas Howell isn't very good, actually. Both look way too old to be playing teenagers, but that's usually how it is. There is nothing spectacular about the score or the directing or anything like that.",3,Rent it,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,1119,"['movie', 'cute', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'unless1', ""'re"", 'teenage', 'girl', 'Not', 'saying', 'bad', 'thing', 'mind', 'you.2', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'genre', 'coming', 'age', 'set', 'late', '50s-early', '60s', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'fan.Basic', 'plot', 's', '10-year', 'old', 'Ally', 'kind', 'dork', 'friends', 'are', 'mean', 'neighborhood', 'too', 'Ally', 'street', 'teenage', 'Catholic', 'school', 'girl', 'Sheryl', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Ally', 'Sheryl', 'afar', 'so', 'cool', 'Meanwhile', 'Sheryl', 'bad', 'boy', 'love', 'predictable', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'Ally', 'Sheryl', 'become', 'friends.It', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'said', ""'re"", 'young', 'girl', 'Story', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'acting', 'okay', 'personally', 'have', 'seen', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'do', 'better', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actually', 'look', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'usually', 'how', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'score', 'directing', 'anything']",N/A

It is a coming of age story like many others before and after it, but there is a certain sweetness and gentleness that pervades this film.Best described,THAT NIGHT is a ten year old's rendering of ROMEO AND JULIET.",4,Pleasant and nostalgic memories of THAT NIGHT,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1525,"['1961', 'JFK', 'was', 'White', 'House', 'Red', 'Scare', 'was', 'everyone', 'lips', 'Rock', 'n', 'roll', 'was', 'transistors', 'Beatles', 'had', 'not', 'invaded', 'Britain', 'yet', 'country', 'was', 'hitting', 'puberty', 'change', 'big', 'change', 'was', 'air', 'NIGHT', 'delightful', 'Alice', 'MacDermott', 'novel', 'views', 'country', 'pending', 'metamorphosis', 'eyes', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Alice', 'primed', 'big', 'changes', 'are', 'occur', 'vicariously', 'exotic', 'near', 'iconic', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Sheryl.Sheryl', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'grown', 'up', 'perfect', 'Catholic', 'home', 'fallen', 'greaser', 'C.Thomas', 'Howell', '.Alice', 'Eliza', 'Dusku', 'enamoured', 'love', 'affair', 'ensuing', 'drama', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'fine', 'people', 'post', '1950', 'suburban', 'community.THAT', 'NIGHT', 'time', 'innocence', 'American', 'life', 'when', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'clearly', 'defined', 'when', 'true', 'love', 'steps', 'convention', 'rocked', 'foundation.For', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Era', 'will', 'understand', 'nature', 'story', 'too', 'well', 'will', 'wax', 'nostalgically', 'sounds', 'time.The', 'taboos', 'time', 'have', 'largely', 'disappeared', 'progressive', 'society', 'story', 'ageless', 'intense', 'nonsensical', 'power', 'first', 'love', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'many', 'others', 'certain', 'sweetness', 'gentleness', 'film.Best', 'described', 'THAT', 'NIGHT', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'rendering', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET']",N/A

349340,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,6302989493,Movie Fan,"[2, 4]","This movie use to be on t.v. when i was about 12 and I loved watching it. Juliette Lewis, who has been in many movies, is a great actress and is a bit forgotto at times, not to mention she lives in my town. I was driving with my dad one day and i looked to my right and there she was in her car at a traffic stop drinking a starbucks frappacinno and then she drove into this gated neighborhood where the richie's live. But anyway, young eliza dushku plays the little girl in this movie that looks up to lewis, and in such different times, lewis and howell are basically the talk of the town and neighborhood full of gossip and envy, and anger. It takes place in the 50's i believe and after being in the outsiders, once again c thomas howell is still in that time in this drama. It is a little depressing at times, because howell is obviously misunderstood as being a no good punk kid who knocks up his girlfriend and ditches her when that isn't the case at all and no one understands that they are in fact in love but they both realize that their youth is the main obsticle to have a successful long lasting life together raising their child. I don't think they have this movie for rent anymore anywhere. But it has always been underrated. It's a good example of teen pregnancy and i think that parents should watch it with their kids if they or out of control or just for entertainment.",5,Underrated,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,1388,"['movie', 'use', 'be', 't.v', 'when', 'i', 'was', '12', 'loved', 'watching', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'who', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'great', 'actress', 'bit', 'forgotto', 'times', 'not', 'mention', 'town', 'was', 'driving', 'dad', 'one', 'day', 'i', 'looked', 'right', 'was', 'car', 'traffic', 'stop', 'drinking', 'starbucks', 'frappacinno', 'then', 'drove', 'gated', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'richie', 'live', 'anyway', 'young', 'eliza', 'dushku', 'little', 'girl', 'movie', 'up', 'lewis', 'such', 'different', 'times', 'lewis', 'howell', 'are', 'basically', 'talk', 'town', 'neighborhood', 'full', 'gossip', 'envy', 'anger', 'place', '50', 'i', 'believe', 'being', 'outsiders', 'once', 'again', 'c', 'thomas', 'howell', 'still', 'time', 'drama', 'little', 'depressing', 'times', 'howell', 'obviously', 'misunderstood', 'being', 'good', 'punk', 'kid', 'who', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'when', ""n't"", 'case', 'one', 'are', 'fact', 'love', 'realize', 'youth', 'main', 'obsticle', 'have', 'successful', 'long', 'lasting', 'life', 'together', 'raising', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'movie', 'rent', 'anymore', 'anywhere', 'always', 'been', 'underrated', 'good', 'example', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'i', 'think', 'parents', 'should', 'watch', 'kids', 'control', 'just', 'entertainment']",N/A

I kept thinking it was &#34;About Last Night&#34; but kept kitting a dead end road when I tried to look it up and realized that was a Demi Moore movie. Then I happened to click on an article where Eliza Dushku (Alice) happens to post a picture of herself with Brad Pitt (who was Juliette Lewis' boyfriend at the time) on the set of this movie. I was floored! I finally had the name of the movie and the leading actors and I could FINALLY look for the movie! I came straight here and looked it up and saw it on Amazon Video and I am watching it for the first time in over 20 years now. I am falling in love all over again. I even got excited watching a couple of scenes that I remember (like the breast cream scene and the frog scene) but could never recall what movie they were from. I am sooooo glad I happened to click on that article and that it lead me to be able to watch one of my old faves again after all this time! Nicely made movie!
