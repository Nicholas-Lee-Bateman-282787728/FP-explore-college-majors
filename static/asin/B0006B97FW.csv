864951,A2EQRK21C2WFI6,B0006B97FW,"D. Allen ""Wolfman""","[9, 10]","Kiba, Tsume, Hige Tolboy and Blue head towards the City of the Noble villeness, Jagera, while along the way, running into some familliar charactors.  The world, it seems, is rapidly coming toward the end.  As Hubb, Cher and Quint are in persuit, we begin to learn of each's background, and it seems as though all (including Blue and Cheza)continue to run into circumstances where they trade off traveling partners.  And wat's up with Hige?  Hige begins to suffer strange bouts of headaches and dementia...all to do with his past.  There is a lot to it, but as they used to say in ""The Prisoner"", ""That would be telling..."".Again, the storytelling, soundtrack and animation are fantastic.  This series is something quite different than any other Anime series I've ever seen.  My only real complaint about the series is why we don't seem to see too much of the wolves in their true wolf form.  I know there are a lot of idiots out there who like human-centric shows and games, and who would equate stories involing animals as Di$neyesque, yet this is a story (as admitted by writer/director Keiko Nobumoto), about a pack of wolves on a journey...that fact alone makes this story unique.  I suppose they are trying to suggest that the wolves have human like emotions and feelings (I've raised and have been around wolves most of my life, and in my opinion, true wolves are probably the closest thing to humans in the animal world).  On a side note...many of my friends have asked what's up with the way the wolves are dressed in their human guises...what I read into it is that the wolves don't really understand the concept of fassion...to them, cloths are just scaps of cloth and leather that cover the body from the feet to the neck.  My suggestion to the producers is that if and when they make a film or season 2, the story would be alot more interesting and challanging to show the pack in their true wolven forms at least half the time.If you have seen most of the episodes so far, this disk is the build up to the fianl five episodes.  Pay carefull attention, because what happens in most of these episodes has meaning in the final five episodes.  If you've only seen this series on Adult Swim, pay attention to the opening credits (never shown on the Saturday Night airings of Adult Swim through 2004).  It has a lot to do with the final episode.  If you are about to order the entire series, or just getting ready to recieve the final disk, go out and get a couple of boxes of tissue to go with it...it's going to be a trademark Studio Bones ending (IE: Cowboy Bebop), though more open to a film or a second season.",5,Build-up to the climax,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2622,"['Kiba', 'Tsume', 'Hige', 'Tolboy', 'Blue', 'head', 'City', 'Noble', 'villeness', 'Jagera', 'way', 'running', 'familliar', 'charactors', 'world', 'rapidly', 'coming', 'end', 'Hubb', 'Cher', 'Quint', 'are', 'persuit', 'begin', 'learn', 'background', 'including', 'Blue', 'Cheza', 'continue', 'run', 'circumstances', 'where', 'trade', 'off', 'traveling', 'partners', 'wat', 'up', 'Hige', 'Hige', 'suffer', 'strange', 'bouts', 'headaches', 'dementia', 'do', 'past', 'lot', 'used', 'say', 'Prisoner', 'would', 'be', 'telling', '.Again', 'storytelling', 'soundtrack', 'animation', 'are', 'fantastic', 'series', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'Anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'series', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'wolves', 'true', 'wolf', 'form', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'idiots', 'there', 'who', 'human-centric', 'shows', 'games', 'who', 'would', 'equate', 'stories', 'involing', 'animals', 'Di', 'neyesque', 'yet', 'story', 'admitted', 'writer/director', 'Keiko', 'Nobumoto', 'pack', 'wolves', 'journey', 'fact', 'alone', 'story', 'unique', 'suppose', 'are', 'trying', 'suggest', 'wolves', 'have', 'human', 'emotions', 'feelings', ""'ve"", 'raised', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'life', 'opinion', 'true', 'wolves', 'are', 'probably', 'closest', 'thing', 'humans', 'animal', 'world', 'side', 'note', 'many', 'friends', 'have', 'asked', 'what', 'up', 'way', 'wolves', 'are', 'dressed', 'human', 'guises', 'what', 'read', 'wolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'concept', 'fassion', 'cloths', 'are', 'just', 'scaps', 'cloth', 'leather', 'body', 'feet', 'neck', 'suggestion', 'producers', 'when', 'make', 'film', 'season', '2', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'alot', 'more', 'interesting', 'challanging', 'show', 'pack', 'true', 'wolven', 'forms', 'least', 'time.If', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'disk', 'build', 'up', 'fianl', 'five', 'episodes', 'Pay', 'carefull', 'attention', 'what', 'most', 'episodes', 'meaning', 'final', 'five', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'series', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'pay', 'attention', 'opening', 'credits', 'never', 'shown', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'airings', 'Adult', 'Swim', '2004', 'lot', 'do', 'final', 'episode', 'are', 'order', 'entire', 'series', 'just', 'getting', 'ready', 'recieve', 'final', 'disk', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'couple', 'boxes', 'tissue', 'go', 'going', 'be', 'trademark', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'ending', 'IE', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'though', 'more', 'open', 'film', 'second', 'season']",Wolf's Rain: War for the Soul - Volume 5
864952,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B0006B97FW,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[3, 3]","After DVD #4 in this series turned into a recap, it is quite a relief to find the story underway again, with all of the characters following one path or another towards Jaguera's keep.  Most viewers don't realize that this is a 30 episode series (the last four are an OVA), but even with that much remaining, these episodes are tense and exciting as we build to our first chilling meeting with the darkest of the Nobles.The opening episodes follow Tsume, Toboe,  and Hige in their search for Kiba.  As hope dims their irritation with each other mounts only the discovery of a native tribe calleed the Hmong (very much echo our own Navaho and Hopi cultures) manages to keep the peace.  There the wolves are accepted, and we first encounter the legend that it was wolves that were the first people, from whom humans were made.  This experience makes so great an impression on Toboe that he feels a strong urge to remain with the human tribe.  Kiba, in the meantime, seems to have wandered into a version of paradise.  It is a beautiful world of woods and water where he meets a beautiful feline (My) who seems to be his soul mate.  Gradually we realize that, for all his happiness, he is in danger of forgetting both Cheza and his quest.  Finally they are reunited, and the wolves start out again after Cheza, somehow closer together for all their experiences.The wolves come upon a battle between Jaguera's troops and the remaining soldiers of  a large city.  The join in and are directed to Jaguera's castle when the seek clues about Cheza's whereabouts.  Next, attention moves to the fates of Cheza, Blue, Hubb, and Cher.  Several battles trigger a great deal of path crossing and the four are first reunitied and then split up to make their way to the final confrontation.  Then we are back with the wolves on their trip across a sea of ice.  This brings about one of the most dramatic fights of the series as Toboe suddenly comes of age as a wolf and ceases to be the runt of the litter in one spectacular moment.  Finally we come to Jaguera's keep for one final chilling image.  Once again, we know why this has been a consistently excellent series.One of the things that make this series so memorable is the consistent attention to character development.  So many anime hold themselves to a minimal amount of character writing.  We rarely see characters like go through the kind of development that Quent Yaiden work's through as he realizes that Blue is a wolf, not the family dog, or Toboe's remarkable turnabout in this DVD.  We wind up caring as much about the characters as we do the plot, as much impressed by their depth as we are by the artwork and music.  Wolf's Rain turns into a memorable experience, rather than just an entertainment.  I cannot recommend this series enough.",5,Turning the Corner,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,2791,"['DVD', '4', 'series', 'turned', 'recap', 'quite', 'relief', 'find', 'story', 'underway', 'again', 'characters', 'following', 'one', 'path', 'towards', 'Jaguera', 'keep', 'Most', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', '30', 'episode', 'series', 'last', 'four', 'are', 'OVA', 'even', 'much', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'are', 'tense', 'exciting', 'build', 'first', 'chilling', 'meeting', 'darkest', 'Nobles.The', 'opening', 'episodes', 'follow', 'Tsume', 'Toboe', 'Hige', 'search', 'Kiba', 'hope', 'irritation', 'other', 'mounts', 'only', 'discovery', 'native', 'tribe', 'calleed', 'Hmong', 'very', 'much', 'echo', 'own', 'Navaho', 'Hopi', 'cultures', 'keep', 'peace', 'wolves', 'are', 'accepted', 'first', 'encounter', 'legend', 'was', 'wolves', 'were', 'first', 'people', 'whom', 'humans', 'were', 'made', 'experience', 'so', 'great', 'impression', 'Toboe', 'strong', 'urge', 'remain', 'human', 'tribe', 'Kiba', 'meantime', 'have', 'wandered', 'version', 'paradise', 'beautiful', 'world', 'woods', 'water', 'where', 'beautiful', 'feline', 'My', 'who', 'be', 'soul', 'mate', 'Gradually', 'realize', 'happiness', 'danger', 'forgetting', 'Cheza', 'quest', 'Finally', 'are', 'reunited', 'wolves', 'start', 'out', 'again', 'Cheza', 'somehow', 'closer', 'together', 'experiences.The', 'wolves', 'come', 'battle', 'Jaguera', 'troops', 'remaining', 'soldiers', 'large', 'city', 'join', 'are', 'directed', 'Jaguera', 'castle', 'when', 'seek', 'clues', 'Cheza', 'whereabouts', 'Next', 'attention', 'moves', 'fates', 'Cheza', 'Blue', 'Hubb', 'Cher', 'Several', 'battles', 'trigger', 'great', 'deal', 'path', 'crossing', 'four', 'are', 'first', 'reunitied', 'then', 'split', 'up', 'make', 'way', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Then', 'are', 'back', 'wolves', 'trip', 'sea', 'ice', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'fights', 'series', 'Toboe', 'suddenly', 'age', 'wolf', 'ceases', 'be', 'runt', 'litter', 'one', 'spectacular', 'moment', 'Finally', 'come', 'Jaguera', 'keep', 'one', 'final', 'chilling', 'image', 'Once', 'again', 'know', 'why', 'been', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'series.One', 'things', 'make', 'series', 'so', 'memorable', 'consistent', 'attention', 'character', 'development', 'So', 'many', 'anime', 'hold', 'minimal', 'amount', 'character', 'writing', 'rarely', 'see', 'characters', 'go', 'kind', 'development', 'Quent', 'Yaiden', 'work', 'Blue', 'wolf', 'not', 'family', 'dog', 'Toboe', 'remarkable', 'turnabout', 'DVD', 'wind', 'up', 'caring', 'much', 'characters', 'do', 'plot', 'much', 'impressed', 'depth', 'are', 'artwork', 'music', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'memorable', 'experience', 'rather', 'just', 'entertainment', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'enough']",Wolf's Rain: War for the Soul - Volume 5
864953,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B0006B97FW,Sesho,"[2, 2]","After Darcia's keep is destroyed by another Noble, Lady Jaguara, most of the main characters are seperated from each other. Kiba wakes up to find himself in an idyllic wilderness paradise, with a lynx-like creature named Mew, who can assume human form like the wolves. Kiba feels at peace and begins to forget about the past, present, and future. Has he found Paradise, or is there something more sinister working underneath it all? As his friends desperately try to locate him, they encounter a human tribe who look suspiciously like Native American Indians whose legends say they are descended from wolves. As the human world begins to descend into full-scale warfare, Hubb and Cher continue their search for Cheza, who was captured by Jaguara's forces along with Blue. And let's not forget about Quent, the wolf-killer whose life just might be saved by the creatures he hates.After being infuriated by the last volume of Wolf's Rain, which consisted entirely of flashbacks and recycled animation, this was a welcome return to a series that I rank as one of the best. Like Cowboy Bebop, this anime has a very American feel to me. At times, it seems equal parts fairy tale and visionquest. In an interview with one of the shows creators, it is stated that some people just ""won't get"" this series. In other words, they won't comprehend it and get behind it and support it. But I promise you, if you let yourself go and get involved in this story, you'll enter a world more incredible than any other film out there. Once again, Yoko Kanno's score is majestic and ethereal and elegiac, with a few electric guitars thrown in for good measure. Masterpiece of animation and music and characterization.The subpar extras continue as the only thing we get here are 3 textless endings. Audio is English 5.1 and 2.0. Japanese 2.0. English subtitles if you want them.Also recommended: Cowboy Bebop, Escaflowne. There is also a manga version of Wolf's Rain.",5,IS PARADISE A DREAM?,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,1946,"['Darcia', 'keep', 'destroyed', 'Noble', 'Lady', 'Jaguara', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'seperated', 'other', 'Kiba', 'up', 'find', 'idyllic', 'wilderness', 'paradise', 'lynx-like', 'creature', 'named', 'Mew', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'human', 'form', 'wolves', 'Kiba', 'feels', 'peace', 'forget', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'found', 'Paradise', 'there', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'working', 'underneath', 'friends', 'desperately', 'try', 'locate', 'encounter', 'human', 'tribe', 'who', 'look', 'suspiciously', 'Native', 'American', 'Indians', 'legends', 'say', 'are', 'descended', 'wolves', 'human', 'world', 'descend', 'full-scale', 'warfare', 'Hubb', 'Cher', 'continue', 'search', 'Cheza', 'who', 'was', 'captured', 'Jaguara', 'forces', 'Blue', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Quent', 'wolf-killer', 'life', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'saved', 'creatures', 'hates.After', 'being', 'infuriated', 'last', 'volume', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'consisted', 'entirely', 'flashbacks', 'recycled', 'animation', 'was', 'welcome', 'return', 'series', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'anime', 'very', 'American', 'feel', 'times', 'equal', 'parts', 'fairy', 'tale', 'visionquest', 'interview', 'one', 'shows', 'creators', 'stated', 'people', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'series', 'other', 'words', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'get', 'support', 'promise', 'let', 'go', 'get', 'involved', 'story', ""'ll"", 'enter', 'world', 'more', 'incredible', 'other', 'film', 'there', 'Once', 'again', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'score', 'majestic', 'ethereal', 'elegiac', 'few', 'electric', 'guitars', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Masterpiece', 'animation', 'music', 'characterization.The', 'subpar', 'extras', 'continue', 'only', 'thing', 'get', 'here', 'are', '3', 'textless', 'endings', 'Audio', 'English', '5.1', '2.0', 'Japanese', '2.0', 'English', 'subtitles', 'want', 'them.Also', 'recommended', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Escaflowne', 'also', 'manga', 'version', 'Wolf', 'Rain']",Wolf's Rain: War for the Soul - Volume 5
