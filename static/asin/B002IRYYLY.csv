Then one day, a mysterious person comes into Ritsuka's life by the name Soubi, who was Seimei's partner before he died. Soubi then becomes Ritsuka's partner because of the dying wish of Seimei. Ritsuka and Soubi then must fight other teams like them in order to find what really happened to Seimei. This series includes some forms of comedy, mystery, and love interests. I would highly recommend this series to any Shonen-ai fan.",5,Loveless Complete Slimpack,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,551,"['Shonen-ai', 'series', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'story', 'child', 'named', 'Ritsuka', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'older', 'brother', 'Seimei', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'mysterious', 'person', 'Ritsuka', 'life', 'name', 'Soubi', 'who', 'was', 'Seimei', 'partner', 'died', 'Soubi', 'then', 'Ritsuka', 'partner', 'dying', 'wish', 'Seimei', 'Ritsuka', 'Soubi', 'then', 'must', 'fight', 'other', 'teams', 'order', 'find', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Seimei', 'series', 'forms', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'love', 'interests', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'Shonen-ai', 'fan']",N/A

1270679,ADLHTN3JMD5KX,B002IRYYLY,"Mandie ""Mandie""","[10, 11]","First off, love, love loved this series! The manga was awesome, and the anime was amazing. The artwork, the storylines, everything. Bought it for the price on Amazon... def worth every penny.Ritsuka school student who had lost his older brother. Never knowing what happened to him, he searches for the truth. Then one day he meets Soubi a older gentleman who tells him that he knew his older brother and knows about his death. From that point on, life changes for Ritsuka. He and Soubi develop an almost romantic relationship.... even to the point that they both can hurt each other's feelings easily. Eventually Ritsuka learns that Soubi was his brother's fighter partner... and that Ritsuka's real name is ""Loveless"". Well, from then on they battle many different people and their partners to get to the truth behind Ritsuka's brother's death.Thats as much as the story I'll give you. You'll love the characters, you'll love the plot, and you'll love the animation. However there's only 12 episodes of this series. That's right... it's UNFINISHED. And I'm pretty sure this is all of the anime they'll make of the manga series. T_T Everything is kinda slow paced however even for a short series.... and the ending just kinda... never really happens... instead they close it with a random episode. XD But all said and done, def a 5. As someone told me: ""It shouldn't be called Loveless, it should be called Love.""",5,Can therez be more?,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,1413,"['First', 'off', 'love', 'love', 'loved', 'series', 'manga', 'was', 'awesome', 'anime', 'was', 'amazing', 'artwork', 'storylines', 'everything', 'Bought', 'price', 'Amazon', 'def', 'worth', 'penny.Ritsuka', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'older', 'brother', 'Never', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'truth', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Soubi', 'older', 'gentleman', 'who', 'knew', 'older', 'brother', 'death', 'point', 'life', 'changes', 'Ritsuka', 'Soubi', 'develop', 'almost', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'even', 'point', 'can', 'hurt', 'other', 'feelings', 'easily', 'Eventually', 'Ritsuka', 'Soubi', 'was', 'brother', 'fighter', 'partner', 'Ritsuka', 'real', 'name', 'Loveless', 'Well', 'then', 'battle', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'partners', 'get', 'truth', 'Ritsuka', 'brother', 'death.Thats', 'as', 'much', 'story', ""'ll"", 'give', ""'ll"", 'love', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'love', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'love', 'animation', 'However', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'series', 'right', 'UNFINISHED', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'anime', ""'ll"", 'make', 'manga', 'series', 'T_T', 'Everything', 'kinda', 'slow', 'paced', 'however', 'even', 'short', 'series', 'ending', 'just', 'kinda', 'never', 'really', 'instead', 'close', 'random', 'episode', 'XD', 'said', 'done', 'def', '5', 'someone', 'told', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'called', 'Loveless', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Love']",N/A
