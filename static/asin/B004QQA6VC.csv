It reminds me a little of the little rascals type of show with all kids as the main characters. Excellent!,5,Very exciting story!,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,232,"['movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'young', 'grandson', 'So', 'nice', 'have', 'exciting', 'story', 'ugly', 'monsters', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'little', 'little', 'rascals', 'type', 'show', 'kids', 'main', 'characters', 'Excellent']",N/A

I almost never give movies a five star rating, but this movie even edified and strengthened me.  It wouldn't be worth lowering my star-vote, but you may want to know that there is a scene where one boy punches another in the face.  I tell you this because my three-year-old son decided to do the same after he watched this movie.  It's better for older kids, maybe five and up.

It has a charming tale of sin/redemption, great filming, and the music score is awesome (if not a bit of a rip off from Indiana Jones / Star Wars).  I was very surprised indeed, the production crew has created a truly unique experience with this film.It's also very decent for the whole family, no sex/profanity, the worst violence is seeing kids beat each other over the head with sticks at one point (of course the good guys win).",5,"Seriously, is this really a low budget film?",1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,497,"['first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'charming', 'tale', 'sin/redemption', 'great', 'filming', 'music', 'score', 'awesome', 'not', 'bit', 'rip', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '/', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'indeed', 'production', 'crew', 'created', 'truly', 'unique', 'experience', 'film.It', 'also', 'very', 'decent', 'whole', 'family', 'sex/profanity', 'worst', 'violence', 'seeing', 'kids', 'beat', 'other', 'head', 'sticks', 'one', 'point', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'win']",N/A

We watched it last night for the first time and we all loved it - powerful message, great acting, Indiana Jones-type music in the action scenes, adorable children (5 who play all the parts!), funny moments that our kids just loved... I highly recommend this movie!If you're like us, the beginning didn't quite make sense until we got a bit further into the movie; then all the parts fall into place and you'll be happy you stuck with it!

The children were all wonderful actors but more than that, the message of the film came shining through without the need for any obvious hints. The plot was subtle and the characters, though the children often played dual roles, were thoroughly individual.
