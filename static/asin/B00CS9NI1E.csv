It wasn't half bad!Okay, it's not agreat movie and Liberace was no great actor. I didn't say he wasn't an actor, just not a great one. The best thing this movie does for Liberace is preserve many of his piano performances in a way that only Hollywood could do.He is playing a concert pianist (what else?) and so the first half of the movie is his on-stage act circa 1955-1956, when he first becama a major TV star. His clothing has not yet reached the costume party stage and his on stage antics are relatively subdued. This allows the piano performances to take center stage and they are great! In fact, many of these numbers were re-created for BEHIND THE CANDELABRA.The script is a re-make of and old George Arliss (and Bette Davis) movie called THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD, and even if it is hokey, it suits Liberace to a tee.The Pianist loses his hearing and begins to question his purpose in life. He learns ASL and with the aid of a pair of binoculars, starts to meddle in the affairs of needful people he sees in the park downstairs and across the street from his penthouse. Well, he only helps three people and even these three are hardly worst case scenarios.His love interests are female. Well, it was 1956. There is Joanne Dru in a lovely subdued performance as his secretary who loves him but her love goes unnoticed. Dorothy Malone is a flashy Society Girl who he falls in love with. The love scenes are laughable now that so much is known about his personal life.The film is populated with memorable actors from the 1950s including William Demerest, Lori Nelson and Lurene Tuttle. You will also spot an unbilled Guy Williams.The film has a happy ending for all the participants. Lee even does an on-stage Tap-Dance exit toward the end of the film that will have you rolling in the aisles.More importantly, it doesn't have any of that salacious garbage that was in the biopic. I imagine that Lee would prefer to be remembered this way than that other way.",3,Liberace in Hollywood,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,2070,"['watched', 'movie', 'TCM', 'seeing', 'THE', 'CANDELABRA', 'was', 'curious', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'Okay', 'not', 'agreat', 'movie', 'Liberace', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'actor', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Liberace', 'preserve', 'many', 'piano', 'performances', 'way', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'do.He', 'playing', 'concert', 'pianist', 'what', 'else', 'so', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'on-stage', 'act', 'circa', '1955-1956', 'when', 'first', 'becama', 'major', 'TV', 'star', 'clothing', 'not', 'yet', 'reached', 'costume', 'party', 'stage', 'stage', 'antics', 'are', 'relatively', 'subdued', 'piano', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'are', 'great', 'fact', 'many', 'numbers', 'were', 're-created', 'THE', 'CANDELABRA.The', 'script', 're-make', 'old', 'George', 'Arliss', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'movie', 'called', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'PLAYED', 'GOD', 'even', 'hokey', 'suits', 'Liberace', 'tee.The', 'Pianist', 'hearing', 'question', 'purpose', 'life', 'ASL', 'aid', 'pair', 'binoculars', 'meddle', 'affairs', 'needful', 'people', 'park', 'downstairs', 'street', 'penthouse', 'Well', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'even', 'three', 'are', 'hardly', 'worst', 'case', 'scenarios.His', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'female', 'Well', 'was', '1956', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'lovely', 'subdued', 'performance', 'secretary', 'who', 'love', 'unnoticed', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'flashy', 'Society', 'Girl', 'who', 'love', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'laughable', 'now', 'so', 'much', 'known', 'personal', 'life.The', 'film', 'populated', 'memorable', 'actors', '1950s', 'including', 'William', 'Demerest', 'Lori', 'Nelson', 'Lurene', 'Tuttle', 'will', 'also', 'spot', 'unbilled', 'Guy', 'Williams.The', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'participants', 'Lee', 'even', 'on-stage', 'Tap-Dance', 'exit', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'aisles.More', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'have', 'salacious', 'garbage', 'was', 'biopic', 'imagine', 'Lee', 'would', 'prefer', 'be', 'remembered', 'way', 'other', 'way']",Sincerely Yours
1650643,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,B00CS9NI1E,JJ,"[8, 8]","Instead of looking at made for t.v. biographical movies about Liberace, why not see the real thing.  I go back so far that I remember watching his B&W t.v show in the 50s and I saw him once in concert in the early years before he became so flamboyant. I'm glad to say that they toned down the whiney voice for this movie and he seems to be speaking in the lower registers which, as I remember from the concert, was his original voice. This movie was made early in his career and he looks handsome.  He didn't do a bad job of acting.  Actually very little acting was required of him as at least 2/3s of the movie is him playing the piano. This is a remake of an old movie called The Man Who Played God. It's a good story, a bit sappy but then most of the movies in those days, especially those starring entertainers were pretty sappy.  But, it's well done and even touching in several places. It was a perfect vehicle for him.  I'd actually rather watch this movie than DVDs of any of his concerts. It's a nice movie to have to remember a one of a kind entertainer.

1650646,A1RSXQ8KI7RS8B,B00CS9NI1E,Melvyn H. Weinstein,"[0, 2]","As has been stated, this is a remake of a 1930s film with the great George Arliss.  Although 19th Century in his style, he was always fun to watch and some of his films, while dated, are damn good.  He was the first actor to win the Academy Award and retired in the late 30s although he died in 1946.  Liberace remade this film hoping to begin an acting career but it remains only as a curiosity.  I find this film painful to watch.  He was no actor and his later film career, consists of a few snips here and there...see the ""Loved One.""  Liberace was  never able to become a true concert pianist but concentrated on pop music for mostly, a very select but loyal audience.  At the time of this film, his stage style was still fairly conservative.  As his stage persona became more and more flamboyant, he seemed to abandon all attempts to be taken seriously as an actor.  Lee was best when he spoofed himself and played for laughs.
