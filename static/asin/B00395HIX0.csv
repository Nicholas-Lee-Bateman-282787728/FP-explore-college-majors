Instead of women being stalked and killed, here it's mostly guys. And some of them are gay. This movie is just a lot of fun. The only problem I had with it was the ghost subplot. But other than that, this is a refreshing entry in the slasher genre.",5,Best Gay Horror Movie Since Hellbent!,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,357,"['Fraternity', 'Massacre', 'Hell', 'Island', 'humorous', 'throw-back', '80', 'slasher', 'movies', 'only', 'twist', 'Instead', 'women', 'being', 'stalked', 'killed', 'here', 'mostly', 'guys', 'are', 'gay', 'movie', 'just', 'lot', 'fun', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'ghost', 'subplot', 'other', 'refreshing', 'entry', 'slasher', 'genre']",Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island

Well, boy was I fooled. The movie fails to be a comedy horror and fails to be a scary horror movie- it just fails all the way around. The acting is really bad and the movie doesn't really go anywhere. The direction is not good either.  It's very slow moving and near the end you will find yourself fast forwarding to get through the rest of it. I really should have rented this one before buying it because this was a gigantic waste of money. 1/5",1,Huge waste of money and time!

You're hoping for fun, silly trash. Well, that's what I feel like my friends and I got when we watched this movie at a GLBT film festival many years back. We had a good time. Sometimes we still talk about how the old woman in the movie would not call the police to report the killer because they might cut the funding at the mental hospital. This movie is funny. It's definitely not as good as Hellbent, but it is fun.",3,So bad it was good...,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,526,"['When', 'watch', 'movie', 'titled', 'Fraternity', 'Massacre', 'Hell', 'Island', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'fun', 'silly', 'trash', 'Well', 'what', 'feel', 'friends', 'got', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'GLBT', 'film', 'festival', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'still', 'talk', 'how', 'old', 'woman', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'police', 'report', 'killer', 'might', 'cut', 'funding', 'mental', 'hospital', 'movie', 'funny', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Hellbent', 'fun']",Fraternity Massacre at Hell Island

When they ran out of ideas  ,they just put in another  torture and killing to pad out the  film. Predictable and  don't believe the  dvd  sleeve which states that it is loaded with nudity. There is none except for an occassional  backside  view.

They have to pass a test which involves spending the night in a closed amusement park on an island.  Naturally the other fraternity brothers plan to sneak aboard and scare the pledges.  Naturally there's a deranged killer in a clow suit wandering around killing everybody.  And then there's a bunch of ghosts thrown in...Stupid and boring.  For one thing all these actors are way over college age...and look it.  For another the acting is abysmal.  There's not one good acting job here.  The script is hopeless--full of bad jokes and terrible dialogue.  The killings are largely bloodless and not even remotely scary.  The only remotely interesting part of this is a cute guy who has a nude scene at the beginning (back view only)...but that's hardly enough to recommend the movie.
