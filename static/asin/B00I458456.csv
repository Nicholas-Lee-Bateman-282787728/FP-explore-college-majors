The whole family can sit around and watch this and laugh themselves silly. The only drawback i have for the DVD releases , is the home screen where the theme music is blaringly loud  from the rest of the episodes the sound  is fine but man, the main screen for episode selection will startle you and have you scrambling for the remote.

I am a bit ticked off at the way my next 3 orders of DVD's which were low in cost but the shipping was charged separately adding up to an amount that I could have afforded another DVD.I saw the complete collection of Mama's family which I was a young mother when they were all on the air.  I think they did 9 seasons.  if was almost 250.00 wow @ that price who knows but I will get them one as each come out and the prices are lowered after all they are old sitcoms and by cancelling my cable TV I use the funds that I save from not paying over 200 per mo for garbage in and garbage out TV blab shows disrespecting our president at every corner.  I do miss my one channel MSNBC but I can get it online which is kind of funny for it takes only 20 min to do the entire show, where as on TV it last an hour.  yeah commercials ! we pay for it then have to deal with commercials as well.

While today's TV is dominated by politically correct characters and non-offensive storylines that represent every social and racial dynamic, Mama's Family focused more on simple probelms of small town midwest life.  This show set records for being the highest rated syndicated televison show.  It was shown on my network (WSBK-Boston) on Sundays at noon.  It was refreshing to watch a new (albeit syndicated) episode on a Sunday rather than sandwiched in the primetime network schedule.  My favorite years of this sitcom are yet to come (5-6), but Season 4 is on par with Season 3, and if you want in your face one liners, and simple comedy, you have found it!  Vicki Lawrence definitely made the show, but in my opinion the supporting cast is one of the greatest of the 80's, only rivaled by the supporting cast of shows such as Cheers, Taxi, and Three's Company.",5,"I don't know about ""Best show ever,"" but it is very good television.",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1082,"['Contrary', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'putting', 'episode', 'episode', 'review', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'simply', 'state', 'classic', 'TV', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'shows', 'much', 'honesty', 'days', 'today', 'TV', 'dominated', 'politically', 'correct', 'characters', 'non-offensive', 'storylines', 'represent', 'social', 'racial', 'dynamic', 'Mama', 'Family', 'focused', 'more', 'simple', 'probelms', 'small', 'town', 'midwest', 'life', 'show', 'set', 'records', 'being', 'highest', 'rated', 'syndicated', 'televison', 'show', 'was', 'shown', 'network', 'WSBK-Boston', 'Sundays', 'noon', 'was', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'new', 'syndicated', 'episode', 'Sunday', 'rather', 'sandwiched', 'primetime', 'network', 'schedule', 'favorite', 'years', 'sitcom', 'are', 'yet', 'come', '5-6', 'Season', '4', 'par', 'Season', '3', 'want', 'face', 'one', 'liners', 'simple', 'comedy', 'have', 'found', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'definitely', 'made', 'show', 'opinion', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one', 'greatest', '80', 'only', 'rivaled', 'supporting', 'cast', 'shows', 'such', 'Cheers', 'Taxi', 'Three', 'Company']",Mama's Family: Season 4

And it's so much fun that each DVD has a theme to one character/actor. This one is about Iola played by the great Beverly Archer! The ""Mama's Family Tree: The Neighbors"" montage is a lot of fun, because there are also commentaries by e.g. co-executive producer Rick Hawkins (who wrote Went with the Wind! on the Carol Burnett Show and 27 episodes of Mama's Family) and Jim Evering (who wrote 29 episodes of Mama's Family). Of course Beverly's interview gives greater insight into Iola Boylen: from wardrobe to accent! The cast reunion is of course great fun too. The one very minor complaint (if I had to have a complaint) is that there are a few things in this ""part two"" of the reunion that are in ""part one"" on the season 3 DVD, but it doesn't take away from this one.
