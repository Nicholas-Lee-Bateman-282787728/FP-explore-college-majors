Schneider,"[1, 1]","I'm planning a trip to the UK where we will be staying in Scotland for part of the time and are interested in Edinburgh and day trips that would be interesting.  This dvd gets a 4 for sheer fun and the spirit of adventure that the guide provides.  She is young, energetic and up for anything.  Just how travel should be.  Now, would I say this really gave me a lot of sites that I need to add to my agenda?  Eh, not so much.  She covers most of the major areas in Scotland and a very small slice of each, so it isn't really possible to get much of an idea where you would want to spend your time.  The sites she does visit are beautifully photographed and her exuberant nature make you want to go wherever she is going, but as a travel guide, it didn't really help me much. It was more of a fun dvd to watch to see the scenery on a a dvd than a dvd I could really take any notes on must see things.Overall, to just watch it was fun, but if you are looking for a more useful dvd I would go to Rick Steves or my new favorite, Samantha Brown.",3,"sheer fun it gets 4 stars, comprehensive guide 3 stars....",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1039,"[""'m"", 'planning', 'trip', 'UK', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'Scotland', 'part', 'time', 'are', 'interested', 'Edinburgh', 'day', 'trips', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'dvd', '4', 'sheer', 'fun', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'guide', 'young', 'energetic', 'up', 'anything', 'Just', 'how', 'travel', 'should', 'be', 'Now', 'would', 'say', 'really', 'gave', 'lot', 'sites', 'need', 'add', 'agenda', 'Eh', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'most', 'major', 'areas', 'Scotland', 'very', 'small', 'slice', ""n't"", 'really', 'possible', 'get', 'much', 'idea', 'where', 'would', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'sites', 'visit', 'are', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'exuberant', 'nature', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'going', 'travel', 'guide', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'much', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'dvd', 'watch', 'see', 'scenery', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'could', 'really', 'take', 'notes', 'must', 'see', 'things.Overall', 'just', 'watch', 'was', 'fun', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'useful', 'dvd', 'would', 'go', 'Rick', 'Steves', 'new', 'favorite', 'Samantha', 'Brown']",N/A

829844,A3L577V8TY26GN,B0002BSHES,D. Jester,"[2, 2]","To begin with, I read about some other reviewer's annoyance with Megan jumping on a bed yelling woo-hoo. I don't know if what I have is a later, earlier, or newly edited edition, but that is not on it. Megan does sort of fall into a bed when she checks into a nice hotel, and says shes likes the bed, but no jumping on it, so something has changed. In the version I have, she is a bit over-the-top and wide eyed during the intro, but that appears to be done tongue-in-cheek, it looks like she is doing it intentionally and expects the audience to know she is doing it intentionally. She is Globe Trekker's 2nd most popular host, and I personally find her style appealing, perhaps that is more the case for men than for women.The details of Megan's travels are a bit too brief for my taste. There is some good info there, but it could use a bit more depth. The DVD is only 60 minutes, and probably would have been a bit better at 90 or even 120. I believe those lengths could have been achieved by merely spending a bit of extra time in each place, and with extended interviews with some of the people Megan met. One thing I feel may be of limited value to a lot of travellers is when she goes to a couple of events which are only held annually, or only during certain months. This was also true of Rick Steves' Scotland. Coverage of such special events should not necessarily be omitted, but considering most tourists will not be there during those specific time frames, perhaps there should be less time spent on them.",4,"Good Material, but could have been longer",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,1519,"['begin', 'read', 'other', 'reviewer', 'annoyance', 'Megan', 'jumping', 'bed', 'yelling', 'woo-hoo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'have', 'later', 'earlier', 'newly', 'edited', 'edition', 'not', 'Megan', 'sort', 'fall', 'bed', 'when', 'nice', 'hotel', 'shes', 'bed', 'jumping', 'so', 'something', 'changed', 'version', 'have', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'wide', 'eyed', 'intro', 'be', 'done', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'doing', 'intentionally', 'audience', 'know', 'doing', 'intentionally', 'Globe', 'Trekker', '2nd', 'most', 'popular', 'host', 'personally', 'find', 'style', 'appealing', 'perhaps', 'more', 'case', 'men', 'women.The', 'details', 'Megan', 'travels', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'brief', 'taste', 'good', 'info', 'there', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'DVD', 'only', '60', 'minutes', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', '90', 'even', '120', 'believe', 'lengths', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'merely', 'spending', 'bit', 'extra', 'time', 'place', 'extended', 'interviews', 'people', 'Megan', 'met', 'One', 'thing', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'limited', 'value', 'lot', 'travellers', 'when', 'couple', 'events', 'are', 'only', 'held', 'annually', 'only', 'certain', 'months', 'was', 'also', 'true', 'Rick', 'Steves', 'Scotland', 'Coverage', 'such', 'special', 'events', 'should', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'omitted', 'considering', 'most', 'tourists', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'specific', 'time', 'frames', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'less', 'time', 'spent']",N/A

Meagan McCormick was more of a distractionand could have used more tact and subtlety. One getsthe impression that the Scots she interviewed seemedrather annoyed by her overzealousness. But, I knew whatI was in store for when the flighty guide jumpedonto her hotel room bed while yelling ""Woo-hoo!""With the tour guide issue aside, this is a very goodlook at the beautiful green country of Scotland, itsculture and highlights. Along the trip we meet severalinteresting people, such as the woman who plays soothingtunes on her violin to curious seals. Also, we get a quickvisit to Great Britain's largest fresh water lake, LochNess, where a man has dedicated his life to finding the LochNess monster, or ""Nessie"" as they sometimes call the mythicalserpent.

829847,A2CPM6WTF7PO3G,B0002BSHES,"Red Xala ""~23~""","[1, 1]","When I borrowed a copy of this DVD from my local library, I didn't initially realize that that it was part of the Globe Trekker travel collection.  I'm generally ambivalent about the travel shows produced by Globe Trekker, and I became even more skeptical when I realized that the host was Megan McCormick.  I've seen her on previous shows, and the first thought that ran through my head was ""Oh no, not this annoying woman!""  In the end, however, she was better than I expected - not great, but palatable. (However, after watching the DVD a second time, I have to agree with other reviewers that she seems to be insipidly shouting ""woo hoo!"" somewhat regularly throughout the documentary, and it does become annoying).  Perhaps the biggest flaw with the DVD is that they attempt to cover nearly all of the regions of Scotland in one hour - this is pure folly!  I've been to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and these two cities alone are worthy of their own multiple disc series.  They really should have only selected one city or a single region if they were restricted to only one hour.I was very much looking forward to the coverage of the Orkney Islands and other northern regions of the country.  However, in the end, nothing is covered in any sort of depth; all that the viewer is given is a generally shallow, and somewhat stereotypical view of this wonderful country.
