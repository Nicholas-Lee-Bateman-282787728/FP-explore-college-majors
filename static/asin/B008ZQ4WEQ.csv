1578942,A3DX9NMSGCBUVR,B008ZQ4WEQ,"Amazon Customer ""Pureone""","[2, 2]",I liked this movie but I watched the deleted scenes to see if I could get a better understanding of what was happening.They deleted the wrong scenes. It was so much clearer when I watched the deleted scenes. I also thought that the music could have been better to support the story. I was a good story and I liked the characters but it seemed like a first try at movie making. I wish they could get some help on polishing it up.,4,Good movie but poor editing,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,428,"['liked', 'movie', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'see', 'could', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'happening.They', 'deleted', 'wrong', 'scenes', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'clearer', 'when', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'thought', 'music', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'support', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'liked', 'characters', 'seemed', 'first', 'try', 'movie', 'making', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'help', 'polishing', 'up']",As I Stand

The idea of the movie was really good, and the acting wasn't too bad, other than the attack early in the movie - could they have made a stabbing/mugging look any more faked? I even liked most of  the characters, other than the sister. She was so bland with her personality and acting, I about fell asleep during her parts.Overall, the plot stunk.
