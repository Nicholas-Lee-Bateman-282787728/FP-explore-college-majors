1440767,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0053XZ8O2,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I'm as shocked as anyone else here who has given this a high rating.  I was pretty certain upon hearing about this movie that it was going to be terrible.  It just looked so stupid.  That said, I'm always game to try anything once, and the reviews were shockingly kind to a film about a man communicating through a puppet.  What I found was a film that was far more profound and moving than expected.  Despite a few slip ups and some confused plot points, this film works remarkably well and delivers the unexpected, which is a good thing from time to time.`The Beaver' centers on Walter Black, a depressed CEO of a toy company who has swallowed himself up in his shell of a soul and repelled those closest to him thanks to the darkest of depression.  He sleeps, a lot, and barely notices his family to the point where his eldest son despises him, his youngest son feels abandoned and his wife finally kicks him out.  With the light completely snuffed, Walter contemplates suicide, but not before he finds a beaver puppet in a dumpster and for some odd reason decides to take it to the hotel with him.  The beaver then begins to speak through him to him and next thing you know Walter Black has disappeared and is replaced by a British beaver who allows Walter to escape the parts of himself he loathes and replace them with a confidence and sass unbeknownst to him.  While this concept is initially bizarre to those who love him, it eventually allows everyone to escape, until it crosses a line and overstays its welcome and then, well, ""stuff happens"".As a whole, `The Beaver' is surprisingly astute and really develops its central theme nicely.  This is aided by a phenomenal performance by Mel Gibson.  This guy has gotten a really bad rap (deservedly so as of late) and so it seems like the world roots for him to fail (which is probably why this film did nothing at the box office) but one should be able to separate professional from personal life, and there is no denying that Gibson attacks this performance with a ferocity needed to sell it every step of the way.  He underscores his character's depression with an authenticity that makes you believe his pain.  It actually reminded me a bit of Rourke's turn in `The Wrestler' in that whole `art imitating life' sort of way.  When `The Wrestler' was released it was all about how Rourke was basically playing himself in a way that was therapeutic.  The same is probably true for Gibson here.  This character's free-fall from the brink of sanity is a figurative, fictional representation of Gibson's own mental state.  But, what Gibson does that is so commendable is that he never shies away from baring a piece of himself in every facet of this film, and while the film never victimizes or vilifies Walter and his actions, Gibson finds a way to do both beautifully.  We can feel for the hopeless and helpless state that Walter finds himself and yet we can see the destructive tones that are brought in with the introduction of The Beaver himself.  The way that Gibson contorts his face in sheer bafflement while the words leaving his mouth are so confident and commanding is just sensational, and the way that he comes over to the power of the puppet on his hand is hard to ignore.  I'm stunned at the layers of depth he found in shading this man's mental decline, and while the film's resolution is a tad too brief (why did this have to be so short?) I felt as if Gibson found a way to explain far more than the film was actually willing to tell us.But as great as Gibson is, and as intriguing and compelling as the plot is, there are some weaknesses.  The side plot involving the toy company and the beaver inspired toy is a tad too obvious, and the plot revolving around Black's son and his love interest is unnecessary.  This film had a chance to maintain focus and instead it veered in the wrong ways, and when you have a running length that is under two hours (it is barely an hour and a half) then you need to keep sharp focus so as to get a fuller impact.  The graduation speech that results from the love-story is also cringe-worthy in its obviousness.Still, this is a much stronger film than one may initially expect and so I highly recommend checking it out!",4,This was actually...good?,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,4229,"[""'m"", 'as', 'shocked', 'anyone', 'else', 'here', 'who', 'given', 'high', 'rating', 'was', 'pretty', 'certain', 'hearing', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'just', 'looked', 'so', 'stupid', 'said', ""'m"", 'always', 'game', 'try', 'anything', 'once', 'reviews', 'were', 'shockingly', 'kind', 'film', 'man', 'communicating', 'puppet', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'profound', 'moving', 'expected', 'few', 'slip', 'ups', 'confused', 'plot', 'points', 'film', 'remarkably', 'well', 'unexpected', 'good', 'thing', 'time', 'time.', 'Beaver', 'centers', 'Walter', 'Black', 'depressed', 'CEO', 'toy', 'company', 'who', 'swallowed', 'up', 'shell', 'soul', 'repelled', 'closest', 'thanks', 'darkest', 'depression', 'lot', 'barely', 'family', 'point', 'where', 'eldest', 'son', 'youngest', 'son', 'feels', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'finally', 'out', 'light', 'completely', 'snuffed', 'Walter', 'suicide', 'not', 'beaver', 'puppet', 'dumpster', 'odd', 'reason', 'decides', 'take', 'hotel', 'beaver', 'then', 'speak', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Walter', 'Black', 'disappeared', 'replaced', 'British', 'beaver', 'who', 'Walter', 'escape', 'parts', 'replace', 'confidence', 'sass', 'unbeknownst', 'concept', 'initially', 'bizarre', 'who', 'love', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'escape', 'line', 'welcome', 'then', 'well', 'stuff', 'happens', '.As', 'whole', 'Beaver', 'surprisingly', 'astute', 'really', 'central', 'theme', 'nicely', 'aided', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'guy', 'gotten', 'really', 'bad', 'rap', 'deservedly', 'so', 'late', 'so', 'world', 'roots', 'fail', 'probably', 'why', 'film', 'did', 'nothing', 'box', 'office', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'separate', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'denying', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'ferocity', 'needed', 'sell', 'step', 'way', 'character', 'depression', 'authenticity', 'believe', 'pain', 'actually', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Rourke', 'turn', 'Wrestler', 'whole', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'sort', 'way', 'When', 'Wrestler', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'how', 'Rourke', 'was', 'basically', 'playing', 'way', 'was', 'therapeutic', 'same', 'probably', 'true', 'Gibson', 'here', 'character', 'free-fall', 'brink', 'sanity', 'figurative', 'fictional', 'representation', 'Gibson', 'own', 'mental', 'state', 'what', 'Gibson', 'so', 'commendable', 'never', 'away', 'baring', 'piece', 'facet', 'film', 'film', 'never', 'vilifies', 'Walter', 'actions', 'Gibson', 'way', 'do', 'beautifully', 'can', 'feel', 'hopeless', 'helpless', 'state', 'Walter', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'destructive', 'tones', 'are', 'brought', 'introduction', 'Beaver', 'way', 'Gibson', 'face', 'sheer', 'bafflement', 'words', 'leaving', 'mouth', 'are', 'so', 'confident', 'commanding', 'just', 'sensational', 'way', 'power', 'puppet', 'hand', 'hard', 'ignore', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'layers', 'depth', 'found', 'shading', 'man', 'mental', 'decline', 'film', 'resolution', 'tad', 'too', 'brief', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'short', 'felt', 'Gibson', 'found', 'way', 'explain', 'far', 'more', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'willing', 'tell', 'us.But', 'as', 'great', 'Gibson', 'intriguing', 'compelling', 'plot', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'side', 'plot', 'involving', 'toy', 'company', 'beaver', 'inspired', 'toy', 'tad', 'too', 'obvious', 'plot', 'revolving', 'Black', 'son', 'love', 'interest', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'had', 'chance', 'maintain', 'focus', 'instead', 'veered', 'wrong', 'ways', 'when', 'have', 'running', 'length', 'two', 'hours', 'barely', 'hour', 'half', 'then', 'need', 'keep', 'sharp', 'focus', 'so', 'get', 'fuller', 'impact', 'graduation', 'speech', 'results', 'love-story', 'also', 'cringe-worthy', 'obviousness.Still', 'much', 'stronger', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'initially', 'expect', 'so', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1440771,A27F1WYCM6IEYH,B0053XZ8O2,Colten,"[0, 0]","It is about Walter Black, who copes with depression by speaking in a Cockney accent through a beaver hand puppet that he affixes to his left hand and leaves on at all times-whether Walter is in the shower, at the office or having sex. The movie's name and plot generate all sorts of connotations, and none of them suggest what the film actually is: A delicately told, insightful drama about metal illness that stand as one of the biggest, best surprises of 2011.Something that was not a surprise, however, is how few people found out first-hand what an unexpected marvel they were overlooking. Aside from its name and subject mater, The Beaver had another major road block in its box office outlook: Mel Gibson. So much of an actor's career relies on likability, and the Oscar-winning actor did not help himself in that department by having numerous, widely-covered incidents that suggest he is an angry, homophobic Anti-Semite. Those characteristics have made some people want to have nothing to do with him of his work, no matter what the movie.If people are ever willing to give Gibson another chance on-scree, The Beaver is the time to do it. Gibson gives on of his best performances as Walter, who opens the movie floating on a raft in a pool but does not look relaxed. Walter looks drained. This is not a man who has thrived in the two years he has worked as head honcho of his dad's toy company, since his father's suicide. He has been worn down by a job for which he was ill-prepared and that has driven him to a state of depression which has alienated his sons Porter and Henry, and left his wife Meredith wondering if the man she loves will ever return to the way he used to be.Cue the title character, a hand puppet that Walter spots in a dumpster, and, for whatever reason, feels compelled to pick up and put on his hand. It does not stop Walter from trying to hang himself from a shower rod in a hotel after he leaves his house, but, after that suicide attempt doesn't work, Walter's attempt to jump from his hotel balcony is thwarted when the beaver talks to him. Of course, that is Walter talking for the beaver, who, in the aforementioned accent, tell Walter that he is here to save his &#34;god-damn life.&#34; Foster's direction and Kyle Killen's script treat this very unusual situation with exactly the right tone: What begins with the slightest bit of humour, as Walter cheerfully speaks only through the beaver and Henry delights in spending time with both, quickly becomes far more serious and urgent as the family accepts that this is really happening. Some mild comfort comes from the index card that Walter provides, explaining that the beaver is actually a prescription puppet as recommended by a mental health professional in order to establish a psychological distance between Walter and negative aspects of his personality. Too bad the card is a lie, and Walter actually has not been to see a doctor in more than a year.As all of this is happening, Porter continues to chart all the ways in which he is like his father in an effort to then eliminate them from his life. While many teenagers feel detached from and annoyed by their parents, Porter hates his father for the things that Porter hates about himself. The adds even more weight to Walter's struggle to regain his mental health and perhaps reestablish a bond with his firs-born. Until the, Porter is occupied by his commissioned task to write a graduation speech for the valedictorian Norah, who feels she does not know what to say or how to say it. The fact that she is beautiful increases Porter's interest in helping her, even though she also agrees to pay him $500 for the job. Though some viewers may doubt the progression of Porter and Norah's relationship, it is actually an intelligently crafted dynamic between a girl with bottled-up emotions and a guy who is bold and articulate enough to help her release a huge weight from her shoulders.Perhaps it is a stretch that Henry's excitement about the beaver inspires Walter to develop a new, company-saving kid's toy, which in reality might not even be moderately successful. Walter's colleagues' lack of protest about their boss' new style also seems far-fetched. The achievement of The Beaver, however, is not necessarily in crafting an air-tight realistic story. It is about chronicling the way that depression eats away at the self and that person's support system-this is reiterated in that the Blacks' house is literally falling apart, a metaphor that is a bit too obvious. One of the reasons depression can be hard to recognise is the same reason it is hard to portray on screen: This is an illness that is very hard to identify based on physical changes. Yet Gibson and the film dare to acknowledge the anguished emptiness that comes from depression and the lack of easy answers. Meredith tells Walter she needs to know that his old self is going to come back, and she even shows him photos of their 20th anniversary dinner to try to help him remember how happy their lives used to be. The beaver, dressed in a tiny, custom-made tuxedo of his own, is not having it. He reminds Meredith that Walter does not have amnesia, he has depression. It is a sickness that can not be fixed by flipping a switch, but it is one that can be better understood through daring films like The Beaver, whose blissful last scene is a fantasy of the way a person with mental illness, or a person who loves a person with mental illness, dream their lives might someday be again.",5,"Go ahead.

1440773,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0053XZ8O2,DanD,"[3, 4]","Jodie Foster's THE BEAVER is, among many other things, a very intriguing film.  A middle-aged man suffering from depression, Walter Black (a very nuanced performance by Mel Gibson) is at the end of his rope (or, in an uncomfortably-funny scene, his tie).  His oldest son despises him, his wife can't understand him, and his employees don't respect him.  Thrown out of his house, Walter discovers a Beaver puppet in a Dumpster.  After a drunken night that ends poorly, Walter's psyche slowly surrenders to that of the Beaver (who features a voice eerily similar to Gibson's EDGE OF DARKNESS costar Ray Winstone).  At first, Black's family (and the world) welcomes this upbeat change.  But things slowly turn for the worst, as they generally do, and Black must choose between himself and the Beaver.  Assuming he even has a choice anymore.The acting here is fairly solid.  Gibson is reliably admirable.  Normally, I am in favor of disassociating an actor from his public identity; art for art's sake and all that.  But Gibson's reputation actually lends a sense of poignancy to his performance, as Black takes the Beaver public on ""The Today Show.""  Foster is strong as Black's wife; Anton Yelchin is superb as his oldest son, though he's wasted in an unnecessary subplot involving a straight-A student with doubts (an equally fantastic Jennifer Lawrence).  This subplot is indicative of the film's major flaw (hence the three stars): like Walter Black, the film is suffering something of an identity crisis.  Dark comedy or poignant self-discovery flick?  It meanders back and forth, ultimately settling on the latter (there's a gripping climax, but the denouement is definitely a let-down).  By the film's end, it sounds like a depression-awareness piece, a tactic that is clearly below the talent levels of everyone involved.  THE BEAVER is an oddity--in a good way--but not odd enough; it tries to settle for feel-good drama, and it shouldn't.  There's something very, very uncomfortable about a man who walks around with a beaver puppet on his hand.  At its best moments, THE BEAVER addresses this awkwardness and runs with it; at its worst (and there are too many of these), it ignores the absurdity and plays straight, making this a mixed-bag of a film, but one worth at least a viewing or two.",3,"""I'm the Beaver, Walter, and I'm here to save your g****** life.""",1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,2299,"['Jodie', 'Foster', 'THE', 'BEAVER', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'very', 'intriguing', 'film', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'suffering', 'depression', 'Walter', 'Black', 'very', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'end', 'rope', 'uncomfortably-funny', 'scene', 'tie', 'oldest', 'son', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'employees', 'do', ""n't"", 'respect', 'Thrown', 'house', 'Walter', 'Beaver', 'puppet', 'Dumpster', 'drunken', 'night', 'poorly', 'Walter', 'psyche', 'slowly', 'surrenders', 'Beaver', 'who', 'voice', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Gibson', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'costar', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'first', 'Black', 'family', 'world', 'upbeat', 'change', 'things', 'slowly', 'turn', 'worst', 'generally', 'do', 'Black', 'must', 'choose', 'Beaver', 'Assuming', 'even', 'choice', 'anymore.The', 'acting', 'here', 'fairly', 'solid', 'Gibson', 'reliably', 'admirable', 'Normally', 'am', 'favor', 'disassociating', 'actor', 'public', 'identity', 'art', 'art', 'sake', 'Gibson', 'reputation', 'actually', 'sense', 'poignancy', 'performance', 'Black', 'Beaver', 'public', 'Today', 'Show', 'Foster', 'strong', 'Black', 'wife', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'superb', 'oldest', 'son', 'wasted', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'involving', 'straight-A', 'student', 'doubts', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'subplot', 'indicative', 'film', 'major', 'flaw', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', 'Walter', 'Black', 'film', 'suffering', 'something', 'identity', 'crisis', 'Dark', 'comedy', 'poignant', 'self-discovery', 'flick', 'back', 'forth', 'ultimately', 'settling', 'latter', 'gripping', 'climax', 'denouement', 'definitely', 'let-down', 'film', 'end', 'depression-awareness', 'piece', 'tactic', 'clearly', 'talent', 'levels', 'everyone', 'involved', 'BEAVER', 'oddity', 'good', 'way', 'not', 'odd', 'enough', 'settle', 'feel-good', 'drama', 'should', ""n't"", 'something', 'very', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'man', 'who', 'beaver', 'puppet', 'hand', 'best', 'moments', 'THE', 'BEAVER', 'awkwardness', 'worst', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'absurdity', 'plays', 'straight', 'making', 'mixed-bag', 'film', 'one', 'worth', 'least', 'viewing', 'two']",N/A

1440775,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0053XZ8O2,David Baldwin,"[2, 5]","I was diagnosed with depression about ten years ago.  You can't really explain the malady except that it's a genetic chemical imbalance of the brain.  When confronted with the diagnosis it was a shock to the system.  It was rough going at first but after years of therapy and, yes, medication I'm a fully functioing member of society.  There are good days and bad days but the good outweigh the bad.  With that confessional I viewed ""The Beaver"" with special interest.  Would it be sensitive to the plight of millions of depression sufferers or would it be exploitative or, even worse, get it wrong?  Happily the film gets it right.  The film begins as toy manufacturer Walter Black(Mel Gibson) is in crisis maintaining a hellish existence in a motel room separated from a loving but long suffering wife (Jodie Foster) and two children who are angry or confused at their father's condition.  Walter finds a hand puppet in the trash and a light switch goes off.  With this inanimate object Walter can project self confidence that he couldn't being himself.  Worlds open up to Walter but is the puppet the answer or merely a mask for his self loathing?  Gibson is brilliant here showing the many hues of Walter.  The puppet, simply known as the Beaver, can emit a chipper demeanor and you can't take your eyes off him.  That said, look at the man behind the curtain and you see a sad confused individual.  Kudos go out as well to Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence as two smart teens who have to bear the slings and arrows that life has dealt them.  Foster, who also directed the film, keeps the proceedings at an even keel fully aware that the subject of her film reverberates with more than you can imagine.  I also liked Kyle Killen's knowing script that sheds light on depression.  Some would avoid this film because of recent public comments and behaviors of Gibson.

1440777,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0053XZ8O2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","It has been many years since actress Jodie Foster had directed a film.  Her 1991 directorial debut ""Little Man Tate"" and her 1995 comedy ""Home for the Holidays"" were her last two.But this time around Foster takes on a psychological comedy/drama with ""The Beaver"".The film revolves around the Black family, Walter Black (played by Mel Gibson) is a toy executive who is clinically depressed and is literally has withdrawn himself from life.May it be trauma or a chemical imbalance, Black feels that going to a psychiatrist, repeating the same pill taking routine and thinking life is absolutely terrible, despite having a successful career and a loving family.But his depression has taken its toll on his family.His wife Meredith (played by Jodie Foster) who feels that her husband has been away for the last two years has focused her energy on her engineering career and developing a roller coaster with her Tokyo clients; their eldest son Porter (played by Anton Yelchin) is a college student who is paid to write reports for other students but also has been cataloging the similarities of his dad's depression with his own and their younger son Henry (played by Riley Thomas Stewart) wants his father healthy again and while at school, is often bullied.Needless to say, the Black family has become quite dysfunctional to the point that Meredith has no choice but to have Walter move out of the house.Walter checks into a hotel and throws away nearly everything except a beaver hand puppet.  One day as he tries to kill himself but is unsuccessful.  He ends up injuring himself instead and knocking himself out cold.  When he wakes up, he is awaken by the beaver puppet known as ""The Beaver"", an alternate personality which allows Walter to communicate with people.With the Beaver, Walter lets the people he communicates with know that it is a way for him to clinically help him through severe depression.  Walter tells his wife that it was recommended to him by his psychiatrist.And immediately, The Beaver helps bring Walter back from the darkness as he is able to reconnect with his son and his wife and also the people of the toy company that he runs.Walter through the Beaver is able to make a return back to society and also come up with a brilliant toy idea bringing the highest profits for his ailing toy company but also establishing the bond with his family.But how long will Walter have to depend on the beaver and what happens when the beaver starts to take control of his life?VIDEO:""The Beaver"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  Picture quality is very good, definitely feels as if there was a cooling filter applied to make things a bit more blue but it does fit the emotional atmosphere of the film.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are very deep and I didn't notice any speckles or artifacting.For the most part, the picture quality for ""The Beaver"" is very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Beaver"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.  The lossless soundtrack is primarily front and center-channel driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear but sometimes there were moments where I needed to have subtitling on as I felt I was missing some dialogue during conversations.  There is a good amount of ambiance featured through the surround channels.  For example, when Porter is at school, you can hear the crowds at school through the surround channels.  Also, during Porter banging his head on the wall can be heard.For the most part, the lossless soundtrack is adequate for this type of film and for the most part audio quality is very good.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Beaver"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an in-depth commentary by director Jodie Foster.Deleted Scenes - (4:52) Featuring two deleted scenes: Role Play and Puppet Pull with optional commentary by director Jodie Foster.Everything is Going to Be OK - (12:06) Director Jodie Foster talks about the film, the characters and the cast.  The cast talk about their involvement in the film.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Beaver"" is an intriguing film that tends to blend in comedy with psychological drama and sometimes it works (if more as a comedy ala ""The Cable Guy"") but as a serious film, especially about depression, some may feel it's a bit farfetched as a man would become internationally popular because he holds a puppet to deal with his severe depression.In this day and age, depression affects a lot of people and many get treatment or take the medicine needed to help them deal with the illness.  ""The Beaver"" in the other hand, while interesting, tries to show a juxtaposition of the main character Walter, as he deals with his sickness via the alternate personality he has created.  And to see the other side via his son Porter, who worries that he may have the same sickness that his father had.And there was one scene that was very important was that His father and his father and his father's father had the illness as well.  So, there is that connection of family history of depression.But ""The Beaver"" is a film that I felt was underdeveloped.  Listening to the audio commentary, Jodie Foster mentioned of having to decide if Walter's depression should be explained.  I felt that for many people, severe depression for those not familiar with it, may be thought as how one feels for a temporary amount of time and not thinking that it is a serious illness that must be treated.  The film needed to show that destination of pain and withdrawal but the opening skims through it too quickly.  Yes, we know he's depressed but viewers needed to know how badly it has been right off the bat.The other storyline revolves around Porter and Norah, the girl he likes.  We know that Walter's family has been affected by his severe depression and for his son, not having his father but also for Porter having to worry about having depression and cataloging the similarities that he has with his father, it's an understandable storyline.  But what is a bit off is more of him trying to help Norah, which involves her deceased brother.  And I felt that this emotional withdrawal on her end is understandable but once again, a character's storyline that was underdeveloped.I felt the screenplay needed a bit more work and it does hurt the movie.  But I will say that it's saving grace was Mel Gibson.  We know that Jodie Foster is an awesome actress but at the time this film was released, Mel Gibson was no doubt seen as the public enemy in Hollywood because of the situations going on in his personal life.  Does anyone want to see a Mel Gibson movie after all that has happened to him offscreen?  Needless to say, he may not be a fan favorite any longer but he is still one heck of an actor and his performance made this film work.It's great to see Jodie Foster back as a director.  She is one of the most highly experienced talents in the world today that has been working in the industry since she was in a child and has starred in many box office hits and critically-acclaimed films. But while the storyline is intriguing, mixing comedy and psychological drama is not an easy thing to do, especially when it becomes more serious.  But I think it's the challenge that probably led her to direct the film.And as for the Blu-ray, it's great to have an audio commentary and featurettes that showcase Foster the director as opposed to the actress.  Picture quality is very good as with the audio quality as well.While ""The Beaver"" may not be a box-office hit, overall ""The Beaver"" is an intriguing film with its solid moments of wonderful acting courtesy of both Gibson and Foster.  While not a great film and has its problems with its underdeveloped screenplay, it's still a film worth checking out.",3,"Blu-ray (3.5 stars): A solid performance by Mel Gibson, although the

This movie was like that. Really tragic on one level, but can't help but burst out laughing at times at the ridiculousness of it. Walter (Mel Gibson) is a severely depressed father, husband, and CEO who bangs his head during a botched suicide attempt and starts to hear voices, well one voice, that of ""The Beaver"" - a large rather manic hand puppet permanently affixed to his left arm. Jody Foster does a nice job in a subdued role of mother and wife who plays off and lets the exceptional newcomer child actors and Gibson (as her husband) shine. There is a wonderful teen romance sub-plot as well. The adolescent son is such a unique and engaging supporting character as he struggles to separate from a father who he is very much like. This is the most original film I've seen in very a long time (other than one scene that was quite Fight-club-like). It was pretty clear from the start that everything was not going be okay.

1440783,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0053XZ8O2,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","Writer Kyle Killen and Director/actress Jodie Foster are two brave souls - to create a film about the serious psychological illness of Depression is a tough assignment alone, but to select as the star of this film the beleaguered sociopathic actor Mel Gibson whose appeal to audiences is at an all time low was an even testier decision.  The result of all of these preparatory decisions is that the film works - very well.  This may be the finest performance by Gibson on film and in many ways that is due to the faith and friendship of his defender and friend Jodie Foster.  Drop preconceived biases and see this rather extraordinary film: it will not leave your conscienceWalter Black (Mel Gibson) is a severely depressed new CEO-by-inheritance of a toy company, partnered by the wise and understanding Vice President (Cherry Jones).  He is unable to work at eh level expected and prefers to just stay in bed all day, escaping reality.  His wife Meredith (Jodie Foster) has tolerated his condition for too long and decides to leave him, taking their sons,  adolescent bright but insecure Porter (Anton Yelchin) and young Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) with her.  Walter drinks far too much and in his bleak despair unsuccessfully attempts suicide by hanging, stopped only by the communication of a Beaver hand puppet Walter found in the dumpster who remains on Walter's hand and speaks to Walter through Walter's voice (which sounds strangely similar to Michael Caine!).  With the at times comedic lines  and advice from Beaver, Walter gains the strength to re-enter the world: the Beaver is his alter ego and provides a line of demarcation between the real world and the one Walter simply cannot manage alone.  The Beaver allows him to become a valuable force in his business while allowing him to re-connect with Meredith - a closeness they have not had in years - but always through the voice of the Beaver.  The one person who cannot cope with the faade is  Porter - a lad who is making it through life by writing papers for fellow students and ultimately is asked to write the graduation speech for the beautiful but bruised Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) - opening another subplot about coming of age and dealing with emotional baggage on the part of both Porter and Norah.  How Walter finally deals with the Beaver who seems to be preventing him from living an honest existence ties all the fragile threads of this story together.Jodie Foster knows just how far to let each of her actors take their roles and in the end she has woven a tapestry about the tragedy of the diagnosis of depression  and its effect on a family that will be difficult to match.  Each of the actors gives razor sharp performances, but it is the baggage-laden Gibson who creates a character stronger than anything he has ever done before.  Life lessons learned? It doesn't matter. Take the film for what it is  - a brilliant exploration of familial love - and the rest is yesterday's lunch.

I'm sure any of us with loved ones who suffer a mental illness are thinking ""we'll take ANYTHING that works"", but watch 1 1/2 hours of a beaver puppet, and you'll see that it is not an answer unless you ARE the CEO of a very successful company and nobody is going to argue with you.

1440790,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0053XZ8O2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 6]","Walter Black (Mel Gibson) is the CEO of a once-successful toy company who has become so hopelessly depressed that all he does is sleep. In addition to his company going under, his marriage to Meredith (Jodie Foster) is falling apart and she quietly kicks him out. Hitting rock bottom, Walter happens upon a beaten-up beaver hand-puppet that begins ""talking"" when he slips it on his hand. The next day Walter hands his family a card explaining that the beaver is ""designed to create a psychological distance between himself and the negative aspects of his personality"" and that the beaver should be addressed rather than Walter himself. When the beaver starts speaking, in a British accent that sounds like Ray Winstone in a too-similar-to-be-coincidental way, there's no cinematic trickery involved to create a superficial illusion. Walter is clearly working the puppet's mouth and his own mouth clearly moves to speak for the beaver. While their teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) is unable to accept his father's ""toy,"" their youngest son Henry loves the puppet, prompting Meredith to accept Walter and the beaver. With the beaver's ""help,"" Walter attempts to revitalize both his company and his marriage. In a parallel plot thread,  romance blossoms between Porter and Norah (Jennifer Lawrence), the school valedictorian, after she asks him to write her graduation speech.Somewhere within The Beaver lurks a good, perhaps great film that has all the ingredients necessary to be one, but somewhere down the line loses its way. It's not that the script by Kyle Killen and its wacky premise asks too much of the audience, as it's handled remarkably well for how off-the-wall it is, but the script is the weakest point in what is mostly a strong film. The film is billed as a ""comedy-drama,"" which is fine if you settle on a tone and roll with it. The material could be very dark, but is handled in a straight-forward manner that is not particularly comedic and never dramatic enough. Sticking to one genre would've proven much more effective. The Beaver  just never quite finds its footing, and when it does push the dark undercurrent to the forefront it quickly withdraws from it. Furthermore, it's a complicated story that isn't done justice with its 85-minute running time. There seems to be something special here, but this just feels like the condensed version. The performances are great though!The Beaver marks Jodie Foster's return to directing after a 16-year absence and is the first major, post-controversy role for Mel Gibson. The film would fall apart if not for the performances and Foster's steady, confident direction. As Meredith, Foster fashions a character who supports her husband under such strange circumstances without incident. Her performance never suggests that her acceptance of Walter is out of the ordinary and in that respect, it's an endearing performance full of strength and warmth. Yelchin and Lawrence have a cute rapport with each other and both young actors give convincingly mature performances. Lawrence especially has been on a role in the last year and continues to show that she more range than just about any other actress her age. She has quite the career ahead of her.Walter is a complicated character, as not much is known about him. There's little insight into how he was before, what (if anything) triggered the depression, and he spends much of the film hiding behind the voice of the Beaver. This is a daunting task for an actor, spending the majority of a film talking through a hand-puppet and yet Gibson pulls it off marvelously without ever being campy. His sympathetic performance may actually sway those who have found him less than sympathetic in recent years. I'd say that Gibson's role through almost the entire movie is Walter as the Beaver and he makes this plight convincing, even with a script that gives him little to work with. Gibson relies heavily on his face and eyes to play Walter, establishing the character with just a few expressions. But when the beaver is speaking for Walter, a closer look at Gibson's eyes suggest the demons within. It's an Oscar-caliber performance, full of the depth that the film itself is lacking.Killen's script jumps immediately into the plot, dedicating little time to fleshing out the characters before leaving them at the mercy of the story. They are developed well enough under the circumstances, mostly due to the strength of the actors, but Killen doesn't give them much room to breathe. He pushes the novelty overboard in the third act, with a brief shift in tone that could have brought The Beaver to a much more poignant, emotional climax. A re-write dedicating more time to the characters would have been beneficial. Burrowing deeper into their psyches, expanding them to give the audience more of a reason to care and this would've been really interesting.There are emotional moments; moments of passion, moments of power, but you're hit with it all so quickly that it doesn't quite gel. With so much good, it's unfortunate The Beaver doesn't live up to its full potential. Foster's direction and the exceptional cast improve tremendously on the material and it's well made, with straight-forward direction that eschews anything flashy. Unfortunately, the bottom line is that The Beaver is an admirable film that simply begins too quickly and ends too soon.GRADE: C+",3,There's a Strong Film There Somewhere,1312848000,"08 9,

Mel Gibson's character is depressed with life and it affects his work and family.  He finds this beaver puppet in the trash, and he lets his subconscious do the talking for him through the puppet.  He motivates himself by talking through the puppet, and while people view it as kind of quirky, he becomes a better person, wins his family back and gets his life back on track to the point where he doesn't need the puppet anymore.  So he tosses it in the trash, symbolizing that he is letting go of the thing that helped him cross the bridge of his former depressed self to the new and improved self.  Then someone else who is down on their luck finds it, and we get the idea that the puppet improves the lives of those who happen to come across it.  This movie?  Not so much.Look; I'm not saying every movie should be typical Hollywood, happy-go-lucky with a sun-shiny ending where everything turns out perfectly and roses and flowers and all is right with the world.  I enjoy movies that are challenging and daring, and don't mind if a movie doesn't end on a happy note - just make the journey pleasant and satisfying.  Let's not confuse dysfunctional with challenging - this movie was bad.  The kind of ""I can't believe I just sat through this movie, and this was the outcome??"" bad.I took a chance on this movie, thinking that it might be some pleasantly surprising jem of a dark comedy (like ""World's Greatest Dad"") and that maybe the public got it wrong.  Nope; the public was spot on and I see why this movie flopped.  Bad, bad, bad.In all fairness, the actors all gave fine performances.  It's just the story I had an issue with, and not to give too much away, didn't realize how psycho Mel Gibon's character would get with the puppet.

Mel Gibson's Walter is depression personified.  In fact, Walter is so desperately depressed that it almost seems this puppet takes Walter on as if the puppet, itself,  was alive.  Why should this be curious?  Well, the puppet talks, but Walter moves his lips - no ventriloquist tricks here.  The `Beaver' looks like a mangy, dirty puppet he found on the street, because that's where he found him. Still, I got caught up in the dialogue and the story.  Walter convinced me he was sad, and, interestingly enough, so did Gibson.  With so many marriages  on the fritz today, so many children caught up in the divorce wars, it was refreshing to watch this family love and hate each other toward some kind of heart human ending.Jodi Foster directed and acted as Walter's `I can't take it anymore' wife.  What a beautiful woman.  She certainly got the best out of Gibson in the film.  Anton Yelchin was excellent as Walter's son who made a very long, very depressing list of what he had in common with his dad.  Afterwards, he worked on ventilating his room.  I enjoyed watching Jennifer Lawrence (of Winter's Bone) play such a different role.While there were laugh-out-loud moments, this movie becomes very serious.  And, I must reiterate, for those of us who have suffered depression of significant duration, there may be an enduring poignance at the apex.  For what wouldn't one do to rid oneself of the very thing ...This film is absolutely worth seeing.  Gibson shows us his skills as an actor.

He is a dead man walking - not living, but existing in a dark place... until he finds a hand-puppet in a dumpster. The puppet is named `The Beaver' and it becomes a part of Walter, helping him to feel alive again. The Beaver helps to make good things happen, but this puppet also causes more trouble in a family already dealing with way more than they can handle.I didn't see this movie in the theater (no particular reason; just didn't go) and I do not own the DVD or Blu-ray. Amazon Instant Video is how I chose to view The Beaver. Mel Gibson gives a believable performance. I felt so bad for Walter Black, especially during the scene in the restaurant with his wife, Meredith(Jodie Foster). There was also a scene that I'm guessing was supposed to be sad and it was, but Gibson also made it a bit funny even though what was taking place wouldn't be funny at all in real life. And Walter wasn't the only character who was in pain. His oldest son was dealing with his own issues - showing that depression can be hereditary - and there was another character who, at first sight, I never expected to be hurting inside. The storyline with the teens was as interesting as Walter's storyline and it was thought-provoking. In fact, the entire movie gives the viewer a lot to think about.The Beaver is a puppet, but I do not believe this is a movie for children.

I hated everyone and everything in it, except Mel Gibson. I even hated the continuity person for making a huge error.In the ""making of"" feature on the disc, Jodie Foster talks of ""wit and humor"" several times. I didn't see an iota of either in the entire movie.The worst error in this movie is that there is a crucial piece of information missing from this story: How Walter Black's (Mel Gibson) family changed from what we presume were loving relationships to the horrible loveless people shown in the movie. If his wife and oldest son were always so hateful, it's no wonder he went crazy. The whole family is very sick; Walter is just the designated patient. What happened to bring things to the crisis point?But everything is this movie is so very trite and unreal that it probably isn't worth the time I'm wasting writing about it. Long before the movie was over, I found myself hating every character in it, except Gibson's. And the little kid, but that character is also very unreal; he should not have been so well adjusted, since the dysfunctionality he had to live with was not merely Walter's.Maybe the movie would have been a bit better if they had jettisoned the boring, stupid, and unnecessary subplot about the oldest son and the cheerleader. Both are so very trite, especially the cheerleader. The tortured soul that can only express herself through graffiti--puh-leeze. The DVD should come with a barf bag. Probably two.Gibson's performance is great and he plays the only sympathetic character in the movie--up until the end anyway, when the movie becomes rushed and silly, and the story suddenly takes him from being the surviving victim of a loveless family into self-mutilation.There is so much wrong with this movie that I wouldn't even recommend seeing it solely for Gibson's performance, fine as that was.",1,HATED it.,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,1941,"['may', 'need', 'beaver', 'puppet', 'find', 'proper', 'words', 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'hatred', 'movie', 'inspired', 'hated', 'everyone', 'everything', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'even', 'hated', 'continuity', 'person', 'making', 'huge', 'error.In', 'making', 'feature', 'disc', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'talks', 'wit', 'humor', 'several', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'iota', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'worst', 'error', 'movie', 'crucial', 'piece', 'information', 'missing', 'story', 'How', 'Walter', 'Black', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'family', 'changed', 'what', 'presume', 'were', 'loving', 'relationships', 'horrible', 'loveless', 'people', 'shown', 'movie', 'wife', 'oldest', 'son', 'were', 'always', 'so', 'hateful', 'wonder', 'went', 'crazy', 'whole', 'family', 'very', 'sick', 'Walter', 'just', 'designated', 'patient', 'What', 'happened', 'bring', 'things', 'crisis', 'point', 'everything', 'movie', 'so', 'very', 'trite', 'unreal', 'probably', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', ""'m"", 'wasting', 'writing', 'Long', 'movie', 'was', 'found', 'hating', 'character', 'Gibson', 'little', 'kid', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'unreal', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'well', 'adjusted', 'dysfunctionality', 'had', 'live', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'had', 'jettisoned', 'boring', 'stupid', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'oldest', 'son', 'cheerleader', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'trite', 'especially', 'cheerleader', 'tortured', 'soul', 'can', 'only', 'express', 'graffiti', 'puh-leeze', 'DVD', 'should', 'come', 'barf', 'bag', 'Probably', 'two.Gibson', 'performance', 'great', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'movie', 'up', 'end', 'anyway', 'when', 'movie', 'rushed', 'silly', 'story', 'suddenly', 'being', 'surviving', 'victim', 'loveless', 'family', 'self-mutilation.There', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'solely', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'fine', 'was']",N/A

Swanson,"[1, 2]","4.5 starsJodie Foster is a beautiful soul and Mel Gibson is her hand-puppet in this gorgeous and touching film that will make any feeling person laugh and cry. If you've ever had a family member or close friend who truly suffered from deep depression, or if you've been there yourself, you know how brutal it can be. Foster and Gibson clearly do, and most especially screenwriter Kyle Killen, who produced a true work of art in The Beaver.His script, Foster's feel, and Gibson's complete immersement into his role and puppet gave me a cinematic experience of unexpected depth and power. There are moments here that just touched me to the core. From moment one, there's that rare and wonderful feeling of being in a real world, not a fake Hollywood film, yet there's also a lightness and wry sense of humor that this subject needs so much. Movies about depression aren't usually much fun, but The Beaver delivers both real humor and oddly powerful pathos, and when it was over I really felt like I'd been through something. That's good art.All the performances are very good to great, and you can tell everybody knew they were making a unique and special film. It just kind of sneaks up on you, scene by scene, and before you know it you're feeling way more than you expected. I'd hate to use spoilers so I'll just say that some very unexpected things happen that are emotionally wrenching and so weird that they just seem true to life.Gibson is brilliant in a role that could easily be ridiculous. To bring the sadness and odd sense of fun the script calls for was no mean feat, and you can imagine many actors in this role but very few doing a better job. The man has matured in every way and that's clear to see on the screen. Same with Foster, who one day will get credit for a career full of intelligent and loving choices.It's the love that makes The Beaver work as well as it does, and I urge anybody who knows what depression can do to a family to watch this, preferably alone at night so you can really let it all sink in.A very rare and unique film.

1440797,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0053XZ8O2,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 5]","I followed this film before its theatrical release.  I read of Foster's struggle to retain backing for the project after Mel Gibson's casting, breaking his essential Hollywood blacklisting because of his inappropriate comments to a police officer while under the influence.  Gibson didn't work for almost five years.  However, Foster was firm with her casting, reportedly went a more indy route to secure financing, and fought for her choice of actor.  After the film was made, communications with Gibson's girlfriend became public, generating more bad publicity for the actor which delayed the release of the film.  The film premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival.  The film was not given wide release, but went the art-house circuit after disappointing early box-office.  Made for $21 million, the box office revenues were under a million.  It was both Gibson's and Foster's poorest box office showing.That said, I LIKED the film!  It is a strange movie.  As Foster comments in the DVD extras, there is a balance between humor and family drama.  The dark subject matter of depression is nevertheless one with which many families have had to battle; so I hope ""The Beaver"" finds its audience.  We never really get a sense of what triggers Walter Black's depression, other than the family genetic history that similar things happened with his father and grandfather.  As Walter Black, Mel Gibson's face is weathered and worn, laden with the cares of depression.  He fills each moment of screen time with clear, often unexpected choices.American audiences seem to do well with superheroes, raunchy comedies and horror movies.  When dealing with real family situations that get complex, audiences can have trouble knowing how to react.  This film does have humor, such as Walter's attempted suicide that had me laughing as he marched to the hotel balcony.  It also has the very serious issues that Jody Foster's Meredith Black reflects extremely well, loving her husband very much, but also having to make decisions that protect her children.  But the box office returns do not mean that this isn't a good film.  I think it is.Other cast performances are also amazing.  Anton Yelchin from ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" ""Star Trek"" and currently in theatres with ""Fright Night"" is riveting.  He shows the teenage rebelliousness, self-centeredness, balanced with a tremendous decency with his mother and brother and kids at school.  Jennifer Lawrence whose Oscar-nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone"" broke her career wide open does a superb job as high school valedictorian Norah, whose family was also affected by a suicide.  The young son Henry played by Riley Thomas Stewart is so sweet, you just want to give the boy a hug.  Cherry Jones, who has won a Tony on Broadway for ""The Heiress"" and is considered a consummate theatrical actress, does a great job as the vice president of Walter's toy company.""The Beaver"" requires focus and concentration from its audience.

Very well directed by Foster, directing a film like this is like dancing: if you doubt what you're doing for a second, you'll look like a fool in short order. But Foster keeps the pedal to the metal the whole way. Great closing shot too.The only slight weakness to the film is Jennifer Lawrence's performance.

1440800,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0053XZ8O2,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","When I first heard that Mel Gibson was going to star in a movie where he played a man who talked through a hand puppet of a beaver I thought good for him, another comedy under his belt. It wasn't until I watched the film that I found the movie was only comedic in moments but was actually a deep drama focusing on one man's method of dealing with depression, something I think more and more people are experiencing these days. And I also thought it was much better than I had anticipated.In THE BEAVER, Gibson stars as Walter Black, the owner of a toy company handed down to him by his father. Walter is in the midst of a deep depression that nothing seems to cure. Therapy, fads, pills, nothing works. His youngest son Henry (Riley Stewart) doesn't see most of the problems, his teen son Porter (Anton Yelchin) is in that teen phase where he hates his father and dreads becoming like him (to the point he puts post it notes on the ceiling of his room of things his dad does so he won't do them) and his wife Meredith (Jodi Foster who also directed) is so frustrated that she kicks him out.With nowhere to go, Walter ditches part of what he's taken with him and while looking in the dumpster finds a hand puppet of a beaver. For some odd reason, he takes it with him and checks into a hotel. At his lowest point, Walter then attempts suicide by hanging himself from a shower curtain rod which fails miserably. Dragging the rod by his necktie, he then stands on the ledge of his room and tries to jump, falling backward onto the balcony. And then the beaver starts talking to him.Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a puppet that's alive and talks. Walter's lips move and the words come from his mouth, but to him it IS the beaver speaking to him. And the beaver tells him he is here to fix his life.The next thing you know Walter is in the garage working on a project with his youngest son and passing along a note to his wife telling her that this is a new therapy suggested by his last therapist. He does the same at work and while it seems strange to see his lips moving but getting the impression it's the beaver talking, everyone adjust. His life gets better.Things at the toy factory go great and he launches a new toy line based on...the beaver. Things at home get better too as he works his way back into his family's good graces. With the exception of Porter who has his own issues to deal with. These include writing fake assignments for fellow students and being hired by the school's prettiest girl to write the valedictorian speech for her. The two try to open up to one another tentatively but still the both have something to hide.And that's the thing about this movie. It's not about a man with a talking beaver puppet on his hand. It's about people and the problems they have in real life and how they deal with them. Some might use a puppet while others hide in a shell and bang their head into a wall and yet some hold secrets and feelings deep inside with a fear of sharing them with anyone. All of these emotions come into play in this story. And the solutions that each character finds to their problems vary from violence to hear rendering.Foster has done a great job of assembling a cast that seems fit for their roles. She does great as a woman concerned for her husband but trying to do the right thing for her family as well. Yelchin is great as a troubled teen searching for himself and fearful of becoming the one thing he witnesses as being worse off than he is. And Gibson turns in a dynamic performance as a man trapped inside of a deep pain that he can not share with anyone, that offers no release and that could end up killing him.THE BEAVER is a film that will not be nominated for any awards (though Gibson's performance should be) and didn't last long at the box office. And that's sad since the topic of depression and dealing with it is one that needs discussed. One can only hope that this film which offers fear, depression, the feeling of hopelessness, redemption and love will find its audience on DVD.",4,TWISTED DEPRESSION,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4045,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'going', 'star', 'movie', 'where', 'played', 'man', 'who', 'talked', 'hand', 'puppet', 'beaver', 'thought', 'good', 'comedy', 'belt', 'was', ""n't"", 'watched', 'film', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'comedic', 'moments', 'was', 'actually', 'deep', 'drama', 'focusing', 'one', 'man', 'method', 'dealing', 'depression', 'something', 'think', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'experiencing', 'days', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'anticipated.In', 'THE', 'BEAVER', 'Gibson', 'Walter', 'Black', 'owner', 'toy', 'company', 'handed', 'down', 'father', 'Walter', 'midst', 'deep', 'depression', 'nothing', 'cure', 'Therapy', 'fads', 'pills', 'nothing', 'works', 'youngest', 'son', 'Henry', 'Riley', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'problems', 'teen', 'son', 'Porter', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'teen', 'phase', 'where', 'father', 'becoming', 'point', 'post', 'ceiling', 'room', 'things', 'dad', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'wife', 'Meredith', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'so', 'frustrated', 'out.With', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Walter', 'part', 'what', 'taken', 'looking', 'dumpster', 'hand', 'puppet', 'beaver', 'odd', 'reason', 'checks', 'hotel', 'lowest', 'point', 'Walter', 'then', 'suicide', 'hanging', 'shower', 'curtain', 'rod', 'miserably', 'Dragging', 'rod', 'necktie', 'then', 'ledge', 'room', 'tries', 'jump', 'falling', 'backward', 'balcony', 'then', 'beaver', 'talking', 'him.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'puppet', 'alive', 'talks', 'Walter', 'lips', 'move', 'words', 'come', 'mouth', 'beaver', 'speaking', 'beaver', 'here', 'fix', 'life.The', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Walter', 'garage', 'working', 'project', 'youngest', 'son', 'passing', 'note', 'wife', 'telling', 'new', 'therapy', 'suggested', 'last', 'therapist', 'same', 'work', 'strange', 'see', 'lips', 'moving', 'getting', 'impression', 'beaver', 'talking', 'everyone', 'adjust', 'life', 'better.Things', 'toy', 'factory', 'go', 'great', 'new', 'toy', 'line', 'based', 'beaver', 'Things', 'home', 'get', 'better', 'too', 'way', 'back', 'family', 'good', 'graces', 'exception', 'Porter', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'deal', 'include', 'writing', 'fake', 'assignments', 'fellow', 'students', 'being', 'hired', 'school', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'write', 'valedictorian', 'speech', 'two', 'try', 'open', 'up', 'one', 'tentatively', 'still', 'have', 'something', 'hide.And', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'man', 'talking', 'beaver', 'puppet', 'hand', 'people', 'problems', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'deal', 'might', 'use', 'puppet', 'others', 'hide', 'shell', 'bang', 'head', 'wall', 'yet', 'hold', 'secrets', 'feelings', 'deep', 'fear', 'sharing', 'anyone', 'emotions', 'come', 'play', 'story', 'solutions', 'character', 'problems', 'vary', 'violence', 'hear', 'rendering.Foster', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'assembling', 'cast', 'fit', 'roles', 'great', 'woman', 'concerned', 'husband', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Yelchin', 'great', 'troubled', 'teen', 'searching', 'fearful', 'becoming', 'one', 'thing', 'being', 'worse', 'off', 'Gibson', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'man', 'trapped', 'deep', 'pain', 'can', 'not', 'share', 'anyone', 'release', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'him.THE', 'BEAVER', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'nominated', 'awards', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'box', 'office', 'sad', 'topic', 'depression', 'dealing', 'one', 'discussed', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'film', 'fear', 'depression', 'feeling', 'hopelessness', 'redemption', 'love', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'DVD']",N/A

He works out a ""solution"" to get back to a ""normal"" life by creating a more confident version of himself in the form of a ""talking"" beaver puppet.Sounds pretty silly, doesn't it? Well, most of the other people around him think the same thing but you know what? It works. He returns to his life as the CEO of a toy company and he begins to repair things with his wife (who moved out a long time ago) and his children (who are living with the mother).Jodi Foster, who also directed, plays the wife of the main character, Walter, who is played by Mel Gibson. Gibson, by the way, demonstrates why an ""older"" Hollywood actor like himself is still in demand. He can deliver the goods. Also starring Jennifer Lawrence who is dealing with the loss of her brother to suicide and serves as a romantic interest to Porter, the son of Walter in this picture.On a deeper level this picture deals with depression and how medicine cannot always deal with it and the fact that some depressed people are going to turn to unorthodox means to cure themselves. It also deals with suicide and the pain the living loved ones go through when something like that happens. How do you deal with grief? How do you channel your rage in a polite society?And, on a philosophical level it deals with what is happiness and what is normal? The society pretty much determines that factor and this movie suggests society is sometimes wrong.Thought provoking and probably too deep for the typicaly popcorn eating audiences who don't want anything too serious. Then again, I think the movie people suspected this and thus use the amusing and sometimes humorous beaver to deliver salient points here and there in the film.The budget for this picture was $21M but it struck out at the Box Office with just a bit over $6M.

Pretty much the whole world is now down on Gibson, even to the point of not wanting to ever watch his movies again.  Throw in a really stupid title certain to draw chuckles for its unintended double meaning.  Then we have a puppet.  Yes it's a beaver puppet, but still.  Then leave it up to the distributor to pitch the film as a comedy.  This is no comedy and if you can get past the idea of a rodent puppet always attached to the hand of Walter who is in deep depression, it actually is a very good movie.Walter (Gibson) is the head of a previously successful small toy company that is quickly heading toward bankruptcy.  We don't really know what the cause of Walter's depression is but we can assume the company's downfall is at least partially to blame.  After a failed suicide attempt Walter finds the discarded hand puppet which begins to talk to him.  Actually, it's Walter talking back to himself with the puppet as his alter ego.  Yes, this sounds crazy and frankly it is.  Still, Gibson pulls it off, switching back and forth from an American accent (Walter) to a spot-on version of Michael Caine (The Beaver).  He ranges from normal to manic and suicidal.  He's very good!Walter becomes dependent on The Beaver, but can otherwise act rationally.  His wife (Foster) puts up with this for a while because she believes it is changing her husband for the better and that this is a short term therapy suggested by a doctor.  There is a subplot involving Walter's teenage son played by Anton Yelchin and a beautiful fellow student played by Jennifer Lawrence.  Each has their own set of issues.  This acting couple team up again this year in ""Like Crazy.""  I didn't find much amusing in this well made film.  It's too bad it has been mostly overlooked.The Blu ray version has an excellent picture surprisingly full of color.  The sound via DTS-HD is solid but mostly upfront.

Gibson is excellent in this movie playing a mentally ill man.  As his life and family crumble under his depression, Walter Black (Gibson) finds a beaver puppet which he uses to try to get back to real life and his family.  The puppet ""speaks"" (in a Cockney accent) for him and is always with him.  This constant companionship is sometimes eerie, sometimes effective as therapy especially with his younger child, and is sometimes quite funny.  Black showers and makes love to his wife (Jodie Foster) with the beaver on his hand at all times, the absurdity of the situations playing off well against the shadow of his disease.  This is a dark movie with a serious theme, but there is unexpected humor in it, sometimes at the same moment as a bit of that darkness.The beaver puppet, which has unsettlingly penetrating eyes, helps Black back into his job and family life to some extent.  The movie way overplays the job part, though.  That he could make that kind of comeback with such a ridiculous product and be the apple of the media's eye was a stretch.  But the movie realistically goes on to show that the old illness is still there in Walter Black, as the beaver seems to take on a life of its own.  The ending?  A little hard to believe.  And yet in its own way the beaver is used by Black to make a last stand against his insanity.This is a movie with a well-written script, quite good acting (particularly Gibson's), and an absorbing mix of tragedy, struggle, and humor.

A failed suicide attempt leads him to his last chance at recovery, a puppet called The Beaver.  Disclamier #1 I will do my best to keep this review short enough to take up the whole page here.  Since the 1st of the year I have reviewed over 200 movies.  This is one of, if not the best movie of the year.  Disclaimer #2...the extent of my personal knowledge of the real actors are what I read and I do not know them personally.  Every interview I see when actors talk about the characters they play they are always in the 3rd person, trying to distance themselves as not to bring thier personal lives in to the part.  This is the extremely rare movie that the baggage an actor brings with him actually helps the movie.  The first line on the back of the case says ""Walter, once a successful and happy family man, has hit rock bottom.""  You could insert the name Mel and it would make even more sense.  The first movie he has made since his ""Meltdown"" and there is no better way to return then this one.  This is the greatest job of casting in a movie since Samuel L. Jackson played ""Shaft"".  For those that love Gibson, you will absolutly love this movie.  For those that don't, I would still ask you to give this a chance.  Going in knowing what he as done recently only helps give the character the dimension that it needs.  His acting in this is far and away the best of his career and possibly of the year.  The big problem is that because of what he has done recently this movie as a stigma put on it so don't expect any award show wins.  The irony is that it is because of who he is that makes the movie great.  Overall, an absolute must see.  Mel Gibson is amazing in this movie, and it may make you think different of him. I easily give it an A+ (higher if I could)...A++..there!Would I watch again? - I will buy this and show it to as many people as I can.*Also try - Barney's Version & A Beautiful Mind",5,Possibly the best movie of the year.

1440826,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0053XZ8O2,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","A depressed CEO of a toy company accidentally finds a way to communicate with others through a hand puppet he found in a dumpster. While his younger son and estranged wife, as well as his company's employees, welcome his change, his older son, afraid of becoming like his father, just doesn't like it.Mel Gibson plays the depressed CEO Walter Black. Jodie Foster is his alienated wife Meredith. Anton Yelchin is Walter's elder son Porter, who writes term papers for other students for money; Jennifer Lawrence is Norah, the valedictorian who asks Porter to write a speech for her. Their budding romance is just a subplot, but seems more believable than the main story.The film's premise about the troubled man with a hand puppet is already something hardly credible, especially when Mel Gibson's character goes through the change so quickly. When the beaver hand puppet started 'speaking' in a Cockney accent, I stopped caring. Is it an allegory or something? Is there any subtexts underlying the apparently incredible storyline? I know the hand puppet idea does not have to be psychologically valid. In ""The Beaver"" it serves as a plot device - a device of which potential is never explored.""The Beaver"" is a drama, not a comedy. If it is a comedy, it is a dark one. We know Jodie Foster (who also directs) is not known for comedic roles. But as a drama, like in her works as director (""Little Man Tate"" and ""Home for the Holidays""), something is not quite right with the film, of which characters (including the ""Beaver""), well-acted as they are, feel very distant. Despite the drastic thing that happens in the latter half of the story, we feels emotionally detached. Is that really necessary?The film's uneven script does not allow us to get to know the characters. We see Mel Gibson turning in compelling performances, but we do not meet the person Walter Black. We are fascinated by his acting, not by the character's spiritual journey. The film is sincere and intelligent, and has a unique concept, but that alone is not enough to draw us into the story it tells.",2,Unbelievable Premise And That's Not the Only Problem,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,2070,"['depressed', 'CEO', 'toy', 'company', 'accidentally', 'way', 'communicate', 'others', 'hand', 'puppet', 'found', 'dumpster', 'younger', 'son', 'estranged', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'company', 'employees', 'welcome', 'change', 'older', 'son', 'afraid', 'becoming', 'father', 'just', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.Mel', 'Gibson', 'depressed', 'CEO', 'Walter', 'Black', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'alienated', 'wife', 'Meredith', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Walter', 'elder', 'son', 'Porter', 'who', 'term', 'papers', 'other', 'students', 'money', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Norah', 'valedictorian', 'who', 'Porter', 'write', 'speech', 'budding', 'romance', 'just', 'subplot', 'more', 'believable', 'main', 'story.The', 'film', 'premise', 'troubled', 'man', 'hand', 'puppet', 'already', 'something', 'hardly', 'credible', 'especially', 'when', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'change', 'so', 'quickly', 'When', 'beaver', 'hand', 'puppet', 'started', ""'speaking"", 'Cockney', 'accent', 'stopped', 'caring', 'allegory', 'something', 'there', 'subtexts', 'underlying', 'apparently', 'incredible', 'storyline', 'know', 'hand', 'puppet', 'idea', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'psychologically', 'valid', 'Beaver', 'plot', 'device', 'device', 'potential', 'never', 'explored', 'Beaver', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'dark', 'one', 'know', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'also', 'not', 'known', 'comedic', 'roles', 'drama', 'works', 'director', 'Little', 'Man', 'Tate', 'Home', 'Holidays', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'film', 'characters', 'including', 'Beaver', 'well-acted', 'are', 'feel', 'very', 'distant', 'drastic', 'thing', 'latter', 'half', 'story', 'feels', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'really', 'necessary', 'film', 'uneven', 'script', 'not', 'allow', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'turning', 'compelling', 'performances', 'do', 'not', 'meet', 'person', 'Walter', 'Black', 'are', 'fascinated', 'acting', 'not', 'character', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'film', 'sincere', 'intelligent', 'unique', 'concept', 'alone', 'not', 'enough', 'draw', 'story']",N/A
