1691878,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,B00HRYH67M,A. Pierre,"[3, 7]","After WWE disgraced Warrior on a previous dvd, Warrior returns but not to talk about that dvd. At the start of the dvd he seems like a good guy & well spoken. However, I disagree with him when he said that he has tons of great matches in the vault. This set is everything you want of the Warrior-his best known matches, jobber matches, but too many repeat opponents. I would have prefered seeing him wrestle the bigger guys at the time like Haku, Earthquake, or Papa Shango. Hell his feud with Shango isnt even metioned & most of his return in 92 is ignored expect his run with Macho Man as the Ultimate Maniacs. In the end he says there could be another dvd release but I highly doubt it even though this dvd will sell well.Overall, a exhausting dvd over the Warrior with his insight in between matches, the promos leading to matches, & the matches itself. The only real draw back to the set is the same opponent are constantly repeated & no matches from his comeback in 92 like Shango. If you're a Warrior fan, you'll love it. If not & love old school WWE, then you'll love it. If you're just curious to learn more about him, then you'll love it. I enjoyed the set but don't expect too many quality matches.",4,Ultimate Warrior,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1209,"['WWE', 'disgraced', 'Warrior', 'previous', 'dvd', 'Warrior', 'returns', 'not', 'talk', 'dvd', 'start', 'dvd', 'good', 'guy', 'well', 'spoken', 'However', 'disagree', 'when', 'said', 'tons', 'great', 'matches', 'vault', 'set', 'everything', 'want', 'Warrior-his', 'best', 'known', 'matches', 'jobber', 'matches', 'too', 'many', 'repeat', 'opponents', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'seeing', 'wrestle', 'bigger', 'guys', 'time', 'Haku', 'Earthquake', 'Papa', 'Shango', 'Hell', 'feud', 'Shango', 'isnt', 'even', 'metioned', 'most', 'return', '92', 'ignored', 'expect', 'run', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Ultimate', 'Maniacs', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'dvd', 'release', 'highly', 'doubt', 'even', 'dvd', 'will', 'sell', 'well.Overall', 'exhausting', 'dvd', 'Warrior', 'insight', 'matches', 'promos', 'leading', 'matches', 'matches', 'only', 'real', 'draw', 'back', 'set', 'same', 'opponent', 'are', 'constantly', 'repeated', 'matches', 'comeback', '92', 'Shango', ""'re"", 'Warrior', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'not', 'love', 'old', 'school', 'WWE', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'re"", 'just', 'curious', 'learn', 'more', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'enjoyed', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'quality', 'matches']",Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection

1691883,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B00HRYH67M,D.P.,"[5, 5]","He's one of the most controversial wrestlers in the history for his actions in & outside of the wrestling ring to the point where WWE released a DVD set close to a decade ago telling THEIR side of the story while attempting to embarrass & bury him as a person & his wrestling career but ""time heals all wounds"" with this man finally being able to tell his own story while providing various matches of his career ranging from his most famous matches to rare encounters along with often forgotten about moments in the career of the Ultimate Warrior.  Warrior himself providing comments in between each match on various subjects & career points throughout his career including starting out, working in World Class, his championship runs, elements of his character, various opponents, his famous entrance, importance of ""jobbers"" to his career, his returns to WWE, and WCW while also seeing moments such as confronting Andre on The Brother Love Show, three promos including his infamous ""crash the plane"" promo for his WrestleMania VI match, the end of The Brother Love Show, appearance on The Funeral Parlor, face to face interviews with Randy Savage, confrontation with Goldust, receiving a gift from Jerry Lawler, and two of his promos from WCW including the debut coming face to face with Hollywood Hogan.Matches Include:Blade Runners vs. Perry Jackson & Shawn O'Reilly - This was pretty much just a dominate power showcase of the future Ultimate Warrior & Sting at the start of their careers but more significant based off how these men started their careers together & paralleled each other in different companies all the way to both men being the World Champion at the same time only four years later.""Universal Wrestling Federation' Apr. '86vs. Chris Adams - Percy Pringle III caused a distraction in the beginning allowing Warrior to work over the throat area using the ring ropes various times & showcasing his power catching Adams in mid-air while Adams was able to recover using a superkick on more than one occasion along with a piledriver.  This match was pretty short & sweet with the only thing really noteworthy was the controversial finish.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '86vs. Barry Horowitz - Warrior showcased his superior power advantage with when either delivering or receiving offense only to have Barry keep bouncing off him to the point where Barry was able to get an advantage taking advantage of Warrior's own mistiming.  This was pretty much a dominate enhancement match.""Wrestling Challenge"" Nov. '87vs. Steve Lombardi - This was a match where Warrior not only showcased his dominance through his power offense such as a shoulderblock & clotheslines & a bearhug but also his ability to keep using his opponents momentum against him multiple times as well.""Superstars"" Nov. '87vs. Harley Race - Warrior started out very dominate with Race's offense having no effect & kept being knocked to the outside to the point where he ended up sprawled out all over the ringside steps after being thrown so hard into the corner before Race was able to use Warrior's momentum against him while delivering some hard hitting moves such as a piledriver & headbutts as Race was able to get more offense in on Warrior than anyone had previously had up to this point.Mar. '88Weasel Suit Match vs. Bobby Heenan - Heenan kept trying to run away & avoid Warrior before eventually getting caught before using tactics that did show it's effects on Warrior in a match that was pretty short & served it's purpose.July '88vs. Intercontinental Champion Honky Tonk Man - All I can say on this one is don't blink because you'll miss the longest Intercontinental Title reign end in seconds.SummerSlam '88[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Honky Tonk Man - Warrior took the attack to Honky right away & even took care of Jimmy Hart at ringside before a mistiming allowed Honky to take advantage with both him & Hart using whatever they could get their hands on to work over Warrior weather is was weapons at ringside or the ring ropes to choke him down causing Warrior to use their own tactics against them.Dec. '88Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - A year before ""The Ultimate Challenge"" with Hulk Hogan, Warrior met Savage under the same conditions where both championships were on the line in the same match.  Warrior showed he had the power advantage so Savage outsmarted Warrior to take advantage working over Warrior in & outside of the ring working over the throat area while executing both a grounded & aerial assault as both men continued to trade momentum throughout the contest with another important figure looking on at ringside.  This comes off now as a teaser or preview of their series of matches they would have two years later but it was still a good quality match as many have said that Savage was Warrior's greatest opponent & that can't be denied as Savage gave us a better match with Warrior than anyone else did up to this point in time.Feb. '89vs. Intercontinental Champion Rick Rude - The rematch months after their controversial WrestleMania encounter with Warrior dominating with his power offense such as pressing Rude over top rope onto the floor & just dropping Rude onto his butt on the mat while giving Rude a taste of his own medicine as far his taunts before Rude attempted to take away the power by heavily working over his back as both men traded momentum with both men trying to one up the other at times including executing different styles of piledrivers against each other. Rude was one of the men who was able to work with & get the best out of Warrior's one dimensional power style giving Warrior one of the best in-ring quality matches here.SummerSlam '89[History Of Intercontinental Championship]vs. Bob Bradley - You typical Ultimate Warrior squash match that had some comedic moments at the start & after the match.""Prime Time Wrestling"" Sept. '89vs. Brian Costello - Another Warrior squash match that would probably be more memorable for what he did to him after than during the match.""Prime Time Wrestling"" Dec. '89Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - This was short (and I'm putting that lightly) as Andre decided to mock Warrior & payed for it.""Madison Square Garden"" Oct. '89Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - Andre came after Warrior right away attempting to take the breathe away by either choke him out in various ways or stretching him using anything to his advantage while Warrior continued to use his power to attempt to knock Andre down & beat Andre at his own game using some of his own offense against him while taking advantage of any situation to work his favor.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '89Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Mr. Perfect - Warrior showcased his superior strength advantage right from the start powering Perfect outside of the ring on various ways whenever he wasn't dragging him around in the ring before a miscalculation on Warrior's part allowed Perfect to work over the midsection with various strikes & dropping his weight on it while also attempting to keep him grounded.""Madison Square Garden"" Mar. '90Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.Wrestlemania VI[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of The WWE Championship]WWE Championship Match vs. Ted DiBiase - This was a rare title defense in that it happened during WWE's tour of Japan & Dibiase didn't have Virgil in his corner with Dibiase bringing the attack to Warrior first only for Warrior to counter back shoving off Dibiase's offense & using his power advantage only for Dibiase to use Warrior's momentum against him to regain the advantage using some impactful offense of his own.""Wrestling Summit"" Apr. '90WWE Championship Match vs. Rick Rude - Warrior came out very aggressive in the beginning attacking Rude from all over in & outside of the ring along with getting his hands on Bobby Heenan as well before one mistake allowed Rude to gain control over Warrior using various strategies from boxing him down to wearing him down with moves like a sleeper to big impactful moves while also resorting to using cheating tactics weather it was an object or Heenan at ringside.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" July '90WWE Championship Match vs. Ted DiBiase - Warrior came into this match very intense as usual working over Dibiase with his power resulting in Dibiase attempting to take Warrior down & keep him grounded weather it was a headlock takedown or suplex with Virgil on the outside to assist if possible but the biggest story here was about who else decided to make it known that he was challenging the WWE Championship as well.""The Main Event"" Nov. '90WWE Championship Match vs. Sgt. Slaughter - Slaughter made it clear how he was going to wrestle this match by starting the match raking the eyes right away & constantly working over Warrior with brawling in the corner or taking advantage of the ringside environment on the outside using what he could to attack Warrior while Warrior relied on his power such as a hard whip in the corner with such force that it sent Slaughter over the top to the floor while also making sure he did what he could to prevent Gen. Adnan from making his physical presence in the match as well.Jan. '91Steel Cage Match vs. Randy Savage - This was shortly after the Royal Rumble when Savage cost Warrior the WWE Championship & started as a fight on the floor before moving inside the cage as both men went back & forth against each other. Sherri was at ringside & played a factor multiple times by reaching through the cage & eventually getting in the cage herself before getting the clothes beat her off her...literally. This was a very entertaining match with an aftermath that was just as out of control as the match itself.""Madison Square Garden"" Jan. '91[Greatest Steel Cage Matches Of All Time]Career Ending Match vs. Randy Savage - The loser of this match would be forced to retire from active competition while it was noted before the match that Elizabeth was spotted in the audience which was the first time she's been seen since the previous WrestleMania while it was also acknowledged just by his body language alone how important this match was to Warrior as this was the first time he didn't run to the ring but walked as Warrior started out in control only for Savage to quickly gain it back with Sherri getting her shots in whenever possible as both men traded momentum with the action getting more & more intense as time went on with Savage at one point executing more top rope elbow drops than he ever has before while still kicking out of everything Warrior was throwing at him to the point where even Warrior started to question what his destiny truly was. Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as they gave one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in both men's careers as everyone was on the edge of their seats for over 20 mins.WrestleMania VII[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection; True Story Of WrestleMania]vs. Undertaker - Warrior came after Taker right away with hard clotheslines in the corner & over the top rope only for Taker to land on his feet with Taker taking control with a death grip around Warrior's jaw & trust in the throat dominating him at his own slow methodical pace resulting in a different type of encounter than we've previously seen from Warrior as he was heavily on the defense throughout a majority of the bout.June '91Ultimate Maniacs vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Money Inc. - This started off as a brawl between all four men with Money Inc. coming out on the losing end on more than one occasion as Savage & Warrior dominated until one mistake allowed Money Inc. to single out & heavily work over one man isolating him from his partner throughout most of the match before the action somehow got out of control again that more people with an issue with one of the teams involved decided to appear as well.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '92vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was the WrestleMania debut of the future Triple H but reality is that he was only a body for Warrior to make a quick & dominate in his return to WWE after over 3 years.WrestleMania XIIvs. Jerry Lawler - This was pretty short & sweet as Jerry Lawler attempted to take the fight to Warrior using whatever he could to take the breath away from Warrior only for Warrior to make his comeback.King Of The Ring '96(Blu-Ray) w/British Bulldogs vs. Demolition & Mr. Fuji - Warrior & Bulldogs showed that they had the superior power advantage early using it to their advantage along with the Bulldogs showcasing their athletic diversity such as Davey executing a head scissors takeover before Demolition & Fuji resorted to classic tag team tactics isolating one man from his partner in their half of the ring double & triple teaming along with Fuji taking some high risk of his own.""Maple Leaf Gardens"" July '88(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Dino Bravo - Warrior came out using his power only for Bravo to keep relying on his ""insurance policy"" & taking advantage of the referee to keep regaining the advantage working over Warrior's back with strikes & stretches while Warrior was able to take care of one of his outside distractions in a comedic way & concentrate on Bravo still using his power but the bigger story here was the aftermath when Warrior got some unexpected help that he apparently didn't want.""The Main Event"" Feb. '90(Blu-Ray) vs. Intercontinental Champion Goldust - This was nothing more than a segment where Ultimate Warrior played mind games with Goldust by playing with his wig & robe, Marlena's cigar & director's chair, and even beating up his bodyguard before Goldust ran away to get counted out.  Jerry Lawler's comment at the end summarized this entire segment, ""Was that a bout?""""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96Other Blu-Ray matches include matches against Matt Bourne from World Class Championship Wrestling & Sgt. Slaughter from ""WrestleFest"" in Mar. '91.  This big positive here is that was definitely a more credible presentation than the previously released ""Self Destruction"" set but the other side of the coin is that with this being a match anthology really showcased him being a one dimensional power wrestler who would rarely go out of the wrestling style unless he had opponents like Hulk Hogan or Randy Savage who were able bring out more of him while he didn't really address many of the past behind the scenes issues addressed in the previous set.  I liked the match most of the match selection (minus ""matches"" like the one with Goldust) because Warrior wrestled in the period where there wasn't as much television/PPV exposure unlike today that we got matches that were rarely seen & forgotten about but I felt that his SummerSlam '92 match against Randy Savage should have been on here as it's a forgotten quality match that for some reason has only been released outside of the PPV anthology as a match on a rare bonus disc on Warrior's last DVD set which this set is suppose to replace.  In the end, if you were a big fan of WWE during the period of the late 80s-early 90s or just a fan of Warrior period then it's a no brainer to get this set.",4,"Ultimate Warrior...His Story, His

It is almost a Greek tragedy that Warrior would pass away just one week after this video was released, and also just hours after a remarkable appearance on Monday Night Raw.I am so glad this video was released and that Warrior provided insight. The matches speak for themselves. If you are a wrestling fan from late 80's-early 90's you know that Warrior was one of a kind. The video quality on this Blu-Ray is excellent and WWE has packed this set with many great Warrior matches and moments. Definitely check this out and pay tribute to a great personality and wrestler.

1691889,A3VVMIMMTYQV5F,B00HRYH67M,Johnny Saigon,"[21, 22]","Honor his memory, relive his moments with happiness. Thank you for all the happy memories. Rest In Peace, Ultimate Warrior.Growing up in my early teens, I couldn't find anything that I could relate with. I couldn't relate to any type of music - I didn't listen to the radio, and there wasn't much on TV at the time. Besides following basketball and Magic Johnson, I could not find anything in popular entertainment that would really struck a nerve. Growing up awkward, not a jock, not rich, not a brainiac(maybe a few of you can relate), there wasn't much that could bring out the inner me.Then one day on a Saturday night, while channel surfing, I perchance came upon a peculiar tune. A thunderous bass, some kickin' percussion, and a wicked guitar riff - What was this?? Then out of nowhere shot out a man - no, it was more than a man. It was a spirit, an energy, a force - it was THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR! I would never forget that moment which changed my life, which gave something that I could attach myself to and find meaning within these forces called ""growing up.""Here I was, a shy, taciturn, introverted boy. No way to express myself, no outlet to channel my thoughts, no medium to funnel my energy. Yet when I heard that music, and saw this embodiment of energy zipping through the crowd, jumping up the stairs, shaking the ropes, rumbling the ring, I finally found my meaning of existence, and that all is right with the world. Say what you will about the man - if he took steroids, if he was a jerk to the other wrestlers, if he was anarchistic to The Man(Vince McMahon & the WWF). When you're a kid, and you witnessed The Ultimate Warrior, you don't think of any of that, and it didn't matter. It didn't matter if we couldn't really understand his interviews and monologues. More than the man, The Ultimate Warrior was a symbol, he was a beacon for those of us who were awkward, who were confused, who were shunned, who were laughed upon, who were lost. He was that guiding light for our childhood, that no matter how bad our day was, our week, our family, our school, our personal life. For those 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, when you were in the world of the Warrior, you were realized, you were recognized, you were understood. More than a man, The Ultimate Warrior was the personification of our thoughts, the manifestation of our feelings. The Ultimate Warrior was the culmination of us - he was the ultimate culmination of my childhood, he was the culmination of me.So once again, thank you, Warrior. More than the matches, more than the show, like Guns N' Roses afterwards, like the song ""Eighteen"" by Alice Cooper, you allowed me to find my way, you allowed me to grow up, you allowed me to understand myself, you allowed me to be me. And I was all right after all.Your life has passed, but your energy remains in all of us who had the honor and the pleasure to witness your being. The Ultimate Warrior lives on in all of us.Thank you.",5,thank you,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,2958,"['Honor', 'memory', 'relive', 'moments', 'happiness', 'Thank', 'happy', 'memories', 'Rest', 'Peace', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior.Growing', 'up', 'early', 'teens', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'could', 'relate', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'type', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'radio', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'TV', 'time', 'following', 'basketball', 'Magic', 'Johnson', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'would', 'really', 'struck', 'nerve', 'Growing', 'up', 'awkward', 'not', 'jock', 'not', 'rich', 'not', 'brainiac', 'maybe', 'few', 'can', 'relate', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'could', 'bring', 'out', 'inner', 'me.Then', 'one', 'day', 'Saturday', 'night', 'channel', 'surfing', 'perchance', 'came', 'peculiar', 'tune', 'thunderous', 'bass', 'kickin', 'percussion', 'wicked', 'guitar', 'riff', 'What', 'was', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'shot', 'out', 'man', 'was', 'more', 'man', 'was', 'spirit', 'energy', 'force', 'was', 'THE', 'ULTIMATE', 'WARRIOR', 'would', 'never', 'forget', 'moment', 'changed', 'life', 'gave', 'something', 'could', 'attach', 'find', 'meaning', 'forces', 'called', 'growing', 'up', 'Here', 'was', 'shy', 'taciturn', 'introverted', 'boy', 'way', 'express', 'outlet', 'channel', 'thoughts', 'medium', 'funnel', 'energy', 'when', 'heard', 'music', 'saw', 'embodiment', 'energy', 'zipping', 'crowd', 'jumping', 'up', 'stairs', 'shaking', 'ropes', 'rumbling', 'ring', 'finally', 'found', 'meaning', 'existence', 'right', 'world', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'man', 'took', 'steroids', 'was', 'jerk', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'was', 'anarchistic', 'Man', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'WWF', 'When', ""'re"", 'kid', 'witnessed', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'interviews', 'monologues', 'More', 'man', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'was', 'symbol', 'was', 'beacon', 'who', 'were', 'awkward', 'who', 'were', 'confused', 'who', 'were', 'shunned', 'who', 'were', 'laughed', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'was', 'guiding', 'light', 'childhood', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'day', 'was', 'week', 'family', 'school', 'personal', 'life', '2', 'minutes', '5', 'minutes', '10', 'minutes', 'when', 'were', 'world', 'Warrior', 'were', 'realized', 'were', 'recognized', 'were', 'understood', 'More', 'man', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'was', 'personification', 'thoughts', 'manifestation', 'feelings', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'was', 'culmination', 'was', 'ultimate', 'culmination', 'childhood', 'was', 'culmination', 'me.So', 'once', 'again', 'thank', 'Warrior', 'More', 'matches', 'more', 'show', 'Guns', 'N', 'Roses', 'afterwards', 'song', 'Eighteen', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'allowed', 'find', 'way', 'allowed', 'grow', 'up', 'allowed', 'understand', 'allowed', 'be', 'was', 'right', 'all.Your', 'life', 'passed', 'energy', 'who', 'had', 'honor', 'pleasure', 'witness', 'being', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'us.Thank']",Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection
1691890,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00HRYH67M,Kane's Review,"[4, 4]","I never thought I'd see the day I would ever be doing a review on an Ultimate Warrior DVD. The reason being simply because I never cared for him. I tried to get into him but I never saw the spark and after hearing and reading about so many despicable things Warrior did behind the scenes during his 90s run in the WWF, it made me dislike him even more.Then on Wrestlemania 30 week, I saw the commercials for his DVD and saw that he was doing all the talking on this DVD. Somewhat interested in hearing what he had to say about his WWF tenure since his 1996 departure, I felt compelled to buy the DVD. After hearing his awe-inspiring Hall of Fame speech, I felt that with him burying the hatchet, I needed to give him a chance. So I brought his DVD and I was actually very impressed with it!This collection tells the story of Ultimate Warrior, told by Warrior himself! We start with opening words from Warrior before we load the spaceship with the rocket fuel and shoot off into parts unknown! From there on out in this 5+ hour DVD, the viewer is treated to Warrior's best matches and moments. From his early days as Blade Runner Rock to his ascension as the beloved Ultimate Warrior, Warrior tells the story in his own words and holds back on nothing, which should tell you how far he and McMahon have come and forgiven each other.This DVD offers up only the best Ultimate Warrior matches, including his SummerSlam match with Rick Rude, his notorious Wrestlemania 6 title unification match with Hulk Hogan. his retirement match with Randy Savage, his debut in WCW and more! One of my favorite Ultimate Warrior moments was when Jake Roberts put Warrior through a series of tests to prepare to meet The Undertaker on the dark side which included being locked in a casket, being buried, and walking through a room of snakes. Unfortunately those moments didn't make it on this set but can probably be found on Youtube.Overall, this is an astonishing DVD set that properly delves into the career of Ultimate Warrior. It also represents forgiveness. After Warrior left WWF in 1996 on a bad note and the release of the mockery Self-Destruction of Ultimate Warrior DVD, many thought we'd never see Ultimate Warrior or another Ultimate Warrior DVD in WWE again. But Warrior and McMahon managed to bury the hatchet and have this amazing set be released. After the shocking death of Warrior, this DVD now and forever serves as a tribute to one of the greatest to ever step inside of a WWF ring; the legend that is Ultimate Warrior!*RIP Ultimate Warrior*",5,Load The Spaceship With The Rocket Fuel And Ascend Into Parts Unknown!,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,2542,"['never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'day', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'doing', 'review', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'reason', 'being', 'simply', 'never', 'cared', 'tried', 'get', 'never', 'saw', 'spark', 'hearing', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'despicable', 'things', 'Warrior', 'did', 'scenes', '90s', 'run', 'WWF', 'made', 'even', 'more.Then', 'Wrestlemania', '30', 'week', 'saw', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'saw', 'was', 'doing', 'talking', 'DVD', 'Somewhat', 'interested', 'hearing', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'WWF', 'tenure', '1996', 'departure', 'felt', 'compelled', 'buy', 'DVD', 'hearing', 'awe-inspiring', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'speech', 'felt', 'burying', 'hatchet', 'needed', 'give', 'chance', 'brought', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'impressed', 'collection', 'story', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'told', 'Warrior', 'start', 'opening', 'words', 'Warrior', 'load', 'spaceship', 'rocket', 'fuel', 'shoot', 'off', 'parts', 'unknown', 'there', 'out', '5+', 'hour', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'treated', 'Warrior', 'best', 'matches', 'moments', 'early', 'days', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Rock', 'ascension', 'beloved', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'Warrior', 'story', 'own', 'words', 'back', 'nothing', 'should', 'tell', 'how', 'far', 'McMahon', 'have', 'come', 'forgiven', 'other.This', 'only', 'best', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'matches', 'including', 'SummerSlam', 'match', 'Rick', 'Rude', 'notorious', 'Wrestlemania', '6', 'title', 'unification', 'match', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'retirement', 'match', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'debut', 'WCW', 'more', 'One', 'favorite', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'Jake', 'Roberts', 'put', 'Warrior', 'series', 'tests', 'prepare', 'meet', 'Undertaker', 'dark', 'side', 'included', 'being', 'locked', 'casket', 'being', 'buried', 'walking', 'room', 'snakes', 'Unfortunately', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'set', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'found', 'Youtube.Overall', 'astonishing', 'DVD', 'set', 'properly', 'delves', 'career', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'also', 'forgiveness', 'Warrior', 'left', 'WWF', '1996', 'bad', 'note', 'release', 'mockery', 'Self-Destruction', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'many', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'WWE', 'again', 'Warrior', 'McMahon', 'managed', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'have', 'amazing', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'shocking', 'death', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'now', 'forever', 'serves', 'tribute', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'step', 'inside', 'WWF', 'ring', 'legend', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', '*RIP', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior*']",Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection

1691892,A1N8ST7FQO4S3K,B00HRYH67M,"Leif A. Ostgard ""ostgard""","[3, 5]","When I heard this was being released I was pumped, I mean like really pumped.  The Warrior was by far my favorite wrestler as a child.  He was insane.  So when it was related it would be released the next day I figured I'd find a Walmart and pick it up, well after searching high and low (everwhere I went was sold out) I found one B-Buy that had one last copy and bought it.  So much for Warrior not being over anymore.  When I watched it I noticed a few things, like other posted here the case has a type about Andre and Warrior at Summerslam '89 but that was just the case.  What became extremely obvious is that Warrior didn't seem to need to be making the DVD, he wasn't concerned about really much of anything and seemed to be the most light hearted happy guy you could ever put in front of the WWF/WWE camera's.  For all the crap other performers have laid on him he never once said anything bad about anyone, even the ones that swung for the fences on him during the Self Destruction DVD the WWE put out earlier.  I also own the Jake Roberts DVD and he looks horrible, seems miserable and delivers his memories to the viewer with so much gusto, its obvious he clings to it like a crutch as his only purpose for existance.  Warrior seemingly doesn't seem to live his life that way, and nor does he view his time in wrestling as something that defines him.  I highly recommend this DVD for the matches, you get matches I thought they wouldn't release but hoped they would such as the Rick Rude Saturday Nights Main Event match among others.  If you're looking for Warrior to use this opprotunity to avenge is name and bury guys that buried him you'll have to look elsewhere.  Also if your looking for details about circumstances you'll need to look elsewhere as well.  Initailly I was baffled by the lack of it but then I realized Warrior valued his character and legacy more than to tarnish it with rambles on people he didn't like or things that were not part of the performance.  So in turn you get the Warrior, his matches and what he thought of them,  All positive, no negatives.  For once a wrestler makes a DVD where he presents his work stand alone and not all the the smark dirt sheet stuff that takes away from it.  Here's the highlights....-Warrior was green and jacked with Sting when he started, though thinks Sting is a yes man he doesn't dislike him.-Warrior was poor and miserable, while working in Texas the name Dingo was created by a drunk guy about a dog.-Warrior got over and was eventually called by Vince.-Ultimate Warrior name not elaborated on.-Warrior speaks highly of Hercules, Race, Honky Tonk and even Heenan, calls them all nice people.-Warrior puts over jobbers, a first I have ever heard and reminds people that they made guys look great and got nothing in return.-Warrior thought Rude was awesome, loved working with him.-Warrior like Andre and thought he had a good attitude.-Warrior talks about WM6 like it was another match, like a lot Warrior doesn't drink his own koolaid about his history.-Warrior liked being champ but was OK they wanted it off him.-Warrior loved Savage, said he was a genius, laughs alot about his time with him.  Said he was the most respectful guy he knew.-Warrior doesn't talk about leaving, coming back, leaving again or much of anything.  He deos crap on HHH or WCW but said they didn't understand how to do much but spend Turners money, also he got paid a lot to just go under for Hogan.  Doesn't slam Vince, but puts over Linda. Generally the latter of his career he leaves much out, but clips are shown of his matches.  No Hogan WCW match...which is good because it was horirble.

1691893,A3DFJWEIUXT6RN,B00HRYH67M,Matt,"[3, 4]","The Ultimate Warrior holds a special place in my heart. I was four years old, sitting in front of the t.v. and flipping through the six channels we had. I stumbled across a man rippling with muscles, his face painted in a bright and color mask, running down to the ring and shaking the ropes with all his strength. Wham, bam and 5 minutes later, The Ultimate Warrior had destroyed some &#34;Ham and Egger&#34; (shout-out to Bobby Heenan) and had captivated my young mind. I never saw WWE on my television screen again until we got cable and Stone Cold Steve Austin made me a wrestling fan for life. However, I point to the moment of seeing Warrior blaze arcross the t.v. in 1991 planted the seeds for me to become the massive pro wrestling fan I am today.A decade ago, WWE released a dvd entitled &#34;The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior&#34;. The dvd, which I watched numerous times, painted Warrior as an egotistcal jerk that couldn't wrestle to save his life and whos promos were nonsensical garbage. To this day, that dvd is considered to be hack-job to Warrior's legacy and was a huge factor in Warrior repeatedly declining an invitation to join the WWE Hall of Fame (as he states in this dvd and in his HOF acceptance speech). Warrior may have been slightly off his rocker (look up his lectures and Youtube shoots if you don't believe me) he was a hugely popular superstar during WWE's first &#34;boom&#34; period and, at one point, rivaled Hulk Hogan as the most popular  superstar in the company.They say time heals all wounds and that appeared to be the case with Warrior and WWE mending the fences and releasing this dvd set to properly pay tribute to the man from Parts Unknown. Warrior sat down and recorded an interview specifically for this dvd set. There's typically an interview before each match/promo/segment, unless we get a bunch of similar matches lumped together (this happens twice on the dvd). Much to my surprise, Warrior was a very insightful and lucid speaker. He's much more composed and intelligent than his promos may lead you to believe! Throughout these interview segments, Warrior seems to hold nothing back and I believe is being 100% honest with his thoughts. You may learn things you didn't know about the man (he wrote down what he was going to say in his promos, I found that interesting) and you'll definitely be hooked on what Warrior has to say. It's a shame that there aren't MORE of these interview segments, but what is here is very informative and it's great to hear Warrior put his spin on the same topics WWE tried to bury in &#34;Self Destruction&#34;.As far as the matches go, there's a good mix between Warrior's best-known clashes and hidden gems. Some have complained about the the inclusion of so many &#34;squash&#34; matches. I personally feel those matches are needed to show how Warrior built himself up and established a connection with the fans. Those matches defintely aren't classics, but watching this dvd in the mindset of a 1980's WWE fan helps. Warrior will never be known as an amazining wrestler, but he was far better than he gets credit for, and his energy and intensity helped add layers to most Warrior matches. If you buy this set expecting to see numerous 4-5 * matches, you'll be disappointed. Warrior had exactly  four great matches, three of which are on this set (vs Rick Rude @ Summerslam, vs Hogan @ WM VI and vs Savage @ WM VII). Remember when I said &#34;hiddem gems&#34; though? This set has more than a few. Both the other matches with Randy Savage (especially the steel cage match) are great matches, as the WWE championship matches with Ted DiBiase and the match vs The Undertaker. There's also several memorable Warrior promos and segments, including a hysterical, at least by modern standards, moment where Taker locks him in a coffin and fills it with water.Sadly, this dvd collection will also serve as a memorial for The Ultimate Warrior, who passed away just a week after its release. It's fortunate then that Warrior and WWE were able to give us this dvd set before it was too late.

But that said,  Warrior himself as the set comes to an end says that this is only scratching the surface of the story..... and  I agree with the other reviewer that thought a few too many ""jobber"" matches were on this. I also wished as they did with the Macho Man set , they would have had a collection of his crazy promos but I'm being a bit picky.  I just kept thinking they passed up an opportunity to make it definitive and are sand bagging a wee bit. But  I never thought we'd see the day and certainly it is over due. I think Warrior may have been laying the groundwork for a book  to tell the full story and coming on the heels of this set and the Hall Of Fame, it would be crazy to miss that window.If you get the WWE's smear job DVD ""the self-destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" as well as the very hard to find Ringside Collectibles (signed and numbered 1,000 copies only)  ""shoot interview"" as bookends to this set you have a pretty excellent collection and can form a pretty good view of Warriors run. He goes far deeper into things on the shoot interview than he does in this 8 hour program which is match heavy (a good thing) and interspersed with comments from the Warrior which seem pretty consistent with his shoot interview and his other posts.  I guess what I'm saying is that he doesn't seem to have needed the money and is ready to white wash over his past comments which would have even been worse for his legacy than continuing to stay away from the WWF/E. Also , while the previous set WWE issued was a smear job it did a pretty good job of going into much of the Warrior story that oddly was better than this bigger set.Bottom line for me is that while watching and thinking it just missed, it's still 8 hours of Warrior I never thought we'd get and I can't give it less than 5 stars for that alone. If you are a big fan check out the Shoot Interview..... he pulled no punches and his true personality is on display there for sure.UPDATE 4/8/14 .... like everybody else I was mortified to hear of this man's passing at the young age of 54.. after watching him with his family at the Hall Of Fame and even last night on RAW... he seemed a man with everything to live for... but he was sweating a lot and didn't look very healthy. I can't get the image of his wife and small daughters along with his mom out of my mind. The profession of wrestler/entertainer surely seems to be far too full of similar stories.
