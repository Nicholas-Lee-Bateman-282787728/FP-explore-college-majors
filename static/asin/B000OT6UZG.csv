Often disturbing, but always thought-provoking in the way the film evolves, ""Lockout"" seems to take a few viewings before the backbone of (just what) is taking place becomes clear.I'll admit...

1065266,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B000OT6UZG,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[2, 4]","Usually, ripping on a film is kind of fun (despite the flood of ""No"" votes such behavior attracts).  And rest assured; I am going to rip this as it truly deserves.  However, I'm actually going to feel bad complaining about this movie for a lot of reasons. I guess I should crank up the shredder and start the ripping...-DECENT ACTORS PLAYING DULL PEOPLEDo you know what the basic problem is with playing people as realistically as possible?  They're just damn dull!!  That's right; you, me and just about everyone else in this world would make a dull movie character.  That's why most films are about remarkable people or ordinary people in remarkable situations.  This film has a lot of ordinary people doing a lot of nothing for about the first hour. There is lots of complaining, introspection, and driving around.  Yet, these are people we've all seen or met or know.  The actors actually did a very good job.  The problem is the story didn't give them much to do for the first hour.-A CLEVER STORY THAT BORED ME TO TEARS.How's that for being conflicted?  The biggest problem with this story is that all the boring and seemingly incoherent events that take place in the first three quarters of the film only have meaning during the last 5 minutes.  Until then, even though I suspected it was getting to a point, I was still bored.  As it turned out, all the little introspective moments and seemingly mundane events were actually building a case for mental breakdown.  It was still boring.Aside from my boredom, I really had trouble buying into the motivation for some of the people's actions and some things never do get properly explained.  A guy just loses his job and his first reaction is to move from his Chicago suburban apartment into his rundown, isolated Wisconsin farm house, and his wife also thinks it's a good idea.  Yea, that would cheer me up too.  What about that hitchhiker?  She's alive, she's dead, she's alive, she's dead... ...WTF?  Trust me, that never makes sense.  This is the first reason I'm sticking it to this film; Good story, bad screenplay.-I SUSPECTED HOW IT WAS GOING TO END AFTER 20 MINUTESI'm going to say some stuff now that could very easily spoil this movie if you are inclined to watch it.  I won't say anything specific about how this ends (which is key), but just by telling you what I noticed, you may figure it out.  SO BEWARE.  This is a poor mans version of ""High Tension"" without the high tension.  There, I spoiled it.  If you haven't seen that particular French film (which I happen to like), then just let me say that it had a big cheating ending.  You know; you couldn't know the killer because you were seeing events through the wrong eyes?  ""High Tension"" ticked off a lot of people when it ended.  ""Lockout"" will tick you off after the first 20 minutes and then it will tick you off again at the end.  The worst ploy used was the voyeuristic mystery camera in the bushes, watching the protagonists from afar.  It turns out there is nobody watching at all.  That's really cheap!  The funny thing is, I suspected who the killer was very early in the film. I just needed to wait and find out how they were going to explain it.  It turns out they couldn't do it without cheating. This is the second reason I'm deriding this film; Cheating on a grand scale while still being predictable.-MEANINGFUL SEX AND MEANINGLESS GORE.Let's talk about sex, baby!!  Sorry about that.  Would you ever want to see yourself having sex?  I wouldn't.  It rarely works out as well as in the movies, visually speaking.  One sex scene is like watching yourself (I would suspect).  The important thing is what's going on in their minds and not in the bed.  Another sex scene simply explains the mindset of a character in order to explain later events.  Also, a mysterious dark couple partakes in asphyxiation-sex which surprisingly has a purpose.  So, the sex scenes are full of meaning.The gore in this film is close up and graphic.  I really didn't see any sense to it at all.  The implication of brutality would have done more for me.  The gore here was the definition of ""gratuitous"".  If you see no problem with that, keep in mind it really only occurs in the last 20 minutes of the film and only a couple of times.-WHAT""S ALL THIS ABOUT SPANISH, DOC?I'm not certain what the point of this was but every authority figure in this film was Spanish speaking.  The lead character gets fired by his Spanish speaking boss for not knowing how to speak a second language which gets the ball rolling in this film.  Are there a lot of Spanish speaking doctors in Wisconsin?  Is all this part of the psychosis?  In the end, it turns out to be some mysterious Spanish American psychosis conspiracy.  You think I'm joking?  I think the Director was.  However, this joke was completely over (or under?) my head.  Obviously, I'm not sure what he was getting at.  But don't think I'm joking; it is part of this movie.-BUT I DO FEEL BAD.Director Ricardo Islas is a remarkable character himself.  Here is a guy who made his first horror film at the age of 16.  He literally hoodwinked a south-of-the-border TV station to produce his film if he got enough sponsors.  Of course, he did.  The funny part is, all involved agreed to make his film because they were convinced he'd never get it going.  After watching his interview, I fell in love with his attitude and love for horror films.  He actually did a great job making this very low budget independent horror film.  He did a good job of directing his actors.  He even had a very thoughtful concept.  If only it could have been more interesting and less deceptive.  I didn't agree with his use of gore either.  I normally cut slack for low budget films, but Islas clearly knows how to use his limited resources.  It's funny; I think everyone who made this film has a lot of talent.  Yet, I would not recommend this film due to its lack of entertainment value and unfortunate deceptions to move the plot.Actors......4 StarsIdea.........3 StarsExecution...3 StarsFun..........1.2 StarsCheat........1 StarAverage....2.44 Stars",2,Spanish Speaking America's Psychosis Conspiracy!!

1065269,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000OT6UZG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Lockout (Ricardo Islas, 2006)While Lockout does not have the lowest rating on IMDB, not by a longshot, a trip through the comments section is quite telling. This is a movie that seems to be universally loathed. And I don't mean it's just people saying ""you know, this movie kinda sucks."" This is a movie that inspires passionate hatred in those who've seen it. Seemingly all of them. And I think I understand why; while it is labeled as a horror film, and was marketed as a horror film, Lockout really isn't a horror film. In fact, with the exception of a very few scenes, nothing about Lockout says ""horror film"" in the least. If you approach it as a kind of ""minority drama"" (for lack of a better term), on the other hand, Lockout, with its white-flight-leading-to-weird-goings-on plot and closet-racist protagonist, is an immensely satisfying journey. As a low-rent art film, as a friend of mine always said, ""that [censored for Amazon consumption] is boss."" It reminds me of--and I kid you not here--Jon Jost. Yeah, it's that good.Dan (Kris Desautels) is not all that likable a guy, but you know, you can kinda identify with him. He's having a pretty bad time of things. After an opening scene which doesn't seem to connect to anything (be patient), we look in on Dan's life as he's being laid off by his Hispanic boss because his job's been outsourced to Mumbai (""India. That's where Mumbai is.""). After he leaves work, he starts noticing the number of people around him who talk in accents, or in foreign languages. Dan's the kind of guy who thinks that maybe these folks oughta all go back where they came from. At least, that's the idea you get...until he gets home and you find he's married to Chris (Cyn Dulay), a Hispanic Pacific Islander, and they're living with Chris' sister Rowena (Claire Davenport). Concerned about money now that he's laid off, Dan suggests the family rent out the place in the big city and go live in the big ancestral pile in rural Wisconsin (see the white-flight thing?). Rural Wisconsin, as it turns out, is a pretty darned weird place.Toss the idea of this as a horror film. Really, just eliminate it from your skull. Think of Dan as a modern variation on Tom, the protagonist of Jost's Last Chants for a Slow Dance. He's maybe a little more sympathetic, since Jost offers us no way to ever empathize with Tom, while Islas actually seems to go out of his way to present Dan as a multi-faceted, eminently empathetic (if not likable) character. I mean, you've got a racist (and when I call Dan a racist, bear in mind that I'm talking about the normally-unconscious kind of stuff that is normally referred to as ""white privilege"" attitude) who's married to a minority character. She may be drop-dead gorgeous, but she's not passing. We've already got a guy who's got to be conflicted, and you put him in a situation (and a realistic situation it is; I'm sure we all have at least an acquaintance who's faced this circumstance) that exacerbates that conflict. Then you simply let him go and see what happens. Sure, there are other pieces of this that don't have anything to do with Dan and his whiteness complex. Rowena was trying to eke out a living as a professional dominatrix in the city (while hiding the income from her sister), and wants to try and keep up the practice in Wisconsin; her first tentative step towards that puts both her and Dan at odds with a strange local family. This seems to be the root of the horror-movie storyline in the film, but it's almost treated as an afterthought here (another reason why this should have been marketed as an indie art film rather than a low-budget horror flick). There's also some oddness about a body in the basement and a festering spider bite (and, of course, the spider bite is  yet another symbol of Dan's conflicted spirit). But none of this stuff necessarily points to a horror film. I'm serious--watch this as a double feature with Last Chants for a Slow Dance and it will suddenly all become clear to you. It's not even that there's a brilliant movie lurking under the surface here; it's right out there for everyone to see, and the only problem with it was the marketing. See this movie, and combat those on IMDB who castigated it because it's not a horror movie. ****",4,Another surprising low-budget gem.,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,4267,"['Lockout', 'Ricardo', 'Islas', '2006', 'Lockout', 'not', 'have', 'lowest', 'rating', 'IMDB', 'not', 'longshot', 'trip', 'comments', 'section', 'quite', 'telling', 'movie', 'be', 'universally', 'loathed', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'people', 'saying', 'know', 'movie', 'kinda', 'sucks', 'movie', 'passionate', 'hatred', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Seemingly', 'think', 'understand', 'why', 'labeled', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'horror', 'film', 'Lockout', 'really', ""n't"", 'horror', 'film', 'fact', 'exception', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'Lockout', 'horror', 'film', 'least', 'approach', 'kind', 'minority', 'drama', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'other', 'hand', 'Lockout', 'white-flight-leading-to-weird-goings-on', 'plot', 'closet-racist', 'protagonist', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'journey', 'low-rent', 'art', 'film', 'friend', 'mine', 'always', 'said', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'boss', 'kid', 'not', 'here', 'Jon', 'Jost', 'Yeah', 'good.Dan', 'Kris', 'Desautels', 'not', 'likable', 'guy', 'know', 'can', 'kinda', 'identify', 'having', 'pretty', 'bad', 'time', 'things', 'opening', 'scene', ""n't"", 'seem', 'connect', 'anything', 'be', 'patient', 'look', 'Dan', 'life', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'Hispanic', 'boss', 'job', 'been', 'outsourced', 'Mumbai', 'India', 'where', 'Mumbai', 'is.', 'work', 'noticing', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'accents', 'foreign', 'languages', 'Dan', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'maybe', 'folks', 'oughta', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'came', 'least', 'idea', 'get', 'home', 'find', 'married', 'Chris', 'Cyn', 'Dulay', 'Hispanic', 'Pacific', 'Islander', ""'re"", 'living', 'Chris', 'sister', 'Rowena', 'Claire', 'Davenport', 'Concerned', 'money', 'now', 'laid', 'off', 'Dan', 'family', 'rent', 'place', 'big', 'city', 'go', 'live', 'big', 'ancestral', 'pile', 'rural', 'Wisconsin', 'see', 'white-flight', 'thing', 'Rural', 'Wisconsin', 'out', 'pretty', 'darned', 'weird', 'idea', 'horror', 'film', 'Really', 'just', 'eliminate', 'skull', 'Think', 'Dan', 'modern', 'variation', 'Tom', 'protagonist', 'Jost', 'Last', 'Chants', 'Slow', 'Dance', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Jost', 'offers', 'way', 'ever', 'empathize', 'Tom', 'Islas', 'actually', 'go', 'way', 'present', 'Dan', 'multi-faceted', 'eminently', 'empathetic', 'not', 'likable', 'character', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'got', 'racist', 'when', 'call', 'Dan', 'racist', 'bear', 'mind', ""'m"", 'talking', 'normally-unconscious', 'kind', 'stuff', 'normally', 'referred', 'white', 'privilege', 'attitude', 'who', 'married', 'minority', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'passing', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'be', 'conflicted', 'put', 'situation', 'realistic', 'situation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'least', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'faced', 'circumstance', 'conflict', 'Then', 'simply', 'let', 'go', 'see', 'what', 'Sure', 'are', 'other', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Dan', 'whiteness', 'complex', 'Rowena', 'was', 'trying', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'professional', 'dominatrix', 'city', 'hiding', 'income', 'sister', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'practice', 'Wisconsin', 'first', 'tentative', 'step', 'towards', 'Dan', 'odds', 'strange', 'local', 'family', 'be', 'root', 'horror-movie', 'storyline', 'film', 'almost', 'treated', 'afterthought', 'here', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'indie', 'art', 'film', 'rather', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'also', 'oddness', 'body', 'basement', 'festering', 'spider', 'bite', 'course', 'spider', 'bite', 'yet', 'symbol', 'Dan', 'conflicted', 'spirit', 'none', 'stuff', 'necessarily', 'horror', 'film', ""'m"", 'serious', 'watch', 'double', 'feature', 'Last', 'Chants', 'Slow', 'Dance', 'will', 'suddenly', 'become', 'clear', 'not', 'even', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'lurking', 'surface', 'here', 'right', 'there', 'everyone', 'see', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'marketing', 'See', 'movie', 'combat', 'IMDB', 'who', 'castigated', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', '****']",Lockout
