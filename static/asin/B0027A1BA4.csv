It was my first rental and I don't know if the terrible connection was my new computer or with Amazon. Although the video is worth watching I was glad I viewed it as a rental and didn't have to sit in anticipation for it's arrival. It was a very well made documentary and it's worth watching just to see his ""stripper"" friend. These were everyday people telling the story of their lost friend including a Kevin Von Erich who didn't bother to get out of the hot tub to do the interview. I can only give it 3 stars because there was nothing truly outstanding about the material. I'd like to see a series of these featuring World Class Wrestling stars like Gino Hernandez.",3,Just ok,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,727,"['made', 'decision', 'view', 'rental', 'Amazon', 'was', 'first', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'terrible', 'connection', 'was', 'new', 'computer', 'Amazon', 'video', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'glad', 'viewed', 'rental', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'anticipation', 'arrival', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'stripper', 'friend', 'were', 'everyday', 'people', 'telling', 'story', 'lost', 'friend', 'including', 'Kevin', 'Von', 'Erich', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'get', 'hot', 'tub', 'do', 'interview', 'can', 'only', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'nothing', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'material', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'series', 'featuring', 'World', 'Class', 'Wrestling', 'stars', 'Gino', 'Hernandez']",Gentleman's Choice
1253815,AJA89FNC1J1FT,B0027A1BA4,J. Nelson,"[1, 1]","I am a fan of professional wrestling, its history, and (sometimes to my shame) the controversial elements that live within that history. One story I've looked forward to hearing was that of Chris Adams. I'm big on documentary films, especially retrospective pieces involving professional wrestling, so I took a chance on it, and paid the hefty $20 price tag (I generally buy used items, but the story intrigued me).I thought the entire project was sloppy. The ""stat sheet"" type graphics that would pop-up 10-20 seconds after each new person would speak was distracting, the location of the interviews was distracting (Ex-wife sitting on a spacious park lawn, Von Erich in a jacuzzi the whole time, etc), the fact that many of the people being interviewed were done so over different periods of time made it a harder than it should have been to keep up with. In many cases (especially with the women), their appearances changed. Lastly, This documentary looks like it was shot on a $100 camera, and no budget. Sometimes that can be magic, this wasn't one of those times.",1,Sloppy effort,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,1069,"['am', 'fan', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'history', 'sometimes', 'shame', 'controversial', 'elements', 'live', 'history', 'One', 'story', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'forward', 'hearing', 'was', 'Chris', 'Adams', ""'m"", 'big', 'documentary', 'films', 'especially', 'retrospective', 'pieces', 'involving', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'took', 'chance', 'paid', 'hefty', '20', 'price', 'tag', 'generally', 'buy', 'used', 'items', 'story', 'intrigued', 'thought', 'entire', 'project', 'was', 'sloppy', 'stat', 'sheet', 'type', 'graphics', 'would', 'pop-up', '10-20', 'seconds', 'new', 'person', 'would', 'speak', 'was', 'distracting', 'location', 'interviews', 'was', 'distracting', 'Ex-wife', 'sitting', 'spacious', 'park', 'lawn', 'Von', 'Erich', 'jacuzzi', 'whole', 'time', 'etc', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'being', 'interviewed', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'different', 'periods', 'time', 'made', 'harder', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'keep', 'up', 'many', 'cases', 'especially', 'women', 'appearances', 'changed', 'Lastly', 'documentary', 'was', 'shot', '100', 'camera', 'budget', 'can', 'be', 'magic', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'times']",Gentleman's Choice

1253818,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,B0027A1BA4,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[1, 3]",This is an interesting story and worth telling. I saw the documentary on the Von Erichs and World Class and loved it. I thought this movie was being done by the same person. Obviously after watching it it was not. The World Class/Von Erich documentary 'Heroes of World Class' is fantastic. This is worth watching if you were a fan but don't expect it to be anywhere near as good. There are some interesting things in there about the drug GHB and its abuse. Hated and found the music and the quick cutaways during the documentary very annoying.This is a documentary about some very unpleasant and unsavory people. It is a story of a rise to stardom and the inevitable fall leading to tragedy. Couldn't wait for it to come out when I saw the trailer but then when I got it I just didn't think it was that good. I even rewatched it the next day and again after writing my initial review. Perhaps it is unfair to compare it to the 'Heroes of World Class' documentary but it is my honest reaction.
