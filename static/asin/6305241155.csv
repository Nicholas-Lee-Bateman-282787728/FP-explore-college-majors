Much like the Tenchi Universe series, Tenchi In Tokyo is yet another radical retelling of the same story. And like Tenchi Universe, Tenchi In Tokyo really pales in comparison to the original and still the best OAV series. Although it falls short of living up its OAV heritage, it's not a bad series by any stretch of the imagination. It's still fun and goofy, but it lacks polish and scale that made people gravitate to Tenchi in the first place. Thankfully, there's the manga out there to continue the original story line.",3,Don't Call This A Sequel,977875200,"12 27, 2000",2000,647,"['New', 'Start', 'fitting', 'name', 'disc', 'relation', 'whatsoever', 'previous', 'Tenchi', 'story', 'lines', 'Much', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'series', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'yet', 'radical', 'retelling', 'same', 'story', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'really', 'comparison', 'original', 'still', 'best', 'OAV', 'series', 'short', 'living', 'up', 'OAV', 'heritage', 'not', 'bad', 'series', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'still', 'fun', 'goofy', 'polish', 'scale', 'made', 'people', 'gravitate', 'Tenchi', 'first', 'place', 'Thankfully', 'manga', 'there', 'continue', 'original', 'story', 'line']","Tenchi in Tokyo, Vol. 1: A New Start"

TV series ever made.  I love the whole Tenchi universe, but not Tenchi In Tokyo.  ""Tenchi in Hell"" might be a better title for this so-so series.Tenchi In Tokyo features two new cast members, Yugi and Sakuya.  Yugi is a super mutant created on Jurai 3,600 years ago. She is sent to Earth (god knows why). 3,600 years later, Yugi is awakened. Yugi wants her own kingdom to replace Earth. Her ""Kingdom"" is made out of crystals and three of her servants that she made.  Sakuya is a girl that Tenchi meets while in Tokyo.Sakuya is disliked by Akeya and the others at the household of Masaki (gee, i wonder why).Yugi and her three servants create bizzare and useless spirits, such as the Cell-phone god and the Marriage Goddess. These spirits causes mayhem for Tenchi and the gang.The animation is poor, the characters look a little different, and the plot is weak.  However, I think it's worth watching the entire series at least once.

It startes out as a stupid plot with dumb background music. Since when does Tenchi wanted to be a priest like his grandfather. In the other series Tenchi was training for unknown purposes, but in this series he goes to some dumpy city called Tokyo to learn to be a Shento priest. There was a lot of spoofs from that popular show Sailor Moon. The villans are completely lame. Darn they even got rid of Noboyuki's Homer Simpson sounding voice and replaced it with a cliche father sounding voice. Ryo-Ohki sides with Sassammi than with Ryoko which really bites. Giving Tenchi a girl friend who is just as ugly as Ayeka takes the cake. Most of the characters except Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sakura are seldomly used.

Regarding the video, no subtitles are provided, nor are you even told which character in the Tenchi series the singer played. The commercial doesn't have subtitles, either.This also has to be one of the poorest DVD menus I've seen. It's not obvious on the main screen when you've selected something; the buttons are different colors, shapes, and placements; and you'll have to go through two screens and several button presses to change from the default English to Japanese language with subtitles.

Don't get me wrong here, I absolutely loved the OAV and the first TV series. However, the animation here is subpar and the characters are somewhat--non appealing. The storyline is different and so is the fact on how the girls came to Earth. Typically, the animators were cursed--the faces are completely weirder than the other series and the eyes are so ugly! They should have taken their time, because it seems like they rushed. Also, they need to revise their new characters, especially Sakuya Kumashiro. She is somewhat of a nuisance after you hear her voice over and over again in your head. The humor is still there. I laughed my head off when the girls go off to Tokyo in search for yen.

I'm am an avid Tenchi fan and own the Tenchi Muyo OVA and Tenchi Universe box sets and have watched both series several times they are that good of Anime. I could not believe what I got myself into when I watched this mess with Tenchi in the title.  I thank God that I watched Tenchi in Tokyo when it was on Cartoon Network when I was a kid and not waste good money on it (breath of relief).  I thought I was missing something back then, but now that I am older and still watch Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe, it is more evident to me how bad this series is.  But why is it so bad?!  The artwork is horrible, for example the characters' eyes are tiny lifeless pupils instead of the big, bright and shining irises they usually have.  The characters are completely different and unsympathetic including Princess Ayeka who is a character I have always loved and cared for, but is portrayed in Tenchi in Tokyo as a psychotic maniac.  However the most important factor is Tenchi himself who is vastly different acting as a cold, inept person towards his friends as if he does not want to have anything to do with them.  Watching the series I will never understand why Tenchi falls for the plain Sakuya, wanting to be with her instead of the colorful ladies in his life. To put it simply, there was never a moment in the entire series where I felt attached or cared what happened to her.  In truth I did not care about Tenchi or anybody in ""Tokyo"" at all unlike in Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe where you fall in love with the characters they become apart of your life.  In addition to the terrible treatment of the protagonist,  Tenchi in Tokyo had a very bland antagonist in the form of Yugi who never performs any of her mischief and instead sits back and allows her work to take control by itself.  This would be acceptable except she is used in this fashion for every episode stripping her of a real evil persona.  Yugi is far inferior when matched with the villains in T.M. and T.U.  I am grateful the story elements in Tenchi in Tokyo were changed and altered with no connection to the other two wonderful series.  The music again was a big minus grounding the look and feel of the show in the realm of a teen soap opera instead of the majestic scores that gave T.M and T.U a grand, epic universe. For those of you who are watching Tenchi for the first time avoid Tenchi in Tokyo and stay with Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe. I do not consider Tenchi in Tokyo a Tenchi series at all but a poorly executed anime.",1,Disgrace to Tenchi's name!!,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2620,"['who', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'awful', 'series', ""'m"", 'hear', 'tell', 'are', 'correct', ""'m"", 'am', 'avid', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'own', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'OVA', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'box', 'sets', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'are', 'good', 'Anime', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'what', 'got', 'when', 'watched', 'mess', 'Tenchi', 'title', 'thank', 'God', 'watched', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'when', 'was', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'not', 'waste', 'good', 'money', 'breath', 'relief', 'thought', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'back', 'then', 'now', 'am', 'older', 'still', 'watch', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'more', 'evident', 'how', 'bad', 'series', 'why', 'so', 'bad', 'artwork', 'horrible', 'example', 'characters', 'eyes', 'are', 'tiny', 'lifeless', 'pupils', 'instead', 'big', 'bright', 'shining', 'irises', 'usually', 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'unsympathetic', 'including', 'Princess', 'Ayeka', 'who', 'character', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'cared', 'portrayed', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'psychotic', 'maniac', 'However', 'most', 'important', 'factor', 'Tenchi', 'who', 'vastly', 'different', 'acting', 'cold', 'inept', 'person', 'friends', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Watching', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'Tenchi', 'plain', 'Sakuya', 'wanting', 'be', 'instead', 'colorful', 'ladies', 'life', 'put', 'simply', 'was', 'never', 'moment', 'entire', 'series', 'where', 'felt', 'attached', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'truth', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Tenchi', 'anybody', 'Tokyo', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'where', 'fall', 'love', 'characters', 'become', 'apart', 'life', 'addition', 'terrible', 'treatment', 'protagonist', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'had', 'very', 'bland', 'antagonist', 'form', 'Yugi', 'who', 'never', 'mischief', 'instead', 'sits', 'back', 'work', 'take', 'control', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'used', 'fashion', 'episode', 'stripping', 'real', 'evil', 'persona', 'Yugi', 'far', 'inferior', 'when', 'matched', 'villains', 'T.M', 'T.U', 'am', 'grateful', 'story', 'elements', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'were', 'changed', 'altered', 'connection', 'other', 'two', 'wonderful', 'series', 'music', 'again', 'was', 'big', 'minus', 'grounding', 'look', 'feel', 'show', 'realm', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera', 'instead', 'majestic', 'scores', 'gave', 'T.M', 'T.U', 'grand', 'epic', 'universe', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'Tenchi', 'first', 'time', 'avoid', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'stay', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'poorly', 'executed', 'anime']","Tenchi in Tokyo, Vol. 1: A New Start"

455890,A3YBZUEL8FU23,6305241155,Jill McAlester,"[0, 0]","Granted, there are things I don't care for in the ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" series.  The backstory of how Tenchi and the girls came to live together is, in my opinion, the least interesting of the three Tenchi ""realities"" presented by the series.  But I found this series intriguing for several reasons.First...in this series, Tenchi seems more like a real boy in real life situations.  Yes, he still lives in a house with a space pirate, space cops, a crazed genius, two alien princesses, etc., but being sent off to school in Tokyo is a very realistic situation for Tenchi to find himself in.  He makes friends, he meets the popular yet enigmatic Sakuya, and the awkward beginnings of their relationship is very sweet and touching to watch.  It's the first time we get to see Tenchi as a normal boy falling in love with a normal girl.  Although we find out later that Sakuya isn't who she seems to be, the tender, tentative moments they share as their relationship grows are priceless.The rest of the gang find themselves having to deal with more realistic situations as well...they find that it takes a lot of money to run such a large household, and they have to venture out to find jobs in order to buy food and pay bills. This, plus Yugi's efforts to break up the Masaki household with her intriguing band of ""shadows"" does give ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" a darker, harsher reality than the other two series, but that does not mean that there are no laughs to be had, and no shortage of touching moments.  Relationships get strained and tested to their limits, but in this we get to see the real depth of feelings that the Tenchi gang has for one another.  This is what makes it impossible for Yugi to defeat them, despite her efforts to divide and conquer.  It's also what is able for them to ""save"" Yugi in true Tenchi style.It's a very different story than we got used to in the two earlier Tenchi series, but for me, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.  The animation isn't as good, true, but the story is solid and captivating as it explores the strengths and weaknesses of all the familiar, beloved Tenchi characters.",4,Different does not equal bad...at least not to me!,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2117,"['Granted', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'series', 'backstory', 'how', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'came', 'live', 'together', 'opinion', 'least', 'interesting', 'three', 'Tenchi', 'realities', 'presented', 'series', 'found', 'series', 'intriguing', 'several', 'reasons.First', 'series', 'Tenchi', 'more', 'real', 'boy', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'Yes', 'still', 'house', 'space', 'pirate', 'space', 'cops', 'crazed', 'genius', 'two', 'alien', 'princesses', 'etc.', 'being', 'sent', 'off', 'school', 'Tokyo', 'very', 'realistic', 'situation', 'Tenchi', 'find', 'friends', 'popular', 'yet', 'enigmatic', 'Sakuya', 'awkward', 'beginnings', 'relationship', 'very', 'sweet', 'touching', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'Tenchi', 'normal', 'boy', 'falling', 'love', 'normal', 'girl', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'Sakuya', ""n't"", 'who', 'be', 'tender', 'tentative', 'moments', 'share', 'relationship', 'grows', 'are', 'priceless.The', 'rest', 'gang', 'find', 'having', 'deal', 'more', 'realistic', 'situations', 'well', 'find', 'lot', 'money', 'run', 'large', 'household', 'have', 'venture', 'out', 'find', 'jobs', 'order', 'buy', 'food', 'pay', 'bills', 'Yugi', 'efforts', 'break', 'up', 'Masaki', 'household', 'intriguing', 'band', 'shadows', 'give', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'darker', 'harsher', 'reality', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'shortage', 'touching', 'moments', 'Relationships', 'get', 'strained', 'tested', 'limits', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'depth', 'feelings', 'Tenchi', 'gang', 'one', 'impossible', 'Yugi', 'defeat', 'efforts', 'divide', 'conquer', 'also', 'what', 'able', 'save', 'Yugi', 'true', 'Tenchi', 'style.It', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'got', 'used', 'two', 'earlier', 'Tenchi', 'series', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'animation', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'true', 'story', 'solid', 'captivating', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'familiar', 'beloved', 'Tenchi', 'characters']","Tenchi in Tokyo, Vol. 1: A New Start"

This series is for teenagers. A lot of things have changed. Tenchi is off to Tokyo to start high school. One of Tenchi's old friends from the original Tenchi Muyo is back in here and once again another women is after Tenchi and so is a new enemy. The reason for this is not yet given and why Sakuya is all over Tenchi is anyones guess. Fortunetely for the girls back home, they can visit Tenchi through the dimentional tunnel, developed by Washu. The main point of this series is basically focused on the comedy. Thats why you'll notice there is some super deformity. The gag of the girls always trying to get to see Tenchi follows throughout the series and is sometimes funny.

Then we find ourselves at the Masaki household, where we learn that Tenchi is going to study for two years in Tokyo, so he can, one day, replace his grandfather as the shrine master.  The girls are, of course, very upset, but Tenchi is very firm on the plan and leaves for Tokyo.While it seems like Tenchi and the girls might be serparated, in truth they are not, as Washu has invented a Inter-Dimensional Tunnel which would allow the girls to visit Tenchi ALL the time.That COULD be a problem for Tenchi's social life, as the girls are jealous and dangerous.  So when he bumps into a cute classmate, Sakuya, he knows he is in deep trouble.But the girls are not the only ones watching him.  Yugi is watching and will try all she can to split up the group.  This new life might not just be the end of the world for the alien girls, but maybe the end of the world FOR real!While I gave this DVD only four points, I do enjoy the songs and I have a soft place in my heart for the third episode, &quot;Long Distance Lunacy&quot; which isn't just funny, but is also the first Tenchi cartoon I ever saw.",4,The first DVD of the Tenchi In Tokyo TV series.,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,1222,"['first', 'episode', 'watching', 'something', 'series', 'shrines', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'meet', 'Yugi', 'Then', 'find', 'Masaki', 'household', 'where', 'learn', 'Tenchi', 'going', 'study', 'two', 'years', 'Tokyo', 'can', 'one', 'day', 'replace', 'grandfather', 'shrine', 'master', 'girls', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'upset', 'Tenchi', 'very', 'firm', 'plan', 'Tokyo.While', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'might', 'be', 'serparated', 'truth', 'are', 'not', 'Washu', 'invented', 'Inter-Dimensional', 'Tunnel', 'would', 'allow', 'girls', 'visit', 'Tenchi', 'ALL', 'time.That', 'COULD', 'be', 'problem', 'Tenchi', 'social', 'life', 'girls', 'are', 'jealous', 'dangerous', 'So', 'when', 'cute', 'classmate', 'Sakuya', 'deep', 'trouble.But', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'watching', 'Yugi', 'watching', 'will', 'try', 'can', 'split', 'up', 'group', 'new', 'life', 'might', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'alien', 'girls', 'maybe', 'end', 'world', 'FOR', 'real', 'gave', 'DVD', 'only', 'four', 'points', 'do', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'have', 'soft', 'place', 'heart', 'third', 'episode', 'quot', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Lunacy', 'quot', ""n't"", 'just', 'funny', 'also', 'first', 'Tenchi', 'cartoon', 'ever', 'saw']","Tenchi in Tokyo, Vol. 1: A New Start"

Then I got passed the first 10 minutes and realized this serise was going straight to hell. Tenchi Muyo is a SciFI/Romanitc Comedy, not a fast passed silly anime like Excel Saga of Dragon Half. The list of bad features goes on.- The art is terrible. Looks nothing like the original beautiful art style of the OVA and T.V. show.- The music is God awful. It's like listening to the soundtrack of DBZ or even worse, the Yu Yu Hakusho movie. They should have just stuck with the synth music.- This is by far the worst dub Tenchi Muyo has ever faced. Which is really sad because the previous dubs were really good. They added way too much idiotic diologue that ruins even some of the bad gags.- Sakuya is about as interesting as wire.
