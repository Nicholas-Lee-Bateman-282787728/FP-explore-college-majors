From Fang's mother, make-up and housekeeping tips, ""The Phyllis Diller Charm & Finishing School"", and a slew of celebrity guest-stars, this DVD takes you on an hilarious trip back in time to Phyllis Diller's heydey as the reigning comedy queen of television.Highlights:  Don Rickles, Terry-Thomas and Diller in the ""hijacked aeroplane"" skit; Diller in beach gear singing ""Music to Watch Girls By"" with Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello and Phil Harris; and the King Sisters joining Diller in fright wigs and blue chiffon for graduation day at ""Phyllis Diller's Charm & Finishing School"".The signature stand-up comedy monologues with Diller have lost some of their bite with the passing years; yet Diller's keen sense of oddball humour and self-deprecating wit, in itself, remains as timeless as ever.

She was a guest on several TV programs in the 1960s and 1970s and even had her own show for a while (as mentioned in one of the skits).

1022450,A1AVY1ZIL5KLOT,B000IU3XRY,ScoreTheFilm,"[0, 0]","It took me a while but I finally found out this was from a variety show called THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE that ran from '64 to '70 and it was guest hosted weekly on Saturday nights by people like Sammy Davis Jr., Don Adams, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and other child beaters.  This DVD runs about an hour and is just clips of Diller's monologues along with some skits with Don Rickles and others.  The best ones were with her, Rickles and Terry-Thomas (from 1969) who kept flubbing his lines and laughing hysterically.  The canned laughter is is an assault on the ears but that's what you got with TV comedy for decades and there's no avoiding that.Whoever put this brief compilation together didn't pay close enough attention.  Diller's monologues repeat jokes.  It's bad enough that it happened at all but at least you had a few weeks, months or years between hearing them as they originally aired.  You've got to be Leonard from MEMENTO (2000) to not notice it while watching this DVD.  I really dig Diller but she laughs a lot during her monologues and you get more than you can handle when they're strung together for long stretches at a time and it's interrupted by that annoying canned laughter.  You could say she's the female Bob Hope with a mix of Rodney Dangerfield.  She's very much a self-deprecating comic.  Her best joke on this release is when she's talking about being old, &#34;My G-string is clear on down to D flat.&#34;  Now THAT'S funny!  The MPI DVD has a couple of extras, a soap commercial with Diller and a 7-minute segment from a 1963 episode of WHAT'S MY LINE? that has as panelists Shelley Berman, Arlene Francis, Dorothy Kilgallen, Bennett Cerf, host John Daly and announcer Johnny Olson.
