How do you choose between these mothers. one took care of him when he was left alone as a baby, and halle berry clean up her act and came back to reclaim her child. The only thing I hate about movies like these is if a child's been raised by a family for so many years, and there actual parents come to take them back and may take some time for the child to adjust to them. I mean that's the only family they have know for the life. It's like another movie-the deep end of the ocean.

380145,A6IKQOVUT6AI4,6303574203,Bonita L. Davis,"[21, 21]","Isaiah is known as one of the greatest prophets of Israel. Such is the  case with this little African- American boy who was abandoned in the trash  by his crack crazed mother. Three years later his mother, now clean,  decides to reclaim her child. All of this sounds easy but little Isaiah has  been adopted by a white social worker and her family and she is determined  to keep him at all costs. The drama which unfolds before us is heart  breaking as we attempt to decide what is in the best interest of this  child.Halle Berry, Jessica Lange And Samuel Jackson give  outstanding performances in enacting the rivalry and possessive claims that  both women have on this young toddler. Poverty versus Affluence, the  feasibility of inter-racial adoptions, marital/parental stability (and  responsibility) and the do gooder mentality are themes that run their  course throughout the drama. All of these elements are dealt with in the  drama and pulls the viewer from one woman's claim to the other. Who is  right? Does pigmentation or culture matter? Above all, what has love got to  do with it?Social workers and judges in juvenile courts across the  country are daily making these decisions of terminating parental rights and  placing children in what they see as stable homes. Losing Isaiah is not a  fantasy but a present reality. How to resolve these issues of custody is  the dilemma for all involved. There are not any easy answers and  unfortunately this film ends with an &quot;easy&quot; answer which isn't  realistic.The little Isaiah in the film, like his prophet namesake  calls these adults to spiritual, moral and social accountability. His  impact makes Margaret (the social worker) deal with what is going on in her  marriage and family. Khaila, his mother, is forced to clean up her act and  become a responsible parent who shows her compassion and love for all  children. Both women lost Isaiah but both have come to grips with their own  sense of self-esteem and awareness in their loss.",4,AND A CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM,968630400,"09 11, 2000",2000,2006,"['Isaiah', 'known', 'one', 'greatest', 'prophets', 'Israel', 'Such', 'case', 'little', 'African-', 'American', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'abandoned', 'trash', 'crack', 'crazed', 'mother', 'Three', 'years', 'later', 'mother', 'now', 'clean', 'reclaim', 'child', 'easy', 'little', 'Isaiah', 'been', 'adopted', 'white', 'social', 'worker', 'family', 'determined', 'keep', 'costs', 'drama', 'heart', 'breaking', 'attempt', 'decide', 'what', 'best', 'interest', 'child.Halle', 'Berry', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'enacting', 'rivalry', 'possessive', 'claims', 'women', 'have', 'young', 'toddler', 'Poverty', 'versus', 'Affluence', 'feasibility', 'inter-racial', 'adoptions', 'marital/parental', 'stability', 'responsibility', 'do', 'gooder', 'mentality', 'are', 'themes', 'run', 'course', 'drama', 'elements', 'are', 'dealt', 'drama', 'viewer', 'one', 'woman', 'claim', 'other', 'Who', 'right', 'pigmentation', 'culture', 'matter', 'what', 'love', 'got', 'do', 'Social', 'workers', 'judges', 'juvenile', 'courts', 'country', 'are', 'daily', 'making', 'decisions', 'terminating', 'parental', 'rights', 'placing', 'children', 'what', 'see', 'stable', 'homes', 'Losing', 'Isaiah', 'not', 'fantasy', 'present', 'reality', 'How', 'resolve', 'issues', 'custody', 'dilemma', 'involved', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'answers', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'answer', ""n't"", 'realistic.The', 'little', 'Isaiah', 'film', 'prophet', 'namesake', 'adults', 'spiritual', 'moral', 'social', 'accountability', 'impact', 'Margaret', 'social', 'worker', 'deal', 'what', 'going', 'marriage', 'family', 'Khaila', 'mother', 'forced', 'clean', 'up', 'act', 'become', 'responsible', 'parent', 'who', 'compassion', 'love', 'children', 'women', 'lost', 'Isaiah', 'have', 'come', 'grips', 'own', 'sense', 'self-esteem', 'awareness', 'loss']",Losing Isaiah VHS

Williams III,"[13, 13]","Perhaps the biggest complaint I have with custody battles is that they are ultimately based around the selfishness of the adults involved, whether it be a battle between the child's mother and father, or between the biological parent(s) and the foster parent(s). ""Losing Isaiah"" is an example of a movie that uses this sad truth to tell a compelling story.Normally, I'd be quick to write off someone like Halle Berry's character (a former crack addict who abandoned her baby in an alley) as someone unfit to raise this child. I'd also be uneasy about tearing Isaiah away from the only home he's ever known. Thankfully, this film does not end there.After the courtroom decision is rendered, we see a much different Isaiah than the playful, cheerful child we first encountered. Did anyone bother to stop and ask him what he wanted? In an ideal world, someone would have. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, but at least we have people who (albeit a little slowly) realize this mistake in ""Losing Isaiah.""

And also just because you can give birth does that make you a mother?This film will leave some feeling that justice has been served, and others it will leave angry.

380150,A3942G0XBGQHRW,6303574203,Greg Johnson,"[0, 0]","As soon as the movie began I was touched by the passion of this one.  The helicopter circled above the ghetto with a bluesy trumpet and there came a woman's singing, only it sounded like suffering and agony.  Then there was Khaila with her baby.  Halle Berry didn't act like Khaila, she became Khaila.  A crack addict Khaila did the unspeakable act of leaving her baby in a box in the garbage. Later she is arrested as she staggered along in the grocery with one eyebrow raised, shoplifting and looking for all the world like she was drugged. Amazing acting by Berry.Without Khaila's knowing her baby is saved from the hydraulics of the garbage truck.Isaiah meet Margaret.  Mrs. Lewin was probably coached to be dramatic in the ER to be as pushy as possible but she comes off a nasty coworker mouthing off at doctors, cussing out judges and generally being difficult.  I was put off by her office bully behavior.  Coached or not I thought it was lousy work.  But she and the family adopt Isaiah, a crack baby.  Things get rough for the Lewin's but they stay with it and have the little boy for four years.Khaila meanwhile out of guilt and a need to change her life has gone into rehab,  learns to read, and she grieves hard.  She cannot escape and doesn't seem to want to.  She wants to feel the loss of her child and it comes out in tears at every turn.Eventually her teacher learns Isaiah is not dead.  And the main focus of the story begins.  Khaila gets with a headstrong effective Lawyer and the Lewins hire a black lawyer and a custody hearing begins.  Race is a loose cannon in the courtroom, in the bathroom, on the sidewalk.  And it is race that is a stake.  No one has a grudge against a member of the courtroom.

The choreography and the cinematography are both excellent and although they could have cut a minute or two here and there the plot moves along at a very good pace.When the action starts, we see crack addicted mother Khaila Richards (Halle Berry) putting her newborn baby Isaiah in a dumpster while she wanders off to get more crack. The next morning the garbage men discover the infant; and Isaiah is taken to a hospital where social worker Margaret Lewin (Jessica Lange) works. Margaret almost instantly takes an interest in the adorable newborn baby and she convinces her husband Charles (David Strathairn) to take in Isaiah and raise him as their own along with their biological daughter Hannah (Daisy Eagan). The fact that Isaiah is African American and the Lewins are white doesn't enter into Margaret's mind; although this might raise some issues down the road.Meanwhile, Khaila enters a rehab program and she even gets out of jail a bit early for completing the program successfully. Khaila thinks that when she threw Isaiah in the dumpster that night she killed him; but when her own social worker Gussie (Regina Taylor) informs her that now three year old Isaiah (Marc John Jefferies) is in actuality still alive and legally adopted by the Lewins, Khaila instantly wants Isaiah back. Gussie cautions Khaila that this won't be easy; and Khaila's pro bono lawyer Kadar Lewis (Samuel L. Jackson) warns Khaila that there could be some bumps in court along the way in a custody fight.But Khaila desperately wants Isaiah back. She learns to read, finds herself an apartment in a low income housing project and fixes the place up with the advice of her attorney. She begins a romantic relationship with Eddie Hughes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.); but her lawyer tells Khaila to cool it with Eddie because he's married. When Khaila does this just as she's told, we see that nothing will stop her from fighting to get Isaiah back.The court trial is full of suspense and political correctness issues soon come up along with the important issues of raising a black child to know his heritage despite the fact that he is in a white home with no black children's stories to read, black heroes to admire or black friends ever at the Lewin's dinner table. However, just when you think the ending is clear there's a curve ball surprise right at the very end of the picture that really packs a punch.Losing Isaiah is one of those truly remarkable films that choose to deal with an ongoing dilemma in society that cannot be easily resolved. The only negative I can think of is that I would have liked the film to have a scene in which they ask Isaiah what HE would like; but then again the answer to that question becomes somewhat clearer at the end of the film. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; and people interested in social issues and the issues regarding adoption will want to get this DVD as well.",4,fine drama with great acting,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,3035,"['Losing', 'Isaiah', 'fine', 'movie', 'drama', 'suspense', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'very', 'convincing', 'too', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'minute', 'two', 'here', 'there', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace.When', 'action', 'see', 'crack', 'addicted', 'mother', 'Khaila', 'Richards', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'putting', 'newborn', 'baby', 'Isaiah', 'dumpster', 'get', 'more', 'crack', 'next', 'morning', 'garbage', 'men', 'discover', 'infant', 'Isaiah', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'social', 'worker', 'Margaret', 'Lewin', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Margaret', 'almost', 'instantly', 'interest', 'adorable', 'newborn', 'baby', 'husband', 'Charles', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'take', 'Isaiah', 'raise', 'own', 'biological', 'daughter', 'Hannah', 'Daisy', 'Eagan', 'fact', 'Isaiah', 'African', 'American', 'Lewins', 'are', 'white', ""n't"", 'enter', 'Margaret', 'mind', 'might', 'raise', 'issues', 'down', 'road.Meanwhile', 'Khaila', 'rehab', 'program', 'even', 'jail', 'bit', 'early', 'completing', 'program', 'successfully', 'Khaila', 'when', 'threw', 'Isaiah', 'dumpster', 'night', 'killed', 'when', 'own', 'social', 'worker', 'Gussie', 'Regina', 'Taylor', 'now', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'Isaiah', 'Marc', 'John', 'Jefferies', 'actuality', 'still', 'alive', 'legally', 'adopted', 'Lewins', 'Khaila', 'instantly', 'Isaiah', 'back', 'Gussie', 'cautions', 'Khaila', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'Khaila', 'pro', 'bono', 'lawyer', 'Kadar', 'Lewis', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Khaila', 'could', 'be', 'bumps', 'court', 'way', 'custody', 'fight.But', 'Khaila', 'desperately', 'Isaiah', 'back', 'read', 'apartment', 'low', 'income', 'housing', 'project', 'fixes', 'place', 'up', 'advice', 'attorney', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Eddie', 'Hughes', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'lawyer', 'Khaila', 'cool', 'Eddie', 'married', 'When', 'Khaila', 'just', 'told', 'see', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'fighting', 'get', 'Isaiah', 'back.The', 'court', 'trial', 'full', 'suspense', 'political', 'correctness', 'issues', 'soon', 'come', 'up', 'along', 'important', 'issues', 'raising', 'black', 'child', 'know', 'heritage', 'fact', 'white', 'home', 'black', 'children', 'stories', 'read', 'black', 'heroes', 'admire', 'black', 'friends', 'ever', 'Lewin', 'dinner', 'table', 'However', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'ending', 'clear', 'curve', 'ball', 'surprise', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'picture', 'really', 'punch.Losing', 'Isaiah', 'one', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'films', 'choose', 'deal', 'ongoing', 'dilemma', 'society', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'resolved', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'have', 'scene', 'ask', 'Isaiah', 'what', 'HE', 'would', 'like', 'then', 'again', 'answer', 'question', 'somewhat', 'clearer', 'end', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'people', 'interested', 'social', 'issues', 'issues', 'regarding', 'adoption', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'DVD', 'as', 'well']",Losing Isaiah VHS

380159,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,6303574203,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[6, 8]","Losing Isaiah is Halle Berry's best movie. I wish she had gotten the Oscar for this film because She gives a breakthrough performance here as a black drug addict who abandons her baby and struggles to get him back from the white mother (Jessica Lange) who adopted him. Other Noteworthy performances here are Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr. The film is great, not playing race as an issue, but showing us people as human beings letting the events play and showing us the outcome. I highly recommend this film.",5,Halle's best performance.

Halle is well deserving of an Oscar in this film as well, she plays a crack addicted homeless woman who loses it all and dumps her baby in the trash just so she can get a hit...when she comes out of her drug stooper she then realizes her mistake, but it's too late.  The baby was adopted by a white family and she believes her baby to have died.  The movie takes off from there, the white family raises and cares for the child.  After Halle's character struggles but reforms herself she finds out that the child is still alive.  Then the battle for who is rightfully the parent of the child begins.  Some of the highlights here...Samuel L. Jackson's role as Halle's Lawyer and the scene in which the 2 &quot;mothers&quot; meet in the bathroom for the first time...that is a very powerful scene.
