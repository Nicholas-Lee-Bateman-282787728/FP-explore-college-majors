This is one of the most amazing productions in Broadway history, and it shocks me to know that intelligent, well-informed people a little younger than I know nothing about this event. I have viewed it so many times. One relishes the nuances each performer works into multiple characters-- almost everyone in the cast plays many roles. And of course, they are all distinct individuals. Villain in one portion, benign friend in the next, drunk in the next, child in a fourth, indifferent socialite in a fifth, suffering beggar in yet another.

705208,AYSWADHW28S1A,B000068QOG,Amazon Customer,"[13, 15]","In 1980, 48 members of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company got together to develop a stage version of Charles Dickens' ""Nicholas Nickleby"".  The result was an astounding 8 hours of absolutely riveting, often downright hilarious theater.Patrons were given the option of watching the show either over two nights, or in one day, starting at 1 in the afternoon, with a 2-hour intermission.  I was a teenager when I saw this show, and no fan of Charles Dickens, but not once did I find myself noticing the passage of time or looking anywhere but at the stage (and I saw it all in one day).You may think that by buying the DVD, you'll be able to split the show over 4 nights.  Maybe you'll even have the willpower to do it.  If I were you, though, I'd settle in for the long haul, because you won't want to get up.Even if for some incomprehensible reason you don't want to watch the entire show, there is one segment of the play which alone nearly justifies the price of the DVD. At the end of the first part (i.e., probably around the end of DVD 2), you get to see some of the world's finest Shakespearean actors perform their version of a sappy Victorian production of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a happy ending and a rousing ""Patriotic Chorus"" (a musical ode to England).  Interestingly, the song was also featured on an episode of ""West Wing"" last year.",5,One of the greatest West End shows of the early 1980s,1028592000,"08 6, 2002",2002,1355,"['1980', '48', 'members', 'Britain', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'got', 'together', 'develop', 'stage', 'version', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'result', 'was', 'astounding', '8', 'hours', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'often', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'theater.Patrons', 'were', 'given', 'option', 'watching', 'show', 'either', 'two', 'nights', 'one', 'day', 'starting', '1', 'afternoon', '2-hour', 'intermission', 'was', 'teenager', 'when', 'saw', 'show', 'fan', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'find', 'noticing', 'passage', 'time', 'looking', 'anywhere', 'stage', 'saw', 'one', 'day', '.You', 'may', 'think', 'buying', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'split', 'show', '4', 'nights', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'even', 'have', 'willpower', 'do', 'were', ""'d"", 'settle', 'long', 'haul', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'up.Even', 'incomprehensible', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'one', 'segment', 'play', 'alone', 'nearly', 'price', 'DVD', 'end', 'first', 'part', 'i.e.', 'probably', 'end', 'DVD', '2', 'get', 'see', 'world', 'finest', 'Shakespearean', 'actors', 'perform', 'version', 'sappy', 'Victorian', 'production', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'complete', 'happy', 'ending', 'rousing', 'Patriotic', 'Chorus', 'musical', 'ode', 'England', 'Interestingly', 'song', 'was', 'also', 'featured', 'episode', 'West', 'Wing', 'last', 'year']",N/A

Don't be put off by the fact that it's a play, with people moving sets around, curtain calls, especially if you were like me and expecting some polished movie version of Nicholas Nickleby. Imagine my surprise when the actors entered the stage, from their places out in a real theater with a live audience. Then the actors began speaking, one by one, giving little one-liner blips about the story. Boy was I getting worried that I had wasted my money, but that feeling didn't last long before I was deeply drawn into the story. These people are real professionals. They presented the story so that I will never forget it. I can't say that about most of the movie versions of novels, even those I enjoyed. I'll never forget this one!Here's what amazed me and pleased me the most. We, the viewers, watch as the sets are quickly changed and the actors go from being 'narrators' to the characters in the novel. It happens in an INSTANT! Amazing!  How do they make that transition instantly?! Well, it's because they are talented actors and this is why people appreciate them. I wasn't familiar with any of them until now because I don't follow such things, but I now number with those who appreciate them for their acting skills.The audience occasionally gets to participate during scenes which include the public streets, markets, etc. You can see how they are enjoying themselves, and that's fun, but surprisingly doesn't detract from the story. It just makes it more enjoyable.You see a narrator and recognize him as an actor with stage makeup.You see the same person a moment later in his role and he IS the character he is playing.Not what I had expected, and if I had thought this was what I was getting, I wouldn't have ordered it.

705210,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B000068QOG,Cowboy Buddha,"[30, 31]","Neither the 2000 television version nor the 2002 film could ever hope to match the magic, passion, dramatic heights and emotional involvement of this nine hour Royal Shakespeare Company production. All the characters and subplots of Dickens' novel are presented in a whirlwind of drama, comedy, tragedy and romance. It was a wise decision, when putting the production on film, to retain as much of its theatrical flavor as possible. Because it is that theatricality that produces as much of an impact and lasting impression as the characters and plot.Originally staged by the RSC in the early 80's at the Aldwych Theatre, this version was taped at the Old Vic before the company took the show to New York. At times, an audience is visible (and audible) especially when various characters leave the stage to wander or race through the aisles or along the front of the balcony. It must have been a wonderful experience. But the DVD compensates us for not actually being there by providing that which you cannot get in a theatre - close-ups of the actors. Only once is this overdone - when Ralph Nickleby is finally denounced, the camera lingers much too long on an extreme close-up as the other characters are only heard revealing the sins of his past. But other times, such as during the silences between lines or the looks between characters, the close-ups are quite wonderful.A cast of 30-some actors portray about 150 characters between them. Of course, doubling or even tripling is an ancient theatrical convention. But never have I seen it used as effectively as here. Only Roger Rees, as Nicholas, plays a single part. This is real acting we are witnessing.The nine hours are divided into four acts spread over three discs. Each act is divided into two or three parts, each with the same opening and closing credits. This makes it possible to watch in installments although one at a time never seems enough. My wife insisted that we watch the entire 167 minute final disc in one sitting. The time flies by.The story is typical Dickens, full of noble poor people and disreputable rich ones, with complex plotlines that would be the envy of any modern soap, complete with Dickens' famous penchant for incredible coincidences. But this is more than mere melodrama and everything about the production combines to make it all fresh and exciting and involving. These are characters you genuinely care about (or, in a few instances, love to hate). And there will not be a dry eye in the house during Smike's final scene.As I said, all the actors are brillian but most memorable are Roger Rees (who seemed born to play the part), David Threlfall as Smike (an astonishing performance), John Woodvine as the evil Ralph Nickleby (cool underplaying with bursts of temper), Alun Armstrong as Squeers, the villain from hell, Edward Petherbridge as Newman Noggs, Suzanne Bertish in several roles, a pre-Edge Of Darkness Bob Peck as two wildly different characters, and Emily Richard in the thankless role of goody-goody Kate Nickleby.One word to anyone who has never seen this production. Act One is decidedly grim and occasionally brutal. When this was first shown on television, I knew several people who never got beyond that part. But don't give up. Once Nicholas rebels against Squeers and leaves the school, everything lightens up considerably. And no one should miss the marvellous finale to Act Two when Nicholas and Smike and a travelling theatre company perform the final scene from Romeo And Juliet, complete with exaggerated Victorian acting and a happy ending (""I wasn't dead - I was stunned"")!I'm absolutely delighted that Nicholas NIckleby has become available on DVD.

It is the best theatre I've ever seen or will ever see again. The sheer facts are astounding: nine hours long, 39 actors playing 150 parts. Only Roger Rees has one part as Nicholas Nickleby, and it's easy to see he could have hardly taken more, being so much on stage. He is a bit old for Nicholas, but creates a very convincing, somewhat naive but - when needed - passionate young man. And his part is heavy for the mere fact that he has to carry Smike and fall down on the floor with Fanny Squeers around his neck - twice, because they do it again on one of the 'what has happened so far' -scenes in the beginning of acts. Edward Petherbridge has only two parts, but makes such a wonderful work as Newman Noggs, that he is one of the most memorable actors. His droopy, worried face is absolutely priceless!There is a lot to listen in this version, it starts with the whole cast telling, what happened before Nicholas, Kate and their mother came to London to seek help from Uncle Ralph, in the beginning of other acts there are 'what has happened' -scenes (which are wonderful!) - and at times the actors comment or fill in the facts - and then again become clouds, walls, poor people watching in from behind the windows or rich people eating well inside the same windows. This is smooth working, flawless, yet clearly something that they love to do and have fun doing it. Everybody's been telling, how much they love John Woodvine as uncle Ralph, but I still want to praise him - and wonder about how effortlessly he becomes an opera singer and a few moments later appears again as Uncle Ralph. David Threlfall is a heart-breaking Smike, twisted from head to toe, o-u-t-cast whose only home is Nicholas. And Alun Armstrong deserves his place in the closing credits for more than alphabetical reasons, his Squeers is wonderful, horrible, hilarious as the whole Squeers family. He later appears as a drunken actor, who saves the day as king in 'Romeo and Juliet', the Crummles' production with happy endings for everyone. Men who play Cheeryble brothers looked so much alike that I had to check they weren't twins, but had completely different family names. And their fury was something to see: when they decide to take ultimate measures to lighten to work of their clerk, they threaten him with making him a partner.I would still like to mention other Squeers: Lila Kaye, Mrs. Squeers and later Mrs. Crummles, both wonderful performances which I still remembered well after all these years, and Suzanne Bertish, who has to be admired and envied for such delicious, different parts as Fanny Squeers, Miss Snevellici and Peg Sliderskew, the old hag who has a big part in the happy ending.And yes: the technical transfer to DVD could have been much better done. As wonderful as these actors are, we don't need to see their names so many times. But even if I had to skip and fast forward, this was still a delight. Dickens is one of my favourites and this is one of those very, very rare occasions, when one can say: the movie (or play) was as good as the original book.",5,"Only technical flaws, otherwise immortal",1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3151,"['saw', 'Nickleby', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'forget', 'best', 'theatre', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'sheer', 'facts', 'are', 'astounding', 'nine', 'hours', 'long', '39', 'actors', 'playing', '150', 'parts', 'Only', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'one', 'part', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'easy', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'hardly', 'taken', 'more', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'stage', 'bit', 'old', 'Nicholas', 'very', 'convincing', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'when', 'needed', 'passionate', 'young', 'man', 'part', 'heavy', 'mere', 'fact', 'carry', 'Smike', 'fall', 'down', 'floor', 'Fanny', 'Squeers', 'neck', 'twice', 'do', 'again', 'one', 'happened', 'so', 'far', '-scenes', 'beginning', 'acts', 'Edward', 'Petherbridge', 'only', 'two', 'parts', 'wonderful', 'work', 'Newman', 'Noggs', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'actors', 'droopy', 'worried', 'face', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'lot', 'listen', 'version', 'whole', 'cast', 'telling', 'what', 'happened', 'Nicholas', 'Kate', 'mother', 'came', 'London', 'seek', 'help', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'beginning', 'other', 'acts', 'are', 'happened', '-scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'times', 'actors', 'comment', 'fill', 'facts', 'then', 'again', 'become', 'clouds', 'walls', 'poor', 'people', 'watching', 'windows', 'rich', 'people', 'eating', 'well', 'same', 'windows', 'smooth', 'working', 'flawless', 'yet', 'clearly', 'something', 'love', 'do', 'have', 'fun', 'doing', 'Everybody', 'been', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'John', 'Woodvine', 'uncle', 'Ralph', 'still', 'want', 'praise', 'wonder', 'how', 'effortlessly', 'opera', 'singer', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'again', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'David', 'Threlfall', 'heart-breaking', 'Smike', 'twisted', 'head', 'toe', 'o-u-t-cast', 'only', 'home', 'Nicholas', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'place', 'closing', 'credits', 'more', 'alphabetical', 'reasons', 'Squeers', 'wonderful', 'horrible', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'Squeers', 'family', 'later', 'drunken', 'actor', 'who', 'day', 'king', ""'Romeo"", 'Juliet', 'Crummles', 'production', 'happy', 'endings', 'everyone', 'Men', 'who', 'play', 'Cheeryble', 'brothers', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'check', 'were', ""n't"", 'twins', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'family', 'names', 'fury', 'was', 'something', 'see', 'when', 'decide', 'take', 'ultimate', 'measures', 'lighten', 'work', 'clerk', 'threaten', 'making', 'partner.I', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'mention', 'other', 'Squeers', 'Lila', 'Kaye', 'Mrs.', 'Squeers', 'later', 'Mrs.', 'Crummles', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'still', 'remembered', 'well', 'years', 'Suzanne', 'Bertish', 'who', 'be', 'admired', 'envied', 'such', 'delicious', 'different', 'parts', 'Fanny', 'Squeers', 'Miss', 'Snevellici', 'Peg', 'Sliderskew', 'old', 'hag', 'who', 'big', 'part', 'happy', 'ending.And', 'yes', 'technical', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'As', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'names', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'even', 'had', 'skip', 'fast', 'forward', 'was', 'still', 'delight', 'Dickens', 'one', 'favourites', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'play', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'book']",N/A

G ORELL,"[0, 5]","I thought that I was going to have to wait until Christmas to view the very expensive DVD Set which I hear is somewhat shorter than the VHS Set (and that's a bad thing). Then I found this movie in the library along with other A&E Programs. Needless to say, A&E brings out some of the best TV movies even if they didn't make them. All of the actors were amazing. Roger Rees was simply amazing as Nicholas and very pleasant to look at compared to Smike. I was a little repulsed by his appearance at first. I wanted to watch this video particularly because Alun Armstrong was in it. I wanted to hear him in a none singing role. He was the original Thenardier in Les Miserables (produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company). When I first heard his last lines in the first video, I was moved. I thought of showing the show to my mom since my dad doesn't have any patience but sadly that wasn't to be. We only got past the first video when Mom told me that she couldn't understand what they were saying. Naturally, because it was filmed in 1981 and everyone was British. I was shocked by the fact that no one laughed at the funny parts. The Crummles provided a lot of laughter. I noticed a lot of things that reminded me of Les Miserables: The Musical. For one thing, both shows had a unit set, the same director, were both hits, had songs in them, and were both award winners. I had to give this video four stars because the sound was a bit too clear. You could hear the footsteps and you could hear the units being moved off Watch this play anyway. When you're done with it, buy the script at the Dramatist's Play Service Website. It's two volumes long. You might want to buy the television cast recording. If you have to, buy the video set as well.",4,Possibly one of the greatest plays ever written,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,1743,"['thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'wait', 'Christmas', 'view', 'very', 'expensive', 'DVD', 'Set', 'hear', 'somewhat', 'shorter', 'VHS', 'Set', 'bad', 'thing', 'Then', 'found', 'movie', 'library', 'other', 'A', 'E', 'Programs', 'Needless', 'say', 'A', 'E', 'out', 'best', 'TV', 'movies', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'actors', 'were', 'amazing', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Nicholas', 'very', 'pleasant', 'look', 'compared', 'Smike', 'was', 'little', 'repulsed', 'appearance', 'first', 'wanted', 'watch', 'video', 'particularly', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'was', 'wanted', 'hear', 'none', 'singing', 'role', 'was', 'original', 'Thenardier', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'produced', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'last', 'lines', 'first', 'video', 'was', 'moved', 'thought', 'showing', 'show', 'mom', 'dad', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'got', 'first', 'video', 'when', 'Mom', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'Naturally', 'was', 'filmed', '1981', 'everyone', 'was', 'British', 'was', 'shocked', 'fact', 'one', 'laughed', 'funny', 'parts', 'Crummles', 'provided', 'lot', 'laughter', 'noticed', 'lot', 'things', 'reminded', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'Musical', 'one', 'thing', 'shows', 'had', 'unit', 'set', 'same', 'director', 'were', 'hits', 'had', 'songs', 'were', 'award', 'winners', 'had', 'give', 'video', 'four', 'stars', 'sound', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'clear', 'could', 'hear', 'footsteps', 'could', 'hear', 'units', 'being', 'moved', 'off', 'Watch', 'play', 'anyway', 'When', ""'re"", 'done', 'buy', 'script', 'Dramatist', 'Play', 'Service', 'Website', 'two', 'volumes', 'long', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'television', 'cast', 'recording', 'have', 'buy', 'video', 'set', 'as', 'well']",N/A

705221,AMVLSBP59YGNG,B000068QOG,"Robert Baksa ""composer""","[4, 7]",I took a chance on this set in spite of the many reviews which did not like the production values of the product from a technical point of view.  I expected the worst but was willing to put up with it to recapture my fond memory of having seen the production on TV.  What I found was quite a surprise.  The picture on my 32 inch LCD is brilliant and clear.  I see no distortion and have no trouble with the sound quality.  The acting company is attractive with many superlative actors taking different parts in the large cast of characters.  My choice of only three stars is based on several considerations.There are no subtitles which are often needed when the uneducated characters are speaking in unintelligible dialects.  Since actors often play several parts the are often called upon to play minor roles of personages whose sex they do not inhabit.  This would be fine in a stage production but a bit unsettling in the closeups.  Too often the ruffian boys will turn up as maids in a following scene and vice versa.  It is distracting and only adds to the confusion of an already confusing story line.I will return to the BBC production with Nigel Havers as my video of choice for this story even though that series has more than it's share of uninspired bits.,3,Mixed bag of reviews,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1266,"['took', 'chance', 'set', 'spite', 'many', 'reviews', 'did', 'not', 'production', 'values', 'product', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'expected', 'worst', 'was', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'recapture', 'fond', 'memory', 'having', 'seen', 'production', 'TV', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'picture', '32', 'inch', 'LCD', 'brilliant', 'clear', 'see', 'distortion', 'have', 'trouble', 'sound', 'quality', 'acting', 'company', 'attractive', 'many', 'superlative', 'actors', 'taking', 'different', 'parts', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'choice', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'based', 'several', 'are', 'subtitles', 'are', 'often', 'needed', 'when', 'uneducated', 'characters', 'are', 'speaking', 'unintelligible', 'dialects', 'actors', 'often', 'play', 'several', 'parts', 'are', 'often', 'called', 'upon', 'play', 'minor', 'roles', 'personages', 'sex', 'do', 'not', 'inhabit', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'stage', 'production', 'bit', 'unsettling', 'closeups', 'Too', 'often', 'ruffian', 'boys', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'maids', 'following', 'scene', 'vice', 'versa', 'distracting', 'only', 'confusion', 'already', 'confusing', 'story', 'line.I', 'will', 'return', 'BBC', 'production', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'video', 'choice', 'story', 'even', 'series', 'more', 'share', 'uninspired', 'bits']",N/A
