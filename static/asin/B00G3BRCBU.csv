1676411,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00G3BRCBU,Don McGregor,"[5, 5]","In comparing the two Warner westerns that alternated with each other, Sugarfoot and Cheyenne, I don't believe I had ever realized before how much the producers adhered to the contrasts between the two characters.The two heroes are not clones.Cheyenne will solve a problem when he has no choice, with a gun. Sugarfoot is steadfastly against using guns to settle situations. I was surprised at how much he refuses to wear guns throughout the first two years of the series.By the way, the aforementioned Sugarfoot &#8211; Volume 2 that has Will Hutchins's autograph also has the first three appearances of Sugarfoot's bad-guy cousin, the Canary Kid. Montgomery Pittman wrote and/or also directed those episodes. Pittman also has Chris Colt make guest star appearances from his own Colt .45 series in those episodes of Sugarfoot.  Characters crossing over from one series to another were rare in those days.Somehow, Montgomery Pittman always seemed to be able to do a little more than many  the other talent behind the camera, as writer and director.The prints are complete except for the BUMPERS and TRAILERS.  Warner Archives knows I'm not about to forget that fact.  But the shows are otherwise complete, the prints as good as I've ever seen, if not better.You can read more about Cheyenne and Sugarfoot up on my Riding Shotgun column at [...]",5,SUGARFOOT AND CHEYENNE ARE NOT CLONES OF EACH OTHER AND MONTGOMERY PITTMAN,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1342,"['comparing', 'two', 'Warner', 'westerns', 'alternated', 'other', 'Sugarfoot', 'Cheyenne', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'ever', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'producers', 'adhered', 'contrasts', 'two', 'characters.The', 'two', 'heroes', 'are', 'not', 'clones.Cheyenne', 'will', 'solve', 'problem', 'when', 'choice', 'gun', 'Sugarfoot', 'steadfastly', 'using', 'guns', 'settle', 'situations', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'wear', 'guns', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'series.By', 'way', 'aforementioned', 'Sugarfoot', '8211', 'Volume', '2', 'Will', 'Hutchins', 'autograph', 'also', 'first', 'three', 'appearances', 'Sugarfoot', 'bad-guy', 'cousin', 'Canary', 'Kid', 'Montgomery', 'Pittman', 'wrote', 'and/or', 'also', 'directed', 'episodes', 'Pittman', 'also', 'Chris', 'Colt', 'make', 'guest', 'star', 'appearances', 'own', 'Colt', '.45', 'series', 'episodes', 'Sugarfoot', 'Characters', 'crossing', 'one', 'series', 'were', 'rare', 'days.Somehow', 'Montgomery', 'Pittman', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'talent', 'camera', 'writer', 'director.The', 'prints', 'are', 'complete', 'BUMPERS', 'TRAILERS', 'Warner', 'Archives', ""'m"", 'not', 'forget', 'fact', 'shows', 'are', 'otherwise', 'complete', 'prints', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'better.You', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'Cheyenne', 'Sugarfoot', 'up', 'Riding', 'Shotgun', 'column', '[', ']']",Sugarfoot: The Complete Second Season
