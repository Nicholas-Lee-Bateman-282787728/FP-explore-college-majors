But I have only one thing to say about it, neither bad or good... Elvis's charater is a quieter, serious roll and he doesn't have as many speaking lines in it, but it does go along with the roll he played. I had never seen it before and didn't even know he had made it... I liked it very much. Seems so out of character for him because he has this brizzly beard on his face, not the ""clean, cut, kid from all his singing movies. I found it refreshing, interesting, the plot, a true epic western. His beautiful face, eyes, mannerisms in this movie is a melt down for any woman..LOL  I really liked the movie, because like Flaming Star, it was a very serious role for him and that is what he wanted. ELVIS PRESLEY, COULD ""ACT"". I would say this was the last of his movies made. I am so glad I found and bought it. Thank you, to all who make this possible, by turning out quality DVD's that will last our lifetime. For HE WAS THE KING, LIKED, LOVED, RESPECTED and a human being. Sad, Lonley, Unhappy. He never forgot what it was like to be poor and have nothing. He shared his wealth with the have nots. Brought Joy to so many millions of people world wide. NO ONE has remained as Popluar, loved as long as he has, except for one! John Wayne.Enjoy watching Elvis as you have never seen him before. Remember this move was made for family watching (I'm sure that was the Col.'s doing.). Enjoy the movie. And remember he was a man of many talents. Elvis.

343539,A2O39VY1UEDCKH,6302878721,Charles Jannuzi,"[1, 1]","I'd more likely give it a 3.5 star rating if the system here allowed it.It's said that Elvis was disappointed when he got to the movie set because he realized that they had eviscerated the script that he had signed on for. Certain people who had control over the film really watered it down to make it more of an Elvis family film. It seems to have something of a 'Rio Bravo' or 'Rio Lobo' element to its plot (town under siege).It's quite a hard film to describe because it's a cheap Hollywood film (made in Arizona, where a lot of westerns have been made) made to look like a spaghetti western (which were cheap films made in Italy, Spain and Mexico, made to look like Hollywood westerns--although John Wayne himself helped pioneer independent production in Mexico to save costs).It's an imitation (Charro) of an imitation (popular violent goofy spaghetti westerns) of an imitation (with ultimately the real historic west as the object of imitative intention). But in effect it's more authentic as a Hollywood western than one shot in Italy or Spain for crying out loud.If you take away the 'it's an Elvis film' element, the plot is no more ludicrous than any number of 60s westerns (which often had more high explosives than war movies). And it is actually set (and looks like) close to where the story is supposed to be taking place.So overall it isn't a bad western in terms of entertainment value. Frank Sinatra made worse westerns than this.

Now let it be said that I am not a big fan of the king but if u read my other reviews I love westerns, that said here we have a very good western. So good in fact I have been disappointed he didn't make another.  He plays Jess Wade who is falsely accused of stealing a Golden cannon and goes in search of the band really responsible. You will notice that  Victor French known to most of us as Mr. Edwards from Little House on the Prairie plays a very good villain in this tale of betrayal and love. Of course there a love interest Tracie Winters played by Ina Balin.The VideoHere where they fixed it, the first DVD release of this movie was horrid. It jumped it faded in and out it was orange and tainted. This release fixed it, It has a touch of grain but lets be honest this wasn't a movie they expected to be a hit let alone be around 39 years later so they didn't try and preserve it. Al in all its very watch able as I am doing so on a 42 inch Hitachi plasma TV playing thru the HDMI on a Sony 400 disc DVD changer, It doesn't jump at all it is remastered.The AudioHere it is mono 1.0 but it was shot n 1969 so they weren't thinking 7.1 digital surround sound...lol. I have it running thru a 1000 watt Sony surround sound system. There is no hiss no distortion the music is loud crisp and clear the voices are steady and clear awesome for mono.The ExtrasThe Theatrical TrailerHere is where a lot of these DVD lose out not that I really want to see the trailer but if your going to give it too us at least remaster it so its clear.

343547,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302878721,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","When I was growing up I avoided CHARRO! like it had cooties, but that was because, back then, I thought it starred that hokey, flamboyant Spanish performer, and I really wanted no part of her Cuchi-Cuchi. But someone finally did tell me what was up, and I finally did check it out. Anyway...It's weird that CHARRO! happens to be one of my favorite Elvis Presley movies, and I do wonder how much of my liking it has to do with Elvis's straying from formula. His films generically equated to fun but shallow musicals in which our boy trotted out that clean cut image. He's done westerns before and even pretty decent ones (LOVE ME TENDER, FLAMING STAR), but those aren't as redolent with sweat and grit as CHARRO!Ex-outlaw Jess Wade's try at going straight is curtailed when his old gang finally catches up with him, and head bandit Vince Hackett (Victor French) has come up with a truly messed-up punishment. Hackett shows Wade the treasured national artifact he'd shanghaied from the Mexican government, this in the shape of a gleaming gold-plated victory cannon. Hackett then tells Wade that wanted posters are circulating both sides of the border which implicate Wade as one of the thieving culprits. The posters indicate that one surefire way to identify Wade is thru that horrific wound on his neck. Except that Wade doesn't have that telltale wound. Not until now when Hackett brands his neck with a hot iron. Only then does he set Wade free, with a parting sneery caution that the Mexican federales are hot on his trail.The novelty extends to Elvis not performing any musical numbers, excepting the title track he sings off-screen over the opening credits. Then again, singing ditties really would have undermined the hard-bitten, resentful character he was playing (Picture him going ""What!? You don't believe I'm innocent? Here, let me sway you with this nifty rock & roll. Ah-huh-huh.""). I do wonder if I'd still appreciate this movie as much if Elvis weren't in it. When all's said and done, this is a fairly pedestrian spaghetti western, obviously trying to cash in from them iconic shoot-'em-ups so popularized by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. But the screenplay here is pretty much of the plain variety, the direction is meh. The score achieves a strident flourish for too many moments, even the undeserving moments, even when nothing so exciting is happening onscreen. Elvis taming that wild stallion? Sure, bring on the rousing soundtrack. But Elvis watering his horse and then casually riding away? No, ease up on the soundtrack, brother! The love interest, Ina Balin, looks ravishing (check her out right after her bath), except that she's under duress from a thankless role. One fun act, though, is Solomon Sturges's (son of director Preston Sturges) contribution as the twitchy, cackling younger Hackett brother. Sturges is over-the-top bananas, and he livens things up.Maybe I'm so taken with Elvis's atypical role here - he rarely ever got the dramatic role - that I really can't tell if his acting is good or bad. I just know that beard of his seems to shift density from scene to scene. Is Elvis stoic? Perhaps subliminating his character's inner rage? Or is it woeful acting? I couldn't tell you. I only know that I like it when he's onscreen. I only know that, to me, he comes off as a convincing gunfighter. I just haven't ever, ever seen him before in a grungy stubble.

343559,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6302878721,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","This middling Elvis western is the first of three films he made that were released in 1969 - the last three films he appeared in as an actor. The only previous film I've seen him in so far is HARUM SCARUM, and while both the film itself and his acting are a notch higher in this case, I can't say that so far I'm surprised that Elvis' film career isn't generally as fondly remembered as his music. It's said that his controlling manager, Col. Tom Parker, kept him from getting better roles, but while that may have something to do with things Elvis himself has to take some of the blame, and he does himself few favors in this dull, typical glossy well-scrubbed and preposterous oater.  He's not terrible - certainly not the glazed sleepwalker that he was in the earlier film I'd seen - but he does seem unsure of himself at times, and he strikes few sparks with his leading lady Ina Balin.Charles Marquis Warren is the director, producer and writer here, and he probably deserves as much of the blame as the star; it's also the second of his films that I've seen, and like Elvis this was at the end of his film career. His first film, 1951'sLittle Big Horn, is a great example of a good script and directorial flair and the right casting making up for a low budget; 18 years and over 2 dozen films and TV episodes (mostly westerns) later, he seems to have forgotten all of what he knew in that first film. Or maybe it's the whole Elvis vehicle thing that lets him down, I don't know. In any case, our story here concerns Jess Wade (Elvis), an outlaw trying to go straight, and the gangleader who won't forgive him running out, Vince Hackett (Victor French) essentially in a battle of wits and threats over a gold-plated ""victory cannon"", which Hackett has stolen from the Mexican government, intending to sell it to the highest bidder - and pin the thievery on Wade. Also along for the ride are Hackett's younger, wild and unstable brother Billy Roy (Solomon Sturges) and a group of bandits including most notably the excitable Gunner (James Sikking). Most of the action revolves around a town where Wade is friends with the sheriff (James Almanzar) who wants to help him - and in love with Tracy (Ina Balin), formerly Vince Hackett's girl.So we've got jealousy, we've got the vengeful older bandit and his reckless younger brother, the bad guy trying to go straight, and also plenty of sheeplike townsfolk who seemingly can be convinced in every other scene that Wade's a good guy - no, a bad guy - no, a good guy. Etc. Whatever the script demands. This actually isn't all that bad up until the last quarter or so when the cannon is aimed at the town, where Wade is now the deputized sheriff after young Billy Roy has shot and wounded his friend the regular lawman - as the town is blown to pieces, what semblance of intelligence the script had is thrown out the window too. Don't say you weren't warned.But all isn't lost, and the film does have some worthwhile bits. Victor French is pretty darn solid as the lead bad guy - he kept reminding me of Gene Hackman here, but I don't think Hackman would have done any better in the role. The rest of his gang are pretty good as well, and Ina Balin has an interesting exotic appeal though her role isn't terribly exciting. The best thing about the film though is Hugo Montenegro's rousing, over-the-top score which plays like some kind of combination between Morricone and a more conventional Hollywood score, like something from Dmitri Tiomkin maybe. A propulsive main title and variations alternate with some cool lower-key stuff like delicate parts dominated by the harp. Elvis sings the title song, which isn't bad, but that's it for his musical contribution. OK Cinemascope photography by Ellsworth Fredericks.All in all, weak but not terrible, and worth a watch for Elvis fans, or Hugo Montenegro fans.  As a western, it's pretty iffy - there are at least half a dozen better American examples just from '69, one of the last highwater marks for the genre in its birthplace.  The DVD transfer is fine, the 2.35: 1 image looks about right, though the color strikes me as being a little soft.

However, there are a few noteworthy aspects in this dull western. The neck-branding scene is perhaps the most sadistic moment in Elvis cinema - it's rare to see the King endure such excruciating pain.  In addition, his character doesn't break into song (a wise decision). An intriguing sequence finds Elvis walking across the Arizona desert with no rear projection or extras in sight. It's one of the few naturalistic moments in a Presley film.

343567,AU2VNN9S2I53T,6302878721,"Timothy Swan ""disc jockey""","[2, 2]","This western saga finds Jess Wade (Elvis Presley) as a reformed gunfighter who is stalked and captured by his former band of outlaws. Presley sings only one song (the title track, heard over the opening credits) in the last dramatic role of his career. The feature has the look and feel of the popular spaghetti westerns of the time. This 1969 western would be one of Elvis' finest acting performances on screen, as he gets the chance to actually play it straight without having to break into a song every minute or so. Previous VHS releases of this film, including one issued by Warner Home Video in 1990, were of very bad quality, showing very poor picture images and unnecessary edits through certain spots. This 2007 DVD version finally clears things up, once and for all. The film is presented in its entirety in the original widescreen letterbox format, allowing the viewer to see how good it really is. The image is the most pristine version of all. If you are a fan of westerns, then this one is for you. If you are a fan of Elvis, you will not be disappointed.
