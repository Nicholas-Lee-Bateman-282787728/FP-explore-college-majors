365539,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,6303241212,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[7, 8]","This is one of the great but previously-near-forgotten films, based on Graham Greene's short story ""The Basement Room."" It's the tale of a French ambassador's son left alone with the household staff at the embassy in London for a weekend while a spot of domestic intrigue slowly unfolds.What more could you want? Here you've got: one of the great performances in film history by a child actor (coaxed painstakingly by Reed from Bobby Henrey); another superb performance by Ralph Richardson; one of those stories that, like Seth Holt's 1965 film ""The Nanny,"" portrays the sometimes terrifying world of childhood; an incredibly inventive suspense narrative; and a late, third-act appearance by Denis O'Dea as the suave and frighteningly-competent Chief Inspector Crowe.This is a truly remarkable piece of film. I'll take this one over Reed's other excellent films any day of the week: ""Odd Man Out,"" ""Our Man in Havana,"" ""The Third Man,"" etc. So many of Reed's best films were Greene adaptations, and this one may actually exceed the impact of the source material. This film has all the power of a great Hitchock film.Note: this Criterion DVD includes a fascinating 23-minute documentary short, ""A Sense of Carol Reed,"" featuring interviews with director John Boorman and a handful of Reed's collaborators.",5,"""We've got to think of lies, and tell them all the time: and then they won't find out the truth.""",1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1304,"['one', 'great', 'previously-near-forgotten', 'films', 'based', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'short', 'story', 'Basement', 'Room', 'tale', 'French', 'ambassador', 'son', 'left', 'alone', 'household', 'staff', 'embassy', 'London', 'weekend', 'spot', 'domestic', 'intrigue', 'slowly', 'unfolds.What', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'Here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'film', 'history', 'child', 'actor', 'coaxed', 'painstakingly', 'Reed', 'Bobby', 'Henrey', 'superb', 'performance', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'one', 'stories', 'Seth', 'Holt', '1965', 'film', 'Nanny', 'sometimes', 'terrifying', 'world', 'childhood', 'incredibly', 'inventive', 'suspense', 'narrative', 'late', 'third-act', 'appearance', 'Denis', ""O'Dea"", 'suave', 'frighteningly-competent', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Crowe.This', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'film', ""'ll"", 'take', 'one', 'Reed', 'other', 'excellent', 'films', 'day', 'week', 'Odd', 'Man', 'Out', 'Man', 'Havana', 'Third', 'Man', 'etc', 'So', 'many', 'Reed', 'best', 'films', 'were', 'Greene', 'adaptations', 'one', 'may', 'actually', 'exceed', 'impact', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'power', 'great', 'Hitchock', 'film.Note', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'fascinating', '23-minute', 'documentary', 'short', 'Sense', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'handful', 'Reed', 'collaborators']",N/A

Although this is not one of Greene's first-rate story lines the black and white film techniques used by Reed (although to better effect in The Third Man) highlight his almost claustrophobic and tight film style and demonstrate as well why he was nominated for an Oscar for this work.As for the story line itself, well, the story is as old as Adam and Eve, maybe older. A guy (Ralph Richardson), a very married guy, working his dull little life away as an English butler (always suspense that job classification automatically of nefarious stuff right off the bat otherwise you will wind out following false leads, okay) in the French embassy in post-war (World War II to keep the wars straight) London has caught the attention of the ambassador's precocious (and bratty) young son who seems organically incapable of telling the truth when he is cornered. In order to keep him in thrall said butler has, well, made up a false persona about his previous life, a life of African adventure, intrigue, and mayhem. Harmless stuff really, until the hammer comes down.And that is where our butler's being married, being very married, to one of the great crones of the ages, something out a witches' Sabbath (and I am being kind) who works in the embassy as the nanny to that precocious young son comes in. See said crone winds up very mysteriously dead and the fingers begin to point at the butler. Oh, I forgot to tell you, said butler, said unhappy butler had been, ah, playing footsies (hell, having an adulterous affair) with one of the embassy typists, and wifey gotten wise, hysterically wise. Along the way the boy, the butler, anybody with any knowledge about anything, come around the police to confuse the issue. But all things work on in the end, even for chronic liars, at least in this film.

Greene's major concern in everything he wrote was the question of guilt: in other words, original sin. His concern is with right and wrong, and the machinations of the devil in man. Hitchcock is not concerned with right and wrong. He is interested in Freudian motivation, apart from wanting to give the audience a roller-coaster suspense ride. Greene is not interested in Freud in the slightest. He inserts a clinical scalpel into the convoluted morality of human behaviour, and then twists it. There is extreme tension, of course: how will the plot lines be resolved? In fact, the happy ending of this screenplay is a minor cop-out: but it would be unbearable to have Baines shoot himself. But the viewer is still left wondering what the long-term effect of these experiences will be on the totally confused and disillusioned young boy. Somehow, one feels, the cycle of muddle and deceit will be repeated in the future. This film is much, much more subtle and intellectually sophisticated than anything produced by Hitchcock. Which is why it could hardly have made a fraction of the money pulled in by Hitch.The reviewer who said this film was shot in a mansion in Chelsea, South London, could not be more wrong.

Set in a foreign embassy in London, Richardson is having an affair with the embassy secretary (Michele Morgan) and is almost convicted of murdering his battleaxe of a wife (Sonia Dresdel). Keeping secrets and telling little lies, which everyone bombards Henrey with, have a lot to do with the suspense of the movie. The ending, where Henrey almost unwittingly sticks his foot in his mouth to re-implicate Richardson after his innocence has been established is wonderful.

Without McGregor the whole movie would grind to a halt.Before his untimely death McGregor has his 'moment in the Sun' as he captivates us with his wriggling antics, eating cake, and snuggling down in his little cubby hole behind the loose brick.

The ambassador has gone to bring back his wife, who has been ill for several months. Phillipe (Bobby Henrey) idolizes Baines (Ralph Richardson), who talks to him, tells him stories, takes him for walks and pays attention to him. Baines' wife (Sonia Dresdel), however, is a shrew. She has little patience for Phillipe, she runs the housekeeping side of the embassy with an iron hand, and she is unshakeable in her commitment to the cold, loveless marriage she has with her husband. She doesn't know, quite yet, that Baines and Julie (Michele Morgan), a secretary in the embassy, have been meeting secretly each week for months, just for tea or a private walk. They love each other but seem to find no way to break free of his marriage. And then Mrs. Baines, after an hysterical argument when she discovers Julie, is found dead at the foot of the grand stairway in the embassy. Phillipe thinks Baines killed her and is determined to protect him. His lies make things much, much worse.This is a marvelous film, full of irony and subtlety. Phillipe is too young to grasp the meaning of much of what he sees and hears. He unexpectedly interrupts a meeting between Baines and Julie in a tea shop. She is telling Baines she will be leaving; that their relationship is hopeless. Baines is trying to find someway for her to stay, if even for just a day or two more. Suddenly there is Phillipe, happy to find Baines, climbing onto a seat next to them, having a pastry, observing what Baines and Julie are saying to each other so quietly and intensely, and believing when Baines says they are talking about a friend and that Julie is his niece. Something is happening, he knows, but he simply doesn't register how desperately they want to talk to each other without pretense.Phillipe tells fibs, especially to protect McGregor, his small pet snake, from Mrs. Baines' anger. When she accuses him of telling lies, Baines tries to protect Phillipe by saying that there are lies and there are lies...that some lies can simply be a kindness to protect others. Mrs. Baines finds ways to trap Phillipe into admitting he met Baines' ""niece."" When she dies, Baines tries to find ways to use lies...or at least not the full truth...to protect Julie. Phillipe lies to the police in an effort to protect Baines. The conclusion of the film is a masterpiece of amusing irony when we realize the truth might be more dangerous to Baines than Phillipe's lies.Carol Reed directed The Fallen Idol in 1948. The year before he gave us Odd Man Out. In 1949 came The Third Man. Then Outcast of the Islands in 1952. That's four incredible films, one right after the other. And don't forget Our Man in Havana in 1959. The Fallen Idol, The Third Man and Our Man in Havana were collaborations with Graham Greene. These movies are not just literate and often amusing, they're thoughtful and often uneasy. And all are stunning to look at.The Fallen Idol gives us two great performances, or rather one great performance and one performance great despite itself. Ralph Richardson as Baines is as understated as the character. We're witnessing a character full of emotion and longing, yet so carefully proper and repressed it hurts. Baines relationship with Phillipe is genuine, yet in many ways it's based on lies and made-up stories. This is one of Richardson's best performances. As Phillipe, Bobby Henrey does a masterful job, but that's because of the patience and skill of Carol Reed and the cleverness of the film editor. Henrey was a nonprofessional who got the part because Reed thought he looked exactly like the kind of young boy Phillipe would look like. As a person who worked on the film with Reed said later, Henrey couldn't act and ""had an attention span of a demented flea."" Reed took infinite pains to gain Henrey's friendship and confidence. He would walk the boy through the part, usually standing in for Richardson when Richardson would have been off camera feeding Henrey lines. He shot miles of film with Henrey, and then spliced the bits and pieces together into coherent reaction shots. You'll note that Henrey has almost no scenes that go for more than a word or sentence before there are cutaways. Even so, the result is a great film portrayal of a little boy, Phillipe, who can be irritating, impatient and willful, and yet touching in his determination protect his friend, Baines.The Criterion release of The Fallen Idol includes an excellent booklet with three essays on the film and a fine 2006 documentary, A Sense of Carol Reed, with interviews from other directors.

Phillippe, a lonely young lad played by 9 year old Bobby Henrey is the son of the French ambassador to England.  His household is run by the butler Baines played by Ralph Richardson and his acerbic, vitriolic wife played by Sonia Dresdel, who is despised by both the boy and her husband.Richardson has been carrying on an affair with consulate worker Julie played by Michele Morgan and wishes to be free of his wife.  The ambassador is called away to care for his convalescing wife leaving the house in the hands of the staff.During this time Richardson and Dresdel have a major row with the governess accidently falling down a long staircase and breaking her neck.  The boy Phillipe sees part of the fight and assumes that the butler killed her.  In a touching display young Phillipe lies to Scotland Yard investigators to protect his friend and ally Richardson.Reed creates an aura of suspense and tension as the investigators roam through the mansion searching for clues and trying to pin a murder on Richardson.  A scene involving a paper airplane made from an incriminating telegram is particularly Hitchcockian in its ability to ratchet up the intrigue.  He fashions this taut little drama as seen through the eyes of the young master of the consulate.",4,Middling British tale of suspense,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,1421,"['Carol', 'Reed', 'produced', 'directed', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'modestly', 'appealing', 'drama', 'centering', 'relationship', 'boy', 'faithful', 'beloved', 'butler', 'Phillippe', 'lonely', 'young', 'lad', 'played', '9', 'year', 'old', 'Bobby', 'Henrey', 'son', 'French', 'ambassador', 'England', 'household', 'run', 'butler', 'Baines', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'acerbic', 'vitriolic', 'wife', 'played', 'Sonia', 'Dresdel', 'who', 'despised', 'boy', 'husband.Richardson', 'been', 'carrying', 'affair', 'consulate', 'worker', 'Julie', 'played', 'Michele', 'Morgan', 'wishes', 'be', 'free', 'wife', 'ambassador', 'called', 'away', 'care', 'convalescing', 'wife', 'leaving', 'house', 'hands', 'staff.During', 'time', 'Richardson', 'Dresdel', 'have', 'major', 'row', 'governess', 'accidently', 'falling', 'down', 'long', 'staircase', 'breaking', 'neck', 'boy', 'Phillipe', 'part', 'fight', 'butler', 'killed', 'touching', 'display', 'young', 'Phillipe', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'investigators', 'protect', 'friend', 'ally', 'Richardson.Reed', 'aura', 'suspense', 'tension', 'investigators', 'roam', 'mansion', 'searching', 'clues', 'trying', 'pin', 'murder', 'Richardson', 'A', 'scene', 'involving', 'paper', 'airplane', 'made', 'incriminating', 'telegram', 'particularly', 'Hitchcockian', 'ability', 'ratchet', 'up', 'intrigue', 'taut', 'little', 'drama', 'seen', 'eyes', 'young', 'master', 'consulate']",N/A
365548,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303241212,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 15]","The Fallen Idol is the third film of British filmmaker Carol Reed's that I've seen. Prior to that I've watched the dreadful Oscar-winning musical Oliver!, the solid Charlton Heston biopic of Michelangelo, The Agony And The Ecstasy, and now this. Yes, I have also watched The Third Man, the 1949 film attributed to Reed, but have always hedged upon taking the Warren Commission-like stance that it was Reed's film alone, and not an Orson Welles film merely bearded by Reed. Well, after watching The Fallen Idol, the 1948 film that directly preceded The Third Man, I can tell you that I have no doubts that the bulk of The Third Man was a Welles project that used the functional journeyman studio director Reed as a studio front against the American blacklist.This is not because The Fallen Idol is such a bad film- it's merely mediocre, even if it is based upon a Graham Greene work (as is The Third Man)- The Basement Room, but that there are only a few techniques in the film which augur the grandiosity of their usage in the later film- which was so Wellesian, that to contemplate that Reed soared to greatness out of mediocrity, for the single film he collaborated upon with Welles, then resumed a mediocre career, when the more Occam's Razor answer is that it was Welles who guided the vision of The Third Man, is to simply not recognize verities of the way art is created and the way artists work and mature.As example, the two later Reed films I mention differ from The Third Man in that they are in color, in different genres, and made many years later, so that one could argue that Reed may have simply `lost his touch.' But, given that The Fallen Idol was made a year earlier, is in black and white, and based upon a work by the same writer, the comparisons between the two films is apt, although the difference in quality is stark. But, why would Reed agree to such a thing? Well, he wanted to break into the American market, where this film did not do as well as other films by Britons as Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean, he shared political sympathies with and an artistic admiration of Welles. Plus, he got locked into a career track that led to greater financial success and recognition even as the requia for his solid artistic talents diminished in need. If you were a man who recognized his limits, and had a chance to help an idol whose techniques you aped, in exchange for personal success, would you refuse? Or would you do so, and deny the obvious to your grave?Yet, especially in recent years, there seems to have been a critical movement afoot to try and argue that this mediocre film is somehow on par with The Third Man, and since it is so manifestly inferior, it begs a reasoning of the motives. The one which makes the most sense is that some critics want to argue that Reed was some visionary auteur, and that The Third Man was not such a great sore thumb in an otherwise workaday filmic resume. In short, the argument is clearly meant to bolster the claim that Reed was the force behind both films, rather than just the first one, and a beard for the second. Yet, The Third Man clearly is an oddity- due to its great quality, and unlike the bloated solidity of The Agony And The Ecstasy or the execrable dotty musical Oliver!, this earlier film is the key to unraveling The Third Man's real provenance, for without it, those who deny Orson Welles' hand in that film can obscure their arguments with time, technical developments, and technique, while The Fallen Idol acts as a smoking gun that reveals its creator's limits, its alibiers' motives, and its successor film's great ineffability. And, for that, there is no contrived misreading needed!",3,Good,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3675,"['Fallen', 'Idol', 'third', 'film', 'British', 'filmmaker', 'Carol', 'Reed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Prior', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'dreadful', 'Oscar-winning', 'musical', 'Oliver', 'solid', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'biopic', 'Michelangelo', 'Agony', 'Ecstasy', 'now', 'Yes', 'have', 'also', 'watched', 'Third', 'Man', '1949', 'film', 'attributed', 'Reed', 'have', 'always', 'hedged', 'taking', 'Warren', 'Commission-like', 'stance', 'was', 'Reed', 'film', 'alone', 'not', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'film', 'merely', 'bearded', 'Reed', 'Well', 'watching', 'Fallen', 'Idol', '1948', 'film', 'directly', 'preceded', 'Third', 'Man', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'doubts', 'bulk', 'Third', 'Man', 'was', 'Welles', 'project', 'used', 'functional', 'journeyman', 'studio', 'director', 'Reed', 'studio', 'front', 'American', 'blacklist.This', 'not', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'such', 'bad', 'film-', 'merely', 'mediocre', 'even', 'based', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'work', 'Third', 'Man', 'Basement', 'Room', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'techniques', 'film', 'grandiosity', 'usage', 'later', 'film-', 'was', 'so', 'Wellesian', 'contemplate', 'Reed', 'soared', 'greatness', 'mediocrity', 'single', 'film', 'collaborated', 'Welles', 'then', 'resumed', 'mediocre', 'career', 'when', 'more', 'Occam', 'Razor', 'answer', 'was', 'Welles', 'who', 'guided', 'vision', 'Third', 'Man', 'simply', 'not', 'recognize', 'verities', 'way', 'art', 'created', 'way', 'work', 'mature.As', 'example', 'two', 'later', 'Reed', 'films', 'mention', 'differ', 'Third', 'Man', 'are', 'color', 'different', 'genres', 'made', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Reed', 'may', 'have', 'simply', 'lost', 'touch', 'given', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'earlier', 'black', 'white', 'based', 'work', 'same', 'writer', 'comparisons', 'two', 'films', 'apt', 'difference', 'quality', 'stark', 'why', 'would', 'Reed', 'agree', 'thing', 'Well', 'wanted', 'break', 'American', 'market', 'where', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'Britons', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'David', 'Lean', 'shared', 'political', 'sympathies', 'artistic', 'admiration', 'Welles', 'got', 'locked', 'career', 'track', 'led', 'greater', 'financial', 'success', 'recognition', 'even', 'requia', 'solid', 'artistic', 'talents', 'diminished', 'need', 'were', 'man', 'who', 'recognized', 'limits', 'had', 'chance', 'help', 'idol', 'techniques', 'aped', 'exchange', 'personal', 'success', 'would', 'refuse', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'deny', 'obvious', 'grave', 'especially', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'movement', 'afoot', 'try', 'argue', 'mediocre', 'film', 'somehow', 'par', 'Third', 'Man', 'so', 'manifestly', 'inferior', 'reasoning', 'motives', 'one', 'most', 'sense', 'critics', 'want', 'argue', 'Reed', 'was', 'visionary', 'auteur', 'Third', 'Man', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'great', 'sore', 'thumb', 'otherwise', 'workaday', 'filmic', 'resume', 'short', 'argument', 'clearly', 'meant', 'bolster', 'claim', 'Reed', 'was', 'force', 'films', 'rather', 'just', 'first', 'one', 'beard', 'second', 'Third', 'Man', 'clearly', 'oddity-', 'due', 'great', 'quality', 'bloated', 'solidity', 'Agony', 'Ecstasy', 'execrable', 'dotty', 'musical', 'Oliver', 'earlier', 'film', 'key', 'unraveling', 'Third', 'Man', 'real', 'provenance', 'who', 'deny', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'hand', 'film', 'can', 'obscure', 'arguments', 'time', 'technical', 'developments', 'technique', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'smoking', 'gun', 'creator', 'limits', 'alibiers', 'motives', 'successor', 'film', 'great', 'ineffability', 'contrived', 'misreading', 'needed']",N/A

The film is certainly well mounted evoking a noirish feel to it.  Ralph Richardson is first rate as Baines, the embassy butler who spins tall tales to impress his young charge, Philipe(Bobby Henrey).  Henrey gives a natural performance as the boy who idol worships Baines.  The story is a good one.  The theme is essentially that we should be careful in telling impressionable children secrets or lies because it may come back to bite you.  The film is based on a short story by Graham Greene.  The problem I had is that the story may have been stretched a little thin.  Even at an economical 95 minutes I felt that the theme was beaten into the ground.  This probably could have made a better radio play or maybe as a one hour teleplay.  I know this was made in 1948 and television was in it's infancy but you get my point.

365551,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303241212,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","A year before his zither-ignited mystery masterwork, ""The Third Man"", producer/director Carol Reed made this supple, slow-building 1948 thriller replete with his trademark technical precision, and now the Criterion Collection has resuscitated the film with a fine print transfer on a new DVD. Written by novelist Graham Greene, Reed's frequent collaborator, the small-scale, London-set story is focused squarely on Phillipe, the undisciplined eight-year old son of the French ambassador to the U.K. With his parents often away, he has formed a strong attachment to Baines, the ambassador's manservant, but he remains fearful of the strict housekeeper, who happens to be Baines' shrewish wife.As it turns out, Baines is having a passionate affair with a comely embassy secretary named Julie, and Phillippe stumbles upon them during a tryst. This revelation leads to a series of deceptions that culminates into the death of a key character. It first looks like an accident but not in Phillipe's eyes, as he believes he saw Baines perpetrate the crime. Lies beget more lies until it becomes a labyrinth for the police to find the truth. Reed takes quite a while to set up the basic premise of the story, and it isn't until around the forty-minute mark of this 96-minute film that it really hits its stride. At the same time, he cleverly sets up the story's viewpoint through Phillipe's eyes by using low angles and long distances on several wide-angle shots to show how the boy eavesdrops on fragments of conversations to piece together what he thinks is the truth.Georges Perinal's atmospheric black-and-white photography helps set up the right mood, especially in the nighttime shots of Phillipe running through the blackened streets of London, and even with a child as the protagonist, Greene's screenplay has a bracingly adult tone throughout. Ralph Richardson shows perfect pitch as Baines, a man who maintains his butler-style composure even as he gets caught up in his own deceits. Even though his French accent makes him hard to understand at times, Bobby Henrey plays the boy unaffectedly, and it's interesting to see how Reed and Graham set up Phillipe's innocence as a plot driver yet risk losing viewer sympathy with the boy's frustrating behavior. Mich&egrave;le Morgan brings understated ardor to Julie, making her passion for the staid Baines palpable if not exactly believable.Sonia Dresdel effectively portrays Mrs. Baines with wrathful fury, while Denis O'Dea and Jack Hawkins make the inquisitive detectives far less than the stock characters they are. There are some beautifully executed scenes, such as the constantly moving hide-and-seek game and the paper airplane landing at the feet of one of the detectives. There is also an unexpectedly funny scene at the police station where a blowsy hooker (played by Dora Bryan) becomes a maternal figure to Phillippe but can only talk to him like a potential client. While the plot complexities in the last half-hour are deftly handled, the ending is something of a disappointment for all that precedes it.Although there is no commentary track from an appropriate film scholar as is standard practice for Criterion, the 2006 DVD has one solid extra - a 23-minute featurette, ""A Sense of Carol Reed"", which paints a portrait of the underappreciated filmmaker through remembrances from his colleagues. It shows him to be a rather obsessive personality who struck a strong partnership with producer Alexander Korda but lost his way creatively after Korda's death in 1956 until he died in 1976 (Reed did make the Oscar-winning ""Oliver!"" in 1968). Also included is a slide-driven listing of the Reed filmography through various posters and lobby cards, as well as the original press book for the movie.",4,"Deftly Handled, Character-Driven Thriller Starts Slow But Builds Momentum on a Web of Deceit",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3759,"['year', 'zither-ignited', 'mystery', 'masterwork', 'Third', 'Man', 'producer/director', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'made', 'supple', 'slow-building', '1948', 'thriller', 'replete', 'trademark', 'technical', 'precision', 'now', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'resuscitated', 'film', 'fine', 'print', 'transfer', 'new', 'DVD', 'Written', 'novelist', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Reed', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'small-scale', 'London-set', 'story', 'focused', 'squarely', 'Phillipe', 'undisciplined', 'eight-year', 'old', 'son', 'French', 'ambassador', 'U.K.', 'parents', 'often', 'away', 'formed', 'strong', 'attachment', 'Baines', 'ambassador', 'manservant', 'fearful', 'strict', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'be', 'Baines', 'shrewish', 'wife.As', 'out', 'Baines', 'having', 'passionate', 'affair', 'comely', 'embassy', 'secretary', 'named', 'Julie', 'Phillippe', 'stumbles', 'tryst', 'revelation', 'series', 'deceptions', 'death', 'key', 'character', 'first', 'accident', 'not', 'Phillipe', 'eyes', 'saw', 'Baines', 'perpetrate', 'crime', 'beget', 'more', 'lies', 'labyrinth', 'police', 'find', 'truth', 'Reed', 'quite', 'while', 'set', 'up', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', ""n't"", 'forty-minute', 'mark', '96-minute', 'film', 'really', 'stride', 'same', 'time', 'cleverly', 'up', 'story', 'viewpoint', 'Phillipe', 'eyes', 'using', 'low', 'angles', 'long', 'distances', 'several', 'wide-angle', 'shots', 'show', 'how', 'boy', 'fragments', 'conversations', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'truth.Georges', 'Perinal', 'atmospheric', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'set', 'up', 'right', 'mood', 'especially', 'nighttime', 'shots', 'Phillipe', 'running', 'blackened', 'streets', 'London', 'even', 'child', 'protagonist', 'Greene', 'screenplay', 'bracingly', 'adult', 'tone', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'Baines', 'man', 'who', 'butler-style', 'composure', 'even', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'deceits', 'Even', 'French', 'accent', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'Bobby', 'Henrey', 'boy', 'unaffectedly', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Reed', 'Graham', 'set', 'up', 'Phillipe', 'innocence', 'plot', 'driver', 'yet', 'risk', 'losing', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'boy', 'frustrating', 'behavior', 'Mich', 'egrave', 'Morgan', 'understated', 'ardor', 'Julie', 'making', 'passion', 'staid', 'Baines', 'palpable', 'not', 'exactly', 'Dresdel', 'effectively', 'Mrs.', 'Baines', 'wrathful', 'fury', 'Denis', ""O'Dea"", 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'make', 'inquisitive', 'detectives', 'far', 'less', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'are', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'scenes', 'such', 'constantly', 'moving', 'hide-and-seek', 'game', 'paper', 'airplane', 'landing', 'feet', 'one', 'detectives', 'also', 'unexpectedly', 'funny', 'scene', 'police', 'station', 'where', 'blowsy', 'hooker', 'played', 'Dora', 'Bryan', 'maternal', 'figure', 'Phillippe', 'can', 'only', 'talk', 'potential', 'client', 'plot', 'complexities', 'last', 'half-hour', 'are', 'deftly', 'handled', 'ending', 'something', 'disappointment', 'commentary', 'track', 'appropriate', 'film', 'scholar', 'standard', 'practice', 'Criterion', '2006', 'DVD', 'one', 'solid', 'extra', '23-minute', 'featurette', 'Sense', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'portrait', 'underappreciated', 'filmmaker', 'remembrances', 'colleagues', 'be', 'rather', 'obsessive', 'personality', 'who', 'struck', 'strong', 'partnership', 'producer', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'lost', 'way', 'creatively', 'Korda', 'death', '1956', 'died', '1976', 'Reed', 'did', 'make', 'Oscar-winning', 'Oliver', '1968', 'Also', 'included', 'slide-driven', 'listing', 'Reed', 'filmography', 'various', 'posters', 'lobby', 'cards', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'press', 'book', 'movie']",N/A

365553,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,6303241212,F. S. L'hoir,"[4, 4]","Carol Reed's ""Fallen Idol,"" which I first saw as a child, withstands the test of time. Even though I didn't understand the adult implications of the plot then, I have never forgotten the story (still associating it with the little wooden-seated movie house where my father took the family every week to see British films). I was not disappointed; I found it just as absorbing--and even more compelling--half-a-century later.The screenplay is, needless to say, excellent. Working closely with Carol Reed, Graham Greene rewrote his original short story, ""The Basement Room."" In ""Fallen Idol,"" which takes place at a foreign embassy in London, Greene is actually revisiting the topic of a child's-eye-view of spying, loneliness, betrayal by an idolized adult, and the overhearing of frightening things that are not properly understood (Compare ""Fallen Idol"" to his haunting three-page story, ""I Spy,"" about another small lonely boy who witnesses betrayal and is frightened of things that happen in the dark.). Greene was to collaborate successfully again with Reed on ""The Third Man,"" and--from the sublime to the ridiculous--on ""Our Man In Havana.""Expertly directed by Reed, the child Philippe--played by Bobby Henrey, a non-actor--is so natural and believable that one might say that he is ably assisted by Ralph Richardson and Michelle Morgan (with Jack Hawkins in the minor role of a detective who lends his chiming watch to the boy in order to distract him). The cinematography is also superb. The moody black and white renders the melodramatic story, which in color might seem overwrought, plausible. The music of William Alwyn, who also scored Reed's ""Odd Man Out,"" further contributes to the stark ambience of the film.One of the delights of British cinema of the era was the non-sequitur, as when the clock-maker interrupts the police interrogation of Baines, the Butler, in order to wind one of the gigantic embassy clocks.  Just when Reed has wound the plot to its tightest point, he introduces the clock-winder, who serves as a moment of understated comic relief (Part of Reed's genius was knowing when to use moments of humor to lighten the tension.) And yet, references to clocks and watches seem to serve a more subtle purpose in Reed and Greene's scenario, to emphasize both the slowness of time in the mind of the boy and the literal ""watching"" of something frightening that he shouldn't have seen.This film may not be for everyone (For instance, my son, who likes action flicks in wide-screen surround-sound color, would probably hate it.), but it is certainly recommended for the discerning viewer who likes a time-tested suspense film, which can be not only watched, but also taken at more than mere face-value.",5,Clock Watching,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2728,"['Carol', 'Reed', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'first', 'saw', 'child', 'test', 'time', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'adult', 'implications', 'plot', 'then', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'story', 'still', 'associating', 'little', 'wooden-seated', 'movie', 'house', 'where', 'father', 'took', 'family', 'week', 'see', 'British', 'films', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'found', 'just', 'absorbing', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'half-a-century', 'later.The', 'screenplay', 'needless', 'say', 'excellent', 'Working', 'closely', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'rewrote', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'Basement', 'Room', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'place', 'foreign', 'embassy', 'London', 'Greene', 'actually', 'revisiting', 'topic', ""child's-eye-view"", 'spying', 'loneliness', 'betrayal', 'idolized', 'adult', 'overhearing', 'frightening', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'properly', 'understood', 'Compare', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'haunting', 'three-page', 'story', 'Spy', 'small', 'lonely', 'boy', 'who', 'betrayal', 'frightened', 'things', 'happen', 'dark.', 'Greene', 'was', 'collaborate', 'successfully', 'again', 'Reed', 'Third', 'Man', 'sublime', 'ridiculous', 'Man', 'Havana', 'Expertly', 'directed', 'Reed', 'child', 'Philippe', 'played', 'Bobby', 'Henrey', 'non-actor', 'so', 'natural', 'believable', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'ably', 'assisted', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'minor', 'role', 'detective', 'who', 'chiming', 'watch', 'boy', 'order', 'distract', 'cinematography', 'also', 'superb', 'moody', 'black', 'white', 'renders', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'color', 'might', 'seem', 'overwrought', 'plausible', 'music', 'William', 'Alwyn', 'who', 'also', 'scored', 'Reed', 'Odd', 'Man', 'Out', 'further', 'stark', 'ambience', 'film.One', 'delights', 'British', 'cinema', 'era', 'was', 'non-sequitur', 'when', 'clock-maker', 'police', 'interrogation', 'Baines', 'Butler', 'order', 'wind', 'one', 'gigantic', 'embassy', 'clocks', 'Just', 'when', 'Reed', 'wound', 'plot', 'tightest', 'point', 'clock-winder', 'who', 'moment', 'understated', 'comic', 'relief', 'Part', 'Reed', 'genius', 'was', 'knowing', 'when', 'use', 'moments', 'humor', 'lighten', 'tension', 'yet', 'references', 'clocks', 'watches', 'seem', 'serve', 'more', 'subtle', 'purpose', 'Reed', 'Greene', 'scenario', 'emphasize', 'slowness', 'time', 'mind', 'boy', 'literal', 'watching', 'something', 'frightening', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen.This', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'instance', 'son', 'who', 'action', 'flicks', 'wide-screen', 'surround-sound', 'color', 'would', 'probably', 'hate', 'certainly', 'recommended', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'who', 'time-tested', 'suspense', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'watched', 'also', 'taken', 'more', 'mere', 'face-value']",N/A

Phile idolizes the butler at the embassy, the sweet but very ordinary Baines (Ralph Richardson), and when his hero becomes accused of murder in the death of his wife young Phile becomes wrapped up in the police investigation. The film does a superb job switching back and forth from a child's to an adult's register--we see things both from Phile's limited child's point of view (and understand his inability to put things together given his naievete), and we also see from an adult perspective how his attempts to help his idol only make things worse and worse.

While regarded as a masterpiece, my recollections largely involved an annoying child.  So with Criterion's release, I was eager to revisit this work with adult eyes.  I can't honestly say that I still didn't find that child somewhat annoying--because he was.  But his need for love and attention are critical to ""The Fallen Idol,"" for it is his actions and emotional state that propel the film.The story unfolds from the viewpoint of Phillipe, the child of a French ambassador.  Left largely to his own devices within the embassy, Phillipe has formed a close bond with Mr. Baines, the family butler.  He is enchanted by Mr. Baines' stories, as well as spoiled and indulged by the kind hearted man.  Baines' wife plays the role of the disciplinarian, so the pair often evade her more stern ways.  The film establishes all of the primary relationships effectively, and then moves into the more conventional plot as we discover Baines is having an affair with an embassy secretary.The striking thing about ""The Fallen Idol"" is that the narrative is shown completely through Phillipe's eyes.  We can see only as much as he is privy to.  So we get bits and pieces of the adult story interwoven with the more typical aspects of being a child.  Of course, what we glimpse makes more sense to us than to the 8-year-old.  We see a marriage on the brink of destruction, we see a torrid affair, we see the emotional confrontations, and we see tragedy strike.  And we understand what is happening--but we're not off the hook.  We are linked to Phillipe, who is well meaning yet confused.  As he tries to do what is right for Mr. Baines--he tells lies he shouldn't, keeps secrets he shouldn't, and then tries to tell the truth when it might be detrimental.  The suspense of ""The Fallen Idol"" comes completely from Phillipe's misguided attempts to help--as he continually makes things worse.The clever screenplay, based on a Graham Greene story, builds tension is this unorthodox way--it is more psychologically unnerving than a true ""thriller.""  The film benefits from a couple of great performances.  Ralph Richardson is perfect as Mr. Baines, a relatively good man trapped by circumstances.  And I particularly liked Sonia Dresdel, whose Mrs. Baines is frightening but in a believable way.Some comparisons have been made between the style of this film and early Hitchcock, and those are apt observations.  Particularly noteworthy is the use of a paper airplane as a damning piece of evidence (Hitch often used mundane objects to convey menace).  As it sails through the air, this innocent object provides one of the film's most tense moments.  Recommended highly, this is still a relevant and original work.  Very simple, yet very effective.

Superbly directed by Carol Reed, it is a wonderfully acted; photographed and scripted adaptation of Graham Greene's short story, ""The Basement Room"". It takes place over a weekend at the French embassy in London, while both the ambassador and his wife are away. Their eight years old son, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey), is a lonely little boy with no friends of his own age to play with, who dotes on his small grass snake, MacGregor (at one point, holding a mirror in front of it and telling it ""Look, you're very pretty, you know."") and idolises the embassy butler, Baines (Ralph Richardson) who entertains the impressionable boy with stories of his past heroics in Africa, putting down a rebellion single handed and so on. Unbeknown to the boy at this stage, Baines has never been to Africa. Baines wife (Sonia Dresdel) whom Phillipe hates and is afraid of because she is very cruel to him, is the housekeeper with whom Baines is locked into an unhappy and fruitless marriage. Mrs Baines discovers that her husband is having an illicit love affair with Julie (Michele Morgan), a secretary at the embassy. She confronts her husband about this and Phillipe witnesses a violent row between them at the top of the stairs that seems to end in Baines pushing his wife down the stairs and murdering her. Phillipe, terrified, barefoot and dressed only in his pajamas, runs out in panic into the rain-soaked streets of night time London and is eventually confronted by a uniformed policeman patrolling his beat...!Seen through the eyes of a child, but definitely not a kid's picture, the acting of all the cast is excellent. But, above all, we realise just how crucial eight years old Bobby Henrey was to Carol Reed's realisation of this film. Bobby had initially been chosen for the film both for his good looks after Reed had seen a photo of him peering out of the window of his London apartment on the dust jacket of one of his parents books and because he was bi-lingual, having been born in France and spending his childhood in both France and England and spoke English with a French accent, which was called for in the script. Bobby had never acted before, but this was just the kind of boy that Reed wanted. He didn't want a professional child actor who had picked up bad acting habits at stage school, he wanted a boy whom he could coax into giving a completely natural performance. He persevered with Bobby over a shooting schedule of an incredible eight months (a long time for those days), shooting numerous takes of the same scene and the same dialogue, which paid off handsomely, as he managed to coax out of the boy the most incredible and natural performance by a child actor ever seen on the screen and certainly not bettered since.No better example of this can be found than in the scene where Phillipe, having told one lie after another to protect his beloved Baines, but only making things worse for his idol, is convinced that Baines is going to be sent to the gallows for a murder he did not commit. At this point, with all the passion in his heart and soul, Phillipe pleads with the police to listen to him as he finally decides to tell the truth about what happened in the desperate hope that this will save his friend. ""Oh, please, you must listen to me! I have something to tell you! It will only take a moment and it will make everything right! Oh, you must listen to me! Please, please, listen to me!"" But to his utter despair, the police completely ignore him. This scene is so gut-wrenchingly heart-breaking, that it's almost too upsetting to watch and you become totally involved in it and feel very deeply for this increasingly desperate little boy. It is an incredible performance that is so perfect, it has to be seen to be believed. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is one of the finest films ever made in the history of the cinema.There are two DVD's of the film available. The Criterion Region 1 release and the Optimum Releasing Region 2 release. Both use the same 35mm print as their source, which is of a beautifully restored version of the film and both feature at the beginning the original British Board of Film Censors ""A"" certificate (showing that the film has been passed for exhibition to Adult Audiences)from 1948.

The story follows the life of the charming French Ambassador's son Phillip who has been left in the care of the butler and housekeeper, while his parents are away. During this time, Phillip's only source of entertainment is the British butler Bains, and his pet snake. Bains' wife, is a shrew and makes Bains' and Phile's life hellish with her nagging. (Really somewhat understandable since she is in charge of housekeeping, and keeping a place that big clean is really not an easy task in those days), however she is also unnecessarily cruel, (for instance, denying Phile a walk in the park with and trying to kill his pet snake).After an accident occurs at the embassy, Phile is the sole witness and the implications are grim. Was it murder? If so, who is the guilty party? Phile's testimony is not credible.This film was delicately built, with elements of action, suspense, and drama. I was hooked from start to finish, and found the little boy (Bobby Henrey) who played the part of Phile to be absolutely wonderful, and Ralph Richardson as Bains was also quite good.

365569,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6303241212,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""FALLEN IDOL,"" (1948).  This black and white, 95 minute British thriller is the second of the collaborations of Graham Greene, noted author/screenwriter, and director Sir Carol Reed, the other two beingThe Third Man [Blu-ray], andOur Man in Havana.  Here, Greene wrote the screen adaptation of his own story, THE BASEMENT ROOM.  The picture makes for interesting comparisons with the pair's THIRD MAN.In FALLEN IDOL, Philippe (Bobby Henrey), a diplomat's 7 or 8 year old son, worships the household butler at London's French embassy, Baines (Ralph Richardson,The White Countess), who's regaled the boy with tales of his life's adventures. So, when Baines becomes implicated in a possible murder -- his shrewish wife has fallen to her death --Philippe will stop at nothing to protect his idol. This despite his own suspicions about the servant's guilt.  Screenwriter's and director's reflections on moral ambiguity were well-received at the film's release in 1948, and earned Reed an Oscar nod for Best Director, and Greene one for best screen adaptation.  Other notables in the cast include the beautiful French Michele Morgan (Port of Shadows (The Criterion Collection)) as Julie, Baines' love interest, and Dandy Nichols.  Jack Hawkins and Bernard Lee do well as investigating cops.Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career.  I've read somewhere that 56% of Greene's works were made into notable films. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created vivid characters with internal lives on the most fraught of the world's stages; his characters faced struggles and doubt. Sometimes his characters despaired, or suffered world-weary cynicism - they were always self-aware. But Greene always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals.FALLEN IDOL is suspenseful, understated, and well-shot, giving us an accurate picture of London at the time.  It certainly can be compared to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, noted Anglo-American director of thrillers (Psycho (Collector's Edition),North By Northwest).  Acting's good, though it's hard to believe Richardson and Morgan as a couple.  The picture boasts some excellent suspenseful scenes, such as the Baineses' fight at the head of the embassy staircase, or the flight through the embassy of a paper airplane made of a critical document.  The theme of a young child, usually foreign, left alone in a big house to be looked after by servants, has been a popular one in British fiction, going back at least as far as Charlotte Bronte's  JANE EYRE; Henry James also used it in THE TURN OF THE SCREW.  This doesn't seem to be a story that screamed for a movie version, but it's worth a look, though hardly a must.",3,"Worth a Look, Though Hardly a Must",1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,2973,"['FALLEN', 'IDOL', '1948', 'black', 'white', '95', 'minute', 'British', 'thriller', 'second', 'collaborations', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'noted', 'author/screenwriter', 'director', 'Sir', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'other', 'two', 'beingThe', 'Third', 'Man', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'andOur', 'Man', 'Havana', 'Here', 'Greene', 'wrote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'own', 'story', 'THE', 'BASEMENT', 'ROOM', 'picture', 'interesting', 'comparisons', 'pair', 'THIRD', 'MAN.In', 'FALLEN', 'IDOL', 'Philippe', 'Bobby', 'Henrey', 'diplomat', '7', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'household', 'butler', 'London', 'French', 'embassy', 'Baines', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'White', 'Countess', 'who', 'regaled', 'boy', 'tales', 'life', 'adventures', 'So', 'when', 'Baines', 'becomes', 'implicated', 'possible', 'murder', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'fallen', 'death', 'Philippe', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'protect', 'idol', 'own', 'suspicions', 'servant', 'guilt', 'Screenwriter', 'director', 'reflections', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'were', 'well-received', 'film', 'release', '1948', 'earned', 'Reed', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Director', 'Greene', 'one', 'best', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Other', 'notables', 'cast', 'include', 'beautiful', 'French', 'Michele', 'Morgan', 'Port', 'Shadows', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Julie', 'Baines', 'love', 'interest', 'Dandy', 'Nichols', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Bernard', 'Lee', 'do', 'well', 'investigating', 'cops.Graham', 'Greene', '1904-1991', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'illustrious', 'British', 'writers', '20th', 'century', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'long', 'life', 'most', 'century', 'very', 'long', 'prolific', 'writing', 'career', ""'ve"", 'read', 'somewhere', '56', '%', 'Greene', 'works', 'were', 'made', 'notable', 'films', 'writer', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'better-known', 'Catholic', 'converts', 'time', 'many', 'thrillers', 'one', 'deal', 'Catholic', 'themes', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'created', 'vivid', 'characters', 'internal', 'lives', 'most', 'fraught', 'world', 'stages', 'characters', 'faced', 'struggles', 'doubt', 'Sometimes', 'characters', 'despaired', 'suffered', 'world-weary', 'cynicism', 'were', 'always', 'self-aware', 'Greene', 'always', 'created', 'tight', 'thriller', 'lean', 'realistic', 'style', 'boasted', 'almost', 'cinematic', 'visuals.FALLEN', 'IDOL', 'suspenseful', 'understated', 'well-shot', 'giving', 'accurate', 'picture', 'London', 'time', 'certainly', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'work', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'noted', 'Anglo-American', 'director', 'thrillers', 'Psycho', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Acting', 'good', 'hard', 'believe', 'Richardson', 'Morgan', 'couple', 'picture', 'excellent', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'such', 'Baineses', 'fight', 'head', 'embassy', 'staircase', 'flight', 'embassy', 'paper', 'airplane', 'made', 'critical', 'document', 'theme', 'young', 'child', 'usually', 'foreign', 'left', 'alone', 'big', 'house', 'be', 'looked', 'servants', 'been', 'popular', 'one', 'British', 'fiction', 'going', 'back', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'Henry', 'James', 'also', 'used', 'THE', 'TURN', 'THE', 'SCREW', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'story', 'screamed', 'movie', 'version', 'look', 'though', 'hardly', 'must']",N/A

365571,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6303241212,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For awhile, 'The Fallen Idol"" was part of the Criterion Collection but according to what I've read, the rights have now been acquired by Lionsgate. Be that as it may, any film that ends up as part of the Criterion Collection (even for a short while) is supposed to be considered a highly rated 'art' film, if not a 'masterpiece.' Certainly the film has things going for it including some wonderful noirish cinematography, Director Carol Reed's remarkable coaching job of a child actor, solid acting performances on the part of the adult actors and haunting on-location shots in 1948 London.Despite the classy 'look' of the film, the screenplay itself is weak and as a result, I relegate the whole affair to the pantheon of 'B' melodrama. The weakest aspect of the film is obvious: the character of Mrs. Baines, who is just such a vapid, unlikeable martinet who would have been probably diagnosed as bipolar if she were alive today. And is Mr. Baines much better a character than the evil Mrs.? What exactly do we find out about the wily butler besides the back story that he killed a black man while he was living in Africa before working at the Embassy? As it turns out, that's just a tall tale Baines has made up to impress Phillipe. Otherwise, Baines spends most of his time trying to convince Phillipe to keep his mouth shut so that no one finds out about his affair with Julie, an Embassy employee who works in the steno pool.I suppose it was very progressive of director Reed to hold up Baines and Julie as 'the good guys' despite the fact that they were having an affair (Reed himself was the product of an illegitimate union). But why should we hold them in such high esteem? Just because they're the victims of the unreasonable Mrs. Baines? I appreciate the fact that Baines wins points because he's kind to Phillipe but really that's all we know about him. And as far as Julie is concerned--to my mind, she's seems to be a complete empty vessel.In watching the documentary about director Reed as part of the DVD 'supplement', we learn that he was master in extracting wonderful performances from the child actors he worked with during his long career. The case of Bobby Henrey who played Phillipe was no exception. Henrey reportedly could never sit still and eventually Reed had to hire a magician to perform tricks for the boy in order to keep his attention. Reed expertly brings out the child's confusion as he misunderstands the reason for Mrs. Baines' death which leads to Baines being placed in jeopardy (the child believes that Baines 'murdered' his wife after confusing that event with Baines' tall tale which initially the butler appeared to communicate as a 'murder' but later clarifying it as 'self defense').The rest of ""Fallen Idol"" involves the rather stodgy police investigation into Mrs. Baines' death. Will the boy gum things up despite attempting to cover for the butler at every turn? Since he's just a kid, he's unable to cover up the discrepancies in Baines and Julies' story and after they're found out, Baines is on the verge of suicide. Fortunately an eagle eyed cop comes upon Mrs. Baines' footprint next to the window where she fell; this of course ends up exonerating the happy (or shall we say semi-happy) couple. I believe that the original ending from the book the film was based on, was Baines doing himself in, and some internet posters would prefer the more unpleasant denouement. I was actually pleased that the films' scenarists changed the ending to a happy one as the thought of having that child experience such an awful event as suicide would have ruined the picture for me.If there is a moral in this story, it's probably 'always be honest' because Baines and Julies' decision not to tell the truth almost led to their arrest and complete downfall. Despite the fact they prevail in the end, I would have much preferred that Phillipe had a direct hand in saving them. As it turned out, it was pure coincidence that saved Baines from the hangman's noose and not little Phillipe who will only be remembered for not being able to keep his big mouth shut.Like Hitchcock, The Fallen Idol is concerned with an innocent man being unjustly accused. Unlike Hitchcock, the characters of The Fallen Idol have little or no ambiguity. And when the protagonist is finally saved, it's not from his own exciting efforts or efforts on the part of a valuable ally (in this case, a nine year old boy) but from a slow-paced, pedestrian police investigation.
