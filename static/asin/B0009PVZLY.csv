910671,A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ,B0009PVZLY,"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover""","[4, 4]","About a year ago I read Oliver Twist for the first time.  I knew much of the story from various movies and adaptations, but only in reading the entire book did I understand just who all of these people are.While I still find it odd that we know almost nothing about the past of Fagin, Dodger, Charlie Bates, Nancy or Sikes (to name only a few), we learn a lot about Oliver, Monks and their past.  Even that is diminished in most movies.  Don't get me wrong - I love Oliver! and the 1948 version with Robert Newton as Sikes.But this 1985 version is A-one.  Ben Rodska(looking slightly like a young Prince Harry) is beautifully reserved and yet registers everything needed.  (Another boy plays the youngest Oliver.)  Each of the actors show the wonderful character training actors get in England.  They portray everything you could want.  The 6 hour length is a lot, true, but it didn't seem so much longer as richer.  The 12 installments can be watched in any size grouping you want - 1, 4 or even all 12 at once (if you have that much time.)  I loved it, and remembered every scene clearly from the book.",5,Faithful and spirited,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,1104,"['year', 'ago', 'read', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'first', 'time', 'knew', 'much', 'story', 'various', 'movies', 'adaptations', 'only', 'reading', 'entire', 'book', 'did', 'understand', 'just', 'who', 'people', 'are.While', 'still', 'find', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'past', 'Fagin', 'Dodger', 'Charlie', 'Bates', 'Nancy', 'Sikes', 'name', 'only', 'few', 'learn', 'lot', 'Oliver', 'Monks', 'past', 'Even', 'diminished', 'most', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Oliver', '1948', 'version', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'Sikes.But', '1985', 'version', 'A-one', 'Ben', 'Rodska', 'looking', 'slightly', 'young', 'Prince', 'Harry', 'beautifully', 'reserved', 'yet', 'registers', 'everything', 'needed', 'boy', 'youngest', 'Oliver', 'actors', 'show', 'wonderful', 'character', 'training', 'actors', 'get', 'England', 'portray', 'everything', 'could', 'want', '6', 'hour', 'length', 'lot', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'richer', '12', 'installments', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'size', 'grouping', 'want', '1', '4', 'even', '12', 'once', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'loved', 'remembered', 'scene', 'clearly', 'book']","Oliver Twist, BBC: 1985"
910672,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B0009PVZLY,Amateur Stargazer,"[1, 1]","This is a fine production of Oliver Twist, well worth getting even if you already own other versions. Like many of the other BBC series based on classic novels, the story is very faithful to the original book, and being longer, offers more of the plot and dialogue.  The scenes of the workhouse and other settings of the period are very realistic, and considering that this is not a large budget production, that is quite an achievement. There is much fine acting by those who played Bill Sykes (Michael Attwell, who was very frightening with his dog), Nancy, Fagin, and Oliver himself (played by Ben Rodska).  Mr. Bumble and his wife were quite humorous.  Mr. Brownlow, played veteran British actor Frank Middlemass, is the kind gentlemen who rescues Oliver by showing hospitality and taking him in. You get almost the same feeling as if you had read the original story. The continuity of the novel is so well preserved in the scripts. With smooth transitions made from each event to the next made so effectively one feels in watching this series that very little of Dickens' story was left out.  Oliver loses his identity when his mother dies in childbirth and regains both his identity and inheritance at the end. The adventures in between these events unfold with great congruity.Like several others in the Dickens collection, this is a whole miniseries of about six hours on a two-sided disc.  It isn't a big screen movie but a simple television miniseries which made some good drama using the limited resources that were available.",4,Very close to the book,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,1537,"['fine', 'production', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'well', 'getting', 'even', 'already', 'own', 'other', 'versions', 'many', 'other', 'BBC', 'series', 'based', 'classic', 'novels', 'story', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'being', 'longer', 'more', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'workhouse', 'other', 'settings', 'period', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'considering', 'not', 'large', 'budget', 'production', 'quite', 'achievement', 'much', 'fine', 'acting', 'who', 'played', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Michael', 'Attwell', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'frightening', 'dog', 'Nancy', 'Fagin', 'Oliver', 'played', 'Ben', 'Rodska', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'wife', 'were', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'played', 'veteran', 'British', 'actor', 'Frank', 'Middlemass', 'kind', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'rescues', 'Oliver', 'showing', 'hospitality', 'taking', 'get', 'almost', 'same', 'feeling', 'had', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'continuity', 'novel', 'so', 'well', 'preserved', 'scripts', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'made', 'event', 'next', 'made', 'so', 'effectively', 'one', 'feels', 'watching', 'series', 'very', 'little', 'Dickens', 'story', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'identity', 'when', 'mother', 'childbirth', 'identity', 'inheritance', 'end', 'adventures', 'events', 'unfold', 'great', 'congruity.Like', 'several', 'others', 'Dickens', 'collection', 'whole', 'miniseries', 'six', 'hours', 'two-sided', 'disc', ""n't"", 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'simple', 'television', 'miniseries', 'made', 'good', 'drama', 'using', 'limited', 'resources', 'were', 'available']","Oliver Twist, BBC: 1985"
910673,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0009PVZLY,Andrew Raker,"[10, 11]","I enjoyed this BBC version of Oliver Twist (1985) starring Eric Porter as Fagin. The film was very loyal to most aspects of Charles Dickens' novel * and contained relatively good acting. The biggest negatives of this film version is the AGE and QUALITY. If this film could have combined its script with Oliver Twist (2005)'s acting and sets, it would have been a great miniseries.However, the sets do not make this film seem real enough - it is easy to tell it is a television program rather than real life. Now naturally, Oliver Twist is not a true story. Yet, it is difficult to really feel sympathy for Oliver in this film or hate for Fagin and Bill Sikes. If a remake could be created with better acting and more elaborate sets (plus better picture quality) than it could be a 5-star film.* includes Mr. Bumble's marriage and future married life / includes Edward Leeford's role (including the locket) / includes Rose Maylie as portrayed in the novel (i.e. remember who she loves and who loves her) / includes Noah Claypole's trip to London and association with Fagin, etc.Supplementary notes:If you want a miniseries that contains better picture quality at the expense of some loyalty to the novel, purchase the 1999 miniseries from Masterpiece Theatre.If you want a film that best portrays the psychological at the expense of many minor characters and considerable change of plot, purchase the 2005 adaptation with Ben Kingley as Fagin.As for the 1997 Disney production and the 2007 BBC production, they are not worth mentioning, since each takes so many liberties from the novel and Charles Dickens' intent.",4,Most Loyal Adaptation as of 2009....,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1614,"['enjoyed', 'BBC', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Twist', '1985', 'starring', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Fagin', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'loyal', 'most', 'aspects', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', '*', 'contained', 'relatively', 'good', 'acting', 'biggest', 'negatives', 'film', 'version', 'AGE', 'QUALITY', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'combined', 'script', 'Oliver', 'Twist', '2005', 'acting', 'sets', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'miniseries.However', 'sets', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'real', 'enough', 'easy', 'tell', 'television', 'program', 'rather', 'real', 'life', 'Now', 'naturally', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'difficult', 'really', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Oliver', 'film', 'hate', 'Fagin', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'remake', 'could', 'be', 'created', 'better', 'acting', 'more', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'could', 'be', '5-star', 'film', '*', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'marriage', 'future', 'married', 'life', '/', 'Edward', 'Leeford', 'role', 'including', 'locket', '/', 'Rose', 'Maylie', 'portrayed', 'novel', 'i.e', 'remember', 'who', 'who', '/', 'Noah', 'Claypole', 'trip', 'London', 'association', 'Fagin', 'etc.Supplementary', 'notes', 'want', 'miniseries', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'expense', 'loyalty', 'novel', 'purchase', '1999', 'miniseries', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre.If', 'want', 'film', 'best', 'psychological', 'expense', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'considerable', 'change', 'plot', 'purchase', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Ben', 'Kingley', 'Fagin.As', '1997', 'Disney', 'production', '2007', 'BBC', 'production', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'so', 'many', 'liberties', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'intent']","Oliver Twist, BBC: 1985"

That didn't make sense at all. Also, Monks is introduced much earlier than he is in the novel. One liberty greatly irritated me: Nancy & Rose were barely affectionate with Oliver. As this miniseries was dramatised by Alexander Baron, who dramatised the excellent ""Jane Eyre"" for the BBC a few years earlier, I expected this production to be better than it actually was.

910677,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0009PVZLY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","Twelve episodes again for this super-classic story, twelve stations on this way of the cross. That gives the director the time he needs to get down to details since he has three times more time than a normal film director. To see the twelve episodes in one go is also a great privilege because each episode is fresh in your memory when you move to the next. This dramatic suspense is essential in this story if you want to enjoy the social Deus Ex Machina used by Charles Dickens to make a bleak and sinister story into a fairy tale.The story is, at the time of Charles Dickens, about the monstrous social system and its social over-exploitation of orphans and the poor. It is the practice of municipal workhouses in which the poor and orphans are enslaved into doing simple tasks that are profitable for the businessmen for whom they are performed. Dying in that environment is a liberation.On the other hand, if you manage to evade that over-exploitation, you can find your freedom in the enterprising life of thieves organized in bands that are real businesses. The end will unavoidably be death by hanging, or if you are lucky forced labor in some distant colony, but you will have enjoyed your freedom during your short career as a thief.Dickens though always has another objective. After describing the worst social conditions possible in Victorian England, he manages to salvage his main characters, here two orphans, with some kind of artificial confession, birth certificates, medallions, etc., that provides these orphans with a pedigree that has no reason to blush or shrink away in front of the decent society of Queen Victoria who requires you to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth.This particular adaptation by the BBC does not frustrate your expectations that were great at the beginning. The villains are real villains. The do-gooders are real selfless souls, the values of society are enhanced and advocated as best. The chief-thief is de-semitized and reduced to what he is a thief leading children into crime. And the children are marvelously well directed. Oliver Twist is a darling that manages some rather cold and distant attitude in situations that would have made many more cry like wimps.Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Victorian bleakness saved by magic,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,2239,"['Twelve', 'again', 'super-classic', 'story', 'twelve', 'stations', 'way', 'cross', 'director', 'time', 'get', 'down', 'details', 'three', 'times', 'more', 'time', 'normal', 'film', 'director', 'see', 'twelve', 'one', 'go', 'also', 'great', 'privilege', 'episode', 'fresh', 'memory', 'when', 'move', 'next', 'dramatic', 'suspense', 'essential', 'story', 'want', 'enjoy', 'social', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'used', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'make', 'bleak', 'sinister', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale.The', 'story', 'time', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'monstrous', 'social', 'system', 'social', 'over-exploitation', 'orphans', 'poor', 'practice', 'municipal', 'workhouses', 'poor', 'orphans', 'are', 'enslaved', 'doing', 'simple', 'tasks', 'are', 'profitable', 'businessmen', 'whom', 'are', 'performed', 'Dying', 'environment', 'liberation.On', 'other', 'hand', 'manage', 'evade', 'over-exploitation', 'can', 'find', 'freedom', 'enterprising', 'life', 'thieves', 'organized', 'bands', 'are', 'real', 'businesses', 'end', 'will', 'unavoidably', 'be', 'death', 'hanging', 'are', 'lucky', 'forced', 'labor', 'distant', 'colony', 'will', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'freedom', 'short', 'career', 'thief.Dickens', 'always', 'objective', 'describing', 'worst', 'social', 'conditions', 'possible', 'Victorian', 'England', 'salvage', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'two', 'orphans', 'kind', 'artificial', 'confession', 'birth', 'certificates', 'medallions', 'etc.', 'orphans', 'pedigree', 'reason', 'blush', 'shrink', 'away', 'front', 'decent', 'society', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'who', 'be', 'born', 'silver', 'spoon', 'mouth.This', 'particular', 'adaptation', 'BBC', 'not', 'frustrate', 'expectations', 'were', 'great', 'beginning', 'villains', 'are', 'real', 'villains', 'do-gooders', 'are', 'real', 'selfless', 'souls', 'values', 'society', 'are', 'enhanced', 'advocated', 'best', 'chief-thief', 'de-semitized', 'reduced', 'what', 'thief', 'leading', 'children', 'crime', 'children', 'are', 'marvelously', 'well', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'darling', 'rather', 'cold', 'distant', 'attitude', 'situations', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'many', 'more', 'cry', 'wimps.Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']","Oliver Twist, BBC: 1985"
