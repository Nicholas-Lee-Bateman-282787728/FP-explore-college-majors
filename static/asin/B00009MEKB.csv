754754,A2Y7O4ZH4H37ZU,B00009MEKB,Alan Breck,"[7, 7]","This new British adaptation of Eleanor H. Porter's children's classic is very good indeed.  This is the second time British television has relocated the story to an English village, and the change neither harms nor helps.  What does help, however, is the wonderful, energetic, and not-too-sweet performance of Georgina Terry in the title role.  Amanda Burton gives us a truly believable Aunt Polly, and the rest of the cast, including an appropriately stern Kenneth Cranham, are beyond reproach.  My only complaint is that the film feels slightly rushed.  Although ample time is spent on Pollyanna's relationship with two of the town grumps, it would have helped to see her ""gladness"" affecting more of the village.  In this adaptation the viewer is as shocked as Aunt Polly when half the town arrives to pay tribute at her sickbed.  But this is an affecting and charming adaptation of an old-fashioned children's story- the kind they don't write anymore.

That's how this version begins, introducing us to an imperious Aunt Polly (who has all the charm of a prison matron); a joyless soul.  Unfortunately, she set the tone for most of this film.  I wasn't impressed.  All right, maybe if I wasn't so partial to the Disney version I might have begrudgingly liked this one more than I did.  But, I did see the Disney version first (and many times), so this one really didn't stand a chance in comparison.  Still, even on its own, as likable as it was at times, it still lacked a certain cohesiveness.  Episode after episode lazily played out, slowly making way for the next scene.  It was all matter of fact, oh by the way....  There was no impact; characters never stayed around long enough to settle into hearts and minds.  I immediately disliked Amanda Burton (as Aunt Polly) and couldn't stop even after her transformation, which didn't seem all that heartfelt.

754771,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00009MEKB,Only-A-Child,"[25, 27]","This 2003 Masterpiece Theatre version of ""Pollyanna"" is the ultimate feel-good movie and because it is a bit less sappy than the 1960 Disney version you can enjoy repeated viewings anytime you need some cheering up. The new version is also more faithful to Eleanor Porter's original 1913 story and more focused on characterization than on elaborate set design and visual dynamics (there is no town fair and the comic relief has a more mature quality). And the setting is moved to Edwardian England with liberal use of wide angle lenses to capture the lush countryside.The real improvement, however, is in the casting of the title character. Georgina Terry, with her red hair and freckles, projects such effortless charm that even the most cynical should be won over. Hayley Mills' performance was more forced and she was really too old for the role. Terry's Pollyanna is much more convincing, both in her continuing attachment to her father and in her struggles to play his glad game in the face of so much adversity. ""I suppose it's as easy to be happy about things as to not be"". This struggle was at the core of Porter's story and the 2003 version makes a real effort to construct a multi-dimensional Pollyanna who would have met with Porter's and her readers' approval.Otherwise, the physical casting of the two movies are amazingly similar. Amanda Burton and Pam Ferris in particular conjure up vivid memories of their predecessors Jane Wyman and Agnes Moorehead. Burton portrays Aunt Polly more sympathetically, much more in line with Porter's original characterization. Instead of a ruthless and conniving queen bee, she is more hurt than mean. The tip off comes early as she amusingly allows herself to be persuaded by Tim (Tom Ellis) to purchase a motor car. Tim provides most of the film's comic relief as his prowess with automobiles is contrasted with his shy and awkward romantic overtures toward Nancy (both motor car and romance are creations of the adaptation and not part of the Porter's original story). And Aunt Polly's obsession with flies is nicely played for laughs.There is a trade-off between the versions relative to the characters. Moorehead's Mrs. Snow was more memorable and entertaining; Ferris is not given enough material. Conversely, Kenneth Cranham (Mr. Pendleton) has more to work with than did Adolphe Menjou (Mr. Pendergast) and is not handicapped by having to share scenes with Kevin Corcoran. As in the book, the less irritating Jimmy Bean (Ben Thornton) of the 2003 version has a smaller role and there is more emphasis on Pollyanna's individual relationship with Mr. Pendleton (who was once in love with Pollyanna's mother).The only real weakness of the Masterpiece Theatre version was the need to adapt the story to a compressed 90-minute running time. This was to some extent a mixed blessing because while there are transitional gaps, the time constraints forced them to get creative ant this led to some nice sequences. A montage of a bewildered Aunt Polly receiving a parade of townspeople extolling Pollyanna's virtues is especially good, and it nicely sets her up for a mild scolding by Nancy about not allowing Pollyanna to speak openly about her father. They also responded positively to the running time issue by jumping right into the story at the beginning (just running the titles over the scene) and by wrapping things up with an understated ending that let the audience just interpret what they were seeing.The ""Pollyanna"" story has a timeless appeal for children who get off on her ability to influence adults but this film version is also a wonderful family film. This convincing story of how an 11-year-old girl's indomitable spirit positively impacts everyone around her offers enough nuances to keep adults entertained and may even elicit a few tears from otherwise cynical observers.Then again, what do I know?

The act of the little Pollyana (Georgina Terry) and others are skillful and in general everything goes well. However there are discontinuities in the filming. some events happen suddenly and sometimes you notice a sudden change that is beyond comprehension. For instance you cannot imagine an orphan and abandoned boy become noble in one day. I think the director wanted the movie to fit the time constraint, so he had to rush some of the scenes. Also the abrupt and unexpected end of the movie (where the story is still flowing) is a little confusing. I think those ending moments (happy or sad) should linger for a while so that the audience can absorb the depth opf the feeling and enjoy. Close to the end most of the scenes become chop-chop rush-rush.So there are equally good and bad things that I think exists in this movie so I think a three-star is fair for this DVD.",3,One of those classics,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,1045,"['story', 'one', 'classics', 'adorable', 'girl', 'having', 'live', 'disgruntled', 'aunt', 'mother', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'trying', 'change', 'aunt', 'act', 'little', 'Pollyana', 'Georgina', 'Terry', 'others', 'are', 'skillful', 'general', 'everything', 'well', 'However', 'are', 'discontinuities', 'filming', 'events', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'sometimes', 'notice', 'sudden', 'change', 'comprehension', 'instance', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'orphan', 'abandoned', 'boy', 'become', 'noble', 'one', 'day', 'think', 'director', 'wanted', 'movie', 'fit', 'time', 'constraint', 'had', 'rush', 'scenes', 'Also', 'abrupt', 'unexpected', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'story', 'still', 'flowing', 'little', 'confusing', 'think', 'ending', 'moments', 'happy', 'sad', 'should', 'linger', 'while', 'so', 'audience', 'can', 'absorb', 'depth', 'feeling', 'enjoy', 'Close', 'end', 'most', 'scenes', 'become', 'chop-chop', 'rush-rush.So', 'are', 'equally', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'think', 'exists', 'movie', 'so', 'think', 'three-star', 'fair', 'DVD']",N/A

We had no cluewhat to think of it, at first, and thought we would give it a try. We have seen it many times. We like it as much as ourdaughter does.This one is a treat; the girl here is just right. The entire film is done nicely. Pollyanna, by Eleanor Porter, was treatedvery well in this version. Really, the English accents, to us, does not matter at all. In truth, people in this country camefrom various countries to begin with, so this is very insignificant. In light of how it ended on the screen is the main,uppermost concern to us - in this case, happened to be wonderful. After you are travelling along with Pollyanna for a while,seeing the things she sees; knowing that she has lost both parents, and is trying to make the better of her situation, thelittle things are gone. What is left is a nicely done film.She is a girl with the ability to capture the interest and hearts of the village. She longs to play this game of hers with heraunt, whom has taken her into her home probably as duty - then her heart changes towards the last. Very sweet little girl, oneof which has qualities that everyone could learn a lesson from - kindness to all people, even those that are bitter. If morepeople were like Pollyanna, living the golden-rule as she did, this world would be a better place to live in. She could'vebeen rude to her aunt Polly on different occasions, but she was kind to her regardless. She did not repay ill for ill,contrarywise good. The period clothing and such is great.
