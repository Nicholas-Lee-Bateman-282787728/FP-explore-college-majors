I just remember that I was sorely disappointed when it came out because I'm a fan of the series of books that it's based on.  I suppose I should say &quot;loosely based on,&quot; because this doesn't even come close to the books.  The books were written by Lawrence Block and featured an aging Jewish man named Bernie Rhodenbarr.  Rumor has it that Bruce Willis bailed on the production, so it was given to Whoopi.  Not a bad decision, I suppose.  But not a good one, either.  If you like harmless mystery/comedies from the decade of The Mullet, then you will enjoy this.By the way, the books are also available here at Amazon, so you ought to do yourself a favor and pick them up, too.",3,Not bad for a movie that's supposed to be about a Jewish Man,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,760,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'little', 'romp', 'just', 'remember', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'fan', 'series', 'books', 'based', 'suppose', 'should', 'say', 'quot', 'loosely', 'based', 'quot', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'books', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'Lawrence', 'Block', 'featured', 'aging', 'Jewish', 'man', 'named', 'Bernie', 'Rhodenbarr', 'Rumor', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'bailed', 'production', 'was', 'given', 'Whoopi', 'Not', 'bad', 'decision', 'suppose', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'either', 'like', 'harmless', 'mystery/comedies', 'decade', 'Mullet', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'this.By', 'way', 'books', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'ought', 'do', 'favor', 'pick', 'up', 'too']",N/A

459679,A28GZ5XS8DE660,630530887X,Tyler Disley,"[4, 6]","Burglar is your typical D movie.  It has more bads than goods.  Actually, it has a ton of bads.  When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't expect Oscar worthy material.  But, I did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest.  I didn't get either of them.  Yes, the acting was all right.  Whoopie Goldberg is a great comedic actress, but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in.  Burglar moved at a snails pace, and that is putting it lightly.  There were way too many coincidences.  There would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around, or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen.  Also, the directing was terrible.  The director did not explain things well at all.  The only reason I stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right.  And of course, I was right.  The plot was paper-thin.  I don't like a movie when I know the ending a quarter into the film.
