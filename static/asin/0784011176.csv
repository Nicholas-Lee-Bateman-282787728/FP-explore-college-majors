However, I find myself disagreeing with the person who suggested that art house productions are an acid test of how deep a person you really are. You only need to look outside of your window to know you are deep.As for the soul, what's to say that we don't have one? This film greets us with that suggestion, as such, and guessing is one thing compared to another: not proof.Check your baggage out the door. There is no right way to enjoy this film, only let it soak into you.

74706,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784011176,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I had wanted to see `The Piano' for years, since I was about fifteen I think.  I remember reading this extensive review for it lauding it as one of the most deeply moving and touching films of the 20th century.  It took me until early this year before I actually got around to seeing it, and I must say that after a slew of repeat viewings I can honestly understand why that review held this film on such a pedestal.  `The Piano' may to many seem like there is not much to it, or that what is here is barely given a chance for explanation.  There are many actions and resulting consequences that seem out of place of character and even may be frustration (and most definitely startling) but when one takes the time to really break this film down there is so much explanation to be found within the subtleties in each frame that one is brought to a whole other understanding of the film.`The Piano' tells the tale of Ada McGrath, a mute woman living in 1850's New Zealand.  Ada has been mute, by choice, since age six when she just decided not to speak.  Through her mind's voice she tells us that she has been offered in marriage to farmer Alisdair Stewart and so she travels with her young daughter Flora and her beloved piano by boat to meet him.  She soon finds herself being led to her new home, her piano being left behind on the beach.  Her husband Alisdair, not truly understanding how to reciprocate love and affection, offers her piano to native George Baines for some of his land.  In a desperate attempt for affection Baines offers to allow Ada to purchase her piano back by performing `favors' for him, and Ada, in her desperation to have her `voice' back, agrees.Some may simply call this film a feminist film; a film that does nothing more than illustrate the woman's lack of a voice in this male dominated society.  That label gravely shortchanges what writer/director Jan Campion has accomplished with this cinematic masterpiece.`The Piano' bleeds a humanity that feels more human than we ourselves.All of the four central characters are seeking a form of redemption or gratification for their lives.  This simple truth speaks to of much deeper humanity that runs through all of our veins.  We all need to feel needed and complete, and all of these characters strung within Campions web are striving for that very feeling.  Ada is perhaps the most obvious of the four, for her beating heart is felt throughout each passing scene.  Ada longs to feel a connection with someone, the same connection she feels when gracing the keys of her piano.  She longs to have someone need her for who she is, and understand her for who she is.  Her husband seems disinterested with Ada the person, for he is quick to disregard the one object that comes closest to defining her.  George, trying to seek redemption from a past of rejection, sees the piano as an opportunity to find that redemption within the arms of Ada.  Flora is young and nave and truly loves her mother, but her loyalty is tested when she feels as though she is playing second fiddle to her mother's lover, George.  Her jealousy gives way to foolishness, and her foolishness places her mother in harms way.  Alisdair may seem like the simplest character here, for his oppressive husband character has been played before, but Alisdair struggles to rise above his own ignorance to gain the affections of a woman he can't quite understand.The performances by the entire cast are flawless and really elevate this beautiful film.  Both Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin earned those Oscar's, both giving riveting performances and crawling deep within the psyche of their characters.  Without saying but a few words Hunter is able to speak volumes, her voice being heard on every frame.  Harvey Keitel is amazing as George, restrained and tempered and believable as a lover, which is not something I was sure he could pull off.  Sam Neill, though, is the real male standout.  His grasp of Alisdair's ignorance and desperation is resounding.  The one scene where his wife attempts to give him pleasure is emotionally stirring as you watch Alisdair throw it all away because he simply doesn't understand.Jan Campion must receive the bulk of the credit though, for her construction of this film is majestic to say the least.  She truly captures the heart of each character, weaving the audience into each frame and leaving us begging for more.  The cinematography is gripping and magnetic, each frame gently settling down on the images below; and the symbolism displayed with just the slightest scene echoes loudly as the film credits begin to roll.`The Piano' appears to leave a lot of questions unanswered, but the truth of the matter is that if you look deeply into what you are witnessing the answers themselves are there to be found.  There are few films this important, and truly few films this glorious.  Everything is top notch, from the delicate script to the effortless acting to the serene camera work.  `The Piano' is a cinematic wonder that is unrivaled, a film that truly defines the very word; film.",5,A graceful escape into a world more human than ourselves...,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,5070,"['had', 'wanted', 'see', 'Piano', 'years', 'was', 'fifteen', 'think', 'remember', 'reading', 'extensive', 'review', 'lauding', 'one', 'most', 'deeply', 'moving', 'touching', 'films', '20th', 'century', 'took', 'early', 'year', 'actually', 'got', 'seeing', 'must', 'say', 'slew', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'can', 'honestly', 'understand', 'why', 'review', 'held', 'film', 'pedestal', 'Piano', 'may', 'many', 'seem', 'not', 'much', 'what', 'here', 'barely', 'given', 'chance', 'explanation', 'are', 'many', 'actions', 'resulting', 'consequences', 'seem', 'place', 'character', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'frustration', 'most', 'definitely', 'startling', 'when', 'one', 'time', 'really', 'break', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'explanation', 'be', 'found', 'subtleties', 'frame', 'one', 'brought', 'whole', 'other', 'understanding', 'film.', 'Piano', 'tells', 'tale', 'Ada', 'McGrath', 'mute', 'woman', 'living', '1850', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Ada', 'been', 'mute', 'choice', 'age', 'six', 'when', 'just', 'decided', 'not', 'speak', 'mind', 'voice', 'been', 'offered', 'marriage', 'farmer', 'Alisdair', 'Stewart', 'so', 'young', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'beloved', 'piano', 'boat', 'meet', 'soon', 'being', 'led', 'new', 'home', 'piano', 'being', 'left', 'beach', 'husband', 'Alisdair', 'not', 'truly', 'understanding', 'how', 'reciprocate', 'love', 'affection', 'piano', 'native', 'George', 'Baines', 'land', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'affection', 'Baines', 'allow', 'Ada', 'purchase', 'piano', 'back', 'performing', 'favors', 'Ada', 'desperation', 'have', 'voice', 'back', 'agrees.Some', 'may', 'simply', 'call', 'film', 'feminist', 'film', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'illustrate', 'woman', 'lack', 'voice', 'male', 'dominated', 'society', 'gravely', 'what', 'writer/director', 'Jan', 'Campion', 'accomplished', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece.', 'Piano', 'bleeds', 'humanity', 'more', 'human', 'ourselves.All', 'four', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'seeking', 'form', 'redemption', 'gratification', 'lives', 'simple', 'truth', 'speaks', 'much', 'deeper', 'humanity', 'veins', 'need', 'feel', 'needed', 'complete', 'characters', 'strung', 'Campions', 'are', 'striving', 'very', 'feeling', 'Ada', 'perhaps', 'most', 'obvious', 'four', 'beating', 'heart', 'felt', 'passing', 'scene', 'Ada', 'feel', 'connection', 'someone', 'same', 'connection', 'when', 'gracing', 'keys', 'piano', 'have', 'someone', 'need', 'who', 'understand', 'who', 'husband', 'disinterested', 'Ada', 'person', 'quick', 'disregard', 'one', 'object', 'closest', 'defining', 'George', 'trying', 'seek', 'redemption', 'past', 'rejection', 'piano', 'opportunity', 'find', 'redemption', 'arms', 'Ada', 'Flora', 'young', 'nave', 'truly', 'mother', 'loyalty', 'tested', 'when', 'feels', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'mother', 'lover', 'George', 'jealousy', 'way', 'foolishness', 'foolishness', 'places', 'mother', 'harms', 'way', 'Alisdair', 'may', 'seem', 'simplest', 'character', 'here', 'oppressive', 'husband', 'character', 'been', 'played', 'Alisdair', 'rise', 'own', 'ignorance', 'gain', 'affections', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'flawless', 'really', 'elevate', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'giving', 'riveting', 'performances', 'crawling', 'deep', 'psyche', 'characters', 'saying', 'few', 'words', 'Hunter', 'able', 'speak', 'volumes', 'voice', 'being', 'heard', 'frame', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'amazing', 'George', 'restrained', 'tempered', 'believable', 'lover', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'sure', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'though', 'real', 'male', 'standout', 'grasp', 'Alisdair', 'ignorance', 'desperation', 'resounding', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'wife', 'attempts', 'give', 'pleasure', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'watch', 'Alisdair', 'throw', 'away', 'simply', ""n't"", 'understand.Jan', 'Campion', 'must', 'receive', 'bulk', 'credit', 'construction', 'film', 'majestic', 'say', 'least', 'truly', 'heart', 'character', 'weaving', 'audience', 'frame', 'leaving', 'begging', 'more', 'cinematography', 'gripping', 'magnetic', 'frame', 'gently', 'settling', 'down', 'images', 'symbolism', 'displayed', 'just', 'slightest', 'scene', 'echoes', 'loudly', 'film', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll.', 'Piano', 'leave', 'lot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'truth', 'matter', 'look', 'deeply', 'what', 'are', 'witnessing', 'answers', 'are', 'there', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'important', 'truly', 'few', 'films', 'glorious', 'Everything', 'top', 'notch', 'delicate', 'script', 'effortless', 'acting', 'serene', 'camera', 'work', 'Piano', 'cinematic', 'wonder', 'unrivaled', 'film', 'truly', 'very', 'word', 'film']",N/A

It was the two of the most confusing-ist, boring-ist and disgusting-ist hours of my life.first of all this movie isn't at all difficult to comprehend, a Maori guy blackmails a mute, married woman to have sex with him just so she can get her most beloved possession, her piano back. She falls for him afterwards (?!) and her husband got jealous (OF COURSE!) and try to win her for himself, but finally gave her up. happy ending yippy!Why is it boring? Like so many other people have said, it dragged on way too long, and the scenes are not at all pleasant.I have NEVER been SO DISGUSTED with the nudity and the sex. Usually I have no problem with it at all and I can feel the love. But this time, GEEEEZUUUS, it's just all porn, nothing else. Why in the world would Ada fall for a guy LIKE THAT? He's rude, a pervert, has no respect for women-basically take what he want just for sex, and not to mention all-time UGLY!Instead of a love story, it seemed to me that Ada, after having sex with the guy, was jonsing to have sex again when she was nuzzling with her daughter and touching her husband's butt (which really disturbed him, hmmm I wonder why). There was NO chemistry, just erotism.lots of things are unexplained, as for example WHY ON EARTH did Neill's character marry her? What's with the show thingy? To be honest, Neill's character was much more sympathetic than the two ""lovers"" (in quote because I don't feel like they are, they feel more like ""sex partners""). But in order to make him look like the ""bad guy"", they had him chop off a finger of Ada's-simply because else-wise (without extreme violence) his rage and anger is totally understandable. Unlike Baines, he gave Ada space to become more ""affectionate"" instead of just ""taking"" her through blackmaile. the only thing he did wrong was selling her piano, but that's only because of the pervert want to use it for Ada's body and the husband really has no money-sooooo why marry??? geeez!the only two good thing I can say about the movie is 1. the acting, especially Anna Paquine and Holly Hunter. 2. the music, the music of the piano theme was beautiful.And NO, the scenery was disgusting as well, it was muddy, dirty and just feel like not the place you wanna go. Also, the whole Maori situation made me have NO respect for their culture, unlike other movie involved natives have.The piano is SO OVERRATED, that's my conclusion, I even told people if you want your kids to never have sex, make them watch this movie, they'll never want to have sex ever again.",2,the WORST love story of ALL TIME!,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2727,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'see', 'movie', 'featured', 'favorite', 'actors-', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Anna', 'Paquine', 'etc', 'gosh', 'feel', 'so', 'ashamed', 'dragging', 'mother', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'two', 'most', 'confusing-ist', 'boring-ist', 'disgusting-ist', 'hours', 'life.first', 'movie', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'Maori', 'guy', 'mute', 'married', 'woman', 'have', 'sex', 'just', 'can', 'get', 'most', 'beloved', 'possession', 'piano', 'back', 'afterwards', 'husband', 'got', 'jealous', 'COURSE', 'try', 'win', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'yippy', 'Why', 'boring', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'dragged', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'pleasant.I', 'have', 'NEVER', 'been', 'SO', 'DISGUSTED', 'nudity', 'sex', 'Usually', 'have', 'problem', 'can', 'feel', 'love', 'time', 'GEEEEZUUUS', 'just', 'porn', 'nothing', 'else', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'Ada', 'fall', 'guy', 'rude', 'pervert', 'respect', 'women-basically', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'just', 'sex', 'not', 'mention', 'all-time', 'UGLY', 'Instead', 'love', 'story', 'seemed', 'Ada', 'having', 'sex', 'guy', 'was', 'jonsing', 'have', 'sex', 'again', 'when', 'was', 'nuzzling', 'daughter', 'touching', 'husband', 'butt', 'really', 'disturbed', 'hmmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'chemistry', 'just', 'erotism.lots', 'things', 'are', 'unexplained', 'example', 'WHY', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'did', 'Neill', 'character', 'marry', 'What', 'show', 'thingy', 'be', 'honest', 'Neill', 'character', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'two', 'lovers', 'quote', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'feel', 'more', 'sex', 'partners', 'order', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'guy', 'had', 'chop', 'off', 'finger', ""Ada's-simply"", 'else-wise', 'extreme', 'violence', 'rage', 'anger', 'totally', 'understandable', 'Baines', 'gave', 'Ada', 'space', 'become', 'more', 'affectionate', 'instead', 'just', 'taking', 'blackmaile', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'wrong', 'was', 'selling', 'piano', 'only', 'pervert', 'want', 'use', 'Ada', 'body', 'husband', 'really', 'money-sooooo', 'why', 'marry', 'geeez', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', '1.', 'acting', 'especially', 'Anna', 'Paquine', 'Holly', 'Hunter', '2.', 'music', 'music', 'piano', 'theme', 'was', 'beautiful.And', 'NO', 'scenery', 'was', 'disgusting', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'muddy', 'dirty', 'just', 'feel', 'not', 'place', 'wan', 'go', 'Also', 'whole', 'Maori', 'situation', 'made', 'have', 'NO', 'respect', 'culture', 'other', 'movie', 'involved', 'have.The', 'piano', 'SO', 'OVERRATED', 'conclusion', 'even', 'told', 'people', 'want', 'kids', 'never', 'have', 'sex', 'make', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'ever', 'again']",N/A
74711,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0784011176,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 6/14Rate: 66/14: Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke did it first. Next, it was Marlee Matlin's turn. And lately, it's Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin.  They are the Oscar winners that used sign language in a film.  Of course, Louise Fletcher doesn't count. Only Anne and Patty are the deserving winners. The latter three aren't because their performances aren't anything special. I don't know how one ends up getting a truckload of awards for baring her breasts, but Holly Hunter seems to have pulled it off. It almost happened for Kate Winslet. For what else should we judge Holly's performance? Her facial expressions? Yeah, right. As a fluent signer myself, I know for sure that the signs shown in the film are completely made up although I've read accounts that sign language wasn't yet invented. That's completely untrue. This brings up another point: exactly where is the setting located at? Is it in Australia, New Zealand, or in the wild jungles of some faraway country? And another point needs that needs to be addressed: Is Holly's character Irish, English, Scottish, German, or what? Because she is none of them but American. Going back to the relevant topic on hand, sign language was already formed in France, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and other former British colonies. So, why make up the signs when there existed a crude system of signs? And amazingly enough, no fingerspelling is shown in the entire time of The Piano. Fingerspelling usually takes up 30%, but probably much more in 1850, of a conversation. Why? Because not every word has its own sign. Anyway, enough of that. Another reason I am dropping points in its rating, The Piano seems to have been made just to be bizarre for the sake of shocking the audience. Take that away: it's still a substanceless picture with weak character development in the primary players. Harvey Keitel does what he can, but it still feels to me that he is somewhat miscast because it is a very unusual performance for him. Perhaps he was the only actor who was willing to bare it all? (Note: He already did it in Bad Lieutenant the year before, so nothing new there.) And remember the moment that Ada wrote a love note on the piano key? But George can't read still, right? Sam Neill is more miscast than Harvey and has never been a good actor; he always has the same look of disbelief in all films throughout his movie career. The plot is rubbish, and the focal point of the romantic relationship seems to be predicated on the mute female being sexually offended through blackmail who then develops some sort of a syndrome to feel love for the offender. In short, Holly's character is truly sexually confused and needs some professional therapy to sort her feelings out. But it's 1850 and nothing I've said has been in vogue yet. In fact, I am very surprised that this happened considering that the film was directed by a female because this is what a male director would have typically done. All in all, why The Piano received so much acclaim that year is because it is a bizarre film, unconventionally made, that looks different from most mainstream pictures; but that's not good enough of a reason to sway me over.",3,Misplaced Critical Acclaim and Undeserving Oscar Wins For Holly and Anna.,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,3179,"['Viewed', '6/14Rate', '66/14', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'did', 'first', 'Next', 'was', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'turn', 'lately', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'are', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'used', 'sign', 'language', 'film', 'course', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', ""n't"", 'count', 'Only', 'Anne', 'Patty', 'are', 'deserving', 'winners', 'latter', 'three', 'are', ""n't"", 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'one', 'up', 'getting', 'truckload', 'awards', 'baring', 'breasts', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'almost', 'happened', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'what', 'else', 'should', 'judge', 'Holly', 'performance', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Yeah', 'right', 'fluent', 'signer', 'know', 'sure', 'signs', 'shown', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'made', 'up', ""'ve"", 'read', 'accounts', 'sign', 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'invented', 'completely', 'untrue', 'up', 'point', 'exactly', 'where', 'setting', 'located', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'wild', 'jungles', 'faraway', 'country', 'point', 'be', 'addressed', 'Holly', 'character', 'Irish', 'English', 'Scottish', 'German', 'what', 'none', 'American', 'Going', 'back', 'relevant', 'topic', 'hand', 'sign', 'language', 'was', 'already', 'formed', 'France', 'Britain', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Australia', 'other', 'former', 'British', 'colonies', 'So', 'why', 'make', 'up', 'signs', 'when', 'existed', 'crude', 'system', 'signs', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'fingerspelling', 'shown', 'entire', 'time', 'Piano', 'Fingerspelling', 'usually', 'up', '30', '%', 'probably', 'much', 'more', '1850', 'conversation', 'Why', 'not', 'word', 'own', 'sign', 'Anyway', 'enough', 'reason', 'am', 'dropping', 'points', 'rating', 'Piano', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'be', 'bizarre', 'sake', 'shocking', 'audience', 'Take', 'away', 'still', 'substanceless', 'picture', 'weak', 'character', 'development', 'primary', 'players', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'what', 'can', 'still', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'very', 'unusual', 'performance', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'bare', 'Note', 'already', 'did', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'year', 'before', 'nothing', 'new', 'there', 'remember', 'moment', 'Ada', 'wrote', 'love', 'note', 'piano', 'key', 'George', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'still', 'right', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'more', 'miscast', 'Harvey', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'actor', 'always', 'same', 'look', 'disbelief', 'films', 'movie', 'career', 'plot', 'rubbish', 'focal', 'point', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'be', 'predicated', 'mute', 'female', 'being', 'sexually', 'offended', 'blackmail', 'who', 'then', 'sort', 'syndrome', 'feel', 'love', 'offender', 'short', 'Holly', 'character', 'truly', 'sexually', 'confused', 'professional', 'therapy', 'sort', 'feelings', 'out', '1850', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'said', 'been', 'vogue', 'yet', 'fact', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'happened', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'female', 'what', 'male', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'typically', 'done', 'why', 'Piano', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'acclaim', 'year', 'bizarre', 'film', 'unconventionally', 'made', 'different', 'most', 'mainstream', 'pictures', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'sway']",N/A

74714,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,0784011176,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[0, 4]","The star of this film is a grand piano which Ada brought from Scotland to New Zealand, along with her young daughter, Flora, as she arrives for an arranged marriage.  Ada is mute, having stopped speaking aloud at the age of six, but she could talk clearly in her mind.  She speaks through her musical talent as she makes that piano speak as no classical pianist could do any better.  When Stewart and his entourage arrived on the seaside to carry them back to the village out in the forest, the piano is left behind because it is too heavy.  We bought an old ""Baldwin"" piano upright for my sons to learn to play; got gypped at the second hand shop as the ""Baldwin"" sing was glued on it and in parenthesis on the receipt.  We paid much too much for something which took six men to move.Ada and Flora would walk to the seashore where they made beautiful music, the mother on the piano and Flora dancing around like a fairy.  It could have been Yanni there playing by the sea, it was so beautiful.  Little Flora loved to make up stories about her absent father, that he had been a great German composer and died after being struck by lightning.  Children have vivid imaginations, but a basic sense of propriety.  Getting the piano moved to the home of George Baines, who was illiterate but bought the piano at a price which changed all of their lives.  Stewart had told Ada, ""You will teach him.""  Instead, George taught Ada what it felt like to be loved by a real man.  It proved to be quite a challenge to get that piano over the hills to the settlement.  It arrived slightly out of tune, but not injured.  George made a deal with Ada about how she could get it back, one visit for every black key.Stewart is a frustrated husband who spends his time bartering with the Indians and had no idea of what was happening, though Flora had seen it firsthand.  Ada was torn between two lovers and thoroughly miserable.  Was it worth the price?  I'm unhappy; I can think of nothing else -- don't sleep, can't eat; she went to him voluntarily.  Stewart was told by Flora what was happening and he looked in at their indiscretion.  When she heard that George was leaving the island, she send her ""thank you"" for the piano, the ""C"" note out of the piano.  Flora, silly girl, caused her mother to suffer another trauma worse than her lack of speech.  She expressed her hurts, needs, desires through music, but now she had lost her music, her reason to live.Silence is golden sometimes, as she heard a weird lullaby in her disturbed mind.  Stewart sets her free because he loved her.  She became demented without the man she loved after Stewart had taken an ignorant man's revenge.  It ended like the 'Scarlet Letter' had Poe penned it with shades of ""Barbara Allen"" mixed in with ""The Long Black Veil"" as she walks these hills.  She admitted that ""it was my fault.""  He felt like it had been one bad dream.  She was one hard-headed determined woman who lost her reason to live, let the past go and reconfigured her future with the man she loved.

It's a stereo mix, as it was when it was originally released, so don't expect some full immersion surround experience. It's a dialogue driven film anyway.As far as there not being subtitles, I know that they were originally part of the film, and they should be there, at least as an option, but my viewing experience was not lessened in any way by the lack of them.

Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mail-order bride who goes to remote New Zealand to meet her husband (played by Sam Neill). We learn that by choice she has not spoken since age six, though why is never disclosed; indeed, the point is made that she doesn't know why, either. Her one solace is a piano, which she plays well. But Neill refuses to have the instrument brought to his home and another man, George Baines (played by Harvey Keitel), uneducated, but morally decent, takes the piano and lets her play it at his place. But he wants something from her in return - sexual favors. Gradually they fall in love and by movie's end have gone off together, sans piano, which they have thrown into the ocean. There are a lot of unanswered questions raised: why is Ada voluntarily mute? why is she so repulsed by her husband? why does she fall for Baines? - and the fact that these mysteries linger after the credits roll is annoying. The main theme seems to revolve around the love triangle, but devoid of purpose. As a heroine, Hunter is more a freak and social outcast. The movie is poetic and sensual, but at the expense of all reason. The piano itself is an interesting symbol with lots of implications, but the wildly lush settings and extremely odd behavior of the principal characters overshadow its significance.

74719,A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS,0784011176,BookMania,"[8, 9]","This is a hauntingly somber movie, and that's precisely why I enjoyed it so much.  This movie contained the entire package that, when delivered, evokes a reaction that is sure to stay with the viewer long after the end credits are shown.In the style of the classic novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, this movie is the story of a single mother named Ada (Holly Hunter) who comes to New Zealand with her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), in order to meet a local farmer named Stewart (Sam Neill) who has arranged to marry her.  They come with their belongings, none more sentimentally valuable than Ada's piano.  However, reasoning that it is Ada's duty to make sacrifices in the interest of the family, Stewart trades the piano to a neighbor named Baines (Harvey Keitel) for the rights to some farming land.  Little does Stewart realize that Baines knows exactly how precious this piano is to Ada, and he makes this trade in an attempt to make a play on her affections.  Stewart arranges for Ada to go over to Baines' house and teach him to play the very piano that belonged to her.  Ada and Baines work out an arrangement where in lieu of teaching Baines how to play the paino, she will instead play the piano for him and allow him to use her in order to fulfill his carnal fantasies.  In exchange, Baines will eventually give the piano back to Ada.  As time goes by, Ada goes as far as sleeping with Baines in order to work off the debt she owes him for her piano, but after a while, Ada's trysts with Baines are no longer for the sake of earning her piano back, but are voluntary.  She develops feelings for Baines, much to the chagrin of her husband, who locks Ada and Flora up in their house in order to prevent them from going to Baines' house.There were some brilliant performances in this movie.  Though Anna Paquin's character only plays a small part in moving the story along, her screen presence is extraordinary.  She was one of the youngest actors to ever win the Academy Award, and her Oscar was much deserved.  Holly Hunter also won an Oscar for this movie, and it, too, was well deserved, especially considering the fact that she didn't utter a single word for the entire movie.  The strength of her performance relied solely on her acting ability, and could not be assisted with the influence that there voice might have carried.  Of the males in this movie, Harvey Keitel does a sold job as a rather homely farmer, but the real credit must go to Sam Neill as Ada's husband.  The tantrums that he throws are very realistic and incredibly compelling.Also worthy of mention is the movie's incredible art direction and cinematography.  The entire movie takes place in a gloomy beachfront and forest.

This is what happens in this film: a piano owned by Holly Hunter's character is left on the beach when she arrives to be Sam Neill's wife. Why does Neill's character take much care with Holly Hunter and her daughter and her bags while totally ignoring the piano? Because the writer/director wants to show us that her mail order husband (Sam Neill) is not a caring person. He has dozens of men working for him, but leaves the piano on the beach in the surf because he can't be bothered, it seems. Neill then sells her piano to consecrate the idea the idea that he is unfeeling. Harvey Keitel's character realizes the importance of the piano to this woman and to manipulate her he trades his friend for this piano and then later offers to give it back to Holly Hunter for sexual favors (an offer which is accepted by her without words since she doesn't speak in this film, her only ""voice"" being the keys of her piano). During this we see Harvey Keitel graphically nude and Holly Hunter topless. Sam Neill, of course, gets jealous and resents ""his wife"" sleeping with his friend. Because the director/writer has not been successful in persuading the viewer that Sam Neill is such a brute of a man after 90 minutes of film she has Sam Neill, in retaliation for Hunter's adultery, attack Holly Hunter's character, graphically cutting off one of her fingers as she struggles to get out of the muck and mud of a swamp-like area. Thus it takes 90 minutes of this film to generate any sympathy for Holly Hunter's character. Add endless overcast skies (wonderfully filmed, however) and finally we see Holly Hunter's character basically choosing to go overboard from a canoe-like boat. When she does go into the water you may have more sympathy for her and be emphatically moved, or maybe not. Hunter's character herein is lifeless (some would argue that's the point of this film; nothing is said how she ""lost"" her first husband or why she has to travel around the world for a new man to take her), but because she is lifeless watching her sink in the ocean is rather anti-climatic. As I have said, if you have seen this film and liked this film my words ought not be especially relevant to you. But if you haven't and don't relish watching needlessly graphic nudity (which could easily been obscured, making no difference to the film)and needlessly graphic violence (the index finger being hacked off with a tree axe herein) then maybe this film is not for you.",3,From scene 1 the writer/director tries to make us hate Sam Neill & sympathize with the cold & later adulterous Holly Hunter,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2662,"['can', 'say', 'hey', 'loved', 'film', 'will', 'too', 'leave', 'review', 'collect', 'votes', 'instead', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'collect', 'negative', 'votes', 'instead', 'what', 'film', 'piano', 'owned', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'character', 'left', 'beach', 'when', 'be', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'wife', 'Why', 'Neill', 'character', 'take', 'much', 'care', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'daughter', 'bags', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'piano', 'writer/director', 'show', 'mail', 'order', 'husband', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'not', 'caring', 'person', 'dozens', 'men', 'working', 'piano', 'beach', 'surf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'Neill', 'then', 'piano', 'consecrate', 'idea', 'idea', 'unfeeling', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'character', 'importance', 'piano', 'woman', 'manipulate', 'friend', 'piano', 'then', 'later', 'give', 'back', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'sexual', 'favors', 'offer', 'accepted', 'words', ""n't"", 'speak', 'film', 'only', 'voice', 'being', 'keys', 'piano', 'see', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'graphically', 'nude', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'topless', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'course', 'jealous', 'wife', 'sleeping', 'friend', 'director/writer', 'not', 'been', 'successful', 'persuading', 'viewer', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'such', 'brute', 'man', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'retaliation', 'Hunter', 'adultery', 'attack', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'character', 'graphically', 'cutting', 'off', 'one', 'fingers', 'get', 'muck', 'mud', 'swamp-like', 'area', 'Thus', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'character', 'Add', 'endless', 'overcast', 'skies', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'however', 'finally', 'see', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'character', 'basically', 'choosing', 'go', 'overboard', 'canoe-like', 'boat', 'When', 'go', 'water', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'sympathy', 'be', 'emphatically', 'moved', 'maybe', 'not', 'Hunter', 'character', 'herein', 'lifeless', 'would', 'argue', 'point', 'film', 'nothing', 'said', 'how', 'lost', 'first', 'husband', 'why', 'travel', 'world', 'new', 'man', 'take', 'lifeless', 'watching', 'sink', 'ocean', 'rather', 'anti-climatic', 'have', 'said', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'liked', 'film', 'words', 'ought', 'not', 'be', 'especially', 'relevant', 'have', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'relish', 'watching', 'needlessly', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'could', 'easily', 'been', 'obscured', 'making', 'difference', 'film', 'needlessly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'index', 'finger', 'being', 'hacked', 'off', 'tree', 'axe', 'herein', 'then', 'maybe', 'film', 'not']",N/A

With good reason it was nominated for eight Oscars, earning three, as well as receiving 27 nominations and 58 wins in other circles. Now, after quite some wait, this magnificent film is available in its Blu-ray edition. And what a delight to the eyes it is!Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute woman who moved to New Zealand, with Flora (Anna Paquin), her young daughter. She is meeting Alistair Stewart (Sam Neill), her new husband from an arranged marriage. Once arriving to the island, she is left at the beach with Flora, their few belongings, and her piano. However, when Alistair arrives to pick her up, he informs her that they will not be able to take the piano with them, because the house is deep inside, and they can not transport it through the jungle. This breaks Ada's heart, for the piano is her most valued material possession.Once at their home, Ada, for some reason, doesn't have chemistry with her husband - maybe because of the piano -, and they have trouble consummating the marriage. Enter George Baines (Harvey Keitel), one of Alistair's workers at the plantation, who goes to the beach, picks the piano, carries it with some guys through the jungle, and takes it to his house. This action makes Ada happy, but George takes advantage of the situation, by telling her that she can have the piano back if she teaches him how to play it. Of course, George has something else in mind, and, as you can imagine, there will be trouble in paradise.""The Piano"" is a beautiful movie to watch. It has lush cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh; excellent acting, which resulted in Oscars for Hunter (Best Actress) and Paquin (Best Supporting actress); great directing by Jane Campion (who won an Oscar for Best Screenplay written for the Screen); and awesome production design by Andrew McAlpine. Of course, we already now that Anna Paquin stole the movie - her charm is just mesmerizing. This is one Blu-ray to have.

74727,A1NVO2OVXE09F4,0784011176,Caryss Wood-Behan,"[5, 10]","A piano as metaphor for repressed emotions  - an ingenious concept - hits more than a few discordant notes.This movie, with its bleak background and dissonant characters, played out like a song with no melody as the story unfolded, one disturbing chord after another.  The setting, a coastal New Zealand town in mid-Victorian era, provided an achromatic backdrop for an equally dreary film.I did not like this film for a few reasons, one of them being the miscasting of Harvey Keitel in the role of Baines.  His appearance in the buff did nothing to convince me otherwise.  While I did not consider his nudity repulsive, the scene struck me as having been done for the purpose of shocking the viewer. In lieu of this approach, a less flagrant, more tasteful method of conveying Baines' desire to ""lie with"" the woman, Ada, might have been devised.While the overall tenor of the film captures the essence of the screenplay on which it was based, the two main characters lack sexual chemistry on any appreciable level. This casting mismatch falls flat in its possible efforts to evoke genuine sympathy for Ada while it appears to successfully intensify the viewer's loathing of Baine's character.Despite repressed emotions and unsatiated sexual appetites as the unspoken byline, the film misses that mounting sexual crescendo that begs for release and inevitably explodes in a momentous fireball of passion.  Instead, Baines and Ada hit fever pitch on the day Ada arrives, unannounced, at Baines' cottage.  After going inside, Ada looks around and does not see Baines.  Then, from behind the privacy curtain he appears, dissheveled and ill kempt.  The viewer watches as he grabs his trousers and puts them quickly on, all the while trying to assume some semblance of dignity.  In a clumsy attempt to explain the awkward predicament, Baines, distressed, tells Ada that he thinks of her all the time - indeed, he cannot eat nor sleep as a result of this preoccupation -  and, he says, he needs more. In case Ada needs clarification, Baines uses this moment to try his hand at subtlety and gestures toward his male member.Ada's reaction to Baines' carnal confession is predictable.  Her demeanor, complete with the requisite frown and pursed lips, reflects a skittish stoicism that seems to incense Baines.  When he suddenly and very definitively orders Ada to leave his house, Ada appears flummoxed.  What begins as a simple directive, ""Go,"" escalates to an unequivocal command of, ""Get out!"" ""Get out!""  Ada, visibly shaken, proceeds to  execute a wordless offensive maneuver onto the object of her frustration.  Baines' chest takes a frenzied pummeling that concludes with Ada inexplicably, frantically, clutching  Baines and locking lips with him in a pitiful demonstration of requited attraction.By the time the precious piano is chucked, like so much dead wood, into the water, I couldn't help but wonder how I could have missed the point in the film where Ada had begun to regard the piano with such enmity.Which is all the more reason Ada ought to have fashioned the piano into a boat and sailed away from that wretched place -  all alone and, no doubt, living happily ever after.",2,These Keys Don't Fit,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,3183,"['piano', 'metaphor', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'ingenious', 'concept', 'more', 'few', 'discordant', 'notes.This', 'movie', 'bleak', 'background', 'dissonant', 'characters', 'played', 'out', 'song', 'melody', 'story', 'unfolded', 'one', 'disturbing', 'chord', 'setting', 'coastal', 'New', 'Zealand', 'town', 'mid-Victorian', 'era', 'provided', 'achromatic', 'backdrop', 'equally', 'dreary', 'film.I', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'few', 'reasons', 'one', 'being', 'miscasting', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'role', 'Baines', 'appearance', 'buff', 'did', 'nothing', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'nudity', 'repulsive', 'scene', 'struck', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'purpose', 'shocking', 'viewer', 'lieu', 'approach', 'less', 'flagrant', 'more', 'tasteful', 'method', 'conveying', 'Baines', 'desire', 'lie', 'woman', 'Ada', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'overall', 'tenor', 'film', 'essence', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'lack', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'appreciable', 'level', 'casting', 'mismatch', 'flat', 'possible', 'efforts', 'evoke', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'Ada', 'successfully', 'intensify', 'viewer', 'loathing', 'Baine', 'character.Despite', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'unsatiated', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'unspoken', 'byline', 'film', 'mounting', 'sexual', 'crescendo', 'release', 'inevitably', 'explodes', 'momentous', 'fireball', 'passion', 'Instead', 'Baines', 'Ada', 'hit', 'fever', 'pitch', 'day', 'Ada', 'unannounced', 'Baines', 'cottage', 'going', 'inside', 'Ada', 'around', 'not', 'see', 'Baines', 'Then', 'privacy', 'curtain', 'dissheveled', 'ill', 'kempt', 'viewer', 'watches', 'trousers', 'quickly', 'while', 'trying', 'assume', 'semblance', 'dignity', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'explain', 'awkward', 'predicament', 'Baines', 'distressed', 'Ada', 'time', 'indeed', 'can', 'not', 'eat', 'sleep', 'result', 'preoccupation', 'more', 'case', 'Ada', 'clarification', 'Baines', 'moment', 'try', 'hand', 'subtlety', 'gestures', 'male', 'member.Ada', 'reaction', 'Baines', 'carnal', 'confession', 'predictable', 'demeanor', 'complete', 'requisite', 'frown', 'pursed', 'lips', 'skittish', 'stoicism', 'incense', 'Baines', 'When', 'suddenly', 'very', 'definitively', 'orders', 'Ada', 'leave', 'house', 'Ada', 'flummoxed', 'What', 'simple', 'directive', 'Go', 'unequivocal', 'command', 'Get', 'out', 'Get', 'out', 'Ada', 'visibly', 'shaken', 'proceeds', 'execute', 'wordless', 'offensive', 'maneuver', 'object', 'frustration', 'Baines', 'chest', 'frenzied', 'pummeling', 'Ada', 'inexplicably', 'frantically', 'clutching', 'Baines', 'locking', 'lips', 'pitiful', 'demonstration', 'requited', 'time', 'precious', 'piano', 'chucked', 'so', 'much', 'dead', 'wood', 'water', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'Ada', 'had', 'begun', 'regard', 'piano', 'such', 'enmity.Which', 'more', 'reason', 'Ada', 'ought', 'have', 'fashioned', 'piano', 'boat', 'sailed', 'away', 'wretched', 'place', 'alone', 'doubt', 'living', 'happily', 'ever']",N/A

She also captured an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 1993 Oscars, while also being nominated for Best Director. Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin both won Oscars as well, and it was also nominated for Best Picture, Costumes, Editing, and Cinematography.Fast forward to 2009, and Jane Campion is once again at Cannes, this time for Bright Star, which tells of the romance between the 19th century romantic poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne. Campion's still the only woman to have ever won the Cannes Palme d'Or, and she's one of only 3 women directors who have films in competition at Cannes this year out of 20 (Andrea Arnold and Isabel Coixet are the others).""The studio system is an old boy's system, and it's difficult for them to trust women to be capable,"" said Jane. ""So good luck to my female friends in the competition. They represent half the population [who] gave birth to the whole world.""With such strongly voiced feminist views it's not surprising that The Piano was a feminist manifesto. Forced into an arranged marriage, Ada (Holly Hunter) is sent to live in New Zealand where she's treated like some kind of commodity--a servant or even a slave. A mail order bride, her husband (Sam Neill) had hoped that being mute she would do as she was told without any back talk. Upon finally seeing her, he is disappointed by how small she is, and also totally indifferent to her desire to play her beloved piano. Under the circumstances, her eventual adultery and supposed neglect of her husband and family is excusable--in fact, her refusal to accept the role forced on her is exemplary. At least that is the point that writer/director Campion espouses.Following a thread about it on IMDB the audience seemed to fragment, with some saying they didn't like Ada McGrath or approve of her, and they certainly didn't care for her adulterous affair with George Baines (Harvey Keitel). There was even sympathy for her husband, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill), up to a point.Others sided with Ada, I among them. I think that Campion made her case, and gave the characters enough complexity and ambiguity that they came to life as people rather than cardboard cutouts in a feminist propaganda play.Sometimes, though, it seemed they were more in danger of becoming symbols. Especially Ada and her piano. The piano was meant to symbolize Ada's feelings and emotions. The fact that she was mute meant that the piano was her only creative outlet. An extended metaphor, if you will. She spoke with her hands, signing to her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin); or pounding out her emotions on the piano. Hands, fingers, touching, sensual caresses--a recurring motif throughout.Then, the piano became a bargaining chip, as it was traded for land with little regard for her feelings, to George Baines. Baines was a plantation worker, illiterate, who wore the facial tattoos of the Maori, and also spoke their language. He has ""gone native."" Though he is a bit rough around the edges, he is more sensitive to Ada's feelings then her husband. He sees that the piano is the key to her heart, so he has it tuned and signs up for piano lessons, a thin pretext to try and seduce her. He proposes a bargain, that he will return her piano to her when she has earned it, one black key at a time, in return for certain favors and indulgences.----------------------George Baines: I want to lie together without clothes on.==============================This of course leads to trouble when Flora mentions something to Alisdair. Though mother and daughter share a strong bond, Flora often acting as translator for her mother's sign language, she doesn't understand what is going on between Baines and Ada. Being a very precocious child she thinks she does.-----------------------------Flora: I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano. She never gives him a turn. She just plays whatever she pleases and sometimes she doesn't play at all.Stewart: And when is the next lesson?Flora: Tomorrow.===========================================I don't want to spoil the ending, but you can see that we are headed for a showdown.Though the director had a not very well hidden agenda, and was a bit heavy handed with the symbolism, it succeeds as art due to the excellent performances by Hunter and Pacquin, who both won Oscars; and Keitel and Neill. Holly Hunter even played most of the piano parts herself, and Pacquin was nothing short of amazing. She is the second youngest person ever to win an Oscar, and she totally deserved it. Her character was very complex and nuanced, yet she never missed a beat. Upon meeting some women she gives this little speech by way of introduction:-----------------Flora: One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall, and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lighting came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch. And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She never spoke another word.=========================This would explain a lot. Except that it is all lies. We know from the voice over narration that Ada had not spoken a word since she was six years old, and hence was not an opera singer. Flora is a child of uncommon sophistication, yet still she inhabits the land of make believe. Pacquin, being 11, had little trouble acting like a child, but her uncommon sophistication was quite rare and very uncommon indeed.The Piano reminded me a lot of another feminist manifesto written around the same time that The Piano was set, in the 1850's. In 1899, Kate Chopin's second novel, The Awakening, was published, and was criticized based on moral as well as literary standards. Her best-known work, it is the story of a woman trapped in the confines of an oppressive society. Out of print for several decades, it is now widely available and critically acclaimed for the quality of the writing and its importance as a seminal feminist work (is that an oxymoron?).The Awakening begins with the Pontellier family vacationing at the summer resort of Grand Isle. Edna, the protagonist, is the wife of a successful businessman, L&eacute;once. Since L&eacute;once is constantly occupied with his work, Edna begins to rely on others in Grand Isle for company. She meets Robert Lebrun, who is the son of the woman who manages the cottages on Grand Isle, and begins to fall passionately in love with him. However, Robert can't handle their forbidden love so he runs off to Mexico. Next she has an affair with Alc&eacute;e Arobin, a man with a reputation as the biggest flirt in town. She feels guilty for cheating--on Robert--not her husband. Tiring of her affair, she next moves out and completely rejects her role as wife and mother, neglecting her children even.What I find interesting is that both the novel, The Awakening, and The Piano were met with the same kind of criticism. No matter how oppressive and unfulfilling a marriage is, there are always those who will condemn a woman who rejects it. Yet, The Piano won three Oscars, and was nominated for five others. After a hundred years or so, at least some progress has been made.SELECTED FILMOGRAPHIES:HOLLY HUNTERThirteen(2003) .... Melanie FreelandO Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000) .... PennyCrash(1996) ....

74730,A1UIUIOHOHHX2X,0784011176,"Charlotte Drobnicki ""jolliedd""","[3, 4]","I found this movie disturbing and parts of it left me amazed to say the least. Set in the mid-nineteenth century, it gives one a good impression of life in the rugged forests of New Zealand's South Island and the natives living there at that time. But, from the beginning there is trouble: Ada's father arranges her a marriage to a man she has never met. Then, when she meets Alisdair Stewart, they DO NOT connect--especially since he denies her, her beloved piano. This sets off a chain of events, as the piano is the key to unlocking Ada's heart. Leave it to her husband's strange neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel) -and his superb acting I might add-even in the buff; to unlock her soul. A pity it is though that Ada's husband Stewart (Sam Neill) drove her to sell herself to George in order to get the piano back.Like Ada the mute, I too would have found life on the South Island distressing-all the muck and mire and remoteness. I would have hated it and also would have become disillusioned. Yes, what she did was wrong-falling for George the way she did. But, her daughter Flora was despicable, feeding into Stewart's rage. Stewart was a violent, abusive, heartless man and his behavior was inexcusable-- from the moment he denied Ada her piano. The only redemption here is that later Stewart heard Ada's 'inner voice' speak and came to his senses.Here is another fluke: Ada left her native Scotland? You could have fooled me! The accents of George, Ada and Flora, fake as they were, sounded as if they originated from Ireland. The natives were the only actors not guilty of fakery and they were very convincing. Many of them I give credit to in fact, since they saved Ada from the sea.As a fellow pianist, I found the piano music as beautiful as the piano itself. Was that Holly Hunter playing? It appeared that way. I felt Ada's pain when she released the piano from the canoe, to the sea. The climax of the movie though-left me a bit confused. Did Ada drown in the ocean with her piano? Or did her and George, as I hope, live happily ever after? I am led to believe that the natives DID save her, and that the beautiful white house, George's kisses, Ada's gorgeous gown, earrings, as well as her metal finger George crafted since Stewart cut the other one off; were all real. So, if it was a happy ending for George, Ada, and Flora, yippee! Still, due to the plot and confusing ending, I could not give this movie 5 stars.",4,The Piano Struck An Awry Chord,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2436,"['found', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'parts', 'left', 'amazed', 'say', 'least', 'Set', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'one', 'good', 'impression', 'life', 'rugged', 'forests', 'New', 'Zealand', 'South', 'Island', 'natives', 'living', 'there', 'time', 'beginning', 'trouble', 'Ada', 'father', 'marriage', 'man', 'never', 'met', 'Then', 'when', 'Alisdair', 'Stewart', 'DO', 'NOT', 'connect', 'especially', 'beloved', 'piano', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'piano', 'key', 'unlocking', 'Ada', 'heart', 'Leave', 'husband', 'strange', 'neighbor', 'George', 'Baines', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', '-and', 'superb', 'acting', 'might', 'add-even', 'buff', 'unlock', 'soul', 'pity', 'Ada', 'husband', 'Stewart', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'drove', 'sell', 'George', 'order', 'get', 'piano', 'Ada', 'mute', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'life', 'South', 'Island', 'distressing-all', 'muck', 'mire', 'remoteness', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'Yes', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'wrong-falling', 'George', 'way', 'did', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'was', 'despicable', 'feeding', 'Stewart', 'rage', 'Stewart', 'was', 'violent', 'abusive', 'heartless', 'man', 'behavior', 'was', 'inexcusable', 'moment', 'denied', 'Ada', 'piano', 'only', 'redemption', 'here', 'later', 'Stewart', 'heard', 'Ada', ""'inner"", 'voice', 'speak', 'came', 'senses.Here', 'fluke', 'Ada', 'left', 'native', 'Scotland', 'could', 'have', 'fooled', 'accents', 'George', 'Ada', 'Flora', 'fake', 'were', 'sounded', 'originated', 'Ireland', 'natives', 'were', 'only', 'actors', 'not', 'guilty', 'fakery', 'were', 'very', 'convincing', 'Many', 'give', 'credit', 'fact', 'saved', 'Ada', 'sea.As', 'fellow', 'pianist', 'found', 'piano', 'music', 'as', 'beautiful', 'piano', 'Was', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'playing', 'appeared', 'way', 'felt', 'Ada', 'pain', 'when', 'released', 'piano', 'canoe', 'sea', 'climax', 'movie', 'though-left', 'bit', 'confused', 'Did', 'Ada', 'drown', 'ocean', 'piano', 'did', 'George', 'hope', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'am', 'led', 'believe', 'natives', 'DID', 'save', 'her', 'beautiful', 'white', 'house', 'George', 'kisses', 'Ada', 'gorgeous', 'gown', 'earrings', 'as', 'well', 'metal', 'finger', 'George', 'crafted', 'Stewart', 'cut', 'other', 'one', 'were', 'real', 'So', 'was', 'happy', 'ending', 'George', 'Ada', 'Flora', 'yippee', 'Still', 'due', 'plot', 'confusing', 'ending', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars']",N/A
74731,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,0784011176,Chris Fung,"[10, 24]","Let me be clear, I got ahuge lump in my throat when I saw this movie.  It's beautifully shot, realistically grubby and the violence is not at hair out of place for the period or for modern New Zealand (on a spiritual if not &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; level).  Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin were all stupendous.Campion here presents us with a wonderfully expatriate view of New Zealand as it was, and to her credit, uncovers many of the dirty secrets in the NZ psyche.In fact, as a movie about white New Zealanders, this was a 5 star piece of cinema.  With the right foregrounding you can see many of the things that are intensely problematic about New Zealand society both historically and now: the blinkered provincialism, the contempt for indigenous people (except as trendy accessories), the horrific valorization of commerce over art (anti-intellectual, anti-artistic and anti-spiritual) and the systematic devaluing of women and love of violence that thrive in the standard blokes-are-us set of understandings of NZ both past and present that you can find in any pub or wine bar in any part of the country on a Friday night.That being said, the movie also plays the natives for laughs and inexplicably places the character of Bain as a partially-tattooed culture broker for Maori who have English muskets but apparently no command of the English language themselves.  While figures like Bain were certainly important during the early years of the New Zealand colony (1800-1840), the following decades when the film is set saw their importance decline rapidly. In any case, relations between Maori and European for almost the whole of the 19th century were much more intensive and intimate than this movie makes out.This historical elision is actually important because it provides a way for white people to be the sole group at the center of the movie and ignores the fundamental inter-relatedness of the Maori and European communities during this time period.  In this vein, Campion can make a movie which does not challenge our understanding of European settlement of this (and other countries) as a heroic endeavor against the odds in some sort of cultural vacuum.For the record, during the intial phases of English settlement in Aotearoa, Maori in many areas became fluent in English (at least to trade) very quickly.  If Sam Neill's little outpost had been established long enough to have an amateur dramatic society there would have been more than a dozen local men and women who would have been fluent enough and canny enough to be giving the English a hefty run for their money.Maori successes in commerce (the Waikato tribes for instance were sending tons of salt meat, potatoes and other vegetables to Australia on their own merchant ships by the early 1860s) actually led to colonists deliberately starting wars with Maori in order to eliminate superior Maori economic competition. This probably qualifies as one of the most blatant interferences in the free market (too bad there wasn't a World Trade Organization back then!). Maori in some parts of the country owned flour mills, fishing vessels, and toll booths and ordered china tea sets from England.We have no notion of English barbarism in their own country during this period either.  The subtext is that we do not need to know about the burgeoning Industrial Revolution with its smoke stacks and polluted rivers, the Poor Laws which forced debtors into prison and made hundreds of small farmers destitute, the riots over bread, the public hangings or the sale of small children in the streets of London.  Like Martians, Holly Hunter and her piano are transported to the beach, no one cares where from.  It is the quintessential Euro-settler fantasy: &quot;I come from nowhere with nothing, land here and make the earth productive with my own bare hands and bring civilization.&quot;What this movie shamelessly replicates is a Kiplingesque story of plucky European triumph over the native landscape (and the Philistine colonists as well to be sure - here Sam Neill is placed outside civilization as surely as the Maori).

It strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set. The quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and most especially Anna Paquin, whose skillful portrayal here won her an Oscar at the tender age of eleven. The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique. For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano...I'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality.

74736,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,0784011176,David Anderson,"[6, 8]","""The Piano"" stars Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and Anna Paquin.  It received several Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.  Its brilliant quality proves that every nomination was deserved.  The plot of a mute woman, Ada, whose only form of expression is through her piano was written beautifully.  Jane Campion's Oscar winning efforts express her highly creative outlook in film.  It combines drama, mystery, and romance.  Many twists and turns arise as Ada falls in love with a mysterious man not her husband.  The movie's gloomy theme blends perfectly with every event; past, present, or future.  It reminds the audience of the danger that certain characters are in, regardless of what they say or do.  The cinematography and the editing wonderfully contribute to this effect.The art design proves that the artists researched the European styles of the 1800's.  Every detail is flawless.  The costumes were equally wonderfully crafted.  Every detail on the set contributes to the movie plot, adding its necessary theme.Every actor performs their roles beautifully.  Holly Hunter's Best Actress Oscar winning role, Ada, was highly emotional.  Only one other performer has won the Oscar for a lead role for playing a mute person(Marlee Matlin, 1986).  She never holds back a drop of heart and soul through her character.  Her task of expressing her character's emotions through only non-verbal means is highly difficult.  She mastered it.  This is her best role in her career.  Anna Paquin's Best Supporting Actress Oscar winning role, Ada's daughter Flora, is amazing.  This made her the second youngest Oscar winner for acting efforts(age 11).  No words can describe how amazing and how underrated she is.  Her European accent is as flawless as her acting.  Harvey Keitel offers his own mystery theme in his Oscar nominated role as Ada's gothic non-husband lover.  Sam Neill's role as Ada's wife is brilliant.  His character's rage scenes are perfect.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles wonderfully.""The Piano"" offers an amazing roller coaster ride, though some scenes may become highly depressing.  Those looking for a power drama should watch this movie.  This offers high emotions that forces the audience to feel what that characters are feeling.  Many viewers will be entertained throughout.

I flat out did not like it...every character was unlikeable.  Mr. Stewart (Sam Neill) was so strange and selfish towards his wife, especially when he refused to believe that her piano was her intrumental ""voice"" and prized possession, and that she needed it like she needed air to survive; Ida (Holly Hunter)was so peculiar in many ways; Baines (Harvey Keitel) took away Ada's beloved piano and wanted strange sexual favors in return--so how was he a true lover to her? The little daughter (Anna Paquin) betrayed her mother...and so on.But really there is more to it then simply meets the eye.  Ada's father(who has no speaking part in the film) wants her married off...just to get rid of this burden that he has.  He does this because, after all, who was going to marry a mute woman with an illigitimate child?  He sure does not want her. He marries her off---and guess what?  He marries her off to a man living in New Zealand--to the other side of the world. It might as well be to another planet in the solar system.New Zealand is no Scotland, and Ada finds herself stuck in strange new world.  It's not a rolling-green, hilled countryside that is cultured and refined like her homeland.  Its a foreign frontier, a rugged, isolated, mud-messed place of a land that is filled with the Maori natives who are as different from Ada as can be.  They don't speak the same language.  They don't understand her.  She does not understand them. A few white missionaries are close by, but they are oddly amuzing and out-of-touch as can be, and Ada will never be able to befriend them, nor will they like her.She had no choice to marry Mr. Stewart, so she simply has to make the best of it. She does not want him.  He truly repulses her.So why isn't she instantly in love with her husband?  This man is just as complicated as she is. He thinks that her muteness means that she is dumb, less than a human being (like a ""silent"" pet, the one missionary lady in the film refers to her as).  He will never understand her because he cannot even understand himself.Ada does not know why she stopped talking at the age of 6.  ""My father thinks it is a dark talent, and the day I take it in my head to stop breathing will be my last"".  Ada only gives narration in the beginning of the film, and in the end.  ""The voice you hear is not my speaking voice, but my mind's voice..."".Holly Hunter has a demanding role in this movie.  No wonder she got the praise and the award for her peformance!  She is amazing in it!Ada's daughter often translates and is a spokesperson for her mother. She can be adorable, but also wickedly precocious.  Ada begs Baines to take her back to the beach where he and Stewart and some Maori people picked her up from her arrival.  At first, Ada is a bother him.  He can't do it....he does not have the time.  Soon, he gives in.Some really beautiful shots are in this next scene.  Ada plays her beloved piano again.  For the first time, she actually smiles in this film (Ada is not addicted to happiness).  Baines may be illiterate, and less cultured than her, but this man is realizing that he has found a beatiful gem in Ada.  She loves her piano.  Her playing mystifies him.  From that time on, he realizes that he must have her heart.  But how?Only through getting the piano can Baines connect with Ada.  What he does in buying her piano from her husband seems cruel, but Baines knows Ada will never go for him.  She sees him as an ignorant oaf.  Maybe he can have her and her lovely piano?

It somehow just did not make sense, and I really don't know what I was expecting. A few years passed, I traveled to New Zealand and even visited Karekare beach where many scenes from the film were made. I read the script and then watched the film again and was stricken by so many things about it that I had not appreciated the first time. Holly Hunter won an Oscar for her performance, and although I am sure her role as the mute woman was challenging (and she was very expressive), I did not find her role the most interesting. More interesting were the roles of the excellent Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel. Of course without Hunter's role the supporting roles would not have been as meaty or convincing. But I have to say that Keitel's role as a subtle but firm near-native who falls in love with Hunter's character is clever and sometimes heartbreaking. He goes to outstanding lengths to spend time with Hunter, and eventually he gets what he wants. And eventually they do indeed fall in love, but his frustration along the way is clearly felt. The severe, stern, and controlling behaviour of Sam Neill's character is equally felt. He wants so much to make a family and home together with Hunter's character, but he cannot begin to bend or accommodate her in any way. He makes no effort to love, understand or get to know her really, which is why he ultimately and completely fails. Hunter can only find expression in music. Keitel encourages the music while Neill silences it. After Neill learns of her affair with Keitel he tries to keep her cooped up in the house. She gets her piano back, but she does not care anymore. She gives one of the piano keys to her young daughter (played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for her role) to take to Keitel. Instead she takes them to Neill, feeling angry that Hunter is betraying not only Neill but also her, in a sense. Neill is so frustrated and angry he comes home and chops off some of Hunter's fingers. (The gorgeous soundtrack to the film has a song ""I Clipped Your Wing"" which alludes to this scene. There is no more perfect analogy to Neill's cutting off Hunter's fingers than to say he was clipping her wing). Eventually Hunter and Keitel leave New Zealand together, but Hunter tries to drown herself on their sailing away. She does not succeed.

It is not the kind of emotional experiance where you cry throughout the movie. It is the kind that makes you gasp and keeps you motionless.The plot could be seen as a simple love triangle, between the mute woman Ada (Holly Hunter), her husband of an arranged marrage (Sam Neil) and her slightly gruff and seclusive neighbor (Harvey Keitel).It is much more than that, it is also a story about Ada's love for her Piano. The love for her tool to speak. The way her neighbor George Bains understands this love and her husband does not.The casting for the movie is perfect. Holly Hunter does not speak, nor does she cry and wail when she is angry or sad. She simply FEELS, and we can easily see what she is feeling without her showing us. Her Academy Award was well deserved.Anna Paquin, who also recieved an Academy Award for her performance as Ada's mischivous but angleic daughter, is brilliant. Sam Neil's charachter is not as developed as some of the others. But the sadness seen in his eyes makes you wonder what bad things have happened to him in tha past, for you can tell by how easily he gets frusterated with Ada that something else has happened.Harvey Keitel has played a difficult character, because he makes a very crude offer to Ada concerning how she can get her Piano back. Written on a peice of paper, George Bains would seem like a perverted creep...but Keitel plays his character with warmth, and immediatly you know that Bains knows what he is doing, and you trust him.The real supporting cast would also have to be the cinematography and the music.

Some are quick to dismiss this film as a &quot;love triangle&quot; story, and cannot fathom I would compare it to the scope and horror of the Holocaust. Read on, non-believers...In numerous ways, Campion's direction is more inventive than those who were nominated that year, and more passionate.The landscape of New Zealand is not merely a location, but comes to serve as a character when interacting with the people in the story. The tangled, mysterious bush of the wilderness becomes a metaphor for the complexity of emotion within the characters and the relationships in which they entwine themselves. The instrument of the piano and its songs come to serve as the soul of the heroine, Ada McGrath. Like the succulent rain ever-present in the film, the emotion literally drips from every frame of the film.  This is where Campion most brilliantly succeeds.The story and original screenplay, which was purely Campion's, not only delves into the odd love triangle, but examines the makeup of an oddly unconventional woman who choses to be silent, yet through everything she does, proves to not be a silent victim of a time when women were little more than possessions to be traded and bartered through a simple exchange of letters.Even though Ada is signed over in marriage by her father precisely in this manner, we bravely witness a valiant soul who refuses to give love out of duty or obligation.  The love which does flow from Ada is a turbulent force, and explores an eroticism not regularly shown in film, nor in a woman, nor in a woman of the late 19th century.The film is complimented brilliantly by the superb acting of Oscar winners Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin, along with Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.  The sweeping score by Michael Nyman is otherworldly yet soothingly familiar as the compositions lull the viewer into Ada's world and mind.  This is as flawless as a film can be.  Do not reduce it to a mere love triangle between two men and a woman; at the film's core, the relationships explore issues much more intense and subliminal than that.If you've ever questioned your feelings but weren't sure why, this film may bring you closer to understanding your own complexities within you.  This film should be on everyone's top 10 list.

It is a story set in some remote coastal hills of a very bleak eighteenth century New Zealand overrun by dense jungle, mud, the elements and crude natives. Ada (Holly Hunter) and her young mischievously meddlesome daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) arrive on the New Zealand beach to meet Stewart (Sam Neill) whom has arranged to marry Ada. Ada, as we discover in the prolog is a woman who has not spoken since she was 6 years old. She is not only mute but strangely introverted and repressed. A piano, which Ada has brought with her, is her only means of expression. The ex-seaman ex-whaler Baines (Harvey Keitel) is a rather crude looking character who becomes enchanted by Ada's piano, which has been left on the beach. He retrieves it, buys it and then has Ada barter for its return setting the conflict of personalities and their repressed feelings into motion. Ada's mute playing of the piano is juxtaposed by her piercing dark eyes focusing from her face shrouded in ever so pale white skin. Her looks are riveting and disturbing. The image of Paquin's face is unnerving. As the film progresses we see that the primary characters are truly misunderstood from what our initial impressions had ascertained them to be. This is an exceptional film that you have to watch and listen to closely because of its very subtle nature that envelops your senses. The characters and the actors that portray them are brilliantly presented. Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is equally important because the images on the screen take on a life and spirit of their own in this haunting film.",5,If Looks Could Kill,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,1675,"['PIANO', 'very', 'unusual', 'enigmatic', 'haunting', 'film', 'say', 'anything', 'less', 'would', 'be', 'incredulous', 'story', 'set', 'remote', 'coastal', 'hills', 'very', 'bleak', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'New', 'Zealand', 'overrun', 'dense', 'jungle', 'mud', 'elements', 'crude', 'natives', 'Ada', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'young', 'mischievously', 'meddlesome', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'arrive', 'New', 'Zealand', 'beach', 'meet', 'Stewart', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'whom', 'arranged', 'marry', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'discover', 'prolog', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'spoken', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'only', 'mute', 'strangely', 'introverted', 'repressed', 'piano', 'Ada', 'brought', 'only', 'means', 'expression', 'ex-seaman', 'ex-whaler', 'Baines', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'rather', 'crude', 'looking', 'character', 'who', 'enchanted', 'Ada', 'piano', 'been', 'left', 'beach', 'then', 'Ada', 'barter', 'return', 'setting', 'conflict', 'personalities', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'motion', 'Ada', 'mute', 'playing', 'piano', 'juxtaposed', 'piercing', 'dark', 'eyes', 'focusing', 'face', 'shrouded', 'ever', 'so', 'pale', 'white', 'skin', 'looks', 'are', 'riveting', 'disturbing', 'image', 'Paquin', 'face', 'unnerving', 'film', 'see', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'truly', 'misunderstood', 'what', 'initial', 'impressions', 'had', 'ascertained', 'be', 'exceptional', 'film', 'have', 'watch', 'listen', 'closely', 'very', 'subtle', 'nature', 'senses', 'characters', 'actors', 'portray', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'presented', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'cinematography', 'equally', 'important', 'images', 'screen', 'take', 'life', 'spirit', 'own', 'haunting', 'film']",N/A

As previously stated, the visual aspect of the film is mesmerizing and amazing: it's a great experience.  What gives this film it's strength is its visual expressiveness: meanings are shown through movements, gestures, expression, and of course, music, not words.I did not know of the feminist controversy surrounding this film before I saw it, but now that I know about it it still doesn't affect the way I see this film.  I don't think the point of the film is to make one see her as a strong or weak woman for choosing to do the things she does in her relationships with her husband and his neighbor George, but to see that her will is in control at all times.  She does what she wants; all the choices she makes are the choices SHE made.  As long as that continues to be true, she is still in control of her life, and that makes her a strong character.Performances are strong as well, especially Anna Paquin's character.

Married from a distance by her family to an unknown man, she finds he is absolutely negative about the piano, her piano, that will stay on the beach. But a neighbor will get the piano, let her play, though his attraction and interest is obviously sexual. She will yield to his desire because the piano, the music are bridges between them. This will lead to a drama, a mutilation, a separation, an elopement, the drowning of the piano, the near drowning of the woman, and a better future in spite of a prosthesis to compensate for the mutilation. She has met the man she loves and that love came from her music and her piano. As such the film is rather naive and simple. What makes it a great film is that it is situated in New Zealand, though the woman's family is English. Two other levels of characterization of the husband intervene in this situation. First his gross and unrespectful treatment of the local population, the Maoris. He more or less exploits them, he does not try to speak their language, he does not try to have any contact with them, except when he needs them to work for him. The second element is his conception of his farm : he does not take into account the local resistance at his opening some land for his farm because that land is an ancient and traditional burying area for the local population. He refuses to take that into account and he does what he wants, and only what he wants. In other words he is a born dominator and has not heard of the ecocultural dimension of life : it is true he lives at the beginning of the colonization of New Zealand and his attitude is that of a colonial settler. And moreover he is unable to cope with his wife, to understand her desire and need of her piano, and then to make himself be desired and loved, even in spite of her attempts. It is this slow and precise description of the main characters of the film and their relations to the local population that makes the film interesting, not to speak of the acting which is excellent, and has to be so in those constantly refrained and dominated feelings that are at stake.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Love is a mysterious music,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2361,"['film', 'how', 'music', 'can', 'become', 'strongest', 'side', 'personality', 'when', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'keys', 'piano', 'music', 'live', 'be', 'harmony', 'world', 'particularly', 'daughter', 'Married', 'distance', 'family', 'unknown', 'man', 'absolutely', 'negative', 'piano', 'piano', 'will', 'stay', 'beach', 'neighbor', 'will', 'get', 'piano', 'let', 'play', 'attraction', 'interest', 'obviously', 'sexual', 'will', 'yield', 'desire', 'piano', 'music', 'are', 'bridges', 'will', 'lead', 'drama', 'mutilation', 'separation', 'elopement', 'drowning', 'piano', 'near', 'drowning', 'woman', 'better', 'future', 'spite', 'prosthesis', 'compensate', 'mutilation', 'met', 'man', 'love', 'came', 'music', 'piano', 'such', 'film', 'rather', 'naive', 'simple', 'What', 'great', 'film', 'situated', 'New', 'Zealand', 'woman', 'family', 'English', 'Two', 'other', 'levels', 'characterization', 'husband', 'intervene', 'situation', 'First', 'gross', 'unrespectful', 'treatment', 'local', 'population', 'Maoris', 'more', 'less', 'not', 'try', 'speak', 'language', 'not', 'try', 'have', 'contact', 'when', 'work', 'second', 'element', 'conception', 'farm', 'not', 'take', 'account', 'local', 'resistance', 'opening', 'land', 'farm', 'land', 'ancient', 'traditional', 'burying', 'area', 'local', 'population', 'take', 'account', 'what', 'only', 'what', 'other', 'words', 'born', 'dominator', 'not', 'heard', 'ecocultural', 'dimension', 'life', 'true', 'beginning', 'colonization', 'New', 'Zealand', 'attitude', 'colonial', 'settler', 'moreover', 'unable', 'cope', 'wife', 'understand', 'desire', 'need', 'piano', 'then', 'make', 'be', 'desired', 'loved', 'even', 'spite', 'attempts', 'slow', 'precise', 'description', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'relations', 'local', 'population', 'film', 'interesting', 'not', 'speak', 'acting', 'excellent', 'be', 'so', 'constantly', 'refrained', 'dominated', 'feelings', 'are', 'stake.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Despite it's obvious popular success, it's hard to see what's so great about it. This film from self proclaimed feminist director Jane Campion seems to hammer home the point that men are beasts- yeah, what else is new? For some that may be a valid point but in this film, none of the male characters seem to reveal any redeeming qualities, reducing them to cardboard villains whereas our heroine, despite leading on Harvey Keitell at one point, appears to remain free from any approbation.

Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx""","[112, 122]","Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" does what many truly great films do:  It inspires fascinating discussion and provokes mixed reactions.  The male friend with whom I saw it back in 1993 and I were so enthralled that we kept our significant others waiting to leave for our respective Christmas vacations because we kept phoning each other to discuss symbolism and interesting themes in the movie.  While I continue to absolutely love the film, I also recognize why some viewers have not shared my reaction.  Perhaps you have to have at least considered a forbidden love affair or perhaps you have to have found yourself trapped in a relationship where you feel you have lost your voice to appreciate what Campion explores.The story centers around Ada (Holly Hunter in an Oscar-winning performance) and her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin--who also won an Oscar for her extraordinary performance).  They leave their upper-class home in Scotland after Ada's father (apparently) arranges her marriage.  Ada, who has willed herself not to speak since age 6, expresses herself through her beloved piano.The true story of who fathered Flora is never revealed in the movie, but the context suggests that she is Ada's illegimate child born from an illicit affair.  The hinted-at story of Flora's conception provides a key to understanding both why Ada later begins an affair with her New Zealand neighbor Baines (Harvey Keitel) and why she makes a mail-order marriage in the first place.  I suspect that Ada's aging father may have wanted to see her settled--preferably far away so that her unconventional behavior would no longer be a source of social embarassment--and given Ada's muteness and out-of-wedlock child, her father probably couldn't find a suitable suitor in mid-Victorian Scotland.Stewart (Sam Neill) first encounters his future wife on a lonesome gray beach surrounded by her crated belongings.  His Maori porters begin carrying many household items up the muddy path to his dreary homestead.  But Stewart refuses to bring the piano along, despite Ada's apparent distress and Flora's pleas that her mother MUST have her piano.Ada's piano, abandoned on the barren New Zealand beach, captures the sense of what 19th century colonial life might have been like for too many women--treasured possessions, the last ties to ""civilization"" left behind.Rendered voiceless without her piano, Ada begs Stewart to return for her instrument through notes and more pleas from Flora.  Finally she persuades Baines--a colonist whose tattoed face evidences the extent to which he has ""gone native"" and who is considered less civilized by his neighbors--to guide her back to the beach.  Ada comes to life again as she, at last, gets to play.  Drawn by her passion for the piano, Baines arranges with Stewart to trade land for the piano.  Without consulting his wife, Stewart assures him that Ada will provide lessons too.During first of these lessons, Ada strikes her own bargain with Baines, whom she still considers a boor:  She will trade sexual favors to earn back her piano, one key at a time.  Ultimately, her reluctant bargain grows into full-blown love and passion.  The dark, brooding tone of ""The Piano,"" however, suggests that something in this situation will go tragically, and probably violently, wrong.Campion has filled her movie with haunting piano music (actually played by Hunter) and intriguing imagery.  The metaphor of piano as voice and losing and regaining one's voice, Flora's role in changing her mother's fate, the question of whether Ada's bargain reflects a woman taking control of her life or just being victimized in a different way, and many other complexities make this a movie worth watching again and again and again.",5,Exquisite erotic classic,1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,3730,"['Jane', 'Campion', 'Piano', 'what', 'many', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'do', 'fascinating', 'discussion', 'provokes', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'male', 'friend', 'whom', 'saw', 'back', '1993', 'were', 'so', 'enthralled', 'kept', 'significant', 'others', 'waiting', 'leave', 'respective', 'Christmas', 'vacations', 'kept', 'phoning', 'other', 'discuss', 'symbolism', 'interesting', 'themes', 'movie', 'continue', 'absolutely', 'love', 'film', 'also', 'recognize', 'why', 'viewers', 'have', 'not', 'shared', 'reaction', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'have', 'least', 'considered', 'forbidden', 'love', 'affair', 'perhaps', 'have', 'have', 'found', 'trapped', 'relationship', 'where', 'feel', 'have', 'lost', 'voice', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Campion', 'story', 'centers', 'Ada', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'leave', 'upper-class', 'home', 'Scotland', 'Ada', 'father', 'apparently', 'marriage', 'Ada', 'who', 'willed', 'not', 'speak', 'age', '6', 'beloved', 'piano.The', 'true', 'story', 'who', 'fathered', 'Flora', 'never', 'revealed', 'movie', 'context', 'Ada', 'illegimate', 'child', 'born', 'illicit', 'affair', 'hinted-at', 'story', 'Flora', 'conception', 'key', 'understanding', 'why', 'Ada', 'later', 'affair', 'New', 'Zealand', 'neighbor', 'Baines', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'why', 'mail-order', 'marriage', 'first', 'place', 'suspect', 'Ada', 'aging', 'father', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'settled', 'preferably', 'far', 'away', 'unconventional', 'behavior', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'source', 'social', 'embarassment', 'given', 'Ada', 'muteness', 'out-of-wedlock', 'child', 'father', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'suitable', 'suitor', 'mid-Victorian', 'Scotland.Stewart', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'first', 'future', 'wife', 'lonesome', 'gray', 'beach', 'surrounded', 'crated', 'belongings', 'Maori', 'porters', 'begin', 'carrying', 'many', 'household', 'items', 'up', 'muddy', 'path', 'dreary', 'homestead', 'Stewart', 'bring', 'piano', 'Ada', 'apparent', 'distress', 'Flora', 'pleas', 'mother', 'MUST', 'have', 'piano.Ada', 'piano', 'abandoned', 'barren', 'New', 'Zealand', 'beach', 'sense', 'what', '19th', 'century', 'colonial', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'women', 'treasured', 'possessions', 'last', 'ties', 'civilization', 'left', 'behind.Rendered', 'voiceless', 'piano', 'Ada', 'Stewart', 'return', 'instrument', 'notes', 'more', 'pleas', 'Flora', 'Finally', 'Baines', 'colonist', 'tattoed', 'face', 'extent', 'gone', 'native', 'who', 'considered', 'less', 'civilized', 'neighbors', 'guide', 'back', 'beach', 'Ada', 'life', 'again', 'last', 'play', 'Drawn', 'passion', 'piano', 'Baines', 'Stewart', 'trade', 'land', 'piano', 'consulting', 'wife', 'Stewart', 'Ada', 'will', 'provide', 'lessons', 'too.During', 'first', 'lessons', 'Ada', 'own', 'bargain', 'Baines', 'whom', 'still', 'boor', 'will', 'trade', 'sexual', 'favors', 'earn', 'back', 'piano', 'one', 'key', 'time', 'Ultimately', 'reluctant', 'bargain', 'grows', 'full-blown', 'love', 'passion', 'dark', 'brooding', 'tone', 'Piano', 'however', 'something', 'situation', 'will', 'go', 'tragically', 'probably', 'violently', 'wrong.Campion', 'filled', 'movie', 'haunting', 'piano', 'music', 'actually', 'played', 'Hunter', 'intriguing', 'imagery', 'metaphor', 'piano', 'voice', 'losing', 'regaining', 'one', 'voice', 'Flora', 'role', 'changing', 'mother', 'fate', 'question', 'Ada', 'bargain', 'woman', 'taking', 'control', 'life', 'just', 'being', 'victimized', 'different', 'way', 'many', 'other', 'complexities', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Holly Hunter plays a mute mail-to-order bride who, along with her daughter(played by young Anna Paquin), travels to New Zealand to meet her new husband Stewart, played by Sam Neill.  Her one love is her Piano, but she must leave it behind, for it was to heavy to get to her new house.  Later Stewart trades the piano for some land to a man nearby Baines, played by Harvey Keitel.  Ada is to give him lessons.  At first she detests the idea, as she has everything since she moves to the island.  But Baines makes her an offer that she can't refuse; she can get her beloved piano back. It is then that we watch Ada's soul awaken as she spends time with Baines.  Her daughter Flora is like her best friend, but Flora will innocently betray her mother, which will lead to a dramatic climax.Even though Holly Hunter few lines are voice-overs, this is her finest performance ever, winning her the Best Actress Oscar for 1993.  Anna Paquin also takes an Oscar for Best Suporting Actress.  The film also won an Oscar for Jane Campion's screen play, and was nominated for Best Picture of the year as well as several others.  Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel were equally impressive for their roles as well.  Michael Nyman's music is beautiful with its lovely saxophone melodies and a piano theme song that Hunter actually plays.It is perfect in many ways and is a movie that should be in everyones well-rounded and complete video library.

74805,A1H6IVVF68QYC7,0784011176,prospero72,"[0, 0]","REVIEW: Set in the stark, muddy, yet beautiful backdrop of New Zealand: Jane Campion's award winning ""THE PIANO"" is a most unusual love story that revolves around newcomer Ada (a willfully mute woman played by Holly Hunter), her daughter Flora (Paquin), Ada's husband by a pre-arranged marriage (Neill), and their mysterious neighbor Baines (Keitel) who has been initiated into the Maori tribe. Centering around these four characters is Ada's piano which comes to represent many different things: for Ada it is her refuge, and the extension of her own fierce individuality; for Flora it is a common bond the links her to her mother's own closed-off world; for Ada's husband, Stewart, it becomes an instrument that mocks his efforts in trying to win Ada's heart; and for Baines it becomes a tool to pierce through Ada's seemingly impenetrable fortress of self while re-awakening in her the desire to love and the passion to embrace life again. The central theme of the film is sex which is used by the director in order to contrast the more conservative/civilized manner of Stewart and his ilk with the wild/unorthodox Maori native traditions which Baines is a part of. It is this unbridled sexual passion that drives Baines to bargain with Stewart for Ada's piano, and then to strike a deal with Ada that is totally unexpected and which leads to a shocking conclusion. ""THE PIANO"" is not a film for everyone's taste. Campion's idea of using sex in order to ""jolt"" Ada out of her self-imposed exile is an interesting psychological twist; but the scenes of full-frontal nudity were really unnecessary and may keep some viewers from wanting to see the film. But regardless of the ""controversial"" aspects of the story: ""THE PIANO"" remains a completely original, gorgeously filmed work that is brought to life by a first-rate cast; and  a musical score by Michael Nyman that is absolutely haunting in every sense of the word. HARSH LANGUAGE: about 17 words. VIOLENCE: about 5 scenes. NUDITY/SEXUAL REFERENCES: about 11 scenes including full-frontal male and female nudity and simulated sex.CONTENT RATING: Although a great film from a humanistic/psychological viewpoint: the fact remains that ""THE PIANO"" has some very shocking scenes of nudity and raw, simulated sex. And even though the passion between Ada's character and Baines is shown to be more than just lust: the line between adult drama and mild pornography becomes very thin when Campion let's the camera roll on their romantic escapades together. Add to that the realization that Ada IS committing adultery (regardless of the fact that her marriage to Stewart has been pre-arranged), and you've got a morally ambiguous stew that should cause a few headaches for the Christian believer. If Campion had edited out the more extraneous moments of nudity and simulated sex then at least Christians could deal with the story itself on a more emotional level. But with Keitel's character walking around nude, bumping-and-grinding, and slurping away: it's safe to say that most Spirit-filled believers will be turning their heads during the more explicit scenes (unless they can catch an edited version of it on T.V.). But because of the film's sexual content, nudity, a bit of violence, and some harsh language: it should earn an OBJECTIONABLE rating.ACADEMY AWARDS: Best Actress (Holly Hunter), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), Best Original Screenplay (Jane Campion)ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Director (Jane Campion), Best Cinematography (Stuart Dryburgh), Best Editing (Veronika Jenet), Best Costume Design (Janet Patterson)GOLDEN GLOBES: Best Actress (Holly Hunter)GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Director (Jane Campion), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), Best Original Score (Michael Nyman), Best Screenplay (Jane Campion)",4,THE PIANO (MIRAMAX FILMS/1993),1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,3820,"['REVIEW', 'Set', 'stark', 'muddy', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'award', 'winning', 'PIANO', 'most', 'unusual', 'love', 'story', 'newcomer', 'Ada', 'willfully', 'mute', 'woman', 'played', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'Paquin', 'Ada', 'husband', 'pre-arranged', 'marriage', 'Neill', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'Baines', 'Keitel', 'who', 'been', 'initiated', 'Maori', 'tribe', 'Centering', 'four', 'characters', 'Ada', 'piano', 'represent', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'Ada', 'refuge', 'extension', 'own', 'fierce', 'individuality', 'Flora', 'common', 'bond', 'links', 'mother', 'own', 'closed-off', 'world', 'Ada', 'husband', 'Stewart', 'instrument', 'efforts', 'trying', 'win', 'Ada', 'heart', 'Baines', 'tool', 'pierce', 'Ada', 'seemingly', 'impenetrable', 'fortress', 'self', 're-awakening', 'desire', 'love', 'passion', 'embrace', 'life', 'again', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'sex', 'used', 'director', 'order', 'contrast', 'more', 'conservative/civilized', 'manner', 'Stewart', 'ilk', 'wild/unorthodox', 'Maori', 'native', 'traditions', 'Baines', 'part', 'unbridled', 'sexual', 'passion', 'Baines', 'bargain', 'Stewart', 'Ada', 'piano', 'then', 'strike', 'deal', 'Ada', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'PIANO', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Campion', 'idea', 'using', 'sex', 'order', 'jolt', 'Ada', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'twist', 'scenes', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'were', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'may', 'keep', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'see', 'film', 'regardless', 'controversial', 'aspects', 'story', 'PIANO', 'completely', 'original', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'work', 'brought', 'life', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'musical', 'score', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'absolutely', 'haunting', 'sense', 'word', 'HARSH', 'LANGUAGE', 'about', '17', 'words', 'VIOLENCE', 'about', '5', 'scenes', 'NUDITY/SEXUAL', 'REFERENCES', 'about', '11', 'scenes', 'including', 'full-frontal', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sex.CONTENT', 'RATING', 'great', 'film', 'humanistic/psychological', 'viewpoint', 'fact', 'PIANO', 'very', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'raw', 'simulated', 'sex', 'even', 'passion', 'Ada', 'character', 'Baines', 'shown', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'lust', 'line', 'adult', 'drama', 'mild', 'pornography', 'very', 'thin', 'when', 'Campion', 'let', 'camera', 'roll', 'romantic', 'escapades', 'together', 'Add', 'realization', 'Ada', 'IS', 'committing', 'adultery', 'regardless', 'fact', 'marriage', 'Stewart', 'been', 'pre-arranged', ""'ve"", 'got', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'stew', 'should', 'cause', 'few', 'headaches', 'Christian', 'believer', 'Campion', 'had', 'edited', 'out', 'more', 'extraneous', 'moments', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sex', 'then', 'least', 'Christians', 'could', 'deal', 'story', 'more', 'emotional', 'level', 'Keitel', 'character', 'walking', 'around', 'nude', 'bumping-and-grinding', 'slurping', 'away', 'safe', 'say', 'most', 'Spirit-filled', 'believers', 'will', 'be', 'turning', 'heads', 'more', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'can', 'catch', 'edited', 'version', 'T.V.', 'film', 'sexual', 'content', 'nudity', 'bit', 'violence', 'harsh', 'language', 'should', 'earn', 'OBJECTIONABLE', 'rating.ACADEMY', 'AWARDS', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'ACADEMY', 'AWARD', 'NOMINATIONS', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'Best', 'Editing', 'Veronika', 'Jenet', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Janet', 'Patterson', 'GOLDEN', 'GLOBES', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'GOLDEN', 'GLOBE', 'NOMINATIONS', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Jane', 'Campion']",N/A
74806,A23520L46PEF90,0784011176,RBarber,"[8, 10]","A film of circumstance and deeply held passions. A passion for music and her piano is what keeps a mute woman sane and music is how she expresses herself. The story is also about passion between man and woman and love that becomes overwhelming and all consuming. Jane Campion wrote, ( Academy Award for Best Screenplay), and directed, (nominated for Best Director), this fine film which was nominated for Best Picture. Holly Hunter gives a moving, Academy Award winning Best Actress performance as Ada, the mute pianist whose father has arranged for her to marry a man from the remote New Zealand wilderness that she has never met. Sam Neill plays the man who is to be her new husband. Harvey Keitel is the neighbor who becomes obsessed with Ada and the very young Anna Paquin, (Best Supporting Actress), plays Ada's daughter. The outstanding performances are what make this movie. I imagine with another cast this could have been a dud. Holly Hunter conveys every emotion and angst without saying a word. Anna Paquin was simply amazing, her performance was flawless. Harvey Keitel did a spot on Scottish accent with a strong, passionate performance. The synopsis states that the husband is callous, I disagree. He cares for Ada and wants them to have a loving relationship, but he doesn't know how to achieve that. He is intimidated by her muteness and yet can't express his own feelings in words or actions. Sam Neill gives a strong performance as the suffering husband. The stunning cinematography completes the package for this truly amazing film. One more comment, the movie is rated R for ""moments of extremely graphic sexuality."" This is not true, ""extremely graphic sexuality"" makes it sound like a porno which this movie certainly is not! There is nudity, but there isn't any graphic anything.

The acting is very good, with each of the three main characters (Holly, Sam and Harvey) really creating their character.Holly hunter plays a young woman who is mute since she was 6 for no known reason.  Her husband has just died as the movie starts.  Her family arranges her marriage to the character played by Sam Neill who lives in New Zealand.  So she leaves England for New Zealand with her 8 year old daughter and her most prized possession, a piano.Sam Neill is basically an OK guy who has no idea of how to develop a relationship with Holly and proceeds to do everything wrong right from the start.  It is totally obvious to anyone paying any attention that the piano is very important to Holly.  But the situation is rather primative and Sam has brought Maori along as porters for her luggage.  They leave the piano sitting on the beach, without even carrying it to where the surf does not swirl around the legs and Sam will not even promise to come back for it later.  Then right after they get to their new home, Sam leaves for a while to take care of some of his business.After a little while in the house where she lives, Holly gets Harvey Keitel to take her back to the beach and she spends the day playing the piano.  Harvey watches her and immediately figures out that the key to Holly is her piano.  When they get back, Harvey trades Sam land for the piano and then gets ""piano lessens"" from Holly, so he can try to seduce her, which he eventually does.  The best part of the movie is seeing Holly's her beautiful body.What made the movie hard to watch was Sam really wants to be close to Holly, but does everything wrong.  If he had payed any attention to what was important to her, she would have most likely fallen in love with him, which is what he really wants.  Then, after he has screwed it all up by first completely ignoring how important the piano was to Holly and then trading it to Harvey without her permission, he becomes jealous and vindictive when he finds out she has fallen for Harvey.At that point he should have just traded her to Harvey (he never has consumated their arrange marriage) for what he really seems to care the most about; more land.  Then he could arrange for another bride from England and hopefully learn from his last mistake.  But of course, that is not what he does do.There are a few scenes that are tough to watch, but at least the movie ends reasonably well.",3,It holds your interest,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2502,"['ways', 'was', 'tough', 'movie', 'watch', 'definitely', 'interest', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Holly', 'Sam', 'Harvey', 'really', 'creating', 'character.Holly', 'hunter', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'mute', 'was', '6', 'known', 'reason', 'husband', 'just', 'died', 'movie', 'family', 'marriage', 'character', 'played', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'who', 'New', 'Zealand', 'England', 'New', 'Zealand', '8', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'most', 'prized', 'possession', 'piano.Sam', 'Neill', 'basically', 'OK', 'guy', 'who', 'idea', 'how', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Holly', 'proceeds', 'do', 'everything', 'wrong', 'right', 'start', 'totally', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'piano', 'very', 'important', 'Holly', 'situation', 'rather', 'primative', 'Sam', 'brought', 'Maori', 'porters', 'luggage', 'leave', 'piano', 'sitting', 'beach', 'even', 'carrying', 'where', 'surf', 'not', 'swirl', 'legs', 'Sam', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'promise', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'Then', 'right', 'get', 'new', 'home', 'Sam', 'while', 'take', 'care', 'business.After', 'little', 'while', 'house', 'where', 'Holly', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'take', 'back', 'beach', 'day', 'playing', 'piano', 'Harvey', 'immediately', 'out', 'key', 'Holly', 'piano', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'Harvey', 'Sam', 'land', 'piano', 'then', 'piano', 'lessens', 'Holly', 'can', 'try', 'seduce', 'eventually', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Holly', 'beautiful', 'made', 'movie', 'hard', 'watch', 'was', 'Sam', 'really', 'be', 'close', 'Holly', 'everything', 'wrong', 'had', 'payed', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'fallen', 'love', 'what', 'really', 'Then', 'screwed', 'up', 'first', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'how', 'important', 'piano', 'was', 'Holly', 'then', 'trading', 'Harvey', 'permission', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'when', 'out', 'fallen', 'Harvey.At', 'point', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'traded', 'Harvey', 'never', 'consumated', 'arrange', 'marriage', 'what', 'really', 'care', 'most', 'more', 'land', 'Then', 'could', 'arrange', 'bride', 'England', 'hopefully', 'learn', 'last', 'mistake', 'course', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'tough', 'watch', 'least', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'well']",N/A

Her film (literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights') explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship...In one scene Ada, with tears of anger, hits Baines hard across the face, as if she has spoken words of love... With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remain locked together, the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed... Only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts...No woman artist had approached sex in such a direct and liberating manner... Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure... Ada moving his head to her chest, and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin...Nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film tells the story of Ada, a strong willful 19th-century Scotswoman who hasn't spoken, since she was six years old... Ada has been set up in an arranged marriage to a British emigrant in New Zealand...The film opens with Ada who is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen to meet her husband Stewart, a landowner who is without much emotion or real love... Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs... On her head a black bonnet... Around her neck her pad and pen...Campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style... Ada is not any easy role and Holly Hunter plays her without vanity... Her face is alight with facial expression, sometimes tender, sometimes sad, sometimes humorous, sometimes soft, while her hands and fingers are quick and neat...Ada speaks through sign-language translated by her young daughter Flora, and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression... She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys... But in the way she eyes the illiterate, uncultured Baines, there is an insolence and lack of respect... We watch her stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck...Harvey Kietel plays the lonely neighbor George Baines, a depressive man who is everything Stewart is not... He has never seen a graceful woman behave with so much abandon... Ada moves to the piano... She wants to touch it, but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it... Baines views Ada totally absorbed in her piano music... He seems satisfied to watch... He finds himself edging irresistibly closer, magnetically drawn to the spectacle...Baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face... Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply... He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust... He feels powerless... He is desperate and romantic... He no longer admires her absorption with the piano... He is jealous of it... His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano... Ada's long white neck proves irresistible... Baines comes across the room, kisses her, and asks: 'Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back.'Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever... She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather... She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped suddenly... She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut... Her venture is one of challenge and curiosity... Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress...Sam Neill plays the intense, moralistic and very-Victorian husband Alistair Stewart, who never understands his woman's nature... He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut, he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing, and undressing... He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again...Jane Campion creates an unusual film, poetic and lyrical, complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods, which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes...",4,"A break with the tragic, the Gothic and the sentimental...",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,4879,"['Director-screenwriter', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'started', 'movies', 'early', '1980s', 'Australian', 'School', 'Film', 'Television', 'clearly', 'emerged', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'become', 'one', 'world', 'premiere', 'female', 'directors', 'Campion', 'films', 'typically', 'have', 'treacherous', 'terrain', 'searing', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'recognize', 'ourselves', 'ways', 'characters', 'think', 'behave', 'work', 'break', 'tragic', 'Gothic', 'sentimental', 'exquisite', 'film', 'won', 'three', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'one', 'Campion', 'screenplay', 'not', 'sex', 'passion', 'Jane', 'viewer', 'many', 'levels', 'film', 'literary', 'inspired', ""'Wuthering"", 'Heights', 'new', 'territory', 'delicious', 'handling', 'female', 'sexuality', 'pleasure', 'ecstasy', 'loving', 'relationship', 'one', 'scene', 'Ada', 'tears', 'anger', 'Baines', 'hard', 'face', 'spoken', 'words', 'love', 'new', 'breath', 'moment', 'eyes', 'remain', 'locked', 'together', 'promise', 'intimacy', 'confirmed', 'reconfirmed', 'detailed', 'Only', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'guide', 'instincts', 'No', 'woman', 'artist', 'had', 'approached', 'sex', 'such', 'direct', 'liberating', 'manner', 'Campion', 'scenes', 'Baines', 'face', 'crumpling', 'exquisite', 'pain', 'pleasure', 'Ada', 'moving', 'head', 'chest', 'Baines', 'struggling', 'dress', 'anxious', 'touch', 'skin', 'Nominated', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'film', 'story', 'Ada', 'strong', 'willful', '19th-century', 'Scotswoman', 'who', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'Ada', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'British', 'emigrant', 'New', 'Zealand', 'film', 'Ada', 'who', 'carried', 'shore', 'shoulders', 'five', 'seamen', 'meet', 'husband', 'Stewart', 'landowner', 'who', 'much', 'emotion', 'real', 'love', 'large', 'Victorian', 'skirt', 'spreads', 'men', 'arms', 'backs', 'head', 'black', 'bonnet', 'neck', 'pad', 'pen', 'Campion', 'chose', 'cast', 'suit', 'purpose', 'style', 'Ada', 'not', 'easy', 'role', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'vanity', 'face', 'alight', 'facial', 'expression', 'sometimes', 'tender', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'sometimes', 'soft', 'hands', 'fingers', 'are', 'quick', 'neat', 'Ada', 'sign-language', 'translated', 'young', 'daughter', 'Flora', 'beloved', 'piano', 'be', 'prime', 'source', 'expression', 'great', 'delight', 'feeling', 'fingers', 'piano', 'keys', 'way', 'eyes', 'illiterate', 'uncultured', 'Baines', 'insolence', 'lack', 'respect', 'watch', 'stopping', 'abruptly', 'indignantly', 'neck', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'lonely', 'neighbor', 'George', 'Baines', 'depressive', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'Stewart', 'not', 'never', 'seen', 'graceful', 'woman', 'behave', 'so', 'much', 'abandon', 'Ada', 'piano', 'touch', 'torn', 'feelings', 'wanting', 'not', 'owning', 'views', 'Ada', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'piano', 'music', 'satisfied', 'watch', 'edging', 'irresistibly', 'closer', 'magnetically', 'drawn', 'spectacle', 'Baines', 'fingers', 'moving', 'keys', 'small', 'details', 'motion', 'face', 'Twice', 'eyes', 'breathes', 'deeply', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'sense', 'appreciation', 'lust', 'powerless', 'desperate', 'romantic', 'no', 'longer', 'absorption', 'piano', 'jealous', 'attention', 'finally', 'neck', 'further', 'closer', 'piano', 'Ada', 'long', 'white', 'neck', 'proves', 'irresistible', 'Baines', 'room', 'asks', ""'Do"", 'know', 'how', 'bargain', 'nod', 'do', 'way', 'can', 'have', 'piano', 'back', ""'Anna"", 'Paquin', 'been', 'proclaimed', 'one', 'best', 'child', 'acting', 'roles', 'ever', 'subtle', 'complex', 'performance', 'very', 'cute', 'little', 'girl', 'torn', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'house', 'suddenly', 'aware', 'piano', 'playing', 'stopped', 'suddenly', 'mystery', 'peeping', 'various', 'cracks', 'holes', 'loosely', 'built', 'hut', 'venture', 'one', 'challenge', 'curiosity', 'complex', 'portrayal', 'Flora', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'intense', 'moralistic', 'very-Victorian', 'husband', 'Alistair', 'Stewart', 'who', 'never', 'woman', 'nature', 'surveys', 'Baines', 'hut', 'suspiciously', 'are', 'sounds', 'are', 'worrying', 'wondering', 'hut', 'hole', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'lovers', 'kissing', 'undressing', 'back', 'angry', 'just', 'might', 'expect', 'burst', 'up', 'look', 'again', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'unusual', 'film', 'poetic', 'lyrical', 'complimented', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'haunting', 'woods', 'many', 'critics', 'been', 'named', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'female', 'director', 'win', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes']",N/A

Moore,"[2, 4]","People seem to either love or hate this film, which is understandable because it wants to be approached on an emotional level more than an intellectual one. My boyfriend complained that none of the characters were compelling enough to care about, whereas I could see that the central character is, indeed, the piano and how everything revolves around its voice -- Ada's voice. Listening to her voice, being moved by it, is the key to the entire film.One of the several engaging themes is that of who is on center stage at any given time. Count the number of times someone is watching someone else: Baines watching Ada play her piano on the beach, actors in a play looking through curtain eyeholes at the audience, the natives in the audience watching the play and believing the actors to be &quot;real&quot;, Stewart looking through gaps in the planks to see his wife with another man, Flora watching Stewart attempt to destroy his wife's voice. (Interestingly, this is an assault not on the piano itself but on something more fundamental. And those who believe that Ada's gift of the piano key to Baines is a major faux pas perhaps don't realize that he will know exactly what that white key means though he can't read the words burned into it.)The disturbing moments, and there are several, are entirely about the piano's (Ada's) voice and how these men attempt to either restrict or manipulate it to get what they want -- one endangering her sense of self while simultaneously using and liberating her, the other denying her self-expression while trying to be her protector and &quot;a good man&quot;.It's a very fine movie for those of a mind to listen.",5,Disturbing and brilliant,987465600,"04 17, 2001",2001,1657,"['People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'understandable', 'be', 'approached', 'emotional', 'level', 'more', 'intellectual', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'complained', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'compelling', 'enough', 'care', 'whereas', 'could', 'see', 'central', 'character', 'indeed', 'piano', 'how', 'everything', 'around', 'voice', 'Ada', 'voice', 'Listening', 'voice', 'being', 'moved', 'key', 'entire', 'film.One', 'several', 'engaging', 'themes', 'who', 'center', 'stage', 'given', 'time', 'Count', 'number', 'times', 'someone', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'Baines', 'watching', 'Ada', 'play', 'piano', 'beach', 'actors', 'play', 'looking', 'curtain', 'eyeholes', 'audience', 'natives', 'audience', 'watching', 'play', 'believing', 'actors', 'be', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Stewart', 'looking', 'gaps', 'planks', 'see', 'wife', 'man', 'Flora', 'watching', 'Stewart', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'wife', 'voice', 'Interestingly', 'assault', 'not', 'piano', 'something', 'more', 'fundamental', 'who', 'believe', 'Ada', 'gift', 'piano', 'key', 'Baines', 'major', 'faux', 'pas', 'perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'will', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'white', 'key', 'means', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'words', 'burned', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'are', 'several', 'are', 'entirely', 'piano', 'Ada', 'voice', 'how', 'men', 'attempt', 'restrict', 'manipulate', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'one', 'endangering', 'sense', 'self', 'simultaneously', 'using', 'liberating', 'other', 'denying', 'self-expression', 'trying', 'be', 'protector', 'quot', 'good', 'man', 'quot', '.It', 'very', 'fine', 'movie', 'mind', 'listen']",N/A

The usual fare is the interactions between two urbanites with huge polished smiles stuck to their faces.  They enter a relationship which is loud, giddy, and giggly.In The Piano, the woman doesn't speak at all and both men are stoic sorts who have lived in a hard land.  A lot happens under the surface where we can only guess at it.  In mainstream films, the emphasis for the man is rushing in and grabbing the woman of his dreams with all possible speed.But here, just once, the quiet, patient, and tender man emerges with the lady.  And what's more, when we first see him, we fail to see through his hard exterior.  Even the viewer comes to know this man's virtue only over time.I found this to be an incredibly beautiful story and as if that alone wasn't good enough, I also greatly enjoyed the cinematography and the music.  This is one of those films that I find guilty of being incredibly good on all counts.And a final note about male nudity:  Yes it is in this film.  Both male and female are seen completely nude.  And there's nothing wrong with the male part.  We men have beautiful bodies too.  Art of the past has had no compunctions about showing nude males and correctly so.

On the other hand, the actual story and acting in this movie would have earned it two or two and a half points, at best. The story is a little disjointed in places, trying to break itself into segments dotted with scenes with characters I never really understood or got involved in (the tribe, the sisters and eccentric uncle figure).My true grievance lies with the main characters themselves, and the awkward dialogue and behavior they have been written to convey. Our main character doesn't exactly inspire any compassion, care or interest, as she behaves like a spoiled and arrogant looney at times, who has little to no concern for her daughter when things aren't going the way she wants them to. It's difficult to place the point when she decides she's feeling love or attraction, as almost all of her voiceless expressions are inundated with contempt or disdain. The young daughter is probably the most authentic and well-acted of all of the characters.The scenes meant to horrify and stun the viewer are almost more bizarre than anything else. And the ending of the movie was anti-climatic and stunted. To be completely honest, I find it hard to be impressed by the artistic and symbolic nature of a film when the acting is so flat, and the story so emotionally unreal. I would not purchase or watch this movie again, and I do not agree with the 3.5 out of 4.0 stars that my cable company rated it.

Supposedly Harvey Keitel becomes the object of Holly Hunter's adoration because he treats her like a human being, unlike her husband.  But there is  no chemistry whatsoever between the two of them, and there is nothing said  or done which would cause a normal viewer to identify with the romantic  element.  Furthermore, everyone is so busy orgasming over how  &quot;artistic&quot; the movie is, that they have ignored the biggest  single plot blunder I have ever seen in four decades of movie-going.  The  pivotal scene of the entire movie comes when the husband throws a tantrum  because of a letter exchanged between his wife and Keitel.  The problem  with that is that when Keitel is first introduced, we are told that he  can't read.  Nothing in the subsequent &quot;action&quot; gives any  indication that he has learned to read in the interim, or that the original  information that he can't read was inaccurate.All those issues aside,  the movie is simply unpleasant from start to finish, in almost every way a  movie can be unpleasant.  The backdrop of the movie is a rainforest of  grey, sticky mud.  The director seems to have a fetish for the process of  female urination.

So Ada's father probably  thought he was doing her an enormous favor to get her married to a  prosperous farmer in New Zealand.  Sam Neill plays the farmer who probably  does love Ada a bit, but who seems more concerned that he has been bilked  in a deal when she did not return his ardor.  Keitel is brilliant, as  always, as Baines, the European who has &quot;gone native&quot; and now  feels his own ethnic roots calling to him for apparently the first time in  years.  Paquin shows promise of great things to come as the  daughter-turned-vengeful brat when her mother actually dares to show  intense feelings for anyone other than her offspring.In the end this is  a tale of the redemption of the human spirit as Ada (Hunter) learns to love  and trust a man again (albeit not her own husband), her husband finally  learns the difference between family and property, and Baines finds his  longings fulfilled  through his ability to sacrifice satisfaction of his  own needs for the safety and happiness of the woman he loves.Fine  performances by all involved, including the supporting cast of transplanted  UK eccentrics who give just the right comic touch to a very weighty  story.A triumph of a film, the ending of which is slightly Chaucrian  when Baines learns that the best way to have your way with a woman is to  let her have her way first.Well done, Campion!

An immature concept.`The Piano' pounds its story conceits very thin (and theyaren't meaty to begin with).  What Sam Peckinpah's films are toadolescent male machismo, Campion's 'The Piano' is toadolescent female angst.Great acting?  To be sure.  Great cinematography?  Yes.Great script?  Ehhh.The stereotypes in this film are worse than horrendous.They're positively nave.Holly Hunter's character (or Overblown Feminist Archetype#1, the Oppressed But Divine Female) bristles.  Boy, does shebristle.  She bristles under the oppression of patriarchalsociety.  She bristles devoid of personal and financialfreedom.  But mostly she bristles in the clutches of a rich andcultured but insensitive mama's boy (or Overblown FeministArchetype #2, the Soulless, Impotent Wimp).  Eventually shefinds refuge from her bristling in no less a place than theprimordial jungle, in the arms of a taciturn sex machine whoknows how to keep our lady in her sexual place without tramplingher freedoms (or Overblown Feminist Archetype #3, the BrutishBut Noble Savage).Oh, come on!Not that Holly Hunter doesn't bring all of her considerabletalents into play, but her character sinks this film.  The storyis centered around her, which is sort of like centering yourrefrigerator around a spoiled hunk of Limburger.For starters, how about this?  She's so oppressed she'slost her voice.She can only express herself through her piano.Forgetting for the moment the clatter in our ears (theoverwhelming racket of heavy, thematic gears grinding away),just on a personal level, what a self-involved wimp!  Read yourAusten, your James, or your Wharton.  Their put-upon lady leadsare *actual* heroines.

Why? Because everything else about the film is exceptional on every level -- the beautiful dense forest cinematography of New Zealand's North Island, the realism of the Maori and the 1850's colony, the beautiful piano score, the great acting, etc.THE PLOT: A mute Scottish woman, Ada (Holly Hunter), and her daughter (Anna Paquin) go to a New Zealand plantation to meet her husband, Stewart (Sam Neill), an arranged marriage. Ada is slowly seduced by a gruff worker on the plantation, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), as she gives him piano lessons.The story is Exhibit A on why arranged marriages aren't a good idea. After all, how can you be ""one flesh"" with someone for the rest of your life if you don't even like him/her or find him/her attractive? This is an adult historical drama with inoffensive, but overt nudity and adult themes, like control, sexual repression, sexual growth and the search for true love. Even though this is essentially a girlie romance movie and I find elements of the drama dreadfully boring -- like Stewart's final confrontation with Baines (where you can barely make out the dialogue) -- the film makes up for it in every other department.
