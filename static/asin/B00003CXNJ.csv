529848,ANYRXHDVOVS17,B00003CXNJ,A. Customer,"[0, 0]","This was a highly entertaining film, but a flawed one as well.  For the most part, all of the pairings in the film, or duets, successfully make the point that we all need someone to help us find our true selves (or some such cliche): the rogue father and ditzy daughter; the hooker with the heart of gold (yes, we recognize that thinly disguised stereotype) and the too-good priestly cab driver; Mr. White Suburb and the Black (doomed to die) ex-con.  The strong points of the film are its humor, its music, and its life affirming message.  There are a few weaknesses, too, most of which have been pointed out in preceeding reviews.  The one that distracted me the most was the wasting of Andre Braugher's great acting talent.  He and his over-the-top partner stole every scene they were in.  They were a delight to watch, and they were helping each other to find that true self, or whatever--then Braugher takes the blame for a crime (a murder, I assume) that Mr. White Suburb has committed and is killed by the police, and suddenly the bells are going off in my head.  Wait a minute.  Why is this great actor, the only African American in the film, playing the part of an ex-con (though to his credit he did play it beautifullY)?  How many times have we seen Hollywood put a suave, well-spoken black man in THAT role?  Did you see this man in GLORY?  Did you see him in CITY OF ANGELS?  This man can REALLY act.And why is he making this trite, cliched, illogical, supposedly noble, self-sacrificing gesture?  Because Mr. Suburb taught him how to drive a car?  I think not.As an African American, on principle alone, I should give the film a single, wretched star.  But the thing was so much fun to watch, that this slap in the face is only just a bit upsetting.",4,Only a Bit Upsetting,993168000,"06 22, 2001",2001,1763,"['was', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'flawed', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'pairings', 'film', 'duets', 'successfully', 'make', 'point', 'need', 'someone', 'help', 'find', 'true', 'selves', 'such', 'cliche', 'rogue', 'father', 'ditzy', 'daughter', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'yes', 'recognize', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'stereotype', 'too-good', 'priestly', 'driver', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Suburb', 'Black', 'doomed', 'die', 'ex-con', 'strong', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'humor', 'music', 'life', 'affirming', 'message', 'are', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'too', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'preceeding', 'reviews', 'one', 'distracted', 'most', 'was', 'wasting', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'over-the-top', 'partner', 'stole', 'scene', 'were', 'were', 'delight', 'watch', 'were', 'helping', 'other', 'find', 'true', 'self', 'then', 'Braugher', 'blame', 'crime', 'murder', 'assume', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Suburb', 'committed', 'killed', 'police', 'suddenly', 'bells', 'are', 'going', 'off', 'head', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Why', 'great', 'actor', 'only', 'African', 'American', 'film', 'playing', 'part', 'ex-con', 'credit', 'did', 'play', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'suave', 'well-spoken', 'black', 'man', 'role', 'Did', 'see', 'man', 'GLORY', 'Did', 'see', 'CITY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'man', 'can', 'REALLY', 'act.And', 'why', 'making', 'trite', 'cliched', 'illogical', 'supposedly', 'noble', 'self-sacrificing', 'gesture', 'Mr', 'Suburb', 'taught', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'think', 'African', 'American', 'principle', 'alone', 'should', 'give', 'film', 'single', 'wretched', 'star', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'slap', 'face', 'only', 'just', 'bit', 'upsetting']",N/A
529849,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B00003CXNJ,Alice L. Moore,"[0, 0]","I watched ""Duets"" from Encore on demand.  This is a quirky film about people who compete for cash on the Karaoke circuit.  There are three main K teams in this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis a father/daughter team, Paul Giamatti and Andre Braugher; a burned out salesman and escaped convict, Maria Bello and Scott Spellman; a part time hooker and cab driver, all converge at a Karaoke contest in Omaha, Nebraska.Many reviewers are correct about having to suspend disbelief.  In the opening scene Huey Lewis out Cockers Joe Cocker and hustles $690 to boot.  We're are asked to accept Gwyneth Paltrow as Huey Lewis' daughter.  Paul Giammatti belts out an acceptable ""Hello It's Me"" in his first Karaoke outing.  So why did I like this?  The unexpected happens.We have the scene of a dangerous hitchhiker in the middle of nowhere seeming more sane than the driver.  A salesman, played by Giamatti, comes home his wife, she rebuffs him and Giamatti mentions that he has to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes.  Scott Spellman, playing a cab driver, is picking up his childhood teacher from the police station.  The teacher then berates him as an underachiever.  She's dressed in her bathrobe and has been charged with shoplifting BTW.  When she is dropped off he mentions that he isn't an underachiever, that he's working on harmony.I like Paul Giamatti in any movie.  He has played such a diversity of roles from President John AdamsJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)to an English teacher/wine aficionado in SidewaysSideways (Widescreen Edition).  Huey Lewis also showed that he can act as well as sing.  Gwyneth Paltrow is less believable as an ingenue and daughter of Huey Lewis.  There just doesn't seem to be that big of an age gap to be father/daughter.  Angie Dickinson also does a great star turn as Gwyneth Paltrow's grandmother.  Maria Bello did a good turn as the Emerson quoting hooker.I know this is a movie.  However, couldn't they have at least one of the characters just think they could sing like Otis Redding but, in actuality sound like the everyday Karaoke singers with which we've had experience?There are so many odd moments I thought of such Altman type films as Gosford ParkGosford Park, and Cookie's FortuneCookie's Fortune.

I had heard the Gwyneth Paltrow/Huey Lewis duet ""Crusin'"" on the radio and tracked down the movie. It did not get much press, I don't think.  I found it very enjoyable, and in watching the extras on the DVD, discovered that all the actors did their own singing with the exception of Andre Braugher.  He and the character he pairs up with have the most memorable scenes in my opinion.  Braugher is an excellent actor.  When I tell people this movie is about karyoke they never want to see it. If I can convince them to watch it anyway, they are always glad they did. It is not really about karyoke anyway, it is about relationships, using karyoke as a backdrop.

(No, I've never heard &quot;Freebird&quot; song like that, either.)But the plot is all over the map, and is implausible at times, shockingly so in some cases (I'm not sure the scene in the gas station can be glossed over the way it was at the end).

Someone didn't tie it all together, instead writing melodramatic speeches for underdeveloped characters.  What began as a good idea, with good music and a lively pace, gets messy.  The writers and director should have pared back the contrivances of how the very mixmatched characters came together to let them develop more honestly, and then they should have indulged in some irony to temper those scenes that come across as unintentionally absurd.  They should have cast Kevin Spacey in Huey Lewis's role (though he was better than I expected), and someone more like Kate Hudson in the role of his daughter.

529870,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00003CXNJ,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[7, 16]","The origins of this movie are rather simple: Gwyneth Paltrow's producer father Bruce Paltrow went out and called up favors owed him from everyone he knew in Hollywood to get his little girl the Best Actress Oscar that always eluded his more talented wife (and Gwyneth's mother), Blythe Danner.  So, as payback to daddy for greasing the palms of every has-been and old-timer in the Academy, Gwyneth starred in this strange movie that I am sure has even someone of her average Hollywood talent cringing with embarrassment when she recalls it.Basically, the film starts out with Huey Lewis (erstwhile jazzy rocker from the 1980s) starring as Ricky, a karaoke singer who is down on his luck (sort of like the real Huey Lewis).  There's a great full-frontal nudity gratuitous scene though, to let you know he's a ladies' man.  That one 15-second scene has the most entertainment value in the whole movie, as it was rather titillating.Next we go to Huey meeting Gwyneth (Liv), and instantly the chemistry (oil and water, sorry) begins.  Angie Dickinson is pulled out of mothballs for a cameo appearance to give Huey the made-for-TV stock speech ""you'd better take care of my little girl, and not blow it like you usually do.""  Then, it's back to yesteryear oblivion for Angie.  This is important, because it establishes a sotto voce plot point that Huey and Liv have this ""past"" together, and a sottissimo voce point that it's a romantic past.The subplot of this movie revolves around Todd (Paul Giamatti, who played Howard Stern's boss in ""Private Parts"") actually a good actor, who must need the work, since he's sort of homely, but can actually act (most of the plum roles these days go to good-looking actors who can't act, like Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise or Kevin Costner).  Anyhow, he finds out all of the sudden that his yuppie suburban life has been a lie and a sham, so he hits the road  in order to become a karaoke singer.  Although a rehash of every hackneyed plot from ""Shoot the Moon"" to ""American Beauty,"" this one seems more plausible since the pitiful dialogue that comes out of Giamatti's mouth qualifies him for no other work.  Another good actor, Andre Braugher, plays a black con on the lamb (Reggie) that befriends Giamatti. This supplies the movie with a lot of great ""buddies on the run"" scenes right out of the tradition of Robert Urich/Lorenzo Lamas school of TV cop dramas.There's also a subplot revolving around a really cute couple that you forget instantly.  But, gosh, they're so cute, with that ""aw shucks"" quality that's right out of the best Elia Kazan and Tennessee Williams........oh, I'm sorry, I meant right out of the best Michael Landon and Sherwood Schwartz scripts.Anyways, these subplots twist, revolve, meander and basically run out of steam until they conspire to locate -- surprise! -- all these karaoke singing drifters at this splendiferous karaoke championship.  The suspense is notched up to full-tension here, and this is when all the threads of the plot come together. The cute couple almost misses their big break, but gets to sing just in the nick of time; you also find out that Huey and Gwyneth are -- surprise again! -- father and daughter. ""Oh my God,"" you think to yourself, ""what a pervert I must be for thinking that they were lovers,"" just like the movie was implying all along.  Then you suddenly remember that Bruce Paltrow wrote and directed this, and you're scratching your head even more. Hmmmmm. Nonetheless, you would have never guessed that Huey was Gwyneth's father, since he has this nice richness and raspiness to his voice, and her flat performance of ""Bette Davis Eyes"" makes Kim Carnes' breathy alto sound like Maria Callas.However, Giamatti and Braugher's final tune bring the movie crashing -- literally -- to a climax.  Having hidden behind their karaoke alter egos the entire length of the movie, the police finally get wise to the pair.  Knowing the cops are closing in, Reggie belts out a convincing ""Freebird,"" which is the last song you'd ever expect a black guy to sing, since it was by Lynyrd Skynyrd, authors of the Dixiecrat anthem ""Sweet Home Alabama.""  After the last notes resound hauntingly throughout the hotel lounge, Braugher pulls out a gun, and kills himself, a beautiful and touching tribute to Leoncavallo's opera ""I Pagliacci,"" though I'm sure most of the parties involved -- the intended audience, the screenwriters and Bruce Paltrow -- would never know it.I gave this movie two stars instead of one, based on the pearls-before-swine performances of Giamatti and Braugher, and also because ""Duets"" makes for a great party drinking game: Predict the lame plot; count the bad made-for-TV stock phrases; drink a shot every time someone sings off-key.

That's right on the money in my view.

By now you've heard ""Cruisin'"" on the radio and you know this, but it's still kind of amazing to see. You can sort of hear that that's really Maria Bello; you know Huey Lewis can sing; you figure Paul Giamatti can sing because they could always get a bland-looking guy from Broadway who can really sing, so why dub it; and Andre Braugher isn't really singing.

529880,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXNJ,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This film was directed by Bruce Paltrow, and while it certainly has its minuses, it also has its pluses. At the center of the film is karaoke. It is this performing art form that is the nucleus of all that happens in this film. It is the glue that holds it together. It is at the heart of what propels three divergent pairs of people to occupy the same space at the same time.The film centers around six people, who end up pairing off in unusual combinations and traveling the karaoke circuit. At the inception of this film, all these people, even those who ultimately pair up, are strangers to each other. All three pairs travel their own route to get to Omaha, the location for the big daddy of all karaoke competitions, in order to compete in the karaoke finals for a grand prize of five thousand dollars. En route to and while in Omaha, they all discover a number of things about themselves and each other.One unlikely pair consists of Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti) and Reggie Kane (Andre Braugher). Todd is a salesman who is fed up with his job and tired of being ignored by his wife and children. He decides that he is mad as hell and is not going to take it any more. So, he basically runs away from home. He stumbles into a bar, takes up the challenge to sing karaoke, and, voila, a star is born. While driving aimlessly, he runs into hitchhiker Reggie Kane, a man who has gone to prison for exercising bad judgment and is packing a semi-automatic pistol. He and the now nutty Todd form an unlikely friendship.The second unlikely pair consists of Billy (Scott Speedman) and Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello). Billy is a young, straight-laced cab driver, a former seminarian, who has just had his world rocked when he discovers that his girl friend has been two timing him with his business partner. Wallowing in his misery, he runs into Suzi Loomis who promises to gratify him sexually if he drives her to California. She is an aspiring karaoke singer who does the karaoke circuit for the money. Unfortunately, she also does any men who might have something she needs.The third unlikely pair consists of a father and daughter team. Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis), is a small time hustler who can sing, so he hustles at karaoke bars. He goes to Vegas when he hears than an old girlfriend has died, and discovers that he has a daughter, Liv (Gwyneth Paltrow), after an almost incestuous welcome. Ricky doesn't want to be a daddy at this stage of the game, but Liv wants to have a father in the worst way. So, she follows him, and they end up hustling together at a karaoke bar, as she, too, can sing.The one really disturbing thing about this Disney film is that once again Hollywood's inherent racism rears up its ugly head by casting the only African-American in the film in the role of the convict. I am sure the Disney studio was pleased with itself to be including a token African-American in the film in the first place. Why couldn't it think out of the box, however, and have one of the other characters be African-American? Shame on Disney for choosing, instead, to propagate an unflattering stereotype.Still, this is definitely an odd, quirky movie about the wacky world of competitive karaoke singing and the denizens who inhabit that world. The performances in this film are excellent, overall, and the singing is terrific, although the ending is a bit of a stretch. It is not, however, a film for everyone. It is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy unusual, offbeat films.",4,KARAOKE DREAMS,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,3479,"['film', 'was', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'Paltrow', 'certainly', 'minuses', 'also', 'pluses', 'center', 'film', 'karaoke', 'performing', 'art', 'form', 'nucleus', 'film', 'glue', 'together', 'heart', 'what', 'propels', 'three', 'divergent', 'pairs', 'people', 'occupy', 'same', 'space', 'same', 'time.The', 'film', 'centers', 'six', 'people', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'pairing', 'off', 'unusual', 'combinations', 'traveling', 'karaoke', 'circuit', 'inception', 'film', 'people', 'even', 'who', 'ultimately', 'pair', 'up', 'are', 'strangers', 'other', 'three', 'pairs', 'travel', 'own', 'route', 'get', 'Omaha', 'location', 'big', 'daddy', 'karaoke', 'competitions', 'order', 'compete', 'karaoke', 'finals', 'grand', 'prize', 'five', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'En', 'route', 'Omaha', 'discover', 'number', 'things', 'other.One', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'Todd', 'Woods', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Reggie', 'Kane', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Todd', 'salesman', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'job', 'tired', 'being', 'ignored', 'wife', 'children', 'mad', 'hell', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'more', 'So', 'basically', 'away', 'home', 'bar', 'up', 'challenge', 'sing', 'karaoke', 'voila', 'star', 'born', 'driving', 'aimlessly', 'hitchhiker', 'Reggie', 'Kane', 'man', 'who', 'gone', 'prison', 'exercising', 'bad', 'judgment', 'packing', 'semi-automatic', 'pistol', 'now', 'nutty', 'Todd', 'form', 'unlikely', 'friendship.The', 'second', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'Billy', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Suzi', 'Loomis', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Billy', 'young', 'straight-laced', 'cab', 'driver', 'former', 'seminarian', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'world', 'rocked', 'when', 'girl', 'friend', 'been', 'two', 'timing', 'business', 'partner', 'Wallowing', 'misery', 'Suzi', 'Loomis', 'who', 'gratify', 'sexually', 'California', 'aspiring', 'karaoke', 'singer', 'who', 'karaoke', 'circuit', 'money', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'men', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'needs.The', 'third', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'father', 'daughter', 'team', 'Ricky', 'Dean', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'small', 'time', 'hustler', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'karaoke', 'bars', 'Vegas', 'when', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'discovers', 'daughter', 'Liv', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'almost', 'incestuous', 'welcome', 'Ricky', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'daddy', 'stage', 'game', 'Liv', 'have', 'father', 'worst', 'way', 'So', 'end', 'up', 'hustling', 'together', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'too', 'can', 'sing.The', 'one', 'really', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'Disney', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'inherent', 'racism', 'up', 'ugly', 'head', 'casting', 'only', 'African-American', 'film', 'role', 'convict', 'am', 'sure', 'Disney', 'studio', 'was', 'pleased', 'be', 'including', 'token', 'African-American', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'box', 'however', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'be', 'African-American', 'Shame', 'Disney', 'choosing', 'instead', 'propagate', 'unflattering', 'stereotype.Still', 'definitely', 'odd', 'quirky', 'movie', 'wacky', 'world', 'competitive', 'karaoke', 'singing', 'denizens', 'who', 'inhabit', 'world', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'overall', 'singing', 'terrific', 'ending', 'bit', 'stretch', 'not', 'however', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'enjoy', 'unusual', 'offbeat', 'films']",N/A

It was off-the-cuff, well observed and beautifully acted - and left you feeling good by the time it reached its quirky musical ending. A great little film, I included it on Amazon lists of 'recommended watches' in the hope that movie lovers would notice.I also remember noticing the astonishing lead performance by this new gawky looking dude called PAUL GIAMATTI. What an actor! Giamatti has of course since gone on to greatness in so many roles (see my review for ""Barney's Version"" for starters) - to a point where he's developed that Phillip Seymour Hoffman/Robert Downey Jr., status - you'd watch a movie just because he's in it.Strangled by his home life and working a sales job that takes him across the country checking into dull hotel after hotel - Todd Woods (Giamatti) longs for more. So one day after he's gotten home and no one's really noticed he's even in the house - Todd goes out for a packet of cigarettes - and well - he never goes back. On his drive to 'wherever man' square hick white man Todd picks up a cool-as-a-cucumber black hitchhiker called Reggie Kane (a subtly cast Andre Braugher) who may or may not be a dangerous man with a gun whose on the run from the police. But unhinged Todd doesn't care - he's too ramped up on the high of being free and driving wherever he wants to. But then the unlikely duo make a stop late at night in some small bar and step up the Karaoke stage on a drunken whim - and during a rendition of an Otis Redding track (title above) - Todd and Reggie discover they have singing voices between them that ain't that half bad. They also discover the rush of life...In the meantime professional singer and slick hustler Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis of Huey Lewis and the News) is working the same circuit suckering mouthy jerks at bars for bets. But he then meets with his estranged daughter Liv (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) - who it turns out can sing too - but more than that - Liv wants her aimless lounge lizard of a Dad back. But responsibility has never been Ricky's thing. And on it goes to everybody growing up a little and embracing the chaos that is commitment...Like Giamatti and Braugher, Lewis and Paltrow make an unlikely pair - but the chemistry `so' works. Gwyneth Paltrow's acting chops are long proved and admired (see my review for ""Shakespeare In Love"") - but she surprised everyone in ""Duets"" by putting in a more than passable singing performance (something she later reprised in the underrated ""Country Strong""). And as for Huey Lewis - wow! You forget what a God given growl he has - and the man can act too.Other threads in the film are Mario Bello and Scott Speedman as another unlikely couple - Hollywood legend Angie Dickinson has a short spell - and all of it culminates in the Karaoke US Championships in Omaha that carries with it a juicy prize-wining purse of $5000 (Michael Buble cameos as one of the finalist singers).Foreign buyers should also note that the US BLU RAY is 'all regions' - so will play on all players. The picture quality is a big improvement over the US DVD I've had for years (which does require a multi-region player) and its 1.85:1 aspect ratio means its fits your full screen (no bars top or bottom). There are no bonus features unfortunately which seriously lets the side down (except a trailer), Subtitles are in English only and the Audio is English 5.1/Spanish 2.0.To sum up - directed by Gwyneth's dad Bruce Paltrow, ""Duets"" is a little gem you should get to know - and at less that six dollars/six euros/four quid for the BLU RAY - it's literally going for a song...",5,"""Try A Little Tenderness...""",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3697,"['***', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'THE', '2012', 'BLU', 'RAY', '***I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Duets', '2000', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'loving', 'pieces', 'was', 'off-the-cuff', 'well', 'observed', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'left', 'feeling', 'good', 'time', 'reached', 'quirky', 'musical', 'ending', 'great', 'little', 'film', 'included', 'Amazon', 'lists', ""'recommended"", 'watches', 'hope', 'movie', 'lovers', 'would', 'notice.I', 'also', 'remember', 'noticing', 'astonishing', 'lead', 'performance', 'new', 'gawky', 'looking', 'dude', 'called', 'PAUL', 'GIAMATTI', 'What', 'actor', 'Giamatti', 'course', 'gone', 'greatness', 'so', 'many', 'roles', 'see', 'review', 'Barney', 'Version', 'starters', 'point', 'where', 'developed', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman/Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'status', ""'d"", 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'it.Strangled', 'home', 'life', 'working', 'sales', 'job', 'country', 'checking', 'dull', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'Todd', 'Woods', 'Giamatti', 'more', 'So', 'one', 'day', 'gotten', 'home', 'one', 'really', 'noticed', 'even', 'house', 'Todd', 'out', 'packet', 'cigarettes', 'well', 'never', 'back', 'drive', ""'wherever"", 'man', 'square', 'hick', 'white', 'man', 'Todd', 'up', 'cool-as-a-cucumber', 'black', 'hitchhiker', 'called', 'Reggie', 'Kane', 'subtly', 'cast', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'dangerous', 'man', 'gun', 'run', 'police', 'unhinged', 'Todd', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'ramped', 'up', 'high', 'being', 'free', 'driving', 'wherever', 'then', 'unlikely', 'duo', 'make', 'stop', 'late', 'night', 'small', 'bar', 'step', 'up', 'Karaoke', 'stage', 'drunken', 'whim', 'rendition', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'track', 'title', 'Todd', 'Reggie', 'discover', 'have', 'singing', 'voices', 'ai', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'also', 'discover', 'rush', 'life', 'meantime', 'professional', 'singer', 'slick', 'hustler', 'Ricky', 'Dean', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'News', 'working', 'same', 'circuit', 'suckering', 'mouthy', 'jerks', 'bars', 'bets', 'then', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Liv', 'played', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'out', 'can', 'sing', 'too', 'more', 'Liv', 'aimless', 'lounge', 'lizard', 'Dad', 'back', 'responsibility', 'never', 'been', 'Ricky', 'thing', 'everybody', 'growing', 'up', 'little', 'embracing', 'chaos', 'commitment', 'Giamatti', 'Braugher', 'Lewis', 'Paltrow', 'make', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'chemistry', 'so', 'works', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'acting', 'chops', 'are', 'long', 'proved', 'admired', 'see', 'review', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'Duets', 'putting', 'more', 'passable', 'singing', 'performance', 'something', 'later', 'reprised', 'underrated', 'Country', 'Strong', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'wow', 'forget', 'what', 'God', 'given', 'growl', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'too.Other', 'threads', 'film', 'are', 'Mario', 'Bello', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'short', 'spell', 'Karaoke', 'US', 'Championships', 'Omaha', 'juicy', 'prize-wining', 'purse', '5000', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'cameos', 'one', 'finalist', 'singers', '.Foreign', 'buyers', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'US', 'BLU', 'RAY', ""'all"", 'regions', 'so', 'will', 'play', 'players', 'picture', 'quality', 'big', 'improvement', 'US', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'had', 'years', 'require', 'multi-region', 'player', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'fits', 'full', 'screen', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'are', 'bonus', 'unfortunately', 'seriously', 'side', 'down', 'trailer', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'only', 'Audio', 'English', '5.1/Spanish', '2.0.To', 'sum', 'up', 'directed', 'Gwyneth', 'dad', 'Bruce', 'Paltrow', 'Duets', 'little', 'gem', 'should', 'get', 'know', 'less', 'six', 'dollars/six', 'euros/four', 'quid', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'literally', 'going', 'song']",N/A

Most people in my circle never heard of it, but when they see it, enjoy the heck out of it.  What makes it great is (1) the singing and (2) the amazing assemblage of acting talent, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti, Maria Bello.  And Huey Lewis isn't bad, either.The biggest flaws are Gwyneth's gangly, toothy, goody-two-shoes character; the contrived father-daughter conflict scenes between her and Huey; and his obligatory character change at the end, so they can sing the final duet together.But who cares?  The singing will absolutely blow you away.  Gwyneth and Maria do their own, and they are fabulous, especially Gwyneth.  What a set of pipes!  She's the daughter of Blythe Danner, and inherited her vocal ability.  (As far as a ""who knew she could sing?"" revelation, her performance rates right up there with Michelle Pfeiffer's in ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"".)I'm not sure if Paul Giamatti did his own singing, but it sounds like him.  Even if he's overdubbed by someone else, his singing performances are wonderful.  The ""Try a Little Tenderness"" duet with him and Andre Braugher (dubbed) is to die for.Get the DVD so you can watch the bonus features.

529894,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXNJ,Reviewer,"[11, 12]","Director Bruce Paltrow assembled an impressive ensemble cast to deliver this story about a diverse group of people with many things in common-- more than they would probably ever realize or admit to, in fact.  On the surface, the tie that binds is music; specifically that cultural phenomenon known as Karaoke, a world in which for three minutes or so, no matter who or what they are, the individual at stage center is a star.  Underneath that particular aspect, however, the common thread runs much deeper.  Because these are people who, in their own way, are all seeking to connect with something, even though they don't know what it is or even consciously know they're pursuing it.  They're looking for their personal metaphor-- that one special thing, or someone, that will give meaning and purpose to their life.  It's a road we all go down at one time or another, in one way or another, and it's that road that is explored by Paltrow in ""Duets,"" an affecting film that illustrates how universally elusive the answers we're all seeking in life are, and for the most part because we simply don't know the questions in the first place.Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis) is a singer/hustler on the Karaoke circuit; In Tulsa, on his way to a big competition in Omaha, he gets a call and detours through Las Vegas for the funeral of an old friend.  While he's there, he meets up with someone with whom he has a special relationship, Liv (Gwyneth Paltrow), who decides she wants to join him on the road.  Meanwhile, a salesman named Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti) suddenly realizes he's so burned out from being on the road that he doesn't even know what city he's in, making a pitch to a hotel conference room full of corporate types in Houston, thinking all the while he's actually in Orlando, Florida.  When he finally gets home, his wife, Candy (Kiersten Warren), and his two kids are too self-absorbed to even say hello to him, so he goes out for a pack of cigarettes (even though he doesn't smoke), discovers Karaoke and makes a new friend, Reggie Kane (Andre Braugher).  Then there's Billy (Scott Speedman), a young man who drives a cab (of which he is half owner), who due to a particular set of circumstances finds himself involved with one Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello), who is on her way to California, by way of the karaoke competition in Omaha.  And, ultimately, Karaoke becomes the vehicle through which this eclectic bunch of individuals begin to discover just what it is they're looking for; and who among them ever would've thought it would be in Omaha, Nebraska?Working from an intricate and insightful screenplay by John Byrum, Paltrow has crafted an engrossing comedy/drama that is entertaining and poignant.  There's a lot going on in this film, but Paltrow sets a pace that keeps it moving right along, and uses transitions that effectively eliminate any confusion that could easily have resulted from having so many storylines unfolding at once.  The characters are well drawn, and Paltrow establishes exactly who they are and where they fit in almost as soon as they are introduced, which enables the viewer to concentrate on the story without having to figure out who fits where and why.  After all, this is not a mystery; and Paltrow uses the screen time of his characters wisely to develop the drama that is being played out in their respective lives, rather than by throwing in unnecessary twists and turns just to maintain interest.  It works, because the story is interesting enough, without the aid of any superficial enhancements, and Paltrow does an excellent job of blending it all together to deliver a satisfying and emotionally involving film.There are a number of outstanding and noteworthy performances in this film, but the most memorable is turned in by Paul Giamatti, who so successfully conveys the emptiness of this middle-aged man who has always played by the rules, and who now finds himself at a very real crossroads in his life.  The fact that Todd has accrued 800,000 frequent flyer miles that he can't use, effectively puts his whole life into perspective; and Giamatti sells it with a portrayal that is affecting and incisive.  And, as Reggie, the guy Todd takes up with on the road, Braugher hits just the right note, as well, and their scenes together provide some of the highlights of the film, as when they perform their duet of ""Try A Little Tenderness""-- this is Karaoke at it's best.Gwyneth Paltrow provides a few highlights here, as well; besides creating a very real, believable character in Liv, it's worth watching the film just to see her sing ""Bette Davis Eyes.""  But there's also an exquisite gentleness in her nature she so ably expresses that makes her decidedly easy to watch, and there's an engaging duet she delivers with Huey Lewis on ""Cruisin'"" that's a real showstopper.  It's quite interesting, in fact, to note just how well the actors in this film deliver their songs (and, yes, they all did their own singing).  Other musical highlights include Braugher's ""Free Bird"" and Bello's rendition of ""Sweet Dreams.""  This entire film, in fact, just may be the best thing that ever happened to Karaoke; it definitely raises the bar and gives it some mainstream credibility.The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson (Blair), Lochlyn Munro (Ronny), Amanda Kravat (Redhead), Erika von Tagen (Julie) and Marian Seldes (Harriet).  Early in the film, a truck driver asks a hitchhiker-- a guy just out of prison-- ""What were you in for?""  The guy replies, ""An error in judgment.""  And, in the final analysis, that's what ""Duets"" is really all about; the flaws, imperfections and ""errors in judgment"" that make up the music of life.  It's about finding that right note and being able to share it with someone-- being able to perform a duet to the score of life.",5,Does Anyone Accept Frequent Flyer Miles?,1015200000,"03 4,

It might initially strike you as providing as flimsy a foundation for drama as Sylvester Stallone's movie about arm-wrestling. But this movie works. And unless you are a devotee of karaoke, it will probably also surprise you. It will make you aware that there's a whole subculture out there that, like the world of pool players, is filled with hustlers, fans, newbies who become addicts, and a host of other colorful characters.""Duets"" isn't perfect though. It generally adopts an up-beat tone as it follows the stories of a variety of people who all converge for the finale at a high-stakes karaoke contest. The individual stories tend to be as life-affirming as the interweaving stories in movies such as ""Grand Canyon."" However, some jarring elements seep through. And in fact, the bonus commentary reveals that this movie was adapted from a novel consisting of violent, surreal episodes. Some scenes with that slant were indeed shot, but the director wisely chose to relegate them to the ""Deleted Scenes"" pile. If they had been included, the whole movie would have been derailed into some nihilistic view of a world ruled by random acts of brutality. As it is, this original conception of the material is only hinted at in the mysterious truncation of certain scenes and in a few leaps in narrative logic.However, these minor flaws are more than compensated for by what became the overall arc of this movie. Most particularly, the chemistry between the players here is wonderful and universally redeeming. Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis as daughter and father have a real spark between them. Paul Giamatti as the escapee from suburbia and Andre Braugher as the hitchhiker he picks up similarly develop an unlikely, but very real rapport.Most of all though, this movie is about the music. Almost all the actors here did their own singing. Paul Giamatti reportedly protested that he couldn't sing at all and wanted to be dubbed.

529903,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXNJ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 6]","&quot;Duets&quot; is certainly a very likable film, and to watch its  stars singing makes me feel good, but wait a minute, don't you forget something?That is, everybody does karaoke for fun.  Remember, &quot;Duets&quot; is not the first movie that shows the Hollywood stars sing a karaoke song; Cameron Diaz sang twice in &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot; and &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; respectively and on both occasions we had a really tremendous fun to see her sing (very badly).  See, nobody wants to see a singer die on the stage, no matter how the script requires him to do so.In this respect, I mean fun, &quot;Duets&quot; takes the subject matter too seriously, and makes us wonder why they must find their meaning of life in such a way, repeatedly participating in karaoke contests.  All the cast sing very well, and Gwyneth Paltrow even amazed me with her singing voice, but they did not need to surprise us that way.  Poor singing is OK in karaoke as long as you have a good time, and that is what karaoke is all about.  And that is the reason Paul Giamatti &amp; Andre Braugher duet of &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot; moves our heart most.  They are having fun, and we know it.  But the rest of the film remains just another ordinary descriptions of characters.",2,Very Likable Movie Based on a Midguided Idea,1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,1286,"['quot', 'Duets', 'quot', 'certainly', 'very', 'likable', 'film', 'watch', 'stars', 'singing', 'feel', 'good', 'wait', 'minute', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'something', 'everybody', 'karaoke', 'fun', 'Remember', 'quot', 'Duets', 'quot', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'sing', 'karaoke', 'song', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'sang', 'twice', 'quot', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Life', 'Less', 'Ordinary', 'quot', 'respectively', 'occasions', 'had', 'really', 'tremendous', 'fun', 'see', 'sing', 'very', 'badly', 'See', 'nobody', 'see', 'singer', 'die', 'stage', 'matter', 'how', 'script', 'do', 'so.In', 'respect', 'mean', 'fun', 'quot', 'Duets', 'quot', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'why', 'must', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'such', 'way', 'repeatedly', 'participating', 'karaoke', 'contests', 'cast', 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'even', 'amazed', 'singing', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'surprise', 'way', 'Poor', 'singing', 'OK', 'karaoke', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'what', 'karaoke', 'reason', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'amp', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'duet', 'quot', 'Try', 'Little', 'Tenderness', 'quot', 'heart', 'most', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'know', 'rest', 'film', 'just', 'ordinary', 'descriptions', 'characters']",N/A
