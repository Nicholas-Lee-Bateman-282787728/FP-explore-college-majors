He has an extremely minimal role.Stanley Tucci (who is a much, much better actor and far more acclaimed) is amazing in the title role of Secondo. Minni Driver as his very American girlfriend is spritzy, ditzy and perfect in the role. Isabella Rosselini is a sultry seductress of unparalleled talents. Liev Shriver - Come on! Awesome! In other words - the cast is outstanding and the movie is delicious to watch.The pace is slow and subtle, but underneath there is a LOT of emotion roiling around. The dynamic between the two brothers Primo and Secondo (there are some imaginative parents for you) is fabulously depicted. The dynamic between the successful restauranteur Pascal (Ian Holm) and the desperate Secondo is incredibly well acted. The story rolls along in a deceptively slow pace, and then for the crescendo it really takes off. Overall this film is a complete gem.

5928,A20IIR0422G3A5,0767802535,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[7, 9]","`Big Night' is co-writer / co-director Stanley Tucci's contribution to the select collection of `food films'. The leading members of this very gourmet list of films is the Japanese `Tampopo' and the French `Babette's Feast'. If you look at it cross-eyed, you may even add Peter Greenway's `The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover'. `Tampopo' is hands down the most interesting of these, but `Big Night' can hold its own in this crowd of culinary celluloid.Like Siskel and Ebert, you will like this movie a lot if you like movies by Fellini and Renoir. I sensed more than a few little echos here and there of Fellini's `La Dolce Vita', although I confess Tucci simply does not have the great touch of the Fredrico Fellini / Marcello Mastroianni team. But that bar is so high, Tucci Company still manage to come in with a remarkable little film.For fans of some of the players in this film such as Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosselini, Tony Shalhoub, and `C. J. Craig', Allison Janney, you may be disappointed at the rather thin part each of these actors receives, although all but Miss West Wing carry their roles off with great skill. While on the surface the main drama seems to be between Tucci and Shalhoub, the two immigrant Italian brothers who own and run a small high quality restaurant in 1957 New Jersey, the best tension is between Tucci's character and Ian Holm (later to famously appear in the role of Bilbo Baggins in `Lord of the Rings'). Holm plays a competing restaurateur whose very successful establishment is just down the block from the brothers' weakly performing `Restorante'.The setup for understanding the difficulties the brothers face is what we see on a typically light night when a typical 1950's American woman is served a seafood risotto and simply cannot understand the dish, as she was expecting spaghetti with the rice and sees no seafood on the dish. This sets up the culinary interest to the foodies in the audience who are fully aware of the difference between classic Italian fare and the `Italian-American' cuisine being sold down the street at Holm's restaurant. Of course chef and older brother Shalhoub is totally unsympathetic to these uneducated tastes and balks at simply making a side dish of spaghetti to go along with the rice.This movie was made before 2001 and Shalhoub shows absolutely no trace of his Emmy award winning Adrian Monk persona. Behind his great Groucho mustache, one can almost not even recognize him, as even the quality of his voice seems changed to fit the part.The driving force behind the story is the fact that the bank will no longer extend the deadline on the loan for their restaurant, so the brothers need to come up with much more money than they currently take in over the course of a week. Holm offers the suggestion that part of the success of his restaurant lies in the interest he generates with celebrities who come to eat at his place and leave lots of autographed photographs behind. So, Holm suggests that he will attract Louie Prima to come to the brothers' restaurant to eat on a particular `Big Night'Preparation of the food for this event brings culinary interest back to the forefront when we see Shalhoub and his assistant hand make pasta which is then assembled into that most elaborate dish an `Il Timpano', a great upside down casserole filled with pasta, sauce, sausage, and all sorts of other good things to eat.A secondary plot is the relation of Tucci with girlfriend Minnie Driver complicated with an affair with Holm's wife, played by Isabella Rosselini. The end of the movie leaves many of these relationships in disarray, most especially the one between the brothers.It is totally proper that almost all the music is from recordings of performances by Louie Prima and wife Keely Smith. The feeling of being filmed in the mid-1950's is almost perfect except for the to me dreadful coloring which may work on `The Matrix' but which does not work on northern New Jersey. Everything looks red and green. The movie would have been much better served by having been filmed in black and white a la Woody Allen of `Manhatten' or in a lush 1950's Technicolor where the colors are more real than in real life.This is a great little movie with the one property that makes buying it on DVD worth while. It will yield additional pleasures on a second and third and fourth viewing, as long as you liked it to begin with.

The cast is rounded out with Ian Holm, Minnie Driver, and Isabella Rossellini.I deducted a star because the DVD is cheaply made.  There is no director's commentary, and no alternative sound set up.  My copy contains an insert that states that there are two English sound tracks, a Dolby surround sound and a 5.1 dolby digital.  Surround sound is the default, but to play back the 5.1, ""simply access the main menu, select Languages/audio setup, then select English 5.1 (dolby digital).""  Simple enough.  The only problem is that the main menu does not contain a ""select languages/audio setup"" option.  It simply doesn't exist.

5944,A1LACH6MLQWZ,0767802535,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","""Big Night"" is a hit on a number of levels. First of all, for anyone alive in the 1950s it will bring back fond memories, if for no other reason than that the automobiles prominently featured in the film run the whole gamut from the humble Chevy to the ostentatious Cadillac with tail fins. And for those familiar with the ethnic character of the north Jersey Shore (part of it was filmed in Keansburg), it will have a ring of authenticity.Second, the sight of genuine Italian food being prepared is enough to make anyone's mouth water. During the course of the movie we see both the process of preparation and the finished product. You can't watch this film without wanting to go right out and eat at an Italian restaurant. (But make sure it's a genuine one, and not an American restaurant that claims to be Italian; otherwise you will be sorely disappointed.)Then there's the movie itself. Although it begins a bit slowly, the action soon picks up. Its main theme is the brotherly bond that exists between two Italian immigrant brothers who have opened a restaurant that has great food but few customers. Although they seemingly disagree on everything throughout the movie and are both temperamental in the extreme, it is obvious that they truly love each other and would never live apart. The movie centers on the preparations for the ""big night"" when they have been assured by another restauranteur that a famous band will be dining at their restaurant. As it turns out, although the big night comes and there's a substantial crowd, the band never shows. However, the food is so overwhelming good that we get the sense that word will get around and the restaurant will succeed (although we are never shown this happening).Finally, not only is the acting outstanding, but so is the directing as well as the script itself. The last scene shows how much can be ""said"" through several minutes of almost complete silence. Moreover, not all the loose ends are specifically tied up, but we are given enough hints along the way to figure this out for ourselves.",5,"Excellent food, excellent movie",1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,2057,"['Big', 'Night', 'hit', 'number', 'levels', 'First', 'anyone', 'alive', '1950s', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'other', 'reason', 'automobiles', 'prominently', 'featured', 'film', 'run', 'whole', 'gamut', 'humble', 'Chevy', 'ostentatious', 'Cadillac', 'tail', 'fins', 'familiar', 'ethnic', 'character', 'north', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'part', 'was', 'filmed', 'Keansburg', 'will', 'have', 'ring', 'authenticity.Second', 'sight', 'genuine', 'Italian', 'food', 'being', 'prepared', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'mouth', 'water', 'course', 'movie', 'see', 'process', 'preparation', 'finished', 'product', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'wanting', 'go', 'right', 'out', 'eat', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'make', 'sure', 'genuine', 'one', 'not', 'American', 'restaurant', 'be', 'Italian', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Then', 'movie', 'bit', 'slowly', 'action', 'soon', 'up', 'main', 'theme', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'two', 'Italian', 'immigrant', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'opened', 'restaurant', 'great', 'food', 'few', 'customers', 'seemingly', 'disagree', 'everything', 'movie', 'are', 'temperamental', 'extreme', 'obvious', 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'would', 'never', 'live', 'apart', 'movie', 'centers', 'preparations', 'big', 'night', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'assured', 'restauranteur', 'famous', 'band', 'will', 'be', 'dining', 'restaurant', 'out', 'big', 'night', 'substantial', 'crowd', 'band', 'never', 'However', 'food', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'good', 'get', 'sense', 'word', 'will', 'get', 'around', 'restaurant', 'will', 'succeed', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'happening', '.Finally', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'so', 'directing', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'last', 'scene', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'several', 'minutes', 'almost', 'complete', 'silence', 'Moreover', 'not', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'specifically', 'tied', 'up', 'are', 'given', 'enough', 'hints', 'way', 'figure', 'out', 'ourselves']",N/A
5945,ADS5APY1NKTL4,0767802535,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 5]","BIG NIGHT is a great film and an equally great story, that really appeals to the senses.  For starters, we see great Italian food shots, during the ""big night"" (for which the film derives its title).  I am not much of an Italian food aficianado, but it makes me want to be!  Everything from the colorful appetizers, to the main course-what I would describe as a pasta cake, loaded with sausage, cheese and other filling ingredients, just fill your senses and you can just smell the basil, cheese and tomato sauce.  Secondly, the writing and what the actors do with that writing (thanks to great direction by Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott, as well as a great cast) is just beautiful.The plot is modelled on the hopes and dreams of many immigrants, arriving on the shores of 1950s United States, searching for a better life,  determined to achieve something bigger and better than what they could ever have accomplished, back home (there is a poignance to this theme, especially at this time, where that dream is more and more fleeting, as we are all being pulled into a state of paranoia and disdain, particularly toward foreigners).  Two brothers, Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Segundo (Stanley Tucci) own and operate a failing Italian restaurant.  Though, Primo is an amazing and dedicated chef, Segundo is the more wily and crafty younger brother, determined to cut a deal and make them successful.  When they get wind of an opportunity to bring in famous swing singer Louis Prima, to their restaurant, for one very big night, how can they pass up on this opportunity?  This could either make or break their reputation, as well as their bank account.BIG NIGHT is beautifully crafted, and another great actor (who we know better as a well-respected and very talented salsa star) featured here is Marc Anthony, in an understated role as their young, quiet and slightly bumbling waiter, at the restaurant. The women featured in this film are gorgeous, too.  Minnie Driver is stunningly beautiful, as Phyllis, Segundo's American girlfriend, and Isabella Rossellini plays the ""other woman.""  I don't want to divulge any more plot details.  I will say that this is a film that you really can't compare to other ""food movies,"" though many have anyway.

5948,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0767802535,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 5]","BIG NIGHT (Dir. Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci, Writ. Stanley Tucci, in English and Italian, 1996, 107 minutes) ~New Jersey Restaurateurs Secundo (Tucci) and his older brother Primo (Tony Shalhoub) run a fine restaurant serving wonderful Italian food. Set in the 1960s, Secundo seems a bit of a hot-tempered flibberty-gibbet while Primo is an obsessive-compulsive chef (sound familiar except for the chef part?) and their little restaurant is failing. One solution, a return to Italy, repulses Secundo. A plan is hatched to get singer Louie Prima into the restaurant and the table is set, so to speak.I will not spoil anything more, but this is a delightful, hilarious jewel of a film that somehow didn't seem to do much. I'd be willing to bet few even know of its existence. I just saw it last night. It may have launched Tucci and Shalhoub as major talents, and it was certainly far ahead of its time as a comedy set in the past.Whenever 'the Italians' speak English here, they do it with a perfection I rarely see anywhere. Most of the stars are not Italian by any means (only three are Italian), but they convinced me they were! Shalhoub is very fluent in his speech and had to bounce between Italian and English more than Tucci. Whenever Ian Holm explodes onto the scene, it's like he's dragged half of Italy along with him. The point is everyone acted very Italian, and the dialogue is crippling in its humor.The star power is amazing: Sir Ian Holm, a very young Minnie Driver, Isabella Rossellini for heaven's sake, a very young Marc Anthony, an extremely young Liev Schreiber, and an Italian favorite of mine you will not recognize, Pasquale Cajano.Perhaps the biggest star of the film is one of the most delicious-looking Italian dishes I've ever seen. It's true it is uncommon, its recipe being a big secret in the film, but it is an actual dish that is traditional in Tucci's family. In fact Tucci's mother co-wrote a cookbook and the recipe can be found there.Finally I give kudos to the person who set the soundtrack to this film--it brought back many memories for me, and all of the songs are Italian, old, beautiful and a few you'll recognize. Now I will groan but only about a couple of things: 1) the romantic stuff is a little over-the-top and does not help the film at all. 2) I truly bemoan that this was not made by Italians. 3) The swearing in this film is hilariously employed, but there was a carpet-F-bombing I did not appreciate and was shocked to hear on Turner Classic Movies, where I saw this.There--that's it. It isn't much. To see Tucci basically wrote and made this film at so young an age explains the sense ofThe GodfatherI felt here. In fact I remarked that this film could be described as THE GODFATHER except without the blood or the Mafia. Incidentally, this film was shot (partly) at Chelsea Piers, NY. The credits do not tell us where the ""other part"" was shot ... but the exteriors are breathtaking and very realistic.

Secondo, the younger brother, who has been in America somewhat longer than his brother, is the restaurant's manager and must deal with its day to day operations and, more urgently, with impending foreclosure due to financial difficulties. The problems of art vs. commerce causes major conflicts between the two brothers as they prepare for the &quot;big night&quot; which could make or break their business.This is a film of great warmth, humor, and heart.

The pace of this film is like that of a wonderful meal, considered, not rushed, and with attention to detail. Hard-edged business people often use salty language and such is the case here, by both Pascal and Secondo. Pascal is cavalier because he feels in charge of the world and Secondo is trying to figure out how not to be crushed by the weight of it. In Pascal's restaurant, people are having a wonderful time eating what clearly mediocre food is served with great fan fair. At The Paradise, the work in the spotless kitchen is done with the best ingredients and where only a perfect plate is allowed to be taken to the dining room. As is the custom, it is presented with an understated elegance.During this film Stanley Tucci, plays Secondo, who manages to have a fling with both Isabella Rossellini and Minnie Driver. (This is the movie where it is proved that she is nine foot tall and all the stuff in ""Good Will Hunting"" about how she can dunk) Tony Shaloub plays Stanley Tucci's brother, as Primo, who is less talented on the woman front but is, in compensation, the superior chef. Both of them have a mixed relationship with Ian Holm who I feel lets the side down rather by doing too much of the acting stuff with a forced ""eyetalian"" accent. Two points here, firstly, all the male leads also crop up in supporting roles in A Life Less Ordinary and take the opportunity to show off their talents in these bigger roles. Secondly, if a fine actor like Ian Holm is the only disappointment in a movie that is quite a distinction. As the Big Night approaches, we share the preparation and presentation of multiple courses of delicious dishes, where any one could be on the cover of Gourmet magazine. Having a good time and good food is special.In addition to this, the script and the direction is good - the movie is a miracle of brevity considering that, on repeated viewing, one can see that it is shot on a budget that wouldn't buy two lemon polenta cakes at The River Cafe. ""Big Night"" is one of the three cool indie movies that came out of America in 1997.

Written and directed by Stanley Tucci and Cambell Scott, two fairly well accomplished actors who also show up in the film.  Still despite an ensemble cast, the real star of this film is their great screenplay.Stanley Tucci plays Secondo, the younger of two Italian brothers who have immigrated to New York in the 50's, and have started an authentic Italian restarant that struggles by being across the street from a much more popular and successful mainstream restarant.

5967,A2DSXA1E02C86D,0767802535,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 33]","I've seen BIG NIGHT described as &quot;one of the great food movies&quot;. Let me clarify something here. The adjective &quot;great&quot; modifies &quot;food&quot;, but not &quot;movies&quot;.Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) are Italian immigrant brothers who've opened the Paradise restaurant in an unidentified surfside town on the Eastern seaboard sometime in the 1950s. The elder Primo is a superlative chef, and both he and Secondo know it. But, Primo cooks to his desires and not the customers'. So, two years into the venture, the brothers are almost broke, the bank is about to repossess, and Secondo, the one with the business sense, is driven to despairing distraction.Down the street is the competing Italian restaurant owned by Pascal (Ian Holm). While he admires Primo's talent, Pascal gives his patrons what they want, so his eatery is enormously successful. To help the boys out, Pascal arranges to have his friend, the Italian-American singer Louis Prima, come to the Paradise with his band for dinner. Secondo spends virtually the last of their savings preparing for the BIG NIGHT with the expectation that the event and its attendant publicity will yank them back from the brink of insolvency. In the meantime, he avoids emotional commitment to his girlfriend Phyllis (Minnie Driver) while having an affair with Gabriella (Isabella Rossellini), Pascal's mistress. After all, what are pals for?The best bits of this film are the too infrequent cooking sequences. But the best ends there. BIG NIGHT doesn't know whether to be a drama or comedy, and succeeds at neither. The dialogue is flat and uninspired throughout, and the plot goes nowhere of interest. My wife, perhaps a dollop more impressed than I was, called the film a &quot;character study&quot;. But no persona in this otherwise dull movie is engaging, and, indeed, I found Pascal's ebullient crassness positively annoying. About the only other good thing I can say about BIG NIGHT is that it uses as props some well-preserved, large tail-finned, period Cadillacs that will perhaps stimulate vintage car buffs.Better films to rent that revolve around food preparation are MOSTLY MARTHA (2001) and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN (1994).

The images of good food and wine mixed with a varied panoply of dinner guests offers plenty for casual viewing. The story isn't first-class. The characters aren't exactly deep.

5978,A24MVVGNFVG68S,0767802535,Manfred Zeichmann,"[2, 5]","Well, BIG NIGHT is not exactly the kind of movie that I usually watch, but while I would not consider it outstanding, this melodrama kept me captivated and entertained.Set in the 1950ies (the period setting works quite well in the movie`s favour)BIG NIGHT revolves around two Italian brothers who have recently immigrated to the USA, Primo(Tony SHALHOUB)and Secondo(Stanley TUCCI). The brothers run a small Italian restaurant with Secondo as manager and the older Primo as cook. Business is not too good, though, and the bank manager, who had granted them a loan, wants his money back. Complicating matters is the fact that the older Primo, while an outstanding cook is a very traditional man, who does not favour giving in to the different culinary tastes of the local populace and prefers to prepare meals in the traditional way he learned in Italy. The younger Secondo on the other hand is a more business minded type of guy, who would prefer to alter their cooking style in order to attract more customers.The brothers also experience troubles in their love life. Primo is in love with a girl, who works as shop assistant in a flower store, but is too shy and awkward to woo her. Secondo, more of a womanizer, loves a nice girl (great performance by Minnie DRIVER), but cheats on her with a married Italian-American woman, played by Isabella ROSSELLINI. (While I am not overly conservative, I think this plot development makes the Secondo character less likeable.)A friend makes them an offer the brothers can not afford to ignore: He claims to be a good friend of the then famous band leader Louis PRIMA and will invite the musician to dine at their restaurant. The brothers invite everybody they know and risk everything they own in a BIG NIGHT - a party of outstanding culinary refinement. Now will they go bankrupt or will they be successful in their pursuit of the American Dream? Will they get their respective girls? And how will their brotherly relationship turn out? I won't spoil it for you, so watch yourself.Overall I enjoyed the story and the characters. I am particular fond of the Primo character. Tony SHALHOUB is a great actor (and while I never really liked his MONK antics I found his portrayal of an Arab American FBI agent in THE SIEGE outstanding) and turns in a great performance. In particular I found the scene, where his character awkwardly woos his would-be girl friend in the restaurant's kitchen, quite moving. Also the underlying topic of preserving one`s culture and heritage in a foreign environment found favour with me. And one thing is for sure: You WILL get hungry watching this movie and very likely head for an Italian restaurant afterwards!As I already said BIG NIGHT is not the kind of movie I usually watch, so people who are ardent fans of melodramas will very likely enjoy it much more than me (and consequently would give a higer rating!)One last word on the technical side of the DVD: The film is a widescreen presentation in the original theatrical aspect ratio. While perfectly watchable, picture quality is rather unimpressive. Unfortunately there are no extra features to speak of, save a theatrical trailer (which sells the film well, but in my view highlights the film`s comedy aspects too much)and well-written, but brief liner notes.",3,"risotto, love & sibling rivalries",1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3290,"['Well', 'BIG', 'NIGHT', 'not', 'exactly', 'kind', 'movie', 'usually', 'watch', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'outstanding', 'melodrama', 'kept', 'captivated', 'entertained.Set', '1950ies', 'period', 'setting', 'works', 'quite', 'well', 'movie', 's', 'favour', 'BIG', 'NIGHT', 'around', 'two', 'Italian', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'immigrated', 'USA', 'Primo', 'Tony', 'SHALHOUB', 'Secondo', 'Stanley', 'TUCCI', 'brothers', 'run', 'small', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'Secondo', 'manager', 'older', 'Primo', 'cook', 'Business', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'bank', 'manager', 'who', 'had', 'granted', 'loan', 'money', 'back', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'fact', 'older', 'Primo', 'outstanding', 'cook', 'very', 'traditional', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'favour', 'giving', 'different', 'culinary', 'tastes', 'local', 'populace', 'prefers', 'prepare', 'meals', 'traditional', 'way', 'learned', 'Italy', 'younger', 'Secondo', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'business', 'minded', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'alter', 'cooking', 'style', 'order', 'attract', 'more', 'customers.The', 'brothers', 'also', 'experience', 'troubles', 'love', 'life', 'Primo', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'shop', 'assistant', 'flower', 'store', 'too', 'shy', 'awkward', 'woo', 'Secondo', 'more', 'womanizer', 'nice', 'girl', 'great', 'performance', 'Minnie', 'DRIVER', 'cheats', 'married', 'Italian-American', 'woman', 'played', 'Isabella', 'ROSSELLINI', 'am', 'not', 'overly', 'conservative', 'think', 'plot', 'development', 'Secondo', 'character', 'less', 'likeable', 'friend', 'offer', 'brothers', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'ignore', 'be', 'good', 'friend', 'then', 'famous', 'band', 'leader', 'Louis', 'PRIMA', 'will', 'invite', 'musician', 'dine', 'restaurant', 'brothers', 'invite', 'everybody', 'know', 'risk', 'everything', 'own', 'BIG', 'NIGHT', 'party', 'outstanding', 'culinary', 'refinement', 'Now', 'will', 'go', 'bankrupt', 'will', 'be', 'successful', 'pursuit', 'American', 'Dream', 'Will', 'get', 'respective', 'girls', 'how', 'will', 'brotherly', 'relationship', 'turn', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'so', 'watch', 'yourself.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'characters', 'am', 'particular', 'fond', 'Primo', 'character', 'Tony', 'SHALHOUB', 'great', 'actor', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'MONK', 'antics', 'found', 'portrayal', 'Arab', 'American', 'FBI', 'agent', 'THE', 'SIEGE', 'outstanding', 'great', 'performance', 'particular', 'found', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'awkwardly', 'woos', 'would-be', 'girl', 'friend', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'quite', 'moving', 'Also', 'underlying', 'topic', 'preserving', 'one', 's', 'culture', 'heritage', 'foreign', 'environment', 'found', 'favour', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'WILL', 'get', 'hungry', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'likely', 'head', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'afterwards', 'already', 'said', 'BIG', 'NIGHT', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'usually', 'watch', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'ardent', 'fans', 'melodramas', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'consequently', 'would', 'give', 'higer', 'rating', 'One', 'last', 'word', 'technical', 'side', 'DVD', 'film', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'picture', 'quality', 'rather', 'unimpressive', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'speak', 'save', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'well', 'view', 'highlights', 'film', 's', 'comedy', 'aspects', 'too', 'much', 'well-written', 'brief', 'liner', 'notes']",N/A
5979,A3TA89BA53WOE6,0767802535,Michael A. Garcia,"[1, 1]","Big Night is an incredible movie with many ""layers"" of food for thought. There are two recurring themes throughout the movie which I would like to shed light on; one, is food as art, the other is brotherhood and how food is an expression of that.The movie is about two brothers. Secondo (played by Stanley Tucci) is devoted to the success of their business, and Primo (played by Tony Shalhoub) is concerned about the preservation of food as an expression of his tradition, background and devotion; for Primo, food is art. In the opening of the film we see a group of customers eating at their restaurant. They receive the food they ordered which Primo so delicately prepared but they are not satisfied. The food does not look like the ""Americanized"" versions they are used to eating. They are used to eating the commercialized processed versions of what is supposed to be the authentic thing. Whereas the commercialized Italian dinners are made without any heart, Primo pours out not only his heart, but who he is.Secondo, on the other hand, is very different from his older brother. He loves his brother dearly, but his heart doesn't seem to be in his work. He is more worried about saving the restaurant. He desires to climb the ladder of success like his competitor, Pascal. During the movie, a man pays for his food by giving Primo an art piece he painted. Primo asks Secondo, ""Don't you love it?"" but Secondo uncaringly responds, ""Great. Put it with the rest of them."" For Primo, this is not simply a payment, but an exchange of art. This is the difference between Primo and Secondo. For Primo, he sees everything with meaning, but for Secondo, he doesn't allow himself to see the meaning in things. For him, value is measured in bills not in the things in themselves. This is not only true in his business but in his personal life as well. He lets money get in the way of his relationship with Phyllis. He tells her that he can't marry her because he isn't financially ready to do so.Pascal in the film represents the American dream - making great lots of money, but in so doing he destroys the tradition that comes with Italian food. Primo remarks, ""The man should be in a prison for the food he serves."" Pascal doesn't care what he serves, as long as he's making money. He doesn't even care for the people he knows. He offers to help Secondo but what he actually does is ruins him. He doesn't even bother calling him by his real name. He just calls him ""you f**king guy."" For Pascal, Primo and Segundo are just an investment opportunity. For Primo, what Pascal does is sacrilege. As he tells his uncle, ""Do you know what goes on in that man's restaurant every night? RAPE! RAPE! That is what goes on in that place every night! THE RAPE OF CUISINE!"" For Primo, the meaning of food surpasses its value in dollars.When the big night finally arrives, Primo paints a masterpiece with his food. The people are wowed and left in awe. By the end of the night, remarks are made of how this was the best meal they've ever had and probably will have. Even after Primo finds out that Louis Prima isn't coming, he doesn't let that tear his spirits down, because he has enjoyed his art and the company of his friends.When Secondo sees the business collapsing before his eyes, he falls into desperation. Primo offers him a job in Rome working for their uncle but Secondo tells him to go without him. In kinder words, he tells him that he doesn't need him anymore and that he has given him nothing. But what Secondo doesn't realize is that Primo has given him something much more valuable than profits. He says, ""I've tried, I've tried to teach you, Secondo! But you've learned nothing! You're like a child! Why do you act like this? Why?"" What he's been trying to teach him is that they are not simply cooking food, but being who they are. That is why he cannot sacrifice his food for the business like Pascal did. He finally tells Secondo, ""If I sacrifice my work, it dies. It's better ... that I die."" It is then that Secondo finally realizes, not only what food has meant for Primo, but for himself as well.At the end of the film we see Secondo cooking in silence for Primo. Secondo puts his arms over his brother's shoulder and Primo reply's by doing the same. These last few minutes in silence of the film is the most beautiful part of the entire movie. It represents the fact they need to feed each other, not just physically, but in every way. One cannot live without the other. It is a bond which is ultimately inseparable.",5,"Great acting, great story, great movie!",1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,4524,"['Big', 'Night', 'incredible', 'movie', 'many', 'layers', 'food', 'thought', 'are', 'two', 'recurring', 'themes', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'shed', 'light', 'one', 'food', 'art', 'other', 'brotherhood', 'how', 'food', 'expression', 'that.The', 'movie', 'two', 'brothers', 'Secondo', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'devoted', 'success', 'business', 'Primo', 'played', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'concerned', 'preservation', 'food', 'expression', 'tradition', 'background', 'devotion', 'Primo', 'food', 'art', 'opening', 'film', 'see', 'group', 'customers', 'eating', 'restaurant', 'receive', 'food', 'ordered', 'Primo', 'so', 'delicately', 'prepared', 'are', 'not', 'satisfied', 'food', 'not', 'look', 'Americanized', 'versions', 'are', 'used', 'eating', 'are', 'used', 'eating', 'commercialized', 'processed', 'versions', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'authentic', 'thing', 'commercialized', 'Italian', 'dinners', 'are', 'made', 'heart', 'Primo', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'heart', 'who', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'different', 'older', 'brother', 'brother', 'dearly', 'heart', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'work', 'more', 'worried', 'saving', 'restaurant', 'climb', 'ladder', 'success', 'competitor', 'Pascal', 'movie', 'man', 'food', 'giving', 'Primo', 'art', 'piece', 'painted', 'Primo', 'Secondo', 'Do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Secondo', 'uncaringly', 'Great', 'Put', 'rest', 'Primo', 'not', 'simply', 'payment', 'exchange', 'art', 'difference', 'Primo', 'Secondo', 'Primo', 'everything', 'meaning', 'Secondo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'see', 'meaning', 'things', 'value', 'measured', 'bills', 'not', 'things', 'not', 'only', 'true', 'business', 'personal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'money', 'get', 'way', 'relationship', 'Phyllis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'marry', ""n't"", 'financially', 'ready', 'do', 'so.Pascal', 'film', 'American', 'dream', 'making', 'great', 'lots', 'money', 'so', 'doing', 'tradition', 'Italian', 'food', 'Primo', 'remarks', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'prison', 'food', 'Pascal', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'as', 'long', 'making', 'money', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'people', 'help', 'Secondo', 'what', 'actually', 'ruins', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'calling', 'real', 'name', 'just', 'f**king', 'guy', 'Pascal', 'Primo', 'Segundo', 'are', 'just', 'investment', 'opportunity', 'Primo', 'what', 'Pascal', 'sacrilege', 'uncle', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'man', 'restaurant', 'night', 'RAPE', 'RAPE', 'what', 'place', 'night', 'THE', 'RAPE', 'OF', 'CUISINE', 'Primo', 'meaning', 'food', 'surpasses', 'value', 'dollars.When', 'big', 'night', 'finally', 'Primo', 'masterpiece', 'food', 'people', 'are', 'wowed', 'left', 'awe', 'end', 'night', 'remarks', 'are', 'made', 'how', 'was', 'best', 'meal', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'probably', 'will', 'have', 'Even', 'Primo', 'out', 'Louis', 'Prima', ""n't"", 'coming', ""n't"", 'let', 'tear', 'spirits', 'down', 'enjoyed', 'art', 'company', 'friends.When', 'Secondo', 'business', 'collapsing', 'eyes', 'desperation', 'Primo', 'job', 'Rome', 'working', 'uncle', 'Secondo', 'go', 'kinder', 'words', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'given', 'nothing', 'what', 'Secondo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Primo', 'given', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'valuable', 'profits', ""'ve"", 'tried', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'teach', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'child', 'Why', 'do', 'act', 'Why', 'What', 'been', 'trying', 'teach', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'cooking', 'food', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'food', 'business', 'Pascal', 'did', 'finally', 'Secondo', 'sacrifice', 'work', 'better', 'die', 'then', 'Secondo', 'finally', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'food', 'meant', 'Primo', 'well.At', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'Secondo', 'cooking', 'silence', 'Primo', 'Secondo', 'arms', 'brother', 'shoulder', 'Primo', 'reply', 'doing', 'same', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'silence', 'film', 'most', 'beautiful', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'fact', 'need', 'feed', 'other', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'way', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'other', 'bond', 'ultimately', 'inseparable']",N/A

On the surface it's a quirky little story about two Italian brothers running a restaurant in New Jersey in the 1950's. One is ridiculously passionate about cooking superb food while the other tries to make his brother's passion commercially viable despite the fact that customers don't want what he cooks. Both are up against their more successful Italian neighbour who gives the customers exactly what they want. Not much then... but it's what goes on beneath this deceptively simple tale that makes it so good.The tense, sincere and often very funny interactions between the two brothers are so believable that they make you really want them to succeed with the ""Big Night"" on which the future of their restaurant and their relationship depends. Against this background, the preparation of the dishes themselves becomes an all-consuming event, infused with the drama and expectation of a chef in full flight cooking, of necessity, the meal of his life. And, the subtle plot with its inevitable denouement is understated and, as a result, extremely effective.Brilliantly acted, charming and, in the end, quite moving, ""Big Night"" is a superbly reflective exploration into the dreams & hopes of two immigrants in an alien world where their values don't apply and where this threatens to destroy the most important relationship they have.

5992,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767802535,Reviewer,"[3, 6]","No matter who we are or where we go, one of the common threads that binds us together as a species is the fact that our lives, in one way or another, are filled with hopes and dreams.  The aspirations may vary, and of course change from individual to individual according to wants and needs, but irrefutably it is there, and more often than not has a significant bearing on who we are and what we become.  And it is that kind of ambition and the need to succeed that generates the impetus in ""Big Night,"" a drama set to the tune of real life, directed by Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott; a film that explores what it means to follow your heart and hold on to that dream, even in the face of adversity.  Finally, it's a story about love, trust, truth and betrayal, all of the things that make up what we fondly, and often exasperatingly, call ""life.""It's the 1950s; two brothers, Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) have recently emigrated from Italy and landed on the Jersey shore where they are trying to make a go of their Italian restaurant, the ""Paradise.""  Business, however, is not good; Primo is a genius chef, but insists on preparing meals fit for the gods (like his exquisite risotto) rather than the mere mortals who only occasionally stop in to sample the elegant offerings of their board of fare.  Secondo, the businessman of the two and the visible presence in the restaurant, has tried time and again to reason with Primo in regards to the menu, but to no avail.  And now, the Paradise is on the verge of going broke; the bank is about to foreclose.Help often comes from the least likely quarter, however, and so it is here, when Pascal (Ian Holm), the owner of a rival (and quite successful) restaurant offers to do them a favor.  He offers to call his friend, the famous jazz musician Louis Prima, to invite him and his entire band and entourage to dinner at the Paradise, which just may provide the shot in the arm the restaurant needs to stay afloat.  And so Primo and Secondo prepare for the biggest night of their lives, the one ""big night"" that is going to save them and keep their dream of making it to the top-- ""their"" way-- alive.Working from a screenplay written by Tucci and Joseph Tropiano (Tucci's cousin), directors Tucci and Scott deliver a thoroughly engaging and entertaining film, a little gem that is worth any number of Hollywood blockbusters put together.  The characters are sharply drawn and presented with humor and poignancy that resonates with honesty and realism.  It's the kind of film that opens itself up and invites you in with the promise of a sumptuous feast awaiting between the opening and closing frames, then makes good on that promise.  Collectively, the filmmakers have a studied and subtle touch that makes this film appealing and accessible to everyone and anyone who has ever aspired to something better.  And they make it very clear that theirs is a pursuit of the heart, rather than the cold comfort of a viable bottom line.  They actively seek out the humanity that resides at the center of their story, and finding it, they convey it to their audience with a sure hand devoid of any pretensions or undo sentimentality.  There is, without question, sensitivity in their approach, but it is restrained and effective and allows the drama to play out in very real terms.  The characters are people you quickly grow to like, similar in nature to those who populate Bonnie Hunt's wonderful ""Return To Me"" (which starred Minnie Driver, who is also featured in this one).One of the elements that sells a film, even one which seemingly has everything going for it to begin with, is the performances; and the ones here are first rate all around.  As the brothers, Shalhoub and Tucci each take an understated approach that makes their characters convincing and real.  Tucci, especially, lends incredible nuance to his portrayal of Secondo.  Watching him perform a basic task like preparing food in the kitchen becomes spellbinding; the way he approaches the counter, scrapes a knife on the cutting board before he begins chopping and slicing, the second nature of the way he wipes his hands on his apron or removes a skillet hanging overhead and places it on the stove.  It's all SO real that it puts you right there in the kitchen with him.  And it makes you a part of the experience rather than merely an observer.  The same can be said for Shalhoub.  His portrayal of Primo is a study in precision, and the mannerisms  shared by Primo and Secondo and the way they connect with one another makes the casting of them as brothers entirely believable.  Their relationship has that necessary sense of lifelong history about it that makes it genuine.As Pascal, Ian Holm gives an energetic and larger-than-life performance that makes his character a decided presence in the film, and it makes his pivotal role in the story convincing.  And as Pascal's girl, Gabriella, Isabella Rossellini leaves a lasting impression, as well, with a performance that is discriminatingly seductive.As Secondo's romantic interest, Phyllis, Minnie Driver is charming and irresistible.  Her screen time is comparatively limited, but Driver makes what she has significant, with an expressiveness that makes Phyllis endearing.  And with her eyes and facial expressions, Driver speaks volumes.  It's a winning performance that makes Phyllis an unforgettable character.Also effective in smaller roles are Allison Janney as Ann; Campbell Scott as Bob, the most convincing car salesman to grace the screen since Kurt Russell's Rudy Russo in ""Used Cars;"" and Liev Schreiber as Leo.  The ending of ""Big Night"" is somewhat ambiguous; but staying true to the story, it is the ambiguity of ""life"" itself.  And a more perfect ending there could not possibly be.",5,A Night to Remember with Primo and Secondo,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,5792,"['matter', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'go', 'one', 'common',

As many reviewers have noted already the Italian cooking and the scenes in the kitchen will have you craving a fine Italian dinner as soon as you finish watching.Beyond the food this is a fine film with a very touching story involving two immigrant brothers who are extremely close despite their obvious personality differences. The tension between the brothers builds as they attempt to salvage their struggling restaurant business. Primo (Tony Shalhoub)the older brother has an artistic temperment and that applies to his uncompromising approach to cooking and cuisine. His brother,Secondi(Staney Tucci), has more material ambitions and is manipulated by a competing restauratnt owner into an ill-advised attempt to publicise their restaurant by having an elaborate dinner party for singer Louie Prima. Hence the film revolves around preparations for THE BIG NIGHT.The climax has the conflict between the brothers break out into the open and the film ends with a beautiful sequence in the kitchen where there is a silent reconcilliation.The story is set in a New Jersey shore town in the 1950's. The period is captured beautifully with big-finned Cadilacs cruising down the main street and the women's fashions are right on the money.

5994,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0767802535,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Big Night (Stanley Tucci, 1996)Big Night is the quintessential foodie film. That's pretty much all you need to know to figure out whether you're going to enjoy this movie or not; it's all about the food. It does have a plot, but that takes a backseat to the food-- which is just as it should be.Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) are brothers who own an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. It's on the brink of closing. Pascal (Ian Holm), the owner of a competing joint across the street, offers to set the two up cooking dinner for Louis Prima, one huge blowout they can use to gain publicity and get the restaurant back on its feet. The brothers accept, and the planning begins.The bulk of this movie is, in fact, about planning a bash. There are some subplots, and there is, of course, the feast itself, an extended scene guaranteed to cause watering mouths among the entire audience, but the meat of it is what really goes on when you're trying to gather up a whole lot of ingredients and do a whole lot of cooking under the gun. And you might not think it, but that's riveting. Stanley Tucci gets a chance to put his acting talents to the test, and he does a great job at playing a frustrated restauranteur short on time and patience. The supporting cast plays off him well, and of course, the food is sumptuous. If you haven't seen it yet, you want to. *** ",4,The celluloid equivalent of a Poppy Z.

But the film resonates because it got so many of the little touches right, from the ensemble cast to the soundtrack to the editing to the cinematography.  So there is a lot of credit to go around.Tucci plays Secondo, the aptly named younger of two Italian brothers who have emigrated to New Jersey from the Old Country.  Secondo is the entrepreneur, the guy who wants the big Cadillac.  Primo (Tony Shahloub), the older brother, is the magician of a chef.  Primo is so good, in fact, that his culinary masterpieces go over the heads of the good folks of New Jersey.  When contemplating a wonderful seafood risotto, a diner complains that she can't see the seafood, and that her desired side of spaghetti doesn't come with meatballs (inspiring the wonderful line, &quot;Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone&quot;).Primo bemoans the fact that he is serving food to Philistines, but the sad fact is that most of the Philistines are eating across the street at Pascal's restaurant.  Pascal, played with great zest by Ian Holm, knows that you have to give the customer what he wants -- even if it is culinary sacrilege.  The contrasts between the restaurants, from the colors to the lighting to the clientele, could not be more staggering!Secondo laments to Pascal of his financial woes, but refuses Pascal's (repeated) offer to come work for him.  Pascal, being a big-hearted guy, tells Secondo to pull of a &quot;big night,&quot; with no holds barred.  Pascal will invite his good friend, Louis Prima, who will come, eat, and love Secondo's restaurant.  Then, the people will come.So the story builds to the big night (a side plot regarding Secondo's tortured love life notwithstanding), which is where the movie really takes off.Organizing the banquet scene into courses, &quot;Big Night&quot; revels in the wonders that can only be brought about by great cooking.  The cast has a difficult task -- how do you emote rapture without going over the top?  The ensemble cast, which includes Isabella Rosselini, Minnie Driver, and Allison Janney, nails this task just right.  The cooking scenes are also hectic and impressive without going over the top, too.Following the big night, many truths are revealed, perhaps because it is impossible to deceive after having such a wondrous experience.

Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secundo (Stanley Tucci) are Italian brothers struggling to make their small restaurant a success. Secondo (called ""Seco"" for short) is thankful to be in the United States. His English is strong and he sees America as the land of opportunity. His brother Primo is an artist with food - an amazing talent who is so passionate about food, he refers to the lackluster menu of the restaurant across the street as the ""rape of cuisine."" And he's not kidding when he says it, either.Seco may have been born in Italy, but he's always been an American in his heart. He understands the culture and knows that you have to give Americans what they want. Primo is insulted by the reprobate palate of their backwards clientele and refuses to compromise.Many plots intertwine... Seco's romance with Phyllis (Minnie Driver) contrasted with his affair with Gabriella (the stunningly gorgeous Isabella Rosellini), and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads - the impending foreclosure of their restaurant.Primo and Secondo have one last shot at success as an impending visit by Jazz performer Louis Prima promises to put their little piece of Italy on the map.Ian Holm plays their nemesis, Pascal, a competing restaurateur who admires Primo's talents and has no qualms about ruining the lives of his fellow Italian-Americans in the spirit of not-so-friendly competition.Everything hinges on the big night - where their friends and some of the local ""who's who"" muckety-mucks experience Primo's genius. One course after another and with sexual inuendos, those who are feasting moan in delight. As the dessert tray approaches, the bloated guests  get ready to undo their pants to stuff themselves even more.In the end, the big night is truly a big event, but just another night. The real story is the love of these two brothers. They drive each other crazy, but they love one another. Nothing ends up in a neat, tidy little bow in the end - just like real life, Primo and Seco have no idea what tomorrow may bring for them, but they will face it together.As a DVD, this is pretty underwhelming. The menu looks like it was it was drawn by Stevie Wonder and other than a trailer and an option for subtitles, there are no features worth writing home about. I have a 7-year-old DVD player and still, the DVD looks great on my HDTV, even without progressive scan or up-converting.I would have liked to have seen interviews with the cast and directors... but as a film, it was a delight to watch.",5,feast of the heart,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2607,"['Big', 'Night', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'food', 'heart', 'brotherhood', 'American', 'Dream', 'Primo', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Secundo', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'are', 'Italian', 'brothers', 'struggling', 'make', 'small', 'restaurant', 'success', 'Secondo', 'called', 'Seco', 'short', 'thankful', 'be', 'United', 'States', 'English', 'strong', 'America', 'land', 'opportunity', 'brother', 'Primo', 'artist', 'food', 'amazing', 'talent', 'who', 'so', 'passionate', 'food', 'lackluster', 'menu', 'restaurant', 'street', 'rape', 'cuisine', 'not', 'kidding', 'when', 'either.Seco', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'Italy', 'always', 'been', 'American', 'heart', 'culture', 'have', 'give', 'Americans', 'what', 'want', 'Primo', 'insulted', 'reprobate', 'palate', 'backwards', 'clientele', 'compromise.Many', 'plots', 'intertwine', 'Seco', 'romance', 'Phyllis', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'contrasted', 'affair', 'Gabriella', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'Isabella', 'Rosellini', 'sword', 'Damocles', 'hanging', 'over', 'heads', 'impending', 'foreclosure', 'restaurant.Primo', 'Secondo', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'shot', 'success', 'impending', 'visit', 'Jazz', 'performer', 'Louis', 'Prima', 'put', 'little', 'piece', 'Italy', 'map.Ian', 'Holm', 'nemesis', 'Pascal', 'competing', 'restaurateur', 'who', 'Primo', 'talents', 'qualms', 'ruining', 'lives', 'fellow', 'Italian-Americans', 'spirit', 'not-so-friendly', 'competition.Everything', 'hinges', 'big', 'night', 'where', 'friends', 'local', 'who', 'who', 'muckety-mucks', 'experience', 'Primo', 'genius', 'One', 'course', 'sexual', 'inuendos', 'who', 'are', 'feasting', 'moan', 'delight', 'dessert', 'tray', 'approaches', 'bloated', 'guests', 'get', 'ready', 'undo', 'pants', 'stuff', 'even', 'more.In', 'end', 'big', 'night', 'truly', 'big', 'event', 'just', 'night', 'real', 'story', 'love', 'two', 'brothers', 'drive', 'other', 'crazy', 'love', 'one', 'Nothing', 'up', 'neat', 'tidy', 'little', 'bow', 'end', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'Primo', 'Seco', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'tomorrow', 'may', 'bring', 'will', 'face', 'together.As', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'underwhelming', 'menu', 'was', 'was', 'drawn', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'other', 'trailer', 'option', 'subtitles', 'are', 'features', 'writing', 'home', 'have', '7-year-old', 'DVD', 'player', 'still', 'DVD', 'great', 'HDTV', 'even', 'progressive', 'scan', 'up-converting.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'interviews', 'cast', 'directors', 'film', 'was', 'delight', 'watch']",N/A

6004,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,0767802535,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[3, 3]","This wonderful film, set in pre-Julia Child America, captures perfectly the enduring conflict in this country between quality and the pandering to the lack of it. Many other countries, which have taught their citizens standards of excellence, assume that what is most popular will therefore be the best; thus, for example, even a Tokyo cabdriver knows that sushi is undeniably superior to beef bowl. Amusingly, many Japanese tourists to the States falsely assume as a consequence that certain fast food restaurants here must feature the best American food because they are the most popular. ""Big Night"" exposes the fallacy in such thinking. It is Ian Holm's vulgar spaghetti factory which is the financial success, not the restaurant where the foodie artist Tony Shaloub cooks, a bistro which features magnificent cuisine beyond the average 50's American person's palate. What the film shows is that an unpopular artist may be above the average person's taste instead of necessarily below it.
