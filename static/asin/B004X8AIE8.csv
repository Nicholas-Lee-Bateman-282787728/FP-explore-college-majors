E Jackson,"[1, 2]","If I were you, I wouldn't go into Cedar Rapids expecting much in the way of storyline development.Yes there's a concept involving an insurance agent (Ed Helm's clueless, child-like character) and he visits another town and meets up with John C. Reily's VERY offensive and sexually-motivated character, along with a few females (one of which is an attractive redhead who's pretty silly and flurts with Ed, and another is a prostitute who Ed befriends.  She's always out on the streets, working).Basically Cedar Rapids is just total nonstop silliness from beginning to end.  Ed Helms is supposed to be the lead character, and I guess he is, but there's a few other characters that share lead role so I'm not sure why his mug is on the DVD cover.Even though I found myself laughing quite a bit, I really have a hard time believing this is generally considered a quality comedy movie.  Much of it feels quickly slapped together in both the plot development (what little there is, I mean) and the build-up in humor (there wasn't any- it was just a bunch of one-liners).Some of these scenes such as the character of Ed Helms flurting with the redhead in a swimming pool after a drunken night of fun, and Ed having a girlfriend who's much older than he is and people assuming that she's his mom, are examples of above average laughter.  Nothing earth-shattering of course.John C. Reilly's dirty sexual-related prankster humor is honestly the funniest part of the movie.  He says the sickest, dirtiest, most inappropriate lines imaginable, haha.Overall, it's funny, and even though the storyline is suppoesd to be about an insurance agent who wants to set out and impress his boss, don't expect much satisfaction in that regard.  Just a pretty good movie with little in the way of storyline.",4,"funny, but in a silly/pointless kind of way",1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,1783,"['were', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'expecting', 'much', 'way', 'storyline', 'development.Yes', 'concept', 'involving', 'insurance', 'agent', 'Ed', 'Helm', 'clueless', 'child-like', 'character', 'town', 'up', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'VERY', 'offensive', 'sexually-motivated', 'character', 'few', 'females', 'one', 'attractive', 'redhead', 'who', 'pretty', 'silly', 'flurts', 'Ed', 'prostitute', 'who', 'Ed', 'always', 'out', 'streets', 'working', '.Basically', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'just', 'total', 'nonstop', 'silliness', 'beginning', 'end', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'supposed', 'be', 'lead', 'character', 'guess', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'share', 'lead', 'role', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'mug', 'DVD', 'cover.Even', 'found', 'laughing', 'quite', 'bit', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'generally', 'considered', 'quality', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Much', 'quickly', 'slapped', 'together', 'plot', 'development', 'what', 'little', 'mean', 'build-up', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'any-', 'was', 'just', 'bunch', 'one-liners', '.Some', 'scenes', 'such', 'character', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'flurting', 'redhead', 'swimming', 'pool', 'drunken', 'night', 'fun', 'Ed', 'having', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'people', 'assuming', 'mom', 'are', 'examples', 'above', 'average', 'laughter', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'course.John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'dirty', 'sexual-related', 'prankster', 'humor', 'honestly', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'sickest', 'dirtiest', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'lines', 'imaginable', 'haha.Overall', 'funny', 'even', 'storyline', 'suppoesd', 'be', 'insurance', 'agent', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'impress', 'boss', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'satisfaction', 'regard', 'Just', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'way', 'storyline']",N/A
1431583,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B004X8AIE8,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[0, 3]","Cedar Rapids isn't an unfunny movie - or at least, it has its moments.  And for the first two-thirds, it sets itself up as an understated comedy, with all concerned - expecially John C. Reilly - ably handling their acting chores while the film follows the formula of small-town, aw-shucks guy Tim Lippe (Ed Helms) who gets overwhelmed by the fast women and loose morality in the big city...of Cedar Rapids.  The irony is, of course, that Cedar Rapids, even as the second largest city in Iowa, is still perceived as the epitome of small town, flyover country America - I know, I live practically around the corner from it.So when a fluke accident enables Tim to represent the home office at a convention of regional insurance providers, he falls in with a group of veteran conventioneers who steer him through the sticky wickets of competition for the coveted 'Two-Diamond' award for the best agency.  Like many films of this sort, Tim's sheltered life has produced a rather rigid code of behavior which is at first repelled by the wild antics of his fellows - who are of the mind that what happens in Cedar Rapids, stays in Cedar Rapids - though slowly his reticence at joining in breaks down.  So far, so good - up to this point, the film is good-natured and innocuous.Other films I've seen that pursue this same pattern - especially those from the late sixties through the eighties - often had a moment in the film where the aw-shucks character completely breaks from his puritan upbringing and loses control.  Some temptation proves too much for him to resist, and for better or worse, he is awakened to the dubious charms of the big city.  Sex and drugs are usually the culprit - and it seemed to me ganja was often the drug of choice.  CEDAR RAPIDS follows this general drift, but to my mind, it takes a spectacularly unfunny turn as Tim finds himself on a meth-fueled romp after seriously bruising his ethics during the convention's award competition.Meth use seems to me to be such an unmitigated disaster that I just can't find anything funny about it.  CEDAR RAPIDS doesn't exactly glorify its use, but there's enough of a mixed message here that I felt extremely uncomfortable with those scenes.  Even without them, CEDAR RAPIDS ends up as only average - it seemed at any moment a really funny movie was trying to break out, but it never quite made it.  Instead, it ends up more as a character study, but without enough heft behind it to make it truly moving.  Average, yet with a full star deducted for the ambiguous drug use.",2,Ambiguous drug use drags down an otherwise average film,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2537,"['Cedar', 'Rapids', ""n't"", 'unfunny', 'movie', 'least', 'moments', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'up', 'understated', 'comedy', 'concerned', 'expecially', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'ably', 'handling', 'acting', 'chores', 'film', 'formula', 'small-town', 'aw-shucks', 'guy', 'Tim', 'Lippe', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'who', 'overwhelmed', 'fast', 'women', 'loose', 'morality', 'big', 'city', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'irony', 'course', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'even', 'second', 'largest', 'city', 'Iowa', 'still', 'perceived', 'epitome', 'small', 'town', 'flyover', 'country', 'America', 'know', 'live', 'practically', 'corner', 'it.So', 'when', 'fluke', 'accident', 'Tim', 'represent', 'home', 'office', 'convention', 'regional', 'insurance', 'providers', 'group', 'veteran', 'conventioneers', 'who', 'steer', 'sticky', 'wickets', 'competition', 'coveted', ""'Two-Diamond"", 'award', 'best', 'agency', 'many', 'films', 'sort', 'Tim', 'sheltered', 'life', 'produced', 'rather', 'rigid', 'code', 'behavior', 'first', 'repelled', 'wild', 'antics', 'fellows', 'who', 'are', 'mind', 'what', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'slowly', 'reticence', 'joining', 'breaks', 'down', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'good-natured', 'innocuous.Other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pursue', 'same', 'pattern', 'especially', 'late', 'sixties', 'eighties', 'often', 'had', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'aw-shucks', 'character', 'completely', 'puritan', 'upbringing', 'control', 'temptation', 'too', 'much', 'resist', 'better', 'worse', 'awakened', 'dubious', 'charms', 'big', 'city', 'Sex', 'drugs', 'are', 'usually', 'culprit', 'seemed', 'ganja', 'was', 'often', 'drug', 'choice', 'CEDAR', 'RAPIDS', 'general', 'drift', 'mind', 'spectacularly', 'unfunny', 'turn', 'Tim', 'meth-fueled', 'romp', 'seriously', 'bruising', 'ethics', 'convention', 'award', 'competition.Meth', 'use', 'be', 'such', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'funny', 'CEDAR', 'RAPIDS', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'glorify', 'use', 'enough', 'mixed', 'message', 'here', 'felt', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'Even', 'CEDAR', 'RAPIDS', 'up', 'only', 'average', 'seemed', 'moment', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'never', 'quite', 'made', 'Instead', 'up', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'enough', 'heft', 'make', 'truly', 'moving', 'Average', 'yet', 'full', 'star', 'deducted', 'ambiguous', 'drug', 'use']",N/A

Instead, after fifteen minutes, I knew I'd be watching the whole thing because its gentle charm had taken hold over me.Ed Helms plays Tim Lippe, an insurance agent for Brown Star Insurance in Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Tim is a bit of a dork.  He is the epitome of being a nice guy without having a bit of polish or pizazz about himself.  He unexpectedly finds himself being sent by his company to the ""big city"" for an insurance event.  This big city is Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  There he meets a motley crew of other agents who succeed in loosening him up some.  Chief among these is the the wonderful actor John C. Reilley, who personifies every stereotype about insurance agents imaginable.  He is hilarious. Close behind him is Isiah Whitlock Jr. playing a black insurance agent who spends most of his free time doing community theater. Anne Heche rounds out the trio by being a femme fatal married insurance agent who is always on the make at these out of town conventions. Presiding over this annual event is Kurtwood Smith as the ultra-religious president of the convention whom Reilley constantly assails for besmirching insurance with religion (one of this best comedic bits).All in all, a very enjoyable movie which deserves a wider audience than it got in the theaters.

1431585,A1435P5AMCPB3X,B004X8AIE8,"Concerned One ""Thrashfan""","[1, 2]","This movie is an easy watch.  It follows Tom Lippe, an insurance salesman from Rhinelander Wisconsin (He says the Rhineland Valley in the film) on his first trip outside of Wisconsin to the ""big city"" of Cedar Rapids, Iowa for a conference. From there, it's a typical ""fish out of water"" movie that is funny and played really well by Ed Helms. The supporting cast of Anne Hesche as Joan, Isiah Whitlock as Ron, and John C. Riley as Dean did well in adding to the comedy of the movie. John C. Riley's lines are pretty graphic in language, but not far from his typical rolls.  The bonus features on the Blu Ray are pretty good (7 minutes of deletes scenes, plus several little side interviews and behind the scenes featurettes, and a gag reel also.), and BD live works well here also. It is a sleeper that did not get much if any theatre play, but should be checked out.That being said, I am dissapointed that they did not actually film this on location in Cedar Rapids.  I feel if the movie's name is Cedar Rapids, and the whole film pivots around it, why didn't they pay the extra and film it where it should have been?  They actually filmed it in Ann Arbor, Michigan possibly because of tax breaks that were not offered in Cedar Rapids.  They take several actual views of Cedar Rapids such as the flight over 380 and Mays Island with the Court House and Vet's Coluseum on it, and the riverfront view of Quaker Oats, but several of the street shots, outdoor scenes, and driving shots are of Ann Arbor. I appreciate the mention of the flooding and how Cedar Rapids was resilliant. It also made me chuckle when they mention a restaraunt that was supposed to be at Westdale Mall. Westdale is virtually deserted due to poor economy and since Montgomery Wards left years ago, and now serves as temporary locations for the Library and some City Offices after the flooding of 2008.

1431586,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004X8AIE8,C. Sawin,"[1, 3]","Cedar Rapids looked like the type of comedy that could go either way. The trailer seemed to hint at Ed Helms channeling his Stu Price character from The Hangover. In fact, that was my initial thought process going in; that Cedar Rapids would probably be an extension of Helms' character in The Hangover. Other than the trailer being attached to one film before a screening, I've never seen the film advertised anywhere else as most haven't seen anything relating to the film at all. Luckily, the film was able to offer a little more than what it let on and actually turned out to be a rather solid R-rated comedy.This shouldn't be a downright comparison between The Hangover and Cedar Rapids though; no matter how blatant it may seem. There is very little in common between the two films other than Ed Helms starring in both films and the crazy occurrences that can transpire under the influence of alcohol (in addition to some sort of hallucinogen, as well). Cedar Rapids is a comedy that is driven by Ed Helms' dorky yet alluring charm.The cast is easily the film's most valuable asset as the scenes featuring all of the main cast are the most hilarious and the most memorable. Other than Ed Helms nerding it up to perfection, John C. Reilly almost steals the show as the loyal sex-hound Dean Ziggler. This also may be the best Anne Heche has looked in any film she's been a part of. The Cedar Rapids yearly ASMI convention being her character's only means of escaping the redundancy of everyday family life added a bit of depth to her character and made what would otherwise be scandalous actions a little more meaningful. Heche's real charm comes out in the scenes she shares with Helms. Their relationship is one of the driving factors of the film. Isiah Whitlock Jr plays Ronald Wilkes, a man who takes his job as an insurance salesman incredibly seriously but who also lets his dry humor and constant admiration of ""the HBO program The Wire"" shine at the best of times. Sigourney Weaver's character seemed to catch me off guard. Mostly because when you think of Weaver, you think of Aliens, Ghostbusters, or Avatar. In Cedar Rapids, she plays an on the prowl cougar who teaches and is just looking for a good time. So much for typecasting, eh? Stephen Root, Kurtwood Smith, and Alia Shawkat all have their moments, as well.Cedar Rapids does have an indie feel to it though, which is probably a fair assessment to make since the film's budget was only $8 million. Cedar Rapids has a Little Miss Sunshine kind of atmosphere to it. Not so much in tone, but more of the way it was filmed. It could be a turn-off for some viewers who aren't fans of movies with small budgets.Cedar Rapids is easily the funniest film to be released in 2011 so far. The entire cast plays off of each other in the best of ways and even some of the smaller roles given to more recognizable stars are pivotal to the laughs in the film. Unpredictable at times and extremely over the top at others, Cedar Rapids is definitely worth a watch if you enjoy R-rated comedies or films similar to The Hangover or Little Miss Sunshine.",4,A fantastic little comedy,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,3105,"['Cedar', 'Rapids', 'looked', 'type', 'comedy', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'trailer', 'seemed', 'hint', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'channeling', 'Stu', 'Price', 'character', 'Hangover', 'fact', 'was', 'initial', 'thought', 'process', 'going', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'extension', 'Helms', 'character', 'Hangover', 'Other', 'trailer', 'being', 'attached', 'one', 'film', 'screening', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'advertised', 'anywhere', 'else', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'relating', 'film', 'Luckily', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'offer', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'let', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'solid', 'R-rated', 'comedy.This', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'downright', 'comparison', 'Hangover', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'matter', 'how', 'blatant', 'may', 'seem', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'two', 'films', 'other', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'starring', 'films', 'crazy', 'occurrences', 'can', 'transpire', 'influence', 'alcohol', 'addition', 'sort', 'hallucinogen', 'well', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'comedy', 'driven', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'dorky', 'yet', 'alluring', 'charm.The', 'cast', 'easily', 'film', 'most', 'valuable', 'asset', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'main', 'cast', 'are', 'most', 'hilarious', 'most', 'memorable', 'Other', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'nerding', 'perfection', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'almost', 'show', 'loyal', 'sex-hound', 'Dean', 'Ziggler', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'looked', 'film', 'been', 'part', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'yearly', 'ASMI', 'convention', 'being', 'character', 'only', 'escaping', 'redundancy', 'everyday', 'family', 'life', 'added', 'bit', 'depth', 'character', 'made', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'scandalous', 'actions', 'little', 'more', 'meaningful', 'Heche', 'real', 'charm', 'out', 'scenes', 'shares', 'Helms', 'relationship', 'one', 'driving', 'factors', 'film', 'Isiah', 'Whitlock', 'Jr', 'Ronald', 'Wilkes', 'man', 'who', 'job', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'incredibly', 'seriously', 'who', 'also', 'dry', 'humor', 'constant', 'admiration', 'HBO', 'program', 'Wire', 'shine', 'best', 'times', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'character', 'seemed', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'Mostly', 'when', 'think', 'Weaver', 'think', 'Aliens', 'Ghostbusters', 'Avatar', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'prowl', 'cougar', 'who', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'So', 'much', 'typecasting', 'eh', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'have', 'moments', 'well.Cedar', 'Rapids', 'have', 'indie', 'feel', 'probably', 'fair', 'assessment', 'make', 'film', 'budget', 'was', 'only', '8', 'million', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'tone', 'more', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'could', 'be', 'turn-off', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'movies', 'small', 'budgets.Cedar', 'Rapids', 'easily', 'funniest', 'film', 'be', 'released', '2011', 'so', 'far', 'entire', 'cast', 'other', 'best', 'ways', 'even', 'smaller', 'roles', 'given', 'more', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'are', 'pivotal', 'laughs', 'film', 'Unpredictable', 'times', 'extremely', 'top', 'others', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'films', 'similar', 'Hangover', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine']",N/A

Symington ""millenium reader""","[2, 3]","I sat down to watch this just to kill some time thinking it would be as bad as Helms' ""Hall Pass"" (one of the worst ever imho), but to my great surprise, this movie was not only entertaining, but the acting and directing were superb.  The writing fell short on a couple of occasions when it tried to dip into ""R"" rated territory, but even then it almost seemed to fit with the path that Helms' character took during his visit to Cedar Rapids.  As another reviewer said, it could have gotten sappy but never did.The storyline is all too believable in these days of corporate fraud and manipulation, and the actors really brought it to life.

Been in this business for many years.Never been to a convention like the one portrayed in CEDAR RAPIDS.  But I'll darn sure keep looking.  The beauty of this indie comedy is the characters; I KNOW people like Tim Lippe (Ed Helms), Bill Krogstadt (Stephen Root), and yes, Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly).

I've seen gung ho folks do likewise; heck, I've partied with several extroverted, rowdy, and raunchy Dean Zieglers.  (Been tempted by one or two Joan Ostrowskis; Anne Heche works handsomely on the old eyeball.)

This movie, full of non-rainbow flag characters, showed three males nude and none of the other gender.  Go figure.There's something I like about Ed Helms.  Least important, he looks practically like two different men with or without his eyeglasses.  He has that innocent, loveable (sp?) vibe that Seth Rogen does.  Not only does he have chest hair, but it covers his pecks all the way past his navel.  If you like nerdy guys with hairy chests, then you will love all the flesh he shows here, including his backside.  He has that same cuteness that Rick Moranis had, but wasn't really able to cash in on.  Don't get me wrong: he doesn't have a curvy, perfect, monstah-booty like Ving Rhames, but it's still worth seeing and appreciating.This work was an examination of hypocrisy, particularly from the highly religious.  If you can't stand holier-than-thou types, then you may appreciate this meditation.  However, some churchy people may be rubbed the wrong way by it.It was hard for me to buy that Ed's character was such a novice.  I am fully aware that many of us Americans are very geographically immobile.  However, I doubt anyone would see a trip to Cedar Rapids as akin to visiting NYC.  He flies from WI to IA and I imagine that most WI residents would just drive their cars there.  The main character is supposed to be out of it, but yet he uses fancy laptop computers and smart phones.  Those tools are supposed to make the world smaller.  Yes, WI is terribly un-diverse, but I'm quite sure every WI resident has met a Black person before, which Ed's character hadn't.In the trailer for the film, I didn't recognize the token female buddy of the troupe.  It turns out to be Anne Heche.  Since she dissed Ellen, I've lost respect for her, so I wasn't happy to see her in a major role again.  However, they have her in Julianne Moore drag.  I somehow think the casting department knew that she's lost many points with some moviegoers.  I don't see why one of the women from Judd Apatow's films wasn't chosen instead.  John C. Reilly seemed fatter here than usual and I wonder if he purposely gained weight for the role, btw.The four characters are supposed to be a motley crew, but they were more like Culture Club.  The Black character plays against type (thankfully).  However, the fact that this film revolves around an extroverted white man, an introverted white man, a Black person, and a woman was tacitly PC.  But I still basically applaud it as being diverse and multi-culty.  Nevertheless, putting on my feminist hat, there is a way in which the woman was not deemed one of the Three Musketeers.  The men make a commercial near the end in which it's implied that she is their secretary.  However, through the film, she was positioned as having as much insurance experience as the guys.For those of us who almost never travel on the job or attend annual events, this may be novel.  However, I do get the sense that annual events like these are where many people find themselves or get yanked out of their comfort zones.  I get the sense that rainbow-flag bear retreats may be as cathartic as this insurance conference was to the main characters.

1431605,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004X8AIE8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[29, 35]","Cedar Rapids is a sweet, but never sappy, comedy from director Miguel Arteta, who specializes in small films, usually comedies, which are almost anti-Hollywood in the way they allow humor to come naturally from well-developed characters rather than contrived jokes. Like his previous efforts,The Good Girland the underrated 2009 filmYouth in Revolt, Arteta casts well-known actors against type and allows them to develop their characters while showing off previously unexplored sides of their acting range. Even with actors that are well-known to mainstream audiences, Cedar Rapids flew under the radar, quietly slipping in and out of theatres in early 2011 while mediocrity continued its reign at the box office.Ed Helms plays Tim Lippe, an insurance agent for Brown Star Insurance in Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Tim is a simple and nave, but good-hearted man, completely out of touch with the modern world. He is ""pre-engaged"" to his seventh-grade teacher Macy Vanderhei (Sigourney Weaver) and is oblivious to the world outside of Brown Valley. After a co-worker dies under mysterious circumstances, Tim's boss, Bill Krogstad (Stephen Root), sends him to Cedar Rapids, Iowa to represent the agency and claim the prestigious Two Diamonds Award. Upon his arrival, Tim befriends fellow insurance agents Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and the hard-partying Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly), while finding himself smitten with Joan (Anne Heche). Yielding both hilarious and heartfelt results, Tim is introduced to situations he never imagined he'd find in Brown Valley, Wisconsin.Other familiar faces include Kurtwood Smith (as the ultra-religious president of the convention) and Rob Corddry (in a short, but amusing cameo). Probably the most light-hearted film Arteta has directed, some will still label it a ""dark comedy"" due to its willingness to disregard political correctness and develop characters truthfully. I've often thought of Arteta as ""Alexander Payne-lite"" as his distinct, off-beat style seems cut from the same stylistic cloth as the films of Alexander Payne. This similarity was never more apparent to me while watching Cedar Rapids and I was surprised to learn, when the credits rolled, that Payne and his frequent writing partner, Jim Taylor, are actually two of the film's producers. Arteta's direction and style lend a lot to the quality of the film, but that's not to diminish the influence of Phil Johnston's script, which made the 2009 Hollywood Blacklist of the best unproduced screenplays. The script is a marvel in the way it features strong, funny, and deeply human characters with only a so-so story to push them forward. There's nothing particularly bad about the script, it's just a fairly straight-forward story that reaches a fairly standard conclusion. This small criticism aside, it's still more touching and clever than any comedy I've seen this year.One must give credit to the terrific cast for frequently elevating the quality of the material. Helms doesn't get the chance to expand his range very much with Tim, but he does offer another side of the introverted, passive, and awkward character he's made his name playing before. Whitlock Jr. almost steals the show with his performance as Ronald, possibly being the only actor (or person even) who can elicit a laugh from saying ""The HBO series `The Wire.'"" Heche does a nice turn with her role, as does Weaver, who brings more class and humor to her small role than most actresses would have. There is a lot of talent in front of the camera, but Reilly's performance alone is enough for me to recommend the film. Loud, rude and hilariously funny, Reilly brings enough comedic energy, heart, and colorful use of the English language to make a separate film.Cedar Rapids is an intelligent, low-key film that quietly sneaks up on you and charms with an equal amount of heart and wit. It's much more satisfying and genuinely funny than a large percentage of Hollywood comedies being pushed into local cinemas each week and it boasts a terrific cast doing some fantastic, dynamic work.  It fits more heart and humor into its 87-minute running time than most big comedies do with more than twice that.GRADE: B+",4,"A Clever, Touching Comedy",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,4192,"['Cedar', 'Rapids', 'sweet', 'never', 'sappy', 'comedy', 'director', 'Miguel', 'Arteta', 'who', 'small', 'films', 'usually', 'comedies', 'are', 'almost', 'anti-Hollywood', 'way', 'allow', 'humor', 'come', 'naturally', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'rather', 'contrived', 'jokes', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Good', 'Girland', 'underrated', '2009', 'filmYouth', 'Revolt', 'Arteta', 'well-known', 'actors', 'type', 'develop', 'characters', 'showing', 'off', 'previously', 'unexplored', 'sides', 'acting', 'range', 'Even', 'actors', 'are', 'well-known', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'flew', 'radar', 'quietly', 'slipping', 'theatres', 'early', '2011', 'mediocrity', 'continued', 'reign', 'box', 'office.Ed', 'Helms', 'Tim', 'Lippe', 'insurance', 'agent', 'Brown', 'Star', 'Insurance', 'Brown', 'Valley', 'Wisconsin', 'Tim', 'simple', 'nave', 'good-hearted', 'man', 'completely', 'touch', 'modern', 'world', 'pre-engaged', 'seventh-grade', 'teacher', 'Macy', 'Vanderhei', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'oblivious', 'world', 'Brown', 'Valley', 'co-worker', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Tim', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Krogstad', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'Iowa', 'represent', 'agency', 'claim', 'prestigious', 'Two', 'Diamonds', 'Award', 'arrival', 'Tim', 'fellow', 'insurance', 'agents', 'Ronald', 'Wilkes', 'Isiah', 'Whitlock', 'Jr.', 'hard-partying', 'Dean', 'Ziegler', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'finding', 'smitten', 'Joan', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Yielding', 'hilarious', 'heartfelt', 'results', 'Tim', 'introduced', 'situations', 'never', 'imagined', ""'d"", 'find', 'Brown', 'Valley', 'Wisconsin.Other', 'familiar', 'include', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'ultra-religious', 'president', 'convention', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'short', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'Probably', 'most', 'light-hearted', 'film', 'Arteta', 'directed', 'will', 'still', 'label', 'dark', 'comedy', 'due', 'willingness', 'disregard', 'political', 'correctness', 'develop', 'characters', 'truthfully', ""'ve"", 'often', 'thought', 'Arteta', 'Alexander', 'Payne-lite', 'distinct', 'off-beat', 'style', 'cut', 'same', 'stylistic', 'cloth', 'films', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'similarity', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'watching', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'Payne', 'frequent', 'writing', 'partner', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'film', 'producers', 'Arteta', 'direction', 'style', 'lend', 'lot', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'diminish', 'influence', 'Phil', 'Johnston', 'script', 'made', '2009', 'Hollywood', 'Blacklist', 'best', 'unproduced', 'screenplays', 'script', 'marvel', 'way', 'strong', 'funny', 'deeply', 'human', 'characters', 'only', 'so-so', 'story', 'push', 'forward', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'bad', 'script', 'just', 'fairly', 'straight-forward', 'story', 'fairly', 'standard', 'conclusion', 'small', 'criticism', 'aside', 'still', 'more', 'touching', 'clever', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.One', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'terrific', 'cast', 'frequently', 'elevating', 'quality', 'material', 'Helms', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'expand', 'range', 'very', 'much', 'Tim', 'offer', 'side', 'introverted', 'passive', 'awkward', 'character', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'Whitlock', 'Jr.', 'almost', 'show', 'performance', 'Ronald', 'possibly', 'being', 'only', 'actor', 'person', 'even', 'who', 'can', 'elicit', 'laugh', 'saying', 'HBO', 'series', 'Wire', 'Heche', 'nice', 'turn', 'role', 'Weaver', 'who', 'more', 'class', 'humor', 'small', 'role', 'most', 'actresses', 'would', 'have', 'lot', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'Reilly', 'performance', 'alone', 'enough', 'recommend', 'film', 'Loud', 'rude', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'Reilly', 'enough', 'comedic', 'energy', 'heart', 'colorful', 'use', 'English', 'language', 'make', 'separate', 'film.Cedar', 'Rapids', 'intelligent', 'low-key', 'film', 'quietly', 'up', 'charms', 'equal', 'amount', 'heart', 'wit', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'large', 'percentage', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'being', 'pushed', 'local', 'cinemas', 'week', 'terrific', 'cast', 'doing', 'fantastic', 'dynamic', 'work', 'more', 'heart', 'humor', '87-minute', 'running', 'time', 'most', 'big', 'comedies', 'do', 'more', 'twice', 'that.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

1431611,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004X8AIE8,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","It seems that every now and then a small movie makes big noise. They're usually an independent film that was made for almost no money, if they're lucky they get a star or two and they become noticed at film festivals. CLERKS was one such film and so was LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. So when I heard that CEDAR RAPIDS was this years talked about indie film I wondered if it was true or not. Yes, the movie lives up to its reputation. It's hilarious.Ed Helms (of HANGOVER and THE OFFICE fame) stars as Tim Lippe, a modest insurance salesman in a small town who was destined for great things but never seemed to get there. His life is rather hum drum, he's never been anywhere outside of this small town and the thrill of his life is his girlfriend Macy (Sigourney Weaver), his old 7th grade teacher.Currently he plays second fiddle to Roger, the top guy who has always represented the company well at the national convention, bringing them back 2 Double Diamond trophies in a row. When Roger is found hung with his own belt in an act of autoerotic asphyxiation, Tim is selected as his replacement. The company's owner Bill (Stephen Root) gives him advice and books him in a room with a safe fellow insurance salesman.Unfortunately the best laid plans...His roommate Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.) and he are upgraded to a suite since the hotel overbooked. Unfortunately they have to take in a third party and that person is Dean Zeigler (John C. Reilly), a wild man that Bill warned Tim to stay away from. As is usually the case, Dean isn't quite as bad as Bill made him out to be even if he is a horn dog and a guy who likes to have far too much fun.As the threesome gets acquainted they're joined by Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Anne Heche), another insurance salesperson who knows everyone but Tim. The four become fast friends as the film progresses and find themselves in various predicaments.As Tim attempts to become one of the boys, he finds friendships tested and his morals questioned due to a twist in his plans he didn't account for. He finds himself forced to question a few of his beliefs, to open himself up to the world outside of his small town and to basically grow up. Through it all he makes some fantastic life long friends.I know, an insurance salesman convention doesn't sound like the most interesting thing on the planet. But the fact is that these characters are likeable, crazy, fun, interesting and more complex than you would think. The spots they find themselves in are funny at times and touching at others. These characters are ones you'd like to have a drink with.The film offers some great writing and directing as both bring out the best in these actors. I've not seen Heche do a character as well as she does Joan, a woman in what could be a loveless marriage who makes the convention a time to let loose. Reilly has this character down pat having played similar ones before. There was no way anyone else could have played this character. And Whitlock does a great turn here as a straight laced salesman who has a side he rarely lets anyone else see.But the central character here of Tim as played by Helms is great. He could have gone for goofy, he could have overdone the aw shucks attitude. But Helms plays it straighter than that and the character of Tim Lippe is better off for it.

1431612,A1MC5IOX5OPF4X,B004X8AIE8,". ""mattb123""","[3, 5]","Cedar Rapids is a decent 90-minute getaway comedy for not having to think too hard, and full of quirky ""low-brow"" laughs.  Although this same director made somewhat darker films ""The Good Girl"" and ""Chuck & Buck,"" Cedar Rapids doesn't necessarily have the same cerebral feel as those films.  ""Rapids"" stars Ed Helms (The Office's ""Andy"") as insurance agent ""Tim Lippe,"" with a supporting cast of John C. Reilly, Sigourney Weaver, and Anne Heche.  Although the plot makes an attempt for original and quirky subject matter, it is ultimately pretty ""low-brow"" humor and is similar to other recent John C. Reily comedies and those like ""the 40-year-old Virgin.""Helms' character is similar to his on ""Office"" in terms of his heart and enthusiasm - but Helm's character here is also an extremely ""wide-eyed"" and naive character from a small-town (e.g. has never been on a plane before or travelled far from home, believes in good-old-fashioned values, is intimidated by women, and of course believes strongly in the inherent integrity of his work and his fellow insurance agents).  As the movie begins, circumstances contrive to put all the pressure on ""Lippe"" to deliver THE BIG PRESENTATION at the BIG out-of-town Insurance Convention and thereby continue the string of awards and prestige for his local agency(but exactly to what end!??).As implied, there's a lot of the funny crude humor full of sex jokes and Reiley's fast-taking satire about life and at the expense of others (there's also perhaps a bit too large proportion of middle-aged white guys wearing nothing but towels...but again that's all part of the humor). ""Rapids"" features a pretty strong cast and good comedic performances - in addition to Helms, Reiley, Hesch, Weaver, it's full of other faces one will recognize from various TV and movies.  While not a Farley Brothers Movie (""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""Kingpin,"" ""Something about Mary"") Cedar Rapids seems somewhat influenced by their type of movies in that it provides the characters with possibly life-changing quandaries, and makes an attempt at having genuine ""heart.""  I wouldn't call the humor extremely original - it's more full of small chuckles than non-stop huge guffaws.  Perhaps what sets it apart is a somewhat quirky subject matter as well as the ""all-for-one & one-for-all"" bond that develops among the main characters (all of whom are a bit ""down on their luck"" in life).  Also props for keeping it to a somewhat short & sweet at 90 minutes - with a few added ""out-take"" type scenes while the credits role.C.R.'s ultimately a well-cast and amusing comedy.",3,Worthwhile Amusing Comedy,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2583,"['Cedar', 'Rapids', 'decent', '90-minute', 'getaway', 'comedy', 'not', 'having', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'full', 'quirky', 'low-brow', 'laughs', 'same', 'director', 'made', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'films', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'same', 'cerebral', 'feel', 'films', 'Rapids', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Office', 'Andy', 'insurance', 'agent', 'Tim', 'Lippe', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'plot', 'attempt', 'original', 'quirky', 'subject', 'matter', 'ultimately', 'pretty', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'similar', 'other', 'recent', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'comedies', '40-year-old', 'Virgin', 'Helms', 'character', 'similar', 'Office', 'terms', 'heart', 'enthusiasm', 'Helm', 'character', 'here', 'also', 'extremely', 'wide-eyed', 'naive', 'character', 'small-town', 'e.g', 'never', 'been', 'plane', 'travelled', 'far', 'home', 'good-old-fashioned', 'values', 'intimidated', 'women', 'course', 'strongly', 'inherent', 'integrity', 'work', 'fellow', 'insurance', 'agents', 'movie', 'circumstances', 'contrive', 'put', 'pressure', 'Lippe', 'deliver', 'THE', 'BIG', 'PRESENTATION', 'BIG', 'out-of-town', 'Insurance', 'Convention', 'thereby', 'continue', 'string', 'awards', 'prestige', 'local', 'agency', 'exactly', 'what', 'end', '.As', 'implied', 'lot', 'funny', 'crude', 'humor', 'full', 'sex', 'jokes', 'Reiley', 'fast-taking', 'satire', 'life', 'expense', 'others', 'also', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'large', 'proportion', 'middle-aged', 'white', 'guys', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'towels', 'again', 'part', 'humor', 'Rapids', 'pretty', 'strong', 'cast', 'good', 'comedic', 'performances', 'addition', 'Helms', 'Reiley', 'Hesch', 'Weaver', 'full', 'other', 'one', 'will', 'recognize', 'various', 'TV', 'movies', 'not', 'Farley', 'Brothers', 'Movie', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Kingpin', 'Something', 'about', 'Mary', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'somewhat', 'influenced', 'type', 'movies', 'characters', 'possibly', 'life-changing', 'quandaries', 'attempt', 'having', 'genuine', 'heart', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'humor', 'extremely', 'original', 'more', 'full', 'small', 'chuckles', 'non-stop', 'huge', 'guffaws', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'apart', 'somewhat', 'quirky', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'well', 'all-for-one', 'one-for-all', 'bond', 'main', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'bit', 'down', 'luck', 'life', 'Also', 'keeping', 'somewhat', 'short', 'sweet', '90', 'minutes', 'few', 'added', 'out-take', 'type', 'scenes', 'credits', 'role.C.R', 'ultimately', 'well-cast', 'amusing', 'comedy']",N/A

1431628,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B004X8AIE8,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","""Know thyself"" may be the world's oldest maxim. Unfortunately, Cedar Rapids, the heartland comedy about self-discovery directed by Miguel Arteta, forgets that vital chestnut, and ultimately misses greatness. It's a shame because the movie has one of the best ensemble casts any comedy could ask for.Ed Helms of The Hangover movies plays a lowly insurance salesman named Tim Lippe in the fictional town of Brown Valley, Wis., which he has never left thanks to serious abandonment issues. Tim's simple joys -- he's the most innocent comedic hero since The 40-Year Old Virgin's Andy Stitzer -- come from serving customers honestly and making weekly love to his former seventh-grade teacher (Sigourney Weaver).Mostly, Tim toils away earnestly for Brown Star Insurance. Famed as much for its Christian values as for its high-quality service, the firm has won three consecutive Two Diamond awards, a coveted industry prize handed out at the annual insurance convention in the metropolis of Cedar Rapids. This is one of those gatherings where attendees speak reverently of a competitor having ""the sixth biggest agency in the upper Midwest."" Just before the convention, Brown Star's star agent dies, which is bad enough, but the dubious circumstances of his death have made it both impossible and imperative that the company win this year's trophy ... and it's up to Tim to save Brown Star.For anyone else, a trip to Cedar Rapids would be an exercise in escaping tedium, but Tim might as well be heading to Spring Break in Cancun. In the span of two days, Tim meets a dizzying cast of friends, competitors and enemies; John C. Reilly, Anne Heche and The Wire's Isiah Whitlock Jr. stand out in their supporting roles. But one wishes that the writers could have done more with Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development).Despite some gut-busting scenes, Cedar Rapids isn't quite sure what it supposed to be. It has elements of a sex farce, a buddy movie, a Michael J. Fox small-town-boy-makes-good-in-the-big-city flick, a satire of small-time corporate hypocrisy along the lines of the vastly superior Election, and a romantic comedy. Thanks to the stellar cast, we care about the characters as the movie whisks along. Helms proves his comic chops but also plumbs surprising depths of pathos as his illusions of love and integrity are shattered; he's a good enough actor to stay with this funny but uneven movie, and that's paying him high praise.DVD extras include deleted scenes, a gag reel and a few making-of segments.Review originally appeared on [...].",4,An uneven comedy saved by the cast,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,2581,"['Know', 'may', 'be', 'world', 'oldest', 'maxim', 'Unfortunately', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'heartland', 'comedy', 'self-discovery', 'directed', 'Miguel', 'Arteta', 'vital', 'chestnut', 'ultimately', 'greatness', 'shame', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'comedy', 'could', 'ask', 'for.Ed', 'Helms', 'Hangover', 'movies', 'lowly', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'named', 'Tim', 'Lippe', 'fictional', 'town', 'Brown', 'Valley', 'Wis.', 'never', 'left', 'thanks', 'serious', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'Tim', 'simple', 'joys', 'most', 'innocent', 'comedic', 'hero', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', 'come', 'serving', 'customers', 'honestly', 'making', 'weekly', 'love', 'former', 'seventh-grade', 'teacher', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', '.Mostly', 'Tim', 'away', 'earnestly', 'Brown', 'Star', 'Insurance', 'Famed', 'much', 'Christian', 'values', 'high-quality', 'service', 'firm', 'won', 'three', 'consecutive', 'Two', 'Diamond', 'awards', 'coveted', 'industry', 'prize', 'handed', 'out', 'annual', 'insurance', 'convention', 'metropolis', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'one', 'gatherings', 'where', 'attendees', 'speak', 'reverently', 'competitor', 'having', 'sixth', 'biggest', 'agency', 'upper', 'Midwest', 'Just', 'convention', 'Brown', 'Star', 'star', 'agent', 'dies', 'bad', 'enough', 'dubious', 'circumstances', 'death', 'have', 'made', 'impossible', 'imperative', 'company', 'win', 'year', 'trophy', 'up', 'Tim', 'save', 'Brown', 'Star.For', 'anyone', 'else', 'trip', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'would', 'be', 'exercise', 'escaping', 'tedium', 'Tim', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'heading', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Cancun', 'span', 'two', 'days', 'Tim', 'dizzying', 'cast', 'friends', 'competitors', 'enemies', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Wire', 'Isiah', 'Whitlock', 'Jr.', 'stand', 'out', 'supporting', 'roles', 'one', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Arrested', 'Development', '.Despite', 'gut-busting', 'scenes', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'elements', 'sex', 'farce', 'buddy', 'movie', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'small-town-boy-makes-good-in-the-big-city', 'flick', 'satire', 'small-time', 'corporate', 'hypocrisy', 'lines', 'vastly', 'superior', 'Election', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Thanks', 'stellar', 'cast', 'care', 'characters', 'movie', 'along', 'Helms', 'comic', 'chops', 'also', 'plumbs', 'surprising', 'depths', 'pathos', 'illusions', 'love', 'integrity', 'are', 'shattered', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'stay', 'funny', 'uneven', 'movie', 'paying', 'high', 'praise.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'few', 'making-of', 'segments.Review', 'originally', 'appeared', '[', ']']",N/A

Both films have protagonists who work in the insurance industry. Schmidt is an insurance actuary and Ed Helms, who plays Tim Lippe in 'Cedar Rapids', is an insurance agent. Both films are set in the Midwest with 'Schmidt' set in Omaha, Nebraska and 'Cedar Rapids' in Iowa.Director Miguel Arteta improves on the smugness of Payne's Schmidt character by making his Tim Lippe protagonist much more likable. Even the principal antagonist of the piece, President Helgesson (played by the always solid Kurtwood Smith) hardly seems offensive at all (just about the worst thing he does is take a $1500 bribe from Tim). As usually is the case with these quirky indie comedies or farces, the quirky protagonist must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo. Here, Tim partners with his lovable loser insurance agents, and thwarts his greedy boss who plans to sell Tim's Blue Diamond Insurance Company (another example of a conservative group getting their comeuppance at the hands of a quirky outsider are the beauty pageant officials in 'Little Miss Sunshine').'Cedar Rapids' can be viewed as a farcical variation on the classic 'buddy' picture, 'The Wizard of Oz'. Ed Helms plays the 'Dorothy' character whose life is thrown in disarray when he's sent on an assignment to Cedar Rapids, to ensure that his insurance company wins the prized 'Two Diamond Award' for a third year in a row. Ultimately he seeks to return home restored to a state of equilibrium after visiting Cedar Rapids, an 'Emerald City' which he is dazzled by (Nerdy and nave Tim has never even seen a card key to open a hotel door). Along the way, Tim meets three allies who aid him in his quest, similar to the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion from 'Oz'.Tim needs someone with some 'brains' to overcome his childish infatuations. When he's dumped by Macy, the older girlfriend played by Sigourney Weaver, Anne Heche, adopting the Scarecrow role as bold housewife Joan, appeals to Tim's intellect and manages to help him reflect on his behavior, and actually calm him down to the point where he's able to function more like an adult.Isiah Whitlock as Ronald Wilkes, is similar to the Tin Man, as he ultimately turns out to have a big heart. Wilkes saves Tim after he's knocked down and assaulted at the party, an 'inmost cave' where the group battles dark forces (in terms of 'Oz', the Wicked Witch's castle comes to mind). Whitlock has his best scene in the film when he pretends to be a bad-ass from the ghetto, as opposed to revealing his true demeanor as a mild mannered insurance agent.Finally, there's John C. Reilly as Zeigler, the 'Cowardly Lion' who has the 'nerve' and 'courage' to encourage Tim to just be himself. Like the 'Cowardly Lion' in Oz, Zeigler provides the comic relief throughout the film, constantly challenging the status quo by uttering one outrageous bon mot after another.President Helgesson might be the Wizard of the piece here, who leads Tim in the wrong direction by awarding The Two Diamond Award to Tim's company after he accepts the bribe. This is akin to Dorothy's fruitless quest for the Wicked Witch's broomstick. And just as the Wizard is 'found out', President Helgesson must be exposed in the end by Tim and his intrepid allies.'Cedar Rapids' wins points for following the classic story pattern of a hero's mythic journey, albeit told in a decidedly comic fashion. It's also pretty good natured, which is an improvement over Director Arteta's recent and rather cold effort, 'Youth in Revolt'. Nonetheless, 'Cedar' continues the unwholesome tradition of many quirky indie films--the protagonists, in their 'anything goes' behavior, are held up as morally superior to the antagonists, who are merely 'straw men', derided as either sexually perverse, greedy and/or emotionally repressed.If you dig Cedar's 'anything goes' philosophy, and you accept the simplistic premise that there is an inferior underclass of conservative reactionaries, this is a film that will warm you to the bone. Others , such as myself, will find these types of films to have a few amusing moments but ultimately too smug to be taken seriously.",2,Interesting Oz-like parallels masks smug critique of Midwest conservatives,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,4528,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5It', 'probably', 'coincidence', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'one', 'producers', 'new', 'quirky', 'farce', 'Rapids', 'chose', 'support', 'project', 'are', 'number', 'parallels', '2002', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'Schmidt', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'films', 'have', 'protagonists', 'who', 'work', 'insurance', 'industry', 'Schmidt', 'insurance', 'actuary', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'who', 'Tim', 'Lippe', ""'Cedar"", 'Rapids', 'insurance', 'agent', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'Midwest', ""'Schmidt"", 'set', 'Omaha', 'Nebraska', ""'Cedar"", 'Rapids', 'Iowa.Director', 'Miguel', 'Arteta', 'smugness', 'Payne', 'Schmidt', 'character', 'making', 'Tim', 'Lippe', 'protagonist', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'Even', 'principal', 'antagonist', 'piece', 'President', 'Helgesson', 'played', 'always', 'solid', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'hardly', 'offensive', 'just', 'worst', 'thing', 'take', '1500', 'bribe', 'Tim', 'usually', 'case', 'quirky', 'indie', 'comedies', 'farces', 'quirky', 'protagonist', 'must', 'go', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'shedding', 'repressed', 'upbringing', 'thwarting', 'goals', 'reactionary', 'group', 'maintain', 'status', 'quo', 'Here', 'Tim', 'partners', 'lovable', 'loser', 'insurance', 'agents', 'greedy', 'boss', 'who', 'sell', 'Tim', 'Blue', 'Diamond', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'example', 'conservative', 'group', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'hands', 'quirky', 'outsider', 'are', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'officials', ""'Little"", 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Rapids', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'farcical', 'variation', 'classic', ""'buddy"", 'picture', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Ed', 'Helms', ""'Dorothy"", 'character', 'life', 'thrown', 'disarray', 'when', 'sent', 'assignment', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', 'ensure', 'insurance', 'company', 'prized', 'Diamond', 'Award', 'third', 'year', 'row', 'Ultimately', 'return', 'home', 'restored', 'state', 'equilibrium', 'visiting', 'Cedar', 'Rapids', ""'Emerald"", 'City', 'dazzled', 'Nerdy', 'nave', 'Tim', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'card', 'key', 'open', 'hotel', 'door', 'way', 'Tim', 'three', 'allies', 'who', 'aid', 'quest', 'similar', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Lion', ""'Oz'.Tim"", 'someone', ""'brains"", 'overcome', 'childish', 'infatuations', 'When', 'dumped', 'Macy', 'older', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'adopting', 'Scarecrow', 'role', 'bold', 'housewife', 'Joan', 'appeals', 'Tim', 'intellect', 'help', 'reflect', 'behavior', 'actually', 'calm', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'able', 'function', 'more', 'adult.Isiah', 'Whitlock', 'Ronald', 'Wilkes', 'similar', 'Tin', 'Man', 'ultimately', 'out', 'have', 'big', 'heart', 'Wilkes', 'Tim', 'knocked', 'down', 'assaulted', 'party', ""'inmost"", 'cave', 'where', 'group', 'dark', 'forces', 'terms', ""'Oz"", 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'castle', 'mind', 'Whitlock', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'be', 'bad-ass', 'ghetto', 'opposed', 'revealing', 'true', 'demeanor', 'mild', 'mannered', 'insurance', 'agent.Finally', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Zeigler', ""'Cowardly"", 'Lion', 'who', ""'nerve"", ""'courage"", 'encourage', 'Tim', 'just', 'be', ""'Cowardly"", 'Lion', 'Oz', 'Zeigler', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'constantly', 'challenging', 'status', 'quo', 'uttering', 'one', 'outrageous', 'bon', 'mot', 'another.President', 'Helgesson', 'might', 'be', 'Wizard', 'piece', 'here', 'who', 'Tim', 'wrong', 'direction', 'awarding', 'Two', 'Diamond', 'Award', 'Tim', 'company', 'bribe', 'akin', 'Dorothy', 'fruitless', 'quest', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'broomstick', 'just', 'Wizard', ""'found"", 'President', 'Helgesson', 'must', 'be', 'exposed', 'end', 'Tim', 'intrepid', 'allies', 'Rapids', 'wins', 'points', 'following', 'classic', 'story', 'pattern', 'hero', 'mythic', 'journey', 'told', 'decidedly', 'comic', 'fashion', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'natured', 'improvement', 'Director', 'Arteta', 'recent', 'rather', 'cold', 'effort', 'Revolt', 'Nonetheless', ""'Cedar"", 'unwholesome', 'tradition', 'many', 'quirky', 'indie', 'films', 'protagonists', ""'anything"", 'behavior', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'morally', 'superior', 'antagonists', 'who', 'are', 'merely', ""'straw"", 'men', 'derided', 'sexually', 'perverse', 'greedy', 'and/or', 'emotionally', 'dig', 'Cedar', ""'anything"", 'philosophy', 'accept', 'simplistic', 'premise', 'inferior', 'underclass', 'conservative', 'reactionaries', 'film', 'will', 'warm', 'bone', 'Others', 'such', 'will', 'find', 'types', 'films', 'have', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'ultimately', 'too', 'smug', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously']",N/A
