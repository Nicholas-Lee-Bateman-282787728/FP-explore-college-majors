633154,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JNP1,,"[3, 3]","Million Dollar Baby is a multi- Oscar winning film directed by and starring Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood. This film follows a young woman who pursues her dream to make it big in the sport of boxing and achieves a great deal of success with Eastwood as her trainer.Eastwood directed this movie and he produces a winning formula on all counts. The main plot of this film involves a young woman who wants to become a champion boxer and wants Eastwood's character to be her trainer. There is also a subtle but important subplot involving the family lives of Eastwood and Swank. Both have problems with family members and they are both missing some important relationships in their lives. And in the end, they each fulfill the others relationship gap.This movie is well- directed, well- produced, and superbly acted. The standouts in the acting department include Hilary Swank in the role as Maggie; Morgan Freeman in the role as former boxer Eddie Dupris; and Eastwood himself in the role as Frankie Dunn. Swank's character is most memorable and the strength of her hard- nosed, yet friendly character won her an Oscar. Eastwood and Freeman's character provide some good contrast. They are different in their approach to boxing and their philosophy on success. They both love the sport they teach, but they approach it from different angles. Freeman captured the Oscar for his performance and Eastwood received a nomination.Yet another plus for this film is its lack of predictability. Sports films are, for the most part, easy to predict after a few minutes. You can usually tell which team or individual is going to reign victorious in the end. Sometimes, the predictable nature of sports movies lessens their appeal; other times, it doesn't matter. But in this movie, there isn't as much predictability and some of the turns of events will leave viewers surprised.Narrated by Morgan Freeman's character, Million Dollar Baby is a winning motion picture about life, victory, achievement, and loss. Its winning formula made it an excellent choice for the Best Picture Oscar in 2004. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend doing so immediately. It's a great film from Clint Eastwood.",5,Oscar Winning Sports Film from Clint Eastwood,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2187,"['Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'multi-', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'directed', 'starring', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'dream', 'make', 'big', 'sport', 'boxing', 'great', 'deal', 'success', 'Eastwood', 'trainer.Eastwood', 'directed', 'movie', 'winning', 'formula', 'counts', 'main', 'plot', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'become', 'champion', 'boxer', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'be', 'trainer', 'also', 'subtle', 'important', 'subplot', 'involving', 'family', 'Eastwood', 'Swank', 'have', 'problems', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'missing', 'important', 'relationships', 'lives', 'end', 'fulfill', 'others', 'relationship', 'gap.This', 'movie', 'well-', 'directed', 'well-', 'produced', 'superbly', 'acted', 'standouts', 'acting', 'department', 'include', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'role', 'Maggie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'role', 'former', 'boxer', 'Eddie', 'Dupris', 'Eastwood', 'role', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Swank', 'character', 'most', 'memorable', 'strength', 'hard-', 'nosed', 'yet', 'friendly', 'character', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'character', 'provide', 'good', 'contrast', 'are', 'different', 'approach', 'boxing', 'philosophy', 'success', 'love', 'sport', 'teach', 'approach', 'different', 'angles', 'Freeman', 'captured', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Eastwood', 'received', 'nomination.Yet', 'plus', 'film', 'lack', 'predictability', 'Sports', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'easy', 'predict', 'few', 'minutes', 'can', 'usually', 'tell', 'team', 'individual', 'going', 'reign', 'victorious', 'end', 'Sometimes', 'predictable', 'nature', 'sports', 'movies', 'lessens', 'appeal', 'other', 'times', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'predictability', 'turns', 'events', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'surprised.Narrated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'winning', 'motion', 'picture', 'life', 'victory', 'achievement', 'loss', 'winning', 'formula', 'made', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '2004', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'recommend', 'doing', 'so', 'immediately', 'great', 'film', 'Clint', 'Eastwood']",N/A
633155,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNP1,,"[3, 3]","The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director.  Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations.  In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his ""clients.""  The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world.  Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena.  Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on ""a girl"" for training purposes.  But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes.  The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.Even though ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film.  His narration (as it did also in this summer`s ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies.  And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama.  Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast.  As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here.  Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next.  Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future.  In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of nave sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life.  And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years.  Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a clich&eacute;-ridden tale into a work of art.Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date.",5,beautifully realized drama,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,3489,"['thing', 'most', 'watching', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'just', 'how', 'confident', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'become', 'director', 'Armed', 'good', 'story', 'drama', 'unfold', 'own', 'pace', 'never', 'feeling', 'need', 'fancy', 'up', 'hurry', 'cater', 'audience', 'expectations', 'fact', 'key', 'area', 'masterful', 'film', 'finds', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'actor', 'top', 'form.Eastwood', 'plays', 'Frank', 'Dunn', 'aging', 'boxer-turned-trainer', 'who', 'yet', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'clients', 'gym', 'seedy', 'part', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'more', 'watering', 'hole', 'outcasts', 'misfits', 'launching', 'pad', 'next', 'welter-', 'middle-', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'gym', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'wide-eyed', 'girl', 'Ozarks', 'dreams', 'making', 'big', 'arena', 'Even', 'set', 'sights', 'Dunn', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'teach', 'Dunn', 'clear', 'absolutely', 'interest', 'taking', 'girl', 'training', 'purposes', 'when', 'determination', 'fiery', 'spirit', 'however', 'reluctantly', 'show', 'ropes', 'film', 'account', 'warm', 'relationship', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'contact', 'own', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'sees', 'Maggie', 'only', 'subconsciously', 'chance', 'make', 'kind', 'amends', 'own', 'sins', 'feisty', 'full-hearted', 'girl', 'hills.Even', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'earmarks', 'typical', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movie', 'film', 'far', 'genre', 'excellence', 'screenplay', 'performances', 'Eastwood', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'role', 'former', 'boxer', 'Dunn', 'closest', 'friend', 'voice', 'practicality', 'reason', 'film', 'narration', 'did', 'also', 'summer', 's', 'War', 'Worlds', 'March', 'Penguins', 'film', 'gravitas', 'classicism', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd.Basing', 'screenplay', 'stories', 'Rope', 'Burns', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'written', 'dialogue', 'astute', 'dramatic', 'authentic', 'far', 'more', 'literate', 'what', 'are', 'accustomed', 'finding', 'most', 'mainstream', 'American', 'movies', 'direction', 'Eastwood', 'just', 'right', 'rhythm', 'speech', 'draw', 'audience', 'center', 'drama', 'course', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'achieve', 'level', 'greatness', 'evoking', 'strong', 'performances', 'assembled', 'cast', 'actor', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'Gruff', 'cantankerous', 'one', 'moment', 'tender', 'warmhearted', 'next', 'Dunn', 'many', 'deep-seated', 'regrets', 'past', 'even', 'choices', 'have', 'rendered', 'virtually', 'alone', 'world', 'still', 'remain', 'decent', 'treatment', 'others', 'optimistic', 'future', 'second', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Swank', 'just', 'right', 'mixture', 'nave', 'sweetness', 'openhearted', 'frankness', 'unquenchable', 'determination', 'bring', 'Margaret', 'vivid', 'life', 'Freeman', 'always', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'performance', 'man', 'quiet', 'perceptions', 'whom', 'Dunn', 'leaned', 'guidance', 'advice', 'nigh', 'unto', 'thirty', 'years', 'Together', 'amazing', 'ensemble', 'molds', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'tale', 'work', 'art.Beautiful', 'pacing', 'exquisite', 'details', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'question', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'film', 'date']",N/A

Eastwood is fast becoming not only a towering icon of Americana (which he has been for years), but a graceful one, willing to express through his art, the toll of life and the perspective of an old man in a brutal world. Because Eastwood is so associated with violence to me, it is becoming to see his compassionate and painful Million Dollar Baby.I knew this was about a woman boxer, the classic mentor/protege story, but didn't expect it to take the turns it did, nor for the amazing performances from the films big three: Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Without a doubt the scenes between Eastwood and Freeman were the best, so deep that I had flashes like I was watching a Neil Simon scene from The Sunshine Boys, or Unforgiven, or two old dogs scrap and tussle, only to recognize they are best friends, brothers even....There were also sniffles toward the end of this film. I would highly recommend this film. To see the face of grief and compassion and grit that is Eastwood, a passionate and strong performance from Swank and Freeman's continuing proof that he is one of America's best film actors, capable of communicating without doing much of anything, losing the identity of Morgan Freeman, becoming Eddie.See Million Dollar Baby to see the work of life, pay-offs and let-downs, what taking your chances with dreams can do, the guilt and responsibility and joy of parenting/training/loving/protecting.

Plus, this movie is burdened with a very stupid name. But it's a Clint Eastwood film about a female boxer, played by Hilary Swank, which received rave reviews from a large number of my Advanced English Writing students back in China. I bought this maybe two years ago, or maybe even longer ago than that. Finally, I watched it.First thought. Clint has the ability to portray so much with an economy of effort that you can forget he's a damn fine actor.Macho philosophy in quotable bite-sized nuggets. Okay, we have those.Understated humor. Yep, got that.Clint Eastwood as a gruff misfit who's really a soft touch. Yep, got that.Morgan Freeman as the sidekick you wish you had. Yep, got that.Whenever something really interests Clint as a movie maker, he will make you see why. We have an analysis of boxing that makes me say, ""Welcome to the gym."" You feel it on a level where words fail to express it. I almost understand why people are interested in participating. Almost. Why people watch a damn bloodsport will always remain beyond me.And then, even though I knew from my students' writing that this was going to wind up raising the question of euthanasia, and that Clint shares my sentiments about it, I was wholly unprepared for the way it broke my heart. This has got to be the saddest movie I've seen in... well, maybe ever. If it doesn't break your heart, you don't have one.It deserves every award it won or was nominated for, and I'm glad I saw it once.

But Million Dollar Baby surpasses them all in the grandest of ways.  Amazon's featured reviewer hits the nail on the head.  In an age where American cinema seems to require no plot or feeling, only massive budgets and over-the-top explosions, this simple film marks a return to the days when movies could actually mean something, could make you walk away in amazes, and not because you didn't see that side-winding plot twist coming, but because you had just witnessed something so real and candid, so full of loss and so exemplary of human existence that it shook to the core your meaning of what it is to be alive.  And isn't that the intention of art, a truer reflection of life?The plot is uncomplicated and I'll avoid repeating it.  Suffice it to say that Eastwood and Swank both portray characters that seemingly have nothing left in life.  Not only has Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) just been dumped by his boxing prot&eacute;g&eacute; due to a perceived lack of trust on his part, but he also finds himself hopelessly estranged from his daughter, and every desperate letter he sends to her, self-returned, always finds its way back to his doorstep.  We're never told how long this has been going on or the reasons why, but it seems as if this has played out over the course of lonely and bitter lifetimes.  Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) has fled from her life at home and like all young people, has only one dream - that her life can actually mean something.  She waits tables, pocketing any edible scraps that might sustain her hunger at night, and in a poignant and at times almost unbearably sincere narration, Morgan Freeman's Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris tells us what is at the foundation of the force that drives Maggie in her quest for greatness.  Her entire life, he tells us, she's known only one thing: ""she was trash.""And so as Frankie gradually warms to the idea of coaching a girl boxer and Maggie ascends into greatness, effectively becoming the Great Irish Hope, they develop something their lives have lacked for so long.  For Frankie, Maggie is the daughter who actually admires him, who sees that beneath his ruff exterior and crackling voice lies a man who for years has lived in a bevy of self-guilt, a man who more than needs someone to love him, needs someone to love.  For Maggie, Frankie is the rebirth of the father who sheltered her from the consciousness of her painful reality.  Factor in  ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, haunted by his early years as a black man shedding blood for the bigots in Mississippi and searching for the remnants of his lost career in a mentally handicapped young man who, abandoned on the streets by his step-father, has taken to the idea of becoming a boxer, and calls himself ""Danger,"" and what you have is three people who, through one another, all see the golden opportunity to reinvent their lives and escape their mutual clouds of solitude.  But life rarely makes such a task simple.Most of the people who find themselves disappointed with Million Dollar Baby watched the film in hopes of seeing another epic boxing story along the lines of Rocky, only with a female lead.

I enjoyed his last film ""Mystic River"" and was happy to see it receive such praise. But, ""Million Dollar Baby"" just came into the night, no one knew anything about it, and I thought, honestly how good could a boxing movie be?Then the critics rallied behind this movie just as strongly as they have been the sadly overrated ""Sideways"". Roger Ebert and all three of the NY Times critics placed it on their ""top ten"" list. Two of them placed it at number one. And of course the recent news that the film has won seven Oscar nominations and thus opened to more screen also provoked me to see this film.""Million Dollar Baby"" first of all, is NOT a boxing movie in the traditional sense. Yes, there are boxing scenes, but, the movie is really about so many other things and has an amazing twist in its third act. The film is about hopes, dreams, courage, friendship, love and many other things that I can't give away here.The film has an almost breezy effect. I didn't even realize when the first hour and 40 minutes went by. The film takes its time setting up characters and the plot. Infact, you couldn't seperate the two. This is one of those character driven movies. It's not really about the plot but the emotion we feel for the characters.Eastwood has so effectively paced the film. It has a lyrical feel to it.But for as good as ""Million Dollar Baby' is, it does have some flaws. First of all the film's last act goes on a bit too long. Here Eastwood and the screenwriter are ""milking"" the situation for all it's worth. They are doing this so the emotion connection will be strong, but, by the time the events do happen. we're hooked. We've been hooked from the first 10 minutes. The film could have been shorten 15 minutes and still retain the power is does.I've heard people find the film depressing, why? I find it to be a 'feel good movie'. I had a warm feeling while watching it. I came to feel as if I knew the characters. I was put in a very good mood.Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hiliary Swank are all believeable in their roles. We never for a moment say to ourselves, ""hey, there's Clint!"" No, we accept them as the characters. This is the film's major strenght.And about those seven Oscar nominations. I really don't think any of them are deserved. Now, that doesn't mean I don't like the film. A movie doesn't have to win or get nominated for an award to be good. I hope people don't need to have a film win an award to appreciate it.""Million Dollar Baby"" is a knockout.

Eastwood himself stars as Frankie,a boxer who runs a gym. He ""doesn't train girls"" but the determined Maggie (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion. Morgan Freeman stars as Eastwood's mentor&friend.; Their relationship shows that true friendship transcends race. Freeman is an excellent actor; unfortunately, his near-constant voice-over gets intrusive&heavy-handed.; Eastwood,show,don't tell!Frankie is as determined as Maggie- he wants to win at any cost- and he pays the price. He exploits Maggie for the money, even pitting her against a famously brutal female boxer known for cheating. Frankie knowingly endangers Maggie&she; naively accepts the challenge. However, Frank does have a conscience. He is repulsed whenever Maggie tells him to ""put her down"" if she is seriously injured.""Million Dollar Baby"" shows the seamy underside of female boxing. Boxing between men has an air of legitimacy, while female boxers live in a world of exploitation, treated as freaks. It also comes across as homoerotic. It's no wonder Maggie's redneck mother tells her to ""get a man""-but maybe Maggie prefers being surrounded by bikini-clad babes&battling; more muscular ones.""Million Dollar Baby"" is controversial because of it's ""death with dignity"" theme. The young priest warns Frank that if he puts Maggie out of her misery,it will lead to more tragedy. It's not a solution. The priest's prophecy comes true. Frank gives Maggie the lethal injection- and exiles himself from the human community. He doesn't live ""happily ever after."" On the other hand, Freeman's character is happily reunited with the boxer whose life he saved. Choosing life is redemptive. Some have painted ""Million Dollar Baby"" as propaganda. One wonders if they actually watched the movie, or if they're merely parroting what talk show hosts told them.""Million Dollar Baby"" has excellent acting,a beautiful score.

633163,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,B00005JNP1,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[34, 79]","What a pathetic movie this is. Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" starts off very well, and for the first half of the film we see a very good portrayal of the rags-to-riches grit of a girl on the wrong side of the tracks making it big as a female boxer. Then, all of a sudden, Eastwood writes in what has to be THE most improbable, impossible, off-the-wall twist which could never happen in the boxing ring, and turns this movie into a third-rate, paraplegic-boxer-seeks-euthanasia melodrama. I have to tell you, as a boxing fan, who has seen some of the greatest fights in history, such as Hagler-Hearns and also, incidentally, the fight between Ray ""Boom-Boom"" Mancini and Duk-Koo Kim, who died of a compound concussion after that fight (which originally caused boxing to go from 15 rounds to 12 in championship matches), this Million Dollar Baby story could never happen in the ring and HAS never happened. It is so ridiculous a premise that it's pathetic. Hillary Swank's opponent would have been disqualified several rounds earlier for obvious dirty fighting, and I don't know of any fighter in history who has been rendered a paraplegic from a sucker punch after falling on a stool. Good movies are supposed to be inspiring and beautiful (at least most of the time). I advise all movie fans, especially those who are also sports and boxing fans, to skip this depressing and self-indulgent film.

It seems that the point I was trying to make has been missed for the most part, so I'll try and reiterate.This is an excellent movie from the point of view of acting, direction, and script, and as I predicted it did of course win 4 oscars recently, to rubberstamp that viewpoint, most desevedly and notably for Hilary Swanks incredible performance.All that said however, the movie is slow to start, often plodding in dialogue and continuity in places, and regardless of how masterfully portrayed, it's a very depressing picture. As previously stated, Eastwood has of late immersed his directing (and acting talents here) into the stark realities of human nature in their most raw and naked state, arguably having a free reign like most other renowned directors, by not being entrenched in hollywood ""crowd pleasers"" as if caring less about the financial success or failure of the picture at the box office.Clint plays Frankie Dunn, a long time boxing manager and expert corner man ""from the old days"" as narrated by Morgan Freeman who is desperately embittered with an approaching old age laced with regret and emotional torment. His current title hope ditches him for a high flying competitor, his estranged daughter returns all of his letters unopened, his priest admonishes his cantankorous debating, and Freeman is an uneasy friend/employee and former talent who was blinded in one eye after his last fight (something which Frankie also blames himself for). Enter Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30 something down to earth woman encumbered with a past of zero opportunity, and humble but tangible dreams, despite her trailer park family ties. Her desire to follow her dreams to box, and her tenacity and stubborness eventually win over Frankie who decides to train her after initially refusing several times, and against his better judgement. What follows is a symbiotic relationship on which both characters thrive, she becoming a surrogate for his own estranged daughter, and he a surrogate for her dead father whom she admired and misses terribly.The movie turns from this point into a rags to riches to rags picture, with a sombre tone that whilst being absorbing actually leaves you feeling pretty miserable. I'm not criticizing the flavor of the film, but even the most ardent of human drama fans will find the lack of ANY levity to be amiss. Combining euthenasia into the story adds more fuel to the sobriety of everything, and regardless of your political or moral affiliations on the subject, most will agree that too many plot holes, and unlikely inconsistencies make the ending seem unecessarily protracted.I have always been a fan of Eastwood, both as an actor and director, and have seen most, if not all of his movies, and rarely have a bad word to say, because even the most sombre of topics has been balanced, lifted where necessary, or even had funny moments. ""Lightening"" the subject does not mean that the viewer will take the subject  lightly, and although a movie does not have to be a comedy to be entertaining, it shouldn't be morose either. Like Mystic River before this, Clint has proved he can handle some thorny issues with as much mastery as a western or any other genre, just from a strictly personal point of view however I think the lighter side of his talents would be most welcome in his next project.",4,Powerful film that stays with you,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,3450,"[""'m"", 'reviewing', 'movie', 'again', 'just', 'deleted', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'bombarded', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'been', 'missed', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'try', 'reiterate.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'point', 'view', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'predicted', 'did', 'course', 'win', '4', 'oscars', 'recently', 'rubberstamp', 'viewpoint', 'most', 'desevedly', 'notably', 'Hilary', 'Swanks', 'incredible', 'performance.All', 'said', 'however', 'movie', 'slow', 'start', 'often', 'plodding', 'dialogue', 'continuity', 'places', 'regardless', 'how', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'very', 'depressing', 'picture', 'previously', 'stated', 'Eastwood', 'late', 'immersed', 'directing', 'acting', 'talents', 'here', 'stark', 'realities', 'human', 'nature', 'most', 'raw', 'naked', 'state', 'arguably', 'having', 'free', 'reign', 'most', 'other', 'renowned', 'directors', 'not', 'being', 'entrenched', 'hollywood', 'crowd', 'pleasers', 'caring', 'financial', 'success', 'failure', 'picture', 'box', 'office.Clint', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'long', 'time', 'boxing', 'manager', 'expert', 'corner', 'man', 'old', 'days', 'narrated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'desperately', 'embittered', 'approaching', 'old', 'age', 'laced', 'regret', 'emotional', 'torment', 'current', 'title', 'hope', 'high', 'flying', 'competitor', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'returns', 'letters', 'unopened', 'priest', 'cantankorous', 'debating', 'Freeman', 'uneasy', 'friend/employee', 'former', 'talent', 'who', 'was', 'blinded', 'one', 'eye', 'last', 'fight', 'something', 'Frankie', 'also', 'Enter', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', '30', 'something', 'down', 'earth', 'woman', 'encumbered', 'past', 'zero', 'opportunity', 'humble', 'tangible', 'dreams', 'trailer', 'park', 'family', 'ties', 'desire', 'follow', 'dreams', 'box', 'tenacity', 'stubborness', 'eventually', 'Frankie', 'who', 'train', 'initially', 'refusing', 'several', 'times', 'better', 'judgement', 'What', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'characters', 'thrive', 'becoming', 'surrogate', 'own', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'surrogate', 'dead', 'father', 'whom', 'admired', 'terribly.The', 'movie', 'point', 'rags', 'riches', 'rags', 'picture', 'sombre', 'tone', 'being', 'absorbing', 'actually', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'miserable', ""'m"", 'not', 'criticizing', 'flavor', 'film', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'human', 'drama', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'lack', 'ANY', 'levity', 'be', 'amiss', 'Combining', 'euthenasia', 'story', 'more', 'fuel', 'sobriety', 'everything', 'regardless', 'political', 'moral', 'affiliations', 'subject', 'most', 'will', 'agree', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'unlikely', 'inconsistencies', 'make', 'ending', 'seem', 'unecessarily', 'protracted.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Eastwood', 'actor', 'director', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'not', 'movies', 'rarely', 'have', 'bad', 'word', 'say', 'even', 'most', 'sombre', 'topics', 'been', 'balanced', 'lifted', 'where', 'necessary', 'even', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'Lightening', 'subject', 'not', 'mean', 'viewer', 'will', 'take', 'subject', 'lightly', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'comedy', 'be', 'entertaining', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'morose', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Clint', 'proved', 'can', 'handle', 'thorny', 'issues', 'as', 'much', 'mastery', 'western', 'other', 'genre', 'just', 'strictly', 'personal', 'point', 'view', 'however', 'think', 'lighter', 'side', 'talents', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'welcome', 'next', 'project']",N/A

Yet, the moment of her ultimate triumph also becomes a turning point to tragedy.Maggie is guided, initially reluctantly, by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who also has his own demons to overcome.  He is a devout Catholic man but often troubled by personal dilemmas which only grow as the film progresses.

633170,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNP1,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I made the grave mistake of watching this movie with my infant daughter a few nights back and by the time Frankie Dunn gets to explaining what `Mo Cushla' means to Maggie I was a complete and utter mess.  Yes, I'm an emotional wreck when it comes to films that tug the heart strings, and `Million Dollar Baby' is just that kind of movie.  It's funny because come Oscar season 2004 I was a huge supporter of this film but ended up getting caught up in the backlash especially with Swanks Oscar win.  It's a shame because I unfortunately shelved this film for quite a while allowing the opinion of others to influence my opinion of this film.  With the birth of my daughter I've been up plenty of nights with nothing much to do but watch movies to drown out the cries and `Million Dollar Baby' just so happened to be one of the first films I decided to watch again.  I'm glad that I did, for as much as it drained me emotionally by the end it helped remind me why I was such a supporter of the film the year of its release.  `Million Dollar Baby' is truly an astounding film.To me it's hard really to categorize this film.  If you haven't seen the movie you may want to read my review with the foreknowledge that while won't reveal the ending of the film I will divulge information you may not be privy to.  `Million Dollar Baby' plays out like two separate films.  There's the sports drama that unfolds throughout the first half and then there's the paced dramatic second half that has absolutely nothing to do with boxing.  What ties these two halves together is the relationship drama unfolding between Frankie Dunn and Maggie Fitzgerald.  It's one of the sweetest yet ultimately devastating father-daughter sagas in recent years.  What makes this all the more involving are the stellar performances by Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood.  They are so in tune with each other, so connected with their characters and with their cast mates that you believe them through and through and that is the key factor in understanding and appreciating this film.Maggie Fitzgerald is a middle-aged waitress who feels her life has wasted away without ever truly becoming what she wanted it to become.  Her family is a vapid void of who she used to be, a carousel of white trash self centered bodies who take what they can and give nothing but heartache.  They criticize Maggie for her dreams even when she attains them but welcome the checks she sends home every week.  Frankie Dunn is a trainer at the end of his rope.  He's losing his fighters because of his ethics and he's losing himself as he struggles to reconnect with his daughter who's given up on him years ago.  Maggie believes Dunn to be the best trainer there is and wants nothing more than to be his fighter, but as Frankie so bluntly puts it, he don't train girls.  Maggie is persistent though, and eventually she breaks him down.  He agrees to train her on the condition that she will find herself another manager when the time is right, but when that time comes he realizes he can't let Maggie go.  It's that realization that makes this film all the more heartbreaking.The movie is far more than a `down on her luck girl becoming a prized fighter' type film.  It's more about heart than anything else.  Stripped bare of its boxing backdrop and you have a film about the deepest most remote parts of love, a love that can only exist between families.  This is not about romantic or lustful love but about respect and admiration.  Hilary Swank plays Maggie with such determination, such heart that you feel for her, you love her every step of the way.  It's a shame to me that Hilary has only done two good films.  Watching her in this film and even to a greater extent in `Boys Don't Cry' it's hard to imagine that she's the same actress to give us `The Core'.  I can't decide if Swank is a good actress or a lucky one, but hating aside her performances in both `Million Dollar Baby' and `Boys Don't Cry' are brilliant.  I will admit that Kate Winslet's performance in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was better and more deserving of Oscar gold, but I can completely understand and get behind the academy's decision to crown Swank once again.Clint Eastwood also pulls out a fascinating performance.  The first time I saw this film I was so blown away but Swanks performance that I didn't truly grasp the magnificent portrayal of Dunn that Eastwood provides.  His subtle variations of emotion are so expertly mannered that I can't help but wish they would have handed him the Oscar.  He was so controlled here and watching his shift from arrogant and demanding to content and understanding to depressed and defensive as he comes to grips with Maggie's situation.  He was, in a word, outstanding.While I love Morgan Freeman and feel that his presence in this film is wonderful I am less impressed with his performance than with any other in the film.  His Oscar win in my opinion was undeserved for his character is not all that impressive.  In fact I feel that the idea of Eddie Dupris is more impressive than the limited amount of depth the script allowed for him.  He could have been a more powerful presence but he lacked something that both Swank and Eastwood were able to deliver.  I hate to single out Freeman as the flaw here because I truly love the actor but there really is nothing else in this film I can find fault with.In the end the film, including Freeman, is a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Sure it may appear sappy in some areas but ultimately it's rewarding in the same vein.  It's a truly extraordinary accounting of a beautiful relationship between a girl in need of a father and a father in need of a daughter.  It's a movie that will make the burliest of men cry and to me a film that can invest itself so deep in an audience as to evoke real emotions is a film that is deserving of all the praise it can receive.  `Million Dollar Baby' is just that film.  I'm sorry for ever allowing others to influence my opinion of you when I knew you were always a gem.  I promise to never let that happen again.",5,"Deserving of the praise and admiration, a film that truly becomes a part of you...",1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,6081,"['made', 'grave', 'mistake',

Let's hope Oscar voters are as savvy as the Hollywood Foreign Press, because 'Million Dollar Baby' is the work of a master craftsman who - if possible - continues to get better and better and now, at 74, there seems no end in sight to this man's genius.This is type of film that makes you rue all the other five-star ratings you've given out.  As another reviewer notes: with all those fives, this one must be a six.  It's that good.  Hilary Swank is amazing.  So physical and tender.  And her boxing scenes are nothing short of spectacular.  She'll take your breath away.Two special moments (out of many) in the film:- When Eastwood's Frankie Dunn agrees to take on Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald, her joy is so unbridled...and so is yours as an audience member.  Mostly because Eastwood (as director) has built masterfully to that moment.- When Eastwood (as actor) reveals the true meaning to Maggie of the Gaelic phrase he had stitched to the back of her boxing robe, there were audible sobs..almost gasps...throughout the theater.Very powerful, visceral stuff. Perfectly rendered.

633172,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,B00005JNP1,anna-joelle,"[6, 10]","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that packs a powerful punch (no pun intended) and you'll feel ""it"" deep in your heart and guts even days after watching it. Yes, the movie's depressing, but never so disturbing that you never want to watch it again (I'm looking forward to the DVD). Back in February, before I saw this movie, I was a bit dismayed when a film ""about boxing"" (a sport I don't care for) won the Oscar for Best Picture, edging out (my then favorite film) ""Finding Neverland"". But after seeing ""Million Dollar Baby"" last week, I now understand why this film was the BIG winner that night, sweeping 2 other major awards as well (for Best Director and Best Actress).This film is perfect from start to finish (yes, right down to its tragic ending - there's really no other way for it to go). For me, 4 things really stand out in this film:-1) The beautiful and compelling storyline - about a lonely girl (Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank) who just wants to pursue her dream of becoming a champion boxer, and how her life intertwines that of Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood, who plays her personal and initially, reluctant trainer). There isn't a boring/unnecessary scene - all are well executed, meaningful and completely riveting to watch.2) The AWESOME fight scenes in the ring which looked so REAL (how were they filmed without the actors getting hurt?). I could tell (from the ""wow"" sounds I heard) that even the male audience in the theatre were impressed by the (often) brutal and utterly convincing fights scenes, and whenever Hilary Swank's character lands the final ""pow"" to K.O. her opponent. And watch out for the ""broken-nose-fixed-back"" scene. It has to be seen to be believed!3) Hilary Swank's SUPERB acting, which is the crown that makes this movie a true masterpiece! If you think she was brilliant in ""Boys Don't Cry"", then let me write that she's PHENOMENAL in this one and well deserved her second Best Actress win (did Annette Benning - though great in ""Being Julia"" - even think she had a chance against this formidable young actress?!). Hilary Swank = ""Maggie Fitzgerald"" in mind, body, soul. She made her character so completely believable. Maggie's strength, perseverance, good humor, generosity and kind nature all combine to make her lovable - ""white trash"" or not (note: why is she described as ""trash"" in the film? Because she's born poor and has a low education? To me, Maggie's a beautiful gem, an angel in flesh and blood!).4) Hilary Swank/Maggie's genuine, natural chemistry with Clint Eastwood/Frank. Their scenes together are beautiful to watch. And in that final ""Mo Guishler"" scene between the two characters, I guarantee no one who watches it will be unaffected (yes, I cried as I thought of all the beauty, sweetness, sadness and unfairness of ""it all"").""Million Dollar Baby"" is a million-dollar gem of a film. It is not a story about boxing entirely, but is also about life, love and the strength of the human spirit.

633174,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B00005JNP1,Antonio Robert,"[4, 6]","When Clint Eastwood received the immense acclaim for his 1992 anti-western ""Unforgiven"", he had achieved all a filmmaker can ask for, including the most prestigious awards. In a way, though, it was only the beginning of another era in his prolific career. A whole new side of Eastwood emerged in films like the powerfully romantic ""Bridges of Madison County"" and the masterful ""Mystic River"", which was probably prevented only by the ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" from getting another Best Picture Oscar, for 2003.In turn, the 2004 ""Million Dollar Baby"" surprisingly beat out Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" in the Oscar race, leaving Scorsese still without the ultimate Academy recognition. With a bit of irony, the victory at the award ceremony evidently came -- at least partially -- as a recognition of Eastwood's work as director, producer, actor (his ""Baby"" work is easily among his best yet) and even composer (already in ""Mystic River"").As a film, ""Baby"" is a sombre little low-key piece, different than many Oscar winners dipped in grandeur and epic production. Its power lies in excellent performances of the leading trio -- Eastwood as boxing coach Frank Dunn, Hilary Swank as his first-ever female ""pupil"" Maggie Fitzgerald, and Morgan Freeman (the film narrator), whose character was trained by Frank in the past.Swank and Freeman won Oscars for their work here; while Freeman's award came also as a recognition of many years of fabulous acting, Swank's second leading role award only at the age of 30 showed what how capable player she is.The three main characters are very-well drawn, depicted with psychological depth rarely seen in movies these days. The film displays crucial cross-road of their life; the realism stems from the fact that although they are very normal people with lots of flaws, they have enough moral power not to succumb to selfishness completely -- unlike many others of the movie's characters.The script, although free of flashy details that win awards, is full of clever hints, such as when Frank, after encountering Maggie's not very attractive mother tells her that her father must have been a good-looking and smart man.Another highly interesting feature of ""Million Dollar Baby"", similarly to ""Mystic River"" is either the current inability of religious leaders to offer a solid spiritual guidance (""Baby""), or their committing cruel deeds themselves (""River"").The ending may polarise viewers, but it only highlights the fact that Eastwood and Co. did not shoot a movie with an intention to please everyone. Rather, they tell a story that often happens in this world. At times a bit slow and maybe largely boring for people uninterested in boxing, this Baby definitely is worth your time.",4,Clint Eastwood's Ambitious Baby,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2745,"['When', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'received', 'immense', 'acclaim', '1992', 'anti-western', 'Unforgiven', 'had', 'achieved', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'ask', 'including', 'most', 'prestigious', 'awards', 'way', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'era', 'prolific', 'career', 'whole', 'new', 'side', 'Eastwood', 'emerged', 'films', 'powerfully', 'romantic', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'masterful', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'probably', 'prevented', 'only', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'getting', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '2003.In', 'turn', '2004', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'surprisingly', 'beat', 'out', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Aviator', 'Oscar', 'race', 'leaving', 'Scorsese', 'still', 'ultimate', 'Academy', 'recognition', 'bit', 'irony', 'victory', 'award', 'ceremony', 'evidently', 'came', 'least', 'partially', 'recognition', 'Eastwood', 'work', 'director', 'producer', 'actor', 'Baby', 'work', 'easily', 'best', 'yet', 'even', 'composer', 'already', 'Mystic', 'River', 'film', 'Baby', 'sombre', 'little', 'low-key', 'piece', 'different', 'many', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'dipped', 'grandeur', 'epic', 'production', 'power', 'excellent', 'performances', 'leading', 'trio', 'Eastwood', 'boxing', 'coach', 'Frank', 'Dunn', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'first-ever', 'female', 'pupil', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'narrator', 'character', 'was', 'trained', 'Frank', 'past.Swank', 'Freeman', 'won', 'Oscars', 'work', 'here', 'Freeman', 'award', 'came', 'also', 'recognition', 'many', 'years', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'Swank', 'second', 'leading', 'role', 'award', 'only', 'age', '30', 'showed', 'what', 'how', 'capable', 'player', 'is.The', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'very-well', 'drawn', 'depicted', 'psychological', 'depth', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'days', 'film', 'crucial', 'cross-road', 'life', 'realism', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'normal', 'people', 'lots', 'flaws', 'have', 'enough', 'moral', 'power', 'not', 'succumb', 'selfishness', 'completely', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'characters.The', 'script', 'free', 'flashy', 'details', 'win', 'awards', 'full', 'clever', 'hints', 'such', 'when', 'Frank', 'encountering', 'Maggie', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'mother', 'father', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'good-looking', 'smart', 'man.Another', 'highly', 'interesting', 'feature', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'similarly', 'Mystic', 'River', 'current', 'inability', 'religious', 'leaders', 'offer', 'solid', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'Baby', 'committing', 'cruel', 'River', '.The', 'ending', 'may', 'polarise', 'viewers', 'only', 'fact', 'Eastwood', 'Co.', 'did', 'not', 'shoot', 'movie', 'intention', 'please', 'everyone', 'tell', 'story', 'often', 'world', 'times', 'bit', 'slow', 'maybe', 'largely', 'boring', 'people', 'uninterested', 'boxing', 'Baby', 'definitely', 'time']",N/A
633175,A2ACHVOFMAIQ1K,B00005JNP1,"Arthem ""arthem""","[2, 4]","In ""Unforgiven,"" Eastwood turned Westerns on their heads by creating a stylized violence so real that it became repugnant.  ""Million Dollar Baby"" accomplishes a similar feat, but poised in a contemporary setting not too far removed from modern American reality.  Despite the Boxing Mileau, the film speaks to the hopes and tragedy of life lived at the periphery.  From the optimistically stupid character ""Danger"", to the pessimistic tough guys that inhabit the gym world, the background of the movie is poignant and full of nuance.With any level of suspension of disbelief, this becomes an extraordinarily powerful movie - the dramatic impact at the core of the plot - the sudden twist from victory to tragedy, is the summit of art.  Along classical lines, this movie succeeds - gripping and thought provoking - a rare blend.That being said, the flaw of the movie is its gratuitous portrayal of Catholicism.  There are two obvious characitures in Million Dollar Baby - the ""tough guy boxer"" who beats up the retarded character ""Danger,"" and the Catholic Priest.  For a movie that took so much pain to develop its characters, the addition of a cursing Priest who is so cold as to walk away from Dunn at the nadir of his spirit is only excusable by the deliberate malfeasance of its director.  The film would qualify as a realist/artistic statement if it made any effort to portray legitimate Catholic (or Christian) doctrine regarding the sanctity of life.  As it is, the hamhanded efforts to paint the resolution of this movie as heroism can qualify only as euthenasia propaganda.Still, this only detracts from the value of the film, not its impact.  Certainly, contrasted with the pap that spills from Hollywood, Million Dollar Baby is as close to meaningful art as we're likely to get.

633181,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B00005JNP1,Barry C. Chow,"[8, 11]","It is morbidly fascinating to read the reviews condemning this great modern-era tragedy. For, of course, that is what this film is: a tragedy--recumbent with all of the classical hallmarks that distinguish the form--imperfect heroes who risk ruin because they cannot overcome their tragic flaws; fate leading to an enormity of suffering that exposes human frailty; sympathy earned, not through cheap sentiment, but through a painful reflection on our shared humanity.The ideologues who condemn this film for promoting a specific view of life may as well condemn ""Romeo and Juliet"" for promoting teen suicide, or ""Henry V"" for promoting war. This film takes no stands. It only seeks to tell a tragic tale that invokes compassion for the broken souls at the centre of its misfortunes. It strives for the same goals to which all great tragedies aspire: it forces us to reflect on our own lives, to learn from the mistakes of others, to approach good fortune with humility and to accept misfortune with strength of purpose. This film meets these aspirations so well that it stands as one of the greatest works in cinema.Clint Eastwood directs this story with a style so austere, so Spartan, that the film is stripped down to its purest fundamentals. This allows the essence of the film to not just shine through, but to scintillate. This is a man who truly understands that less is more. During his acting career, this led to some one-note performances. But now in his directing career, it leads to films of incredible power. By inviting us to fill the unspoken spaces with our own thoughts, we are forced to become participants in the story and not just observers.The acting is sublime. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure, but here, his bantering with Eastwood defies description. This isn't acting, but eavesdropping on two old soul mates whose friendship for each other fits like a pair of well-worn shoes. Eastwood turns his crusty and laconic mannerisms into one of the most effective character studies in recent memory. When he kneels in prayer and says: ""...no use my repeating myself Lord--You know what it is that I want"", this distils a lifetime of terrible choices and shattered hopes into a moment of poignant simplicity. But the real gem is Hilary Swank. If there is anywhere in cinema a better performance of white trash inexorably obsessed with rising above her meagre station in life, I haven't seen it.This is not a boxing film. It is not a surrogate father/daughter film. It is not, even remotely, a message film. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, first and foremost, an anthem to the human condition. All great tragedy is, and I daresay this film is on a par with O'Neill, Hugo and Shakespeare.

633183,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JNP1,Benjamin,"[6, 11]","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a great, no-frills, to-the-gut movie. It's not just about boxing, despite what you may think after seeing the trailer, and it's not about the twist ending, though the movie is better if you don't know what's coming at the end. It's tightly made, carries a hell of an impact and features some of the best acting you're likely to see onscreen this year.Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances in years - if not his best ever - as Frankie Dunn, a grizzled boxing coach so beaten up by life that he refuses to allow his contending fighters to take any risks or any chances. Frankie counsels his fighters to approach a title bout with the sort of reluctance and pre-destined disappointment that he applies to his entire life. He goes to church every week, but he's a guilt-ridden skeptic, not really a believer. He wants a relationship with his daughter, but she has made it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him. Given any number of opportunities, he's taken none of them. Frankie runs a gym with his closest friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman), who used to be one of Frankie's boxers until he lost an eye.Into Frankie's life comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress who wants to be a boxer even though she has no training, is a bit out-of-shape and is way too old to start a serious career.For the first half of the film, it does follow the formula of a ""boxing movie;"" however, these characters are fleshed-out and real, and the movie is more about following dreams that only you can see and rising above the circumstances that you're presented with. The last portion of the film is about how life, even when it's sweet, can be desperately unfair.The movie's heartbreaking, compelling and grand. I highly recommend it.",5,It's not about boxing.

633188,A3CBVOWBZIGNH0,B00005JNP1,Bill Fyffe Jr.,"[8, 12]","This movie packs a punch in more ways than one.  Not only is Clint Eastwood a hall-of-fame actor, he is quickly rising to equal status as a director, and assembling a fine cast of actors certainly benefited his opportunity for million dollar success.Hilary Swank (Best Actress 2005) plays the amiable Maggie Fitzgerald, a 32-year old single woman struggling to overcome her stereotypical ""trailer trash""  roots.  Her character somewhat parallels that of Rocky Balboa in the Rocky movies of the '70s in that the audience cannot resist cheering for the underdog.As in Rocky, Fitzgerald dreams of a boxing championship, but the dream is hers alone.  Following a hard day of serving tables, Maggie makes her way to the ""Hit Pit"" owned and operated by gruff trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and former boxer/maintenance man, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman; Best Supporting Actor 2005).The ""Hit Pit"" is more than a boxing establishment, it is a place for societal misfortunes, a haven and support group for members to aspire to greater things.  Frankie and the club are resting on the laurels of one of its own prized fighters, a champion in the making.  However, Frankie's real battle is not in the ring, but with his estranged daughter, who refuses to accept his letters.The audience quickly realizes the importance of the need for relationship between the two characters, and when they intersect, a beautiful story evolves.  It is a humanitarian film with ebbs and flows, peaks and valleys, and from its humanness flows important moral decisions.Million Dollar Baby is far more than a boxing movie.

633189,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005JNP1,Bobby Underwood,"[9, 14]","This quiet and low-key film from director Clint Eastwood is a story of real life. It is filled with love and pain and regret, and at its conclusion, you will feel all three. Eastwood released it slowly, in a deliberate manner, so that word of mouth would be its advertisement. In its own heartbreaking manner, it might be his best film both as a director and actor.Hilary Swank is magnificent in her down-to-earth role of a young woman with a background she dreams of rising above through boxing. Her determination to make it during times so dire she is relegated to eating leftover food from the plates of others is just one moving moment in a film full of them. This is not the usual Hollywood version of how people survive, but the truth.Eastwood is a legendary trainer and cut-man she hopes will help her achieve her dream. She has the heart but knows he can teach her the skills to make it happen. Morgan Freeman is once again Eastwood's pal, but this time he won the Oscar he deserved for his moving performance. His compassion and understanding of life's regrets is the thread which ties all the pieces of cloth into a quilt, each piece having its own story to tell. His narration, coming at critical junctures in the story is tinged with the sad overview of events from a higher perspective.Eastwood for his part gives a subtle and moving performance as a man with deep regrets over an estranged daughter. His letters are always returned unopened but he keeps sending them nonetheless. It is the spirit and desperation of Swank that will tip the scales in her favor with Eastwood because he sees in her a kindred soul, coming to view her as his own. When she tries but fails to connect with her family after she becomes successful, it is Eastwood who will remain. There is something tender and very real in their understated scene afterwards in the car.A tragedy the viewer does not see coming, and one I will not ruin if you haven't seen this, will shatter dreams and hearts, however. When Eastwood is asked by Swank for something which will take all he has left, you can almost see his heart breaking. Swank simply disappears into her character in the same manner for which Montgomery Clift was famous. Morgan Freeman gives a masterful performance. Eastwood did not get the accolades Freeman and Swank did for their roles, but if you watch closely, you will see a subtle but rough grace to his performance. Only in the film's final moments will we understand how much he cares for her.This is a film elemental but by no means simple. It touched audiences on a human level and was a success without fanfare because it is an all too real slice of life, its truths sometimes painful to watch.Sometimes, when all we have is gone, all that is left us are our memories, and a slice of lemon pie.....",5,Memories and Lemon Pie,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2803,"['quiet', 'low-key', 'film', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'filled', 'love', 'pain', 'regret', 'conclusion', 'will', 'feel', 'three', 'Eastwood', 'released', 'slowly', 'deliberate', 'manner', 'word', 'mouth', 'would', 'be', 'advertisement', 'own', 'heartbreaking', 'manner', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'director', 'actor.Hilary', 'Swank', 'magnificent', 'down-to-earth', 'role', 'young', 'woman', 'background', 'rising', 'boxing', 'determination', 'make', 'times', 'so', 'dire', 'relegated', 'eating', 'leftover', 'food', 'plates', 'others', 'just', 'one', 'moving', 'moment', 'film', 'full', 'not', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'how', 'people', 'survive', 'truth.Eastwood', 'legendary', 'trainer', 'cut-man', 'will', 'help', 'achieve', 'dream', 'heart', 'can', 'teach', 'skills', 'make', 'happen', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'once', 'again', 'Eastwood', 'pal', 'time', 'won', 'Oscar', 'deserved', 'moving', 'performance', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'life', 'regrets', 'thread', 'pieces', 'cloth', 'quilt', 'piece', 'having', 'own', 'story', 'tell', 'narration', 'coming', 'critical', 'junctures', 'story', 'tinged', 'sad', 'overview', 'events', 'higher', 'perspective.Eastwood', 'part', 'subtle', 'moving', 'performance', 'man', 'deep', 'regrets', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'letters', 'are', 'always', 'returned', 'unopened', 'sending', 'nonetheless', 'spirit', 'desperation', 'Swank', 'will', 'tip', 'scales', 'favor', 'Eastwood', 'kindred', 'soul', 'coming', 'view', 'own', 'When', 'connect', 'family', 'successful', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'will', 'remain', 'something', 'tender', 'very', 'real', 'understated', 'scene', 'afterwards', 'car.A', 'tragedy', 'viewer', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'will', 'shatter', 'dreams', 'hearts', 'however', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'asked', 'Swank', 'something', 'will', 'take', 'left', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'heart', 'breaking', 'Swank', 'simply', 'character', 'same', 'manner', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'was', 'famous', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'accolades', 'Freeman', 'Swank', 'did', 'roles', 'watch', 'closely', 'will', 'see', 'subtle', 'rough', 'grace', 'performance', 'Only', 'film', 'final', 'moments', 'will', 'understand', 'how', 'much', 'her.This', 'film', 'elemental', 'means', 'simple', 'touched', 'audiences', 'human', 'level', 'was', 'success', 'fanfare', 'too', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'truths', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'watch.Sometimes', 'when', 'have', 'gone', 'left', 'are', 'memories', 'slice', 'lemon', 'pie', '..']",N/A

But this is a film that grows deeper and more rewarding with each viewing. The deep bond that exists between trainer Frankie Dunn and boxer Maggie Fitzgerald becomes more evident each time you see the film. Dialogue that seems to mean one thing suddenly seems to mean something all together different the second and third time around.The more you see it, the more you also realize that much of the ""controversy"" concerning the actions of the characters was the result of propagandists who either missed the point or deliberately attempted to mislead the public about the film's ""message."" But this film's only ""message"" is that life is a frequently brutal business that sometimes requires making decisions we would rather avoid. ""Million Dollar Baby"" does not ""promote,"" ""endorse,"" or ""condone,"" but rather ""depicts"" an act that has deeply disturbing consequences for all involved.The performances are excellent with Hillary Swank commanding the spotlight even when sharing it with her illustrious and legendary co-stars. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also excellent, as is Jay Baruchel as Danger. Eastwood's subtle score is fine, and Tom Stern's moody cinematography is outstanding, effectively using light and shadow to create moods and to comment on the characters and the action.Brian W.

Director Clint Eastwood, whose career spans multiple decades in Hollywood, creates perhaps his greatest film to date, and co-stars Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) and Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry) light up the screen with their deft character portrayals and unique charisma. Combining all the inspiration of Rocky with all the drama of a Greek tragedy, Million Dollar Baby is well-deserved of its Best Picture victory (despite the many protests of competing directors who think Eastwood won based on nostalgia for his heralded career and his personal likeability)...Million Dollar Baby focuses on tough-skinned boxing manager Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), proprietor of a local training gym who has long been estranged from his lone daughter and seems to have only one friend of note - Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Eddie lives in and helps manage the gym, and he was once one of Frankie's fighters. With Big Willie Little (Mike Colter, who once appeared in ER) under Frankie's management, the gym hosts the daily workouts of a legitimate heavyweight title contender. But Frankie's reluctance to move Big Willie along prompts him to switch to a less conservative manager, and Frankie must watch his years of hard work pay off for someone else. Meanwhile, 30-something Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) has scraped together the pennies and nickels necessary to train at the gym on a daily basis. Despite Frankie's advice to quit making a fool of herself, she borrows equipment from Eddie and works out until all hours of the night...With Big Willie out of the picture, Frankie finally confronts Maggie and agrees to train her. Over time, the two develop a close relationship akin to father/daughter. Maggie rises in the ranks of the female circuit until she reaches the title fight where a cheap sucker punch leads to tragic consequences... With emotional depth and colorful characters, Million Dollar Baby brings one of the most controversial issues of modern society into the forefront for an up-close-and-personal glimpse of the conflict and struggle experienced by trauma victims and their loved ones. Hilary Swank's Oscar winning performance is on full display, and Morgan Freeman is his usual mesmerizing presence...In the end, Million Dollar Baby beat out a number of excellent films in order to claim the Oscar for Best Picture - Finding Neverland, Ray, Sideways, and The Aviator (which prompted director Martin Scorsese to flee the awards ceremony in a huff). A case could be made for each of these fine films, but needless to say, Million Dollar Baby's victory is highly indicative of the film's enduring value. Each of the main characters comes across as likeable, the relationships as believable, and the storyline as inspirational and stirring. Million Dollar Baby is one of those rare films that stays in your head for hours on end long after you've walked out of the theater. Its subject matter is serious fodder for debate, and few viewers will fail to develop a strong emotional connection to Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman as they spring to life on the big screen. Quite simply, Million Dollar Baby is one of the best films of the decade and one you won't want to miss...The DVD Report",5,A powerful film...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3405,"['Nominated', '5', 'Golden', 'Globes', '7', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Year', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'opened', 'widespread', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'excellent', 'audience', 'reviews', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'multiple', 'decades', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'film', 'date', 'co-stars', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'deft', 'character', 'portrayals', 'unique', 'charisma', 'Combining', 'inspiration', 'Rocky', 'drama', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'well-deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'victory', 'many', 'protests', 'competing', 'directors', 'who', 'think', 'Eastwood', 'won', 'based', 'nostalgia', 'heralded', 'career', 'personal', 'likeability', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'tough-skinned', 'boxing', 'manager', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'proprietor', 'local', 'training', 'gym', 'who', 'long', 'been', 'estranged', 'lone', 'daughter', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'note', 'Eddie', 'Scrap-Iron', 'Dupris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Eddie', 'manage', 'gym', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'Frankie', 'fighters', 'Big', 'Willie', 'Little', 'Mike', 'Colter', 'who', 'once', 'appeared', 'ER', 'Frankie', 'management', 'gym', 'daily', 'workouts', 'legitimate', 'heavyweight', 'title', 'contender', 'Frankie', 'reluctance', 'move', 'Big', 'Willie', 'prompts', 'switch', 'less', 'conservative', 'manager', 'Frankie', 'must', 'watch', 'years', 'hard', 'work', 'pay', 'off', 'someone', 'else', 'Meanwhile', '30-something', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'scraped', 'together', 'pennies', 'nickels', 'necessary', 'train', 'gym', 'daily', 'basis', 'Frankie', 'advice', 'quit', 'making', 'fool', 'herself', 'equipment', 'Eddie', 'out', 'hours', 'night', 'Big', 'Willie', 'picture', 'Frankie', 'finally', 'Maggie', 'train', 'time', 'two', 'develop', 'close', 'relationship', 'akin', 'father/daughter', 'Maggie', 'ranks', 'female', 'circuit', 'title', 'fight', 'where', 'cheap', 'sucker', 'punch', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'emotional', 'depth', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'issues', 'modern', 'society', 'forefront', 'up-close-and-personal', 'glimpse', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'experienced', 'trauma', 'victims', 'loved', 'ones', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'full', 'display', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'usual', 'mesmerizing', 'presence', 'end', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'beat', 'out', 'number', 'excellent', 'films', 'order', 'claim', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Ray', 'Sideways', 'Aviator', 'prompted', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'flee', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'huff', 'case', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'fine', 'films', 'needless', 'say', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'victory', 'highly', 'indicative', 'film', 'enduring', 'value', 'main', 'characters', 'likeable', 'relationships', 'believable', 'storyline', 'inspirational', 'stirring', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'head', 'hours', 'end', 'long', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'theater', 'subject', 'matter', 'serious', 'fodder', 'debate', 'few', 'viewers', 'will', 'fail', 'develop', 'strong', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Eastwood', 'Swank', 'Freeman', 'spring', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'Quite', 'simply', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'decade', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

The dialogue is believable, the acting is terrific, and Clint Eastwood proves once again how much talent he has as both an actor and a director. The only reason I'm giving this movie four stars instead of five is because it's not something I want to watch over and over again. That's got nothing to do with the quality of the film - in fact, part of my reasoning is because the film is so powerful. The reason why I don't want to watch the movie very often is because it is so very sad.Explaining exactly why the film is sad would ruin it. I'll just say that the movie starts off almost like a female version of Rocky, with a cocky by aging fighter making a run to the top. A surprise twist changes everything, though, and the mood does a complete 180. This film, more than any other movie in recent memory, does an uncanny job of making you not just like but love the characters. Then it strips them bare and puts them through the ringer, bringing you along with it.Do not purchase Million Dollar Baby if you're looking for a light-hearted sports film or if you want an uplifting tale of a zero rising to become a hero.

I'm sorry but I am a proponent of free speech, and while some of it rankles me and some doesn't ..we still (however short)have the right to express ourselves. This movie may touch on a sore subject, butyou know everything in life is not always peaches and cream.The fact is (without giving away the ending, for those of you who may not have seen this yet)the treatment of the subject matter was tasteful and well done. And, not anything that cannot and has not happened in real life. So , as such it deserves to be seen and heard.Ok, with that out of the way. Clint, Morgan, Hilary, et al; play one gritty group of characters. Clint runs a small gym for boxers, and has a ghost or two in his closet, As does Morgan'shave one of his own. Hilary, so talented plays the prodigy coming up in the world of women's boxing. She comes from 'trailer trash' so to speak, and wants something more in life..to prove herself and to prove TO herself that she hasa place and a purpose in this life. She is such a multi-talentedactress!

Of course, I had no doubt that Clint Eastwood would do a good job. I've always liked his performance in films. Although, this didn't seem like his type of a show, which may have also been a reason I found this so difficult to write about. The movie just didn't scream Clint Eastwood. But, I still like it. I wasn't exactly sure if I wanted to see it. I had heard a lot of good things about it, not to mention how many awards it got at the Oscars. But, I figured if Clint is directing it then it must be good. So, I went.The movie was ok. But, unlike some movies I've seen, this one didn't spark me as something I would want to see again. But, if you liked Ray, then you'll like this one. It's a heavy drama, really heavy. It is very powerful and moving. Million Dollar Baby will definitely leave you shocked and surprised. It takes you on a lot of roads. And, just when you thought you have it the film changes again.  You can almost taste the testosterone in this one. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) coaches boxing with the help of his partner Dupris ((Morgan Freeman). Things don't turn out to well for Dunn. His daughter ignores him. And, just when he thinks he's on his way to fame and fortune, he best player backs out on him for a chance of winning the championship.That's were Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) comes in. A poor, southern girl from Mississippi, Maggie hopes for more than just doing dirty dishes all her life. Being that she is a girl, Frankie refuses, and is afraid to teach her. Although, her determination leads him to realize that maybe he needs to try it out. I won't give away the ending. It is really shocking. If you think you can handle a hard drama, with twists and turns, Than I'd say go for it. If nothing else, the acting will please you.The critically acclaimed Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood do a stunning job together. But, their performances, separately, are excellent. And, of course, Hilary Swank did a just as well. Winning Best Picture, Actress, and Director, Million Dollar Baby is as good as it gets.

For every film that deserves to win such as Return of the King and Titanic and Schindler's List, we get films that oddly win like American Beauty, Chicago, Shakespeare in Love and this one. Not saying that this is a bad film(the other 2 are however) but I like it going how did this win the entire thing? I wasn't a fan of the way too overdramatic Mystic River but with this film it's good but I wouldn't say it's Best Picture worthy like Braveheart or Titanic but it's good.Frankie Dunn is a boxing manager training a Title bout contender. Only before the match, the fighter ditches him for someone else and wins. In walks in Maggie Fitzgerald, an early 30s waitress who wants to be a fighter only Frankie won't teach her but with the help of Frankie's friend and ex-boxer Eddie she goes on her way to the top only to hit a really big snag.Like I said, this won Best Picture so I watched it after the fact it won and I don't see how it won. Similar to A Beautiful Mind or American Beauty, a film wins the big award while more deserving didn't get it like Saving Private Ryan over Shakespeare or Gladiator over Crouching Tiger. Guess I'm just not getting the big deal.One problem that really plagued Mystic River was it was too overdramatic. It was almost like the film kept asking you whether you were crying or emotionally moved yet. With this film however it doesn't have that which was a plus such as the last scene with boxer/trainer. And kudos for having Maggie tell off her leech family members.The film does have some issues though such as the wannabe pipsqueak boxer Danger. It just seems like a break from all the dramatic stuff by adding some humor but it doesn't fit. Same with the reasons why Frankie isn't speaking with his daughter anymore. While it does leave his character even more alone and broken at the end, why bother putting it in in the first place if you're not going to resolve it. Even Eddie's 110th final bout gets resolved. It's also a really dark film at nighttime with very bad lighting.Performances are one of its saving graces with them being likable people, even funny. Although I don't understand the attraction to Hilary Swank. Yeah her physicalness in the film's good but it's not like she was the best performance that year.I'd kind of recommend it although I have no idea why.

633218,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JNP1,C. Middleton,"[6, 10]","Deserving of all the accolades it has received, Million Dollar Baby stands out and rises above many films made in the last five years. What makes this film so good? I believe it is the perfect combination of a superb script by Paul Haggis, the vision and skill of the director, Clint Eastwood, and the stellar performances from the entire cast, particularly Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman. One other ingredient that turns this picture from a great one to a masterpiece, is its honesty, a pure truthfulness in the narrative, a real tragedy that long after the last credit rolls, the images and themes remain lodged in your memory.Hillary Swanks performance is really beyond any criticism. Her portrayal of Fitzgerald, the humble girl from hillbilly country, persisting to attain her dream as a prize-winning boxer, is inspiring; because of her utter lack of ego and pretension. Without giving anything away, her performance at the end of the film was extremely realistic and incredibly moving on many levels. In the end, the character of Fitzgerald is that type of woman you'd like to meet and know - a good person.Morgan Freeman has to be one of the best narrator's in the history of the cinema. One of his most memorable voice-overs was in one of my favourite films, The Shaw shank Redemption. In Million Dollar Baby, his narration carries the film and possesses that same resonance as Redemption. Freeman's character, again, was totally without pretence, a kind man and a friend we'd all like to have in our lives.Eastwood's transformation from the hard-hearted boxing trainer to a sensitive man is a subtle one but ultimately believable. The character's daughter has disowned him, as he continues for years to write her letters to only get them back as Return to Sender.

Morgan Freeman's character who narrates the film sets the tone from the get go with a traditional story telling approach, which is kind of rare in films these days. That was a nice touch. Hillary Swank's character is a completely unassuming, down-on-her luck but tough as nails chick who doesn't take no for an answer. Her tenacity pays off in regards to her pursuance of Clint Eastwood's character who is this legendary, almost larger than life boxing coach. She has been dealt a bad hand in the grand poker game of life, but she manages to keep an amazing poker face throughout her struggles and that is what makes her prevail to finally win in the biggest gamble of all. Boxing aside, which is the driving force in her life, the biggest victory for her is actually charming and befriending Frankie, Clint Eastwood's character. Reluctantly, perhaps due to old school views of traditional, sexist roles, Frankie doesn't want to take her on as a protoge', but after Morgan Freeman's character realizes her potential through a bit of boxing lessons and practice, Frankie slowly grows comfortable with the idea of taking on Swank's character, not to mention that she worked pretty hard to earn his attention and ultimately respect. Frankie and his apprentice are two lost souls who find themselves through each other, and even though the overlying theme is boxing, the heart of the story lies at the emotional bond that is forged through the melting of their spirits.The film is without a doubt a taxing experience on one's heart strings, and it manages to achieve that rare feat of connecting the audience with the characters on screen who become as real as the wind in one's hair. Throughout the film Frankie studies the ancient language known as Gaelic, which is spoken by some Irish and Scottish people, and he gives Maggie a Gaelic nickname with a very special meaning. I won't give anything away, but that nickname becomes of great importance later on in the film, which is a very poignant moment when its translation is finally revealed.Triumph of the human spirit and salvation are two of the major themes in this film, and very few films deal with it as well as this one. The music helps set the stage, and the use of shadows and lighting creates a feeling of bleakness and really brings to the forefront the defeat of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds. Clint Eastwood produced and directed this film, and it shows. His decades of experience in front of and behind the camera has made him a master of the art form, and he shines in both primary aspects of film making. Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman are without a doubt on par, and it's just a joy to see them synergize so well on screen. Their chemistry together comes from a shared passion of film making, which makes it a very moving experience.Maybe Hollywood's obsession with large budget, over-the-top special effects film is in a sense a good thing because their flaw makes this gem of a film seem perfect and shine all the brighter as an indirect effect.",5,Million Dollar Baby Packs A Punch,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,3131,"['saw', 'film', 'expectations', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'aspects', 'beginning', 'end', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'tone', 'get', 'go', 'traditional', 'story', 'telling', 'approach', 'kind', 'rare', 'films', 'days', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'character', 'completely', 'unassuming', 'down-on-her', 'luck', 'tough', 'nails', 'chick', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'tenacity', 'regards', 'pursuance', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'who', 'legendary', 'almost', 'larger', 'life', 'boxing', 'coach', 'been', 'dealt', 'bad', 'hand', 'grand', 'poker', 'game', 'life', 'keep', 'amazing', 'poker', 'face', 'struggles', 'what', 'prevail', 'finally', 'win', 'biggest', 'gamble', 'Boxing', 'aside', 'driving', 'force', 'life', 'biggest', 'victory', 'actually', 'charming', 'befriending', 'Frankie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Reluctantly', 'perhaps', 'due', 'old', 'school', 'views', 'traditional', 'sexist', 'roles', 'Frankie', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'protoge', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'potential', 'bit', 'boxing', 'lessons', 'practice', 'Frankie', 'slowly', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'taking', 'Swank', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'worked', 'pretty', 'hard', 'earn', 'attention', 'ultimately', 'respect', 'Frankie', 'apprentice', 'are', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'even', 'overlying', 'theme', 'boxing', 'heart', 'story', 'emotional', 'bond', 'forged', 'melting', 'spirits.The', 'film', 'doubt', 'taxing', 'experience', 'one', 'heart', 'strings', 'achieve', 'rare', 'feat', 'connecting', 'audience', 'characters', 'screen', 'who', 'become', 'as', 'real', 'wind', 'one', 'hair', 'film', 'Frankie', 'studies', 'ancient', 'language', 'known', 'Gaelic', 'spoken', 'Irish', 'Scottish', 'people', 'Maggie', 'Gaelic', 'nickname', 'very', 'special', 'meaning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'nickname', 'becomes', 'great', 'importance', 'later', 'film', 'very', 'poignant', 'moment', 'when', 'translation', 'finally', 'revealed.Triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'salvation', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'themes', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'deal', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'music', 'set', 'stage', 'use', 'shadows', 'lighting', 'feeling', 'bleakness', 'really', 'brings', 'forefront', 'defeat', 'overcoming', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'produced', 'directed', 'film', 'decades', 'experience', 'front', 'camera', 'made', 'master', 'art', 'form', 'primary', 'aspects', 'film', 'making', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'doubt', 'par', 'just', 'joy', 'see', 'synergize', 'so', 'well', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'together', 'shared', 'passion', 'film', 'making', 'very', 'moving', 'experience.Maybe', 'Hollywood', 'obsession', 'large', 'budget', 'over-the-top', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'sense', 'good', 'thing', 'flaw', 'gem', 'film', 'seem', 'perfect', 'shine', 'brighter', 'indirect', 'effect']",N/A

Swank, utterly fantastic in her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, a dirt poor trailer park denizen of southwestern Missouri is desperate to hone her pugilistic skills.  Eastwood assisted in his gym by the accomplished Morgan Freeman a washed up ex pug who serves as Clint's conscience.  Eastwood is finally cajoled into taking the determined Swank under his wing.  So begins a special relationship between Eastwood and Swank.  Eastwood finds in Swank, the daughter figure he lacks due to his unexplained estrangement from his own daughter.  Swank, close with her now deceased father, but distant from her self centered and dysfunctional hillbilly family looks at Eastwood as a paternal figure.Rising through the ranks and with hard work, Swank is elevated in stature to be deserving of a shot at the woman's world welterweight boxing championship.  At the pinnacle of her fame tragedy strikes.  What follows is an profound and emotional exploration into the psychology of interpersonal relationships.Kudos to Eastwood, Swank and Freeman for superlative acting performances in what could conceivably be the top picture of the year again under Eastwood's capable direction.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[4, 4]","Post-modernist film as, like Stephen Dedalus you don't know where the hero goes in the end, and there are no happy endings.Traditionally we are used to old boxing films that end on an upnote as in the unwatchable Rocky series, reflecting the ancient tradition. Then now just think about the Rod Sterling writing of Anthony Quinn's Requiem for a Heavyweight and Paul Newman in the early Sixties playing a punch-drunk and psychotic ex-fighter still in training. No happy endings there, none at all. And then look at Mr. Eastwood towards the end sitting reading with half glasses on the bedside. Looks like a clear reference to the later Mr. Newman, and thus a reference to his earlier work.Once again we are confronted with the moral issue of euthanasia, and a very heart-wrenching one. We are so ready for her to go all the way and to succeed, and then this . . .Post-modernist like the dark cinema of the fifties. Where does the Blue Bear go? What is her retribution, but a half million dollars? Why does no one even come near mentioning any kind of revenge upon her, as we might in other less well-written movies? Instead we hear of euthanasia. ANother trouble with the writing of Blue Bear is her origin. There was no prostitution under a truly Marxist system, but like Dolph Lungren or whatever in the old Rocky films, she is demonized by her land of origin. Prostitution is the ultimate capitalist phenomenom. In any case we wind up with the question euthansia.Was this done in the days of Schiavo, when this issue was at the forefront of our national debate? Clint, one of the last remaining sincere practicing and seeking Catholics, confronted with this controversy, and the priest little help, as always. I mean, Thou shalt not kill, right?Like those dark Fifty films, this movie pulls no punches in the end. Protect yourself as you watch this film.I do have a few issues with the writing, or rather, the casting. The whole Danger thing, for instance; I think another race might have better portrayed his attacker. Too much subtext going on there as it is. And that priest who pays no attention to Eastwood's character's desperate attempts at conversation but cusses at him and tells him incredibly that anyone who comes to MAss everyday for 23 years has sometihng wrong going on, that should never have been such a young priest who looks like he was still in grade school 23 years earlier, but an old burn out too tired and faithless now to discuss anymore the Trinity and the Immaculate Conception. I feel as a Catholic who has known many a priest over the years that the writing and casting of this subplot is not up to the excellence of the rest of the project, and it simply does not ring true, including the final counselling session on a pew, with the words the priest gives. Doesn't ring true. In fact, since it does not bear the seal of the confessional, the priest ought to go call the cops!I also wondered at CLint's character's ability to enter the private hospital room at night, set off the alarms on her breathing tube, and sit quietly getting ready to do her thing that she requested and fought for. I mean, nevre mind security, where were the night nurses?? Or did he really want to get caught, and stopped, in time?Only Morgan's character saw him.But Clint is at his best here, and that is really very great. THe reading of the IRish is wonderful, and the integration of that history and tradition, and the fight with the BRitish, rings and resounds proudly and loudly. See the Cyclops episode of James Joyce Ulysses for the history of pugilism between the Irish Catholic colonialists and the British. Fortunately that Missouri girl had a glad Irish name, which also rings right.One felicitous casting is the little sister of the main character. Isn't that the ex-wife of Earl, from My Name is Earl? What a creepy family. Trying to make the paraplegic sign over all her stuff by sticking a pen in her mouth reminds me of MacArthy's gay lawyer Roy Cohn forcing a signature onto legal documents out of a similarly incapacitated terminal patient. Wow.Excellent movie, if you are ready for no punches pulled. Protect yourself at all times.Don't be afraid to cry.

It is a poignant tale about hope, failure, and old ghosts.  It is also the best film Eastwood has ever made.Frankie Dunn is an aging owner of a boxing gym who trains a boxer to the brink of a title fight only to miss a timely opportunity.  When an aspiring female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), approaches him for training, he rebuffs her as just a girl boxer and too old at 31 years.  Maggie is a waitress whose desire to fight is her ultimate dream as she attempts to make something of her life that has been a rural, backwoods existence.  Dunn's best friend, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), takes a liking to the boxer's heart and work ethic, and eventually the two win Frankie over.  Frankie's rules are to never question him in training and to always protect oneself in the ring.  A slow but gradual learning curve ensues as Maggie becomes a polished boxer who displays a stunning record of wins, mostly by knockouts.  Meanwhile, Frankie takes a liking to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and begins to become attached to her.  Their relationship is a contrast to his personal demons. His soul struggles with doubt and guilt as he attends church with constant regularity and the letters he sends to his estranged daughter are always returned unopened.Maggie becomes the focal point of Frankie's world as she attracts boxing matches from top competition which leads to a possible championship in Las Vegas.  It is at this point that the story takes a path that is unexpected and startling.  It is here that two lives are changed forever and boxing seems trivial in light of subsequent events.  And it is here that hard choices and decisions are made.Based on a group of stories by the late F. X. Toole, Paul Haggis's screenplay is a beauty, filled with memorable dialogue and a story arc that takes its audience on a journey of humanity. The leading cast makes the most of the material. The scenes between Eastwood and Freeman ring true and validate two characters that go way back.  Most actors pale in comparison to these two consummate pros at the height of their powers. Morgan Freeman, whose character narrates the story much as he did in Shawshank Redemption, lends strong support.  Hilary Swank, who won an Oscar in Boys Don't Cry, is outstanding in a role which required rigorous training while etching a vivid character whose life takes a dramatic shift. Eastwood has always been a solid director and producer.  While his early films took advantage of his tough guy image and did not require much thespian range, he filled those roles quite successfully.  In recent years, he has grown as director and as a performer by allowing himself some choice dramatic projects (Unforgiven and Bridges of Madison County).  But this is without a doubt his greatest piece of acting.  He has allowed himself to let go and get to his inner self, and the results are touching and impressive.As a director, Eastwood has proven with films like Unforgiven and Mystic River that he has a strong, disciplined vision.  His work here is most assured and it is very evident that he has matched if not surpassed his previous highs.  He is patient and methodical in how he adds layers upon layers of dialogue and scenes to develop his characters into full blooded people. When Maggie approaches Frankie at first, he has no interest in training her, but you know these two will somehow end up working together.  Eastwood does not go for easy clich&eacute;s as she tries to win him over with help from Eddie.  Even when he uses tried and true formulas, he does them well.  And when Frankie decides to give her a chance, the journey is earned believably.  Eastwood's direction is economic and lean.  In fact, the pacing is deliberate and there is really no extraneous material (as in earlier good efforts like The Outlaw Josie Wales) to cut or trim.  It may be the best job of directing this past year.Technical categories are strong particularly in cinematography with the darkly lit scenes that add so much to the mood and texture of the moment, and the editing which lends much urgency to the fights and offers unique transitions in the dramatic scenes. (It is interesting that as Maggie ascends to bigger fight venues, the crowds are more affluent and better dressed by the costume department.)  Eastwood does a pretty good job of composing some eloquent music.  What a multitalented threat he is becoming!There is not much to quibble with this film. Sure, Maggie's white trash family is a bit too stereotypical and one dimensional.  We don't get to the bottom of Frankie's family background as much as we'd like.  Some of the fights are bloody and violent but not particularly gratuitous or self serving as in Raging Bull.What ostensibly starts out as a pretty darn good boxing story becomes transformed into a powerful human drama that eschews even its fighting pedigree.  Boxing is just a pretext for a much larger canvas.  There is the drama of individual struggle and achievement, yet the story aims much higher and raises the ante in tone and direction in ways the audience can't quite anticipate.  Eastwood challenges himself and the audience with a story that is not easy and pat. It is a movie that dares to go to areas that are controversial and gut wrenching.  While audiences may have a tough time sitting through Million Dollar Baby a second or third time, they sure as hell will be grateful they did just once.",5,Million Dollar Baby is rich in

Clint Eastwood is an experienced director who doesn't need overt, stylistic flourishes to make his point. His movies are the epitome of understatement. Fresh from the critical success of Mystic River, he is back with another minimalist yet thematically dark drama that works its way into your head in a powerful and emotionally affective way.While filmmakers like Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino belong to the Wal-Mart school of filmmaking with their obvious, overstated movies, Eastwood is couture-subtle, graceful filmmaking. Million Dollar Baby bucks the current trend that most Hollywood films adhere to by trying desperately to appeal to the largest demographic possible, usually a young one with disposable income. Eastwood isn't interested in demographics or test screenings.First and foremost, his movie is about characters and telling a story-a true rarity these days. He takes his time telling the story, letting us get to know the characters and settle into this world full of hard-working people who get by the best that they can with what they have. They aren't sophisticated people but have a quiet dignity. Million Dollar Baby explores the complex morality of death. It is not an easy matter and Eastwood doesn't let us off with easy answers. He keeps things honest and there is an authenticity to the way the characters act, feel and speak that avoids the tired cliches that fail most movies.The first DVD includes a theatrical trailer.The second DVD begins with a featurette called ""Born to Fight,"" that examines the characters in the movie. Real life boxer Lucia Rijker who trained Hilary Swank and was one her opponents in the movie talks about the art of boxing, coming off as quite eloquent and passionate about not just the sport but the movie as well.""The Producers' Round 15"" explores the origins of the movie. Producer Albert S. Ruddy recounts how he convinced F.X. Toole to option his book and get it away from HBO who was also interested in adapting it. This is an excellent look at how this project came together.This brings us to ""James Lipton Takes on Three,"" that features the host of The Actors Studio interviewing Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Swank right after they each won an Academy Award for the movie. Lipton is his usual pretentious self as he treats every question that he asks like it was the most important words ever spoken. Thankfully, the three actors cut through all of this as Freeman calls the Oscars a contest while Eastwood is his usual low-key self.Finally, the last disc contains Eastwood's elegant and understated score for Million Dollar Baby.",5,"Another understated, graceful drama from Eastwood",1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,2704,"['Untalented', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'mistake', 'keeping', 'movies', 'simple', 'obvious', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'experienced', 'director', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'overt', 'stylistic', 'flourishes', 'make', 'point', 'movies', 'are', 'epitome', 'understatement', 'Fresh', 'critical', 'success', 'Mystic', 'River', 'back', 'minimalist', 'yet', 'thematically', 'dark', 'drama', 'way', 'head', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'affective', 'way.While', 'filmmakers', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'belong', 'Wal-Mart', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'obvious', 'overstated', 'movies', 'Eastwood', 'couture-subtle', 'graceful', 'filmmaking', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'current', 'trend', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'adhere', 'trying', 'desperately', 'appeal', 'largest', 'demographic', 'possible', 'usually', 'young', 'one', 'disposable', 'income', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'interested', 'demographics', 'test', 'screenings.First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'characters', 'telling', 'story-a', 'true', 'rarity', 'days', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'letting', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'settle', 'world', 'full', 'hard-working', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'have', 'are', ""n't"", 'sophisticated', 'people', 'have', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'complex', 'morality', 'death', 'not', 'easy', 'matter', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'let', 'off', 'easy', 'answers', 'things', 'honest', 'authenticity', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'feel', 'speak', 'tired', 'cliches', 'fail', 'most', 'movies.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'called', 'Born', 'Fight', 'characters', 'movie', 'Real', 'life', 'boxer', 'Lucia', 'Rijker', 'who', 'trained', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'was', 'one', 'opponents', 'movie', 'talks', 'art', 'boxing', 'coming', 'off', 'quite', 'eloquent', 'passionate', 'not', 'just', 'sport', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Producers', 'Round', '15', 'origins', 'movie', 'Producer', 'Albert', 'S.', 'Ruddy', 'how', 'convinced', 'F.X', 'Toole', 'option', 'book', 'get', 'away', 'HBO', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'adapting', 'excellent', 'look', 'how', 'project', 'came', 'together.This', 'James', 'Lipton', 'Takes', 'Three', 'host', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'interviewing', 'Eastwood', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Swank', 'right', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'Lipton', 'usual', 'pretentious', 'self', 'question', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'words', 'ever', 'spoken', 'Thankfully', 'three', 'actors', 'cut', 'Freeman', 'Oscars', 'contest', 'Eastwood', 'usual', 'low-key', 'self.Finally', 'last', 'disc', 'Eastwood', 'elegant', 'understated', 'score', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby']",N/A

633234,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JNP1,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","To tell the truth, I had no real desire to see this film, even after it won Best Picture (I tend to be fairly unimpressed with the Oscar-dubbed ""best"" movies).  I also had the impression that it was ultimately a very sad motion picture, and it's hard for me to watch sad movies.  But - Morgan Freeman's in it, and (as I've said every time I review a Morgan Freeman movie), I consider Morgan Freeman to be the best actor working today.  So I watched the movie.  To say I was impressed and moved is an understatement.  Million Dollar Baby is a truly magnificent film that does indeed hearken back to the old days when movies touched lives rather than merely entertained.This movie plants its roots deeply into the human landscape, with the final hour riding a mighty wave of raw emotion.  What began as a film suddenly transforms into something much more real.  Much of the power of the whole story is subtly rendered, as past regrets lie hidden even as they influence everything that happens.  Morgan Freeman is, of course, masterful in his co-starring role, and Hilary Swank more than deserved the Best Actress statuette she claimed at the Oscars.  It is Clint Eastwood, though, who shines the brightest in this little universe of amazing stars.  As producer and director as well as actor, he once again proves himself to be among the most gifted artists of all time.  Much credit must also go the writer of the screenplay.  The writing is well-nigh perfect, particularly in the way it brings disparate elements together in the end.If I were to lay out the whole story, I could do it pretty quickly.  It's amazing how the most powerful of movies usually feature the simplest of stories.  If you don't know the story already, you really don't need to know what happens before you watch it (and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone), so I'll talk about the characters and what they represent (to me, at least).  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a classic underdog.  She has nothing but a dream and only one thing she cares about - and that is boxing.  Not only is she trying to penetrate what has always been a man's world, she also has another strike against her in the form of her age.  Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a long-time trainer and manager, is not about to start training a woman, especially a 32-year-old rookie.  Maggie has the heart of a champion, though, and she is simply not going to give up.  Dunn is a fascinating character - gruff on the outside, a loner, but also a man haunted by his past and obviously searching for something.  He attends Mass every single day, for example, and only to get the priest riled up with questions after every service.  We don't know much about his life other than what we see in the gym, but we know he has a daughter who returns every one of his weekly letters to her.  When he and Maggie finally team up together, their relationship runs deep.  Dunn becomes a surrogate father to Maggie, even as she becomes like a daughter to him - this latter point is expressed beautifully at the end.  Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Dunn's gym manager and only real friend is the bridge that finally brings them together.  He's a wonderful character in and of himself (as are several minor characters); we don't plumb his emotional depths the way we do those of Dunn and Maggie, but he is actually the narrator of this truly moving story (plus, we get to see him bring a real punk down a notch or two at one point).Maybe you're shying away from this film because it's about a female boxer - well, it's really about life itself.  Maybe you don't like sad movies - this film's worth the emotional turmoil it might put you through.  Maybe you're just biased against Best Picture award-winners.  All I can tell you is that I was all three of these things, and now I am here praising Million Dollar Baby in a loud voice.  This is filmmaking at its best; it will move even the hardest of hearts, and it will renew your faith in the ability of motion pictures to truly transport the human soul in the most compelling of ways.  Million Dollar Baby plays on the level of Greek tragedy, and that's something you can say of only a handful of recent movies.",5,Words can't describe just how magnificent a film this is,1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,4216,"['tell', 'truth', 'had', 'real', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'tend', 'be', 'fairly', 'unimpressed', 'Oscar-dubbed', 'best', 'movies', 'also', 'had', 'impression', 'was', 'ultimately', 'very', 'sad', 'motion', 'picture', 'hard', 'watch', 'sad', 'movies', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', ""'ve"", 'said', 'time', 'review', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'movie', 'consider', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'So', 'watched', 'movie', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'moved', 'understatement', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'film', 'indeed', 'hearken', 'back', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'movies', 'touched', 'lives', 'rather', 'merely', 'entertained.This', 'movie', 'plants', 'roots', 'deeply', 'human', 'landscape', 'final', 'hour', 'riding', 'mighty', 'wave', 'raw', 'emotion', 'What', 'began', 'film', 'suddenly', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'Much', 'power', 'whole', 'story', 'subtly', 'rendered', 'past', 'regrets', 'lie', 'hidden', 'even', 'influence', 'everything', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'course', 'masterful', 'co-starring', 'role', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'more', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'statuette', 'claimed', 'Oscars', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'though', 'who', 'brightest', 'little', 'universe', 'amazing', 'stars', 'producer', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'actor', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'most', 'gifted', 'artists', 'time', 'Much', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'well-nigh', 'perfect', 'particularly', 'way', 'disparate', 'elements', 'together', 'end.If', 'were', 'lay', 'out', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'do', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'amazing', 'how', 'most', 'powerful', 'movies', 'usually', 'feature', 'simplest', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'already', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'what', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'so', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'characters', 'what', 'represent', 'least', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'classic', 'underdog', 'nothing', 'dream', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'boxing', 'Not', 'only', 'trying', 'penetrate', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'man', 'world', 'also', 'strike', 'form', 'age', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'long-time', 'trainer', 'manager', 'not', 'start', 'training', 'woman', 'especially', '32-year-old', 'rookie', 'Maggie', 'heart', 'champion', 'simply', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'Dunn', 'fascinating', 'character', 'gruff', 'outside', 'loner', 'also', 'man', 'haunted', 'past', 'obviously', 'searching', 'something', 'Mass', 'single', 'day', 'example', 'only', 'get', 'priest', 'riled', 'up', 'questions', 'service', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'life', 'other', 'what', 'see', 'gym', 'know', 'daughter', 'who', 'one', 'weekly', 'letters', 'When', 'Maggie', 'finally', 'up', 'together', 'relationship', 'deep', 'Dunn', 'surrogate', 'father', 'Maggie', 'even', 'daughter', 'latter', 'point', 'expressed', 'beautifully', 'end', 'Eddie', 'Scrap-Iron', 'Dupris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Dunn', 'gym', 'manager', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'bridge', 'finally', 'together', 'wonderful', 'character', 'are', 'several', 'minor', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'plumb', 'emotional', 'depths', 'way', 'do', 'Dunn', 'Maggie', 'actually', 'narrator', 'truly', 'moving', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'bring', 'real', 'punk', 'down', 'notch', 'two', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'shying', 'away', 'film', 'female', 'boxer', 'well', 'really', 'life', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sad', 'movies', 'film', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'might', 'put', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'biased', 'Best', 'Picture', 'award-winners', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'three', 'things', 'now', 'am', 'here', 'praising', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'loud', 'voice', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'will', 'move', 'even', 'hardest', 'hearts', 'will', 'renew', 'faith', 'ability', 'motion', 'pictures', 'truly', 'transport', 'human', 'soul', 'most', 'compelling', 'ways', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'level', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'something', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'handful', 'recent', 'movies']",N/A

To review the movie, I have to avoid giving away the last third of the movie but, my reference to ""thirds"" indicates that I have divided the movie into three parts. First, an aspiring female boxer, Margaret Fitzgerald, who is already in her thirties comes to trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood. She wants him to train her and the first third of the movie governs this evolving relationship. The second part of the movie deals with her boxing career blooming and flourishing. The third part of the movie takes a major turn and the film takes on a much heavier quality.In the first two parts, which I can be more revealing about, the boxer, played by Hilary Swank, shows a grittiness and determination that is much more believable than that displayed in the movie Rocky. Additionally, the fight scenes and progression of her career is also more believable and realistic than in Rocky. Indeed, Rocky seems almost cartoonish compared to this. What really makes this film, however, is the third part which adds a dimension that is nonexistent in Rocky. I cannot reveal the last third of the movie other than to state that it takes a very heavy turn.

On the seat is a brand name, clearly arranged so the audience can see it.  While this bit of contrived product placement (one of many) seems shamelessly blatant, it fits right in to the general scheme of ""million dollar baby,"" a movie as overtly forced and grating as Hillary Swank's southern accent.The movie revolves around boxer Maggie Fitzgerald.  She is 31 (too old), from the hills of Missouri (not the right social class) and she's a woman trying to make it in a man's world.  Gee, do you think she's going to become an underdog contender for the championship?  Supporting her is a crusty old trainer who is estranged from his daughter and can't forgive himself because a fighter he was servicing was maimed in the ring.  Plus, he doesn't train ""girls.""  Gee, do you think he's going to overcome his prejudice, accept Maggie as his surrogate daughter and lead her to super-stardom?  If you answered ""no"" to either of these questions, you obviously haven't seen very many movies.  The closest thing to novelty in this movie is the fact that the fighter is female, but female boxers have been around long enough that it isn't much of a novelty anymore.Along for the ride is Morgan Freeman's character, ""Scrap.""  He acts as narrator, moral conscience and general aid to Swank and Eastwood.  Unfortunately, he spends a lot of time telling us things that should be made apparent through the events of the movie.  Apparently the writer has never heard the saying, ""show, don't tell.""Perhaps that's not fair.  The movie does some showing as well, such as Maggie's stereotypical lazy, materialistic hillbilly family, Maggie's talent displayed in a seemingly endless series of one-round KO's, and Eastwood's frequent badgering of a local priest whose only role seems to be to show how out of touch Christianity is with Hollywood's ethics (one guess which one comes out on top).  All of this doesn't just pull for an emotional reaction, it grabs you, shakes you and dares you not to  get choked up.Despite itself, ""Million Dollar Baby"" does prove to be enjoyable.  The casting is first rate, the interactions between the three main characters (Eastood, Swank and Freeman) are enjoyable to watch, and the obligatory title fight provides some real suspense.  One dares to think that if director Eastwood had added just a hint of subtlety it could have been great.

633241,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JNP1,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 10]","Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood.  Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999).  It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award.  The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best.  I would not however recommend that everybody see this.  The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.Morgan Freeman as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood).  Scrap is addressing somebody.  At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say).  This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull.  Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words ""Return to Sender"" on them.  Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him.  I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter.  Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman.  But the story does not end like a ""Rocky"" contrivance.  Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people.  There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone.  It is also Frankie's.  And it is Scrap-Iron's as well.  If only Frankie had not trained her.  If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner.  If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie.  ""If only,"" like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens.  Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that.  Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma.  Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion.  Yet he feels he must do it.How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not.  His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.I quit watching boxing on TV many years ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless.  I don't like feeling like that.  This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.Some people might be wondering what the message here is.

Leach,"[0, 5]","Slight spoiler alert for the first paragraph here- There's no doubt that this is a very well made film better than about 95% of the idiotic drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days. That said, I found Maggie's fate hard to stomach and while I was shocked and saddened, I felt rather manipulated by this one in a million freak tragedy that seemed a little contrived and overly depressing.While I've seen enough daytime talk and judge shows to know all too well how low-down and trashy people can be, Maggie's family is so god awful and heartless that I had a hard time viewing them as realistic, three dimensional characters. I feel like our emotions as the audience aren't allowed to develop on their own; instead we're force-fed heinous, quasi-cartoonish villainy from the film's antagonists, especially from the East German monster bit#@ from Hades. I think a bit more subtlety might have been in order. A lot of otherwise good movies seem to suffer from this ""go for the emotional jugular"" syndrome. I'm reminded of the aspiring actor killing himself in Dead Poet's Society. Why not just hit the road and starve as a struggling actor and say to hell with your dad? Things like that happen a lot with young adults. Eventually you and your old man will probably declare a truce. But to kill yourself? It seems so melodramatic and senseless. SEVERE SPOILER ALERT! DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! On the same token, I feel that maybe Maggie's promising boxing career could have been ended as a result of the nasty cheapshot, but to be vegetative and die a wasting death, it just seems slightly over the top.On the plus side, the acting is very good; Swank is perfectly cast and Eastwood and Freeman are their usual solid selves. I did find Maggie's initial utter ineptitude with the punching bag a little unbelievable for somebody who has supposedly been boxing for years. Also, I don't know if I completely buy the semi-retarded ""Danger"" character. All in all though, the film is worth seeing, just not for the faint of heart or those prone to depression.

That said, this is an acutely tender, compelling drama, featuring three very believable characters in an unusual setting:  women's boxing.  And of course, this is a film directed by Clint Eastwood, who has become one of the elites of even elite filmmakers.We all know the story.  An impoverished waitress (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion boxer; as her mentor, she wants grizzled, veteran manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood).  Yet Frankie resists, and resists aggressively, as he wants no part of women's boxing, yet Maggie (Swank's character) persists.  Plus, she touches a nerve in the old, wily manager, a parental nerve in a lonely man who is very much estranged from his own daughter.  Aided by Frankie's longtime friend and partner Eddie (Morgan Freeman), the duo achieves skyrocketing success along the women's boxing circuit--until unspeakable tragedy takes place.  And then Frankie is faced with some very difficult decisions.Believability.  That's what is so strong in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, from Frankie's grungy boxing gym, to the boxing action, to the tenderness between Eastwood and Swank's characters.  It's all very compelling--it's all literally heartbreaking.

However, my eyes were riveted on the screen from start to finish as I watched ""Million Dollar Baby."" To begin with, the acting was outstanding. Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn) and Hilary Swank (Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald) played the part of crusty, embittered trainer and aspiring boxer to perfection. Next, the storyline itself was, for the most part, compelling. Dunn, who is estranged from his wife and wants to be close to no one, and in addition trains only male boxers, is won over by the sheer enthusiasm and optimism of Maggie, and winds up training her, molding her natural but hitherto undeveloped talent to the point where she becomes (through sheer hard work and grit) an outstanding boxer. Fight after fight she outclasses her opponents, typically knocking them out in the first round, until she fights for the championship.From this description (which is exclusively of the first part of the movie) it may appear that this is a somewhat trite story about boxing. But it is far more than this. It is also an account of love, loyalty, and deep emotions, and in the end a story of how we must deal with painful and gut-wrenching decisions.On every level, this is a great film. The only type of person I would not encourage seeing this movie is someone who is satisfied only if the movie has a happy ending.

Pawl ""Dani""","[9, 13]","For me, MILLION DOLLAR BABY actually surpassed all if its acclaim, with its strong, stirring acting, compelling story and beautiful character development.  This earned well earned Oscars (among others, Best Actress for the wonderful Hilary Swank and Best Picture), and is definitely a film that director Clint Eastwood has a lot to be proud of.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a dirt poor, Missouri-born waitress who lives such an impoverished life that her meals consist of leftovers from customer's plates after closing time.  She is drawn to boxing because she has spent her life just fighting to subsist in day-to-day life and really has nothing much to live for at all.  Maggie encounters Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), an excellent boxing trainer, during one of his matches.  The grizzled, seventy-four year old trainer just retorts, ""I don't train girls"" in response to Maggie's enthusiasm.  Frankie is a man who has been estranged from his own daughter for some years, writes her letters that are all returned, and attends daily mass.  Why, we aren't sure.  Whatever it is he is repenting for, it has eaten a hole in his heart.  Nevertheless, Maggie persists, turns up at the gym, and steadfastly proceeds to tirelessly beat the punching bag until he can't ignore her anymore.  She also makes an impression on Frankie's best friend, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), his steadfast friend who lost an eye in a boxing match some years ago.This film truly transcends gender, subject matter and generations to emerge as a great friend about the triumph of the human spirit, and also the fragility of life.  Hilary Swank will permeate your soul, make you smile, and then proceed to break your heart in, this, one of her most sizzling screen performances yet.  Clint Eastwood's transformation as the wounded Frankie is touching to watch, and Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always (and received a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar).",5,"beautiful, powerful and chilling.....",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,1954,"['MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'BABY', 'actually', 'surpassed', 'acclaim', 'strong', 'stirring', 'acting', 'compelling', 'story', 'beautiful', 'character', 'development', 'earned', 'well', 'earned', 'Oscars', 'others', 'Best', 'Actress', 'wonderful', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Best', 'Picture', 'definitely', 'film', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'lot', 'be', 'proud', 'of.Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'dirt', 'poor', 'Missouri-born', 'waitress', 'who', 'impoverished', 'life', 'meals', 'consist', 'leftovers', 'customer', 'plates', 'closing', 'time', 'drawn', 'boxing', 'spent', 'life', 'just', 'fighting', 'subsist', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'really', 'nothing', 'much', 'live', 'Maggie', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'excellent', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'one', 'matches', 'grizzled', 'seventy-four', 'year', 'old', 'trainer', 'just', 'retorts', 'do', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'response', 'Maggie', 'enthusiasm', 'Frankie', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'estranged', 'own', 'daughter', 'years', 'letters', 'are', 'returned', 'daily', 'mass', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Whatever', 'repenting', 'eaten', 'hole', 'heart', 'Nevertheless', 'Maggie', 'up', 'gym', 'steadfastly', 'proceeds', 'tirelessly', 'beat', 'punching', 'bag', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'anymore', 'also', 'impression', 'Frankie', 'best', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'Scrap', 'Iron', 'Dupris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'steadfast', 'friend', 'who', 'lost', 'eye', 'boxing', 'match', 'years', 'ago.This', 'film', 'truly', 'gender', 'subject', 'matter', 'generations', 'emerge', 'great', 'friend', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'also', 'fragility', 'life', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'will', 'permeate', 'soul', 'make', 'smile', 'then', 'proceed', 'break', 'heart', 'one', 'most', 'sizzling', 'screen', 'performances', 'yet', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'transformation', 'wounded', 'Frankie', 'touching', 'watch', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'wonderful', 'always', 'received', 'much-deserved', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar']",N/A

The plot has an unexpected twist in it, and I would admonish people who view this movie NOT to find out what the twist is before watching it.I swear, you could dress Clint Eastwood up in a pink dress, put little girly hairpins in his hair and he would STILL be more macho than the lot of we men.  In this film, he portrays a past-his-prime boxing trainer who is without any top-notch contenders to teach.Hilary Swank is a girl who shows up @ the gym some day, pays her dues and wants to get a trainer.  Eastwood's character is reluctant to be her manager as he's never dealt with women boxers below.  However, in the end her charm wins him over.Morgan Freeman is great as an over-the-hill boxer who had a very bad experience in his final bout.  His character is kind of the ""stabilizing force"" of the movie.Hilary is toned & buff for the film.  She looks sexy even with a broken nose and blood all over her face.  On top of that, she's an accomplished actress.  This will be one of the most memorable roles in this timespan of her career, although I have a feeling she will still be active as an actress in her 50's & 60's.This is a sports movie, but it is a very atypical one.  It is as much about Hilary's character as it is about her boxing prowess.  Hilary portrays a girl trying to break away from poverty, and the thing she is best at is boxing.

There have been many beautiful cinematic tales created by interweaving and paralelling the blows that the fighter takes in the ring, and the blows that they take in the outside world.In 'Million Dollar Baby' Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald, does not have much going for her. She is working a dead end minimum wage job as a waitress and sees boxing as an escape from the banality. Although this setup would appear to be leading towards a cliched Hollywood ending of a working girl making it to the big time and becoming the champion, the reality is far more original. 'Million Dollar Baby' shows how directors these days are moving away from the old fashioned 'happy ending' and are starting to prefer the more gritty real world endings.Swank stars alongside Clint Eastood and Morgan Freeman who provides a narrative that is by turns poignant and humourous and serves the story well. Freeman and Eastwood also work well as a juxtaposed attitude to Swank's character. They are older men and know the boxing game well and bear the phsical and mental scars that come with it. This contrasts well with the youthful exuberance and naivety of Maggie.Overall 'Million Dollar Baby' is a well acted and well directed film that is deserving of it's 4 Oscars.

Eastwood skillfully employs all of these well-worn familiarities to draw in as wide an audience as possible, then springs the REAL subject of his movie on us about 2/3rds of the way through.The only irritating thing I found in this movie was how much it stretched the viewer's credulity with the evil villain boxer (played by real-life women's kickboxing champ Lucia Ryjker) getting away with all sorts of flagrant and dirty tricks in the ring...unnecessary and obtrusive.  The fight scenes are not very realistic but still way better than most Hollywood boxing movies, particularly the ludicrous ""Rocky"" series.  In fact about the only boxing film that can be put on the same level as this one is Scorsese's ""Raging Bull.""NOTE: those who have not seen this film are advised to stop reading *now.*This film is really not about the glories of fighting in and out of the ring, but also about knowing when to LET GO of fighting, to walk away and just let a dying horse die in peace...in this case through euthanasia.  Eastwood seems to be implying that while fighting is what gets us through life very often, if we do enough of it, at some point there comes a time to simply let go of it and move on: the fighting spirit transforms into the peaceful, accepting and compassionate spirit, at last totally emptied of, and freed from, itself.  Which is pretty much what Eastwood and Swank's characters undergo.  In fact Maggie can be read as basically a representation of Eastwood's real soul, when he extinguishes her he is also extinguishing his own dead-end life that was defined by the boxing gym and his futile attempts to communicate with his estranged daughter.This is an Eastwood film that truly deserves its Oscars, it shows a director at the august peak of his powers.

633263,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNP1,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his filmmaking techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.Written by Paul Haggis (Crash), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version ofRocky. A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a filmmaking master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn inThe Bridges of Madison Countyhas he made himself so vulnerable onscreen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voiceover letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn inThe Shawshank Redemption. That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, ""Born to Fight"", which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is ""The Producers' Round 15"", a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, ""James Lipton Takes on Three"" with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of ""Inside the Actors' Studio"". Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony.",5,Three-Disc DVD Set Highlights An Eastwood Masterwork

633264,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,B00005JNP1,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[0, 0]","First, I dont give many films five stars. I believe the absolute pinnacle of filmmaking and talent with an ensemble cast that brings cohesion and belivability, makes a five star film. Fanboys and fanatical followers who follow their fav actors or directors around like lemmings and unfairly give their work five stars is sophmoric. I believe films like Empire of the Sun, Europe Europa, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List, E.T., Dead Poet's Society, Zeff's Romeo and Juliet, even Saw, are five star films. I finally have room to garner another film five stars, thus is 'Million Dollar Baby'.Million dollar baby gave me an upper cut in which I still have not regained consciousness from. A mind numbing extasy of emotion, surrounded by a cornucopia of unpredictability, that I wanted to lather in its warmth and tenderness long after the rolling credits whited out an otherwise black screen. All I can simply find the need to say now is 'WOW'. Without a doubt this emotional masterpiece of finely honed craft, is without question, and rarely do I ever say this, one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.I had given the idea to seeing this some thought several times, but loathing anything Clint Eastwood and my inate disdain to boxing, simply left my tongue dry with any thought of watering it. I was very surprised by my addiction to it from jumpstreet. During many moments I was grilled to the tv, so close I could hear my mother as a child telling me I would go blind because I was sitting so close to it. Actually routing her on from time to time, like we all did in Rocky, it made me smile and cheer and cry and think; it told me in a fashion that few films do, to move with your heart, think that you will acheive greatness, despite everyone around you saying you can't and despite obstacles, and the film spoke to me, in its own personal way, telling me not to take anything for granted.I like the fact that a film can be an uplifting experience that stays with you days after you view it. Sure nothing wrong with a Harrison Ford flick once and again, but nothing beats the feeling of walking out of something tangible, that you can feel a part of.Million Dollar Baby, full of stucco bravado and yearning contempt towards status quo and mainstream, its message is a strong and important one, a redefining look at the underdog in its capacity to have others pay attention, stagggeringly detailed in its tempo, it marvels in a way that makes me want to quit my every day job or night job I have, collect all the bills in the mattress and head out and be a filmmaker. Damn I dont know about you, but if I made a film, and someone, anyone, said that about my film, it would fill me with tears and a joy in which I know, wholeheartedly, would be the reason why film is made.A way past prime female boxer, gets a chance from a worldclass trainer, in his own right, bitter with his ways, to train her to be the best in the world, and thus both finding solace through each other, which grows as each one learns more about the others world and where they came from. It's tender and tragic and seems to find its way from every nuance and turn in a fine display of cinematography and acting, that is uncompromisable.The only moments that made the film stretch a bit, which really bothered me, as it was THAT good, was boy with serious issues that looked like he had turrets was very annoying, and not needed in any fashion and his return was pointless (save sticking with a dream) and unncessary.",5,Absolutely stunning.,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,3502,"['First', 'dont', 'give', 'many', 'films', 'five', 'stars', 'believe', 'absolute', 'pinnacle', 'filmmaking', 'talent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'cohesion', 'belivability', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'Fanboys', 'fanatical', 'followers', 'who', 'follow', 'fav', 'actors', 'directors', 'lemmings', 'unfairly', 'give', 'work', 'five', 'stars', 'sophmoric', 'believe', 'films', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'Europe', 'Europa', 'Remains', 'Day', 'Schindler', 'List', 'E.T.', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Zeff', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'even', 'Saw', 'are', 'five', 'star', 'films', 'finally', 'have', 'room', 'garner', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'thus', ""'Million"", 'Dollar', ""Baby'.Million"", 'dollar', 'baby', 'gave', 'upper', 'cut', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'regained', 'consciousness', 'mind', 'numbing', 'extasy', 'emotion', 'surrounded', 'cornucopia', 'unpredictability', 'wanted', 'lather', 'warmth', 'tenderness', 'long', 'rolling', 'credits', 'whited', 'out', 'otherwise', 'black', 'screen', 'can', 'simply', 'find', 'need', 'say', 'now', ""'WOW"", 'doubt', 'emotional', 'masterpiece', 'finely', 'honed', 'craft', 'question', 'rarely', 'do', 'ever', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life.I', 'had', 'given', 'idea', 'seeing', 'thought', 'several', 'times', 'loathing', 'anything', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'inate', 'disdain', 'boxing', 'simply', 'left', 'tongue', 'dry', 'thought', 'watering', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'addiction', 'jumpstreet', 'many', 'moments', 'was', 'grilled', 'tv', 'close', 'could', 'hear', 'mother', 'child', 'telling', 'would', 'go', 'was', 'sitting', 'so', 'close', 'Actually', 'routing', 'time', 'time', 'did', 'Rocky', 'made', 'smile', 'cheer', 'cry', 'think', 'told', 'fashion', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'move', 'heart', 'think', 'will', 'acheive', 'greatness', 'everyone', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'obstacles', 'film', 'spoke', 'own', 'personal', 'way', 'telling', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'granted.I', 'fact', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'days', 'view', 'Sure', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'flick', 'once', 'again', 'nothing', 'feeling', 'walking', 'something', 'tangible', 'can', 'feel', 'part', 'of.Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'full', 'stucco', 'bravado', 'yearning', 'contempt', 'towards', 'status', 'quo', 'mainstream', 'message', 'strong', 'important', 'one', 'redefining', 'look', 'underdog', 'capacity', 'have', 'others', 'pay', 'attention', 'stagggeringly', 'detailed', 'tempo', 'way', 'want', 'quit', 'day', 'job', 'night', 'job', 'have', 'collect', 'bills', 'mattress', 'head', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'Damn', 'dont', 'know', 'made', 'film', 'someone', 'anyone', 'said', 'film', 'would', 'fill', 'tears', 'joy', 'know', 'wholeheartedly', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'made.A', 'way', 'prime', 'female', 'boxer', 'chance', 'worldclass', 'trainer', 'own', 'right', 'bitter', 'ways', 'train', 'be', 'best', 'world', 'thus', 'finding', 'solace', 'other', 'one', 'more', 'others', 'world', 'where', 'came', 'tender', 'tragic', 'find', 'way', 'nuance', 'turn', 'fine', 'display', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'uncompromisable.The', 'only', 'moments', 'made', 'film', 'stretch', 'bit', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'THAT', 'good', 'was', 'boy', 'serious', 'issues', 'looked', 'had', 'turrets', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'not', 'needed', 'fashion', 'return', 'was', 'pointless', 'save', 'sticking', 'dream', 'unncessary']",N/A

The story is really about building deep relationships with people who seem unlikely allies, about choosing your own family when your own family disappoints you, and choosing your battles (both literally and figuratively). Often, those closest to us and who understand us best are not in fact people related to us by the accident of being family but are people with whom we find ourselves sharing life's best and/or worst moments. The kind of bonds and indeed ""love"" that is unconditional, as the film deftly illustrates. Nothing breaks that kind of loyalty.Morgan Freeman narrates the story of a gym owner/boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who (battling his own personal demons) very reluctantly agrees to train an eager, ambitious female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). Frankie and Maggie build a very solid rapport, and this bond seems to grow. As it grows, this bond fills a hole in Frankie's life that has been bothering him for a long time (the estrangement from his daughter, for example, has haunted and hurt him for years, leading him to make daily visits to church, where he pesters his frustrated priest). The relationship Maggie and Frankie forge is real, is close, is loyal and familial... he looks after her and feels for her like a father for his daughter. When Maggie's family uses her and attempts to manipulate her (while making fun of her), Frankie is there for Maggie, wishing to protect her from this ""sponging"" family dynamic.While the entire cast is wonderful, and Morgan Freeman turns in an amazing performance, the most remarkable aspect of Hilary Swank's career and double Oscar win is that she was once FIRED from Beverly Hills, 90210, which could easily make almost any actor give up, but Swank chose to fight and thrive on a small failure, proving her own tenacity and clout. The understated, excellent performances create a vivid, deeply moving (and quite sad) story, definitely worth seeing.",5,friends are the family you choose,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2149,"['story', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'not', 'something', 'entirely', 'unique', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'dismiss', 'female', 'boxing', 'movie', 'characterization', 'would', 'be', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'unfair', 'story', 'really', 'building', 'deep', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'choosing', 'own', 'family', 'when', 'own', 'family', 'disappoints', 'choosing', 'battles', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Often', 'closest', 'who', 'understand', 'best', 'are', 'not', 'fact', 'people', 'related', 'accident', 'being', 'family', 'are', 'people', 'whom', 'find', 'sharing', 'life', 'best', 'and/or', 'worst', 'moments', 'kind', 'bonds', 'indeed', 'love', 'unconditional', 'film', 'deftly', 'Nothing', 'breaks', 'kind', 'loyalty.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'story', 'gym', 'owner/boxing', 'trainer', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'battling', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'train', 'eager', 'ambitious', 'female', 'boxer', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Frankie', 'Maggie', 'build', 'very', 'solid', 'rapport', 'bond', 'grow', 'bond', 'hole', 'Frankie', 'life', 'been', 'bothering', 'long', 'time', 'estrangement', 'daughter', 'example', 'haunted', 'hurt', 'years', 'leading', 'make', 'daily', 'visits', 'church', 'where', 'frustrated', 'priest', 'relationship', 'Maggie', 'Frankie', 'forge', 'real', 'close', 'loyal', 'familial', 'feels', 'father', 'daughter', 'When', 'Maggie', 'family', 'attempts', 'manipulate', 'making', 'fun', 'Frankie', 'there', 'Maggie', 'wishing', 'protect', 'sponging', 'family', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'amazing', 'performance', 'most', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'career', 'double', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'once', 'FIRED', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'almost', 'actor', 'give', 'up', 'Swank', 'chose', 'fight', 'thrive', 'small', 'failure', 'proving', 'own', 'tenacity', 'clout', 'understated', 'excellent', 'performances', 'create', 'vivid', 'deeply', 'moving', 'quite', 'sad', 'story', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

This one was pleasantly an exception!I don't think any one performance stood out here really. It was all a blend of strong performances put together that made this film work. Clint Eastwood's character is almost a rip-off of the late Burgess Merideith's ""Mickey"" from the Rocky films only he wasn't ever a boxer, just a corner man and trainer. But, unlike Mickey, there are a lot of underlining issues in his past that he wrestles with throughout the film.Morgan Freeman's character is the ""Ying"" to Eastwood's ""Yang."" An ex-fighter who is the reasoning side of this duo who eventually influences Eastwood to train Hilary Swank's character Maggie.Swank's performance as the simple but full of heart fighter Maggie is very good.

First of all, the movie is good, and Clint and Morgan are great as they almost always are.  Here are the problems.  The boxing story is not original, it is essentially the Rocky story until after the climax. Also, the dialogue, although good, is over-the-top or just trying too hard sometimes, especially the voice over, which tries to heighten the circumstances or make things profound, but often comes off more artificial than natural.I also thought the returned letters were straight out of Forest Gump, another thing that struck me as unoriginal.  Also, the lighting, which is strong and sometimes breath-taking, often is done at the expense of the story.  For instance the car ride scene, has very interesting (although unnatural) effects, but to such an extent that one hardly pays attention to what is spoken. Also, it's not very plausible that Clint, in a dirty old inner city gym, gets not one but two talented atheletes that get title shots.  Worse than that, the climax scene with the dirty boxer isn't even plausible, there is no way she is sanctioned to fight and especially not allowed to continue her match after the violations that occur.  It was more like WWF than boxing. The whole ending was touching I guess, but nothing remarkable.  Also, the red neck stereotype was overdone, and Swank's whole relation with her family was summed up in cute soundbites. Although it is a fine movie with some brilliant flourishes, it is too standard and flawed to be considered great in any sense.",3,"Good, but heavily over-rated movie",1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1613,"['was', 'enthusiastic', 'renting', 'movie', 'realizationwas', 'less', 'original', 'provoking', 'thought', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'good', 'Clint', 'Morgan', 'are', 'great', 'almost', 'always', 'are', 'Here', 'are', 'problems', 'boxing', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'essentially', 'Rocky', 'story', 'climax', 'Also', 'dialogue', 'good', 'over-the-top', 'just', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'voice', 'heighten', 'circumstances', 'make', 'things', 'profound', 'often', 'off', 'more', 'artificial', 'natural.I', 'also', 'thought', 'returned', 'letters', 'were', 'straight', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'thing', 'struck', 'unoriginal', 'Also', 'lighting', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'breath-taking', 'often', 'done', 'expense', 'story', 'instance', 'car', 'ride', 'scene', 'very', 'interesting', 'unnatural', 'effects', 'extent', 'one', 'hardly', 'attention', 'what', 'spoken', 'Also', 'not', 'very', 'plausible', 'Clint', 'dirty', 'old', 'inner', 'city', 'gym', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'talented', 'atheletes', 'get', 'title', 'shots', 'Worse', 'climax', 'scene', 'dirty', 'boxer', ""n't"", 'even', 'plausible', 'way', 'sanctioned', 'fight', 'especially', 'not', 'allowed', 'continue', 'match', 'violations', 'occur', 'was', 'more', 'WWF', 'boxing', 'whole', 'ending', 'was', 'touching', 'guess', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'Also', 'red', 'neck', 'stereotype', 'was', 'overdone', 'Swank', 'whole', 'relation', 'family', 'was', 'summed', 'up', 'cute', 'soundbites', 'fine', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'flourishes', 'too', 'standard', 'flawed', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'sense']",N/A

I had completely giving up on the academy since the ""A BEAUTIFUL MIND"" disaster. Best Director and best film the year David Lynch helmed Mulholland Drive !!So, I was watching the Oscars the other night (Chris rock OK but so out of place),and at that time i hadn't seen MILLION DOLLAR BABY 5film got out in march in France). Quite frankly, despite the fact that I thought ""The Aviator"" was within the three worst Scorcese Films of all time (the two others being ""Gangs of NY"" and ""Bringing out the dead""), I was hoping that they would give him an Oscar so that he would finally stop to be such a ""good boy"" and do the film Hollywood are expecting him to do. In his unnerving quest to be so loved, scorcese has forgotten what made his talent, his cynicism. ""Please give him something so that he will do goods movies again"" i was yelling in fornt of my scren but they finnally gave ot to Clint. Again.And then I saw Million dollar Baby. I am 6foot1, 240 pounds. I was crying for the last hour of the movie, and again for two hours afterwards.MDB is for sure for now the best film of this century, probably Eastwood's best. Where did Eastwood found inside of him, this somber pain, this gentle despair. How can someone so painfully describe the depths of a man's soul.I never saw an audience gasp like when Eastwood gives the meaning of the two Irish words that everybody in the room was waiting for. Everone was waiting for this moment to happen, but everybody in the room couldn't stop crying.Eastwood is like a boxer, we know he is gonna hit us, we know how he's gonna hit us, but still it hurts. He found news ways to show us the gentle and the painful, the other side of the American Dream the lengths of solitude.As an actor, I always thought eastwood was bad but here he is for once is not acting too bad, when we see tears rolling down his grand canyon of a face, well it is breaking our hearts, over and over. Freeman is like always, honest.Hillary Swank is beyond everything I have seen. Giving her the Oscar is almost an understatement. She's the part, she breaks your heart. She's so remarkable; I wonder how she got away from this movie unarmed.Eastwood is giving, movie after movie, incredible presents to his actors. STREEP, WHITAKER, HACKMAN, even COSTNER for godsakes, were at their best with him. (I didn't like too much PENN in River but, well, he got away with an Oscar, right?)Eastwood is gently (again this word) giving us incredible films that we will remember forever. I thought he would never outperformed his 90's trilogy (MADISON, PERFECT WORLD, UNFORGIVEN), and quite frankly some of the late movies were a bit lazy.Million Dollar Baby is a gift to the audiences and I had forgotten how pleasant it was to leave a theater aftr having cried for 30 minutes.Thank you Clint.",5,So perfect it hurts.

It adds up to about an hour of extras -- a puny showing for any major film on DVD, much less the most honored movie of the year. Feel free to throw beer and popcorn.As for the main event, there's still reason to cheer: ""Million Dollar Baby"" looks and sounds like, well, a million bucks. The film's flat color scheme comes across suitably downbeat with its queasy greens, pale blues and nicotine grays. The widescreen images unspool in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), as shot. The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio delivers the body blows with authority; the subwoofer shovels out foreboding and menace. The surround arena seems mostly abandoned until the big fight scenes, when it comes to life with a jolt. There is no DTS option.The extras deliver almost nothing on how the boxing was shot or staged -- a shame because this ""Baby"" delivered some of the most visceral fight scenes since ""Raging Bull."" (MGM's recent DVD of ""Raging Bull"" got it right, with exhaustive breakdowns of Robert De Niro's bouts.)Those seeking an old-fashioned boxing drama that refuses to be tied up by sentiment are directed to Robert Wise's 1949's ""The Set-Up,"" released last summer by Warner.",3,A wimp on DVD,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1463,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'undisputed', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'film', 'world', 'dive', 'DVD', 'Check', 'out', 'extra-features', 'undercard', 'embarrassing', 'roundtable', 'session', 'Eastwood', 'stars', 'leftover', 'promo', 'piece', 'talking-head', 'bits', 'producers', 'trailer', 'up', 'hour', 'extras', 'puny', 'showing', 'major', 'film', 'DVD', 'much', 'less', 'most', 'honored', 'movie', 'year', 'Feel', 'free', 'throw', 'beer', 'popcorn.As', 'main', 'event', 'still', 'reason', 'cheer', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'well', 'million', 'bucks', 'film', 'flat', 'color', 'scheme', 'suitably', 'downbeat', 'queasy', 'greens', 'pale', 'blues', 'nicotine', 'grays', 'widescreen', 'images', 'unspool', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', 'shot', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'audio', 'delivers', 'body', 'authority', 'subwoofer', 'out', 'foreboding', 'menace', 'surround', 'arena', 'mostly', 'abandoned', 'big', 'fight', 'scenes', 'when', 'life', 'jolt', 'DTS', 'option.The', 'extras', 'deliver', 'almost', 'nothing', 'how', 'boxing', 'was', 'shot', 'staged', 'shame', 'Baby', 'delivered', 'most', 'visceral', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'MGM', 'recent', 'DVD', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'got', 'right', 'exhaustive', 'breakdowns', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'bouts', 'seeking', 'old-fashioned', 'boxing', 'drama', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'sentiment', 'are', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Wise', '1949', 'Set-Up', 'released', 'last', 'summer', 'Warner']",N/A

The whole of the score is completely altered by the final third, which is a discussion of the problems around the topic: Am I allowed to switch off the infimary-machines, helping to realize the wish of a dying human being? Why Clint Eastwood won the contest against the ""Aviator"" of the Martin Scorsese? We can see a bit of ourselves (future) in Maggie's destiny: Struggling against a social trash background, winning with great effort a short phase of joy and acknowledgement - and third: who of us knows anything about the circumstances of the days, our life comes to an end? This is a film of the faces and feelings (the ""Aviator"" mostly deliveres pictures of megalomaniac technology). Alike his Boxer Maggie (Hilary Swank) the producer Eastwood started with Scorsese a challenge fight in different weight classes: The Aviator was substantially more expensively. That the Americans gave the OSCAR to Clint's small producing team with a human topic in the middle of the story, and not to the nation-pride supporting loveness into technical show-products like the world biggest airplane - that's pleasant in an european view of sight. As the best foreign film was honoured the spanish movie the ""Sea In Me"" - likewise a movie about the right, to cut the life of a suffering patient. And I believe that the recent American law decision for switching off the coma female patient Terri Schiavo (against the protests of the fundamentalist Christian scene around president George W. Bush) indirectly also was affected by this film ""Million Dollar Baby"". But this film has neither the priority ""help-to-die"" nor to describe a female Rocky - in the center is placed the consideration, how one can free oneself from the vulgar usualness, if the beginning of the lifeline only seemed to offer trash.

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[4, 6]","Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank star in this bittersweet story of an ornery old trainer, his trusted reliable friend, and a female boxer trying to make a living on her own.Eastwood owns the gym in which Swank appears, and asks to be trained. Eastwood's famous line, ""I don't train girls!""is uttered several times throughout the first half of the movie, and why should he? He has his own male contender, primed and ready for a shot at the title. But as fortune would have it, his fighter bails on him; his buddy and pal, Freeman, befriends Swank, and thus the story begins.The story flows well, and is directed tremendously by Eastwood. But with all Eastwood films, happiness never lasts long. Turmoil befalls our heroine as a sucker punch and the events which follow change the whole direction of the film. We are no longer subjected to watching a female ""Rocky"" film, but thrust into the likes of a ""Terms of Endearment"" film.The ending is not conventional, and it will leave empty and hallow inside as the credits roll.

633283,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JNP1,Galina,"[1, 8]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***""Million Dollar Baby"" is a plain and predictable movie which was confidently directed, and has three very good performances. I just cannot believe how many clich&eacute;s it's got - the estranged daughter of Frankie (Eastwood) to whom he writes every week and receives every letter back not opened. This device was used for Freeman's character's narration - in the last scene of the film we realize that he was telling the story to Frankie's daughter to convince her that her father was a good man. The main character, Maggie the waitress (Hillary Swank) eating table scraps and counting pennies, makes a long trip to LA to be trained by Frankie to became a boxing champion - why is she so determined to have him as her trainer we'll never know. Her conversation with Frankie when she remembers her father and her dog, Axel that was put asleep when became sick - kind of lets you know what to expect in the end. The ominous descriptions of a German champion Billy the Blue Bear, ""the dirtiest killing machine"" - you know what will happen way before the movie takes it turn. It should've ended just after the turn with Maggie's death - the final round of the movie is despicable in its manipulation. It is hard for me to believe that Maggie practically fall apart from the lack of the proper care - it was shown that way to squeeze as many tears from the audience as possible. What it squeezed from me was anger and burning desire to hiss ""Die already!!!"" It is also quite predictable that all members of Maggie's family are the crude caricatures. By the way, her sister does not look like a redneck girl who keeps having babies and cheats on Welfare but this is a small detail. Final heartbreaking scene between Maggie and Frankie - in her last moment he told her what Gaelic phrase 'Mo cos&uacute;lacht' means and of course, it should make the audiences cry even harder. But if you think of it, Maggie had the robe with the sign for months, her many Irish fans kept greeting her with this phrase all the time - and she never was curious enough to find out (through the dictionary or just by asking any of her fans) what it meant. Again, it is a small detail but I hate to be manipulated by the cheap tricks and the movie has lots of them. Oh, I almost forgot the mentally retarded boy in the Frankie's Gym whose only purpose to be in the gym and in the movie was to provide a triumphant moment for Freeman's Scrap and the comical relief exactly in the right time.You know, when I think of it, I hate the whole idea of women boxing - I find it unnatural, cruel, and absolutely unsympathetic (but it is me). If Maggie was able to safe a few pennies to get to that Gym, if she was so subtle, strong willed and determined to change her life, to pull herself out of the trailer park, to become somebody, to not be called ""white trash"", why did not she go to school - to better herself, to receive education. She was smart enough to know where she came from and to want to get out of there, so, why choose the way she chose? But I guess, the movie was not supposed to answer this question.I believe that Eastwood is an incredible artist at almost 78 - with sure hand, great style, and sharp mind. I loved the music he wrote for the movie, I liked his acting (as well as Swank's and Freeman's) but for me, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was not the Best film of the year, not even close.",3,My handkerchief stayed dry,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3413,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'plain', 'predictable', 'movie', 'was', 'confidently', 'directed', 'three', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'got', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Frankie', 'Eastwood', 'whom', 'week', 'letter', 'back', 'not', 'opened', 'device', 'was', 'used', 'Freeman', 'character', 'narration', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'realize', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'Frankie', 'daughter', 'convince', 'father', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'main', 'character', 'Maggie', 'waitress', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'eating', 'table', 'scraps', 'counting', 'pennies', 'long', 'trip', 'LA', 'be', 'trained', 'Frankie', 'became', 'boxing', 'champion', 'why', 'so', 'determined', 'have', 'trainer', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'conversation', 'Frankie', 'when', 'father', 'dog', 'Axel', 'was', 'put', 'asleep', 'when', 'became', 'sick', 'kind', 'lets', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'end', 'ominous', 'descriptions', 'German', 'champion', 'Billy', 'Blue', 'Bear', 'dirtiest', 'killing', 'machine', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'way', 'movie', 'turn', 'should', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'just', 'turn', 'Maggie', 'death', 'final', 'round', 'movie', 'despicable', 'manipulation', 'hard', 'believe', 'Maggie', 'practically', 'fall', 'apart', 'lack', 'proper', 'care', 'was', 'shown', 'way', 'squeeze', 'many', 'tears', 'audience', 'possible', 'What', 'squeezed', 'was', 'anger', 'burning', 'desire', 'hiss', 'Die', 'already', 'also', 'quite', 'predictable', 'members', 'Maggie', 'family', 'are', 'crude', 'caricatures', 'way', 'sister', 'not', 'look', 'redneck', 'girl', 'who', 'having', 'babies', 'cheats', 'Welfare', 'small', 'detail', 'Final', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'Maggie', 'Frankie', 'last', 'moment', 'told', 'what', 'Gaelic', 'phrase', ""'Mo"", 'cos', 'uacute', 'means', 'course', 'should', 'make', 'audiences', 'cry', 'even', 'harder', 'think', 'Maggie', 'had', 'robe', 'sign', 'months', 'many', 'Irish', 'fans', 'kept', 'greeting', 'phrase', 'time', 'never', 'was', 'curious', 'enough', 'find', 'out', 'dictionary', 'just', 'asking', 'fans', 'what', 'meant', 'Again', 'small', 'detail', 'hate', 'be', 'manipulated', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'movie', 'lots', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'boy', 'Frankie', 'Gym', 'only', 'purpose', 'be', 'gym', 'movie', 'was', 'provide', 'triumphant', 'moment', 'Freeman', 'Scrap', 'comical', 'relief', 'exactly', 'right', 'time.You', 'know', 'when', 'think', 'hate', 'whole', 'idea', 'women', 'boxing', 'find', 'unnatural', 'cruel', 'absolutely', 'unsympathetic', 'Maggie', 'was', 'able', 'safe', 'few', 'pennies', 'get', 'Gym', 'was', 'so', 'subtle', 'strong', 'willed', 'determined', 'change', 'life', 'pull', 'trailer', 'park', 'become', 'somebody', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'white', 'trash', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'school', 'better', 'receive', 'education', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'where', 'came', 'want', 'get', 'so', 'why', 'choose', 'way', 'chose', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'answer', 'question.I', 'believe', 'Eastwood', 'incredible', 'artist', 'almost', '78', 'sure', 'hand', 'great', 'style', 'sharp', 'mind', 'loved', 'music', 'wrote', 'movie', 'liked', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'Swank', 'Freeman', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'was', 'not', 'Best', 'film', 'year', 'not', 'even', 'close']",N/A

By now everyone knows the story (or at least the first two thirds of the story) and while 'yet another film about boxing' may have kept some viewers away from this movie originally, the recent controversy about the last third of the film's message should certainly breakdown the resistance of the remaining population.  This is a film that should almost be required viewing - on many levels.Clint Eastwood deserves all the kudos mounting around his direction and acting and courage to put this compilation of stories by FX Toole as written for the screen by Paul Haggis on celluloid.  Eastwood's ""look"" (color made to seem almost black and white by his choices of strong light and shadow throughout) fits this microcosm of the down and out in the dregs of Los Angeles gyms and allows the redemptive powers of the individual soul to gleam.As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is an old has been boxing trainer who lives a quiet life in his rundown gym writing to his long lost daughter (his letters are always returned unopened), attending mass trying to make sense of an irrational universe, and supporting young wannabe boxers, afraid to take them to the 'big fight'.  He is aided by an old one-eyed boxer custodian, his longtime friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman). Into this milieu steps Maggie (Hilary Swank), a trailer park trash 31 year old waitress who has placed all her dreams of rising out of her status by having Frankie train her to be a prize fighting boxer.  Frankie refuses, Maggie is quietly persistent, and Scrap is supportive,  until events occur that result in his taking Maggie on as a  boxer.From that point Maggie and Frankie and Scrap form a warm trio of hope and work and Maggie slowly and surprisingly quickly is readied for a big fight.  The outcome of that fight changes all the characters, but those changes, as devastating as they are, open doors of redemption.

Now I'm not sure it hits every point on the believablity scale, but once you accept that a girl this beautiful is still single at 33 and only making just enough to survive at a waitressing job eating scraps that customers leave.. and that on top of all that she wants to become the next Mohammed Ali of women and actually has what it takes to do just that (almost)..... well, once you accept that, you're in for a beautiful ride. Hillary Swank is gorgeous and in spite of all the above mentioned improbabilities, puts in a fantastic performance as Maggie.  Hollywood be damned, she'll win your heart in spite of it all.  And Clint, well, of course his performance is fantastic as usual. Likewise for Morgan Freeman.  If the point of a movie is to get the audience involved on as many levels as possible, entertaining you through and through in the process, then this movie succeeds admirably.  Much more than a female version of Rocky the film tackles some hard issues towards the end.  Always great to see Clint in action and this film is no exception.

We knew of the emotional side of the movie and prepared to protect ourselves from getting caught.

In the end though all fighters do get stung and feel the leather. As prepared as one can be, the last 45 minutes of this movie are deeply moving, climaxing with the aforementioned knockout punch of emotional scenes.Clint Eastwood directs a passionate movie narrated exceptionally by Morgan Freeman. Both Eastwood and Freeman deliver authentic performances worthy of accolades. Their on-screen chemistry is smooth and a delight to watch. Hillary Swank delivers the role of her already young heralded career. As Maggie Fitzgerald, she brings out the fire and passion trapped within Frankie (Eastwood).The movie's boxing scenes were choreographed very well. Utilizing former fighter Lucia Rijker as the antagonist Billie ""Blue Bear"" was a critical decision. As Swank's trainer, she and Swank's fight was quite believable even for Hollywood standards.More than just a boxing movie, Million Dollar Baby speaks volumes on rekindling love once thought lost or deferred.

It is reminscent of The Decalogue, a series of films directed by Krystof Kieslowski about the 10 Commandments. It addresses the moral questions (along with the moral ambiguity) that we may all have to face. It doesn't do it in a condescending, Hollywoodesque way. It does it in an adult way. The film stayed with me for days afterwards. I have watched several Eastwood directed films since seeing this one, and I think Clint is sorely underrappreciated as a filmmaker. He has directed 26 films (his latest, Flag of Our Fathers, is due out in 2006).  He isn't an actor (like Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson) who occasionally steps behind a camera.  He's a real, legitimate filmmaker, and he displays a sensitivity and subtlety that are so rare in Hollywood these days, reminiscent of old Hollywood masters like John Ford.  He is a true artist, a great filmmaker that should be spoken about alongside the greats.  And his artistry comes through this film in every frame.  Only a true artist with the depth and substance of Eastwood could have made this heartbreaking, thought provoking film.  ADDENUM...Check out the Producer's 15 segment on the DVD.  Tom Rosenberg, one of the producers of this film, makes some hilariously pointed comments about directors.  He compares how inefficient and pretentious other directors are compared to Clint, who is arguably one of the most workmanlike, unpretentious, and excellent filmmakers in Hollywood today.",5,"5 stars isn't enough for this majestic, moving, heartbreaking film....one of the best films I've seen in the last 15 years",1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,1499,"['film', 'masterpiece', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'reminscent', 'Decalogue', 'series', 'films', 'directed', 'Krystof', 'Kieslowski', '10', 'Commandments', 'moral', 'questions', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'may', 'have', 'face', ""n't"", 'do', 'condescending', 'Hollywoodesque', 'way', 'adult', 'way', 'film', 'stayed', 'days', 'afterwards', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'films', 'seeing', 'one', 'think', 'Clint', 'sorely', 'underrappreciated', 'filmmaker', 'directed', '26', 'films', 'latest', 'Flag', 'Fathers', 'due', 'out', '2006', ""n't"", 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'occasionally', 'steps', 'camera', 'real', 'legitimate', 'filmmaker', 'sensitivity', 'subtlety', 'are', 'so', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'masters', 'John', 'Ford', 'true', 'artist', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'be', 'spoken', 'greats', 'artistry', 'film', 'frame', 'Only', 'true', 'artist', 'depth', 'substance', 'Eastwood', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'heartbreaking', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'ADDENUM', 'Check', 'Producer', '15', 'segment', 'DVD', 'Tom', 'Rosenberg', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'hilariously', 'pointed', 'comments', 'directors', 'how', 'inefficient', 'pretentious', 'other', 'directors', 'are', 'compared', 'Clint', 'who', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'workmanlike', 'unpretentious', 'excellent', 'filmmakers', 'Hollywood', 'today']",N/A

Hilary Swank has definitely evolved from her early days in the business (anyone remember The Next Karate Kid). Clint Eastwood just proves how good of an actor he is, and how good a director he can be. I know many people doubted Clint Eastwood as a director, but he definitely proves everyone wrong. Morgan Freeman, again, gives such a great performance, he is probably one of the best actors in history.The fight scenes are simply amazing, if you've seen Ali, many of the camera movements look like Ali's just updated a little bit. This movie has humor and a lot of drama, but good drama. Morgan Freeman knocking out one of the younger fighters was hilarious. But the movie really doesn't get funny when we see the last fight and fighter she is fighting, Billie The Blue Bear, knocks Maggie down head first into the stool. From that point, i can't blame a person for crying because the acting from the scenes where Maggie Fritzgerald is in the hospital look so real and are so good. Maggie's parents, people watching the film, probably want to shoot them.Overall, i haven't seen a boxing movie this good since Rocky 1. Million Dollar Baby is a movie that will remain a true classic, and we don't see many films anymore that is good through out the whole 100% of the movie, this movie will make you laugh and it will you cry. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it now, believe me, don't waste your money on just renting it for 3 or 5 days, this you will want to keep.The DVD extras, are alright, probably not what we were expecting out of such good movie, i would of really liked commentary as an extra, because i always find it cool that we can hear the actors or the directors talk about the movie while you are watching it.

This movie isn't all about boxing but I must admit it made me want to get myself engaged in it. I know I'll be ""Danger"" but it's all good intentions here.I didn't know what quite to expect from this film.I must say there were times in this movie when all I could is punch my fist in the air with the kind of raise in moods it gave me.Also there were a few scenes that made me gulp.The subtely with which the characters are introduced is pretty good.It explores two different realms in life.You really want to believe everything Morgan Freeman says.He's more than a good man.Hollywood can try but can not find a man better than him to replace the character he played. The scene in which he knocks out a kid half his age did just what a prozac would do to a man experiencing middle aged crisis.It was his 110th.Hilary Swank has this look of a fighter in her each time she approaced all fights.

633303,AVO9QQWRRXESK,B00005JNP1,Heather Hays,"[12, 31]","I have to wonder what Clint Eastwood was thinking when he made this movie. Who was his target audience?This movie is about a woman boxer called Maggie May. She has had a tough life. Her brother is in jail and her trailer trash mother weighs three hundred pounds and cheats the welfare system by claiming that her dead baby is still alive. To add to the insult, she has just turned 32 years old, which is too old to really become a boxer apparently.But of course boxing is her only joy. So she hangs around Clint Eastwood's gym and pesters him until he agrees to train her. From there her career takes off. Her upward climb is interrupted as the movie spirals into tragic lows.Somewhere in the middle, I admit that I was hooked and interested in where the film was headed. But it dragged on way past the point where it wore out its welcome and became dull, apathetic and depressing.Towards the end, things got so bad, in such a perfect string of events, that I almost started laughing. It was like whoever wrote this script was on a mad quest to top himself. I would have gotten up and walked out if I had a ride home.So I didn't 'get' this movie at all, I wasn't inspired, I didn't want to cry. In fact, all I remember feeling is a deep feeling of disgust.I agree with the reviewer that said her family was ridiculous.Just because a movie is depressing doesn't mean it is profound, or good.Moral of this movie: Don't become a boxer.

633305,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,B00005JNP1,here_is_your_review,"[3, 5]","This is the first performance by Hilary Swank I've seen (though she already has many credits in her career).  As the Million Dollar Baby, she wins us over with her determination, spirit and courage.  If she doesn't touch your spirit, you might want to check your heart to see if it is still intact.  Absolutely an Oscar-winning performance by Swank.Morgan Freeman's narrative is given in the classic telling of an old tale and never overshadowed the film.  In an understated performance, Freeman played a powerful, almost incidental character in the story.  Yet he is the ""glue"" that holds the entire story together; if it weren't for his character, there would be no story.With Eastwood, at first it was a little hard for me to accept him as a gruff boxing trainer because of other performances of his I've seen.  But about 1/3 of the way through the film, you forget all that and once again, Clint takes a commanding presence.For these three, life has dealt them some seriously difficult obstacles.  But from their personal disappointments, many of them still occurring, they gather the strength to work together, albeit with conflict, to achieve a fleeting dream.Stong supporting cast of misfits who provide a perfect backdrop.  ""Danger"" is a goofball, socially inept and uncoordinated.  He pays a price for his ineptness, yet by the end of the film, he's fought back with just a tiny glimpse of the spirit we see in the Million Dollar Baby.  In his own way, he becomes a personal champion.  And the stereotypical slimy boxing promoters are here too, but played discreetly, more like real life.  In ""Rocky V"" we saw a Don King-type promoter, flamboyant and loud, but these are just low-key, two-bit, fast-buck promoters, who smile and steal other's dreams.  Once in awhile one of their deals pays off, and that happens here, but it's after another's hard work.Also strong supporting performances by the Million Dollar Baby's dysfunctional family.  I didn't like them from the moment I met them and that continued all the way to the finish.  Then I had to remember, as actors, that's what they were hired to do.  And boy did they deliver.  The final scene with them is a pivotal point in our hero's life.  Pay close attention; it does not disappoint.With regards to the ending it is complex, controversial and disturbing.  I cannot lie to you.  Because of the content and some language, this film is not suitable for children, imho.  There's a double metaphor for Clint Eastwood's character at the end, as he comes to accept two different, yet metaphorically similar, realities.  And both are painful.Simply the best movie I've seen all year and perhaps recent memory.  No, it's not the ""feel good movie"" but sometimes we can learn from films like this.  5 out of 5 stars for performances.",5,"Gripping Performances by Eastwood, Freeman and Swank",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2791,"['first', 'performance', 'Hilary', 'Swank', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'many', 'credits', 'career', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'determination', 'spirit', 'courage', ""n't"", 'touch', 'spirit', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'heart', 'see', 'still', 'intact', 'Absolutely', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Swank.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narrative', 'given', 'classic', 'telling', 'old', 'tale', 'never', 'overshadowed', 'film', 'understated', 'performance', 'Freeman', 'played', 'powerful', 'almost', 'incidental', 'character', 'story', 'glue', 'entire', 'story', 'together', 'were', ""n't"", 'character', 'would', 'be', 'story.With', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'accept', 'gruff', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'other', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1/3', 'way', 'film', 'forget', 'once', 'again', 'Clint', 'commanding', 'presence.For', 'three', 'life', 'dealt', 'seriously', 'difficult', 'obstacles', 'personal', 'disappointments', 'many', 'still', 'occurring', 'gather', 'strength', 'work', 'together', 'conflict', 'achieve', 'fleeting', 'dream.Stong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'misfits', 'who', 'provide', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'Danger', 'goofball', 'socially', 'inept', 'uncoordinated', 'price', 'ineptness', 'yet', 'end', 'film', 'fought', 'back', 'just', 'tiny', 'glimpse', 'spirit', 'see', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'own', 'way', 'personal', 'champion', 'stereotypical', 'slimy', 'boxing', 'promoters', 'are', 'here', 'too', 'played', 'discreetly', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'Rocky', 'V', 'saw', 'Don', 'King-type', 'promoter', 'flamboyant', 'loud', 'are', 'just', 'low-key', 'two-bit', 'fast-buck', 'promoters', 'who', 'smile', 'steal', 'other', 'dreams', 'Once', 'awhile', 'one', 'deals', 'here', 'hard', 'work.Also', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'moment', 'met', 'continued', 'way', 'finish', 'Then', 'had', 'remember', 'actors', 'what', 'were', 'hired', 'do', 'boy', 'did', 'deliver', 'final', 'scene', 'pivotal', 'point', 'hero', 'life', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'not', 'disappoint.With', 'regards', 'ending', 'complex', 'controversial', 'disturbing', 'can', 'not', 'lie', 'content', 'language', 'film', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'imho', 'double', 'metaphor', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'end', 'accept', 'two', 'different', 'yet', 'metaphorically', 'similar', 'realities', 'are', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'perhaps', 'recent', 'memory', 'No', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'can', 'learn', 'films', '5', '5', 'stars', 'performances']",N/A

Toole, is about as close to perfect as a movie gets in spite of its being about boxing and therefore extremely violent. Director/actor Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn), Hilary Swank (Maggie Fitzgerald) and Morgan Freeman (Eddie Dupris) give flawless performances. Freeman is cast here as a down but not out exboxer, the seasoned sage, a part he always does well. Eastwood as the tough, aging boxing coach with lots of psychic baggage, is more emotional and human here than in any role I remember. Swank, however, is incomparable. Apparently there is no part too difficult for her. Here she is the poorest of the poor, a waitress who takes leftover food home-- a fighter in every sense of the word-- who gets the first chance ever to be somebody as a boxer.The film would have been perfect if Maggie's family had been a little more human rather than cardboard versions of redneck white trash and Frankie's Catholic priest could have left the safety of his parish if only briefly to walk in Frankie's shoes. There probably are trailer park types and priests who are this inflexible, but a little more tolerance of them on the director's part would have made for a better movie.The film's ending raises serious ethical questions and makes a profound statement about the redemptive power of love, wherever you find it, and what makes up a family.

The movie is a masterpiece, as good as Unforgiven, probably even better. These 2 movies are my favorite Clint Eastwood movies. Like Unforgiven, you should want to watch this movie let alone for the excellent reviews and 4 oscars!The movie is very unique in its own because it will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and boo. Now, that's something to see. Also, the acting in the movie is brilliant. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, 2 of the best actors of all time shine in this one. Hilary Swank also gives a remarquable performance as does the rest of the cast.The movie is about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a woman boxer who finally convinces Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer. Frankie is a sad man who owns a gym and is a boxing trainer and manager. He goes to church very often as he misses his daughter. You pity him because his daughter won't talk to him and returns all of his letters unread. He is a sad man. All he has is his gym and his friend Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). That's until he trains Maggie. Maggie becomes one hell of a fighter and knocks out most of her opponents in the first round (in a rather comical way). Maggie is to Frankie, his daughter that he never had. It helps him to forget about his daughter who is hurting him and now he has a good friend and a daughter figure. The movie develops at a great pace and is always exciting. But, the end is very sad and tragic and is unlike other PG-13 movies. If you would have to see one PG-13 movie out of all of them, definitely make it this one. This is now on my wish list to buy and is a beautiful masterpiece. It's a movie that everyone will cherish and love. Everything in the movie is perfect besides one thing. The F word is used once... Guess by who... A preacher/ pastor!!!!!!!!! Thats kind of strange..

It's a story about living life to the fullest by knowing what you want and shooting for it. It's also a story about souls lost and souls found everyday. It's absolutely remarkable.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a poor Southern girl with only one dream: to become the world's lightweight boxing champion. She grew up in a pitiful family where role models where things she read about in books. She was brought up by parents that never believed in her. Even her siblings didn't believe in her. And even when she met Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), he didn't believe in her.

Clint is too regal for this type of blue-collar, gritty role, and a smiling, cute, clean-cut swank is too attractive and smart (and smart-looking) for her role as well.The film was slow at times, and seemed more like a TBS family movie than the ""A"" film it was trying to be.  I realize that few films are made today with the notion of craftsmanship as opposed to special effects, so as intelligent moviegoers we need to appreciate each one that comes along, BUT, this film tried too hard to be an emotionally gripping tear-jerker (can you say ""house of sand and fog""?).  It seemed to throw every cliche at the viewer, as if begging the audience to cry and mourn.  The hard-working waitress who keeps her chin up no matter what, the miserable, un-appreciative family, etc. I just didnt buy it.[As for freeman, i stopped watching the oscars because of his '89 driving ms daisy performance which didnt win an award.

The strength of the film holds in one single fact: anyone can always win one battle provided they are trained properly and they are managed properly. That does not mean they will win the world title but they can always try and win one victory. How far will they go, no one knows, no one can tell. Luckily, otherwise there would be no meaning in trying. But the cruelty is all contained too in one fact: the end of such a fight for the top title is lost sooner or later if the contender does not learn how to cheat with life and the rules or to be aware the other one may cheat with life and the rules and this contender must be ready to resist these attempts. And that's just what the ""boss"" forgot to teach his fighter. And she was the victim of the viciousness of the champion who did something wrong for the third time causing severe damage and eventually death. If you just concentrate on these two elements this film is a masterpiece that deserves all the prizes it got. If you want to go slightly farther and sort out other elements like the heavy reference to God and religion, you will fall into something very trite, like the priest advising the ""boss"" not to meddle with the fallen fighter's desire to die because then he, the boss, would not be able to come to terms with himself. This answer is so narrow-minded, so egotistic in the name of God. I respect the divine command not because I respect or fear God, but because my disobeying this command may make me unhappy. On these sides issues and questions Clint Eastwood is definitely less clear. But the cruelty of this boxing against all people involved in the business is mastered in an admirable way.

633315,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B00005JNP1,James Carragher,"[4, 9]","Let's make it clear up front -- there is no working director/actor more in command of his art than Clint Eastwood.  He proves it again with Million Dollar Baby, whose plot line is well-known enough to not need repeating here.With each scene, Eastwood moves his story forward.  Nothing feels forced or faked up for greater emotional intensity.  Even the controversial twist, a melodramatic moment if there ever was one, is not overdone, although in its use of slow-mo it recalls a key scene in In the Line of Fire where, of course, Eastwood acted but did not direct.The boxing action is tough and authentic; every character, with the slight exception of Maggie's obnoxious family, lives as an individual, not a cliche.  Eastwood has this old-fashioned idea that if you have a story, characters with ideas, and, yes, values, you don't need glitz, noise or other attention-grabbing filler.  As with Mystic River, check out the color that Eastwood uses to set each scene and the overall mood of the film.  Also as with Mystic River, the characters grapple with everyman's eternal issues, loyalty, love, friendship, loss, guilt, and a search for meaning against the terrifying suspicion that it may not exist.On that controversial twist: the criticism being rained on Eastwood from various quarters is completely unwarranted.  As he himself has said in interviews, he is not making a generalized statement of a position; he is showing how one person struggles with and resolves a terrible situation.  It's an individual's choice in a story; it's not a paradigm or meant to advocate.Haven't mentioned the acting, but we're talking Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint himself.  As they used to say in Marvel Comics, 'nuff said.I do have two nitpicks -- Maggie won her fight since her opponent would certainly have been DQ'ed for her action and Morgan Freeman's voiceover narration is used too frequently, especially early on.  Actually, I have a third too, but that would give away a key plot element more than I already have.Million Dollar Baby, though I slightly prefer the somber power of Mystic River, is simply superb.  If it loses the Academy Award for Best Picture to a bio pic -- however, well done -- about a boring billionaire, there is no justice.

What sets Maggie apart is described as her ""heart"" or her eagerness to win and inability to step down.Directed and also starring Clint Eastwood, he plays boxing coach Frankie Dunn, who at first vows to never teach Maggie (due to the fact she is a girl) but then caves upon the pressure of her persistence.This also has Morgan Freeman in the supporting role as Eddie Dupris who is Frankie's best friend and right-hand man in everything.  He also narrates the movie.These three actors have fantastic chemistry.  They worked well together and hope that many academy awards (next week) are awarded to them for what they have pulled together.  They didn't go for cheap laughs and high costing special effects and this turned out to be a fantastic movie.Fantastic... until the end.  The problem with the this movie is that the main character, Maggie, goes against her nature.  In the end, she turns out to be a quitter.Also, it is hard to believe that a movie could be made like this after what happened to Christopher Reeves and his overwhelming determination.So, if you love fantastic acting then you've got to check out this movie.

The story ends with quite a few things left unexplained.  In Rocky, you actually wanted him to win and you found yourself pulling for him all the way.  This story really never truly gives you that feeling.  I have talked to co-workers who have seen this movie and they feel the same way.  If you want a good, root for the underdog movie, stick with Rocky.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[7, 10]","The movie begins powerfuly, showing in development, characters that in the end, you will cry for, mourning painfully as you would for someone whom you truely care for.So ironic Clint is, a man known for his violence, but alas in the autumn of his life he has viewed violence in the horrific consequences that they come with. As in mystic river or Unforgiven, and lastly, and more importantly Million dollar baby. Hilary Swank was bred for this role, calling on her youth experiences in interviews, but like her character, who was driven and all heart, needed temperance from a wiser sort: Clint Eastwood. Eastwood seems to have the unflagging spirit that is throbbing in his films, when you think he is down and out of his career and you think it is over for him, he comes back anew!It gives me hope, watching films like this, a rekindling of past flames for film, that honestly, has died down, but every now and then is stoked by fine surprises! In an age where the latest trend is what was last best to sell, it is refreshing to see someone so romantic of times now past. Eastwood is a zeitgeist for his time, where movies were original and always changing, compelling viewers to go to the cinema and experience something creative. Not re-hashes and countless sequels! All of these things can be said of Million dollar baby, which I adore.Don't look to find politics in this beautifully poignant film, where, if you have the ill will, could fine. Instead, rather appreciate the story, because lets face it, Clint is not political in this film. Meaning he does not draw you to one side of a battle of controversy, or to the other. It is a movie you will not find in the documentary section, it is a piece of work, meant to be expressive emotionally.

Fortunately, the 10th Anniversary has a new lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track.The original blu-ray was also a bit short on special features.

Generally, I go along with some of them, and personally I regret not being able to give the big five to my man Clint, et al.But to those of us who really know how pulling the plug works, there were some gaping holes in the screenplay. Today, all hospitals have end-of-life boards, usually the combination of a physician, social worker and medical ethicist, and sometimes even a cleric, who by the regs (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals) respond to patients in terminal situations, assisting them in decisions to terminate care at such critical junctures as those met by Maggie. I have participated in some of these instances, and am embarrassed that the writers would not have known.Neither does the film do justice to the incredible advances of recent years in therapy for spinal cord injuries, and to the alternatives which would have been available to Maggie. This film should have had a medical consultant available to the writers and producers.I can understand that the film already was long enough, so that this benign process could not be interjected. But without it, the film inferred moral approval of what Boss did for Maggie, justifying it for the sake of love. Here, some ambiguity was left dangling, making it unclear if the moral of the story was of Boss's love for Maggie, or an approval of euthanasia, motivated by Boss's guilt over his lost relationship with his daughter.As screen minutes go, some of the time lost on maudlin could have been used to a deepening of their love for each other. If she had to die, the mental and emotional process could then have been made into a real commitment between them. At that, as Boss simply disappears after his act, we don't get to know how he worked out his own salvation. It is inferred he went back to the restaurant with the great lemon meringue pie.Considering Hollywood's leftist politics, if those folks insist upon charging us good money to receive the industry's radical views, then the producers should be required to give all facets of such important moral issues as euthanasia. This film, unfortunately, is just one more example of the triumph of emotion over reason, and the aversion of intellectual examination of the issues. Well, you may argue this is art. But this is only one panel in a mural which ultimately must extend beyond emotion.In the end, we get a euthanised girl and a killer on the run.

I am fully convinced that Clint Eastwood is becoming a better filmmaker with each passing year.Million Dollar Baby is a movie about Frankie (Eastwood), a grizzled old ""cut-man"" who owns a boxing gym.  He is the type of man who was old school when the old school was new school.  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a woman who wants Frankie to train her as a boxer, but being old school, Frankie won't.  She's paid her dues at the gym for the next six months, so he'll let her stay, but he's not going to train her.But because there won't be much of a movie if he doesn't, he does decide to train her.  Maggie is all guts and determination and she really doesn't have anything else going for her in her life.  Her family would be the definition of white trash, and Maggie is only one small but important step away from that.  She has desire to be more.To say more would really spoil the feel of this movie.  Routinely funny and moving, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a nearly perfect movie.  Wherever you think the movie is going to go, it doesn't go there.  ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a movie about boxing, it is a movie about a boxer.  There is a significant difference and the difference is likely what makes this movie so good.Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, and Clint Eastwood all turn in what may be the best work of their career and that is saying something.  Everyone feels absolutely perfect as their characters and Swank in particular does a fantastic job in becoming Maggie Fitzgerald.  It doesn't feel like Swank is playing a role, it feels like she is Maggie.  The other women who Swank boxes against do a great job making Swank look like the real deal, so the praise really goes to everybody in the movie.There are difficult decisions made in this movie and each one falls in line with what the characters might actually do.

633339,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00005JNP1,Jonathan Appleseed,"[332, 387]","Hillary Swank (Margaret Fitzgerald), who proved her athleticism in her first major role, The Next Karate Kid, demonstrated it again, pummeling a heavy bag with a power left on which I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end. She's very convincing in this movie - both as a young woman from humble beginnings who wants to make a better life for herself, and as a boxer. In Million Dollar Baby, she returns to the visceral emotional range that left us so deeply moved in Boy's Don't Cry.Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn), who has proved himself repeatedly, has perhaps turned in the best performance of his career. At times irascible, intellectual, mournful, instructive, reflective, passionate - in every manifestation, he reaches you. He was brilliant.And Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. As the narrator of the story, and an actor within it, he lends a soft-spoken touch that ameliorates some of the film's darker elements. He also lent the film a certain amount of boxing sagacity, as he spoke in non-technical and sometimes quasi-technical terms of the basics of boxing.This film ain't no Rocky. It has an intelligence and compassion that Rocky (and virtually every boxing film ever made, save perhaps Raging Bull) couldn't think to have. Beyond that, it actually has better fight sequences. More often than in most boxing films - certainly the very poor choreography of the Rocky fight sequences - the punches looked and felt real, or as real as ""fake"" can make them.Margaret introduces herself to Frankie after a fight and asks him to train her. He turns her down flat, saying that he doesn't train girls. Given her pluckiness, she appears at his gym the next day, punching a heavy bag with all of the skill, style and fluidity of Pinocchio. Finally he agrees to train her (""finally"" takes a while, and watching it come to fruition, the subtle changes in Eastwood's character, is a real treat to watch), and soon she is ready for her first fight.Here's the only similarity to Rocky: she turns out to be a natural, with a wicked left hook and overhand right (at least that I could see) and is knocking out all of her opponents in the first round. Some might think that this is, perhaps, a bit much. However, in the sport of women's boxing, such a thing isn't uncommon. PLEASE don't think that I'm saying women are not good boxers or don't have the same abilities that men do. It's simply that the increasing popularity of the sport hasn't quite yet led to the kind of talent that exists in men's boxing (although, frankly, talent on that side isn't exactly at it's apex). Her superiority over lesser opponents isn't unheard of.There's so much more I want to say about this film, because from this point forward it moved from being one of the best films of the year - purely on the strength of the writing, and the performances of Swank and Eastwood in particular - to one of the best films I've seen in several years. I'm so grateful that reviewers didn't give away the ending. I'll just say that the ending is layered with surprises, and that it's been a very, very long time that I haven't seen a single cell phone being used (how annoying is that, even with all of the polite requests and warnings?), and also seen so many in the theater remain in their seats long after the movie ended.It's a brilliant, brilliant film, the kind that makes me want to go back and change the number of stars I've given most movies that I've reviewed, simply so that this 5 star review means more.

633342,A28LG2MEWGLKZW,B00005JNP1,Jonathan S. Kemp,"[3, 6]","Clint Eastwood is only getting better with age.  Thirteen years ago, he won Best Picture and Best Director for ""Unforgiven"", the last great western of the 20th century.  In 2003, he directed ""Mystic River"", another Oscar winner, and after his latest movie, ""Million Dollar Baby"", he's pretty much guaranteed another impressive showing at the Academy Awards in February.  ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a well-tuned drama that perfectly reflects Eastwood's grizzled experience in film.  It's some of the best work he's ever done.""Million Dollar Baby's"" strengths don't lie in any sort of complex, confusing plot; indeed, Eastwood's storytelling is pithy and lean.  When  introduced to the female protagonist of the film, a woman from Missouri named Maggie, I got a sense of her lonely life as a waitress, and I pitied her slightly, a feeling which made me like her right away-and a feeling that would be crucial for later scenes to deliver the emotional impact they did.  A younger Eastwood may have been unsure that the audience would regard his characters as he does.  The tension of the film stems from the delicate emotion of each character, and it would have been easy and cloying for Maggie to appear overly hopeless and desperate in an effort to get the viewer to feel really sorry for her.  But Eastwood carries each scene with a confident hand, exposing and hiding just enough about each character so that it rarely felt sentimental.The character Eastwood plays, Frankie, a septuagenarian gym owner and boxing trainer, is reluctant to take on the newest member to his gym, Maggie, because she's a woman.  At first, I wasn't sure why he was all that reluctant to help her out, but, at the right moment, I learned that Frankie had had a rough falling out with his daughter and hadn't spoken to her in years.  He hesitated in helping Maggie because he didn't want to fail another young girl, showing he was much more than a post-Rocky boxing clich&eacute;.The drama of ""Million Dollar Baby"" works so well because I understood the actions and motives of each character.  Like in ""Mystic River"", I was given a full, coherent picture of every person in every scene, told of their aspirations and uncertainties.  When Frankie became Maggie's boss and decided to train her after much deliberation, I believed his reasons for changing his mind, and I believed in his character as he became something of a fatherly figure to Maggie, taking her out for lunch, traveling to meet her family, and encouraging her to save winnings from the fights.Eastwood's performance as Frankie is steady and consistent.  The emotional impact of the movie rested on the relationship between Frankie and Maggie, and Eastwood and Swank have great chemistry; Maggie's optimism clashed well with Frankie's pragmatism, and the mixture of their mentalities made them quite likable.While ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the most focused films Eastwood has ever done, he falters when Maggie's hillbilly family is brought into the picture.  It's the flaw of the story that doesn't lead to much; I didn't like or dislike Maggie or Frankie anymore for how they handled Maggie's avaricious mother and sister.  But it's a minor flaw, and one that doesn't suck up much of the film's effect.""Million Dollar Baby"" is a stellar drama, probably even better than ""Mystic River"".  It sets aside the clich&eacute;s of boxing glory and violence, instead highlighting the repercussions of such things, and it does so eloquently.",4,Eastwood at his best--an excellent drama,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,3478,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'age', 'Thirteen', 'years', 'ago', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Unforgiven', 'last', 'great', 'western', '20th', 'century', '2003', 'directed', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'latest', 'movie', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'impressive', 'showing', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'February', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'well-tuned', 'drama', 'perfectly', 'Eastwood', 'grizzled', 'experience', 'film', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'done', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'strengths', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'sort', 'complex', 'confusing', 'plot', 'indeed', 'Eastwood', 'storytelling', 'pithy', 'lean', 'When', 'introduced', 'female', 'protagonist', 'film', 'woman', 'Missouri', 'named', 'Maggie', 'got', 'sense', 'lonely', 'life', 'waitress', 'pitied', 'slightly', 'feeling', 'made', 'right', 'away-and', 'feeling', 'would', 'be', 'crucial', 'later', 'scenes', 'deliver', 'emotional', 'impact', 'did', 'A', 'younger', 'Eastwood', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unsure', 'audience', 'would', 'regard', 'characters', 'tension', 'film', 'delicate', 'emotion', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'cloying', 'Maggie', 'appear', 'overly', 'hopeless', 'desperate', 'effort', 'get', 'viewer', 'feel', 'really', 'sorry', 'Eastwood', 'scene', 'confident', 'hand', 'exposing', 'hiding', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'rarely', 'felt', 'sentimental.The', 'character', 'Eastwood', 'plays', 'Frankie', 'septuagenarian', 'gym', 'owner', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'reluctant', 'take', 'newest', 'member', 'gym', 'Maggie', 'woman', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'reluctant', 'help', 'out', 'right', 'moment', 'learned', 'Frankie', 'had', 'had', 'rough', 'falling', 'out', 'daughter', 'had', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'years', 'hesitated', 'helping', 'Maggie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'fail', 'young', 'girl', 'showing', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'post-Rocky', 'boxing', 'clich', 'eacute', '.The', 'drama', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'so', 'well', 'understood', 'actions', 'motives', 'character', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'given', 'full', 'coherent', 'picture', 'person', 'scene', 'told', 'aspirations', 'uncertainties', 'When', 'Frankie', 'became', 'Maggie', 'boss', 'decided', 'train', 'much', 'deliberation', 'believed', 'reasons', 'changing', 'mind', 'believed', 'character', 'became', 'something', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'Maggie', 'taking', 'out', 'lunch', 'traveling', 'meet', 'family', 'encouraging', 'save', 'winnings', 'fights.Eastwood', 'performance', 'Frankie', 'steady', 'consistent', 'emotional', 'impact', 'movie', 'rested', 'relationship', 'Frankie', 'Maggie', 'Eastwood', 'Swank', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Maggie', 'optimism', 'clashed', 'well', 'Frankie', 'pragmatism', 'mixture', 'mentalities', 'made', 'quite', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'one', 'most', 'focused', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'ever', 'done', 'when', 'Maggie', 'hillbilly', 'family', 'brought', 'picture', 'flaw', 'story', ""n't"", 'lead', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dislike', 'Maggie', 'Frankie', 'anymore', 'how', 'handled', 'Maggie', 'avaricious', 'mother', 'sister', 'minor', 'flaw', 'one', ""n't"", 'suck', 'up', 'much', 'film', 'effect', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'stellar', 'drama', 'probably', 'even', 'better', 'Mystic', 'River', 'aside', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'boxing', 'glory', 'violence', 'instead', 'highlighting', 'repercussions', 'such', 'things', 'so', 'eloquently']",N/A
633343,A207WVVFS9HOVY,B00005JNP1,"jond ""jonutah3""","[6, 14]","This is a good movie, not a great one. Clint shows that he doesn't have a whole lot of range and is pretty much the same character he has played throughout most of his career. Low grumbly voice. Stern overly rough and tumble expressions. Mind you, I am a Clint fan, but I don't think he's a great actor.The thing that really gets me about this movie, however, is how unrealistic it feels. What is the likelyhood that a boxer would be paralized due to a cheap shot in the ring? If Clint were so worried about his fighter, shouldn't he have thrown in the towel after the first couple of cheap shots? Shouldn't he at least jump up and down a bit when his fighter is hurt severely in her eye after a cheap shot (instead of swearing silently to himself)? Would a World Champion really be allowed to continue to cheap shot an opponent over and over like that?

Although much to do with boxing, I dont think this film was about boxing. It's about having a great passion for things, never giving up on what you believe in even when things seem too late. It showed me how certain things can change the way a person thinks for the better and then some of the tough descisions that life can deliver, in realiality not every great story is a happy one.But apart from the fantastic morals that the piece displays, it is structured in a way that will allow everyone to find enjoyment within it. Drivin by some outstanding performances, the film has a warm touch, it can make you laugh and has the ability to make you cry all in the space of two hours.The performances in this film are outstanding, Clint has directed in such a way that has allowed all the true human emotions to flow from his actors especially through Hillary Swank who presents to us almost every emotion humans have it seems.To wrap this up I'd say this is another one of the great pieces for its time and that everyone should see it and also learn from it =) any person who hates this film i could say would be inhuman :P so watch it I couldnt reccomend you a better film in this category Enjoy!",5,Was like a portrait of the human heart,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1364,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'boxing', 'movies', 'different', 'angle', 'things', 'done', 'different', 'way', 'particuler', 'boxing', 'film', 'something', 'else', 'together', 'much', 'do', 'boxing', 'dont', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'boxing', 'having', 'great', 'passion', 'things', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'what', 'believe', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'too', 'late', 'showed', 'how', 'certain', 'things', 'can', 'change', 'way', 'person', 'better', 'then', 'tough', 'descisions', 'life', 'can', 'deliver', 'realiality', 'not', 'great', 'story', 'happy', 'one.But', 'apart', 'fantastic', 'morals', 'piece', 'displays', 'structured', 'way', 'will', 'allow', 'everyone', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'Drivin', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'film', 'warm', 'touch', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'ability', 'make', 'cry', 'space', 'two', 'hours.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Clint', 'directed', 'such', 'way', 'allowed', 'true', 'human', 'emotions', 'flow', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'who', 'almost', 'emotion', 'humans', 'have', 'seems.To', 'wrap', 'up', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'great', 'pieces', 'time', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'also', 'learn', '=', 'person', 'who', 'film', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'inhuman', 'P', 'couldnt', 'reccomend', 'better', 'film', 'category', 'Enjoy']",N/A

But the more positive press the film got and the more clips I saw I was lured into this film. The trailer alone was enough to get me interested but yet not reveal too much of the story. And once the film won numerous Oscars I knew I would have to see this film. Let me tell you, this film lived up to all of the hype and accolades that it received. This has to be the best film of 2004. Clint Eastwood has made yet another tremendous and powerful film. While you may think that the film is just about women's boxing, it is so much more. This film is about the various relationships that develop because of the sport of boxing. It is an excellent film that is well directed by Eastwood and he is able to get excellent performances out of Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and himself. Every nomination this film earned and ever award this film received were deserved, especially Hilary Swank as Best Actress. While I was not a fan of her in ""Boys Don't Cry"" I thought that she acted her butt off in this film. Even in scenes when she doesn't speak she is still able to show so much emotion just with her eyes. Also the fight scenes in this film are well choreographed. They are so realistic that you can almost feel each punch.

It certainly would have spoiled the plot for me. It would not, however, have altered my opinion of it as a movie.I was surprisingly underwhelmed by ""Million Dollar Baby."" Despite its excellent acting, often deft characterization, and technical creativity, I could not root for it for Best Picture.The first two acts are almost distractingly cliche: A crotchety old estranged-father white guy initially refuses to mentor an impoverished wannabe boxer but is persuaded to give her a chance by his subversively kind-hearted black sidekick. The loyal amateur is obsessed with learning and quickly rises to the status of dark horse professional. Her abusive family having ridiculed her and spurned her love, the crusty mentor grudgingly accepts her as a surrogate daughter. After much wizened wrangling by the old white guy, she finally gets her shot at the title.It's at this point that the story completely abandons all convention (on SO many levels). Much like a fighter itself, the movie has used the predictability of the story to set you up for the sucker punch - the last act. Sadly, if you're aware of the political controversy, you will not receive this intended effect. If you are not, I refuse to spoil it for you. My personal experience with the controversial elements and the movie's one-sided approach to them tainted my opinion, but other factors were also at play.While the central trio of characters played by Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman are given depth to spare, the rest of their world is populated by cardboard cutouts and villains that are perfectly engineered straw men that could almost be wearing signs that say ""I'm a plot device."" The minister with no useful answers is de rigueur in Hollywood. But especially egregious are Swank's trailer trash family, who are played so broadly as to veer near comic relief. Had their caricatured edge been blunted, they could have been a chilling depiction of the self-defeating attitudes inherent in poverty. The script shoots for that. As it is, they are just abysmally cruel rednecks.You should see this movie.

Part way into this, I said to myself 'this is ridiculous... could they make it any plainer, and I will bet that they will kill her off to get even more emphasis. Well, all that happened. You have Morgan Freeman narrating it, his voice and Clint's are both gravely - oddly so like they made them even more so. And they both appear to be 80 years old so it's hard to believe they'd still be running a gym - much less punching the bag and the occasional young tuff that gets in the way. Then there is the Opponent in the climatic fight scene, who sneered like she was bad stuff (and was also black - and German - apparently you can't have one without the other if you want to make someone into a real bad stuff). Then, and this is true, just when I thought they had positioned her badly enough, I said to myself ""wait, there is more, I bet she is a criminal or an ex-hooker. A minute later she was introduced as an ex-hooker and later proved to be a criminal when, after losing to the Million Dollar Baby, she sucker-punched her, causing a fall and a permanent breaking of her neck (confined to a bed the entire rest of the film, until she dies).And product placement - unbelievable: at one point Morgan Freeman (the disabled but wise janitor at the gym) is asked by Clint (the owner) why he persists in using one brand of bleach cleaner to clean up with - the scene is shot from behind the bottle which takes up half the screen. The answer ""because it's the best and it smells good"".So we find out Baby was raised dirt poor. They have to rub it in by saying she was a waitress from age 13 and this is her ""last chance"". Well, of course it's her ""last chance"", that's how these films work, although we never do find out why this is all she has going for her (smart, a hard worker, pretty - why?). Then we find out she is from Missouri, so just as I was saying to myself ""I bet she has a hillbilly Mother and family"", all of a sudden there they are. Her Mother is 312 pounds, curses like a sailor because her daughter gave her a house to live in, and of course her teenage pregnant sister with a stereotype (if being pregnant and a minor isn't stereotype enough) trash (and threatening) boyfriend. Well, by now I'm groaning and ready to throw up. At least the Family was well cast!Oh, and by the way, Clint's character development included his interest in reading Gaelic, and his going to church every single day for 33 years (never resolved, except apparently his wife left him at some point way back then). And his priest swears at him from frustration. I can understand that part.As I said, she dies, but I was wondering just how bad they were going to make it when I suddenly realized how she'd actually die. She is in a hospital, can't move, bed sores everywhere (graphically shown), loses a leg to gangrene that set in (unnecessary part of the plot, she was in bad enough shape already), paralyzed for good. Then I realize that Clint will kill her to put her out of her misery. That is exactly what happens. So predictable it was awful. After he kills her (unplugs the machine - predictable, and shoots her full of adrenaline - unpredicted) he goes to a restaurant and gets a slice of lemon pie for himself. Nobody saw him do the deed, so he can just leave to get a price of pie like he did once with her. Darned Clint is trying to get the tears flowing out of his audience, when all the audience wants to do is leave. Speaking of which, once we finally got there, there was no clapping and only silence.Keep in mind here I'm not moaning over this just because she dies. I don't expect a do-good film where she becomes world champion and lives happily ever after (or even loses it all and then regains it all like Rocky Balboa). But, the film was so awfully predictable. I don't believe it was well written, I don't believe it was well directed. At one point where the rough old gravely Clint has refused to take her on as her Manager but coaches her with a couple of tips on how to throw a punch (leading to the inevitable moment when he does take her on as her Manager), he and she are both smiling (for the first and only time in the film) - and you realize they are smiling at each other's acting and that a really poor take was used.Arrrgghhhh.... what a waste of money!!! And this darned thing had better not get any of the Oscars which Clint and Morgan have so cleverly positioned it for!Why does the otherwise excellent Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood (both who have done so much better) feel they can pander to us to get an Oscar?",1,Terrible!,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,4812,"['am', 'very', 'unhappy', 'film.It', 'blatant', 'two', 'ways', 'first', 'rip-off', 'excellent', 'very', 'well', 'received', 'awarded', 'Girl', 'Fight', 'even', 'worse', 'was', 'written', 'solely', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'purposely', 'pandering', 'emotions', 'audience', 'Part', 'way', 'said', 'myself', ""'this"", 'ridiculous', 'could', 'make', 'plainer', 'will', 'bet', 'will', 'kill', 'off', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Well', 'happened', 'have', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narrating', 'voice', 'Clint', 'are', 'gravely', 'oddly', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'appear', 'be', '80', 'years', 'old', 'hard', 'believe', ""'d"", 'still', 'be', 'running', 'gym', 'much', 'less', 'punching', 'bag', 'occasional', 'young', 'tuff', 'way', 'Then', 'Opponent', 'climatic', 'fight', 'scene', 'who', 'sneered', 'was', 'bad', 'stuff', 'was', 'also', 'black', 'German', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'other', 'want', 'make', 'someone', 'real', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Then', 'true', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'positioned', 'badly', 'enough', 'said', 'myself', 'wait', 'more', 'bet', 'criminal', 'ex-hooker', 'minute', 'later', 'was', 'introduced', 'ex-hooker', 'later', 'proved', 'be', 'criminal', 'when', 'losing', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'sucker-punched', 'causing', 'fall', 'permanent', 'breaking', 'neck', 'confined', 'bed', 'entire', 'rest', 'film', '.And', 'product', 'placement', 'unbelievable', 'one', 'point', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'disabled', 'wise', 'janitor', 'gym', 'asked', 'Clint', 'owner', 'why', 'using', 'one', 'brand', 'bleach', 'cleaner', 'clean', 'up', 'scene', 'shot', 'bottle', 'up', 'screen', 'answer', 'best', 'good', 'find', 'out', 'Baby', 'was', 'raised', 'dirt', 'poor', 'have', 'rub', 'saying', 'was', 'waitress', 'age', '13', 'last', 'chance', 'Well', 'course', 'last', 'chance', 'how', 'films', 'work', 'never', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'going', 'smart', 'hard', 'worker', 'pretty', 'why', 'Then', 'find', 'out', 'Missouri', 'so', 'just', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'bet', 'hillbilly', 'Mother', 'family', 'sudden', 'are', 'Mother', '312', 'pounds', 'curses', 'sailor', 'daughter', 'gave', 'house', 'live', 'course', 'teenage', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'stereotype', 'being', 'pregnant', 'minor', ""n't"", 'stereotype', 'enough', 'trash', 'threatening', 'boyfriend', 'Well', 'now', ""'m"", 'groaning', 'ready', 'throw', 'up', 'least', 'Family', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'Oh', 'way', 'Clint', 'character', 'development', 'included', 'interest', 'reading', 'Gaelic', 'going', 'church', 'single', 'day', '33', 'years', 'never', 'resolved', 'apparently', 'wife', 'left', 'point', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'priest', 'swears', 'frustration', 'can', 'understand', 'part.As', 'said', 'was', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'when', 'suddenly', 'realized', 'how', ""'d"", 'actually', 'die', 'hospital', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'bed', 'sores', 'everywhere', 'graphically', 'shown', 'leg', 'gangrene', 'set', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'plot', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'shape', 'already', 'paralyzed', 'good', 'Then', 'realize', 'Clint', 'will', 'kill', 'put', 'misery', 'exactly', 'what', 'So', 'predictable', 'was', 'awful', 'unplugs', 'machine', 'predictable', 'shoots', 'full', 'adrenaline', 'unpredicted', 'restaurant', 'slice', 'lemon', 'pie', 'Nobody', 'saw', 'do', 'deed', 'can', 'just', 'leave', 'get', 'price', 'pie', 'did', 'once', 'Darned', 'Clint', 'trying', 'get', 'tears', 'flowing', 'audience', 'when', 'audience', 'do', 'leave', 'Speaking', 'once', 'finally', 'got', 'there', 'was', 'clapping', 'only', 'silence.Keep', 'mind', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'moaning', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'do-good', 'film', 'where', 'world', 'champion', 'happily', 'ever', 'even', 'then', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'awfully', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'rough', 'old', 'gravely', 'Clint', 'refused', 'take', 'Manager', 'couple', 'tips', 'how', 'throw', 'punch', 'leading', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'when', 'take', 'Manager', 'are', 'smiling', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'film', 'realize', 'are', 'smiling', 'other', 'acting', 'really', 'poor', 'take', 'was', 'used.Arrrgghhhh', 'what', 'waste', 'money', 'darned', 'thing', 'had', 'better', 'not', 'get', 'Oscars', 'Clint', 'Morgan', 'have', 'so', 'cleverly', 'positioned', 'Why', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'feel', 'can', 'pander', 'get', 'Oscar']",N/A
633356,A2I4WF84MWIBO7,B00005JNP1,Kai Lu,"[7, 16]","Million Dollar Baby is basically a good, entertaining movie that fails to deliver on the promise of greatness implied in its many glowing reviews.When stripped of its hype, the aura of magic that Eastwood and Freeman bring to anything they touch, Million Dollar Baby is at heart not very imaginative, not very realistic, and ultimately seems to be a telegraphed attempt at manipulation and Oscar-mongering than actual quality filmmaking.To begin with, it seems highly unlikely that a woman past the age of thirty with no past athletic experience or training can suddenly waltz into other women's sports and dominate them, especially when these other women seem to have devoted their entire lives to their sports for many years, and besides that are younger and in better physical condition. What this movie seems to be saying is that anyone can drop right into a sport and expect to be a winner just because you are tough and really want to win. A thirty three year old woman may love ballet and really want to be a ballerina, and of course she can be, however to imply that just because she works hard she can be the best ballet in the world is utterly ridiculous.Million Dollar Baby would have been more realistic if the main character became a successful journeywoman fighter who wins some, loses some, and despite all predictions does pretty well against a champion when given a chance to fight the champ, although she of course must lose in the end. Sound familiar? Of course it does.Million Dollar Baby thinks it's as good as Rocky but it isn't. It thinks it's better because it tacks on that ridiculous coda at the end where Eastwood proves he loves the girl by pulling the plug on her.If he really loved her he would have slapped the living daylights out of her for even thinking life is over just because she can't be a fighter anymore. If he were any kind of friend he would support her in her hard times and try to inspire her to succeed in something else, in other words, find new meaning for her existence. Million Dollar Baby would be inpirational if the girl would have, despite all odds, shown the guts she allegedly had in the ring and applied them to the challenges she faced as a recuperating spinal cord injury.PS. I think the movie would have been better if Eastwood's character had died in the end, with him realizing he really HAD trained a world champion when his girl fighter stuns the world not by doing anything as trite as walking again at the end of the movie (because that seems unlikely given the state of her injuries), but simply refuses to die, and gives life a try and finds meaning in herself. Eastwood's character could leave the boxing gym to Freeman's character in his will, and Freeman and the girl fighter could devote all their energies toward training Danger's character NOT into a world champ, but a fighter who gets respect.As it is, the movie ends pointlessly.",3,"Basically a good movie, albeit highly overrated, and not without its flaws",1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2906,"['Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'basically', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'deliver', 'promise', 'greatness', 'implied', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews.When', 'stripped', 'hype', 'aura', 'magic', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'bring', 'anything', 'touch', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'heart', 'not', 'very', 'imaginative', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'be', 'telegraphed', 'attempt', 'manipulation', 'Oscar-mongering', 'actual', 'quality', 'filmmaking.To', 'begin', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'woman', 'age', 'thirty', 'past', 'athletic', 'experience', 'training', 'can', 'suddenly', 'waltz', 'other', 'women', 'sports', 'dominate', 'especially', 'when', 'other', 'women', 'seem', 'have', 'devoted', 'entire', 'lives', 'sports', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'younger', 'better', 'physical', 'condition', 'What', 'movie', 'be', 'saying', 'anyone', 'can', 'drop', 'right', 'sport', 'expect', 'be', 'winner', 'just', 'are', 'tough', 'really', 'want', 'win', 'A', 'thirty', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'may', 'love', 'ballet', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'ballerina', 'course', 'can', 'be', 'however', 'imply', 'just', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'ballet', 'world', 'utterly', 'ridiculous.Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'main', 'character', 'became', 'successful', 'journeywoman', 'fighter', 'who', 'predictions', 'pretty', 'well', 'champion', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'fight', 'champ', 'course', 'must', 'lose', 'end', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'course', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'as', 'good', 'Rocky', ""n't"", 'better', 'ridiculous', 'coda', 'end', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'girl', 'pulling', 'plug', 'her.If', 'really', 'loved', 'would', 'have', 'slapped', 'living', 'daylights', 'even', 'thinking', 'life', 'over', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fighter', 'anymore', 'were', 'kind', 'friend', 'would', 'support', 'hard', 'times', 'try', 'inspire', 'succeed', 'something', 'else', 'other', 'words', 'find', 'new', 'meaning', 'existence', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'would', 'be', 'inpirational', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'odds', 'shown', 'guts', 'allegedly', 'had', 'ring', 'applied', 'challenges', 'faced', 'recuperating', 'spinal', 'cord', 'injury.PS', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'had', 'died', 'end', 'realizing', 'really', 'HAD', 'trained', 'world', 'champion', 'when', 'girl', 'fighter', 'world', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'as', 'trite', 'walking', 'again', 'end', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'given', 'state', 'injuries', 'simply', 'die', 'life', 'try', 'meaning', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'could', 'leave', 'boxing', 'gym', 'Freeman', 'character', 'will', 'Freeman', 'girl', 'fighter', 'could', 'devote', 'energies', 'training', 'Danger', 'character', 'NOT', 'world', 'champ', 'fighter', 'who', 'respect.As', 'movie', 'pointlessly']",N/A

It started out like many sports movies with a young, unknown athlete (in this case Hillary Swank) who decides that her whole life will be dedicated to winning a championship in her sport.  Her mentor (Clint Eastwood) is a crusty old curmudgeon who keeps telling her that he doesn't coach girls.  When his best fighter leaves him, however, he finds himself with time on his hands and frustration in his heart, and he agrees to train her.  I did not expect the dark turn that the movie takes and I'm not sure what point is being made by the crisis situation.  On the positive side, the characters are real and believable.  It is the situations in which they find themselves that strains credibility.

633360,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JNP1,Kaya Savas,"[7, 11]","MOVIE: A man and a woman who are alone in this world find each other in Clint Eastwood's Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. Frankie (Eastwood) is an aging trainer who is afriad of moving on to the future and dwells on his past, which is really never told to the audience in the film.  All we know is that he and his daughter are not getting along, and each week he sends a letter only to have it returned to sender unopened.  Maggie (Swank) is the opposite, a young woman who also has a bad relationship with her family, but instead wants to move on from her past instead of trying to mend broken wounds.  She is poor, lives in a one room place, and is a waitress who pockets the leftovers for herself.  After Frankie's boxer moves onto another manager due to the fact that he felt that Frankie was holding him from a championship, Frankie feels lost.  His only friend is an aging boxer, Eddie (Freeman), who lost one eye because his manager left him and couldn't ""protect"" him.  Frankie feels that the number one rule in boxing is to ""protect yourself"", and Eddie feels that Frankie can't always protect his boxers from everything because he's protecting himself from a championship. While reluctant to train Maggie at first, he ends up taking her under her wing and she slowly becomes one heck of a fighter.  The relationship of these two build and build, and the audience really sees how they fit each other perfectly.  Maggie's father is dead, and her mother lives in a trailer ignoring her, Frankie has no family it seems (but the audience never  really knows) and her daughter never answers his letters.  The film is told through partial narrations from Morgan Freeman's character, who is really the only person who knows Frankie.  He lives in the gym that Frankie owns, and serves as the janitor.  The theme of boxing is used as a symbol for the punches that life throws at you, and that is why it is important to always ""protect yourself"".  This is not a boxing movie, but a film about the troubles of life that all of us can relate to.  The ending is very beautiful, very sad, very moving.  I am a huge film fanatic and usually see Oscar contenders before the ceremony, but I missed this one, in fact it was the only one I missed.  Now I wish I saw it before because it would have had my vote. The film is beautiful, just beautiful, probably the most moving film in the last 10 years. I don't remember a film where I was as touched as I was from Million Dollar Baby. Even when I watch the trailer now I get tears in my eyes.  If you haven't seen the film, I cannot stress enough the journey you are missing.ACTING: Hilary Swank deserves the Oscar, and so does Morgan Freeman. I thought DiCaprio gave the best performance of the year before I saw Clint Eastwood here, and he was definately more deserving than Jamie Foxx or DiCaprio.  The chemistry is perfect between all three of them. The sweetness of the relationship betwen Frankie and Maggie are so real and it never feels forced or unreal.  While Swank's character is 32 in the film, you'd swear she was a little girl, and that is what really sparks the father/daughter relationship the two share through these times in their lives even though they're not related.  Morgan Freeman, while a washed up boxer, is the wisest of the characters, always providing insight in every situation that is befitting.  The acting is top notch, and Clint Eastwood is magnificent.BOTTOM LINE: Eastwood's production company is called Mal Paso, which translates from Italian as Bad Choice. This is a tribute to Sergio Leone because everyone in his life back then told him that doing those Spahgetti Westerns was a bad choice, and would ruin his career.  Well, I guess they weren't such a mal paso after all. Eastwood is more accomplished as a director than he is an actor, while he was America's (and Italy's) tough guy, here he shows his emotional side and his brilliant perspective on  drama, which is equivelent to life. Isn't It? I mean drama in films and books are meant to tell a story based on one's view on life, so drama is life.

These 3 seasoned actors brilliant interpretation of their characters makes this is a gripping narrative, and a must-see film.  After watching the film you begin to realize that achieving fame and professional success does not automatically translate into personal happiness and fulfillment.  In a way, the film highlights how life is fleeting and how you need to need to learn to live every moment of it and make something out of it for yourself.Simply put: the movie traces the growth of Swank from an ill-trained novice boxer to an incredibly successful boxer. This meteoric rise happens within a couple of years, and had it not been for Eastwood's coaching, Swank would have reminded just a novice, and an ill-trained boxer. The movie examines what drives Swank to take up boxing, and how, why,and under what circumstances Eastwood agrees to coach, and how, and when Freedman acts as a catalyst in the whole process.The film personifies human perseverance, grit and determination, and shows us that if we apply our mind to a goal we can achieve it. Some wise man rightly put, ""When you are ready, a master will appear,"" and that is precisely what happens in Swank's case. With every passing year, Clint Eastwood's prowess as a director, musician and an actor, have become more nuanced and refined. There is no flabbiness in his interpretation of human emotions, and this is an incredibly hard thing to pull off. With every passing movie, I am constantly amazed at depth of creativity and talent that this ex-spaghetti (sp?) western actor continues to display.This is one of the best movies from Eastwood's repertoire. This is a must-see movie if you love movies, and believe in that wonderful human emotion: determination.",5,Thoughtful movie about  human dignity and perserverance,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,2036,"['Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'powerful', 'movie', 'human', 'perseverance', 'ambitions', 'emotions', 'films', 'centers', 'three', 'characters', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'aspiring', 'boxer', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fading', 'boxing', 'coach', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'boxer', 'who', 'now', 'reduced', 'task', 'managing', 'boxing', 'facility', '3', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'brilliant', 'interpretation', 'characters', 'gripping', 'narrative', 'must-see', 'film', 'watching', 'film', 'begin', 'realize', 'achieving', 'fame', 'professional', 'success', 'not', 'automatically', 'translate', 'personal', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'way', 'film', 'highlights', 'how', 'life', 'fleeting', 'how', 'need', 'need', 'learn', 'live', 'moment', 'make', 'something', 'yourself.Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'growth', 'Swank', 'ill-trained', 'novice', 'boxer', 'incredibly', 'successful', 'boxer', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'couple', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Eastwood', 'coaching', 'Swank', 'would', 'have', 'reminded', 'just', 'novice', 'ill-trained', 'boxer', 'movie', 'what', 'Swank', 'take', 'up', 'boxing', 'how', 'why', 'what', 'circumstances', 'Eastwood', 'agrees', 'coach', 'how', 'when', 'Freedman', 'catalyst', 'whole', 'process.The', 'film', 'personifies', 'human', 'perseverance', 'grit', 'determination', 'apply', 'mind', 'goal', 'can', 'achieve', 'wise', 'man', 'rightly', 'put', 'When', 'are', 'ready', 'master', 'will', 'appear', 'precisely', 'what', 'Swank', 'case', 'passing', 'year', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'prowess', 'director', 'musician', 'actor', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'nuanced', 'refined', 'flabbiness', 'interpretation', 'human', 'emotions', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'passing', 'movie', 'am', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'depth', 'creativity', 'talent', 'ex-spaghetti', 'sp', 'western', 'actor', 'display.This', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'Eastwood', 'repertoire', 'must-see', 'movie', 'love', 'movies', 'believe', 'wonderful', 'human', 'emotion', 'determination']",N/A
633363,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00005JNP1,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[8, 11]","This movie is based on one short story taken from a collection of boxing tales by (author:F.X O'Toole). In this particular story, a manager is trying to turn a woman into a top boxing contender.This could so easily have been a smarmy or unbelievable film but, thank goodness, Eastwood has the directing and acting chops to pull it off and Hillary Swank proves yet again that she is an excellent actress, as she portrays a young woman desperate to make something of herself and with few other options in life. Eastwood is her manager and, as you'd expect, he is rather hardened and gruff and not open to managing a woman boxer (at first). He doesn't believe women should be boxers, period..end of discussion...and how and why he changes his mind is believeable.As he does so well, Eastwood manages to stay away from sentimentality, letting his feelings (especially the softer ones) show only at critical moments in the film - and even then, he never overplays the moments, trusting viewers to get the point, respecting his audience.Swank makes the most of her angular features and hard edges and is convincing as a poor girl who is desperate for a break, someone who has run out of options. She looks and acts hungry - for a break, for success, for some way out of her dead end life.The tone of the film is equally wonderful and the lighting and cinematography are crucial to setting the right mood.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 0]",For some time the strongest problems I've heard from other viewers about Million Dollar Baby is that it's either unrealistic or it's too depressing. Besides whatever wrong technical facts about Maggie's hospital stay I think this is a perfect and realistic story. Yes it was depressing but there are plenty of real people with worse stories that never got anything good in life. Though Maggie had an unfair life she kept a smile on her face and still worked hard to get where she wanted to be. She was tough and fought with no regrets. She may have not had the family she wanted but at least she got to fight and be important to someone. Basically the first time you watch this film you should watch it for the story not hunting for technical rights and wrongs. If you can get by that it's very enjoyable.,4,Good Story,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,805,"['time', 'strongest', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'viewers', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'unrealistic', 'too', 'depressing', 'wrong', 'technical', 'facts', 'Maggie', 'hospital', 'stay', 'think', 'perfect', 'realistic', 'story', 'Yes', 'was', 'depressing', 'are', 'plenty', 'real', 'people', 'worse', 'stories', 'never', 'got', 'anything', 'good', 'life', 'Maggie', 'had', 'unfair', 'life', 'kept', 'smile', 'face', 'still', 'worked', 'hard', 'get', 'where', 'wanted', 'be', 'was', 'tough', 'fought', 'regrets', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'family', 'wanted', 'least', 'got', 'fight', 'be', 'important', 'someone', 'Basically', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'should', 'watch', 'story', 'not', 'hunting', 'technical', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'enjoyable']",N/A
633365,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JNP1,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 7]","I didn't much like Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning MILLION DOLLAR BABY the first time I saw it. When its first 90 minutes of boxing-movie cliches (however well-acted and directed) gave way to 40 final minutes of tearjerking, (eventually) morally-charged drama, I found myself unmoved. Instead, I just couldn't get past how contrived and melodramatic this last third of the movie seemed in comparison to the rest. Many people, of course, were applauding Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis' refusal to bow down to cliche towards the end of the picture; to me, though, the film's relentlessly catastrophic finale seemed more shameless than sincere. I balked.But the film had garnered so much praise, and won the 2004 Best Picture Oscar to boot, that the recent release of the film on DVD prompted me to look at it again. Now that I've re-seen it, I've basically come down to the following conclusion: I still think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is overrated, yet it may still be worth seeing all the same.What changed? Not much, really. I've always appreciated Clint Eastwood's style as a director. In a time when movies seem to be getting louder and flashier, here is an older-generation artist who makes films that are quiet, introspective, and character-based. While a lot of his films are basically genre films, Eastwood takes his time and utmost care to make films that make you care about the characters and situations onscreen. It's an approach that worked especially well in his 1992 Oscar-winner UNFORGIVEN and his 2003 film (maybe his masterpiece) MYSTIC RIVER, because both films also had resonant themes to go along with its stripped-down style. UNFORGIVEN was about the dehumanization of violence in man, and MYSTIC RIVER could be seen as a critique (though perhaps not necessarily a flat-out denunciation) of vigilante violence.What is MILLION DOLLAR BABY about, then? I guess it's ultimately a love story. No, the relationship between Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and her manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) never becomes the typical Hollywood-style love affair. It's a deeper love and admiration that develops between the two, and, as the tragedy unfolds towards the end of this film, that father-daughter-type relationship gets pushed to its emotional limits.The choice that Frankie ultimately must make is probably what most of the film's admirers love about MILLION DOLLAR BABY; it's perhaps the source of my biggest reservations about it. (SPOILER ALERT) Now, after seeing the movie again, I'll admit that the final 15 minutes---as Frankie is forced to choose between keeping Maggie alive or killing her---does have some power as human drama; it's a choice between showing your love for someone and personally sinning to do so, and Clint Eastwood has perhaps never been finer in characterizing this internal conflict in Frankie. But---even after all these months---I still can't quite get past Maggie's decision, and how wrong it feels to me in the context of the Maggie the rest of the film has shown us. Here's a character who is pretty much heart personified: even when Frankie initially rejects her, even when her own mother decries her boxing, and even when she starts to face slightly tougher opponents, she never fails to show steely determination. But then the twist comes, she sustains a paralyzing spinal cord injury, and, when the personal horrors start to pile up (the last straw is when she is forced to lose her legs thanks to bedsores that form on them), she decides to ask Frankie to put her out of her misery. When I saw MILLION DOLLAR BABY in the theater months ago, at the time I simply didn't believe that the eternally-optimistic Maggie would have made that kind of decision---not the way Paul Haggis had written the character, and certainly not the way Hilary Swank played her, even during the hospital scenes preceding that important decision scene. I tried to put such a misgiving out of my mind in watching the film for a second time, and I think I was able to appreciate that, ultimately, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is more Frankie's story than Maggie's---it's less about Maggie's rise to the top than about how Frankie, with Maggie's help, opens his heart and stops ""protecting himself."" Still, I think the problem with the way the film approaches Maggie's decision is that there isn't enough of an attempt to depict her change from determined to suicidal; it just happens one fateful night, out of the blue. To mildly cynical me, it comes off as more a bald attempt to shock and jerk tears rather than a serious examination of the moral and ethical dilemma of euthanasia...in other words, manipulative.In fact, almost all of this bleak final act of MILLION DOLLAR BABY engendered a similar feeling: yes, it may be a bold move on the part of the filmmakers to shift into such dark territory in the midst of what has so far been typical boxing-underdog drama. It's daring, but I don't think it pays off: there's little during the emotionally draining final act to suggest a deepening of themes presented in the first two-thirds. Instead, it feels like two different movies in one, and there's barely a connecting thread to give both parts a kind of unity to it---except maybe its idea of boxing as a metaphor for life. Instead of trying to tackle his themes head-on, Haggis and Eastwood take the easy approach: overlay it upon a comfortingly familiar underdog tale, and then sucker punch their way into the ""important"" part. It felt crudely manipulative to me in the theater, and---as well-done as the ending is---it still feels that way to me now. At least MYSTIC RIVER's tragic ending was all of a piece with its dark vision; the sadness at the end of this film seems merely unearned.Despite my serious reservations, though I must give the film at least some credit for its, uh, unpredictability; for the grace that Eastwood brings to the film; for the compelling drama of the film's final 15 minutes; and especially for its actors. Clint Eastwood has only been getting better with age, and once again he uses our knowledge of his former tough-guy persona to surprise us with his vividness and emotional depth (especially towards the end). Morgan Freeman finally got an Oscar for his performance as Frankie's confidante Scrap, and, while the role is basically a rehash of the best-friend role he played in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Freeman is such an imaginative and authoritative actor that he still manages to find some fresh notes to his performance anyway. And then there's Hilary Swank---another Oscar-winner---who takes a terribly underwritten role---she's basically a device to get Frankie to open up---and injects with as much heart and conviction as she can muster. This may be an even more impressive characterization than her Brandon Teena in BOYS DON'T CRY (the source of her other acting Oscar), since Haggis doesn't really give her much to work with.I give MILLION DOLLAR BABY 3 stars, because, for all of its refreshing simplicity and grace, I find the film to be deeply flawed, with a problematic third act that strikes me as terribly contrived, manipulative, and heavy-handed. And yet, in spite of my reservations, this is perhaps a film worth seeing anyway, since at least the ending does give you something to think about and discuss. If any movie engenders deep discussions about life, death, and love after its over, I suppose it must be doing something right. And maybe the fact that the film forces me to go back and forth in my mind---as I think I've done in this review---means something. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not a masterpiece, but, in its own crude way, it's effective.",3,"Overrated, but perhaps worth a look anyway",1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,7628,"['did', ""n't"", 'much',

It talks about Hilary Swank (as Maggie Fitzgerald) wants to convince Clint Eastwood (as Frankie Dunn (the coach)) to train her as a good woman fighter as her future goal.  For the story, it is very touching as it tells how she can gain her reputation by winning her competition.  However, she fails in the middle.  At the end, she dies.  For the visuals, they are awesome especially the scenes of the fighting competition where she beats someone or someone beats her.  They are just fantastic.  I just feel stunning.  For the cast/acting, it is just very good.  That is why this movie has many Oscar's nomination.  For me, I like Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald.  It is because it is hard for her to shoot this movie, as she has to fight, sleep inside the hospital with her medical aid on.  With her medical aid on, it will make her very tough to speak.  Clint Eastwood (as Frankie Dunn) and Morgan Freeman (as Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) are also performing well.  So, I think they deserve to win awards.  He wins the best director.  However, for the best actor, Clint has the own challenger for Oscar called Jamie Foxx from ""Ray"" to make his competition very tough.  For the directions, it is just perfect.

Halfway through the movie an event occurs which causes the audience to sit up and groan with shock.  After this event, the movie becomes a very different kind of viewing experience, a film almost European in its insistence on philosophical type questions about what is the meaning of life, and how does the quality of life differ from its quantity?  Eastwood himself shows off more sides to his character than ever before.  His talks with his parish priest will leave you in stitches, because he's so ornery.  And yet he will bring you to tears later on in the movie by confiding in the same priest a great dilemma he has to resolve for himself.  Eastwood has aged like a old stone figure from Easter Island, and there are grooves running vertically right down each of his eyes that seem made to channel tears.  Morgan Freeman also does excellent work in this.  If you are tired of Freeman ""being Morgan Freeman"" in each of his recent movies, rest assured, this is a part with some real meat on it and shows you what a talented actor he really is.  Dramaturgically, the weight of the whole movie rests on his performance and his ability to react to the chemistry and plotline between Eastwood's and Swank's characters, and he pulls this off marvelously.I didn't want to see this movie because I didn't want to see Hilary Swank butching it up again.  Is that awfui of me to say?  But indeed I shouldn't have been so gloomy about her.  She is great in this movie, from beginning to end, she gives it an oddly life-affirming glow.  Her soul shines through even under the most adverse of conditions (I dare say no more for fear of spoiling the movie for you) and she looks beautiful.  She plays a boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, on whom Eastwood bestows the ringside monicker ""Macushla.""  Throughout the film she keeps asking him, what does Macushla mean?  I found it odd that the curious, alert Maggie would never have researched the answer herself, but when she finds out what it means, you will be bawling your head off and leaving the theater in a mist of tears.  Go to see it yourself and you will be grateful that in our modern age, one man has the courage to go back and try to re-tell the world's oldest story and this time, he gets it right.",5,Eastwood's Tears,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2341,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'fi', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'years', 'one', 'unique', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'event', 'audience', 'sit', 'up', 'groan', 'shock', 'event', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'viewing', 'experience', 'film', 'almost', 'European', 'insistence', 'philosophical', 'type', 'questions', 'what', 'meaning', 'life', 'how', 'quality', 'life', 'differ', 'quantity', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'sides', 'character', 'ever', 'talks', 'parish', 'priest', 'will', 'leave', 'stitches', 'so', 'ornery', 'yet', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'later', 'movie', 'confiding', 'same', 'priest', 'great', 'dilemma', 'resolve', 'Eastwood', 'aged', 'old', 'stone', 'figure', 'Easter', 'Island', 'are', 'grooves', 'running', 'vertically', 'right', 'down', 'eyes', 'seem', 'made', 'channel', 'tears', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'also', 'excellent', 'work', 'are', 'tired', 'Freeman', 'being', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'recent', 'movies', 'rest', 'assured', 'part', 'real', 'meat', 'what', 'talented', 'actor', 'really', 'Dramaturgically', 'weight', 'whole', 'movie', 'rests', 'performance', 'ability', 'react', 'chemistry', 'plotline', 'Eastwood', 'Swank', 'characters', 'off', 'marvelously.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'butching', 'up', 'again', 'awfui', 'say', 'indeed', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'gloomy', 'great', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'oddly', 'life-affirming', 'glow', 'soul', 'shines', 'even', 'most', 'adverse', 'conditions', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'boxer', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'whom', 'Eastwood', 'ringside', 'monicker', 'Macushla', 'film', 'asking', 'what', 'Macushla', 'mean', 'found', 'curious', 'alert', 'Maggie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'researched', 'answer', 'when', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'bawling', 'head', 'leaving', 'theater', 'mist', 'tears', 'Go', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'grateful', 'modern', 'age', 'one', 'man', 'courage', 'go', 'back', 'try', 're-tell', 'world', 'oldest', 'story', 'time', 'right']",N/A
633368,A2VZA7NZR75G3T,B00005JNP1,Kevin O'Mahoney,"[1, 1]","Clint Eastwood has become perhaps Hollywood's best director, while remaining an actor of modest skills.  And while Clint has produced and directed some great movies like ""Unforgiven,"" he has had some clunkers. A movie about a woman boxer sounded like a painful clunker. But what emerged on screen was not some plastic movie capitalizing on the phenomenon that is women's boxing, but an authentic story with incredible acting. Clint was not a mediocre actor carried along in a well told drama, but the principle emotional force of the story. Clint disappeared into his character.  It was the best acting of his long career and an oscar worthy performance. Not unlike ""Mickey"" of Rocky 1, Clint portrays a complex boxing manager/trainer -- hard as a hickory nut, but with tremendous heart.  Hillary Swank is magnificent.  She plays ""Maggy,"" a girl who wants to pursue, not so much a dream, but goal that will make life bearable. She possesses a dignity and a charm that overcome her white-trash roots and mangled grammer.  She is truly inspiring and believable as a woman boxer.  Morgan Freeman plays a grizzled old boxer who cleans the gym.  Freeman's character is a little cliche and he doesn't give a performance quite up to the calibre of Eastwood or Swank, but he never detracts from the movie.

633370,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNP1,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 8]","Clint Eastwood's breakthrough came through Sergio Leone in the 60s where he acted as a cool killer with exceptional precision shooting people.  Eastwood's precision never changed as he continued to act and began shooting his own films, which includes mysterious Westerns such as the High Plains Drifter (1974) to geriatric cowboys in Unforgiven (1992).  Unforgiven is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of the 90s.  This politically active actor and director has also made films about Charlie Parker, proud Marines, stealthy thieves, and childhood tragedies.  Several of Eastwood's films have received Oscar nominations in many categories as did Mystic River (2003), which was considered one of the best films of 2003.  Nonetheless, it seems as if Eastwood has searched within himself through decades of experience and wisdom, as he has found something special that can be seen most recently in Million Dollar Baby.Ding, the bell sounds, as the first round commences where two fighters stare down each other's eyes while instinctively attempting to dance the boxers tap to sweet victory.  Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) knows everything there is about the boxers tap, as he routinely utters, ""You have to protect yourself"" with his hoarse voice.  It is in the ring where Frankie is most comfortable, which has always been regarded as a mans world to him.  In addition, Frankie has acquired this knowledge of boxing through years of training and observing a mass of fighters loosing and winning, but also seeing many of them get seriously hurt.When Frankie does not coach his boxers, he studies Gaelic, reads Yates, and dwells on the many mysteries of life.  Through attending daily masses, Frankie questions his faith, but also harasses the Priest with annoying questions.  However, it seems as if Frankie is stuck in his own-trained mentality as he instinctively does what he teaches, defending oneself, as some say it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  Yet, this old dog, Frankie that is, seeks continuously new knowledge, but never seems to progress with wisdom as his defensive instincts prevent him from reaching greater wisdom.Frankie's defensive instincts seem to prevent him from taking on female fighters and training them as he trains males.  It also seems as if Frankie perceives women, or as he refers to the women, girls, as too weak and not fit to fight.  This male chauvinistic approach that Frankie has could have caused him difficulty in his past, as he has a daughter with whom he cannot communicate.  When someone asks Frankie about his daughter it appears as if he tries to avoid it, yet being truthful, as he gives quick responses and smiles.  Frankie's behavior in regards to his daughter gives an impression that he tries to protect himself.Despite what Frankie's instincts say, he meets a girl, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), that is particularly hardheaded about having him as her coach, and he ends up training her.  Initially, Maggie asks Frankie whether he is interested in training her to which he responds, ""I don't train girls"".  Maggie does not seem to be discouraged as she joins Frankie's gym, pursuing her dream, as Frankie continuously reminds her that he does not coach girls.  This bickering  between Maggie and Frankie continues until Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a retired boxer and friend of Frankie, recognizes Maggie's tremendous intrinsic drive and determination.  Despite Frankie's directions not to help Maggie, Scrap, who lives and works in the gym, offers her some small tips on how to box, which results in improvement.  When Maggie displays her progress it leads to a small discussion between her and Frankie in which he offers to help her until she can get a manager of her own.Million Dollar Baby could in many aspects be compared to other boxing films such as Rocky (1976), Girlfight (2000), Raging Bull (1980), and Champ (1979). However, it does not focus on boxing, but rather the characters and their decisions in life.  The training of Maggie brings both Frankie and her on a soul searching journey as they travel to visit her family, across Europe, and to a shot for the world title.  However, the fight scenes do not become an overburden of desire to win glory, money, or a title.  Instead Maggie boxes to display her respect and loyalty to Frankie, which guides them into a long and painful exploration as they get closer to one another.Clint Eastwood lays down the six shooter from his past as his marksmanship aims for empathy and poignant solution.  The empathetic feeling in Million Dollar Baby could be tough on the audience as it could be emotionally and physically draining, in some aspects, and it could feel as if the audience fought a 15 round match and lost.  Under the direction of Eastwood the cast performs exceptionally as they supported each other and stand out by themselves.  The cinematography interestingly uses plenty of shadows in order to enhance the drama within each scene, which is something that Eastwood is known to do on occasion.  Ultimately, the audience will have experienced brilliant cinema, which offers much to ponder while recovering from the punches of Eastwood's brilliant direction.",5,Brilliant Direction Aims For

Aside from the great performances in the film and the gloomy overcast camera work that sets the tone to the film very well, I had a few problems with the script. I was enjoying the film at about 4 1/2 stars during the first two acts, but what happened in the final act made me drop it down to a 4 star rating. When Maggie goes down and is paralyzed from a dirty boxing fight, I couldn't help but feel that this was so very Oscar cliched. A story of a poor girl (designed to make you feel sorry for her) rises to the top and then tragedy strikes and all that is taken away from her and she dies in the end. The Oscars and critics took this formulaic drama setup hook, line, and sinker. With this in my mind, I had a hard time getting totally emotional at the end. Another part I had a problem with was with how Clint Eastwood's character just walsed in the hospital, assisted Maggie's suicide and then left like it was some normal thing. In real life, his ass would be sitting in prison for euthanasia.It sounds like I'm bashing this movie completely, but I really did like it. I just don't allow myself to be brainwashed into thinking this is the best movie of my life just because that's what the Oscars want me to think. It's awesomely acted by some very fine actors who bring a sense of complete realism to their characters, and it's excellently shot, but I feel Clint Eastwood has done better and there were better films that 2004 produced that were more deserving of the best picture award such as the biopics The Aviator or Ray.",4,"Good, but don't be mislead by the Oscars and critics, think for yourself!",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1682,"['_MAJOR', 'spoiler', 'alert_Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'fine', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'overrated', 'Aside', 'great', 'performances', 'film', 'gloomy', 'overcast', 'camera', 'work', 'tone', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'script', 'was', 'enjoying', 'film', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'what', 'happened', 'final', 'act', 'made', 'drop', 'down', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'When', 'Maggie', 'down', 'paralyzed', 'dirty', 'boxing', 'fight', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'Oscar', 'cliched', 'A', 'story', 'poor', 'girl', 'designed', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'top', 'then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'taken', 'away', 'end', 'Oscars', 'critics', 'took', 'formulaic', 'drama', 'setup', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'mind', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'totally', 'emotional', 'end', 'part', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'how', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'just', 'walsed', 'hospital', 'assisted', 'Maggie', 'suicide', 'then', 'left', 'was', 'normal', 'thing', 'real', 'life', 'ass', 'would', 'be', 'sitting', 'prison', 'euthanasia.It', 'sounds', ""'m"", 'bashing', 'movie', 'completely', 'really', 'did', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'brainwashed', 'thinking', 'best', 'movie', 'life', 'just', 'what', 'Oscars', 'want', 'think', 'awesomely', 'acted', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'sense', 'complete', 'realism', 'characters', 'excellently', 'shot', 'feel', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'done', 'better', 'were', 'better', 'films', '2004', 'produced', 'were', 'more', 'deserving', 'best', 'picture', 'award', 'such', 'biopics', 'Aviator', 'Ray']",N/A

633374,A29R4FCO6RFX4K,B00005JNP1,"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy""","[1, 3]","On paper, Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' doesn't sound like anything special. The tale of a tough girl from a white-trash background who persuades a reluctant trainer to teach her the ropes and rises from nobody to champion in double-quick time. You might think this is just another triumph-against-the-odds movie to file alongside the likes of 'Rocky', but you'd be wrong. Thanks to a strong screenplay, subtle direction and a trio of flawless performances, 'Million Dollar Baby' is much more than just another boxing film. In fact, it's one of the most impressive and emotionally involving films that Eastwood has yet made.Eastwood himself takes the role of Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck former boxing manager who now trains fighters a small, ramshackle gym. Frankie's right-hand man is Scrap(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a boxer before he lost an eye in the ring. One night, as Frankie is heading home from a match, he is approached by a young woman named Maggie(Hilary Swank). She believes she has what it takes to be a boxer despite her inexperience and the fact that she's already 31 years old. Frankie doesn't train girls, and he ignores her requests, but she's soon turning up at the gym every day and he can see that she's got something special. He agrees to be her trainer and it's not long before she's knocking out a series of opponents in the first round.A championship bout is on the horizon for Maggie, and the film seems set for a predictable climax. But after remarkable turn of events, we are hurled into a totally different movie, a much darker and more complex film than we've been watching for the past 90 minutes.Superbly adapted by Paul Haggis from FX O'Toole's short story collection 'Rope Burns', 'Million Dollar Baby' is a film that, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, may have slipped into melodrama or mawkish sentimentality. No chance of that here, with Eastwood's intelligent, sparse direction focused on character and story above all else. Eastwood shrouds the film in shadows and drains it of colour, until it's almost like watching a black-and-white film; Eastwood is using light and dark as an expression of the human condition and sometimes it's hard to see the actor's faces which makes the words they say take on extra resonance. Morgan Freeman's narration gives events the feel of a fable and it's impossible not to be drawn into the story and to care deeply about the characters involved.The three main cast members all turn in first-rate performances too. Hilary Swank, who has dropped off the radar since 'Boys Don't Cry', returns with an even better display than the one which won her an Academy Award. She takes a character who could amount to little more than a bunch of clich&eacute;s and invests her with so much heart and determination that most audience members will be rooting for her to make it. It's a gutsy, brave performance and her efforts are complemented by he co-stars. Morgan Freeman's part is hardly a stretch for him, the kind of wise compassionate character he's played numerous times before, but he is typically superb in the role.However, the real surprise is Eastwood himself who gives the best performance of his career. Frankie is a great character, a rugged, tough exterior disguising his big heart and humanity, and Eastwood is heartbreakingly powerful in the role. His developing bond with Maggie is convincing and never overplayed, likewise his enjoyable repartee with Freeman, and these three characters form the heart and soul of the movie.But if there is a flaw in 'Million Dollar Baby', it's the fact the the same care and attention hasn't been spent on the supporting characters. In particular, Maggie's monstrous trailer-trash family are all so one-dimensional that they stick out like sore thumbs when held against the subtle characterisations of the leading trio. The supporting cast elsewhere are also underdeveloped, and it's a misjudgment to have Jay Baruchel provide the gym's 'comic relief' as incompetent boxer Danger.However, it's easy to ignore minor flaws because this is such a wonderful film. Eastwood has proved himself as one of the finest American filmmakers and, in his 75th year, shows no signs of slowing down. 'Million Dollar Baby' is a haunting love story, a deceptively simple character study and a serious analysis of faith and redemption all at once.

Even Frankie deemed female boxing a freak show, rendering him highly reluctant to get involved.The true heart of this movie is a father-figure daughter-figure love story.Frankie had to overcome the following to give Maggie her final gift:1) ethical concerns2) legal concerns3) the guilt-inducing part of Catholicism that would have him go against his heart4) the life-driven part of humanity that struggles against what Frankie did5) his own desire to keep Maggie with himFrankie was already carrying an awful emotional load concerning his biological daughter, as well as a burden  of guilt of over what had happened to Freeman's character.We would all struggle to do what Frankie did for Maggie.

633380,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNP1,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","The first two acts of ""Million Dollar Baby"" are perfectly recognizable to fans of sports movies. Once upon a time there was a crotchety old boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who was running an broken down gym. One day Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks Dunn to train her, but Frankie does not train girls. Maggie sticks around and picks up a few pointers from Eddie ""Scarp-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), another former fighter who cleans up the joint. Eventually Maggie's persistence wears down Frankie, and at the end of the first act he agrees to train her.Remember, he is crotchety and she is stubborn, so the training is problematic. But eventually Maggie starts fighting and the second act moves, as all boxing films must, to the big fight. At that point I was actually thinking of writing a review of ""Million Dollar Baby"" that would start by rewriting the lyrics to Alice Cooper's ""Billion Dollar Babies."" Then, we get to the final act, at which point any and all thoughts of being cute with regards to this movie go away. I had heard whispers about the last act, but conveniently forget all about them during the big fight. One of the nice things about the legacy of ""Rocky"" is that we can never be sure which way these things are going to go (unless, of course, it is a true story).Because ""Million Dollar Baby"" is about the ""freak show"" of women boxing the screenplay by Paul Haggis (based on the ""Rope Burns"" stories of F.X. Toole) gets to have Maggie get really good really fast. Of course she is helped as much by Frankie's wisdom as she is up her ability to hit really hard, but the competition is a lot less than it would be if this was the story of a thirty-something guy trying to become a championship boxer. This is not to be disparaging to the idea, because one of the key subtexts of this story is how the dynamic is changed because Frankie is training a girl, and even if it is laid on thick (he is estranged from his only daughter and her daddy is long dead), Eastwood and Swank make it resonate. The film also avoids conventions and pitfalls by being devoid of the presence of the press (who would have certainly killed the big payoff regarding a key Gaelic phrase).Apparently, Hillary Swank is going to be known as the ""All or Nothing Girl,"" not to mention the bane of Annette Benning's existence, if she wins the Oscar again. Between ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Million Dollar Baby,"" her most notable film was ""The Core,"" but if such drek gives her the money to live on waiting for these choice roles to come along and win Oscars, then that is certainly better than being a one Oscar wonder who gets one fantastic role and then slim pickings for eternity (e.g., Marlee Matlin). Despite her character being burdened by the conventional stereotypes of a white trash background, Swank keeps Maggie from becoming a caricature. Much is made of the fact Swank does all of her own boxing (I like how she keeps her shoulders squared during her fights), but those are not her best acting moments in the film.Samuel L. Jackson was on the ESPN Hotseat when he was asked how cool he was on a scale of 1 to 10. Jackson said 9, and when asked who was a 10 he immediately said Morgan Freeman. The man has played the President of the United States and God, and in this movie he talks about having holes in his sox in a scene that should be shown to acting students as an textbook example of the art. In the 20th century there were three iconic actors representing three different traditions of acting: Laurence Olivier, Spencer Tracy, and Marlon Brando. Freeman is the living embodiment of the Tracy ""know your lines"" school of acting. If the award and standing ovation he got from the Screen Actors Guild last week is any indication, then the most respected actor in Hollywood is finally got to win a long overdue Oscar.Swank kept touting this as Eastwood's best performance and in terms of acting it probably qualifies. I still think of Eastwood in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" as his most engaging performance, and the one most like the actor in real life. But for the most part as an actor Eastwood has moved from the squinting eyes of the Man With No Name to the memorable one-liners of Dirty Harry. In ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" he gets to move beyond such strictures and if my preference for the latter is because I like Eastwood better as a romantic figure, remember which of his performances I have enjoyed the most.Eastwood won a second Academy Award for directing ""Million Dollar Baby,"" but I think part of this was due to the momentum created by his ""Mystic River"" from the previous year, which was arguably his most artistic effort as a director.  But that came the year Peter Jackson got his reward for pulling off ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.""  Eastwood is clearly an aactor's director with three acting nominations and two wins for ""Mystic River"" and the same payoff for ""Million Dollar Baby.""",5,"Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director,

633381,A4E7GD5DPTAAL,B00005JNP1,Lawrence Miller,"[3, 9]","MILLION DOLLAR BABY wants to be great but misses. I wanted to give this movie twice the stars, 10, but give it only four.It does not miss emotionally. It is, in that sense, a knockout.It misses in that it begins with voiceovers telling the viewer stuff that seems irrelevant, an unnecessary device. The voice is that of Morgan Freeman who plays a character. His performance seems more understated than usual and, in that respect, was maybe too ""laid back."" Where Clint's understatement actually underscores his passion, Freeman's understatement adds distance.It misses in that clearly only two characters are needed. Others seem to have been added to flesh out a story that perhaps would have been better ""naked,"" with just the two.Clint Eastwood starred, produced, directed, and wrote the music which was mostly orchestrated by Lennie Neuhaus. His work was at its usual high level.It misses in that the boxing and gym environments are those we have seen before, and except for the fact that the boxing scenes involve women, are also deja vu treatments. I wanted to be surprised.It misses in that the villainous boxers--no spoilers here--seem to be either black or Puerto Rican.It misses in that a comic/tragic character named Danger is added and I haven't figured out why.It does not miss in the work of Hilary (spelled with one l) Swank. But maybe it does in that her character is really, though I hate to admit this to myself because I liked her and her character so much--one dimensional, except later in the film. Ms. Swank has the rare sort of surface beauty that is amplified by no makeup, by being ""natural."" I do not know how rigorously she trained to look like a boxer, to skip rope like a boxer, to hit the speed-bag like a boxer, but the result was highly successful.It was a movie about what the characters call ""heart."" In that, it is reminiscent of a movie I've recently seen again, THE VERDICT, which starred Paul Newman, with script by David Mamet. And in that sense only, is reminiscent of the fine new novel, THE COVENANT, by Naomi Ragen. Heart. Courage. Resilience.Speaking of resilience, it was a movie that, inspirationally, said: Age is no barrier.Ambiguity where it was not needed: Late in the film, Clint's character, a father figure to Hilary Swank's character, kisses her. From the angle shot, it was hard to tell: --Was it a fatherly kiss on the cheek? Or an (implied) lover's kiss on the mouth? Or was it a fatherly kiss on the mouth, as there are some parents and children who kiss on the mouth throughout their lives?It misses in that the two most emotionally satisfying scenes have little to do with the core story: one in which Morgan Freeman gets in the ring with a young bully; and one in which Hilary deals honestly with her family.It misses in that Clint's relationship to church, and to his daughter, both remain a bit muddy, ideas introduced to add depth, but remaining somewhat unresolved (or was I the one who was missing?). These added aspects tell us that this film is really a string quartet trying, unnecessarily trying, to be a full symphony orchestra.

Clearly, it is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It certainly is sad though.  And so I don't think I'd recommend it to everybody.Clint Eastwood has emerged as a new film icon.  He's 75, an age when most actors are quietly moving out of the public eye.  But he is at the top of his game and it's getting better and better.  He's perfect in the role as the fight manager who reluctantly agrees to train Hilary Swank and then connects with her in with a very special kind of bond.  Perhaps though, it is his role as a director that should win him the honors.  Every scene rings true, and the film techniques which use shadows so dark that occasionally the only light is on the perspiration on a actor's face, work well.  It's not overdone but it certainly adds to the atmosphere of the story.Hillary Swank is one of the finest actors I've ever seen. She immediately endears herself to the audience as the trailer trash waitress who dreams of becoming a boxer.  She has a special way of smiling and of showing determination on her face that is completely her own.  And Clint Eastwood brings out the best of her.  Then there is Morgan Freeman as the former boxer who works at the gym and who encourages Eastwood to train Swank.  His role calls for wisdom as well as the angst of losing an eye in his final boxing match many years before.  His presence adds character to every scene he's in.Some of this film is hard to watch, but it's certainly worth it.  It's more than just a boxing story.

Maggie is alone in the world, without a penny to her name.  She comes from a white trash background.  Maggie is set on getting Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to train her.  Dunn is aghast at the idea of training a GIRL.  But Dunn has many sad things troubling him.  His only friends are Scrap (Morgan Freeman) and Father Horvak, a priest who is so irritated by Dunn's irreverence that he cusses like a sailor.The settings of the film are dreary, dingy, depressing, and grimy.  The story is awash in hopelessness; that is what makes Million Dollar Baby seem grim.  Million Dollar Baby is a bit depressing and over the top in some places. You can't honestly believe Maggie's mother and family would be THAT bad.  They are almost caricatures of themselves, not really believable.  But if you look under the surface, you will see that some hope lingers in the hearts of Scrap and Maggie.  Ultimately, a spark is fired in Dunn.  Will the spark last?

And yes, I do believed that its definitely superior to Mystic River. The script is beautifully written, a character study about boxers and Eastwood's direction moves the film along at a crisp and well grounded pace.Hilary Swanks plays a female who wanted to be a boxer. Eastwood plays the trainer who ended up pushing her to the championship title bout. There are excellent chemistry between the two actors and thanks to a great script, there are great deal of believability in their dialogue. While boxing is the theme, this movie is about these two characters, each with their own pains, their own dreams and when combined, they created a bond between them that transcends the boxing world.I thought Clint Eastwood performed fantastically in this movie but I believes that he will be overlooked because his character in this movie looks much like most of his characters in other movies: loner, estranged family members, guff and history of many regrets. For Hilary Swank, this movie should put her up again in the ""A"" class of actresses. Let hope that she will learn to pick better projects in the future.

633392,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JNP1,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[7, 9]","Although I personally preferred Eastwood's prior year adaption of ""Mystic River""; there is no question that he crafted another superb film with ""Million Dollar Baby"", in a year that had no hobbits, and thus, not as much competition.  When you stand back and view Eastwood's growth as a director, the choices he makes, the marvelous way he inspires his actors, well, there's not the hype of Martin Scorsese, but there certainly is finer craftsmanship.  (Note:  Try to forget ""Bloodwork""; in that Eastwood took a marvelous Connelly story and tripped it up by playing a role for which he was far too old. The miscasting eventually sunk the production.)""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of a hard knocks kid, Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank.  Swank showed great ability in ""Boys Don't Cry"", but she's awaited a film and a script like this for years.  In Maggie, she comes of age.  In Maggie's life, the constant is the memory of her father, perhaps the only person who has ever been kind to her before.  Eastwood, as grizzled trainer Frankie, is less than kind, but grudgingly agrees to train her at the behest of his sidekick, Eddie (Morgan Freeman) a jack of all trades at Frankie's run down gym.Eddie's got a secret - he knows Frankie won't put his fighters in jeopardy, and he helps the hungriest of them leave to take risks at catching a title fight.  But Maggie, for whom Frankie has become the surrogate father (she's been missing since his death), refuses to leave the man who has given her the reason to go on.  She's a remarkable fighter, tough and needy, with skills sharpened by Frankie's tutelage, and, against all odds, she succeeds.  Maggie's inevitable downfall is caused by a world-class opponent, with few cares about how she takes Maggie out.  Indeed, although Eastwood pinpoints his focus to his three main characters, with only bit parts on the periphery, take note of Lucia Rijker, as Billie, the Blue Bear.  She plays her role with terrifying lust and need to win at all costs.  (She scared the hxxx out of me at the theater!)During Maggie's rise, perhaps the most touching aspect of the movie is the hook by Frankie in nicknaming her with a Gaelic phrase, one that makes every man and woman jack in each and every audience a fan.  Maggie never knows, until a particularly moving scene between Swank and Eastwood later on, just what it means.  And what it conveys is his love for her, his young fighter.  It's a love that he might have had for his own daughter, but in an intriguing aside, Eastwood gives us a shadow of Frankie's own personal tragedy involving his estrangement from that daughter, and his ongoing battle with his religious beliefs as to why it occurred.Freeman is a constant.  He was better in ""Shawshank"" and ""Glory"" than he is here...his contribution here is best in his narration.  Winning the Oscar for ""Million"" is an award for his fabulous body of filmwork, not just this one performance.  Eastwood, as Frankie, is spare and believable.  He throws all of what he has into the making of the film, but still leaves enough of himself on the table to weave intricately with the center performance of Swank.  The filming, costumes, music are all angular and supportive of the drama enacted in center stage; they are essential to the story, they do not detract.  And the twist of the film, after Maggie is injured, is a true to life drama that is played out on small stages all across this great land of ours.

633401,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JNP1,"Maine Writer ""David""","[8, 18]","I saw Million Dollar Baby without knowing much about it -- other than it involved an aging fight trainer and his young protege.  That ain't the half of it, but I digress.You've heard this before: the story in Million Dollar Baby isn't terribly original. But how many of life's highlights and tragedies are?  Eastwood, who stars and directs, is trying to capture a slice of real life, and chances are that anyone who has lived a little bit will connect to the ordinary and extraordinary elements of this story.  So, it isn't that the story is old and chewed up, it's more about the universality of the human experience -- which is something that certainly could stand a lot more chewing.The weakest part of the movie, I think, is Clint Eastwood's acting.  I may be swimming against the current, but Eastwood's performance was thin and undercut the entire enterprise.  He just didn't sell me as the Gaelic-reading, mild-mannered, crotchety trainer who doesn't like taking risks.  I know the whole movie is Eastwood's ""baby,"" but this casting mistake turns what could have been a glorious film into a decent one.Hillary Swank, in contrast, was perfectly cast, and maybe because the role hit so close to home.  Both she and her character had tough, trailer park beginnings, both overcame great obstacles, and both probably feel a little out of place in what passes for ""culture"" among the well-to-do.  She hits the quiet determination, optimism, and passion quotients just right.  It's hard not to see her as a life force, an indomitable survivor who has good instincts about right and wrong, and has just the right sprinkling of selflessness.  (Okay, at times she seems too good to be true, but I'll forgive her that given the dramatic final encounter with her hillbilly family.  Haven't we all experienced parts of that ""scene"" before?)Morgan Freeman does a great job with a weakly scripted character.  Sure, we've met guys like him -- wise, balanced, and skipping through life in a lowly job (he's an ex-fighter who is the janitor at Eastwood's gym).  But we don't see the counterpoint, the internal struggle, that animates him, that shows us he isn't this perfect, angelic figure narrating his way through life.  One can't help but compare Freeman's performance (and narration) in Million Dollar Baby to his similar role in The Shawshank Redemption.  On every level, it falls short -- sometimes by a little, often by a lot.  Eastwood's use of Freeman has, perhaps unfortunately, made such comparisons almost inevitable.The movie centers around a seminal event, and there are real pacing problems before it as well as afterwards.  No matter, it can't help but move you in its rather slow, methodical way.  We don't always need films to move forward at a blistering pace.The movie's ending -- poignant as it is -- was made ineffective in large part because of Eastwood's character and his performance.  There simply wasn't enough uncontrived humanity in it. It came close at times, like in the car ride back from a visit to Swank's family, but ultimately fizzled.",3,Solid film ... but certainly not great.,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,3061,"['saw', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'knowing', 'much', 'other', 'involved', 'aging', 'fight', 'trainer', 'young', 'protege', 'ai', ""n't"", 'half', 'digress.You', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'story', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'how', 'many', 'life', 'highlights', 'tragedies', 'are', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'directs', 'trying', 'capture', 'slice', 'real', 'life', 'chances', 'are', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'little', 'bit', 'will', 'connect', 'ordinary', 'extraordinary', 'elements', 'story', 'So', ""n't"", 'story', 'old', 'chewed', 'up', 'more', 'universality', 'human', 'experience', 'something', 'certainly', 'could', 'stand', 'lot', 'more', 'chewing.The', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'think', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'swimming', 'current', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'was', 'thin', 'undercut', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Gaelic-reading', 'mild-mannered', 'crotchety', 'trainer', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'taking', 'risks', 'know', 'whole', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'baby', 'casting', 'mistake', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'glorious', 'film', 'decent', 'one.Hillary', 'Swank', 'contrast', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'maybe', 'role', 'hit', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'character', 'had', 'tough', 'park', 'beginnings', 'overcame', 'great', 'obstacles', 'probably', 'feel', 'little', 'place', 'what', 'culture', 'well-to-do', 'quiet', 'determination', 'optimism', 'passion', 'quotients', 'just', 'right', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'life', 'force', 'indomitable', 'survivor', 'who', 'good', 'instincts', 'right', 'wrong', 'just', 'right', 'sprinkling', 'selflessness', 'Okay', 'times', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'given', 'dramatic', 'final', 'encounter', 'hillbilly', 'family', 'Have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'parts', 'scene', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'great', 'job', 'weakly', 'scripted', 'character', 'Sure', ""'ve"", 'met', 'guys', 'wise', 'balanced', 'skipping', 'life', 'lowly', 'job', 'ex-fighter', 'who', 'janitor', 'Eastwood', 'gym', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'counterpoint', 'internal', 'struggle', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'angelic', 'figure', 'narrating', 'way', 'life', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'Freeman', 'performance', 'narration', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'similar', 'role', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'level', 'short', 'sometimes', 'little', 'often', 'lot', 'Eastwood', 'use', 'Freeman', 'perhaps', 'unfortunately', 'made', 'such', 'comparisons', 'almost', 'inevitable.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'seminal', 'event', 'are', 'real', 'pacing', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'afterwards', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'move', 'rather', 'slow', 'methodical', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'need', 'films', 'move', 'forward', 'blistering', 'pace.The', 'movie', 'ending', 'poignant', 'was', 'made', 'ineffective', 'large', 'part', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'performance', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'uncontrived', 'humanity', 'came', 'close', 'times', 'car', 'ride', 'back', 'visit', 'Swank', 'family', 'ultimately', 'fizzled']",N/A

633403,AZTDHDUTVOSCC,B00005JNP1,"mallard ""calvin""","[9, 13]","Eastwood's unadorned 'Baby' is a cinematic masterpiece""Million Dollar Baby"" arrives like an Olympian returning from the Games in a ticker-tape parade, draped in gold medals: seven Oscar nominations, two Golden Globes, countless awards from critics associations, and a place at the top of most top 10 lists.It's almost too much for such a modest movie to bear. Which is not to say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is undeserving of the praise: It is one of three bona fide masterpieces Clint Eastwood has made, along with ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River.""But it is so unadorned, so beautifully spare and old-fashioned in its storytelling, it deserves to be seen without hype and without expectations. Ideally, you would come across it by accident, late at night on a cable movie channel. That way, it could work its deceptive power, lulling you into thinking you're watching a small, straightforward boxing movie, when in fact you're watching a movie that quietly and movingly takes on all the Big Themes: life, death, family, love, faith, and what we owe to the people we love.It tells a story we think we've seen before, countless times: A scrappy young fighter shows up in the gym of a cynical, over-the-hill trainer, asking for a chance to be a contender. Yeah, yeah.Except this boxer is a woman, and at 31 she's not all that young. The trainer tells her she's too old, and anyway, he doesn't work with ""girlies.""But Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) won't be dissuaded. She's paid for a membership to the Hit Pit, and she keeps showing up, day after day, working the heavy bag by herself in the corner. The gym manager, an old, one-eyed fighter named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), takes a shine to her and talks the cynical trainer, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), into taking her on.She's got something, Scrap says - and here is where the movie takes its first turn by acknowledging its boxing-movie stereotypes and cliches. Yeah, Frankie growls back, ""But heart isn't enough.""Don't let the growl fool you. Maggie sure doesn't. As it turns out, heart - that hardy bromide not only of sports movies but of showbiz movies - is the subject of this unassuming movie, and Eastwood takes his time examining the ones belonging to Scrap, Maggie and Frankie.Maggie, as Scrap tells us in his quiet, melancholy narration, is a hillbilly who ""always knew she was trash."" She's determined to escape her past through boxing, though the movie - which guards its secrets and leaves a lot unexplained - never reveals how she took up the sport. It just shows us her oddly polite ferocity, her childish delight in hitting people and knocking them down.Eastwood gallops through a series of her fights as she aims for the championship, and what's striking about Swank's fine performance is how much she tells us about Maggie through her boxing. There's no rage there: Swank, bulked up and buzzing with a joyful energy, locates in Maggie the same inarticulate desire for acceptance that she found in Teena Brandon in ""Boys Don't Cry.""At 74, Eastwood has honed his own performances to an almost Zen stillness: He embodies the less-is-more aesthetic, offsetting the big emotions of the script with his quiet gruffness. He has secrets, too - he has an estranged daughter, he goes to Mass every day only to quiz the priest with theological impertinence, he reads Yeats and studies Gaelic - and they have made him wary of connecting.The mellow Freeman (so memorable opposite Eastwood in ""Unforgiven"") is his perfect partner, coming in like a sax player in a jazz trio to add a mournful counterpoint to the main themes played by Eastwood and Swank.

And as is mentioned in another review, Oscars were won by Clint Eastwood for Direction, Morgan Freeman for best performance by a Supporting Actor, Hilary Swank for best performance by a leading actress and Best Picture. But this movie should be watched because it is very well made. And should help the Woman's Boxing Federation gain the respect they deserve.Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn an overcautious boxing trainer who knows how to train champions. Morgan Freeman plays his friend Scrap who is an ex-boxer who lost use of his eye in his final fight. Of course Frankie Dunn blames himself for this injury and is one of the reasons we learn he is so cautious with his fighters. And of course Hilary Swank plays Maggie, a very hungry fighter who has been self-training for years and has won some fights. She wants Frankie to train her and of course he wants nothing to do with here. For some reason we never learn, Frankie daughter wants nothing to do with him and all the letters he writes to her are returned unopened.The movie builds from there with Maggie earning Frankie support with the helping hand of Scrape. And we watch as her training progresses and career starts. The training and fighting is very real. The acting is superb, as is the story. It is not your normal movie of today were you can figure out exactly what will happen. It takes some twist and turns along the way throwing you surprises as movies use too.

633406,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JNP1,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","Clint Eastwood had already convinced me that he knew how to direct a movie. ""Unforgiven"" stands at the Pinnacle of Westerns and, good as it is, didn't surprise us that much. After all he must have learned a thing or two about making Westerns in all those earlier films. ""Mystic River"" was astonishingly good - and probably he learned something about police procedural movies from those Dirty Harry films. (Although Mystic River reaches levels of emotional complexity never attempted by the Harry movies.)In Million Dollar Baby Clint scores again. Everything about the film is set up to make you think this is a film about boxing, and as a boxing movie it's better than all the Rocky movies put together - even the one that won the Oscar. But in the final act ""Baby"" becomes another movie, and to say any more about the last 30 minutes of the film would be to say too much. (Although you wouldn't have to look hard to discover the controversy involved.)Eastwood directs himself and gives one of his best screen performances as Frankie Dunn, a lonely old man who runs a boxing gym and knows how to train fighters. But he's also afraid to put his fighters into a position where they could be hurt - perhaps going back decades to an incident where his friend Eddie ""Scrap"" Dupris fought one fight, or at least a couple of rounds, too many and lost an eye. Scrap is played by Morgan Freeman in one of those performances that you can't imagine anyone else in. You have to believe that he loves that gym and loves Frankie and loves the boxers who go there to train. His boxing career left him capable of not much more than sweeping the floors at the gym, but as in ""Shawshank Redemption"" Freeman's character serves as both an importance character, and as the story's narrator, filling us in on the heart and soul of the other characters.Hilary Swank earned her Academy Award as Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor white trash girl who left her dysfunctional trailer-park family behind in Missouri and headed out west to make her way. She has already discovered that she has a little ability, and she knows she has the heart. But she has not trained properly and she just knows that Frankie will be able to help her. But Frankie tells her gruffly a half-dozen different times that he doesn't train girls. Since she is persistent and keeps coming to the gym, he has to become increasingly cruel in his dismissals. The transition between the first and second acts of the film is a remarkable scene where Swank and Eastwood stand toe to toe. She is as determined as ever to become the best fighter she can - he is equally stubborn that women shouldn't even BE fighters. But she bares her soul to him - telling him about the welfare cheating family she left behind to come out west to make it, and Eastwood's Frankie gives in a little. He tells Maggie that he'll train her, but once she's ready to actually fight she'll have to find her own manager.The movie is full of realistic and wonderful touches as we see little morality plays involving unscrupulous managers, cheating fighters, boxers with plenty of skill and no heart and the opposite. Some of the most delicious moments involve Eastwood and Freeman about the most mundane things. I'd be glad to watch the whole movie again just for the conversation they have about Freeman's socks.It's wonderful.",5,Another Masterpiece from Eastwood,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,3334,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'already', 'convinced', 'knew', 'how', 'direct', 'movie', 'Unforgiven', 'Pinnacle', 'Westerns', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'learned', 'thing', 'two', 'making', 'Westerns', 'earlier', 'films', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'probably', 'learned', 'something', 'police', 'procedural', 'movies', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'films', 'Mystic', 'River', 'levels', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'never', 'attempted', 'Harry', 'movies', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Clint', 'again', 'Everything', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'make', 'think', 'film', 'boxing', 'boxing', 'movie', 'better', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'put', 'together', 'even', 'one', 'won', 'Oscar', 'final', 'act', 'Baby', 'movie', 'say', 'more', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'hard', 'discover', 'controversy', 'involved', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'best', 'screen', 'performances', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'boxing', 'gym', 'how', 'train', 'fighters', 'also', 'afraid', 'put', 'fighters', 'position', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'hurt', 'perhaps', 'going', 'back', 'decades', 'incident', 'where', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'Scrap', 'Dupris', 'fought', 'one', 'fight', 'least', 'couple', 'rounds', 'too', 'many', 'lost', 'eye', 'Scrap', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'believe', 'gym', 'Frankie', 'boxers', 'who', 'go', 'there', 'train', 'boxing', 'career', 'left', 'capable', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'sweeping', 'floors', 'gym', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Freeman', 'character', 'importance', 'character', 'story', 'narrator', 'filling', 'heart', 'soul', 'other', 'characters.Hilary', 'Swank', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'poor', 'white', 'trash', 'girl', 'who', 'left', 'dysfunctional', 'trailer-park', 'family', 'Missouri', 'headed', 'out', 'west', 'make', 'way', 'already', 'discovered', 'little', 'ability', 'heart', 'not', 'trained', 'properly', 'just', 'Frankie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'Frankie', 'gruffly', 'half-dozen', 'different', 'times', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'persistent', 'coming', 'gym', 'become', 'increasingly', 'cruel', 'dismissals', 'transition', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'film', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'where', 'Swank', 'Eastwood', 'stand', 'toe', 'toe', 'as', 'determined', 'ever', 'become', 'best', 'fighter', 'can', 'equally', 'stubborn', 'women', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'BE', 'fighters', 'soul', 'telling', 'welfare', 'cheating', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'come', 'out', 'west', 'make', 'Eastwood', 'Frankie', 'little', 'Maggie', ""'ll"", 'train', 'once', 'ready', 'actually', 'fight', ""'ll"", 'have', 'find', 'own', 'manager.The', 'movie', 'full', 'realistic', 'wonderful', 'touches', 'see', 'little', 'morality', 'involving', 'unscrupulous', 'managers', 'cheating', 'fighters', 'boxers', 'plenty', 'skill', 'heart', 'opposite', 'most', 'delicious', 'moments', 'involve', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'most', 'mundane', 'things', ""'d"", 'be', 'glad', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'again', 'just', 'conversation', 'have', 'Freeman', 'socks.It', 'wonderful']",N/A

To wit: Black fighter is ungrateful to his white ""benefactor"", black punk bullies inept white hick, brutal black female fighter sucker punches white heroine, dumb Hispanic corner man places stool in corner so that white heroine can hit her head on it. Not even the Morgan Freeman character escapes unscathed; He is eventually blamed for Swank's tragicfall because he had the foolishness to supported her dream at the start--and then declined to be at the climactic fight, which obliged Eastwood to employ the dumb Hispanic man who inadvertently was responsible for the white heroine's demise.All of the negative characters are minority; the white hick, who unhesitatingly employs the ""N"" word, is turned into a sympathetic sop, and the presence of the heroine's family is clearly merely a tool to provide the image for the viewer that Eastwood's trainer is her only true ""family.""Like ""Mystic River"" this film is marred by certain images emanating from Eastwood's right-wing politics, and that bitter aftertaste is the only thing that lingers with me long after the fade to black.",3,Eastwood's politics  lingers after the fade,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,1634,"['film', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'vigilante-murder', 'innocent', 'man', 'need', 'not', 'trouble', 'viewer', 'overmuch', 'so', 'long', 'killer', 'motive', 'understandable', 'Concepts', 'such', 'rational', 'discrimination', 'big', 'conservative', 'circles', 'justify', 'bigotry', 'are', 'suggested', 'here', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'well.While', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'engrossing', 'low-key', 'fashion', 'Aviator', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'more', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'certain', 'disturbing', 'element', 'racial', 'stereotyping', 'wit', 'Black', 'fighter', 'ungrateful', 'white', 'benefactor', 'black', 'punk', 'bullies', 'white', 'hick', 'brutal', 'black', 'female', 'fighter', 'sucker', 'white', 'heroine', 'dumb', 'Hispanic', 'corner', 'man', 'stool', 'corner', 'white', 'heroine', 'can', 'hit', 'head', 'Not', 'even', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'escapes', 'unscathed', 'eventually', 'blamed', 'Swank', 'tragicfall', 'had', 'foolishness', 'supported', 'dream', 'start', 'then', 'declined', 'be', 'climactic', 'fight', 'obliged', 'Eastwood', 'employ', 'dumb', 'Hispanic', 'man', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'was', 'responsible', 'white', 'heroine', 'demise.All', 'negative', 'characters', 'are', 'minority', 'white', 'hick', 'who', 'unhesitatingly', 'N', 'word', 'turned', 'sympathetic', 'sop', 'presence', 'heroine', 'family', 'clearly', 'merely', 'tool', 'provide', 'image', 'viewer', 'Eastwood', 'trainer', 'only', 'true', 'family', 'Mystic', 'River', 'film', 'marred', 'certain', 'images', 'emanating', 'Eastwood', 'right-wing', 'politics', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'only', 'thing', 'long', 'fade', 'black']",N/A

He won the Oscar for his directing, but is equally fine playing Frankie, a trainer who runs a seedy gym in Los Angeles and reads poetry on the side. Hilary Swank is absolutely phenomenal in her second Oscar winning role as Maggie, a lost soul who has been waitressing since she was 13 and sees boxing as the one way she can escape waitressing for the rest of her life. Morgan Freemon is terrific in another Oscar winning role as Scrap, our narrator, who was managed by Frankie into a title bout. Now he lives in a room at the gym and is Frankie's partner in conversations that have coiled down through the decades. When Frankie refuses to train a ""girly,"" it's Scrap who convinces him to give Maggie a chance: ""She grew up knowing one thing.

The story becomes one of Christ's parables of the Good Samaritan or the Kingdom of Heaven.  And there is a Christ figure.

633412,ARF5OI5V9OI00,B00005JNP1,Max A. Lebow,"[0, 8]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM, DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO HELP PEOPLE DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO PURCHASE THE DVD, OR SEE THE FILM AGAIN.By Alfred Hitchcock's standards (very high standards indeed), Clint Eastwood turns in a superb performance in ""Million Dollar Baby."" Hitchcock used to say that a great film actor is someone ""who can do nothing, very well.""When a letter arrives at home for Frankie (Eastwood), he shows, without doing much, that it is bad news.  He picks up this letter with some trepidation, enters his home, opens a closet, and takes down a box.  We see that the box is full of letters.The narrator (Freeman) tells us that all these letters have come back, unopened, from Frankie's daughter, that all are marked ""Return to Sender"" or ""Addressee Unknown."" Clearly, she is ignoring him. Eastwood shows his pain, with few facial expressions, by the way he handles the box, and how he places the letter in it -- all without a word.It is moving scene, but one wonders why director Eastwood places the letter into the middle of the box, rather than at the back or front.  Surely this is the latest letter.  To me, it would make more sense to put the latest letter before the others, or after them.  See it once, you'll never notice. But see it again, and you will notice.Frankie is a daily church-goer.  This may seem unusual, but was written into the script after the screen writer met the author of the short story on which the film is based, F.X. Toole, and discovered that the late F.X. Toole attended church daily.The priest regularly asks Frankie if he writes to his daughter. He says, ""Yes,"" or ""Every Week."" Then Frankie usually tries the young, and callow, priest's patience. The priest, by the way, is a character actor who does nothing, but not very well.Scrap (Freeman) surreptitiously coaches Maggie (Swank) to hit the heavy bag while it is moving away from her, to imagine it is a man, to think of how to keep her balance while making her opponent lose hers. Less than twenty seconds later Maggie hits the bag while it is swinging toward her.Later, Scrap tells Maggie that Frankie has never said anything about wanting to stop Scrap's last fight in order to save Scrap's eye. Scrap says he just knows this. Less than twenty minutes before, Frankie as expressed to Scrap, the deepest remorse for not stopping Scrap's last fight in order to save his eye.SPOLER ALERT!!The scenes Maggie plays as a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down, go on too long. They undermine the considerable empathy Maggie has built with the audience to that point. The few moments in a montage showing Frankie, waiting patiently, reading silently to himself, hovering at Maggie's bedside late into the night, evoke much more than those longer scenes in which Maggie tries to commit suicide by biting her tongue and almost bleeds to death, in which her family coaxes her to make her mark on a contract in which she gives up her rights and her money to them, in which we are shown her bed sores, or the gangrene on her leg, and those scenes in which she just lies there and trades hushed, moderately well-written dialog with Frankie. Much of this material, while poignant the first time, is too pedestrian and explicit to stand up well to repeat viewing.These small glitches are probably the result of Eastwood's decision to shoot Paul Haggis' first draft.For a happier ending try ""Cinderella Man."" The boxing is just as good, and you will learn a lot you did not know about the great depression, without getting depressed.Some of the dialog in ""Million Dollar Baby"" is terse, telling, and unobtrusively beautiful. For example, Scrap tells Frankie that people die every day thinking they never got their shot. It is a short speech, but worthy of the line of poetry about people leading lives of quiet desperation. It should remain in the living language for quite some time. For no reason in particular, this brief scene reminds me also of the captain's eulogy in Master and Commander in which Russell Crowe eulogizes a past-his-prime, low-ranking officer who has committed suicide. Sometimes, says the captain, we do not become the people we wanted to be.Like other bits of tight,well-thought-out aphorism that have found their way into the narration, these are lifted verbatim from two short stories of F.X. Toole (a pen name). Toole received much notoriety at the age of 70 with the publication of his debut book, a collection of short stories, ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner,"" from two of which the screenplay drew. He died on September 12, 2002, in Torrance, California of complications resulting from heart surgery. He was 72-years-old and had recently completed his first novel. His real name was Jerry Boyd.  He took the pen name to separate his writing from his boxing. He did not live to see the film crew begin shooting.""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" is dedicated to Dub Huntley, the man who introduced Boyd to boxing, and many of the characters and events related in the book are from Dub Huntley's life and experience. Huntley trained Boyd to box and to be a corner man, starting when Boyd was in his early 40's. Huntley and Boyd became close friends during the decades they worked together. Eventually, Boyd began writing again, but kept it a secret in the boxing world by using a pen name he fashioned from the names Francis Xavier and Peter O'Toole.For years after giving up his role as a boxer, Boyd acted as a cut man and assistant trainer to Huntley. In that role, Boyd worked with female professional boxer, Juli Crockett. Huntley later told Sports Illustrated that Crockett was the basis for the character of Maggie Fitzgerald in ""Million Dollar Baby.""Juli Crockett, was born in Enterprise, Alabama, in 1975. In her first professional bout, she knocked out her opponent 70 seconds into the first round. Maggie also scores a quick knockout in her first fight. Crockett retired from professional boxing, undefeated, when she was still under 30.Also a writer and director, Crockett is the daughter of writers Linda Crockett and Daniel Savage Gray. She earned a BFA in acting from The Tisch School in New York, and an MFA in directing from the California Institute of the Arts.Boyd's first sale -- a short story about a cut man who seeks revenge on a scheming boxer -- did not come until 1999. He sold it to Zyzzyva, a small San Francisco literary journal he picked out of ""Writer's Market,"" a directory of publications seeking material. He told Terri Gross on NPR that when the editor called, ""For the first time in my life I used the word `flabbergasted.'""Boyd surprised the regulars at the L.A. Boxing Club when ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" was published by Ecco Press, an imprint of Harper Collins, in 2000.  They had no idea Boyd was a writer.Boyd was a genuine tough-guy who once had part of his right ear bitten off during a fight with a thief who had been robbing his British sports car. As a writer, Boyd/Toole, kept on writing with only a few breaks through forty years of rejection slips. He wrote short stories, novels, plays and screenplays.For a brief periods Boyd would give up writing. He told Terri Gross on Fresh Air (NPR, from WHYY, Philadelphia), ""I decided I wasn't going to hurt like that any more."" A broken nose, he asserted, was easier to take than another brown envelope, returning another rejected manuscript. He always came back.""I'd say ... I don't have any talent. I'm not going to do it anymore,"" he told the San Francisco Chronicle after ""Rope Burns"" was published.After having known and worked closely with Boyd for decades, Huntley could not recall Boyd's ever having mentioned that he was also a writer. ""Jerry is a guy, I don't care what would happen--he could have made a million dollars with that book -- and he'd still be the same Jerry,"" Huntley said.At the time of his death, Boyd was in the final stages of preparing the manuscript of his boxing novel, ""Pound for Pound,"" which is set on the Texas-Mexico border.In February, 2005, Harper Perennial re-titled ""Rope Burns"" as ""Million Dollar Baby: Stories from the Corner."" It is available in paperback from Amazon. Early in 2006, Harper Collins published ""Pound for Pound: A Novel"".There are really only three characters in this film. Freeman, as Scrap, doubles as the narrator. He has better-written material to narrate here than he had in ""March of the Penguins,"" which he also narrated. Whenever he narrates, his voice brings authority, precision, and penetration to each and every word.Eastwood, as Frankie, doubles as director, and writes much of the haunting score.SPOILER ALERT!! FINAL WARNING!Swank, as Maggie, is not quite as well-drawn as the heroine of ""Girl Fight,"" but she, like Eastwood, brings pathos to many scenes that require ""doing nothing, very well."" She reaches the peaks of performance she attained in ""Boys Don't Cry."" After that film and this one, there might be concern she might be typecast as a ""manly-girl."" That kind of typecasting would be unfair, in my view.Frankie begs the priest understand his dilemma. The priest pontificates while Frankie shows, again without doing much, that he is becoming more and more desperate. After a few minutes, the priest calmly stands up and walks away, leaving Frankie alone. The audience empathizes with Frankie when he sheds his restrained tears.In the end, this is an old story. Frankie is ready, finally, to kill the girl he has trained, who is about the same age as his daughter, the girl he has learned to respect, and trust, and care about, the girl who almost became a champion while he was still her manager and trainer.  She has suffered enough. The old story of Abraham preparing to kill his only son, Isaac, because God told him to, seems relevant here. Do you kill the person you love most? Is the line between love and euthanasia so thin?These are questions no one can answer satisfactorily. No matter how many films are made, no matter how many sermons are preached, no matter how much advice is lovingly given, we remain, each of us, alone with these questions.Watching this film, attentively, once, helps. Don't watch it again.Bonus FeaturesMaggie shares some background with the real boxer, Lucia Rijker, who plays Maggie's dirty-fighting nemesis in her final fight. They both spent their childhoods poverty. Lucia's mother was ungrateful whenever her daughter brought home something she had bought with her fight money -- a sofa, for example. In the documentary on DVD, ""Born to Fight,"" Rijker says she always wanted to buy her mother a decent house, as Maggie does in the film.Like ""Danger,"" Rijker tells us, she was put in the ring by an irresponsible fighter. At first she succeeded, but then she was beaten to pulp and had to be rescued, like ""Danger,"" from her professional assailant. ""Danger"" is played by Jay Baruchel. It is a role that does not seem to fit the film, until you realize that the gym is populated with misfits, far from the main stream, of whom ""Danger,"" an orphan with nowhere else to go, is simply an extreme example.In ""Producers Round 15 ,"" Albert S. Ruddy, who also produced ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" for CBS, discloses that he used writer Paul Haggis there, and so, when Haggis called him, asking for the opportunity to write the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Ruddy said, ""Yes.""Haggis had been tracking the short story for awhile, hoping to write the screenplay and direct. Haggis was surprised to find that the author of the story, F.X. Toole, had, in addition to a background as a boxer and cut man, experience as a bullfighter (In the 1950's he was gored three times.), and looked more like a poet than a prize-fighter.Co-Producer, Tom Rosenberg, tells us he had a connection to Swank and knew enough of her background to be sure she would bring authenticity to the role of Maggie, the poor girl struggling to overcome poverty.Rosenberg connected with the short story because he had worked as a lawyer in a small town in the rural south, not far from where the Maggie's family was set.The round-table with Inside The Actor's Studio host, Robert Lipton brings a lot out of Morgan Freeman that nobody knows. Eastwood is more guarded. Swank says almost nothing, except that her mother took her to Hollywood when she was fifteen years old, and struggled mightily to promote her daughter's career, despite their poverty.The bonus features are worth watching. They reveal many obscure facts about the movie, the stories on which it was based, the cast, and the writers.Do the bonus features make the DVD worth owning?

633413,A2BOXYJTA14TTL,B00005JNP1,"M. Best ""Zackariah""","[1, 1]","Eastwood is the best there is whether he is acting in a film, or directing it.  He has so many great movies that I have to think of his body of work by the decade, rather than try to rate his material in an overall perspective.  I adore most of his performances, and could write pages about how great movies like &#34;Good, Bad, & Ugly&#34;, &#34;Josey Wales&#34;, &#34;Pale Rider&#34;, and &#34;Unforgiven&#34; among many others.  I love movies about boxing, and constantly watch the all the Rocky movies, and that wonderful &#34;Cinderella Man&#34; show as well.  As I was watching this &#34;Million Dollar Baby&#34; last night for the first time; I thought I had found another one that would be a staple for me in the genre, but as it neared the climax of the show; I realized that it would never be in my library.I love &#34;Gran Torino&#34; & &#34;Curve Ball.&#34;  Those are two wonderful shows that I have already enjoyed multiple times recently.  Clint just is magical, and very clever in his art.  He knows what folks enjoy, and that is intelligent, thoughtful, character-based performances.  Also, he has a great talent that always shows though.  Morgan Freeman is in this, and that man adds enormously to the quality of everything I have ever seen him in!  He is an unique actor.Hilary Shank is great in this movie.  She is very talented, and I can think of no other actor that could have done better than she.  Her part was well casted in my opinion.Many, if not most Eastwood fans might well disagree with me.  I am one of those people that needs the show to end positively.  By that, I mean that I don't necessarily want a lot of &#34;real life&#34; drama in the end.  I have watched &#34;Rocky Balboa&#34; over & over even though the reality of an ageing actor defeating a champion in his twenties is pretty far fetched.

633416,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JNP1,Melissa Niksic,"[5, 6]","Why did it take me so long to see this film?! I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I have to say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" has got to be one of the ten best movies of all time. It's definitely the best thing Clint Eastwood's ever done, and looking at his impressive list of credits, that's saying a lot!I thought that ""Million Dollar Baby"" was going to be Eastwood's interpretation of a female Rocky Balboa flick. Indeed, the film starts out that way. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a gym owner and boxing trainer who just lost his most promising fighter to another manager. Dunn has major relationship issues, both with his fighters and with his family: he has a daughter he hasn't spoken to in years. When an aspiring yet inexperienced female fighter (Hilary Swank) shows up on Frankie's doorstep, he doesn't want anything to do with her...Frankie Dunn doesn't train girls! But Maggie is persistent and with a little help from Eddie (Morgan Freeman), Frankie's friend and training partner, Frankie agrees to bend the rules and teach this girl everything he knows. The trainer and his fighter forge an unlikely father-daughter type bond, and they grow closer as Maggie's career continues to excel. Then tragedy strikes, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" transforms from a boxing movie into one of the most heart-wrenching, character-driven dramas the silver screen has ever seen before.It's easy to see why this film swept the Academy Awards. Swank and Freeman give the performances of their careers. (It was a real shame that Eastwood was snubbed in the Best Actor category...he truly deserved to win.)I don't want to give away any additional details about the movie, but the plot is full of surprises, and the ending is one that you won't expect and might have a hard time dealing with. ""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't the kind of movie I'll want to watch again and again...it takes too much of an emotional toll on you to watch it more than once. However, it is definitely one of the most amazing movies I've seen in recent years, and quite possibly one of the most powerful films in movie history.Eastwood's pictures keep getting better and better...I can't wait for the next one.",5,Million dollar movie,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2177,"['Why', 'did', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'life', 'have', 'say', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'movies', 'time', 'definitely', 'best', 'thing', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'ever', 'done', 'looking', 'impressive', 'list', 'credits', 'saying', 'lot', 'thought', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Eastwood', 'interpretation', 'female', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'flick', 'Indeed', 'film', 'out', 'way', 'Eastwood', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'gym', 'owner', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'most', 'promising', 'fighter', 'manager', 'Dunn', 'major', 'relationship', 'issues', 'fighters', 'family', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'years', 'When', 'aspiring', 'yet', 'inexperienced', 'female', 'fighter', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'up', 'Frankie', 'doorstep', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'Maggie', 'persistent', 'little', 'help', 'Eddie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Frankie', 'friend', 'training', 'partner', 'Frankie', 'bend', 'rules', 'teach', 'girl', 'everything', 'trainer', 'fighter', 'forge', 'unlikely', 'father-daughter', 'type', 'bond', 'grow', 'closer', 'Maggie', 'career', 'excel', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'transforms', 'boxing', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'character-driven', 'dramas', 'silver', 'screen', 'ever', 'seen', 'before.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'swept', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Swank', 'Freeman', 'give', 'performances', 'careers', 'was', 'real', 'shame', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Best', 'Actor', 'category', 'truly', 'deserved', 'win', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'additional', 'details', 'movie', 'plot', 'full', 'surprises', 'ending', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'expect', 'might', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'toll', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'However', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', 'movie', 'history.Eastwood', 'pictures', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one']",N/A

Problem is she has no experience and she's too old. At 31, most professional boxers have been and done the best of their careers. Maggie doesn't care. All she wants to do is box.Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) goes to church every day, reads books to expand his mind and writes his estranged daughter once a week hoping she'll write back. Frankie has never trained a woman before and has no desire to start now.Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) is a retired boxer who has a room in the back of Frankie's gym. He cleans up after the boxers and provides moral support and direction to Frankie who stood by him during his last fight when his manager was off having a good time somewhere else. He thinks Frankie should train Maggie and he loves Maggie's tenacity.Maggie pretty much camps out on Frankie's door step (gym) until he agrees to train her. Their relationship immediately extends beyond that of trainer and trainee to daughter and father figure. These three make up an unlikely but solid family unit.MDB was nothing like what I was expecting. I expected a female Rocky and ended up with an intense emotional drama with the usual specs of humour Eastwood provides. The uplifting quality of watching someone train to be the best they can be is present but not the main focus. Family, love, loss, determination, friendship, loyalty, betrayal are all prominent themes. MDB was wonderfully shot and acted. They deserved the 7 academy nominations and 4 wins they received.

Assisted suicide is a key part of the story  -- one character who, despite his strong Catholic faith, decides to help another character, doomed to life as a quadrapeligic, end her life. I seriously doubt that Clint Eastwood, a lifelong conservative Republican, is making a political statement with Million Dollar Baby. But that didn't stop the right wing, in the person of Michael Medved, in trashing the film's supposed advocacy of assisted suicide. Thankfully voices of sanity like Roger Ebert rose up in defense of the film, rightfully claiming that the film wasn't making a political statement. The character that assists in the suicide does not do so lightly and only arrives at his decision after much self-searching.I'm tired of right wing robots like Michael Medved who yell about liberal bias in the media one moment but then think it's all right to let their own personal extremist conservative agenda color everything they watch on TV or at the movies. Clint Eastwood has made a humane and compassionate film that uses assisted suicide as a plot resolution, not a political statement. To reduce this film, which richly deserved the Best Picture Academy award, to a ""cause film"" is just wrong. I'm sick and tired of Michael Medved's right wing garbage. If you haven't seen Million Dollar Baby, don't let Medved stop you from doing so.

The relationship is a second chance for both, and is the emotional core of the movie.Clint Eastwood has crafted yet another fine movie with ""Million Dollar Baby"".  There is more to it than a first glance would lead you to believe, and even if it is manipulative at times, it is done so well that it is not a detriment.  The trio of actors that are the core of the movie are amazing both alone and together.  The ease with wich Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman interact is so real that you will feel drawn to them, faults and all.  This is a great boxing movie, perhaps the best since the original ""Rocky"", but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is about more than just boxing.  To share more than this would be to spoil a movie that deserves a fresh viewing, but let's just say that the final act of the movie has another focus that is thought provoking.This is a movie that will give you something to think about and debate for long after you leave the theater.

633423,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JNP1,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[10, 43]","Could this be the year? That appears to be the very question on everyone's mind this Oscar season and the answer always depends on who you are asking. Based on the fans of The Aviator, they believe co-heartedly that if the Boston Red Sox could lift their once-ancient curse then there is still hope for Martin Scorsese in the Best Director category. For Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator's only true competition (Sorry Sideways), Clint Eastwood could prove to be back in contention form. Though many critics praised last year's contender, Mystic River, it had nothing on the existential strength that was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But, seeing as how that was the last film in the trilogy, the field for Best Picture is left wide-open, but truthfully only two face a bout-to-bout battle for the prize. Do you feel lucky, punk?Frankie Dunn, quite possibly one of the best boxing trainers in the country, is not the type of person who will ever get close to anyone again, especially after his daughter wants nothing to do with him, returning all of his letters to her, and his champion-in-training abandon him for a chance at the big time. Then one day, a typical white-trash diner waitress named Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym and asks to be trained to fight in the ring. Dunn quickly refuses, stating being ""tough is not enough"". Eventually, after witnessing Maggie's sheer determination in her training, Frankie takes her on based on two conditions - that she listens to everything he says and that she does not ask any questions. Though begrudgingly brought together by fate, the two begin to form a solid father/daughter-like relationship together, each sharing a common bond with one another based on family abandonment lodged in their pasts. This relationship will be tested to its limits by an event none of them ever expected or ever wanted to face. The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure spear-headed propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled - are not all his characters that way - boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name - Paul Giamatti deserved it more - but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clich&eacute;s. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the ""Angel of Death"" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? The parish priest asks Frankie one day after exiting the morning service, ""Why do you bother coming to church?"", or something to that affect. This honestly has to be the most thought provoking question in the entire film after witnessing how he goes against practically every Christian teaching on the subject of valuing the human life in the book, specifically The Bible. Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South - in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical clich&eacute; of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again - if only.Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night, though seeing as how it is not from the imagination of the grand-master himself it may mean little to them. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, ""But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?"" Sure, if your name is Michael Schiavo, master of illusions, willing to romanticize the concept cold-blooded murder in order to knock off your wife and collect on her life insurance  in which to live happily ever after with your mistress and your two children. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together.""But"", they stutter ""should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?"" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may want you to think, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. In spite of how thickheaded the liberal establishment is, this should not be as complex an issue as it has been made out to be. First and foremost, your life does not solely belong to you; it belongs to the creator as well. God created everyone specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know what that will be at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You have neither the privilege nor the authority to dictate when and where you want to die. In spite of what the radical liberals may tell you otherwise, man is not higher up within the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. And secondly, concerning the level of governmental authority over this issue, the 1997 Supreme Court case, Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, in which the nine justices were unanimous in their decision, determined that the United States Constitution did not allow the practice of assisted suicide and declared that it should continue to be outlawed in this country. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Mr. Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the respect for quality of life in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.Believe what you want, but the liberals of this country view the cruel methods of abortion and euthanasia (assisted suicide) as the justifiable means in which to purge themselves of the responsibility they have toward another human life. If that is the direction in which we as a collective national society are heading towards in terms of our moral values then we are all royally screwed, both within this life and the next.",2,The Moose

633428,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JNP1,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 5]","Despite the insistence of some critics that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a notably fresh, surprising and original movie, don't believe it. It's an old-fashioned, five-hanky, melodramatic weeper, basically notable for the way that screenwriter Paul Haggis and director-star Clint Eastwood graft one familiar plot onto another to change the movie's direction, abruptly and  completely, about two-thirds of the way through. (It's no fair to say precisely what they do, or how they do it; but if you know what people generally do in boxing rings, it isn't a particularly surprising plot twist.) But if you've seen both stories before, seldom have you seen either story done with such conviction, polish, and restrained yet powerful emotion. Eastwood, one of Hollywood's smoothest old pros, milks every scene for maximum impact, and gets marvelous chiaroscuro effects out of cinematographer Tom Stern as well as believably grungy, gritty sets from production designer Henry Bumstead. Eastwood's also at the top of his game as an actor here; his scenes with another great old pro, Morgan Freeman, are wonderful to watch, like Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus matching each other shot for shot on the back nine.

But it's unfortunate that it had to be for ""Million Dollar Baby"", a sloppily written and directed film from Clint Eastwood, who can do no wrong in Hollywood these days, even when he makes tripe. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a waitress from the hills of Missouri determined to be a professional boxer, even though she seems to know little about the sport. She buys a 6-month membership to the ""Hit Pit Gym"", owned by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a curmudgeonly veteran trainer and manager who ""doesn't train girls"". Her persistence evokes the sympathy of the gym manager, an elderly ex-boxer named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who points her in the right direction to the extent that Maggie eventually impresses Frankie too.""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't about boxing or winning, and it fails at being a character study, because the characters are drawn with such broad strokes. Frankie, in particular, is a vague man whom we never know much about apart from his being macho and troubled by some guilt or other. Scrap actually tells the story through a solemn voice-over narration, which no one could do better than Morgan Freeman. But the fact that Scrap has to explain the characters to us on an ongoing basis is one of ""Million Dollar Baby""'s many examples of poor writing. Some others are: A simple-minded young character who exists only to demonstrate how tenderhearted Frankie is under the tough exterior and how wise Scrap is as he mops the floors. An old half-blind boxer who hasn't been in the ring in decades knocks out a young, quick athlete -fine in a comedy, but not in a movie that wants to be taken seriously. Maggie's rapid rise to international stardom is preposterous. The last act of the film makes no sense, as Maggie's predicament would easily be resolved without the dramatics by hiring a lawyer.""Million Dollar Baby"" is just a patchwork of contrivances and tired clich&eacute;s designed to evoke the most obvious response. The story isn't credible. The characters barely exist. The fights are dull and unrealistic. The film is too long by a half an hour. I'm a big fan of low-key lighting and lots of shadow, but this cinematography is murky, inappropriate, and just plain bad. ""Million Dollar Baby""'s only memorable quality is that it's a sports film that is decidedly not a feel-good, triumphant exercise. And that leaves very little reason to watch it.

Now that I have seen Million Dollar Baby, I can say that it barely beats that film out and MDB is the Best Film of 2004 in my opinion. The acting from the three leads is mind blowing, with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman having the best chances of winning the Oscar next month. Clint Eastwood is very good as well, but he won't beat out Jamie Foxx or Leonardo DiCaprio in the Best Actor category. I know that Swank will likely win (and she deserves it), but I really hope Morgan Freeman finally wins an Oscar after all these years. How could this guy not have won for the Shawshank Redemption? It seems like everytime he is nominated he is passed over (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory, Shawshank, etc.). Anyways, back to the film. Clint's direction is spot on and even though the film is well over two hours the pace is right were it should be for this kind of film (fast enough to hold your attention, yet slow enough to take in the mood and great performances). The dialogue between the three leads always seems freshly real and my eyes even teared up during a few scenes and that never happens with me. This film and The Aviator will likely take most of the Oscars (hopefully a long overdue Director win for Scorsese) and if you haven't seen these two films I recommend that you do soon.

There is boxing, but that's not the story.  And it does have a lot of high-powered actors in it, which never hurts a movie.Frankie Dunn is a trainer for boxers.  But he only trains boys, not girls.  Which doesn't deter Maggie, a hillbilly girl turned wannabe boxer.  She knows she wants him to train her, that he can help her get places and give her a shot.  She just needs to convince him.  And if she does, she has to prove she's good enough to all those who say she's too old and doesn't have enough training.Characters:Clint Eastwood: Frankie DunnHilary Swank: MaggieMorgan Freeman: Eddie DuprisThere are a lot more actors than the few I just named.  But honestly, they don't really matter that much.  These three are what make the show.  The rest might as well be part of the background and setting.  And they all do a fantastic job.  Hilary as Maggie plays a very good small town girl trying to achieve her dream.  She's down to earth and real and very respectful.  Not to mention I wish I had her muscles.  Eastwood as Frankie is stoic but with a good heart.  He reminds you of a well meaning but cranky grandfather.  And Freeman, well I just like to hear him talk, doesn't matter what role he plays.  So thankfully, in addition to playing Eddie, he's also the narrator of the film.The plot was decent.  It was sort of an underdog story with Maggie, but that part wasn't important.  Could have been any sport, not boxing.  It was more about moral struggles and wanting to achieve a dream and what kind of value life has in different situations.  Big stuff.  But I do think the way the plot was carried out was almost unbelievable.  Sure, horrific coincidences happen, but I can see why the major scene in this movie has been parodied just about everywhere.  It's just that odd.  Still a good movie, but I wish they had found a different way to make the plot go where they wanted it to go.There's no flashy camera work, no special effects to be had in this movie.  Which is ok since its a drama.  There doesn't need to be.  So long as the picture is crisp and the sound good, you have what you need.  There is music, and apparently Eastwood directed it, but I can't say I paid that much attention to it.  Instrumentals mainly, and background music.  I suppose it did add to the sense of drama, but in a very covert way.There's a reason this movie won a bunch of awards.  I'm not saying it's the best film out there, but it's one that will have you paying attention the whole time.  Whether it be for Eastwood's quiet words or because you want to know what happens next.Review by M.

633442,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00005JNP1,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[5, 8]","Clint Eastwood is his latest movies seems to be obtaining status as a director-auteur, much like Hitchcock, Ford, and Howard Hawks, with a consistent thread of tragic story-telling of human lives that transcend their subject matter with ""Unforgiven,"" ""Mystic River,"" and now ""Million Dollar Baby.""  He has put a unique identifying stamp (common to the three films) on all of these movies that seems reflective of the essence of his persona.Million Dollar Baby has powerful and nuanced performances by all the main actors and actresses, Clint Eastwood himself as Octogenarian boxing coach and cut man, Frankie Dunn, Hillary Swank, as pull-herself up by the bootstraps rags to almost riches female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, and lastly but not leastly Morgan Freeman as ex-boxer long-time second and all around good guy gym rat, Eddie Dupris.Though the movie is a powerful tale powerfully told it is not without some areas of diminishing missteps.  This is what I think they are.  The main characters are all multi-dimensional believable people with complex things happening in each of their lives leading them to act out different based on complex motivations.  It is a letdown to see such one-dimensional almost cartoonish stereo-typed characters as Maggie's low-income family.  They are portrayed as lazy money-grubbers attempting to live their lives through free handouts.  The stereotype is moved from the specific case of Maggie's family to the general case of crossover offensive political-policy views of low income families, with comments made by the character Frankie Dunn when he states that public funds that go into public programs such as welfare are mostly wasted.  I'm not sure if this dialogue can be traced back to a screenwriter, F.X. Toole's original short-story ""A Million Dollar Baby,"" or to director Eastwood himself but it reveals an uniformed opinion of public assistance as outdated to the time pre-welfare reform.  When you get opinion passed off in this fashion via mass media, it de-humanizes the actual people behind those stricken with poverty in America.  It's great that Maggie's character and story is ultimately one of hope, that with enough determination, one can rise above the circumstances they were born into whatever those circumstances may be.  However that reinforcing of the American Myth that each and every person has the ability and capability to pull themselves up by the ""bootstraps...or boxing shoe straps as the case may be"" is hooie and bunk and leads people into thinking those that aren't successful in overcoming are at personal fault.The movie also makes some constructive statements on the care of human life in consideration of how we have interpreted the Hippocratic medical oath in America.  It's gives the non-Kervokians out there cause to pause and reflect on underlying competing beliefs on the value of preserving human life versus preserving the quality of human life.All this in a little film about boxing...way to go Eastwood and Swank...you've brought a powerful story to life.--MMW",4,Not quite the Cat's Meow...but a good one-two punch!!,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,3047,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'latest', 'movies', 'be', 'obtaining', 'status', 'director-auteur', 'much', 'Hitchcock', 'Ford', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'consistent', 'thread', 'tragic', 'story-telling', 'human', 'lives', 'transcend', 'subject', 'matter', 'Unforgiven', 'Mystic', 'River', 'now', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'put', 'unique', 'identifying', 'stamp', 'common', 'three', 'films', 'movies', 'reflective', 'essence', 'persona.Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'powerful', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'main', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Octogenarian', 'boxing', 'coach', 'cut', 'man', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'pull-herself', 'bootstraps', 'rags', 'almost', 'riches', 'female', 'boxer', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'lastly', 'not', 'leastly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ex-boxer', 'long-time', 'second', 'around', 'good', 'guy', 'gym', 'rat', 'Eddie', 'Dupris.Though', 'movie', 'powerful', 'tale', 'powerfully', 'told', 'not', 'areas', 'diminishing', 'missteps', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'multi-dimensional', 'believable', 'people', 'complex', 'things', 'happening', 'lives', 'leading', 'act', 'out', 'different', 'based', 'complex', 'motivations', 'letdown', 'see', 'such', 'one-dimensional', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'stereo-typed', 'characters', 'Maggie', 'low-income', 'family', 'are', 'portrayed', 'lazy', 'money-grubbers', 'attempting', 'live', 'lives', 'free', 'handouts', 'stereotype', 'moved', 'specific', 'case', 'Maggie', 'family', 'general', 'case', 'crossover', 'offensive', 'political-policy', 'views', 'low', 'income', 'families', 'comments', 'made', 'character', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'when', 'public', 'funds', 'go', 'public', 'programs', 'such', 'welfare', 'are', 'mostly', 'wasted', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'screenwriter', 'F.X', 'Toole', 'original', 'short-story', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'uniformed', 'opinion', 'public', 'assistance', 'outdated', 'time', 'pre-welfare', 'reform', 'When', 'get', 'opinion', 'passed', 'off', 'fashion', 'mass', 'media', 'actual', 'people', 'stricken', 'poverty', 'America', 'great', 'Maggie', 'character', 'story', 'ultimately', 'one', 'hope', 'enough', 'determination', 'one', 'can', 'rise', 'circumstances', 'were', 'born', 'circumstances', 'may', 'be', 'However', 'reinforcing', 'American', 'Myth', 'person', 'ability', 'capability', 'pull', 'up', 'bootstraps', 'boxing', 'shoe', 'straps', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'hooie', 'bunk', 'people', 'thinking', 'are', ""n't"", 'successful', 'overcoming', 'are', 'personal', 'fault.The', 'movie', 'also', 'constructive', 'statements', 'care', 'human', 'life', 'consideration', 'how', 'have', 'interpreted', 'Hippocratic', 'medical', 'oath', 'America', 'non-Kervokians', 'there', 'cause', 'pause', 'reflect', 'underlying', 'competing', 'beliefs', 'value', 'preserving', 'human', 'life', 'versus', 'preserving', 'quality', 'human', 'life.All', 'little', 'film', 'boxing', 'way', 'go', 'Eastwood', 'Swank', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'powerful', 'story', 'life.', 'MMW']",N/A

(As poinless as it may be) And two:  It has a female in a role usually reserved for men.  Oscar time!Because it's shot in a slick style, people get in line with how ""well  done"" it is and start parroting the raves. But MDB is really an awful movie in many ways.Calling MDB a hackneyed boxing film is an insult to hackneyed boxing films.  There are simply too many technical errors to ignore. (such as a fighter who ends a fight by hitting her opponent on the back of the head while she's walking back to her corner and WINS!)  Some gaps may the fault of bad editing,( and there are plenty.) Eastwood  reverts to his bad acting days in a role which never seems quite comfortable for him.  Freeman is always good and Swank is fine but the pace is clumsy and the characters are one dimensional so I never felt engagmed with their story.  The fight scenes are ridiculous and have no drama.  Magies family is introduced immediately as cartoonish sterotypes so the attempt at pathos is never developed.  There are actually a few moments that are outright laughable, i.e. the way her opponents fall when hit -- more like stunt women from central casting than boxers.  The scene where Eastwood becomes engaged in a fight from the audience and starts throwing punches was embarassing  as was the overly mawkish bit when when the mother puts the pen in Swanks mouth.  But nothing -- nothing -- is more offensive than the pointlessly maudlin third act that is drawn out for what seems to be hours. There is no redemption at all.  This fighter, who we're supposed to believe is so tough,  becomes a quitter. Oh, and one more...(if you still want to see the flick, stop here, I'm going to give away the ending).  When he performs the euthenasia, why does he remove the air,  THEN give her the shot?!?!?  That reminds me of the joke where the guy finds his wife has been unfaithful and he says to her : ""I'm going to take this gun and blow my brains out, and then I'm going to use it on you!""

633450,A12FLZREV32JOP,B00005JNP1,Noelle Eiram,"[0, 2]","Clint Eastwood's `Million Dollar Baby' is about a gruff, macho boxing trainer who trains an enthusiastic young woman. Its description belies the fact that it is an unusually subtle and moving film.Less ambitious than Eastwood's previous movie `Mystic River', `Million Dollar Baby' centers on Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), an irritable boxing trainer who runs a gym with Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), a former boxer known as ""Scrap-Iron"", who also works as a janitor. Their life is somewhat stagnant until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) interrupts their world. She is a southern girl who visits the gym every moment she is not waitressing. Maggie wants nothing but to be trained by Frankie. As convention has it, he at first refuses, due to her sex and age, but eventually gives in.Yet the film is far from conventional. It does not have a catchy moral message or one-liners. Morgan Freeman's beautiful narration is both poetic and natural, as is all the dialogue. The characters, who could easily have been uninteresting stereotypes, are well drawn and portrayed with restraint. Eastwood's acting pales slightly in comparison to Freeman and Swank, but he fits his role perfectly. Frankie is hardened and quietly tormented, but he searches for assurance and tenderness.Freeman is also superbly cast as Eddie, whose eye was knocked sightless in his final fight. He is witty and genuine; he cannot stand watching people fall short of their potential. Eddie is more than a saintly sidekick; he has an edge that allows him to view the world realistically.Maggie is perhaps one of the kindest, most sincere characters in cinema. Swank is unquestioningly believable as an earnest girl driven by a desire to box. She is honest and strong-minded and does not box for the violence (unlike some of her opponents, including a particularly scary boxer played by Lucia Rijker). However, like the other characters in this film, Maggie is alone.Maggie and Frankie find glory in her boxing career.

The film also, beautifully incorporates a story about Frankie (Eastwood) and long-time associate Eddie (Freeman), from whom many of Frankie's insecurities stem. The only problem with the film is that they try to incorporate a bit with Frankie having it out with his Priest, but the emotion seems a bit forced. However, this does nothing to hurt the picture.

There is not a single detail Eastwood got wrong in framing a story about love and dignity. The man with no name has produced a set of films from The Unforgiven through this one that are as clear an American Existentialist treatise as can be articulated. Life, death, morality versus what's right, these are issues brought into focus through believeable stories about believeable people. This film is genius. Freeman and Swank deserved their honours. It may be a valedictory for Freeman, but if so, he has delivered a performance for the ages. Swank is something else. Forget the high-brow aussie with the schizoid eyes, this woman is the best actress on the planet. But as I say, Clint got perfect readings from everyone.Even his gaeilge briste is dead-on.

She is totally believable in the role as she draws you into her life. The movie is really centred around Eastwood, Freeman and Swank to the point where you do not notice anyone else - but this is not a bad thing, as the characters and performances of all three command that attention. This movie is a little slow-paced at the beginning with Freeman narrating the story to set the scene but stay with it, as it draws you in as good compelling moviemaking should. Eastwoods character is the father-figure, scarred by events of the past, and as a result, afraid to take risks. His female prodigy lifts him out of this and soon they are fighting their way to the top. Finally, they face the biggest fight of their careers, where there is no winner.

Hillary Swank is outstanding as Maggie Fitzgerald, the Ozarks waitress who would give anything to learn the fight game from Frankie Dunn --Eastwood's character, who is a grizzled, cynical yet spiritual veteran of the rings.  Morgan Freeman, who is both the Narrator and a character, is superb, bringing his own history to the grimy gym where he mops up after fighters and remembers his own days as a fighter.  ""Everybody has a certain number of fights in him. You just never know how many.  Mine was 109""The relationship between Frankie and Maggie grows from standoff-ish distance(""I don't train girls, Frankie snarls at first), to a fatherly love.  Maggie fills the void left in Frankie's life by the estrangement of his own daughter.The denouement of the story is predictably tragic.  Maggie gets close to her dream, but as she says when he asks how she wants to go to Las Vegas for a championship fight, ""we'll fly out, and drive back.""  They do, but not in the way you'd expect.The casting is outstanding, including Maggie's despicably greedy mother and greasy brother-in-law.I love the gritty mood of the film with the grimy gym and sleazy characters, including the Don King-like Promoter who would love to get his hands on Maggie's career.In a strange sort of way, this film is both depressing and uplifting: a tribute to the Human Spirit and the power of a dream.*****  (Five Stars)",5,Everybody Has Their Dream,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1633,"['Million', 'Dollar', 'BabyThe', 'liner', 'notes', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '2005', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'say', '25th', 'film', 'Director', 'better', 'project', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'classic', 'TV', 'drama', 'Requiem', 'Heavyweight', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'outstanding', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ozarks', 'waitress', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'anything', 'learn', 'fight', 'game', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'who', 'grizzled', 'cynical', 'yet', 'spiritual', 'veteran', 'rings', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Narrator', 'character', 'superb', 'bringing', 'own', 'history', 'grimy', 'gym', 'where', 'up', 'fighters', 'remembers', 'own', 'days', 'fighter', 'Everybody', 'certain', 'number', 'fights', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'Mine', 'was', '109', 'relationship', 'Frankie', 'Maggie', 'grows', 'standoff-ish', 'distance', 'do', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'Frankie', 'snarls', 'first', 'fatherly', 'love', 'Maggie', 'void', 'left', 'Frankie', 'life', 'estrangement', 'own', 'daughter.The', 'denouement', 'story', 'predictably', 'tragic', 'Maggie', 'close', 'dream', 'when', 'how', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'championship', 'fight', ""'ll"", 'fly', 'out', 'drive', 'back', 'do', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect.The', 'casting', 'outstanding', 'including', 'Maggie', 'despicably', 'greedy', 'mother', 'greasy', 'brother-in-law.I', 'gritty', 'mood', 'film', 'grimy', 'gym', 'sleazy', 'characters', 'including', 'Don', 'King-like', 'Promoter', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'get', 'hands', 'Maggie', 'career.In', 'strange', 'sort', 'way', 'film', 'depressing', 'uplifting', 'tribute', 'Human', 'Spirit', 'power', 'dream', '*****', 'Five', 'Stars']",N/A

When Maggie was knocked down (on a foul) by Blue Bear, the whole thing came to a screaching hault. It was like watching a superbowl and all of a sudden everything stops and no one is told why. If Maggie were to be hospitalized and 'nearly' dies, that would have been a great ending. Her comeback to beat the bear. As it was, I just saw too many holes in the story. You can't just kill someone with a massive does of adrenline and walk out of the hospital.

633466,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,B00005JNP1,Preston C. Enright,"[8, 49]","Watching this film, I was reminded that Clint Eastwood was a right-wing politician in California, I believe the mayor of some wealthy California town.  His reactionary ideology comes through in this awful, manipulative film.  Among the agendas being pushed is a hatred of welfare recipients, with the boxer's family being a repulsive caricature of people in need of public assistance.  No doubt, Eastwood has little problem with people in his tax bracket receiving government contracts and sweet deals for public land; but like most wealthy right-wingers I'm sure Clint loves kicking the poor in the face every chance he gets.The movie also advanced the notion that ""people love violence,"" a thought shared by Morgan Freeman's allegedly wise character, as the camera pans to the mob cheering as women pound each other.  I don't remember women's boxing being all that popular, nor male boxing.  In fact, the numbers of people going to violent pro sporting events (to root for modern day gladiators) is dwarfed by the numbers of people who go to national parks, libraries, museums, and engage in all sorts of non-violent activities.  Clint may love violence because he spent much of his career posing as a tough-guy and making a bunch of money doing it.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear if gun-manufacturers paid him for all his cinematic gun-toting.Other reactionary elememts of this movie include the celebration of Morgan Freeman's Uncle Tom character, the portrayal of the younger black as a hateful thug, the endless sermon about ""saving your money"" (rich people are always lecturing the poor about how they simply need to save their non-existent money, and stop complaining about things like class war), and patriarchy (it was a bit narcissistic to see Clint cast himself as the man who gets fawned over by a woman a third his age).This country is awash in reactionary propaganda, sometimes it takes obvious forms in our corporate news media (CNN and Fox).  Sometimes it takes the forms of comments in advertisements, or the narratives of tv dramas like ""24"" (where the US empire is always under-threat, but apparently never commits aggression against other nations).  And sometimes the propaganda appears very subtlely in films like ""Million Dollar Baby.""  We should keep an eye out for films directed by right-wingers, or starring right-wingers like Arnold Schwarzeneggar.  These figures don't put their politics to the side when the camera rolls; and neither should progressives (see Warren Beatty's ""Bulworth"").Regarding quality-of-life issues, there's a much better film called ""The Sea Inside.""  It's an award-winning film from Spain that doesn't feel a need to try to convince us of how violent we are, or how awful the poor are, or how young blacks should get their teeth knocked out (a scene that says a lot about the mindset of the film-maker who created it).",1,Subtle Propaganda,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,2873,"['Watching', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'right-wing', 'politician', 'California', 'believe', 'mayor', 'wealthy', 'California', 'town', 'reactionary', 'ideology', 'through', 'awful', 'manipulative', 'film', 'agendas', 'being', 'pushed', 'hatred', 'welfare', 'recipients', 'boxer', 'family', 'being', 'repulsive', 'caricature', 'people', 'need', 'public', 'assistance', 'doubt', 'Eastwood', 'little', 'problem', 'people', 'tax', 'bracket', 'receiving', 'government', 'contracts', 'sweet', 'deals', 'public', 'land', 'most', 'wealthy', 'right-wingers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Clint', 'kicking', 'poor', 'face', 'chance', 'movie', 'also', 'advanced', 'notion', 'people', 'love', 'violence', 'thought', 'shared', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'allegedly', 'wise', 'character', 'camera', 'mob', 'cheering', 'women', 'pound', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'women', 'boxing', 'being', 'popular', 'male', 'boxing', 'fact', 'numbers', 'people', 'going', 'violent', 'pro', 'sporting', 'events', 'root', 'modern', 'day', 'gladiators', 'dwarfed', 'numbers', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'national', 'parks', 'libraries', 'museums', 'engage', 'sorts', 'non-violent', 'activities', 'Clint', 'may', 'love', 'violence', 'spent', 'much', 'career', 'posing', 'tough-guy', 'making', 'bunch', 'money', 'doing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'hear', 'gun-manufacturers', 'paid', 'cinematic', 'gun-toting.Other', 'reactionary', 'elememts', 'movie', 'include', 'celebration', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'character', 'portrayal', 'younger', 'black', 'hateful', 'thug', 'endless', 'sermon', 'saving', 'money', 'rich', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'lecturing', 'poor', 'how', 'simply', 'need', 'save', 'non-existent', 'money', 'stop', 'complaining', 'things', 'class', 'war', 'patriarchy', 'was', 'bit', 'narcissistic', 'see', 'Clint', 'cast', 'man', 'who', 'fawned', 'over', 'woman', 'third', 'age', '.This', 'country', 'awash', 'reactionary', 'propaganda', 'obvious', 'forms', 'corporate', 'news', 'media', 'CNN', 'Fox', 'forms', 'comments', 'advertisements', 'narratives', 'tv', 'dramas', '24', 'where', 'US', 'empire', 'always', 'under-threat', 'apparently', 'never', 'aggression', 'other', 'nations', 'sometimes', 'propaganda', 'very', 'subtlely', 'films', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'films', 'directed', 'right-wingers', 'starring', 'right-wingers', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzeneggar', 'figures', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'politics', 'side', 'when', 'camera', 'should', 'progressives', 'see', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Bulworth', '.Regarding', 'quality-of-life', 'issues', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'called', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'award-winning', 'film', 'Spain', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'try', 'convince', 'how', 'violent', 'are', 'how', 'awful', 'poor', 'are', 'how', 'young', 'blacks', 'should', 'get', 'teeth', 'knocked', 'out', 'scene', 'lot', 'mindset', 'film-maker', 'who', 'created']",N/A

The message seems to be that your life is only worthwhile if you reach for and achieve greatness (and this is key, because her pride is having reached greatness, not having reach FOR it). And then, if something bad befalls you, give up the ship. I mean, what is there to live for, right? Is that supposed to be courage? Would Stephen Hawking agree? Would Christopher Reeve have agreed?

633470,A4DTOO95QUGQT,B00005JNP1,"Randall Brooks ""Author""","[0, 1]","I can see why so many viewers are split on this movie. It's very well made, extremely well acted, beautifully filmed, masterfully directed, and brilliantly crafted with some very intense action. It also features some of the best boxing scenes ever committed to screen. And for the most part, has a magnificent story.However, a little over half-way through, the story takes a very unexpected dramatic turn that has spit audiences straight down the middle. And, like I said in my opening sentence, I can see why.First, let me state that I heavily applaud Clint Eastwood for his immaculate direction, and I am astounded by the breathtaking acting by everyone in the cast. I honestly don't think Hilary Swank has ever been better. And she has done some fine work in her career.But, what I (and I'm sure others) feel hurts this film is the unexpected way it turns from being a story about an underdog who fights (no pun intended) her way to the top, to a very depressing second half that deals with the issue of euthanasia.Like some other reviewers on here have stated, it is a very schizophrenic screenplay. Not to say that it is a badly written script, it's just that is seems a little unfocused on where it was initially headed from the beginning.Plus, there are some things that do beg to question why they were even in the film to begin with. One being the character of Danger. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Jay Baruchel, and especially in that role. I felt he brought a very sympathetic character to life, and made the audience want to reach out and give him a hug.But, what was the point of his character to begin with? He doesn't advance the plot at all.There were some moments in this film that I loved, and could watch over and over, but there are also some scenes (especially in the second half) that I wish I had never seen, and hope to never see again.I rate this four stars soley because it is so well made, and so well acted. But for story, I would probably rate it about only two. I would raise it to five if it had ended after the last fight, and on a higher, more positive note. But, that wasn't the story that they were trying to tell, so I have to lower my rating a little to reflect how I feel about the story that was told.Thank you. :>)Randall Brooks(author, ""The Two Worlds of the Mind"")",3,Clint's Million Dollar Mess...,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2308,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'split', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'very', 'intense', 'action', 'also', 'best', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'ever', 'committed', 'screen', 'most', 'part', 'magnificent', 'story.However', 'little', 'half-way', 'story', 'very', 'unexpected', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'spit', 'audiences', 'straight', 'down', 'middle', 'said', 'opening', 'sentence', 'can', 'see', 'why.First', 'let', 'state', 'heavily', 'applaud', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'immaculate', 'direction', 'am', 'astounded', 'breathtaking', 'acting', 'everyone', 'cast', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'done', 'fine', 'work', 'career.But', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'feel', 'film', 'unexpected', 'way', 'being', 'story', 'underdog', 'who', 'pun', 'intended', 'way', 'top', 'very', 'depressing', 'second', 'half', 'deals', 'issue', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'stated', 'very', 'schizophrenic', 'screenplay', 'Not', 'say', 'badly', 'written', 'script', 'just', 'little', 'unfocused', 'where', 'was', 'initially', 'headed', 'beginning.Plus', 'are', 'things', 'do', 'beg', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'film', 'begin', 'One', 'being', 'character', 'Danger', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'especially', 'role', 'felt', 'brought', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'life', 'made', 'audience', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'give', 'hug.But', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'character', 'begin', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'all.There', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'loved', 'could', 'watch', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'hope', 'never', 'see', 'again.I', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'soley', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'only', 'two', 'would', 'raise', 'five', 'had', 'ended', 'last', 'fight', 'higher', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'have', 'lower', 'rating', 'little', 'reflect', 'how', 'feel', 'story', 'was', '>', 'Randall', 'Brooks', 'author', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'Mind']",N/A

While he picked out something for himself, I made a bee-line for a movie I'd wanted to see since its' release.  Some things improve with age and Clint Eastwood definitely fits into that category.  I don't think he's acted in or directed anything that hasn't been very good or great since he quit being Dirty Harry.  After all the hype I had heard for roughly a year, I was afraid I'd be in for a let down.  To my pleasant surprize, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was better than I thought it would be (and I was expecting something pretty darn good).There are things that make good movies great and ""Million Dollar Baby"" has most of them.  The acting is superb with special recognition to the top three in the cast; Eastwood, Hillary Swank, and the ever-reliable Morgan Freeman.  The story is very good as well.  I admit that I had my doubts about women's professional boxing.  However, it was very easy to buy into the script.  In fact, I don't think that the story would have worked nearly as well with a male boxer instead.  However, the greatest aspect of this movie is the directing.  There are so many short takes and side stories that weave into such a completeness.The story itself is rather simple and, to a point, rather predictable.  An aging boxing trainer/manager (played by Eastwood) is asked to train a female boxing wannabe (played by Hillary Swank) who's already a bit old to be entering the profession.  Obviously he turns the woman down and, just as obviously, the movie doesn't end with that refusal.  Those short takes and side stories tell us why the manager, Frankie Dunn, eventually takes her on.  Naturally, with his training, her career takes off.  I'll let up on the plot at that point.  You probably know the rest but let's not take chances.  I had heard just enough to have a general idea of what happened next.  Even so, when the first big moment came, it hit me like a brick even though I knew it was coming.  The eventual climax was also something I knew was coming.  I admit that I had an issue with that.  My wife, who is a quadraplegic, came in around this point in the movie and watched the rest of it with me.  We both realized that there were some very wrong choices being made.  I was prepared to dwell on that but I realized that I could let go of that and focus on the bigger picture.  You see, the movie isn't about her; it's about him.For all of the drama and excitement of boxing and the odd relationships it fosters, ""Million Dollar Baby"" comes down to a story about love and the sacrifice one man is willing to make for someone he cares for.  For those of us concerned about the moral issue raised by this movie it is important to consider the real dilemna of Frankie Dunn.  All of those rather odd (and somewhat humorous) scenes of his visits with his priest lets us know that this is a man who is devoted to his Catholic faith.  He may not always grasp the particulars but he has been quietly living his faith all these years and now it is truly put to the test.  In granting his friend's wish, Dunn forfeits everything he holds dear.  To put it theologically; Dunn betrays the greatest commandment in favor of the second greatest commandment.  Let's face it; most of us are at least a commandment or two below that.

The ""Million Dollar"" screenplay takes a ridiculous turn halfway through and becomes nothing but cynical soap opera giving Hillary Swank a chance to suffer and die as usual. Her performance is so hackneyed and predictable when compared to the scintillating star-turn of Annette Benning. For the latter actress to lose twice to Swank's xerox performances has made me never want to watch or follow the Oscar race ever again.

My wife, being the steadfast Clint Eastwood fan, pleaded for me to go with her. Girls boxing... I wondered (yawn). Okay, good reviews were hitting the newspapers at the time... so off we went. The movie starts out slowly. Establishing the characters is a must... and Eastwood knows his trade (this is his 25th directed and 57th acted). Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald - the skinny southern poor waitress with a dream and what turns out to be a wicked punch. Eastwood plays the gym owner and trainer, Frankie Dunn. Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right hand man in the gym, Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, as well as narrator of the story. The story starts off with Maggie wandering into the gym, trying to work out, looking to be trained. Dunn tells her to get lost (repeatedly ""I don't train girls"", and that an over-the-hill woman shouldn't be starting a boxing career so late in her life). Persistance pays off for Maggie as Dunn is soon training her. The boxing sequences look real and are action-packed. Swank takes many a punch as does her stunt double. Boxer Lucia Rijker (""Blue Bear"" in this film) was Swank's trainer during the process. ""Million Dollar Baby"" simply draws you in to the story from the start. The likable characters make you empathize for them every inch of the way. Most importantly, each of the three main character's performances are believeable. Wonderful highs and unexpected sad lows. One of my favorites in 2004. Worthy of 4 of the big time Oscars (Best Picture, Director/Eastwood, Best Actress/Swank, Best Support/Freeman). A 2-disc set; feature is 132 minutes; 5.1 Dolby digital sound; 3 better than average featurettes (1. Behind the scenes, 2. ""Born to fight"" with boxer Lucia Rijker, 3. James Lipton goes toe to toe with Eastwood/Swank/Freeman). If the movie ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) didn't make Hilary Swank a household name, in 2005 ""Million Dollar Baby"" surely will.

633483,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JNP1,RMurray847,"[5, 7]","Yep, it's about an ""old-time"" boxing trainer who runs a gym and helps out boxers who are up and coming, but looses them when they go for the big time.  He finds himself training, with great reluctance, an aspiring female boxer.  Their relationship goes from rocky to deep and loving (not as lovers, but as father/daughter.)I've seen a few reviews here and elsewhere that say the movie is just full of cliches.  Pardon me, but can a movie be made about sports that isn't?  If it's about winning or losing in any fashion, it's a cliche.What is great about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is that while it doesn have some ""cliches"" (the boxer actually manages to earn her way to a title fight...the grizzled trainer warms up) this is a movie that skirts the cliches with details that are true and cut to the bone.Director Clint Eastwood is often praised for telling stories without a lot of fluff.  He's well known for filming fast.  But what this seems to do for him as a filmmaker is to allow him to capture something that feels true and spontaneous and then he moves on...he doesn't try to work it...to make it ""truer"" or ""more spontaneous.""  He knows that no moment ever brings perfect clarity.  That every time a person learns a hard lesson about life, it isn't just a time of growing...it's a time of reluctantly giving up on something you've clung to for a long time.  With growth, with love, with respect and with hope also comes the knowledge that you are opening up to loss, rejection, tragedy and despair.MILLION DOLLAR BABY's charactes are far to specifically realized to be relegated to ""cliche"" status.  Eastwood plays the trainer.  He's a hard, grizzled man, gravelly voiced, slow moving and simmering...in many ways a typical Eastwood hero.  But we see all too soon that beneath his surface is actually a very decent fellow, capable of love and regret, capable of strong feeling (and also a good, instinctive trainer) who has simply closed himself up because of past events.  It's as though his very movements have been constricted by regret.  It is Eastwood's best performance ever, hands down.  It's Clint, I know it is...but never has he come close to this.Hillary Swank is the boxer.  Her character is too old to start boxing, but it's a dream she's had all her life and she's sacrificing almost everything to give it a shot.  She also instinctively senses the Eastwood can also be the ""father"" that she loved and lost years ago...the only other person who supported her dreams.  She's one tough cookie, but she's naive.  We believe she is totally brave, and we know we wouldn't want to get in a fist fight with her, but she is also very vulnerable.  She's easy to love, and she WANTS love.  More than she wants to box, she wants to fit in somewhere.  She isn't looking for a husband or child...she needs the uncomplicated, unquestioning love of a parent.Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's oldest friend, a former boxer who lost an eye in a fight (and Eastwood blames  himself) and has worked as a ""sidekick"" to Eastwood ever since, these days as a sort of manager/janitor at the gym (where he lives).  We know he has a gambling problem, but he's also the guy who perhaps is the wisest of all.  He's our narrator, and to some extent, he's really a dramatic device.  But Eastwood's character is revealed best (especially early on) in his relationship with Freeman.  And as far as I'm concerned, any film rich in the voice of Morgan Freeman is okay by me!Some have heard that the movie takes an unexpected twist as it nears its final 45 minutes or so.  Well, I can't deny that it goes places we hoped in our  heart (at least the heart that enjoys ""sports movie cliches"") it wouldn't go.  But it DOES go where the story needs to take us.  The movie leaves you wrung out in the end...but oddly uplifted too.  We see some strong, clear, brave HUMANITY in these very flawed characters.  They make tough decisions.  But their love for each other is so strong, that we can't help but be happy for them that they experienced such love.The movie deserves all its accolades.  It's long and moves at its own leisurely pace, but not one single time did I look at my watch.  It's absurdly well acted.  Swank, Eastwood and Freeman all deserved their Oscar nominations.  It's beautifully photographed as well...just marvel at the shadows and colors in the gym.I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's PG-13, by the way.

633485,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00005JNP1,Robert Bezimienny,"[17, 47]","In a number of interviews Clint Eastwood has maintained that this film is about a father/daughter relationship.  It is only incidentally about boxing, and its depiction of euthanasia is primarily present for the sake of the drama - it is not a film 'about' euthanasia.  There is something grossly disingenuous about Mr.Eastwood's responses, to the point where it becomes questionable whether he is prepared to reveal any of his real motivations - either that or he truly has an incredibly limited comprehension of the forces at play both within the film and in its reception by the broader world, and, possibly, little insight into his own self.*Some Christian critics have seen the film as problematising euthanasia in a morally helpful way, but many have condemned it for condoning the practice;  in an online interview on filmlinc.com, Eastwood comes perilously close to admitting that the film allows an interpretation where 'the cosmos' supports the protagonist's decision, despite this character's own misgivings.  Elsewhere it has been pointed out that U.S. law allows a cognitively intact paraplegic person to ask for accessory means of life support to be withdrawn - that is to say, in the movie the Hilary Swank character, Maggie, could simply have asked doctors to disconnect her respirator;  one wonders if this fact was known by Mr.Eastwood and his screenwriter, Mr.Haggis, and if so why they chose to depict the death as actively assisted.  At the very least, it seems a conscious decision on the writers' parts to do so, and one would like to hear an articulate elaboration of their reasons for doing so - none is forthcoming in the interviews I have read, save for brief appeals to the dictates of 'the drama' or 'the characters'.*In a way, all this is a criticism of the dreadful inarticulateness at the heart of this movie.  Mr.Eastwood embodies a kind of mute self-righteousness in many of his roles, and he appears to valorise this stance in real life; for instance, he states that none of us would know what decision we would make prior to actually being in the shoes of Frankie Dunn, and he states this as if it were both uncontroversially true and a good thing.  Clearly many people know what they would do without actually being in such a position, and what is more they can give reasons why they would act in a certain way, either through citing religious beliefs or through reasoned argument derived from a secular moral theory or, perhaps, through a less systematic reflection upon their own character; whatever the ultimate decision, the process of giving voice to the conflicting factors informing the deliberations appears essential, essential for any kind of intellegent, reflective life, including the most dogmatically religious, and vitally essential for a living democracy.  It is very odd to have sentiments implicitly undermining the difficult process of rendering strong yet inarticulate feelings into words, a clear and literate expression of our inner lives - very odd indeed coming from America, where freedom of expression and the marketplace of ideas have long been extolled as virtues.*The film itself if full of cliches.  Many of these are offensive.  The face of evil in the film is the established female boxing champion.  Gratuitously we are informed that she is German and that she is a former prostitute.  As is the formula in Die Hard, and in most mainstream Hollywood films, the villain is preferably a foreigner.  Here the villain's moral worth is allied with the low regard in which prostitution is held.  The villain also has dark skin. Other villains come in the form of welfare cheats.  Maggie's family are referred to as 'hillbillies'.  Several times her mother's obesity is mentioned as not a mere fact but as a fact worthy of moral condemnation - this prejudice, that being overweight equates with laziness and a kind of moral laxity, is presented with no overt acknowledgement.  It is just one of the background assumptions of the film.  Similarly, Maggie's decision that it would be better to be dead than be permanently disabled is vindicated by the entire tenor of the film - this has quite understandably provoked objections from groups fighting for the rights of the disabled, and forums of such views can be accessed on the web.  On these sites it is mentioned that Mr.Eastwood spent around $600,000 in legal fees, fighting a case brought against him in response to his refusal to install $7,000 of toilets accessible by the disabled in his ranch-style resort.*On a purely cinematic level, this is a boxing movie.  Life is portrayed as a fight, requiring both toughness and skill.  The violence is glorified until tragedy intervenes, and even then it is not outrightly condemned.  Unsurprisingly, Mr.Eastwood is no pacifist.  There is the voyeuristic novelty of having female boxers - at least they are clothed, although this was not always the case, organised topless female boxing having been practiced in the U.K. during the nineteenth century.  There are the stereotypical ideas of overcoming odds, getting to the top through hard work, and an ounce of luck, and, above all, having a dream and pursuing it, even when it is utterly delusional.  This last idea is strangely embodied in 'Danger', a mentally deficient young man, who is apparently applauded for maintaining illusions of becoming a boxer when this is openly absurd - better this than the alternatives, or so says the film, without of course any exploration of what the alternatives might actually be.  There is manipulative music and moody lighting.  Ironically I found myself thinking of 'The Karate Kid' series, which starred none other than Hilary Swank - despite surface dissimilarities, part of the 'entertainment' arrives at the same emotional pitch in both 'Million Dollar Baby' and its less feted predescessors.  This is appealing, no doubt.  Mr.Eastwood's intentions have us involved with the flowering of a redemptive love between Frankie Dunn and Maggie, two people very much alone.  This loneliness is well-portrayed and their care each for the other is the best thing about the film.  The existential concerns of Frankie Dunn do have an honesty and power which the film effectively conveys.  It is not for nothing that so many viewers have responded to this film.  Even so, however admirable the lack of maudlin exchanges, the film is also severe in its prohibition of voiced communication of love - I am deeply uncertain whether this should be admired, as it sadly merges with its broader reticence on all manner of difficult subject matter.*Mr.Eastwood and, to be fair, some of his defenders have invoked the independence-of-art argument to answer some of their critics.  Unfortunately in his hands this argument amounts to a request to silence the debate.  It is also a refusal to acknowledge that, perhaps, many of his views, or indeed prejudices, are embodied in the work at a level not immediately obvious to himself.  Just as the character, Frankie Dunn, is mystified by his long-estranged daughter's refusal to reply to his letters, about the failures and limitations of his own character, so Mr.Eastwood appears oblivious to the limitations of his own emotional range, his own intellect, and to the effect disseminating his unacknowledged views might have upon others.",2,Dr.Kevorkian meets The Karate

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing gym (the Hit Pit) owner.  He goes to church, (to torment the priests) reads Yeats and speaks Gaelic, but he doesn't train girls.  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank, of Karate Kid 2 fame) is a waitress and aspiring aging boxer without a trainer.  She desperately wants Frankie to train her to become a champion fighter, but he doesn't train girls.Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, remember him in Shawshank prison?) is a burned out, blind in one eye, fighter whom Frankie employs at the gym.  He takes an interest in Maggie but tries to conceal it from Frankie.  But soon Maggie's talent as a good fighter becomes evident, and Frankie finally decides to take her on as her manager.Maggie proves herself to be an excellent contender for the tittle fights in women's boxing.  They make a lot of money together.  Having an estranged daughter who won't speak to him, Frankie begins to see more of a father, daughter relationship between the two, while Maggie's own family does not approve of her either.  Soon they become a pair.Other gym characters make the movie interesting and amusing.  But Eastwood and Freeman are like a couple of grumpy old men together and that's where the real humor lies.  The movie though, is a serious film that becomes more evident as the film progresses, when Maggie is critically injured during a fight.I enjoyed watching the movie.

633488,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B00005JNP1,Rob,"[4, 6]","Remember that old movie trailer voiceover? The one which used to promise an audience that 'You'll laugh! You'll cheer! You'll cry!'? Of course that was rarely the case. But for once, as applied to Million Dollar Baby, the claim turns out to be true.Baby boasts a trio of well developed and engaging characters, all of whom are somewhere near the bottom of life's ladder. There's crusty gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), whose catchprase to his fighters 'Always protect yourself', masks a deep seated lack of faith in those around him. Then there's Frankie's closest friend, the retired boxer Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a warm counterpoint to Dunn's crustiness and last but not least there's the girl who comes into both their lives and changes them utterly, wannabee white-trash boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank).Working from a brilliant, tough-minded script by Paul Haggis, Million Dollar Baby puts a fresh spin on the overused boxing-as-metaphor-for-life, theme. In fact, as quickly becomes clear, the film is only superficially about boxing. It's much more interested in issues of paternal affection, surrogate families and an act of love so devastating that what might, in any other context, result in one man's eternal damnation turns out here to be his redemption.Eastwood's lean, understated direction doesn't put a foot wrong and the dramatic noir-ish lighting evokes in the film a tremendous atmosphere, a sense in which the all engulfing darkness is held at bay only by the humanity of the main characters. The minimalist score (also by Clint) is equally affecting and the actors performances are off the scale.As a big-hearted girl from the sticks, Hilary Swank is 100% persuasive and her boxing scenes are totally convincing (it's with a mild sense of awe that one learns that prior to this Hilary sidelined as a skinny underwear model for Calvin Klein). Equally effective, in an unshowy supporting role is Morgan Freeman, whose character Scrap narrates the film in voiceover (ala 'Shawshank Redemption'). Indeed, one of the many pleasures of Baby is the collective 'Aha!' on the part of the audience when Scrap's strangely knowledgable voiceover is revealed as having a purpose beyond that of merely informing the audience.All of which brings us to 74 year old Clint Eastwood who not only directed, co-produced and wrote the music for the movie but also played the lead role of gym manager Frankie Dunn. Quite simply, Eastwood gives the best performance of his career here and I'll give you an example of how great he is. When I saw the film a lot of people around me were quite evidently crying at some of the events depicted. As for me, although upset and deeply moved, I wasn't quite there. What finally did it was a scene between Frankie and his priest (Brian F. O'Byrne). As Frankie wrestles with a truly terrible dilemma the priest tells him that 'If you do this thing you'll be lost forever'. I won't give anything else away except to say that the depth of Clint's response was so powerful that it was enough to move me to tears as well.",5,One of the most powerful movies I've ever seen,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,3060,"['Remember', 'old', 'movie', 'trailer', 'voiceover', 'one', 'used', 'promise', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'cheer', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'course', 'was', 'rarely', 'case', 'once', 'applied', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'claim', 'out', 'be', 'true.Baby', 'trio', 'well', 'developed', 'engaging', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'somewhere', 'bottom', 'life', 'ladder', 'crusty', 'gym', 'owner', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Eastwood', 'catchprase', 'fighters', 'protect', 'deep', 'seated', 'lack', 'faith', 'Then', 'Frankie', 'closest', 'friend', 'retired', 'boxer', 'Scrap', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'warm', 'counterpoint', 'Dunn', 'crustiness', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'girl', 'who', 'lives', 'changes', 'utterly', 'wannabee', 'white-trash', 'boxer', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', '.Working', 'brilliant', 'tough-minded', 'script', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'fresh', 'spin', 'overused', 'boxing-as-metaphor-for-life', 'theme', 'fact', 'quickly', 'clear', 'film', 'only', 'superficially', 'boxing', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'issues', 'paternal', 'affection', 'surrogate', 'families', 'act', 'love', 'so', 'devastating', 'might', 'other', 'context', 'result', 'one', 'man', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'out', 'here', 'be', 'redemption.Eastwood', 'lean', 'understated', 'direction', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'dramatic', 'noir-ish', 'lighting', 'evokes', 'film', 'tremendous', 'atmosphere', 'sense', 'engulfing', 'darkness', 'held', 'bay', 'only', 'humanity', 'main', 'characters', 'minimalist', 'score', 'also', 'Clint', 'equally', 'affecting', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'scale.As', 'big-hearted', 'girl', 'sticks', 'Hilary', 'Swank', '100', '%', 'persuasive', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'are', 'totally', 'convincing', 'mild', 'sense', 'awe', 'one', 'prior', 'Hilary', 'sidelined', 'skinny', 'underwear', 'model', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'Equally', 'effective', 'unshowy', 'supporting', 'role', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Scrap', 'film', 'voiceover', 'ala', 'Redemption', 'Indeed', 'one', 'many', 'pleasures', 'Baby', 'collective', ""'Aha"", 'part', 'audience', 'when', 'Scrap', 'strangely', 'knowledgable', 'voiceover', 'revealed', 'having', 'purpose', 'merely', 'informing', 'audience.All', '74', 'year', 'old', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'co-produced', 'wrote', 'music', 'movie', 'also', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'gym', 'manager', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Quite', 'simply', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'here', ""'ll"", 'give', 'example', 'how', 'great', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'quite', 'evidently', 'crying', 'events', 'depicted', 'upset', 'deeply', 'moved', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'What', 'finally', 'did', 'was', 'scene', 'Frankie', 'priest', 'Brian', 'F.', ""O'Byrne"", 'Frankie', 'truly', 'terrible', 'priest', 'do', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'else', 'away', 'say', 'depth', 'Clint', 'response', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'was', 'enough', 'move', 'tears', 'well']",N/A

It's about a relationshipand a womans will to do more than what is expected of her.Now, I think Clints problems with his daughter could possiblyhave been brought to more light and perhaps Maggie winningso easy throughout was alittle overdone...

633490,AK1OBVI54SY73,B00005JNP1,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[5, 19]","I honestly do not understand why this movie was so highly praised. I only rented it out really because I thought it actually was the female version of Rocky, and for awhile it seemed to be that way. Poor fighter, crusty old manager, the works you know. And I loved Rocky so I thought, why not give it a shot, see how well it is. It looked interesting and I assumed maybe the critics actually picked out a good movie this time.Critics and I have always been on different wavelengths though on what is good and what is mediocre or trash. I hardly ever agree with other critics, but I always give them a shot with the movies they praise. Sometimes they're right, sometimes I think they are wrong. On this film I think it was too highly praised. Everyone was saying it was amazing and just so heart- jerking. I disagree. It was not amazing, matter of fact, if it wasn't for two major actors playing in the film (Clint, Morgan) then I doubt this film would have been as praised as it has. To me, if I looked to the actors as just actors I just saw normal acting, nothing amazing. And the plot itself held good ground, being somewhat like Rocky but putting in its own difference, like when Clint hints at problems with his daughter- although you never figure out unfortunately why his daughter and him are not speaking with each other. But especially when Maggie falls and falls hard is the major difference.The major disappoinment though in this film was not the highly applauded acting being just nothing special to me, but the ending itself. Maggie came in this film strong and determined to fight anything and anyone to be a great boxer. I believed in her strength, I believed she believed she could do anything, that's when I liked the movie a lot was seeing the determination of Maggie around Clint's gym, punching that bag all that time. Then something happens in the end, and it was terrible I can tell you that much, and suddenly Maggie just didn't have the fight in her anymore. That was the greatest disappointment of the film. I don't know, maybe others thought that was the most powerful point, when Maggie loses her will that she had so strongly in the beginning, but I thought it was just down right miserable and a bleak ending. I know that they were really trying to make it a tear jerker and the ending was supposed to be miserable but I just did not like that ending at all. I expected from all of Maggie's will in the beginning that she wouldn't have fallen all the way down, but she did, and it was just greatly disappointing that's all.Others, many others, will say this movie was great, but I would say in my personal opinion that this movie was not great, but just average. It was a good plot, with average acting, and a disappointing and miserable ending where the lead character named Maggie totally lets you down in the end. You can sympathize with her definitely, but the point was after you see her in the beginning, you expected her to be so much more stronger. Maggie said something in the beginning of the movie that I totally ignored, but now, I know was the most strongest quote in the whole film. Listen to her carefully in the beginning, and hear her hint at the ending of the film in one single sentence.",3,Maggie Disappointed Me Greatly...,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,3235,"['honestly', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'praised', 'only', 'rented', 'out', 'really', 'thought', 'actually', 'was', 'female', 'version', 'Rocky', 'awhile', 'seemed', 'be', 'way', 'Poor', 'fighter', 'crusty', 'old', 'manager', 'works', 'know', 'loved', 'Rocky', 'thought', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'shot', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'looked', 'interesting', 'assumed', 'maybe', 'critics', 'actually', 'picked', 'out', 'good', 'movie', 'time.Critics', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'different', 'wavelengths', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'mediocre', 'trash', 'hardly', 'ever', 'agree', 'other', 'critics', 'always', 'give', 'shot', 'movies', 'praise', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'right', 'sometimes', 'think', 'are', 'wrong', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'too', 'highly', 'praised', 'Everyone', 'was', 'saying', 'was', 'amazing', 'just', 'so', 'heart-', 'jerking', 'disagree', 'was', 'not', 'amazing', 'matter', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'two', 'major', 'actors', 'playing', 'film', 'Clint', 'Morgan', 'then', 'doubt', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'praised', 'looked', 'actors', 'just', 'actors', 'just', 'saw', 'normal', 'acting', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'plot', 'held', 'good', 'ground', 'being', 'somewhat', 'Rocky', 'putting', 'own', 'difference', 'when', 'Clint', 'hints', 'problems', 'daughter-', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'why', 'daughter', 'are', 'not', 'speaking', 'other', 'especially', 'when', 'Maggie', 'hard', 'major', 'difference.The', 'major', 'disappoinment', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'applauded', 'acting', 'being', 'just', 'nothing', 'special', 'ending', 'Maggie', 'came', 'film', 'strong', 'determined', 'fight', 'anything', 'anyone', 'be', 'great', 'boxer', 'believed', 'strength', 'believed', 'believed', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'when', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'was', 'seeing', 'determination', 'Maggie', 'Clint', 'gym', 'punching', 'bag', 'time', 'Then', 'something', 'end', 'was', 'terrible', 'can', 'tell', 'that', 'much', 'suddenly', 'Maggie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fight', 'anymore', 'was', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'others', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'point', 'when', 'Maggie', 'will', 'had', 'so', 'strongly', 'beginning', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'miserable', 'bleak', 'ending', 'know', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'make', 'tear', 'jerker', 'ending', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'miserable', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'ending', 'expected', 'Maggie', 'will', 'beginning', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fallen', 'way', 'down', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'greatly', 'disappointing', 'all.Others', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'would', 'say', 'personal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'average', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'average', 'acting', 'disappointing', 'miserable', 'ending', 'where', 'lead', 'character', 'named', 'Maggie', 'totally', 'down', 'end', 'can', 'sympathize', 'definitely', 'point', 'was', 'see', 'beginning', 'expected', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'stronger', 'Maggie', 'said', 'something', 'beginning', 'movie', 'totally', 'ignored', 'now', 'know', 'was', 'most', 'strongest', 'quote', 'whole', 'film', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'beginning', 'hear', 'hint', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'single', 'sentence']",N/A

Dunn refuses to train a ""girl"", but 31-year-old Maggie won't take ""NO!"" for an answer ... so Eddie helps her, while Dunn wrestles w/his sorrows, for his daughter won't answer his letters- sending them back 'return to sender', & the 1 boxer he had trained to win goes off w/another better-connected manager.  As Dunn taunts his priest [a crucial plot-point], Maggie develops into a contender w/a lethal left hook.  Finally giving into her dogged resolve, Dunn gives Maggie a Gaelic nickname [he reads Yeats in the original Gaelic, after all] & helps to add to her resolve as she boxes her way up and up and...Eastwood takes Maggie's fierce determination, Eddie's wry-but-involved hope for the kids in the gym, and Dunn's Catholicism & turns them into a shattering 180-degree plot twist that tests them all past their limits.  How each character deals w/those limits, & how they *matter* are more important than the 1-dimensional 'villains' they fight  - the real problems in this film, as in life, are personal, not external.

Eastwood's best film is about three people who grow to care, love, and sacrifice for eachother, with one happening to be a boxer.

The story is always involving, and pulls you in slowly with its warmth and sly humor. When things turn dark, and the infamous twist comes out of nowhere and punches you in the face, you'd have to be pretty naturally stone-cold not to feel shaken and devastated to the very pit of your heart.

633505,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNP1,Scott Schiefelbein,"[6, 8]","It would be so easy to dismiss ""Million Dollar Baby"" as a ""boxing movie.""  Clint Eastwood's movie revolves around three characters who are living life on the sidelines (two by choice, one by birth), and through the crucible of boxing and motivated by the iron will of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), they each learn to step back onto the field of play.A word of advice -- avoid any spoilers regarding plot twists, if at all possible!The movie's story, based on a short story by F.X. Toole, could have been the source of a cliched piece of tripe.  Frankie Dunn (Eastwood, never better) is a boxing trainer who runs one of those dead-end gyms that you drive by and wonder, when the heck are they going to knock that thing down?  Dunn has a world's worth of boxing knowledge in his head, but he's so afraid of overextending his boxers (based on a prior bad experience) that his top contenders leave him for people who will give them shots for world titles.  Poor, struggling, and estranged from his daughter, Dunn nevertheless seems comfortable with his hum-drum no-risk life.  His only enjoyment seems to come from tormenting his Catholic priest Father Horvak (Brian O'Bryne) with the ""unanswerable"" questions of Catholic dogma.Dunn's ""partner"" at the gym is his former boxer, Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, who also narrates the film, and should narrate every film).  ""Scraps"" lives at the gym, cleaning up the place, helping out, and offering a cautionary tale through the obvious loss of vision in one eye.  Dunn and Scraps have worked out a friendship that is essentially based on mild banter and never challenging the other.That is changed with the arrival of Maggie, whose ambition is for Dunn to train her to champtionship form.  Dunn resists, claiming that he doesn't train ""girls"" (a word Dunn defensively uses with dripping sarcasm).  But Maggie, a self-proclaimed escapee from a lifetime of being trailer-trash, is one of those people who will not be denied.  Interestingly, most movies would have Dunn finally accept Maggie after seeing her shockingly k-o the top boxer in the gym.  But Dunn's reticence to train Maggie is based almost as much on his unwillingness to take a risk on her (and to risk a ""girl's"" health in the ring) rather than a real conviction that she's no good . . . and this is a barrier that Maggie's fierce determination will overcome.While this movie clearly revolves around boxing (and the boxing scenes all ring with authenticity, which is a testament to the actors), this movie isn't about boxing.  It's about three lost souls who each find something they need in each other.  Through Maggie's successes in the ring to the film's shattering conclusion, the movie wisely says very little and shows a heck of a lot.  I may have seen every movie Clint has ever made, and I'm not sure he's ever shown this much emotional depth before -- there are several moments where his lined, scarred face says more with a stare, or glance, or glare, than most actors could achieve with ten soliloquies.  Freeman is Freeman, which is high praise in and of itself.  Freeman and Eastwood have such astounding chemistry that one never questions their bonds, even though they never speak of such unmanly things.And then there's Ms. Swank as Maggie.  Yes, she won another Oscar for this movie, and yes, she deserved it.  She disappears into Maggie, who could have so easily been your typical ""girl from the wrong side of the tracks."" Instead, Maggie is given life, strength, and delicacy.  Not every young actress could go toe-to-toe with titans like Eastwood and Freeman and stand on her own, and yet Swank does so astoundingly well.  Also, for a truly gorgeous woman, Swank disappears into Maggie so well that after only a few minutes, you forget that you're looking at a beautiful movie star and only think that you're looking at little Maggie, who wants more than anything to be a boxer.A wonderful film, ""Million Dollar Baby"" deserves all the accolades it received.  The two-disc DVD set is fine, but I've watched the movie three times and still haven't made it to the extras -- the movie's just that good.",5,Timeless characters elevate tale of redemption through the risky life of a boxer,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,4139,"['would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'boxing', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'around', 'three', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'life', 'sidelines', 'two', 'choice', 'one', 'birth', 'crucible', 'boxing', 'motivated', 'iron', 'will', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'learn', 'step', 'back', 'field', 'play.A', 'word', 'advice', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'regarding', 'plot', 'twists', 'possible', 'movie', 'story', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'F.X', 'Toole', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'source', 'cliched', 'piece', 'tripe', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'better', 'boxing', 'trainer', 'who', 'one', 'dead-end', 'gyms', 'drive', 'wonder', 'when', 'heck', 'are', 'going', 'knock', 'thing', 'down', 'Dunn', 'world', 'worth', 'boxing', 'knowledge', 'head', 'so', 'afraid', 'overextending', 'boxers', 'based', 'prior', 'bad', 'experience', 'top', 'contenders', 'leave', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'shots', 'world', 'titles', 'Poor', 'struggling', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Dunn', 'nevertheless', 'comfortable', 'hum-drum', 'no-risk', 'life', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'come', 'tormenting', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'Horvak', 'Brian', ""O'Bryne"", 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'Catholic', 'dogma.Dunn', 'partner', 'gym', 'former', 'boxer', 'Eddie', 'Scrap-Iron', 'Dupris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'should', 'narrate', 'film', 'Scraps', 'gym', 'cleaning', 'up', 'place', 'helping', 'out', 'offering', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'obvious', 'loss', 'vision', 'one', 'eye', 'Dunn', 'Scraps', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'friendship', 'essentially', 'based', 'mild', 'banter', 'never', 'challenging', 'other.That', 'changed', 'arrival', 'Maggie', 'ambition', 'Dunn', 'train', 'champtionship', 'form', 'Dunn', 'claiming', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'word', 'Dunn', 'defensively', 'dripping', 'sarcasm', 'Maggie', 'self-proclaimed', 'escapee', 'lifetime', 'being', 'trailer-trash', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'Interestingly', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'Dunn', 'finally', 'accept', 'Maggie', 'seeing', 'shockingly', 'k-o', 'top', 'boxer', 'gym', 'Dunn', 'reticence', 'train', 'Maggie', 'based', 'almost', 'much', 'unwillingness', 'take', 'risk', 'risk', 'girl', 'health', 'ring', 'rather', 'real', 'conviction', 'good', 'barrier', 'Maggie', 'fierce', 'determination', 'will', 'overcome.While', 'movie', 'clearly', 'boxing', 'boxing', 'ring', 'authenticity', 'testament', 'actors', 'movie', ""n't"", 'boxing', 'three', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'find', 'something', 'need', 'other', 'Maggie', 'successes', 'ring', 'film', 'shattering', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'wisely', 'very', 'little', 'heck', 'lot', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Clint', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'shown', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'before', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'where', 'lined', 'scarred', 'face', 'more', 'stare', 'glance', 'glare', 'most', 'actors', 'could', 'achieve', 'ten', 'soliloquies', 'Freeman', 'Freeman', 'high', 'praise', 'Freeman', 'Eastwood', 'have', 'such', 'astounding', 'chemistry', 'one', 'never', 'questions', 'bonds', 'even', 'never', 'speak', 'such', 'unmanly', 'things.And', 'then', 'Ms.', 'Swank', 'Maggie', 'Yes', 'won', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'yes', 'deserved', 'Maggie', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'easily', 'been', 'typical', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Instead', 'Maggie', 'given', 'life', 'strength', 'delicacy', 'Not', 'young', 'actress', 'could', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'titans', 'Eastwood', 'Freeman', 'stand', 'own', 'yet', 'Swank', 'so', 'astoundingly', 'well', 'Also', 'truly', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'Swank', 'Maggie', 'so', 'well', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'forget', ""'re"", 'looking', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'star', 'only', 'think', ""'re"", 'looking', 'little', 'Maggie', 'who', 'more', 'anything', 'be', 'boxer.A', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'accolades', 'received', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'fine', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'extras', 'movie', 'just', 'good']",N/A

The chemistry between he and Swank is touching and real, which is why the ending resonates so strongly.

I'll just say it's a pure and moving moment richly earned.  As far as the movie goes as a whole, it deserves the hype.  I was really skeptical when I heard Eastwood won over Scorcese's Aviator.  But now, after seeing both, I think there's no question that the Academy made the right choice.  ""The Aviator"" is often breathtaking, but also very uneven.  ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one tight package.  For those upset over Scorcese missing out again (and from what I understand, Eastwood himself was uneasy over the comparisons), put it to rest.  Eastwood, as a director, has grown - perhaps now, brick by brick, film by film, beyond the great Scorcese.  Who'd of thunk it?What can one say about Eastwood?  Recently I watched again ""Unforgiven,"" and I was struck by the power of that movie (which also has Morgan Freeman).  Eastwood's growth as a director is one of the great quiet stories of Hollywood.  As an exercise watch the horrible ""Gauntlet"" or even the ""Outlaw Josie Wales,"" and then watch the trifecta of ""Mystic River,"" ""Unforgiven,"" and now ""Million Dollar Baby.""  What an astounding evolution!  Somewhere along the way Eastwood discovered that people matter - and moviegoers want to care about the people on the screen. And how he does it?  By focusing on character - and the heart.  Hillary Swank is a perfect example, with her heartbreaking performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, the toothy waitress with a right hook, who dares to dream of a life beyond her dreary existence. You are rooting for her despite the odds. Freeman - what a pro, he plays off of Eastwood in such a way that elevates both characters.  Eastwood's own performance as curmudgeony Frankie Dunn is simply one of his best - and should of netted him a best actor award.  But it's tough when people still see you as the Man with No Name.  Anyway, it's time to start looking at Eastwood as a throwback to the great American directors John Ford and Frank Capra. ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Unforgiven"" are American fables in the truest sense.

(1) I like Clint Eastwood, so don't get me wrong here (I have been watching him since he was dirty hairy and in movies like ""the good the bad and the ugly"") I just think he is getting a little bit too old to be acting. I'm NOT saying his acting was bad in this movie. He just seemed to be straining a lot to talk, as if he is struggling to say his lines (at times he was even hard to understand). He is an excellent writer, and getting into writing was the wisest choice he has made in his career. He is just getting a little old to be playing the tough guy roll. (2) Once again, the movie was good, but I would have liked to seen a more developed ending. It had a little bit of a rushed feeling to it, and it is a little more open ended than I like.

I watched this movie last night with high expectations; I was not disappointed. Like Clint Eastwood's previous melodrama, Mystic River, this film deals with some real emotions of average people you and I encounter everyday. Is it a great boxing film? Well, it is in a way. But unlike other great boxing films like, say, Rocky or Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby doesn't focus on the rise and/or fall of a striving boxer for a shot at the title. The movie touches more on the feelings of the boxer, the manager, and everybody around them. Hilary Swank (The Next Karate Kid, Boys Don't Cry) is stunning in her role as a struggling waitress striving to become a prize fighter, Maggie. Like Rocky Balboa, she is a down-on-her-luck average nobody who is determined to make a name for herself even if it takes spending hours in the gym punching the bags in spite of the ridicule of the other club fighters and the rejection of the club owner, an oldtimer named Frankie who refuses to train a girl and cares more about protecting his fighters than giving them a title match, and the sympathy and encouragement of Eddie, played remarkably by Morgan Freeman, a former contender who never got the chance at the title for losing his eye after a long damaging fight, who cleans the toilets, wipes spit, and literally lives in the gym.Behind the sweat and the guts of each of our main characters are ordinary problems for average people. Eastwood's Frankie has lost his number one contender, Big Willie, to a big-shot businessman who gives him the title match and the heavyweight championship, something Frankie would have delayed for another 2 or so fights, and also he has lost touch with his daughter who he tries and fails to send letters to, only to get the letters sent back under ""Return to sender"". Maggie's constant struggle in life is topped with her dissatisfied, ungrateful, and uncaring trailer-dwelling mother. Eddie, who narrates the events in the film, has to deal with a pride-swallowing job and coping with the loss of a boxing career and never surpassing his 109th winning fight.What happens next?

I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood but for a strange reason. Clint Eastwood reminds me of my late grandfather. Their mannerism and appearance are so similar it's like I'm watching my grandfather on screen.Aside from that, the movie was just superb. Hilary Swank is a truly talented, humble actress. She is not your typical actress who is in the business for all the glory and spotlight; I can see when she acts that she truly enjoys what she does. She deserved winning best actress for this role. She plays a poor, kind of white-trash waitress in her early 30's who has a knack for fighting. She wants more in life (not necessarily material things) so she slowly whittles down boxing manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to train her. She sees something in Frankie that she just doesn't see in any other trainer, therefore will not take `no' for an answer from him.Then there is Morgan Freeman, who is one of my favorite actors. He's done narration in several other movies and he just adds a very rich quality to the film. He plays an old and tired former boxer turned janitor who works (and lives) at the boxing gym. He observes the whole story behinds Swanks character and Eastwood's character.I won't delve too much into the plot. For one, several other reviewers have that covered already, and two, I don't want to give too much away. You just need to see it for yourself. The ending is very controversial and really makes you think what you would do if you were in the situation of the characters. I love a film that just sticks with you days after you see it, and this film does that.On a side note (and I know I'm going to sound kind of dumb asking this) I don't understand the title of the movie.

Erupting headlines shoot like geysers from The New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDB. I get excited when there's a film like this, because I'm excited to see it and get my own opinions on it. Unfortunately, many times, I don't exactly like the film. For 2004, that film is Million Dollar Baby.Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a southern 31-year-old from Missouri who has come from a broken home, and has one dream: to win the title of a boxing championship. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the acclaimed boxing manager. ""I don't train girls,"" is Dunn's immediate reflex once Maggie asks him to train her. Eventually, Dunn takes her as a trainee and eventually manages her boxing career, and the two of them begin an extremely strong, non-romantic emotional bond as Maggie advances towards her dream.Of course, there's more complex elements to the story than that, but really, that's it in a nutshell. For some reason, I believe that the all-star cast (Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman) helped bring this mediocre film to it's blockbuster status, and also helped it go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Yes, you'll hear critics say it's ""Remarkable"" and ""The best film of the year"" but none of them will ever say ""Unique."" Quite simply, because, there is nothing original about this film at all. There are so many films about someone going after their dreams I've lost count, and frankly, most of them are better and less appreciated than Million Dollar Baby.Of course, there are some huge highpoints this film has hit. One--Clint Eastwood really was the right choice for director. He did a superb job with the film, made it detailed without making it boring, and made it an easier film to watch without having to concentrate super-hard like you're taking the SATs in high school. Two--Paul Haggis's incredibly talented writing skills shine through like rays of sun through a thin white bed sheet in this film. It's not so much that the screenplay was original, funny, and creative like the Oscar-winning one of Little Miss Sunshine, but it was so extraordinarily well written and the dialogue is extremely realistic. Three--astounding performances by Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman (in my opinion, ALL of them worthy of Oscars) bring the film to its feet. Mixed with Paul Haggis's exquisitely written screenplay, it's almost like you're watching a documentary. And in no way is that a bad thing!Now we'll go back to the negative points for a bit. My least favourite thing about Million Dollar Baby is the ending. I can't really say much without ruining the film for you, but it was evident they were going for a very emotional and hard-hitting ending. Unfortunately, I didn't feel it. I get very emotional at sad films and am considered a rather emotional person, but the ending felt very rushed, overworked, and sloppily done. If they had spent another few weeks working on the ending, the ending alone would have made this film a classic.Overall--don't get me wrong. This is a GOOD film. It's just very overrated, and in my opinion, isn't deserving of all people say it's cut out to be. And definitely not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.",3,Extremely overrated,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,3320,"['once', 'while', 'sometimes', 'even', 'more', 'often', 'film', 'critics', 'practically', 'drool', 'Erupting', 'headlines', 'shoot', 'geysers', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'IMDB', 'get', 'excited', 'when', 'film', ""'m"", 'excited', 'see', 'get', 'own', 'opinions', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'film', '2004', 'film', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby.Hilary', 'Swank', 'Maggie', 'Fitzgerald', 'southern', '31-year-old', 'Missouri', 'who', 'come', 'broken', 'home', 'one', 'dream', 'win', 'title', 'boxing', 'championship', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Frankie', 'Dunn', 'acclaimed', 'boxing', 'manager', 'do', ""n't"", 'train', 'girls', 'Dunn', 'immediate', 'reflex', 'once', 'Maggie', 'train', 'Eventually', 'Dunn', 'trainee', 'eventually', 'boxing', 'career', 'two', 'begin', 'extremely', 'strong', 'non-romantic', 'emotional', 'bond', 'Maggie', 'dream.Of', 'course', 'more', 'complex', 'elements', 'story', 'really', 'nutshell', 'reason', 'believe', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'helped', 'bring', 'mediocre', 'film', 'blockbuster', 'status', 'also', 'helped', 'go', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Yes', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'critics', 'say', 'Remarkable', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'none', 'will', 'ever', 'say', 'Unique', 'Quite', 'simply', 'nothing', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'someone', 'going', 'dreams', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'frankly', 'most', 'are', 'better', 'less', 'appreciated', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby.Of', 'course', 'are', 'huge', 'highpoints', 'film', 'hit', 'One', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'really', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'director', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'film', 'made', 'detailed', 'making', 'boring', 'made', 'easier', 'film', 'watch', 'having', 'concentrate', 'super-hard', ""'re"", 'taking', 'SATs', 'high', 'school', 'Two', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'writing', 'skills', 'shine', 'rays', 'sun', 'thin', 'white', 'bed', 'sheet', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'screenplay', 'was', 'original', 'funny', 'creative', 'Oscar-winning', 'one', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'was', 'so', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'Three', 'astounding', 'performances', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'opinion', 'worthy', 'Oscars', 'bring', 'film', 'feet', 'Mixed', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'exquisitely', 'written', 'screenplay', 'almost', ""'re"", 'watching', 'documentary', 'way', 'bad', 'thing', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'negative', 'points', 'bit', 'least', 'favourite', 'thing', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'ruining', 'film', 'was', 'evident', 'were', 'going', 'very', 'emotional', 'hard-hitting', 'ending', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'sad', 'films', 'am', 'considered', 'rather', 'emotional', 'person', 'ending', 'felt', 'very', 'rushed', 'overworked', 'sloppily', 'done', 'had', 'spent', 'few', 'weeks', 'working', 'ending', 'ending', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'classic.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'GOOD', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'overrated', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'deserving', 'people', 'say', 'cut', 'out', 'be', 'definitely', 'not', 'worthy', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar']",N/A

633524,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JNP1,Steve Douglas,"[1, 1]","This is certainly one of my very favorite Clint Eastwood movies and I had been greatly looking forward to seeing it on Blu Ray as opposed to my Standard Def version.  I do not write plot summaries or analysis of characters as so many always do, and I do not want to be redundant, so this review will strictly be regarding the transfer to Blu Ray.The video transfer is the star of the disc as it is as clean as a whistle. There is no distracting grain, no artifacting, aliasing or ghosting anywhere.  While this is not a comparison between the standard def version and the blu ray, with the blu ray you will find deeper blacks, perhaps even crushed a bit, and more true to life coloration.  The film switches between a cool and warm color grading depending upon the scene and all is very appropriate.  While the standard def release was pretty good there is a considerable improvement to the entire look of the film.  If your TV passes pluge, you will be surprised at how what might have been gray before is now a true black.  Really well done.The audio, which I am always aware of, provides some very nice editing with discreet steering to all channels for foley fx and a full front and rear sound stage.  Never the less, the audio is the reason why my rating is at 4 stars instead of 5.  For some inane reason, the producers of the Blu Ray transfer did not provide an lossless soundtrack.  Instead you get a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  While many might not notice the difference, once you get used to a lossless audio track as most, not all, sound tracks are for Blu Rays, it is hard not to be cognizant of listening to a compressed soundtrack. It is like listening through a veil. However,  the audio on the blu ray is nicely balanced so that you will not have to play roller coaster with your remote's volume setting but it could, and should have, had an uncompressed soundtrack which really would make a big difference for most any sound system.Some decent extras here as well with a documentary on how the movie came to fruition from script to shooting, another addressing the reasons some go into boxing and more.  No deleted scenes or bloopers but, at least, no advertising previews for other movies.All in all, though I am very disappointed in the lack of a DTS MA or PCM 5.1 soundtrack, this blu ray is worth the purchase even though there is not a huge night and day difference between the SD and BR releases.  Glad I have it but if they ever come out with an uncompressed audio release, you can be sure I would buy it again.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.Thanks",4,Million Dollar Baby on Blu Ray,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2625,"['certainly', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'greatly', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'opposed', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'do', 'not', 'write', 'plot', 'summaries', 'analysis', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'always', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'redundant', 'review', 'will', 'strictly', 'be', 'regarding', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'star', 'disc', 'as', 'clean', 'whistle', 'distracting', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'aliasing', 'ghosting', 'anywhere', 'not', 'comparison', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'blu', 'ray', 'blu', 'ray', 'will', 'find', 'deeper', 'blacks', 'perhaps', 'even', 'crushed', 'bit', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'coloration', 'film', 'switches', 'cool', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'depending', 'scene', 'very', 'appropriate', 'standard', 'def', 'release', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'considerable', 'improvement', 'entire', 'look', 'film', 'TV', 'passes', 'pluge', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'gray', 'before', 'now', 'true', 'black', 'Really', 'well', 'done.The', 'audio', 'am', 'always', 'aware', 'very', 'nice', 'editing', 'discreet', 'steering', 'channels', 'foley', 'fx', 'full', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stage', 'less', 'audio', 'reason', 'why', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'inane', 'reason', 'producers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'Instead', 'get', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'difference', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'lossless', 'audio', 'track', 'most', 'not', 'sound', 'tracks', 'are', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'cognizant', 'listening', 'compressed', 'soundtrack', 'listening', 'veil', 'However', 'audio', 'blu', 'ray', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remote', 'volume', 'setting', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'uncompressed', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'would', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'most', 'sound', 'system.Some', 'decent', 'extras', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'fruition', 'script', 'shooting', 'addressing', 'reasons', 'go', 'boxing', 'more', 'No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'least', 'advertising', 'previews', 'other', 'movies.All', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'DTS', 'MA', 'PCM', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'blu', 'ray', 'purchase', 'even', 'not', 'huge', 'night', 'day', 'difference', 'SD', 'BR', 'releases', 'Glad', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'release', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'would', 'buy', 'again.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase.Thanks']",N/A

633526,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005JNP1,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 2]","Million Dollar Baby (2004)Drama, Sport, 132 minutesDirected by Clint EastwoodStarring Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan FreemanBoxing isn't a sport that I find appealing. I did follow the career of Muhummad Ali as a child, but haven't paid much attention since he retired. It's a brutal way to earn a living. I do admire people for the dedication it involves, but it's no longer something that I want to watch.There have been several good boxing movies over the years, from Rocky and Raging Bull to Cinderella Man and The Fighter. Each of those movies attempted to show the character behind the gloves, and that's where my interest lies when I do watch a boxing movie. As a fan of Clint Eastwood, I was particularly interested to see whether he would bring a fresh perspective as he has done in films showing racism and war from unexpected viewpoints. He didn't disappoint me.Million Dollar Baby depicts women's boxing and focuses on Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She thinks of herself as trash, works as a waitress to pay the bills, and often resorts to eating leftovers from the diner. She shows up at Frankie Dunn's (Eastwood) gym and begs him to train her. He refuses, so Eddie Dupris (Freeman) shows her a few techniques. Frankie eventually agrees to train her after seeing how dedicated she is. Boxing is her only hope of escaping her miserable existence.Frankie has problems of his own and is trying to get in touch with his estranged daughter, so Maggie becomes an outlet for Frankie's fatherly affection in some ways. He soon sees what amazing character she has. She's not only determined to succeed, but is kind to her ungrateful family when she starts to earn decent money.Eastwood deviates from the normal formula by showing some of the grim reality of the sport. Not every aspiring fighter succeeds and Freeman's character has to live with the loss of an eye after being injured in his 109th fight. The film shows the dangers of boxing and how cutthroat the business can be. The thing which elevates it is the realism and the delicate way Frankie and Maggie deal with adversity.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 2]","Abandon any notions that Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is another routine underdog-rises-to-the-top boxing tale.  This is a film more concerned with examining the hard choices that life sometimes asks us to make.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) asks Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to train her as a boxer.  Frankie refuses because he says she is too old and a girl.  Yet, the defiant Maggie continues to insist and, with the support of Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), gets Frankie to change his mind.  Soon she is on the fast track to success but a terrifying accident abruptly changes her life and forces Frankie to make a difficult decision.Eastwood never resorts to melodrama or cheap manipulative tricks in ""Million Dollar Baby"" to examine the value of one's personal dignity.  He instead uses his veteran directing talents to weave together a heartbreaking story that refuses to supply any easy answers.  Maggie's quick professional ascension may stretch credibility a bit but this is a minor quibble.

But, not if Frankie Dunn has anything to say about it. Spotting her in his gym, Frankie tells Maggie that at her age there is no way that she has a chance (obviously Frankie hasn't watched any of the ""Rocky"" films).Maggie talks Frankie into being her trainer, telling him that all her life she's been poor ""white-trash"" and that this is her last ditch effort at doing something, anything with her life. Frankie reluctantly agrees, but, on one condition - Maggie must do everything Frankie teaches her to do & with no ""ifs"", ""ands"", or ""but's"" about it. Over the next four years Maggie trains and becomes a real fighter, but, Frankie is still nervous about her going pro. Reluctantly, again, Frankie makes the descision and lets Maggie go pro. The results are surprising, enthusiastic, and  ultimately tragic.""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of those films that has points in the film where the director could have taken the film in different & familiar, formulaic directions but doesn't. Before I saw the film, I had heard something of the tragic last-half of ""Baby"", but, I wasn't told what the tragedy was and exactly where it would be in the film. With that said, there were, for me, a few twists & turns in the film.Hillary Swank is at her best as Maggie & rightfully deserves the Oscar for her portrayal. Eastwood is great as the cranky, crotchety Frankie & you can't help but hear his heart break at the end of the film, when he loses the daughter he found. Eastwood is a Hollywood Legend that will be sorely missed if he retires or, God forbid, passes on.Morgan Freeman turns in, what I hope will be, his most memorable role as one of Frankie's former prize fighters now retired and living & working in Frankie's gym.

633532,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B00005JNP1,"the one and only ""david""","[2, 4]","Million Dollar Baby is the story of how a boxing trainer manages to find respect and admiration for a potential boxer that at first he didn't want anything to do with......The reason why this movie manages to shine is the dialogue from all the characters. Sometimes whole stories can be seen as they talk about stories of their character's past. Clint Eastwood makes sure each character has their own strengths and weaknesses:From a young man who wants to be a boxer who suffers abuse from his fellow boxers in a gym, to an old gym-caretaker played by Morgan Freeman [Scrap] who narrates the movie and offers help to Hilary Swanks character [Maggie].Even Clint Eastwood's character Frankie Dunn, who gives a great perfromance as a man who went from not caring much about female boxers, manages to find himself caring for Maggie near the end of the movie. I found Maggie's and Frankie's relationship in the movie genuwine and heartwarming, as a young female hopeful shows up at Frankie's gym just asking for a chance for Frankie to train her.The movie shows us some great boxing fights as Maggie steadily climbs to the top of the female brand. A first round knockout in about 10 seconds was considered normal for one of Maggie's fights. Frankie even has to go and pay other trainers to put their fighers in with Maggie after a while, but even that stops after a few more fights.I've heard some people comment on how slow the second half of the movie is after the accident [No spoilers ahead, so don't worry] But again, its the DIALOGUE that is what makes this movie. How Frankie transforms into this caring man who becomes great friends with Maggie, and Scrap manages to get his 110th fight he so desperately wanted.This is one of the best acting movies in the year 2004, quite arguably THE best, but thats for you to decide.

Swank plays this waitress from trailer park Missouri who comes to California to pursue her dreams. She eats off folks leavings at work and saves up just about every dime and works hard because as Morgan Freeman so beautifully narrated in the film, there is a dream in everyone that only they can see and for her it's a shot at becoming a female boxer; She don't have many people in her corner rooting for her; Matter of fact, her family down her and even spurns the house she buys in cash money for them because as the mother puts it, ""she don't wanna mess up her welfare"" that just reinforces to me that that mentality isn't in any one group of folk. Anyhow, in spite of the odds(she's over 30, little or no support, one woman in a male dominated field,the lack of respect female boxers get, the reluctance of Eastwood to even want to train her (""I Don't Train Girls"") she makes a name for herself and rise up in the ranks in spite of the fact that other fighters are reluctant to spar with her due to her knocking them out in the first round.And even when things get better, she stays grounded and keeps on training. One of the saddest yet triumphant scenes in the movie is when her family comes to see her in the hospital, going to Disneyland on her dime mind you(Remember they felt she was a laughing stock) and wanted her to sign some papers basically giving them complete control over her affairs and with the lawyer in hand, mind you but she kicks them to the curb and sends their butts packing. But in spite of the good, there's some bad and sad; Won't spoil it all. One more thing, I think Morgan Freeman's role in the movie as narrator and as the voice of reason to Clint Eastwood's character was refreshing and candid; I liked and applauded it; Eastwood gave a great performance as well. I tell you what though, that priest needed telling off. If a person is trying to find God no matter how old or what have you, it is your job to help them to him.

633534,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JNP1,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 3]","Director:  Clint EastwoodCast:  Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Jay Burachel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker.Running Time:  132 minutesRated PG-13 for boxing violence, thematic material, and some language.Fresh off his success of the critically acclaimed ""Mystic River"", director Clint Eastwood embarked on ""Million Dollar Baby"", the ""Rocky""-esque account of a near middle-aged, courageous individual who would give up anything just to follow the path in which she believes she needs to take.  What originally begins as a sports drama becomes much more:  a harrowing depiction of the despair that comes from the loss of a loved one, the tremendous valor of the soul that can be reached through the help, assistance, and dedication of others, and the ultimate sense of loyalty and care.  Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (he has lost contact with his only daughter). His guilt and ignominy is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank in a wonderfully portrayed role), a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove.  Morgan Freeman plays Scrape, Dunn's right-hand man at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from ""The Shawshank Redemption"". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together.  Together, the three enter on a journey of courage, hard-work, and love, which eventually leads Maggie to the peak of accomplishment-a chance for fight for the woman's welterweight championship.Eastwood's performance in ""Baby"" is just the right anchor the film needs to keep it from sinking due to a heavy dramatic workload, and the clich&eacute;d material the script touches on from time to time. His gruff, weathered performance hits all the right notes, but also retains an unanticipated warmth that Eastwood rarely lets out. His co-stars are just as striking. Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" partner Freeman is a treat in a supporting role (which he won an Oscar for).  The two enjoy easy chemistry and longstanding acting history and it shows winningly in every frame they share.  The elders are an excellent tease for ""Baby,"" but it all hangs on Hilary Swank's performance in the title role. A chameleon performer, Swank inhabits Maggie both mentally and physically, breaking quite a sweat in both departments. Maggie isn't a lost soul, but her defiance in spirit and lack of guidance has led her into a dead end. Swank captures that lost but ultimately found emotional movement like a champ, and her pugilist skills seen in various boxing matches are just as believable. Swank isn't the seasoned acting pro like her co-stars, but her full court press in this difficult role is stunning, and her performance perfection because of her unwavering dedication to the character's flaws. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light.

633535,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNP1,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 5]","It is exciting to watch a filmmaker at the height of their powers tell a moving, memorable story.Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is such an example of this.Frankie Frank (Clint Eastwood), a former boxer, now owns a rundown gym in downtown Los Angeles and trains hopeful boxers on the side. He handpicks the boxers, coaxing them, bringing them up through the ranks slowly. Too slowly for his current prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who jumps ship just before his big chance at the championship. Watching all of this, with a knowing eye, is Eddie Scrap - Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Eddie is a former boxer who was once trained by Frank. Now, he manages Frank's gym for him. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) walks into the gym and starts training. She asks Frank to become her trainer. Initially, he turns her down, using her age and lack of experience as reasons. As Maggie proves she is determined to become a boxer, Frank gives in to her requests and becomes her mentor.""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film about boxers. It is not a film about boxing. The story revolves around the three main characters and their relationships with one another. Boxing occasionally happens, it is Maggie's goal to become a boxer, so the film is going to have some scenes involving a ring and gloves.Hillary Swank is amazing as Maggie. She loses herself in the character, showing Maggie's drive and determination as the character struggles to make ends meet working a job as a waitress on Venice Beach. There are probably more scenes of Maggie working, riding the bus, counting pennies, eating leftover scraps, and training then there are of actual boxing matches. As Maggie struggles with her long days, Swank doesn't let the character slow down or become depressed. This is her dream, and probably her only shot at getting out of the gutter. Every little step towards this goal makes her happy.Morgan Freeman is also great as the older, perhaps wiser, boxer who watches Frank's gym. He and Frank are friends, Frank was a trainer late in Eddie's career. But their relationship is more than friendship. Now, Eddie is more of the mentor to Frank's character, roles that were previously reversed. Freeman's portrayal of this character is very quiet, but it works perfectly. This man has seen a lot and doesn't have a lot. He doesn't mind sharing his thoughts. He pushes Frank to take Maggie on as a student and also becomes emotionally invested in her fate.The weak link in the trio is Eastwood. He does a great job with the direction of the film, but Eastwood has difficulty convincing me that he is anyone other than Eastwood. He is a bit like Gary Cooper or John Wayne now. He is, perhaps, too iconic for us to forget that we are ever watching Eastwood play a character. That isn't to say that his character isn't intensely interesting and very real. Frank frequently visits the local church seeking guidance from the Father. He's been going every day for years and he and the father have a prickly relationship. Frank likes to goad him on and the Father is frankly tired of him. This relationship pays off extremely well during the course of the film. The relationship between Frank and Maggie grows until we feel that they share real admiration for one another.The other regulars of the gym are not quite as believable. One character, in particular, sticks out like a sore thumb. A skinny red neck seems to be involved for comic relief and it isn't needed.Clint Eastwood is a masterful director. Intent on letting scenes unfold at their natural pace, his films seem all the more real. He doesn't bother with special effects or car chases (anymore) and the story benefits from it. His last few films have explored the main characters, creating rich stories that really move the viewer.The film was written by Paul Haggis. Haggis is the creator of one of my favorite television series of all time, the little scene `EZ Streets', a cop drama from the mid 90s that was cancelled after a few seasons. It is easy to see his touch on this film. In both stories, he creates rich believable characters that make each seem real, moving and powerful.I can't recommend ""Million Dollar Baby"" enough.

They are played by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman respectively, and they all deserve the awards and praises they have already got, for what they have done as real professional actors.  In short, their acting is simply great.Don't follow the story.  Some people, quite understandably, thought that this is a female version of 'Rocky.'  Don't get me wrong here, for to me 'Rocky' is also one of the greatest films ever made.  To those who expect 'Rocky'-type story, some part of 'Million Dollar Baby' might be depressing, especially when the film ends in an unexpected way.  But remember, Rocky in fact didn't win the bout (Apollo did), but you know that is not the point.  The point is, like star Stallone himself, it was a do-or-die project, and he did it.And boxing is the do-or-die project for Maggie, and you will know that at the end of the film.  You will get to know the believable characters (including the ones who hang around the old boxing gym), and the film slowly reveals the life of them on screen.The slow-moving pace of the film may not appeal to you.  Actually, some might find part of the film a bit dull.  I did, but I also know this is a kind of film in which you have to keep the same pace with the realistic characters because in reality things just don't happen so fast.

Under Frankie's tutelage, Maggie's raw talent is processed and refined and she quickly picks up the skills needed to be successful as a boxing champ. She becomes the knockout queen, knocking her opponents out one after the other before the end of the first round. After a championship fight in England and a European tour that still left her undefeated, Maggie comes back to the states as a member of a whole new level of play. Agents across the country come crawling and the offers roll in. Frankie knows Maggie is good, but he still believes in perseverance and patience and wants to keep her from fighting for the world championship until she gets a couple more fights under her belt. But, Maggie is his Million Dollar Baby and his surrogate daughter and Frankie can't deny her anything. So it's off to Las Vegas to fight the world champion, Billie &#34;The Blue Bear&#34;. That fight changes everything and the backdrop of boxing fades away as the lives of the characters begin a journey down a less-traveled path.The best thing about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the acting. Morgan Freeman plays a supporting role as Eddie Dupris and lends his voice as the film's narrator. Freeman is a master of underplay and makes the most simple and mundane scenes and lines full of power and emotion just by a simple facial gesture or change in tone of voice. His 2005 Best Supporting Actor win was well deserved and long overdue.Hillary Swank does a remarkable job portraying Maggie Fitzgerald and went through a great deal of training and conditioning to tone her body for the role. Her performance in the first 2/3rds of the film is amazing. However, though she is believable in the last 1/3rd of the movie, she really didn't do much acting (it's rather easy to let your limbs go limp). Her performance garnered another Best Actress win, but one that might not have been deserved as voters were taken back more by emotion than actual performance.With MILLION DOLLAR BABY Clint Eastwood has now officially directed about half the number of films he has acted in and about half of those are pictures he acted in as well. Eastwood did a brilliant job of directing by melding three top-notch acting performances together so they feel as though they are one whole. He was able to do this despite a several cliches in the plot, a few cheesy lines, a limited budget, and three strong performers. As much as I would like to see Martin Scorsese win a Best Director Oscar before he dies, Eastwood's direction was better and MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a slightly better picture than THE AVIATOR because it flows together much more smoothly whereas THE AVIATOR (despite all its brilliance and bringing a long-gone era back to life) is long and somewhat choppy.However, as far as movies go, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is really just an average flick. Sure it has some great performances, direction, lighting, even some occasional witty banter. But all of that without a great story does not make a great movie. There are moments in the movie that are touching, especially with the relationships between the three main characters. But much of the &#34;emotion&#34; surrounding the movie is simply hype having to deal with the controversial subject that the film deals with in the last act. Unlike some, I did find the accident to be believable. My problem is that the way the controversial subject is handled failed to move me in any direction. The film's solution did not anger me to protest nor did it make me want to &#34;switch sides&#34; and become a Kevorkian sympathizer because I &#34;understand&#34; now. In fact, the way the movie handles the whole situation left me rather indifferent and apathetic. A great movie doesn't do that.Besides the &#34;controversial subject&#34; the movie deals with, the picture also points a negative picture of family and religious leaders. There are people in the world like Maggie's family. However, that combined with the fact that Frankie's daughter is the one who refuses to reconcile and leaves a complete negative picture of familial relationships. Then there is the mockery of religion. The priest of the church that Frankie attends is uncaring, aloft, unsympathetic, and unloving. He treats Frankie with disdain and loathing instead of compassion and empathy. I'm sure that there are religious leaders like that in the world, but not many. I just found it disheartening that once again the only religious leader of a Hollywood picture was portrayed in a negative light instead of a positive one.MILLION DOLLAR BABY is worth seeing for the fine acting performances, but as far as movies go in general, it's just about average and really shouldn't have won BEST PICTURE (the movie that should have won wasn't even nominated).",3,What's the

There is no glitz and glam, no lazy attempts at trying to make the plot exciting through special effects, and no waste of time for the audiences. The plot is just excellent, it's not too complex or too trite, it's simple and to the point, and yet has more depth and heart than any film that has been out in this past year. It just can't get better. And the casting is excellent. Unlike most films that use the most sexy and gorgeous actress out there to play doctors, scientists, etc. (which are horribly unconvincing and at times inane), Hillary Swank once again portrays a real character who for one doesn't look like she came out of Vogue magazine, and actually has heart and soul. She's very convincing as a boxer as well. Clint Eastwood being a coach and a father figure was also very touching. I am not going to write about the plot, because quite frankly i think reviews should simply be an opinion, not a synopsis of the entire plot from start to finish.

For once a movie emerges that is well written, well filmed and well acted with a little controversy thrown in like a punch for good measure.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) emerges from a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. She reeks of white trash but manages to perfume herself with an undying dream. Maggie wears her heart on her sleeve and exists on the edge of survival pushing towards something better. She pursues the sport of women's boxing with relentless fervor befriending gym-owner Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Together the misfits persuade Eddie's partner, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), to train Maggie professionally. Beneath all the punches there exists vulnerable lives and failing egos but through teamwork and Maggie's brawn the boxing ring encircles them with life lessons.Oscar winner Hilary Swank is incredible in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald. Swank takes the punches and leaves behind the glamour of less gritty roles with her choices paying off immensely. She is entirely believable as the down on her luck loner trying to overcome the stigma of a worthless family. She is America, rough and rugged but filled with a blind passion to succeed despite all the critics who loom at large beneath her dreams. Clint Eastwood captures the power of simplicity in both his acting and directing on this film. Each scene is as unglamorous as most mundane lives unfolding quietly to reveal the true essence of living, that daily grind that most of us forget to appreciate. But it's the grind that reveals our true character and without Eastwood's brilliant low-key style this film would have never emerged as a million dollar gem. As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is subdued on the surface yet boiling underneath only overflowing with emotions as necessary. And of course the ever fabulous Morgan Freeman excels in his role as a half-blind ex-boxer content to mop floors and wipe bloody noses for his remaining days. His narration guides us forward and offers comfort to this hopeful and sometimes tragic story of real life struggles.This film is simply beautiful. It will make your heart soar for the grittiness of an underdog while identifying with a questioning soul. It is about hard work, perseverance and latching onto a passionate dream that guides you forward relentlessly. But it's also about hard choices and devotion that will leave viewers questioning right and wrong when faced with the desires of someone you love. This film sucker punches you in the end and leaves you breathless for days.

Eastwood takes the plot which seems cliche on paper and turns it into gold, with great character development/camera lighting,etc,etc. Another thing that helps the movie to not fall to cliche is the change in the second half, a fairly good boxing drama effectively turning into a human drama.

Behind her can be seen a poster whose message inspired her and this film's creators to achieve greatness. It reads, ""Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't"", a message easily applied both to struggling athletes and filmmakers who desire to meet and exceed their dreams.Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" masquerades as a Rocky-meets-Thelma & Louise, a film about a female fighter overcoming the inherent adversity of trying to succeed in a man's sport inside a man's world. On many levels, the film aspires to address that issue, but to reduce it to that point is to fail to recognize the stunning insight it provides on the human heart. With almost limitless ambition, Eastwood tackles the mammoth subjects of lifelong regret, penance and the responsibilities tethered to love.Decorated with the soft tones of Eastwood's own score and narrated by the dulcet voice of Morgan Freeman, ""Million Dollar Baby"" recreates the warm, comfortable feeling of hearing your grandfather tell a story by the fireplace. With slow pacing and development, the film focuses on a determined fighter, Maggie, trying to convince Eastwood's Frankie to train and manage her. Motivation and toughness are not enough for Frankie who tells her ""girlie tough is not enough.""Undaunted by his initial rejection, she preservers and convinces Frankie to handle her career. Not since ""Rudy"" has a character been so determined to reach a goal. A rare return to traditional values, Maggie's story borrows from inspirational tales about people who were able to meet all their aspirations. Compared to her hillbilly family (welfare, illegitimate children, prison), Maggie appears to succeed in life because she sets goals, works hard and makes proper decisions. ""Million Dollar Baby"" does not perpetuate the popular myth found in most Hollywood features that success is handed out to lucky people and failure results from disadvantages. Eastwood's film suggests everyone creates their own place in the world through the cumulative results of their actions and decisions.Once she begins her career, a second story unfolds that I would rather refrain from mentioning. Like ""Fight Club"" or ""The Crying Game"", the film contains a surprise which potential viewers should try to avoid knowing. But even if the ending is known, ""Million Dollar Baby"" succeeds because it gives its audience real characters who will inspire and challenge with their depth and truth.

She has taken her winnings and bought a house for her mother, so that she can move out of the trailer park. Instead of being grateful and proud of her daughter, her mother complains that with a house like this, she won't be able to stay on welfare and Medicaid. ""Why didn't you just give me the money?"" she asks. ""I know your intentions were good, but you just don't think things through,"" she tells her dismayed daughter.""Is Eastwood a Republican?"" I muttered under my breath. This stereotype of poor people - as lazy, deceptive, ungrateful and basically worthless irks me whenever it turns up. And it turns up here, naturally, as a contrast to our hero - who may not have much going for her, but is going to follow her dream with determination and persistence and make something of herself. Good. Great. Heard it before. This won Best Picture?And then it just goes from bad to worse. Our plucky heroine, who got to the title fight on nothing but determination and stubbornness, who refused to accept the hand dealt to her and celebrates her birthday by punching a speed bag, because if she doesn't have that, she ""might as well go back home and buy a used trailer and get a deep fryer and some Oreos,"" becomes an entirely different person. And yet somehow we're still supposed to admire her; to agree with her decision to end her life. Why? Because she's paralyzed? What happened to all that pluck, that determination to take the cards you're dealt and make life count? There are lots of things a person can do in a wheelchair - isn't that why we love Christopher Reeve, because like Hilary in the first half of the movie, he refused to give up? In her teary plea to Clint, she begs him to let her die ""before the cheers fade from my ears."" Well, news for you babe, paralyzed or not, the cheers will eventually fade from your ears. Heck, if we're going to kill off everyone who is no longer able to pursue their dream, then somebody better go get Morgan Freeman he's certainly past his prime, time to put a bullet his head.

633560,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JNP1,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[5, 14]","Million Dollar Baby is my favorite Clint Eastwood film along with his Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil, The Bridges of Madison County, and last year's Mystic River. Casting Hilary Swank as an aspiring female boxer is the best thing about this film, because she has the ability to go to the extreme musculine side like no other girls in Hollywood can. Just take her Oscar-winning role in Boys Don't Cry for example. It's very convincing especially she had gained more than 15 lbs of hard muscles as result of preparing for her role in this film.Swank plays a cafe junkie waitress(Maggie) who sometimes eats left-over steak in order to save money to train at Frankie's gym. She grew up in a disfunctional family. Daddy died early, and her mother is fat, heartless, and her siblings are nut cases. To her, boxing was all that she loved and hoped to make it big if Frankie would train her. At first, she gets rejected by Frankie, because he doesn't trian girs, and also he has a dark past with his estranged daughter. Maggie didn't give up, and continued to train on her own. Meanwhile, she gets advice from the gym's janitor(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a professional boxer until he was brutally beaten and lost sight on one eye many years ago. He wanted to help her, and eventually convinced Frankie to take her. Frankie finally decided to train her when the guy that he had trained for 7 years walked out on him to find another manager.After many months of intense training, Maggie had become a professional, and started to win in local matches. Eventually, she made it to international championships and won those matches as well. She used her earnings and bought a house for her mama, but she not only was ungrateful, she even said nasty things about her for being a boxer. Maggie was devastated and she became more determined to go further with her career. Then there's the world boxing championship to fight against ""The Blue Bear"", who was almost defeated at the end of the match and she punched Maggied when she wasn't looking. Maggie collapsed, and her neck hit the chair! She past out instantly, and was parallized afterwards.Frankie fell very remorseful for having train her, and see her became a ""vegetable"". Then Maggie makes her ultimate decision about her life, and it was upto Frankie to help her one more time.....It was very moving to see Eastwood breaking down in the church. He had a great deal of chemistry with Swank and it was wonderful and touching that they bonded and he was not only her trainer, he had became a father figure.

What are you going to do about it?""If one line could sum up such a complex movie, that would be it. In part, it's about a woman who starts with just about nothing but a gutful of determination, and succeeds beyond her wildest dreams. Another part is about responsibility - when to accept it and when not to - and the extreme limits of friendship. Well, maybe not friendship, that's not an easy word either. Another part is about making hard choices, and what are the acceptable answers.All of that was carried out by some of the best performances on screen in way too long. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman outdo just about any other actors today, and outdid even themselves here. Hillary Swank's character rose to the same level. With luminaries like Eastwood and Freeman, there's plenty of reflected light for everyone else, be she shone on her own. Among other things, she's a physical actor the way Buster Keaton was a physical comedian, but she's not a comedian.There's a chance you won't like then end, or won't like the choices made.

Being a millionaire and following some strange and monumental ideas is not that important! The Aviator is only a movie with brilliant special effects only for entertainment but this movie has concept! and It's really a Defectless movie. It makes you think about the concept of life. for old people, old for certain jobs I mean, for example for being a Pianist, 20 years age is considered old. This movie for any old people for certain jobs has a message that even as an old man and woman, everyone can get his or her shot anytime. Everything is possible with love and hard work both!and this movie may could not make you weep, although I'm sure many people weep at the last hour of movie. but, Difinately it makes you think.I'm not religious but I heard from some religious people that the punishment is in this world not in everlasting life. They say be kind with you mother, be good with others and similar words. the question is, What wrong had she done for receiving that kind of punishment. she was a good apprantice for her mentor, good daughter for her mother, good sister for her family and nice with others. something seems wrong here. at least at religious point of view. most of american people are religious so I'm sure that's the question of many people. That's very important cause when a kid or a young person who's grown up with religious believes, see this movie, It's highly possible to say to himself or herself, hey, she was nice to everyone. look at her salvation. so what's the benefit of being nice? Fear of GOD that may punish me for being nice? then let's not be nice! and that's not a good lesson.

I understand why she won over her for her performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"" from 1999, but ... she beat her out AGAIN?!  I decided many moons ago that each year I would collect all five of the Best Actress movies (and I've collected all of them since 1980), so that meant, to my chagrin, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was completely necessary.In my eyes, Annette Bening in ""Being Julia"" IS the Best Actress Oscar-winner of 2004 ... but after waiting for seven months for ""Million Dollar Baby"" to arrive, I can understand why Hilary received all the awards hoopla that she did ... and after I turned my DVD player off after the movie, I found myself a believer and a Hilary Swank fan.I'm not going to rehash what so many others have said about this movie; just know that Hilary Swank kicks ass, and she'll be remembered decades from now, for ""Boys Don't Cry"" AND ""Million Dollar Baby.""

I was with my friend and normally, we have the usual, ""So, what did you think of it?"" talk after watching a movie. This time, we didn't. Maybe we were both a little insecure. We are men - and men don't cry at movies, do they? I think we were afraid if we attempted conversation, we might just spill it. So we were quiet for several minutes...At the age of 31, Maggie has been scrubbing dishes for about 15 years now. She decides, ""I never got my shot at a good life"" and based on her education and skills (or lack of), figures boxing might be a good option. Frankie doesn't train girls - says it would lose him business. But when he finally signs her on, you get a hint at why he's doing it. Maybe he sees hope in her, maybe  he senses a spirit that will never give up an opportunity to put behind her insignificant past and hope for a better life...maybe he sees something we don't. She sees in him the man who will (not might... WILL) put her on the map, who will lead her on the road to winning her first million-dollar fight...or maybe she sees something we don't. Scrap sees the both of them; wise-fellow that he is, I would like to believe he always knew more than we ever did, about Frank & Maggie.Most relationships in movies seem to evolve because ""the script says so""...not the case here. What Maggie & Frankie share is a deep, profound love and trust that is way beyond the limits and ambitions of even the greatest love story I may have ever seen - these are two real, seemingly normal everyday folks who have been through the complete, human emotional-rollercoaster. Or so they think...Frankie may be twice Maggie's age and wiser...but even he can't attest to knowing what it feels like to be Maggie.When Maggie looks inside Scrap's dingy little room in the gym and says with a child-like honesty, ""It's very nice"", your heart goes out to the girl - because she means it. Honest - that's how Maggie is...and Hillary Swank makes sure that's how we see her. Maggie might be over 30-years-old...but she's as honest, simple and innocent as a 6-year-old. Hard to believe for a woman that makes a living as a boxer...but this is something you think a LONG time after you've watched the movie. While watching it, you don't even notice it. Swank IS, that good. And this is one of several moments in this movie that have that same overpowering sense of emotion.Almost everyone who's watched this movie lists the scene where Frankie tells Maggie what her Gaelic nickname means as the moment where you feel human, real, touched and moved. I would like to rephrase it as this: Frankie puts his hand down your throat, grabs your heart and rips it out. And then, as you watch the two...you feel like you're starting to grow a new heart. It's tender and raw...Thank you, Mr. Eastwood. Thank you, Ms. Swank. Thank you, Mr. Freeman.
